        "text": "Director: Sydney Pollack\n\nCast: Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray\n\nA struggling actor (Hoffman) secretly cross-dresses as a woman to land a role in a daytime soap opera—and gets too good at the deception.\n\n“Who doesn't want to see Dustin Hoffman in a dress talking with a southern accent?”—Nick Kroll\n\n“The game-changing cinematic cross-dressing performance—and a more important movie, from both a craft and sensibility perspective, than most people make it.”—BD Wong\n\nTime Out says: “The tone is quick-witted and appealing, with some of the smartest dialogue this side of Billy Wilder, and a wonderfully sure-footed performance from Jessica Lange.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Tootsie\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCast: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan\n\nThe stately, Oscar-winning Mafia epic revived Marlon Brando's career and made a star of Al Pacino.\n\n“The richness of the world that Francis Ford Coppola creates, and the stillness of Al Pacino’s performance—I almost luxuriate in these things because the feeling is so intense.”—George MacKay\n\nTime Out says: “An everyday story of Mafia folk, incorporating a severed horse's head in the bed and a number of heartwarming family occasions, as well as pointers on how not to behave in your local trattoria (i.e., blasting the brains of your co-diners all over their fettuccini).”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Godfather\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: John Cassavetes\n\nCast: Gena Rowlands, Peter Falk, Fred Draper\n\nGena Rowlands gives one of the most emotionally charged performances in the history of cinema as a housewife experiencing a nervous breakdown. Peter Falk costars as the husband driving her around the fabled bend.\n\n“Gena Rowlands made such an impact on me. She is one my great influences.”—Betty Buckley\n\n“This is one of the most incredible performances I have ever seen. Gena Rowlands makes me physically tense while watching her downward spiral but not in a way that she blocks you out. You can see every fleeting thought and feeling flicker across her face and body. Unbelievable.”—Kyle Soller\n\nTime Out says: “Rowlands unfortunately overdoes the manic psychosis at times, but Falk is persuasively insane as the husband, and the result is an astonishing, compulsive film, directed with a crackling energy.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch A Woman Under the Influence\n\nDirector: Giuseppe Tornatore\n\nCast: Philippe Noiret, Enzo Cannavale, Antonella Attili\n\nA warm, romantic story about an elderly Italian projectionist’s friendship with a young boy.\n\n“I seriously wonder if the people who dismiss this film have ears. Cinema Paradiso is mainly a delivery device for Ennio Morricone’s most profoundly emotional score—and there’s a lot of competition for that title. Overall, it’s a pure an expression of movie love as I have ever seen.”—Joshua Rothkopf, New York film editor\n\nTime Out says: “The film retains its wide-eyed charm, pitched halfway between unrestrained romanticism and unknowing kitsch. It’s never exactly been fashionable to like Cinema Paradiso, and time won’t have done much to soften the sneers of dissenters. But the advantage of brazen sentimentality is that it gives the film very little to lose.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Cinema Paradiso\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Robert Mulligan\n\nCast: Gregory Peck, John Megna, Frank Overton\n\nThis adaptation of Harper Lee’s landmark novel features Gregory Peck as an Alabama lawyer who defies prejudice by defending a young black man accused of rape.\n\n“It’s my favorite book, and they didn’t fuck it up. ‘Stand up, your father is passing’—the line still makes me weep. It’s a masterclass in how it is always better to do what is right than what is popular.”—Emma Kennedy\n\nTime Out says: “It looks like a storybook of the Old South, with dappled sunlight and woodwormy porches, and Peck is everyone’s favorite uncle.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall\n\nWith this grand, sweeping sequel, Coppola cuts between Mafia don Vito Corleone’s youth in Sicily (and later, New York City) and the fallout from his death decades later.\n\n“There’s the taut, simmering intensity of Al Pacino; there’s the warm, swaggering charisma of Robert De Niro; and there’s Robert Duvall’s masterfully understated performance. I mean, it’s The Godfather—what can I say?”—Riz Ahmed\n\nTime Out says: “This is quite simply one of the saddest movies ever made, a tale of loss, grief and absolute loneliness, an unflinching stare into the darkest moral abyss.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Godfather: Part II\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nCast: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton\n\nWoody Allen is Alvy Singer, a New York comic trying to understand what went wrong during his bumpy love affair with the complex, winning Annie (Keaton).\n\n\"When I think of this film, I think of two scenes: first, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen's characters struggling to cook lobsters; second, Woody's Alvy going for Easter lunch with Annie's relatives and us seeing how they all see him as a rabbi. The rapport between Woody and Diane is electric. The film now feels like a blueprint for so many that came later on—and not just Woody's own.\"—Dave Calhoun, Global film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “This is the link between Woody Allen’s ‘earlier, funnier’ stuff and more probing works like Interiors and Manhattan. Would that we all could build such masterful bridges.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Annie Hall\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds\n\nAnderson’s sprawling tale about a genuinely “gifted” porn star (Mark Wahlberg) is where the director’s talent for big-picture storytelling first made itself apparent. It also wins the contest for the best prosthetic-cock cameo of the past few decades, hands down.\n\n“Punch Drunk Love is probably my favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson’s movies, but this is the one I think best marries his ambition, technical perfection and sheer verve. One of America’s all-time greatest filmmakers hit it out of the park at essentially his first at-bat.”—Zoe Kazan\n\n“His films are where you dream of being as an actor.”—Patrick Kennedy\n\nTime Out says: “What stiffens this unashamedly exhibitionist movie’s muscles are its beautifully judged performances, from Burt Reynolds’ stand-out as porn-king auteur/father figure, to Julianne Moore’s superb cokehead survivor-star and William H. Macy’s humiliated cuckold, right down to Philip Seymour Hoffman’s gut-wrenching gay crew member.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Boogie Nights\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger\n\nCast: Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring, Moira Shearer\n\nA heady, dazzling tale of a dancer (Shearer) caught between the demands of love and work.\n\n“Pretty much perfect in every way. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were masters, and this film about the heights and depths of creativity makes full use of their talents.”—Zoe Kazan\n\n“Completely unique and compelling.”—Anne-Marie Duff\n\nTime Out says: “Blending impressionist art and expressionist film; blurring the barriers between theater and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream; drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical; the centerpiece ballet is a sequence of sheer, reckless transcendence.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Red Shoes\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nCast: Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd\n\nYes, as a matter of fact, we are talkin’ to you. Robert De Niro stars as a psychotic cabbie alongside Jodie Foster, who plays a pubescent prostitute, in this classic set in seedy ’70s Gotham.\n\n“I first saw this when I was in fifth grade at a sleepover and it completely changed my life. For me it’s the best directed and acted film of all time. If you want to learn how to act on film, all you have to do is watch Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver.”—Bill Hader\n\nTime Out says: “Right from the opening credits, as we spy a cab emerging from steam and the eyes of Travis Bickle (De Niro) reflected in his rear-view mirror, we know we’re in someone’s personal hell.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Taxi Driver\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\n\nCast: Al Pacino, John Cazale, Penelope Allen\n\nA desperate, likable schmo (Pacino) tries to pull off a Brooklyn bank robbery in broad daylight and bites off more than he can chew.\n\n“Brilliant and unexpected. Al Pacino and John Cazale give two beautiful performances in the kind of movie I always wanted to be in. Also, the late Sidney Lumet is a director I would have loved to work with.”—Freddie Fox\n\nTime Out says: “A richly detailed, meandering portrait of an incompetent, anxiety-ridden, homosexual bank robber played with ferocious and self-destructive energy by Pacino.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Dog Day Afternoon\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nCast: Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci\n\nIn the 25 years since Scorsese’s rapturously entertaining gangster classic debuted, we’ve seen the release of The Sopranos, Pulp Fiction and Breaking Bad—all of which owe a debt to arguably the most influential film of the director’s career.\n\n“If it is on, I have to watch it. The sheer epic scope of the passage of time noted by voiceover, music and stellar production design makes it a masterpiece in my eyes. There isn’t a false note to be found among the many sprawling performances by an utterly perfect ensemble.”—John Gallagher Jr.\n\nTime Out says: “The movie places an unusual emphasis on verbiage: beautiful arias of profanity, neurotic scheming, paranoid delusions. It’s impossible to imagine a gab-happy filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino rising without Goodfellas.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Goodfellas\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Bruce Robinson\n\nCast: Richard E. Grant, Paul McGann, Richard Griffiths\n\nA huge cult film in its native England, this acerbic comedy stars Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann as two unemployed actors in the late ’60s who embark on a disastrous holiday.\n\n“Every line of dialogue is quotable gold. The first time I saw it I wanted to write down each word but was far too mesmerized. It’s as hilarious as it’s heartbreaking. I heard Bruce Robinson originally imagined the film as a novel, which makes sense given its sweeping literary tone. It plays out like a grand old classic.”—John Gallagher Jr\n\nTime Out says: “Withnail only gets better with time. Yes, it’s funny, but it’s also tender and sad, from the arresting sound of Procol Harum’s ‘Whiter Shade of Pale’ in the opening scene to its final, rainy farewell.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Withnail & I\n\nDirector: Ken Loach\n\nCast: David Bradley, Brian Glover, Freddie Fletcher\n\nBritish filmmaker Loach is consistently named as a major influence by directors from around the world; this film is proof that all that praise is more than warranted. Loach’s unsentimental, affecting tale of the relationship between an impoverished boy and his pet falcon set the mold for every examination of working-class strife that would follow.\n\n“You might have to watch this one with subtitles, the Yorkshire accents are so thick. But it’s worth it. A scene where a young boy explains to his class how he trains a kestrel is one of the truly transcendent moments in film. It’s beautiful.”—Bill Hader\n\nTime Out says: “Kes is one of the most astute, engaged films about education and what it takes for kids to be excited about learning—or passionate about anything, whether in the classroom or roaming the fields with a feathered friend.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Kes\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nCast: Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger\n\nThe look on Judy Garland’s face when she first sees Oz. The cackle of the Wicked Witch of the West. The melody to “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Ray Bolger’s wonderfully loose-limbed dance. Flying monkeys. You can’t improve on this one.\n\n“This movie changed my life forever. I saw it for the first time when I was five years old, and even then I remember worshipping the Wicked Witch of the West. Margaret Hamilton just looked like she was having the most fun of anyone. And that’s the exact moment I knew what I wanted to do with my life.”—Kristen Johnson\n\nTime Out says: “Like Chaplin’s The Kid or E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Wizard of Oz simply lays bare primal emotions. It exposes our childhood anxieties about abandonment and powerlessness and brings to light the tension between the repressive comforts of home and the liberating terrors of the unknown marking all our adult lives.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Wizard of Oz\n\nDirector: Elia Kazan\n\nCast: Marlon Brando, Karl Madden. Lee J. Cobb\n\nMarlon Brando’s softheaded utterances, his angelic frown and darkening stare as Terry Malloy, dockworker and washed-up boxer, still burn out of the actor’s deep conviction 60 years on. A beautiful and important film.\n\n“I know, I know, I'm biased. But what an amazing film that absolutely captures what was a sea change in American acting. Iconic for a reason.”—Zoe Kazan\n\nTime Out says: “Superb performances (none more so than Brando as Terry Malloy, the ex-boxer unwittingly entangled in corrupt union politics), a memorably colorful script by Budd Schulberg, and a sure control of atmosphere make this account of Brando’s struggles against a gangster’s hold over the union powerful stuff.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch On the Waterfront\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nCast: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd\n\nStanley Kubrick presents horror at its most artful, as Jack Nicholson takes an off-season job as a caretaker at a snowed-in Colorado hotel, and brings his family along for the ride.\n\n“Contemplating the sheer mastery that went into this film—from its Steadicam tracking shots to its overall glacial freeze—is almost too frightening to bear. I don’t need the movie to be some kind of hidden apology for faking the Apollo moon landing (as some conspirators have suggested) for it to work for me. Perfect to watch on a snowy day as the light slants sideways.”—Joshua Rothkopf, New York film editor\n\nTime Out says: “All of Stanley Kubrick’s films demand to be seen on a big screen. They’re about people trapped in huge, indifferent machines gone wrong, from a heist plot to a spaceship.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Shining\n\nDirector: Lars von Trier\n\nCast: Emily Watson, Stellan Skarsgård, Katrin Cartlidge\n\nLars Von Trier’s earthy, Scotland-set melodrama, both strange and tragic, tells of a woman (Watson) whose dying oil-worker husband urges her to sleep with other men.\n\n“The first time I saw this film, I thought my heart was going to burst. There was an immediacy to the filmmaking that I had never experienced before. I loved the chapter cards and the ’70s rock songs, and I was so completely swept up in that mad, sick, romantic, tragic story. Everyone in the film is fantastic, especially my all-time favorite actress Katrin Cartlidge, but Emily Watson is totally devastating. The performance has a transcendence to it, like she's channeling spirits. It is so intense and so real, and the camera is totally merged with her, and you're just feeling, almost physically, every second of this performance which swings from childlike naïveté to violent and complicated sexuality to absolute grief and despair. It's unbelievable.”—Melanie Lynskey\n\nTime Out says: “It’s a remarkable achievement for all concerned, with Katrin Cartlidge, as Bess’s widowed sister-in-law, sharing the acting laurels with the radiant Emily Watson, and writer-director Lars von Trier building the emotional and dramatic intensity with consummate skill.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Breaking the Waves\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nCast: John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nRemember when the term Tarantino-esque hadn’t quite cracked the lexicon yet? Then this triptych of tales happened. Surprisingly, the video-store-geek-turned-auteur’s criminal opus still feels fresh, despite the legion of god-awful clones it’s spawned. Accept no substitutes, and relive ’90s cinema glory daze one more time.\n\n“I am drawn to filmmakers who are blessed enough to take the rules, respect them and flip them on their head—all the while maintaining an entertaining piece. Tarantino personifies that here.”—David Gyasi\n\nTime Out says: “There’s plenty of sharp, sassy, profane dialogue, and there are plenty of acute, funny references to pop culture, though the talk sometimes delays the action, and the references sometimes seem self-consciously arch.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Pulp Fiction\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nCast: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen\n\nA Roman general fallen into slavery (Crowe) seeks to avenge the death of his family at the hands of an emperor’s corrupt son.\n\n“I remember being so awed when I watched this. I was completely thrilled by the scale of the battle and the gladiator scenes, and I was lost in the darkness of Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Commodus.”—George MacKay\n\nTime Out says: “The cast is strong (notably Connie Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively and the sets, swordplay and catapults impressive.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Gladiator\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Mathieu Kassovitz\n\nCast: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé, Saïd Taghmaoui\n\nFull of attitude and insight, this French drama offers a night and day on the streets of Paris as three friends roam the city in the wake of a shocking act of police brutality.\n\n“This bristles with authenticity and realism, and yet it’s such a honed and composed vision. It’s probably my favorite film ever. It’s dangerous, hilarious, bold, game-changing.”—Riz Ahmed\n\nTime Out says: “Society may be on the point of self-combustion, but this film betrays no appetite for the explosion. A vital, scalding piece of work.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch La Haine\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss\n\nOr, as we like to call it, Three Men and a Shark. Yes, it’s the film that created the template for the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster. Pity that most of its successors suck so hard.\n\n“So much more than a movie about a shark! The three leads play off each other beautifully.”—John Dagleish\n\n“I watch it every Fourth of July. It has everything you’d want in a movie. It’s what we’ll show the aliens when they land: ‘This is called a movie.’”—Bill Hader\n\n“I still can’t believe that Steven Spielberg came along and changed the whole game with this movie before he was even 30 years old. Now, 40 years later, it is just as compelling, thrilling and terrifying as ever.”—John Gallagher Jr.\n\nTime Out says: “Is there such a thing as a perfect film? One that knows what it wants to achieve and does it, flawlessly, artfully and intelligently? If so, then Jaws is as good a candidate as any.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Jaws\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nCast: Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci\n\nIs it really the best film of the ’80s? It’s certainly a strong contender (ba-da-bing!), and there’s little doubt that Robert De Niro’s performance is one of the all-time greats—not just for the remarkable physical transformation, but also for his embodiment of male sexual jealousy presenting itself as rage.\n\n“The fire of Robert De Niro's performance is so fascinating throughout that only after watching it, when you step away from it, do you appreciate the work and the length to which he went to achieve it. It is really inspiring.”—George MacKay\n\n“Brutal and beautiful. This opened up the possibilities of what film acting could be to me.”—Michael Sheen\n\nTime Out says: “Raging Bull is a masterclass in pain inflicted on oneself and one’s loved ones, as well as one’s opponents. The use of pop and opera and the black-and-white photography (by Michael Chapman) are exemplary. The actual boxing is a compulsive dance of death.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Raging Bull\n\nDirector: Mike Nichols\n\nCast: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal\n\nBefore he went on to make relationship horror movies like Carnal Knowledge and Closer, Mike Nichols adapted Edward Albee’s marital merry-go-round of bickering into a forum for on-off married couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to engage in some very public relationship therapy. George Segal and Sandy Dennis play the other couple caught up in the web of deceit and denial. All four are blessed with the kind of barbed dialogue most actors would kill for.\n\n“This is balls-to-the-wall, fearless, theatrical, old-school, Hollywood-royalty movie acting.”—BD Wong\n\nTime Out says: “Taylor gives what is probably her finest performance as the blowsy harridan Martha, while Burton is not quite so hammy as usual as her angst-ridden college-professor husband.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nCast: Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon\n\nEverybody remembers Lemmon and Curtis in drag, affecting hideous falsettos and tottering in high heels, but Curtis’s devastating Cary Grant impression is the film’s comic highlight. Meanwhile, Marilyn Monroe delivers one of her most effervescent, coherent performances.\n\n“I had an obsession with Marilyn Monroe from the age of 10 and this is one of my favorites.”—Joanne Froggatt\n\nTime Out says: “Some Like It Hot speeds along—the first rule of laughs is pacing—and in its gender-soft neurotic heroes, you can see everything from Woody Allen to Seth Rogen.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Some Like It Hot\n\nDirector: Joel Coen\n\nCast: Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy\n\nThe Coen brothers’ darkly funny crime story features a star turn from Frances McDormand as a pregnant sheriff, and its multiple Oscar nominations helped to bring American indie cinema in from the cold.\n\n“I've seen Fargo more times than I can count at this point. Marge Gunderson is such an aspirational character for me, both as an actor and as a human. She's who I want to be when I grow up.”—Mary Elizabeth Winstead\n\nTime Out says: “The Coens’ beguiling film is very funny and, finally, very moving. Performed to perfection by an imaginatively assembled cast, it displays the customary Coen virtues, at the same time providing a robust emotional core unaffected by the taint of mere technical virtuosity.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Fargo\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Charles Laughton\n\nCast: Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Billy Chapin\n\nOne of the major tragedies of film history is that Charles Laughton directed only one picture. The one turned out to be a masterpiece: evocative, disturbing and unforgettable. Silent icon Lillian Gish plays a gun-toting woman who protects a group of on-the-run children from Robert Mitchum’s maniacal preacher.\n\n“This brilliant, atmospheric thriller is Robert Mitchum’s finest hour. Daring for its time, it’s about a serial-killer preacher who targets women. It’s also notable for being the only film ever directed by actor Charles Laughton. He was a master in the making.”—Emma Kennedy\n\nTime Out says: “Laughton’s film makes the average film noir look like afterschool kids’ TV. Every shot is a masterclass in contrast, in looming blacks and piercing whites. It’s the most haunted and dreamlike of all American films, a gothic backwoods ramble with the devil at its heels.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Night of the Hunter\n\nDirector: Roman Polanski\n\nCast: Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon\n\nA magnificent exercise in escalating unease, Polanski’s poker-faced adaptation of Ira Levin’s neogothic best-seller follows the pregnancy of Manhattan mom-to-be Mia Farrow as she unwittingly carries the devil’s offspring. One of the best films of the 1960s.\n\n“A horror film that makes you hear baby bumps in the night! It’s been on my mind lately as a pivotal turning point between old-school thrillers—ones that might be called ‘Transylvanian’—and a new breed of modern fear: urban, chatty, cynical.”—Joshua Rothkopf, New York film editor\n\nTime Out says: “It’s main strength comes from Polanski's refusal to simplify matters: Ambiguity is constant, in that we are never sure whether Farrow's paranoia about a witches' coven is grounded in reality or a figment of her frustrated imagination.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Rosemary's Baby\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Roman Polanski\n\nCast: Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston\n\nPolanski’s masterpiece is several things: a cynical history of L.A.’s property grabs of the ’30s, a gorgeously lush postnoir, and Jack Nicholson’s finest two hours, as a seedy private detective drawn to the money. Robert Towne’s legendary original script takes American greed and shoots it through a Hollywood prism.\n\n“The height of my favorite movie star’s career. Jack is subtle and bemused in this, trusting his director’s brilliance. It has all the humor, intelligence and darkness you’d expect from Polanski and writer Robert Towne. I can watch it over and over.”—Patrick Kennedy\n\nTime Out says: “In 1974, a director (Polanski), a screenwriter (Towne) and a producer (Robert Evans) could decide to beat a genre senseless and dump it in the wilds of Greek tragedy.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Chinatown\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nCast: Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray\n\nOne of the blackest Hollywood comedies ever made, Billy Wilder’s gem stars Jack Lemmon as a lowly office worker whose star rises when he lends out his city pad to bosses for extramarital affairs. Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner was clearly paying attention.\n\n“A wonderful satire about corporate culture and how people are used by it. Bitter and sweet, this is one of my favorites by Wilder.”—Betty Buckley\n\nTime Out says: “The quintessential New York movie—with exquisite design and shimmering black-and-white photography—it presented something of a breakthrough in its portrayal of the war of the sexes, with a sour and cynical view of the self-deception, loneliness and cruelty involved in ‘romantic’ liaisons.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Apartment\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Olivier Dahan\n\nCast: Marion Cotillard, Sylvie Testud, Pascal Greggory\n\nThe grande dame of doomed chanteuses, Edith Piaf, finally gets her tragic biopic; director Olivier Dahan and actor Marion Cotillard do the great singer justice.\n\n“Marion Cotillard in this film is my bench mark for a best-actress award.

Not a line, not a shot, not a hair out of place. The romantic core is heartbreaking, but the film is surprisingly tough too: all that business about Claude Rains blackmailing young women, and Rick’s attitude to his poor discarded Yvonne. It never pulls punches.\"—Tom Huddleston, assistant UK film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “Bogart, Bergman, a catchy piano tune, Nazis: It’s the love story that has it all.

It’s beautifully photographed and upends expectations at every turn, especially in how it treats the celebrity-laden cast.\n\n“My first properly spiritual experience watching a film.”—Riz Ahmed\n\nTime Out says: “Malick’s visually spectacular, borderline pretentious adaptation of James Jones’s novel confirmed that war is hell—especially when spent in the company of a platoon of philosophy majors.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Thin Red Line\n\nDirector: Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman\n\nCast: Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender\n\nBuster Keaton’s magnum opus stars the Great Stone Face as a Civil War-era engineer who loves his train almost as much as he loves his girl, and finds himself tasked with having to rescue both.\n\n\"I find Keaton much more approachable than Chaplin, even if he never pushed the process of filmmaking quite as far. Just knowing that every stunt here is presented as is, with no camera trickery, is mind-blowing. He really blew up a bridge, with a real train on it!\"—Tom Huddleston, assistant UK film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “Arguably Keaton’s crowning achievement—and inarguably one of the greatest silent comedies ever—this story of a train conductor, his girl and the American Civil War is the dictionary definition of a masterpiece.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The General\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Carol Reed\n\nCast: Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, Alida Valli\n\nTurning postwar Vienna into a riveting labyrinth of shadows, Carol Reed’s iconic noir follows struggling American novelist Holly (Cotton) who combs the city in search of mysterious Harry Lime (Welles), the old friend who invited him there.\n\n“When I first saw this one, I was cowed by its reputation as one of the great noirs—Orson Welles was like a god to me. But returning to it recently, I was struck by how hilarious it is. Closer to a nightmarish Barton Fink than is discussed.”—Joshua Rothkopf, New York film editor\n\nTime Out says: “Just as sultry leading lady Alida Valli feels a little like an Ingrid Bergman imposter, the movie registers just shy of a realistic drama—maybe one that’s been cooked up by the overheated mind of a writer like Holly himself.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Third Man\n\nDirector: Michael Haneke\n\nCast: Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva, Isabelle Huppert\n\nCharting the moments when one couple’s autumn years turn wintry, Michael Haneke’s tender, tragic story of an elderly husband and wife dealing with the latter’s debilitating illness couldn’t be more aptly named.\n\n“People assume that the title is ironic, which makes plenty of sense given Haneke’s well-earned reputation as the coldest director on earth. But I’ve always felt like this is one of the most crushingly romantic movies ever made: All marriages end, but few end as lovingly as the one between Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva.”—David Ehrlich, New York associate film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “Michael Haneke’s tender, tragic story of an elderly husband and wife dealing with the latter’s debilitating illness couldn’t be more aptly named. We all knew Haneke could do cerebral; now the notoriously severe director officially proves he can do emotionally resonant just as well.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Amour\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Bruce Beresford\n\nCast: Robert Duvall, Tess Harper, Betty Buckley\n\nMac Sledge (Duvall) has a drinking problem, an ex-wife (Buckley) and a country-music career on the skids. But he struggles to find a way forward, via reflection, abstinence and the affections of a widow (Harper).\n\n“This film was a great blessing in my life! I played Duvall's ex-wife: country-western star Dixie Scott. I got to work with my heroes in this movie. The song I sang, ‘Over You,’ was nominated for an Oscar and it won the Golden Globe. I sang it on the Globes. This film is an American classic. As our sound man Chris Newman said one night during dailies, ‘This is the ashram of filmmaking.’ All of these amazing world-class artists combined their expertise in a beautiful portrait of alcoholism and redemption.”—Betty Buckley\n\nTime Out says: “Redemption stories are ten to the dozen in Hollywood, but this one feels heartbreakingly genuine—Duvall was never better, and that’s saying something.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Tender Mercies\n\nDirector: Yasujiro Ozu\n\nCast: Chishû Ryû, Chieko Higashiyama, Setsuko Hara\n\nOzu’s depressing but somehow still hopeful masterpiece quietly dissects the generation gap, as children either patronize or just plain ignore their elderly parents. Just about every Ozu film is worth seeing, but this one may be his finest.\n\n“This is the first Yasujiro Ozu film I saw. It blew me away. And made me want to call my parents. Watch it.”—Kyle Soller\n\nTime Out says: “Often topping lists of the best films of all time, and a great influence on many great directors of the last half-century, not least for its purity of expression, this remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinema’s masterpieces.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Tokyo Story\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: George Lucas\n\nCast: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nYes, the acting’s a little clunky. Sure, the dialogue sounds like it was translated from Serbo-Croatian. Still, the first film in the series still retains an earnest, can-do charm, not to mention plenty of Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan.\n\n“This holds such a huge place in my heart for so many reasons, nostalgia being just one of them.”—John Dagleish\n\nTime Out says: “Star Wars itself has distinct limitations, but the current return to a cinema of spectacle and wonder is wholly encouraging. Or would you prefer The Sound of Music?”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Star Wars\n\nDirector: Shane Meadows\n\nCast: Andrew Shim, Ben Marshall, Paddy Considine\n\nPaddy Considine (Dead Man’s Shoes) has become one of the U.K.’s most important actors; here’s another chance to catch his first standout performance, as he causes a rift between two young Yorkshire lads.\n\n\"Shane Meadows is my favorite living British filmmaker, and this is his most perfect film—rough-edged but so intimate and moving. The terrifying scene on the beach where Paddy Considine’s character flips is forever burned into my memory. Amazingly, he’d never acted before in a film.\"—Tom Huddleston, assistant UK film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “Meadows begins with the kind of honest attention to detail you find in Ken Loach, then, like Mike Leigh, builds up comic observation almost to the point of caricature, but with none of Leigh's latent contempt. He likes these boys for their foibles, their vulnerability and fecklessness as much as for their fundamentally good nature.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch A Room for Romeo Brass\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman\n\nCast: Liv Ullmann, Erland Josephson, Bibi Andersson\n\nOriginally a five-hour TV miniseries (accused of spiking the divorce rate in Sweden), Ingmar Bergman’s unsparing domestic drama charts the steady dissolution of the union between a divorce lawyer (Ullmann) and a college professor (Josephson)\n\n\"I can remember seeing this at London's National Film Theatre on re-release in the early 2000s. It was probably the second Ingmar Bergman film I saw, after Wild Strawberries, and it terrified me: such fearless acting, such a complicated, truthful, watch-through-the-fingers depiction of a relationship. Now a bit older, not much wiser, I'm not sure I dare watch it again.”—Dave Calhoun, Global film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “Very little actually happens (much of the film consists of conversations in rooms), so that it's left to the performers—all superb, and mostly framed by Sven Nykvist in revealing close-ups—to bring the litany of pain to life.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Scenes from a Marriage\n\nDirector: Mike Leigh\n\nCast: David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge\n\nJohnny (Thewlis), a viciously snide layabout, flees the Manchester rape police to drop in on his wary ex-girlfriend (Sharp) in London. After seducing her roommate (Cartlidge), he hits the town on a verbal rampage.\n\n“All hail David Thewlis! His riotous and thoroughly unclean performance in this twisted Mike Leigh film is so full of fire—after he screams “I’m a werewolf!” and howls, I was never going to abide anyone else playing Remus Lupin in the Harry Potter movies.”—David Ehrlich, New York associate film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “The cast is outstanding—Thewlis in particular, whose virtuoso performance gives the film its cruel energy, wit and power.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Naked\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Richard Donner\n\nCast: Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman\n\nIt’s a guilty pleasure from the ’80s about plucky kids in search of pirate treasure, and a trip down memory lane for a generation that affectionately remembers John Matuszak as “Sloth” rather than the former defensive end for the L.A. Raiders.\n\n“Frequently tried to recreate this with friends and cousins.”—Riz Ahmed\n\nTime Out says: “It doesn't take long for Richard Donner's film to descend into a mess of obnoxious child performances (only a teenage Josh Brolin escapes with his dignity), harsh visuals and headache-inducing busyness.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Goonies\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam\n\nCast: Jonathan Pryce, Kim Greist, Robert De Niro\n\nGilliam’s dystopic vision of the future is hilarious and chilling by turns; Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Bob Hoskins and Jim Broadbent are among the superlative cast. Once seen, never forgotten.\n\n“Terry Gilliam is without doubt one of my favorite directors and this future vision of a bureaucratic nightmare perfectly demonstrates the glimpse you get into his imagination in all his movies. Some of my favorite actors pop up all the way through it, too.”—John Dagleish\n\nTime Out says: “Gilliam fuses terror and comedy with real brilliance; elsewhere, the plot's gaping holes reduce the film to a glittering novelty.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Brazil\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Michael Haneke\n\nCast: Daniel Auteuil, Juliette Binoche, Maurice Bénichou\n\nA TV host (Auteuil) and his wife (Binoche) start receiving ominous videotapes of their comings and goings filmed outside their Paris home, coupled with suggestive crayon drawings. Their happiness unravels as the police are powerless in the absence of a clear threat.\n\n“I’ll never forget stumbling into the lobby after the New York Film Festival screening of Caché—perfect strangers were practically interrogating each other, demanding answers about that sly last shot. I didn’t want to leave that atmosphere, which I guess is part of the reason why I became a film critic.”—David Ehrlich, New York associate film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “It’s a spectacularly intelligent movie, but it also succeeds superbly as suspenseful, gripping and emotionally affecting drama, thanks in no small part to the uniformly excellent performances.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Caché (Hidden)\n\nDirector: Michael Cimino\n\nCast: Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep\n\nSteelworking Pennsylvanians put away their hunting rifles, down their final beers and head off to serve in Vietnam, where unimaginable horrors await them.\n\n“One of the best casts around at the time of filming and one of the most understatedly powerful and moving stories about the Vietnam era. I’m a pretty huge John Cazale fan and this is his final film. He was dying of bone cancer during filming and Meryl Streep threatened to leave the shoot if the studio fired him like they wanted to. Heartbreaking.”—Kyle Soller\n\nTime Out says: “This is probably one of the few great films of the ’70s…. Running against the grain of liberal guilt and substituting Fordian patriotism, it proposes De Niro as a Ulyssean hero tested to the limit by war.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Deer Hunter\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Jane Campion\n\nCast: Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin, Harvey Keitel\n\nIt’s simple, really: Lady (Holly Hunter) meets gent (Harvey Keitel). Gent has piano. Gent demands sexual favors in exchange for lady to play said instrument. Lady and gent fall in love. Roll end credits. Oh, and Anna Paquin’s in it too.\n\n“I must have been 16 or 17 when I first saw The Piano, and can remember being completely shocked by the sex between Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel. I think I’d never sex on screen before from a woman’s perspective.”—Cath Clarke, UK film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “Campion never underestimates the power physical obsession exerts over human souls, and, for once, a modern film treats erotic passion honestly.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Piano\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nCast: Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F. Murray Abraham\n\nIn a towering pink mansion situated somewhere in a dreamlike 1930s Alps, the elegant Monsieur Gustave (Fiennes) keep old-world civility alive as best he can, while a young lobby boy (Revolori) comes under his fragrant tutelage.\n\n“I never thought that Wes Anderson would top The Fantastic Mr. Fox—and he obviously won’t, because holy shit, what a masterpiece. The Grand Budapest Hotel, however, runs a close second, and that ain’t bad.”—David Ehrlich, New York associate film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “The auteur’s style—dramatic zooms, winking symmetry—is balanced against a newfound political context; this one’s his To Be or Not to Be.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Otto Preminger\n\nCast: Harry Belafonte, Dorothy Dandridge, Pearl Bailey\n\nBizet couldn’t ask for a better adaptation of his famed opera, in which Dorothy Dandridge plays the title role with such panache that one is forced to assume that it was only her race that prevented her from becoming the era’s biggest female star.\n\n“To see actors dancing and singing with such passion and being so good in every discipline will always inspire me. Love Harry Belafonte.”—Nicholas Pinnock\n\nTime Out says: “Prosper Mérimée's fine old tale of high passions and low morals gets re-upholstered Hollywood-style in Preminger's all-black musical.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Carmen Jones\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, Robert Morley\n\nKatharine Hepburn reportedly based her performance in this first-rate WWI adventure on Eleanor Roosevelt; Humphrey Bogart, meanwhile, finally won the Oscar he’d long deserved by playing a salty boat captain. Simple and sublime.\n\n“I first saw this at San Francisco’s famous Castro Theatre, and it was like being transported back to a magical time when all you needed for a grand adventure was a guy, a girl and the worst boat in the world (and maybe a few evil Germans for good measure). Not for nothing, but the Rock learned everything he knows about forehead sweat from Humphrey Bogart’s Charlie Allnut.”—David Ehrlich, New York associate film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “It’s an actor’s film, and although Bogey seems embarrassed having to personify the redemptive forces of courage, love and duty, he’s well worth his Oscar, while Hepburn can play mettlesome and arousable in her sleep.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The African Queen\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Peter Greenaway\n\nCast: Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Alan Howard\n\nAn exquisite French restaurant is taken over by louche investing gangster Albert Spica (Gambon). While he bickers with the chef and wait staff, Spica’s bored wife Georgina (Mirren) starts up an affair with a bookish regular.\n\n“I started out as a child actor in 1985 and remember watching Michael Gambon in The Singing Detective in '86. I was in awe. What he did looked exactly what I imagined the word ‘craft’ to be. Then seeing him in this made me understand what type of actor I wanted to be. To transform.”—Nicholas Pinnock\n\nTime Out says: “Greenaway's film begins with a man stripped naked, force-fed shit and pissed on, and it ends in cannibalism. Between, there lies a simple tale of adultery, jealousy and revenge.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\n\nDirector: Alfonso Cuarón\n\nCast: Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna, Maribel Verdú\n\nThis early work from Cuarón (Gravity) follows 17-year-old horndogs Julio (Gael García Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) on a road trip to a legendary beach. When they’re joined by an older woman, innocence, friendship and sexuality collide.\n\n“I was still a teenager when this movie came out (I heard about it while reading Entertainment Weekly in the waiting room of a doctor’s office), and I had very teenage reasons for wanting to see it. What sticks with me now isn’t the sex so much as the sadness of that last scene, which feels more realistic every time I see it.”—David Ehrlich, New York associate film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “The film's frank, uninhibited sex is refreshing, funny and true, but there's more. One side effect is the trenchant, rueful portrait of Mexico which emerges on the margins: the vast disparities between rural and urban standards of living; between old and new world cultures.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Y Tu Mamá También\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Robert Rossen\n\nCast: Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie\n\nPaul Newman and Jackie Gleason turn the pool table into an existential battlefield in this remarkably sordid, unsentimental drama. Even though it’s set in seedy billiards rooms, a certain grace comes through.\n\n“Paul Newman is my God.”—Katie McGrath\n\nTime Out says: “A wonderful hymn to the last true era when men of substance played pool with a vengeance.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Hustler\n\nDirector: Alan J. Pakula\n\nCast: Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Peter MacNicol\n\nBrooklyn, summer, 1947. A wanna-be novelist (MacNicol) befriends a wildly passionate couple who charm him with their impulsiveness: intense Nathan (Kline) and his Polish immigrant girlfriend, Sophie (Streep), who hides a deeper pain.\n\n“This is such a thought-provoking film, brilliantly acted, and Meryl Streep is perfection in this movie.”—Joanne Froggatt\n\nTime Out says: “One watches uneasily as the obscenity of the Holocaust is served up for our entertainment yet again, and another actor with perfect cheekbones and a crew cut loses a few pounds to lend credibility to a death camp scene.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Sophie's Choice\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Damien Chazelle\n\nCast: Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Paul Reiser\n\nAt New York’s exclusive Shaffer Conservatory, jazz is more than a passion—it’s a martial discipline led by abusive instructor Terence Fletcher (Simmons). When drumming hopeful Andrew (Teller) makes the core ensemble, he’s plunged into a world of pain.\n\n“There isn't one needless second in this film…every frame is perfect.”—Katie McGrath\n\nTime Out says: “Whiplash scrapes the far edge of crazy passion. It never apologizes. And the flurry of drumming it concludes with—Teller’s solo is staggering—is both a magical cacophony and, obliquely, a door slamming shut.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Whiplash\n\nDirector: Richard Curtis\n\nCast: Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy\n\nAs Christmas nears, ten romantic plots play out, in a London-set ensemble comedy with room for sympathetic stepdads (Neeson), American graphic designers (Linney) and an affable, recently elected Prime Minister (Grant).\n\n“Not sure exactly why, but if this movie is on TV, I’m watching it.”—Nick Kroll\n\nTime Out says: “Stranded in this boutique confection are two stand-out performances: Emma Thompson is genuinely touching as the wife of philandering Alan Rickman; and Bill Nighy has a ball as an old rocker with a Christmas comeback single.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Love Actually\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Richard Dreyfuss, François Truffaut, Melinda Dillon\n\nAn Indiana power-grid worker (Dreyfuss) begins to have unshakable visions after he gets a glimpse of an alien presence. Others are similarly touched in Steven Spielberg’s quasi-religious parable suffused with awe and a famous five-tone musical sequence.\n\n“This is a film that has seemed to change over the years for me. It terrified me as a child, then later it spoke to me about the sacrifices of artistic vision, and later again about a spiritual journey towards death and beyond.”—Michael Sheen\n\nTime Out says: “The years since 1977 have shrunk Star Wars, but Close Encounters looks more classic than ever, an insane burst of cinematic optimism which somehow combines Disney and ’50s SF and the imagery of junk food into the most persuasive (if arrested) version of the American dream yet accomplished.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Close Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nDirector: Wim Wenders\n\nCast: Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski, Dean Stockwell\n\nSam Shepard’s dusty, aphoristic dialogue gets sterling support from Robby Müller’s sun-bleached cinematography in this atmospheric tale of a drifter (Harry Dean Stanton) trying to put his life and his family back together.\n\n“When I saw this, it changed the way I looked at how to tell a story. The concept is so simple but it’s executed with such poetic grace: the cinematography, the music, Sam Shepard's script and Harry Dean Stanton delivering one of the best monologues ever over the phone.”—Kyle Soller\n\nTime Out says: “Wenders once more finds himself on the borders of experience, finally achieving an unprecedented declaration of the heart, even if man and wife can only perceive each other through a glass darkly.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Paris, Texas\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman\n\nCast: Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Margaretha Krook\n\nIngmar Bergman’s most hallucinatory film finds an actress (Liv Ullmann) and her nurse (Bibi Andersson) gradually bleeding into one another, as if the dam separating their individual identities had somehow burst.\n\n\"I saw this in a Bergman double feature at the Barbican in London, and was left rattled and intoxicated. It features the sexiest scene I’ve ever seen in a film, without so much as a glimpse of flesh.\"—Tom Huddleston, assistant UK film editor, Time Out\n\nTime Out says: “To comment is to betray the film's extraordinary complexity, but basically it returns to two favorite Bergman themes: the difficulty of true communication between human beings, and the essentially egocentric nature of art.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Persona\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nCast: Martin Landau, Alan Alda, Mia Farrow\n\nA wealthy ophthalmologist (Landau) deeply ensconced in an extramarital affair that could ruin his life turns to violent assistance, while a struggling documentary filmmaker (Allen) trains his camera on a glib success story (Alda) to make ends meet.\n\n“The quote everyone remembers is Alan Alda's 'If it bends, it's funny…if it breaks, it isn't.' But I'm more floored by the quiet, intense parts of this drama, especially the scenes between Landau and his mob brother Jack (the great Jerry Orbach), who sees things a lot more clearly. This movie is Woody's closest at achieving the Bergman-esque toughness he's always admired.”—Joshua Rothkopf, New York film editor\n\nTime Out says: “It's an extremely ambitious film, most akin perhaps to Hannah and Her Sisters, the narrative and tonal coherence of which it sadly lacks, though the assured direction and typically fine ensemble acting manage partly to conceal the seams.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Paolo Sorrentino\n\nCast: Toni Servillo, Carlo Verdone, Sabrina Ferilli\n\nIn decadent modern-day Rome, a former literary sensation turned celebrity gossip columnist (Servillo) has a belated crisis of conscience in this dazzling update of La Dolce Vita.\n\n“Just a beautiful film.”—Nicholas Pinnock\n\nTime Out says: “Wildly uneven or not, the Italian director’s work has been a bright spot in his nation’s fading cinema, and he seems to be purposefully willing a return to yesteryear’s golden age of grotesques and ennui.”\n\nBuy, rent or watch The Great Beauty"
