        "text": "There will undoubtedly already be a film student somewhere who is comparing Drive-Away Dolls and The Tragedy of Macbeth to retrospectively construct the authorial signatures of Joel Coen and Ethan Coen when working separately and together. Where Macbeth was an austere, abstract, beautifully acted, symbolically loaded prestige picture, reminiscent in some ways of work like Miller’s Crossing and Inside Llewyn Davis, Drive-Away Dolls is a gleeful B-movie that recalls the schlockier aspects of films like Raising Arizona and the silliness of Burn After Reading. Drive-Away Dolls is definitely the more Coen-y of the brothers’ recent solo films, especially with its idiosyncratic characters, crime-road movie genre, and love of hilariously gory moments. And yet it’s its own thing too.\n\nCo-written by Coen’s queer wife, Tricia Cooke, this is a nostalgic celebration of the 90s queer scene. Jamie is a hot mess, cheating flagrantly on cop girlfriend Sukie and talking nineteen-to-the-dozen as if slowing down and reflecting on anything would do her damage. She’s contrasted with prim Marian, who hasn’t had sex in years and whose restrained, literary way of interacting with others puts their backs up. They’re a comically mismatched pair who find themselves on a road trip together taking a car to Florida, not realizing that it contains a suspicious briefcase and a severed head (Pedro Pascal, having the kind of fun that only he gets to have these days). And on their tail are a bunch of shady criminals who want their suitcase back.\n\nThe sexual explicitness of the film is part and parcel of its true subject, which is the embrace of one’s own identity. There’s something perhaps surprisingly conservative in the film’s tendency towards a fairly normative monogamy; the central love story may be between two women, but there’s an implicit undertone of a turn towards coupledom. And yet, it’s a choice that’s earned by the film without throwing its other modes of queerness under the bus. Sex is enjoyed by characters within this film; the love that Jamie and Marian find, though, comes out of a deep-rooted friendship and their ability to do something for each other that no-one else can.\n\nThe subversion of the film for the present moment comes in the shock of just how much more controversial being gay is for large portions of American society than it was even in the nineties. Florida is a deliberate choice of location, the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ state the target here for an insistence on the visibility of queerness. And by having one of the film’s central villains be a Republican senator insistent on family values, while also working hard to cover up his own sexually experimental past, the film feels almost prescient in its indictment of the hypocrisy of Florida public figures. Matt Damon, as a senator trying to reclaim possession of a dildo moulded on his own dick, is extremely game.\n\nThe script is, perhaps unsurprisingly, sharp and funny, but also moving in places. The cast of bizarre characters leads to some fascinating moments: Bill Camp as Curlie is a classic Coen taciturn side-character, but his sidelining at a crucial moment is pointed out in a quietly heartbreaking way. Beanie Feldstein gets to play Sukie entirely at 11, and the two Goons who are chasing Marian and Jamie down are an increasingly sleep-deprived wild card who end up destroying themselves in a great jab at the posturing of masculinity.\n\nDrive-Away Dolls doesn’t take itself too seriously, and in having fun it actually manages to achieve much more in relation to its various causes than a more sincere movie might. Its psychedelic cut-aways, its sudden horrible gore (Pascal gets eye-gouged in a direct reference to his death in Game of Thrones), its constant bathos, and its sudden shifts to romance mean that you have to surrender to the ride much as Jamie keeps trying to get Marian to do. And when you lie back and relax, this film suggests – in very unsubtle ways – you might have a surprisingly good time.\n\nThe particular strain of critically acclaimed international “eat the rich” films of recent years – including The Menu and Parasite, as well as television series such as Succession – are unsparing in their absurdist humour and critique of the emptiness of the lives of the monied. Triangle of Sadness is a prestige companion to the sitcom Avenue 5, imagining disaster on board a cruise liner containing the mega-rich and delighting in watching them flail. But as it veers into something more surreal in its final act, it serves as an on-the-nose parable of the dying stages of capitalism.\n\nThe overt target of Triangle of Sadness is initially influencer culture, beginning with a brilliant role reversal in the role of modelling where male model Carl is emasculated even while serving as a literal model of manhood, working as he does in a profession where he can only hope to earn a third of what his female equivalents earn. We see him being ejected from a front-row seat at his girlfriend Yaya’s fashion show in place of VIPs further down the aisle who never even have to know that he was inconvenienced. But Carl is himself part of the elite; when he and Yaya get free tickets for a luxury cruise, he quickly gets one worker fired for daring to be attractive in front of her. The problems here are not with influencers – though influencers are held up as the epitome of the emptiness of wealth. Rather, capitalism itself is empty.\n\nEveryone fancies themselves deep. Carl sits with a copy of Ulysses in his deckchair, and when Yaya tries to avoid paying for their dinner, he tries to lecture her on feminism and not falling into stereotypes. Fertilizer magnate Dimitry (“I sell shit”) insists on debating the virtues of capitalism with the socialist yacht captain. Adorable English couple Winston and Clementine offer wisdom on keeping relationships alive while dealing with the ups and downs of their family business (their business? Arms manufacture). But on this yacht, everything is show and poise. Even the crew are stratified; harassed customer services manager Paula jollies on the front-of-house crew with promises of tips and orders them to service the rich crew in every possible way, while the actual workers on the ship toil in the shadows.\n\nThe film’s primary mode, at least for its first half, is pure comedy in the ridicule of hypocrisy. The justly famous central scene sees an abysmal attempt to host a captain’s dinner during rough weather and while the food hasn’t been properly cooked because the crew were ordered by a Russian passenger to go and have a swim instead of doing their jobs. The pace of the film is kept gloriously steady as the passengers start throwing up one by one and the ship descends into chaos, made worse by Dimitry and the captain holing themselves drunkenly up with the PA system to lecture the crew as the power goes out. We are introduced to a hilariously rich range of awful, awful people on the ship, all of whom are seeking some kind of amusement or purpose in their desperately bored lives, while the crew largely hope to gain the approval of these awful people.\n\nAt the halfway point, though, the film takes a major twist as pirates suddenly attack and sink the ship, leaving a small group of survivors shipwrecked. Now we get an acidic version of Lost in which a surviving toilet attendant turns out to be the only one who has any survival skills; she declares herself captain, takes Carl to be her paid sex attendant, and oversees an increasingly fraught set of circumstances as these rich, pathetic people try to keep themselves alive. While it’s a bit of a shame to lose the larger supporting cast, this tighter section of the film allows a deeper dive into some of the psychologies of rich people who can no longer rely on their money. The remaking of a new hierarchy from the ground-up is funny and savage, especially as Carl starts really revealing his complete shallowness, and attendant Abigail becomes precisely what she hates.\n\nThe film’s final revelation – that the shipwrecked people are just on a quiet coast of a luxury resort – is a final brutal realization of the emptiness of the world that the rich inhabit; even when they are abandoned and at their lowest, they are still in a bubble, and a bubble where no-one truly cares who or where they are. But what the film reveals is just how hard everyone will fight for their particular place in the existing pecking order. No-one here has any interest in changing the system, just in changing or consolidating their place within it. And the film’s comic truth is that this is what will ultimately destroy them – just as surely as trying to continue drinking champagne while you’re vomiting in a storm will.\n\nIf the American Shakespeare Center could be explained in a single image, then Aidan O’Reilly’s Mr. Collins belting out “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” while accompanying himself on accordion might just be that image. Beautifully arranged by Summer England to counterpoise O’Reilly’s raucous lead vocal with an angelic chorus of Bennet sisters, the song encapsulated so much of the ASC Ren Season at its best: a genuinely thrilling concert vibe in a packed house; a smart irreverent commentary on the core dilemma facing so many of the story’s characters (you can’t always get what you want); and a kind of holistic sympathy that demands everyone get the chance to put forward their own case for their story. As an introduction to Emma Whipday’s new stage version of Pride and Prejudice, it served as a prologue to happy endings in which everyone might, through a bit of effort, get what they need.\n\nWhipday’s kind-hearted adaptation is a deeply intelligent and sincere take on Pride and Prejudice, without any of the satirical metatheatrical framing that has characterized some recent UK-based adaptations. The Ren season director-less approach often results in a sense of characters advocating for their own view, and here this particularly worked to diminish much of the snark present in the book’s version of Lizzie Bennet and its narrative voice. Sarah Fallon’s Mrs. Bennet, for instance, was more human than I’ve ever seen the character; she was excessive, but also shrewd and committed in the desire to get her daughters settled, able to delight in Lydia’s (Corrie Green) happiness in her marriage, and providing the social glue that energised scenes. Similarly, Green’s Charlotte Lucas – who in the book is the subject of so much criticism by Lizzie for her choice of marrying Mr. Collins – here was given an arresting self-defence, standing up directly to a Lizzie (Natasia Lucia Reinhardt) who was taken aback by her friend’s sudden insistence on her own autonomy, her right to choose her own version of happiness. And while super-substitute Becca Westbrook, understudying as Mary, repeatedly stole the show with pitch-perfect moralizing (“Oh do hush, Mary!”), fumblings with curtains, and other social awkwardness, her most hilarious moment – in which she belted out an overlong and disproportionately confident solo, interrupting the Bingleys’ ball – was followed by the upsetting sight of her realizing her humiliation and running offstage. Again and again;, this adaptation and this production demanded that its characters engage with others’ perspectives.\n\nThis also drove the central pairing of Reinhardt’s Lizzie and Philip Orazio’s Mr. Darcy. The brisk clip of the production meant that Darcy very quickly softened towards Lizzie, removing something of the meanness of the two towards each other’s characters; instead, the production leaned into their mutual awkwardness around one another. Reinhardt’s gleeful, teasing Lizzie got most of her laughs through her exasperated and undignified passive resistance to the nonsense around her, whether splaying herself out on a couch or becoming so infuriated by Mr. Collins’s repeated refusals to acknowledge her rejection of him that she ended up appealing to the audience for some kind of support. Darcy, meanwhile, became more awkward as he fell ever more in love with her (a particularly sharp bit of comedy saw Darcy forget what he was meant to do with a stool when standing up and ended up with him twirling it about himself), making him more of a figure of ridicule for her. While the pair didn’t shy away from the key moments of expressed tension – especially during Darcy’s first, very tense proposal to her, he blurting it all out in a near-incomprehensible rush, and she then taking time to outline her hatred of him in clear, cold terms – the slow development of rapport and laughter felt like a natural progression of something more inevitable and organic, thus requiring them simply to get out of their own way.\n\nLizzie and Darcy’s slow-burn development of shared affection was balanced by the sweet and very funny immediate attraction of Jane (Summer England) and Bingley (Nicolas Eric Sanchez). The two were given a classic rom-com slowing down of time as they first encountered one another, and England’s dignified turn as Jane had her melt over Bingley’s undisguised attraction. Sanchez’s Bingley was hilarious, building on a single repeated joke – Bingley’s almost maniacally fixed smile as he delighted in everything – that developed fascinatingly as his happiness seemed to swell to almost greater proportions, but then became crushing as he was spirited away from Netherfield. By the time he returned at the latter end of the production, his smile was initially forced, with Darcy working hard at his shoulder to get the somewhat broken man to take action; once he had proposed and been accepted, though, he wandered in absolute delirium about the stage, having to be gently shepherded off in the right direction.\n\nPerhaps most important to this production, though, were the villains. With the Darcy/Lizzie relationship softened and some of the more serious aspects of the novel trimmed (the Lydia/Wickham elopement, in particular, was resolved quickly; Wickham himself only appeared in two scenes, I think, and thus registered as less significant here than in other versions), two characters became more prominent as the key obstacles. Joe Mucciolo channelled Indira Varma’s version of Caroline Bingley from Bride and Prejudice by making her a gloriously acidic enemy to both Jane and Lizzie (even the sympathetic descriptions of her apparent genuine affection for Jane in the novel had no place here). Taking over the stage every time she appeared, Caroline moved with poise and confidence – at least until unsettled by Darcy’s interest in Lizzie – and delighted in every passive aggressive put-down. She was only surpassed for terror by Fallon’s austere Lady Catherine de Burgh, accompanied by musical introduction every time she entered or left the stage. Fallon’s Lady Catherine was implacable, rigid, moving like a slow juggernaut around the stage and requiring everyone else to fall into place (even audience members were co-opted to bow to her). The beauty of the adaptation’s use of Caroline and Lady Catherine as absolute monsters was that it contained the most brutal moments of confrontation and unpleasantness within two characters who could make phenomenal impact with limited stage time; both of them made especially fine use of the convention of letter-writers appearing on the balcony to speak their words, doing so with a withering tone that brooked no reply.\n\nBut the true wild card here, Mick Jaggering his way through the action, was O’Reilly’s Mr. Collins. The antithesis of Kenn Hopkins, Jr.’s careful, restrained, and quietly amused take on Mr. Bennet (a stable and deliberately indifferent presence amid much of the chaos), this Collins was a barking, chaotic, oblivious presence. He moved and spoke quickly, but – in a show of great verbal skill on O’Reilly’s part – with his emphases all in the wrong place and gestures punctuating his words, making each delivery of an affected speech an attack of vocal and physical jabs on his interlocutors. O’Reilly’s Collins moved through the world with supreme confidence, clapping and roaring with laughter at his own appalling dancing, belligerently insulting his wife and cousins, and only very briefly being put out of sorts by being rejected by Lizzie. And yet, for all this Collins was a laughing stock, he also seemed – happy. And in this warm, romantic, and very funny Pride and Prejudice, everyone earned the right to, at the very least, get what they needed.\n\nEditing is one of those often thankless parts of cinema craft in which good work often effaces awareness of its own existence, while bad editing draws attention to itself. The editing of Argylle is cat-astrophic. This is a movie with a pretty decent conceit, some witty ideas, a commitment to representation of a different kind of body in a lead action role, and a stacked cast. But bizarre editing choices destroy the film’s pacing, tone, and plotting, leading to something that feels unintentionally too close to the pulpy, half-derived memories of its main character’s novels.\n\nThe film almost saves itself through conscious parody. In the opening sequence, Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena mug their way through an amusingly heightened Bond-esque reality of bike chases through Greece, sexy dances at gunpoint, and cliched plotting about conspiracies that go All The Way To The Top. This then segues into author Elly reading the end of her latest spy novel at a reading (in what world, by the way, does any author read the end of the book at a public event? Or are we meant to imagine that she has just read the entire book to this still-functioning audience?). The joke, I want to believe, is that the books are pretty trashy nonsense, rehashing the most hackneyed tropes to an audience that laps it up, and the Cavill sequences are deliberately bad. That may or may not be the intention.\n\nThe film shortly thereafter kicks into gear when Sam Rockwell’s raggedy Aidan Wilde turns up while Elly is on a train, declares himself to be a spy who’s been watching her for years, and helps her escape from a bunch of bad guys with guns. She has a cat who she loves who she carries with her in a backpack, and the film works hard to lighten the tone of the fight scenes with frequent cuts to the nonplussed animal. But everything around this plot is muted by the weird pacing. A long, long sequence shows every step Elly takes to get to her home computer, every sip of her drink she takes, every back and forth look between her and her cat. It’s atrociously slow and achingly dull, which may be a conscious choice to make Elly’s life look boring, but kills the storytelling. By contrast, as soon as Aidan starts fighting, the film inexplicably begins cutting between Aidan and the fictional Argylle, as Elly is overcome by hallucinations/coping mechanisms/flashbacks which come out of nowhere, which show no internal consistency (especially given the later revelations), and which interrupt Aidan’s performance just as he’s being introduced. The whole thing is a headache-inducing mess.\n\nThe film finally (again) gets going with the revelation that Elly’s books seem to be predicting real-life espionage events, and now both the bad guys and the good guys (whoever both sides may be) are out to get her because they believe that her fiction writing will help her find the missing MacGuffin. This is really where the film should have stuck, because the heightened reality here leads to some fun Stranger than Fiction/Bill & Ted/LEGO Movie vibes in which Elly begins almost literally writing the plot into existence, casting about for whatever silly-sounding thing comes to mind and then finding that it’s true. There’s something with so much potential here for satire and metacommentary as the real life spies are outclassed by someone with imaginative flair, and leaning into the distinction between Elly’s fantasy world (with Henry Cavill) might have been even more fun if Rockwell’s character was more in the Slow Horses mould.\n\nBut Argylle doesn’t want to tell one story, oh no; it thinks it’s far too clever for that. And so, we’re given twist after twist after twist, as first Elly’s parents are revealed to be bad guys, then it’s revealed (in a twist which the film thinks is so cool that it flagged it in the trailer) that Elly herself is Argylle, a former agent who lost her memories after a mission gone wrong, and who has been brainwashed by the bad guys – her novels are not fiction, but her writing the repressed memories of her last missions (I won’t even begin to get into the plot holes that mean her evil handlers then allow her to publish these books). Further twists include the revelation that Elly was actually a triple agent. And then by the post-credits scene, Vaughn is even trying to retcon the whole thing into being part of the Kingsman universe. And there’s a real Henry Cavill. I’m all for a ridiculous twist, but the film’s reluctance to let us sit with one version of a character for any length of time makes it very difficult to invest in anything that’s happening; it lets its own self-perceived cleverness get in the way of heart, and undermines that cleverness with the poor quality of editing and CGI.\n\nThere are definitely pleasures in the film. Bryce Dallas Howard is bigger than an actress is usually allowed to be when taking on an action lead, and it’s fun watching her grow into confidence as her spy abilities come back – though, on this note, Spy did such a better job of this and with far less shonky CGI. While most of the cast are badly underused (Samuel L. Jackson’s role largely involves him slapping his hands on a table happily while waiting for a file to download), Rockwell and Howard look like they’re having fun. The cat is sometimes cute. And the ideas of the film have so much potential; the Manchurian Candidate narrative layered onto the gender dynamics of a middle-aged woman imagining a more exciting life (again, see Spy, but with added coercion) is cool. But this is an Apple movie, and as with so many streaming originals with cinematic aspirations, the money has been spent in the wrong places, and it desperately needs a complete editing overhaul.\n\nSwiftly sidestepping the tension of the first two episodes, Beef pivots disturbingly in its third episode into the depths to which Amy and Danny will sink in pursuing their own needs. This feels like a necessary shift; while the direct and violent conflicts between the two will presumably continue to be part of the series, that’s limiting in its focus. By separating the two more in this episode (apart from a brief taunting text from Amy to Danny about her new security system), we get given much more sense of how they’re creating damage to themselves and to others – and that their actions towards each other are an extension of their own unhappiness.\n\nDanny has the cleanest arc in this episode as he goes to his friends’ church and, surprisingly, has what seems to be a sincere emotional moment. The depiction of an evangelical, community-oriented small church with a full praise band is spot-on, truly triggering for someone like me who used to play in that kind of band, and it’s depicted here with a savage and sharp eye for detail by screenwriter Carrie Kemper and the cast. The church is genuinely welcoming, full of nice people who have nothing but sympathy for Danny as he full-on ugly cries. Butt immediately leaping on his emotional moment, they’re getting him to sign forms to be on the church’s member list and welcoming him to the congregation. He sees a wonky sign and decides to fix it, and his friend Edwin thanks him gratefully for his free labor – before asking if it’s still a little bit crooked.\n\nThe church gives Danny something real but also immediately starts using that to control him, and Danny’s relationship with Isaac reminds him to see the manipulation going on – even as he sinks into the massage chair that Isaac buys for him and ignores the warning signs about Isaac signing the papers on their new business venture without him. And almost straightaway, Danny is beginning to use the church against them. He’s signing up for sports and the praise team, but he’s also – especially after being denied the mortgage necessary to purchase land for his aging parents – talking to them about putting together a loan request that purports to allow him to do pro bono work for the church, but is actually going to allow himself and Isaac to scam them.\n\nInterestingly, in his own moments of purposed self-awareness, Danny talks about just how nice he is, how he always does the right thing but it never works out for him. He’s dangerous – he’s a villain who doesn’t realise just how villainous he is, and his bitterness against a world that he sees himself as the victim of is leading him to victimise others. Does the church deserve to be ripped off? Maybe – there’s no love lost here in depicting the church as made up of a predatory niceness. But Danny isn’t living by any code, and he’s seemingly got no compunction about lying for his own benefit. And that’s what connects him to Amy, who is catfishing Danny’s brother Paul shamelessly.\n\nAmy is more ambiguous than Danny. She doesn’t have an emotional release in quite the same way as Danny in this episode, though she does seem to be genuinely sharing something real in her phone conversation with Paul, who is all niceness and empathy in his own simple way, even as he’s trying to flirt with her. Rather, Amy is committed in this episode to going through the correct motions. She signs up for couple’s therapy and sits there, smiling and nodding and putting together carefully chosen phrases, working her ass off to perform the therapy, even to win at it. Ali Wong’s performance is truly sublime as she subtly shows the frustration and tension while she performs a thirty-minute intimacy exercise with husband George or eats shit in front of the buyer of her new business, or praises her daughter’s art. She’s an actor, and she’s just about got the strength to put the performance together, but we’re allowed to see every bit of strain.\n\nHowever, as with Danny, all it takes is a little push or a reminder of how unfair the world seems to her to make Amy break bad again. Here, it’s George accidentally sending her the picture that he’s masturbating to that suddenly gives her permission to throw herself back into angry revenge fantasies, including upping her flirtation with Paul – which backfires at the end of the episode as Paul turns up at her place of work and she’s forced to confess, only for Paul to kiss her. Paul’s got issues, but he’s fundamentally a nice guy, or at least has the potential to be. At the episode’s start, Danny pulled away from an extreme act – torching Amy’s car – when he saw that her toddler was in it (sidenote: what was the toddler doing alone in the car??). Amy and Paul’s situation might not be as extreme, but Amy now has to decide whether she will allow a bystander to become collateral damage. And with her exit strategy from her career now being taken away from her by her new boss/buyer, she may cease caring.\n\nThe prestige stressful comedy has had a real resurgence in recent years, especially with Barry, The Bear, and now Beef doing so well in awards seasons. Perhaps this is particularly important to the post-COVID moment, in which lockdown brought out so many people’s pettiest instincts while also finding themselves cooped up past breaking point. Beef sits squarely at that breaking point, following two Asian American people who meet at a point when they have reached the limit of the amount of shit they can take and, in a reverse of the traditional romcom, seem to be on track to kill one another.\n\nAmy (Ali Wong) is a small business owner who has a History of some kind – a History which causes her pleasant-seeming husband to change the code for the gun safe. She’s trying to sell her business, which stresses her out, and she seems barely able to tolerate the white liberal women who tell her how much they love her whole “Zen” persona. Meanwhile, her talentless artist husband dines out on the legacy of his famous father while his mother snipes at her newly remodeled house. As such, when a car nearly rear-ends her in a car park, she slams on the horn and flips the other driver the bird.\n\nDanny (Steven Yeun) is trying to hold everything together. He’s billing himself as a “contractor” and trying to string together odd jobs for rich people. His parents’ marriage and career is struggling and he wants to provide for them; his younger brother is always gaming and gambling money on crypto; his cousin owes him $20k after tanking his parents’ motel business. He’s buying grill pans to try and poison himself with carbon monoxide, and barely hanging on. And so, when he’s reversing in a car park and another driver starts blaring their horn at him, he sees red. Danny chases the car through the streets, tearing up lawns, and eventually loses it – but gets the numberplate.\n\nThe pilot episode is a fabulous set-up. Danny’s life seems constantly on the brink of disaster, whether he’s falling out of a tree while trying to do a branch-cutting job he’s not qualified for, or almost getting into a fight with his ex-con cousin during an attempted reunion. Amy, meanwhile, is having to put on a constant facade of niceness and professionalism while people talk down to her or insert her into their own narratives of what it must be like to be an indie creator. Danny gets his release by turning on the grill pans and measuring CO; Amy breaks into the gun safe and rubs the gun over her body, quivering every time she clicks the trigger. They’re both on the edge, and both are about to snap.\n\nAnd so, the episode builds up to the moment when Danny, finally snapping, goes to seek out the driver of the car he’d had his beef with. When he finally arrives at Amy’s house, it looks like it might actually work out. The two bond over the pressures placed on them, over what it means to work so hard and not be appreciated, over the constant sense of any small victory being overturned and stolen away. The two need one another – they’re the only one who understand each other. But then Danny sees the car, realizes that the woman he’s talking to is the one he was fighting with, and asks to use the bathroom – and pisses all over it before running away.\n\nBeef is threatening real violence and nastiness – the early appearance of the gun is ominous – but in its pilot episode it manages to keep finding the levity. It’s middle fingers and piss on the floor, and the sight of both Wong and Yeun letting their facades slip to reveal something truly unhinged beneath is both funny and, in some ways, liberating in the face of all the politeness and complacency they encounter. But now both of them have one another’s number-plates and the stakes of the battle seem clear. Both still have a lot to lose, and both seem prepared to lose it having identified the one person who they can, apparently, express their truest self with. Buckle up.\n\nThat is, Mean Girls: The Movie: The Musical!: The Movie. One of the most bizarre things about the suddenly released 2024 Mean Girls is that the advertising has very much tried to conceal the fact that it’s a film adaptation of the stage musical, apparently causing outcry in some screenings. And yet – while I confess my memory of the 2004 film is hazy at best – this film feels like the real thing. It’s a perfect conceit for a musical, and Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr.’s screen adaptation is beautifully shot, retains the small scale and tight ensemble of a theatrical show, showcases some actual musical theatre talent (rather than trying to level up more famous non-singing, non-dancing actors), and marries it all to the visual inventiveness and hyper-reality that characterizes the best screen musicals.\n\nThe story remains familiar: lifelong homeschooler Katy finally joins an American high school, falls in with the “Plastics” – the titular mean girls, led by the monstrously glamorous Regina George – and is humiliated by Regina, who takes exception to Katy’s crush on her ex and takes him back for herself. But then, working with her outsider friends, Katy works to destroy Regina’s reputation – becoming, in doing so, the very thing she had set out to destroy. There are cliques and stereotypes, a climactic math contest, recurring actors from the original film, and every one of the original’s most famous moments (“October 3rd”) might as well be underlined and highlighted in pink. So much of the pleasure here is familiarity.\n\nAnd yet, it also feels new, partly because of the eclectic and entirely genre-appropriate music. The film begins with Katy’s friends Janis and Damian taking on a chorus function, narrating the film and presenting the whole thing as a kind of in-universe report on recent events, introducing a heightened and multiply framed reality. Katy herself, while still the lead, is sidelined somewhat, with the film eventually foregrounding Janis (both scathingly and winningly performed by a hard yet vulnerable Auliʻi Cravalho) as the film’s heart, especially as she sings ‘I’d Rather Be Me’ to give the film its moral, while Regina is hit by a bus in the background. The rest of the cast blast through power ballads, skater rock, full-blown pop, hip-hop, and much more, the musical styles emerging organically from the film’s characters.\n\nMuch has changed since 2004, and the updating of social media adds a fascinatingly superficial and yet compelling gloss to the whole. Not only does Megan Thee Stallion get to appear asking why this Regina George keeps coming up on her feed, but the film’s insistence on the mediation of reality through screens (as soon as the Plastics come on for their sexy Santa dance, hundreds of phones rise in unison), the construction of the girls online (Karen is a TikTok icon), and the fickleness of the social media environment all give the film’s story a sinister and hilarious new edge. And pleasingly, this is a much more diverse school in relation to sexuality, gender, and race, which means that the Plastics already look dated but also decentres some of the original’s more retrograde elements (though the fat-shaming remains in place, if muted).\n\nCrucially, the film works as both a musical and a comedy. The moments of meta self-awareness are the best (during the public apology session, one of the band members apologizes for accusing another of dragging during an earlier number, baffling the principal; at another moment, Tina Fey almost bursts into song before stopping herself), but when it’s sincere as a musical, it works beautifully. Having a cast of actual Broadway stars makes an enormous difference, especially with Reneé Rapp reprising her role from the stage show as Regina, and the songs are perfectly balanced to allow the vocals and jokes to come through. And even when they’re not singing, the performances are perfect; Karen’s description of Regina’s zit as a ‘face breast’ is unbeatable.\n\nThis version of Mean Girls, perhaps most importantly, is less mean. The joy and creativity of the songs – accompanied by back-up singing and dancing from the ensemble cast – mitigates much of the cruelty of the story and means that this school always feels like they’re working together even when they’re at one another’s throats. And for a story about mean girls learning life lessons, the musical form provides the perfect vehicle, with the outpourings of joy and catharsis accompanied by long tracking shots as people run through the school and celebrate surrounded by dance and laughter and silliness. The energy pours off the screen in a way so many film musicals fail to achieve. It’s great.\n\nIt was never going to be about the guns. For all that the entire penultimate episode of Fargo‘s fifth season set up a massive last-stand showdown between Roy Tillman’s self-appointed patriots and the forces of the federal government, Fargo is a show canny enough to know a full-fledged gunfight only risks seeming to create heroes and martyrs. Instead, the first half of Fargo‘s finale is procedural. There are arrests. There are ugly murders. A hostage turns the gun on her captor. And a good cop, Witt, goes off on his own misguided act of personal heroism to track down the bad guy, and gets himself killed. Poor Witt; you were too good for this world, but you also fell into the trap of thinking that this was a story about you.\n\nThe lack of glamour is important for a story which, ultimately, becomes about resisting the classic action movie staples of American entertainment. The bad guys getting gunned down and the good guys going back to the homestead ends up reifying precisely the narratives of justice and revenge that this series has done so much subtle work unpacking. And so – the bad guys do lose, but they don’t get the kind of loss they wanted. And the good guys do go back to the homestead, but their story isn’t finished.\n\nFargo‘s willingness to be pragmatic in its resolutions is important. Indira is wearing fancy clothes and is still in Lorraine’s employ; for all of the idealism of the police (as embodied by Witt), the private sector ended up being the right move for her, and she doesn’t appear to have sold her soul to do it. And none of us get the satisfaction of seeing Roy gunned down. Instead, the satisfaction comes from the uncomfortable reminder of the power of the mega-rich; Lorraine is not only in the Federalist Society who effectively pick the future judges, but she also has enough money to pay every single prisoner in Roy’s facility to make his (long) life a living hell. She gives him cigarettes, implying that he will spend the rest of his life being raped, beaten, and made to fear. “I want you to feel everything your wives felt”. And while this is as close as the series gets to indulging in revenge fantasy, the important thing here is that even Roy can’t hide his fear. The real America, in all its ugliness, is facing him across the table, and it’s beaten his vision hands down.\n\nOthers are left at the wayside. Gator, blinded and childlike, is kinda forgiven, but will live forever without his sight. Karen is left cowering in the wreckage of her life; her father has his throat cut after one insult too many to his son-in-law. Shockingly, the comedy FBI officers stay alive. Justice is messy; the fallout of Roy’s actions is impossible to track entirely, and his victims will continue to suffer in their own way. But the focus is on the Lyonses, as Dot, a pretty much entirely recovered Wayne, and Scottie resume their lives, remembering Witt even a year on, and falling back into their quiet suburban life, running their car dealership together. Until Munch returns.\n\nFor all that season five has been filled with outstanding performances, Sam Spruell’s Ole Much has been a slow burn of gravitas, comedy, and the mythic, and devoting the final half of the final episode to a coda centered on him is a smart move. He arrives at the Lyons household seeking payment of the debt – flesh in return for the ear which Dorothy took from him while defending herself. Munch embodies the central theme of this whole season; he is the centuries-old embodiment of the Walking Debt, the executor of absolute Old Testament justice. He is implacable, inevitable, the consequence of an ethos which insists that debt must, must, must be paid. There is no option otherwise, and a showdown has to happen. But, as Dot points out, we’re halfway to dinner and there are biscuits to make – and he either has to roll up his sleeves and help, or do this another time.\n\nThe final twenty minutes of this episode are a masterclass in tension and bathos, as Munch’s gravelly, mythos-laden explanation of his past and his pronouncements of commandments are undercut by Wayne offering him a soda (“A man is . . . grateful”), by Scottie telling Munch to wash his hands, by Dot explaining recipes. At times, the frustration on Munch’s face is unbearable – he leans in to try and explain why he has to fight Dot, and he is effectively ignored, swept along in the niceness of the family. And every now and again, Dot drops the quotidian to engage directly with him. “Why” she asks. Why does debt need to be paid. The insistence of the payment of debt, regardless of people’s ability to pay it, is perhaps the single greatest evil in society. What happens if we, instead, choose to forgive debt? It’s reductive to treat this within a purely Christian theology, but Dot is the New Testament to Munch’s Old, and over biscuits, Dot offers Munch a complete reversal of his existential purpose, one to which he has no answer other than repeatedly asserting the same adages, clinging to them in exactly the same way that Roy’s Republicans cling to their Constitution in the face of change. And eventually Munch yields. He takes a biscuit, he chews on it, and his face breaks into a smile, on which the season ends. Fargo has finally replaced its own model of violence and comeuppance with grace, kindness, and even joy. And it’s beautiful.\n\nAmerican Fiction is a self-consciously reductive film about self-consciously reductive art. It’s both dumb and clever, and in insisting on the ability of writing dumb things as a deliberate act of cleverness, it also (cleverly) manages to forestall any criticism of itself. Did that representation of contemporary publishing logistics feel broad-brush? DELIBERATE! Are these conveniently polarized book judges and creative writing professors a simplification? INTENTIONAL! Does the film indulge far too much in schmaltz and convenient narrative twists? THAT’S THE POINT!\n\nAs such, American Fiction is deeply enjoyable, but sometimes a frustrating experience, as it is definitely a film which has not fully thought out all of its scenarios and implications, but can get away with it because the satire is so broad. Comparisons to Sorry To Bother You are perhaps inevitable, but Boots Riley’s film is so much more satisfying precisely because of the depth and complexity of its imagined world, whereas Cord Jefferson’s debut pulls its punches and keeps things everyday. One brilliant sequence when author Monk Ellison is writing his hilariously horrific pastiche of “Black fiction” sees his characters come to life in his study and ask for notes on their performances; one wishes this had been a more consistent device, not only because it’s funny and surreal, but because it dares to actually name and show the stereotypes in play, rather than keep alluding to them.\n\nThe premise of the film is great. Monk is a frustrated novelist who writes versions of classic Greek myths, but is struggling to receive more mainstream recognition because the publishing industry want him to write more stereotypically “Black” material. Following the sudden death of his sister and facing massive medical expenses for his mother, newly diagnosed with Alzheimers, an aggrieved Monk eventually drinks a lot of liquor and pens a book, My Pafology (later retitled simply Fuck), which is a checklist of every Black stereotype he can think of. Sending it to publishers as a joke, he and his agent are shocked when the book suddenly becomes the hit of the summer.\n\nThe surreal situation gives way to some fascinating debates about Black art, responsibility, representation of and in the community, and the right to make money from white people’s guilt. These conversations – especially between Monk and a younger educated Black author who has written exactly this kind of book – are where the film is at its best and also at its most accountable. The film doesn’t commit as fully to the complexity of these debates as it might; Issa Rae’s novelist character, for instance, turns out to be a sophisticated voice of nuance despite being set up as the problem Monk is fighting, but it still remains ambiguous what exactly her deal is, and the positions she sets up about what stereotypes get perpetuated within the community and what it means for particular kinds of real experience to become representative of the whole feel unfinished. But this is also where the film feels most like it matters.\n\nInstead, the film devotes more of its time to Monk’s own melodrama, and this is where the film itself appears to be trying to be subversive. Monk’s own life is, itself, a tapestry of different kinds of stereotype – it’s effectively a Hallmark or Tyler Perry movie. He has a drug-taking, newly out little brother; a dad who died by suicide; a purse-lipped mother grappling with illness and knowledge of her husband’s affairs; a bubbly maid who falls in love with the veteran local security officer; an improbably beautiful neighbour who’s just going through a break-up and fancies him, etc. There are weddings, funerals, family reconciliations, money troubles. It’s all very sweet and quite rote. But it also feels like that’s the point. American Fiction is already a darling of awards ceremonies, and it feels apt that a film about a Black author being celebrated by the white literary community for doing stereotypical things is also being celebrated by the white film community for doing stereotypical things – only this time about the middle-class Black experience. The film appears be enjoying and courting its own joke. But it does come at the expense of being braver about its own overt addressing of the issues it raises.\n\nOf course, it’s really a film about Hollywood rather than about the literary community, and the film’s final twist – that it isn’t actually a finished film, but is itself the attempt of Monk to write a screenplay based on his own life that he’s still trying to fit to a Hollywood standard – feels apt, while also allowing the film its own get-out-of-jail free card of multiple endings and no resolution. But even if it’s sometimes unsatisfying, this is a film which is at least beginning the important question about white guilt in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter, and the ways in which Black experience continues to be mediated and sold on white terms. One hopes that the importance of this film survives its moment.\n\nThe ironic twists and turns of ‘ronny/lily’ see Barry fully embrace its most absurdist impulses. Barry has, throughout the series so far, repeatedly resisted the idea of killing, even when killing is by far the easiest, cleanest, and probably least harmful (at least in terms of knock-on consequences) choice. But at the end of the previous episode, he was offered the opportunity by Detective John Loach to have his crimes buried, if only Barry will carry out a hit on the guy, Ronny, who is in a relationship with Loach’s ex-wife. And at the start of ‘ronny/lily’, Barry has agreed to that offer – with drastic and immediate fallout.\n\nBacking up to Loach’s offer, there’s something important going on in Barry about the state of America. This is a country which makes noises about people making the right choices, but which fundamentally doesn’t actually want people to step outside of their lane. The state needs people like Barry, both to do the things it pretends it doesn’t need, and to act as scapegoats for the evils that pervade society. The sight of a federal agent tracking down a serial killer, ostensibly in vengeance for killing his partner, only to offer him a job, is bleakly funny and scarily on the nose. And Barry knows this, knows that – for all he is pursuing free choice – his path is already laid out for him.\n\nThe episode begins with Ronny arriving home, smoking a joint and wandering around his house, and a masked Barry coming up behind him and trying to gently persuade him to flee to Chicago, to escape his own murder. Barry has still not learned that, in putting on the mask and taking a weapon into a mark’s house, he’s already made his choice; in his head, he still thinks he is giving people a kind and fair option. But it immediately becomes clear – as Barry clocks the entire room full of Tae Kwon Do trophies – that this is not going to be that straightforward, and sure enough, a brutal fight – much of it shot in a single take – breaks out.\n\nBarry is, of course, always going to get the upper hand. He’s nowhere near the level of martial artist that Ronny is, but not only is Ronny out of shape – he’s high, he’s older, he’s wheezing – but he’s also a sportsman, whereas Barry is a killer. Barry’s issue is that he’s not committed. He’s trying to fight but not to kill, he’s trying to do bad things but minimize them. And while he beats Ronny, the real battle is the one that breaks out when Ronny’s daughter Lily arrives home. Lily runs to find her dad and then, when Barry next sees her, she’s decked out in her own Tae Kwon Do gear, snarling like a feral dog, and jumping on him possessed with knives, throwing weapons, and teeth. By the time Lily has scarpered over the neighbouring fences, Barry has several knife wounds and needs Fuches to take him to a hospital – but Fuches will only insist that they have to go and kill the girl.\n\nThis episode is delirious in all kinds of ways. As Barry bleeds out in the car, he keeps having haunting visions of soldiers crossing a desert, reuniting with loved ones, while he only meets Fuches. Lily, meanwhile, is barely human. Through wire-work and special effects, as well as a frankly terrifying performance by Jessie Giacomazzi, her near-supernatural fighting prowess becomes an out-of-body experience for Barry and Fuches, who spend as much time going ‘What the FUCK?!’ as they do actually dealing with the situation. The reappearance of the presumed-dead Ronny with a Terminator-like determination towards the episode’s end, and the sudden execution of both Ronny and Loach – thus getting Barry out of trouble, at the cost of more lives – makes it feel like anything’s possible. And the sheer escalation of disasters (such as Fuches trying to superglue Barry’s knife wound closed, then gluing himself to the car steering wheel) keeps things bizarre and tense.\n\nThe episode ends with an achingly long pause as Barry, finally getting out of the murder scene, sees Fuches waiting for him in the car, reminding him of the dream of meeting Fuches at the return from war. Fuches is screaming at him to get in, but Barry isn’t moving. Throughout the episode, Barry has repeatedly pleaded with Fuches to take him to hospital because, well, he’s dying – and Fuches has repeatedly ignored him, botched the medical care, and instructed him to kill a child. For all that Barry has confronted impossible fighters and seemingly inhuman opponents in this episode, the monster is the one waiting for him in the car – the monster that creates the Barry who Barry is trying to run away from. But is there any way out other than with Fuches? For all that the title character is trying to rewrite his story, Fuches represents the America that isn’t ready to allow that."
