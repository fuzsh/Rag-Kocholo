        "text": "1/17/22: For everyone asking for a full list, this is every single occurrence in the show. I didn’t miss any scenes so use this it’s 100% accurate. Btw these time stamps are for HBO max, it could be slightly different on another viewing service. SEASON ONE: Episode one: when rue says, there are a few ways to pass a drug test, then talks about the chemical that will flush your system then says there are a few side effects, she lists them and includes nausea and v*ing but that’s just a mention. Then later rue is on the toilet taking a drug test: rue says “can we not do this right now mom” and then you see Gia walking (flashback) and she opens a door to see rue on the floor and there is v on her face. Starts 20:41 ends 20:53. Only visual and no actual throwing up. Episode two: after rue says “I know you’re not allowed to say it but drugs are kinda cool. That is until they wreck your…” then you see the same scene of rue with the v on her face. Starts 11:47. Ends 12:18. Only visual, same as last time. Also in ep 2, kat is walking in the hallway then she enters the bathroom. Then she enters a stall and throws up. Starts 28:32. Ends: 28:39. No visual at all, just audio. mute when you see her enter the bathroom. Episode 3: 100% safe. Episode 4: during the beginning-ish, man runs out of carnival ride and throws up in a trash can. No visual except for him bent over trash can but there is audio. Right after Nate walks back to the chili booth and cal says “if you ask me she’s a distraction” Starts 15:37 ends 15:45. Episode 5: cal is walking through the school hallway and enters the bathroom and throws up. Starts 11:57 ends 12:05. No visual, just audio but it does show his head bent over toilet from behind. Episode 6: in the very beginning, the child actor version of McKay throws up while practicing football. Happens somewhere between 1:05 and 3:20. I’m not going to watch it to find the exact time stamp. Nothing you see in that time interval is important anyways, just know that his father put a lot of pressure on him. Slight audio and full visual, although not very up close and detailed. You see it happen. Most triggering tu scene of season 1 I would say. Episode 7: 100% safe. Episode 8: after jules enters the bathroom, there is a birds eye view over all the toilet stalls. In one stall, you see a girls head bent over a toilet and you hear it. Starts 17:35 ends 17:41. No visual except head bent over toilet but there is audio so mute it. SEASON TWO: Episode one: 100% safe. Episode two: 100% safe. Episode three: 100% safe. Episode four: NOT SAFE. The worst scene yet by far. Audio and visual and you see the aftermath. And they slightly talk about it immediately after. Starts at exactly 41:41 and ends at 42:25. It happens in the hot tub while maddy and Nate are arguing and it is immediately after maddy says “have my babies”. Episode five: Rue dry heaves once while on a street corner at 31:21 with no warning, right after she runs out of the couples house from their front door. The time stamps are wonky so use these descriptions. Then very soon after, a policeman asks her where she’s headed and she gags, and then he says “what was that” and she says “I’m actually headed-“ then throws up. Audio and visual. It lasts <10 seconds. Then at like 36:43 (five minutes after the first throw up scene) after rue climbs out of a garbage can and jumps a fence and falls on the ground, mute it bc she dry heaves (no tu but it was triggering to me). Then later when she’s at the kitchen table with Laurie, rue says “I think I’m gonna be sick” then mute it and the captions will say *vomiting* and then *vomiting continues* and then it’s safe. Bad audio but no visual. Episode 6: 100% safe. Episode 7: 100% safe. Episode 8: 100% safe. Overall this show is still worth it to watch even with emetophobia.\n\nFULL COMPREHENSIVE LIST:\n\nSeason 1: Safe\n\nSeason 2:\n\nS2 Episode 12: About 2 minutes and 30 seconds in, people watch Dwight from a window crash his car into a pole. he gets out, wobbles around, then graphically v*s on his car.\n\nS 2 Episode 11: The company is on a Booze Cruise and at around 17:00, michael feels seas*ck and pulls out a bag and v*s. No visual except him bent over with his face in the bag and it lasts about 5 or 6 seconds.\n\nSeason 4\n\nS4, Episode 1: Isn't safe. after Michael finished the run, he says (in voice over) “i eventually p* my guts out” and then pretty much immediately he bends over and v*, visual, no audio. wait til Meredith starts talking again (i think she just says “hey Michael”) because he has it on his mouth until then.\n\nSeason 6;\n\nS6, Episode 4 Niagara part 1\n\nDue to Pam’s pregnancy she sensitive to foods. And at about 1:20 almost everyone in the office v* in a chain reaction up until the theme. So it’s preferable to skip cause it does show the v*. Safe once the opening credits/theme song starts.\n\nS6 Episode 10\n\nThere is a short v* scene in the beginning around 4:20 where Michael learns that the company may be going bankrupt. It is behind a closed door and only quiet sounds. Didn’t find it super triggering, but someone else might.\n\nSeason 7\n\n“Viewing Party”\n\nFrom 14:45 to 15:30, Andy acts like he's about to be sick and from 17:05 to 17:20, he is sick, somewhat graphically. At 21:00 in that same episode, he is seen leaning over a toilet.\n\nThis happens right after Dwight is getting fed pepperoni and Kevin says his pigs in a blanket line.\n\nS7 episode 14\n\nKevin g* and v*. I believe the rest of the episode is fine, but I found that one scene more triggering than a lot of other scenes involving v* in other shows. The sound is pretty graphic (I don’t believe there’s much visual stuff besides him holding a trash can, but I don’t remember for sure). I don’t know exactly where it is in the episode, but just know that when you get to the scene where Kevin starts running, you should skip to the next scene (I think this scene lasts about 1-2 minutes).\n\nS7 Episode 21\n\nEpisode is safe, however v* is implied. At around 9:50 after they introduce Diangelo, he starts looking pale and sweaty and he runs to the bathroom. Then seconds later Michael walks in and you can hear Diangelo groaning and leaning over a toilet, but nothing is actually shown. Then around 16 min he mentions it saying “I was in the bathroom v* and v*..“\n\nSeason 8\n\nS8, Episode 16\n\nAt around 15 minutes in, Packer is dancing and runs over to Gabe and V*s. It’s over very quick, with slight sound and full visual. If you want to avoid it, mute and tab out when you see him dancing and leave it for about 10 seconds.\n\nS8 Episode 23\n\nIn the beginning around 3:30 in, everyone in the office is arguing and Robert California puts up his finger and shushes everyone, and proceeds to v* into a trash can. No visual (only him bending over) but there are sounds that can be triggering, and it lasts about 10 seconds.\n\nSeason 9\n\nS9 Episode 1\n\nIn this episode, at the beginning, all of the members of the office are talking about what they did over the summer. Dwight says he made a new sports drink made of beets. In the next scene, it shows Angela and Dwight in a hospital (for a completely unrelated reason, which makes this unexpected) and after getting some news from a doctor, Dwight v*s the bright blue drink all over Angela. Just fast forward past the doctors office, and it ends when Kevin starts talking.\n\nFrom Tumblr\n\nALL Breaking Bad warnings\n\na masterpost of masterposts! what a concept!\n\nBEWARE OF SPOILERS\n\nBreaking Bad: Season 1 Warnings\n\nit should first be said that this show is not for people who are bothered by really violent or disturbing content. however, there’s not too much v* so it’s easy to avoid if that’s all you’re worried about!\n\npossible spoilers ahead~\n\nepisode 1-\n\nwalter coughs throughout. at the beginning, after coming out of the trailer, the coughing is particularly intense. this may be triggering.\n\ntowards the end, after telling jesse what happened in the trailer, walter bends over and v*s violently. you can’t see it, but you see him bending over and you hear it very clearly for quite a few seconds\n\nepisodes 2 through 5 are safe aside from coughing (and subject matter that involves really gruesome images and such)\n\nepisode 6-\n\nwhen walter is teaching toward the beginning, he tells them to work on their stuff alone and then leaves the room to v*. I tabbed out and took my earphones out, but I think it’s shown a bit and heard quite violently.\n\nafter walt’s second chemo scene, about 19 minutes in, he is paying with a check and goes to the bathroom to v*. I think it’s pretty much just like the last one\n\nepisode 7 is safe\n\nBreaking Bad: Season 2 Warnings\n\njust like I said last time- a very intense and often gory show. possible spoilers ahead.\n\nEpisodes 1 through 4 are safe. There’s always coughing of course, but the only notably triggering moment is in episode 4 when jesse makes it back inside the trailer and begins coughing intensely. It seems as if he’ll v* but he doesn’t.\n\nToward the beginning of episode 5, about 7 minutes in when Walt gets out of bed to count the money, he goes to the bathroom and gets sick. The toilet clogs and he spends a little bit cleaning up, so the scene ends up being about a minute and a half. Just tab out and take our your earphones/mute it.\n\nEpisode 8 is safe, minus the usual coughing. Also, Hank has a couple panic attacks in this episode, which might seem like he’s going to throw up, but he doesn’t.\n\nEpisode 9 is technically safe, but at the beginning Walt leaves the waiting room and has a particularly bad coughing spell in the bathroom. He is coughing violently and leaning somewhat over the toilet, but he doesn’t v*. It still may be triggering.\n\nIn Episode 10, around 15 minutes in, Walt Jr. is sick into the pool. He starts to cough after taking a drink at about 14 minutes. I stopped watching/listening so I don’t really know how much is shown, but a previous anon said it’s pretty graphic. I would honestly skip that whole scene where they’re outside drinking. Stop watching when Walt pours out Walt Jr.’s ice. The scene ends at 16 minutes.\n\nEpisode 11 is safe.\n\nEpisode 12 is safe up until the end. When Walt goes into Jesse’s apartment, Jane ends up v*ing quite a bit. I didn’t watch because I knew something was coming, but it sounds horrible because she's choking. You should probably just skip the entire scene. It’s the last scene of the episode.\n\nEpisode 13 is safe.\n\nBreaking Bad: Season 3 Warnings\n\nsame disclaimer for violence and intensity as the previous seasons\n\nEpisodes 1 through 4 are safe.\n\nIn episode 5, about 3 minutes in, Jesse is leaving the strip club with his friends, and Skinny v*s outside as he’s walking away. As soon as you see they’re leaving the club, tab out and mute.\n\nEpisodes 6 through 13 are safe.\n\nBreaking Bad: Season 4 Warnings\n\nviolence and intensity, spoilers, etc etc you know the deal~\n\nEpisode 1 is technically safe, but there is a VERY gruesome death towards the end. I usually don’t mention these, but since I’m hardly bothered by gore and this one affected me, I thought it was worth mentioning. Also, witnessing it causes Walter to look like he’s going to be sick.\n\nEpisodes 2 through 9 are safe.\n\nWhen Gus goes to the bathroom in episode 10, he sets a towel down in front of the toilet and makes himself v*. It’s obvious it’s coming because he kneels in front of the toilet and sticks his two fingers toward his mouth. I’m not sure if you see v* but you see him leaning over and hear the sounds.\n\nEpisodes 11 through 13 are safe.\n\nBreaking Bad: Season 5 warnings\n\nEpisodes 1 through 8 are safe.\n\nIn episode 9, when the Whites are eating dinner, around 33 minutes in, Walt runs to the bathroom and leans over the toilet. I honestly don’t know if he v*s at first because I saw it coming on the little netflix preview screen, and when the scene came I tabbed out and listened to it at a low volume. It doesn’t sound like he v*s but I know he turns the water on. However, after he notices his book is gone, he makes a gagging sound and leans over. Nothing is shown.\n\nEpisodes 10 through 16 are safe.\n\nFrom Tumblr:\n\nGame of Thrones Season 1 - 6 Warnings (NOT SPOILER FREE)\n\nThis is a complete list of all v* scenes in Game of Thrones from season 1 through season 6. I watched the show on HBONow, so all the times will correspond to that. If you watch on other sites, I believe the scenes are two minutes earlier but I am not sure.\n\nThis list is not completely spoiler free, but I did my best to be vague about plot events. The scenes are not very central to the plot.\n\nEvery scene has video and audio, and to be completely safe you should mute and look away!\n\nSeason 1 Episode 6 (15:50 - 23:15)\n\nDaenerys is going through a ritual to make sure the baby is strong, and she has to eat a horse heart. Technically not v* but it’s gross and she gags a few times. She names the baby Rhaego and the Dothraki start whooping. Even if you are very sensitive, you will probably be ok, but better safe than sorry. :)\n\nSeason 2 Episode 1 (5:20 - 6:30)\n\nA knight shows up drunk, and Joffrey sentences him to drink an entire barrel of wine. Eventually Sansa gets Joffrey to stop, and the man’s life is saved. It’s a long, graphic scene. After 6:30 it is completely safe to keep watching.\n\nSeason 2 Episode 9 (4:05 - 4:30)\n\nWhile on the ship, it goes down a line of people and someone gets seasick. It takes a few seconds to get to it, so it’s best to just skip ahead. The scene is not central to the plot.\n\nSeason 3 Episode 1 (36:30 - 37:00)\n\nDaenerys and Jorah are talking, and one of the Dothraki gets sick. It was very triggering for me. When Jorah mentions the Iron Throne, that is when you should skip ahead. The conversation will continue with no more incidents.\n\nSeason 3 Episode 4 (3:00 - 3:30)\n\nJaime Lannister collapses, and asks for water. Someone hands him a flask and he drinks it, then they tell him it’s actually horsepiss. He v* and they all laugh. It’s a short scene, and not central to the plot.\n\nSeason 4 Episode 2 (49:10 - end)\n\nUnfortunately, this scene is very central to the plot and also very triggering. I am not going to say spoilers, unfortunately. When Joffrey coughs after drinking, the triggering part starts.\n\nSeason 5 Episode 1 (15:00 - 15:48)\n\nTyrion is talking to Varys and he is drinking. When he says, ‘The future is shit.’ It is about to happen. He v* and then continues drinking. Then the scene changes.\n\nSeason 5 Episode 8 (54:47 - 55:00)\n\nWhile in battle, Jon will be dragging himself away from a burning building. He will collapse, it will cut away, and at 54:50 exactly it will cut back to him spitting out blood. You only need to look away for 3 seconds. I found this scene mildly triggering, but others might not.\n\nSeason 6 Episode 3 (12:08 - 15:38)\n\nSam and Gilly are on a ship and Sam tells her he’s taking her to his home where he grew up. He’s v* because he’s seasick. He v* multiple times as well. I did not watch any of this scene and I was not confused later in the show.\n\nSeason 6 Episode 5 (28:50 - 29:30)\n\nThey will lie him on the shore. When it goes quiet, mute and look away for about 30 seconds. He wakes, v*, and is king. If he is standing when you look back, he will not v* again. He will cough a bit, but the scene will be safe.\n\nHappy watching! :-)"
