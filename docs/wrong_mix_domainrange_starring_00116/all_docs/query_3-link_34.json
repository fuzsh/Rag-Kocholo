        "text": "Barry actor Anthony Carrigan said his alopecia has improved his acting capabilities.\n\nThe 39-year-old actor stars as NoHo Hank in HBO’s Bill Hader-led hitman comedy.\n\nRecently speaking to Page Six, Carrigan shared that he started losing a majority of his hair in his twenties. And eventually, he had to wear a hairpiece and false eyelashes for his role in the 2009 one-season series, The Forgotten.\n\nAlopecia is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the immune system attacks hair follicles, causing sudden hair loss.\n\nHe recalled afterwards being told by a “number of people” that he would no longer be able to book acting jobs due to his hair loss.\n\n“I was told that I wasn’t attractive anymore,” the actor remembered. “I was told that I wasn’t going to book roles. It was something that I was so terrified of hearing from a young age.”\n\nHowever, he said it was others’ negativity that in fact pushed him to chase roles he really wanted.\n\n“It gave me the passion and lit a fire to prove them wrong,” he added. “And essentially, that’s what I’ve been doing.”\n\nCarrigan believes his alopecia provides him with a “uniqueness” that he can lean into, making him a better actor.\n\n“I feel like these days everyone is trying to conform in some way and I feel like what makes people special?” he said. “That’s where the interesting stuff comes from. That’s where pretty interesting performances come from.”"
