What's up?\n\nIt was a while before they, I was cast in it\n\nI think I had a few months and I was just\n\non the phone every few days with my agents going\n\nhave you heard anything? Have you heard anything?\n\nWhich is not normally the way that I am,\n\nbut I was with that.\n\nWe met before we started filming to rehearse,\n\nimprovise some scenes or just kind of riff off of\n\nwhat was in the script.\n\nI had had experience with improvisation,\n\nbut never on a big studio movie.\n\nI mean, I was pleasantly surprised when we started shooting,\n\nand then Will might just go off in some direction\n\nthat I'm not prepared for,\n\nor McKay would be behind the monitor yelling out lines.\n\nYou know, he and Will had worked together obviously on SNL,\n\nand they had a way of doing things,\n\nand Judd Apatow was a producer on it\n\nand Judd had a way of kind of working in this style.\n\nSo we would always do what was in script,\n\nbut then we'd start kind of messing around.\n\nIt was a whole new way of working on a big budget movie,\n\nand it was thrilling.\n\nThere are so many times in Anchorman and scenes\n\nthat I have such clear memories of laughing.\n\nI didn't expect Will when he said,\n\nI'm proud of you fellas.\n\nYou all kept your head on a swivel,\n\nand that's what you gotta do\n\nwhen you find yourself in a vicious cockfight.\n\nThat's not in the script or anything,\n\nand I was like, took me by surprise.\n\nYou don't wanna laugh when you're in someone's take\n\nbecause you don't wanna make something unusable.\n\nAnd if it's really funny and then somebody laughs,\n\nand you can't use it's really annoying,\n\nand so there's always a pressure not to laugh.\n\nThat being said,\n\nI think this scene that we laughed the hardest,\n\nit was the first time I think even the crew\n\nwas getting a little annoyed\n\n'cause we just couldn't get through it.\n\nWhich was the scene of all of us sitting around a table,\n\nplotting how we were going to take down\n\nVeronica Corningstone and Will is asking\n\nBrick what he's eating and Brick says,\n\nOh, it's one of those delicious falafel hotdogs\n\nwith cinnamon and bacon on top.\n\nWhat do you mean one of those?\n\nThose don't exist.\n\nThat's a used coffee filter with cigarette butts on it.\n\nAnd I remember looking at it and it was coffee grounds,\n\nbut it was like chocolate cake, but it looked like coffee,\n\na real coffee filter, like a cigarette butt,\n\na wrapper and then a dime.\n\nAnd every time Carrell would take a bite of it,\n\nit was so repulsive, we'd all start laughing,\n\nwe'd have to do it again\n\nand then the buildup became funny\n\nbecause Will would then say,\n\nBy the way Brick, what is that you're eating?\n\nAnd as soon as you just go by the way Brick,\n\nhe didn't even get out, what are you eating?\n\n[laughing]\n\nIt was the pause and then noticing,\n\nand then we'd all just start laughing.\n\n[upbeat music playing]\n\nThe 40 Year-Old Virgin.\n\nYou know, and like you grab a woman's breast,\n\nand it's, and you feel it and it feels like\n\na bag of sand when you're touching it.\n\nBag of sand?\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nWhy don't we just play?\n\nWhy don't you just deal the cards?\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nSteve had this sketch that he had done at Second City\n\nthat he'd written about a 40 Year-Old Virgin.\n\nActually the sketch was,\n\nit was kind of recreated in that poker scene,\n\nbut it's a bunch of guys that are sitting around\n\nkind of telling tales outta school about how, you know,\n\nwomen, they've been with things they've done\n\nand one guy who's like, oh yeah,\n\nand it becomes clear that he's\n\nnever ever been with a woman.\n\nYou know, and that turned into the movie.\n\nYou're a virgin.\n\nI am, shut up.\n\nHow does that happen?\n\nHaving now worked with Judd a few times,\n\nwe'd spent a lot of time before adding things to the script,\n\nfilming improvisations that would eventually\n\nmake their way into the script.\n\nYou know, by the time you start shooting\n\none of those movies,\n\nyou have a 200 and some odd page script.\n\nWhen it came time to actually film,\n\nsometimes we would take it upon ourselves\n\nto start improvising.\n\nHey, did you ever see School of Rock?\n\n[Andy] Yeah.\n\nWell this is, it's called School of, you know.\n\nOh, that's nice.\n\nJudd would say, all right, do more of that.\n\nKeep, go back and say that.\n\nHe'll yell out lines and we'll be in the middle of the scene\n\nand we just repeat what he says,\n\nor maybe another writer will say something,\n\nand they become these kind of collaborative\n\nkind of jam sessions really.\n\nAnd when something really cooks,\n\nlike when it's really, when it's working, you can tell,\n\nand it's thrilling because nobody, including us,\n\nlike knows exactly what it is we're gonna say\n\nor what's gonna happen or where it's gonna go.\n\nTo hopefully find a few moments here and there\n\nbecause there's a lot of, you know,\n\nmost of it you'll never use and you wouldn't want to use it.\n\nCool, just the one right here, right?\n\nHi, how are you?\n\nSo this is your first time getting body wax?\n\nWhen Steve was getting waxed in that scene, he really was.\n\n[foreign language speaking]\n\n[Andy screaming]\n\nThe girl who actually did it said that\n\nher family owned a salon, she did this,\n\nand I was like, I don't think that was true.\n\nI don't think she'd ever done it.\n\nLike one of those things where it's like an actor,\n\nhire an actor, he's like, can you ride a horse?\n\nI can ride a horse.\n\nCan you wax it chest?\n\nI can totally wax a chest.\n\nThat one hurt.\n\nThat one hurt just as much as the first one.\n\nThat's great man.\n\n[Steve] Man!\n\nYou know, we were playing into it obviously.\n\nI don't know if that's, if it's true that\n\nRomany really did get queasy and wanted to leave,\n\nbut I mean it really was\n\nlike, you could tell it was painful.\n\nWe set up like five cameras\n\n'cause once you know you did it,\n\nyou weren't gonna get to go back and do it again.\n\nYeah, Steve's hilarious.\n\nAnd he knew how to scream and make it funny and\n\nyou're coming up with jokes on the fly too.\n\nI mean, I think just a pattern in which he was waxed.\n\nIt's like he did look like a pumpkin.\n\nSo then it's like, you look like a man-o-lantern.\n\nThis is not a good look for me.\n\nYou look like a man-o-lantern.\n\nThank you very much, appreciate it.\n\nThere's always this kind of\n\nsomebody with a pen off to the side writing things\n\nor sometimes you don't want it to say what you're gonna say\n\nand you don't tell anybody.\n\nIf it works, it works, and if it doesn't, it doesn't.\n\n[upbeat music playing]\n\nI Love You Man.\n\nI'm glad you called.\n\nYou get home safe, Pistol.\n\nYou got it, Jovin.\n\nI'm sorry, what?\n\nI first worked with Jason on Knocked Up,\n\nand I knew Jason also because\n\nhe'd worked with Judd way before me,\n\nand this way of working,\n\nI think we found that we enjoyed\n\nworking with each other in that way.\n\nJohn Hamburg had written the script,\n\nand I remember thinking, this premise is brilliant.\n\nI can't believe this hasn't been done.\n\nIt was just like a buddy film,\n\nbut it's really kind of in the structure of romantic comedy.\n\nJohn met with both Jason and I at the same time.\n\nLike, yeah, let's do this.\n\nThis is, this would be really, I think it would be a blast.\n\nIt was so much fun doing that movie,\n\nand there was such a joyous feel on it.\n\nI think because Jason and I like started,\n\nwe could complete each other's sentences\n\nand as far as any kind of joke\n\nor any kind of dumb little thing\n\nthat someone might think of,\n\nthe other guy wouldn't bat an eye\n\nand take it and go with it in some other direction.\n\nYou're wearing a tuxedo, think James Bond, all right?\n\nGimme, gimme some James Bond.\n\nNo, it just looks like you're pointing at me.\n\nI think we just really love\n\nthe characters we were playing.\n\nI loved playing that character.\n\nAwkward, insecure, just all of that stuff\n\nis really fun to play.\n\nProbably comes a little too easy to me\n\nbecause I relate to it too much.\n\n♪ Modern day warrior, mean mean stride ♪\n\n♪ Today's Tom Sawyer, mean mean pride ♪\n\n[guitar playing]\n\nThat's it.\n\nHow's that feel?\n\nRush was in the script and the reason was\n\nbecause John Hamburg, when he was in high school,\n\nhad a band and Rush was his, that was the band.\n\nYou know, both Jason and I knew Rush and loved Rush\n\nand this would be the perfect band\n\nthat these guys would share a love of this band.\n\nAnd then it was just so fortuitous\n\nbecause while we were shooting the movie,\n\nRush was on tour and they came to LA, and they had two shows\n\nand there was a day in between each show, and they said,\n\nall right, yeah, we can come by, we'll shoot a scene.\n\nYou know, I probably hear it a little less now\n\nthan I did at one point in my life,\n\nbut I think more than any other thing, yeah,\n\nI, slap the bass is probably the line that\n\nall of a sudden has just walked down the street,\n\nand I'll hear somebody yell at from somewhere.\n\nSlap a the bass, man.\n\nThere you go.\n\nSlap a the bass, man.\n\nThere you go.\n\nSlap at the bass, man.\n\nI slap a the bass.\n\nPlease don't do that.\n\nOr somebody'll you know, let me go slap the bass.\n\nI know I've met a few few bass players in my life\n\nwho want to strangle me.\n\nLike, dude, you ruin my life.\n\nThat fucking joke.\n\nClueless.\n\nHey James Bond,\n\nin America, we drive on the right side of the road.\n\nI am. You tried driving in platforms.\n\nLook, I gotta get back to school.\n\nWanna practice parking?\n\nWhat's the point? Everywhere you go has valet.\n\nWhen I first read this script for Clueless,\n\nI thought, okay,\n\nthis is gonna be another movie about a bunch of kids.\n\nAnd seemed pretty smart.\n\nI was really kind of into it as I was reading it\n\nand I thought all the characters were unique.\n\nI'd been asked to read for Josh for that,\n\nfor the part that I played.\n\nBut I, when I went into the audition, I said, you know,\n\nthis part's really,\n\nthere's nothing really funny about this part that I,\n\nI'd love to try for that one.\n\nThey said, sure, read for whatever, whatever you want.\n\nBut I said, well Murray's really funny.\n\nAnd then they said,\n\nwell actually that's an African American part.\n\nI said, okay, well then I won't read for that one, but uh...\n\nThen they said, well would you, would you read for Josh?\n\nThe one that you,\n\nthe one you were supposed to read for at first place?\n\nI said, well of course I would.\n\nYou just got here\n\nand already you're playing couch commando.\n\nHey, in some parts of the universe,\n\nmaybe not in Contempo Casual,\n\nbut in some parts it's considered cool to know\n\nwhat's going on in the world.\n\nPreparation that I did for Josh,\n\nI went to college and I think I just\n\nlifted most of my own clothes for that movie.\n\nSome of those clothes that I was wearing with causes on it,\n\nthat was my Amnesty International shirt\n\nand it was my KU hat.\n\nYou could, have a bit of a, like a goatee kind of\n\ngrowing it in and having it for a little bit.\n\nThen that was gone.\n\nHey granola breath, you got something on your chin.\n\nI'm growing a goatee.\n\nWell that's good.\n\nYou don't wanna be the last one at the coffee house\n\nwithout chin pubes.\n\nVery true to I think my own college experience.\n\nSo I was certainly lucky enough to make it through\n\nseveral rounds and get cast in that movie.\n\nCan you imagine the nerve of that guy?\n\nI mean making you worry like that.\n\nHe's the one that screwed up and then he goes and blames us.\n\nI wanna say that scene on the top of the stairs,\n\nwe were kind of working on it\n\nas we were filming it that day.\n\nI was very self-conscious afterward.\n\nWhy are you saying you cared about me?\n\nJosh.\n\nAs far as that kiss goes,\n\nI think my manager at the time after\n\nwhen that movie came out and said, oh that was not good.\n\nHe said, I did not do that very well.\n\nSo I'm like, hey, you weren't there.\n\nHow would you know?\n\nIt's a weird job when you're hired\n\nand part of your job is to kiss somebody.\n\nAnd I was very aware I was kissing the girl\n\nfrom the Aerosmith videos\n\nand that there was gonna be a lot of dudes\n\nwho were gonna be very jealous of me.\n\nI was very aware of that.\n\nKnocked up.\n\nHey, what's so great about bubbles?\n\nThey float. You can pop 'em.\n\nI mean, I get it. I get it.\n\nI wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles.\n\nThat's sad.\n\nWhen we were working on the script,\n\nJudd and Leslie had been married\n\nand together for a long time.\n\nHas had my wife and I had been together for a long time\n\nup until that point, you know,\n\nand Judd wanted to hear things from my life and my marriage\n\nand things that we, you know, we were dealing with\n\nand being a young parent.\n\nThere were certain things like I never,\n\nwhen my wife was pregnant, I didn't read the baby books.\n\nAnd we got into an argument about it.\n\nShe took it as a hostile gesture,\n\nwhich I totally understand in retrospect.\n\nAnd I said, what did the cavemen do without\n\nWhat to Expect When You're Expecting?\n\nAnd I told Alyssa and Judd, you know, it was funny\n\nand then it's in the movie now as Seth's character.\n\nYou know, you didn't even read the baby books.\n\nI didn't read the baby book.\n\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\nHow did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?\n\nThat's right.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians fucking engraved\n\nWhat to Expect When You're Expecting on the pyramid walls.\n\nI forgot about that.\n\nAnd when my wife and I saw the movie at she, she's like,\n\noh so, this is an interesting documentary\n\nwe're watching right now.\n\nI literally am at a point\n\nwhere I don't know what I can say.\n\nSo I'm the bad guy because I'm trying to protect our kids\n\nfrom child molesters and mercury?\n\nAnd you're cool 'cause you don't give a shit?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah? Is that it?\n\nPretty much.\n\nGod, you're an asshole.\n\nIt was the first time that we had worked together,\n\nLeslie and I, and I think the very first scene\n\nthat we filmed together was when we're in the bathroom.\n\nSo what do you think? Should we have sex tonight?\n\nUgh, sounds awful.\n\nAnd then we did a, we got into a fight.\n\nI'm just really constipated.\n\nDo you really want to?\n\nWell now.\n\nAnd Leslie is such a good actress.\n\nI went home that night, I was like, oh my God,\n\nI think Leslie is really mad at me.\n\nI think that she,\n\nI think she maybe hates me\n\nand really kind of rattled me a little bit.\n\nSomehow it got back\n\nand the next day Leslie came over to me and she goes,\n\nI heard you think that I'm mad at you.\n\nI said, I'm just, I'm, I didn't, I hope not.\n\n'Cause I didn't try, I didn't want to upset you.\n\nShe goes, of course not.\n\nI don't hate you. My God, I hate Judd.\n\nAnd I thought oh, yeah, no, we're gonna have a blast.\n\nWe're gonna have so much fun.\n\nThere are five different types of chairs\n\nin this hotel room.\n\nHoly fuck. What are they all doing in here?\n\nThese are five different types of chairs.\n\nGet 'em outta here, man.\n\nSet design had, there were, it was like a hotel room,\n\nthere were chairs that around I thought like\n\nhow do you act like you are peaking on mushrooms or like,\n\nit isn't like drunk or high or something.\n\nLike, I don't know, what do we think?\n\nShoot, let's, let's just put all the chairs together\n\nand then like, all right, now go guys.\n\nOh man.\n\nWe knew we were gonna get to this idea that\n\ncan you believe like that somebody\n\nwould ever want to be with you, to marry you.\n\nSo we had an an end point,\n\nthing we knew we were gonna kind of say, which was about,\n\nbut how we would get there, we didn't really know.\n\nAnd those chairs were just happened to be props\n\nin the set that they had built\n\nand so we just pushed 'em all together\n\nand we just kind of started rolling it.\n\nYou can't accept love?\n\nYou don't know what it is.\n\nLove the most beautiful shining warmy thing in the world,\n\nyou can't accept it?\n\nI have to go to this other chair.\n\nOh, this is a better energy.\n\n[Paul] This is 40.\n\nWhat is she doing?\n\nOkay.\n\nOh my god. Oh my God.\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nDon't do that.\n\nWhat am I doing?\n\nDon't fart in the bed.\n\nYou know, it's, I've known Judd and Leslie and the girls\n\nfor years and I knew them when they were babies, really.\n\nAnd I went over to the house one night, I'm just like,\n\nall right, I have dinner and see what their night is like.\n\nYou know how their evening kind of goes.\n\nThey're like, all right,\n\nI'm gonna go put Maude to bed or Iris to bed\n\nand read 'em the story or, I was just kind of an observer.\n\nBut I also knew them so it wasn't, you know,\n\nwe'd spent a lot of time together up until that point.\n\nSo it wasn't like I was some stranger kind of\n\ntaking notes at the end of their bed.\n\nIt all sounds so Daniel Day Lewis-y, doesn't it?\n\nI'm gonna go put the kids to bed.\n\nI did by the way.\n\nI remember going to their room and they had a,\n\na machine that projected stars on their ceiling\n\nand they're like, oh yeah, they don't sleep without this,\n\nwithout this star machine on.\n\nAnd then I went back\n\nand I ordered two star machines off of Amazon.\n\nAnd I still have 'em, they're great.\n\nWe used to build tree houses and play with sticks.\n\nNobody plays with sticks.\n\nYou and Charlotte can have a lemonade stand.\n\nPlay kick the can.\n\nLook for dead bodies.\n\nIt's fun. That's fun to do.\n\nGet a tire and then just take a stick\n\nand run down a street with it.\n\nNobody does that crap. It's 2012.\n\nYou don't need technology.\n\nNo technology.\n\nIt was a weird feeling to do these scenes\n\nwhere I'm acting opposite his wife\n\nwith his kid standing there and he's off, you know,\n\nfilming it all.\n\nWas very aware of how strange, I mean,\n\nand I kept trying to think\n\nhow are his children processing this?\n\nIs this healthy?\n\nIs what we're doing here right now safe and good?\n\nWith time and distance, I can say yes.\n\nAnd it was a really fun experience.\n\nI had a great time working on that movie.\n\nI've had a great time working actually\n\non all movies with Judd.\n\nI think they've been really, really fun\n\nand they're, as far as creatively,\n\nI think they're some of the most fulfilling\n\ncreative experiences\n\nbecause of the collaboration and because of the freedom\n\nthat everybody feels I think.\n\nAnd what they can do\n\nand what they can maybe try and come up with.\n\nWet Hot American Summer.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAre you gonna clean that up?\n\nOh yeah, I will.\n\nI just got, I don't have time right now.\n\nClean it up and come to my office for the meeting.\n\nI gotta.\n\nThe making of Wet Hot American Summer was a blast.\n\nIt was the first thing that I think that a lot of the people\n\nthat we're working on it, it really spoke to our,\n\nour kind of collective sensibility and senses of humor.\n\nHey. Whatcha writing on?\n\nMy gournal. Write my thoughts in it every day.\n\nOh, you mean a, a journal?\n\nI think everyone kind of knew each other a little bit.\n\nIt was like all these kind of New York actors\n\nand improv comedy and B alt comedy sea.\n\nAnd we filmed it at a summer camp.\n\nWe had to leave in the middle of production\n\nbecause the camp was closed for a week\n\nbecause somebody hired it out to have a bar mitzvah.\n\nYou know, we all slept at the camp, it rained every day,\n\nso whoever wasn't filming had to go into town,\n\nwhich was about 30 minutes away and buy beer\n\nso that when the days filming was done,\n\neveryone, we all hung out.\n\nWe didn't have computers\n\nlike when no one had like cell phones, really.\n\nIt was just it, so we were, everyone was just there.\n\nAnd also if you weren't working,\n\nyou went and watched other people filming their scenes.\n\nSo there was a real kind of camaraderie and a feeling\n\nlike a collective.\n\nAnd it was like being at summer camp.\n\nAnd so to do that and then work on material\n\nthat we all found funny\n\nthat we kind of couldn't believe was actually getting made\n\nand we all kind of knew people are not going to get this,\n\nbut I think that people do get it or will find is funny\n\nwill find it really funny.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nYou have barbecue sauce all over your face.\n\nObviously anything I work on, I don't know.\n\nI don't know if something's good or bad.\n\nI really don't.\n\nI always go in with like the best intentions,\n\nbut I do know that like when Wet Hot American Summer\n\nwas done, I'm like, this movie's funny.\n\nI know it's funny.\n\nI'm and not, I'm laughing at the parts of just\n\nlike when they jump out of the truck\n\nand they run over to the side of the building\n\nand stand there.\n\nJust stand there. And it makes the cut.\n\nHey you guys, wait up.\n\nI was dying.\n\nI think that's like the funniest thing.\n\nAnd so then when, you know, yeah,\n\nwhen it came out people like,\n\nwell this is just seems like a bunch of hit and miss jokes\n\nand it doesn't really add up.\n\nAnd that was the first time where I'm like, no, I actually,\n\nI, I don't agree with that opinion.\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall.\n\nAre you, are you Chuck?\n\nOh man, you know, they won't change that flyer.\n\nThat's my main land name. My Hawaiian name is Kunu.\n\nOh cool. Sorry. Yeah.\n\nNah, it's all good.\n\nDoes Kunu have some like cool Hawaiian meaning?\n\nMeans Chuck.\n\nI'd worked with Jason Siegel a couple of times.\n\nI love Jason.\n\nStoler, again, all the people I've worked with in the past\n\nand there really wasn't much in that script, necessarily,\n\nabout that character.\n\nAnd Jason said come down and play a surf instructor.\n\nYou know, if you ever go to these resorts in Hawaii,\n\nthere's always somebody that is working there\n\nand they're super cool and they're gonna take you out\n\nand teach you how to surf or teach you how to scuba dive\n\nor whatever it is.\n\nAnd you spend half a day with them and it's like,\n\nthis person has really got everything kind of figured out.\n\nWhat a great life, what a cool thing.\n\nAnd then you spend a little longer\n\nand you learn a little bit more about their lives\n\nand there's the running from something\n\nand broken in some way and this guy has a, a daughter.\n\nHe's like, yeah, you know, I,\n\nI haven't seen her in a while but that's, that's cool.\n\nShe's on her own journey.\n\nJust these, these kinds of sad statements.\n\nI think I was in my thirties,\n\nI was playing someone who was 44.\n\nI remember thinking like that's super funny.\n\nReally old. 44.\n\nI mean if you had to put a number on it,\n\nI guess I'd be 44.\n\nFuck!\n\nAnd so a lot of those scenes, I mean all of 'em really,\n\nI dunno what I was gonna say,\n\nwhat it's gonna do and then we're all,\n\nwe all figuring out like we're all there on the beach.\n\nYou're like, what if we just keep, get up.\n\nThat's too much now down.\n\nLike there's no rhyme or reason to anything\n\nthe guy is saying.\n\nYeah. We were winging 'em.\n\nAnt-Man.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWould you like some sugar?\n\nYeah, thanks.\n\nYou know what I'm okay.\n\nMy friend Edgar Wright, he'd written a script\n\nwith Joe Cornish,\n\nhe asked if I would be interested in playing this part.\n\nI thought it'd be fun to try and play a role that was\n\nso different than anything that I'd really played.\n\nI mean the idea of a superhero\n\nwas really intriguing and great.\n\nI mean these things are seen all over the world\n\nand by all ages, you know?\n\nThis, that's a somewhat new experience for me.\n\nHey, you're cute.\n\n[screaming]\n\nThat was a lot scarier a second ago.\n\nThe first two were more standalone,\n\nsmaller, kind of separate from,\n\nfrom everything else that didn't really have the\n\nhuge spectacle maybe of some of the other big Marvel movies\n\nand this one kind of does.\n\nIn this new version in Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania,\n\nit is such a huge film.\n\nI mean just the scope of it.\n\nThe scale of it and how it's kind of kicking off\n\nthis new phase with the introduction of Kang.\n\nWhat's it gonna be, Ant-Man?\n\nYou know, one of the most incredible experiences\n\nI've had working on the Marvel films\n\nis getting to meet Stan Lee.\n\nAnd one of the things that he told me was\n\nhow happy he was that they were making Ant-Man as a film.\n\nHe felt in the comics,\n\nit was very tough to really gauge the scale.\n\nIf you're drawing Ant-Man,\n\nyou can't really draw other things at the proper scale.\n\nSo audiences were going to finally see Ant-Man\n\nin the way that he always envisioned Ant-Man.\n\nTo work in within the MCU and and these films,\n\nyou do feel a part of a collective in a way.\n\nThere's something pretty great about that.\n\nYou know, when you're an actor it can be\n\nkind of a solitary existence\n\nand when you feel like you're kind of going through it\n\nwith a group of people, it makes it fun.\n\nI feel like real solid friendships form.\n\nI kind of can't believe that it's been\n\nnow almost nine years.\n\nIs that right?\n\nSomething like that? Yeah."
