        "text": "Sometimes, an actor doesn't know, what a special friend he is to someone. When Irfan Khan died, it felt like a personal loss even though he was a man I'd never met. He was more than just an actor on a screen; he was a quiet confidant for me, a storyteller who painted emotions with the subtlest of brushstrokes. Remember \"The Lunchbox\"? I must've watched it a dozen times, mesmerized each time by his simple line, \"Salt was okay, but the chilli... a bit much.\" His voice, a gentle murmur, held the power of a thousand unspoken words, a symphony of emotion without ever needing to raise its volume. I know it sounds strange, but I think of him often. My friends know it too - I probably mention it more than they'd like, how I miss him like a friend I've known for years. But then, especially after watching \"Railway Men,\" a wave of gratitude washed over me, a thank you whispered to the heavens for the privilege of witnessing his brilliance through his son Baabil. But a selfish part can't help but whisper, \"What if there were more stories of him. More brilliant performances of Irfan to be amazed by. Cut 2 This morning, while getting ready for work, I draped myself in a simple cotton sari, a wish escaped my lips. \"I wish someone could drop me to work today\" I sighed. A sari isn't just fabric; it's a feeling. And it elicits even in the women with the most mature confident wisdom, a pampered side. An entitlement for being spoilt. Just then, a notification pinged on my phone. \"Your Uber is here.\" I stepped down, and hurried to the car with all my office bags. As I slipped my gym bag on the front row of the car, I looked as my phone to give him the OTP. I smiled. The Universe was eavesdropping on my thoughts as usual. The name of the driver was Irfan Khan, and he was taking me to work today. I told the driver about this and he smiled too. Let's just say, we both had a good start to the day. The universe has its own peculiar ways of of offering comfort, a gentle reminder that the coincidences can be soothing. Maybe the universe was listening, or Irfan Khan actually knows what a BIG fan I am. #nostalgia #irfan"
