        "text": "As a prequel series to “The Dark Crystal,” Netflix‘s “Age of Resistance” takes place long before the majority of the Gelfling population disappeared and features seven divided Gelfling clans on Thra who are under Skeksis rule. But when the Skeksis’ horrifying secret is discovered and its effects on the planet of Thra, the Gelflings must unite to fight back against the evil overlords.\n\nAlthough it takes multiple people to bring just one character to life – from the writers and puppet designers to the puppeteers who also do the initial voice performance as a guide – a slew of celebrities were also lured by the song of Thra to lend their voices.
