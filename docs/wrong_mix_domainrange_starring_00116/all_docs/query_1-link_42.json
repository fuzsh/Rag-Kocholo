        "text": "UPDATED with full list of nominations, program and network scorecards: The 75th annual Primetime Emmy Awards nominations were revealed Wednesday morning, with HBO dominating the list with the most overall selections fueled by its powerhouse series Succession, House of the Dragon, The Last of Us and The White Lotus.\n\nSuccession, the HBO drama headlined by Brian Cox, earned a leading 27 nominations overall including an expected Best Drama nomination, plus multiple nods in the actor/actress categories. In the actor categories, perhaps the question should be who didn’t get a nomination from the show: all the male faves got some Emmy love including Cox, Jeremy Strong and Kieran Culkin as well as Matthew Macfadyen, Alexander Skarsgård, Alan Ruck and the beloved Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun). For the women, Sarah Snook got a nomination as did J. Smith-Cameron.\n\nIn the main Drama Series race, Succession will go up against fellow HBO hits that include House of the Dragon, The Last of Us and The White Lotus in addition to Andor, The Crown and Yellowjackets.\n\nRELATED: Best Drama Since Emmy Winners: A Photo Gallery\n\nOn the comedy side, the lineup was not entirely surprising: Ted Lasso, Barry, Only Murders in the Building, Abbott Elementary and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel are back in the running, but Academy voters left room for three new players in Wednesday, The Bear and Jury Duty.\n\nAs for comedy actors, the usual suspects populated the male lineup — Bill Hader, Martin Short and Jason Sudeikis — but newbies Jason Segal and Jeremy Allen White were invited to the party. For the women, Christina Applegate got some attention for Dead to Me, while Natasha Lyonne and Jenna Ortega are the welcome plebes of the lot, competing against now Emmy veterans Quinta Brunson and Rachel Brosnahan.\n\nRELATED: Best Comedy Series Emmy Winners: A Photo Gallery\n\nThe Limited Series category has once again shaped up to be a competitive situation: Beef will compete against fellow Netflix hit Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, while Daisy Jones & The Six will vie for the prize alongside Fleishman Is in Trouble and Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nSee the full list of nominees below.\n\nThis year’s Emmy Awards ceremony is scheduled to be held September 18 live on Fox, but a writers strike and a potential SAG-AFTRA strike could change that if no talent is available for the primetime showcase celebrating the best of TV over the past year.\n\nLast year’s Emmys saw Succession and Apple TV+’s Ted Lasso win the top drama and comedy series honors, respectively, with those shows back in the mix in a big way this year after each wrapped their strong runs this past season.\n\nHere’s the complete list of nominations:\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nAndor\n\nDisney+ • Lucasfilm Ltd.\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nAMC • High Bridge, Crystal Diner, Gran Via Productions and Sony Pictures Television\n\nThe Crown\n\nNetflix • Left Bank Pictures and Sony Pictures Television for Netflix\n\nHouse Of The Dragon\n\nHBO Max • HBO in association with 1:26 Pictures, Bastard Sword, and GRRM Productions\n\nThe Last Of Us\n\nHBO Max • HBO in association with Sony Pictures Television Studios, PlayStation Productions, Word Games, The Mighty Mint, and Naughty Dog\n\nSuccession\n\nHBO Max • HBO in association with Project Zeus, Hyberobject Industries, Gary Sanchez Productions and Hot Seat\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nHBO Max • HBO in association with Rip Cord and The District\n\nYellowjackets\n\nShowtime • SHOWTIME Presents, Entertainment One\n\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nABC • Delicious Non-Sequitur Productions in association with Warner Bros.
