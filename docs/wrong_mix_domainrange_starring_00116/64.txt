When you think about it, actors and professional athletes are very similar. Both are placed in the spotlight where the whole world is able to see. Then comes along those special type of people who double up on talent. People like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Chuck Connors took on both sports and acting. Some are more talented in one area than the other but we're not here to judge.

The King Does Comedy

NBA star LeBron James knows his way around a basketball court. He even gets animated and theatrical with his teammates on the bench when his team is winning. But does he know how to navigate the big screen? James plays himself in the 2015 film Trainwreck (starring Bill Hader and Amy Schumer) and even though he has never taken on such a big role, he was up for the challenge.

“They said, ‘You’re going to play yourself,' and I told them that I can do that easily," James said. "I can just show up and say, ‘I’m LeBron. I play basketball and I can dunk.' They said, ‘No. You’re actually going to be Bill’s best friend in the movie, and you’re going to be a love doctor who helps him patch things up with his girlfriend.’" He must have done well because Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 86 percent!
