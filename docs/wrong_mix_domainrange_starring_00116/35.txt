Earlier tonight, Demi Lovato took to Twitter to announce her involvement in the upcoming film The Angry Birds Movie. She revealed that she will be contributing an original song to the movie, which is set to come out on May 20, just in time for the start of the summer season.

Lovato has previously done work for other film soundtracks, including recording her own version of "Let It Go" from Frozen and releasing the song "Heart by Heart" from The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, not to mention her Camp Rock days.

She joins previously-announced pop star Charli XCX in the film. Charli will be voicing a character named Willow. Other voice actors in the film include Jason Sudekis, Kate McKinnon, Bill Hader, and Peter Dinklage. You can check out the trailer for the video game turned feature film below.
