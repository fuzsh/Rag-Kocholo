(photo from flickr - (c) Southern Driver shows the station open).

Newhaven Harbour (Boat Station) opened in 1884 and was renamed as Newhaven Marine in 1984 by British Rail. It has only one platform, but has always been numbered Platform 3.

The Station has never offically closed to passengers and since August 2006, it has still had an unadvertised passenger train, however, due to "safety concerns" over the unsafe roof, which is no longer there, passengers have been prevented from joining the train. This train still runs once a day, rather than close the station.

At the same time, the Ferry Terminal has closed. A very wet and cold day.

Beware of the Fragile Roof as can be seen below, the reason of the closure has gone

At this point, I notice some lights come on upstairs, and a host of activity, followed by the arrival, to my surprise of a ship!

And here is said Ghost train ready to leave

There is a poster which Southern offer to provide a taxi from Newhaven Marine to Harbour station to anyone with a valid ticket. This photo is taken of the "Ghost" train arriving from the footbridge of Harbour station, a whole 2 minute walk.
