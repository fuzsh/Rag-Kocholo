Newhaven Harbour railway station is one of two stations serving Newhaven in East Sussex, England, the other being Newhaven Town. The station was opened by London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1886, although the line had opened in 1847. A third station in Newhaven, Newhaven Marine, operated passenger services until 2006 and formally closed in October 2020.[1]

Trains are operated by Southern and the station is on the Seaford Branch of the East Coastway Line, 56 miles 51 chains (91.1 km) measured from London Bridge.[2] Beyond the station en route to Bishopstone, the line reduces to single track to Seaford.

The station is adjacent to the harbour industrial estate and freight terminal. The passenger terminal for the Port of Newhaven which has regular ferry sailings to Dieppe in France is served by Newhaven Town railway station. The station despite its name has not been used as the main ferry terminal station, originally Newhaven Marine was the foot passenger terminal, before it moved to Newhaven Town.

The station has two platforms joined by a bridge, with Permit to Travel Machines on both platforms. There is a disused bay platform and a disused siding on the up (Londonbound) side.

Newhaven Harbour's signal box was demolished on Sunday 15 March 2020, several months after the Seaford branch resignalling project transferred signalling control to Three Bridges ROC.
