        "text": "One of the things I love most about New York City’s prettiest subway station is the way it unexpectedly appears out of nowhere. As you’re heading east along 180th Street toward Morris Park Ave in the Bronx, look north…\n\n…and all of a sudden, you’ll see a red terra cotta-roofed tower rise into view just above a rock ledge. Continue around to the front…\n\n…and the American flag is about the only indication that you haven’t been magically transported to a train station in Italy.\n\nThis is the East 180th Street 2/5 station, and for my money, it’s hands down the prettiest subway station entrance in New York.\n\nBuilt in 1912, this was originally the administration building for the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which offered service between White Plains, Port Chester, and East 132nd Street (the inclusion of Boston seems to have been a flat-out lie). Below, the station in 1928:\n\nDesigned to resemble an Italian villa complete with clay-tiled roof, the three-story stucco facade centers on a large clock…\n\n…with a bust of Mercury above…\n\n…and if you look closely, the initials for the old New York, Westchester & Boston line below:\n\nI love the decorative balconies and arched windows found on each of the 4-story towers flanking the central section:\n\nThe railway never turned a profit, and finally went out of business in 1937. It was purchased by the city in 1940 and integrated into the IRT at East 180th Street. Below, the building’s loggia and plaza:\n\nThe building motif continues along this wall, which blocks a portion of the track:\n\nFrom the side, I love how the outcroppings give the station the illusion of being perched atop a rocky cliff.\n\nIf the building looks immaculate, it’s not by accident. In 2013, the MTA completed a 2-year, $66.5 million dollar restoration of the station inside and out. In particular, I love the gorgeous mosaics by artist Luisa Caldwell…\n\nInspired by the station’s proximity to the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Garden, three can be seen as you first enter the station: an elephant picking flowers…\n\n…a deer enjoying a snack…\n\n…and a mouse (or is that a rat?) nibbling on a petal:\n\nBe sure to head further into the station for a few more examples of Caldwell’s work…\n\n…including some old-school mosaic subway signs…\n\n…and this pair of images featuring a tortoise…\n\n…and a hare (which subway commuter are you?):\n\nUltimately, the station is just another reminder…\n\nNever underestimate the Bronx.\n\n-SCOUT\n\nPS – Yes, yes, I realize the “subway” is actually elevated at this point; as I have yet to have ever hear a New Yorker refer to anything as an “el station,” I’m going by the official monicker of “New York City Subway.”"
