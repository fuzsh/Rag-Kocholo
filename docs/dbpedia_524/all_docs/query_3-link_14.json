Wouldn't NR just end the lease and state that because of this no trains can call there as part of the national network? Surely it is down to the owners of it to actually close it down.\n\nThe closure of a railway station is simply the ceasing of services permenantly. That is the choice of whoever owns/operates the railways. My communication from the DafT states that, if so desired, the normal closure procedures could happen.\n\nSponsor Post - registered members do not see these adverts; click here to register, or click here to log in\n\nR\n\nRailUK Forums\n\n24 Jul 2018\n\n#152\n\nThe_Train\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n2 Jun 2018\n\nMessages\n\n4,403\n\nThe closure of a railway station is simply the ceasing of services permenantly.

Operationally, I understand it was really part of Harbour station and for boat train connections, often worked in conjunction with Harbour's up platform at busy times, the usable section of which was once much longer than today. Marine was always used for rail arrivals while departing boat trains could leave from either Marine or Harbour's up platform.\n\n24 Jul 2018\n\n#156\n\nnajaB\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n28 Aug 2011\n\nMessages\n\n31,517\n\nLocation\n\nScotland\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to close the station faster, without creating a precedent, by renumbering the Marine platforms as part of Harbour, then closing the platforms.\n\n24 Jul 2018\n\n#157\n\nMidnightFlyer\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n16 May 2010\n\nMessages\n\n12,857\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to close the station faster, without creating a precedent, by renumbering the Marine platforms as part of Harbour, then closing the platforms.\n\nMarine did used to be numbered sequentially with Harbour - it sole platform being number 3 after the two at Harbour.\n\n24 Jul 2018\n\n#158\n\nEsker-pades\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n23 Jul 2015\n\nMessages\n\n3,774\n\nLocation\n\nBeds, Bucks, or somewhere else\n\nI wonder if it would be possible to close the station faster, without creating a precedent, by renumbering the Marine platforms as part of Harbour, then closing the platforms.\n\nWhat platforms?\n\n24 Jul 2018\n\n#159\n\nnajaB\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n28 Aug 2011\n\nMessages\n\n31,517\n\nLocation\n\nScotland\n\nWhat platforms?\n\nOkay, the empty space that used to be a platform.\n\n29 Jul 2018\n\n#160\n\nThere are 'sayings' around the mess room that after the signalling work closure on the whole Lewes to Seaford branch in August, is that the points into Marine will be clipped for some time, with both Newhaven boxes going and Lewes box, it seems it will be some time before the TBD Roc gets it's paws on the points. Note: Not 100% confirmed.\n\nAny more substance to this please? Someone said about possible renewal of the level crossing at Newhaven Town. Will this be converted to a MCB with CCTV (controlled from Lewes or Three Bridges ROC) or an OD crossing? Presume the same for those at Newhaven Harbour...\n\nAnd I just remembered, there's a semaphore down there...\n\n31 Jul 2018\n\n#161\n\njamesthegill\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n26 Dec 2013\n\nMessages\n\n49\n\nMarine did used to be numbered sequentially with Harbour - it sole platform being number 3 after the two at Harbour.\n\nIt still is, looking on CCF.\n\n1 Aug 2018\n\n#162\n\nsarahj\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n12 Dec 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,897\n\nLocation\n\nBrighton\n\nI’m there right now.
