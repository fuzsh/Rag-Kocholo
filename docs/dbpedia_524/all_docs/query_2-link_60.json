        "text": "Tickets purchased for our Boston/NH-ME service do not reserve a specific seat or time. You may use your tickets to travel any day or time within 90 days for one-way tickets and 180 days for round-trip tickets, from the first date of travel (with the exception of New York service). If you plan to use the tickets within that time frame, there is no need to return/exchange them even if there is a different time noted on the ticket – just present your ticket to the driver when you are ready to travel. Please arrive at the terminal 15-30 minutes prior to bus departure and present your ticket and a valid ID to the driver."
