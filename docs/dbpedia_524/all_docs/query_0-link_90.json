        "text": "Glasgow Central (Main)\n\nGlasgow Central Station\n\nGlasgow Central station is the UK's main railway terminal. It is located in Glasgow, Scotland's largest city.

One of the 19 hub stations directly under the jurisdiction of the railway company. The train station is the northern end of the main line of the West Coast.\n\nThe station operates all suburban routes in southern Glasgow, including the feeder lines of Ayrshire and the Clyde Coast, and is the departure point for Glasgow to all English cities. In addition, the Argyll Line and another suburban route lead to Edinburgh as a complementary route to the Glasgow Edinburgh Railway, which ends at Glasgow Queen Street Station.\n\nWith a traffic volume of 27 million passengers between 2013 and 2014, Glasgow Central Station has become one of the ten busiest railway stations in the UK. According to the statistics of the British National Railways, the annual traffic is about 38 million, of which 80% is passenger traffic.

Historically part of Lanarkshire, the city now forms the Glasgow City council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland; the local authority is Glasgow City Council. Glasgow is situated on the River Clyde in the country's West Central Lowlands. It is the fifth most visited city in the UK.Inhabitants of the city are referred to formally as \"Glaswegians\" or \"Weegies\". Glasgow is also known for the Glasgow patter, a distinct dialect of the Scots language that is noted for being difficult to understand by those from outside the city. Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the fifteenth century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the eighteenth century. From the eighteenth century onwards, the city also grew as one of Great Britain's main hubs of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the \"Second City of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period, although many cities argue the title was theirs.In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938. Comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes. This process reduced the population of the City of Glasgow council area to an estimated 615,070, with 1,209,143 people living in the Greater Glasgow urban area. The wider metropolitan area is home to over 1,800,000 people, equating to around 33% of Scotland's population. The city has one of the highest densities of any locality in Scotland at 4,023/km2. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the first European Championships in 2018; and is also well known in the sporting world for football (particularly the Old Firm rivalry between Celtic and Rangers), rugby, athletics, tennis, golf and swimming.\n\nGlasgow - Guide, Attractions, Tours, Sightseeings | Train from/to Glasgow | Popular Routes"
