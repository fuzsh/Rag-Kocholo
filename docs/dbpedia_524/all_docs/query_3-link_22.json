        "text": "Victoria Harbour is a small terminus station, served by Regional services to Leaton, Freston Junction, Russell Lane, Ashdean, Norrington, Fayre and Mill Bridge.\n\nDescription[]\n\nVictoria Harbour has only 1 platform. Beside the main station are a few sidings for freight wagons and after that is a cargo port, hence the station's name. The entrance is small, with a relatively large car park in front of the entrance. There is a warehouse next to the station. There is also a canopy that spans along most of the length of the warehouse. The station is completely step-free.\n\nLayout[]\n\n-] Terminating Regional services returning to Leaton, Freston Junction, Russell Lane, Ashdean, Fayre, Norrington and Mill Bridge. 1\n\nServices[]\n\nPreceding Station British Railway Following Station Victoria Docks Regional\n\nVictoria Coast Line Terminus\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1.0.0, this station had 2 platforms with 4 terminus tracks. This station was also isolated from the rest of the Victoria Coast Line by a tunnel to the next station, Longbow Beach.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBefore Version 1.1.0, one of the station signs on Platform 1 read \"Stepford Victoria\". This is a reference to the Stepford Victoria station in Stepford County Railway, another Roblox train game.\n\nThe sign was removed after the update.\n\nThe station used to be a lot bigger during Version 1.0.0 with four platforms.\n\nThis station is based off of Newhaven Marine before its closure in 2020.\n\nThis station and Freston Junction have the most characters in their name, at 15.\n\nIn real life, there is a harbour with the same name in Hong Kong, China.\n\nBefore Version 1.0.0, this station was called Victoria's Harbour.\n\nThis is the only terminating station that does not have any Semi-fast services."
