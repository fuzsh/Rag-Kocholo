between Newhaven and Ingliston Park & Ride only, as well as Lothian Buses day services. A Network DAYticket is valid for travel to or from Edinburgh Airport.\n\nWe have a pre-purchase policy, so all tickets, smartcards and mtickets have to be purchased, validated or activated before you board the tram. We offer various ways to travel to suit all needs:\n\nticket machines on the platforms: pay by coins or card\n\nmobile app: pre-purchase your tickets and activate before you board\n\nwebsite: pre-purchase your tickets and display your ticket on your phone\n\nWe also offer two types of passes both available through our TravelHubs\n\ncitysmart card\n\nRidacard\n\nIf you do not purchase, validate or activate before you board the tram, you will have to pay the £10 On-board fare to the Ticketing Services Assistant.\n\nIf you need to jump on-and-off you might want to consider a DAYticket or one of our multi-day tram tickets.\n\nJourneys using single and return tickets cannot be broken. Once you step off the tram, your journey is considered completed and you will need to buy another ticket to continue.\n\nIf you have a Scottish National Entitlement Card (also known as a Saltire card) issued by the City of Edinburgh Council, you are entitled to free travel on the tram. The same applies to cards from any local authority indicating visual impairment. However cards issued by other local authorities are not valid on the tram.\n\nKeep an eye out for the validators on our platform, the grey and white machines with a pink square. All that you have to do is hold your card up against that square until a green tick appears on the screen above.\n\nYou can use any ticket machine, on any side of a platform, to get a ticket to your destination. However, if none of the ticket machines are working or you have any issues when purchasing your ticket, please get in touch through the green help point on the platform (it is staffed 24/7) and we will find a solution for you.\n\nWhile you can purchase tickets using contactless payments, we do not yet offer a capping system similar to Lothian Buses or Transport for London. If you think you will be using both tram and bus, we would recommend you purchase a paper DAYticket at the start of the day."
