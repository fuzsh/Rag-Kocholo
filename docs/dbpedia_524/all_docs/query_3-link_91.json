This disgraceful eyesore should either be demolished, even though I am all for preserving historic railway buildings, or preferably restored a.s.a.p. It cannot make people feel very safe waiting here for a train, especially after dark, surely? See image 27974 taken here in 1961.\n\nLocation: Newhaven Harbour\n\nOriginal line: Newhaven Branch (London, Brighton and South Coast Railway)\n\nPhotographer: David Bosher\n\nContact photographer: David Bosher\n\nContact editor\n\nPhotosets: Southern England stations (excluding London)\n\nDate: 15/04/2023\n\nImage number: 85409\n\nOther photographs of Newhaven Harbour on RailScot"
