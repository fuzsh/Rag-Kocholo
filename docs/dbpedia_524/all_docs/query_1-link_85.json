I believe the station had its official closure granted last year, so I'm not sure entirely why they run though - maybe to keep it as an option for stabling or turning short in times of disruption? Whatever it is though, they are timetabled to run in this way - and I don't think they'd be running to/from Marine for no reason - so I wouldn't hold your breath that your complaint will create a sudden change.\n\nYou certainly wouldn't want to be travelling there tonight.... If the two terminations are to keep up crew competency of Newhaven Marine, then they may well have just proved their worth by allowing Seaford services to at least service stations as far as Newhaven!\n\nhttps://www.southernrailway.com/tra...151060000#INC71C6A87FDF484939A74B44874700086A (link will probably expire later tonight)\n\nDisruption between Newhaven Harbour and Seaford expected until 23:00\n\nHide details​\n\nA broken down train between Newhaven Harbour and Seaford means the line is blocked.\n\nTrain services running to and from these stations may be cancelled, delayed or revised. Disruption is expected until 23:00.\n\nCustomer Advice\n\nThe 18:47 Brighton to Seaford service has been stopped in the Bishopstone area due to a fault.\n\nThis train is now blocking the line between Newhaven Harbour and Seaford, meaning other services cannot run in this area.\n\nWhere possible, services from Brighton will terminate at Newhaven Harbour and start back towards Brighton from there. However, there will only be limited trains on this route.\n\nYour tickets will be accepted on local Brighton and Hove Buses as an alternative.\n\nStaff are working to arrange replacement buses, but availability is extremely limited due to engineering works, as well as the closure of the line between Lewes and Glynde.\n\nFor this reason, if you are unable to use local buses to complete your journey, we would advise you to travel later this evening.\n\nSouthern are expecting buses to arrive in the area from around 22:00 at the earliest. Their providers will be Seaford & District / Brighton Horizon, Hams and Ensign.\n\nCan you tell me more about the incident?\n\nSouthern are working with Network Rail and our fleet controllers to resolve this incident as soon as possible.\n\nThey have attempted to send a rescue train to tow the defective train away, but unfortunately this has not been successful, so they are working on further plans to get everyone on the move.\n\nCheck before you travel:\n\nYou can check your journey using the National Rail Enquiries real-time Journey Planner\n\nTwitter:\n\nIf you would like to follow this incident on Twitter, please use #Seaford\n\nCompensation:\n\nYou may be entitled to compensation if you experience a delay in completing your journey today. Please keep your train ticket and make a note of your journey, as both will be required to support any claim.\n\nFeedback:\n\nWe want to make information better - tell us how!

Pre-Covid, some peak time ‘connections’ were missed on more than 50% of occasions, so I understand the issue.\n\nOrdinarily, you’d only have to wait 30 minutes for the next Seaford, but if this happens to be the slot in which the train turns at Newhaven Harbour, then you’re stuck at Lewes (or Newhaven) for an hour, and there isn’t a scheduled bus alternative between the towns. Rather unfortunate, as the Newhaven curtailments don’t appear to save any units or staff, so for the sake of train crew learning a dead-end spur that has no timetabled use, there is indeed some customer inconvenience, though I won’t be writing-in about it.\n\nWhat response have you had from Southern?\n\nHow often have you (or others known to you) been delayed by 1 hour as a result of these alterations?\n\nSouthern gave a well prepared standard general release about Covid 19 difficulties and I understand these but they do not give a specific reason for these terminations and my point is there is a half hourly interval the rest of the day and this breaks the pattern.\n\nI can't give a exact number of times people delayed 1 hour and probably not that many as the current revised timetable works well\n\nToday 23/08/21 it happened again. 10 54 from Victoria was at Lewes 12 15 and next departure towards Seaford Line was 12 30 which is a Newhaven Harbour termination. Looks like it was not altered by Controllers to go to Seaford so those who planned to be on the 11 41\n\nex Brighton from Lewes were on 12 41 ex Brighton and 1 hour later then planned\n\nMaybe there was nobody for Seaford - I don't know but there usually is\n\nI guess the trips may double up as keeping something physically using the infrastructure, but then I guess it could be argued if that was the sole purpose then ten trips per week is perhaps unnecessary - particularly if regular traffic now serves the refurbished aggregates terminal?\n\nIt may also be about providing a 'firebreak' in the middle of the service, although from memory the turnrounds aren't especially tight for a 3-car unit. There are regular weekly freights into the aggregates terminal, although of course they don't help with keeping the 3rd rail clean.\n\nIF ASLEF has had any involvement in blocking video-based learning/refreshing at Southern, it wouldn't be by \"the local ASLEF branch\" and its member drivers simply declining to. It'll either be a case of it's simply not 'a thing' at Southern, or it is something that is being/has been dealt with at Company Council (DFC) level.\n\nI'm pretty sure video learning is a thing at southern, as somebody at one point posted a load of the videos on youtube. However Newhaven Marine sidings has a regularly changing visual scene as it's in the middle of the working port, only has 8 cars length of conductor rail, and stop boards rather than signals and overruns. So it may be felt that physically travelling over the route is necessary to maintain competence as the video wouldn't be able to give a driver enough familiarity to judge stopping/braking points.\n\nBefore a case can be submitted to the Rail Ombudsman the Train Operator has 40 days to respond. My original complaint about the revised service interval from half hourly to hourly by the 2 Newhaven Harbour terminations was registered 06/07/21 so the 40 days have expired. We have a fail to agree and I have asked for a 'Deadlock' letter so that I can submit my case.\n\nMy argument is that the revised timetable breaks the half hourly service interval in the May 2021 timetable and the terminations at Newhaven Harbour are done without good reason as the same train and crew return to Brighton and could start from Seaford at 12 53 and 21 53 thus maintaining a half hourly service\n\nI’m not quite sure what you’re expecting to achieve - DfT agree service level agreements with the train operator so this timetable will be the one that is agreed.\n\nJust because a service is half-hourly for most of the day, I’m not sure how that demands forcing them to run it where there are legitimate gaps for operational requirements. Plenty of routes have gaps on an otherwise regular pattern timetable for a while host of reasons, this happens on both rail and bus for a whole number of reasons.\n\nIt does seem a maybe another solution if you don’t like ‘gaps’ in a timetable is to reduce the whole service to hourly, then there wouldn’t be any of these gaps you find ‘annoying’\n\nI don't know the actual reason, I was just speculating. I think if the 313s were getting slower with age though there'd be more noticeable delay in overall timekeeping, rather than 1 per day being taken out.\n\nNormally this sort of thing is to accommodate some kind of freight or departmental path on a route which otherwise doesn’t have the capacity to accommodate it. We have something similar on the GN side with one daily KX to Cambridge stopping service reversing at Letchworth, to accommodate a freight path to Barrington.\n\nIs it a combination of the fact that Southern *need* to have the ability for crews to be familiar with reversing via Marine, and current crew issues make it harder than usual to accommodate? So picking two services at quieter times of day is their solution.\n\nThis is just a guess, however Southern will have done it for a reason, so complaining is unlikely to change things in the short term.\n\nNormally this sort of thing is to accommodate some kind of freight or departmental path on a route which otherwise doesn’t have the capacity to accommodate it.

If they get some money together to remodel the terminal yard then I'd expect that traffic to pick up quite quickly.\n\nHowever, as I've already said, if you wanted to leave as much room for freight to Newhaven as possible you'd send everything to Seaford. Terminating short and shunting into Marine is actively worse for freight."
