        "text": "Notes: Bishopstone Beach Station was built for the residents of Tide Mills village. It was sited on the branch to Seaford which was single track until 1904 with a platform on the south side. A second platform was added when the line was doubled. A siding ran to the tide mills which was worked by the Newhaven Harbour Companies locomotive. The tide mills ceased grinding in 1883, the store house remaining in use until 1900 after which the siding was lifted.\n\nIn August 1922 the station was renamed Bishopstone Halt. There was formerly a signal box at the Seaford end of the down platform controlling the level crossing and sidings which was removed about 1922. When a new station was opened at Bishopstone on 26th September 1938 the station was renamed Bishopstone Beach Halt, it was then used in the summer only.\n\nTide Mills village was evacuated about 1940 when the Royal Navy took over the harbour. The halt was closed from 1st January 1942 although the last train stopped at the halt at the end of the summer in 1941.\n\nAlthough closed in 1942 a 'special' stopped at the station in the 1970's for a Newhaven Historical Society Outing. The line was singled again in 1975."
