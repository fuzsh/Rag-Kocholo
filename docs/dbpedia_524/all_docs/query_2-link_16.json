You do have to wonder why electronic\n\nrecordings are made without knowing how to pronounce the station names.\n\nLondon Underground has a couple of different voices. The some of the\n\nannouncements on the Central and Northern lines were rerecorded so that\n\nthey didn't say \"the next station is spank\" and \"this is spank\", which\n\nused to give me seconds of amusement each time.\n\nBut the one on the Bakerloo saying \"Marlybone\" is just irritating.\n\nNeil Williams\n\nPost by Marcus O'Neill\n\nI'm aware that the PA announcements are of important benefit to\n\nvisually-impaired people, so I suppose I've partly answered my own\n\nquestion.

Yet another excruciating,\n\nextraneous noise to add to the cacophony of electronic audio diarrhoea\n\nthat forms the soundtrack to modern life.\n\nIndeed - I find the electronic \"bing bong\" sounds most irritating.\n\nIt's not as if a nicer sound can't be used, either - I thought the\n\nMark 3 \"strum\" was less intrusive, as is the quiet \"bong\" used in\n\nGermany.\n\nTry the Czech Republic, though - they have a different chime for every\n\noccasion. I nearly ended up rolling on the floor laughing after\n\nhearing the doors-closing tune on the Olomouc trams - and the one\n\npreceding the \"Stanice Praha Hlavni Nadrazi\" announcement (just as\n\nannoying as \"Birmingham New Street, this is Birmingham New Street\" but\n\nin 4 languages) really winds you up after the first few times.\n\nPost by Marcus O'Neill\n\nI suppose I should really be on \"Grumpy Old Men\".\n\n<AOL /> - and I'm 25!\n\nNeil\n\nChris Tolley\n\nPost by Marcus O'Neill\n\nis there\n\nreally so much need for a recitation of the train's entire forward\n\nitinerary after every stop?\n\nThat's probably context-sensitive. Some people need the reassurance once\n\nthey have boarded a train that they are on the right one. And the only\n\nway they'll get that is if the whole calling pattern is repeated. Of\n\ncourse, there could be less need for it if the information available on\n\nthe platform before boarding were up to scratch, but in some places it\n\nisn't.\n\n--\n\nPersonal Website: http://web.ukonline.co.uk/cj.tolley/\n\nRailway pictures: http://gallery120232.fotopic.net/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n***@supanet.com\n\nNB: the dot separating the t and 7 is there to fool spambots.\n\nRemove it before using this address.\n\nPaul Clare\n\nPost by Marcus O'Neill\n\nYet another excruciating,\n\nextraneous noise to add to the cacophony of electronic audio diarrhoea\n\nthat forms the soundtrack to modern life.\n\nHow beautifully put - you should make it part of your sig!\n\nTo you and everyone else in this thread I say - NEVER go anywhere near\n\nJapan!\n\nP C\n\nDarren\n\nPost by Henry Law\n\nDoes anyone not find this worse than irritating on stopping trains. 75\n\nsoundings in 90 minutes between Brighton and Portsmouth Harbour.\n\nThe PA system is giving an almost constant running commentary.\n\nThe c2c 357s do that as well, but more annoying is the voice of the\n\nwoman who does the announcements, and the way she speaks as if everyone\n\nis stupid.\n\nWhat is worse though, when a guard (like on the JOP I was on yesterday)\n\nwhere the auto announcer would do the announcement, then the guard would\n\nrepeat them, and every few minutes go on about quiet zones and mobile\n\nphones, also the volume was set so loud, he was making more noise than\n\nany mobile could.\n\n--\n\nDarren\n\nRupert Candy\n\nPost by Darren\n\nThe c2c 357s do that as well, but more annoying is the voice of the\n\nwoman who does the announcements, and the way she speaks as if\n\neveryone\n\nPost by Darren\n\nis stupid.\n\nTo say nothing of the irritating emphasis: \"Welcome aboard the c2c\n\nSERVICE to blah...\"\n\nRPM\n\nPost by Henry Law\n\nDoes anyone not find this worse than irritating on stopping trains. 75\n\nsoundings in 90 minutes between Brighton and Portsmouth Harbour.\n\nThe PA system is giving an almost constant running commentary.\n\nI rather suspect the \"BING BONG\" is very tightly specified in the vehicle\n\naccessibility regulations - most things are.\n\nRoger\n\nhttp://rpm-railpics.fotopic.net/\n\nhttp://therailwaystationgallery.fotopic.net/\n\nhttp://therailticketgallery.fotopic.net/\n\nArthur Figgis\n\nPost by RPM\n\nPost by Henry Law\n\nDoes anyone not find this worse than irritating on stopping trains. 75\n\nsoundings in 90 minutes between Brighton and Portsmouth Harbour.\n\nThe PA system is giving an almost constant running commentary.\n\nI rather suspect the \"BING BONG\" is very tightly specified in the vehicle\n\naccessibility regulations - most things are.\n\nI thought it was a place in Australia's Northern Territory.\n\nThe announcements I don't like are \"the next station is Clapham\n\nJunction\", broadcast straight after leaving East Croydon.
