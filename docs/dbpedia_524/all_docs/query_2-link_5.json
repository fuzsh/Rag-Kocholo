        "text": "As far as I know, the platform at Seaford is unnumbered, but it was about 2 years since I was there. Also, I thought the line was singled in the 1970s, at least that is when Bishopstone was...\n\nAfter an investigation (Google) the line was singled in 1975 but Seaford Box closed (permanently) in 2002 which is when my local scout believes the siding and rails in platform one were lifted (2002).\n\nAs far as the platform goes, all trains do depart plat 2 as per NRES and CIS.\n\nBTW - Plat 2 @ Seaford was originally to be a through platform linking Seaford to Eastbourne.... that never came to owt tho.\n\nWaverley is odd that 5 and 6 are still missing after the renumbering. It used to have more missing. To be honest I can't remember what the old numbers on the Southbound end were.\n\nformer Platforms 2 and 3, which were latterly used for parcels/mail traffic only and were removed in the 1980s when a new Royal Mail facility was built on their site;\n\nformer Platforms 4 and 5 were also retained for parcels/mail traffic until this ceased; Platform 5 was reopened to passengers in 2006 as the new Platform 3;\n\nformer platforms 6 and 7, of which only the latter survives, now numbered 4; and\n\nformer Platforms 8 and 9, which were substantially shortened for use as a Motorail terminus, the infilled area becoming a car park; since the demise of Motorail services these platforms are used only for locomotive stabling, although the numbers 5/6 were reserved for them in the 2006 renumbering.\n\nThe former Down Main through Platforms 7 (east end) and 8 (west end) are at the south side of the main station, and comprise a single very long platform with a crossover in the centre. They are numbered 7 (formerly 10, east end) and 11 (west end).\n\nAt the west end there has been little change to the terminating platforms, apart from widening them by removing disused centre-road tracks. The platforms comprise (south-north) numbers 12/13, 14/15, 16/17 and bay Platform 18. These were not affected by the 2006 platform renumbering scheme.\n\nThe only platforms outwith Waverley's overall roof are the former 'Suburban' Platforms 8 and 9 (formerly 21 and 20), a lengthy island platform. These are on the southern edge of the station, adjacent to the former freight depot (now a car park).\n\nA need to increase capacity for through and west-end traffic led to three new platforms being built in 2006, on land formerly occupied by disused sidings and bypass lines within the main part of the station. Platform 10 is a through platform at the west end, facing Platform 11. Platforms 1 and 20 are a single long through platform facing Platforms 2 and 19.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia"
