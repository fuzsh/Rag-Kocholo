It is a major destination for Avanti West Coast services from London Euston, Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley via the West Coast Main Line, the CrossCountry network, and for local and suburban services within the West Midlands, including those on the Cross-City Line between Lichfield Trent Valley, Redditch, and Bromsgrove, and the Chase Line to Walsall and Rugeley Trent Valley.\n\nThe station is named after New Street, which runs parallel to the station, although the station has never had a direct entrance except via the Grand Central shopping centre. Historically, the main entrance to the station was on Stephenson Street, just off New Street. As of 2020, the station has entrances on Stephenson Street, Smallbrook Queensway, Hill Street and Navigation Street.\n\nNew Street is the sixth busiest railway station in the UK and the busiest outside London, with 47.9 million passenger entries and exits between April 2018 and March 2019. It is also the busiest interchange station outside London, with just over 7 million passengers changing trains at the station annually. In 2018, New Street had a passenger satisfaction rating of 92%, the third highest in the UK.\n\nBirmingham Moor Street is another of the three main railway stations in the city centre of Birmingham. Opened in 1909 by the Great Western Railway as a terminus for local trains, and a newer Moor Street station with through platforms, a short distance from the original, which opened in 1987, replacing the original. The two were combined into one station in 2002, when the original was reopened and restored, and the newer station rebuilt in matching style.\n\nMoor Street has become more important in recent years; two of the original terminus platforms were reopened in 2010, and the station is now the terminus of many Chiltern Railways services from London Marylebone, as well as being an important stop for local services on the Snow Hill Lines. It is now the second busiest railway station in Birmingham.\n\nBirmingham Snow Hill is the third mainline railway station in Birmingham City Centre. Snow Hill was once the main station of the Great Western Railway in Birmingham, and at its height it rivalled New Street station, with competitive services to destinations including London Paddington, Wolverhampton Low Level, Birkenhead Woodside, Wales and South West England. After fifteen years of closure a new Snow Hill station, the present incarnation, was built; it reopened in 1987.\n\nToday, most of the trains using Snow Hill are local services on the Snow Hill Lines operated by West Midlands Railway, serving Worcester Shrub Hill, Kidderminster, Stourbridge Junction, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Solihull. The only long-distance service into Snow Hill is to London Marylebone operated by Chiltern Railways, via the Chiltern Main Line.\n\nGetting from New Street to Moor Street and Snow Hill Stations\n\nNew Street station is 600m away from Birmingham Moor Street station. There is a signposted route for passengers travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves a short walk through a tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre.\n\nBirmingham Snow Hill station is 1km away from New Street station. It is either a ten-minute walk away to the north or can be reached via a short tram ride on the West Midlands Metro.\n\nSplit Birmingham Train Tickets Are Legal"
