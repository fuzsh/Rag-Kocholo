        "text": "Moynihan Train Hall provides a new way to access both Amtrak and Long Island Railroad services, connecting directly with the existing platforms beneath Penn Station.\n\nThe Train Hall is directly opposite the existing Penn Station complex, on the west side of 8th Avenue, and offers the same easy access to the A,C,E and 1,2,3 subway lines and local bus services, as well as CitiBike, taxi and rideshare services right outside the Train Hall.\n\nNote: for New Jersey Transit services and access to Amtrak and LIRR services outside of the Moynihan Train Hall opening hours (5:00AM-1:00AM), please visit Penn Station.\n\nMoynihan Train Hall is the new home for Amtrak in New York City, providing fantastic, expanded facilities for all passengers! The Train Hall provides new ticketing, baggage and customer services facilities, as well as a large customer waiting area. Amtrak Red Caps support customers throughout the station, and Acela passengers will be able to take advantage of the Metropolitan Lounge.\n\nAmtrak Red Cap services operate throughout the Train Hall, assisting Amtrak riders with baggage to and from their trains, as well as helping passengers with disabilities, senior citizens and large groups navigate the station. You’ll find Red Caps stationed at the station entrances and in the Red Cap area in the Train Hall.\n\nLong Island Railroad Care is available throughout the Train Hall to provide assistance to Long Island Railroad customers boarding or exiting trains. Please visit the Long Island Railroad Information desk or speak a ticket sales agent who can connect you with a Care agent. If you have questions before you travel, please visit LIRR’s website for more information."
