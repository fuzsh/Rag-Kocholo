        "text": "1st June 2012. First day of retirement, so off to the Bluebell Railway to do some more work in the Carriage and Wagon Department, helping restore a wooden carriage from 1890 â one of William Stroudleyâs 4-wheel 5 compartment thirds.\n\nOn the model railway front, âBrighton Roadâ is more-or-less complete, so is retirement a good time to start a new layout? What would I build? Something smaller than Brighton Road â perhaps something local? It would have to be LBSCR, around 1900-1914, at a scale of 4mm:1ft (P4) just because of the rolling stock and locos I have. It would be good to build a smallish layout for exhibition, which only requires, say, three or four people to operate for a week-end, but would also fit into my garage.\n\nThe Mid-Sussex Groupâs layout âPulboroughâ was as near as we could get to a full-scale model of a prototype, and was interesting to build and very interesting to operate, whereas âBrighton Roadâ is fictitious, and only loosely based on Brighton prototypes. Pulborough looks like the real thing, and although Brighton Road looks good, and is a very challenging to operate because of its complexity, it doesnât have the same attachment to reality as Pulborough. This leads me down the road of building a layout closely based on a real location, at a reasonably defined time period. Is there a suitable location? The idea of building something local which can be easily visited has some appeal.\n\nThe âBrightonâ has very few termini, and most of these are much too large to model â Brighton, Littlehampton, Bognor, Portsmouth etc â or too small, such the Devilâs Dyke branch. I want to be able to exhibit the layout, but also to be able to set it up in my garage, which is a fairly generous 20ft, but a bit tight for an end-to-end layout. Two fiddle yards at a minimum of 4ft each would only leave 12ft for the scenic bit â not enough. However, my good friend Martin Nield came up with the suggestion of building an end-to-end layout, but making sure that it could be run as a terminus in the garage. This would need only one fiddle yard, and leave 16ft for the scenic section, which might be do-able. For high days and holidays, the garage doors can be opened, the second fiddle yard attached, and the layout could be operated end-to-end.\n\nSo here is the specification for the layout:\n\nÂ· P4 standard at 4mm:1ft\n\nÂ· LBSCR around 1900-1914\n\nÂ· Based as far as possible on a real location, preferably local\n\nÂ· Through station, not terminus\n\nÂ· Transportable and designed for exhibition\n\nÂ· Able to be set up and operated in the garage\n\nÂ· 20ft maximum length with one fiddle yard attached, and 24-25ft with two\n\nÂ· Able to be operated by two people, but with enough interest to keep four occupied\n\nÂ· Buildable by two people (myself and son Chris) to an exhibitable state within two years\n\nÂ· Realistic in the sense of countryside with a railway through it, rather than a railway with some scenery bolted on"
