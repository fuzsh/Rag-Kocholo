        "text": "France without flying\n\nAdvice for buying tickets to France\n\nTake a high-speed train to France\n\nIt's the civilised alternative to flying. Take Eurostar from London to Lille or Paris, then a 300 km/h TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse) through the French countryside with a glass of red wine to hand from Lille or Paris to Avignon, Marseille, Nice, Nîmes, Montpellier, Perpignan, Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Rennes or Nantes... It's affordable, too: London to Paris from £52 one-way or £78 return, Paris to Bordeaux, Lyon, Nice, or Perpignan from around 29 each way. Centre to centre, no baggage fees, no airport taxes, significantly less impact on the environment & infants go free.\n\nChoose your destination:\n\nTrain times, fares & tickets\n\nLondon to Paris\n\nOther UK towns & cities to Paris & France\n\nLondon to Disneyland & Versailles\n\nLondon to Nice, Cannes & Côte d'Azur\n\nLondon to Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille\n\nLondon to Nîmes, Montpellier, Sète, Agde\n\nLondon to Narbonne, Carcassonne, Perpignan\n\nInteractive map: Click on a destination...\n\n...for train times & fares from London, and how to buy tickets.\n\nSee detailed map of the French rail network\n\nLondon to Biarritz, Irun, Lourdes & Tarbes\n\nLondon to Lyon & Grenoble\n\nLondon to Bordeaux\n\nLondon to Strasbourg\n\nLondon to Limoges, Brive, Cahors, Toulouse\n\nLondon to Vichy & Clermont Ferrand\n\nLondon to Le Mans, Angers, Rennes & Nantes\n\nLondon to Normandy\n\nLondon to Mont St Michel\n\nLondon to Calais, Lille & Northern France\n\nLondon to Bourg St M, Chamonix & French Alps\n\nLondon to Corsica\n\nLondon to any other destination in France\n\nEurostar information & check-in procedures\n\nStarting from other UK towns & cities\n\nHow to cross Paris by metro or taxi\n\nAbout changing trains in Lille\n\nTravel to France using an Interrail pass\n\nHow to buy train tickets from UK to France\n\nTrain travel within France\n\nTrain travel in France, a beginner's guide\n\nWhat are French TGV trains like?\n\nWhat are French overnight trains like?\n\nParis to Nice by TGV\n\nInternational trains to & from France\n\nTrains to Paris from other European cities\n\nTrains from Paris to other European cities\n\nTrains from Nice to other European cities\n\nTrains from Marseille to other European cities\n\nTrains from Lyon to other European cities\n\nTrains from Bordeaux to other European cities\n\nTrains from Toulouse to other European cities\n\nTrains from Strasbourg to other European cities\n\nStation guides\n\nOther useful information\n\nUseful country information\n\nLondon to Paris\n\nBuy Eurostar tickets at www.eurostar.com\n\nBuy tickets at www.eurostar.com and print your ticket or show it on your phone in the Eurostar app.\n\nEurostar bookings open up to 6 months ahead, sometimes longer.\n\nBusiness Premier & Standard Premier = 1st class with drinks & meals. Standard = 2nd class.\n\nFor journeys beyond Paris, it can be better to book at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com, see the relevant destination section on this or other pages.\n\nTips for choosing a specific Eurostar seat\n\nAdvice on buying connecting tickets from other UK towns & cities\n\nA Eurostar at St Pancras in London.\n\nSee guide to travel by Eurostar.\n\nEurostar first class.\n\nSee tips for choosing your seat.\n\nEurostar standard class.\n\nSee tips for choosing your seat.\n\nThe cafe-bar: Each Eurostar has two café-bars serving drinks & snacks including a range of wraps & sandwiches plus hot dishes such as Chicken Tikka Massala.\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar: See the Eurostar page\n\nEurostar is the high-speed passenger train from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord via the Channel Tunnel, taking as little as 2h15 at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). Typically, 95% of Eurostar trains run on time or within 15 minutes, against just 65%-70% of flights on the same routes, it's not surprising that Eurostar now has over 70% of the London-Paris market.\n\nOption 2, by train & ferry: See the train & ferry page\n\nIt takes 9 hours and you must buy separate tickets for train, ferry & French train, there are long walks between train & ferry on both sides of the Channel and it costs more than a cheap advance-purchase Eurostar ticket. But you get to sail across the English Channel, you avoid going through the Channel Tunnel if that's an issue for you, and at short notice it can be cheaper. There's also an overnight 'sleeper' option, with a cosy cabin on the overnight Portsmouth-Caen ferry.\n\nShort breaks to Paris\n\nA short break is sometimes cheaper than booking Eurostar & hotel separately - and if you need to travel at short notice it can even be cheaper than a regular Eurostar ticket. Try these companies:\n\nRailbookers, www.railbookers.co.uk\n\nEurostar, www.eurostar.com\n\nLast Minute, www.lastminute.com\n\nOther UK towns & cities to Paris\n\nUse a London International CIV ticket\n\nAfter buying a Eurostar ticket from London to Lille or Paris, you can buy a separate ticket from most British stations to a special destination called London International CIV, designed for use with Eurostar.\n\nThese exist from most stations in Britain, they include the Underground across London to St Pancras and they generally have few or no time restrictions (so an off-peak price may apply even in the peak). You're covered by the international CIV conditions of carriage if there's a delay to the UK train and you miss your Eurostar, you're entitled to be re-booked on a later one. More about tickets from your local station to London International CIV.\n\nOr book Britain to France at www.raileurope.com\n\nRaileurope.com connects to both the British and French ticketing system, so you can book from any British station to Paris or anywhere in France as one easy transaction. It simply adds a normal domestic ticket from your chosen British station to London to an onward Eurostar from London to Lille or Paris and a French train ticket from Lille or Paris onwards. There's a small booking fee.\n\nWest of England or South Coast to Paris\n\nBy ferry+train: If you live in the West Country or along the south coast, consider a ferry crossing from Plymouth, Poole, Portsmouth or Newhaven to France, then a train onwards to Paris. Check ferry routes, times & fares at the Direct Ferries website which covers all routes & operators, or at www.brittany-ferries.co.uk, www.dfds.com or www.condorferries.co.uk. Then check UK train times from your local station to the UK port using www.nationalrail.co.uk or www.raileurope.com. Finally, check train times & fares from the French port to Paris and book online at www.sncf-connect.com, www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com. Allow at least an hour, preferably 90 minutes, between train and ferry on both sides of the Channel.\n\nBy Night Riviera sleeper + Eurostar: From Devon or Cornwall, you can also use the overnight Night Riviera sleeper train to London then a morning Eurostar to Paris, for more information see here.\n\nScotland to Paris\n\nBy daytime trains: You can buy tickets from Glasgow or Edinburgh to Paris by daytime inter-city train & Eurostar at www.raileurope.com. Or buy a separate ticket from Scotland to London International CIV as explained here.\n\nBy Caledonian Sleeper + Eurostar: A time-effective way to avoid flying is to hop on the overnight Caledonian Sleeper from Inverness, Aviemore, Aberdeen, Perth, Dundee, Fort William, Glasgow, Edinburgh to London, then take a morning Eurostar to Paris. See the Caledonian Sleeper page.\n\nBelfast or Dublin to Paris\n\nBelfast or Dublin to Paris using Eurostar, via London: You can buy a cheap SailRail train+ferry ticket from Belfast to London for around £55, or Dublin to London for 52 each way, see the Northern Ireland page or Ireland page for timetables, fares & full details. Then book Eurostar separately at www.eurostar.com, from £52 one-way or £78 return. Allow plenty of time to cross London, including time for the Eurostar check-in and any delay to your train from Scotland or Holyhead to London. When connecting with a non-changeable, non-refundable Eurostar, bear in mind that the all-weather cruise ferries are very reliable, but the fast ferries can be cancelled in bad weather.\n\nBelfast or Dublin to Paris using the Rosslare-France or Cork-France ferries, avoiding London: Travel by train from Belfast to Dublin then Dublin to Rosslare or Cork (see www.irishrail.ie), then sail either by Irish Ferries cruise ferry from Rosslare to Roscoff or Cherbourg in France (see www.irishferries.com) or by Brittany ferries (www.brittany-ferries.co.uk) from Cork to Roscoff or Cherbourg for a train to Paris (see www.raileurope.com or www.sncf-connect.com). To plan this, start by checking ferry sailing dates & times at www.irishferries.com or www.brittany-ferries.co.uk. Then work out the best connection from Dublin to Rosslare or Cork using www.irishrail.ie, then the connection from Belfast also at www.irishrail.ie.\n\nLondon to Disneyland\n\nEurostar Disney train discontinued: The direct Eurostar from London to Marne La Vallée for Disneyland Paris was discontinued in June 2023.\n\nThe alternative is to book a regular Eurostar from London St Pancras to Paris Nord at www.eurostar.com then use the RER (express metro) every 15 minutes between Paris Nord and Marne-la-Vallée-Chessy (Disneyland), changing at Châtelet les Halles or Gare de Lyon, journey time about 58 minutes, fare a few euros (see www.ratp.fr).\n\nOR you can use www.raileurope.com to book a journey from London to Marne la Vallée by Eurostar and French TGV train with one easy change at Lille.\n\nSee www.disneylandparis.com to book holidays and short breaks to Disneyland Paris, including the Eurostar, hotel accommodation and entrance to the Disneyland park or buy Eurostar tickets separately at www.eurostar.com.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Versailles\n\nThe famous Chateau de Versailles (www.chateauversailles.fr) is 30-40 minutes southwest of central Paris using a frequent express metro train on RER line C to Versailles-Rive Gauche station. Versailles-Rive Gauche is 5 minutes' walk from the entrance to the Chateau. Just buy a Eurostar ticket to Paris at www.eurostar.com then buy an RER ticket from central Paris (zone 1) to Versailles (zone 4) when you get there, the fare is just over 4 each way. RER line C runs directly to Versailles Chateau - Rive Gauche from various RER/metro stations in central Paris, including the Gare d'Austerlitz, St Michel-Notre Dame, Musée d'Orsay, Invalides, & Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel. From the Gare du Nord, take RER line B two stops to St Michel-Notre Dame, then change onto RER line C to Versailles-Rive Gauche. See www.ratp.fr for a plan of the RER & metro network You can check RER C times on this route at www.transilien.com.\n\nTip: A nicer way to reach Versailles from central Paris is to go to the Gare St Lazare and take Transilien line L to Versailles-Rive Droite. These Transilien suburban trains run every 15 minutes from platforms 1-4 at the Gare St Lazare, taking about the same time as the RER C route, but unlike RER C almost all the journey is above ground with views of wealthy Parisian suburbs, a Seine crossing, and the towers of the financial district at La Défense. You arrive at Versailles-Rive Droite which is a slightly longer walk from the chateau, but you walk through the old part of town and can enter the chateau through its gardens at the 'Bassin de Neptune' rather than through the car park as with the walk from Versailles-Rive Gauche. See www.transilien.com.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Nice & Cannes\n\nChill out by train to Nice\n\nLunch at the Train Bleu restaurant, then stroll to your TGV. There's no check-in to worry about.\n\nRelax. A table for two in first class, upper deck on a TGV Duplex from Paris to Nice, perfect.\n\nChill. Bring your own picnic & wine or visit the café-bar. You arrive in the centre of Nice.\n\nIt's easy to travel from the UK to Cannes or Nice by Eurostar and high-speed TGV, a chance to chill out with a good book and a glass of wine, and maybe have lunch in Paris on the way.\n\nWhich route to choose?\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille: By Eurostar to Lille Europe and make a simple same-station change onto a direct TGV from Lille to Marseille for an onward train to Cannes or Nice. This is the easiest option as there's no need to cross Paris, although not the most frequent or fastest.\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris: By Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, change stations in Paris by taxi or metro, then take an impressive double-deck TGV Duplex from Paris Gare de Lyon to Cannes or Nice. This is the fastest option with the widest choice of departures and it's often cheaper than going via Lille. How about lunch in Paris at the celebrated Train Bleu restaurant?\n\nOption 3, by Eurostar & Paris-Nice sleeper: Take Eurostar to Paris, have dinner at the Train Bleu restaurant then sleep your way to St Raphael (for St Tropez), Cannes, Antibes or Nice in a cosy couchette.\n\nOption 4, by Eurostar & lo-cost Ouigo train: By Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, change stations in Paris by taxi or metro, then by lo-cost high-speed Ouigo train from Paris Gare de Lyon to Nice. Ouigo fares from Paris to Nice start at only 19, but it's a no-frills train with no catering, no 1st class and airline-style baggage fees.\n\nOption 5, the ferry alternative: It's much slower than Eurostar, but if you want to avoid the Channel Tunnel, live on the south coast, or at short notice when Eurostar is expensive, it's a useful option. Travel from London to Paris by train & ferry via Dover-Calais or overnight via Portsmouth-Caen as shown here. Then take an onward train from Paris, booked at www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nFor connections to St Tropez, Juan-les-Pins, Monaco-Monte Carlo & Menton see here.\n\nWhat's the journey to Nice like?\n\nSettle into your seat and watch the scenery glide past with a glass of red to hand. From Lille or Paris to Lyon, the TGV passes farmland and picturesque villages with pretty churches. South of Lyon, the TGV flies at ground level along the Rhône Valley, crossing and re-crossing the River Rhône on dramatic viaducts, passing more pretty villages and the occasional hilltop chateau. It then passes through the hills of Provence to reach Marseille. Watch for the huge viaduct over the Rhône just before Avignon, with views of the famous Palais des Papes in the distance to the left - though if you can spot anyone dancing sur le pont d'Avignon you have better eyesight than me. You'll see the Alpine foothills in the distance to the left, and catch a glimpse of Marseille harbour with its Chateau d'If of Count of Monte Cristo fame to the right before arriving at Marseille St Charles station. If you're bound for Cannes, Nice or Monte Carlo, the scenery along the Côte d'Azur is wonderful, as the train runs along the coast past yacht-filled harbours, beaches, rocky inlets and millionaires' villas.\n\nThe Man in Seat 61 says: \"Attending a conference on the Côte d'Azur, I travelled from London to Nice by train. A morning Eurostar to Paris, lunch at the Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon, then an afternoon TGV Duplex to the South of France, with a 1st class Club Duo seat on the upper deck. Wonderful! I put my feet up & relaxed, watched the French villages of the Rhone Valley pass by, caught up on my reading & emails and watched a movie on my iPhone. To anyone who has only known the stresses of airports, flights & motorways, chilling out on a high-speed train is a revelation...\"\n\nWatch the video: On board a double-deck TGV Duplex (Paris-Nice)\n\nWatch the video: On board a single-deck Christian Lacroix TGV (Lille-Nice)\n\nFor more photos of the train ride from Paris or Lille to Nice, see the Paris to Nice by train page.\n\nOption 1, London to Nice via Lille\n\nThis is the easiest option as there's no need to cross Paris, just easy same-station changes at Lille & Marseille. It's ideal if you've luggage, kids or mobility problems. Take Eurostar from London St Pancras to Lille Europe and change onto a direct TGV to Marseille St Charles by-passing Paris, then take another TGV from Marseille to Toulon, St Raphael, Cannes, Antibes or Nice. For a wider choice of departures and in many cases cheaper fares, also check out journeys via Paris in option 2 below. Tips for changing trains at Lille. Unfortunately, SNCF discontinued the daily direct Lille-Nice TGV in December 2018.\n\nTimetable outward 2024\n\nTimetable inward 2024\n\nNotes for the timetable\n\nHow to read these timetables: It's easy, you read downwards, each column is a journey you can take.

More about TGV.\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 2, London to Nice via Paris\n\nThis is the fastest & most frequent option, if you don't mind changing trains & stations in Paris. It's usually cheaper than going via Lille, too. Take Eurostar from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord in just 2h20, change stations in Paris by metro or taxi as explained here, then take a 300 km/h double-deck TGV Duplex from Paris Gare de Lyon to Nice in as little as 5h40. A same-station change in Lille may be easier, but you'll find a wider range of departures via Paris, and usually cheaper fares available. Why not take an earlier Eurostar and have lunch at the fabulous Train Bleu restaurant inside the Gare de Lyon before chilling out on an afternoon TGV Duplex to the Sunny South of France? For an account of the journey in pictures, see the Paris to Nice by train page.\n\nTimetable outward 2024\n\nTimetable inward 2024\n\nNotes for the timetable\n\nHow to read these timetables: It's easy, you read downwards, each column is a journey you can take.

Paris Gare de Lyon station guide.\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 3, London to Nice by sleeper\n\nDiscontinued in December 2017 along with other popular French night trains, the French government has now restored the most important night train services as a climate-friendly alternative to flying. First to be restored, the Paris-Nice Intercité de Nuit made a welcome return in April 2021. Take an afternoon Eurostar from central London, dinner in Paris (see my suggested restaurants here), then sleep your way south in a couchette to Toulon, Cannes, Antibes or Nice. Why not go one-way by sleeper and the other way by TGV? Watch the video.\n\nLondon ► Toulon, Cannes, Antibes, Nice\n\nStep 1, travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, normally leaving London St Pancras at 14:31 arriving Paris Gare du Nord 17:48.\n\nEurostar has two cafe-bars, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Standard Premier & Business Premier fares include a meal with wine.\n\nTransfer from Paris Gare du Nord to Paris Gare d'Austerlitz by metro or taxi as explained here.\n\nBy all means book an earlier Eurostar and have dinner at the celebrated Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon before strolling across the bridge over the Seine to the Gare d'Austerlitz in good time for your sleeper south. Or try the floating restaurant Off Paris Seine, next to the Gare d'Austerlitz.\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to the Côte d'Azur by Intercité de Nuit sleeper train, leaving Paris Gare d'Austerlitz at 20:08 every day, arriving Toulon 07:39, St Raphael (for St Tropez) 08:33, Cannes 08:57, Antibes 09:08 & Nice Ville 09:25.\n\nThe Intercité de Nuit has 1st class 4-berth couchettes, 2nd class 6-berth couchettes & reclining seats.

Standard Premier & Business Premier fares include lunch with wine.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Cannes or Nice by sleeper train starts at 19 in a reclining seat, 29 in a 2nd class couchette or 59 in a 1st class couchette.\n\nIf you want privacy, you can book a whole 2nd class couchette compartment for 1-6 people from 150 or a whole 1st class couchette compartment for 1-4 people from 180.\n\nPrices vary like air fares, rising as the cheaper tickets are sold. Children under 4 go free, without their own seat or berth.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBook at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com, both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee or at French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nTo make sure you have at least 90 minutes between trains in Paris, I'd book London to Paris (and back, if returning), add to basket, then Paris to Nice one-way, add to basket, then Nice to Paris one-way, add to basket & check out.\n\nOtherwise the system allows as little as 40 minutes between trains in Paris, which is too tight, especially when catching a sleeper you don't want to miss.\n\nEurostar should always be booked as a round trip if you're returning, as Eurostar return fares are significantly cheaper than two one-ways, but Paris-Nice is one-way ticketed so it makes no difference whether you book a round trip as a return or as two one-ways. I find it easier to book one way at a time! By all means book one way by sleeper, the other way by TGV.\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead, sometimes less for these overnight trains. You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone.\n\nIf you want sole occupancy of a 4-berth couchette compartment for 1, 2 or 3 people, see the instructions on the Intercités de Nuit page.\n\nUsing an Interrail pass\n\nUsing an Interrail pass for a straightforward round trip from London to France usually costs more than cheap advance-purchase tickets booked a few months ahead.

There are toilets & washrooms at the end of the corridor, and free WiFi. More about intercités de nuit. Watch the video guide. Paris Austerlitz station guide.\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 4, London to Nice by lo-cost Ouigo\n\nIn 2013, French Railways launched a budget-airline-on-rails called Ouigo. Ouigo offers two lo-cost no-frills one-class trains a day from Paris to Cannes & Nice using special double-deck TGV Duplex trains with no catering & no 1st class. Like budget airlines, there are baggage limits and extra fees for large or additional bags. See more about Ouigo including travel tips & luggage limits and the Man in Seat 61's opinion of Ouigo.\n\nYou can use a Eurostar ticket from London to Paris plus a lo-cost Ouigo ticket from Paris to Toulon, Cannes, Antibes or Nice, as long as you allow plenty of time between trains in Paris, meaning 2 or 3 hours not the usual 1 hour you might allow with regular trains.\n\nThat's because Ouigo is a separate company (even though wholly-owned by SNCF French Railways). You'll have separate tickets for the Eurostar & Ouigo, Ouigo has no agreement in place with Eurostar to guarantee onward travel if there's a missed connection, unlike the Railteam arrangement which protects your connection between Eurostar and normal TGV InOui trains. So if Eurostar train runs late and you miss your Ouigo or vice versa. you may have to pay for a new ticket. It's your risk, which is why you should allow 2 or ideally 3 hours between trains in Paris, not one.\n\nLondon ► Cannes, Nice\n\nStep 1, travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, leaving London St Pancras at 10:24 arriving Paris Gare du Nord 13:50, or any earlier departure.\n\nTransfer from Paris Gare du Nord to Paris Gare de Lyon by RER express metro as explained here.\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to Nice by Ouigo high-speed train, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 16:10 daily, arriving Toulon 20:11, Cannes at 21:27, Antibes 21:39 & Nice Ville at 21:57.\n\nOuigo trains are 2nd class only with no catering, so bring your own food & drink. Remember Ouigo has luggage restrictions & extra fees.\n\nAlternatively, you can take any evening Eurostar you like to Paris, stay overnight, then take the daily 08:22 Ouigo from Paris to Cannes & Nice.\n\nNice, Cannes ► London\n\nStep 1, travel from Nice to Paris by Ouigo high-speed train, leaving Nice Ville at 06:06, Antibes 06:22, Cannes 06:24 or Toulon 07:49, arriving Paris Gare de Lyon 11:46.\n\nOuigo trains are 2nd class only with no catering, so bring your own food & drink. Remember Ouigo has luggage restrictions & extra fees.\n\nTransfer from Paris Gare de Lyon to Paris Gare du Nord by RER express metro as explained here.\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to London by Eurostar, leaving Paris Gare du Nord at 15:03 arriving London St Pancras at 16:39.\n\nAlternatively, you can leave Nice on the later Ouigo at 15:02 or Cannes at 15:32 arriving Paris Gare de Lyon at 20:38. Stay overnight in Paris, then take any morning Eurostar you like back to London.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Cannes or Nice by Ouigo starts at just 19 each way. Plus 5 baggage fee for larger bags, see the Ouigo page for full details.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nStep 1, go to www.eurostar.com and book a Eurostar from London to Paris.\n\nStep 2, go to www.sncf-connect.com and book Ouigo from Paris to Cannes or Nice.\n\nThis shows both Ouigo and regular TGVs so you can compare prices. Check baggage limits carefully, you may need to pay an extra fee.\n\nOuigo Essentiel or Ouigo Plus? If you pay the Ouigo Essentiel fare, then you can pay an extra fee to have a larger bag with you and another fee to choose a seat. If you pay the extra for Ouigo Plus, the bag fee and the seat choice fee are included, along with a faster boarding line at Paris stations and some streaming content on the WiFi.\n\nTip: Only credit/debit cards issues in European & certain other countries such as Australia & the USA are accepted for Ouigo bookings, but if you buy Ouigo tickets from www.thetrainline.com (which also sells Eurostar tickets and is easy to use, recommended, just a small booking fee to pay) you can pay via PayPal which gets round this, see the Ouigo page for more about Ouigo tickets.\n\nWhat are the trains like?\n\n1. London to Paris by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Paris in 2h20, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats and free WiFi.

Paris to Cannes or Nice by Ouigo\n\nOuigo is a subsidiary company of SNCF French Railways, set up as a budget airline on rails. It uses double-deck TGV Duplex trains, but one class only, with no 1st class, no catering, airline-style baggage limits and a 30-minute check-in. More about Ouigo. Paris Gare de Lyon station guide.\n\nBack to top\n\nOther places on the Côte d'Azur\n\nSt Tropez\n\nStep 1, travel from London to St Raphael using any of the options shown above.\n\nStep 2, travel from St Raphael to St Tropez by bus, departure every hour or two, journey time around 1h15-1h30, fare 2.10.\n\nBuses leave St Raphael bus station (Gare Routière in French, right next to the railway station) and arrive at St Tropez bus station. See zou.maregionsud.fr for bus times (English selector at the bottom of the page or click menu and look for the English selector). You can use the journey planner or click menu then schedules and enter bus 876.\n\nYou can buy a ticket on the bus or use the Zou app on your phone to buy a ticket after registering for an account, see zou.maregionsud.fr.\n\nBe warned that traffic into St Tropez in high summer can be a nightmare, with major delays. If you get a good photo of the bus, please get in touch!\n\nThere's also a ferry twice a day from April to November, see www.bateauxsaintraphael.com - much more expensive than the bus but a lovely way to make an excursion that avoids all the summer traffic.\n\nJuan les Pins, Villefranche sur Mer, Beaulieu sur Mer\n\nThese all have railway stations on the Cannes-Nice-Monaco main line, served by hourly local trains, but long-distance trains don't stop there.\n\nFor Juan les Pins, travel to Antibes as shown above and switch to a local train, these run every half hour, journey time 5 minutes.\n\nFor Villefranche and Beaulieu, travel to Nice as shown above and change to a local train, these also run every half hour.\n\nMonaco-Monte Carlo, Menton & Ventimiglia\n\nStep 1, travel from London to Nice using any of the options shown above.\n\nStep 2, travel from Nice Ville to Monte Carlo, Menton & Ventimiglia on the Italian border by double-deck TER regional train, these run roughly every half hour. Nice to Monte Carlo takes 21 minutes, Nice to Ventimiglia 48 minutes.\n\nIt costs only a few euros, check times & prices at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com. You can book London or Paris to Monte Carlo, Menton or Ventimiglia as one booking. But if necessary split the booking to allow enough time between trains in Nice.\n\nSouthbound, you only need to allow a few minutes to change in Nice, normal tariff TER tickets are good for any train and if your TGV is delayed there'll be another onward train in half an hour. Northbound, I'd allow at least 45 minutes in Nice when connecting into a TGV, in case of delay.\n\nTER trains along the Cote d'Azur\n\nDouble deck TER (Train Express Regionaux) run along the coast linking Cannes, Antibes, Juans-les-Pins, Nice, Monaco-Monte-Carlo, Menton & Ventimiglia.\n\nA double-deck TER train from Nice to Monaco & Ventimiglia at Nice Ville.\n\nUpper deck seats. These local trains are 2nd class only.\n\nScenery along the coast between Nice and Monaco.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow to buy train tickets to France\n\nYou can buy train tickets to anywhere in France, either at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nFor hotels\n\nwww.booking.com allows you to book your accommodation before train bookings open, with free cancellation.\n\nClick here for suggested hotels in Paris.\n\nOption 1, buy at Raileurope.com\n\nGo to www.raileurope.com\n\nRaileurope.com connects to the British & French ticketing systems, so you can buy all your tickets in one place, in plain English, in , £ or $. There's a small booking fee. You print your own tickets or can show them on your phone. Who are Raileurope.com?\n\nWhen does booking open?\n\nEurostar opens up to 11 months ahead. French trains usually open 4 months ahead, often longer over the summer. I'd wait until all your trains are open for sale, so you can confirm times & prices before buying a non-refundable Eurostar ticket.\n\nThere's an annual timetable change on the second Saturday in December, bookings for dates after this (including Christmas & New Year) usually open in mid-October.\n\nMore about when train bookings open. You can reserve accommodation before booking your trains risk-free using www.booking.com with free cancellation.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead\n\nFares for Eurostar & French long-distance trains vary like air fares, so book early and search for the cheapest departures. The cheapest tickets mean no refunds, no changes.\n\nOut one way, back another?\n\nBy all means go out one way & back another. Almost all European trains are priced one-way where a return is simply two one-ways. I usually find it easier to book one way at a time.\n\nHowever, Eurostar is an exception with return fares that are cheaper than two one-ways. So if you can, book Eurostar as a London-Paris round trip or a London-Lille round trip.\n\nHow to book\n\nYou can easily travel from London to most French destinations in a day and you can book that as one seamless transaction, as shown in method 1.\n\nMethod 2 gives you more control and can cope with more complex journeys, including ones involving an overnight stop in Paris on the way out or the way back, or circular journeys.\n\nIncidentally, there are no through tickets, you get a Eurostar ticket to Paris or Lille and separate onward French ticket. But connections across Paris or in Lille are protected by the Railteam/HOTNAT and AJC.\n\nMethod 1\n\n1. Set up an enquiry from London to your French destination, number of passengers, date of travel, set a suitable morning or early afternoon departure time.\n\n2. If you're returning and will also be travelling back in a single day, enter your return date with suitable morning or early afternoon departure time.\n\nOn French trains a return is two one ways. But on Eurostar, return fares are significantly cheaper than two one ways so a round trip that includes Eurostar should always be booked as a return.\n\n3. If you want to travel via Lille:\n\nA same-station change in Lille is much easier than changing stations in Paris when travelling to places such as Lyon, Avignon, Marseille, Cannes, Nice, Nimes & Montpellier, Le Mans, Nantes or Rennes. If going via Lille is an option, timings will be shown in the relevant section on this page.\n\nTo find journeys via Lille, click More options and enter Lille Europe as a via station leaving stopover duration as zero. Look in the search results for journeys that involve a change in Lille and which by-pass Paris. If necessary, try different departure times.\n\nFor places such as Orleans, Vichy, Clermont Ferrand, Limoges & Toulouse there are no direct services from Lille so it's better to go via Paris.\n\n4. If you want to travel via Paris:\n\nYou'll usually find a wider choice of departures and often cheaper fares via Paris.\n\nIf you're going via Paris, click More options and enter Paris Nord as a via station with stopover duration set to 1 hour (this guarantees a minimum acceptable 1 hour between trains in Paris) or 2 hours (a more robust connection, recommended) or (if you want to have lunch in Paris, perhaps at the wonderful Train Bleu restaurant) 3 hours. If you don't do this, the system may offer risky cross-Paris connections as tight as 42 minutes. Advice on crossing Paris.\n\n5. If you want to go out via Lille, back via Paris (or vice versa), don't add any via station. Rail Europe's system is capable of offering the cheaper Eurostar return rate even if the outward journey is London-Lille and the return is Paris-London, or vice versa.\n\n6. Run the enquiry. As a general rule, look in the search results for journeys with fewest changes, ideally 1. Add to basket.\n\n7. Check out, paying for all tickets as one transaction.\n\nMethod 2\n\nFirst, read the relevant destination section on this page and find a train service that suits you, out & back. By all means go out one way and back another, or go outward direct, back with an overnight stop in Paris, whatever.\n\nNote down each individual train you want to book, on what specific date. Then go to www.raileurope.com\n\nStep 1, book your chosen train from Lille or Paris to your French destination, one-way, and add to basket.\n\nStep 2, if you're returning, book your chosen train from your French destination to Paris or Lille, one-way, and add to basket. Confirm times.\n\nStep 3, book the Eurostar from London to Lille or Paris & back as a round trip and add to basket.\n\nEurostar return fares are significantly cheaper than two one ways, so a round trip on Eurostar should always be booked as a return.\n\nUse the suggested Eurostar times on this page as a guide, but by all means book an earlier Eurostar than the one I suggest going out, or a later one coming back, if you'd prefer a more robust connection (as I do), if the fare is cheaper, or if you want to have lunch in Paris (also me!).\n\nJust remember that with this method, it's up to you to make sure there's at least 60 minutes between trains in Paris southbound, 90 minutes northbound (including the Eurostar check-in), ideally 2 hours. In Lille, 25 minutes is sufficient southbound, 40 minutes northbound.\n\nIncidentally, you can't book an 'open jaw' return out to Lille, back from Paris so if you're going to use Method 2, stick to either Paris OR Lille.\n\nCheck out, paying for all tickets as one transaction.\n\nTravelling from the UK regions\n\nRaileurope can book journeys starting from any British station, not just London. It allows about an hour for Eurostar check-in.\n\nHowever, consider booking from London to France first, then buying a separate ticket from your local station to London. There are 2 reasons to do this: First, you might want a more robust connection between trains in London, say 2 hours. Second, Raileurope doesn't sell the special tickets to London International CIV which can sometimes save you money in the weekday morning peak, learn about these here.\n\nChild fares & infants\n\nChildren under 12 travel at the child rate on Eurostar and on French trains.\n\nInfants under 4 travel free on Eurostar and French trains, no need to buy them a ticket, just bring them along. But they don't get their own seat.\n\nTip: You can give an infant their own seat on French TGV and Intercités for 9 with a Billet Bambin. Just add the infant to your booking with their correct age.\n\nChoose an upper deck seat on a TGV Duplex\n\nAn upstairs seat gives the best views on a double-deck TGV Duplex, these operate most services from Paris to Lyon, Avignon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nice. www.raileurope.com allows you to choose upper or lower deck. Seats 11-58 = lower deck. 61-128 = upper deck.\n\nSole occupancy of a 4 or 6 berth compartment on a French overnight train\n\nOn French overnight trains you can book sole occupancy of a 4-berth 1st class couchette compartment for 1, 2 or 3 people, or of a 2nd class 6-berth couchette compartment for 4 or 5 people, by paying the Espace Privatif supplement. Unfortunately, Raileurope can't sell Espace Privatif, so book with www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com instead.\n\nCheck if a Carte Avantage will save money\n\nFrench Railways have a discount card called Carte Avantage. The saving can sometimes justify the cost of the card for just one long-distance round trip, especially if there are two of you or you're a family, or at short notice when fares are high.\n\nA Carte Avantage Adulte costs 49 for 1 year and gives you and a companion 30% off normal fares on TGVs & Intercités for one-way journeys at weekends, or for round trips which include a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night away, or at any time if accompanied by a child under 12, see more about Carte Avantage. Up to 3 accompanying children under 12 get 60% off. You also get discounts on many TER regional trains. There are also youth & senior versions, without the weekday restrictions.\n\nRail Europe can't sell tickets with Carte Avantage discount, so book with www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com instead. There's no discount on Eurostar, but you'll get any applicable discount on the French part of the journey.\n\nTo see what the saving is for your specific journey and to check if that justifies the cost of a card, go to www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com and run an enquiry without a Carte Avantage added, then run again with a Carte Avantage Adulte added to one of the adults.\n\nAfter booking, you can view & change your Eurostar seats\n\nAfter you have booked a journey between London & France using www.raileurope.com, you can go to www.eurostar.com and use the Manage booking feature to view and change your Eurostar seats, see the instructions and tips for choosing seats here.\n\nYou can also download the Eurostar app and load your Eurostar booking into it using the 6-character booking reference. You can then manage your booking in the app should you need to change it.\n\nTrain seat numbering plans: These plans may help: TGV seat numbering plans. Couchette numbering plans.\n\nLuggage limits on Eurostar & on French trains.\n\nOption 2, buy at Thetrainline.com\n\nYou can also buy tickets from London to any French destination at www.thetrainline.com.\n\nLike Raileurope, it connects to the Eurostar & SNCF (French Railways) ticketing systems so you can easily book all your tickets in one place, in plain English, in , £ or $ with overseas credit cards no problem. Who are Thetrainline.com?\n\nMost of the Raileurope booking tips above also apply to booking on www.thetrainline.com.\n\nThetrainline.com can do several things Raileurope.com can't: It can book lo-cost Ouigo trains, it can sell Espace Privatif on overnight trans, and it can sell tickets with a Carte Avantage discount (if you have such a card).\n\nThetrainline.com also lets you choose your seat from a seat map on TGVs & Intercités when booking a 1st class ticket.\n\nHowever, Raileurope.com has a killer advantage, you can specify a via station with stopover duration. This is so useful for cross-Paris journeys where you want to allow sufficient time in Paris. When using Thetrainline.com you can specify a via, but not the duration.\n\nApart from these differences you should find prices are the same on both sites, it really comes down to personal preference.\n\nOption 3, buy at SNCF-connect.com\n\nYou can also buy tickets from London to any French destination at www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nThis is French Railways (SNCF's) own website, in , prices the same as Raileurope & Thetrainline.\n\nMost of the Raileurope booking tips above also apply to booking on www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nThe advantage over Raileurope & Thetrainline is that you pay no booking fee as you're dealing directly with the train operator (Eurostar is part-owned by SNCF so www.sncf-connect.com can book this too, also with no fee).\n\nLike Thetrainline, www.sncf-connect.com lets you choose your seat from a seat map on TGVs & Intercités when booking a 1st class ticket. And it. can sell lo-cost Ouigo trains, Espace Privatif on overnight trans, and tickets with a Carte Avantage discount (if you have such a card).\n\nThe disadvantage is that it's quite not as easy to use as Raileurope or Thetrainline. It normally accepts overseas payment cards without problem (it accepts mine), but if it struggles you can always use Raileurope or Thetrainline instead.\n\nThere is no ability to specify a stopover duration, so if you use it to book from London to a French destination all in one go, check that the time between trains in Paris is at least 60 minutes. If it's less than this, or if you want more than this for a robust connection or to have lunch in Paris, you'll need to book London-Paris and Paris onwards as two separate bookings, as per method 2.\n\nOr have your trip arranged as a package\n\nRailbookers are a train travel specialist who can put together a tour, holiday or short break for you as a package with rail travel, hotels & transfers. Their website offers a range of tours, holidays & breaks to France by rail which can be customised to your requirements.

Indeed, they can organise a trip for you entirely based on your own requirements, they welcome complex itineraries! As it's a package, they'll take care of you if anything happens on one part of the trip, for example, a national strike.

Their website is www.tailormaderail.com/destinations/france.\n\nHow to buy tickets by phone\n\nIt's better to book online to avoid additional phone booking fees and so you can see for yourself which departures are cheapest for each stage of the journey. Most ticketing agencies only work office hours on weekdays, but online booking is possible 24/7. However, if you want to book by phone, see my list of UK ticketing agencies with phone numbers & opening hours.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Avignon, Aix, Marseille\n\nIt's easy to travel from the UK to Avignon, Aix or Marseille by Eurostar & high-speed TGV, a chance to chill out with a good book & a glass of wine, and maybe even have lunch in Paris on the way. It's affordable too.\n\nWhich route to choose?\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille: This is the easiest option. Take Eurostar to Lille Europe, where you make an easy same-station change onto a direct TGV to Avignon, Aix or Marseille. No need to cross Paris, ideal if you've baggage, kids or mobility problems.\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris: This offers a wider choice of departure and often cheaper fares. Take Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, change stations by taxi or metro, then take an impressive double-deck TGV Duplex from Paris Gare de Lyon to Avignon, Aix or Marseille. How about lunch at the fabulous Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon?\n\nOption 3, by Eurostar & lo-cost Ouigo train. A cheap option using Ouigo, France's budget airline on rails. This can be the cheapest option, but Ouigo trains have no first class, no catering, strict baggage limits & extra fees. Connections between Ouigo & Eurostar aren't guaranteed by the Railteam arrangement if there's a delay, so you have to allow plenty of time between trains in Paris.\n\nOption 4, the ferry alternative: It's slower, but if you want to avoid the Channel Tunnel, live on the south coast or at short notice when Eurostar is expensive, it's a useful option. Travel from London to Paris by train & ferry either via Dover-Calais or overnight via Portsmouth-Caen as shown here. Then take onward trains from Paris.\n\nOption 1, London to Provence via Lille\n\nThis is the easiest option. Take a Eurostar from London to Lille, make one simple same-station change of train at Lille onto a direct TGV to Provence, by-passing Paris. Ideal if you've luggage, kids or mobility problems. Although going via Paris gives a wider choice of departures and often cheaper fares, see option 3 below.\n\nTimetable outward 2024\n\nNotes for the timetable\n\nHow to read these timetables: It's easy, you read downwards, each column is a journey you can take. You change trains at the grey bar.\n\nAlways check train times for your specific dates using www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com, as the times shown here can vary. Don't book any Eurostar tickets until you have confirmed onward train times. Eurostar doesn't run on 25 December.\n\nShaded = time-effective journey with overnight stop in Lille. I suggest the Crowne Plaza EuroLille or Novotel Suites Lille Europe, both hotels are located at Lille Europe station with good reviews. By all means choose an earlier evening Eurostar and/or later morning TGV outbound, or an earlier afternoon TGV and/or later morning Eurostar inbound.\n\nAvignon TGV station is 3 miles from Avignon city centre & Avignon Centre station. A new rail link from Avignon TGV station to Avignon Centre station opened in 2013 and shuttle trains now run every 30-45 minutes, journey time 5 minutes, fare around 1.80.

But if fares are expensive or you need flexibility, or you live far from London, it can be a useful alternative. How to travel to France using an Interrail pass.\n\nWhat are the trains like?\n\n1. London to Lille by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Lille in 1h22, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats and free WiFi.

There's a 30-minute minimum check-in as all border formalities are carried out before you board the train. More about Eurostar & check-in procedure. St Pancras station guide. Lille station guide & tips on changing trains.\n\n2. Lille to the South of France by TGV\n\nTGV or Train á Grande Vitesse is French Railways high-speed train, with 1st & 2nd class and a cafe-bar. They come in various types, some single-deck, some double-deck TGV Duplex, you could get either on cross-France routes from Lille. Most have power sockets at seats, most now have free WiFi. The photos below show a single-deck TGV with the Christian Lacroix designer interior. The direct TGVs from Lille by-pass Paris on a high-speed avoiding line via Charles de Gaulle Airport station. More about TGV.\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 2, London to Provence via Paris\n\nThis is the fastest & most frequent option and also usually cheapest, if you don't mind changing trains & stations in Paris. Take Eurostar from London to Paris in 2h20, change stations in Paris by metro or taxi, then take a 300 km/h double-deck TGV Duplex from Paris Gare de Lyon to Marseille in as little as 3h05. A same-station change in Lille is easier (see option 1 above), but going via Paris offers a much wider range of departures and usually cheaper fares. Why not take an earlier Eurostar and have lunch at the fabulous Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon before boarding your TGV to the South of France?\n\nTimetable outward 2024\n\nTimetable inward 2024\n\nNotes for the timetable\n\nHow to read these timetables: It's easy, you read downwards, each column is a journey you can take. You change trains at the grey bar.\n\nYou don't have to book the exact Eurostar I show above as connecting with that particular TGV. Eurostar links London & Paris almost every hour, by all means book an earlier Eurostar outward or a later one back if it has cheaper fares or you want to spend time in Paris. Lunch at the Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon?\n\nAlways check times for your specific date using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com as times can vary.

The train is equipped with power sockets for laptops & mobiles at all seats in both classes, and a cafe-bar serves drinks, snacks & microwaved hot dishes. More about TGV Duplex. Paris Gare de Lyon station guide.\n\nBack to top\n\nOption 3, London to Provence by lo-cost Ouigo\n\nIn 2013, SNCF (French Railways) launched a budget-airline-on-rails called Ouigo. Ouigo operates several no-frills trains a day from Paris to Lyon, Aix en Provence, Avignon, Marseille, Nîmes & Montpellier using special double-deck TGV Duplex trains with one class, no catering, no 1st class. Like budget airlines, there are baggage limits and extra fees for large or additional bags. See more about Ouigo including travel tips & luggage limits and the Man in Seat 61's opinion of Ouigo.\n\nYou can use a Eurostar ticket from London to Paris plus a lo-cost Ouigo ticket from Paris to Avignon, Aix or Marseille, as long as you allow plenty of time between trains in Paris, meaning 2 or 3 hours not the usual 1 hour you might allow with regular trains.\n\nThat's because Ouigo is a separate company (even though wholly-owned by SNCF French Railways). You'll have separate tickets for the Eurostar & Ouigo, Ouigo has no agreement in place with Eurostar to guarantee onward travel if there's a missed connection, unlike the Railteam arrangement which protects your connection between Eurostar and normal TGV InOui trains. So if Eurostar train runs late and you miss your Ouigo or vice versa. you may have to pay for a new ticket. It's your risk, which is why you should allow 2 or ideally 3 hours between trains in Paris, not one.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nStep 1, go to www.eurostar.com and book a Eurostar from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord from £52 one-way, £78 return.\n\nStep 2, go to www.sncf-connect.com and book a lo-cost Ouigo TGV from Paris to Lyon, Aix en Provence, Avignon, Marseille, Nîmes & Montpellier from as little as 10 each way. Check baggage limits carefully, you may need to pay an extra fee.\n\nOuigo Essentiel or Ouigo Plus? If you pay the Ouigo Essentiel fare, then you can pay an extra fee to have a larger bag with you and another fee to choose a seat. If you pay the extra for Ouigo Plus, the bag fee and the seat choice fee are included, along with a faster boarding line at Paris stations and some streaming content on the WiFi.\n\nTip: Only credit/debit cards issues in European & certain other countries such as Australia & the USA are accepted for Ouigo bookings, but if you buy Ouigo tickets from www.thetrainline.com (which also sells Eurostar tickets and is easy to use, recommended, just a small booking fee to pay) you can pay via PayPal which gets round this, see the Ouigo page for more about Ouigo tickets.\n\nSome Ouigo departures leave from the Gare de Lyon in central Paris, but some go from Marne La Vallée a 45-minute 8 RER ride outside Paris. Obviously, pick one leaving from Gare de Lyon, allowing at least 2 or 3 hours between the Eurostar arrival and Ouigo departure.\n\nYou can transfer from Paris Nord to Paris Gare de Lyon by RER express metro in about 30 minutes as explained here.\n\nIf you need to transfer to Marne la Vallée, allow 3-4 hours between Eurostar arrival and Ouigo departure. To reach Marne la Vallée, take RER line B from Paris Nord to Châtelet-les-Halles, then RER line A to Marne la Vallée-Chessy. Journey time 50 minutes, trains run every 10-15 minutes.\n\nTip: In practice, I'd start with the Ouigo booking, then work backwards to find a connecting Eurostar. Do a dry run on both sites before booking for real.\n\nWhat are the trains like?\n\n1. London to Paris by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Paris in 2h20, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats and free WiFi. Standard Premier and Business Premier fares include a light meal with wine (or breakfast, on departures before 11:00).

Paris to the South of France by Ouigo\n\nOuigo is a subsidiary company of SNCF French Railways, set up as a budget airline on rails. It uses double-deck TGV Duplex trains, but one class only, with no 1st class, no catering, airline-style baggage limits and a 30-minute check-in. More about Ouigo. Paris Gare de Lyon station guide.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Nîmes, Montpellier, Carcassonne, Perpignan\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille: This is the easiest option, especially if you've lots of baggage, kids or mobility problems, as there's no need to cross Paris. Take Eurostar to Lille Europe and make a simple same-station change onto a direct TGV from Lille to Nîmes & Montpelier. Change at Montpellier for Narbonne & Perpignan, although on certain days you'll find a direct TGV from Lille.\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris: This is the fastest, most frequent and usually cheapest option, although it involves changing stations in Paris by metro or taxi. Take Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, change stations in Paris by taxi or metro, then take an impressive double-deck TGV Duplex from Paris Gare de Lyon to Nîmes, Montpelier, Narbonne or Perpignan. Change at Narbonne for Carcassonne. How about lunch in Paris at the fabulous Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon?\n\nOption 3, by Eurostar & sleeper train from Paris to Carcassonne or Perpignan: The most time-effective option! Runs on Friday & Sunday nights all year, and every day from July to early September. Take a late afternoon Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, then sleep in a couchette from Paris Gare d'Austerlitz to Carcassonne or Perpignan on the intercité de nuit sleeper train.\n\nOption 4, the ferry alternative: It's slower than Eurostar, but if you want to avoid the Channel Tunnel, live on the south coast, or at short notice when Eurostar is expensive, it's an option. Travel from London to Paris by train & ferry either via Dover-Calais or overnight via Portsmouth-Caen as shown here. Then take onward trains from Paris, booked at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille\n\nThis is the most stress-free way to travel from London to the south of France. Take a Eurostar to Lille and make a simple same-station change of train onto a 300 km/h (186 mph) TGV direct to Nîmes & Montpellier with no need to cross Paris. South of Lyon the TGV runs along the scenic Rhône Valley, crossing and re-crossing the River Rhône, flying at ground level through the hills of Provence over some breathtaking viaducts, passing pretty French villages and the occasional chateau. If you're going beyond Montpellier, watch out for your first sight of the Mediterranean coast and for the flamingos on the various étangs (lakes) which the train passes or crosses on a causeway.\n\nTimetable outward 2024\n\nTimetable inward 2024\n\nNotes for the timetable\n\nHow to read these timetables: It's easy, you read downwards, each column is a journey you can take.

How to travel to France using an Interrail pass.\n\nWhat's the sleeper train like?\n\nThe intercité de nuit overnight train has 1st class couchettes in 4-berth compartments & 2nd class couchettes in 6-berth compartments, each bunk supplied with lightweight sleeping-bag & mineral water. More about Intercités de Nuit. Watch the video guide. Paris Austerlitz station guide.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Biarritz, Hendaye & Lourdes\n\nThere are two options, both benefitting from the opening of the extension of the Paris-Tours high-speed line all the way to Bordeaux on 2 July 2017. This knocked another hour off the journey.\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris. This is the most frequent and usually cheapest option. Take Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, change trains and stations, then take a TGV Duplex high-speed train from Paris Gare Montparnasse to Biarritz or Lourdes. Times via Paris are shown below, but there are seasonal variations so check times for your date online at www.raileurope.com. Why not take an earlier Eurostar and have lunch in Paris?\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille & Bordeaux, avoiding Paris. You can take Eurostar to Lille and travel by direct TGV from Lille to Bordeaux, with (usually) another change there. This avoids the need to change trains & stations in Paris, but it usually works out more expensive. I haven't shown this option here, but you can easily check train times at www.raileurope.com - it can help to click More options and specify Lille (any station) in the via box.\n\nOption 3, by Eurostar & sleeper train. An Intercité de Nuit sleeper train runs between Paris Gare d'Austerlitz & Tarbes/Lourdes. This is the most time-effective option. I recommend dinner at the Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon before strolling over the bridge across the Seine to the nearby Gare d'Austerlitz to catch the sleeper south. Appears to have been discontinued.\n\nOption 4, the ferry alternative: It's slower, but if you want to avoid the Channel Tunnel, live on the south coast, or at short notice when Eurostar is expensive, it's an option. Travel from London to Paris by train & ferry either via Dover-Calais or overnight via Portsmouth-Caen as shown here. Then take onward trains from Paris, booked at www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nTimetable outward 2024\n\nTimetable inward 2024\n\nNotes for the timetable\n\nHow to read these timetables: It's easy, you read downwards, each column is a journey you can take. You change trains at the grey bar.\n\n* = This Intercité de Nuit runs Friday & Sunday all year, may or may not run, often only opens for booking a month ahead, what a way to run a railway!\n\ns = On Sunday mornings, the earliest Eurostar connection is at 08:12 from Paris arriving London at 09:30.\n\nSleeper = Intercité de Nuit with 1st & 2nd class couchettes & 2nd class seats.\n\nYou don't have to book the exact Eurostar I show above as connecting with that particular TGV. Eurostar links London & Paris almost every hour, by all means book an earlier Eurostar outward or a later one back if it has cheaper fares or you want to spend time in Paris.\n\nAlways check times for your specific date using www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com as times can vary. Don't book a Eurostar ticket until you have confirmed onward times. Eurostar doesn't run on 25 December.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Biarritz or Lourdes by TGV starts at 29 each way in 2nd class, 49 in 1st class.\n\nLike air fares, fares increase as the cheaper seats are sold, so book early & shop around for the cheapest departure.

But if fares are expensive or you need flexibility, or you live far from London, it can be a useful alternative. How to travel to France using an Interrail pass.\n\nWhat are the trains like?\n\n1. London to Paris by Eurostar\n\nEurostar trains link London & Paris in 2h20, travelling at up to 300 km/h (186 mph). There are two bar cars, power sockets at all seats and free WiFi. Standard Premier and Business Premier fares include a light meal with wine (or breakfast, on departures before 11:00). There's a 30-minute minimum check-in as all border formalities are carried out before you board the train. More about Eurostar & check-in procedure. St Pancras station guide.

Paris to Southwest France by TGV Duplex Océane\n\nAlmost all these trains on this route are new TGV Duplex double-deck trains with the Océane interior shown here. The trains have 1st & 2nd class with free WiFi and power sockets at all seats, and a cafe-bar. More about TGV Duplex Océane.

Above right, luggage racks upstairs.\n\nThe TGV pauses at Bordeaux St Jean en route to Hendaye.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Lyon & Grenoble\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille: The easiest option. Take Eurostar from London St Pancras to Lille Europe and make a simple same-station change onto a direct TGV to Lyon Part Dieu, with no need to cross Paris. Relax over a glass of wine as you swish past the French countryside, the green hills just north of Lyon are especially pretty. Almost as fast as flying, but far more enjoyable with no airport security queues in sight. Services with one change at Lille are shown in the timetables below. Map of Lyon showing station.\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris: Alternatively, you can take Eurostar from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord, change trains and stations in Paris, and take a TGV from Paris Gare de Lyon to Lyon Part Dieu. You need to cross Paris, but this route offers an almost hourly departure from London to Lyon and fares are often cheaper this way. You can stop off in Paris, if you like.\n\nOption 3, the ferry alternative: Slower & usually costlier than Eurostar, but if you want to avoid the Channel Tunnel, live on the south coast, or at short notice when Eurostar is expensive, it's an option. Travel from London to Paris by train & ferry either via Dover-Calais or overnight via Portsmouth-Caen as shown here.

Lille to Lyon by TGV in as little as 2h57\n\nTGV or Train á Grande Vitesse is French Railways high-speed train, with 1st & 2nd class and a cafe-bar. They come in various types, some single-deck, some double-deck TGV Duplex, you could get either on cross-France routes from Lille. Most have power sockets at seats, most now have free WiFi. The photos below show a single-deck TGV with the Christian Lacroix designer interior. The direct TGVs from Lille by-pass Paris on a high-speed avoiding line via Charles de Gaulle Airport station. More about TGV. Lyon Part Dieu station guide.\n\nOption 2, London to Lyon via Paris\n\nThis is more frequent, sometimes faster and often cheaper than going via Lille, if you don't mind changing stations in Paris by metro or taxi. If you allow an extra hour or two between trains in Paris you can have lunch at the amazing Train Bleu restaurant inside the Gare de Lyon.\n\nTrain times\n\nEurostar links London St Pancras and Paris Gare du Nord almost every hour taking 2h20. Change stations in Paris by metro or taxi, then TGV Duplex trains link Paris Gare de Lyon with Lyon Part Dieu every hour taking 2 hours.\n\nI won't list the many possible departures here, to find train times and prices via Paris, simply run an enquiry at www.raileurope.com, www.thetrainline.com or www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nAlways allow at least 60 minutes between trains in Paris southbound, 90 minutes northbound (as northbound you have to allow for the Eurostar check-in).\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLondon to Paris by Eurostar starts at £52 one-way or £78 return in standard class, £97 one-way, £168 return standard premier (1st class).\n\nParis to Lyon by TGV starts at 20 each way.\n\nLike air fares, fares increase as the cheaper seats are sold, so book early & shop around for the cheapest departure.

Eurostar opens up to 6 months ahead, but I recommend waiting until your onward train times can be confirmed before buying a non-refundable Eurostar ticket.\n\nIf making a round trip, always book London to Paris as a return journey as Eurostar return fares are significantly less than two one-ways. But Paris-Lyon return fares are simply two one-ways.\n\nIf using www.raileurope.com, click More options and enter Paris as a via station with a suitable stopover duration to allow time for lunch, or simply to ensure you have an adequate time between trains.\n\nBack to top\n\nLondon to Bordeaux\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar & TGV via Lille. The easiest option. Take Eurostar to Lille Europe in 1h30 and make an easy change in Lille onto a direct double-deck TGV Duplex to Bordeaux now taking as little as 4h26 with no need to change trains and stations in Paris. Relax over a glass of wine as you swish past the French countryside. However, although this avoids the need to change trains and stations in Paris, there are only a few options each day and most involve an easy 500m 6-minute walk between Lille Europe and Lille Flandres stations, as shown by the little 'f' against their departure time from Lille.\n\nOption 2, by Eurostar & TGV via Paris. This is the most frequent option, and often the cheapest. There are hourly Eurostars from London to Paris Gare du Nord taking 2h20, take the metro or a taxi to Paris Gare Montparnasse and hop on a TGV to Bordeaux St Jean taking as little as 2h04 since the Tours-Bordeaux high-speed line opened in July 2017. Some of these TGVs are single deck, but most are now double-deck TGV Duplex Océane.\n\nOption 3, the ferry alternative: It's slower & usually costlier than Eurostar, but if you want to avoid the Channel Tunnel, live on the south coast, or at short notice when Eurostar is expensive, it's an option.

I may have been one of the first people in history to have made a day trip from London to Bordeaux by train!
