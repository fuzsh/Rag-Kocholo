        "text": "This site contains affiliate links for which we may be compensated.\n\nI’m here to help with your Amtrak questions. Or so I thought. After someone read my How to Take Amtrak To Your Cruise Port article, she emailed me for directions from an Amtrak station either in New York or New Jersey to Cape Liberty Cruise Port in Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\nI was at a loss. But I did the Amtrak research and found out quite a bit. As a result, twice I’ve taken Amtrak to Newark, New Jersey. It’s easy and I’ll explain how to get to Cape Liberty Cruise Port by Amtrak.\n\nI’ve made the run from the Amtrak Newark Penn station in Jersey to Bayonne. Both times I went from Newark Penn station by taxi to Bayonne.\n\nI had no idea where I was going and the taxi fare cost over $50. This was pre-Uber and pre-Lyft. Now both companies service Cape Liberty and for a lot less money.\n\nHow to Go to Cape Liberty Cruise Port from Newark Amtrak Station\n\nSince Cape Liberty is mainly used by Royal Caribbean and Celebrity plus a sprinkling of Azamara, TUI Cruises and Viking Ocean, there’s not a lot of how-to information available. Especially if you travel by Amtrak.\n\nI had to dig through four seemingly buried links on Royal Caribbean’s website until I finally found some info but it didn’t include Amtrak. No wonder this woman emailed me! I’d have given up, too.\n\nHere’s what you need to know to go from Penn Station in Newark, New Jersey (NOT Penn Station in New York City!) to Cape Liberty cruise port in Bayonne.\n\nTo go from Amtrak in Newark to Cape Liberty in Bayonne, there are a handful of options. There’s the aforementioned Uber and Lyft. The distance is about 10 miles and under 30 minutes from Newark Penn station to Cape Liberty cruise port.\n\nTaxi to Cape Liberty\n\nExpect to pay in $50 plus or minus a little, plus toll (a few dollars), plus tip.\n\nUber Estimator Amtrak Newark to Cape Liberty:\n\nuberPOOL: $19-25\n\nuberX: $16-21\n\nuberXL: $24-31\n\nuberBLACK: $57-75\n\nUberSUV: $75-96\n\nLyft Estimator – Amtrak Newark to Cape Liberty:\n\nLine: $14 – shared, 1-2 seats\n\nLyft: $15-22, 4 seats\n\nPlus: $23-31, 6 seats\n\nPremier: $28-39, 4 seats, high-end\n\nLux: $64-76, 4 seats, black car\n\nLux SUV: $82-96, 6 seats, black car\n\nWhere to Stay Near Newark, New Jersey Amtrak Station\n\nIf you really want convenience, there’s a Hilton Hotel at Newark Penn Station. Arrive the night before your cruise and then late morning the next day, call Uber or Lyft.\n\nYou’ll arrive at your ship refreshed and ready to cruise.\n\nDepending upon your train departure time after the cruise, you may want or need to spend a night at the Hilton at Newark Penn Station.\n\nFinally, here are directions for DIY cruisers who arrive into New York Penn Station (NOT Newark Penn Station), are very budget-conscious and don’t mind hauling their own luggage.\n\nTake the PATH Rapid Transit System train from Manhattan to Jersey City or Hoboken.\n\nOutside the PATH Station, take the NJ Hudson-Bergen Light Rail train to Bayonne.\n\nGet off at the 34th Street Station in Bayonne.\n\nYou are now directly across Route 440 from the Peninsula at Bayonne Harbor, which includes the Cape Liberty Cruise Port.\n\nCall one of the three Bayonne taxi cab companies (or Uber or Lyft) to drive you to the cruise port, which is about two miles east of the Light Rail line."
