Today, high spring tides allow schools of alewives (herring) to swim into Bride Brook toward inland spawning grounds. The osprey, or fish hawk, is a frequent early summer visitor. In the fall, cranes, herons, and mute swans wade among cattails and rose mallow. Seasonal changes provide opportunities to fish for mackerel, striped bass, blackfish, and flounder.\n\nTypes of fish: Blackfish, winter flounder, bluefish and striped bass off the jetty. Crabbing allowed in designated areas.\n\nFishing is allowed on the jetty, located to the right of the beach, year-round. In the off-season, the entire beach and jetty is open to fishing.\n\nKNOW BEFORE YOU GO\n\nBefore heading out, be sure to check the latest conditions and fishing regulations. For current night fishing access information, please call the park during business hours at (860) 739-5471.\n\nSaltwater Fishing in Connecticut’s State Parks\n\nLicenses and permits, current regulations, and more\n\nConnecticut is Fishy Interactive fishing application\n\nSaltwater Fishing Resource Map\n\nAn ideal setting for families, Rocky Neck State Park has a wide array of interesting geological features perfect for exploring. The best geology in the park can be investigated along the water's edge near the beach, only a short walk from the parking lot. Likewise, the hiking trails in the park have nice examples of glacial plucking and glacial boulders.\n\nLoose sediments at one time covered Connecticut's coastline, including Rocky Neck State Park. This layer of loose sediments protected the seaward flank of New England's bedrock from erosion. Eventually these sediments were washed away and the bedrock underneath was re-exposed. As a result, the topography along Connecticut's coast is more level than the topography inland, since the bedrock was not exposed as long to the effects of erosion.\n\nRock Types Found on Main Trail:\n\nIgneous (Pegmatite), Metamorphic (Granitic Gneiss)\n\nRock Units:\n\nPotter Hill Granite Gneiss (Proterozoic): Well-foliated granitic gneiss\n\nMinerals of Interest:\n\nFeldspar (Microcline), Biotite, Tourmaline, Garnet\n\nInteresting Geologic Features:\n\nFolds, Potholes, Glacial Boulders, Glacial Polishing, Pegmatite Veins\n\nThe Ellie Mitchell Pavilion at Rocky Neck State Park\n\nConstruction of the Pavilion began in 1934 and was not completed until 1937. It was designed by the state parks engineering department, and constructed by a federal jobs program, the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The cobblestones all came from stone walls that were located within the park. The tree trunk pillars on both floors were taken from each of the state parks in the system at the time - one to six pillars from each park. Each pillar is stamped with a roman numeral to identify which park it came from.\n\nThe flat fieldstones on the terrace were taken from ledges in Devil’s Hopyard State Park, when the existing state highway through the Hopyard was being built. The capstones on the terrace walls, the upper deck walls, and the chimneys were quarried from the ledge east of the pavilion. The quarrying operation had left much quarried rock piled about on the ledges adjacent to the building site, when it was abandoned decades prior to the state’s acquisition of the property.\n\nThe old concrete fish mill, which sat on the flat lawn area at the edge of the water in front of the pavilion, was torn down and broken up during construction of the pavilion. It furnished fill material for the space between the front wall and the terrace, and enough 12” I-beams to support the first floor. The building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was constructed at a total cost of $240,000. All the work was done by WPA labor supervised by WPA engineers."
