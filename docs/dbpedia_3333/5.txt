Bosnian club FK Sarajevo have not given ex-Nigeria U17 star Sani Emmanuel a contract after several days of trials, AfricanFootball.com can report.

The reason Sani Emmanuel was not given a contract is unknown, but the striker has since left the club’s training camp.

The former My People Academy of Lagos player played for Beitar Jerusalem (Israel) and Oskarshamns AIK (Sweden).

His compatriot Harmony Ikande sealed a year’s contract with an option of another year with FK Sarajevo after a successful trial.
