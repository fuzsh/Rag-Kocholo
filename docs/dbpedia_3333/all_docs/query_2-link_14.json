        "text": "November 13, 2018: The night before the second relegation playoff (first leg)\n\nThe rain is beating against my bedroom window and the moonlight creeps through a crack in my blinds directly into my eyes. I pull the covers over my head and turn over in bed.\n\nIt feels much later than 6:30 p.m. The nights are long at this time of year in Sweden, but that doesn’t bother me. Outside, the weather feels perfectly attuned to my inner state: dark, damp, all alone.\n\nI try to get some rest, but I can’t. The moment my eyes close, the memories begin to play again: the ball hitting the back of the net; the final whistle blowing; the fans storming the pitch and attacking us.\n\nIf I could go back to the moment before it all fell apart and make that save, everything might be different.\n\nThat was three years ago, after my team, Helsingborgs IF, finished 14th in the Allsvenskan, Sweden’s top league. Instead of being automatically relegated like the two teams below us, we followed them down by losing a home-and-away playoff with the third-place finisher from the second tier.\n\nTomorrow I get to relive that experience. My new team, Varbergs BoIS, has finished 14th in the second tier. We will play Oskarshamns AIK, the runner-up from the third tier, in the first leg of the Superettan playoffs. For the second time in three seasons, my teammates and I will be fighting to keep our spot in the relegation playoffs.\n\nI had been thinking about this earlier in the day on the hour-long train ride home from practice. All of a sudden, my heart was pulsing and I felt a pounding pressure in my ribcage. My face tensed up, my throat sank into my stomach and I had trouble catching my breath as I tried to fight the pain radiating from my chest and out to the extremities of my body. I felt like I was overheating; sweat beaded on my brow.\n\nI had never felt anything like this before. I thought I was having a heart attack. I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs from all the pressure, but didn’t want to draw attention to myself in such a public setting. My instincts kicked in. One deep breath in, one deep breath out, over and over again. And then, as suddenly as it started, my body was back to normal.\n\nLater I learned that I was experiencing a panic attack.\n\nMy stop was next. I got off the train and stumbled home in the rain. I walked in my front door and collapsed into my wife’s arms and broke down. With my face covered in tears, and snot dripping from my nose, I could barely make out any words as I tried to describe what had overtaken me a few minutes earlier.\n\n“How on earth am I ever going to play this game tomorrow?” I asked her.\n\nShe had been by my side for a number of the ups and downs in my career, but she had never seen me like this before.\n\nShe did the only thing she could in the moment, consoling me and telling me everything would be OK no matter what I chose to do.\n\n“Should I tell my coaches and teammates about what happened to me today?” I said out loud, then completed the thought before she had a chance to respond. “No way! How would they be able to trust me after that?”\n\nI was the captain. What kind of signal would it send to the team if I didn’t show up for the most important game of the year? I had played every single minute of the season up to that point, and even though I had been far from my best, shaking up the goalkeeper position could have a catastrophic effect on the team’s psyche.\n\nNow, as I lie in bed struggling to sleep, I decide that I have no other choice but to play. I don’t want to, but I feel as though I’m backed into a corner, and I convince myself that it’s the right thing to do for the team. So the next morning I get out of bed and walk onto the team bus for the ride to Oskarshamn, where we lose, 4-2.\n\nAs a Chicago kid growing up in the ’90s, I was obsessed, like everyone else, with Michael Jordan.\n\nI zeroed in on Jordan’s successes, and in the ’90s there were a lot of them; just like Mike, I focused on every shot, kick, save or catch down to the smallest detail. He was driven and focused, and in order to be the best, I thought I needed to hold myself to the highest standard — perfection, basically.\n\nWhat I didn’t see were Michael Jordan’s failures, or how he dealt with setbacks. In training, if the smallest thing went wrong, I had to start over. I tried my hardest in every game, as we’re taught to do, but I’d be in tears when my team lost. I carried this view of sports, of life, well into adulthood. In fact there was no distinction: Sports and life were one and the same. I held my teammates to the same high standard, and when it seemed as though one of them wasn’t giving their all, I took it as a betrayal of the game, a betrayal of me, and I lashed out at them. Thinking back, I’m ashamed at what a poor teammate I was and I cringe when I recall how I handled myself when things didn’t go my way.\n\n(Photo courtesy Matt Pyzdrowski)\n\nModern society treats professional athletes like superheroes, and there is perhaps one sense in which the metaphor holds: Superheroes often have a fatal flaw that is directly linked to their superpower. In attempting to perform to perfection, I kept myself from reaching my potential. “Create your own luck,” a youth coach once told me, and a crazy work rate was the way I believed I could do that. But that belief was unrealistic. It was harmful. And it became the thing that crippled me.\n\nLooking back, my panic attack didn’t start on that train in 2018. It started two years earlier.\n\nNovember 20, 2016: The first relegation playoff (second leg)\n\nWe are lined up in the tunnel five minutes before kickoff. The referee walks between the two squads up to the front of the line.\n\nNext to us is Halmstads BK, the team trying to leap-frog us into Sweden’s top flight. We had tied the first leg 1-1 at Halmstad. They outplayed us, but that precious away goal gave us a cushion.\n\nHelsingborgs’ field coordinator begins the countdown: Ten, nine, eight, seven…\n\nThe hair stands up on the back of my neck. Chills run down my spine. A burst of adrenaline courses through my body as he approaches zero. I close my eyes and inhale deeply through my nostrils. As I exhale, a small cloud of vapor blossoms out into the cold November air.\n\nSmall drops of freezing rain begin to fall from the sky. I look down at my feet and scenes from the toughest season of my career flicker through my mind: Getting dropped after the third game of the season; a stress-induced stomach sickness that kept me out for several weeks; returning to the lineup with eight games left in the season and feeling like I was failing to live up to expectations.\n\nA sellout crowd of nearly 12,000 people is waiting for us. It feels like the whole city is here, singing the Helsingborgs anthem.\n\nJust five years ago, in 2011, they had watched our club become the first Swedish team to win the domestic treble. Now, a year after I arrived, we’re trying to avert another landmark achievement: the club’s first relegation from the Allsvenskan since 1968.\n\nI jog toward the South end, a massive wall of red-and-blue where our diehard fans stand and sing for all 90 minutes. I sip from my water bottle and spray a bit into my face and gloves. I take up my position in the goal and jump in the air twice, knees to chest. The whistle blows.\n\nThe first 45 minutes are uneventful, each team playing sideways or backward passes, afraid of pushing numbers forward and leaving themselves exposed at the back.\n\nIn the second half, everything changes. Halmstad immediately puts us under pressure as we struggle to find an answer for their overlapping runs and quick, precise passing.\n\nI try to follow every pass while keeping an eye on Halmstad’s 17-year-old winger Sead Hakšabanović. He is coming off an impressive season, one that would earn him a transfer to West Ham United in the Premier League the following summer.\n\nThe game is still scoreless in the 65th minute when he sends a perfectly weighted through-ball between our center backs, putting their striker in on goal. I know I just need to be patient and stand him up as long as possible. “Don’t gamble,” I think to myself. “Trust your work.”\n\nI close the angle as he approaches the top of the box. He shoots to my right. I dig into the turf and react, pushing the shot away from the goal. Everyone in the stadium gasps. Our fans begin to pound on the advertising signs behind the goal, attempting to transfuse a bit of life into our team. They clap and sing my name: “MATT PYZ-DROW-SKI! MATT PYZ-DROW-SKI! MATT PYZ-DROW-SKI!”\n\nI’m engulfed by a rush of energy knowing I just turned away a sure goal. I feel the muscles in my face changing. The tense and focused look suddenly turns into a giant smile. That save is going to save our season — I know it.\n\nWe break through in the 82nd minute, catching Halmstad off guard on a counter attack. Our striker puts the ball into the net from six yards out and the stadium erupts in one of the loudest cheers I’ve ever heard. Everyone in the stands is high fiving, hugging and kissing, experiencing a mix of joy and relief. I run the length of the pitch and jump onto a pile of my teammates, screaming, “We fucking did it!”\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nFour minutes later, the collapse began. A needless foul led to a penalty, and just like that the game is tied at one. Halmstad keeps pushing. In the 90th minute, one of their players receives the ball at the top of our box. He executes an impressive Cruyff turn to give himself just enough space to unleash a magnificent shot toward goal. 2-1. And that’s it: game over.\n\nOn the field, we are still processing what had just happened when some masked hooligans kick down the advertising boards at the south end and push through security while launching flares in our direction.\n\nAs soon as I see them, I grab a few of my teammates and we take off for the locker room. We understand their pain — we feel the same thing inside — but this isn’t the right way to handle it. Eight minutes earlier, the stadium had been filled with jubilation. Now everyone is crying and consoling one another in the stands while the scene on the field turns violent.\n\nInside the locker room, some guys are screaming and some are crying. Most of us are staring off into some distant place where we don’t have to confront the feelings that threaten to consume us. I’ve never been in a room filled with more disappointment, sadness, shock, regret and tears in my life.\n\nThe club chief, the board members and our coaches walk in, the repercussions of the team’s failure written on their faces. We players are thinking about the fact that we’ll be playing in the second division next year. They’re a step ahead of us: the club will lose somewhere in the region of 20 to 25 million Swedish Krona from TV and ticket revenue, several sponsorships and some of the people whose jobs had made them just as much a part of the team as the players.\n\nAs kids, we envision ourselves lifting the trophy at the end of the season, after making a winning play in the final seconds. No one practices losing in that moment. But failing — learning to lose — is a crucial skill in sports and in life, and nobody teaches it. At least, nobody taught me.\n\nWhen I see young athletes now, the thing that strikes me is how open they are with their emotions. The joy, when things go well, is unbelievable. And the disappointment, when things don’t, can be devastating. They are resilient, and can move on quickly from the highs and the lows. And if a player can channel frustration into motivation, it’s a special kind of alchemy that can lead to some amazing performances.\n\nBut when the game becomes a job, things change. Your livelihood is on the line. There’s a business built up around you, and other people — strangers, more or less — count on a good performance. You can be responsible for creating jobs. You can be responsible for losing them.\n\nThe save you didn’t make. The goal you didn’t score. The day you showed up to training and didn’t give it your all. It might have led to someone losing their job. And when you fall short, the consequences set in.\n\nThere are cutbacks. The coach gets fired. The sales team reduces its staff. The marketing department doesn’t have as much to sell as the sponsorships dry up. The stands used to be full; now, some fans continue to show up while the others do whatever else. (A decent number, it seems, occupy their time sending hateful messages to your social media accounts.)\n\nIt’s an uneasy feeling, playing a game with such fine margins and so much at stake.\n\nWhat I’ve learned is that most players don’t give much thought to this responsibility when they sign a contract. For the athletes, there is almost always another team or another league you can go to if things don’t work out. That’s not the case for everyone else at the club. Not everyone can uproot their families at a moment’s notice like many players do, and it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that it’s not only your own salary you’re playing for.\n\nIt’s often said that athletes need to forget their mistakes and shortcomings. I used to believe this as well, but the older I get, and the more I reflect on my own career, I think it’s more accurate to say that we need to learn to accept them while trying to do our best. Things won’t always go according to plan. After our relegation, this was my lesson, but it was very difficult for me to learn.\n\nOne kick of the ball changed everything.\n\nJune 4, 2017: Adjusting to life in the second division\n\nThe late-afternoon sun has begun to set behind the yellow flags waved by the home fans at the far end. The ground is hard under my feet; the grass has given way to dirt near the goal line. It’s the 83rd minute and we, Helsingborgs IF, lead 1-0. A couple of players from the opposing side, Falkenbergs FF, stand over a free kick from the top of our box.\n\nIt’s the 11th game of the season, and there is a sense of resentment and failure to accept our reality in the second tier of Swedish football. Everyone expected us to walk right through this season and immediately get promoted back to the Allsvenskan. And even though we sit in second place in the Superettan, and have yet to lose a game this year, the club and fans are growing frustrated. Things within the squad feel much worse than our position in the table would suggest.\n\nIt’s the type of situation I used to love — game on the line and a chance to be a hero — but today my legs feel heavy. My arms are slow, as though there are weights dangling from my wrists. I need to move my mouth and body, so I shout at the wall and make minute adjustments. It’s better than standing still.\n\nThe Falkenberg player approaches the ball. I tilt my head left to get a clear sight beyond the wall. He strikes the ball with the inside of his right boot. I begin to jump to my right, then back to my left.\n\n“Please go over the goal,” my mind whispers, “please go over the goal.”\n\nIf the ball misses the target, everything will be OK.\n\nBut the striker hasn’t used the inside of his foot after all. He hit it with his laces. The ball isn’t bending; it’s knuckling straight at me.\n\nLooking back, I’ll be able to reconstitute the monologue of my mind’s voice talking to my nervous system and through my nervous system to my hands and feet:\n\n“Shit! Here it comes!”\n\n“Catch the ball or parry?”\n\n“Catch the ball or parry?”\n\nI decide to catch it. Then I change my mind.\n\n“Parry it, Matt!”\n\nI bring my fists together in a last ditch effort to punch the ball away from the goal. Instead, I punch it into the back of my own net. My head turns. I register what has just happened. I sink to my knees and curl up into a ball.\n\nThere are some things you don’t forget. Some things that will forever feel like they are still happening in the moment.\n\n“What the hell just happened?”\n\nI lie on the grass totally distraught and in complete shock. One or two of my teammates came to my side to comfort me, but there was nothing they could do or say to take away the pain I was feeling.\n\nI grab the ball out of the goal and my own fans begin to throw water bottles and projectiles from the stands at me. They want me gone, far away from the club they so passionately care about. I had seen things like this happen in movies, never did I think it would happen to me. I was the good guy. I did everything the right way my whole career. I gave this club everything I ever had. I didn’t deserve this.\n\nAfter the final whistle I head straight for the locker room.\n\n“Please wake up, please wake up, please wake up. This can’t possibly be happening.”\n\nIt still seems surreal.\n\nMy teammates walk in one after another, almost everyone avoiding eye contact with me as they do. I feel like an outcast in my own locker room.\n\nIt wasn’t public knowledge yet, but 24 hours earlier I had learned that Helsingborgs would be bringing in a new goalkeeper in the summer window. I was out. I didn’t belong.\n\nThe local reporter wants to talk to me. He starts with the normal questions.\n\n“What do you think of the game? What could you, as a team, have done differently? Are you happy with the result?”\n\nI answer as fast as I can. I want to get back to the locker room, grab my stuff and get on the bus. There is a slight pause after what I think will be the final question, and then he asks me what I’ve been dreading.\n\n“Do you think the rumors of the club bringing in a new goalkeeper this summer had an impact on your performance and what happened out there today?”\n\n“OF COURSE IT DID!” I want to scream.\n\nHow could it not? My world, my livelihood, everything I’ve ever worked for feels like it’s crashing down.\n\nI stumble through a polite answer.\n\n“Of course not,” I say. “That kind of thing comes with the job. It’s my responsibility to deal with it.”\n\nI don’t believe any of it. It’s what I’m supposed to say. He smiles and thanks me for my time and we go our separate ways.\n\nDecember 2018: Survival\n\nIn the second leg against Oskarshamns we ended up winning the game 2-0 and the series on aggregate — our away goals in the first leg swung the 4-4 score in our direction. We avoided the disaster that relegation would have caused our club.\n\nI had never been one to share openly about the way I was feeling inside. The only person in my life who truly knew how bad it had gotten was my wife. After that match, she begged me to get help.\n\n“Please see a therapist or a sports psychologist and tell them how you are feeling,” she said. “I can’t stand to see you like this any longer.”\n\nMy initial reaction was defensive. “No,” I told her, “I’ll fix it myself.”\n\nI thought that asking for help would mean that I was weak, or less than I was supposed to be. I started learning this in youth sports. “Just deal with it,” our coaches and trainers would say. “Pick yourself up and fight through it.” I can’t tell you how many times I’d been told to “be a man and swallow it” over the years after making a mistake in a match.\n\nThings got worse once I became a man, and the locker room became my professional work environment. By then, I was part of the problem. There were times when a teammate would vent about how disappointed they were feeling, and several of us would shut it down. The phrases we heard our coaches saying from a young age were now coming out of our own mouths. “Just deal with it,” we’d say, or “Pick yourself up and fight through it.”\n\nOn our end, at least from mine, it came from a sense of insecurity — being uncomfortable because I didn’t know what else to say or how to act. Silence, change of topic or jokes ensued as we all tried to make light of it, or ignore it altogether.\n\nPersonally, I never felt comfortable opening up to any of my teammates due to the fear that they would judge me the way I had sometimes judged them. Even worse, maybe word would get back to the coach. I didn’t want to lose my spot in the team and the respect I had worked so hard to earn in the locker room, so I stayed quiet.\n\nBut turning inward and masking your emotions makes it easy for things to spiral out of control. And once it gets going, it is incredibly difficult to stop.\n\nLuckily, my wife was one step ahead of me. It was around Christmas when she reached out to a newly opened clinic down in Malmö that helped athletes with the psychological side of the game. They said they would help me, but that they needed to hear from me directly.\n\nAt first, when she told me she had been in touch with them, I felt a sense of betrayal, like my insides were about to explode from frustration and anger. How could the one person I cared about more in this life than anyone else do that to me?\n\nI did what I always do. I closed the blinds, turned off my phone, crawled into bed and shut out the world and everyone else around me.\n\nIt wasn’t until after the New Year that things began to change. Around Christmas, my wife had given me a sticky note with the clinic’s email and phone number. It had been sitting on my dresser since then, and every morning I ignored it… until one day, I didn’t. I was sick of looking at it, and then having her continually asking me throughout the day, “have you contacted them yet?”\n\nI sent an email. Maybe it would get lost in the queue and no one would get back to me. And if they didn’t answer, I could tell her I tried and maybe get her off my back.\n\nI got a response almost immediately. The head of the clinic sent a list of three psychologists who could potentially help me. I hadn’t really thought this through. My plan had failed. I had to send another email.\n\nUnsure of who I should contact first, I started at the top of the list: Caroline Jönsson. I Googled her to see what would turn up. If I was going to contact someone and potentially talk about my problems, I wanted to know a little about them.\n\nThe first result displayed was a Wikipedia article: “Caroline Jönsson is a Swedish former football goalkeeper who played 80 times for the Sweden women’s national football team between 1999 and 2009.”\n\n“This couldn’t be the same person… could it?” I thought.\n\nAnnoyance suddenly turned into curiosity. I had to find out if this was her. I sent the email.\n\nI got a response within a few hours. Her email profile picture was of her in a goalkeeper kit, fully extending to make a save.\n\n“Holy shit,” I thought. “It’s her!”\n\nIn her response she told me that after she retired as a player she had gone back to school to become licensed as a clinical and a sports psychologist. Suddenly I lost control of my emotions and began to cry. My entire body was shaking as the tears streamed down my cheeks and onto my computer screen. I let out a loud howl. This was not normal; there was nothing that I could do to stop it.\n\nIt seemed to come out of nowhere, though, upon reflection, I think it was me coming to grips with my reality: I couldn’t do this on my own. I needed help. Our dog rushed to my side to see what all the fuss was about.\n\n“What are the odds that her’s is the first name on that list?” I remember thinking as the dog and I attempted to calm each other down.\n\nI was still afraid of being judged, but maybe our football and goalkeeping link would mean she could actually understand me and the way I was feeling inside.\n\nI booked an appointment for the middle of January, 2019.\n\nI went into her office full of lingering skepticism, but there was an almost immediate connection between us, and once I began talking, the words just flowed. I told her about everything I had experienced over the last couple of years. In the moments when I struggled to express myself, it was as though she already knew what had happened and how I was feeling.\n\nWe met for nearly two hours but she felt we had only scratched the surface. She asked me if I wanted to meet again. I did.\n\nMy initial plan was to continue meeting with Caroline while playing out the remaining year of my contract with Varberg in 2019. However, I soon realized I couldn’t do both. It was early February when I had another panic attack, and this time it occurred on the training pitch.\n\nEarlier in the day I had taken a one-hour train ride from my home in Ängelholm for my two-hour session with Caroline. After that I grabbed another train back to Ängelholm and then continued for another hour up to training in Varberg. I was both emotionally and physically drained. There was no way I was going to be able to do this on a consistent basis. Goalkeeping and therapy were both going to be full-time jobs, and I didn’t have the time or energy to give 100 percent of myself to both parts of my life. I chose therapy. Caroline agreed this was the best course of action, and for the next several months I was put on sick leave.\n\nSummer 2019: Getting better\n\nOne of the most difficult things in life is standing completely emotionally naked in front of another human being, baring your soul, and putting your trust in them. I had only done that once before; the day I married my wife.\n\nCaroline provided the environment for me, and made me comfortable enough to face my fears and vulnerability again. She taught me that the most effective way to deal with mental health is putting your thoughts and feelings into words.\n\nMy journey has required a lot of work. There have been many tears and difficult moments. It has largely been about forgiving myself and accepting that things happened as they did. I’ve learned a lot over the past year and a half, and it has led me to something greater than myself.\n\nThough I no longer perform on a football pitch, I now have the responsibility of developing and nurturing young minds as a physical education teacher and football profile coach in school.\n\nNot long ago, we had a mental health awareness week consisting of several different activities and presentations to shine light on one of society’s major issues. One of my responsibilities was a locker-room talk. I sat with each class in a locker room, not too far from the one I used to sit in every day as a player for Helsingborgs IF, and we talked about mental health and well-being. My goal was to create an environment, much like the one Caroline helped create for me, where each pupil felt comfortable enough to share how that type of setting made them feel.\n\nAt first everything felt familiar. We sat in silence, staring at each other, waiting for someone to speak up. There were even a few kids who cracked jokes to try and lighten the mood.\n\nI decided to share a bit of my own story with them to break the ice and hopefully give them courage to open up and be vulnerable. It worked. The stories that followed, and how much each of us in that room actually had in common was amazing. Though it also made me realize how much further we still need to go.\n\nI’m not special, and I don’t pretend to be. If anything, the reason I want to share my story is because I’ve learned how prevalent, how normal, this issue is in sports and in the wider world. The reality is that you or somebody you know will suffer from some form of mental health issue, whether it’s anxiety, depression or panic attacks. We lose jobs, we lose family members and friends, we have setbacks in life: How are you supposed to handle that on your own? Many hold onto it, and keep it inside. That’s what I did, and look where it took me.\n\nOne common theme I’ve learned through all of my therapy is that it is very easy for those of us who are struggling with something on the inside to feel as though we’re the only ones going through it. That’s why it’s so important to talk about these things in the open, and share the way we’re feeling with someone we trust.\n\nSo if you’re reading this and you’re having a difficult time, no matter how big or small it may seem, I want you to know that you’re not alone. I’ve been where you are, and I want you to remember that it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. I know from experience how much of a difference it can make.\n\nAsking for help is not a weakness. It’s the definition of true strength.\n\n(Top photo: Pavel Koubek/Ombrello via Getty Images)"
