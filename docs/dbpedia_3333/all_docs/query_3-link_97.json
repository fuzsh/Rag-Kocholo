        "text": "A report in Nigeria’s ‘Sports Day’ concerning My People FC striker Sani Emmanuel and his passion for the plight of the poor:\n\nFIFA U-17 World Cup Most Valuable Player, Sani Emmanuel has declared that his long term plan in football is to channel whatever will accrue from the beautiful game into helping the needy. According to a close pal and colleague of the Golden Eaglets ace forward in My People FC, Emmanuel has said he hopes to establish an NGO or a Foundation that will cater for the less privileged in the society to be able to give back what God has given to him.\n\nEmmanuel SportsDay learnt is acting strictly on the prophesy given to him on his arrival to SCOAN few years ago by the General Overseer of the Synagogue Of All Nations (SCOAN) Prophet TB Joshua, who told the player that he will be great provided he works according to the directives from the Almighty God. The player was further told to ensure that he set up an NGO that will cater for the less privileged and the physically challenged.\n\nEmmanuel who himself has been under the care of the church (SCOAN) since his father took him there about five years ago is a case-study of how God works in the lives of His people.\n\nSays he, “when Emmanuel came here he was a nobody just like most of us who were from the suburbs and slums from all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria. Today he is one of the most sought after youths in football. That is the story we all share and hopefully he will move from grace to grace because as we pray for him we will also climb to greater heights in our chosen careers.\n\n“Emmanuel is really a child of God and since his arrival here at the Synagogue he has been working in the path of God taken all prophesies, messages and directives from the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua seriously and abiding by them. It is therefore not surprising to all of us that he has attained the height he presently enjoys. Most others will take a cue from him.”\n\nSOURCE: Sports Day\n\nExplore posts in the same categories: Uncategorized\n\nThis entry was posted on November 18, 2009 at 9:24 pm and is filed under Uncategorized.
