Lazio where he was immediately put into their Primavera side.[4] In 2012 Emmanuel signed for U.S. Salernitana 1919 of the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione on a co-owned basis from Lazio and on 9 September 2012 Emmanuel made his only appearance for the 4th tier Italian side against Chiete Calcio in which he came on in the 58th minute for Christian Chirieletti as Salernitana suffered a 4–1 defeat that day.[5]\n\nFC Biel-Bienne (loan)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 February 2013, it was announced that Emmanuel had signed with Swiss Challenge League side FC Biel-Bienne on loan for the rest of the season.[4] He made his debut for the club on 16 March 2013 against Wohlen in which he came on in the 72nd minute for Ramon Egli as Biel-Bienne lost the match 1–0.[6]\n\nOn 12 May 2013, Emmanuel scored his first professional goals in a league match against FC Wohlen in which he scored a hat-trick to lead Biel-Bienne to a 7–0 victory.[7] He scored two more goals for Biel-Bienne on 30 May 2013 against FC Winterthur as the club 2–2.[8]\n\nBeitar Jerusalem\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2014 Sani signed with Beitar Jerusalem.[9] Three weeks later, after playing only 24 minutes for the club, Sani was released by Beitar Jerusalem, with the club stating that the coach was not excited by Sani and that he did not feature in future plans.[10]\n\nAfter leaving Beitar Jerusalem, Emmanuel had a trial at Bosnian side, FK Sarajevo, but failed in his attempt.[11]\n\nIn November 2019 ex-teammate Ogenyi Onazi helped pay for Emmanuel's medical expenses. Emmanuel was to undergo surgery for achilles tendonitis.[12]\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nEmmanuel rose the prominence during the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup which was hosted in his home country Nigeria. Emmanuel finished the tournament with five goals being the joint top-scorer and won the Golden Ball as he helped Nigeria to a runners-up finish behind Switzerland.[13]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 14 April 2021[14]\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League Domestic Cup League Cup UEFA Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Salernitana (loan) 2012–13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione 1 0 0 0 0 0 — — 1 0 FC Biel-Bienne (loan) 2012–13 Swiss Challenge League 10 5 0 0 0 0 — — 10 5 Beitar Jerusalem 2014–15 Israeli Premier League 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Oskarshamns AIK 2015 Swedish Division 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 Career total 16 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 16 6\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
