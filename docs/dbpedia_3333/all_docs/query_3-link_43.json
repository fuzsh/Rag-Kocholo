        "text": "On the surface, Koudo Ikusei Senior High School is a utopia. The students enjoy an unparalleled amount of freedom, and it is ranked highly in Japan. However, the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top? [Written by MAL Rewrite] https://lnkd.in/ghKAqVgQ\n\n\"The Universe doesn't like secrets; it conspires to reveal the truth to lead you to it.\" – Lisa Unger I love how this quote suggests that the natural order of things tends to favour transparency and truth, implying that hidden truths will eventually become known 👉 their nature is that 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘥! And if we know how to interpret the language of the Universe, we'll understand that everything we experience is a breadcrumb towards the truths that give all of life meaning. From my experience, I agree, and now on this planet more than ever 👉 Truths want to be Revealed. And our personal, societal and collective discomforts, frustrations and challenges are usually indication that the next revelation wants to take place! 💡 Centuries ago, 𝗺𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 held the keys to these profound spiritual and personal truths, they guided seekers on paths of self-discovery and enlightenment. Some of the most well known mystery schools come from ancient Egypt to Greece but they existed across the globe. They nurtured those yearning for deeper knowledge not just by sharing information; but as gateways to 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 where initiates explored metaphysical concepts and spiritual practices. Mystery schools emphasised the development of mind, body and soul in a way that uncovered greater truths about the Universe and oneself; which the initiate would learn are one and the same. The different paths and levels of initiation ensured that the process was paced, integrated and that the teachings would be used in a constructive way. Fast forward to today, and the essence of these ancient teachings is more relevant than ever as guiding paths through a smorgasbord 'personal development' and 'consciousness expansion' offerings. If you'd like to know more about the online school: The White Rabbit Reveals, which is in many ways a Modern Day Mystery School, DM me, I'd be happy to tell you more about it. 🥁 This week we'll be launching news of an exciting Shamanic Training event taking place in Switzerland this Summer! Stay tuned 🤗 #ModernMysterySchool #AncientWisdom #SelfDiscovery #HolisticHealing #TheWhiteRabbitReveals\n\n📚🍎 **Embracing Rumi's Wisdom in Education** 📚🍎 Rumi's profound philosophy can light the path of education.

Unfold your own myth.\" Inspire creativity and independent thinking. Encourage students to create their own stories, ideas, and solutions. 🌟 2. **#FollowYourPassion** - \"Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.\" Help students discover their true interests. When they pursue what they love, success and fulfillment follow naturally. ❤️ 3. **#InterdependenceIsReality** - \"Do not be a lone tree. Interdependence is the nature of reality.\" Emphasize teamwork and collaboration. Working together and supporting one another enriches the learning journey. 🤝 4. **#BornWithWings** - \"You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life?\" Encourage students to aim high and have confidence in their abilities. They can achieve greatness! 🚀 5. **#TheWoundIsWhereLightEnters** - \"The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\" Teach resilience and the power of learning and growing from challenges. Adversity leads to personal growth. 💪 Incorporating Rumi's wisdom into education creates an inspiring environment where students explore their potential, learn from life's experiences, and soar to new heights.
