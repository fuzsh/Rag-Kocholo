        "text": "Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour\n\nJust when you feel we are going to leave Sollentuna with a morale-boosting point, Täby fall to an 89th minute winner for the hosts.\n\nBut it is an evening that offers a lot of encouragement. Täby start with all three of their recent signings – Hugo Jesslén, Isak Bråholm and Yosef Aksoy – the latter having only arrived earlier in the week from Umeå FC – and the trio immediately inject fresh energy into the team.\n\nThe hosts take the lead mid-way through the first half, but you can see Täby growing into the game and starting to enjoy more possession.\n\nAnd soon after the interval Viktor Sluug sets up Lukas Sunesson, who is smartly into position to slot home his ninth goal of the campaign, keeping him in joint fifth position in the league scoring charts.\n\nTäby look really lively and more than once go close to a second so it’s a heartbreaker to go down to that late goal.\n\nHowever – and I don’t think this is just blind optimism – I get a feeling that the team are in a better place than for some time. Not only do we have the new guys on board but with others back or on their way back from injury, there’s competition for places right down to the bench spots that hasn’t been there earlier.\n\nWhat’s more, I can see that Dali Savic is going to get his team to fight fire with fire in the weeks ahead. On his LinkedIn page, Dali says that his football philosophy is “Southern (Balkan) creativity with Swedish structure,” and signs of a bold approach are already becoming evident.\n\nI am sure he would love to have more time to put his ideas into place but that’s going to have to be done ‘on the job’. As I mentioned last week this was the first of four ‘cup finals’ for TFK in terms of getting some points on the board. We’ll have to cross the Sollentuna result off and move on. But I think when the troop goes into training next week it will be in an upbeat mood.\n\nIn other news, attacking midfielder Oliver Granberg has decided to move on elsewhere – he always performed for Täby with a lot of energy and we wish him well for the future.\n\nNext up is a trip to Athletic Eskilstuna on Saturday. Their home ground of Tunavallen appears to be an absolutely cracking venue to visit so I am especially looking forward to this one.\n\nWe now face the season’s most critical weeks. We really do. And here’s why.\n\nAt risk of stating the most obvious thing since words were invented, Täby FK need to start putting points on the board. And in the coming four games they travel to Sollentuna (11th in the table at the time of writing), Athletic Eskilstuna (12th), then home matches versus Stocksund (10th) and Friska Viljor (13th).\n\nWhen those games are done there will be just 10 to go and seven of those are against sides currently in the top half of the table. If the team haven’t established some sort of base camp in terms of points by then well quite frankly it’s going to require a sensational performance to climb out of the bottom three.\n\nIf Täby are to have any chance of preserving their Ettan status they are going to need to be averaging at least a point a game over the whole season come judgement day in November. To start moving towards that Täby need to collect at least 6 and ideally 7 or more points from the coming four matches.\n\nIn an ideal world I feel that Dali Savic and his coaching team would like nothing more than a few weeks to work on getting the team to where they want it to be through a series of training matches. Of course that’s simply not possible and they’ll have to work with the harsh reality of the situation.\n\nThat was reflected on Saturday with a very tough re-start to the campaign as TFK went down 0-7 to high-flyers Nordic United. A team looking to find its way out of the woods against a very settled unit who are riding on a huge wave of success.\n\nEven in the face of such a big reverse I admired the way the lads kept up the fight in the face of an impossible task. It takes character to do so and Lukas Sunesson – who never stops running for the cause – and Conrad Johansson both deserved to get on the scoresheet.\n\nNext Friday evening sees us travel to local rivals Sollentuna for the first of those four games that I see very much as being like four cup finals – games that if we win we have every right to have a little celebration, but if we lose we immediately chalk it off and move on to the next.\n\nIn other developments, according to the channel FotbollDirekt, Täby are set to acquire the services of highly-promising striker Hugo Jesslén, who was a prolific scorer for Europa Point FC in Gibraltar under the leadership of Dali Savic last season.\n\nAlso, Fredrik Johansson, who joined Täby at the start of the season, has returned north to rejoin Piteå IF where he enjoyed success for several seasons. While Fredrik definitely showed his considerable experience in midfield for Täby, for whatever reason he didn’t perhaps make as much impact as might have been anticipated, so hopefully he will thrive again back up north.\n\n…but divided we fall.\n\nAfter Täby FK’s warm-up game against IFK Haninge on Saturday, another fan drew my attention to the fact that things have not been as they should be at the club.\n\nOf course I knew about the team’s performance and changes in the coaching set-up but I hadn’t realised that feelings had run so high.\n\nThere’s no point tip-toeing around the subject. For better or worse it was brought into public view through an article in fotbollsthlm.se.\n\nI’m just a supporter who wants to cheer the lads in the matches and have no connections at all to the inner workings of the club so I am definitely not going to comment on that. What I will say is that there’s no professional sports club on planet Earth that hasn’t faced some bumps in the road along its way.\n\nIn a results-driven environment like football you’re always going to experience some turbulence when things don’t go according to plan. What matters is that any issues are addressed as soon as possible. I hope that’s already been the case. Because otherwise, as sure as night follows day, they end up having wider unwanted effects.\n\nYou hear a lot in sport about the ‘one percenters’ – small things that have a significant positive effect on a team’s performance. That applies off the pitch as well as on it. It’s no good creating one percenters in the matches if there is a minus 10 percenter somewhere else.\n\nIt’s vital that everyone unites behind the team. When a side is doing well they don’t need external support so much because the positive energy is generated on the pitch and in the changing room. But when things go wrong the lads need to get energy from the people around them.\n\nEvery person I have taken along to watch Täby FK has made the same observation – that they are so impressed with the skills shown by the players.\n\nAs I watched the game on Saturday it also struck me how much talent there is out there. Each and every one of our young and even not so young players who took to the field has the potential to make it as a full-time professional.\n\nSo yes, there’s still plenty to be positive about. It was great to see some of the guys returning after injury. Gustav Odenlind made an immediate impact with his trademark attacking flair in his first start since April. And Abbe Kamnelius, who has effectively been sidelined since May of last year, made a most welcome return to action off the bench.\n\nWhat’s already happened can’t be altered and we now need to get behind the new coaching team led by Dalibor Savic. As expected, we’ve also now appointed a new assistant coach. Nisse Johansson enjoyed a stellar playing career with among others, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and nearly 300 games for AIK. Needless to say he brings a great amount of experience and knowledge.\n\nDalibor is already putting his contacts to good use and the club has signed Isak Bråholm, a swift-footed midfielder who although still only 23, is relatively experienced and comes to Täby from Ettan rivals Assyriska.\n\nNext Saturday the serious stuff resumes with a very tough assignment against Nordic United. It’s going to need patience and a lot of hard work to make great things happen again. But if we stand together, our time will come.\n\nSummertime and the livin’ is easy. Well, sort of…\n\nIt’s all change at Täby FK. Lukas Syberyjski has been relieved of his duties as head coach and Dalibor ‘Dali’ Savic is the new man at the helm.\n\nWhile Dali’s coaching career to date has been mostly in his native Sweden he comes to TFK after two interesting appointments abroad – firstly with HB Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands and mostly recently in Gibraltar with Europa Point FC, a club with strong links to Sweden.\n\nI wasn’t surprised to see the change because the league table tells its own story with Täby occupying the bottom position. Dali will bring a fresh outlook and can instil new energy and belief into the troop.\n\nWhat’s more, goalkeeping coach Joakim Sternas has taken up the opportunity of a full-time position with Akademisk Boldklub in Denmark, and assistant coach Mehran Shadidipoor has also moved on, so we will doubtless be seeing more new faces in due course.\n\nThere’s no point sugar-coating the task ahead as the team will probably need to win around half its remaining matches to climb into the safety zone. At the same time there is exactly half the season to go and without doubt we have a talented squad.\n\nThat group has officially been strengthened by the addition of four academy graduates – Gabriel Kalaitzidis, Léon Sy Birgersson, Martin Danev and William Hjälte. Gabriel and Leon have already shone for the first team and it’s great to see these guys stepping up.\n\nThe other main news is that Täby didn’t pull out a plum draw in the second round of the Swedish Cup, but will be playing the marvellously-named IK Oddevold after our first-round win against IK Franke (our team for that match pictured above). That’s still a tough assignment as it’s a club from the division above but it will be a game in which the lads will feel they can compete strongly. I’m really looking forward to that August evening under lights at Tibblevallen.\n\nDid you watch much of Euro 2024? The highlight for me was Ollie Watkins’ winning goal for England against the Netherlands in the semi-final. Aged 28, Ollie is a now a star performer for Aston Villa in the Premier League but seven years ago he was still with Exeter City in League Two, the fourth tier of English football.\n\nOllie’s ascent shows how a player can progress from relative obscurity to the very top – at the age of 20 he was still fighting to establish a regular starting place at Exeter. With hard work and determination, anything is possible.\n\nNext Saturday Täby get back into action with a warm-up game against IFK Haninge at Tibblevallen. The combination of difficult to attend fixtures in June, obligations at the summer house and the mid-season break means that it will be the first match I have seen since June 9. I certainly feel refreshed and eager to get back to watching the lads in action.\n\nZinedin Smajlovic to Lecce in Italy. David Mikhail and Victor Ekström to the Allsvenskan with IFK Värnamo and IK Sirius respectively. And Teo Grönborg moving up a division to Degerfors IF in Superettan.\n\nThose players all made the news over the past 12 months when they left Täby FK to join clubs at a higher level. But what about the guys that moved on but didn’t hit the headlines?\n\nHere’s a round-up of the destinations of some of the players who represented Täby FK’s senior side in 2023 and have since wound up elsewhere. Note I don’t claim it to be a comprehensive list, and also I haven’t included players who came to the club on loan.\n\nOne move that is interesting is that of striker Samuel Dawid Rydz switching to Hammarby TFF, Hammarby’s development club, in early 2024. Samuel has so far been involved in every match for his new club, either starting on or on the bench, in a squad where there is no doubt a lot of competition for places.\n\nTwo players have moved “just up the road” with Jonathan Andreasson and Lukas Sietsema joining Division 2 club Österåker United FC in the close season. Left-back Jonathan, who came through the youth ranks at Täby, quickly established himself as a regular starter at Täby’s near neighbour. Lukas has returned to his parent club and the swift-footed midfielder has also cemented a starting slot.\n\nActually sharing the same ground as Österåker is Division 3 club Åkersberga, which was the destination of another fleet-footed midfielder, Sylvin Kayembe, but he has made just one brief appearance so far where he came on as substitute but went off soon afterwards, so it looks as if he is currently sidelined.\n\nHowever, there is better news from the same club of Dennis Milivojevic, who has been a regular starter at Åkersberga this season. Dennis previously had a spell with Division 3 club IK Frej Täby FF in 2023, which he joined from TFK in last year’s summer transfer window.\n\nAnother player who moved on from TFK last summer is striker Tekin Olgun, but injury restricted him to just a couple of appearances for Division 2 club Enskede IK in 2023. However, he made a welcome return to action this year for Botkyrka Kuluspor in Stockholm’s Division 6, scoring in each of the four matches he started.\n\nUnfortunately Tekin tells me he has since ruptured a hamstring, so we wish him all the best in his recovery.\n\nJonathan Tesfay and Zack Lindgren, who both joined TFK from Sandvikens IF to strengthen the squad last summer but didn’t stay on beyond 2023, have secured regular starting places at Ettan clubs. Jonathan is playing for Oskarshamns AIK in Ettan Södra, while Zack is with Assyriska in Ettan Norra.\n\nFinally, goalkeeper Filip Lindblad, who was a regular on the bench for TFK in the second half of the 2023 season, moved to IK Frej Täby over the winter and is their number one choice between the posts.\n\nWho is Britain’s greatest downhill skier? And what the heck has that got to do with Täby FK?\n\nKonrad Bartelski produced a stunning performance in the men’s World Cup downhill race at Val Gardena, Italy, in December 1981, finishing in second place, just 0.11 of a second behind race winner Erwin Resch (you can watch it here if you are really curious).\n\nAt first glance it appeared to be such a shock result that a French television commentator exclaimed “Ce n’est pas possible! C’est un anglais.” But in fact, it was very much possible.\n\nBartelski had been an accomplished competitor at the top level for many years, but fitted the stereotype of the plucky Brit, often finishing in around 30th place rather than second. If you think that doesn’t sound like much to crow about, bear in mind that such a finish, often only two or three seconds behind the winner, basically makes you the 30th best skier on planet Earth.\n\nAnd after Val Gardena, Bartelski didn’t drop back down to 30th – he produced four more top 15 finishes to show he had every right to be part of downhill skiing’s elite group.\n\nHow is this relevant to Täby FK? Well, the current Ettan Norra table doesn’t lie, and the team currently stand in 15th place out of 16 after Sunday’s 1-2 home defeat to a well-organised IF Karlstad.\n\nYet I don’t think anyone would disagree that we have a group of really talented players. On their day they can match anyone in the league, but how can the team ‘do a Bartelski’ and make that step up to being one of the best?\n\nWhen asked what went right after all those years, in a recent interview with Source magazine (read it here) Bartelski tellingly says: “I always thought I had to do something more to ski faster. It turns out, what I actually needed to do was relax.”\n\nNo doubt the Täby coaching team are working tirelessly to find the formula for success.\n\nOne thing that has certainly worked against them is injuries. Gustav Odenlind is on the mend after taking a hard blow at Assyriska in April while Noel Berg and Abbe Kamnelius have been sidelined for much longer, going back to the first half of 2023. It’s great to see these guys regularly come along to encourage their team-mates from the stands, as I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be for them not to be out there in the thick of the action.\n\nThe lads now have two long trips north in succession – to Piteå IF and Friska Viljor FC. I would have loved to have made it to one of these but unfortunately this is the one and only part of the fixture list that hasn’t worked at all in my favour – had the Friska Viljor game been on another weekend I would very much have been up for it.\n\nHowever, please stay tuned as I still have what I hope will be an interesting blog for you lined up in the coming weeks.\n\nWhat an uplift.\n\nFive days, two wins, and my mood is completely transformed. I wake up with a spring in my step – so heartfelt thanks to all the players who secured a 2-0 victory against AFC Eskilstuna at Tibblevallen on Sunday.\n\nIt is a game which, as my fellow Täby supporter Ian points out, features two extraordinarily parallel halves. The first 45 minutes sees Eskilstuna start the brighter before Täby work their way into the contest and are rewarded when an overhead ball into the box by Alfons Lohake is met by a crisp header from Lukas Sunesson to put us ahead.\n\nAfter the interval Eskilstuna start out as the more dangerous side but Täby weather the storm and effectively seal the win when once again a lofted ball, this time from Leonard Kleist (pictured taking a throw-in, above), finds Sunesson who outsmarts the defence to slot home.\n\nSo some trademark clinical finishing from Sunesson to take his season’s tally to six but also as with every win it’s down to teamwork. You can see the defence growing in confidence under the leadership of Erik Kask, who along with Erik Johansson Olsson and Abiel Sequar, light the spark under the attacking moves.\n\nWhat’s more, keeper Leo Iacobaeus has another fine game to keep the door closed on Eskilstuna and the midfield put in a great shift under an energy-sapping sun.\n\nAnd over a celebratory How To Be A Bastard beer (yes, really) at a restaurant in Täby I check the league table to see the result’s effect – and it raises us three places to 13th.\n\nAs a supporter, it kind of goes with the territory to be constantly looking at tables, fixtures and results and wondering how it’s all going to play out.\n\nNow I know that head coach Lukas Syberyjski’s mantra that he doesn’t care about the league table at all until November is the right way to go – but an integral part of being a fan involves staring at the standings at regular intervals, even sometimes when no more matches have been played.\n\nI just can’t help it.\n\nIt tastes so sweet to win again.\n\nThe highlights of my adventures are often expeditions to clubs outside Stockholm and this one certainly delivers. The occasion is the Swedish Cup first round, where we travel to IK Franke of the Second Division, who play at the small venue of Råby on the outskirts of Västerås, an hour’s train ride from the capital.\n\nOn a perfect late spring evening at an attractive ground bordered by trees, the first piece of good news is that Täby put out their strongest possible team – and from the outset it is clear that they intend to take control of the game.\n\nAt half-time it is still 0-0, though we have chances and the ever-dangerous Lukas Sunesson hits the woodwork. The lads continue to press after the break and on 69 minutes, Léon Sy Birgersson (pictured on the ball, above), who has a great game down the left side, hits a powerful shot into the far corner of the net.\n\nThree minutes later and another rocket makes it 2-0 with Leonard Kleist (pictured on the left, above), who impresses all evening, deservedly getting on the scoresheet.\n\nIt is nearly three when another thunderbolt, this time from Conrad Johansson, hammers against the underside of the crossbar but somehow doesn’t go in.\n\nThe score stays at 2-0, a confidence-boosting victory and it’s going to be exciting to see who we get from one of the higher divisions when the second round draw is made.\n\nThere are other plusses. Two players who have been involved in college football in the USA make a welcome return. Goalkeeper Fredrick Grundin, of Penn State Nittany Lions, goes straight into the starting 11 and has a solid night between the sticks.\n\nIn addition, midfielder Adam Zenzén, who has been shining as a regular starter for Dayton Flyers, comes on for the final 15 minutes. It’s a real boost to get these two talented young players back into the troop.\n\nAnd in the closing minutes, Hugo Norrlin and Gustav Olsson get their first taste of first-team action to complete a perfect evening.\n\nIf you really want to absorb information properly, then you should read it printed on paper.\n\nMy better half subscribes to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, which quite brilliantly is delivered outside our door at around 4am every morning. As far as I’m concerned by far the best thing about the paper is that when they are in the right mood they print the Ettan Norra league table in the sports section on Sundays or Mondays.\n\nSo as I examined the standings this morning over my tea and toast what struck me was the huge gulf that has already emerged between the sides at the top and those in the lower regions. Nordic United have won 9 out of 10 games and Umeå FC 8 out of 10.\n\nBut at the other end of the table (at the time of writing) you have to add up the total number of victories from the bottom six sides just to get up to a total of 9 wins between them.\n\nNo-one can deny it’s been a tough period for Täby FK. But the upshot of the above is that we are still only two points off the safety zone. And coming up next Sunday is a huge home game against AFC Eskilstuna, who have also made a stuttering start.\n\nHowever, ahead of that is a Swedish Cup match against Division 2 club IK Franke on Wednesday evening – something that brings both opportunities and challenges.\n\nThe cup draw is seeded, so whoever wins is guaranteed a home tie in the second round against a team from the higher leagues of Superettan or Allsvenskan. When Täby made the second round in 2022, 600 fans came down to Tibblevallen to watch us play Allsvenskan side Norrköping in a significant event for the club.\n\nAlso, a win on Wednesday would provide an injection of confidence ahead of Sunday. Now first of all, I don’t believe in momentum in sport. That’s because momentum suggests that if you win a game or two, some unspecified force somehow gives you an advantage going into your next match.\n\nHowever, confidence is another matter; it’s something every player thrives on and I think it’s fair to say that winning builds confidence.\n\nAt the same time one challenge is that we already have an injury-hit squad, so the coaching team have some tough selection decisions to make. And I am reasonably certain that IK Franke will put out their strongest side for what is a big game for them. But we also have motivation for the reasons stated above and in any case you always want to win.\n\nThankfully I don’t have to make such decisions – the only one I had to make was whether to travel to Västerås on Wednesday, and that came easily, so I’ll be cheering our team on.\n\nMeanwhile, although the lads went down by a solitary goal to FC Stockholm at Kanalplan on Saturday, it was a very encouraging performance in which we battled to the line against a team which boasts deep resources.\n\nOur official player of the match, keeper Leo Iacobaeus (pictured above, centre), made a string of world-class saves that even drew praise from some of the FC Stockholm match stewards, and his game is going from strength to strength.\n\nDespite the loss I feel the performance was also one the players drew confidence from, so as always let’s march on together.\n\nHow can we create a better match environment at all levels of football? This vital subject was placed in focus by an initiative across Swedish football for ‘a better match climate’ during this weekend’s round of matches.\n\nIt’s a really wide-ranging topic so I won’t delve in much here but I do believe this is something where we should be setting the bar very high.\n\nOne broad aim has to be to make the match day environment as warm, welcoming and inclusive for supporters as possible. Some progress has already been made across the sport but there is still a lot more that can be done. This in turn brings us onto the related subject of how we can attract more people to games, something that I intend to explore in detail in the future.\n\nOn the pitch there was indeed a good atmosphere for Täby FK’s long-awaited return to the grass at a Tibblevallen, which was looking very smart in the sunshine but unfortunately the team went down to a 1-4 defeat to Örebro Syrianska.\n\nWith several key players missing it is proving challenging to match settled sides with plenty of experience in their ranks but it is not all doom and gloom. Our young team didn’t give up in the face of such difficulties and kept battling to the final whistle.\n\nIt was good to see some new faces getting involved, with 16-year-old Kajetonas Motuzas shining after coming on as a sub and encouraged by his watching academy team-mates. In addition, Léon Sy Birgersson, a strongly-built 18-year-old, made a bright debut from the bench.\n\nIt is not at all easy to come into a match when the game is realistically lost and substitutes Allen Smajic and Conrad Johansson (pictured second and third from left above) did a great job in such testing circumstances, with the former pulling a goal back and Conrad playing assertively and showing that his long throw-in is a really effective asset.\n\nReturning to the match-day climate it was good to see the players warmly applauded at the end despite the result. When things are challenging it is up to us supporters to do just that – support and get right behind the lads and that’s what we’ll continue to do. Let’s move on to the next match together."
