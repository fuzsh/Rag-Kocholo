Thank you very much, brother. May God continue to bless you. The surgery is scheduled for 2nd of December 2019,”an elated Emmanuel wrote on his Intagram page.\n\nOnazi who was part of the Eagles team that won the 2013 AFCON in South Africa, also recently returned to football after a six-month injury lay off due to an achilles injury.\n\nIf you use the quotes from this content, you legally agree to give www.brila.net the News credit as the source and a backlink to our story.
