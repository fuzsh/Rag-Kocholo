        "text": "Ground: Lindsdals Idrottsplats\n\nVisits: 1\n\nDate: 24th August 2013\n\nMatch: Lindsdal - Oskarshamns AIK 1-1 (Division 2 Södra Götaland)\n\nAttendance: 541\n\nMost teams in Division 2 Södra Götaland are from Skåne meaning Lindsdal and Oskarshamn are two clubs with long away journeys. Lindsdal is around 60 km south of Oskarshamn and it is not difficult to understand which match I should visit at Lindsdals IP. I went to the reversed fixture in June but bad weather back then meant \"only\" 371 turned up for that match. Lindsdal normally have crowds of 150-200 but this sunny Saturday afternoon I was hoping for at least 500 to show up. I left Kristianstad shortly after 11am and 2,5 hours later I was in Lindsdal. Lindsdals IP is quite close to the motorway (and only 3,5 km from Guldfågeln Arena in Kalmar) and I had no problems finding the ground. The ground has an artificial pitch and is quite basic with only one proper stand. Behind the goal on the south end of the ground there is a club house with dressing rooms etc. The only stand is on the west side of the ground. I counted to around 250 seats but unfortunately there is a flood-light right in front of the center of this stand.\n\nAs kick-off approached my hope of at least 500 in attendance seemed to be fulfilled. The attendance was later announced as 541 which by far is Lindsdal´s best league crowd this year. The weather was quite nice and decided to stand in the sun for the first half of the match. Plenty of dogs and children in the crowd and this was clearly a family day-out. The match itself was quite good but it was still 0-0 at half-time. Both teams and their chances though. In the second half Lindsdal finally manged to score, 1-0 to the home team in the 57th minute. Oskarshamn were top of table before this match and with plenty of teams only a couple of points behind them they couldn´t afford to lose points. They equalised in the 67th minute and both teams then pressed on for a winner. The last 15 minutes were quite entertaining but neither team could find the net again and the \"E22-Derby\" finished 1-1. My visit to Lindsdal mean I now only have one ground, Helenholms IP in Malmö, left to complete this league. I was hoping to visit the derby between Prespa Birlik and Rosengård next weekend. That match has now been moved to Malmö IP though meaning I have to wait a few weeks before completing Division 2 Södra Götaland.\n\nWelcome to Lindsdal\n\nView of Lindsdals IP\n\nSouth End\n\nWest Stand\n\nA closer look...\n\nNorth End\n\nEast side\n\nPlayers entering the pitch\n\nView of play\n\nWest Stand\n\nWest Stand\n\nKick-off\n\nNorth End\n\nDog\n\nNice weather!\n\nView of play\n\nCorner, Lindsdal\n\nView of Lindsdals IP\n\nEast side\n\nPano\n\nPano"
