        "text": "Noah Lyles, Kishane Thompson and Marcell Jacobs all progressed to the men’s 100m semi-finals as a handful of outside contenders made statements in the heats on Saturday (3 August) at Paris 2024.\n\nThe fastest overall time was posted by the United States' Kenneth Bednarek and Fred Kerley (both 9.97), and the pair will be out to upset compatriot Lyles on Sunday.\n\nReigning world champion Lyles was the 12th fastest overall (10.04), and beaten in his heat by Great Britain’s Louie Hinchliffe (9.99), the 22-year-old Brit trained by Olympic legend Carl Lewis.\n\nJacobs, who has endured an injury-hit three years since winning 100m gold at Tokyo 2020, also finished second in his heat (10.05) behind Nigeria’s Kayinsola Ajayi (10.02).\n\nThompson of Jamaica, meanwhile, is the fastest man this year and ran exactly 10 seconds to win the first of eight heats.\n\nOnly Cameroon's Emmanuel Eseme (9.98) and Jamaica’s Oblique Seville (9.99) joined the U.S. pair and Hinchliffe in going sub-10 at the Stade de France, while just 0.1 second split the top 18 sprinters.\n\nThe men’s 100m semi-finals take place on Sunday (4 August) at 19:05 local time, with the final later that evening at 20:50.\n\nFull athletics schedule at Paris 2024\n\nNoah Lyles: ‘I’m ready to transcend the sport’\n\nParis 2024 men's 100m heats\n\nThe big names certainly did not get it all their own way in the heats, which once more played out in front of a packed Stade de France crowd.\n\nFor his part, Thompson delivered as expected in the opening heat, the Jamaican hopeful – who ran a 2024 best of 9.77 in the Jamaican trials in June – crossing the line in exactly 10 seconds.\n\nIt was then the turn of Kenya’s Ferdinand Omanyala, who like Thompson has gone quicker than Lyles this year with a 9.79.\n\nOmanyala won his heat with a 10.08, and told Olympics.com afterwards: “It was nice. I had a great time here today and I’m looking forward to tomorrow. It’s amazing, I’m just hoping we give the crowd a show tomorrow. I’m feeling great.”\n\nTeam GB's Hinchliffe stuns Lyles\n\nThere was then a shock in the third heat, with Hinchliffe quicker out the blocks and going 0.06 seconds faster than Lyles, who will be out to lay down a marker in Sunday’s semis.\n\nHinchliffe told Olympics.com: “I had to get my revenge from London, it was a great feeling. I’m not trying to get too far ahead of myself, it’s only the first round. It doesn’t matter, this time, you’ve just got to focus on the next race.\n\n“I go in every race to try and win it. Hopefully that leads to the result I want.”\n\nA quick fourth heat then saw Seville post 9.99 ahead of Japan’s Abdul Hakim Sani Brown (10.02), with Ajayi then pipping Olympic champion Jacobs in the fifth.\n\nThe joint-fastest times were then set in the seventh and eighth heats by Americans Bednarek and Kerley.\n\n“It felt great, it felt easy, 9.97, I’m happy about that,” Bednarek said. “The track feels fast, there’s going to be some fast starts.”\n\nKerley added: “I did what I always do, I’m good to go. [The crowd] is beautiful.”"
