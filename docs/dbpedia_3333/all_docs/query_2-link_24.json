        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tennessee – The party in Downtown Memphis continues Saturday afternoon as Memphis 901 FC returns home to AutoZone Park to face Birmingham Legion FC.\n\nKickoff for tomorrow’s match is set for 3:00 p.m.\n\nMemphis (1-6-2, 5 pts) plays in its third match in a week Saturday, wrapping up one of the busiest stretches of the season. The club aims to capture its first home win of 2019, something that’s just barely eluded 901 FC in the early half of the season.\n\nMemphis is coming off a narrow 2-1 defeat against back-to-back league champions Louisville City FC on Tuesday. That match was one of eight so far this season against Top 15 opponents in the USL Championship, according to the latest league power rankings.\n\nBirmingham (3-3-1, 10 pts) travels to the Bluff City for the first time, looking to bounce back after a 5-0 loss to Eastern Conference leaders New York Red Bulls II. Following that result, Birmingham dropped back into the bottom half of the standings as the club, along with Memphis, fight for a Top 10 spot (playoff position).\n\nPrior to Saturday’s kickoff, U.S. Men’s National Team legend and 901 FC minority owner Tim Howard will take part in 901 FC’s prematch guitar smash. Before every home match this season, a different figure has smashed a guitar on the field right before kickoff to culminate pregame ceremonies and hype the crowd for the start of the match.\n\nHoward, a Memphis resident, is one of the most decorated American soccer players in history. The legendary goalkeeper has represented the United States Men’s National Team at the highest levels starting in two FIFA World Cups, amassing 121 caps and setting a World Cup record for most saves in a single match, with 16 against Belgium in 2014.\n\nHoward joined his current squad, the Colorado Rapids, in 2016 after enjoying a fruitful career in the English Premier League with top clubs Manchester United and Everton.\n\nSingle match tickets for Saturday are available both online and at the AutoZone Park box office.\n\nSeason tickets, group tickets, and 7 Match Flex Plans are also available for purchase, with full season tickets starting at just $10 per match.\n\nCall (901) 721-6000 or go to https://www.memphis901fc.com/tickets for more information on all ticket options.\n\nFor the latest information on Memphis 901 FC, visit https://www.memphis901fc.com and follow the club on social media on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nMEMPHIS, Tennessee – The party in Downtown Memphis continues Saturday afternoon as Memphis 901 FC returns home to AutoZone Park to face Birmingham Legion FC.\n\nKickoff for tomorrow’s match is set for 3:00 p.m.\n\nMemphis (1-6-2, 5 pts) plays in its third match in a week Saturday, wrapping up one of the busiest stretches of the season.

The club had a few chances early, but Louisville midfielder Magnus Rasmussen capitalized on a loose ball on the turf in the 33rd minute, giving the hosts a 1-0 advantage at halftime.\n\nForward Lucky Mkosana would extend the lead for Louisville (4-3-1, 13 pts), putting the club up 2-0 in the 61st minute, tapping in a cross from teammate Abdou Mbacke Thiam.\n\nThiam would end up on the scoresheet 10 minutes later, however it’d make the match 2-1 as his attempted clearance found the back of his own net.\n\nFollowing a few tactical changes, Memphis created a few more chances on goal but could not even the score.\n\nTuesday night was the second match in 72 hours during one of the busiest weeks of the season. It was also against the sixth opponent ranked inside the Top 15 of the latest league power rankings.\n\nSaturday night did offer a few bright spots for 901 FC. Midfielder Morgan Hackworth played in his first competitive pro match against his father, Louisville head coach John Hackworth.\n\n901 FC goalkeeper Scott Levene also earned his first start this season for the club from the Bluff City.\n\nMemphis will now shift its focus as it returns home to face Birmingham Legion FC on Saturday at AutoZone Park.

The club had a few chances early, but Louisville midfielder Magnus Rasmussen capitalized on a loose ball on the turf in the 33rd minute, giving the hosts a 1-0 advantage at halftime.\n\nForward Lucky Mkosana would extend the lead for Louisville (4-3-1, 13 pts), putting the club up 2-0 in the 61st minute, tapping in a cross from teammate Abdou Mbacke Thiam.\n\nThiam would end up on the scoresheet 10 minutes later, however it’d make the match 2-1 as his attempted clearance found the back of his own net.\n\nFollowing a few tactical changes, Memphis created a few more chances on goal but could not even the score.\n\nTuesday night was the second match in 72 hours during one of the busiest weeks of the season. It was also against the sixth opponent ranked inside the Top 15 of the latest league power rankings.\n\nSaturday night did offer a few bright spots for 901 FC. Midfielder Morgan Hackworth played in his first competitive pro match against his father, Louisville head coach John Hackworth.\n\n901 FC goalkeeper Scott Levene also earned his first start this season for the club from the Bluff City.\n\nMemphis will now shift its focus as it returns home to face Birmingham Legion FC on Saturday at AutoZone Park.

Although I’m very disappointed that the Memphis fans won’t get to see him score his trademark spectacular goals for 901 FC, I am massively grateful that we figured this out before his health was compromised.\n\n“I wish him, his wife and children all the best.”\n\nIn all, Cordovés wraps up his career with a combined 36 goals for club and country going down as the most prolific Cuban goalscorer the USL Championship has ever seen.\n\nCordovés will be Memphis 901 FC’s honorary captain Saturday night when the club takes on his former club, the Charleston Battery at 7:00 p.m. at AutoZone Park.
