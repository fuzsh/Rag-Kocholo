        "text": "2009 U-17 World cup top scorer Sani Emmanuel has not been offered a contract by Latvian side FK Jelgava after a two weeks trial.\n\nHe was widely tipped to secure a deal with the Latvia based side but the club presented their list of players for the new season to the press and the Nigerian wasn’t listed a clear sign his period of trial wasn’t successful.\n\nThe former Lazio youth teamer has had a topsy turvy career since leaving Lazio in 2011 loan spells at Salernitana in Italy,Biel-Bienne of Switzerland and Beitar Jerusalem of Isreal didn’t provide the lift his career needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23 year old Sani last season played just 50 minutes of top flight football appearing four times as a substitute for Swedish side Oskarshamns AIK.\n\nThis is about the second time in a space of two years he has reportedly fail trials after he was refused a contract by Polish side Lechia Gdansk after a trial in 2013.\n\nHowever he is a free player and can still move before the end of the season although that looks unlikely and even if he does it might be to teams outside mainstream Europe."
