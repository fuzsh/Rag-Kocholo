        "text": "A story in today’s Vanguard regarding the desire of Nigerian starlet Sani Emmanuel to start a foundation for less privileged youths and use every proper means to discover the talented ones…\n\nMOST Valuable Player, MVP, and Silver shoe winner of the FIFA U-17 World Cup, Nigeria 2009, Sani Emmanuel, has dedicated his award to less privileged youths as he also promised to fund a foundation that would cater for them.\n\nSani, a product of My People FC, a club owned and funded by Pastor TB Joshua of Synagogue Church of All Nations made the pledge yesterday in a Thanksgiving Service which was attended by former Zambian President Frederick Chiluba among other dignitaries. In an emotion-laden voice, Sani whose life typifies that of rags to riches said that he would use whatever God gives him in football to touch the lives of others.\n\n“I came from nowhere before TB Joshua catered and nurtured me into prominence. I promise to also help others of my type.” Also speaking, Goalkeeper of the Eaglets who could not control tears said that he conquered injury through the prayers of TB Joshua to become the number one goalkeeper of Eaglets. “My case was hopeless as I left hospital. My coach gave me four days to recover or be thrown out of camp. But through the help of Wasiu, Pastor Joshua promised to pray for me. It was like a miracle when I woke up one day and could not realise I had injury.”\n\nPastor Joshua said that what was important for the players was discovery more than the trophy and promised that some of the players of the U-17 would play themselves into reckoning in World football."
