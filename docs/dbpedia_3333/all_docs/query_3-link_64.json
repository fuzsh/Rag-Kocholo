However, I firmly believe that leadership, like any other skill, can be nurtured and honed. The journey of a leader is one of constant evolution - adapting to new challenges, learning from failures, and inspiring others to achieve their full potential. Engaging in self-coaching practices allows leaders not only to refine their skills but also to cultivate a mindset geared towards growth and resilience. By embracing a culture of continuous learning and self-improvement, anyone can embark on the path to becoming an effective leader. What steps will you take today towards enhancing your leadership capabilities? Let's discuss strategies for self-coaching that can propel us forward in our leadership journey. ðŸŒ± #LeadershipGrowth #SelfCoaching #ContinuousImprovement\n\nWhen you take the WHY.os pill and suddenly go from 'What am I doing?' to 'I've got this!' #PurposeDrivenLeadership Ready for a leadership transformation?

The framework below helps illustrate that we need to consider change leadership when dealing with shifts that are disruptive to predictable patterns and/or when working on changing mindsets.
