        "text": "Muscovites with ''check coupons,'' a special currency available to Soviet citizens who work abroad, had a choice Monday morning of the latest Toshiba and Panasonic color television sets at the electronics store on Astrakhansky Pereulok.\n\nAcross town at the Orbita electronics store, which accepts only rubles, the selection was limited to notoriously unreliable Soviet sets.\n\nAt the Beryozka store on Bolshaya Gruzinskaya, shoppers with D coupons, another kind of official currency, could select from beef fillets, tongue, kidneys, liver, brains, ducks and geese. At the state store half a block away, a long line of customers with rubles waited to buy bologna.\n\nAs these shopping scenes suggest, the ruble, in use since at least the 13th century and minted regularly since 1704 under Peter the Great, is becoming the currency of last resort for many Russians. Liability and Embarrassment\n\nAs Mikhail S. Gorbachev moves to modernize the Soviet economy, with plans to reorganize banking and credit, the low standing of the ruble is a liability and an embarrassment.\n\nThe most valued commodities, including the best cuts of meat, the freshest vegetables, the finest fur coats, the purest vodka and the most sophisticated electronic equipment, can be bought most easily with foreign currencies, including the dollar, or with coupons issued by the Government.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
