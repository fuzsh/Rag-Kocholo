Rossiyskaya respublika) or West Russia, was a republic established by the German Empire in 1949 out of the western zone of the occupied Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union. It was a federal semi-presidential republic, comprising the European sections of Russia, bordering from the northwest to southeast, Kingdom of Finland, United Baltic Duchy, Belarusian People's Republic, Ukrainian State, Democratic Republic of Georgia, Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Kyrgyz Republic, and Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Turkmenistan, Turkestan Republic and the Siberian Republic. With a population of 242,402,000 people in 1990, it was the fourth or fifth most populous nation in the world at the time. In 1991, after the ousting of the Republican government, the Northern Eurasian states formed the Russian Federation with the unification of the Russian, Siberian and Far Eastern Republics.\n\nThe Russian Republic was the largest, most populous and the most powerful puppet-state of the German Empire, being the leading member state of the German-led military alliance, the Warsaw Pact. The Russian Liberation Army were among the most powerful military forces in the world, third only to the Imperial German Army and the Imperial Japanese Army. Much of the Russian Liberation Army's weapons and equipment were manufactured in both Russia and the German Empire. The Russian economy was a national socialist-oriented market economy, dominated by sectors such as petroleum industry, heavy industry, information technology (IT), and the Russian defense industry. Russian Republic was the wealthiest nation in the Warsaw Pact, was one of the wealthiest nations in the world, and by 1990 it was the third largest national economy in the world. The Russian Republic was the fourth largest arms exporter in the world (after German Empire, Empire of Japan and United States). Despite being a puppet-state, the Russian Republic had in 1990 the fourth largest military expenditure in the world at $156 billion. It was a recognized global emerging superpower, despite being a puppet-state. It was also one of the world's leading recognized energy superpowers, thanks to its vast reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. It had the largest and most technologically advanced petroleum industry in the world which played a major role during the Cold War."
