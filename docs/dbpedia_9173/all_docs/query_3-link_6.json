        "text": "The history of the hryvnia, Ukraine’s legal tender, can be traced back to the 8th and 9th centuries when it was used as a unit of weight and for counting during trading and paying tributes. Initially, the name for this currency was derived from the word ‘hryvnia’, which meant a decorative item worn at the nape of the neck in Kyiv Rus times.\n\nThe establishment of a national currency was crucial to the formation of an independent Ukrainian state during the years 1917-1921 when the country fought for its freedom.\n\nThe Kyiv branch of the Russian State Bank was officially recognised as the state bank of Ukraine by a law enacted by the Central Council on 22 December 1917. The bank, headed by Mykhailo Kryvetskyi, was instrumental in the development of the country when, on January 5, 1918, it issued a 100 karbovanets currency.\n\nOn the 1st of March 1918, the Central Council passed legislation establishing the hryvnia as the primary unit of currency; it consisted of 100 shahs and was worth half a karbovanet. In April 1918, Pavlo Skoropadsky overturned this judgement and reintroduced the karbovanets as the primary tender. The effigy of the Hetman was printed on banknotes in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 1,000 karbovanets.\n\nWith the overthrow of his dictatorship and the advent of the Directorate led by Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Symon Petliura in December 1918, the hryvnia was reinstated as the country’s official currency. Between 1917 and 1921, 24 distinct paper banknotes were introduced into circulation during this turbulent time.\n\nOn January 10, 1992, the government took the first steps towards establishing its own currency by releasing reusable vouchers into circulation. As a result, on November 12, 1992, the Ukrainian karbovanet was officially recognised as currency across Ukraine.\n\nThe final push to full independence came with a currency reform in 1996, the introduction of the hryvnia as Ukraine’s national currency. The National Bank of Ukraine issued the first banknotes, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 hryvnias, for general circulation.\n\nSymbolically, this new currency was marked with a cursive Cyrillic letter г similar to a mirrored letter S with a double horizontal stroke, known as the hryvnia sign, symbolizing stability and progress moving forward, a sentiment that many Ukrainians embraced. What began as a symbol of promise has opened new opportunities for commerce and investment both within Ukraine and beyond its borders.\n\nWhether you are visiting Ukraine for business or pleasure, it is important to understand the tipping customs of the country, as this can be an area that causes confusion. Knowing when and how much to tip can help ensure you are respectful of local customs while still rewarding friendly service. Let’s take a look at what is customary in Ukraine. Here are some general guidelines on tipping in Ukraine:\n\nHotels: If a hotel includes a service charge on your bill, then no additional tip is expected. However, if you received particularly excellent service from staff during your stay, you may wish to leave an additional tip in recognition of their efforts\n\nRestaurants: Tipping isn’t part of the culture in Ukraine, but some restaurants may expect tips from tourists. If you would like to show your appreciation for good service, tipping around 10% is considered appropriate\n\nSpas: If you visit a spa in Ukraine and receive satisfactory service, a tip of around 10% of the cost of your treatment will be appreciated by the therapist. You can either tip directly or via reception when paying for your treatment\n\nTour Guide: A tour guide who has provided helpful and informative services throughout your stay should be rewarded with a tip equivalent to $15 – $20 per day per person. This will demonstrate gratitude for their efforts while also providing them with extra compensation for their time and knowledge shared with you throughout your travels in Ukraine.\n\nTaxi Drivers: Tipping taxi drivers isn’t required in Ukraine, however, if you feel like you had a great ride and would like to show your appreciation with a tip, then that’s okay too! A simple round-up of the fare will usually suffice. It isn’t necessary to add a percentage on top of the fare as tips.\n\nBudget\n\nTo travel to Ukraine on a budget, we would suggest allowing ₴880-980 (AUD $36-40) per day. Accommodations such as staying in hostel dorms will help to keep costs low, while you can save on meals by preparing them yourself. Taking advantage of the range of free activities like walking tours and hikes available is also a great way to stretch your budget further. Visiting more economical attractions such as museums or galleries is another viable option. Finally, make use of local transportation to cut down on transport costs.\n\nModerate\n\naiming for a moderate budget of around ₴2,500-2,700 (AUD $102-110) per day will provide ample opportunity to experience the local culture. Accommodation can range from budget-friendly hotels to Airbnb, while meals out might well be the highlight of any stay as traditional cuisine is affordable and highly tasty. Taking advantage of guided tours will show off its best sites, while taxis and public transport are straightforward avenues for getting around. And for the truly adventurous traveller, a tour of Chernobyl will surely make for an unforgettable journey.\n\nLuxury\n\nFor those who wish to travel to Ukraine and have a luxury stay, then budgeting of at least ₴5,000 (AUD $203) or more per day is recommended. With that amount, you can comfortably stay in a hotel, have the option to explore any restaurant, take taxis or rent a car, enjoy higher-end guided tours, and partake in all your favourite activities while in the country, such as skiing, taking domestic flights within Ukraine, visiting various castles and museums. The possibilities for luxury are nearly endless when travelling in Ukraine with a generous budget."
