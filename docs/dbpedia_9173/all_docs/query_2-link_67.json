        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe European Union, United Kingdom and United States have adopted sanctions as a central part of their response to the Russia's invasion in Ukraine followed by many other countries. Members and assureds with vessels calling at ports in Russia or engaging in trade with Russian cargo should ensure that no sanctioned individuals, entities or activities are involved. The lists of parties sanctioned by the EU, UK and US have been steadily expanding and it is essential to check the latest lists (see Links section).\n\nThe US authorities adopt the approach that designations extend to any entity owned or controlled by designated persons. Similarly, EU Regulations apply to funds and resources \"controlled by\" listed persons and prohibit making funds available to such persons \"directly or indirectly\".\n\nIn addition, sectoral sanctions have been introduced targeting -inter alia - the energy sector with restrictions affecting the supply of certain services relating to oil exploration and production.\n\nIn view of the increasingly tense political climate, it is likely that sanctions will continue to be extended and the situation remains fluid.\n\nInsurance cover\n\nThe Association's Rules contain a standard exclusion for liability for liabilities, costs or expenses where payment by the Association or the provision of cover may expose the Association to the risk of being subject to a sanction, prohibition or any adverse action (Rule 30.4.6). Liability is also excluded when there is a shortfall due to an inability to recover reinsurance or pool contributions from other insurers or P&I Clubs which are themselves unable to pay due to sanctions legislation (Rule 32.6). The Association is also able to terminate cover where a Member has exposed or may expose the Association to the risk of being or becoming subject to a sanction, prohibition, restriction or other adverse action by a state or international organisation or competent authority (Rule 3.3.2a). Similar provisions exist in the Terms & Conditions for non-mutual covers.\n\nWe note that many sanctions regulations now introduce a prohibition on insurance and reinsurance, limiting the scope of assistance the Association can provide to its members/assureds and may trigger the insurance exclusion.\n\nReinsurance\n\nSanctions can cause possible shortfall due to irrecoverable reinsurance contributions from reinsurers. If there is no liability under an LOU or blue card, as per Rule 32.6 and equivalent in fixed T&Cs, the member will be unable to recover from the Association and the member bears the shortfall.\n\nOther challenges\n\nMembers should also be aware of the potential for practical difficulties involved in making payments in connection with the lawful Russian nexus trade. This is the case even where the Association's cover otherwise remains in place.\n\nProvision of security for a claim, providing assistance through its network of local service providers and making payments may be severely affected by the risk appetite of its business partners, such as its banks. Many international banks have imposed restrictions on processing payments with Russia. It can not be guaranteed that such prior agreement can be obtained in every instance or without delay.\n\nUS\n\nOn 22 February 2022 OFAC made a number of new designations of various entities in the Russian financial sector pursuant to Executive Order 14024 (\"E.O. 14024\"). The designations target Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank (\"VEB\") and Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company (\"PSB\"), which OFAC has identified as critical participants in the Russian financial and defense sectors.\n\nOn 25 February 2022 OFAC designated Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov and members of the Security Council.\n\nUS has further imposed stringent export controls on 49 Russian military end-users, which have been added to the BIS Entity List. See Final Rule. Additional export controls have been implemented through a policy of denial on sensitive technologies that support Russia's defence, aerospace and maritime sectors, including semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors.\n\nOn 3 March 2022 The State Department designated SMP Bank, 19 individuals and 7 connected entities pursuant to E.O. 14024.\n\nOn 8 March 2022 US President Biden signed an Executive Order 14066 which bans:\n\nimportation into the US of Russian: crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products;\n\nnew investment in Russia's energy sector by a US person/entity; and\n\nany approval, financing, facilitation or guarantee of a transaction by US person/entity of a transaction by a foreign person/entity that would be prohibited under this E.O. if made by a US person/entity, or within the US.\n\nOn 11 March 2022, President Biden issued a new Executive Order that imposes further trade and financial sector restrictions relating to Russia prohibiting:\n\nImportation into the US of fish, seafood, and preparations thereof, alcoholic beverages; and non-industrial diamonds of Russian Federation origin:\n\nExportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the US, or by a US person, of luxury goods (such as high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, jewellery and other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites).\n\nNew investment in any sector of the Russian Federation economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a US person (note that no sectors yet of the Russian economy blocked from investment under this EO);\n\nExportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a US person, of US dollar-denominated banknotes to the Government of the Russian Federation or any person located in the Russian Federation.\n\nOn 31 March 2022 US Treasury Secretary as issued a Determination which extends the application of Section l(a)(i) of Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 to the aerospace, electronics and marine sectors of the Russian economy. OFAC has also designated 17 entities and 10 people pursuant to this Determination for involvement in sanctions evasion networks and technology companies operating in military and defence sector.\n\nOn 7 April 2022 OFAC under EO 14024 designated Alrosa, the world's largest diamond mining company, and redesignated United Shipbuilding Corporation as well as its subsidiaries and board members.\n\nOn Tuesday 28 June 2022, the US Departments of Treasury and State imposed further Russia sanctions, for details please see State Department Press Release & Factsheet, Treasury Press Release & Notice, White House Factsheet.\n\nPursuant to E.O. 14024, OFAC has listed 70 entities, including State Corporation Rostec, the listed entities are said to be critical to Russia's defence industrial base and/or operating in the Russian aerospace, defence and related materiel sector, financial services or technology sectors.\n\nOFAC has also issued a Determination pursuant to Section 1(a)(i) of E.O. 14068 which extends the import ban on Russian-origin products to gold.\n\nOn 24 February 2023, the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US Department of State and the US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on numerous additional individuals, entities and vessels that the US has determined are engaged in sanctions evasion. Full details can be found here.\n\nFinancial Services Sanctions\n\nOFAC has designated over a dozen Russian banks and financial institutions which include:\n\nCredit Bank of Moscow Public Joint Stock Company\n\nJoint Stock Company Commercial Bank Lanta Bank\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Commercial Bank Metallurgical Investment Bank (Metallinvestbank)\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company MTS Bank\n\nNovosibirsk Social Commercial Bank Levoberezhny Public Joint Company\n\nBank Saint-Petersburg Public Joint Stock Company\n\nJoint Stock Commercial Bank Primorye\n\nSDM-Bank Public Joint Stock Company\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Ural Bank for Reconstruction and Development (UBRD)\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Bank Uralsib\n\nBank Zenit Public Joint Stock Company\n\nFor details of Russian oil price cap sanctions imposed by the US, please see a separate section below.\n\nUK\n\nAs a general reminder, UK sanctions apply to all persons within the UK and to all UK citizens and UK incorporated entities (including their branches) wherever they are in the world.\n\nOn February 22, 2022 UK issued a Notice designating 5 Russian banks and 3 oligarchs. The sanctions have been imposed pursuant to the recently amended Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855).\n\nDesignated banks: IS Bank; Rossiya Bank; PJSC Promsvyazbank; JSC Genbank; Sberbank; and JSC Black Sea Bank Development and Reconstruction.\n\nDesignated people: Gennadiy Timchenko; Boris Rotenberg; and Igor Rotenberg.\n\nOn 25 February 2022 OFSIadded Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov to the list of persons subject to an asset freeze in the UK.\n\nAlso OFSI issued Notice designating 5 additional persons and several legal entities including VTB Bank.\n\nUK has also issued a General Licence: Russian Banks – UK subsidiaries – Basic needs, routine holding and maintenance and the payment of legal fees, authorising until 1 March 2023 VTB Capital and its UK subsidiaries to make payment for its basic needs, reasonable fees or service charges.\n\nOn 1 March 2022 UK amended Russia Sanctions authorising:\n\ndesignation of vessels/ships for the purposes of the new shipping sanctions;\n\ndeny access to UK ports by Russian ships, unless in case of emergency;\n\ndetention of Russian ships or specified ships at UK ports or anchorages;\n\ncontrol the movement of Russian ships, ships owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person/entity or a person/entity \"connected with Russia\", and\n\ndeny the registration of ships on the UK Ship Register where they are owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person/entity or a person/entity \"connected with Russia\", or specified by the Secretary of State.\n\nUK also prohibited providing financial services for the purpose of foreign exchange reserve and asset management to any of the following entities or any person owned/controlled directly/indirectly by the persons or acting on their behalf:\n\nthe Central Bank of the Russian Federation\n\nthe National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation\n\nthe Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation\n\nOn 8 March 2022, the UK government published the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 6) Regulations 2022, introducing following measures with respect to aviation sector:\n\nthe termination of existing registration, and refusal of application for registration, of aircraft owned by designated persons within the UK,\n\nbanning Russian aircraft (owned, operated or chartered by a designated person or a person connected with Russia, as well as aircraft registered in Russia) from overflying or landing in the UK, and\n\ngiving the Secretary of State power to direct an airport operator to detain Russian aircraft.\n\nDepartment of International Trade issued a General Trade Licence for Vessels in response to Russia sanctions clarifying certain permitted transactions and services (incl. insurance) in relation to vessels moving from a third country to Russia, to UK or from Russia to a third country or transiting Russia.\n\nOn 24 March 2022 OFSI sanctioned 33 persons and 26 Russian and Belorussian entities, including Alfabank, Gazprombank, SMP bank, Russian Agricultural bank and Ural Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\nOn 6 April 2022 The UK has added 2 banks to the Russia financial sanctions regime: Credit Bank of Moscow and Sberbank.\n\nOFSI has also updated its general guidance to adding new para 4.14 on aggregation:\n\nWhen making an assessment on ownership and control, OFSI would not simply aggregate different designated persons' holdings in a company, unless, for example, the shares or rights are subject to a joint arrangement between the designated parties or one party controls the rights of another. Consequently, if each of the designated person's holdings falls below the 50% threshold in respect of share ownership and there is no evidence of a joint arrangement or that the shares are held jointly, the company would not be directly or indirectly owned by a designated person.\n\nIt should be noted that ownership and control also relates to holding more than 50% of voting rights, the right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors and it being reasonable to expect that a designated person would be able in significant respects to ensure that the affairs of a company are conducted in accordance with their wishes. If any of these apply, the company could be controlled by a designated person.\n\nOn 30 March 2022 UK issued The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 7) Regulations 2022:\n\nintroducing a power to collectively designate entities/persons under a special procedure;\n\nextending existing finance, shipping and trade sanctions relating to Crimea to the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine.

These three EOs were subsequently implemented by Regulation (31 CFR part 589). In July 2015, OFAC designated five Crimean port operators and one sea ferry operator pursuant to Executive Order 13685. The seaports affected are at Kerch, Sevastopol, Feodosia, Evpatoria and Yalta. The US has extended its targeted sanctions against senior Russian officials, businessmen and state-owned companies until 6 March 2017. The White House's notice on the extension is here. The list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN List) has steadily grown and the latest list can be found on US treasury website. More information on the designations can be found here and a link to the OFAC search facility is provided here.\n\nThe US authorities adopt the approach that designations extend to any entity owned or controlled by designated persons. An entity which is not itself listed but is owned directly or indirectly by a blocked person with a 50% or more interest is considered as a blocked person. Caution is required when dealing with a non-blocked entity in which one or more blocked persons has a significant interest. For more information see US OFAC Guidance published on 13 August 2014.\n\nSectoral Sanctions - SSI List\n\nIn July 2014 limited \"sectoral sanctions\" were introduced against several banks (Gazprombank, Vneshtorgbank, Russian Agricultural Bank and Vnesheconomobank) and two energy companies (Rosneft and Novatek). Since then the list has continued to expand. These companies are not subject to an asset freeze but US persons are unable to enter into certain transactions with them. These companies appear on a new Sectoral Sanctions Identification List (SSI List) and are not in the SDN list. Russia's largest company - the United Shipbuilding Corporation has been added to the SDN list. US Treasury has issued FAQs on sectoral sanctions which can be found here.\n\nThe category of prohibited transactions varies and it is necessary to check the SSI Listing to find out details by cross referencing to the applicable Directive under EO 13662. Certain types of financial services are commonly restricted. However some operators in the energy sector may be affected by Directive 4 (updated 31 October 2017) which contains restrictions on the provision by a US person or within the US of \"goods, services (except for financial services), or technology in support of exploration or production for deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil in the Russian Federation, or in maritime area claimed by the Russian Federation and extending from its territory, and that involve any person determined to be subject to this Directive, its property, or its interests in property\". OFAC has also published new and updated FAQs relating to this Directive.\n\nRestrictions on US corporations\n\nIn addition to prohibitions on transactions with named entities and individuals, there are general restrictions on US corporations and individuals conducting business with Crimea (see for example Executive Order dated 19 December 2014).\n\nCyber based sanctions\n\nOn 29 December 2016, President Obama imposed sanctions by Executive Order on Russian intelligence agencies, three companies and several individuals for alleged involvement in cyber activity affecting the US. These sanctions are unlikely to have an effect on international trade.\n\nEU\n\nRestrictions on trading with or investment in Crimea or Sevastopol\n\nOn 23 June 2014 the European Union passed Council Decision 2014/386/CFSP and Council Regulation 692/2014 introducing new set of sanctions relating to Ukraine. Import of goods originating in Crimea or Sevastopol into the EU is prohibited, as well as financing, financial assistance or (re)insurance in relation to such imports.\n\nOn July 30 2014 an amendment to the 692/2014 regulation was passed in a new Council Regulation No. 825/2014 imposing ban on new investments related to infrastructure in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy and the exploitation of natural resources in Crimea and Sevastopol as well as export ban on key equipment and technology related to these sectors. These restrictions were extended on 19 December 2014 by Regulation 1351/2014 which also included a ban on cruise vessels calling at ports in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nFor further information see International Group circular published on 17 July 2014 and the supplementary circular dated 12 August 2014.\n\nThe EU has extended its sectoral sanctions against Russia until 31July 2017. In its statement the Council sums up the scope of sanctions imposed by Council Regulation 692/2014 and Council Decision 2014/386/CFSP.\n\nSectoral sanctions\n\nOn 1 August 2014, EU Regulation 833/2014 introduced a requirement for prior authorization was required for exporting dual use technology to the Russian oil sector, including floating or submersible drilling or production platforms, sea-going light vessels, fire-floats, floating cranes and other vessels, etc. (listed in Annex II of the Regulation). Prior authorisation was also required for any sale, supply, transfer or export of certain technologies which are \"suited for the oil industry\" and it is clear that licensing would not be given for technology to be used in \"projects pertaining to deep water oil exploration and production, Arctic oil exploration and production, or shale oil projects in Russia\". Activities under contracts made before 1 August 2014 were able to go ahead.\n\nEU Regulation 960/2014 of 8 September 2014 amended Regulation 833/2014 and extended the restrictions for certain services associated with deep water oil exploration and production, arctic oil exploration and production, or shale oil projects. These Regulations were further amended, largely to provide clarification, on 4 December 2014 by Regulation 1290/2014.The prohibited services are (i) drilling, (ii) well testing, (iii) logging and completion services and (iv) the supply of specialised floating vessels. There is no provision for authorities to grant an export authorisation, although the measures do not apply to contracts concluded before 12 September 2014. The restrictions do not apply to services necessary for the urgent prevention or mitigation of an event likely to have a serious impact on human health and safety or the environment.\n\nEU Commission published Guidance on the application of certain provisions in Regulation 833/2014 on 16 December 2014.\n\nSimilar restrictions apply to other sectors including dual-use technology, arms and military equipment and access to the capital market for financial institutions\n\nDesignated individuals and entities\n\nThe EU first introduced measures freezing the funds and economic resources of designated persons in March 2014. Since then Council Regulation 269/2014 adopted on 17 March has been amended by a series of Council Regulations adding further individuals and entities to the list. Restrictions are in place against a large number of individuals and entities (including Crimea based companies involved in the gas and oil industries, Kerch and Sevastopol Commercial Sea Ports and several Russian largest banks). The EU extended sanctions until 15 September 2016 by Implementing Regulation 2016/353 amending Regulation 269/2014 and Decision 2016/359 amending Decision 2014/145/CFSP. See Links with information about where to find official lists provided by US, EU and UK.\n\nOn 14 September 2017 the EU issued Council Regulation 2017/1547 which allows to authorise payments to Crimean Sea Ports for certain services.\n\nNorway\n\nAlthough EU Regulations do not have direct effect in Norway, the Norwegian government has in general aligned itself with the EU.\n\nOn 15 August 2014 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a Press Release announcing the introduction of restrictive measures against Russia in line with those already implemented by the EU, including Regulation 833/2014. The Regulation can be found here (FOR-2014-08-15-1076 Norwegian language only).\n\nOn April 17 2015, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry adopted changes to its Regulation on restrictive measures against Russia extending its scope and providing some clarifications in line with EU regulations.\n\nRussia\n\nOn 16 December 2019, the Russian Government signed Resolution No. 1685, which expanded an import ban with respect to Ukrainian goods. The list of banned goods now includes cornstarch, glucose and fructose, a number of medical goods (such as medical stoppers, hot-water bags, ball syringes), radiators, central-heating boilers and waste paper. These goods are prohibited from entering Russia if they\n\n(i) originate from Ukraine,\n\n(ii) are supplied from Ukraine, or\n\n(iii) have been in transit through the territory of Ukraine.\n\nThe same day the Russian Government signed Resolution No. 1692, which amended the list of Ukrainian citizens subject to sanctions: nine more individuals, including state officials and deputies of the city council of Odessa region of Ukraine, were sanctioned; two individuals were de-listed. The total number of the Ukrainian individuals sanctioned by Russia now amounts to 574.\n\nBoth Resolutions entered into force on 17 December 2019.\n\nIn accordance with Presidential Executive Order issued on October 22, 2018, Russian government added 322 individuals and 68 entities to its Ukraine sanctions list (asset freezes) in order to \"counter Ukraine's unfriendly actions towards Russian citizens and legal entities, to ensure that the restrictions imposed by Ukraine on Russian citizens and legal entities are lifted and to encourage the normalisation of bilateral relations\".\n\nAccording to the Russian press release, the list includes the Judges of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, deputies of the 8th Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, major businesspeople, officials from the Executive Office of the President of Ukraine, heads of executive authorities of Ukraine and large Ukrainian companies, as well as legal entities controlled by major Ukrainian businesspeople.\n\nOn 4 June 2018 President Putin signed law on new counter-measures including restrictions on the import into Russia of products and/or raw materials originating from the USA and other foreign states, and on the export from Russia of products to foreign citizens. The legislation gives President Putin the power to choose the sectors and products that will be affected, and to \"ban or suspend co-operation with a hostile state\". The Russian Government will define the list of products and raw materials which may be banned from being imported/exported, as well as other types of work/services the procurement of which may be banned or restricted.\n\nOn 30 July 2017 in response to CAATSA the President of Russia confirmed that staff at US diplomatic missions in Russia would have to be cut by 755 people and that Russia would seize two US diplomatic properties.\n\nOn 7 August 2014 Russia implemented an import ban on beef, pork, poultry, fruit, vegetables, fish, cheese, milk and dairy products. The ban applies to imports from the EU, US, Norway, Australia and Canada.\n\nOn May 29 2015 Russia issued a list of 89 European politicians and officials who are banned from entering the country. The list includes past and present European parliamentarians and ministers. The list was sent to all EU member states.\n\nOn 11 May 2022, the Russian Government adopted Decree No. 851 adding 31 energy companies incorporated in the EU, the US, the UK, Singapore and Switzerland to the designated persons list. Notably, most of the designated persons are members of Gazprom Germania group of companies.\n\nThe Decree further supplemented the list of transactions with designated persons that are prohibited for persons under Russian jurisdiction:\n\n(i) transactions with (including discharging of obligations, including deals already in progress) in favour of designated persons;\n\n(ii) the export of raw materials/commodities/other products originating from Russia in favour of sanctioned persons or via sanctioned persons to third parties;\n\n(iii) transactions involving entry of vessels owned or chartered by the designated persons into Russian seaports; and\n\n(iv) transactions involving payments and securities transactions with or for the benefit of the designated persons.\n\nentity established in Russia and owned (directly or indirectly) by more than 50% by one of the above entities.\n\nSale, supply, transfer or export of euro banknotes to Russia or to any person/entity in Russia (including the Russian government), or for use in Russia.\n\nThe EU has designated additional 160 people under its Russia sanctions regime, see: Council Decision (CFSP) 2022/397 & Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/396:\n\n146 members of the Russian Federation Council who ratified the Treaties of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the Russian Federation and the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic; and\n\n14 people, said to be \"oligarchs and prominent business people\" and their family members: Alexander Dmitrievich Pumpyansky; Alexander Semenovich Vinokurov; Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko; Dmitry Alexandrovich Pumpyansky; Dmitry Arkadievich Mazepin; Galina Evgenyevna Pumpyanskaya; Mikhail Eduardovich Oseevsky; Mikhail Igorevich Poluboyarinov; Sergey Alexandrovich Kulikov; Vadim Nikolaevich Moshkovich; Vladimir Sergeevich Kiriyenko; Andrey Andreevich Guryev; Dmitry Vladimirovich Konov; and Nikita Mazepin.\n\nOn 15 March 2022 the EU adopted a 4th package of sanctions in response to Russia's military aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe EU has designated 15 individuals including Russian oligarchs and 9 entities operating in the Russian aviation, military, shipbuilding and machine building sectors, to the EU sanctions list (Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/427). The designated entities include: Rosneft Aero; JSC Rosoboronexport; JSC NPO High Precision Systems; JSC Kurganmashzavod; JSC Russian Helicopters; PJSC United Aircraft Corporation; JSC United Shipbuilding Corporation; JSC Research and Production Corporation Uralvagonzavod, and JSC Zelenodolsk Shipyard (A. M. Gorky Zelenodolsk Plant).\n\nMembers should be aware that where an individual is listed, an ownership and control analysis should be undertaken to establish any impact on a linked company with which they are transacting. The Commission Opinion of 8 June 2021 is helpful in identifying the factors to take into account and the approach to be taken.\n\nThe other measures (Council Regulation (EU) 2022/428 amending EU Regulation no. 833/2014) include:\n\nProhibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export of equipment or technology (whether or not originating in the EU) which is listed in Annex II to a person or entity in Russia or for use in Russia.
