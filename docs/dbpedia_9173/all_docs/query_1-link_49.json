        "text": "Nobody seems particularly concerned about the fact that the majority of state-owned assets is now in the hands of oligarchs. And that's not all. The political party Renewal is the company's political arm; the country's president until 2011, Igor Smirnov, is from the party.\n\nAcross from Tiraspol's registry office, a heavily chromed Mercedes S-500 is parked, blocking the sidewalk along Sverdlov Street. It belongs to Oleg Pankov, a former army officer who fought for the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Following the collapse of communism, he made his money selling sex toys. His store, called Intim, smells of smoke and is reminiscent of a small grocery, except that instead of carrots on display, Pankov has carefully laid out corn-shaped vibrators, artificial vaginas and phalluses the size of medium-range missiles -- most of it imported from Germany.\n\n\"Transnistria is not a rich country,\" Pankov says, \"but people are always going to have sex.\" He asks what people in the West think of the fascist hordes on the Maidan in Kiev and offers a pill called \"Seks President\" as a gesture of goodwill. The cardboard packaging bears the image of Bill Clinton. Pankov then opens a low door behind the counter: \"Come in, I want to show you something.\"\n\nThe shop's backroom is plastered right up to the ceiling with Soviet banners, red-satin party flags bearing Lenin's likeness and heroic embroideries with the slogan: \"Working Men of All Countries, Unite!\" Several busts of Lenin are prominently displayed. It is a devotional shrine to the Soviet empire, a chamber of Bolshevik relics -- and only separated from the \"Hot Lady\" drops by a thin wall. \"My business is out there,\" Pankov says as he slumps into a well-used office chair. \"But my soul is in here\" he adds, pounding his breast.\n\n\"I was a communist until the very end,\" he says. \"Now it is good to be able to do business, I like this reality. But I love the Soviet Union at the same time. You can't betray your own history. Transnistria is not Romania, it is Russia, the Crimea is Russia. What would you do if suddenly you were only allowed to speak Belgian in Germany? Exactly.\"\n\nRusting Border Shacks\n\nIn his own way, Oleg Pankov is symbolic of his country. Even if all of the national heroes, the repainted tanks and wreaths of honor have degenerated into empty souvenirs, they hint at a profound truth: Transnistrians are a displaced people who want to stay where they are.\n\nHeading north from Tiraspol, the road passes through apple orchards and well-maintained vineyards, and past billboards advertising rain gutters. The border to Moldova is invisible. There is no fence and no wall. There is just the Dniester River and the occasional rusting border control shack.\n\nIn this region of Transnistria, people speak Moldovan, which is essentially Romanian. Just that in Transnistria, it is written using the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nThe Dniester winds tightly through the landscape and there are Moldovan exclaves on the Transnistrian side -- villages that can only be reached by ferry. At the jetty serving the settlement of Molovata Noua, two Russian soldiers are standing beneath a black birch; a bit further on, a dug-in infantry fighting vehicle can be seen. Soon, local children will once again begin swimming in the river. The border crossing is known as \"Post Nr. 6,\" and is certainly among the more absurd such crossings on the European continent.\n\nTwo Moldovans, two Transnistrians and three Russians live here in a single barrack -- soldiers from three different armies. One of the Russians is in charge; the Transnistrians are responsible for provisions. The facility is a part of the mission for Moldova run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), itself something of a product of the Cold War.\n\nDespite the difficult balancing act Moldova and Transnistria have been performing since 1992, conflict has been surprisingly rare. To be sure, the two sides quarrel regularly about customs formalities and the exclaves, but they generally find a way to resolve their disputes. One example is the Moldovan prison located on the Transnistrian side of the river: Every morning, the guards must don overcoats to hide their uniforms. That is part of the status quo.\n\nStill, there was one deadly incident on the border. On New Year's Eve 2012, a young Moldovan broke through a barricade on a mission to get more schnapps and was shot by a guard. The result was months of tensions and bickering in the Joint Control Commission, which includes representatives from the OSCE, Russia, Ukraine, the EU and the US.\n\nHarmless Operetta?\n\nMore than anything else, the border is an annoyance for the villagers here. They are tired of having to apply for a travel permit every time they want to go shopping across the frontier, though some have made the best of it and registered in Transnistria in order to benefit from the pension supplement paid by Moscow. Passports are hardly a hurdle; almost everyone in the region has several.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to avoid the feeling that Transnistria, that small worm squashed between two larger creatures, is nothing but a collective hallucination. But the country is more than just a harmless operetta created by people who have decided to live in a bygone era. Because of its location between Ukraine and Moldova, Transnistria is of not-insignificant geo-strategic importance.\n\nIn June, the EU is set to sign an association agreement with Moldova, comparable to the one that helped push Ukraine into unrest. Officially, the agreement would also extend to Transnistria, as long as the government conforms to the deal's provisions. That might be in opposition to Transnistria's declared foreign policy, but it would be good for business: Roughly half of its exports go to the EU.\n\nStill, a senior Russian official has threatened \"serious consequences\" should the treaty be signed and at the beginning of April, the president of Moldova called for \"increased vigilance\" from his army due to the possibility of \"provocations.\"\n\nMoscow has developed detailed plans for the takeover of Transnistria, much like those for Crimea and South Ossetia. That, at least, is the assumption of Western embassies in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova. The Russian military regularly holds joint maneuvers with the Transnistrian army on the outskirts of Tiraspol, with the most recent one having taken place on March 25. And in Cobasna, near the Ukrainian border, there is still an arms depot containing 20,000 tons of Soviet munitions. It is one of the biggest of its kind in Europe -- and it is far from the best guarded.\n\nThe EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) noted recently that its experts \"have not witnessed any relevant disruption of movement of people and cargo across the Transnistrian segment.\" Nevertheless, Putin brought up Transnistria in telephone conversations with both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Barack Obama, complaining that the region was being blockaded by Ukraine.\n\nHard as Concrete\n\nIt is, perhaps, a small detail. But it could be enough to transform Transnistria into a lever of the kind conservative think tanks have begun warning about. Think tanks like the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation, which has cautioned that Tiraspol could call for Moscow's help to break the alleged blockade and Russian troops could then march in via Odessa. It is, perhaps, a rather far-fetched scenario, but it is isn't completely unrealistic. What is certain, however, is that were the Russians to arrive, Transnistrians would be standing on the roadsides waving flags to welcome them.\n\nOn the border to Moldova, at the \"Bender\" crossing, several men stand waiting, all of them wearing Russian military caps of the kind still sold in Berlin flea markets along where the Wall once ran. \"Please come with me. The people are inviting you for a formality.\" The name of the man speaking is Anatoly, a truck driver who has been commandeered to help the border guards because of his German ability. Formality?\n\nAn icon is hanging in the interrogation room, and Anatoly does his best: \"People ask. Why here? Without Akkreditasye? The people say you have done against Pridnestrovian law…\" He says the guards find it awkward, but that either I have to remain there, or my laptop, iPhone, hard drives and cameras do. It is like a scene from an old film, just in color and 3-D -- a scene in which the setting suddenly becomes extremely realistic, and as hard as concrete."
