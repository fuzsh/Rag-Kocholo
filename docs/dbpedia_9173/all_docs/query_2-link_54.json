In connec- tion with the adbitious goals for medhanization and automation of in- dustry, production of process control instruments is receiving particular emphasis and is expected to increaSest a considerably faster rate than is production of other types of instruments. Current production of in- struments is insufficient in terms of both quantityand product mix to meet the requirements of the Soviet economy. _AlthOligh the gap between production and requirements 'will be narrowed in the course of the Seven Year Plan, production of instruments in 1965 will still lag behind re- quirements. Although the Russians producedAmme types of instruments before the Bolshevik Revolution, output of a camprehepsiverange of items did not begin in the USSR until after World War II, aWnot-Ontil-the middle of the decade of the 1950'41 did Soviet industry produce the more sophisti- cated types of instruments 10 large quantities. ,,Production of instru- ments during 1956-59 is eetimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 25 to 30 percent. In 1960i4roduction increased only 18 percent to a total value of output of 1.1 billion rubles.** The 1961 plan calls for an output of 1.3 'billion rUblesi and output in 1965 Is expected to reach 2.4 billionto2.5 billion ruble44 The industry therefore is expected to exceed its original Seten Year Plan goals of 1.85 billion to 1.92 billion,rdbles as early as 1963 or 1964. Thus, instead of an average annual rate of growth of 111.3 percent as ap- parently programed under the original terns of the. Seven Year Plan, it is estimated that the rate of growth will be about 18.7 percent per year. During 1959-60 the rate of growth averagad'alightlymore than 22.5 percent per year.

During the period of the Seven Year Plan the structure of the indus- try will change appreciably. Production of process control instruments, which constituted only 12 percent of the total production of instruments in 1958, is expected to comprise 28 percent of the total production in 1965. The share of timepieces in the total production is :ached ed to decrease from 23 percent in 1958 to 18 percent in 1965. These cnges are reflected in the following tabulation: Category Percent of Total Production 1958 1965 Electrical measuring instruments 13.0 14.8 Process control instruments 11.7 27.8 Calculators and computers 7.0 9.4 4 ..Instruments for measuring mechanical quantities 9.3 7.7 Timekeeping devices 23.0 18.3 Other instruments' 36.0 22.0 Total 100.0 100.0 In spite of rapid. growth, the Soviet instrument industry lags well behind its US counterpart. Soviet production of instruments in 1958 probably was about tWo-fifths of that of the US. The US instrument industry also has been growing rapidly, at an average annual rate of 11 percent since World War II, and. is expected to increase even faster in the next 15 years* Even if the USSR achieves a production of 2.5 billion rubles of instruments in 1965, Soviet output of instrumentS in that year probably will be no more than two-thirds that of the US. Approximately 263 industrialplants in the USSR are principally engaged in productift of instruments, and a number of research insti- tutes also produce small quantities. Of these 263 plants, 71:plants (the largest category) have been identified as producers of process control instruments, and 28 produce optical instruments; 23, electrical measuring instruments; 20, timekeeping devices; and 19, weighing de- vices. The urban areas of Moscow0Leningrad, and Kiev have the heaviest concentrations of plants, although instrument plants are located in all Industrial regions of the USSR.

The technology of Soviet instruments has improved greatly in the last decade. At present the general range of Soviet technology and its degree of sophistication are still lagging behind the Ms although the gap is closing in many areas, the most significant of Uhich is in the field of automation equipment. The USSR is currently, believed to be about on a par with the US in theory of automation but well behind the US in application of automation. A vast network of research organiza- tions has been brought into being to devise new equipMent, raise the efficiency and quality of production, direct the implementation of the automation program, and overcome the general lag in automation application. As a result of the concentration of effort, the Soviet lag in this area Should steadily decrease. Instrummatation in such fields as guidance, upper atmosphere research, and telemetry is believed to be of a high order of technology. Soviet optics are considered to be very good. Instruments used in electron microscopy, ultra-high-energy physics, and gas chromatography lag behind the US in quality of workman- ship and in sophistication. * The term automation equipment is defined in the USSR as including sensors, amplifiers, electronic data-processing evipment, and servo- mechanisms.

Soviet analog computers, although not comparable withthe better US models, are adequate for a wide variety of important applications. In contrast, Soviet digital computers are markedly inferior to those of the US. Although all sectors of the Soviet economy will have a share of out- put of the instrument industry, the greater part is channeled into domes- tic industrial use or goes to the armed forces. Such key areas as the chemical, petroleum-processing, and metallurgical industries receive large quantities of this equipment. Currently the USSR supplements its output of instruments through selective imports of small quantities of ? high-priority items, such as process control instruments, from the Free World and the three major Satellite producers (East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary). Soviet exports of instruments to either the remainder of the Bloc or the Free World are small in quantity and are about evenly divided between scientific and industrial types on the one hand and consumer goods types -- timekeeping devices and photo- graphic and cinematographic equipment -- on the other.

Introduction An instrument is any device used in observing, measuring, controlling, recording, computing, or communicating. Instruments and instrument sys- tems refine, extend, or supplement human faculties-and abilities to sense, perceive, communicate, remember, calculate, or reason. The human senses are refined or extended by such devices as surface-roughness and contour gauges, micrometers, chemical analyzers, pH meters, microscopes, telescopes, gyro stabilized. platforms, range finders, and many others. Other instruments, such as magnetometers and cosmic-ray counters, sense or measure physical quantities for which there is no physiological sense developed in human beings. Still other instruments (such as cameras, correlators, simulators, and computers) perform functions of storing, transmitting, or processing information signals in ways analogous to, or going beyond, human abilities to record, remember, communicate, compare, count, and apply logical operations systematically. The following list includes some of the more important functions of instruments or components of instrumentation systems in creating or han- dling signals (or information or data): excitation, generation, modu- lation, detection, comparison, amplification, differentiation, integration, attenuation, conversion, switching, counting, coding, timing, programing, correlating, linearizing, correcting, displaying, ?recording, reducing, analyzing, computing, and controlling. Because all branches of experi- mental science and technology depend on instrumentation, specialized instruments (with a corresponding body of knowledge and practice) have been developed separately in many fields. Thus chemical, aeronautical, medical, and optical instrumentation among other types of instrumen- tation indicate areas of specialization in various industries or pro- fessions. Most types of instrumentation, however, have so-called \"uni- versal\" usage -- that is, they can be used by a large number of diverse consumers without major modifications. Instruments are sometimes classified according to their field of purpose or application, such as navigation instruments, surveying instru- ments, or oceanographic instruments; according to their functions in Instrument systems, such as detection, measurement, recording, computing, controlling, signal modification, or display; Or according to the physi- cal quantity or property that is to be measured or controlled by the instrument, such as flow, temperature, pressure, force, displacement, level, viscosity, acceleration, electrical quantities (voltage, current, resistance, and capacitance), and optical qualities (transmission, gloss, color, and brightness). Another method of designating or classifying instruments, particularly those of vide applicability, is according to - 5 - S-E-CR7E-2 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C.R-E-T operating principles, examples being X-ray instruments (microscopes and diffractometers); spectrometric instruments of various types for various portions of the frequency spectrum or various particles (including infra- red, ultraviolet, visible, microwave, X-ray, gamma-ray, neutron, electron, and alpha particles); and pneumatic, mechanical, electronic, electrical, magnetic, hydraulic, nuclear, acoustic optical, and. instru- ments. Each of the methods of classif;ing instruments is useful only in specific instances. A single instrument or instrument system may utilize many combinations of different principles. A given instrument often has many applications. Any physical quantity may be measured by a number of different principles. Each of the many operations performed in handling the flow of information in instrumentation systems may be accomplished by various techniques and devices. Thus no single method of classifying instruments is possible, and the several methods are used where they. apply. In the USSR the instrument industry is referred to as priborostroyeniye (instrument manufacturing) and the products of the industry as ptibory i sredstva avtomatizatsii (instruments and automation equipment). This industry is a branch of machine building, and its enterprises produce most types of precision instruments (including some devices not usually regarded as precision instruments, such as photographic and motion picture appara- tus, watches and clocks, and calculating machines for office use). Soviet accounting procedures for reporting physical production of instruments narrow this list by omitting, apparently, value figures for production of cameras and clocks and watches, output of which is reported separately by units. Also, the Soviet instrument industry apparently does not Include among its list ofproducts such categories as medical and dental instruments, machinists' precision tools, or X-ray equipment (either medical or industrial). 1/* II. .Production Facilities and Output of Precision Instruments A. Before 1959 Production of instruments dates back to the Tsarist period in what is now the USSR, but significant production of such equipment did not begin until early in ,the 1920's with the establishment of, plants for - large-scale production 'of clocks and watches, weighing devices, and tem- perature-measuring devices. 3/. Simple, devices for instrumentation and testing, such as theodolites microscopes, metal-analyzing devices and rudimentary electriCal and thermal control instruments began-to bolt pro- duced in volume, during the First. Five Year Plan (192842). 1/ In campari- kr 50X1 yr - 6 - S.E -C R-E-T: Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release' 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T son With similar prodUCtivof.Weatern Europe and the US, these instruments were crude and inferioriankthe,USSR depended on imports for most of the more complex precision instruments. Before World War- II, production facilities were. contentrated . , . largely around Moscow, Leningrad,. and Kiev. These plants were relocated to the east when the German Army overran the western USSR. When the German Army was thrown back, many of the individual plants. were reestab- lished in their former locations, leaving all or most of their produc- tion machinery and a good portion of their labor- force at their relocated facility, which thenceforth was to have a separate.identity. This arrange- ment did not work a hardship, however, as Soviet instrument plants at about the. same time received a-massive growth Stimulant in the form of - dismantled German instrument plants and machinery and conscripted German scientists and technicians. For example, shortly after the Soviet forces took over Dresden it1945, they drew up elaborate floor plans of the Zeiss Ikon Plant, then dismantled the plant and moved everything, includ- ing light fixtures and key '-workman, to the USSR. This technique was employed in Jena, Berlin, Rathenow, and other centers of the German optical and precision instrument ind4stry. Ili %are than 90 percent of the Carl Zeiss Plant in Jena, which before World War II was preeminent in the field of optical equipment, was dismantled and sent to reestab- lished plants in KrasnogOrsk, Kiev ? and Leningrad. In addition, the Saxonian watch industry-in Olashue.tte was completely dismantled. 2/ With the possible exception of the machine tool industry, the USSR placed greater emphasis on-thedystematic and thorough dismantling of optical plants than it did on -any other branch of Germanindustry. Y Apparently the Red Army also dismantled some of the optical plants of other occupied countries, such as, for example, the Magyar Optikai MUvek (Hungarian Optical Plant) in Budapest. 7/ - These gains were retied-bed in the industrial.record of the first two postwar 5-year plane. -- The USSR made considerable progress in produc- tion of simple quality control instruments and optical instruments.. Great stress also was placed on achieving-large-volume-production of process control instruments, pi but the complexity in designing and producing such equipment apparently caused the programto fall behind schedule in the Fourth Five Year Plan (1946-50).. Production of watches and clocks however ? jumped from about 0.3 million units in 1945-t0--almbst 7.6 Million units in 1950 and 19.7 million units in 1955 (the -probable prewar high-water mark was4.5 million units in 1935). Production of demerit also made a strong postwar recOvery from virtually none in 1945 to 0-.3 million units in 1950 and. 1.0 Million units in 1955 (the probable prewar high-water mark Was 0.4 million units in 1940). 2/ - 7 - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T By 1951, Moscow and Leningrad were still the most important centers of production of instruments, with 16 plants in the former and 14 in the latter city accounting for about 20 and 15 percent, respectively0 of the total production of instruments. 12/ By the end of the Fifth Five Year Plan (1951-55)0 production of computers and process control instru- ments moved into high gear. All types of instruments continued to be produced at an expanding rate. During the Fifth Five Year Plan, production tripled.* In 1955, output of process control instruments was 2.8 times that of 1950; of calculators and computers, 7.4 times; and of instruments for gas analysis, 3 times. 12/ Production of timekeeping devices and cameras more then doubled, 2... as indicated below: Thousand Units , 1951 , 1952 1953 1954 1955 Timekeeping devices 9,645 10,486 , 12,888 16,397 19,705 Cameras 357.2 459.1 499.1 767.9 1,022.5 In spite of its impressive rate of growth in production of instru- ments, the USSR found itself hampered by several nagging problems. As the country moved into the abortive Sixth Five Year Plan (1956-60), instru- ments were being produced in large numbers by more than a dozen different ministriesl** Each ministry often anactured instruments solely for its own use. 1?/ Also, output of instruments fell far short of satisfying the needs of-the national economy. 11/ Not enough instruments were being produced, and, in comparison with the West, the level of technology was lower. Produc- tion often included obsolete items, 1g/ and shortages of raw materials and components were frequent problems. 12/ As if these problems them- selves were not enough, the Sixth Five Year Plan called for production of instruments worth 700 million rubles in 1960.4R-* Di production of instruments in 1955 was 2.7 times that of 1950 rather than 3 times. 11/ ** For example, most of the optical instruments were produced by the Ministry of Defense Industries; electrical measuring instruments were produced principally by both the Ministry of Electric Plower Stations and the Ministry of Electrical Engineering Industry; and process control instruments were produced by more than half a dozen ministries. 1It/ *** The goals under the Sixth Five Year Plan varied for different cate- gories of instruments, as follows: process [footnote continued on p. 9) - 8 - S-E-C-R-E-T 50X1 50X1 50X1 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S E-C-R-E-T Early in 1956 the Council of Ministers of the USSR divided the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Building into two separate ministries, one of which was the Ministry of Instrument Building and Automation. The new ministry inherited those instrument plants under the jurisdic- tion of its predecessor and was to coordinate production of measuring instruments and automation equipment and speed up production. g2/ The new ministry apparently was simply another of the many ministries produc- ing instruments, and there is no indication that it solved or alleviated any of the nagging problems. 22/ This ministry and all other instrument- producing ministries were swept away in the general administrative reorgan- ization of industry in the summer of 1957. Over-all planning functions for the instrument industry were shifted to GoOplan and perhaps other state committees as well. Instrument plants fell under the jurisdiction of the various sovnarkhozes (Councils of the National Economy). During the first 3 years of the Sixth Five Year Plan, output of instruments continued to rise sharply at an 8.4e-rage annual rate of 25 to 30 percent. The value of instruments produced in 1958 (excluding watches, clocks, and cameras) is estimated to have been slightly less than 740 million rubles. Growth of _production of consumer goods (watches, clocks, and cameras) was sluggish, as indicated by the following official figures 2.5./: Timekeeping' devices Cameras , Million Units 1956 . 1957 1958 22.6 23.5 24.8 1.2 1.3 1.5 At a time when most branches of the machine building sector were failing to achieve the levels of production called for by annual plan goals during the Sixth Five Year Plan, the instrument industry in 1958 had already exceeded the 1960 goals established by the Sixth Five Year Plan, thanks to the construction of new plants, the expansion of existing ones and the conversion of certain plants to production of instruments. In spite of the rapid growth of the industry, production of instruments in 1958 was still insufficient in terms of both quantity and product mix. control instruments 4 times that of 1955; electrical measuring instru- ments, 3.6 times; calculators and Computers, 4.;.5 times; and optical- mechanical instruments',-ItiMeS.

Seven Year Plan (1999,65) 1. Organization and. Administrative Structure The sovnarkhoz system of administration was in full opera- tion by the beginning of the Seven Year Flan. The large number of monolithic, Moscaw-centered ministries had been replaced by the sotra narkhozes as supervisors of individual plants, although Ultimate authority ani policymaking powers had beah:retained by functional state committees under the Council of Ministers, USSR. The day-to-day responsibility for distribution of raw materials, the appointment of principal Officials of the plants, and other forms of direct control, however, were now .vested in functional administrations subordinate to sovnarkhozes. The designation of these administrations varies from one sov- narkhoz to another, depending on the volume and character of the indus- trial production of the sovnarkhoz. Ordinarily, if there is a significant volume of production of instruments, there is an Administration of Electri- cal Engineering Industry and Instrument Making, as in the Belorussian Sovnarkhoz, or an Administration of Radio Engineering and Instrument Making, as in the Mbscow city Sovnarkhoz or simply an Administration of Instrument Making, as in the Lithuanian :I.nd L'vovskiy Sovnarkhozes. If production of instruments is of minor importance, responsibility or Instrument plants may be lodged in an Administration of Machine Building, as in the Estonian and'Kirgiz Sovnarkhozes. 27/ The sovnarkhoz directs and monitors production activity. It also is believed to have an important voice in appointing or removing major officials at instrument plants, in establishing what a plant should. produce, and in instituting corrective action for any plant failing to meet its plan goals or being remiss in controlling the quality of its production. Gosplan? USSR, through its Division of Electrical Engineering and Instrument Milking Industry, together with its counterpart at the republic level,* gives final approval to the plan for production of instruments after consideration of the recommendations of stmarkhozes and other Interested governmental organs. In some instancesi.Gosplan, USSR, or its counterpart in One of the larger republics will even designate the plant that is to produce or cease to produce a specific item. In addition, the gosplan of a major republic apparently assigns to individual plants * As in the sovnarkhozes, the designations are believed to _differ slightly in the various republics, depending on the importance of the industry. In the smaller republics, the areas of Which coincide with the areas of individual sovnarkhozes, there may not be a separate Gosplan division for instruments. 22/ -10- S-E-C-R-E7T Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 4 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 84-C-R-E-T the specific development responsibilities for a new instrument. Gosplan, USSR, also establishes wholesale and. retail prices ,for instruments. 22/ ',A.-1 ? The new system of administration has provided the instru- ment industry with a greater degree of both Centralization and. decentral- ization. The assumption by Gosplan, USSR, at certain control functions previously dispersed among the many ministries, responsible for production of instruments has provided the opportunity for treating the country's instrument industry as an integrated unit. This increased centraliza- tion makes possible the eliMination of unnecessary duplication in both research and development and production. The' benefits of centralization, however, presuppose effective coordination among various centralized bodies, some of them new which have responsibilities in the field of instrumentation. In addition to Gosplan, USSR, ? these bodies include the State Committee on Automation and Machine Balding; the State Committee on Standards, Measures, ;and Measuring Instruments; and. the recently formed Committee for Coordination of Scientific Research Work. Statements in the Soviet press indicate that the degree of coordination necessary for these orgeskimations to furnish unified policy guidance and over-all control has not yet been achieved. The increased. degree of decentralization has been provided by sovnarkhoz administration of local plants, which has made possible better coordination of production of instruments at the regional level. This system also seems ,to have enabled the older, emall,er, and more backward plants to, improve their ,production capacity by relieving them of the responsibility far manufacturing extraneotis,vroducts and enabling them to specialize -in :the 'output c)f fever items. Sovnarkhoz operational control at the local level,, however,, is not complete. There is evidence that the Division of the Electrical Engineering and Instrument Industry of Gosplan, USSR, and the Division of Elect.rical'Engineering and Elec- tronics of the State Commattee for Automation and achine Building not only exercise over-all policy guidance end control but also can interfere in operations at the plantIeveli Certain problems that were supposed to have been solved by the reorganization of industry -- such as continued production of obsolete instruments -insufficient ,cooperation, between plants, and poor allocation of materiils. -- have not been eliminated under the new administrative system, although they have been .alleviated. Long-ra1ge,p0licy guidance for the instrument industry comes from the Communist cParty itoelZ. A recent example; is the Plena* Session of the Central Committee of the -iitommaist Party-.of the USSR, held on 24-29 June 1959. At this Mieting, certain specific tasks were -pinpointed for the industry: Theac.taska,included. a requirtemment for Improving the - present product 11,st,,of instraments:and. instructions for the principal S44-R4E-T Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 administrative organizations to Cooperate in drawing together within a 6-month period a liet,of proposals for review by the Council of Ministers, USSR, to *prove the organization, coordination, and control of the most important research, experimental, and planning operations of instrument development, Other Actions included an order to emphasize the standardization of Certain categories of instruments and a reiteration that the development of specialization and cooperation of industrial installations of the industry are important programs of the Seven Year Plan. 33 The Party devoted another plenary setsion to this subject in July l6O. ? 2. Production and Research Facilities a. Major Plants It is estimated that there are 263 plants in the USSR that are principally engaged in production of instruments.* The number of plants under the industry ts growing each year as new ones are built or converted to production of instruments. Since the beginning of the. Seven Year Plan, between 30 and 40 new plants have been identified.** It is quite likely that perhaps an equal nuMber may be added to the list during the remainder of the: plan period, although few of these will reach significant levels of production by11965. In addition to the new plants being added to the industry, there is an impressive expansion program for many of the existing plants. For example, the Leninakan Instrument Plant during 1960 was to have increased its facilities by the construction of new shops worth 1.8 million rubles, .lit/ and the Baku Machinery and Instrument Plant imeni Kalinin began a reconstruction program in the middle of 1959 which, when completed, reportedly will enable the plant to increase its output 20 times by the end of the Seven Year Plan. 22/ Similarly the Leningrad Vibrator Plant, one of the oldest and largest manufacturers of electrical Instruments, is adding an additional one-third to its present 400,000 square feet of floorspace. 2?/ The question of how much it is costing the USSR to build 30 to 40 new plants and to expand a large number of existing plants is Intriguing. No official figures have been released, and the few references to capital investment in the industry have been disappointingly brief and vague. On the basis of available data, however, it is believed that during * For a list of plants known or suspected to be producing significant quantities of instruments in'the USSR, See Appendix A. For a list of major plants producing instruments in the USSR, see Appendix B. ** Not all of these plants have actually. gone into production. Con- struction has just begun on some, and still others have not yet talogressed beyond the planning stage. -12- gr.

Not all output of ,the industry comes from the regular producing plants. Some of the research institutes which do design and development work (generally of a theoretical nature), also often produce prototypes or have a limited output of highly technical or complex instru- ments. For example, the Institute of Optics (GOI) imeni S.I. Vhvilov in Leningrad, which is primarily a research facility, is believed to manu- facture limited quantities of the Linnik microscope, profile interfer- ometers, portable polarizing microscopes, fluorescent microscopes, high- temperature microscopes, and diffraction gratings. 27/ The Central Laboratory of Automatics of the Ministry of Construction, RSFSR, in 1960 produced its first consignment of high-speed automatic photoelectric pyrometers. 2/ Still other institutes have \"experimental works\" where large-volume production is carried out, as at the Experimental Works of the Ural Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry, which is producing ? electrical instruments and exporting them to Communist China, Burma, India, Rumania, Poland, and other countries. ,12/ Or, again, there is the Experimental Production Division of the Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences, Ukrainian SSR, which recently began the series production of bolometers, high-precision instruments designed to detect very slight temperature changes. lig/ ? The western part of the USSR contains most of the plants of the instrument industry, although instrument plants are located in all of the industrialized regions of the country. The largest localized concentration of plants is around Moscow (34 plants), Leningrad (31 plants), Kiev (17 plants), Khartkov (7 plants), and Minsk (7 plants). These five urban areas contain more than one-third of the 263 plants of the industry. The size of the labor force at the plants of the industry varies widely.** Of a group of 30 plants for Which recent employment figures are available, the range is from 200 employees in the Tashkent Gidrometpribor Plant to 12,0001 at the Leningrad State Optical Machinery Plant imeni OGPU. On the basis of derivative data, it is estimated that there were 28 ,000 to 290,000 employees in the instrument industry in 1959, or about 5 percent of the 6.2 million employees that are estimated * For an analysis of factors used in reaching this conclusion, see Appendix C. ** For the methodology used in computing the labor force of the instru- ment industry of the USSR, seeAppendix D. - - S-E-C-R-E-T !

The number of women employed by the industry is high, possibly constituting more than half of the labor force. Illustrative of the large number of women employed are the Moscow Timepiece Plant where 84 percent of the 7,500 workers are women 142/; the Leningrad Vibrator Plant, where 64 percent of the 3,500 employees are women W; and the Leningrad Electrical Machinery Plant, where 80 percent of the 1i500 employees are women many of wham are girls just out of high school. !fit/ The ratio of women employed in comparable industries in the US is believed to be far below these levels. Apparently the Soviet instrument industry is not dependent on any one plant for the entire output of any one category of instruments. In 1958, however, two plants, the Moscow and the Penza Analytical and Calculating Machine (SAM) Plants, are believed to have produced, by value, approximately 83 percent of production of electronic computers in the USSR. This concentration of production of computers is expected to lessen in the Seven Year Plan as new plants go into production. Five computer plants are presently in various states of construction, and 22 plants are to be producing computers by the end of 1965. it2/ Of the 263 plants believed to be serving the instrument Industry, those plants principally engaged in output of process control instruments comprise the largest single category, with optical instrument facilities the next largest. The following is a rough estimate of plants engaged in the output of various categories of instruments: Category Number of Plants Process control instruments* 71 Unknown and other instruments (including, among other categories, testing machinery, industrial jewels, and certain scientific instruments)* 61 Optical instruments (including ;botographic, cinemat- ographic, and film-processing equipment) 28 Electrical measuring instruments* 23 Timekeeping devices 20 Weighing devices 19.

Researdh Facilities An impressive research effort Supports the production program for instruments. Research and design organizations exist at many governmental levels in the USSR and for all the scientific disciplines of interest to the inatiotry. There has been a general proliferation in both type and number of such organizations in recent years and an increase in their importance. This rank growth apparently has not been accompanied by stringent control or delineation of programs in spite of the fact that in theory, at least, there is a high degree of centralization. The field is a jungle of confusing administrative subordination and over- lapping functions and responsibilities. IV In the spring of 1961 a shakeup evidently took place in the administration of all scientific research, including that pertaining to instruments. A new agency, the State Committee for Coordination of Scientific Research Work, 'Sae-created with broad administrative powers. Specific functions of this new committee are somewhat vague but seem to be primarily concerned with a reduction in the span of time between product development and production, a general tightening up of coordina- tion and direction of collection and dissemination of scientific informa- tion, and (probably the most significant of all) *major voice in the preparation of annual plans for financing Soviet scientific research and capital investment in research facilities. IV Mast of the major plants have their own research and development personnel and facilities) which generally are supposed to limit their efforts to engineering modifications and improvements and to expansion of product applicatiOn. Some of the plants occasionally engage in more or less basic design-vork on their own) but such research is supposed to require the,agreeSent of superior scientific bodies'. 2.4g/ The latter are made up of research institutes (III's and VRII's)- and design bureaus (KB's and :Mrs). 142/ It is these organizations that-do:the major design and development work. At their head is a group of administrative bodies that collectively exercise either direct or indirect supervision over all design and development work pertaining to instruments and also are vested occasionally with' broad peverSever the entire machine building and metalworking sector.:, These administrative bodied include the following: (1) State Committee for Coordination of Scientific Reneardh Work of the Council of Ministers, USSR; (2) Committee on Standards, Measures, and Measuring Instruments (Which is attached to the Council of Ministers, USSR, and to some extent 1.5 centerible to the US:letional Bureau Of Standards, although more peverhil); (3) MdinAdMinistration of Scientific Research Institutes and Planning Organization* (under Goeplan, USSR); (4) State Committee onAntomatiOn and Machine Building of the Council of 15 - 844--R-B-T Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T Ministers, USSR; and (5) Academy of Sciences, USSR. 22/ Among these scientific organizations the State Committee on Automation and Machine Building plays an important role in the formulation and supervision of plans for the introduction of automation and production processes into all the branches of national industry and the development of new (and the improvement of existing) instruments and automation equipment.' 21/ Each of the research institutes and design bureaus solves the basic research and development problems associated with its own specialized field of application.* Major institutes have branches located in some of the principal cities, and each of these branches serves a sovnarkhoz in the same area of specialization as its parent organization. An example is Kirovakan NIIAvtomatika in the Armenian SSR, which is subordinate to the State Committee on Automation and Machine Building ,of the Council of Ministers, USSR. 22/ The responsi- bility of the institute and its branches is to work in the realm of theory, and when the capability of a device to function has been satisfactorily demonstrated, the project is passed on to a design . bureau. The latter bureau works on precisely defined individual projects for the creation of specific types of items and performs all development work to the point of readiness for production. At this point a designated plant is given the necessary technical documentation relating to the developed item and, on approval of the sovnarkhoz, will produce the new item. 22/ Although theoretically none of the research facilities is to engage in production of equipment, it is evident that they often engage in custom production or amall series production, particularly at so-called experimental plants.- 22.4/ In addition, the degree of teamwork and support rendered by. the Various research facilities appears to be uneven. An example is evident in a recent complaint by the Mytistchi Electric Meter Plant. In attempting to gather data on the effects of mechanical wear in bearings of electric meters, it asked for help from the Leningrad branch of VNIIEP, the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Electrical Measuring Instruments.** In response, VNIIEP apparently sent a survey team which gathered some. statistics. Neither- VNIIEP nor its purvey team furnished the plant with any data or recommen- dations. A survey team from VNITIPribor, the All-Union Scientific Research Technological Institute of Instrument Making,*** was in the plant at the same time, and, instead of pooling resources and cooperating, the two teams went through the plant duplicating each other's questions. 52/ * For a list of the tesearch organizations of special importance to the precision mechanism and automation equipment industry, see Appendix E. ** Vsesoyuznyy NauchnorIssledovateltskiy Institut Elektroizmeritel'nykh Priborov. *** Vsesoyuznyy Nauchno-Issledovaterskiy Tekhnologicheskiy Institut Priborostroyeniya. - 16 - S-E-C-R-E-T Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S. ? S-E-C-R-E-T The ptoblem of duplication of effort has been of real concern to the government. Late in 1957 it was reported that more than 4o organizations were engaged in the development or application of ultra- sonic instruments an&that 18 worked on computers, and in 1960 more than 20 organizations were involved in the designing of flow meters and level meters. 2Y In addition, it appears that tight control of research, through various high-level institutes sugh as -clearinghouses, is not always effective. Visitors to the Institute of Automatics and Tele- mechanics of Gosplan, Ukrainian SSR, in mid-1960 concluded from discussions with officials of the institUte that there was a strong trend toward decentralization of research and development. Thus each republic and even each plant would work out its own methods of automation. 21/ Unless some new form of stringent control is exercised, it appears that this trend could effectively vitiate the coordination of research and develop- ment. A close tie among industrial plants, scientific organi- zations, and administrative organs is obtained through the trade journals, which are published by the scientific bodies and Which furnish policy guidance and specific details on theory or recent developments in instru- mentation for the benefit of research and design facilities and manufac- turing establishments.. Among the most important are Mekhanizatsiya i avtomatizatsiya proissvodstva (Mechanization and Automation of Production) and Priborostroyen4e,t1nstrument Manufacture), published jointly by the State Committee on AutoMation and Machine Building of the Council of Ministers, USSR, and the Central Administration of the Scientific and Technical Society,ofthe InttruMent Industry, and-Izmeriternaya tekhnika (Measurement Techniques), Avtomatika i telemekhanika cAutomation and Remote Control), and Pribory i tekhnika eksperimenta (Instruments and Equipment for Experiments), all published under the auspices of the Academy of Sciences, USSR. In spite of the multiplication of scientific organi- zations in recent ye-art, it is likely that there will be even more in the future. At the beginning of 1960 it was announced that the number and scope of projects :Connected with instrument design and development work were beyond the capabilities of existing NII's and KB's and that new Nil's and KB's would be created (some of Which will be attached to the larger manufacturing establishments) and existing ones expanded. 2/ Process control instrumentation was singled out for increased develop- mental emphasis in the future. 5.2/ 3.

It is probable that the Soviet instrument industry has set its sights considerably higher than the Seven Year Plan goal for 1965 of 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion rubles. Shortly after the publica- tion in November 1958 of Ehrushehev'a theses for the Seven Year Plan, a leading official in the instrument industry asserted that these goals were insufficient, and he submitted some rough calculations to prove that an output of 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion rubles would be required in 1965 to meet the requirements of the economy for instruments. gy A goal of this magnitude vould require an average annual rate of growth of 18.7 percent for 1959-65. The increases in production that were achieved during 1959-60, coupled with the planned increase of 21 per- cent for 1961, suggest that the USSR will reach a level of production of 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion rubles in 1965. TO accomplish this goal would require absolute annual increments to production during 1961-65 of 258 million to 278 million rubles, which are considerably greater than the increments of 203 million and 169 million rubles achieved, re- spectively, in 1959 and 1960. The priority attention devoted to the instrument industry in recent years, however, and. the program for mech- anization and automation of Soviet industry, the growing number of new instrument plants, and the widespread program for expansion of existing instrument plants all indicate an effort that makes feasible the achieve- ment of the level of 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion rubles. The planned, actual, and estimated value of production of instruments* for selected years., 1958-65, is as follows glb Million Rubles 1961 Original Probable Level of Production 1958 1959 1966 Plan 1965 Plan in 1965 739 942 1,111 1,344 1,850 to 1,920 2,1100 to 2,500 * These statistics include production of opticalo-mechanical instru- ments and apparatus, electrical and electronic measuring instruments, calculators and computers, instruments for the control and regulation of thermal-energy processes, instruments for measuring mechanical magnitudes, instruments for navigation and piloting, and instruments of time but do not include cameras, [footnote continued on p. 19] -18- S-E-C-R-E-T Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 ? ?

Classification of instruments tends to be arbitrary and occasionally misleading, as even the leading Soviet professional journal in the field of instrument manufacture admits, as follows: When exaMining [the planned change in production of instruments in 1965 compared with 1958] it is necessary to keep in mind that we have treated in a somewhat arbitrary manner the distribution of instrument pro- duction by groups.

These figures probably include some, but not all, of the instru- ments destined for military use, but there is little evidence on this point. The figures-, with the exception of the probable level of 1965, are either those reported by the USSR or those derived from Soviet published figures. The figures are believed to repre- sent the quantity of instruments produced multiplied by 1955 prices and adjusted to new rubles. * Following p. 20. - 19 .- S41:-CR,-E-T Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T The change in composition in the Soviet instrument industry between the beginning and end of the Seven Year Plan has been estimated by the official Soviet journal Priborostroyeniye (in percentages*), as follows i3./: Percent of Total Production Category 1958 1965 Electrical measuring instruments 13.0 14.8 Process control instruments 11.7 27.8 Calculators and computers 7.0 9.4 Instruments for measuring mechani- cal quantities 9.3 7.7 Timekeeping devices 23.0 18.3 Other instruments (probably includ- ing optical instruments and special-purpose scientific instru- ments) 36.0 22.0 Total 100.0 100.0 The most important aspect of the character of output of instruments during the Seven Year Plan is the increase in volume of process control instruments.

Instrument plants are located in most of the other republics, includ- ing the Ukrainian SSR, Which is the second most *Portant producer. Although the USSR is demonstrating a remarkable growth in output of instruments it Appears unlike1vthatthe country will equal US output of instruments for at least another decade. Since World War II, for example, US output has increaSed at an average annual rate of growth of 11 percent and. is expected: to increase faster than 11 percent in the next 15 In 1958, US output probably was over twice that of the USSR. ??/ 1:ven at the probable upper limit of 2.5 billion rubles, the Soviet output of instruments in 1965 Will be no more than two-thirds,e?:_that7-Of the US in that year if US output con- tinues to grow as itAMO-sinceMorld War The USSR, like Up, its engdgWin large-volume pro- duction of instruments for its armed forces So little is known, how- ever, concerning the relative volume of production of this equipMent in the USSR that it is impossible to estimateitS-Magnitude. b. Production Process In spite of the extreme diversity in products and the wide range in volume of output among the various categories of equip- ment, the instrument industry for the most part pursues the same pro- grams as the other sectors of machine building. Currently, the most important of these programs include (1) an emPhasill on a high degree of mechanization in thepeodudtiOn process 5n& (2) increased standard- ization and interdhangeabilitybf components. In emphasizing a_high degree of mechanization in the production process, the objective of the industry is to achieve in- creased production at reduced ldbOor costs.

In those instrument plants visited by Western observers it has been noted that Conveyor eiseMbly line techniques are used to a much greater e*tent than in the US. Such techniques often are em- ployed in the case of production runs as small as several dozen units and are considered by the USSR to be preferable to individual assembly methods for runs as short as 2 days' duration or as law as 100 units a month. Qualified Western observers have noted the irrationality of using conveyor line techniques in small-unit runsl.particularly in the case of complex instruments where as many as 5,000 different parts are involved and where small dimensions and high precision are significant factors in the production process. ? A second important program is aimed at increasing standardization and interchangeability of components. Some standardi- zation'of parts, components, and products has been going on for many. years in the instrument industry, but the program apparently is being rapidly accelerated during the period of the Seven Year Plan. TsNIIKA, the Central Scientific. Research Institute for Complex Automation* (which is subordinate to the State Committee on Automation and Machine Building), and no less than eight other research institutes and design bureaus are primarily concerned with the application of standardization in the instrument field. Work is in progress on the development of norms for both instruments and their components, including materials and methods of manufacture. One Soviet journal recently reported even that en high-precision i ruments of diverse types can be built through the use of .14.0 to 60 percent of the standardized parts. 19/ In addition to the savings accrued through the use of standard interchange- able parts, the. industry hopes to reap an additional benefit by reduc- ing the number of parallel models. Soviet engineers believe, for example, that the number of tachometer designs can be reduced from 32 to 7, yet these 7 will have a broader range of high-precision measurement than the original. 32.. Other benefits expected from the standardization program are savings in materials, labor, and money. In spite of the increased emphasis on standardization in the Seven Year Plan and the particular attention devoted to the subject at the 1959 Plenum of the Central.Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR, it appears that progress during 199940 has been slow. Also notable is the fact that TsNIIKA has been pilloried by the press for ineffectual leadership and failure to fulfill its assigned work projects. 71/ One of the more serious problems of production facing the Soviet instrument industry is that of excessive lead time in the development of an item Of equipment.

A new Soviet inetrument occasion- ally becomes obsolete in some of its aspects by the timeit is readied for large-scale production. 3E/ In the area of instrumentation for complex weapons systems, hoWever, excessive leid time does not appear to be a problem. An even soreserious problem facing the industry is the continued production otobsolete or poor-quality equipment. The Kazan' Teplokontrol' klant,'the Krasnodar ZIP Plant, and the Tomsk Manometer Plant, far example- (producers of process control instru- ments), have been excoriated in the press for several years for failing to observe production standards and for producing obsolete or poor-quality itemsaa/ Supposedly, there is a safeguard against such a condition -- e plant has a quality contra organization, the OW, which is supposed to insure good quality-of output. In addition, the State Committee-on Measures and Measuring Instruments, which is attached to the Council of Ministers USSR, is required to make a spot check of output of a plant for adherence to production standards. Although this committee has the power to forbid produc- tion of obsolete equipment,'apPerntly it can and :does permit produc- tion of acknowledged obsolete items. 72.;/ 4. Trends in Technology In addition to attempting to triple its production of instruments during the Seven Year Plan, the USSR is making an extra- ordinary effort to raise tbe level of equipment technology. The supreme authority of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR in June 1959 and again in ally 1960 emphasized the importance of this effort. Amaze of scientific organizations is implementing this poliey deVeloping equipleht characterized by simplicity of design and advanced technical attributes. The utilization of common parts and components is being stressed to effect savings in labor, Materials, space, and time. An attempt also is being made to divelop all types of instrumentation needed by the entire spectrum of the Soviet economy. The USSR iwalread.v II long. way elotag the, road to these goals. 3?/ In its space program the country hex clearly demonstrated a high order of technology in such fields of instruientation as guid- ance, research on the upper atepsphere, and telemetry. ri Research institutes have custom-produCedt4cientific apparatus of superior technical attributes in Such-fields as high-speed photography, high- temperature measurement, anitbs phygics of hi o pressure.

Occasionally, an item of equipment produced in the USSR is such a close reproduction of an existing foreign-produced item as to be practically indistinguishable from it. In some cases a replica has modifications of the original which indi- cate a considerable degree of sophistication, as in the IKS-14 double- beam spectrophotometer, which is an improved version of the Perkin Elmer Model 21 produced in the US. gl/ Technical and scientific publications from all over the world are systematically exploited for the latest developments in practice and theory of design and application, which are then utilized in new and improved types of equipment. The designers of instruments, however, are by no means incapable of producing new departures in instrumentation. - both the equipment of domestic design and the improved facsimiles of foreign instruments reflect a high degree of Soviet technical competence in all or nearly all fields of instrumentation. Eq/ Instrumentation appears to vary widely in level of technology from one category of equipment to another as well as within each category. The disparity in levels of technology among the various types of equipment precludes the possibility of making over-all generalizations that will hold true for all the major cate- gories. The present \"state of the art\" for several of the more important categories of instruments is as follows: a. Scientific and Analytical Instruments Apparently a full range of spectroscopic equipment is produced in the USSR. The quality of such equipment is believed to be good, although not on a par with the best of comparable products of the West. The USSR ie-eapable of producing optical-gratings in the quality andin the quantities that it requires. ?1.5/ In equip- ment used for electron microscopy, in ultra-high-energy physics, - 211. - 50X1 50X1 50X1 Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 and in gas chromatography, there apparently is &substantial timelag behind the US, particularly in such areas 'as quality ,of workmanship, lack of refinements, ank.,sophistication. 'Equipment produced in the USSR for UM in interferometry and metrology apparently differs from similar equipment produced. in Western Europe and the UB, princi- pally because the Soviet equipment is much more optical in character, whereas equipment produced in the West would be electronic. Soviet optics are regarded as being very, good. tipi b. Process Control Instruments In the area of process control instrumentation the USSR is believed to be well behind the US and other Western industrial countries in technology. The USSR is deficient in instruments for the measurement of high vacuums and for the measurement of corrosive media or viscous fuels of a combustible and aggressive nature; in long-submersion thermocouples for measuring the temperature of molten steel; in continuous fluid-stream analyzers; and in automatic devices for controlling concentrations of multicomponent solutions of salts, acids, and alkalis. ??/ In the practical application of automatic control to industrial processes the USSR clearly lege behind the US, In theory of automatic control, however, the Soviet effort is con- sidered to be excellent and at least equal to comparable effort in the US and the UK. ?g/ The USSR also is believed to be strong in the theory of self-optimizing and data-sampling systems, in application of computer-actuated pneumatic controls, and in pneumatic computer components. 2/ In electronic computer development the current Soviet position reflects the emphasis accorded to analog types since the end of World War II. A, vide range of types of analog computers for routine use in schools, scientific laboratories and industry and In military applications :has been produced. Although the majority of Soviet analog computers do not meet the levelsor performance of the better analog computers produced in the US, they are clearly adequate for a wide variety of important applications. In contrast, Soviet production of digital computers until recently has exhibited a much slower rate of growth, and production technology in the digital computer field has been markedly inferior to US practice. Beginning about 1956, however, the economic effort devoted to production of digital electronic computers was intensified, and at the present time production of digital computers is Showing signs of vigorous growth. g2/ Although the current level of technology of process control instrumentation does not seemAmpresaive at first glance, there are factors at work that probably will raise this level considerably. - 25 - S-D-C-RZ72 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S -B -T It should be borne in mind that the success of the program for inte- grated mechanization and automation of industry is of utmost importance to the Soviet government. Because automatic control is the heart of precision guidance systems, continuous advancement in automatic Control theory and in complex automatic control systems is. necessary in order to keep the rocket and apace programs of the USSR moving ahead. Auto- mation also is considered to be the best means of increasing industrial production and of lowering manufacturing costs. The USSR correlates the success and progress of its social system, at least in part, with the country's economic status (including its position in world markets), and, therefore, the cost of automation is regarded as a cost to the government rather than a cost,applicable to industry. The importance that the govern- ment attaches to the development of automatic control can be seen in the caliber of the personnel assigned to work in this field. About 7 percent of the 167 Soviet academicians are working directly on automatic control. Many of the best mathematicians in the USSR also are Working on control theory in close collaboration with engineers. This support has taken the form of several new institutes to implement the translation of theory in- to practical application, and the institutes are expected to double or triple in size in the next few years. The result of this tremendous con- centration of effort should be a considerable strengthening of the research and development base in the field of automatic control and, eventually, production of a more comprehensive range of better quality instruments than are currently produced. 22/ One other category of Soviet process control instrumen- tation, radioactive isotopic devices, is of considerable significance from the point of view of its level of technology. The USSR became actively interested in this field during the Fourth Five Year Plan (1946-50) and since then has been according it preferential treatment because it is considered to be of great importance in achieving auto- mation in industry. 21/ Currently the USSR may be using radioactive Isotopic devices to a much greater extent than is the practice in the US.* In 1959 the USSR produced 800,000 curies of cobalt 60 (the isotopic element used in industrial gauges utilizing radioactive isotopes), and 1.5 million curies were to be produced in 1960, or about twice the amount being produced in the US.** At least eight plants in the. USSR are engaged in production of radioactive itiotopic instruments. 22/ * In the US, current interest is largely centered on instruments of the beta ray type because they can be so constructed as to protect workers from exposure to radiation. The USSR apparently is utilizing the instruments of both the beta ray and the gamma ray types. ** Industries in the US, however, also use other radioactive materials such as strontium-90, cesium-l37, krypton-85, and ruthenium-106. 4.26.\" S-C -R -E -T ElDeclassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 IDeclassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 4 I. S-R,-C -T c. Other Categories of Instruments In the eatepory of general inatrumentation, there is apparently little superior tedhnology: Equipment' of domestic Soviet design is sturdily built but often is large and bulky and is slightly inferior in quality to comparable Items manufactured in the US and other leading industrial countries of the West. ' Also, there is no apparent desire to strive for miniaturization, as in the US. 22/ Consumer goods such as watches and clocks and cameras are produced in a limited number of tytes and sizes and generally, from the point of view of technology, are satisfactory but peat exceptional. 212 Components, especially electronic components, also are slightly inferior to those produced in the US. Tubes, ftor exanple, have a shorter service life, and other components are' more susceptible to malfunctioning. Poor quality and inadequate quantities of com- ponents have severely handicapped Soviet production of computers. 22/ III. Patterns of Distribution A. General Although thelUSSR has a healthy and growing,instrument indus- try, output of several categories of instrumento is seriously inade- quate. A recent Soviet'stddi indicates that production of instru- ments and autamation equipment in 1958 satisfied only 60 percent of domestic requirements and. that the requirements for some types of instruments were satisfied only to the extent of 20 to 40 percent. 2W To compensate for the inadequacy of output in certain categories of instruments, the USSR has stepped up its own production program during the Seven Year Plan' and also imports a selective list of equipment to fill specific' high-priority needs. East Germany and Czechoslovakia have been and. 'probably will continue to be important Bloc sources of instruments, and.West Germany and Switzerland are major Free World suppliers. last Germany, however) is encountering serious problemi in its deVelOpment and production program and is expected to be unable to meet an important segment of its export commitments to the USSR.-V/ Soviet purchases of instruments from the West are hampered. by rade controls and by reluctance on the part of some firms to do business with Communist countries. The USSR in the past has managedito import a large volume of instru- ments in spite of these handicaps and is expected to continue to make vigorous efforts to get those high-priority instruments which are needed by its econaly but are not available within the Bloc. On the other hand, exports are not significant and are not expected to become so in the remaining years of the Seven Year Plan. - 27 - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T B. Domestic The constantly growing requirements for more and better instru- ments have led to several problems of a cyclic nature involving the in- dustry and the domestic consumer. There is the problem of achieving standardization of a new instrument yet at the same time making certain that all of the principal industries using this instrument will find it acceptable. Often it is necessary to convince an industry that this instrument should be used. rather than another specialized type that the industry wants to see developed or produced. The timelag between de- velopment and production frequently drags out over several years, and an instrument that may have been modern while under development is occasionally obsolete When produced, resulting in consumer dissatisfac- tion and a new cycle of development. 2?/ Minor problems also confront the users of instruments. Few catalog; are available, for example, making it difficult to prepare purchase orders. Also, repair shops apparently are not available in sufficient numbers. As a result, users discard equipment prematurely (thus placing an additional load on the already overburdened industry) or are forced to set up their own repair shops. Finally, a plant using a foreign-made item of equipment has a difficult time obtaining replace- ment parts, because the plants of the instrument industry refuse to pro- duce spare parts for equipment that they do not make. 22/ C. International The USSR is engaged in a small but growing volume of foreign trade in instruments. Between 1955 and 1960, Soviet exports of instru- ments increased from 11.0 million to 40.0 million rubles.* (In addi- tion, an unknown quantity of instruments was exported as parts of com- plete industrial plants.) Imports of instruments during the same period grew at a slightly slower rate, from 12.8 million to 43.3 million rubles. The Sino-Soviet Bloc is the principal trading partner of the USSR in instruments, absorbing about 95 percent of the total Soviet exports of instruments and furnishing about 75 percent of the total ( Soviet imports of instruments (see Tables 1 and 2**). The major impor- ters of Soviet instruments are }bland, Czechoslovakia, and Communist China, and the principal suppliers are East Germany (which in recent years has furnished between one-half and two-thirds, by value, of all Soviet imports of instruments), Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. * All trade figures used in this report have been drawn from offi- cial Soviet trade statistics, 1291/ are given in new foreign trade rubles, and may be converted to US dollars at the rate of exchange of 0.90 ruble to US $1. ** Tables 1 and 2 follow on pp. 30 and 31, respectively, below. -28- S-E-C-R-E-T Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T The current trends in Soviet foreign trade in instruments are expected to continue throughout the remainder of the Seven Year Flan. Recent agreements between the USSR and Hungary and Czechoslovakia have committed those two Satellites to export a very large Amount of instruments to the USSR throughout the period. 121/ Trade with the UK, West Germany, and other Western countries in instruments is expected to remain active, especially in instruments not produced in the USSR such as those for measuring high vacuums, viscous fuels, and corrosive media; balanced instruments for measuring pressure and pressure differences; and continuous fluid ptream analyzers. 122/ .1be USSR also has announced that it will import six times as many instruments in 1965 as in 1960. 122/ There is a good possibility in the next few years that the USSR will resort to dumping tactics to market same of its time- keeping devices in the West. Output is extremely large at present and is scheduled to increase substantially by 1965. This outlook has been of concern to Some Western producers. 12!!/ The USSR has announced its intention to export a much larger quantity of measur- ing and control instruments in 1965 than at present. It is believed, however, that the critical requirements of the domestic economy will cause this announcement to be soon forgotten. 125./ Virtually all foreign trade in instruments has to be con- ducted through one of the state monopolies established for this purpose. Until recently, several monopolies had responsibility for different types of equipment in this category. It now appears that V/0 Mashpriborintorg, the All-Union Association for Foreign Trade in Instruments,* is the successor to several or all of the organizations that coordinated the trade in instruments in the past. 12?/ * Vsesoyuznoye Obnyedineniye Mashinostroyeniye Pribori Inostrannaya Torgovlya. - 29 - S-E-C-R7ET Id Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/07/29: CIA-RDP79R01141A002200080001-7 S-E-C-R-E-T Table 1 Soviet Exports of Instruments 1955-60 Category 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 Value IV (Thousand Rubles) Percent to the Bloc Value 1.)/ (Thousand Rubles) Percent to the Bloc Value .h./ (Thousand i_j_sis_Rbl Percent to the Bloc Value lot (Thousand it.Lj_.esub Percent to the Bloc Value ?../ (Thousand t_2,...0.1._Rtol Percent to the Bloc Value ki (Thousand Percent to Rubles) the Bloc Seismic stations 933.8 95.8 1,329.1 100.0 477.5 78.6 760.4 92.8 980 61.7 , 1,026 63.5 Movie cameras and apparatus 690.8 97.4 983.6 88.3 1,163.1 70.1 945.9 74.2 1,194 71.8 1,103 71.2 Calculating machines and spare parts 290.5 100.0 924.1 99.6 758.3 71.4 593.5 84.3 1,823 66.3 1,356 54.62/ Precision instruments 6,023.0 99.4 7,699.1 99.0 11,454.7 90.7 15,592.3 98.2 15,355 98.5 16,602 94.7 Timekeeping devices 2,189.4 99.7 5,582.4 98.9 6,908.6 97.9 10,996.2 99.3 15,469 97.4 18,966 96.7 Cameras (still) 903.5/ 94.1 1,655.4J 96.0 2,143.9 93.6 2,371.8 95.5 908 85.8 936 76.1 Accessories for cameras 2/ 2/ 8.8 94.9 79.5 94.9 63 76.2 60 68.3 Total. 11,030.9 98.6 18,173.7 98.2 22 914.9 91.2 31 339.6 97.3 35.79e 94.1 40,049 92.2 Instruments exported as a part of equipment and materials for complete plants are not included in these figures.
