Development of a new modern competitive economy in Eastern Ukraine and establishment of an additional stimulus for development of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are an integral prerequisite for gradual reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories into the unified constitutional space of Ukraine. Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts shall become a territory for implementation of special economic and legal conditions for comprehensive implementation of the system of economic processes management and organization that may be subsequently scaled up to the entire territory of Ukraine. Introduction of special conditions will envision formation of priority development territories, state incentivizing of development and implementation of new economic development models that will serve as the unifying mechanism, the basis of which is simple and clear logic, namely, well-being of residents. Conceptual approaches to the economic development of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are the following: Implementing the Concept Note of Economic Development of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts (hereinafter referred to as the Concept Note) which covers territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts where public authorities perform their authorities in full with the possibility of further scale-up of the economic system to the temporarily occupied territories after their reintegration into the unified constitutional space of Ukraine; Taking into consideration requirements under international commitments of Ukraine, namely, the Association Agreement between Ukraine, on the one hand, and the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community, and their member states, on the other hand, other regulations on European and Euro-Atlantic integration, Protocol of Accession of Ukraine to the World Trade Organization as of 5 February 2008, agreements on free trade zones; Taking into consideration the vector of sustainable development of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts pursuant to Decree No. 722 of the President of Ukraine as of30September2019“OnSustainableDevelopmentGoalsofUkrainetill2030”.\n\nAnnex 5\n\n2 Authorities to make expenses from the state and local budgets shall correspond to the scope of revenues and shall be formed based on realistic indicators of economic and social development of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Special modes on the priority development territories shall be introduced simultaneously with measures aimed at ensuring the balanced nature of the state budget. Taking into account the key role of production in generation of demand for innovation, focus on the production sphere will have a decisive meaning for recovery of the economy of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In this region there will be formed priority development territories, industrial, agricultural production, infrastructure, and tourist clusters, innovation centers. The priority will be a wide use of the ideology of partnership between the state and business as the organizational and economic framework for development of the investment model of relations between the state, local self-government bodies, and economic entities. In order to achieve this, within the shortest possible period there will be formed a pool of industrial, construction, logistic, transport, engineering, financial suggestions that may generate a comprehensive solution for recovery and modernization of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In many instances, production capacities of enterprises of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and many other oblasts of Ukraine will be engaged. Problems That Need to Be Solved Armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine has caused temporaryoccupation of about 3 percent of the territory of Ukraine located in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts where about 4 million people resided. The total numberof the population in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2020 amounts to 6.2 million people. Consequences of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation have primarily impacted the real sector of economy, namely, coal, metallurgic, machine building, chemical industrial enterprises located in eastern regions which accounted for a significant share of internal industrial production and export. Over 40 percept of the negative contribution to the Gross Domestic Product dynamics in 2014–2015 was caused by the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in Donetsk and Luhanskoblasts.Hence,thecountry’sGrossDomesticProducthasdecreasedbyapproximately 10 percent as compared to 2013. The industrial and agricultural economic complex with the predominant development of heavy industry was formed in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Regions with the area amounting to 8.8 percent of the area of the country produced 25 percent of industrial produce and 8 percent of agricultural produce. Enterprises were located in clusters (coal, metallurgic, heavy machine building, energy, chemical), most industries of the specialty were of interregional and international significance. According to different estimates, Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts accounted for one fourth of all export of Ukraine.\n\nAnnex 5\n\nAnnex 6 Law of Ukraine No. 1682-VII “On Government Cleansing (Lustration Law)”, 16 September 2014\n\nThis document will not be distributed at the meeting.
