The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:09 p.m., in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Ron Johnson (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senators Johnson, Gardner, Shaheen, Murphy, and Kaine. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON JOHNSON, U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN Senator Johnson. This hearing is called to order. I want to start off by thanking all the witnesses for taking the time, traveling here, and preparing some thoughtful testimony. I also want to offer my condolences to all of those who knew Boris Nemtsov, who considered him a friend and comrade. A real tragedy happened a day, I think, after we noticed this hearing. It certainly was not one of the things I wanted to talk about, certainly nothing we contemplated. The purpose of this hearing is really to lay out a reality. It is to tell a story, and the story that needs to be told is what has become of Russia since Vladimir Putin has come to power. I am not going to tell the story. These gentlemen are going to be telling the story. Unless we understand the reality, unless we are willing to face the reality, unless we are willing to grapple with the reality, Vladimir Putin will continue his aggression, and it will not only destabilize Eastern Europe, it will destabilize the entire efforts of all those who want to seek peace and prosperity in the world. We have a couple of photographs that I want to highlight. Starting to my right is a picture of Boris Nemtsov, a very courageous man that I had the privilege of meeting in my office, a man who brought to my office a longer list of people who needed to be added to the Magnitsky list. Unfortunately in the next picture right behind Senator Gardner is a picture of Boris Nemtsov having been assassinated with the Kremlin in the background. Now, that would be somewhat similar to an assassination carried out on Constitution Avenue with the Capitol in the background. In my written opening statement, which I would ask to be entered into the record, we have laid out a timeline that starts with the fall of the Berlin Wall and then traces through the history. But in particular, I want people to pay attention to the history following the ascension of Mr. Putin to power in Russia. And I think probably the most powerful part of that timeline are the 29 assassinations of political figures, 29 assassinations and murders that have never been adequately solved. I think people need to really contemplate that. Next picture, and we do not have the quote on there. This picture is actually a Ukrainian rebel talking about the number of Russian troops that he was thankful for that had entered Eastern Ukraine. The next picture is one of tragedy, as Malaysian Flight Number MH17 was shot down out of the sky on July 17 of 2014. Two hundred and ninety-eight innocent civilians were murdered. This shows a picture of that. And then we have scenes of the devastation in Eastern Ukraine. So that is a little pictorial history of the results of Vladimir Putin's aggression, and that is the story that needs to be told. That is the reality that needs to be faced. [The prepared statement of Senator Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Ron Johnson Good morning and welcome. Today's hearing--the subcommittee's first hearing in the 114th Congress--is about documenting the history of Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe and making sure that we, here in America, fully understand how dire the situation truly is. We need to face harsh reality and the fact that Ukraine needs our help in the form of defensive lethal military equipment, and it needs that help today. In March 2014, with hardly any pushback from the West, Crimea was annexed by Russia. Prime Minister Yatsenyuk came to America last year asking for our help in his country's battle to ensure its territorial integrity. We should have immediately provided a minimal level of defensive lethal aid that Ukraine so desperately wanted. We should have taken it a step further by asking, ``What else do you need?'' America needed to show resolve then, and it desperately needs to show leadership and strength now, not only in Ukraine but around the world. On December 5, 1994, the Budapest Memorandum was signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. In this agreement, Ukraine gave up the world's third-largest nuclear weapons stockpile in return for security assurances against threats or the use of force against its territorial integrity and political independence. Only 20 years later, Russia has blatantly broken its promise by brazenly violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine. No one should be surprised by this behavior from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Under his leadership, Russian aggression against its neighbors has been building for years. The summarized timeline of Russia's destabilizing actions detailed below clearly demonstrates the threat Putin represents to neighboring democracies.

Providing military equipment to Ukraine is not the only answer, but it is a necessary part of the answer. Ukraine needs economic and governance reforms, but those can succeed only in a peaceful and independent nation. We all heard President Poroshenko address a joint session of Congress on September 18, 2014, and plainly state that his country needs more military equipment. ``Blankets and night-vision goggles are important,'' he said, ``but one cannot win a war with blankets.'' He went on to say, ``Just like Israel, Ukraine has the right to defend her territory--and it will do so, with all the courage of her heart and dedication of her soul!'' The Ukrainian people are willing to fight for their country. They just need a little help from their allies in America. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and learning how we can best support our allies in confronting this regional destabilization. Thank you. I look forward to your testimony. Again, I want to thank the witnesses, and I will turn it over to Senator Shaheen for her opening comments. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEANNE SHAHEEN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE Senator Shaheen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your focus and work to bring this hearing together today. I want to echo your comments about the tragic killing of Boris Nemtsov. He was a tireless voice for all Russians and a firm believer in a bright future for the country. And even as we focus here on the Russian Federation's outward aggression, clearly we cannot ignore the repression that is happening inside Russia. In the interest of time, I will submit my full statement for the record, and just want to end by welcoming all of our witnesses here today, and it is nice to have former President Saakashvili back with this committee today. And I look forward to hearing what all of you have to say and your thoughts about what more we can be doing to support the people of Ukraine. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Senator Shaheen follows:] Prepared Statement of Senator Jeanne Shaheen Thank you, Chairman Johnson. I want to commend you for your focus and leadership on this critical foreign policy issue and for your work to bring this hearing together today before the Subcommittee on Europe. I also want to echo your comments about the tragic killing of Boris Nemtsov, who was a tireless voice for all Russians and a firm believer in a bright future for that country. Even as we focus here today on the Russia Federation's outward aggression, clearly, we cannot ignore the repression inside Russian today under President Putin. The Russian people and the world demand a transparent investigation into Mr. Nemtsov's murder and I sincerely hope we will see that. Russia's refusal to allow some foreign officials to attend his funeral was not a promising sign. As the Chairman noted, we have five impressive witnesses here to help us better understand Russia's pattern of interference and aggression in Eastern Europe and think through appropriate responses. I join the chairman in thanking you for appearing here today. Today, we see a Russian foreign policy that flouts international norms and responsibilities, a foreign policy that is based on political, economic, and even military intimidation and aggression. Airspace violations, disinformation and propaganda campaigns, energy corruption and trade restrictions are just a few of the tools used by Moscow. Through Operation Atlantic Resolve and, the European Reassurance Initiative, the U.S. is already providing substantial support to our European partners, including Ukraine. That support should continue. In fact, it should be increased. We should consistently look for opportunities to assist our friends in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, including helping them strengthen their political systems and economies through reform not for our benefit, but for the benefit of the people of those sovereign nations. Congress, and particularly this committee, has played a critical role in this effort. Just last December, Congress passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which authorized the President to provide defensive military assistance to Ukraine and tighten economic sanctions on Russia. I hope the administration will make use of these authorities. I welcome your suggestions for what more we should be looking to do in Congress. Once again, thank you all for being here, and we look forward to hearing from each of you. Senator Johnson. Thank you, Senator Shaheen. We do have a vote that is going to be called, and I believe that what is going to happen with that vote is we are going to be sitting in our chairs. So what we will do is when that vote is called, we all will leave. We will put this hearing into recess, and we will come back because I do not want anybody to miss the testimony. But we will start off with President Saakashvili, former President of Georgia. He was the leader of Georgia from 2004 to 2013. Recently, he was appointed by Ukrainian President Poroshenko to serve as chairman of the International Advisory Council on Reforms of the President of Ukraine. President Saakashvili? STATEMENT OF MIKHEIL SAAKASHVILI, FORMER PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA, AND CHAIRMAN, INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL ON REFORMS OF PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, KIEV, UKRAINE Mr. Saakashvili. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Johnson, thank you, Senator Shaheen, thank you, Senator Gardner, for this wonderful initiative. I want to thank you, the committee and subcommittee, for the invitation. Perhaps it is a little unorthodox to find the former President representing the interests of another nation before the U.S. Senate, but I think the distinguished members of this committee understand why I have gone from being President of one nation to helping the President of another. Ukraine and Georgia are on the front lines of the fight that may seem far away, but it is very much the fight that the American people and certainly the U.S. Congress understand more than anybody else in the world. This is not a fight about territory, about railway junctures, this or that town. This is a fight about principles, ideals, a way of life. This is a fight to determine whether we can escape from this curse of Soviet corrupt, cronyist, inefficient societies to being efficient democracies based on rule of law. Ukraine, and here is the story of a Budapest memorandum, which I have to remind the members of the committee, Ukraine gave up 1,800 warheads, one-third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, to help secure peace in post-cold-war Europe. That was on the insistence of United States. The United States, among other big powers, was the guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty and their statehood based on the Ukraine giving up their weapons. Even more than that, on the insistence of this country and other great powers, the Ukraine has diminished its defense capabilities from having almost 1 million people serving in the military down to 120,000. Ukraine has neutralized the 120,000 tons of ammunition and mines. They have incapacitated 6,000 tanks for the last decades, and that was the time when they were complying with all their treaty obligations, while Russia was building up their military protection and propping up their muscles. And now here we are. Ukraine has given all this up hoping that they will be guaranteed peaceful future. Certainly they were not planning to attack anybody. And instead of giving up several thousand nuclear warheads, they are asking basically for several thousand antitank missiles to defend themselves and to check Russian tanks deep into their territory, as well as some of their weapons. And certainly, supporting Ukraine at this moment means, first of all, in addition to all the other support, also giving them means to defend their democracy, and to support them building a viable, strong Ukrainian democracy. And I think it is now imperative to U.S. security and the world's security. The old markers of Putin's reign are the gravestones of his critics and opponents. Every marker we can think of at this time is about increasing control of Russia or the Russian- speaking world. In September 1999, as director of FSB, Putin sent troops into Chechnya. Three months later he was Acting President of Russia. In August 2008 he invaded my country, Georgia. Three months later the constitution was changed to assure that when Putin returned to the Presidency, it would be a 6-year term. Putin's military excursions are always the prelude to the centralization of his personal power. This has made Russia more unpredictable and Europe and the United States less secure. One year ago as the corrupt regime of Yanukovych fell, Russian forces moved into Crimea, then Ukraine, then there was downing of a passenger jet, as you rightly pointed out, Senator. In September of last year, President Poroshenko addressed the Joint Session of the Congress, and we are grateful for this opportunity. And he also asked that Ukraine requires defensive assistance because if not given that, Russia will continue to establish facts on the ground that will give them stronger position in the kabuki of future negotiations, and basically in the killing of Ukraine democracy. I think what Russia is up to is seizing the whole southern flank of Ukraine, seizing most of the east, and then going after the government in Kiev, and killing the very idea of Ukraine democracy. After the war in 2008, a de facto ban on arms sales to Georgia was in place; as then, opponents were saying that providing Ukraine with lethal weapons would provoke Russia to escalate this conflict. But this appeasement ignores that Putin's aim is destabilize Ukrainian democracy. Adequate forces can stop aggression. In 1980, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles raised the cost to the Soviets in Afghanistan. That was the most decisive factor in the eventual defeat of the Soviet Army. That is why it is very important that while there also Europeans who are doing the negotiations, the United States should take the lead empowering regional actors like Poland, and joining with forces with supportive nations like U.K. and the Baltics to create a coalition to help to arm and train the Ukrainian Army. Ukraine must reform. I have focused on the case for arming Ukraine because without this there will not be a country to rebuild. But its success will equally be determined by fighting corruption, bringing the economy out of the shadows, increasing revenues to the state budget, and delivering better lives to the people of Ukraine. American support of all these efforts for the Ukrainian economy is critical, but time is short, and underneath the deception of the formation of war, the Russian plan is clear. They will seize more of the Ukraine. As I said, they will depose the government in Kiev if not checked in time. Only the swift and the immediate action of the United States Government to train and equip the Ukrainians can stop Putin's strategy to deconstruct the transatlantic architecture, to deconstruct the post-cold-war order. America and the free world won Second World War, and Americans won the First World War, and they won the cold war. What we are seeing is a dramatic situation where all these gains might be reversed. Georgia is a small country, but when we were invaded in 2008, after the failed deal with the Europeans, it took the United States and many members of this very Congress to stop them by starting the humanitarian military operation, which did not involve sending U.S. boots on the ground, but certainly involved sending strong signals to the Russians that they should stop. This war is much more complex than just war on the ground. This is a propaganda war. It is about controlling minds; and in this war we have yet to begin to fight back, to empower the Russian people to look at their own country and their own region, and to prevent encroachment of the Russian narrative into our politics and media. It was not just NATO army that saw the spread of communism. It was a collection of strong ideals with an army standing behind it. America, the origin of many of these ideals, was always further away from the front, and, thus, more able to resist the seeming appeal of realist moral compromise. The same must be true today. A democratic, secure Ukraine is the last nation between the revanchist Russia and America, and, overall, the free world. Thank you, Senator, for hearing my testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. Saakashvili follows:] Prepared Statement of Mikheil Saakashvili Good afternoon. I want to thank the Foreign Relations Committee for the invitation to speak here today. Perhaps it is a bit unorthodox to find the President of one nation representing the interests of another before the United States Senate, but I think the distinguished members of this committee understand why I have gone from being a President to serving one. Ukraine and Georgia are on the front lines of a fight that may seem far away from here. But Ukraine is what stands between America and Russian aggression. Ukraine earned its right to aspire to Western integration when it gave up over 1,800 warheads--one-third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal--to help secure peace in post-cold-war Europe. Twice since, the people of Ukraine have taken to the streets to defend this right. Supporting Ukraine--including by giving them the arms they need to fight for their future and by supporting their efforts to build a viable, strong, Ukrainian democracy and state--is now imperative to American security. The road-markers of Putin's reign are the gravestones of his critics and opponents. His years in power can be measured by the rollback of federalization, rights, freedom, and opportunity. Every marker we can think of in his timeline is about increasing control of Russia and the Russian-speaking world. In September 1999, as director of the FSB, Putin sent troops into Chechnya. Three months later he was Acting President of Russia. In August 2008, he invaded Georgia. Three months later the constitution was changed to ensure that when Putin returned to the Presidency, it would be for a 6-year term. Putin's military excursions are always the prelude to the centralization of his personal power. This has made Russia more unpredictable, and Europe and the United States less secure in economic and military terms. We don't know yet what will follow the invasion of Ukraine. One year ago, as the corrupt regime of President Yanukovich fell, Russian forces moved into Crimea. Moscow later announced the annexation of the peninsula. Russian military and intelligence operatives stirred up unrest in the Donbass region of Ukraine, which grew into a full-blown war including the participation of tens of thousands of Russian regular forces. Russian involvement increased after the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet by Russian air defenses that had been illegally brought into Ukraine in August 2014. In September, President Poroshenko addressed a joint session of Congress with the request to provide Ukraine with defensive assistance. In bilateral talks with the U.S., Ukrainian officials have continuously submitted requests for assistance and defensive weapons. Ukraine has been provided some nonlethal assistance, including radars to help detect mortars, bulletproof vests, and some other basic aid and equipment. But what will strengthen Ukrainian defense is lethal weapons-- specifically, antitank weapons that can halt further Russian advance. When Russia knows there will be little cost to them to take the territory, they will take the territory. They will continue to establish facts on the ground that will give them a stronger position in the kabuki of future negotiations. The arguments for withholding lethal aid are ones Georgia knows well: after the war in 2008, a de facto ban on arms sales to Georgia was in place. We couldn't even buy spare parts for our American rifles. As then, opponents say that providing Ukraine with lethal weapons will provoke Russia to step up its military involvement and escalate the conflict. But this appeasement ignores that Putin's aim is to unseat the government in Kiev and fully destabilize Ukrainian democracy. But adequate force can stop aggression: in the 1980s, shoulder- fired Stinger missiles raised the costs for the Soviets in Afghanistan so much that this was the single most decisive factor in the eventual defeat of the Soviet Army. As Putin's popularity soars post-Crimea, the one crack in his armor is the mounting, secret human cost of his war. To raise the cost for the Kremlin--on the front line and at home-- further advances have to come with the fear of increased casualties. The importance of maintaining a joint position with the Europeans is also cited frequently. But Ukraine has little reason, historic or contemporary, to hope for German support. The United States should take the lead, empowering regional actors like Poland and other neighbors of Ukraine, joining with supportive nations like the U.K. and the Baltics to create a coalition to arm and train the Ukrainian Army. Ukraine must reform. I have focused today on the case for arming Ukraine because without this, there won't be a country to rebuild. But this is not to say its success will not be equally determined by fighting corruption, bringing the economy out of the shadows, increasing revenue to the state budget, and delivering better lives to the people of Ukraine. American support of all those efforts, and support for the Ukrainian economy during the war, is critical. But time is short, and underneath the deception and the information war, the Russian plan could not be more transparent. They will seize more of the east and south of Ukraine; send defeated Ukrainian troops back to Kiev; and attempt to destabilize the social and economic situation enough that pressure mounts and the democratically elected President and Government of Ukraine collapse or are overthrown. Only the swift and immediate action of the U.S. Government to train and equip the Ukrainians, as well as providing them with economic assistance, can stop Putin's strategy to deconstruct Europe, the transatlantic architecture, and transatlantic aspirations. Putin is willing to fight in ways we are not. Georgia is a country of 4 million people--and Putin sent tens of thousands of troops to invade our country. Since 2008, Russia has spent well over a billion dollars propping up the budgets of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2015, while the Russian state budget is being cut by 10 percent across the board, Russia's payments to South Ossetia have increased by 19 percent. Add to that the costs of military deployments to, and arrangements with, these regions. Add to that the costs of backing anti-European, xenophobic groups in Tbilisi to whittle away support for Euro-Atlantic integration under a government attempting rapprochement with an aggressive and bullying neighbor. Add to that the costs of the media and documentaries and reports Russia has funded to blame the 2008 war on Georgia and its NATO aspirations. The list goes on. This is what Putin is willing to commit to ensure Georgia will not have a future that Russia does not dictate. He did this only to ensure that NATO could not offer Georgia a concrete pathway to membership. He did this so his narrative at home is secure. And as Putin has made clear--Ukraine is a nearly divine cause for him. We understand only shadows of the billions of dollars he has spent to keep Ukraine in the ``Russian world.'' According to U.N., over 6,000 people have been killed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Up to 20 percent of the industrial capacity of Ukraine has been removed or destroyed. A million people have been displaced. In the past year, Russia has also backed political parties, heavy propaganda, and sharp economic pressure to erode support for Europe in Moldova, hoping to change the political landscape even before their territorial conquests in Ukraine bring the Russian Army closer to Moldova's door. And what Moldovans fear is that if Europe hasn't helped Ukraine--a far larger, richer, and more strategically important nation--Moldova will become a footnote of the regional conquest. The price Putin is willing to pay, and to exact, is higher than we want to imagine. In Georgia, in 2008, we fought because if we didn't fight for our sovereignty and our democracy and our independence, no one else ever would. It was, to be sure, an emotional choice--but also the rational one. We couldn't win a military war with Russia--but it is the ideological war that we believed needed to be fought, and won. Fighting for our beliefs made many uncomfortable. Ukraine fights now for the same reason, and its Western friends are no less uncomfortable with their war. But make no mistake: Putin attacks Ukraine to weaken Europe, and to weaken NATO. When he makes the calculation that the time is right, he will cross the Article 5 line, probably in ways that are not expected. While we deliberate about definitions--Russian or Russian-backed, vacation or invasion--Putin will be fighting, and winning, an ideological war against the only force that has ever been able to contain and turn back expansionist Russian exceptionalism. His war is a propaganda war. It is about controlling minds. And in that war, we have yet to begin to fight back to help empower the Russian people to look at their own country and their region--and to prevent the encroachment of the Russian narrative into our own politics and media. It was not a NATO army that stopped the spread of communism. It was a collection of strong ideals with an army standing behind it. America, the origin of many of these ideals, was always further away from the front, and thus more able to resist the seeming appeal of realist moral compromise. The same must be true today. A democratic, secure Ukraine is the last nation between revanchist Russia and America. Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. President. Do we have time? Voice. Votes just started. Senator Johnson. Okay. We will recess at this point in time and hopefully be back in about 10 to 15 minutes. So, again, I apologize for that, but, again, this is an important hearing, and we are looking forward to your testimony. Thank you. This hearing stands in recess. [Recess.] Senator Johnson. This hearing is called back to order. Our next witness will be Mr. Garry Kasparov. He is the chairman of the International Council of the Human Rights Foundation. Mr. Kasparov is a Russian pro-democracy leader, global human rights activist, author, and former world chess champion. Mr. Kasparov. STATEMENT OF GARRY KASPAROV, CHAIRMAN, HUMAN RIGHTS FOUNDATION, NEW YORK, NY Mr. Kasparov. My thanks to the subcommittee and to Senator Johnson for inviting me here today. It has been a very difficult last few days mourning the brutal murder of my long- time friend and colleague, Boris Nemtsov, in front of the Kremlin last Friday night, while also wanting to honor his memory and his fight by pressing the case for ending the regime of Vladimir Putin in Russia. I have learned from painful experience that these first days after an atrocity are very important because people outside Russia quickly forget and move on. Boris was an outspoken critic of a police state that has no tolerance for critics. His imposing presence regularly embarrassed an increasingly totalitarian dictatorship that could not permit even the smallest amount of truth to leak out. His latest report was to be on the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine, fighting Putin's war against a fragile democratic state in Europe. Boris also actively promoted the Magnitsky Act, a piece of rare bipartisan 2012 legislation that brought sanctions against Russian officials for not a brutal murder, but that of anticorruption attorney Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. Boris Nemtsov was killed because he could be killed. Putin and his elites believe that after 15 years in power, there is nothing they cannot do, no line they cannot cross. Their sense of impunity, combined with an atmosphere of hatred and violence and Putin's propaganda, has created in Russia a lethal combination. Boris was not the first victim of this deadly mix. Georgia, Ukraine, and the stability of the modern world order is also under attack. Putin must justify his grip on power somehow. With his oil- and gas-based economy failing, he is following the path of Soviet dictators before him: propaganda, division, and war. Enemies are needed so that Putin may protect Russians from them. Ukraine was always a tempting target, and the recent leaks have shown that an invasion plan existed even before the fall of Putin's puppet, Viktor Yanukovych. Inside Russia, independent journalists and opposition activists are portrayed as dangerous national traitors in language lifted directly from the Nazis. Of course, I feel deeply the loss of my friend, Boris Nemtsov, and the prosecution of others who dare to speak against Putin. But it is Ukraine and what it illustrates about Putin and his regime that are more consequent to today's hearing. Since Putin took power in 2000, one Western administration after another declined to confront him on human rights at home or even his increasing belligerence abroad. The timeline of Russian repression circulated here today does an excellent job of listing many of the worse moments of Putin's crackdown. But there could also be a parallel timeline of all the meetings, deals, and smiling photo ops the leaders of the free world took with Putin while these atrocities were taking place. The Western engagement policy that should have been abandoned as soon as Putin showed his true colors over a decade ago was continued at every turn, which emboldened Putin and delegitimized our opposition movement. Putin rebuilt the police state in Russia in full view of the outside world, and now he is confident enough of his power to attempt to export that police state abroad to Georgia, to Ukraine, to Moldova. Where next? He is testing NATO now, and he will test it further. Putin also provides a role model for the rest of the world dictators and thugs by proudly defying the superior forces of the free world. From Iran to Syria to Venezuela, Putin's Russia provides both materiel support and what I would call amoral support. Putin is not going away on his own. Ukraine is only his latest target. Ukraine must be defended, supported, and armed now. It may seem far away to you, but it is a front line of a war the United States and the rest of the free world is fighting whether it admits it or not. Sanctions are important, but it is obvious 6 months ago that they were not enough to deter Putin, and he must be deterred. Stop treating Putin like any other leader who can be negotiated with in good faith. Stop legitimizing his brutal regime at the expense of the Russian people. The opposition movement Boris and I believed in and that Boris died for should also be openly supported, the way the West championed the Soviet dissidents. Let the people of Russia know that they have allies abroad the way Ronald Reagan told us--all of us behind the Iron Curtain that he knew it was our leaders, not us, who were his enemies. Contrary to the widely circulated official polls, Putin does not enjoy broad public support in Russia, as was proved by hundreds of thousands of people mourning Boris in the street of Moscow. If you are truly popular, you can allow free media and free elections, and your critics are not gunned down in the streets. Putin's oligarch supporters must be forced to choose between giving him up and a doomed isolation. They cannot be allowed to continue to live like Trump and rule Stalin. The people of Russia want to be free, but defeating a globalized and energy-rich, heavily militarized dictatorship that has the tacit support of the free world is too much to ask. You cannot negotiate with cancer. Like a cancer, Putin and his elites must be cut out. He must be isolated and removed, for only when Putin is gone can Russia be a free, strong, and independent country Boris Nemtsov always dreamed it could be. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Kasparov. Our next witness is Dr. Stephen Blank. He is a senior fellow for Russia at the American Foreign Policy Council. He is an internationally known expert on Russia and the former Soviet Union, and is the author of over 1,000 publications. Dr. Blank. STATEMENT OF STEPHEN BLANK, PH.D., SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COUNCIL, WASHINGTON, DC Dr. Blank. Senator Johnson, it is a great honor to testify before your subcommittee with this exceptionally distinguished group of witnesses. Because my written statement deals with purely military issues, in my oral remarks I wish to talk about the broader strategic issues involved. Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine represent the greatest threat to European security in a generation, the most naked case of aggression since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, and arguably the most dangerous threat to international security and order today. It is the fruit of a long-developed plan whose origins can be traced back to 2005. Russia has several objectives here. Many have already noticed that in keeping with the rhythms of Russian history, there is the belief that a little short victorious war can buttress the regime at home around a program of Russian imperialism and state nationalism. Further, it is an axiom of Russian foreign policy that none of the post-Soviet states, including those of Eastern Europe, really possess genuine sovereignty and territorial integrity. Therefore, the treaties guaranteeing that sovereignty and territorial integrity are merely scraps of paper. This sentiment applies with particular force to Ukraine for it is clearly inconceivable to the Russian elite that Ukraine can follow a different trajectory than does Russia. Moreover, a Ukraine that looks westward is the greatest possible threat to the security of Putin's regime because it will infect Russia with the democratic virus. Indeed, the entire legitimacy of any Russian state is bound up with its being the true heir of Kievan Rus. If Ukraine rebels against or rejects Russia's trajectory, then the entire legitimacy of the Russian state is called into question. This is especially the case because Putin and his team believe that empire is the only acceptable form of a Russian state, and Russia must, therefore, be an empire if his autocracy and kleptocracy are to be preserved. For all these reasons, a democratic revolution in Ukraine is anathema to Moscow and a pretext for an invasion. Operationally, Moscow still intends to seize Mariupol, establish a land bridge to Crimea, and, if it could do so, establish as well as land bridge all the way to Moldova. Plans for this were already laid a year ago. Beyond destroying any possibility of an independent Ukraine, Moscow intends to overthrow the entire post-cold-war settlement of 1989 to 1991 in Europe and globally, and to do so by systematically applying the synchronized instruments of pressure we now know as so- called hybrid warfare. These policies predict more to any competent analyst, but unfortunately this administration and too many European governments do not take what happens in Russia seriously enough. Neither do these governments think Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet states are sufficiently important for us to have a real strategy regarding them. This Russia-first strategy lies at the root of the continuing and shameful Western failure to understand or grapple with Russia and its aggressions seriously enough or to provide assistance to Ukraine as needed. As administration officials candidly admit, there is ``an asymmetry of will'' or of importance whereby Ukraine is supposedly more important to Moscow than it is to us or to European governments, and this inhibits us helping Ukraine as needed. Indeed as reported on February 27 by the Wall Street Journal, the United States is slow rolling the provision of intelligence to Ukraine. Given the stakes involved for Ukraine, its neighbors, and partners, European and international security, this is an unacceptable policy. It undermines the credibility of NATO, of the United States, Europe, and beyond, and encourages aggression, and not only by Putin, and not only by Europe. Therefore, the importance of these hearings should be clear to everyone, and I welcome the opportunity to testify before the committee today. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Blank follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Stephen Blank Ukraine needs military help from abroad in terms of weapons, training, and finances to help sustain its government and economy in the face of Russian aggression. At a conference of the Potomac Institute, U.S. analysts and Ukrainian military leaders reported that the Ukrainian military continues to be severely disadvantaged by not being equipped with a list of the items that are becoming well known to those watching the current situation in eastern Ukraine: secure communications systems; antitank guided weapons with tandem warheads; counterbattery radars; UAVs for both reconnaissance and strike missions; and the ability to stream multiple intelligence sources into centralized command centers to get inside the ``decision loop'' of the Russian-backed forces.\\1\\ Therefore, Ukraine needs and has requested these capabilities, secure communications equipment, countermortar or counterbattery weapons, antiair, and antitank weapons and missiles. Ukraine also clearly needs UAVs or weapons to use against Russian drones. It also needs weapons to counter Russian artillery fire by the use of intelligence capabilities to determine the source and point of origin of those fires and then take them out. Ukraine also needs to devise an effective, democratic command and control structure that allows competent officers to rise to positions of responsible command, to train proficient officers whom men will follow and who understand modern warfare, and create a basis for integrating volunteers into a regular army commanded and led by proficient officers committed to democracy. In American terms it needs both an Edwin Stanton and a George Marshall. It also needs to sustain patriotic morale to counter manifestations of draft dodging and to demonstrate to the world that it is reforming. Right now it needs weapons as outlined above urgently as well as financial assistance and a long-term plan of both energy and financial assistance and steady support for (as well as pressure from outside) to reform its government and economy. At the same time, there is little doubt that the White House and the NSC are holding up sending weapons to Ukraine at this point. But whatever their reasons are, there is little doubt that the Ukrainian Army will fight and with assistance can prevail over the rebels as long as Russia cannot operate freely there. Indeed, the fighting to date shows that only with substantial Russian help and the takeover of the operation by the Russian Army can the so-called rebels prevail in battle. If anything, this key fact justifies the provision of weapons and training to Ukraine as part of a broader strategy to wrest the strategic initiative away from Russia and give it to Ukraine and NATO. The signs of this dependence on the Russian Army are evident everywhere. According to the IHS consultancy firm, Ukrainian authorities and the Potomac Institute, there are currently 14,400 Russian troops on Ukrainian territory backing up the 29,300 illegally armed formations of separatists in eastern Ukraine. These units are well equipped with the latest main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, plus hundreds of pieces of tube and rocket artillery. There are also 29,400 Russian troops in Crimea and 55,800 massed along the border with eastern Ukraine.\\2\\ --Russian units have made heavy use of electronic warfare (EW) and what appear to be high-power microwave (HPM) systems to jam not only the communications and reconnaissance assets of the Ukrainian Armed Forces but to also disable the surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated by cease-fire monitoring teams from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Russian EW teams have targeted the Schiebel Camcopter UAVs operated by the monitors and ``melted the onboard electronics so that drones just fly around uncontrolled in circles before they crash to the ground,'' said one of the briefers at the conference. Russian EW, communications and other units central to their military operations are typically placed adjacent to kindergartens, hospitals, or apartment buildings so that Ukrainian units are unable to launch any strikes against them without causing unacceptable and horrific collateral casualties. --The war against Ukraine is not a ``new'' strategy for Moscow; the Russian general staff has been preparing for Ukraine-type combat operations since 1999. Indeed, the Ukrainian operation has been planned by Moscow at least since 2005 and it is incomprehensible why the administration could not, or would not, formulate an assessment of what was happening in February 2014.\\3\\ This speaks to our willingness and capability to assess Russian moves correctly and it is not encouraging. --The Russian military's Zapad 2013 exercise (the word ``Zapad'' meaning ``West'' in Russian to denote that it was an operation designed to practice operations against NATO) was a dress-rehearsal for parts of the Ukraine campaign and future potential operations against the Baltic States. The exercise involved 76,300 total troops, 60 percent of which were drawn from the same Russian Interior Ministry (MVD) units that were used in the Chechen conflicts of the 1990s. --Russia's information warfare campaign includes budgeting for the state-run Russia Today network (more than USD300 million per annum) and support for pro-Russian NGOs (USD100 million per annum).\\4\\ Russian casualties are much higher than imagined and reports of the true number of dead, wounded, POW and/or MIAs would undermine Putin at home. Second, Russian tactics are rather crude, essentially being massive artillery and air shelling of enemy positions. Such tactics mandate a traditional enormous output of ammunition and artillery. The numbers of shells being expended periodically forces Russia to accept truces in order to replenish its forces in Ukraine who are in full command of this operation. There are an estimated 17-20,000 Russian forces in Ukraine brought together or even cannibalized from many different Russian military units in order to bring ground, air, antiair, and support functions into the theatre. In addition, there is a substantial reinforcement of the naval, air, and missile forces in the Crimea, including nuclear-capable or so called dual use weapons being brought to Crimea. We can learn the following lessons from this analysis. First, Putin cannot escalate the scale of conflict beyond present limits without antagonizing NATO further into a full-scale protracted war and he cannot afford that. He is also reputedly very afraid of media reports of the true extent of what evidently are sizable numbers of Russian casualties. For example, according to Ukrainian sources, at Debaltseve, 1,300 Ukrainians and 4,500 Russians were killed.\\5\\ Why we are not publicizing Russian casualties escapes me. Third, there is every reason to believe that if NATO mobilized its resolve and capabilities to give Ukraine weapons and training as part of a comprehensive strategy that Ukraine's morale and capabilities would improve to the point of imposing much greater costs on Russia which is reaching the limit of its capabilities. Putin is already bringing troops form Central Asia and Siberia to Ukraine, indicating a manpower shortage and a lack of desire inside Russia to fight Ukraine. There are also many reports of disaffection within the Russian military. In other words, whereas NATO has hardly engaged, Russia is already feeling the pressure. Russian tactics and strategy have aimed to keep the fighting at a level under NATO's ``radar'' to avoid a too protracted war. It appears Putin aims to create his ``Novorossiia'' and present the EU with a fait accompli by mid-year to persuade a divided Europe to remove sanctions and thus escape the risk of a protracted war. We have it within our power, if we can find the will to do so, not just to impose costs on Putin but to regain the overall strategic initiative and take it away for him by helping Ukraine to defend itself. What is needed here and in Europe and Kiev is a comprehensive strategy that embraces not only military but also strong economic and informational means to thwart this effort to sustain Putin at home, destroy an independent Ukrainian state, overturn the post cold war status quo in Europe, undermine European integration, and hasten the rupture of the transatlantic alliance. Our continuing passivity allows this shameful conquest and the spread of state terrorism and criminality orchestrated by Moscow and its subalterns in Crimea and Ukraine to spread with impunity. We must realize that this is the most naked aggression since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 and respond accordingly to what is the greatest threat not just to European security but to international order. For if we do not do so, others will be even more emboldened by our inaction and confusion as we have seen with ISIL in the Levant and we can see with China in the South China Sea, and with Iran in regard to state-sponsored terrorism and nuclear proliferation. Continued passivity invites more escalation, and not only by Putin, whereas soundly conceived and implemented resistance upholds not only our values but even more importantly, our interests, both in Europe and across the globe. ---------------- End Notes \\1\\ Reuben F.

Senator Johnson. Thank you, Dr. Blank. Our next witness is Mr. Damon Wilson. He is executive vice president of the Atlantic Council. His areas of expertise include Central and Eastern Europe, NATO, and U.S. national security issues. From 2007 to 2009, Mr. Wilson served as special assistant to the President and senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. Mr. Wilson. STATEMENT OF DAMON WILSON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, ATLANTIC COUNCIL, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Wilson. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the committee, President Putin today poses a direct threat to American interests and values. His war in Ukraine aims to tear up the post-cold-war order and undermine American credibility. If we fail to stop Putin in Ukraine, we will face a series of conflicts and crises in the months and years to come. At best, Putin may consolidate his autocratic grip at home and subjugate 75 million in Europe's East to a fate determined in Moscow. At worst, emboldened, Putin may be tempted to challenge a NATO ally directly. The choice we face, however, is not between fighting Russia or doing nothing. Rather, I believe doing nothing may lead to our fighting Russia. In this context, I would like to make five points. This crisis began long before Crimea. Indeed, Russia's annexation of Crimea was the natural outcome of a clear, consistent policy dating back years. I detail this record in my full testimony. Second, Putin will not stop until he encounters serious pushback. Third, only the United States can galvanize Europe and the international community around an effective strategy to deter Putin for the long term. Fourth, any strategy should urgently and decisively back Ukraine, as well as other vulnerable states with significant economic and military assistance in the short term, while keeping the door open to the European Union or NATO. And fifth, we should neither abandon the Russian people nor the vision that a democratic Russia one day can find its peaceful place within a Europe whole and free. Putin's strategy has been to use this crisis to consolidate his own hold at home through greater oppression of civil society and independent media even as he fuels nationalist fervor. He has created an environment of fear and intimidation fostering the circumstances that led to the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. Putin, of course, is also seeking to dominate his neighbors, to drain them of resources to fuel his kleptocracy, and to restore a sense of Russia's greatness in the only way a bully knows. He aims to prevent his neighbors from joining either NATO or the EU, achieving this through coercion when possible and by dismemberment and occupation when necessary. Ultimately Putin knows that the best check on his power is a united transatlantic community, and he has sought to divide Europe, undermining the resolve for sustained sanctions. But the most tempting objective for Putin is to call into question the credibility of NATO's Article 5 mutual defense commitment as doing so would effectively end NATO. A Russian move against an ally, such as a Baltic State, cannot be ruled out. Putin has demonstrated time and again that if he senses an opportunity to act he will, convinced that the West lacks the will or the ability to take decisive action. That is why today's situation is dangerous. We have seen repeatedly that Putin's objectives expand with success and contract with failure. This means that the best determinant of his action is Western action. There is a tendency, however, to argue that the Europeans should take the lead on Ukraine. After all, we have our hands full with ISIS and other global responsibilities. But the Ukraine crisis is a Russia crisis, and Russia is too big, too strong, and too scary for Europe to resolve this without us. Without U.S. leadership, Europe may feel forced to accommodate a revanchist Russia, and we have seen throughout history this is a dangerous formula. The United States has the ability to rally its allies and international partners around a comprehensive strategy that not only deters Putin's aggression, but avoids an unstable gray zone in Europe East. To do so, we should begin by articulating what we want to achieve. We should more decisively increase the cost to Russia, including by enacting sectorial sanctions and targeting Gazprom and Putin directly. The most effective response is Ukraine succeeding and becoming a modern European state, and yet Western assistance to date is modest. There is no governmentwide concerted effort to assist Ukraine. There is no response commensurate with how we react to support campaigns like Ebola or ISIS. The United States is uniquely positioned to assist Ukraine to defend itself and to raise the cost of further Russian military action against Ukraine. Putin, after all, has lied to his own people about Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. But by reassuring Putin that we will either not provide or greatly constrain our military and intelligence assistance, we signal to the Kremlin what Russia can get away with. Any assistance package should, therefore, be substantial, including antiarmor missiles, as well as intelligence support. Such a U.S. decision could unlock lethal military assistance from many of our allies. The U.S. Congress could also endorse a more substantial military presence along NATO's eastern flank, call for a halt to any further U.S. force withdrawals from Europe, and order a review of the U.S. force posture. Such a package could be designed to leverage U.S. commitment to European security to secure greater European commitments to defense investment. We should respond to aggression in Europe's East by consolidating Europe's South. This would mean inviting Montenegro to join NATO and intensifying efforts to build United States strategic partnerships with Serbia and Cyprus. We should harness America's energy prowess to increase global supply while support European efforts to create a European energy union that includes Ukraine. And we should be explicit about our intention to negotiate a transatlantic trade and investment partnership that is open to Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. As long as either KGB veterans retain their grip on the Kremlin or the nations in between NATO and Russia remain trapped in an insecure gray zone, we will face continued challenges and conflict. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Wilson follows:] Prepared Statement of Damon M. Wilson Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shaheen, members of the committee, President Putin today poses a direct threat to American interests and values. His war in Ukraine and his effort to sow division among our allies are aimed at tearing up the post-cold-war order and undermining American credibility and influence. If we fail to stop Putin in Ukraine, we will face a series of conflicts and crises in the months and years to come. At best, Putin may consolidate his autocratic grip at home and subjugate 75 million people in Europe's East to a fate determined in Moscow. At worst, an emboldened Putin may be tempted to challenge a NATO ally directly, hoping to deal a decisive blow to the alliance. The choice we face, however, is not between fighting Russia or doing nothing. Rather, I believe doing nothing may lead to our fighting Russia. We are better than that. The United States can take the lead in galvanizing the transatlantic community behind a comprehensive strategy, including ensuring that a well-functioning and well-armed European Ukraine emerges from this crisis. In this context, I would like to make five points: (1) Russia's war in Ukraine today is the natural outcome of Putin's policies in recent years (and the lessons he drew from our successive lack of responses). (2) Putin will not stop until he encounters serious pushback. (3) Only the United States can galvanize Europe and the international community around an effective, comprehensive strategy to deter Putin for the long term. (4) Any strategy should urgently and decisively back Ukraine as well as other vulnerable states with significant economic and military assistance in the short term, while keeping the door open to the European Union (EU) or NATO for Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. (5) We should neither abandon the Russian people nor the vision that a democratic Russia one day can find its peaceful place within a Europe whole and free. This crisis began long before Crimea. Indeed, Russia's annexation of Crimea was the natural outcome of a clear, consistent policy dating back years. As confrontation replaced cooperation with the West as a source of legitimacy for the Kremlin, Russia meticulously laid the groundwork for what we are witnessing today. Former President Medvedev set out the doctrine of a ``privileged sphere of interests.'' Putin articulated the ``compatriots policy'' in which Russia claimed the right to defend the interests of Russian speakers outside its borders, and it began distributing passports to strengthen its claims. Russia undermined diplomatic efforts to resolve so-called frozen conflicts, and maintained Russian occupying forces as ``peacekeepers.'' At the last NATO--Russia summit in 2008, Putin ridiculed the idea of Ukraine as an independent state and questioned the status of Crimea in front of NATO leaders who had just failed to agree to begin preparing Ukraine for NATO. His creeping annexation of Georgia's breakaway regions prompted the Russian-Georgian War, consolidating his occupations. Russia both developed contingency plans and exercised seizing its neighbors' territory. Putin increasingly began wrapping all of his actions in a pseudo-ideology of Orthodox chauvinism. He countered EU outreach with his own Eurasian Economic Union premised on coercion rather than attraction. Putin's intimidation tactics led Armenia first to abandon its EU association bid before forcing former Ukrainian President Yanukovych's about-face. Russia tried and failed to use economic coercion and energy threats to sway Moldova. In the Ukraine crisis, Putin first probed with little green men to determine his freedom of maneuver in Crimea and, in the absence of resistance, brazenly seized the territory. The Kremlin then stoked the idea of a ``Russian Spring'' across southern and eastern Ukraine, creating the myth of Novorossiya and seeking to spark spontaneous revolts using ``political tourists'' from Russia. When that failed, Russia introduced Special Forces and intelligence operatives in Slavyansk, using the town as a base from which to seek to destabilize eastern Ukraine. And once Ukrainian forces gained their footing, nearly defeating the rebel forces, Russia opted for full-scale invasion. Today, the so-called separatists--former miners and farmers according to Putin--command greater quantities of the most advanced heavy weaponry than most European NATO nations. While Ukraine is ground zero in the current struggle, there is no doubt that Putin's sights are firmly fixed on the two tiny nations that have dared stand up to his bullying: Moldova and Georgia. Moscow attempted to sway Moldova's recent elections with massive support for new pro-Kremlin parties, is courting separatists, and is poised to destabilize the nation. Despite Georgia's efforts to normalize relations with Moscow, Russia has continued its creeping annexation of Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In the first instance, Putin has used this crisis to consolidate his own hold on at home, through greater repression of civil society and independent media even as he fuels a nationalist fervor. He has created an environment of fear and intimidation, at a minimum fostering the circumstances that led to the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. After all, the protests led by Nemtsov, much like the Maidan in Ukraine, pose a potentially existential threat to Putin's regime. Putin, of course, is also seeking to dominate his neighbors, to drain them of resources to fuel his kleptocracy, and to restore a sense of Russia's greatness in the only way a bully knows--intimidating the weak, closest to him. Furthermore, he aims to prevent any of his neighbors from joining either NATO or the EU, achieving this through coercion when possible and by dismemberment and occupation where necessary. Ultimately, Putin knows that the best check on his power is a united transatlantic community. Hence, he has sought to divide Europe, undermining the resolve for sustained sanctions. But the most tempting objective for Putin is to call into question the credibility of NATO's Article 5 mutual defense commitment, as doing so would effectively end both NATO and America's role as a great European power. A Russian move against an ally such as a Baltic State cannot be ruled out. Putin has demonstrated time and again that if he senses an opportunity to act, he will, convinced that the West lacks the will or ability to take decisive action. Debaltseve is only the latest case in point. This is why today's situation is so dangerous. Putin will not stop and this crisis will not end until he encounters serious pushback. We have seen repeatedly that Putin's objectives expand with success and contract with failure, or even the increased chance of failure. This means that the best determinant of his action is Western action. There's a tendency, however, in Washington to argue that the Europeans should take the lead on Ukraine--after all we have our hands full with ISIS and other global responsibilities. This approach fails to understand that only the United States can galvanize Europe and other members of the international community around a tough-minded comprehensive strategy to deter Putin. The Ukraine crisis is a Russia crisis after all. And Russia is too big, too strong, and too scary for Europe to resolve this without us. Germany may be a political and economic powerhouse, but Putin knows Chancellor Merkel cannot enforce European diplomacy. While the Chancellor has done a remarkable job in holding Europe together in this crisis, no European state can afford to get into a confrontation with Russia. Without U.S. leadership in this crisis, Putin might succeed in creating a new dividing line in Europe. As he creates facts on the ground, he shifts the goalposts of what becomes an acceptable outcome in European diplomacy focused on ending violence. Europe may feel forced to accommodate a revanchist Russia rather than check its power. As we've seen throughout history, this is a dangerous formula. Only U.S. leadership in this crisis provides the necessary condition to ensure the sustained resolve of our allies, most of who are bearing a far greater economic cost to their own economies. Our strategy today is basically to raise the costs on Russia by imposing sanctions, protect NATO, and count on the long-term fundamentals, which are on our side and are working against Russia. The problem is that we have an immediate crisis. Putin likely sees the immediate future as his best window of opportunity. And in the short term, we may see a group of nations lose their sovereignty and Russia tempted to push further into NATO territory. We can avoid this outcome. The United States has the ability to rally its allies and international partners around a comprehensive strategy that not only deters Putin's aggression, but also avoids an unstable grey zone in Europe's east. To do so, we should begin by articulating our vision--what we want to achieve. I contend that should be a Europe whole, free, and at peace that embraces democratic nations in Europe's east and in which Russia can find its peaceful place in Europe. We should more decisively increase the costs to Russia, including by refusing to treat Putin (and the FSB) as normal interlocutors, expanding the economic sanctions to include Putin and his inner circle, targeting Gazprom directly, and letting Moscow know that we are considering cutting off Russia from SWIFT financial transactions. The most effective response is Ukraine succeeding in becoming a modern European state. We very well may see a shift from the military battlefields of the Donbas to the financial markets. Putin after all is out to win all of Ukraine, not simply consolidate his hold on a slice of territory in the east. And yet U.S. and European assistance to date is modest. There is no governmentwide concerted effort to assist Ukraine comparable to the White House-led effort to implement the reset with Russia. There is no response commensurate with how Congress reacted to support campaigns against Ebola and ISIS. The amounts of assistance under consideration are too small to serve as the catalyst for reform in a nation of over 50 million people. We are far more generous helping Jordan weather the Syria crisis as we plan to provide $1 billion in assistance to a nation of over 6 million. We provided $1 billion to 4.5 million Georgians after Russia's invasion. While the IMF and EU can and will contribute more to Ukraine, the U.S. sets the tone and for now the tone is ambivalent. Assistance to Ukraine should include substantial military assistance. The United States is uniquely positioned to assist Ukraine to defend itself and to raise the costs of further Russian military action against Ukraine. There is no military solution in Ukraine and no one wants Ukraine to suffer a full-scale war with Russia. But by reassuring Putin that we will either not provide or greatly constrain our military and intelligence assistance, we signal to the Kremlin what Russia can get away with. Our current posture is escalatory as it gives Russia the confidence it needs to believe it can achieve particular means through military options at acceptable costs. Any assistance package should therefore include substantial military assistance, including lethal military assistance such as antiarmor missiles, as well as intelligence support. Such a U.S. decision could unlock lethal military assistance from Canada and several other European and Asian allies. We should also support large- scale training in civil resistance in Ukraine as part of creating a deterrent state. One vehicle for such assistance could be an expansion of the European Reassurance Initiative and renaming it the European Reinforcement Initiative to underscore its focus on building well- armed, well-trained deterrent states including frontline allies, key partners such as Finland and Sweden, and states under duress including Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Within NATO, even as we continue to implement the good Wales summit decisions, the alliance should also move away from ``reassurance,'' which focuses on the insecurities of our allies, and embrace ``deterrence,'' which underscores the threat. To this end, the U.S. Congress could endorse a more substantial U.S. and NATO military presence along NATO's Eastern flank until such time as Putin demonstrates that Russia is no longer a threat or potential threat to our allies; support a focused training effort to build frontline states' military capacities; call for a halt to any further U.S. force withdrawals from Europe; and order a review of U.S. force posture including how to prioritize Russia in determining the availability of forces to U.S. combatant commands. Such a package could be designed to leverage such U.S. commitments to European security to secure greater European commitments to defense investment. Russia's aggressive new posture has translated into an intense diplomatic effort to buttress Russian influence elsewhere, especially in southeast Europe, and to disrupt ongoing European integration processes. We should respond to aggression in Europe's East by consolidating Europe's South. This would mean inviting Montenegro to join NATO, undertaking a renewed push to resolve the Macedonia name impasse, and intensifying efforts to build U.S. strategic partnerships with Serbia and Cyprus. A comprehensive transatlantic strategy to deter Putin should expand the playing field to areas of strength for us--energy and trade. We should harness America's energy prowess to increase global supply, while supporting European efforts to create a European energy union that includes Ukraine and Moldova from that start. At the same time, we should be explicit that our intention is to negotiate a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that is open to European nations who have deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with the EU, notably Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. At the same time, the United States must work much more closely with its allies on how to mitigate Russian efforts to sow dissension within the alliance. Such efforts begin with more transparency and stronger financial disclosure laws and practices in our societies to expose potential Russian manipulation of institutions, media, or political parties. Western leaders must also assume responsibility for countering the Russian propaganda war by being willing to speak publicly and clearly about Russia's actions. If we are unable to recognize the threat Putin poses to our interests or challenge the misperceptions that surround this conflict, we are unlikely to formulate an effective, sustainable strategy sufficient to deter him for the long term--a strategy that is pursued not with confrontational rhetoric, but with resolve and determination. As long as either KGB veterans retain their grip on the Kremlin or the nations in between NATO and Russia remain trapped in an insecure grey zone, we will face continued challenges and conflict. The Russian people, as we saw on the streets of Moscow Sunday, will some day have a say about their leaders. But the United States and its allies--along with Ukrainians, Moldovans, and Georgians--have a say about the latter. Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Our final witness is the Honorable Steven Pifer. Am I pronouncing that correctly? Ambassador Pifer. Yes, sir. Senator Johnson. Good. Mr. Pifer is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and was a former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000. He is a retired Foreign Service officer with over 25 years at the State Department focused on United States relations with the former Soviet Union and Europe. Mr. Pifer. STATEMENT OF HON. STEVEN PIFER, DIRECTOR OF THE ARMS CONTROL AND NONPROLIFERATION INITIATIVE, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, DC Ambassador Pifer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Senator Shaheen, Senator Gardner, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the West's policy response. With your permission I will submit a written statement for the record and summarize it now. What began as an internal Ukrainian political dispute became a conflict between Russia and Ukraine in early 2014. Moscow has used military force to seize Crimea, supported armed separatists, and sent regular Russian Army units into Eastern Ukraine. After a September cease-fire agreement failed, a second cease-fire, referred to Minsk II, was agreed to in February. That agreement is fragile at best. Its implementation will prove difficult. Driving Russia's aggression has been a mix of geopolitical and domestic political considerations, including the fear that the Maidan demonstrations in Ukraine could provide a model that the Russian people might emulate. The Kremlin's goal appears to be to destabilize the Ukrainian Government and make it harder for Kiev to address its urgent economic reform agenda and draw closer to the European Union. The West has responded with sanctions. While having a major impact on the Russian economy, the sanctions have not yet achieved their political goal, to effect a change in the Kremlin's policy toward Ukraine. Beyond Ukraine, the United States and Europe face a broader Russia problem. Moscow has operated its military forces in a provocative manner, and asserts a right to protect ethnic Russians and Russian speakers wherever they are located and whatever their citizenship. That could pose a threat to other states in the region, including Estonia and Latvia, both members of NATO. In response, the United States and the West should pursue a multipronged strategy to deal with Russia's violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and Moscow's generally more confrontational approach. That strategy should have five vectors. First, NATO should bolster its ability to deter Russian threats to the alliance's members, particularly in the Baltic region. This entails enhancing NATO conventional force capabilities, including capabilities to deal with the hybrid war techniques that Russia has used in Ukraine. Second, the West should support Ukraine, including through provision of substantial financial assistance if Kiev proceeds with serious economic reforms. If the Minsk II cease-fire by some chance holds and other terms of the agreement are implemented, but the Ukrainian economy collapses, that will hardly represent a success for Western policy. Third, the West should maintain sanctions on Russia until Moscow demonstrates a full commitment to a negotiated settlement in eastern Ukraine and takes demonstrable and substantive measures to implement that settlement. Should Russia not do so, or should separatists and Russian forces resume military operations, the United States and European Union should rapidly move to impose additional sanctions. It is important to make clear to Russia that its egregious behavior will have significant costs so that the Kremlin does not come to believe it can pursue hybrid warfare elsewhere at a tolerable price. Fourth, the United States should make preparations to provide increased military assistance to Ukraine, including defensive arms, particularly light antiarmor weapons. Provision of that assistance should proceed if the separatists or Russians violate the cease-fire, or if Moscow fails to implement the full terms of the Minsk II agreement. The assistance would fill gaps in the Ukrainian Army's ability to defend Ukraine against attack. The rationale is to enable the Ukrainian Army to impose costs on the Russian military, to deter Moscow from further fighting, and to encourage it to pursue a peaceful settlement. Some express concern that U.S. provision of defensive arms would lead Russia to escalate, but escalation would carry major risks for Moscow. It would require more overt involvement by the Russian Army in eastern Ukraine. That would be more visible internationally, likely triggering additional sanctions, and to the Russian public, from whom the Kremlin has sought to hide the fact that Russian soldiers are fighting and dying in Ukraine. Others worry that providing arms would split U.S.- European unity. There is no evidence to back that. To be sure, Chancellor Merkel says that Germany will not provide arms, but during her visit in Washington on February 9, she did not give the President a red light or threaten a breakdown in transatlantic solidarity. And other allies would likely provide Ukraine defensive weapons once the United States began to do so. Fifth, the United States should leave the door open for Russia to change course and help settle the conflict, even if expectations of such a change in Moscow's policy should be and are modest at best. Finally, while Ukraine has correctly deferred the issue of Crimea now, the West should continue to not recognize Russia's illegal annexation of the peninsula. Mr. Chairman, Senator Shaheen, distinguished members of the subcommittee, Russia's actions on Ukraine and its more confrontational approach represent a serious challenge to the United States, Europe, and the West. Dealing with the Russian challenge requires a multipronged strategy based on firmness, patience, and solidarity with United States allies and friends in Europe. But given the large differences in economic, military, and soft power between the West and Russia, the West should be fully able to meet that challenge. Thank you for your attention. [The prepared statement of Mr. Pifer follows:] Prepared Statement of Steven Pifer introduction Mr. Chairman, Senator Shaheen, distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and the U.S. and West's policy response. What began as an internal Ukrainian political dispute became a Ukraine-Russia crisis in early 2014. Since then, Moscow has used military force to seize Crimea, supported armed separatists and ultimately sent regular Russian army units into eastern Ukraine. A cease-fire agreement was reached in Minsk last September, but the separatists and Russians failed to implement its terms. The Minsk II cease-fire agreed on February 12 may now be taking effect but seems fragile at best. Implementing other terms of the agreement will prove difficult. Driving Russia's aggression has been a mix of geopolitical and domestic political considerations. The Kremlin's goal over the past year appears to have been to destabilize and distract the Ukrainian Government, in order keep that government from addressing its pressing economic, financial, and other challenges as well as from drawing closer to the European Union through implementation of the EU--Ukraine association agreement. Beyond Ukraine, the United States and Europe face a broader Russia problem. Moscow has operated its military forces in a more provocative manner near NATO members and has asserted a right to ``protect'' ethnic Russians and Russian speakers wherever they are located and whatever their citizenship. That policy could pose a threat to other states, including Estonia and Latvia, both members of NATO. The United States and the West should pursue a multipronged strategy to deal with Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and Moscow's generally more confrontational approach. First, NATO should bolster its ability to deter Russian threats to the alliance's members, particularly in the Baltic region. This means enhancing NATO conventional force capabilities there, including capabilities to deal with the hybrid warfare techniques that Russia has demonstrated in Ukraine. Second, the West should support Ukraine, including through provision of substantial financial assistance if Kiev proceeds with a serious reform agenda. Avoiding a financial collapse of Ukraine will require that the European Union and United States supplement the International Monetary Fund's extended fund facility program. Third, the West should maintain economic and other sanctions on Russia until Moscow demonstrates a full commitment to a negotiated settlement in eastern Ukraine and takes demonstrable and substantive measures to implement that settlement. Should Russia not do so, or should separatist and Russian forces resume military operations, the United States and European Union should impose additional sanctions. Fourth, the United States should make preparations to provide increased military assistance to Ukraine, including defensive weapons. Provision of that assistance should proceed if the separatists or Russians violate the cease-fire, or if Moscow fails to implement the terms of the Minsk II agreement. Fifth, the West should leave the door open for Russia to change course and help end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, even if expectations of such a change in Moscow's course are modest at best. Finally, while Ukraine has correctly deferred the issue of Crimea for now, the West should continue to not recognize Russia's illegal annexation of the peninsula. If Russian actions regarding eastern Ukraine merit sanctions relief, the United States and European Union nevertheless should maintain some sanctions, including measures specifically targeted at Crimea, until the peninsula's status is resolved to Kiev's satisfaction. russia's aggression against ukraine Russia and the other independent states that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 agreed to respect the state borders as they existed at the time. Unfortunately, Russia did not hold to that commitment. The Kremlin has supported separatist efforts and ``frozen'' conflicts in Transnistria, a breakaway part of Moldova, and South Ossetia and Abkhazia, breakaway regions from Georgia, whom Russia recognized as independent states following the August 2008 Georgia- Russia conflict. Moscow has again violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another state, this time, Ukraine. Ukraine went through a wrenching internal political crisis from November 2013 to the end of February 2014, triggered by then-President Yanukovych's surprise decision not to sign an association agreement with the European Union. Following the security forces' use of deadly force against demonstrators in Kiev on February 19-20, Mr. Yanukovych signed a power-sharing agreement with the three main opposition party leaders. Given public anger over the killings the two previous days, it is unlikely that the opposition leaders could have persuaded the demonstrators to accept the agreement. In any case, they had little chance. After signing the document, Mr. Yanukovych abandoned his post and disappeared, later turning up in Russia. What had been an internal political crisis became a Ukraine-Russia conflict at the end of February 2014, when soldiers, in Russian combat fatigues without insignia, seized Crimea. The Ukrainians referred to them as ``little green men.'' In a March 3 press conference, President Putin denied that they were Russian soldiers. Just weeks later, he publicly admitted that they were and awarded commendations to their commanders. In April, armed separatists began to seize buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Many were pro-Russian locals, but more ``little green men'' appeared. Moscow supported the separatists with funding, arms, and leadership. For example, last April, the self- proclaimed Prime Minister and Defense Minister of the so-called ``Donetsk People's Republic'' came from Russia and had apartments in Moscow. Further evidence that outsiders played a major role in the early days was the seizure of the opera house in Kharkiv, which they apparently mistook for the city administration building. Over the course of the late spring and summer, as Ukrainian forces conducted a counteroffensive in Donetsk and Luhansk (also referred to as the Donbas), Russia provided the separatists with heavy arms, such as tanks, artillery, and surface-to-air missile systems. These apparently included the Buk (SA-11) surface-to-air missile that tragically shot down Malaysia Air flight 17 in July. The Ukrainian military nevertheless made progress against the separatists during the summer, significantly reducing the amount of territory they held. On or about August 23, regular units of the Russia Army invaded Ukraine and attacked Ukrainian units in the Donbas. When a cease-fire agreement was worked out in Minsk on September 5, Ukrainian losses reportedly included between 50 and 70 percent of the armor the Ukrainian Army had deployed in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Unfortunately, the September cease-fire never took full hold. The separatists and Russians did not implement key elements, such as the requirements for withdrawal of foreign forces and military equipment, or for securing the Ukraine-Russia border under observation by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Instead, the Russian-backed separatists over the next 5 months took additional territory in eastern Ukraine, adding more than 500 square kilometers to what they had held on September 5. Last month, with fighting escalating, German Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande met with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and Russian President Putin in Minsk to seek a new settlement. After a marathon all-night negotiation, they announced a new agreement (Minsk II) providing for a cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy weapons away from the line of contact, and a series of steps to regulate the political and economic status of eastern Ukraine. The terms of Minsk II are substantially worse for Kiev than the terms of the unfulfilled September 2014 agreement. Implementing the Minsk II agreement will require good faith and flexibility on all sides that has not been shown previously during this conflict. Many analysts expect the agreement to break down at some point. It appears that Mr. Poroshenko agreed to Minsk II in the face of a deteriorating military situation and an urgent need for breathing space so that he could focus attention on a looming financial crisis and a very necessary economic reform agenda. Given Mr. Poroshenko's acceptance of Minsk II, Ukraine's supporters have little choice but to support the agreement and its implementation, however difficult its terms may appear. Unfortunately, the separatist and Russian forces did not initially observe the cease-fire, which was supposed to begin on midnight on February 14. They attacked the Debaltseve salient occupied by Ukrainian Army units, which withdrew on February 18. The Ukrainians then reported ominous signs of preparations for a separatist/Russian attack on the large port city of Mariupol in southern Donetsk province. Greater restraint was shown after February 25. While some shelling continues, the line of contact has been markedly quieter than it was during the first week "
