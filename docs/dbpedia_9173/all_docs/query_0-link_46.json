The purely military or partisan guerilla authorities, as well as local administrators of \"White\" or \"Red\" central or regional governments are not listed, however \"White\" governors-general are recorded. Some polities did not fit into traditional \"White\" and \"Red\" designations and were known as \"Green\" (mostly anti-Bolshevik rural Socialists, see Black Sea, Tambov or Tobolsk) or \"Black\" (anarchist, see \"Makhnovschina\" under Ukraine).
