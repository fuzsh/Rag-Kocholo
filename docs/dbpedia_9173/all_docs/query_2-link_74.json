After mass violent clashes with the police\n\nstarted on Sunday, in which a leading role was played by a far-right network of\n\ngroups called Right Sector, there is no doubt that people in the eastern and southern\n\nregions would condemn the protests even more. This is unfortunate because the\n\nagenda of the protest has shifted from a desire to be associated with Europe to the\n\nstruggle against the police state after parliament ripped up the constitution and\n\nrushed through laws restricting, among others, the freedom of peaceful assembly\n\nand freedom of speech.\n\nThe Right Sector militants did not appear from nowhere, although many media and\n\nliberal protesters preferred to ignore their existence. They were active participants\n\nin the protest from the very beginning, interested not so much in European\n\nassociation as the \"national revolution\". They efficiently infiltrated the volunteer\n\nguards of the tent camps.\n\nOn 1 December, they were the main force behind the violent attack near the\n\npresidential administration, contrary to the popular version that blamed\n\ngovernment provocateurs. When, last Sunday, Vitali Klitschko, the most probable\n\nnext president of Ukraine according to the polls, tried to stop clashes with police, he\n\nwas booed. Many protesters, who could not imagine themselves throwing stones\n\nand molotovs at the police line before, joined the violence of the extreme right,\n\nfrustrated at the lack of progress after coming each Sunday to listen to the same\n\ntalks from opposition leaders.\n\nYet those who may be thrilled with the illusion of an all-national revoit are\n\nforgetting that this is another step in the normalisation of the far right. Right Sector\n\nhas already efficiently mainstreamed its slogans (\"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the\n\nheroes!\", \"Glory to the nation! Death to enemies!\", \"Ukraine above everything!\"). We\n\nmust not forget that these are people with sometimes overtly neo-Nazi ideas who\n\nwould eagerly pass even more repressive laws, but only against other, ethnically\n\ndefi.ned enemies.\n\nSevera! thousand people are participating in the violent clashes but, outside the two\n\ncentral squares and several neighbouring blacks, everyday life in Kiev is going on as\n\nusual..\n\nhttps://www. theg uard ian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/22/u krai ne-protests-eu rope-far-rig hl-violence 2/4\n\nAnnex 61\n\n9/26/22, 4:36 PM Ukraine protests are no longer jus! about Europe I Volodymyr lshchenko I The Guardian\n\nThis week, though, riot police demonstrated that they can restore control over the\n\nstreets in a few minutes and that they are ready to open fire against protesters - two\n\nhave been killed with gunshots, as of midday on Wednesday.\n\nWhat could be the alternative to this dead-end of senseless rallies without action\n\nand no less senseless violence? The negotiations that started between the\n\nopposition and some representatives of the government seem to be only an attempt\n\nto cairn down the protesters. However, on Monday, students at Kyiv-Mohyla\n\nAcademy, one of the best universities in Ukraine, started an indefinite strike against\n\nthe police state laws, aiming to stop completely teaching in their university and\n\ninitiate political strikes on other campuses and workers strikes as well. Ifthey\n\nsucceed, they could show the way to a non-violent but still radical and efficient way\n\nto bring down Yanukovych's government.\n\nop1• n1• on\n\n•• The January 6\n\ncommittee has its sights on\n\nGinni Thomas.

PUTIN from the \"United\n\nPeople's Committee of Donbass\"\n\nAnnex 64\n\n(name of the structure as agreed on the spot)\n\nDear Vladimir Vladimirovich!\n\nCitizens of Donbas are addressing you!\n\nWe appeal to you as our hope for our future and the future of our children.\n\nFor several months now, Ukraine has been plunged into a series of disastrous\n\nevents that are leading our society into socio-economic collapse, civil war and\n\ndivision. The Kiev junta has introduced repression and arrests against Russianspeaking\n\ncitizens. The practice of politically motivated criminal prosecutions is\n\nbeing introduced in the centre of today's Europe. Free access to information and\n\nRussian television channels is being blocked.\n\nAll these months we, the residents of Donbas represented by its People's Militia,\n\nhave been trying to express our popular protest against the political course pursued\n\nby the Kiev junta using all available democratic procedures. We regularly gather\n\nmass rallies of thousands at which people unanimously demand that the authorities\n\nhear the voice of the people and meet the demands of their citizens.\n\nHowever, the new Ukrainian authorities do not want to hear their people. Instead,\n\narrests and repression are being carried out against us: people are threatened with\n\ndismissals, \"closing\" of businesses and criminal cases. Some are simply abducted\n\nand taken to Kiev, where they are then held in prisons and cells.\n\nMany of our supporters, driven to despair, decide to leave for other states to save\n\ntheir families. Others of our adherents are prepared to fight to the end and take\n\nactive street action.\n\nWe do not want to go anywhere! We want to live in our own land! We want peace\n\nand stable development. Donbass has everything necessary for this: rich natural\n\nresources, developed infrastructure, talented and enterprising people.\n\nBut the junta in Kiev is deliberately leading us towards war and destruction. We do\n\nnot want that and we are ready to fight for our future and the future of our children!\n\nThe entire state apparatus is now working against us. The combat forces of the\n\nUkrainian army are already being drawn to our lands and ordered to oppose their\n\nown people.\n\nIn this regard, we appeal to you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, as the last hope for our\n\nfuture and the future of our children. Only in Russia do we see the sole defender of\n\nour culture of the Russian world. Only the peacekeeping contingents of the Russian\n\narmy will be able to send a convincing signal to the junta in Kiev, which came to\n\nAnnex 64\n\npower through arms and blood. We are ready to fight and die for our ideals and for\n\nour convictions! But without your support, without Russia's support, it will not be\n\neasy for us alone to resist the Kiev junta and its neo-fascist system.\"\n\nMeanwhile, acting Ukrainian President Aleksandr Turchynov made a television\n\naddress, saying that an antiterrorist operation would be carried out against the\n\nactivists who seized administrative institutions in Lugansk, Donetsk and Kharkov.\n\nThe Verkhovnaya Rada has registered a draft law on the introduction of a state of\n\nemergency in three regions.\n\nLeonid Slutskiy (LDPR), head of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs,\n\ncommented on the situation:\n\naccording to him, residents of the Donetsk region \"have the right to express their\n\nopinion, but should reflect on the fact that Kiev's rejection of the unification of\n\nRussian communities may escalate into practical aggression\".\n\nAnnex 64\n\nAnnex 65\n\nTASS, Federalization Supporters in Luhansk Proclaim People's Republic (28 April 2014)\n\nThe Wayback Machine - https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052828/http://tass.ru/en/world/729768\n\nFederalization supporters in Luhansk\n\nproclaim people's republic\n\nWorld April 28, 2014, 2:17\n\nThey demand amnesty for all participants in the protest movement in Ukraine's east, recognition\n\nof Russian as a state language, and to hold a referendum on matters concerning selfdetermination\n\nof the region\n\nUTC+3\n\n© EPA/ZURAB KURTSIKIDZE\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 +\n\nAnnex 65\n\nRUSSIAN NIEWS AGENCY\n\n© 2016 TASS\n\nBeta-version.

The\n\ncampaign has uprooted thousands of Ukrainian citizens, while attracting fresh\n\ncriticism to a government that otherwise enjoys widespread sympathy in the west.\n\nPetro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s new president, on Tuesday ordered the establishment\n\nof an “escape corridor” for civilians seeking to leave eastern parts of the country\n\nwhere Kiev launched its counter-insurgency campaign in April.\n\nThere were no immediate details as to how this would work – nor any evidence\n\nthat it was being put in place as government troops and rebels again traded fire,\n\neven as Ukrainian and Russian officials continued talks to de-escalate the conflict.\n\nInside Slavyansk, most residents were without power, running water or gas. Some\n\nwere living in their basements, said people who have been inside the city.\n\nInformation on their plight has become harder to glean, as few journalists are\n\nworking in the city and mobile phone coverage has gone silent, cutting off\n\nresidents from relatives who have fled elsewhere.\n\nMany of those displaced from Slavyansk went to Svyatogorsk, a resort town famous\n\nfor its blue-and-gold-domed hillside Orthodox monastery, whose hallways and\n\nrooms have been packed with hundreds of cots. Camps, such as the Pearl of the\n\nDonbass, have filled up with displaced people.\n\nThe facility was housing 580 children and 80 adults, about 10 of whom were trying\n\nto contact relatives via land lines from its administrative office on Tuesday\n\nafternoon. Svyatogorsk was also without mobile communications.\n\nThose arriving from Slavyansk have brought stories of deaths and injuries from\n\nheavy bombardment, which they said came from both sides of the conflict.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, the advocacy group, on Monday urged Kiev to review its\n\ncounterinsurgency operation in eastern Ukraine, saying both the government and\n\nthe rebels “have obligations under international law to avoid harm to local\n\nresidents”.\n\nIrina Andrusenko fled Slavyansk with her husband and two children on May 30\n\nafter enduring shelling that began at 4am most days. Separatist snipers and an\n\nartillery commander positioned themselves on her building’s roof, she said, until\n\nAnnex 73\n\n9/26/22, 8:59 PM Kiev anti-terror operation takes toll on Slavyansk residents | Financial Times\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d8aa9386-f0b9-11e3-9e26-00144feabdc0 3/4\n\nresidents chased them away.\n\n“Bombs? We don’t know who was bombing us,” Ms Andrusenko said on Tuesday at\n\na home for children with tuberculosis in Svyatogorsk, where she had taken refuge\n\nwith her family. A neighbour, she said, was injured in the head from shrapnel and\n\ndied last month.\n\n“The only people who are left are corpses and pensioners,” said Andrey Vorobyev,\n\nher husband. “Everyone who could leave, left.”\n\nSvyatogorsk’s population has swollen from under 5,000 before the conflict to more\n\nthan 25,000, according to Donetsk provincial officials. Despite an evident\n\nhumanitarian crisis, most of the relief efforts in Slavyansk and Svyatogorsk are\n\nbeing bankrolled by private individuals or companies.\n\nThe Red Cross said it had been unable to visit Slavyansk because neither Kiev\n\nauthorities, nor the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic that claims\n\nsovereignty over the city, will provide security guarantees or reliable information.\n\nMs Polishuk, who went to Svyatogorsk’s city hall to inquire about help, found its\n\ndoors locked on Tuesday afternoon. Two signs were hung there appealing to local\n\nresidents to donate food for the “refugees”, and telling them where they might go if\n\nthey needed medical help.\n\nIn the absence of a concerted relief effort – either from Kiev or the international\n\ncommunity – the displaced were left to contemplate a difficult future, and\n\nwondering who to blame for the destruction of their city.\n\n“Our army is shooting civilians,” Angela Chumak, another Slavyansk resident\n\nstaying at the children’s tuberculosis facility said on Tuesday.\n\nAnnex 73\n\nlllJSSIA\n\nKiev\n\nG Slavyansk\n\nSvyatogorsk- :J\n\nUKRAINE\n\n000 km\n\nÉilacl\n\nSea\n\n9/26/22, 8:59 PM Kiev anti-terror operation takes toll on Slavyansk residents | Financial Times\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d8aa9386-f0b9-11e3-9e26-00144feabdc0 4/4\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2022.

But the remaining sailors insist morale has not been battered.\n\n'You should have seen their eyes!' said Mr Livshyts , gleeful at the memory of the\n\nUkrainian sailors who refused to join the Russian navy. 'You can create any kind\n\nof weapon, but this spirit you can't create it. It's just there.'\n\nFor weeks after the takeover, Ukrainian sailors played cat-and-mouse games\n\nwith Russian ships, trying to keep their vessels from being taken by Moscow for\n\nas long as possible. The stand-offs were mostly non-violent, with Kiev clearly\n\nfearing that dead Russian sailors could be used as an excuse for even more\n\naggression.\n\nOriginally outfitted with cast-off Soviet equipment and overshadowed by\n\nMoscow's forces, the Ukrainian military has never had it easy. Successive Kiev\n\ngovernments kept its funding to the minimum, and officials say former President\n\nViktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian leader who fled power earlier this year after\n\nmonths of protests, purposefully starved his own armed forces so they would\n\npose even less of a challenge to Moscow.\n\nUkraine spent just $5billion on defence last year, less than 10 per cent of what\n\nRussia says it budgeted for its military.\n\nThe results have been predictable, with Ukrainian soldiers now lacking\n\neverything from training to body armour.

'They've got only one ship good\n\nfor action.'\n\nThat ship, the 400ft Hetman Sagaydachniy, evaded capture because it was on its\n\nway back from an anti-piracy deployment off the Horn of Africa when Crimea\n\nwas seized.

This was the middle of a city, a building\n\nadjacent to a leafy square, where civilians walked and worked. Eight people were killed,\n\nfive women and three men, according to the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic;\n\nthe authorities in Kiev reported the same tally.\n\nBut there the agreement ends.\n\nThe pro-Russian leadership in the city immediately accused the Ukrainian air force of\n\ncarrying out the attack. A fighter jet had been flying overhead at the time, and social\n\nmedia video appeared to show it firing cannon or rockets. The authorities in Kiev\n\ndenied its planes had been involved. Initially, the anti-terrorist operation said the\n\nexplosion originated from inside the building, then that an anti-aircraft missile operated\n\nby the separatists had misfired, reacting to heat from an air-conditioning system on the\n\noutside of the building.\n\nBut a CNN investigation in Luhansk has found clear evidence that whatever detonations\n\nhit the building and the adjoining park came from the air. The tops of trees were\n\nsplintered, and a series of small craters – about a dozen – had been blasted in a straight\n\nline, starting in the park and reaching the walls of the building, blowing out many of its\n\nwindows and spraying the area with jagged shrapnel. That’s what appears to have\n\nkilled most of the victims and injured 20 more.\n\nThe pattern of the craters clearly indicated some sort of strafing, according to a\n\nmunitions expert at the scene with CNN.

I think after they see what happened\n\nto us in the center of our town, they’ll send them more quickly,” he said.\n\nNikitin said he was ready to provide all the evidence collected to independent experts.\n\nNick de Larrinaga, Europe editor of IHS Jane’s Defence Weekly, told CNN he believed\n\nthe Ukrainian air force “used their Su-25 ‘Frogfoot’ ground attack aircraft during the\n\noperation in Luhansk. It is specifically designed for attacking ground targets – unlike the\n\nSu-27, which is principally a fighter aircraft.”\n\nThe planes were flying to provide support for a base of the Ukrainian Border Guard on\n\nthe edge of the city. Why one may have targeted the administrative building, several\n\nmiles away, is unknown.\n\nThe Border Guard compound, in a southern suburb of Luhansk, came under attack\n\nbefore dawn Monday. It was a concerted assault from several directions, involving\n\nhundreds of pro-Russian militants, and continued for some 12 hours. On a visit to the\n\nsite Tuesday, a CNN team found dozens of spent cartridges in several locations around\n\nthe base, whose buildings had also been hit by rocket-propelled grenades. Part of the\n\nroof of the main building hung precariously in the strong wind. Vehicles outside had\n\nbeen burned out, the fuel dump blown up.\n\nBy late afternoon, only a token force of separatists were still in place, using blocks of\n\napartments within 100 meters of the base as protection. They cradled brand new\n\nassault rifles and carried boxes of ammunition but insisted they were local men.\n\nPatches of dried blood marked the place where one of several militants killed or\n\nwounded Monday had been hit by gunfire from the base.\n\nOne of the separatists, who gave his name as Oleg, said, “They call this an anti-terror\n\nVIDEO\n\nAnnex 76 -\n\noperation, but it’s wrong. When they use air force against their own people, it’s wrong.”\n\nHe dismissed Ukraine’s President-elect, Petro Poroshenko, as “illegitimate.”\n\nOleg and other fighters said the base had been attacked because it was the hub for\n\nUkrainian patrols along a several-hundred-kilometer stretch of the nearby border with\n\nRussia – an area that has seen increased infiltration by Russian militants and weapons\n\nin recent weeks.\n\nSeveral soldiers inside the compound were also injured in the clashes, and windows in\n\nthe adjoining apartment blocks were pock-marked with bullet holes.\n\nAs CNN filmed, two men raced into the base through its charred gate-house.\n\nThe battle for eastern Ukraine is intensifying.

The military\n\nhit rebel positions in Horlivka, a crucial town to the north, and in Karlovka, a town with a strategic bridge.\n\nBut while the Ukrainian forces might have scored tactical victories, they were not winning any friends in Marinka,\n\nwhere the assumption was they were to blame. The attack there left five civilians dead and four wounded, according\n\nto the regional government, a grim sign of the imprecision and blunt force of the weapons being used by both sides\n\nin this war, which began in the spring when pro-Russian rebels seized Ukraine’s southeastern edge and declared\n\nindependence.\n\n“Pigs,” said a man with gray hair who was wiping away tears. “People were sleeping in their beds.”\n\nThe source of the rocket attack was in dispute. A Ukrainian military officer, who asked that his name not be used\n\nbecause he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said the Ukrainians did not have artillery positions close\n\nenough to hit Marinka.\n\n“Our artillery just wouldn’t have reached there,” the officer said. “It’s as simple as that.”\n\nA military spokesman, Vladislav Seleznyov, said that Ukraine did not use its airpower or heavy artillery against\n\nrebel targets that were close to civilians.\n\nBut the proximity of civilians did not stop the Ukrainians from shelling in and around Slovyansk, the former rebel\n\nstronghold they took back this month. And rebels in Marinka showed a reporter exploded rocket casings and a\n\ngaping hole in the animal feed factory where they were based, as evidence that the rockets had come from the\n\nUkrainian military. Two rebels had been injured, they said.\n\nAcross the street from the factory was the apartment building that took the worst hit, No. 6 Zavodskaya Street, a\n\ngray brick building rimmed with pretty gardens of brown-eyed susans and marigolds. A hole opened into a living\n\nroom, which had collapsed in on itself. A door ripped from its hinges lay atop a large pile of curtains, cabinets and\n\nbricks.\n\nIgor Nersisyan, a retiree who lives on the second floor, said he had helped a neighbor dig her husband out from\n\nunder that rubble early Saturday morning. The man, whom Mr. Nersisyan identified as Victor Belotserkovny, was\n\ndead when they reached him, the top of his skull sheared off in the blast.\n\n“They are trying to destroy peaceful people,” said Mr. Nersisyan, who blamed the Ukrainian military, as residents\n\nwith bags of belongings walked away from the building.\n\nOlga Gavrilovna, a first-floor resident, was putting thawing frozen chicken into a thin blue plastic bag in her tiny\n\nkitchen; the floor was covered with the contents of its cupboards and the windows were blown out. She crunched\n\nover the glass, throwing leftover soup into the toilet, barely stopping to survey the damage.\n\n“I just can’t think right now,” she said, with a blank look. “What is there to say?”\n\nThere were unconfirmed reports on Saturday that Ukrainian warplanes struck targets near Dzerzhinsk, a town\n\nnorth of here, killing hundreds of rebels. Both sides have made unsubstantiated claims about casualties in the past.\n\nCivilians Pay a Price for Gains of Ukraine Forces\n\nAnnex 78\n\nl!tbt NtUr i!fork l!timca 1\n\nAlso on Saturday, another rocket attack killed at least four people on the southern edge of Donetsk. Local residents\n\nsaid the attack took place around 4 p.m. By evening, businesses and homes were still in flames, and bodies lay\n\noutside a building that had been hit. One of the bodies appeared to be that of a girl in her early teens.\n\nIt is possible that the rebels were receiving reinforcements. The state news agency of Ukraine, Ukrinform, reported\n\nSaturday that militants had crossed from Russia into Ukraine in the Krasnodon district, near the village of Veliki\n\nSukhodil in a large convoy of armored vehicles, including tanks. That claim has not been verified.\n\nIn Donetsk, leaders of the rebel movement gave their version of the events in Marinka. Igor Strelkov, the Russian\n\ncitizen who is the military commander of the rebel forces here, said the Ukrainian armed forces had struck a milk\n\nfactory as well as the animal feed factory; he claimed that more than 30 people had been killed, despite the lower\n\nfigure provided by a local official.\n\n“This is a relatively standard picture for the Ukrainian military,” said Alexander Borodai, another Russian citizen,\n\nwho along with Mr. Strelkov leads the insurgency here.\n\nDespite all of that, the rebels seemed to be in a light mood.\n\nA wedding of a rebel commander, known by the name Motorola, took place on Friday in a large ceremony at a\n\ncentral hall filled with fighters holding their guns. Rebel forces also announced a singles night in Lenin Square for\n\nlocal women to meet fighters.\n\n“We await everyone who is looking for a dependable, courageous, real man,” Pavel Gubarev, a rebel commander,\n\nsaid in a Facebook posting. “And yes, there will be dancing.”\n\nMr. Borodai, who usually wears fatigues, was dressed in civilian clothes — a sharp blue blazer, jeans and blue suede\n\nloafers. When asked for his response to the European Union’s recent decision to impose sanctions against him, Mr.\n\nBorodai seemed to take pleasure in the answer.\n\n“It’s unfortunate, of course, that in the near future I can’t visit Europe or walk around European towns,” he said,\n\nnoting that he especially liked Austria, Germany and the south of France. “But it doesn’t scare me. I’m even happy,\n\nbecause I have excellent company,” he added, turning to Mr. Strelkov and smiling.\n\nAnnex 78\n\nAnnex 79\n\nRadio Liberty, Several Dead in Latest Violence in Luhansk "
