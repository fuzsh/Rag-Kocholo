        "text": "You can make a payment in Ukraine in several ways - cash, card, contactless payment systems, etc. Find out how tourists can make payments in Ukraine and whether there are restrictions under martial law\n\nOne of the main issues that worries tourists when planning a trip is money. How to make calculations? Where to exchange currency? What is important to know about the financial features of the chosen country? There are a lot of questions, especially travelers who are planning a trip to Ukraine during the war.\n\nWhat is important for a foreigner to know about settlements in Ukraine in 2024? We tell.\n\nCurrency unit and exchange rate in Ukraine\n\nThe monetary unit in Ukraine is known as hryvnia (UAH), and coins are kopecks.\n\nAs of July 19, 2024, according to the official exchange rate of the National Bank of Ukraine: 100 USD equals 4,146 hryvnias, and 100 euros equals 4,534 hryvnias.\n\nThe current official exchange rate can be found on the NBU website.\n\nWhere can you exchange money in Ukraine?\n\nThere are several options for exchanging foreign currency in Ukraine: exchange offices, hotels, banks and kiosks in the border zone. Ukrainian hryvnia can be difficult to purchase outside of Ukraine, so tourists often buy local currency immediately upon arrival.\n\nCurrency exchange services in the border zone or hotel often have the highest fees, so take this into account when choosing a place to exchange currency. Usually, the most fair exchange rate can be found:\n\n- At currency exchange points within cities (most often in the central part).\n\n- In ATMs of a local bank in Ukraine.\n\n- In local banks.\n\n- In your bank in the country of origin, provided that hryvnias can be purchased in the country.\n\nUse an online currency converter to check that you won't lose money when exchanging currency before agreeing to the proposed exchange rate.\n\nImportantly! If you plan to exchange foreign currency in Ukraine, make sure that your bills are in perfect condition. Damaged or worn banknotes are not accepted.\n\n- Withdrawal of cash from an ATM\n\nBy far the best way to get cash is to withdraw it from an ATM, especially considering that there is no ban on the use of foreign cards in Ukraine. However, it is worth noting that some card-issuing banks may restrict the use of local ATMs. So be sure to keep some cash on hand (preferably dollars or euros) as a backup.\n\nVisit Ukraine on social media: Telegram | YouTube | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok\n\nUse of debit and credit cards for payment in Ukraine\n\nCredit and debit cards are widely accepted in Ukrainian hotels, restaurants, shops and public transport. ATMs can also be easily found throughout the country.\n\n- The largest banks in Ukraine: Privatbank, Oschadbank, Raiffeisen Bank Ukrsibbank and FUIB.\n\n- International banks in Ukraine: Credit Agricole, Ukrsibbank and Citibank.\n\nImportantly! When using a credit or debit card while traveling, you may be prompted to convert the charges to your home currency. However, most often this option allows the local bank to set the exchange rate in its favor. That is why, in order to avoid paying hidden fees in the form of an unfavorable exchange rate, choose the local currency when making a calculation.\n\nTerms of use of foreign cards in Ukraine in this article.\n\nIn Ukraine, cash payments are steadily decreasing and account for less than half of transactions. Currently, in the state, most payments are made through the Apple Pay and Google Pay systems, they are available in the state and work without failures even in war conditions.\n\nUkraine is steadily included in the list of world leaders in terms of the number of NFC payments with mobile digital wallets and gadgets with Mastercard cards.\n\nIn 2019, the state entered the top ten in the ranking of European countries in terms of the number of NFC payments with wearable devices - watches, bracelets, etc.\n\nContactless payments are available wherever there is a contactless terminal. Such terminals are marked with a special non-contact symbol. Today, more than 90% of trading terminals in Ukraine are contactless.\n\nYou can pay contactless: in restaurants, gas stations, supermarkets, in transport, in shops, in entertainment centers, etc.\n\nContactless payment with a smartphone or other gadget is one of the safest types of payments. During contactless payment, your card details are not transmitted. The payment card number is replaced by a unique digital code - a token. The process of replacing the payment card number with a token is called tokenization. A token is created for each individual payment. It cannot be reused for fraudulent purposes, so your confidential information is securely protected.\n\nPeculiarities of cash and non-cash payments in Ukraine in wartime conditions\n\nSince February 24, 2022, the financial system of Ukraine has been operating under martial law, which also affected the settlement system:\n\n- Non-cash payments - the NBU did not impose any bans on non-cash payments, card payments are accepted, payment terminals, mobile applications and online banking systems work.\n\n- Cash withdrawals from accounts - the daily limit for cash withdrawals in Ukraine is UAH 100,000 (the equivalent of approximately $2,400).\n\n- Alternative methods of withdrawing cash hryvnia â€“ in addition to withdrawing cash from ATMs, cash can be obtained at the cash desks of a number of shops, pharmacies and gas stations. Just ask the cashier about this possibility when traveling in Ukraine.\n\nIn general, it is very simple and easy to make calculations in Ukraine, because banks, international payment systems and the financial sector in general continue to work without changes.\n\nWhat to see in Ukraine?\n\nUkraine has a rich history, hospitable local population, diverse culture and bright nature. For many years, tourists from different parts of the world have been attracted to this pearl of Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2024, travelers will continue to come to Ukraine. However, nowadays such a trip combines getting to know the state's culture and memory tourism. Traveling through modern Ukraine, you should not only get to know its historical gems, but also take tours of the cities destroyed by the Russian invasion. This is an unusual vacation, but also a good way for travelers to see the consequences of the war and understand how Ukrainians live in the conflict.\n\nTherefore, if you are planning a trip to Ukraine, we advise you to pay attention to one of the following tours:\n\n- Individual tour: through the whole of Ukraine - you can see the main sights of Ukraine during this trip. This is a tour for those who want to discover the state as fully as possible, because it includes visiting a huge number of sights and excursions in Lviv region, Kyiv region and Mykolaiv region. Comfort is also an absolute advantage of such a trip, because it includes transfers to/from Krakow airport and between Ukrainian cities, accommodation in hotels, breakfasts, excursions, remote support of the guide throughout the trip and manager's consultation.\n\n- The de-occupied cities of Kyiv region + Chernihiv are heroic territories that were among the first to be invaded by the Russian occupier in February 2022. Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel - the names are already familiar to many indifferent inhabitants of the world. Two years ago, terrible things happened here - battles, shootings, torture. Currently, these towns are gradually returning to the usual rhythm of life, but they preserve the memory of all those who fell victim to an insidious attack and a terrible war.\n\n- A tour of ancient Kyiv - the strong and bold capital of Ukraine - Kyiv is the main gem for most travelers. Fascinating ancient churches, ancient buildings and modern towers, mystical places, beautiful parks and hospitable restaurants - you will not be able to stop admiring the beauty of the Ukrainian capital. The streets of Kyiv have almost 2,000 monuments of nature, history and culture, so you should see at least some of them during your vacation.\n\nImportantly!
