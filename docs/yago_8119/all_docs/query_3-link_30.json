        "text": "… we discussed before in great detail, as she was influential in getting rid of Josephine and bringing in Marie Louise as Napoleon’s new wife.\n\nCaroline moved with her parents to France during the French Revolution. There she fell in love with her brother Napoleon’s VERY fashionable general, Marshal Joachim Murat.\n\nNapoleon thought she was too young to marry, but Napoleon’s wife Josephine convinced him to let them wed. Caroline and Joachim were married in 1800 when she was 17 years old.\n\n(Below the considered quite handsome Joachim; Feature: newlywed Caroline and Joachim Murat, 1800)"
