        "text": "Caroline Bonaparte 1782-1839\n\nCaroline was born in Ajaccio on the beautiful island of Corsica.\n\nHere is more on Corsica.\n\nCaroline's original Italian name was Maria Nunziata Carolina Buonaparte. In French pubs people called her Marie Annociade Caroline Bonaparte, or simply Baby Sister of the Boss.\n\nCaroline's brother, Napoleon I, married her to Joachim Murat, a solider.\n\nAnd just like her brother, Caroline was equally determined to get what she wanted.\n\nCaroline had an affair with Klemens von Metternich.\n\nQueen Caroline\n\nNapoleon decided it was a good idea to put all available relatives on thrones around him.\n\nIn 1808, he chose sister Caroline to become Queen of Naples. Caroline was delighted and accepted gladly. Her reign did not last long. Already in 1815 she had to pack her bags again because the Austrians ran over her kingdom. That, and because her husband got executed.\n\nCaroline Bonaparte fled to Trieste where, especially in local pubs, she was henceforth known as Comtesse de Lipona.\n\nPUB IN TRIESTE\n\nMore History"
