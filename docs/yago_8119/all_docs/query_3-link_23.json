        "text": "Unlike most of her siblings, Caroline Bonaparte actually got along pretty well with Josephine--at first. Close in age to Josephine’s daughter, her former schoolmate Hortense, Caroline found an ally in Josephine when it came to trying to coax her brother Napoleon into letting her marry Murat. Josephine helped persuade a reluctant Napoleon to let the two marry, and then helped care for Caroline during her first pregnancy after Napoleon had sent Murat back to command the army in Italy. She sent Murat, whom she called her “dear little brother,” letters of assurance that Caroline was well.\n\nBut then at some point, this relationship went awry.\n\nI’m still not exactly sure of the why and when. I haven’t found any exact incident that serves as turning point. So I can only chalk this relationship up as another victim of the often downright infantile Bonaparte/Beauharnais family feud. Anyway, by the time of the following letter, Caroline and Joachim were not getting on too well with Josephine anymore; undoubtedly the competition for favors from Napoleon didn’t help the situation. Josephine seems to have tried to get Louis Bonaparte--now married to her daughter and practically an invalid by this point--command of Napoleon’s cavalry for the upcoming campaign. Napoleon gave it to Murat instead. Here’s an excerpt from Caroline to Murat on the subject, on 6 September 1805:\n\nToday the Empress received me well enough, she spoke to me of Prince Louis, and said to me, 'that it was very simple that the Emperor did not take him with him, because he needs people who are active.' I told her of my plan to thank the Emperor for your appointment; she responded to me that no one could dispute the attachment that you have for the Emperor and that he well knows how much he can count on you. All this a little coldly. (...) I've thanked the Emperor for your nomination, because it is public. There are some people who are very glad and others who are less content. The Empress came yesterday evening to Princess Borghese's and asked Mme d'Arjuson of news of Prince Louis. She responded that he was very well but that he has much, much sorrow to see that one had taken his place as the commander of the cavalry. I know that the Empress said it was quite extraordinary that you had taken Louis' place, that he has so much sadness, and that she was no longer astonished by our eagerness to go to Boulogne to cajole the Emperor; that by caressing him so strongly, we had gotten everything we wanted. She is very angry with us having been to Boulogne, she believes that it is this trip which decided all and many others believe it too. What pains her most is that the Emperor urges us with so much friendship to go see him often. She said that 'Murat and Madame Murat were well attached to the Emperor, but they were both very keen, and that Murat, with his wheedling, was getting everything that he wanted from the Emperor.' You see by that, that they are jealous of all that the Emperor is disposed to do for us. Be very careful with what you will do, because the Empress, Louis, and all the family of the Empress will never forgive you having the most beautiful position that exists. Retiring from her place, I told her 'You will permit me to come dine tomorrow.' She replied to me with a little mocking smile, 'But are you not the mistress of doing what you want?' From the last conversation I had with the Emperor at Boulogne, where he recommended me to be good to her, I show her the greatest regard, I do what I can to content her, and all without trust. I never speak to her of politics, I avoid all that can offend her. It's this which angers her the most, because she sees that it is impossible for her to recall anything from me to the Emperor that can dissatisfy him with me. I am very glad that you know all this, because she is going to go to Strasbourg. When you see her, show her a lot of friendship, and make as if you are unaware of all this. I know what I have just told you via Paulette [Pauline Bonaparte] and Mme d'Arjuson, because the Empress conceals her way of thinking. I'll tell you everything I know, as long as I have one of your aides-de-camp here, because I would not confide these things to a courier. The Empress does all she can to know our way of thinking, and if she had any of our letters, she would not fail to further harm us by showing them to the Emperor. In all that you say to the Emperor, appear unaware of all of this.\n\nCaroline sends another letter to her husband on 20 September where she assures him that\n\nPrince Louis has been very well, and he has had no idea of jealousy as it was supposed, I counsel you to write to him.\n\nBut then follows that up with a few paragraphs later with\n\nTake care not to leave at your place any letters that you would not want seen, because you will be watched. You know that the Emperor likes to know what is happening at each place, even the smallest details.\n\nSource: Lettres et documents pour servir à l’histoire de Joachim Murat, Vol 4."
