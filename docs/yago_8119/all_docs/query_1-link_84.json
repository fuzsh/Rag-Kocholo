        "text": "Hey, does anyone remember that bright young Bonaparte kid? Showed up out of nowhere, shot across Europe like a shooting star, had a great career ahead of him, and then BAM! Vanished. Anybody know what he’s up to these days?\n\nWell, he died of stomach cancer on a small South Atlantic island in 1821, and good riddance too, but his family is still around. Honestly, it’s pretty amazing. Napoleon was a dominant presence in European politics for less than two decades, and during that time virtually every member of his family managed to marry someone important. And while the family lost it’s political importance after 1871, its members remain embedded throughout the world. They’re like kudzu. Turn over any leaf or rock in the world and you’re likely to find a member of the House of Bonaparte or one of it’s associated families. There have been Bonaparte politicians and generals and Kings and scientists and artists and revolutionaries, in virtually every country in Europe and quite a few beyond. In this article, I’d like to begin the truly mammoth task of tracing these lines. Going through Napoleon himself and each of his siblings and children, I’ll trace the lines of descent to the present day (to the best of my ability) and note people of interest. Please note this is a non-exhaustive list, as many people are not important enough for any information to be available about them. So think of this as a highlights tour.\n\nLet’s begin.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821):\n\nThe man himself! Napoleon needs no introduction I hope, but I’ll do my best to provide a sketch. Born to a minor Corsican noble family in 1769, Napoleon Bonaparte rose to prominence as a military commander in the armies of the First French Republic. Eventually, he was able to parlay this into the position of First Consul (essentially dictator). From there, he waged a brilliant series of military campaigns, subjugating nearly all of Europe and proclaiming himself Emperor. His invasion of Russia in 1812, however, was a disaster, and sparked a renewed alliance among his enemies, who were able to bring him down in 1813 at the Battle of Leipzig.\n\nNapoleon only had one legitimate child, Napoléon François Charles Joseph Bonaparte (1811-1832), who was usually known as Napoleon II, Franz, or the King of Rome. Posthumously he has also been called L’Aiglon (“the Eaglet”). Son of Napoleon and his second wife, the Hapsburg Archduchess Maria Anna, it was hoped that Napoleon II would symbolize the new European unity under Bonaparte rule. But when he was only three years old, his father was cast down. On April 4th, 1914, Napoleon attempted to proclaim his son his successor, but less than a month later the boy’s brief reign ended when the Allies forced Napoleon to abdicate unconditionally. Amidst the chaos and the ruin, Maria Anna took her son and returned with him to Austria. Napoleon II would never see his father again. In Vienna, he would be raised as a typical minor Hapsburg scion, given education and military training and used as a political pawn. He longed for a military career, but this was denied to him for obvious reasons. He was noted for his close friendship with the Bavarian princess Sophie, and it was long been rumored that he is the true father of her son the Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, though there is no evidence of that. In 1832, he died of pneumonia, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn 1940, for reasons best known to himself, Adolf Hitler had his remains moved from the Hapsburg Crypt in Vienna to Les Invalides in Paris. I really don’t know why he cared.\n\nNapoleon had at least two illegitimate children, though there are rumors of others. The first, and the only acknowledged one, was the Count Charles Léon (1806–1881), daughter of Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne. I don’t know anything about Léon’s life, except that he had three sons and a daughter. Two of the sons and the daughter’s only son died in the First World War. If he has other descendants, that appears to be lost to history. The other son, Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810-1868), had a much more colorful life.\n\nHe was born in Warsaw to the Polish noblewoman Marie Walewska, whose affair with the Emperor of the French was strong supported by the Polish aristocracy in the hopes that it would encourage Napoleonic support for Polish independence. Alexandre seems to have imbibed this Polish patriotism early. He fled Poland at fourteen rather than serve in the Russian Army, and in 1830 he was dispatched by the leaders of the November Revolt to try and gain support for the Polish Uprising in the United Kingdom. He failed, and the revolution was crushed. He then joined the French Foreign Legion, and fought in Algeria, before becoming a successful playwright. After the ascension of Louis-Napoleon to the throne as Emperor Napoleon III, Colonna-Walewski resumed his diplomatic career, serving as ambassador in Naples, Florence, and London. In 1855, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs for France, following that up with a stint as Minister of State, and a term in the Corps Législatif. He died in 1868. He left many descendants, none of which I can find anything about. However, I have read that at least some of them are Jewish, which is interesting. Jewish Bonapartes. Who would have guessed?\n\nJoseph Bonaparte (1768-1844):\n\nNapoleon’s eldest brother, Joseph was a strong supporter of his brother’s rise to power, if a less able supporter of the Empire. As a member of the Council of Ancients, he aided in the Coup of 18 Brumaire. He later served as King of Naples and King of Spain. In both capacities he was a consummate reformer and liberalizer, acting in the traditions of Enlightened Despotism, but his policies in Spain were mostly undone by the endless guerilla warfare of the Peninsular Campaigns. Also everyone hated him. Also he was a terrible general. After the Fall of Napoleon, Joseph relocated to the United States, where he became a gentleman farmer in New Jersey.\n\nJoseph had two legitimate children, both daughters. Zénaïde Bonaparte (1801-1854) and Charlotte Bonaparte (1802-1839). Under the Napolonic family code, titles could only pass down through the male lines of descent, so to maximize his family’s dynastic ambitions Joseph married both of them into other branches of the Bonaparte family. Zénaïde was wed to her cousin Charles Lucien Bonaparte, and Charlotte married her cousin Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nJoseph had three other daughters and a son, all illegitimate, and two of them American. All I know about any of them is that Catherine Charlotte married a Col. Zebulon Howell Benton of New York and had issue, who lived into the 20th century. However, I don’t know if they did anything of interest or if their descendants are alive today.\n\nLouis Bonaparte (1778-1846):\n\nLouis Bonaparte is rather a tragic figure. One of Napoleon’s younger brothers, he suffered from syphilis, mental illness, and was (allegedly) homosexual. All of this strained his marriage with Hortense de Beauharnais, Napoleon’s step-daughter. To be frank, they hated each other. He first rose to prominence in 1806 when he was appointed King of Holland by his brother. He took to this position with alacrity, taking the Dutch name Lodewijk I and paying personal attention to native affairs, lavishing attention on flood relief, advocating for Dutch economic positions against French interest, and refusing to send Dutch troops to fight and die in Napoleon’s campaigns. Because of this he became known as “Louis the Good” in the Netherlands, but was deposed by Napoleon in 1810, after which he went into exile in the Austrian Empire. He visited Holland once again in 1840, where he was visited by cheering crowds. (awwww).\n\nLouis had two children who survived into adulthood. The elder was Napoléon-Louis Bonaparte (1804-1831). In 1801, he was named Grand Duke of Berg, a nominal title he maintained until the extinction of the Grand Duchy during the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1813. In 1810, when Napoleon invaded Holland to depose his troublesome sibling, Louis briefly abdicated and attempted to name his son King; thus Napoléon-Louis reigned as Lodewijk II of Holland for nine days before the family was forced to flee. In the 1820s, he married his cousin Charlotte (see above), and the couple moved to Italy, where they joined the Carbonari, a revolutionary secret society dedicated to opposing the Austrian domination of northern Italy and establishing liberal and constitutional government in the Italian peninsula. (Please take a moment to appreciate Napoleon Bonaparte’s nephew becoming a Liberal revolutionary). In 1831 they were forced to flee due to an Austrian crackdown, and Louis died of measles. Charlotte died in 1839, reportedly in childbirth. I do not know who the father was. Neither of them seem to have produced any surviving issue.\n\nLouis’s second son was named Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (1808-1873). Yes, the names are unbearably confusing. Don’t blame me. Like his older brother, Louis was a romantic and was was involved in various revolutionary schemes. In 1836 and 1840, he attempted to stage coup d’etats against the French government. In both cases, the soldiers of the army failed to rally to his banner as he had anticipated, and after the second incident he was arrested and imprisoned. During this time he dabbled in pre-Marxian socialism, writing about how to eliminate French poverty. He returned to France in 1848, winning election to the National Assembly alongside a number of other Bonapartes. In that year’s election he won the first national presidential election in French history by 74%, stunning most political observers. In 1851, he surprised absolutely no one by staging a coup and declaring himself Emperor Napoleon III of the Second French Empire.\n\nNapoleon III had a mixed record as Emperor. Domestically, he supported Baron Haussmann’s renovations of Paris that produced the modern city and oversaw incredible economic progress and modernization. Politically, he tended to sway between generally liberal policies and autocratic crackdowns. He is mostly remembered for his foreign policy however. He broke the old Waterloo Coalition by allying with the British in the Crimean War. He intervened decisively in Italy against the Austrians, laying the groundwork for the unification of the peninsula. He supported the construction of the Suez Canal, and massively expanded the French colonial empire, seizing territory in Algeria, Senegal, Indochina, and New Caledonia. But he overreached catastrophically in 1862, attempting to place the Hapsburg Archduke Maximilian on the throne of a new Mexican Empire. This turned into a quagmire, and in 1865 the U.S.A forced Napoleon III to withdraw his troops, leading to the fall of the Empire and Maximilian’s execution. Worse still, in 1870 he allowed Bismarck to provoke him into declaring war on the Kingdom of Prussia. In the ensuing Franco-Prussian War, France suffered a series of humiliating defeats, culminating in the Battle of Sedan, where Napoleon III was captured. Revolution in Paris produced a New Republic, and Prussia won the war and became the German Empire. Napoleon died in exile in Britain in 1873.\n\nHe had only one child, the Prince Imperial Louis-Napoléon (1856-1879), known to Bonapartists as Emperor Napoleon IV. Only fifteen years old when the Second Empire fell, Louis grew up in Britain, where he attended the Royal Military Academy. There was some talk of him marrying Princess Beatrice, one of Queen Victoria’s daughters but this came to naught as Bonapartist political influence in France waned. In 1879, the Royal Army reluctantly, and only under orders from the Queen, acceded to his request to travel to South Africa and fight in the Anglo-Zulu Wars. The young prince was attached as an observer to a noncombat engineer unit, and his superiors were ordered to keep him alive at all costs. He immediately led a reconnaissance party straight into a Zulu ambush, where he was stabbed eighteen times with assegais and died.\n\nThe death was a huge story in Europe, where many alleged he’d been assassinated by either French Republicans or on orders from Queen Victoria. His superior officer, Lieutenant Carey, was court-martialed and later committed suicide. The Zulus put out a statement apologizing for the incident. I still maintain that the entire affair is too ridiculous for words. Thus died the last Imperial Prince of France. Go figure.\n\nCaroline Bonaparte (1782-1839) and Joachim Murat (1767-1815):\n\nCaroline Bonaparte was one of Napoleon’s three sisters. She is most remembered for her hatred of Bonaparte’s first wife, Josephine, and her intriguing against her family. She was firmly loyal to her husband, the young general Joachim Murat. Murat was dashing, charismatic, and brilliant. Considered one of the best cavalry generals of his generation, he was awarded for his successes with the title of King of Naples. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, Murat and Caroline defected from the Napoleonic camp, cutting a deal with the Allies that allowed them to maintain control of the Kingdom of Naples. However, during the Hundred Days Murat reneged on this, but was swiftly defeated by the Austrians. In 1815 he returned to Italy with a thousand followers and tried to retake his throne. He was quickly captured and executed. Caroline spent the remainder of her life living in exile in Florence under Austrian protection.\n\nThe couple had two sons and two daughters. I can find virtually no information on either of the girls, though I do know they had issue. The sons are another matter. The elder was Achille Murat (1801-1847), Crown Prince of Naples. When he was twenty-one years old, Achille immigrated to the United States, where he renounced his titles and became a naturalized citizen. He settled in Tallahassee, Florida, where he built a sizable plantation He became an active member of the community, serving as a Lieutenant Colonel in the militia and marrying Catherine Willis Gray, the great-grandniece of George Washington. Some sources say he served as Tallahassee mayor and alderman, but others dispute this. He was a close friend of Ralph Waldo Emmerson and a fierce apologist for slavery. In 1830 he returned to Europe to dabble in the new French Revolution, but soon gave up and returned home, where he died in 1847. He had no children.\n\nHis younger brother was Prince Lucien Murat (1803-1878). Like his sibling, Lucien moved to America, though his journey was more fraught—he was captured by the Spanish and required the assistance of President Monroe to secure his relief. In 1825 he settled in New Jersey, marrying a local woman. He made attempts in 1838 and 1844 to gain recognition of his right to the throne of Naples, unsuccessfully. After the Revolution of 1848, he returned to France and was elected to the assembly. In 1861, he made a final attempt to retake his Italian kingdom but was forced to back down by Emperor Napoleon III. Lucien was captured in the Franco-Prussian War, and left public life after the Fall of the Second Empire. He died in Paris in 1878.\n\nHe had five children, of which only two are of interest. Prince Louis Napoléon Murat (1851-1912), who married a Russian noblewomen and is the great-grandfather of the actor René Auberjonois, most famous for his roles in M*A*S*H (film), Boston Legal, The Little Mermaid, and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nHis elder brother was Joachim Joseph Napoléon Murat, Fourth Prince of Murat (1834-1901), who served in the French Army as a Major General during the Franco-Prussian War, and founded a miniature military dynasty. He had two daughters and a son, Joachim Napoléon Murat, Fifth Prince of Murat (1856-1932), who did nothing of any interest. He had eight children, but the only one who merits a Wikipedia page was Joachim Murat, Sixth Prince of Murat (1885-1938) (I’M SORRY). He joined the French army upon the outbreak of the First World War, and at the Battle of Verdun earned the Croix de Guerre with three citations for his command of the Fort des Sartelles. His son was Joachim Murat, Seventh Prince of Murat (1920-1944). During World War II, he joined the French Resistance, where he served in the Charles Martel Brigade alongside his cousin Prince Louis Napoleon, self-styled Emperor Napoleon VI. In 1944 he was killed in action, and was awarded the Légion d’honneur and the Croix de Guerre. His son is still alive, and is named Joachim Murat, Eight Prince of Murat. He is a well-known art collector, and is involved in the commemoration of Imperial memory. He has a son named (of course), Joachim Murat.\n\nJoin us next time for part two of this exciting series, where we tackle Napoleon’s stepson Eugène de Beauharnais and his infiltration of the royal families of Europe!"
