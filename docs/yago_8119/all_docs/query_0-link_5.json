        "text": "Caroline Bonaparte (born March 25, 1782, Ajaccio, Corsica—died May 18, 1839, Florence [Italy]) was the queen of Naples (1808–15), Napoleon’s youngest sister and the wife (1800) of Joachim Murat.\n\nAs a result of her ambitious and intriguing nature, her husband became governor of Paris, marshal of France (1804), grand duke of Berg and of Cleves (1806), lieutenant of the emperor in Spain (1803), and king of Naples (1808). Her relations with Napoleon became strained as she associated herself with the shifting allegiances of her husband in 1814–15, which led ultimately to Murat’s fall and execution in 1815. Thereafter, Caroline took refuge in Trieste, taking the title comtesse de Lipona."
