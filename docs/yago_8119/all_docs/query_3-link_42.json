        "text": "Caroline Bonaparte to Rene Auberjonois\n\nAs I’ve posted on here before and is probably not news to anyone now, but in case you’re new to the Bonaparte world, here’s the news: Caroline Bonaparte was the third great grandmother to American actor Rene Auberjonois. Rene, mostly known for his role on Star Trek as Odo, Benson as Clayton, and as the singing chef in The Little Mermaid, died about two years ago due to lung cancer. In fact, his full name was Rene Murat Auberjonois. But exactly how is descended from Caroline Bonaparte and Joachim Murat? Come with me and I will show you. Also, he’s related through his various aunts and uncles to some other well known First Empire names.\n\nCaroline and Joachim were the proud parents to four children:\n\n1. Achille Charles Louis Napoleon Murat, crown prince of Naples (who would go on to reside in Florida and marry an American woman)\n\n2. Marie Letizia Josephine Annonciade Murat, Countess of Castigilone\n\n3. Lucien Charles Joseph Napoleon Murat, 2nd Sovereign Prince of Pontecorvo\n\n4. Louise Julie Caroline Murat, Countess Rasponi.\n\nThe happy brood:\n\nRene’s great great grandfather is that handsome little boy in red at Caroline’s feet. Lucien Murat. Let’s take a look at him:\n\ngLucien, after the fall of the Empire and the fallout from it, ended up getting on a ship to sail off to the United States for a better life. His ship ship-wrecked and he was taken hostage by the Spanish. His brother, Achille, had to enlist the help of US President Monroe for his release. Once this was obtained, Lucien made his way to the states and to his uncle Joseph’s estate, Point Breeze, in Bordentown, New Jersey. He proceeded to travel around the country, getting as far as Texas and California. He also met an American woman by the name of Caroline Georgina Fraser whom he married at Joseph’s estate in New Jersey. They had several children while living in the United States, at Bordentown, New Jersey. His wife was a Protestant, daughter of a Scottish immigrant and had ties to the American Revolution. They suffered financially and ended up opening a boarding school for girls with his wife. Luckily for him, he’d eventually make his way back to France when Napoleon III came into power and was elected to the constituent assembly, appointed minister to Turin. in 1852, he received the title of senator and the title of Prince was restored. He tried to make a claim to the Naples throne, was mocked for it, and ended that declaration.\n\nAt the fall of the Second Empire, Lucien made his way back to the US for awhile, doing business in grist and saw mills near Evan Mills, Jefferson County, New York.\n\nHe had five children:\n\n1 Princess Caroline Letitizia Murat\n\n2. Joachim Joseph Napoleon Murat\n\n3. Princess Anne Murat\n\n4. Prince Charles Louis Napoleon Achille Murat\n\n5. Prince Louis Napoleon Murat\n\nLucien Murat dies in Paris.\n\nHis second son, Joachim Joseph Napoleon Murat, is a Major-General in the French Army and marries the grand-daughter of Alexandre Berthier, making Rene a distant relative to the Berthier family also. Joachim will have a grandson, also named Joachim who marries the great-granddaughter of Ney.\n\nSo now Rene has ties to the Berthier and Ney families.\n\nHis son Charles Louis Napoleon Achille Murat’s son, Lucien Charles, he marries Marie Augustine de Rohan-Chabot. Her older sister, Marie Josephine, marries into the Talleyrand family.\n\nSo now Rene has ties to the Bonaparte, Berthier, Ney, Talleyrand families.\n\nRene’s great grandfather is Prince Louis Napoleon Murat. He has two sons. The eldest son, Prince Eugene marries a daughter of Marshal Ney (hello again). They have three children and Prince Eugene dies in an auto accident on the way to Karlsbad. The second son, Prince Michel (Rene’s great paternal grandfather) marries a woman name Helene MacDonald Stallo, heiress to the Standard Oil money. They have a daughter, Princess Laure Louise Napoleone Eugiene Murat, who marries Swiss-American journalist, Fernand Auberjonois, parents to Rene Auberjonois."
