        "text": "Today’s #MarshalMonday reaches the last of the Ms and brings us to the Marshal of whom Savary said: “better if he was endowed with less courage and with rather more sense’. It’s the most vainglorious of the lot, the ‘dandy king’: Joaquim Murat.\n\nMurat was born in La Bastide-Fortunière, Lot; the son of an innkeeper. His family intended him for the priesthood(!), sending him off to study at the seminary in Toulouse. Some reports say he ran away from the seminary for a girl, others that he did so after seeing cavalry pass through the town. Either way, he was soon enlisted in a regiment of chasseurs and in disgrace with his family.\n\nIn 1792 Murat was chosen to join the Constitutional Guard of the Louis XVI. Their job on the face of things was to protect the monarch but in reality was also to prevent the royal family from escaping. He was promoted twice in the following year but was then denounced by his colonel as a suspected royalist. Murat was eventually cleared and for a time demonstrated his republican credentials by signing his name ‘Marat’ after the revolutionary martyr.\n\nMurat came to Napoleon’s attention earlier than many of his fellow marshals. In 1795, when a royalist mob tried to overthrow the government, it was Murat whom General Bonaparte sent to the Place de Sablons to retrieve the required artillery guns. It was these guns which Napoleon would use to disperse the crowd with a ‘whiff of grapeshot’; thus saving the revolutionary government.\n\nWhen Napoleon was sent to command the Army of Italy in 1796, Murat requested to accompany him and was then made his aide-de-camp. It was in Italy where he quickly showed his talent for leading cavalry: fighting at Dego, Ceva and Mondova. Napoleon also gave him the honour of taking captured standards back to France.\n\nBy the end of the Italian campaign, Murat had made a name for himself as one of the finest cavalry officers on the continent, demonstrating unquestionable personal courage. He had also developed a reputation for flamboyance and vanity – his uniforms were inevitably gaudy and eye-catching.\n\nMurat would go on to accompany Napoleon to Egypt, where he fought in numerous engagements, including the battles of Alexandria and the Pyramids. He would particularly distinguish himself at the battle of Abukir and was promoted to général de division by Napoleon in recognition. When Napoleon departed for France, Murat accompanied him.\n\nMurat supported the coup of 18 Brumaire and was made head of the Consular Guard. He cemented even closer ties with Napoleon by then marrying his younger (and least pleasant) sister Caroline Bonaparte. Now the future emperor’s brother in law, he benefitted materially and copiously from Napoleon’s successes as all of his family did.\n\nMurat received a sabre of honour at Marengo and then in 1804, when the Empire was created, his name was on the list of marshals. However, he was popular with very few of the others and even Napoleon, who valued his talents, complained that Murat ‘needed women like he needed food’ and despaired over his lack of strategic awareness.\n\nMurat served with great distinction from 1805-06 and took part in an exhaustive list of battles. He and Lannes (who had been a rival for Caroline’s affections) were instrumental into tricking the Austrians in to surrendering an important bridge over the Danube. His cavalry played an important role at Austerlitz and following this yet more rewards and titles were heaped on him.\n\nThe greatest and highest reward of all came in 1808. Napoleon decided to put his elder brother Joseph – at this time King of Naples – on the throne of Spain instead. This left the throne of Naples vacant and Napoleon (his judgement of his family’s competencies being nothing like as shrewd or intuitive as his judgement for most other things) decided that his brother-in-law was the ideal candidate. Murat and Caroline revelled in their new titles, with the Queen proving the more competent governor.\n\nIn 1812, Murat took command of the army’s advance guard. He so impressed the Russians with his nerve, riding on ahead alone in his garish uniforms, that the Cossacks decreed no one was to kill the King of Naples. Instead, they hoped to take him prisoner.\n\nMurat had plenty of guts, but loyalty was not one of his strong suits. After the retreat from Russia, Napoleon put him in charge of the army while he returned to Paris. Murat was more concerned with his own throne and eventually turned the army over to Eugene de Beauharnais. Once back in Naples, he proceeded to colossally stab Napoleon in the back and opened discussions with the Austrians and the British so that he could keep his own throne. In agreement for keeping Naples, he agreed to manoeuvre against Eugene. The allies of course had no intention of letting Murat remain as king of Naples and as soon as Napoleon abdicated, they next moved on him.\n\nJust as all seemed lost, Napoleon escaped from Elba and it was in the allies’ interest to be on good terms with Murat again. Although he was far from the cleverest of the marshals, he would not be fooled twice and instead decided to call for a unified Italy. His army was badly defeated at Tolentino and even Murat’s ego at last realised that his grasp on Naples was effectively gone.\n\nHis next option was to try running back to Napoleon in the hopes that the former Emperor would retake France and thus restore him to glory. Napoleon, who prior to Waterloo was almost absurdly forgiving of personal betrayals, did not want him and told his brother-in-law to stay away.\n\nAfter Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, Murat and his family were offered asylum in Austria by the Emperor, but he was resolved on one last attempt to take back his throne. With a pitifully small force, Murat set sail for Naples and went ashore with just thirty men. He was quickly captured and thrown in prison.\n\nTo his credit, when Murat was put on trial he argued that none of his men should suffer any punishment as they had been following his commands. He then tried to claim that if they were trying him as a Frenchman, then they had no right to do so, and if they were trying him as a Neapolitan, then he was their king. Neither argument worked and within thirty minutes he had been sentenced to death.\n\nHis personal courage did not fail him at the last. Murat declared that: “”I have braved death too often to fear it!” and refused the proffered blindfold. He stood facing the soldiers and kissed a cameo in Caroline’s likeness. He then gave the words of command himself:\n\n“Soldiers! Do your duty! Straight to the heart but spare the face. Fire!”\n\nMurat and Caroline have numerous descendants still alive today. One of these is the American actor René Murat Auberjonois, famous for playing Odo in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine."
