Untranslated LS in French, signed “C. de Lipona,” one page both sides, 4 x 6.5, September 8, no year. In fine condition, with a repaired tear to the second integral page. Murat was executed in 1815 for his support of Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and Caroline fled to the Austrian Empire to live in exile. During this time, she adopted the title ‘Countess of Lipona,’ an anagram of ‘Napoli [Naples],’ as she signs here. RR Auction COA."
