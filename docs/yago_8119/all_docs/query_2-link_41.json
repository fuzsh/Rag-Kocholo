        "text": "Hi Diane\n\nFinally I am getting closer to home.I am in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. My great grandmother Anne McAleer was the daughter of Owen McAleer and ALICE MURAT (Alice may be the wront spelling).I can find nothing on her mother(yet). But I keep searching.My problem is that Anne was born in Ireland, Dromore Co. Tyrone.At the time of her death in 1952 the local newspaper the following:\n\nLATE SAINT JOHN LADY DECENDENT OF GEN. MURAT OF NAPOLEON’S ARMY\n\nOne of West Saint John’s oldest residents, Mrs. Anne Burchill, widow of John F. Burchill, died on April 19 at her residence, 460 City Line, after a brief illness.She was a decendent of General Murat who served in the army of Napoleon Bonaparte, her grand-mother, having married General Murat, after the fall of Napoleon.Murat was the son of Joachim Murat, a French Marsahll in Napoleon’s Army.He married Caroline, youngest sister of Napoleon in the year 1800, becoming King of Naples, Sicily, in the Napoleonic Regime.He was also Marshall of the Empire and Grand Admiral and Prince of the Empire of France.\n\nMrs. Burchill was 92 years of age.Mrs. Burchill was the former Miss Anne McAleer, daughter of the late Owen and Alice (Murat) McAleer and was born in Dromore, County Tyrone, Ireland, in the Diocese of Clogher, Ireland.She was baptized in the church of St. Aympns, parish of Dromore, and emigrated to Lawrence, Mass. at the age of 16 years, later coming to this area.\n\nFor a period of 40 years, Mrs. Burchill resided at Spruce Lake and during that time was a member of St. Rose’s Parish, Fairville.For the last 35 years, she had been a member of the church of the Assumption and had taken an active part in all parochial affairs.She was a member of the League of the sacred Heart, Women’s Society, Archconfraternity of the Blessed Sacrament and the Order of St. Francis of Assisi.\n\nSurviving are one daughter, Mrs. John Graham, West Saint John; five sons, Francis O., Abraham of West Saint John; James at home; William of Rothesay and Charles B. of Loch Lomond Road, as well as 38 grandchildren, 30 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild, and several nieces and nephews.Her husband predeceased her in 1940, while a son, John M. Burchill, well known contractor died three years ago.Other members of the family deceased are three daughters, Mrs. John Quilty, Mary Ann Burchill, and a daughter Mary Frances, who died in infancy.Two other sons are also dead.They are Samuel Burchill who died in 1932 and Pius Burchill.\n\nThe funeral was held on April 22 from the residence to the Church of the Assumption for Solemn High Mass of Requiem celebrated by Rev. Joseph McGreel, C.Ss.R. of the staff of St. Peter’s Parish, assisted by Rev. D.J. Warner, deacon and Rev. C.J. Mersereau as subdeacon, Rev. H.G. Ramage, Silver Falls was also in the sanctuary.\n\nThe pallbearers were five sons, Francis Owen, Abraham, James, William and Charles B.
