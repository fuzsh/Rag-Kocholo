        "text": "This week’s blog looks at some of the ‘big names’ amongst the Marshals’ wives. The most infamous of them all of course is Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon’s sister, but also here is a woman who tried everything to save her husband from execution and a woman who joined her husband on that deadly retreat from Russia.\n\nMadame Moncey: Charlotte Prospère Remillet\n\nCharlotte was born in Besançonin 1761. She was 29 when she married Bon Adrien de Moncey in parish of Saint-Pierre de Besançonon 30 September 1790. The future Marshal was 36.\n\nSadly there is very little information on Charlotte’s life or marriage. Her husband was considered one of the most honest and trustworthy of all the marshals – Napoleon’s pronouncement on Moncey was that “he was an honest man” – as well as one of the most even-tempered so it would be nice to think that the couple had a happy relationship. Charlotte gave birth to four children; two sons and two daughters. Their youngest son died at the age of only three, while their eldest died in a hunting accident at the age of 21.\n\nIt can be imagined that Charlotte was much distressed to see her husband, a man who had always followed the dictates of his conscience, sentenced to be imprisoned in the fortress of Ham by the Bourbons in retaliation for his refusal to take part in the trial of Marshal Ney. After 1819 their fortunes changed for the better and her husband was once again restored to favour.\n\nBoth Charlotte and her husband lived into their eighties and as such they lived to see Napoleon’s body repatriated to France. Marshal Moncey died on the 20th April 1842 at the age of 87. Charlotte survived him less than a month, dying a few weeks afterwards on the 13th of May at the age of 81.\n\nI could find no portrait of Charlotte Moncey.\n\nMadame Mortier: Eve Anne Hymmès\n\nThe daughter of an innkeeper, Eve was born in Coblence in August 1779. She married Edouard Mortier in 1799 at the age of 20. The 6ft 4” future marshal was eleven years her senior.\n\nMadame Junot reports that Eve was living with her husband in a large home in the Rue de Capuchins in 1800. She also revealed that Eve’s sister, prettier but less amiable, was living with them as well.\n\nMadame Junot described Eve as “young and charming” who “inspired me at first sight with friendship and goodwill. Without being extremely pretty, or in any other way personally remarkable, she pleased by an expression of mildness, and a general gracefulness which prepossessed at the first glance”.\n\nThanks to Madame Junot, a dubious source at times bit an invaluable insight into the life of the marshals’ wives, we also get a small glimpse of Eve’s personality. She is described as a good mother who was fond of her home and of being at home. Her chief focus was the domestic happiness of her husband and her children. It seems to have been a happy home and a cheerful one, with guests reporting that they felt at ease and at home upon entering.\n\nAfter Waterloo, Marshal Mortier was readmitted to the chamber of peers in 1819 and held numerous prestigious appointments. It can be assumed that Eve accompanied her husband during his ambassadorship in St. Petersburg, which was one of these.\n\nThe 1830s were a particularly dark decade for Eve. In 1831, her two youngest daughters died at the ages of 17 and 20. Then in 1835, Eve’s husband was killed during an assassination attempt on King Louis in July 1835 at the age of 67. Eve survived him by 20 years and died in 1855 at the age of 75. She had been pre-deceased by five of her six children. I could find no portrait of her.\n\nMadame Murat, later Queen of Naples: Caroline Bonaparte\n\nCaroline was born in Ajaccio in Corsica in 1782. She was the seventh of Carlos and Letizia Bonaparte’s eight children and the youngest of the three daughters. As a child, she was called Maria Annuziata but ‘Francophied’ her name in 1793, when the family relocated to France. She was enrolled at Madame Campan’s school where she was a contemporary of Hortense de Beauharnais. In 1800, at the age of 17, she married the most flamboyant of all her brother’s generals: Joachim Murat, who was 32. The couple would go on to have two sons and two daughters.\n\nCaroline is always described as the least pleasant of Napoleon’s sisters (Talleyrand said that she had Cromwell’s head on a woman’s body) and she certainly possessed all of the worst Bonaparte traits in abundance. She was vain, greedy and always looking to further her own interests. When Napoleon declared himself the Emperor in 1804, her brothers became princes but she had to take on only the rank of her husband. One of Josephine’s ladies in waiting reported: “As for Madame Murat she was a prey to the most violent mortification and during dinner was so little mistress of her feelings that, on hearing the Emperor address Madame Louis several times as “Princess” that she could not restrain her tears.” The Bonaparte sisters then demanded to become Imperial Princesses. Napoleon, so skilled at dealing with generals, gave in.\n\nCaroline, like all the Bonaparte women, loathed and despised Josephine de Beauharnais. She threw a massive tantrum, including a fainting fit, and refused to carry her train at the coronation. She and Murat conspired to find Napoleon a mistress, Éléonore Denuelle, with the goal of proving that their sister-in-law was infertile. They were successful.\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon made Caroline and Murat the Grand Duke and Duchess of Berg. They had higher ambitions though and these were realised in 1808 when Caroline at last got her hands on a crown. After a quick game of musical thrones, in which brother Joseph was moved to Spain, Caroline and Murat were named the King and Queen of Naples.\n\nAs Queen, Caroline insisted on being consulted on all matters of importance and quarrelled endlessly with her husband. It was accepted however that she was indeed the better statesman. She acted as regent successfully when her husband was absent on campaign several times.\n\nWhen Napoleon married Marie Louise, Caroline was one of the people responsible for meeting the new Empress and escorting her to France. Quick to assert her dominance, she forced Marie Louise to leave behind all of her luggage, including her pet dog. It is alleged that Marshal Berthier, touched by the new Empress’s distress, arranged to have them sent on. Caroline had hoped her own children would be Napoleon’s heirs but his hope was dashed with Marie Louise gave birth to Napoleon II.\n\nWhen things started to go downhill for Napoleon, Caroline showcased her total lack of family loyalty. Her chief concern was holding on to her throne, not the brother from whom she had received it. She and Murat entered into arrangements with the allied coalition with the agreement that they could remain in Naples. When Murat, wise to the fact that the Allies did not intend to honour their word, tried to go back to Napoleon during the Hundred Days the Emperor would not receive him. After a madcap attempt to retain his kingdom, he was executed by firing squad.\n\nCaroline afterwards wrote to Hortense: “My children have a father no longer, my dear Hortense, he has perished and with him is lost all hope of good fortune for my family and me. We will weep for him all our life. My children are all that I can wish for, they alone can give me the strength to support so many misfortunes.”\n\nCaroline lived afterwards in Austria under the alias of the Countess of Lipona before moving to Florence in the 1830s. She may possibly have married General Francesco Macdonald, who was definitely her lover. When Letizia Bonaparte (who refused to see Caroline after 1814) died, she fought with her brothers over her share of the estate. She also spent years trying to petition the French government for money which she claimed was owed to her.\n\nCaroline died on 18 May 1839 of the intestinal cancer which proved to be the scourge of her family. She was interred in the Chiesa di Ognissanti in Florence. In addition to Murat, she had also been a lover of General Junot and Metternich.\n\nMadame Ney: Aglaé Auguié\n\nAglaé was born in 1782 in Paris. Her father Pierre-César Auguié was a receiver general of finance, while her mother Adelaide-Henriette Genet was a lady of the chamber to Queen Marie Antoinette. Aglaé’s maternal aunt was Madame Campan, who took the young girl and her sisters in during the Revolution when their mother, who was on the verge of arrest and certain execution, took her own life in 1794 on the day before Robespierre’s fall ended the Terror.\n\nWhile she was with her aunt, Aglaé became a very close friend of Hortense de Beauharnais who described her as “filled with kindness, sensitivity and pleasure”. Taking an interest in her daughter’s pretty friend, Josephine decided to find Aglaé a suitable husband and selected the dashing, humbly born General Michel Ney. After a little hesitation on both sides, the couple were married in 1802. Aglaé was 20, her husband was 33.\n\nNey became a Marshal of the Empire in 1804, then Duke of Elchingen a couple of years afterwards. Now entitled to be called Duchess, Aglaé was a lady in waiting to the Empress Josephine from 1804 until 1810 and so played an active part in court life. Madame Junot wrote approvingly of her, recalling an anecdote in which they staged amateur theatricals together under the rather authoritarian command of the Bonaparte sisters. Madame Junot stated that Aglaé played her part well, just as she did everything else well. In another entry, she recalled that while at a dinner where numerous big names of the Empire were gathered, Aglaé was pleading in vain for her husband to wear a dress coat, while he cheerfully rebuffed her and assured her he would never do such a thing.\n\nStubborn though he undoubtedly was, Ney seems to have been a very considerate husband to Aglaé, though like most of the marshals he was frequently called away from France on campaign. The couple had four sons born between 1803 and 1812. Chardigny reports that she lived in great material comfort and spent huge sums of money on her house and furnishings.\n\nAfter 1812 though this happy, comfortable life changed for Aglaé and her family . In 1813 her much-loved sister Adele died in a tragic accident. When Napoleon abdicated, she found the returning emigré court treated her coldly and disdainfully. This enraged her husband and on one occasion when Aglaé was reduced to tears by the sneering of the Duchess of Angouleme, he unleashed on that lady a volley of scorn, reminding her when she and her adherents were hiding in England, he had been fighting for France.\n\nMarshal Ney made the fatal decision to rejoin Napoleon and fight for France once more during the Hundred Days. For this he was condemned to death by the Bourbons, who needed a scapegoat. Despite being offered assisted escape by some of his fellow marshals, Ney refused to slink away and leave Aglaé and his sons.\n\nAtteridge gives a sad account of Aglae’s ceasless attempts to try to save her husband from his sentence: “The poor wife was active in supporting the plea thus put forward for amnesty to her husband. Her visits to the gloomy Conciergerie were devoted to consultations as to what could be done. She haunted the offices of Dupin and Berryer. At home she was busy with endless letters claiming for her husband the pardon and immunity which the convention of Paris seemed to guarantee to all. She wrote to the ambassadors, to Wellington, to the Prince Regent of England. To all her touching appeals came the same cold official answers.”All of this showcases devoted loyalty, determination, no small amount of courage and a fierce aim to protect those she loved. The letters exchanged between her and the condemned Marshal at this time were anguished.\n\nAglaé made one last visit to her husband with her children and when they parted she and the children were inconsolable. Her determination was not shattered though and even on the day of the execution she went to the Tuileries to plead for last-minute clemency. When she arrived, she was told it was all already over and fainted.\n\nShe found the loneliness of widowhood hard to bear and quite quickly afterwards secretly married General Louis d’Y de Résigny. She travelled a lot, including stays with her friend Hortense, and saw her two eldest sons enter the service of Sweden (ruled by her late husband’s former comrade). Only under the July monarchy was Ney’s pension restored and his sons permitted to serve in France.\n\nAglaé died on the 2nd of July in Paris in 1854, having survived her famous husband by almost 40 years. Her second son, Michel-Louis, died less than a fortnight later.\n\nMadam Oudinot: François Charlotte Derlin and Eugénie de Coucy\n\nMarshal Oudinot’s first wife was François Charlotte Derlin, whose birthdate is not known for certain. It is estimated she was born somewhere around 1769. This would make her around 20 years old when she married Nicolas Oudinot in September 1789. Her new husband was 22.\n\nCalled by her second name of Charlotte, she is described very uncharitably by Paul Austin simply as a “very fat woman, never seen at court”. The lady who was to follow in her shoes as Madame Oudinot served her better; stating that though “possessed of no fortune, she displayed a disinterestedness equal to his own, gave him 20 years of happiness and became the mother of many children”. She bore her husband two sons and five daughters before she died in 1810. Napoleon refused Oudinot permission to return home when she died and, as he was not able to get back until seven months later, it is certain that he was never even able to attend her funeral. I could find no portrait of Charlotte Oudinot.\n\nWhen it came to choosing his second wife, Oudinot was a newly-appointed Marshal of the Empire. In 1812, he married Eugénie de Coucy. Eugénie was born in 1791 at Haute-Saône to a family of old nobility. She had been 19 when she caught the marshal’s eye and he had initially thought of her as a potential wife for his eldest son. Won over by her charms though, he proposed to her himself, asking a go-between to “Tell Mlle. De Coussy that I’m forty-four and have 500,000 francs in rents. As for my social position, it is well-known; and I should be happy to share it with her.”\n\nShe accepted and they were married on the 19th of January 1812. Thus Eugénie , at the age of only 20, was a Duchess of the Empire with a husband more than twice her age. Less than two weeks later, Oudinot had to leave for the ill-fated invasion of Russia.\n\nEugénie adored her frequently-wounded husband and was in a constant state of worry as regards his health. When she took delivery of a bust of the marshal, she was convinced it was an omen when the left shoulder fell off. She was right – Oudinot’s shoulder was shattered at Polotsk in mid-August that year.\n\nNapoleon had issued strict orders that no woman should cross the Niemen but when she got word of her husband’s injury, Eugenie showed a determination that was a match for the Emperor’s. She was set on looking after him herself.\n\nAccompanied by one of her Uncles, she crossed Germany in a carriage. At Berlin, she met Marshal Augereau who advised her to dress in leather going forward. Still not to be dissuaded, Eugenie made her way through Lithuania and at last reached her husband at Vilna in October. He was much improved but she stayed with him and noted he grew very agitated at the suggestion of a retreat. He returned to the army some weeks later but was brought back to her at Vilna at the start of December badly wounded once more. She never left his side from that point through the last of the deadly retreat from Russia.\n\nChardigny pays tribute to her bravery: “This is how the Duchess of Reggio, a fragile young woman accustomed to the sweetest life, participated in the end of this retreat from Russia whose memory still raises so much horror and pity. From Wilna to Kowno and Koenigsberg, almost dying of cold, once almost perishing in the fire of a shelter, suffering from hunger, and even exposed to the contagion of typhus, the Maréchale Oudinot showed a courage worthy of her lineage. She succeeded in bringing back her husband; he was in bad shape, but saved. She told, not without pride, the ups and downs of this dramatic journey, in charming memoirs that have not yet been fully published.”\n\nNapoleon did not approve of Eugenie and decried Oudinot of being “dominated by a young wife of good family”. When he returned during the Hundred Days, the couple lived quietly at Bar and Oudinot wisely refused to choose a side. They went on to have four children between 1816 and 1822 and such was their standing with the restored Bourbons that Louis XVIII and the Duchess of Angouleme stood as godparents to their children.\n\nEugenie and her marshal were a devoted, loving couple and their surviving correspondence is full of tenderness. A trove of previously unseen letters were sold at auction in 2017. She was noted as having softened Oudinot’s temper a little (it had previously been prodigious).\n\nMarshal Oudinot eventually became governor of Les Invalides, succeeding Marshal Moncey. It was here that he died in September 1848, aged 81. Eugenie went on to publish their memoirs and survived for 20 years. She died in April 1868 at the age of 76."
