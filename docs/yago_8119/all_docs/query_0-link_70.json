        "text": "Joachim Murat was a French military commander and statesman and brother-in-law of Napoleon Bonaparte. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was crowned King of Naples as Joachim-Napoleon.\n\nDuring the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, Murat became very close to Napoleon, accompanying him on many military campaigns. In 1800, Murat married Napoleon's sister, Caroline Bonaparte.\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon granted Murat the Grand Duchy of Berg, and in 1808 he was granted the Kingdom of Naples, succeeding Joseph Bonaparte who was crowned King of Spain.\n\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Murat fled into exile before being arrested by Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was sentenced to death by firing squad and was killed on 13 October 1815."
