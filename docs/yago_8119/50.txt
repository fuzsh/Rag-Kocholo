Caroline Bonaparte

Queen of Naples

1782-1839

Caroline was the youngest of Napoleon's sisters and he was very happy that she married one of his closest lieutenants - Joachim Murat - in 1800.

The couple was given the Duchy of Berg in 1806 and, in 1808, the Kingdom of Naples.

Effectively ruling the nation while her husband was fighting for France, Caroline proved able and popular.
