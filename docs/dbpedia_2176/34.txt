The band was formed in 2016 in Ferrara, an Italian comune. From the beginning, they set out to compose Celtic, medieval, sometimes ambient music with tribal sounds. Only after they surpassed the number of 15 compositions of their own, they began to perform live at medieval fairs.

Many of the instruments used by the band members during the performances were built by themselves. The objective was to recreate the melodies and sounds appreciated by ancestral peoples.

The members grew up in the fields and woods that surround Ferrara. They were inspired by the natural landscapes around them to compose their music and awaken in their listeners emotions that these environments and their elements inspire.
