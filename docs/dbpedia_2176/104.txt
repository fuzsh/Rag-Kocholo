A maestro goldsmith and sculptor from Florence, Alessandro Dari infuses his deep-rooted passion for art into every piece of handcrafted jewelry. As the pioneer of the “Perceptual Dynamism” movement, Dari stands as a multifaceted artist, bridging classical music and a pharmaceutical background into his creative process, reviving the Renaissance spirit in each unique creation. His journey continuously sparks fresh inspiration, leading to the crafting of world-class, unique artistic jewels that transcend time and place.

Employing techniques derived from Etruscan, Classical, Gothic, and Renaissance art, Master Dari handcrafts artistic jewels that merge languages and styles from architecture to anatomy.

This artistic fusion has birthed unique collections, including the “Churches Collection” (1980-1985) and the “Castles Collection” (1990), true masterpieces of design and craftsmanship at the heart of Florence.

The Advanced School of Artistic Jewelry led by Master Alessandro Dari pays homage to the historical artistic workshops of Florence, where craftsmanship and art converge in a sublime exercise of knowledge.

Here, technical learning starts with the observation of reality’s forms, progresses through the art of geometric drawing and the study of the golden ratio, and culminates in the replication of architectural and anatomical elements. It’s an educational journey to create handcrafted jewelry that stands as true masterpieces of goldsmith art.
