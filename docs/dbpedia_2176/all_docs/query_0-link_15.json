        "text": "The RISM publications represent RISM’s activities that began in 1952 and continue to the present day. The focus of RISM’s current activities is its electronic database, which can be searched at no cost through two resources, the RISM Catalog and RISM Online. RISM’s library sigla can be searched through the Directory of RISM Library Sigla.\n\nRISM Database\n\nRISM’s over 1.4 million records can be searched through two different but complementary resources, the RISM Catalog and RISM Online. The musical sources that stand at the heart of the RISM project are music manuscripts, printed music, libretti, and treatises preserved in over 3,000 libraries, museums, archives, churches, schools, and private collections around the world. Our online tools incorporate records from earlier series (all of A/I, all of A/II, all of B/I, some of B/II and other B volumes; for details, see below), but also expand well beyond our early publications. The database grows monthly and reflects the work of our active RISM contributors worldwide.\n\nRISM Catalog\n\nThe RISM Catalog can be accessed through the RISM homepage or from opac.rism.info. It is made possible through a partnership between the Bavarian State Library (Munich), the State Library of Berlin, and the RISM Editorial Center. The Bavarian State Library is responsible for the operation and technical implementation of the RISM Catalog.\n\nRISM Online\n\nRISM Online can be accessed through the RISM homepage or from rism.online. It is developed by the RISM Digital Center in Bern, Switzerland. Besides the core RISM pool of sources, RISM Online also enables users to search the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM).\n\nSeries A: Inventories of musical sources\n\nAll of Series A is available online through RISM’s electronic catalogs. Items within the scope of A/I and A/II are added directly to the RISM database. The alphanumeric A/I identification numbers (for example, T 444) are searchable online but are not being continued for new records in RISM.\n\nA/I: Einzeldrucke vor 1800 (Individual Prints before 1800)\n\nKassel: Bärenreiter, 1971-2011. 9 volumes, 4 supplements, index, CD-ROM; available online since 2015.\n\nEinzeldrucke vor 1800, 9 vols., 1971-1981.\n\nEinzeldrucke vor 1800: Addenda et Corrigenda, 4 vols., 1986-1999.\n\nEinzeldrucke vor 1800: Register der Verleger, Drucker und Stecher und Register der Orte zu den Bänden 1-9 und 11-14, 2003.\n\nA/I: Einzeldrucke vor 1800. Datenbank auf CD-ROM, 2011.\n\nFor a supplement to A/I volume 9, see Haberkamp and Rösing (1981).\n\nSeries A/I was published in fourteen printed volumes between 1971 and 2003, and in one CD-ROM that incorporates all of the printed volumes in 2011. A/I is a bibliography of printed music published between 1500 and 1800 that contains works by a single composer. At around 100,000 entries, at the time of publication it was the most comprehensive resource available for printed music editions. A/I was added to the online RISM database in 2015.\n\nA/II: Music Manuscripts after 1600\n\nMusikhandschriften nach 1600\n\nSixteen editions total: 1-2 on microfiche (1984-1986); 3-16 on CD-ROM in German, English, French, Italian, Spanish (Munich: K. G. Saur Verlag, 1996-2008). Subscription database from EBSCO (2008-present; offered through NISC 2002-2008). Published in the online RISM database in 2010.\n\nAt the time of its conception, A/II was the most comprehensive guide available to music manuscripts created after 1600. The first edition (1984) contained ca. 19,000 entries and the sixteenth (2008) contained ca. 614,000 entries. In 2010, A/II was published as a freely available online catalog with over 700,000 entries. The nature of the A/II project has expanded over the years to include music manuscripts from before 1600 to the present day, and all music manuscripts are now part of the larger RISM database.\n\nSeries B: Bibliographies organized by topic\n\nPublisher: Munich: G. Henle (unless otherwise noted)\n\nRISM’s Series B covers specific categories of repertory. All of B/I and a portion of B/II are in the RISM electronic database, as are a few items from other B series (for details, see the specific B volumes below).\n\nB/I and B/II: Printed collections of the 16th-18th centuries\n\nAll of B/I and about 25% of B/II are included in the RISM electronic database. While items within the scope of these series are added directly to the RISM database, the numbering scheme used in the books is not being continued.\n\nB/I: François Lesure, Recueils imprimés, XVIe-XVIIe siècles (1960).\n\nCountries included: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, USSR, Yugoslavia.\n\nAn index of composers in B/I, edited by Petro Zappalà, is available as a PDF.\n\nB/II: François Lesure, Recueils imprimés, XVIIIe siècle (1964)\n\nCountries included: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, USSR, Yugoslavia.\n\nFor a supplement to B/II, see Lesure (1972).\n\nTaken together, B/I and B/II describe about 4,500 printed collections (anthologies) published between 1501 and 1799.\n\nB/III: The theory of music from the Carolingian Era up to c.1500\n\nB/III is available as a searchable database through Lexicon musicum Latinum and in revised form through Musmed.fr.\n\nB/III/1: Joseph Smits van Waesberghe with Peter Fischer and Christian Maas, The Theory of Music from the Carolingian Era up to 1400.

They offer a “description of all manuscripts in which are preserved Latin treatises—however small—dealing with the theory of music which was in use from the Carolingian era to 1400,” which was extended to 1500 in volume 3. “Moreover, it relates the anonymous treatises in one or other manuscript to those other manuscripts in which the same–generally unpublished–treatise is found…The Index supplies a survey of the manuscripts in which this theoretical tradition is preserved, by providing a list of the authors’ names and the incipits of the anonymous treatises.”\n\nB/IV: Manuscripts of polyphonic music, 11th-16th centuries\n\nSearch B/IV in DIAMM (Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music) and RISM Online.\n\nB/IV/1: Gilbert Reaney, Manuscripts of Polyphonic Music. 11th-Early 14th Century, 1966.\n\nDescription, bibliography and thematic incipits for all the known polyphonic manuscripts up to the beginning of the Ars Nova period.\n\nCountries included: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, USSR.\n\nB/IV/2: Gilbert Reaney, Manuscripts of Polyphonic Music (c. 1320-1400).
