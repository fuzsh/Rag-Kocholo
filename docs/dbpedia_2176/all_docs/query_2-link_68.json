        "text": "Italian accordion Inventors and Pioneers\n\nThe Accordion, a beloved musical instrument that has been delighting ears since the 19th century, was likely born in Germany but perfected by Italian artisans. It is believed that this dynamic sound system first came to Italy through French soldiers during the unification of Europe’s boot-shaped country – although you could call it an act of fate.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Stradella and Vercelli in Lombardy and Piedmont were bustling hubs of production which would be integral to future developments in instrumentation. Chief among these pioneers was Mariano Dallape’, a craftsman from Trento who revitalized Buton’s piano accordion invention of 1852 during his time at Stradella beginning in 1876.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi’s impassioned advocacy for the accordion in Italy bore remarkable fruit during these years, as its success and popularity soared. So great was his confidence that he proposed introducing it to the Italian conservatory – setting a new standard of music education at the time.\n\nDuring the 1800s, accordions saw a surge of remarkable innovations with artisans improving on existing designs. Mattia Berardi and the Ranco family from Vercelli improved button model accordions while Rosario Spadaro registered copyright for an exclusive free-bass design.\n\nPasquale Ficosecco pioneered box style models in Loreto before transferring his work to Castelfidardo where Ercole Maga and Renato Massoni crafted their products at Dallape’s workshop in Stradella.\n\nModern Innovation and Evolving Style\n\nThree more innovators join the illustrious ranks of Castelfidardo, Giacomo Antonio Busilacchio, Dario Dari and Francesco Serenelli. This is a town steeped in music heritage that has seen countless virtuoso’s discover their passion for sound beginning with the Fisarmonica accordion – an exceptional instrument born out of this unique place on Earth. To learn even more about its remarkable history, watch this video\n\nMost popular Italian accordion brands\n\nWe can’t talk about Italian accordions and the Castelfidardo region without enumerating at least 20 most popular accordion brands that came out of its factories and are played throughout the world by some of the most famous virtuosos of the piano squeezebox. Here are the brand names: Beltuna, Fismen, Scandalli, Dino Baffetti,Siwa&Figli,Paolo Soprani,Piermaria,Borsini,Bugari Armando,Excelsor,Zero Sette,Piatanesi,Fantini,Brandoni&Sons,Pigini,Vignoni,Fratelli Alessandrini,Victoria,Mengascini.\n\nTake a listen to this wonderful podcast about Italian accordion makers and Castelfidardo by NPR.\n\nItalian accordions in the North Americas\n\nThe Italian accordion legacy continues to remain strong in America, thanks to the revered craftsmanship of original immigrant artisans from Italy. The Italo-American accordions they crafted retain classic design features and distinguished bass & register arrangements that have become a trademark for these models today. Most are piano style, but many button versions are still available too.\n\nDuring the post-WWII era, Castelfidardo was a hub of accordion production. Longtime family business Settimio Soprani partnered with F.lli Scandalli from Camerano to create Farfisa – among several other vast mergers that would come to define the decades following conflict’s end.\n\nEven New York based Excelsior opened up shop in this small Italian town by beginning their own line of productions there as well! This newfound influx gave rise not only an abundance of new industry competition but also imaginative company names evoking Hollywood cinema;\n\nItalian-American piano accordions\n\nParamount Accordions and Universal were two such examples now synonymous with acclaimed excellence within instrument craftsmanship worldwide.\n\nMarconi Street is even known fondly around these parts for having originally been christened ‘Dollar Street’ due its many affluent directors residing here at one time or another during those golden times past!\n\nItalian accordionists and accordion makers had their studios and shops in almost every major city in America in the early 1900s but the most influential ones were in Chicago and New York.\n\nItalian Accordion virtuosos\n\nPietro Frosini\n\nPietro Frosini (1885-1951) was a renowned accordionist recognized as one of the earliest “stars of the accordion.” Born in Catania, Sicily, Frosini started playing the chromatic button accordion at the young age of six. In 1905, he migrated to San Francisco and was discovered by a talent scout from the Orpheum Vaudeville Circuit.\n\nHe went on to become a staff accordionist for WOR radio in New York, holding this position until his passing in 1951. Frosini’s contributions to the accordion included performing, teaching, composing, and arranging music.\n\nThroughout his career, he penned over 200 original compositions for the instrument. Presently, the “Frosini Society,” established in 1984 by Swedish accordionist Lars Ek, is based in Sweden.\n\nMarco Lo Russo\n\nMarco Lo Russo is internationally recognized as one of Italy’s prominent contemporary musicians. He showcases his eclectic and diverse musical taste, encompassing multi-ethnic and contemporary sounds and rhythms.\n\nHe has received praise from critics and consistently collaborates and innovates with renowned international artists like Ennio Morricone, Nicola Piovani, Pupi Avati, and Leo Brouwer, to name a few. His passion for music extends from classical and contemporary repertoire to Argentinean tango, jazz, and electronic influences.\n\nOver the past 25 years, Marco Lo Russo has emerged as an internationally acclaimed and extraordinary musician: accordionist, composer, arranger, producer (Rouge Sound Production), conductor, musicologist and professor at the Conservatory of Music of accordion, techniques of musical composition and arrangement.\n\nLouis Ferrari\n\nLouis Ferrari (1910–1987) was an Italian musette accordionist and composer known for his contributions to the French music scene in the 1930s. He founded the Ferrari & Son Ensemble, which performed in various clubs in Paris. Louis Ferrari was also the cousin of renowned jazz accordionist Tony Muréna.\n\nOne of his well-known compositions, “Domino,” gained wide popularity through the renditions of notable singers such as Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Tony Martin, and Andy Williams. This song featured lyrics in both French, written by Jacques Plante, and English, written by Don Raye.\n\nGianni Corsica\n\nGianni Coscia, an Italian jazz accordionist, was born on January 23, 1931, in Alessandria. Initially pursuing a career in law, Coscia eventually dedicated himself entirely to jazz music.\n\nHe demonstrates a keen interest in exploring the cultural and popular traditions using the language of jazz. With an extensive presence in the international jazz scene, Coscia has garnered recognition from fellow luminaries such as Umberto Eco, his former classmate, who wrote the liner notes for his debut CD.\n\nNoteworthy collaborations include partnering with Luciano Berio on the music for a stage production against antisemitism. Since 1995, he has primarily collaborated with wood-player Gianluigi Trovesi, prominently showcased on ECM Records. Additionally, Coscia has served as a member of the Council of the Chigiana Music Academy in Siena since 2006.\n\nRocco Granata\n\nRocco, born on August 16th, 1938 in Figline Vegliaturo, Calabria, attended school in Belgium and continued the solfège lessons he had started in Italy. At the age of fifteen, he was allowed by his father to skip school and began working as a mechanic in a Vespa-shop. Although Rocco had a keen interest in Vespa and Italian engines, his true passion was music.\n\nOn weekends, he performed with his band, ‘The International Quintet’, initially playing the accordion but eventually becoming the lead singer. His repertoire primarily consisted of sentimental Italian ballads, with the crowd particularly fond of the song ‘MANUELA’.\n\nAfter successful performances in New York, Montreal, and Toronto’s Massey Hall, Rocco returned to Europe, especially Germany, where he achieved great success as a composer, recording artist, and actor in musical movies.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Rocco established his own music publishing company, GRANATA MUSIC EDITIONS, and his own record company, CARDINAL RECORDS, producing music for Belgian artists.\n\nRocco found fulfillment and joy in this line of work. However, his artistic spirit compelled him to record ‘MARINA’ again in a new dance style in 1989, reviving the accordion solo and reasserting himself as the top singer on the charts, three decades later. Consequently, Rocco resumed touring, including South America in his itinerary this time.\n\nAntonio-Tony Murena\n\nAntonio Muréna, hailing from Borgo Val di Taro in Italy, migrated to France in 1923 and settled in Nogent-sur-Marne. His journey as a performer started with his uncle gifting him his first accordion, and his cousin Louis Ferrari offering unwavering support. From 1932, Muréna began playing the bandoneón in tango orchestras led by Rafael and Eduardo Bianco Canaro.\n\nHe graced numerous French clubs like La Boule Noire, Java, The Silhouette, Balajo (rue de Lappe), Pré Catelan, and Ciro’s. Moreover, he toured South America, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. In 1949, he became the proprietor of the Le Mirliton cabaret, where he frequently shared the stage with Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt.\n\nCollaborations with Matelo Ferret, Henri Crolla, Didi Duprat, Jo Privat, and Gus Viseur enriched his musical repertoire. Furthermore, in 1958, Antonio Muréna formed the Radio Luxembourg Orchestra and hosted the television show “36 Candles.” He departed from this world in France."
