        "text": "American Voices has extensive experience in Afghanistan, having carried out large-scale programs such as Jazz Bridges Afghanistan in 2006, Winter Academies at the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM) and YES Academy Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif in 2011.\n\nIt was during these programs that we met and collaborated with members of one of Afghanistan’s most revered musical families, Ahmad Fanoos and Sons.\n\nAV’s on-the-ground experience taught us so much about this proud nation and its rich confluence of cultures, languages, kingdoms and iconic cultural sites. It is our pleasure to collaborate in this program with the Fanoos family in bringing to U.S. audiences these timeless aspects of Afghan culture and experience that surpass the past 40 years of war and conflict.\n\nAmerican Voices invites you to indulge yourself in a multi-media experience beyond a concert or a lecture. The Heart of Afghanistan will take you back in time and place to discover Afghanistan's pre-Islamic, traditional and contemporary culture through song, poetry, photography and art.\n\nThese four recently airlifted Afghani artists will take you on a journey across this vast and diverse nation, from ancient odes lauding the Bhuddist statues of Bamiyan to Sufi ghazals of Rumi, and the Elvis-inspired Afghan pop of the 60s and 70s.\n\nHeart of Afghanistan is a production of American Voices' in collaboration with the Fanoos family. We hope to bring you closer to a deep appreciation of Afghanistan's complicated but rich history through its music, poetry, and scenes of both daily traditional life and iconic cultural sites. Join us in developing an awareness among U.S. audiences of authentic Afghani culture even as the nation undergoes another challenging phase in its cultural life."
