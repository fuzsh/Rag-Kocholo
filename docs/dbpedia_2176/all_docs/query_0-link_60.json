It was one of many other songs considered for the ending sequence, as a part of a royalty-free music library that Nickelodeon had access to.[1]\n\nIt was released on the Bruton Music library album, American Games.\n\nThe song was paired with another song titled Can't Stop the Rock.\n\nThe song appears on The Yellow Album, but it's a direct cut from the \"Band Geeks\" episode that contains sound effects. However, where the TV version ends with the audio fading out, this album version adds an extra part, which is the final chorus of the full song but without vocals (instrumental version).\n\nThe song has often been misattributed to artists such as Van Halen, Journey, KISS, Queen & John Parr.\n\nThis song was named as the #1 greatest moment in Nicktoons history during the Top 100 Moments in Nicktoons History.\n\nThis is the second song where SpongeBob sings, but his voice is not provided by Tom Kenny. The first is \"Ripped Pants,\" where the song is sung by Peter Straus.\n\nThe song is only translated in the Serbian, Georgian, Hebrew, and Lithuanian versions.\n\nThe Serbian and Hebrew versions have re-sung vocals layered on top of the original vocals.\n\nThe Serbian dub has SpongeBob sing in his own voice rather than that of David Glen Eisley's.\n\nIn the Georgian and Lithuanian versions, the translated lyrics are read out by a narrator.\n\nIn the Persian and Italian dubs, this song is cut (shortened in the PSiM Persian dub) due to unknown reasons.[2] For Italian, likely due to commercial constraints, as the dub was commissioned for a commercial broadcaster (Italia 1), for Persian, likely as \"music is haram\" in Islam.\n\nThe song appears in the game SpongeBob's Game Frenzy, where it is in the mini game of \"Band Geeks.\"\n\nFollowing Stephen Hillenburg's death, a petition was created to have the song played during the Super Bowl LIII halftime show to honor his legacy.[3] While the song itself was not played at Super Bowl LIII halftime show, an exclusive SpongeBob clip with a reference to \"Band Geeks\" was used as an introduction to Travis Scott's \"Sicko Mode.\" Extremely negative backlash ensued across the internet by many people and fans of the show who felt betrayed and disappointed.\n\nHowever, the song in full, along with a dedication to Hillenburg, was played in the stadium after the game.[4]\n\nIn response to the complaints, the Dallas Stars played the song in full at their stadium[5] during one of their games. However, they edited the colors of the band's uniforms in the animation to match the Stars' green colors, changed the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium to the American Airlines Center, and replaced the footage of the Memphis Showboats vs. Tampa Bay Bandits game with footage of Stars fans.\n\nThe song originally played on February 1 against the Minnesota Wild,[6] who also have green colors. The Stars played it again during the February 4 game against the Arizona Coyotes, who have red colors.\n\nSoon after, other sports teams took advantage of the song’s absence from the Super Bowl Halftime show by playing it in their own sporting events. One notable example is NASCAR using the song for a promotional video for the 2019 Daytona 500 featuring clips of highlights from previous races, as well as a few cameos of SpongeBob himself.[7]\n\nEven David Glen Eisley, the original performer of the song, released a special orchestral version of the song.\n\nThis song was briefly played at the 2019 Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nClancy Brown considers this song to be one of his favorites of the show.[8]\n\nThe drumming was originally done by Eric Singer.\n\nSpongeBob's eyes are closed for the majority of the song, except in the first verse.\n\nIn the line \"On the world closing in,\" SpongeBob is wearing the friendship ring from \"The Secret Box.\"\n\nThe song was removed from the APM and Universal Production Music search engines in August 2019, probably due to David Glen Eisley gaining full rights to the track before. However, it was later reinstated on the APM Music catalog at an unknown date.\n\nThe song appears in the finale of Paramount+ Expedition to promote the streaming service Paramount+ during Super Bowl LV.\n\nThe song appeared in The Cosmic Shake, as the first part of the end credits.\n\nThe song appears as an opening song for the live broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII: Live from Bikini Bottom, which is also reanimated in the style of Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years, although with choppier animation similar to The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.\n\nVideos[]\n\nReferences[]"
