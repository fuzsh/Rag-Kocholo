        "text": "Home to Nearly 5,100 Farms\n\nSan Diego County has nearly 5,100 farms including full-time, part-time, large, small, conventional, organic, urban, rural, established, and just starting out. Approximately 69% of San Diego County farms are 1-9 acres and more than 40% of the producers are women. San Diego is a leading producer of avocados nationwide, and top crops include nursery, flowers, tomatoes, citrus, poultry, eggs, mushrooms, succulents, and strawberries.\n\nAt daily San Diego farmers markets in neighborhoods throughout the county, you can sample fresh-from-the-farm produce from regional farmers and tasty treats from local artisans. Mingle with the locals and meet the farmers while you nibble on sweet, ripe fruit, listen to live music, stroll through colorful booths, and experience San Diego's delicious lifestyle. At some markets, cooks whip up crepes, kettle corn and tamales; vendors sell garlic-stuffed olives, olive oil, cheese, and honey, all prepared locally.\n\nAt many farmers markets, you'll also find local artisans selling everything from handmade soaps, jewelry, and art to textiles, pottery, photography, and other crafted treasures.\n\nOn Almost Any Given Day\n\nOn Tuesday afternoons, cross the bridge into charming Coronado, where beautiful views of San Diego Bay are complemented by a quaint small-town vibe and fresh produce at the Coronado Farmers Market. On Wednesday evenings, farmers congregate at the Ocean Beach Certified Farmers Market where their bounty is paired with live bands, art vendors and friendly locals in the laid-back beach town. On Thursday afternoons, head to one of San Diego's trendiest neighborhoods for the North Park Farmers Market. Here, you'll find artists, innovators and urbane young families shopping for grass-fed beef, pastured chickens and the best produce local farmers have to share.\n\nOn Friday mornings, check out the Rancho Bernardo Certified Farmers Market for fresh produce, hot food vendors, baked goods, handmade crafts, and more. During the weekends, hit up the Little Italy Mercato on Saturday mornings and sample \"la dolce vita\" with a cup of espresso, while you peruse five blocks of local goods ranging from artisan-cured meats and fresh live uni to rainbows of fruits and veggies.\n\nAnd on Sunday mornings, choose from (among others) the sprawling Hillcrest Farmers Market, filled with food vendors, artisans and farmers; the seaside La Jolla Open Aire Market, with fresh produce, clothing, jewelry, cut flowers and more; and the New Point Loma Farmers Market, which not only offers fresh produce, ready-made food, pastries, arts and crafts and more, but also provides a mothers' feeding tent and a family changing area, as well as live music and games and a childrenâ€™s educational/fun area.\n\nNo matter what time of year or what day of the week you visit San Diego, you'll find incredible markets where the region's farmers share the amazing bounty of San Diego agriculture.\n\nFor more information about farmers markets around San Diego County, visit the San Diego County Farm Bureau website.
