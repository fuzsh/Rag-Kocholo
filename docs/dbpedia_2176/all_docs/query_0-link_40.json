        "text": "To whom it may concern,\n\nIt would be an amazing idea to include an option to create somehow a list of the words or sentence your are actually translating in order to create a personal notebook with a list of vocabulary you didnât know and you want to remember.\n\nYour users could go throw this list and actually learn this useful words or sentences. We, sometimes, translate something and then this translation, which (to be honest and grateful) is usually (almost every time) very accurate, is forgotten.\n\nIt would be an amazing way to create a personal notebook where you can find all your searches and learn them in the future.\n\nI have to say that this is the 1st opinion I write and I truly do it in order to help you to improve because I work for a tech company who really take this opinions into consideration and I believe this might help you to continue being a spearhead ( I donât know if you use this expression but in Spanish means to be the first â ser una punta de lanzaâ) on this sense and one, if not the best, of the best translators.\n\nThanks,\n\nDaniel Curto\n\nBrilliant app but the TRASLATIONS are wrong and need translations need improving and the whole app needs to work offline too (as I don't always have internet near me) and when it speaks in Romanian and some other languages it speaks like a robot and is hard to understand where as with the other languages it talks in a normal voice also some of the audio is missing like for Nepali and s few other languages and and the audio is missing for Irish (if your going to have irish there , you might as well have audio to the Irish one but with Irish accent , non robotic the same for the other languages too !!!) I want to learn Irish and Romanian and nepali so i want audio and I don't want robotic audio But all in all I am very happy with this app !! But\n\nPlease fix those problems as my sister needs this app to speak to her Nepalese helper the helper is for her disabled son (my nephew)\n\niPhone 4S and etc"
