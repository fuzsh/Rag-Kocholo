        "text": "Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 12GB to 17GB of space, including iOS 17 with its latest features and Apple apps that can be deleted. Apple apps that can be deleted use about 4.5GB of space, and you can download them back from the App Store. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version, settings, and iPhone model.\n\nSize and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.\n\niPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions. Resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.\n\nApple Cash services are provided by Green Dot Bank, Member FDIC. Learn more about the Terms and Conditions. Only available in the U.S. on eligible devices. To send and receive money with an Apple Cash account, you must be 18 and a U.S. resident. If you’re under 18, your family organizer can set up Apple Cash for you as part of their Apple Cash Family account, but you may not be able to access features that require a supported payment card. Security checks may require more time to make funds available. Apple Cash Family accounts can send up to $2000 per transaction and receive up to $2000 within a seven‑day period. To access and use all Apple Cash features, you must have an eligible device with Wallet that supports and has the latest version of iOS.\n\nAvailable only in select cities and transit systems. Requires eligible device and OS version. See here for details.\n\nMerchant offers may change at any time.\n\nApple Card Family Participants and Co-Owners do not need to have a familial relationship but must be part of the same Apple Family Sharing group.\n\nService is included for free for two years with the activation of any iPhone 15 model. Connection and response times vary based on location, site conditions, and other factors. See support.apple.com/kb/HT213885 for more information.\n\niPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro can detect a severe car crash and call for help. Requires a cellular connection or Wi‑Fi calling.\n\nData plan required. 5G, Gigabit LTE, VoLTE, and Wi‑Fi calling are available in select markets and through select carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see apple.com/iphone/cellular.\n\nWi‑Fi 6E available in countries and regions where supported.\n\nUltra Wideband availability varies by region.\n\nFaceTime calling requires a FaceTime‑enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi‑Fi connection. Availability over a cellular network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply.\n\nStandard dynamic range video content only.\n\nSiri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Internet access required. Cellular data charges may apply.\n\nUSB 3 cable with 10Gb/s speed required.\n\nAll battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See apple.com/batteries and apple.com/iphone/battery.html for more information.\n\nWireless chargers sold separately.\n\nTesting conducted by Apple in August 2023 using preproduction iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max units and software and accessory Apple USB‑C Power Adapter (20W Model A2305). Fast‑charge testing conducted with drained iPhone units. Charge time varies with settings and environmental factors; actual results will vary.\n\niPhone 15 models are activated with an eSIM and do not support a physical SIM. Use of an eSIM requires a carrier that supports eSIM and a wireless service plan (which may include restrictions on switching service providers and roaming, even after contract expiration). See your carrier for details. To learn more, visit apple.com/esim.\n\nWireless broadband recommended; fees may apply.\n\nIn China mainland, you can use Apple Pay on the web in Safari only on compatible iPhone and iPad models using iOS 11.2 or later.\n\nData accurate as of product launch.\n\nProduct recycled or renewable content is the mass of certified recycled material relative to the overall mass of the device, not including packaging or in-box accessories.\n\nCarbon reductions are calculated against a baseline scenario: 1) No use of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond what is already available on the grid (based on regional emissions factors). 2) Apple’s carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015 (our baseline year for our 2030 product carbon neutrality goal). Carbon intensity of materials reflects use of recycled content and production technology. 3) Apple’s average mix of transportation modes (air, rail, ocean, ground) by product line across three years (fiscal years 2017 to 2019) to best capture the baseline transportation emissions of our products.\n\nWe estimate the percentage of electricity-related emissions in our manufacturing that is sourced from clean electricity by attributing to our carbon model clean energy procured by our suppliers in the prior fiscal year, based on the supplier manufacturing allocations at time of product launch. Included in this number is only clean electricity that Apple or its suppliers have procured as part of Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program.\n\nOn a mass balance allocation.\n\nApple’s Regulated Substances Specification describes Apple’s restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances in materials in Apple products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging used for shipping products to Apple’s end‑customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco‑label requirements, environmental standards, and Apple policies. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates except for AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two‑prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances for new products where technically possible.\n\nBreakdown of U.S. retail packaging by weight. Adhesives, inks, and coatings are excluded from our calculations of plastic content and packaging weight."
