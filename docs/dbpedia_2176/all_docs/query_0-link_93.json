        "text": "Admission Requirements\n\nAt a minimum, all applicants must meet program-specific academic/non-academic requirements, and English language requirements. Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not guarantee entry into the program.\n\nIn line with the university's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors.\n\nThe University reserves the right to alter or discontinue its programs and change admission requirements as needed.\n\nDomestic applicants\n\nBefore applying for a program, you should review the general information about domestic undergraduate admission to ANU programs and how to apply, and the program-specific information below.\n\nApplicants with recent secondary education are assessed on:\n\ncompletion of Australian Year 12 or equivalent, and the minimum Selection Rank (from their academic qualifications, plus any adjustment factors) requirement for this program; and\n\nco-curricular or service requirement (applies to applicants who complete secondary education in the year prior to commencing at ANU); and\n\nEnglish language proficiency; and\n\nany program-specific requirements listed below.\n\nApplicants with higher education study are assessed on:\n\nprevious higher education studies; or secondary education results if completed less than one full-time equivalent year (1.0 FTE) of a degree; or the result from a bridging or preparatory course; and\n\nEnglish language proficiency; and\n\nany program-specific requirements listed below.\n\nApplicants with vocational education and training (VET) study are assessed on:\n\npreviously completed VET qualifications at AQF level 5 or higher (i.e. a Diploma or above); or secondary education results if the VET qualification is not completed; and\n\nEnglish language proficiency; and\n\nany program-specific requirements listed below.\n\nApplicants with work and life experience are assessed on:\n\nATAR or equivalent if secondary education was completed; or the Special Adult Entry Scheme (SAES); or work experience; and\n\nEnglish language proficiency; and\n\nany program-specific requirements listed below.\n\nInternational applicants\n\nApplicants who complete a recognised secondary/senior secondary/post-secondary/tertiary sequence of study will be assessed on the basis of an equivalent selection rank that is calculated upon application. A list of commonly observed international qualifications and corresponding admission requirements can be found here . Applicants must also meet any program specific requirements that are listed below.\n\nDiversity factors & English language proficiency\n\nAs Australia's national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe. If required, competitive ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of demonstrating higher-level English language proficiency.\n\nFurther information is available for English Language Requirements for Admission\n\nATAR:\n\n80\n\nInternational Baccalaureate:\n\n29\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAdjustment Factors\n\nAdjustment factors are additional points added to an applicant’s Selection Rank (for example an applicant’s ATAR). ANU offers adjustment factors based on performance and equity principles, such as for high achievement in nationally strategic senior secondary subjects and for recognition of difficult circumstances that students face in their studies.\n\nSelection Rank adjustments are granted in accordance with the approved schedules, and no more than 15 (maximum 5 subject/performance-based adjustment factors and maximum 10 equity-based adjustment factors) can be awarded.\n\nYou may be considered for adjustment factors if you have:\n\napplied for an eligible ANU Bachelor degree program\n\nundertaken Australian Year 12 or the International Baccalaureate\n\nachieved an ATAR or equivalent at or above 70\n\nnot previously attempted tertiary study.\n\nPlease visit the ANU Adjustment Factors website for further information.\n\nIndicative fees\n\nCommonwealth Supported Place (CSP)\n\nFor more information see: http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees\n\nAnnual indicative fee for international students\n\n$47,380.00\n\nFor further information on International Tuition Fees see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments/international-tuition-fees\n\nFee Information\n\nAll students are required to pay the Services and amenities fee (SA Fee)@\n\nThe annual indicative fee provides an estimate of the program tuition fees for international students and domestic students (where applicable). The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year. The tuition fees payable are dependent on the year of commencement and the courses selected and are subject to increase during the period of study.\n\nFor further information on Fees and Payment please see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments\n\nScholarships\n\nANU offers a wide range of scholarships to students to assist with the cost of their studies.@\n\nEligibility to apply for ANU scholarships varies depending on the specifics of the scholarship and can be categorised by the type of student you are. Specific scholarship application process information is included in the relevant scholarship listing.\n\nFor further information see the Scholarships website.\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts is the most diverse, most flexible, and most popular degree at The Australian National University.
