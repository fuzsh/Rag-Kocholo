        "text": "Arriving at an artist’s loft in Chinatown on Thursday night, I was first greeted by an elevator operator who quietly ushered me in and up to the third floor. Entering a spacious room full of women in striking prints, avant-garde floral displays in every color, and a samovar already brewing after-dinner tea, the celebratory atmosphere was fitting. The group of 20 or so people—and all of those flowers—were here to honor Nowruz, also known as Iranian or Persian New Year.\n\nBeginning every year on the first day of spring, and lasting for a full 13 days, the ancient holiday of Nowruz has been observed for thousands of years and is celebrated in many other countries across the Middle East; rooted in the Zoroastrian tradition of ancient Persia, it predates even the advent of Islam. As part of the festivities, Iranians create a table called a haft-sin with seven items (foods include wheatgrass, garlic, and vinegar) all beginning with the letter “S” in the Persian alphabet and symbolizing themes ranging from love to wealth to rebirth.\n\nUpon arrival, we gravitated towards the long table, where I struck up conversation with Nilou Motamed, the former editor-in-chief of Food & Wine, who had just returned from the Nowruz celebrations at the White House. She walked me through all the special elements of the haft-sin, pointing out the mirror, goldfish, fresh hyacinths, and the spice esfand which would later be burned to ward off the evil eye.\n\nAs Motamed was telling me about how haft-sin tables typically feature a book of poems—mystic poets Hafiz or Rumi are popular choices—the architect and activist Gisue Hariri arrived. In a long, tailored white coat with a beaded collar and Farsi calligraphy down the front, her hair was shorn in a striking gray buzzcut, a recent act of solidarity with the women of Iran still fighting for their freedom. The text on her coat—which she designed along with a team of artists in Iran whom she mentors—read “nothing,” after a Rumi poem.\n\n“Conversations about Iranian politics often overshadow the beauty of Iranian culture,” Clémence Polès, one of the organizers of the dinner, told me beforehand. “There isn’t as much visibility as to how lively, how much beauty, how much poetry there is.” For Polès, the purpose of the dinner was to show that “Iranians are hilarious, full of life, generous, colorful.”\n\nAs hosts, Polès—a photographer and founder of Passerby magazine—and the Tehran-born artist Sunny Shokrae began planning the dinner after running into each other at Women, Life, Freedom protests in New York. Ignited by the tragic death of Jina Mahsa Amini at the hands of the Iranian morality police for covering her hair “improperly,” when the movement began to gain momentum in the fall, it only brought the “previously fragmented” New York Iranian community closer together, Shokrae said. After Clemence and Sunny found themselves sitting next to each other at a dinner hosted by fellow Iranian New Yorker, chef Andy Baraghani, they decided to plan a Nowruz celebration to honor this spirit of companionship. “That [dinner] filled our cup,” Shokrae added. “Food is such a big part of socializing in Iranian culture.”\n\nFor their own celebration, the pair brought on chef Nasrin Rejali, who moved from Iran to New York in 2016 with her three children. Rejali, who runs her own catering company, cooks her grandmother’s traditional recipes—but with the occasional New York twist. She can’t get the same fish as in Iran from the Caspian Sea, she explained, but has found that local sea bass is quite similar; for this dinner, she chose arctic char. Also on the menu were stuffed grape leaves, Persian noodles, herb frittata, and yogurt with cardoons, while the cuisine’s characteristic freshness was achieved through zingy herbs ranging from tarragon, saffron, parsley, dill, and cilantro.\n\nNaturally, conversation at dinner soon turned to Iranian food in New York: from the portion sizes at Sofreh in Brooklyn, to the broader range of Persian food available in Los Angeles, to how every American Iranian household has copies of cookbook author Najmieh Batmanglij’s books. At that, Shyan Zakeri of Shy’s Burgers turned to me, asking: “Do you know the band Vampire Weekend? Najmieh Batmanglij is his mom!”\n\nAlmost as dazzling as the food, however, were the outfits. “People really go all out and wear their best look,” Clemence had mentioned before the dinner, and she wasn’t wrong. Directly across from me sat Pari Ehsan, the creative director behind Pari Dust, in florals and a frilled necklace, while a little further down sat stylist Alexis Badiyi in a long charcoal dress and her sister, Natasha, in a velvet brown wrap. I recognized both from Mina Alyeshmerni’s online store Maimoun, where I had sourced my own dress by Maryam Nassir Zadeh; I soon felt a little like the person wearing a band T-shirt to a concert, once I found myself sitting next to the Iranian-American designer herself.\n\nFashion is an equally important element of celebrating Nowruz, however, with the themes of rebirth and spring cleaning extending to clothing. It’s custom to wear an entirely new outfit (called lebāsé nō) to ring in the new year, while the intricate hairstyles on display included thick braids, crimped curls, and bleached eyebrows. Kate Assaraf, founder of the sustainable hair care line Dip, gave a toast highlighting a simple freedom that Iranian women are fighting for—to do what they wish with their hair.\n\nBefore we knew it, it was time for tea. Nilou explained to me earlier in the evening that, according to her family, the three principles of Persian tea are that it should be dark, bitter, and generously filled to the point of overflowing. (It’s considered rude to not fill a teacup all the way for a guest.) As the conversation turned to weightier topics, there was an overwhelming feeling of hope: hope for women in Iran, in neighboring Afghanistan, and even here in the United States where bodily rights and freedoms are being stripped away.\n\nOne element of Nowruz, called eidi, is the giving of gifts from elders to children. As a variation on this tradition, the hosts made a donation to the Artistic Freedom Initiative, which supports Iranian artists facing persecution. It served as a neat reflection of Polès and Shokrae’s celebration of this ancestral holiday, which both honored the traditions of Nowruz and gently modernized them: bringing together their chosen family, incorporating contemporary design, and sharing elements of their Iranian heritage in their own, playful style.\n\nSlowly, we finished the wine in our glass goblets—all covered in swirling, hand-dyed patterns by Kalen Kaminski, whose art studio served as the backdrop for the dinner. Iranian pop music echoed around the space from a playlist made by Nassir Zadeh’s brother, while people moved to the couches, taking their last bites of rose water-infused baklava. Servers refilled strong black tea into tiny cups that had been brewing in the samovar, and we passed trays of cookies around. Finally, Polès, Shokrae, and Kaminski sent guests home with bouquets of flowers—and, of course, wishes for a happy new year."
