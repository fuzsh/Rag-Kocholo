        "text": "Rey Vakili and Jonny Ingham met in London in 2017 through mutual friends, but didn’t start dating until she entered business school. “He was living in L.A. and I was at Stanford,” Rey—who is now the managing director of LTK Australia—remembers. “Somewhat fortuitously one of his best friends was at the law school, so it gave him the perfect excuse to come and visit Palo Alto regularly.” They dated long-distance for two years before moving to Sydney together at the end of 2019 just before COVID.\n\nThe two got engaged in May of 2022. “It was very relaxed and ‘very John,’” Rey says. “And, I can honestly say that in that moment I was not expecting it at all!” Rey was at home getting ready for dinner when Jonny returned home and proposed to her in the kitchen. “He sort of came charging at me with a box,” she laughs. “I had no idea what was happening at first, but then he got down on one knee. It was awkward, it was cute, it was perfect. We also have very different recollections of what actually went down. His version is a lot more cool, romantic, and collected. I just know that it happened, and it took place in my kitchen!”\n\nThey already had planned a weekend away to Magill Estate in Adelaide the next morning, and so beyond telling their immediate families, they kept the news to themselves for a few days and enjoyed a quiet weekend away together.\n\nThe couple began planning their wedding shortly thereafter. “Aussies like to have plenty of time to plan,” Rey explains. “So it was a courtesy we owed our guests.” Quickly, they decided they wanted to celebrate their nuptials in Italy—but that was the easy part. The hard part was trying to decide exactly where. Eventually, they settled on the picturesque town of Taormina in Sicily. “Taormina is a very special place for my family,” Rey says. “We have been going there on vacation for over a decade and both my sister and sister-in-law were married there too. Capri on the other hand is where John’s family have been going for years, and so we landed on something in the middle. A wedding in Taormina with a recovery party in Capri!”\n\nThe couple’s guests were making such a huge effort to travel from every corner of the world to be with them, and it was important to the couple that the mood was set from the moment they received their save the dates. “Sicily is such a special place,” Rey says. “The history, the food, the vineyards, the beaches, the people, and the ceramics. We wanted everyone to be excited from the moment they learned of the destination because I think deep down we wanted everyone to love it as much as we do.”\n\nIn the early stages of planning, they discovered Emérence of Potesta Designs, who created the save the dates and wedding website. She immediately understood what they were trying to achieve and created a magical, playful space for information that set the tone for what was to come. The couple also enlisted the incredibly talented illustrator Fin Fellowes who worked closely with them to create a suite of invitations for their wedding weekend and designed a logo for the event.\n\nThe couple had already planned a trip to Europe that summer—a month after their engagement—so the timing was perfect to start scouting for a venue. “At this point, I started talking to the team at Dolce & Gabbana, and they recommended I go see the San Domenico Palace in Taormina, which is where their first Alta Moda fashion show took place in 2012,” Rey remembers. “When we went in June, it had just recently reopened as the Four Seasons, and it was simply spectacular. As the Italians say, it was ‘amore a prima vista!’ The gardens were breathtakingly beautiful, and it was something different from what my family had done before me. Jonny loved it too. We basically locked it in there and then.”\n\nThe wedding took place before the second season of the popular HBO series The White Lotus, which was set at the resort, was released. “I’m not sure we would have had as much luck booking it had it been after!” Rey jokes. “When the show first came out, I was a little mortified to be doing it at the same place. I mean the opening scene is literally a dead hotel guest floating in the ocean. That said, by the time the wedding came around, we decided to just lean into the whole White Lotus thing. The song we entered our reception dinner to was ‘A Far L’Amore Comincia Tu,’ which is the theme song and everyone was losing their minds. In the end, the show was the best kind of teaser for guests, who were all dying to see the venue in real life.”\n\nRey knew from the get-go that she wanted to work with Diana from Sugokuii Events. “I have been a big fan of her work for as long as I can remember,” the bride explains. “I love her attention to detail, the spectacular tablescapes, the colors she uses, her creativity, but above all I love her respect for Italy and going local Italian in all the details. She did everything, from décor to logistics to florals. Unless you have done it before, there really is no way of knowing how much goes into planning a wedding and ensuring it all runs smoothly. We certainly didn’t. Probably for the best too, because I doubt we would have gone ahead with it all if we had!”\n\nFor Rey, Sicily and Dolce & Gabbana just go hand in hand. “Beyond the designers’ strong affinity with Sicily, no one understands a woman’s body like they do,” she says. “I love the way their clothes fit and flatter every shape and size. I love that every time I wear one of their pieces, I know it’s going to be a good night. I love that they have always felt so true to my own personal style.”\n\nAt the time, she didn’t know how she was going to make it happen, or if they even made wedding dresses, but she knew she had to ask. One of her best friends put her in touch with Giusy Cannizzaro, the brand’s head of haute couture, and that’s where it all began. “She and her team were a dream to work with,” Rey says. “We had an initial kick-off Zoom where we discussed all things wedding-related. I mentioned we were thinking of Taormina, and their enthusiasm was one of the factors that pushed us over the line. They suggested we go visit the San Domenico Palace on our next trip over.”\n\nAfter the call, Rey sent over inspiration from past Alta Moda shows and runway collections and provided details on the weekend and venue—but the first time she met the team was a few weeks later with her sister at the Alta Moda show in 2022. Fittingly, it took place across Noto and Syracuse in Sicily. When she arrived, the team had prepared a beautiful book for her, which included initial sketches, fabrics, and more inspiration, and the sketches soon took on two very distinct themes: La Dolce Vita, and Il Gattopardo.\n\n“When I saw the sketches inspired by Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) in Il Gattopardo I knew I had met ‘the one,’” Rey says. “From there, I had my measurements taken, and we pored through the different fabrics, shades of white, lace, and details. The experience was unforgettable and one I will cherish forever.”\n\nIt was so enjoyable, Rey asked if they could also create a dress for her welcome dinner, and then later, the recovery brunch. The next time she saw her wedding dress, however, wasn’t until January at the Milan atelier. “It’s hard to believe that after only one fitting—which was only to take measurements!—the dress fit like a glove,” Rey says. “During this fitting, we finalized finishing touches like shoes, details, the veil, and the headpieces I would wear on all three days.”\n\nFor the welcome dinner on Friday at Taormina’s newest restaurant Nunziatina, Dolce & Gabbana created a custom turquoise and pink mermaid gown. It was made from the carretto and bougainvillea print from a 2014 collection inspired by Taormina on a sunny day, with the bottom of the dress including a motif of the iconic Sicilian carretto wheel. The look was topped off with a crown of handmade silk bougainvillea flowers.\n\nThe ceremony took place on Saturday outside in the gardens of San Domenico Palace. It was short and sweet, but also intimate, full of love, and very meaningful. “We wanted our service to reflect both of us,” Rey says. “Our celebrant Luca was from Calabria, where Jonny’s maternal family is from, and we included elements of a traditional Persian ceremony to represent my family’s background.”\n\nRey and Jonny didn’t want anything to detract from the natural beauty of the landscape or the significance of the moment, so all the florals were designed to feel like an extension of the gardens. They wanted to complement the blue of the ocean and the purples of lavender and bougainvillea that were already in abundance so they used a mix of delphinium and campanula.\n\nThe bride wore her custom organza Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress with zagara detailing on the bodice and skirt when she walked down the aisle aisle full of cut delphinium petals, to Pachelbel’s “Canon in D” played by a violinist and a cellist. “I felt so at peace,” she remembers. “The happiest I have ever been in my entire life. I have spent so much time living abroad that I have always felt like a piece of my heart is missing. When I was living overseas, it was missing my family back home in Sydney, now that I’m back in Sydney, it is missing my best friends overseas. On this special day, my heart was so full and whole. I can’t describe how incredible it is to have every chapter of your life come together in one place and moment.”\n\nThe goal was for the mood to change from the moment the ceremony was over, so the Sicilian marching band Ciao Bella played during their exit and escorted guests into cocktails. Meanwhile, Rey and Jonny went to get their portraits done with their photographer Alex Bramall. “We made sure to have 15 minutes to ourselves just before dinner,” the bride remembers. “We went back to our suite, had a drink, and debriefed. It was a moment’s pause, and it was just so nice.”\n\nThe reception dinner was in the ancient cloisters, and when it came time, the newlyweds were escorted by the band to the entrance of the courtyard. “We could hear people cheering from behind the closed doors,” Rey remembers. The MC, Nick Pitt, knew how to get a crowd going, and DJ Fabio easily read the room. “From the moment we walked in everyone was up on their feet dancing,” Rey recalls. “It was exactly what we wanted to see.”\n\nFor the second half of the evening, Rey also went for a quick change into a more party-ready style. “At first, I thought I wanted to wear my wedding dress all night,” Rey remembers. “But about two weeks before the wedding, I had a mini freakout and decided my dance moves would be enhanced by a shorter dress. Patricia Voto of One/Of had reached out to me a few months earlier about creating a piece for me for something unrelated. I love her philosophy toward fashion and her unique pieces. I reached out to her two weeks before the wedding asking the impossible of her, and she was amazing. She created the most stunning mini set with feather and seashell detailing. It was made for Taormina, and it was made for dancing. I wore it with custom-painted Supergas which we had handed out to all of our guests for dancing, which were painted with our logo.”\n\nThere were moving speeches, and opera singers who appeared in and out of the tiny windows above the cloister and in the gardens, but the cake-cutting was the highlight of the night. “Unfortunately, one of John’s groomsmen thought it was a table and put his whole hand through it before we took a single photo!” Rey remembers.\n\nBefore dancing, the wedding planners handed out personalized hand-painted Supergas to all the ladies. “This was an absolute must for me!” Rey says. “I knew if people were comfortable, they would dance the night away.”\n\nFinally, at the stroke of midnight, the couple walked through town to a club that they had booked out for the late-night party. “And not just any club,” Rey says. “It is the nightclub in Taormina, Morgana Bar. The interiors are quintessentially Sicilian with a funky modern twist. We had late-night food served on custom plates that my friend and founder of In the Roundhouse Alyce Tran had created for us, pizza in custom-made boxes, and granita cocktails in endless supply. It all feels like a dream. It’s a wonderful feeling, knowing that even if you could turn the clock back you wouldn’t change a thing about something.”"
