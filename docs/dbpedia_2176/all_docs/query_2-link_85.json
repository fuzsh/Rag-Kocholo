        "text": "Public Enemy, a rap group whose disbandment had been announced by its record company in the wake of anti-Semitic statements by its designated ''minister of information,'' is ''back in action,'' according to a statement released by the group on Wednesday.\n\nPublic Enemy's third album, ''Fear of a Black Planet,'' is to appear this winter, and two of its three performing members - the rapper William (Flavor Flav) Drayton and the disk jockey Norman (Terminator X) Rogers - are also working on solo albums. Chuck D. Ridenhour is the group's songwriter and main rapper. One of Public Enemy's songs, ''Fight the Power,'' is on the soundtrack of Spike Lee's new film, ''Do the Right Thing,'' and a home video of the group, ''Fight the Power Live,'' has just been released.\n\nControversy around the band began after Richard Griffin, formerly Public Enemy's minister of information, said in an interview with The Washington Times: ''The Jews are wicked. And we can prove this.'' Mr. Griffin, who was known in the group as Professor Griff, also said that Jews are responsible for ''the majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe.'' Group Member Dismissed June 21\n\nAt a news conference on June 21, Mr. Ridenhour announced the dismissal of Mr. Griffin, who did not perform or write songs but appeared on stage with the band as a member of the group's uniformed ''security force.'' A few days later, Public Enemy's disbandment was announced by its record company, Def Jam."
