Their other hit singles include \"Move Your Body\" and \"Too Much of Heaven\", all of which appeared on their album Europop, released in late 1999.\n\nThe name \"Eiffel\" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the \"65\" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake: it was actually part of a phone number.\n\n​\n\nEiffel 65 achieved considerable success in Italy, the rest of Europe, United States, and Canada. Europop peaked in the top five on the Billboard 200, was at the top of the MuchMusic countdown, and sold over two million units. \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\", on the other hand, peaked at #6 on the Billboard charts and is featured in several Hollywood productions (Iron Man 3, Smallfoot, Smurfs: The Lost Village, etc).\n\n​\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n\n- \"Europop\" (2000)\n\n- \"Contact!\" (2001)\n\n- \"Eiffel 65\" (2003)\n\n​\n\nThe band is currently still touring all around the world performing in the main dance clubs and live festivals.\n\nGabry Ponte is an Italian DJ, remixer, record producer and radio personality, best known for his membership in the Italian dance group Eiffel 65.\n\nWith Eiffel 65's rise to fame in the late '90s, his celebrity status was established.
