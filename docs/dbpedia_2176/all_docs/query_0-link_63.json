Read more about this in our examples of interview questions. You can find literary resources on our Great Writers Inspire site. You may also like to look at literary websites and listen to radio programs such as BBC Radio 4's 'In Our Time'.\n\nPlease visit the guidance on the FAQs section of the Modern Languages faculty website under the heading 'How best to prepare for the entrance procedure'.

To find such material, you might want to follow up on references made in your school or college text books, or your History teacher may also be able to recommend particular works for you to read on topics that you find most interesting.\n\nOne good way of broadening your historical horizons is to read one of the popular History magazines: History Today or BBC History, which has weekly podcasts. You may like to look at the books which are being reviewed in the quality press.\n\nYou may also like to explore the websites of public institutions which have excellent links to historical materials, such as the British Museum or BBC Radio 4 archives.\n\nLastly, delving into some historical sources can be a great way to develop your ideas and understanding. You could try exploring literature, art, music or even films produced by different societies, and consider what these can tell us about the people of that time.\n\nAn indispensable introduction to economic analysis, both for those who have not studied it at school and for those who have is ‘The Economist’ or the Economics pages of newspapers. Paul Krugman’s writings are highly recommended. Begg, Fischer and Dornbusch’s ‘Economics’ is one of the introductory textbooks widely used at Oxford.\n\nOxford research:\n\nLooking back to understand the recent economic crisis\n\nHelping the UK understand China\n\nThe value of mutuality\n\nGeometry to the rescue\n\nThe surprising uses of auctions video\n\nHistory and English\n\nHistory and Modern Languages\n\nHistory and Politics\n\nHistory of Art\n\nHuman Sciences\n\nLaw\n\nMaterials Science\n\nMathematics\n\nMathematics and Computer Science\n\nMathematics and Philosophy\n\nMathematics and Statistics\n\nMedicine\n\nModern Languages\n\nModern Languages and Linguistics\n\nMusic\n\nAsian and Middle Eastern Studies\n\nPhilosophy and Modern Languages\n\nPhilosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE)\n\nPhilosophy and Theology\n\nPhysics\n\nPhysics and Philosophy\n\nPsychology, Philosophy and Linguistics (PPL)\n\nReligion and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies\n\nTheology and Religion"
