        "text": "The Alternative Eurovision Second Chance Song Contest 27 was the 6th edition of the Alternative Eurovision Second Chance Song Contest. The contest was held in Monaco , following the country's victory in the fifth edition with the song \"Twenty Years\" by SURE. It was the first time that Monaco hosted the contest. The live show was hosted by Shanguy in the Opéra de Monte-Carlo.\n\nThe aim of the competition is to give artists who failed to win national selections a second chance and to give them a chance to feel the atmosphere of the main contest. The 6th edition of Second Chance allowed participants who didn't win their respective national finals in #27 to compete.\n\nVenue - Opéra de Monte-Carlo[]\n\nThe Opéra de Monte-Carlo is an opera house which is part of the Monte Carlo Casino located in the Principality of Monaco.\n\nWith the lack of cultural diversions available in Monaco in the 1870s, Prince Charles III, along with the Société des bains de mer, decided to include a concert hall as part of the casino. The main public entrance to the hall was from the casino, while Charles III's private entrance was on the western side. It opened in 1879 and became known as the Salle Garnier, after the architect Charles Garnier, who designed it.\n\nDuring the renovation of the Salle Garnier in 2004–05, the company presented operas at the Salle des Princes in the local Grimaldi Forum, a modern conference and performance facility where Les Ballets de Monte Carlo and the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra regularly perform.\n\nHost - Shanguy[]\n\nShanguy was formed in 2017 and consists of Italian DJ NRD1, French songwriters Eon Melka and Robert Cigona (of Italian origin). Singing mainly in French, they toured throughout Europe. The group has also achieved success on the Spotify and iTunes charts in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and Hungary.\n\nIn 2017, their title La Louze was their first success, with more than 30 million views on web platforms and their first platinum disc. The following year, King of the Jungle repeated the feat, with 65 million views on YouTube and a gold disc. The group then teamed up with the Italian-Moroccan singer Shady to produce the new hit Toukassé. Then in 2019, Désolée (Paris/Paname) (still with Shady, and on lyrics by Niki Demiller), which ranked first in several countries, was certified double platinum globally with over 16 million views on YouTube. In 2020, the group continues its collaboration with singer Shady for the title Back to Life. In November 2020, they released the single Dalida in collaboration with DJ duo Marnik. On 26 February 2021, they released their latest single Kalima Minou with producer and DJ Mark Neve.\n\nResults[]"
