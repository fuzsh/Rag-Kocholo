        "text": "This paper sheds new light on the developments in Italian jazz in the two decades 1960-1980. It opens by touching on context and antecedents: the relationships with Italian musical traditions in early American jazz, the acceptance and refusal of jazz by Italian cultural institutions and movements before 1960, and the late &#39;50s key developments both in jazz and arts/media. In the early &#39;60s, Italian jazz was characterized by two small scenes with marked differences in Rome and Milan and with a few further relevant events. An active and well rooted specialist magazine (Musica Jazz) provides relatively good documentation on these beginnings, quite detached from other general movements in music. By the end of the decade several ideological, cultural, political ruptures will have changed this panorama, and while Italian jazz was active in these changes, its exponents also had to deal with the complex situation they created from the point of view of artistic challenges, working co...\n\nThe mission of this essay is to treat cultural transfer in jazz as an example of complex influences caused through migration and forced migration, starting from my book Storia del jazz: una prospettiva globale [The History of jazz in a global perspective], an attempt to renew a field of study, the history of jazz, which in Italy has been at a standstill for many years. The essay will show how jazz evolved from such complex transfer and how complex transfer is still in place in more recent developments of the music due to its productive nature, which asks whoever plays it to put his own soul into it as well as refer to the traditions of jazz. What interests us here is to understand the interaction of cultural forces that produced a new music, which, moreover, was immediately perceived by contemporaries as something devastating and innovative (and in certain respects opposed to this).\n\nOther authors include the editors, Vincent Cotro, Rainer E. Lotz, Alyn Shipton, Ekkehard Jost, Tony Whyton. \"It is often said that jazz is America's great gift to the world, but while true, this belies the surprising, often crucial role that Europe has played in the development and popularity of jazz throughout the world. Based on a series of symposia attracting leading scholars, critics, and musicians from throughout Europe and the United States, Eurojazzland first addresses the impact of European musical traditions and instruments on the formation and development of American jazz. Part two details the vital experiences of American musicians on European soil, from black minstrels to such jazz greats as Benny Carter and Duke Ellington, and deals with European jazzmen and their developments of American jazz styles. The final part chronicles the importance of European critics and musicologists in jazz criticism and offers essays on European contributions to jazz musicianship and production. Eurojazzland proves that jazz is simply too rich and varied for one country to claim, define, or contain. This groundbreaking collection will appeal to jazz aficionados, scholars, musicologists, and musicians.\"\n\nFollowing popular exposure in France to the proto-jazz of James Reese Europe and his 369th “Harlem Hellfighters” Infantry Regiment during the latter years of WW1, the jazz bug took hold and, in the period that followed, spread throughout Europe. This new mu- sic from the USA, drawing on the ethno-cultural melting pot of New Orleans, provided a soundtrack to the new order that was forged following the two world wars. Its spread marked the beginning of Europe’s complex relationship to jazz, a music associated vari- ously with exoticism, vice, youth, cultural decay, liberation, US imperialism, civil rights, nuclear disarmament, and intellectual elitism. During the past century, the cultural status of jazz has gone from popular to specialist, from entertainment to art, and in Europe, from an imported to an appropriated and repur- posed music form. The initial eagerness by European musicians to emulate the American founding fathers of jazz has over time given way to national and regional reinterpretations of the genre. Examples of emergent European sensibilities in jazz creation and perfor- mance can be heard in the German free scene of the 1960s, and the “Nordic tone” as- sociated with the ECM label in the 1970s. These departures from the genre’s American narrative, traditionally so intrinsically intertwined in its understanding, have necessitated the revisiting of the ontology of jazz in its post-globalisation context. Continental Drift: 50 years of jazz from Europe took place in Edinburgh, Scotland on the 16th and 17th of July, 2016. A co-production between Edinburgh Napier University and the Edinburgh Jazz & Blues Festival, the conference was conceived to reflect the fes- tival’s theme, a celebration of fifty years of European jazz. The notion of European jazz as divergently distinct from the genre’s American conception constituted the basis for inves- tigation through a series of panel sessions. v vi INTRODUCTION The conference welcomed eminent panellists and presenters from across Europe and the United States drawn from academia, creative practice, and industry to interrogate and unpack the origin story, development, and emerging practices of jazz from Europe. The proceedings opened with ECM recording artist Marcin Wasilewski in interview with Haftor Medbøe as an introduction to the four themed panel sessions respectively titled “People and Histories”, “Places and Events”, Scenes and Networks”, and “Futures”. The chaired sessions probed themes of provenance, authenticity, hybridity, and innovation as applied to Europe’s contribution to the global jazz scene. Video and podcast legacies of these panel sessions are available from the conference website: www.continentaldriftconference.co.uk On each day the conference gave the floor to contributors on a variety of specialist top- ics. These took the form of 20X20 slide presentations and provided the basis for lively audience discussions. The conference organisers subsequently invited contributors to ex- pand on their presentations, and the resulting papers are collated in this publication.\n\nMusic is mobile. It can be played and repeated several times in several places, it can be recorded in the personal memory, in music books and mobile mp3 players, thus people may take it along wherever they want. In comparison to other cultural goods which establish group and personal identities, in migration processes, music is an outstandingly suitable item to be transferred as a marker of identity itself. Thus, the quality of musical identity construction is, as Simon Frith pointed out, mobile, dynamic, processual, performative, and not correlated with predefined borders. It is object to continuous renegotiation, in which music performative supply is of importance. Certainly, the interrelationship between music and migration is anything but arbitrary. In the case of professional music migration, people follow the demand for music; in mass migration, groups of people carry along repertoires they know as parts both of their personal memory and identity concept; in forced exile situations, musicians and other people who are professionally involved with music may unfold their concept of musical activity in completely different environments. In this perspective written by the co-editor of the book Nils Grosch this paper analyzes some methodological approaches regarding the Italian diaspora in North America"
