        "text": "In our information-rich world, students and faculty can easily find a wealth of content through a wide range of discovery tools, often bypassing the library entirely or only coming back to the library inadvertently as the result of a successful search. The 2015 Horizon Library report has continued to identify this \"Competition from Alternative Avenues of Discovery\" as a difficult challenge. Libraries can either cede their traditional role in facilitating discovery or can embrace the potential of these new tools. Building on a session at this year's ER&L Conference, this session will explore how libraries can broaden their approach to discovery by enhancing single-search discovery services to better compete with other tools while simultaneously embracing the potential of new tools and technology to allow users a range of discovery options. This program will explore ways in which library discovery services can be optimized to provide easy access to owned, subscribed, and curated content, whatever the source; how a publishers can study usage patterns to maximize discovery and access; and how libraries can take advantage of innovative new tools and approaches to discovery.\n\nWhile Linked Data is growing in interest in the library and publishing communities, its evolution and adoption is widespread in many industries. Academic libraries and vendors alike have numerous data silos, incapable of communicating effectively with other repositories and/or the broader web. The library community is rife with outdated business models, in part due to data formats and limitations. New ecosystems and integrations will be borne out of transforming these data silos into the broader and more accessible web of data.\n\nBIBFRAME is the planned replacement for MARC, and while the framework is being evolved in working groups such as LD4P and LC, organizations are already beginning to experiment and deploy new business models around it. Casalini Libri will share their foray into delivering BIBFRAME resources in addition to MARC records for customers. The transformation has begun.\n\nThe Library.Link Network brings together libraries and their providers to inform the Web of their detailed, vetted and authoritative data about art, music, books/ebooks, special collections and more. MARC records are transformed into BIBFRAME resources, assets linked, and then published in a variety of vocabularies to the web for search engines and other applications to consume. Users finding library resources on the web or other applications can be driven to the institution’s discovery layer for authentication and fulfillment.\n\nDue to the highly structured data in the library and publisher worlds, these organizations are well positioned to leverage existing data into the BIBFRAME and/or Linked Data realm.\n\nThese short “pecha kucha-like” sessions will feature 5 PowerPoint presentations of 6 minutes and 40 seconds each. We will have time at the end of the session intended for Q&A for all presenters. Come for a lively, rapid-fire group of talks.\n\n1. Usage Analysis of Print Serials: Are They Worth the Investment? (Rob Kairis)\n\nAlthough part of a larger 8-campus university library system and a member of OhioLINK, a large consortium of academic libraries in Ohio, the Stark Campus Library of Kent State University maintains a modest collection of print serial subscriptions. The library has analyzed usage of both current and bound issues for many years. Cost per use analysis for each subscription suggests the overall collection is not worth the investment. The presentation will include a description of how usage of the collection is collected and measured. Participants are encouraged to share their experiences as more and more content becomes available electronically. Staffing issues (the library's Serials Librarian retired last year and was not replaced) along with political challenges will also be introduced; The Stark Campus contracts for library services with a collocated community college and manages its print serials collection. Due to the need for more classroom space on campus, print serials have been impacted more than any other library collection, making the storage of print serials an on-going problem. Alternate methods to maintaining a print serials collection, such as an online-only collection or sole reliance on on-demand document delivery, will be discussed. Based on conclusions drawn from this analysis, a comprehensive new model for continuing to subscribe to print serials will be introduced.\n\n2. Faculty Are Doin' It for Themselves: Librarians Show Them How (CJ Ivory)\n\nThe battle over textbook affordability continues to be waged on college campuses across the nation and in state legislatures. Florida has even passed legislation requiring colleges and universities to reduce the costs of textbooks. University of Central Florida College of Business preemptively introduced the new Integrated Business program. This new program has nine core classes that uses a flipped classroom approach. One of the mandates of the program is to develop a curriculum with minimal additional costs to the students. The solution was to design courses without using traditional textbooks as the basis for the curriculum. I saw this as an opportunity to market library resources and promote our new role as course content curators. I worked with faculty to integrate library resources as they developed new courses. After two semesters of instruction, I surveyed the faculty to learn how satisfied they were with the available resources and how I can improve my services as content curator for their courses. During this presentation, I will share the results of the survey and provide tips on how to help faculty build courses that are rigorous as well as affordable using library resources. I will also discuss how this new role has affected my choices as a subject selector.\n\n3. The 5 C's Related to Rolling Out an Effective Scientific Authoring & Publishing Platform: Collaboration, Creativity, Customization, Centralization, & Compliance (Shelly Miller)\n\nToday’s global collaborative scientific research developments offer libraries the opportunity to create a scientific authoring and publishing platform that reflects the nature and needs of the campus community. To effectively support authorship best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing, this presentation aims to inspire collaboration and offer insight regarding the challenges and opportunities encountered by libraries as they work to roll out new technologies and solutions that support, accelerate and improve the quality of research publications while minimizing the management footprint.\n\nThe Caltech Library has responded to such challenges and opportunities with an ‘Author Carpentry’ initiative that provides customized, centralized access to authoring tools and services, high quality training and user support for their researchers, students, faculty and staff. Overleaf has collaborated with The Caltech Library to develop a customized LaTeX scientific authoring portal that supports the entire campus community and is an essential component of the Caltech Author Carpentry program. This presentation will highlight the main components of an effective roll-out and current use of the innovative Overleaf-Caltech scientific authoring portal, including: easy sign-up, teaching tools, enhanced thesis templates with Caltech-approved information, featured journal templates and real-time administrative dashboard for the library to monitor data and analytics.\n\n4. Scholars Trust Cooperative Journal Retention Update (Lars Meyer)\n\nThe Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL) launched its shared print journal program in 2010 with 15 libraries participating. In January 2013, the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC) signed an agreement to combine their print journal archives with ASERL under a single retention and access agreement called \"Scholars Trust.\" The Florida Academic Repository (FLARE), a statewide shared collection, is also now participating in the program. A total of 38 libraries are contributing content to Scholars Trust for a combined collection of circa 20,000 unique ISSNs representing over 300,000 volumes. The participating libraries and consortia are collaborating to maintain legacy print collections into the future, allowing for the possibility of deduplicating local collections. I will provide an overview of governance and participation; benefits to libraries, including a priority reciprocal ILL program; libraries' use of the Journal Retention and Needs Listing (JRNL) database and Local Holdings Records to share information, especially for identifying gaps; and how Scholars Trust relates to similar print preservation efforts in North America, such as the CIC Shared Print Repository and the Western Regional Storage Trust. I will conclude with some thoughts about why libraries should consider participating in consortial print preservation efforts.\n\nThere is an old African saying: “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.” The Smathers Libraries at the University of Florida (UF) are active participants in a number of collaborative collection development initiatives that provide significant benefits to us, to our partners, and to others who benefit from the results of our efforts. Each of these initiatives requires a significant effort to establish and sustain trust and to maintain the value to the collaborators. Each step often takes longer to plan and to execute because a number of people have to be consulted and have their preferences and concerns addressed. But UF continues to invest in these initiatives and to seek additional opportunities for deep collaboration, because in the end, they take us much farther than we can go alone.\n\nExamples of these collaborations, and the details that challenged us, include the ASERL Collaborative Federal Depository Program; the Digital Library of the Carribean (dLOC); the Florida Academic Repository (FLARE) and Scholar’s Trust, two shared print archiving projects in which Florida has a lead or significant role; a somewhat controversial collaboration with Elsevier, recently expended to include other publishers through CHORUS; and a new partnership with the Biblioteca Nacional “José Martí” de Cuba, (BNJM) to establish a Cuban Heritage collection for worldwide public access by collaborating with other research libraries to digitize monographs, journals, newspapers, and government documents from and about Cuba produced primarily before the 20th Century.\n\nThis poster session will outline the strategy Connecticut College librarians used in an attempt to secure funds to offset inflationary cost increases for serials and e-resources and the strategy used to eliminate subscriptions when that request for funding was denied. One half of the poster, \"Failure,\" will share the activities and data used to educate the College community about the crisis in the materials budget and to convince budget planners that additional funds were needed to prevent the elimination of resources.\n\nAs new funds were not forthcoming, the second half of the poster, \"Success,\" will share the process used for faculty and library staff to determine together which resources would be eliminated and thus ensure the retention of more important titles. The Collections Advisory Task Force, including faculty with a history of heavy library use and librarians, identified $100,000 worth of titles for elimination. The Task Force meetings, though initially contentious, were effective in establishing process and trust, and eventually members agreed on titles for cancellation. The list was presented to the College faculty in May 2016.\n\nThis poster session will be of interest to those who face the same kind of pressure to reduce subscriptions due to flat or decreasing materials budgets. Others will find interesting the strategies to convince campus stakeholders of the problem, and to manage the situation when funding is not approved. We hope viewers will come away with insight to improve their own strategies to secure funding or, alternatively, manage subscription elimination decisions effectively.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of roll with the times, I propose a panel session describing the need to move the library by bringing library resources, and access to a librarian, into course management systems. I propose a panel session format. A community college librarian will speak on her experience as an embedded librarian, the creator of a one credit online course on information literacy, and marketing library resources in the CMS. A representative from Gale will speak on how to promote and market the library’s online resources in the CMS. A university librarian will speak on creating an online community in Blackboard and mention an online site that integrates library instruction materials into Canvas courses. Topics discussed will include LibGuides, links to streaming video collections, embedded librarian programs, creating online courses on information literacy, and developing a suite of online information literacy modules. The audience will be asked to share examples of ways they move the library’s resources to students. Participants will be asked to share responses to various questions via texting to an online poll.\n\nCreating a good user experience for our end users (students, researchers, etc.) is important to librarians, publishers, and other vendors in academic publishing; we want the content and products we provide to be used and useful. Site redesigns are a great opportunity to better address user needs because of all the information we have about how people are actually using a site, what people find confusing, and what goals aren't being accomplished.\n\nThis session will discuss user research in site redesigns and include case studies of using user research to better meet user needs. These will include the Indiana University Libraries' homepage redesign and the SAGE Research Methods redesign. Speakers will share:\n\nThe research undertaken and key findings, including a range of techniques for user research and applying user centered design principles\n\nThe top challenges the teams were hoping to solve with the redesigns\n\nThe new design and how it responded to the challenges\n\nAfter launch - What seems to have worked and not worked\n\nAttendees will leave the session with several examples of user research and ways to make their next redesign project more user-centered. Presenters will also share key outcomes from their research that are applicable across different sites and products."
