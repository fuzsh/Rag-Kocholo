        "text": "Human Consicousness\n\n2007 - 2012\n\nNeural Engineering Specialty\n\nLearn more\n\nAs a teenager I started to seek a deeper understanding of what makes us human and how we can lead lives of personal growth.\n\nI therefore embarked on a quest to explore our mind and body from the perspective of electrical impulses and emerging behavior, which led to a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering specialized in Biomedical and Neural Engineering from CUÂ Boulder.\n\nHuman Development\n\n2011 - 2012\n\nCo-Founded Skills Marketplace\n\nDuring my time in college, I co-founded a marketplace to enable individuals to monetize and build skills in a modular way instead of the traditional \"4 year degree\" approach. We wanted to provide an alternative to the stagnation most adults face in their intellectual development.\n\nPursuing this venture provided me with substantial insights into go-to-market strategies and building marketplaces.\n\nLearn more\n\nHuman Life Services\n\n2012 - 2018\n\nSmart Cities CIO\n\nAs I reflected on what I wanted to work on, I realized how life these days is stressful and expensive and how governments aren't being able to solve a lot of the problems they're meant to address.\n\nBecause of this I joined one of the world's biggest real estate developments as it's CIO. Here we built \"life as a service\" â focusing on providing maximum quality of life at minimal costs.\n\nIÂ learned about every conceivable type of personal data, scrutinizing wether technology is truly solving human issues, and the importance of respecting data privacy.\n\nLearn more\n\nHuman Health Insights\n\n2013 - 2016\n\nCo-Founded Bioinformatics Startup\n\nDuring my time in Mexico, we got frustrated by the limited focus on disease prevention. This led to the creation of Abraxas Biosystems. While it became one of the leading bioinformatics companies in Mexico, due to long sales cycles it evolved into Abraxas Ventures.\n\nThis experience proved foundational to my understanding of healthcare data, insights and patient care.\n\nLearn more\n\nHuman Empowerment\n\n2019 - 2020\n\nPeople Analytics CPO\n\nDuring my tenure as CIO I realized that while using leading tools and optimizing processes was essential to our mission, attracting and managing Â talent was the third and most important part of achieving our goals. I therefore focused my efforts towards becoming the Chief People Officer (CPO) of +800 employees.\n\nAs CPO I was able to recruit and reallocate talent, improve our internal processes and build our people analytics to assist employees in mapping the diverse aspects of their lives â improving happiness, retention, performance, and growth.\n\nLearn more\n\nHuman Assistant\n\n2021 - present\n\nFounded Waffle\n\nWaffle is being developed as a focused space and assistant for self discovery and personal growth.\n\nInspired by RPG-Games, Waffle will help us thrive when we face challenges and nurture our hobbies. It will do so by carving out a safe digital space to dive deeper into ourselves and by surfacing the personalized content, products and experiences that will help us \"level up\" in real life.\n\nWe are convinced there's nothing more important than helping people obtain focus, companionship and meaning. We're starting with early parenting, and moving on to other life stages in the coming years."
