        "text": "Kim G C Moody FCA, TEP, is a Chartered Accountant, Registered Trust and Estate Practitioner and a tax specialist practicing in Calgary as the CEO / Director Canadian Tax Advisory with Moodys Private Client Law LLP / Moodys Private Client LLP and Moodys Tax (a division of Moodys Private Client Law LLP).\n\nKim also recently branched out through his professional corporation to put more energy into some of his “passion projects” involving public speaking, coaching, leadership studies, taxation policy and economics / public policy.\n\nHis main area of expertise is tax and estate planning for the owner-manager of private corporations, executives, professional athletes, and other high net worth individuals. Kim obtained his Bachelor of Management degree from The University of Lethbridge in 1992 and his CA designation from The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta in 1994.\n\nThe antithesis of the status quo, Kim is driven to innovate new and better ways to do things for the clients he serves and other professionals in tax. His relentless obsession with getting to know everything in the Tax Act makes him a highly sought-out resource for peers and clients. In March 2020, Kim published his first book, Making Life Less Taxing: Pay Attention To Your Taxes So You Can Pay Less Tax and Build a Strong, Smarter Canada – an Amazon bestseller in a number of categories.\n\nKim is a Past Chair and Past Deputy Chair of the Board, Past Treasurer, as well as Past Chair of the Technical Committee for the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners of Canada (“STEP”). In addition, Kim is a past Chair of the Board of Governors for the Canadian Tax Foundation. He is also a member and past Co-Chair of the CBA/CPA Canada Joint Committee on Taxation. Kim is a co-founder of the Tax Specialist Group – an association of tax specialist firms across Canada founded in 1999.\n\nKim is a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012), the Business in Calgary 2012 Leader of Tomorrow Award, and in 2013 was conferred the Fellow of the Chartered Accountants of Alberta designation. He is also a recipient of the STEP Founders Award for Outstanding Achievement which was conferred in 2013. Kim participates on many non-profit / charitable boards to ensure that his experience can advance the causes of the organizations that are important to him. For example, in 2021, he was one of the co-founders of a new think-tank – The Aristotle Foundation – and was installed as its original Chair and he continues to serve in that position today.\n\nDeciding years ago that sleep was highly overrated, Kim makes time to share his immense knowledge through writing, lecturing, teaching, and being an active, national leader in the tax profession. In 2016, he fulfilled his long-standing goal of receiving admission into law school but his busy schedule made him realize that completing law school might have to be in his next life. Kim’s unique ability is being a loyal, transparent, and honest intellectual rebel who always does the right thing. His passion to lead, teach, never settle, and both seek and speak the truth aid in his contributions to the tax landscape. Kim desires to be an inspirational example for those around him to continuously grow.\n\nKim is married to Vivian and they have four sons – Alexander, Lucas, Jacob and Benjamin.\n\nTim Dunnigan, a retired U.S. Army Infantry Officer and accomplished technology entrepreneur, is the CEO & President of MMS Products, Inc., a defense technology solutions provider. He is also the Founder of CaptureTec, LLC, a defense consultancy group focused on supporting Warfighters through leadership and innovation. As COO and Co-founder of Talon Aerolytics, Tim led the development of the nation’s largest aerial drone services provider, expanding operations to all 50 states and facilitating digital data collection with AI analysis for national critical infrastructure.\n\nAs CEO and Founder of Strategic Integration, LLC, Tim developed and operated the CTED (Create, Test, Educate, Deploy) turnkey business model for defense consulting and technology integration. He has served America’s security interests abroad through multiple classified (TS/SCI) contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense. Additionally, as the Founder of iK9, LLC (CVE SDVOSB), Tim co-authored the Veterans Administration’s (VA) training protocols for service dogs provided to Military Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n\nMr. Dunnigan is a Corporate Advisor with Integrated Defense Accelerator, Founder of the I’m a Hero Too Foundation [501(c)(3)], and a children’s book author. He holds an active Top Secret security clearance and is currently a Doctoral Student researching leadership efficacy in decision-making with regard to drone usage, where AI and machine autonomy are considered. Tim has been awarded six patents and has two patents pending for an aerial drone delivery system he developed to address capability gaps he witnessed during his multiple humanitarian trips to Ukraine."
