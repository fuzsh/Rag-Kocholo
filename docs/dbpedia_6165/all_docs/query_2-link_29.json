        "text": "What Does CEMS Stand For?\n\nToday, CEMS is widely referred to by its acronym alone. But behind the organization’s name is a rich history.\n\nCEMS—the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies—was founded in 1988. As partner schools and companies expanded beyond Europe, the organization became known as the Global Alliance in Management Education.\n\nThe CEMS name is still widely recognized around the globe, so the acronym remains in use, especially when referring to the CEMS Master in International Management (MIM).\n\nThe CEMS Exchange: Study and Intern Abroad\n\nThe chance to study abroad—and intern—as a global management master’s student is perhaps one of the most attractive aspects of earning a CEMS Master in International Management (MIM). When you spend a semester (or more) at one of our partner schools, you will:\n\nHone your language and communication skills.\n\nBoost your cultural competency and self-awareness.\n\nInteract with classmates, faculty, and corporate partners.\n\nExperience academic life on an international college campus.\n\nExplore international points of interest and enjoy the local cuisine.\n\nMake important professional connections and lasting friendships.\n\nOur Academic Director: Meet Professor Stephen Shu\n\n“Cornell takes great pride in being the sole US academic member of the esteemed CEMS school network. We are honored to contribute to the cultivation of the next generation of global leaders who are committed to enhancing both societal well-being and business excellence.” —Stephen Shu\n\nAs a CEMS student, you’ll have close interaction with your faculty members, including Shu, who has a PhD in behavioral finance from City University of London, an MBA from the University of Chicago, and bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from Cornell University. He has more than three decades of industry experience and is perhaps most recognized for helping to incubate some of the first behavioral economics initiatives around the world in the commercial sector. Prior to his work in behavioral economics, he ran the global carrier business consulting practice for Nortel and worked as a management consultant at PRTM, which was acquired by PwC.\n\nIf you’re a curious, ambitious global citizen with an undergraduate background in business (such as a business minor) and meet all of the other admissions criteria for the MPS in Applied Economics and Management degree program, you might also be a good fit for the CEMS MIM.\n\nTo apply, you’ll need to complete your application for admission, submit a video interview and letters of recommendation, and rank the international schools for your study abroad placement. We look forward to learning more about your career goals—and how a MIM degree will help you reach them.\n\nThe tuition rate for the 2023-24 academic year is $32,602 per semester, and most students complete the MPS in Applied Economics and Management with the CEMS MIM in three semesters.\n\nMPS in AEM students typically fund their tuition and expenses with a combination of federal and private student loans and other financial aid options. For more information on tuition and the costs of attendance, see the Cornell Graduate School page on costs and funding."
