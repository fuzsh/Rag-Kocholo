        "text": "\"If Ralph Lauren is the voice of the indoors, Timberland is the voice of the outdoors,\" said Jeffery B. Swartz, who was recently named chief operating officer of the Timberland Company, the footwear and apparel company founded by his grandfather in 1973.\n\nIn announcing the appointment, Mr. Swartz's father, Sidney W. Swartz, the chief executive and president of Timberland, said his son had been vital to the company's growth since he joined Timberland six years ago. Mr. Swartz will be in charge of manufacturing and domestic and international sales.\n\nTimberland's sales grew to $196.3 million last year from $84 million in 1986. About 40 percent of sales are from stores overseas. The company recently opened stores in Japan and Italy, and the company anticipates sales of more than $220 million this year. It makes boots, shoes and jackets, as well as leather handbags, wallets and datebooks.\n\nTimberland has five domestic stores, including one on Madison Avenue at East 63d Street in Manhattan and owns or operates more than 20 abroad. Why would you need waterproof boots in Hong Kong? Jeffrey Swartz said: \"You don't. But everyone aspires to possess the elements of the outdoors.\"\n\nWith \"wind, water, earth and sky\" as part of their logo, Mr. Swartz said, Timberland appeals to people's desire to be a part of the outdoors and has grown in tandem with the environmental movement. Offering what sounds like mix of new age philosophy and homespun values, Mr. Swartz said Timberland products were built to last and to reflect \"core emotional values.\"\n\nAfter receiving his M.B.A. from Dartmouth in 1984, Mr. Swartz, joined PRTM, a New Hampshire consulting firm to high-technology manufacturers. He then became a manager with the Lotus Development Corporation before joining Timberland in 1986. He has been executive vice president, general manager of international business and director of operations."
