        "text": "Student Opportunities with Clemson Athletics\n\nThe Clemson University Athletic Department (CUAD) strives to grow people and community by creating life-changing experiences through Athletics. In alignment with the University’s bold strategic goal to enhance the #1 student experience, the CUAD provides numerous opportunities each year for students who are looking for experiential learning opportunities and/or are aspiring to be sports professionals. Being a part of the CUAD gives students the opportunity to work alongside some of the finest full-time professionals in the business, build relationships with other students with similar interests and aspirations, and experience defining moments in their lives and in the history of Clemson University.\n\nWhat types of student opportunities does the CUAD offer?\n\nOpportunities to participate as student-athletes are well documented and understood. Other opportunities for students to participate in the Clemson University Athletics Department (CUAD), however, are not as clear. Similar to student-athletes, others students participating in the CUAD are under the direction of and receive instruction from a full-time staff member.\n\nOutside of being a Student-Athlete and/or a fan, the CUAD offers 3 different types of opportunities for Clemson students to participate within the department and enhance their collegiate experience:\n\nStudent-Internships: These are volunteer positions designed to enable students to complete degree requirements and/or develop an initial behind the scenes understanding of operations with the CUAD. It is expected that Student-Interns are first and foremost successful students.
