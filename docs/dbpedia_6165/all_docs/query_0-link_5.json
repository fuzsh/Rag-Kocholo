These are some of the experiences that make Warnell so special, but our students have access to events, clubs, and other programs throughout the year that help them connect to friends and potential employers in the future. Here are a few ways Warnell is special.",

        "text": "Every fall, Warnell hosts an orientation event specifically for Warnell students. This is a great opportunity to connect with students, learn about clubs, and meet new faculty and staff members. Warnell also hosts career events throughout the year, including a fall event that allows students to make connections for summer internships as well as a spring social that connects students with alumni and potential employers in a casual setting.\n\nGuest speakers, club meetings and morning biscuit events throughout the semesters also offer opportunities for our students to connect and learn more about their chosen major.\n\nInternships\n\nWe believe in hands-on learning, and internships play a key role in the student experience. Many employers seek interns through Warnell and interview students at the school each semester—for many, these summer opportunities turn into jobs after graduation. Our students may spend their summers combing the beach for sea turtle nests, trekking through the wilderness with a group of campers, or walking through the forests to inventory timber. In some cases, an internship may count as a course credit (but please talk to your advisor before pursuing this option).\n\nInternship opportunities are posted on the Warnell Job Board.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nWarnell's Discover Abroad program is students' first stop when exploring courses beyond our Athens campus. Discover Abroad offers study abroad and service-learning programs on the theme of \"sustaining human societies and the natural environment\" in Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. These classes are open to any UGA student, but are specifically designed to fit within Warnell's programs.\n\nLearn More about Discover Abroad\n\nSTUDENT CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS\n\nWarnell students are some of the most active on campus. Find a variety of clubs within Warnell that reflect your interests and major—this is a great way to meet other students and also connect with professionals in your chosen field.\n\nAmbassadors\n\nStudent Ambassadors represent the school at functions such as Homecoming, Georgia Forestry Association’s Legislative Day, and recruiting trips throughout the state. Ambassadors receive leadership and professional development training, and also mix and mingle with alumni and leaders in the forestry and natural resources professions. Benefits include\n\nBuild close connections with Warnell faculty, staff, alumni, and fellow students\n\nInteract with leaders from the private and public sectors\n\nReceive leadership training and certification\n\nSpecial recognition at alumni and school events\n\nWarnell swag!
