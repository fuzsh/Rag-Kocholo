        "text": "Following the addition of fintech expert Mark Flamme as a Managing Director in Chicago, AlixPartners has appointed transformation expert Jim Takach as a Managing Director in the firm’s Technology, Media & Telecommunications (TMT) practice. Based in Los Angeles, Takach brings over 21 years of consulting experience to the role.\n\nAn expert in large-scale transformations, mergers and acquisitions, and operations, Takach boasts decades of consulting as well as client-side industry expertise. Throughout his career, the seasoned consultant has helped companies realize significant value through operational transformations. Takach has led complex projects across the world, including in Southeast Asia, India, North America, and Europe.\n\nBefore joining management consultancy AlixPartners, Takach ran his own company – Aspect Consulting – for the span of a year. His work included an operational transformation for a Hong Kong tech company, and an operating expense reduction project for a Swedish firm. Before that, he was SVP, Client Services and Program Management, at Deluxe Entertainment Services for one year. Leading a team of over 170 people, Takach launched a new operating model to leverage offshore capabilities to reduce costs and improve service.\n\nTakach was a Partner and Principal at PwC from 2011 to 2017, after the Big Four firm acquired PRTM. He worked as a consultant at PRTM for 15 years, rising to the level of Partner in less than six years. At both PwC and PRTM, Takach focused on providing operational improvement services to the TMT sector.\n\nPrior to his consulting work, he was a Marketing Manager at industrial parts supplies McMaster-Carr, responsible for customers and marketing for the western US, Hawaii, and Alaska. Takach was also previously a Captain in the US Air Force, leading systems engineering and testing in support of satellite and space shuttle missions. He holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering from UCLA, and a bachelor’s in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\n“We are delighted to welcome Jim to the AlixPartners team,” said Simon Freakley, CEO of AlixPartners. “His broad and deep experience in the technology, telecommunications, and media industries along with his talent for leading large-scale change and improvement programs will be instrumental for our clients.”"
