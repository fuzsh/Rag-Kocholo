        "text": "Dr. John Sviokla is a consultant, investor, board member, thought leader, and teacher with passion for helping organizations create tangible strategies to capitalize on the biggest trends affecting business and society. In particular, he has been looking into the implications of the bionic age on companies and investors. See The Bionic Company from February of this year.\n\nDr. Sviokla recently retired from PwC (June 2018) as the Chief Marketing Officer of PwC US, where he led a strategic revamp of the PwC US marketing organization (300+ people, $100 million in program spend) to better align it with the needs of a $13 billion services firm, in the context of a bionic age. PwC is now equipped to use data-driven automated processes and partnerships to develop a population understanding of their target market, leading to deep strategic advantage over competition.\n\nDr. Sviokla continues to serve as the leader of PwC’s think tank, The Exchange. For the past seventeen years, he has led a team that brings in the world’s best scientists, entrepreneurs, and leading firms to speak from the front lines on the most high-impact trends, including: self-driving cars, platform businesses, the Internet of Things, the talent war, autonomous robots, and other leading topics. These meetings make trends real for their clients, and enable them to respond to them before the competition. See here for a snapshot from a recent meeting.\n\nIn Dr. Sviokla’s new adventure, he continues to work directly with clients in a range of industries, and he regularly researches and publishes about strategic issues. He is the author of the book The Self-Made Billionaire Effect, and of scores of articles and blog posts that have appeared in Harvard Business Review, The Wall Street Journal, the MIT Sloan Review, Strategy & Business, and others. For examples of his published work, here is a recent podcast on artificial intelligence, as well as a deep cut from his archive on “Exploiting the Virtual Value Chain” – a piece he wrote in 1995 on how companies can take advantage of the coming digital age.\n\nAbout PwC Advisory\n\nPwC’s (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Advisory practice, PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services LLC (PwC Advisory Services), provides a mix of industry and functional expertise to help its clients address their most interesting and complex business issues and opportunities from strategy through execution.\n\nThe firm’s offerings and expertise have expanded primarily by developing deep skills and top talent from within. That growth has been complemented by strategic acquisitions over the past several years, including Booz & Co, Diamond Management and Technology Consultants, PRTM, Ant’s Eye View, BGT, and Ray Group International, among others.\n\nThese acquisitions added deep experience in strategy, management, and technology consulting to PwC’s expanded breadth of services and capabilities.\n\nThe Advisory practice aligns its marketing strategies and messaging to business imperatives that represent the issues and opportunities of primary importance to its clients. These business imperatives help start conversations and bring together insights from across the firm. This integrated thinking helps drive the multi-competency, strategy-through-execution approach that sets PwC Advisory apart in the market. PwC Advisory has been recognized by the analyst community, earning one or more ratings as a leader in every major category of the Advisory business, including strategy, management, technology, risk, forensics, and deals, as well as in key investments areas such as human capital, analytics, and digital."
