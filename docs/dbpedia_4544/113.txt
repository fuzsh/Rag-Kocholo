The public park over the Hudson that opened in 2021, Little Island has paired an oyster-themed night market with a performance series called the Oyster Radio Hour: The event is a resurrection after a decade of the New Amsterdam Market, that will run from Wednesday, July 31 through Sunday, August 4.

You don’t need tickets to the performances to enjoy the night market — and while the show starts at 8 p.m. nightly, food is available to anyone from 6:30 to 10 p.m. through the weekend.

The five-night event will feature shucked oysters and other seafood dishes, cocktails, and desserts. The Real Mother Shuckers will shuck a selection of oysters. Houseman will offer a grilled tuna and bluefish pate. Downeast Dayboat will sell scallop rolls, grilled scallops, and kebabs. Cervo’s will offer oysters, mussels, clam salad, and a seafood platter. Oyster Party and Lobster Place are selling a selection of oysters and lobster. Drinks and desserts come from Slow Drinks, Té Company, Chomps Élysées, La Newyorkina, and Pamina Dolci & Gelato. Prices range from $5 to $35 per item.

The nightly performances from the Oyster Radio Hour are $15 and start at 8 p.m. in the amphitheater, a three-act live radio show that celebrates the resilience of oysters. Susan Sarandon leads interviews, interspersed with performances from Broadway vocalists from Hadestown and Lempicka, the production based on the Polish painter. The Oyster Radio Hour is presented in partnership with Yo-Yo Ma’s Our Common Nature.
