        "text": "Not many can say that they were there when it happened. Eddie Kramer has been right smack center of it as it happened, making it happen and shaping its very essence with his bare hands for five decades and counting. We’re talking about rock – the sound of rock and the deafening impact the craft of engineering, producing and mixing it right has on how it ends up echoing through history. Meet audio visionary Eddie Kramer, the uncrowned king who shaped the sound of the legends that became immortal icons of rock and who in the process became a royalty of rock himself. This is his collection of drums and a true homage to classic rock as we know it.\n\nThe Legacy of Rock SDX zones in on Eddie’s formative years in the buzzing sixties London scene and continues on through the seventies. It includes five drum kits, each sourced and tailored to mirror a significant era or sound in Kramer’s remarkable career. All drums were recorded in Kramer’s studio of choice, Studio 1 at AIR in London, and captured through signal chains of vintage microphones as well as handpicked, rare and custom equipment scouted specifically for these sessions.\n\nThese drums rock. Take it from the man who only in the first two decades of his career managed to work with The Rolling Stones and The Beatles, record the entire Jimi Hendrix catalog, capture several of Led Zeppelin’s most pioneering albums and man the board as the original Woodstock festival was caught on tape. Welcome to a bona fide treasure chest of drum sounds – ready for you to hone, mold and shape to make your own dent in rock history with.\n\nABOUT\n\nEDDIE KRAMER.\n\nThe brushstrokes of Eddie Kramers’s ability to paint with sound has made rock history a glaring palette of color. Not only did he help shape the iconic sound of Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Kiss and many more in the sixties and seventies – his ear, touch and craftsmanship has had an immense impact throughout his entire career and to this day. We dare to say that arguably no one in his field has left a more distinct footprint on their path through rock history than he has.\n\nReading his list of credits from top to bottom sums his collaborations up to more than 750 albums covering all genres, all facets of rock and a myriad of the names anyone would file under ‘icons’ without thinking twice.\n\nIn addition to his deep-rooted passion for audio production, Eddie is also a published author and photographer. Eddie’s candid portraits of the rock luminaries he’s worked with over the years have been exhibited in some of the world’s most prestigious galleries and museums and have become of interest for collectors internationally.\n\nBeing a frequent lecturer at workshops and seminars, he also likes to educate by sharing his lifelong well of experience from his side of the studio glass with the next generation of audio craftsmen.\n\nABOUT\n\nEDDIE KRAMER.\n\nThe brushstrokes of Eddie Kramers’s ability to paint with sound has made rock history a glaring palette of color.

During his London years, he worked at three of the most legendary studios in rock: Pye Studios, Regent Sound and Olympic Studios. In these studios is where he recorded Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Traffic and many more. In 1968, Kramer relocated to New York primarily to work more closely with Jimi Hendrix but also founded many other long-lasting musical relationships, one of them being the start of his five-album stint with Led Zeppelin. Kramer rounded off the 1960s by capturing the original Woodstock festival on tape. The recordings ended up on the three-disc album “Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More,” featuring a myriad of now iconic performances.\n\n1970s\n\n1970s\n\nEddie began the seventies by working alongside famous acoustician John Storyk to oversee the creation of Electric Lady Studios, Jimi Hendrix’s state-of-the-art studio on Manhattan, costing a then-staggering one million dollars to build and equip. Through the decade, Eddie continued to work on seminal records for Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix as well as a string of other artists such as Peter Frampton, David Bowie, Joe Cocker and many more. Perhaps most notably, his lengthy association with Kiss begins with his work on “Alive!,” an album that in many ways defined the early stages of Kiss’ career. It subsequently went multi-platinum and Eddie produced five more of the band’s albums – all of which went platinum.\n\n2000s –\n\nPRESENT DAY\n\n2000s –\n\nPRESENT DAY\n\nThrough the 2000s and to this day, Kramer has continued to work at the very apex of the industry and with a wide variety of artists and projects. In the early 2000s, he engineered the Grammy-winning recording of the Carlos Santana feat. Michelle Branch single “The Game of Love.” In 2003, Eddie received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the AES show in New York City and in 2010 he was nominated for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One of the most recent highlights was the Emmy Award he won for his work on the Jimi Hendrix documentary “Hear My Train a Comin’.”\n\nOne couldn’t possibly confuse the colossal 26,000 square feet Victorian-style building towering up like a beacon on Lyndhurst Road in the midst the busy Hampstead suburb of north London for anything but a church. Only if arriving at night, while the floodlighting shoots up along all sides of the red-brick facade and glares in the massive stained glass windows, it may suggest otherwise. But a studio? Probably not anyone’s guess. It indeed is – and likely one of the most impressive ones in the world at that.\n\nAIR Studios, founded by Sir George Martin back in 1970, was originally located on Oxford Street in Central London but had to move in 1991 when its 22-year lease ran out. It was then that the Lyndhurst location was found and a cumbersome conversion from church to state-of-the-art studio was undertaken. It finally opened its doors in December 1992. In between the two London locations, Martin also opened a branch on the remote Caribbean island of Montserrat.\n\nToday, AIR Lyndhurst accommodates the entire scope of the demands of the recording industry and handles anything from capturing full orchestras for scores to serving top artists of all genres with album productions.\n\nEDDIE KRAMER’S PRESETS.\n\nEddie’s selection of presets were engineered in Studio 1 at AIR and feature his very own take on mixes for each different kit as well as several of the included configurations.\n\nTOONTRACK IN-HOUSE PRESETS.\n\nThese presets were created by Toontrack’s sound design team as serve as our very own homage to classic rock and Eddie’s illustrious discography.\n\nKIT PRESETS.\n\nIn addition to the mix presets, there are kit presets available that enable you to quickly access and audition an unmixed state of all the different kits and configurations included."
