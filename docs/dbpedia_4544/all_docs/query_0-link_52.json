The images are date and time stamped and refreshed every three minutes - sometimes more often.\n\nAll images have a location description. Individual feeds may be interrupted if there's a system fault or if we're servicing a camera.\n\nNote that images are not captured when a camera is in use for managing traffic, when a camera is being maintained or in the event of a camera or system fault.\n\nIf a new camera is added as a Jam Cam, or a camera is removed, it will vanish from the XML feed.

The data is available at walking.data.tfl.gov.uk.\n\nThe data contains details on the time it takes (in minutes) as well as the number of steps to walk between these destinations. A moderate walking pace has been used for all walking times, and an average of 100 steps per minute has been used to represent the approximate number of steps taken between journeys.\n\nThis data could be used to show that walking in London can often be the quickest way to get from A to B, especially when journeys require interchanges.\n\nThis data was sourced from Google Maps.\n\nDue to the way in which the data was sourced, there may be some instances where the walking time differs from the time shown in TfL Journey Planner and the Unified API.\n\nOur Oyster Ticket Stop locations is a geo-coded KML feed of the 3,700 outlets across London where customers can top up their Oyster card and renew a Travelcard or Bus & Tram Pass.\n\nEach location is marked with the Oyster Ticket Stop logo.\n\nHow often we publish a fresh copy of the feed\n\n1440 mins\n\nMaximum time allowed between capturing and displaying the feed\n\n10 mins\n\nMaximum time information can be displayed before being updated\n\n4320 mins\n\nSome ideas\n\nAllow visitors to your website or users of your application to locate their nearest Oyster top-up location\n\nIncorporate the feed as part of an online travel planning service, or 'how to find us' page\n\nThe example feeds below are not updated and for demonstration purposes only.

Download the 'Transport connectivity assessment guide' on that page for additional background, examples and other useful measures of connectivity to complement the work with PTAL.\n\nThe PTAL grid\n\nPTAL values are provided for a grid of points at 100 meter intervals, covering the whole of London. The concept of presenting PTAL values for grid points is explained in detail in the guide on the Planning with WebCAT page.\n\nThe available PTAL data is provided in three files, one for a recent base year and two others for future scenarios in 2021 and 2031.\n\nFormat\n\nEach of the files is in CSV format, containing the following data fields:\n\nA unique identifier for each grid point\n\nThe X (Easting) coordinate, based on the British National Grid\n\nThe Y (Northing) coordinate, based on the British National Grid\n\nThe Access Index (AI) for the point (a calculated value from which we derive PTAL)\n\nThe Public Transport Access Level (PTAL)\n\nThe data can be imported into any standard GIS package using the X and Y coordinates.\n\nNUMBAT is TfL's most comprehensive rail demand dataset and provides data on boarders/alighters or demand on trains and in stations. Data is available from 2016 and represents the London Underground, Overground, Elizabeth Line and DLR demand.\n\nNUMBAT is for a typical day (by daytype) in the autumn of each year. Multiple data sources were combined to smooth any gaps and provide further information than otherwise available (such as lineloads). The data is adjusted to remove any abnormal circumstances and key events that may affect demand such as industrial action or short-term closures.\n\nYear-on-year NUMBAT fluctuations do not necessarily reflect whole-year annual demand changes. If you are interested in annualised station entry/exit totals, see Annual Counts instead of NUMBAT - it is available on the same crowding data page.\n\nAccess NUMBAT\n\nNUMBAT outputs are all given by 15 minutes throughout the day, representing typical flows by daytype:\n\nLink Load: Number of passengers on the train between two different consecutive stations on a line e.g. from Lambeth North to Waterloo on the Bakerloo line\n\nLink frequency (supply): Number of scheduled trains per quarter hour between two consecutive stations\n\nStation Boarders/Alighters: Number of passengers boarding or alighting at a specific platform in a specific station\n\nLine Boarders: Total boarders across a rail line, derived from summing station boarders. This gives a better picture than Entry/Exits for the utilisation of a line as it includes interchangers\n\nStation Flow: Number of passenger movements inside a station between its entrances and its different platforms. This includes boarding/alighting and interchange flows\n\nStation Entries/Exits: number of passengers entering/exiting the station through its gatelines (see also Annual Counts)\n\nTWT is the average of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, so summing all of NUMBAT 5 day types together is different from a week's passenger counts.\n\nRODS data is available on this site for 1996-2017. Please note this had a different methodology to NUMBAT.\n\nHow often we publish a fresh copy of the feed\n\nAnnually\n\nMaximum time allowed between capturing and displaying the feed\n\n9 months\n\nMaximum time information can be displayed before being updated\n\n1 year\n\nAnnual Counts present an annual picture of station entries and exits, used for trend analysis. Raw data is supplemented where there are gaps (such as ungated stations, or magnetic tickets not being picked up). The data is adjusted to remove any abnormal circumstances and key events that may affect demand such as industrial action or short-term closures.\n\nAnnual Counts are for a typical day (by daytype) in the autumn of each year. The outputs are all given by 15 minutes throughout the day, by timeband and are annualised using revenue data.\n\nAccess Annual Counts\n\nIf you are interested in boarders/alighters or demand on trains and in stations please see NUMBAT - it is available on the same crowding data page.\n\nHow often we publish a fresh copy of the feed\n\nAnnually\n\nMaximum time allowed between capturing and displaying the feed\n\n9 months\n\nMaximum time information can be displayed before being updated\n\n1 year\n\nThe BUSTO dataset provides an estimate of boardings, alightings and loadings on a typical day on TfL's bus network.\n\nThe dataset is published annually and represents the travel demand on the bus network on a typical weekday, Saturday and Sunday. Data is available for all routes except school and mobility routes.\n\nThe data is available in .csv format can be found in a data bucket under the folder /BUSTO.\n\nFurther information about the BUSTO dataset (and how it can be used) is available in the BUSTO User Guide and Data Dictionary.\n\nThis quarterly report details usage, by London borough, for the specified quarter, as well as the same quarter of the previous year to allow for comparison.\n\nDial-a-Ride is a free door-to-door service for disabled and older people who can't use buses, trains or the Tube.

Its purpose is to monitor progress, at a borough and London-wide level, towards achieving the aims and targets of the strategy."
