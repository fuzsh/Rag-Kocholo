        "text": "Women's Golf 2/13/2023 6:30:00 PM\n\nWomen's Golf Goes Shot-For-Shot With UNCG and App State on Day One of Oyster Shuck Match Play\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. – Playing a pair of extremely close rounds, the Radford women's golf team took narrow 3-2 losses to UNCG and Appalachian State on the first day of the 2023 Oyster Shuck Match Play on Monday.\n\nOfficially opening their spring season after tons of hard work over the winter, the Highlanders drew the Spartans as the first round match-up. Freshman Shea Smith took down Victoria Smith by two holes and senior Jayde Dudley added a win with a one-hole advantage over Anna Bowman.\n\nThe very talented UNCG squad came out on top in the other three pairings however, moving on to a semifinal showdown with Western Carolina.\n\nRadford then had a chance to bounce back in the consolation bracket, facing off against the Mountaineers. Coach Beeler's team got off to a great start, going up 2-0 with both Smith (2UP) and Dudley (3&2) once again earning victories.\n\nEach of the next three matchups went to extra holes in extremely close contests. Natalie Welsh went up against App State's top golfer in Meghan Mitchell and just barely lost in 19 holes. Hannah Linedemann carried her strong play from the fall over, but lost on the 20th hole. And Jimenna Ramirez battled to the very end but eventually lost on the 22nd hole as App State stole away victory.\n\nJMU and Western Carolina both went 2-0 on the day and will go head-to-head in the championship while Samford and UNCG will play for third place.\n\nCOURSE INFORMATION\n\nCharleston Municipal Golf Course\n\nPar 72\n\n5,810 yards\n\nFIRST ROUND RESULTS\n\nUNCG (3) def.
