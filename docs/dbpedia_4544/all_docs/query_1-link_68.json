        "text": "But with a little coaxing, I set out to see what I was missing. I soon found out that each item has a story about what it is and how it got to our plates — with a few surprises along the way.\n\nWe’re in the depths of summer, so Del’s Lemonade seems like the logical place to start. The Rhode Island analog to Richie’s Slush in Everett, Del’s gets a lot of press for its lush consistency and sweet, but not too sweet, flavors that locals love.\n\nWell, most locals. I have to admit, this was a hard sell for me. I’ve been a firm believer in the perfection of Richie’s since I was old enough to walk to the corner store by myself to get it.\n\nPlus, Del’s has frozen bits of lemon peel in it. And before you tell me that means it has real fruit in it, I’m Gen X — us latch-key kids survived on corn syrup.\n\nBut Del’s does have an interesting backstory. Its roots can be traced to Naples in 1840, when, the story goes, the patriarch of the DeLucia family would store snow in caves, waiting until summer to mix it with ripe lemons and sugar, to concoct a drink he sold at the local market. When his son came to America at the turn of the century, he brought the recipe with him. In 1948, a grandson, Angelo, started the company in Cranston. Its seasonal stands are now ubiquitous throughout Rhode Island — and spreading to other states.\n\nThe company, now run by a fourth generation of DeLucias, dishes up at least 3 million servings a year, says Demetrios Kazantzis, a Del’s vice president. That’s not even counting the collaborations with local businesses, including a lemon flavor of Warwick Ice Cream and lemon and watermelon shandies made by Narragansett Brewing Co.\n\nFor me, the shandies remain the superior choice, but then again I’m a parent of teenagers and I find beer useful. But my Rhode Island born-and-bred daughters swear by Del’s. And I can see the frozen lemonade appeal: It’s definitely fresh, like a taste of summer, for less than $5.\n\nWhen all of the stands first open for the season, people “go around beeping their horns and screaming, ‘Del’s, Del’s!’” Kazantzis tells me. “How many people do you see screaming about drinking Pepsi?”\n\nAs popular as Del’s is, the title of official state drink — formally designated by the Legislature in 1993 — goes to another local icon: coffee milk.\n\nA staple of diners and school cafeteria lunches, coffee milk is just what it sounds like: Coffee syrup, mixed into milk. Before we go any further, I have to say this isn’t for me — I don’t drink coffee or like milk — but my boyfriend, Graham, a native of England, is a recent convert. He thinks that makes him more of a local than me. (He also has a T-shirt that says “Of course I’m right, I have a British accent,” so let’s just say I pick my battles.)\n\nThere are about as many versions of coffee milk’s origin story as there are places to order it. Some believe it’s tied to the wave of Italian immigration in the 1920s that centered around Rhode Island’s textile mills, that it was a way to get the most out of used coffee grounds, or that it began as a novel soda fountain treat. (Some swear it started in Massachusetts — I’ll ignore that.)\n\nWherever it came from, coffee milk has been deeply rooted in the state by two Rhode Island-born brands: Autocrat and Eclipse. Now under the umbrella of British tea and coffee giant Finlays, both companies have been mainstays for generations. Autocrat, established in 1895 as the Brownell & Field Coffee Co., says the syrup was its own creation. “The company was mostly roasting coffee” in the 1930s, says Arthur Lopez, a Finlays vice president. Then the idea came about: “What if we brew coffee to high strength, add sugar, and instead of Hershey’s Syrup, we do a coffee syrup based on that?”\n\nToday, New Englanders consume nearly 400,000 quarts of Autocrat per year, with most of those sales in Rhode Island, Lopez says. Key to its popularity is that the company’s recipe hasn’t changed.\n\nPeople “feel strongly about how it should taste,” Lopez says. “There’s a cult following — the last thing we want is any kind of revolution.”\n\nAnother thing that draws a cult following: pizza strips.\n\nRhode Islanders are serious about these pieces of dough and sauce, minus the cheese. D. Palmieri’s Bakery needs them to be ready the minute the Johnston shop opens in the morning. “People want their pizza strips at 6 a.m., to go to the beach,” says Eric Palmieri.\n\nHe is the fifth generation in his family to make pizza strips in Rhode Island. “My great-great-grandfather Domenico started on Federal Hill in 1905,” he says. Now, he works alongside his father, Stephen, and other relatives.\n\n“A lot of Italian families made them at home, before the turn of the century, when they came here as immigrants,” Palmieri says. “During the Depression, it was affordable, and simple — just sauce and dough.” At Palmieri’s, they stretch the bread dough into pizza pans, top it with thick sauce, bake, then serve it at room temperature.\n\nPizza strips are sold in bakeries all over the state, and all are subtly different. In addition to the “red” strips, there are also “white,” topped only with spices, olive oil, grated Parmesan, and fresh garlic. I’ve yet to come across a version that my younger daughter won’t eat. Which is fine with me: How else can you make a teenager happy for about $1.50?\n\nTo say they’re popular is an understatement: D. Palmieri’s alone sells more than 1.1 million a year. And there’s no plan to stop anytime soon — ”We’ll be here for at least another generation,” Palmieri says.\n\nIf food doesn’t spring to mind when you think of Rhode Island, it’s likely the beach does — this is the Ocean State after all. Enter: the stuffed quahog.\n\n“They’ve been part of Rhode Island cuisine for at least 80 years,” says chef Walter Potenza, a Rhode Island restaurateur and owner of three cooking schools.\n\nFor the uninitiated (non-Rhode Islanders), stuffed quahogs, or “stuffies,” start with large clams, or quahogs. They’re steamed, then the clam is removed, chopped, and mixed with celery, bread, spices, and — depending on who is doing the cooking — Portuguese chourico, before being piled back into the shell and baked.\n\nStuffies began from humble means, as a “very traditional recipe to stretch the clam,” says TJ Delle Donne, assistant dean of the college of food innovation and technology at Johnson & Wales University in Providence. Made with a clam indigenous to Rhode Island, “It has its members-only vibe,” he says.\n\nTo see what all the fuss is about, Graham and I made the trek to Point Judith. At George’s of Galilee, a restaurant overlooking Narragansett’s Salty Brine State Beach, we sat on the deck. As much as I enjoyed the scenery, the stuffies had chourico in them — too spicy for me, someone whose favorite foods mimic those of a typical 6-year-old. Graham’s review, however, was 10 out of 10.\n\nHe was less pleased, though, when I insisted we walk across the street to Champlin’s and stand in line for the hour it took to order meatless stuffies at the counter. (I tried to explain that we had to, for the sake of science.) These were crispy on the edges, buttery on the inside, and worth the wait.\n\nStuffies are so popular here that last year the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation selected them to highlight the state’s food culture. The result: 7-foot-tall, 200-pound Styrofoam stuffies that went on display at airports across the country to promote tourism. That is some local pride.\n\nOne supersized stuffie is set to go on display at the Rhode Island house at the Big E this fall, if you want to see it for yourself.\n\nTraveling quahogs aside, another seafood shack classic is the clam cake, which Carolyn Wyman can tell you a thing or two about. A Rhode Island native and the author of 2023′s The Great Clam Cake and Fritter Guide, she ties their enduring appeal to nostalgia for Crescent Park and Rocky Point, now-defunct local amusement parks where “shore dinners” were a highlight.\n\n“I have incredibly positive memories of all-you-can-eat clam cakes and chowder, and amusement park rides, and summer,” Wyman says.\n\nThe Rhode Island recipe is very simple, she says: flour, milk, chopped clams, baking powder and soda, sometimes clam juice. They are always deep fried, and usually dunked in chowder. “It’s a classic New England food.”\n\nAnother plus: “They’re usually the cheapest things on the menu at most clam shacks.”\n\nIt doesn’t get any more Rhode Island than the hot wieners at Olneyville New York System, ironic considering “New York” is in the name. The Stevens family — who emigrated from Greece and first settled in Brooklyn, hence the New York — have been serving them at their Providence restaurant since the 1930s. A second location opened in Cranston in 1981.\n\nGoing into that Cranston restaurant today is a trip back in time, with brown and orange decor, vinyl booths, and banks of fluorescent lighting.\n\n“I’ve never tried these before,” I confess as I step up to the counter. The man taking my order is perplexed: “Have you been in prison?” he asks.\n\nKnowing how to order is just as important as what you order, says my new friend, Dennis Dias, who’s worked for the company since 1979. “All the way” means with all the toppings — mustard, a meat sauce, chopped onions, and celery salt, Dias says. And whatever you do, “Do not call them hot dogs.” He ticks off the reasons: First, they are made with pork, beef, and veal. Unlike hot dogs, the ends are flat, cut from a 10-pound roll made to the eatery’s specifications at a Johnston company. The “system,” he says, refers to how they’re made — cooked and assembled in front of you.\n\nMy boyfriend orders two all the way (and a coffee milk). I opt for two, no onions. I know enough about local food lore to know what’s likely coming next: the hot wieners are often lined up on the inside of the employee’s forearm, from wrist to elbow, and topped in an assembly line fashion\n\nI try to silence the growing chorus of don’t put them on your arm in my head — it’s a me issue; Graham likens me to Adrian Monk, the phobia-filled TV detective. Thankfully for me, four weren’t enough to merit the assembly line.\n\nThey were actually pretty good, even after I knew how the sausage was made (I got a thorough lesson from J&W’s Delle Donne, who used phrases like “emulsified fat” and delved into the use of intestines, but I’ll spare you the details). The texture was less firm than a standard-style hot dog, and the meat sauce added a nice tang.\n\nNew York System, still run by the same family, was even awarded a prestigious James Beard Foundation America’s Classics award, “given to restaurants with timeless appeal, each beloved in its region for quality food that reflects the character of its community.” Now I can see why.\n\nAs I made my Rhode Island food tour, I was struck by how often the same themes emerged: Family, affordability, the way things have always been. It made me think of something Palmieri told me.\n\nAfter the family’s bakery was demolished by fire in 2007, there was an outpouring of support from longtime customers. “I grew up here — but then I realized how much it meant to other people,” Palmieri said. “Our food has been at some of the most momentous occasions of people’s lives — birthday parties, holidays, funerals. I saw it from a completely different perspective.”\n\nThat same perspective that helps explain why these half-dozen staples remain so beloved here. I think of my own Italian family, and what we’ve held onto, and it all starts to make sense.\n\n“The only way things stay popular is through the stories we tell, traditions we hand down,” Delle Donne says. “In the Northeast, we are traditional. Family lineage . . . that’s how these traditions stay, how we keep our ancestors in our memory, taking their recipe book.”\n\nCulinary arts is “a language we all speak,” he tells me. It just so happens that here, it’s spoken with a Rhode Island accent.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that Portuguese chourico is a common addition to stuffed quahogs.\n\nFood and dining: News and guides for diners about restaurants, bars, chefs, business and innovation in the food industry.\n\nThis season is bittersweet for the Mr. Lemon family\n\nAfter 60 years, ‘Wein-O-Rama’ in Cranston, known for ‘hot wieners,’ has closed"
