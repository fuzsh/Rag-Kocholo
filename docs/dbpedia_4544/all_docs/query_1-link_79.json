If you ever have a chance to visit or attend one of their events go, as it is one of the most spiritual, creative and freeing places I have ever been to and I felt so blessed to attend.\n\nFounded in 1992 by avant-garde visionary Robert Wilson, The Watermill Center is an interdisciplinary laboratory for the arts and humanities situated on ten acres of Shinnecock ancestral territory on Long Island’s East End, offering year-round artist residencies and education programs. With an emphasis on creativity and collaboration, Watermill integrates contemporary artistic practice with resources from the humanities and research from the sciences to provide a global community with the time, space and freedom to create and inspire.\n\nThe Watermill Center Annual Summer Benefit celebrates the work of international artists through an engaging and dynamic evening. Described as “an enchanted forest” and ”performance art extravaganza,” the Annual Summer Benefit unites the worlds of art, theatre, design, and fashion to raise funds in support of our year-round programming. This summer, invited artists will fill The Watermill Center’s property with installations for guests to explore while enjoying cocktails and refreshments across our scenic campus. Presented by Van Cleef & Arpels\n\nThe chorographer Lucinda Childs was being honored and T2C had the honor to interview her. Child’ formed her own company in 1973 and three years later was featured in the landmark avant-garde opera Einstein on the Beach by Philip Glass and Robert Wilson, for which she won an Obie Award. In 1977, she and Wilson co-directed and performed in I Was Sitting on My Patio This Guy Appeared I Thought I Was Hallucinating, which they revived for the Festival d’Automne in Paris in 2021, where they also created an evening length work titled, Bach 6 Solowith the violinist Jennifer Koh. She was a constant choreographer with Wilson and Glass. Childs has choreographed over thirty works for major ballet companies.\n\nI really want to thank Bonnie Comley and Stewart F Lane for having me as their guest, This was really a truly spectacular night of creativity.\n\nRight now shows that harness dance and cult singer songwriters are captivating the theatre scene. You have Illinoise which won Justin Peck a Tony Award for best choreography, with songs from Sufjan Stevens to give it soul. The Tony winning musical The Outsiders with music by Jamestown Revival (Jonathan Clay & Zach Chance) and the brilliant choreography by Rick Kuperman & Jeff Kuperman, whose moves make their dancers soar. And now the newest kid on the block Ain’t Done Bad,Ain’t Done Bad, conceived, directed, choreographed and performed by Jakob Karr, with songs by country singer-songwriter Orville Peck.\n\nKarr performed on on Broadway in Cats, Cirque Du Soleil’s Volta and Viva Elvis So You Think You Can Dance Season 6 – Runner Up, America’s Got Talent, Glee; Company XIV and many more. Peck, is a South African country musician based in the United States and Canada. He is well-known for wearing a mask and not showing his face publicly. In June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, Queerty named Peck among the fifty heroes “leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people”.\n\nAin’t Done Bad’s story is basic…gay boy (Karr) feels like a misfit in his hometown and leaves to find love in the big city. Has multiple trysts until he finds the one (Joshua Escover). Returns home to be accepted by his family, especially his dad (Adrian Lee).\n\nThe dancing is sensual, sexy, joyous and exuberant. Karr’s choreography athletic as he keeps his dancers fluid, yet precise. Karr is an exquisite dancer with extensions that go on for miles as he leaps, spins and splits mid air.\n\nAlso dancing were Megumi Iwama as the mother, Ian Spring as his brother, Caden Hunter, Madison O’Connor, Luke Quails, Yusaku Komori and Jordan Lombardi as his friends. Everyone in this cast is an accomplished dancer that is being given a chance to excel and show off their multiple skills. They are a joy to watch.\n\nThe costumes by Philip Lupo help define the characters, as each dancer plays multiple roles. I loved the scenic design by Lupo, Joey Coombs, and Blake Schulte of rustic wood and mirrors.\n\nThe show is a celebration of gay pride both in its story and music choice. This is a coming out, that is part fantasy and part what could and should be.\n\nAin’t Done Bad: Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, by Blue Topaz Productions and Renaissance Theatre Company until August 31st."
