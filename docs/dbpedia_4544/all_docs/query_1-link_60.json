        "text": "Pros\n\nQuiet, spacious units make this a hidden gem in bustling Midtown\n\nNine distinct apartment-style rooms\n\nMost units have modern kitchenettes with stainless steel appliances\n\nSome south-facing units have stellar city views\n\nFlat-screen TVs and coffeemakers\n\nLaundry facilities on-site\n\nWalking distance to Central Park, tourist sites and subway lines\n\nPrices are reasonable given the amount of space and location\n\nSmall business center and vending area\n\nFree Wi-Fi in rooms and lobby\n\nSee More Pros\n\nCons\n\nCertain units have a view of a brick wall\n\nMany rooms allow smoking, though scent is hard to detect\n\nFurnishings are clean but slightly outdated\n\nCutlery items are minimal, and there are no wine glasses\n\nNo restaurant, bar or fitness center on-site\n\nSee More Cons\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis 112-room affordable property is a block from Radio City Music Hall and close to Times Square. The studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments have been around for more than a few years, just like the people who run the place like clockwork; it attracts repeat guests for a reason. The spacious upper-middle-range units feel homey and most contain modern kitchenettes with coffeemakers and microwaves. There’s free Wi-Fi throughout, and a comfortable lobby for checking e-mail and reading one of the free newspapers. For those who don't mind sacrificing traditional hotel features (there is no restaurant, bar, or fitness center), it's one of the best options for the price in this tourist-centric location.\n\nSee More Bottom Line\n\nOyster Hotel Review\n\nRadio City Apartments\n\nScene\n\nA great fit for families and extended business travelers who desire extra space\n\nDuring the week, Radio City Apartments attracts business travelers -- many who stay for the entire week. On the weekends, the focus shifts toward tourists. The entrance can be found not by a large sign, but rather a small plaque to the side of the front doors. A small front desk area leads to a historic iron staircase and attractive lobby area with stylish red and black decor where guests mingle and read the newspaper. Two elevators lead to the second floor, where guests will find a small business center, vending machines, and black and white photos of the property through the ages.\n\nHistoric touches include stained glass windows, old mail chutes, and gilded ceilings, which add to the building's character.\n\nSee More Scene\n\nLocation\n\nA somewhat hidden location in the center of bustling Midtown\n\nA small plaque on a busy area of West 49th Street alerts newcomers to the location of Radio City Apartments. Just a few blocks away is Radio City Music Hall (for which this property is named), as well as Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Fifth Avenue shopping, The Museum of Modern Art, Central Park and several subway lines. It’s super convenient to Midtown attractions but slightly removed from the hubbub of Times Square.\n\nSee More Location\n\nRooms\n\nApartment-style rooms with simple, homey furnishings\n\nThe property has 112 units with nine distinct room types in studio, one- and two-bedrooms sizes. Most of these rooms have modern kitchenettes (some studios do not) that include ovens, stovetops, microwaves, coffeemakers, cutlery, and glasses. Housekeeping service is daily, though guests are expected to wash their own dishes (except when checking out). Room decor is homey but a bit plain, and furniture is slightly outdated. Ask for a room with a view or you may get a brick wall!\n\nSee More Rooms\n\nFeatures\n\nThis apartment-style property has few features.\n\nThough the property lacks a restaurant and bar, there are plenty of options for food and drink in the neighborhood (and plenty of take-out options for ordering in). Discounted parking and daily gym passes for a local fitness center can be arranged through the front desk. The second floor, which can be accessed through the historic staircase in the lobby, has a vending area and workstation with Mac and printer.\n\nSee More Features\n\nRelated Hotels\n\nMidtown West\n\nNew York City's City Club Hotel is a 65-room upper-middle-range boutique hotel with tons of style.
