However Here We Are, the final Original Cast Recording from legendary composer Stephen Sondheim and Jason Robert Brown’s The Connector are out on YouTube and these are the best scores of the year.\n\nAnother CD out is My Favorite Things: The Rodgers & Hammerstein 80th Anniversary Concert: featuring a 40-piece orchestra and stars, including Michael Ball, Maria Friedman, Daniel Dae Kim, Audra McDonald, Aaron Tveit, and Patrick Wilson, the Concert was recorded live at London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane.

Beginning at 8PM each evening, the show blends hope and interconnectedness, spotlighting the humble oyster’s journey of revival, including special Broadway guests Amber Gray and Amber Iman.\n\nDuring The Oyster Radio Hour’s run in the Amph through August 4, the Island’s central plaza, known as the Play Ground, will transform from 6:30-10PM daily into a one-of-a-kind Oyster Market, with food and beverages curated and overseen by New Amsterdam Market founder and world-famous market designer Robert LaValva.\n\nAlongside live oyster shucking, the market will feature 10 local vendors selling their unique culinary creations, which pair perfectly with the live performance. The local vendors include Real Mothershuckers, Oyster Party, Lobster Place, Houseman, Dayboat Blue, Cervo’s, Té Company, La Newyorkina, Chomps Elysées, and Pamina Dolce Gelato. Danny Childs, author of Slow Drinks, will make summer bespoke cocktails during a bar takeover on Friday, August 3.\n\nThe Oyster Radio Hour is a collaboration between RR Sigel, who was the Associate Artistic Director of NY PopsUp in 2021; WNYC podcast producer Ana González, previously of Radiolab: For Kids; composer Angélica Negrón who has performed at Opera Philadelphia, the LA Philharmonic, NY Philharmonic, Seattle Symphony, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and more; and Emmy® and Drama Desk Award®-nominated songwriter Mark Sonnenblick.\n\nKeenan Tyler Oliphant (Hadestown) serves as director with Miller & Harlow as writers; Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew (Kimberly Akimbo) as lighting/video designer; Beth Lake(Camelot) as sound designer; Dr. Matthew Hare, Elliott Ma, Ayasha Guerin, Moody Harney, and Alan Michelson as audio interviewees; and Beatrice Perez-Arche as stage manager.\n\nLittle Island’s first annual, four-month-long summer season of world premieres, which kicked off on June 1, features a total of nine newly commissioned pieces. Little Island’s new arts program moves towards the future with a commitment to a multi-year roster of original work, all commissioned by and developed at Little Island. Bookended by the premiere of choreographer Twyla Tharp’s newest work How Long Blues and a 90-minute remix of Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro in which outré opera diva Anthony Roth Costanzo sings every leading role, the season offers premieres of varying scales across all areas of performance – including music, dance, theater, opera, comedy, jazz, pop, and funk, all outdoors and directly sited on the Hudson River at 14th Street in New York City. The Amph, the park’s 700-seat amphitheater, will house larger scale performances at a $25 ticket price, while The Glade, the park’s\n\nMoving from New York City Center Encores! to Broadway, Once Upon a Mattress at The Hudson Theatre still is appealable, bouncy and has heart. This shimmering revival had the perfect opening (night) for a princess! Helmed by Tony-nominated Encores! Artistic Director Lear deBessonet (Into the Woods, Lionel Bart’s Oliver!), with a new adaptation by Amy Sherman-Palladino (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), this production is sure to please. Marshall Barer, Jay Thompson, and Dean Fuller’s book has been transformed and is much more palatable to today’s audience’s thanks to Ms. Palladino rewrite.\n\nSutton Foster makes this role her very own. This is not an easy task, as it made the young Carol Burnett a break out star. She is hilarious, as are her inserted one-liners. Her voice is not as strong as it should be, but she is winning and her chemistry with Michael Urie is infectious.\n\nThere has been major cast changes from Encore. The show opens with the Jester/ Minstrel (Daniel Breaker) singing about how we don’t quite know the fairy tale of old. He brings us back to where it all took place, a mythical kingdom in a desperate search for a suitable princess for the clueless Prince Dauntless (the adorable Michael Urie ). Queen Aggravain (Ana Gasteyer replaces the deliciously sinister Harriet Harris), is determined that no one is good enough for her son. However, no one can marry until Dauntless does.\n\nThis is a problem for Lady Larken (a glorious voiced Nikki Renée Daniels), as she is pregnant by the stupid Sir Harry (Will Chase replaces the uber handsome Cheyenne Jackson), so Harry goes in search of a princess and brings back Winifred, Fred for short (Sutton Foster). Anxious for a mate she swims past the moat, over the castle walls, singing the hit song “Shy.”\n\nDauntless and Fred immediately have a connection, which makes the Queen and her lackey The Wizard (the delightfully quirky Brooks Ashmanskas who took over for Francis Jue) come up with a sensitivity test of a pea under 20 mattresses to sabotage the union. The mute King Sextimus (the fabulous David Patrick Kelly ) along with the rest of the kingdom find out the plan and load the mattresses with more than just a pea and the Kingdom is finally set right.\n\nUrie gives us a riotous version of a man/child dominated but with heart and soul, so you root for him to win his princess.\n\nDaniel Breaker does a winning “Very Soft Shoes”\n\nLear deBessonet’s love of this piece shows in her direction as she brinsg the audience along on this journey.\n\nThe choreography by Lorin Latarro, is seriously fun especially “Spanish Panic” and “Song of Love”.\n\nMy biggest complaint is when Encore’s moves to Broadway, they put the orchestra on stage. What wowed me at Encores, was upsetting here. When the orchestra played the opening strains a smile started to spread all over the audiences face and stayed there for more than 2½ hours, because it was an old fashion musical done well. The music by the late Mary Rodgers (daughter of Richard), with lyrics by Marshall Barer came alive at encores, here because of the placement the music side falls flat, as we learn the true story of “The Princess and the Pea.”\n\nThe music direction by Mary-Mitchell Campbell, scenic design by David Zinn, costumes by Andrea Hood, lighting design by Amith Chandrashaker, sound design by Kai Harada, hair and wig design by J. Jared Janas, and physical comedy and effects by Skylar Fox. Kimberlee Wertz is the music coordinator, orchestrations by Hershy Kay, Arthur Beck, and Carrol Huxley needed an oomph in coming to Broadway.\n\nFor this production think fractured fairy tales, starring the comedically talented Sutton Foster as Winnifred the Woebegone otherwise known as Fred.\n\nIt is always brings tears to my eyes and a joy to my heart to see musical theatre history brought back.\n\nOnce Upon a Mattress: Hudson Theatre, 141 W 44th Street, through November 30th.\n\nMR. DAREDEVIL — (Via Deadline) Wow. This isn’t your Netflix’s Daredevil. Visceral, cinematic, bloody — this is a Daredevil in the way that James Bond got a reboot with Daniel Craig.\n\nThe first look at the series was revealed Friday for the crowd at D23 in Anaheim. And there’s a big homage to Heat with Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock and Vincent Donofiro’s Kingpin meeting in a diner to verbally draw their boundaries.\n\n“If you step out of line, I’m going to be there,” says Murdock.\n\nKingpin, laughing, wonders if it’s Daredevil talking or Murdock.\n\nIn another shot, a prison inmate tells Murdock, “You don’t understand, people needed you.”\n\nAlso seen here is Jon Bernthal’s Frank Castle aka The Punisher, a long-haired ruffian who comes up against Murdock in fisticuffs before the former realizes it’s his ally.\n\nThe tagline that runs in the trailer: “The Devil’s Work Is Never Done.”\n\nMarvel President Kevin Feige also confirmed a season 2 will be shooting soon.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again follows original star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock, a blind attorney-turned-crimefighting superhero, and also features Vincent D’Onofrio reprising his role as mob boss Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin and Jon Bernthal returning as Punisher.\n\nThe cast of Daredevil: Born Again also includes Margarita Levieva, Arty Froushan, Sandrine Holt, Michael Gandolfini and Nikki M. James.\n\nWe gotta wait till March 1, 2025 for Daredevil: Born Again.\n\nI got to admit, it’s great to have the original Netflix-band back together, but somehow the trailer didn’t work for me. It looked somehow different. Take a look:\n\nSNL AT 50 — Hard to believe but Saturday Night Live enters its 50th year in September.
