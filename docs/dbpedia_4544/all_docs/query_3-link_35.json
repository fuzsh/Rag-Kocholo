        "text": "Little Island’s four-month-long summer season of world premieres kicks off June 1, featuring a total of nine newly commissioned pieces.\n\nBookended by the premiere of legendary choreographer Twyla Tharp’s newest full-length piece, titled How Long Blues, and a 90-minute remix of Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro in which outré opera diva Anthony Roth Costanzo sings every leading role, the season will offer premieres of varying scales across all areas of performance – including music, dance, theater, opera, comedy, jazz, pop, and funk, all outdoors and directly sited on the Hudson River at 14th Street in New York City. The Amph, the park’s 700-seat amphitheater, will house larger scale performances at a $25 ticket price, while The Glade, the park’s 200-seat venue, will be home to more intimate works, all of which will be completely free to the public.\n\nIn addition to Tharp’s newest work, which marks her 60th year making dances and is a collaboration with T Bone Burnett and David Mansfield, the season will include: Robeson, a new work created and performed by star bass baritone Davóne Tines, co-created and directed by Zack Winokur, about events in the life of Paul Robeson; Open Throat by Henry Hoke, a theatrical experience based on the novella of the same name about a queer mountain lion living beneath the Hollywood sign, directed by Caitlin Ryan O’Connell; Day For Night, a dance by choreographer Pam Tanowitz that takes place before and after sunset and uses the cityscape as its score; Mama, an evening of all-new music about, and performed on, the water, written by Britton Smith, who performs alongside his funk liberation band, Britton & The Sting, with direction and choreography by Ebony Williams; TheOyster Radio Hour, a live three-act radio show combining science, story and song with special guest appearances to tell the captivating story of oysters in the Hudson River – a collaboration between RR Sigel, podcast producer Ana González and composer Angélica Negrón and Mark Sonnenblick, in partnership with Yo-Yo Ma’s Our Common Nature project; The Summer Legacy Ball, led by the stage and film costume designer and activist Qween Jean, and directed by a consortium of emerging young producers from across New York City; and The Manhattan Variations, a musical memoir that revolves around the legendary Lower East Side cocktail bar Milk and Honey, performed by the virtuoso mandolinist and acclaimed composer, Chris Thile, created by Thile and Claire Coffee. The season concludes with a 90-minute radically re-imagined adaptation of Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro, directed by Dustin Wills, with new arrangements by Dan Schlosberg, and costumes by Emily Bode, in which star countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo sings every leading role.\n\nIn July and August, The Glade will be home to a completely free-to-the-public performance series, in which a committee of New York cultural vanguards will each program one week of public events (to be announced shortly). The curators include Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning playwright, Suzan-Lori Parks, Grammy Award-winning artist Cécile McLorin Salvant, cabaret legend Justin Vivian Bond, comedy world sensation Morgan Jay, New Amsterdam Market founder and culinary world figure Robert LaValva, experimental musician, singer, and songwriter Gio Escobar and Standing on the Corner, and linguist Ross Perlin and the Endangered Language Alliance.\n\nBarry Diller, founder of Little Island said, “For the past three years, it’s been extraordinarily gratifying to see New Yorkers embrace Little Island – whether for a few moments, a few hours, an entire afternoon, or late into the evening. Now, with this inaugural slate of entirely original programming, we fulfill the initial intention and vision for the park. Little Island was incepted with the goal of becoming a permanent hub of cultural activity, excitement, and entertainment, constantly building and creating new work for the City to enjoy. There is going to be something great to see – all throughout the park – every night, all summer long.”\n\nIn June and September, The Glade will be New York’s newest outdoor cocktail lounge, complete with a bar designed by Green River Project and a menu of beer, wine, cocktails and mocktails that can be consumed in The Glade or enjoyed anywhere on Little Island. This will be just one of the multiple food and beverage venues in the park, throughout the summer."
