Until today - all thanks to the Lagos Innovates Idea Hub programme organised by the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF). One of the high points of my 2023 was the privilege of openhouse being amongst the 28 startups selected out of the 115 that applied last year - and making it to the top 8 finalists to pitch at the demo day in July! Just on Monday, I got a call inviting me to Wazobia FM today to share the openhouse story - you can imagine my shock as this was totally unexpectedü§£ I thought it was a dream until I checked my mail and saw the official invite too: ‚ÄúOn this week‚Äôs radio programme, Ezeafulukwe Peace Adetutu (Founder, Openhouse) will discuss the impact of the Lagos Innovates Idea Hub Programme on the business and share tips on capacity-building and continuous learning for startup founders‚Äù Somebody pinch me! OMG It's real!!!! This wouldn't have been possible without the guidance of the team, the masterclasses and mentorship sessions. I am grateful to Hakeem Onasanya Ifeoluwa Martins, CAPM¬Æ, PMI - ACP¬Æ Oluwaseyi Bondefaiye-Owope PSM, PSPO Tomilola Majekodunmi for their support. Like Dr. Dora Akunyili said: We have beautiful stories to tell the global audience, and we have to...put ourselves in a position to lend our voice to say, this is who we are, this is what we are doing, and this is what we did.\" So join me today as I share my story taking you through how it all started, the journey so far and our future plans! Tune in to Wazobia FM 95.1 FM for the \"I wan work\" show Time: 10am - 10:30am WAT And yes, it's a full pidgin gist. Area!! P.S - I guess my mum was seeing the future after all"
