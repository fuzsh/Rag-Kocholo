        "text": "Even as the focus on the six hospitals intensified Wednesday, officials in Boston and other communities stepped up long-shot campaigns to save two other Steward hospitals, Carney Hospital in Dorchester and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, slated to close by Aug. 31.\n\n“We acknowledge these are pretty dire circumstances,” said state Senator Jamie Eldridge, whose district covers many of the rural communities in north central Massachusetts served by the Nashoba Valley hospital, “which is why we need state government to step up.”\n\nSteward, hospital bidders, and Massachusetts officials are racing to wrap up deals on St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center and five sister hospitals by Friday so the bankrupt system, rapidly running out of money, can access $30 million in state funds. Most of the funding, earmarked for operating capital, is conditioned on buyers inking purchase agreements.\n\nAt the same time, amid mounting community protests, the state Department of Public Health scheduled public hearings next week on Steward’s plan to shutter the Carney and Nashoba Valley hospitals.\n\nA hearing on Carney’s closing was set for Tuesday at 6 p.m. at Florian Hall in Dorchester. A hearing on the shutdown of Nashoba Valley was set for 6 p.m. Thursday at Devens Community Center. Virtual hearings will be held the following days to discuss each of the planned closures.\n\nSteward, which filed for bankruptcy May 6, last month said it planned to shutter the two hospitals by Aug. 31, saying they hadn’t drawn qualified bids. A bankruptcy judge approved that plan last week, despite a state law requiring hospitals to give 120 days’ notice before closing. Steward is selling its other six Massachusetts hospitals to pay off creditors.\n\nThose hospitals — St. Elizabeth’s, Holy Family Hospital in Methuen and Haverhill, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Morton Hospital in Taunton, and St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River — all have potential buyers, which haven’t been identified, but they await a resolution with Apollo on property leases before deals can be completed.\n\nOn Wednesday, meanwhile, the Boston City Council passed a resolution calling on state and city leaders to declare a public health emergency over the impending closure of Carney. Nurses in the City Hall gallery, many holding signs reading “Keep Carney Hospital Open,” erupted into applause.\n\nThe measure urged officials to “take all possible steps necessary to preserve the operations of Carney Hospital,” including seizing the property by eminent domain to keep the hospital running until a permanent operator can take over. Such a move would require the government to pay fair market value to property owners.\n\n“We’re not ready to throw the towel in,” said Councilor John FitzGerald, who co-sponsored the resolution. “We need to float the hospital for a couple of years until we make it profitable again, and so we can get it up and running. But we do need time and we need to overturn every rock we can to buy that time or create the environment to make that deal.”\n\nAt an emergency meeting Tuesday night, Ayer’s Select Board passed a resolution calling on the governor to declare a public health emergency for 15 communities served by the hospital, order it to stay open for the full 120 days, and extend state funding to assist qualified bidders.\n\nA spokesperson for the Healey administration said it’s pressing Steward to follow the 120-day closure process. At the same time, state officials recognize “the hospitals are out of money, patient levels have been low at these hospitals and there is a need to fill open health care roles at other facilities,” the spokesperson said, and were focusing on finalizing purchases that would preserve the other Steward hospitals.\n\nIn a Wednesday letter to Marc Rowan, the Apollo chief executive, Warren and Markey cited the New York firm’s role as the “fulcrum” in long-stalled negotiations to sell the Steward hospitals.\n\n“We ask that you work in good faith with Steward, Massachusetts officials, and other stakeholders to facilitate the sale of the remaining six Steward hospitals in Massachusetts to operators that will continue serving their communities,” the two senators wrote in their letter.\n\nThey also asked Apollo to reply by Sunday to a series of questions, including how much it loaned two previous owners of the hospital properties, how much it collected on its loan, whether loan terms had been modified, what it plans to do with the hospital real estate, and what concessions it’s offered, if any, in hospital sales negotiations.\n\nA spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment on the senators’ letter, citing the “sensitive and confidential nature of the ongoing discussions” with prospective buyers of Steward hospitals.\n\nFor the hospital bidders, a major challenge for months has been negotiating with both Steward, which owns the hospitals’ licenses, and two investment firms that owned its real estate. Steward originally sold the hospitals’ land and buildings for $1.2 billion in 2016 to Medical Properties Trust, an Alabama-based real estate investment trust.\n\nMPT sold a 50 percent interest in its Massachusetts leases to another firm, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners of Australia, in a 2021 deal that netted MPT proceeds of $1.3 billion, including from a debt sale by the partners. The firms formed a joint venture to manage the lease, securing a loan from Apollo that required the landowners to pay mortgages.\n\nThe three companies were often at odds in this summer’s hospital sales negotiations over how to allocate sales proceeds. After bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez nullified a master lease last week because Steward couldn’t make rent payments — and with bidders offering to buy the property or pay deeply discounted rents — MPT and Macquarie walked away from the properties, turning them over to Apollo."
