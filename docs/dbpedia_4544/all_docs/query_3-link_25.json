        "text": "â€‹Because shellfish harvested from polluted water may cause human illness, the sanitary control of the shellfish industry is necessary. Maryland is a member of the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC), a voluntary, cooperative association of states, the shellfish industry, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). State responsibilities include adopting laws and regulations for the sanitary control of shellfish and the shellfish industry, formulating comprehensive shellfish harvesting area surveys and adopting control measures to ensure that shellfish are grown, harvested and processed in a safe and sanitary manner. FDA reviews methods for shellfish sanitation inlcuding for classification and management of shellfish areas proposed by the ISSC, and incorporates those methods consistent with standard health practice into the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) Model Ordinance. FDA is also responsible for the audit of each state shellfish control program to determine conformity with the NSSP standards and guidelines. NOAA and EPA provide technical assistance and comment to the ISSC. The shellfish industry responsibilities include participation in the ISSC Conference, meeting the requirements of the NSSP Model Ordinance. These responsibilities include obtaining shellfish from safe sources, maintaining sanitary operating conditions and making records available that document location of harvest and sale of all shellfish. FDA, MDE and the shellfish industry fulfill their responsibilities to a high degree, thus ensuring shellfish harvested in Maryland are safe and wholesome.\n\nIn Maryland, responsibility for the sanitary control of the shellfish industry is shared by three state agencies: the Department of the Environment (MDE), the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). MDE is responsible for identifying and eliminating pollution sources affecting Maryland's shellfish harvesting waters, as well as classifying shellfish harvesting waters so that shellfish harvested are safe for human consumption. MDH is responsible for any food control measures necessary to ensure that shellfish are harvested, processed, packaged, and transported under sanitary conditions. MDH also regulates shellfish dealers to assure compliance with the required sanitary standards. MDH Laboratories Administration analyzes water samples collected by MDE and samples collected as part of foodborne illness investigations. DNR is responsible for managing the fishery, enforcing sanitary harvesting practices and harvest restrictions, posting areas restricted to shellfish harvesting and for patrolling/enforcing these areas to prevent illegal harvesting.\n\nNSSP/MDE Standard\n\nApproved: (direct harvesting permitted)\n\nMedian <14 MPN/100ml 90th Percentile <49\n\nConditionally Approved (direct harvesting permitted only as outlined under heading Shellfish Water Classification below):\n\nFor conditionally approved Median <14 MPN/100 ml and no more than 10% can exceed 49 when the area is in the open status.\n\nRestricted: (relay required)\n\nMedian <88 MPN/100ml 90th Percentile <300"
