        "text": "Her clean hull lines and wide beam aft are the foundation for the outstanding space and capabilities of the Oyster 495. She incorporates many of our big yacht features in a compact 50 foot yacht. Instantly recognisable as an Oyster, the Oyster 495 features our pioneering deck saloon, protected cockpit and helm stations, wraparound and forward-opening saloon windows. Flush decks, signature triple vertical seascape windows, foredeck skyscape windows, a powerful plumb bow and extended bowsprit complete the look.\n\nWe were the first boat builder to create a truly ergonomically designed cockpit and helm positions, with sprayhood and optional bimini for additional protection. Details like the cockpit table, with optional built-in refrigerated drinks locker, that comfortably seats up to eight people, is just one of the many triumphs of Oyster design thinking.\n\nElectric in-mast furling system\n\nThe in-mast furling system takes automation and effortless shorthanded sailing to another level.\n\nElectric winches\n\nPush-button control with electric Lewmar winches in sleek, black anodised finish.\n\nBathing platform\n\nThe innovative, automated cassette bathing platform is ideal to access ocean swimming, boarding a dinghy or stern access when berthed. It features a sturdy boarding ladder and integrated freshwater shower on the transom steps.\n\nB&G Navigation package\n\nThe standard B&G navigation system displays boat speed, wind and depth information.\n\nMaster cabin with Seascape windows\n\nAn impressive full width owner’s cabin is completed by Oyster’s signature triple Seascape windows. These create a feeling of light and space, with exceptional ocean views.\n\nTouch screen controls\n\nOyster Command™ digital switching system controls everything from on board entertainment and lighting to all your main systems, utilities and security, through touchscreens at the helm and chart table.\n\nWood options\n\nChoose from a selection of wood themed interiors, including shades of sustainable sourced oak and walnut.\n\nExtensive on deck stowage\n\nA full width lazarette and separate sail locker provide ample storage for all your bluewater adventure kit, sails, rigging and mooring gear.\n\nFlush Flexiteak decks\n\nWith a beautiful fine grain teak finish, the sustainable synthetic Flexiteak deck is 30% lighter than traditional teak, extremely hard wearing and retains it look with minimal maintenance.\n\nOpening saloon windows\n\nOyster’s unique, deck saloon forward opening windows provide excellent ventilation, allowing fresh air to circulate freely through the yacht while at anchor or under sail.\n\nDNV GL hull certification\n\nThe build plan of the Oyster 495 hull is certified by DNV GL to ensure the materials and construction reach the highest standards of extreme strength and durability.\n\nShoal keel\n\nTake advantage of shallow-draft cruising grounds and remote anchorages, with a draft of 1.83m / 6’0”.\n\nRetractable bow and stern thrusters\n\nSleipner Side-Power retractable bow and stern thrusters make it simple and safe to manoeuvre in and out of tight marina berths.\n\nEntertainment package\n\nChoose from an optional range of integrated electronic and AV systems to suit your personal preferences.\n\nSaloon day bed\n\nThe multifunction saloon table can be raised and lowered to create a comfortable day bed, perfect to relax on and enjoy the integrated widescreen TV.\n\nHull colours\n\nPersonalise your Oyster 495 with alternative coloured hull, mast and sails. See our colour picker for inspiration.\n\nAir conditioning\n\nKeep the interior at the perfect temperature with air conditioning (and generator) that cools and heats. Controls in each cabin allow guests to adjust the temperature based on their personal requirements.\n\nB&G upgrade package\n\nUpgrade the standard B&G navigation package with the additional instrumentation, communication equipment and autopilot package.\n\nFlush teak decks\n\nExtensive sustainably sourced, quarter-sawn, full-depth teak ensures maximum longevity and lifespan of our hand-laid teak decks. Smooth and natural underfoot, they look stunning.\n\nPushpit seats\n\nFor the best seats aboard, the optional pushpit seats provide great views and the perfect spot for sundowners after a memorable day’s cruising.\n\nWatermaker\n\nEnjoy 100 litres of fresh, homemade water per hour with a reliable Dessalator Duo watermaker with automatic controls and manual override.\n\nDavits\n\nAdd davits to the stern deck for a practical dingy stowage solution when cruising and fast, efficient access when exploring at your destination."
