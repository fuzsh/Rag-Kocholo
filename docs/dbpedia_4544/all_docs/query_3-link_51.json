        "text": "Little Island’s Custodians are key members of the Park Operations department, a dynamic team of collaborative and motivated individuals who collectively care for the park and its visitors. In addition to a beautiful park, Little Island’s facility includes performance spaces, public and indoor restrooms, indoor meeting rooms, staff and artist areas, food stalls, and equipment. Custodians will embody Little Island’s values by collaborating often across departments, jumping in to help solve problems and address immediate park needs, communicating park-related concerns or issues to Park leadership proactively, and fostering memorable visitor experiences and relationships in the park each day. The larger Operations department is also comprised of Park Supervisors, Park Attendants, Security, Maintenance, Horticulture staff, and administrators who work together to operate our park for the public every day.\n\nThe ideal Custodians are hardworking and proactive self-starters who thrive in the outdoors and have experience caretaking a facility or park. Our Custodial team cares deeply about balancing the details of their work with cultivating a memorable visitor experience."
