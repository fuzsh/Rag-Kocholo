Holmes Jr., Lena & Michael Allen’s East Bay Broadcasting have moved the programming of their Classic Rock/Blues/Beach Music “Oyster Radio” from 100.5 WOYS Apalachicola to the bigger signal.\n\nWOYS moves from the 11.5kW Class C3 100.5 signal to the Class C1 100kW 106.5. Both stations operate from the same tower.\n\nThe company intends to launch a new “Beach Music” format on what is now 100.5 WOCY. Unlike the R&B oriented “Beach Music” of the Carolinas, the regional sub-genre here is also known as “Trop-Rock” is a mix of Rock and Caribbean musical styles in the vein of artists like Jimmy Buffett."
