        "text": "The Scottish variety is challenging enough, but Uilleann pipes are in a class by themselves. They are difficult to obtain, harder to maintain and nearly impossible to play. Indeed, Uilleann piping is so intimately linked with frustration and suffering that players consider themselves initiates in what approaches a religion. According to tradition, it takes “seven years’ listening, seven years’ practicing and seven years’ playing to make a piper,” but the reward is mastery of a difficult physical skill, plus the experience of creating one’s own musical nirvana. The sound is something like an oboe, something like a bassoon, and, when all the various parts are used, like several of each playing at once. Even after 21 years, though, the suffering is not over.\n\n— Michael D. Lemonick, Time, 16 Mar. 1987\n\nBy the time Nirvana recorded their performance for MTV Unplugged in November 1993, they were the biggest band in the world. Not that they looked like it. Dave Grohl in his turtleneck and ponytail, Krist Novoselic wrangling his giant, borrowed bass, Kurt Cobain struggling to act relaxed in a room filled with people who thought he was a prophet.\n\n— Mike Powell, Pitchfork, 24 Feb. 2019\n\nThe stones in her bracelets ranged from saffron to palest yellow, but it was the bangle composed entirely of buttery golden stones with fiery orange hearts that captured Yoshi's gaze.\n\n— Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff, Analog Science Fiction & Fact, Volume 130 (2010)\n\nThe Bangles’ garage-band philosophy puts them in the company of a number of other '60s-inspired L.A. groups … but on this delightful album they avoid the revivalist trap with their solid songwriting and some of the best harmonies since the Mamas and the Papas.\n\n— Mikel Toombs, The San Diego Union-Tribune, 2 Sep. 1984\n\n“Wilco,” Boyden said. “Wilco. Out.” He was speaking in Naval parlance acknowledging an order. His voice was like a hundred other voices that Briggs had heard on the radio speaker at sea, and there was the same finality and the same incisiveness in that word ‘out’ that meant those voices were gone, perhaps forever.\n\n— John P. Marquand, Harper’s Magazine, Nov. 1945\n\nWilco. Remember the name. Or don’t. It doesn’t matter. Either way, the rootsy group from Chicago, Minneapolis and Nashville is the best new band in America, as they proved with a Saturday night set at Liberty Lunch…\n\n— Michael Corcoran, The Dallas Morning News, 20 Mar. 1995\n\nEven on the lakes, where alone we had squadrons, everything, from laying the keel of the vessels to firing the last gun before the enemy surrendered, was left to the young commodores in command.\n\n— James Russell Soley, Scribner’s Magazine, February 1887\n\nThe Commodores—all six of them college graduates—run a machine: a coolly efficient, meticulously planned business that controls everything from tours to merchandising and operates according to group mottos. Of course, this business also makes hit records, and good ones. After Motown signed them in 1972, the Commodores refused any advances, held out for two years against the company’s choice of material and producers, and finally released a terrific, funk album, Machine Gun.\n\nSteve Pond, The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec), 25 Sep. 1980\n\nAlso important in early Soviet theater was the Anthroposophical concept of eurythmy (not to be confused with Jacques Dalcroze’s eurythmics). Both systems stress rhythmic bodily movements, but eurythmics was a system of musical education, whereas eurythmy was said to express cosmic verities.\n\n— Bernice Glazer Rosenthal, “Introduction,” The Occult in Russian and Soviet Culture (Cornell University Press, 1997)\n\nFurther evidence of David Bowie’s apparently never-ending influence on contemporary rock styles was offered at the Ritz on Thursday, where the Eurythmics, the successful British techno-pop duo, made their New York debut. Consisting of the singer, songwriter and flutist Annie Lennox and the guitarist and singer David Stewart, the Eurythmics were augmented by a strong rhythm section, a keyboardist and elaborate pre-recorded sound effects.\n\n—Stephen Holden, The New York Times, 17 July 1983\n\nDuring REM sleep, neurons that permit the dream-inducing neurons to buzz with activity are themselves out of action. Normally, they are involved in attention and self-awareness. Hartmann suggests that this dormancy may explain why people remember better in their dreams than they do while awake: with the attention-paying neurons off, remote memories are unusually accessible. But once awake, some 95 percent of dreams vanish.\n\n— Sharon Begley, Newsweek, 1989\n\nR. E. M., a Georgia band whose debut album, “Murmur” (A & M), reached the top 50 this summer, has given folk-rock a complete overhaul. R. E. M. laces its songs with folky electric guitar licks, yet turns folk-rock’s innocence upside down by pushing tempos, mumbling lyrics and breaking down folk-rock’s simple verses and choruses into a rush of melodies and images.\n\n— Jon Pareles, The New York Times, 18 Sep. 1983\n\nA gray morning, the deck wet, the iron all beaded with frost, all the longshoremen in heavy pea-jackets or cardigans, the whole ship in a bustle, and the favored first-class passengers just leaving.\n\n— Edward Everett Hale, The Brick Moon and Other Stories (Little, Brown, and Company 1899, orig. copyright 1869)\n\nWhen singer Nina Persson and keyboardist Lars-Olof Johansson of the Swedish band the Cardigans discuss their craft, passion fills the air. The group, which performs at sold-out shows tonight and Friday at the El Rey Theatre, takes its job seriously. “For me, being called kitsch is the worst thing we could be accused of,” says the soft-spoken Persson, addressing a misconception about the group’s goals that's so widespread it even appears in the record company’s official band biography. “We feel very sincere about what we do. We are burning with music,” Persson reaffirms.\n\n— Elysa Gardner, The Los Angeles Times, 20 Feb. 1997\n\nShe gathered the little madcap into her arms for one second, then taking the witch-like face in both hands kissed each flushed cheek as she said: “I sometimes think you claim kinship with the pixies, you are half a witch. So you accept the bargain? Good! Have all the fun you wish but don’t burn the house down.”\n\n— Gabrielle E. Jackson, Peggy Stewart at School (The Goldsmith Publishing Company, 1918)\n\nThough the album title obliquely refers to the kindly Doctor D., the only animals the Pixies talk to are the shadowy ones that lurk inside us. Singer Black Francis, a fan of director David Lynch, writes unnerving lyrics worthy of “Eraserhead.” Listeners who merely want to dance can latch on to one of Kim Deal’s larger-than-life bass lines, or hitch a ride on a runaway train: Joey Santiago’s wild, churning guitar. With 15 thrill-a-minute songs, “Doolittle” is destined to be one of 1989’s best albums.\n\n— Greg Kot, The Chicago Tribune, 11 May 1989\n\n“Oh my own pretty darling sweet Miss Floy!” cried the Nipper, running into Florence’s room, “to think that it should come to this and I should find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and no home to call your own but never never will I go away again Miss Floy for though I may not gather moss I’m not a rolling stone nor is my heart a stone or else it wouldn’t bust as it is busting now oh dear oh dear!”\n\n— Charles Dickens, Dombey and Son (Bradbury & Evans, 1848)\n\nThe Rolling Stones’ relation to pop right now is like Shakespeare’s to cyberpunk fiction: the influence is there because it’s everywhere, but in specific terms, it is centuries removed. The Stones know this. That’s why their new album, “Bridges to Babylon” (Virgin), updates their classic blues-rock style rather than jumping on new trends.\n\n—Ann Powers, The New York Times, 18 Oct. 1997"
