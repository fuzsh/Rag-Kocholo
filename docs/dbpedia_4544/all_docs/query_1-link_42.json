        "text": "There’s nothing quite like taking in live music or theater in the great outdoors, especially in NYC’s gorgeous parks. More often than not, these al fresco shows are free and that’s the case with Little Island’s Glade Series, which kicks off on July 10.\n\nThe fairly new 2-acre venue, which opened in 2021 as NYC’s first “floating” park, announced earlier this summer that it’d have a summer lineup of star-studded performances, including nine commissioned world premieres of live performances across music, dance, theater, opera, comedy, jazz, pop and funk.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Childish Gambino is performing a one-night-only concert on Little Island this weekend\n\nFrom July 10 to 14, the Glade Series will feature a concert each night that will be paired with a conversation between Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks and an expert of some kind. “Greens & Blues” will feature blues legend Ruthie Foster and a talk between Parks and Majora Carter, author and urban revitalization consultant, designer Daisy Wang, freestyle emcee Corey James Gray, Columbia astronomy professor Jane Huang, harpist Brandee Younger and historian Eric Foner. Parks will also put on a Psychedelic Soap Box—a post-bop jazz collective with spoken word. Then on June 13, she’ll do one of her “Watch Me Work” sessions, where she holds a creative writing workshop and discussion, with a special guest, then she’ll perform with her band Sula & the Joyful Noise.\n\nOther performances will include dancer Melissa Toogood between July 17 and 21; cabaret from Mx Justin Vivian Bond from July 24 to 28; comedy from acts such as Morgan Jay, Jay Jurden, Neel Gosh, and Sarah Tollemache between August 7 and 11; and a show about the world’s most linguistically diverse city with the Endangered Language Alliance and speakers from endangered, Indigenous, and minority languages alongside poetry, music, and movement. There will be a multilingual soundscape using sounds from more than one hundred languages and visuals from ELA’s digital landscape map and creative translanguaging translation strategies.\n\nInterestingly, Little Island will also host an Oyster Market with local vendors, July 31-August 4, curated and overseen by New Amsterdam Market’s founder. There will be live oyster shucking and an The Oyster Radio Hour in The Amph.\n\nLater on, August 21-25, Grammy Award-winning artist Cécile McLorin Salvant will curate performances that include jazz vocalist Vanisha Gould, folk artist June McDoom, multi-instrumentalist Lua Noah, pianist Sullivan Fortner, and more.\n\nFinally, from August 28 to September 1, Gio Escobar will host a series of concerts, including a bomba and a salsa night, before taking the stage with his own avant-garde collective, “Standing on the Corner.”\n\nHere’s the full lineup at Little Island:\n\nTHE GLADE SERIES\n\nJULY 10-14 / SUZAN-LORI PARKS: \"Tell Me More\"\n\nA series of performances and conversation curated and hosted by Pulitzer Prize-winner Suzan-Lori Parks.
