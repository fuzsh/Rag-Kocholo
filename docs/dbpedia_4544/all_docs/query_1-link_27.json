        "text": "TALLAHASSEE – Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) officials remind residents and visitors to stay alert and use caution at the beach this week, as an elevated risk of rip currents is expected along the Florida Panhandle through the weekend. A moderate to high risk of rip currents is expected from Escambia to Franklin County through Sunday, July 28.\n\n“Weather conditions may begin to improve this weekend, but beachgoers and boaters should still remember to use caution when enjoying the water,” said FDEM Deputy State Meteorologist Tiffany Hersey. “The high rip current risk is expected to continue through the weekend due to onshore winds combined with the recent disturbed weather pattern.”\n\nA rip current is a narrow, powerful current of water that runs perpendicular to the beach, out into the ocean. Visitors and Floridians are reminded to visit www.ripcurrents.noaa.gov for updates on rip current warnings before heading to the beach and to observe beach warning flags. When a red flag is flying, beachgoers should remain alert.\n\nWhen at the beach:\n\nBefore you leave for the beach, check the latest National Weather Service forecast for local beach conditions. Many offices issue a surf zone forecast.\n\nObey all instructions and orders from lifeguards. Lifeguards are trained to identify hazards.\n\nKnow the meaning of and obey warnings represented by colored beach flags.\n\nDifferent beaches may use different colors but a commonly used series include:\n\nDouble Red: beach is closed to the public\n\nSingle Red: high hazard, e.g., strong surf or currents\n\nYellow: medium hazard\n\nGreen: calm conditions although caution is still necessary\n\nPurple: flown with either red or yellow: dangerous marine life\n\nStay at least 100 feet away from piers and jetties. Permanent rip currents often exist alongside these structures.\n\nPay especially close attention to children and persons who are elderly when at the beach. Even in shallow water, wave action can cause loss of footing.\n\nBe cautious. Always assume rip currents are present even if you don’t see them.\n\nIf caught in a rip current:\n\nDON’T PANIC. Remain calm to conserve energy and think clearly.\n\nNEVER swim against the rip. Stay afloat and signal for help.\n\nSwim out of the current in a direction following the shoreline. When out of the current, swim at an angle--away from the current--towards shore.\n\nIf you are unable to swim out of the rip current, float or calmly tread water.\n\nDraw attention to yourself: face the shore, wave your arms, and yell for help.\n\nIf you see someone in trouble, don't become a victim too:\n\nGet help from a lifeguard or, if one is unavailable, have someone call 9-1-1.\n\nThrow the rip current victim something that floats--a lifejacket, a cooler, an inflatable ball.\n\nYell instructions on how to escape.\n\nPractice Safe Boating:\n\nCheck forecasts well ahead of time.\n\nBe sure everyone aboard is wearing a life jacket.\n\nIf caught in a thunderstorm, go below deck if possible, and stay away from masts or ungrounded metal objects.\n\nHave a VHF marine band radio on board.\n\nKnow the limitations of your boat. If small craft advisories or gale warnings are issued, you should postpone travel.\n\nFor more information about emergency response in Florida, the 2013 Hurricane Season, and how you can to Get A Plan! visit FloridaDisaster.org.

An estimated $29 million of damage was caused to infrastructure across Panhandle communities when heavy rain fell the first week of July.\n\n“The amount of rainfall caused significant damage to communities in the Florida Panhandle. Counties received damage which totals more than four times the county’s budget for roadway infrastructure for an entire year,” said Florida Division of Emergency Management Director (FDEM), Bryan W. Koon. “I am confident the federal government understands the financial impact this has on these communities and the importance of federal assistance to aid in the recovery.”\n\nBay, Holmes, Okaloosa, Walton and Washington counties received significant damage to homes, roadways, and infrastructure due to the rainfall received. Joint Preliminary Damage Assessments were conducted with representatives from the counties, the State and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The estimated damage in the five county area totals $29,862,883.40. In Florida, the damage threshold for federal disaster relief assistance is $25,757,794.70.\n\nFEMA will review Governor Scott’s request and advise President Obama on next steps. If a declaration is made, Public Assistance would be granted to the declared counties. FEMA’s Public Assistance program provides grant assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures, as well as costs for repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly-owned facilities.\n\nAreas of the Florida Panhandle received over twelve inches of rain between July 2-7. Walton and Washington Counties received nearly 20 inches of rain. Rivers in the Florida Panhandle reached flood stage, including the Choctawhatchee River in Walton County, which reached major flood stage.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Governor, FDEM Director Koon directed the State Emergency Response Team (SERT) to support the affected counties from the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC), in accordance with the State of Florida’s emergency plan. Members of the SERT were deployed to assist the affected counties and to ensure a coordinated response to, and recovery from, this event.\n\nFor more information about emergency response in Florida, the 2013 Hurricane Season, and how you can Get A Plan! visitFloridaDisaster.org.
