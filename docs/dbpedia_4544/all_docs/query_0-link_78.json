Send me a reply, and we‚Äôll set something up!\n\nI‚Äôll be speaking at Hotjar‚Äôs HOTSAUCE conference, which I highly recommend attending ‚Äî you can get a discount by using KEVAN-LEE when you register. I‚Äôll be speaking about the power of creativity in marketing. It‚Äôll be good! (once I actually write it out)\n\nWishing you a great week ahead,\n\nKevan\n\n(·µî·¥•·µî)\n\nThank you for being part of this newsletter. Each week, I share playbooks, case studies, stories, and links from inside the startup marketing world and my time at Oyster, Buffer, and more.\n\nSay hi anytime at hello@kevanlee.com. I‚Äôd love to hear from you.\n\n10 Favorite Storytelling Frameworks to Boost Your Marketing, Your Ideas, and Your Influence\n\nAs I‚Äôve been preparing for my HOTSAUCE conference talk, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the best way to express ideas on stage. Turns out, the answers are quite similar to how I best express ideas at work or on websites or in headlines or when managing up.\n\nStories are such a central part of our marketing jobs and our marketing careers. Jobs-wise, stories underpin our entire brand strategy (see more here).\n\nAnd with careers, the stories we tell about ourselves and the stories we tell to others can make a huge difference in how we feel and where we fit.\n\nOver the years, I‚Äôve picked up a few favorite frameworks that I‚Äôve used to good effect in the day-to-day marketing work of strategy-setting and copywriting and in the leadership work of presenting ideas to crowds and C-suites. Here are my Top Ten.\n\n1 - DIBBs\n\nD - Data\n\nI - Insight\n\nB - Belief\n\nB - Bet\n\nSpotify popularized this framework within its product team when it came to setting strategy and making arguments. I‚Äôve adopted it as a high-level framework for the strategic documents that I write for my teams.\n\nBasically, I start my marketing strategy documents (like this one) with a review of the most critical data for my team. From that data, I‚Äôm then able to draw insights that will inform the strategies that I set ‚Äî and buy me some credibility with leadership, who love data-backed insights. The core of my strategy document is then my beliefs (the strategic pillars) and my bets (the tactics within the strategies).\n\n2 - Minto pyramid\n\nStart with the answer, then explain your reasoning\n\nPeople are busy. Executives are busy. Your customers are busy. That‚Äôs why the Minto Pyramid can be so effective because you cut right to the chase: Give people the answer before you get into all the rationale and reasoning behind the answer.\n\n3 - Before ‚Äì After ‚Äì Bridge\n\nBefore ‚Äì Here‚Äôs your world ‚Ä¶\n\nAfter ‚Äì Imagine what it‚Äôd be like, having Problem A solved ‚Ä¶\n\nBridge ‚Äì Here‚Äôs how to get there.\n\nWe used this one all the time at Buffer when we wrote the intros to blog posts. You describe a problem, describe a world where that problem doesn‚Äôt exist, then explain how to get there. I\n\n4 - Problem ‚Äì Agitate ‚Äì Solve\n\nIdentify a problem\n\nAgitate the problem\n\nSolve the problem\n\nCopyblogger calls this formula the key to dominating social media. It‚Äôs the Rosetta Stone for copywriting. It‚Äôs ubiquitous in marketing copy and headline writing. And you can see its influence on so many other storytelling formulas ‚Äî for instance, with Before-After-Bridge, instead of describing a life without the problem (the ‚ÄúAfter‚Äù part), PAS describes life if the problem were to persist (the ‚ÄúAgitate‚Äù part).\n\n5 - Features ‚Äì Advantages ‚Äì Benefits (FAB)\n\nFeatures ‚Äì What you or your product can do\n\nAdvantages ‚Äì Why this is helpful\n\nBenefits ‚Äì What it means for the person reading\n\nMost marketing storytellers have heard the advice (or given the advice) to focus on benefits, not features ‚Äî on Mario‚Äôs fireball-throwing superpower, not the fireball flower. This formula can be a helpful reminder of how to get yourself from a feature-heavy story to a benefits-heavy one.\n\n6 - The 4 C‚Äôs\n\nClear\n\nConcise\n\nCompelling\n\nCredible\n\nNot so much a formula as rules to live by. In marketing and in life!\n\n7 - The 4 U‚Äôs\n\nUseful ‚Äì Be useful to the reader\n\nUrgent ‚Äì Provide a sense of urgency\n\nUnique ‚Äì Convey the idea that the main benefit is somehow unique\n\nUltra-specific ‚Äì Be ultra-specific with all of the above\n\nI particularly love that this one calls out being ‚Äúultra-specific,‚Äù since that can be such a differentiator amidst the noise of social media and the flood of copywriting.\n\n8 - Attention ‚Äì Interest ‚Äì Desire ‚Äì Action (AIDA)\n\nAttention ‚Äì Get the reader‚Äôs attention\n\nInterest ‚Äì Interesting and fresh information that appeals to the reader\n\nDesire ‚Äì Benefits of your product/service/idea and proof that it does what you say\n\nAction ‚Äì Ask for a response\n\nAIDA has been around foreverrrrr. It‚Äôs been used for direct mail, television and radio, sales pages, landing pages, and so much more. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it!\n\n9 - A FOREST\n\nA ‚Äì Alliteration\n\nF ‚Äì Facts\n\nO ‚Äì Opinions\n\nR ‚Äì Repetition\n\nE ‚Äì Examples\n\nS ‚Äì Statistics\n\nT ‚Äì Threes (Repeat something three times to make it memorable.)\n\nThis is a favorite one of mine because it‚Äôs fun to recall as an acronym, and it has aseveral unique reminders inside of how to tell effective stories ‚Äî for example, repetition, stats, and the rule of three (there, I just used the rule of three without even meaning to).\n\n10 - The Fan Dancer\n\nBe specific without actually explaining anything\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúfan dancer‚Äù? Well, it‚Äôs nothing really. But did it make me want to read more to find out what it is? Sure! This is the entire point of this storytelling style ‚Äî use specific details to create curiosity and get someone to keep reading, keep clicking, or keep listening to find out more.\n\nExample:\n\nBONUS: OATH Formula\n\nThese are the four stages of your market‚Äôs awareness of your product/service/idea.\n\nOblivious\n\nApathetic\n\nThinking\n\nHurting\n\nHaving spent many years in category creation mode, I can definitely vouch for the idea that certain audiences will be oblivious to what you‚Äôre selling, and you need to give them a very different story than you do to those who are thinking or hurting.\n\nAbout this newsletter ‚Ä¶\n\nHi, I‚Äôm Kevan, a marketing exec based in Boise, Idaho, who specializes in startup marketing and brand-building.
