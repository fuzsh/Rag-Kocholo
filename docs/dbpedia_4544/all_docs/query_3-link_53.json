        "text": "Plan Your Wilderness Trip Here!\n\nStarting January 2, 2023, all Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness campsites will only be available for advanced reservations on Recreation.gov. There will no longer be campsites held as \"walk-up.\" Campsites will be open for reservations 90 days in advance. Rangers can still assist campers in booking an unreserved site on the day of their trip. This change allows campers to independently plan their wilderness camping itinerary. It also removes the need to travel to the visitor center to purchase \"walk-up\" sites. For questions about the Flamingo District please contact the Guy Bradley Visitor Center. For the Gulf Coast District, please call 239-232-0057.\n\nSafely exploring a wilderness by water requires careful preparation and planning. Use this page as a guide to camping in the coastal portions of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness. If you require assistance planning your trip, call or stop by the Flamingo Visitor Center or call 239-232-0057.\n\nQuestions on Permits and Reservations? Visit the Wilderness Reservations and Permits Frequently Asked Questions page.\n\nSee park alerts for COVID-19 closures and updates.\n\nSafely exploring a wilderness by water requires careful preparation and planning. If you require assistance planning your trip, call or stop by the Flamingo Visitor Center or call 239-232-0057.\n\nSeasons\n\nBecause of the heat, severe storms, and intolerable numbers of mosquitoes, summer (June – October) is not the best time of year for a wilderness trip. The winter months (December – April) tend to be more pleasant.\n\nObtain Charts\n\nNautical charts are necessary for finding your way in the wilderness and are useful in planning your trip. Charts may be purchased at the Coe Visitor Center, Flamingo Adventures (Marina Store), or ordered from the Florida National Parks Association. Some sites are not indicated with a tent symbol on nautical charts. Consult visitor center maps before departure.\n\nRoutes\n\nPossibilities are unlimited for overnight wilderness trip routes from Flamingo or Gulf Coast. Refer to maps, nautical charts, and guide books.\n\nThe 99-mile Wilderness Waterway attracts interest because it connects Flamingo and Everglades City. Most paddlers allow at least eight days to complete the trip. This route is recommended for experienced paddlers only. Arrange in advance for a vehicle shuttle. There are many areas of very shallow water that may be encountered along the Wilderness Waterway. Powerboats over 18' long may have to detour around Alligator and Plate Creeks. The “Nightmare” and Broad Creek are passable only to paddlers at high tide. To prevent prop dredging, which results in increased turbidity and the destruction of submerged natural features, boats with drafts of two feet or more, including the propellor, should not use the waterway.\n\nBe Realistic\n\nTides and winds can make paddling difficult. Most experienced paddlers plan to travel between 8 and 12 miles per day. Adverse conditions may reduce your speed to one mile an hour or less. Boaters are expected to know their own abilities, be able to use charts, understand tides and weather, and make appropriate decisions in selecting an itinerary. This is a wilderness.\n\nThe wilderness of Everglades National Park is very different from other places you may have boated, paddled, or camped. It can be confusing and difficult to navigate as the mazes of mangrove–lined creeks and bays all begin to look the same. With proper planning, you can avoid the frustration and hours wasted from getting lost.\n\nIf this is your first wilderness trip in the Everglades, ease into it with a one or two night trip instead of jumping into a several night Wilderness Waterway excursion.\n\nFrom the Flamingo area, camp along the marked Hell's Bay Canoe Trail at either the Pearl Bay or Hell's Bay Chickees. Or follow the shore of Florida Bay to camp on the beach at East Cape Sable.\n\nAll park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee and obtain a park pass. Money collected is used to directly improve visitor experiences and assist with the cost of providing safe, meaningful experiences to park visitors.\n\nPre-paid digital passes may be purchased online before entering the park and displayed on a mobile device or printed out.\n\nEntrance passes may also be purchased at the Homestead and Shark Valley entrance stations. Digital passes or credit cards are preferred at all fee collection areas. Entrance passes are non-transferable.\n\nWilderness permits are required for all overnight camping, except in drive-in campgrounds or when sleeping aboard boats.\n\nCampers can make advanced reservations through Recreation.gov. Advanced reservations are available on a rolling basis, three months in advance of the start date.\n\nYour Recreation.gov confirmation email will serve as your permit. Please print a copy or save a digital copy of your reservation and carry that with you during your trip. You are no longer required to pick up a physical permit.\n\nThere is a $21 administrative fee plus an additional $2 per person, per night use fee. The costs will apply for advanced reservations and walk-up permits year-round. A credit card is needed for both online and in-person permit reservations.\n\nFlamingo Visitor Center:\n\n8:00 am to 4:30 pm daily;\n\n(239) 695-2945\n\nGulf Coast Visitor Center:\n\nClosed for construction\n\n(239) 232-0057\n\nThe limit for number of nights at a campsite applies to the peak use season from mid-November through late April. Campsite capacities apply year-round, and are subject to change. Campsites must be vacated by noon. Specific details on campsites can be found in the chart on the bottom of the page.\n\nAll beach sites have shallow water approach; motor boats use caution.\n\nAt all beach sites, camp on the sand along the shoreline only. No clearing of vegetation or camping in the interior.\n\nNails and stakes are not allowed to be driven into any chickees or the Lostman’s Five platform. Use a freestanding tent.\n\nSome ground sites may have a picnic table.\n\nTypes of Sites\n\nChickee Sites: Chickees are located along rivers and bays where dry land is inaccessible. They are elevated 10' x 12' wooden platforms with roofs. A walkway leads to a self-contained toilet. You'll need a free-standing tent, since stakes or nails are not allowed. No campfires are allowed on chickees. Some paddlers have difficulty accessing chickees from their boats. A loop of heavy rope may be helpful.\n\nGround Sites: Ground sites are mounds of earth a few feet higher than the surrounding mangroves, located along interior bays and rivers. They tend to have more insects than chickees or beach sites. No campfires are allowed on ground sites. Use gas grills or stoves. Wood, charcoal, or coal-fueled grills or stoves are not permitted.\n\nBeach Sites: Beach sites are located on the coast. During ideal conditions, insects may be scarce, but always be prepared for mosquitoes and no-see-ums (tiny biting insects), especially at sunrise and sunset. Gulf waters at beach sites can become rough; seas can exceed 3 feet. Low tides often expose large mud flats, which may make beach access difficult. Campfires must be below high-tide line. Sand beaches are often stabilized by tall, grassy plants called sea oats. Take care not to damage them. Sea turtles and crocodiles nest on beaches in late spring and summer. Avoid camping or building a fire where nesting evidence exists. Many beach sites have no toilets. Bury human waste at least six inches below the surface, away from shorelines and tent sites. Urinate directly in the water.\n\nLooking for Solitude?\n\nChoose a single chickee, a campsite with a smaller capacity, or camp far from others on the long stretches of Cape Sable beaches. You can often experience solitude at a beach site. But be prepared for a primitive camping experience—there are no toilets or tables at most beach sites in the wilderness of Everglades National Park.\n\nPaddlers: remember that motorboats are allowed in most areas of the wilderness, including the Wilderness Waterway.\n\nInside Everglades National Park: Rentals are available at the southern end of the park at the Flamingo marina: www.flamingoeverglades.com.\n\nOutside Everglades National Park: Local guide, outfitter, and shuttle services are available. Search the internet for companies.\n\nFlorida National Parks Association: You may find it helpful to purchase the charts you will need in advance, in addition to other trip planning literature. These items can be purchased by phone, on-line, or mail from the Florida National Parks Association. Proceeds from sales support educational programs in Everglades National Park. Learn more: https://floridanationalparksassociation.com/.\n\nFees: All paddlers/boaters recreating in the park, whether on land or on water, must have paid the entrance fee (available online and at the Homestead or Shark Valley entrance stations) and have either a digital or physical copy of the pass with them. Learn more.\n\nProtected Resources : All artifacts, plants, and animals (including sea-shells) are protected in Everglades National Park; it is prohibited to collect or disturb them.\n\nPets: Pets are not permitted at backcountry campsites, beaches, or ashore anywhere in the wilderness. Pets can disrupt feeding, nesting, and mating activities of wildlife.\n\nWildlife: Do not feed any animals, regardless of whether they have feet, fins, or feathers. It is illegal. Do not approach wildlife so closely that it interrupts their natural behavior. Enjoy the diverse wildlife, but from a safe distance. Do not leave food unattended. Store food & trash in a secure compartment aboard a vessel or in a hard–sided cooler (not foam). Raccoons and rodents are aggressive and may chew through plastic water jugs, tents, dry bags, etc.\n\nWater : There is no fresh water available anywhere along the coastal portions of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness. You must bring all of your drinking and cooking water. As a minimum, plan on bringing one gallon of water per person, per day. Hard-sided containers should be used, as raccoons often chew through soft-sided containers (such as “milk jugs”) to get to your drinking water. In addition to ruining your trip, when raccoons get your drinking water, it allows artificially large numbers of them to survive in a given area. In the summer, sea turtles nesting on these same remote Everglades beaches lay their eggs, only to have over 90% of the nests destroyed by the hungry raccoons. Don’t upset the balance of nature. Keep all water and food away from park wildlife.\n\nFires : Fires are not permitted at ground sites or chickees. Fires are only allowed at designated “beach” sites. Build fires below the highest tide line. Use only dead and downed wood. No cutting of standing dead trees. Remove all traces of fires before leaving site.\n\nStove/Cooking : With the exception of fires on designated “beach” sites (Campsite Information Section), all cooking, heating, etc. must be done with devices that will not produce any ash or a spark or ember that is capable of igniting vegetation. Wood, charcoal, or coal-fueled grills, stoves or devices are not permitted.\n\nWeapons and Fireworks : Possession of firearms in Everglades National Park follows State of Florida regulations. Fireworks are prohibited.\n\nPortable Motors :Generators, chain saws and other portable motors are prohibited at all backcountry sites.\n\nHuman Waste : Use toilets where provided. Do not dispose of moist towelettes in toilets. If there is no toilet, dig a hole at least six inches deep and cover it after use. Pack out toilet paper. At beach and coastal ground sites, urinate directly in the water. To avoid soap pollution, wash dishes (and yourself) away from waterways and sprinkle the gray water over the ground to soak in.\n\nTrash : Carry out all your trash; do not bury, burn, or dispose of it in toilets. Use toilets where provided, for human waste only. Do not throw baby wipes, disposable wet/wash cloths, or insect repellent cloths in toilets. International laws prohibit dumping trash at sea.\n\nFishing Regulations : Park fishing regulations are available from visitor centers or on the park’s website. A state fishing license is required; purchase one before you come to the park from area bait and marine supply stores. You may also obtain a fishing license by calling 1-888-347-4356.\n\nClosed Areas : All keys (islands) in Florida Bay are closed to landing, except Bradley Key (open sunrise to sunset), and those designated as campsites. In Florida Bay, the mainland from Terrapin Point to U.S. 1 is closed to landing. The western shore of Hog Key and the interior of Pavilion Key are closed to protect vulnerable resources. Other areas may close temporarily to protect wildlife.\n\nSleeping on Board : If you sleep aboard a vessel, anchor out of sight of chickees and ¼ mile from other sites.\n\nVessels : All vessels must conform to Coast Guard regulations. Air boats and personal watercraft (jet skis) are prohibited.\n\nPlanning ahead is extremely important while visiting the backcountry. Be sure to review the paddler's checklist as well to help you be prepared.\n\nImportant Supplies : Carry fresh water (1 gallon/person/day), compass, nautical charts, anchor, sunscreen, sunglasses, rain gear, mosquito repellent or bug jacket, and tent (with insect netting).\n\nFloat Plan : File a float plan with a friend or relative before leaving home, and call that person when you finish your trip. If you do not call by the pre-determined time, that person should notify the park’s 24-hour dispatch at (305) 242-7740.\n\nTides : Beware of swift currents and tides when securing vessels overnight; tidal ranges can exceed four feet in some locations. Beach canoes above high tide line and tie down or anchor from three points at landings/docks. Use tides to your advantage in travel. Tide tables are available at the Flamingo Visitor Center or on-line.\n\nWinds & Weather : Numerous canoes, kayaks, and boats have been swamped by rough seas on windy days. Thunderstorms occur frequently in summer. Hurricane season is June through November. Be prepared for sudden wind and weather changes at any time.\n\nBoating Safely : Paddlers will encounter powerboats. If you are in a narrow river or pass, and a boat approaches, pull as far to the side as possible, point the bow of your canoe or kayak into the boat’s wake, and stop paddling until the boat passes. Powerboaters: reduce speed in narrow channels; Idle past paddlers and give them plenty of space; approach last 100 yards of any backcountry campsite at idle speed to avoid prop dredging and excessive wave action.\n\nIf You’re In Trouble: Stay with your vessel near a navigational marker or campsite. Set anchor immediately. Try to attract the attention of other boaters. If you have a marine radio, transmit on channel 16. Try calling (305) 242-7740 on your cell phone, but do not count on cell phone coverage.\n\nLearn more about boating safely in the backcountry of Everglades National Park.\n\nBoater Education Program: Nearly everyone* (see boating page for exceptions) operating a powerboat within the marine waters of the park must take the Boater Education Course and carry the certificate with them while operating a vessel in the park. Learn more.\n\nManatees : Manatees frequent many of the waterways in Everglades National Park. Because they are slow-moving and feed in shallow water, many manatees are killed each year by boats. Be especially careful in areas posted with manatee signs. If you see an injured or dead manatee, please report it to park dispatch at (305) 242-7740.\n\nWhat’s back there? : Remember to secure everything in your boat before heading home. Valuable items including fishing poles, life vests, seat cushions, coolers, and clothing often blow out of boats and are found along the roads. Garbage left in boats also finds its way to the roadsides. Please help keep south Florida national parks litter–free!\n\nBoat Wisely : Boating in Florida Bay and the Everglades backcountry can be a challenge. Much of the water is quite shallow, and you can ground your boat quickly. In addition to damaging your boat, groundings destroy precious seagrasses and benthic communities that provide food and shelter to creatures inhabiting these waters. Always refer to nautical charts and tide charts for a safe boating excursion. When in doubt, go with someone familiar with the area. For information on boating in Florida Bay, see the Florida Bay Map & Guide.\n\nKeep Track of Where You Are : A nautical chart and compass are your best equipment for staying on route, finding your designated campsite, and returning safely. GPS (global positioning systems) and cell phones are also helpful, but do not rely primarily on this technology to navigate in the backcountry. Batteries may die, equipment may get lost or malfunction, and satellite and cell phone coverage may be spotty at best.\n\n\"Wilderness is an anchor to windward. Knowing it is there, we can also know that we are stilla rich nation, tending our resources as we should—not a people in despair searching every last nook and cranny of our land for a board of lumber, a barrel of oil, a blade of grass, or a tank of water.\"\n\nSenator Clinton P. Anderson, 1963\n\nWilderness in Everglades National Park\n\nEverglades National Park contains the largest designated wilderness east of the Rocky Mountains. A wilderness is defined as an area “where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.” Established in 1978 and named for the Everglades’ most famous champion, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness is comprised of 1,296,500 acres—most of Everglades National Park!\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nWilderness ethics dictate that visitors to the area try to leave no trace of their passage. The seven Leave No Trace principles will help you get the most out of your wilderness experience, and help you to preserve the park’s unique values for other visitors, both today and in the future.\n\nPlan Ahead and Prepare\n\nTravel and Camp on Durable Surfaces\n\nDispose of Waste Properly\n\nLeave What You Find\n\nMinimize Campfire Impacts\n\nRespect Wildlife\n\nBe Considerate of Other Visitors\n\nLearn more at: www.LNT.org."
