        "text": "When the Tallahassee Beer Society was founded in July 2017 on the legs of nothing more than a single Twitter account, our focus was simple: cover and report on Tallahassee's five major breweries at the time: Proof, Lake Tribe, Deep, Ology and GrassLands — the latter of which is sadly no longer a part of our scene, having closed in July 2019.\n\nWe felt it was best to focus our attention on Tallahassee's breweries being that we were the \"Tallahassee\" Beer Society, but there was an elephant in the room as soon as we started this group: What do we do about Oyster City Brewing Company in Apalachicola — a craft brewery that had a strong following in Tallahassee, but was located 90 miles and two entire counties away?\n\nFIlm: Filmmakers tap Oyster City Brewing for upcoming 'Unfiltered: The Truth About Oysters'\n\nBrewery: Made by the Water family adds members as Oyster City owner acquires Catawba | Brew Bend\n\nOyster farming: World of oyster farming: OysterMom, Oyster Boss navigate salty joys, perils of aquaculture\n\n\"You gotta cover them,\" Tallahassee radio show host and loud-and-proud Oyster City supporter Greg Tish told us when we first began. \"They opened in 2014 just after Proof did, and they've been as big a part of the growth of our area craft beer scene as anyone.\"\n\nAnd he was right.\n\nSo we made the executive decision early on to include them in all that we did — and that call has proven to be a wise one. Because, as of mid-December, Oyster City now has more locations than any of our local breweries after they opened their third taproom Dec. 17 in Downtown Mobile, Alabama\n\nThat now gives them active locations in Apalach, Tallahassee — which opened in August 2021 — and now their first outside of Florida in Alabama.\n\nTaking over a former brewery\n\nAs they did in Tallahassee when GrassLands closed, Oyster City took over the home of a former brewery in Mobile. Serda Brewing closed in early 2021 and sold its operating facility and all brewing equipment to OCBC, and the ownership group wasted no time in flipping the space and making it into their own.\n\n\"Mobile, in a lot of ways, is just like Apalachicola,\" Oyster City Executive General Manager Clayton Mathis said. \"They have great oysters here, they're right by the water, and their downtown area is awesome. Oyster City was already being distributed in Mobile and the surrounding areas, so while we may be the new brewery in town, we are not necessarily new to the market. We could not be more excited to open our first Alabama brewery, and be a part of the amazing Mobile community.\"\n\nThe growth, from our vantage point, has been nothing short of incredible to watch.\n\nTwo new tasting rooms? Less than 6 months apart? And during a pandemic, no less?\n\nDon't be scared to give our friends at OCBC a little golf clap when you consider all the groundwork they've laid in the last year to expand like this — and quickly at that.\n\nThe best part, though, is this: Each location has its own unique vibe, own unique tap list, and own unique look.\n\nSoaking in the coastal flavor\n\nIn Apalachicola, you can't fit any more than about 15 people inside their tiny tasting room on the corner of Avenue D in Downtown, but there are scores of wood benches and tables just outside to kick back, relax and soak in the beauty of the famed Forgotten Coast town and nearby Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThey also conceptualize and brew nearly all of their new beers in Apalach, creating test batches in small quantities that OCBC puts on tap just in the Apalachicola tasting room as a sounding board to see how the beer is received before it gets sent anywhere else.\n\nAnd when you add all that up, plus all the fun things to do in Apalach, that'll keep us visiting the O.G. location, despite now having our very Oyster City right here in Tallahassee.\n\nSpeaking of Tallahassee, we all know what our location has that the others don't — a massive beer garden, a huge stage for live music and an ideal location right in the heart of FSU's and FAMU's campuses, just outside of downtown. OCBC-Tallahassee's tasting room is about double the size of Apalachicola's, and it even has a private event space in the back near the brewhouse you can reserve for small gatherings.\n\nOh, and a bit of breaking news buried deep in this week's column: The Tallahassee location will soon be the exclusive home of the first-ever Tallahassee Beer Society-Oyster City collaboration beer.\n\nWe can't give much more away than that right now, but just be aware: A TLHBS-OCBC beer is coming!\n\nOyster City merch madness\n\nAs for the new location in Mobile, in full disclosure, we haven't been — Mobile is roughly 4 hours from Tallahassee, and with them opening right around the holidays, even WE couldn't find the time to make it over yet. But we will!\n\nYou can just look at the photos for yourself and see all that it offers that the others don't — namely a giant indoor tasting room, a ridiculously huge bar and an entire area that houses the \"Oyster City store\" full of its beloved merch. (BTW, y'all ever noticed how well their brand is represented by people? We swear we can't go anywhere around the Big Bend and not see someone sporting an Oyster City hat or shirt. We even saw some of their gear in Asheville, North Carolina, during a visit in late 2019. They've got an extremely loyal following!)\n\nBut as if two new tasting rooms weren't enough, Oyster City is now on the hunt for strong craft beer brands to add to their newly created craft brewery group: \"Made By The Water.\" And if you read the article in the October 2021 Tallahassee Democrat titled \"Made by the Water family adds members as Oyster City owner acquires Catawba\" then you're aware that process has already begun.\n\nThe Made By The Water family purchased Catawba Brewing out of Asheville, North Carolina, and Catawba's sister brewery, Palmetto Brewing out of Charleston, South Carolina, with plans to keep operating those well-known craft breweries open and operating under their current brands, with the hopes of sharing beer from each one in each other's tap rooms eventually.\n\nLong story short: If you didn't already know how fast Oyster City was growing now you do. And who knows where their next tasting room — or even production facility — will pop up next.\n\nBut this much we do know: They're not done — not by a longshot.\n\nSo stay tuned!\n\nDanny Aller is the co-founder, along with Matthew Crumbaker, of the TLH Beer Society.
