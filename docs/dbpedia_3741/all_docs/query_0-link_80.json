        "text": "Brief\n\nIn 1906, six people, in a household of eleven in Oyster Bay, New York (approximately thirty miles outside of New York City), became infected with Typhoid Fever. Typhoid Fever is a serious health threat that is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. This illness travels through contaminated food and water and symptoms include a high fever (often approaching or exceeding 104°), abdominal pain, headache, and constipation or diarrhea. Other symptoms may persist.\n\nIn response to the six household members becoming ill, the homeowners hired George Soper, a New York City Department of Health sanitary engineer, to investigate the outbreak. Soper, at the time, was specialized in studying the Typhoid Fever epidemic. After bringing in additional experts, it was concluded that the outbreak source was likely contaminated water. The following year, 1907, Mary Mallon was working as a cook for a family in Manhattan. While employed in the Park Avenue home, another outbreak of Typhoid Fever occurred causing an additional sixteen persons to become infected with one of whom succumbing.\n\nGeorge Soper investigated the Park Avenue outbreak and interviewed Mary Mallon. It was concluded that Mary Mallon, the Irish immigrant who has been working in countless households and facilities as a cook, was an asymptomatic carrier of Typhoid Fever and all twenty-two of the two households’ illnesses were directly linked to Mallon. However, the discovery occurred too late. In 1906, the initial infected six spread to a total of 7,563,218 typhoid cases with 13,160 succumbing. Additionally, in 1907 a total of 7,281,609 typhoid cases occurred with 12,674 succumbing. At the conclusion of 1907, a total of fifty-three asymptomatic typhoid carriers were discovered in New York City. The initial, Mary Mallon, would live her life out in mandated isolation, succumbing to old age on November 11th, 1938. The following will examine the spread of the 1906–07 NYC Typhoid Fever outbreak, the epidemic’s spread projection, and its containment.\n\nTyphoid Spread without Prevention\n\nTraveling through contaminated food and water, once Salmonella typhi infects a person and causes Typhoid Fever, said person becomes a potent medium for the spread of the illness. On good terms, typhoid left untreated may dissipate in three to four weeks. However, a majority of those displaying symptoms are prescribed an antibiotic by a physician. Various walks of life do not visit medical professionals for an exam and to receive treatment. This may be due in part from poverty, lack of resources, stubbornness, etc.\n\nKnowing the statistics of the number infected and those who have succumbed in New York City due to Typhoid Fever in 1906–07, an exponential growth formula may be created to predict the future actions of the typhoid outbreak. Calculating the typhoid growth between 1906–07, it is known that the number of infected and deceased decreased by 3.7%. Utilizing this, the following exponential formula is created for future behavior calculation:\n\nP(x) = 7,563,218 (1–0.037) x (7,563,218 = number of cases in 1906, 0.037 = outbreak growth)\n\nSimplified to: P(x) = 7,563,218 (0.963) x\n\nWhere x = current year — 1906\n\nUtilizing this formula through the years 1906–11 (with the data for 1906–07 being known), the following statistics can be expected for those infected and deceased due to typhoid:\n\nWith the above spread projection calculations, the following graph displays the expected trend:\n\nTyphoid Spread with Chlorination\n\nAs 1907 came to an end and 1908 began, scientists and public health officials rolled out a prevention campaign that consisted of utilizing chlorine to sanitize. As an inexpensive and effective disinfectant, chlorine, used properly, may be used to sanitize food, water, and surfaces. Proper concentrations must be utilized to safely sanitize with chlorine. Do not sanitize with chlorine unless properly instructed by a professional.\n\nWith chlorination in effect, by the end of 1908, New York City experienced 1,454,407 typhoid cases with 492 infected persons succumbing. Following, in 1909, New York City experienced 946,819 typhoid cases with 209 infected persons succumbing. Utilizing the known data for 1908–09, the typhoid outbreak growth is calculated to be a 34.9% decrease in overall cases and a 57.5% decrease in total deaths. The following exponential formula is created for future overall case projections:\n\nP(x) = 1,454,407 (1–0.349) x (1,454,407 = number of cases in 1908, 0.349 = typhoid infection growth)\n\nSimplified to: P(x) = 1,454,407 (0.651) x\n\nWhere x = current year — 1908\n\nThe following exponential formula is created for future typhoid death projections:\n\nP(x) = 492 (1–0.575) x (492 = number of deaths in 1908, 0.575 = typhoid death growth)\n\nSimplified to: P(x) = 492 (0.425) x\n\nWhere x = current year — 1908\n\nUtilizing this formula through the years 1908–13 (with the data for 1908–09 being known), the following statistics can be expected for those infected and deceased due to typhoid:\n\nWith the above spread projection calculations, the following graph displays the expected trend:\n\nTyphoid Spread with Chlorination and Vaccines\n\nFollowing the entrance of chlorination in 1908, a vaccine for Typhoid Fever was introduced in 1909. Army Physician Frederick F. Russell utilized information received from a publication of Pfeiffer and Kolle’s vaccination research to create the first vaccination for Typhoid Fever. In 1913, Russell presented his statistics obtained through vaccination research to the Harvey Society of New York and stated that Typhoid Fever immunity is successfully built through inoculation. However, a vaccination that is deemed fully successful would not be created until 1914 by Almroth E. Wright.\n\nWith both chlorination and vaccination in full effect, by the end of 1909, New York City experienced 946,819 typhoid cases with 209 infected persons succumbing. Following, in 1910 New York City experienced 498,974 typhoid cases with 58 infected persons succumbing. Utilizing the known data for 1909–10, the typhoid outbreak growth is calculated to be a 47.3% decrease in overall cases and a 72.2% decrease in total deaths. The following exponential formula is created for future overall case projections:\n\nP(x) = 946,819 (1–0.473) x (946,819 = number of cases in 1909, 0.473 = typhoid infection growth)\n\nSimplified to: P(x) = 946,819 (0.527) x\n\nWhere x = current year — 1909\n\nThe following exponential formula is created for future typhoid death projections:\n\nP(x) = 209 (1–0.722) x (209 = number of deaths in 1909, 0.722 = typhoid death growth)\n\nSimplified to: P(x) = 209 (0.278) x\n\nWhere x = current year — 1909\n\nUtilizing this formula through the years 1909–14 (with the data for 1909–10 being known), the following statistics can be expected for those infected and deceased due to typhoid:\n\nWith the above spread projection calculations, the following graph displays the expected trend:\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 1906–07 NYC Typhoid Fever outbreak was nothing short of tragic. Historians and scientists, together, have argued the speculation of Mary Mallon being aware that she was an asymptomatic carrier of Typhoid Fever. Unfortunately, the answer will remain unknown. As the notorious Typhoid Mary lived in mandated isolation, during 1906–10, New York City experienced 17,745,027 typhoid cases with 26,589 infected persons succumbing. After careful examination of typhoid’s behavior without preventative measures, a reasonable person may conclude that New York City would have eventually became eradicated from citizens without chlorination and vaccines.\n\nSources\n\n1910–1938.
