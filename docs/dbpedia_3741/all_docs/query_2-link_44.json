        "text": "TOM, Justice.\n\nAppeal from an order of the Family Court, New York County (Sara Schechter, J.), entered on December 11, 1995, which denied the application to exclude the press from the pending child protective proceeding.\n\nThis appeal concerns the sensitive balance which must be struck between the potential trauma to the mental and physical well-being of the children in question which would result from the public dissemination of certain personal aspects of their lives, and whether those concerns outweigh the interests of the press in having free access to judicial proceedings.\n\nThe matter before us arises from the brutal murder of Elisa Izquierdo, an episode which shocked New York City, became world-wide news, and led to a reevaluation of the mechanisms which are designed to protect the welfare of the City's children. On November 22, 1995 Elisa, six years old at the time, was pronounced dead at Beekman Downtown Hospital as the result of severe trauma to the head. At the time of her death, Elisa resided with her mother, Awilda M.-L., her stepfather Carlos L. (collectively, the Parents), and her five half-siblings, Ruben R. (9 years old at the time of Elisa's death), Kasey M. (8 years old), Taisha L. (5 years old), Carlos L. (3 years old) and Rafael L. (2 years old).\n\nThe surviving children were subsequently removed from the custody of the Parents, based upon allegations of child abuse, and placed in emergency foster care, where they remain to date. Awilda M.-L. was subsequently indicted on charges of murder in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child and is presently incarcerated. Carlos L., who is also presently incarcerated, was arrested five days prior to Elisa's death on a parole violation, having previously been convicted of assault.\n\nSince Elisa's death, intensive coverage of both the life and the circumstances surrounding her death has appeared in both the print and broadcast media. In the course of this coverage, the press has disclosed the identities of the surviving children and on November 29, 1995, the New York Post printed the full names and ages of the two oldest children, Ruben and Kasey. Other examples of press coverage include: the full names of Ruben and Kasey again appearing in the New York Post the following day, together with a photograph of Ruben above the caption \"Social workers lead Elisa's brother, Ruben R[.], to a waiting car outside funeral home in Brooklyn yesterday\" (New York Post, , at 15); Ruben's full name appearing in the New York Daily News on November 30, 1995, together with the alleged quote \" 'Will my sister go to heaven?' asked a teary Ruben R[.], 9\" (New York Daily News, , at 3); Elisa's death was the cover story of the December 11, 1995 issue of Time magazine, and a color photograph of the respondents, \"with three of their children\" (Ruben, Kasey and Taisha), appeared on page 35; and on November 29, 1995, an account of the grand jury testimony of Ruben and Kasey concerning Elisa's death, appeared in the New York Post (\"Siblings' Shocking Testimony of Terror\", New York Post, , at 3).\n\nOn November 24, 1995, the Commissioner of Social Services filed a petition in New York County Family Court charging the Parents with the abuse and neglect of the surviving children. The allegations supporting the petition, both horrific and numbing, will not be delineated herein.\n\nOn November 29, 1995, the case appeared on the Family Court calendar and the respondent Parents were assigned counsel. The Family Court thereafter entertained an application from several members of the press to cover the child protective proceedings. At the time, reporters from WCBS, the New York Post, the New York Times, the Associated Press, the Daily News and New York 1 were present in the courtroom.\n\nThe law guardian opposed the application and requested that the press be excluded from the courtroom while the factual basis for closure was set forth, which would include testimony from a social worker, who was to explain the negative impact press coverage would have on these particular children. The law guardian also informed Judge Schechter that a psychologist, who had interviewed a number of the children, was also available to support the law guardian's application for a closed courtroom and to establish that an open courtroom would result in irreparable harm to the children. The law guardian further asserted that the presence of the press at the proceeding would continue to victimize the children, violate their privacy rights and expose intimate details of their lives as yet undisclosed to the public.\n\nIn addition to the law guardian, Counsel for the Commissioner of Social Services, as well as both respondents, opposed press coverage. The Commissioner maintained that he is required, by statute, to protect the confidentiality of the children and that press coverage would thwart those statutory goals. At the conclusion of argument, the Family Court ruled that the press would be allowed to attend the proceedings.\n\nThe law guardian obtained a stay of the Family Court proceedings from this Court pending an appeal of the Family Court ruling and subsequently, upon the application of the media's attorneys, the stay was modified to the extent that a preliminary hearing on the issue of press coverage was allowed to go forward so that a full record could be developed with a view toward a subsequent appeal.\n\nJudge Schechter then reopened the proceedings to permit attorneys from the press, who previously did not have an opportunity to argue, to state their positions on the record. The law guardian, counsel for the Commissioner and the respondents reiterated their opposition to the presence of the press. In addition, the law guardian again requested that the court exclude the press during her argument because there was sensitive information concerning the children she did not wish to make public. The court denied the request.\n\nAs a result of the court's ruling, the law guardian, during argument, refrained from discussing the details of the children's past or present circumstances and the psychological harm so as to avoid disclosure to the media of sensitive information. However, the law guardian did submit, under seal, two affidavits prepared by a psychologist and a certified social worker, in support of her position. The law guardian further argued that protections such as not publishing the children's names in accounts of the abuse proceedings would be futile since their names, and pictures, had already been disseminated by the media.\n\nIn a written decision dated December 11, 1995, the Family Court denied the application \"for a blanket exclusion of the press\" from the pending Family Court Act Article 10 child abuse and neglect proceeding involving the five surviving siblings of Elisa Izquierdo \"[i]n spite of the court's sympathy for the children's feelings\". The Family Court held, in pertinent part, that: the closure of the court is authorized, but not mandated, in appropriate cases (Family Court Act ยง 1043); the press, to date, had \"comported themselves in an orderly and professional manner\" and had not, in any way, been disruptive to the proceedings; despite the fact that all four parties to the proceeding had objected to the presence of the press, this factor was afforded little consideration; with regard to the respondent Parents, there was little privacy left to protect; with regard to the children, the court concluded, after reviewing in camera the sealed affidavits of the psychologist and social worker, that \"[v]ictims of abuse often experience the torment of self-blame ... [t]his sense of guilt [however] arises from within ... not from the press\"; 1 and that it would entertain applications to exclude the press \"for those brief portions of testimony that may pertain to especially sensitive details not already in the public domain.\" In conclusion, the court, rather remarkably, seemed to indicate that the underlying tragedy, and the ensuing public debate, provided an appropriate opportunity to educate the public as to the \"essential ... role of the Family Court in the child protective process\", which, thereby, overrode any potential, long-term damage that would result to the children.\n\nThe law guardian and the Commissioner of Social Services appeal and we now reverse.\n\nIt is a well-established principle that public access to court proceedings is strongly favored, both under federal law (U.S. Const., First Amend.; Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580-581, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 2829-30, 65 L.Ed.2d 973; United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d 121, 125-126) and New York State Law (N.Y. Const., art. I, ยง 8; Capital Newspapers v. Moynihan, 71 N.Y.2d 263, 265, 525 N.Y.S.2d 24, 519 N.E.2d 825; Lee v. Brooklyn Union Pub. Co., 209 N.Y. 245, 103 N.E. 155). Indeed, this principle is firmly embodied, although not without qualification, in Section 4 of the Judiciary Law, which states:"
