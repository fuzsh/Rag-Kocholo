        "text": "c venus0 Cancer 45ruler of 4th and c 9th, co-ruler c 8th and c 3rd c7 jupiter3 Cancer 44 c7 moon28 Virgo 02ruler of c 6th house c7 sun 27 Sagittarius 46ruler of c 7th house b7 sun27 Sagittarius 46 co-ruler (29 of 33°) b 10th house\n\nIn the above set, the conjunction of venus to jupiter is in b 9th/c5th houses. They are almost 3° apart, but they are brought into a conjunction in this set because it contains three lights. Even though this set lacks influence to an Angle, it fuels the notion that in this life she develops tender, loving, spiritual energies, some derived from sublimated sexuality, that she may use in work involving service to others in a one-on-one way, for instance, as a nurse or nurse nun.\n\nLauries (alleged) sexual abuse by her father is reinforced by the fact that she has:\n\nb sun at 6 Pisces 25 conjunct\n\nc SN at 7 Pisces 44 conjunct\n\nb mercury at 10 Pisces 59 (all charts) still in 5th/1st houses\n\nThe sun can represent older, authoritative males, in this case, her father. Its conjunction to South Node in Pisces suggests past life (SN) suffering or confusion (Pisces), or it represents karma for this lifetime. Mercury suggests either its re-occurrence or expiation in childhood (mercury) in this life. Mercury rules b 9th and 12th and co-rules b 8th (20 of 34°).\n\nWe astrologers do not often have birth data on a parent sexual offender. However, we do have Lauries fathers birth data. An intriguing set occurs in his 5th chart. He has:\n\nb5 venus at 6 Pisces 43 (ruler of B Asc and b 8th house) conjunct\n\nc5 venus at 8 Pisces 43 conjunct\n\nb NN at 9 Pisces 48 in his 5th/11th houses\n\nThese are conjunct Lauries sun conjunct SN in Pisces in her 5th/1st houses. His progressing b NN was at 6 Pisces 51 when Laurie was born, 6 Pisces 18 when she was four, and 6 Pisces 18 when she was 8. Normally NN to venus in a 5th in a parent chart would show (partial) timing (progressed node) for the birth of a loved (venus) child (5th). In synastry, however, the considerable overlap of Pisces, 5th houses, and 8th influence suggests dissolved boundaries, specifically, that the fathers boundaries regressed to more like those of his daughter.\n\nIn spite of his (alleged) sexual violation of his very own child, this Father is not a pedophile. That is, he lacks the astrology shown in common by all the pedophiles whose birth data I could obtain. So, I doubt he was ever a threat to other children. His sexual subjectivity with regard to children appears to have been restricted to his daughter. Here is the link to the paper that shows the significators found so far for pedophilia: Paper on Pedophilia .\n\nHe has some astrology that may have played into his attraction to his child. Adding up the astrology from all his charts, he has five venuses in Pisces. Two, those from his 5th chart symbolizing his own sexuality, are at 6 Pisces 43 and 8 Pisces 33, birth and conception harmonics, respectively. These are conjunct her all-charts sun conjunct SN in Pisces.\n\nTwo of the other venuses in Pisces are intriguing. His 3rd chart (mind) venus at 21 Pisces 57, ruler of b 8th house, is conjunct c NN at 22 Pisces 53. His 10th chart (career, social status, and relationship to mother) venus, ruler of C Asc in b 8th house, is also conjunct that NN. These suggest some kind of psychological need for those completely dissolved boundaries. Existing between two adults, it is a sign of loss of ego of strong sexual orgasm. It has lost its appropriate expression when it appeared, with its 8th house emphasis of loss of ego, between parent and child.\n\nLaurie Partial Harmonic Chart for the 4th House, Part II\n\nPlacidus: c11--12Sag, c12--5Cap, c2--27Pis, c3--28Ari b11--29Leo, b12--25Vir, b2--16Sco, b3--20Sag\n\nSet (2) above belongs to the shell chart. C mercury in Taurus is in a set with c neptune in Scorpio conjunct C MC and b mars conjunct b SN in Aquarius. Angular neptune, which is in all her charts, in Scorpio by itself implies important experiences (forefront) through Scorpionic modessex, death, transformations.\n\nStill discussing Set (2), c mercury rules c 5th house. Therefore, this set suggests Laurie will have some kind of high-powered, confusing, toxic (mars/neptune) sexual (5th) experience, perhaps in childhood (mercury), perhaps through her father (mercury is in c 4th house).\n\nLaurie Partial Harmonic Chart for the 4th House, Part III\n\nPlacidus: c11--12Sag, c12--5Cap, c2--27Pis, c3--28Ari b11--29Leo, b12--25Vir, b2--16Sco, b3--20Sag\n\nSet (3) started out in the shell chart as c sun in Taurus opposition b neptune in Scorpio. The 4th chart added to it harmonic mars and jupiter. Mars rules C MC and c 3rd and neptune co-rules (25 of 26°) b 5th house. This set thus influences both an Angle and a 5th house, so it suggests some sexual emphasis through the father (4th). It didnt necessarily have to be physical. Sun/mars/jupiter has no sexual implications in the sense of molestation. The jupiter part may represent reconciliation (8th house) with her father (4th chart) later in life (4th house), or it may protect the act itself for some time. Sun/mars/neptune, however, is another toxic (partial) set which implies damage by the father (4th chart) in 5th house (sexual) matters. Stated another way, it implies the father (sun) is dangerously (mars) crazy (neptune) sexually (5th).\n\nWe should take a quick look at the chart representing Lauries relationship with her mother.\n\nLaurie Partial Harmonic Chart for the 10th House\n\nPlacidus: c11--12Sag, c12--5Cap, c2--27Pis, c3--28Ari b11--29Leo, b12--25Vir, b2--16Sco, b3--20Sag\n\nThe addition in Set (1) of jupiter to her shell MC/sun/mercury/mars/neptune suggests it is her mother (10th chart) who saves her from her crazy (mars/neptune) father or males (sun) which occurred during her childhood (mercury).\n\nSet (2) adds b5 neptune, co-ruler (25 of 26°) of b 5th house, to b mercury in 5th/1st houses. It might represent Lauries post-molestation ultra-fine tuning (mercury/neptune in Pisces) into sexual overtones (5th) in others intentionally or unintentionally inculcated by her mother.\n\nSet (3) shows a conjunction of b5 uranus (ruler of b 5th house) to c5 sun (ruler of c 7th house). Harmonic uranuses show places the parent is hypervigilant, willful and autocratic, or even hysterically (uranus) focused. It also suggests the shock (uranus) and horror (Pisces) Lauries mother felt when she realized her husband was sexually molesting (5th) their daughter. Its place in Lauries 10th chart shows her mother was not entirely successful in preventing the spread of that shock and horror to her daughter.\n\nLauries close astrological trine (120° sets used in traditional astrology) of b moon (14 Sagittarius 29 and ruler of B MC) to b saturn (14 Leo 31 and ruler of b 4th) produces harmonic sets containing a conjunction of moon and saturn in her 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th charts, showing some depression, wariness, and/or sadness with regard to childhood, father, significant others, and mother, respectively:\n\nIn her 1st chart b1 moon is at 13 Pisces 27 conjunct b1 saturn at 13 Pisces 34 in 5th/1st, showing the alienation (saturn) and insubstantiality (Pisces) she experienced in childhood (1st) because of sexuality (5th).\n\nWith her 4th chart it forms the closest aspect to an Angle. B4 moon is at 26 Capricorn 55 conjunct b4 saturn at 27 Capricorn 08. This harmonic conjunction overlays her shell set with B MC at 26 Cancer 16, b uranus (ruler of b 5th house in b 1st house, another indicator of childhood sexual abuse) at 26 Libra 16, and b venus at 27 Capricorn 11. Her shell Angle/venus/uranus shows a tendency to sudden (uranus) relationships (venus) of sexual nature (ruler of 5th) especially in early childhood (ruler of 5th in 1st). It also shows a rigidity which she developed toward her father. Following her 1st chart set, this is the most astrologically damaging one.\n\nIn her 7th chart her harmonic moon/saturn falls at 10-11° of Sagittarius. Along the way it acquires b7 harmonic jupiter at 11° Sagittarius (ruler of b 3rd house), probably indicative of the counseling and help (jupiter) she received regarding her parents ( rulers of 4th/10th).\n\nIn her 10th chart it again falls into relationship with B MC/venus/uranus, but has moved further away, with moon at 23 Libra 49 and saturn at 24 Libra 17R. It might represent a kind of social dysfunctionality based on being cautioned against strangers by her mother. C10 harmonic neptune at 28 Capricorn 43 R is moving toward her MC/venus/uranus while saturn is moving away from it. Forefront venus/neptune in a parent chart shows the parent treated the child as precious. While this often rewards the child, it also often holds unrevealed costs which reverberate throughout the childs life.\n\nI will not cover Lauries 5th chart here, only state that it shows c5 moon at 15 Pisces 08 in 5th/1st. Harmonic moons in Pisces indicate states of confusion and dissociation, making learning and even comfort difficult in whichever chart they fall in. Because of her early sexual trauma, Laurie would experience degrees of these states for the remainder of her life (or until she unlearned them or learned to willfully switch her focus to another, more comfortable part of her chart.)\n\nMedical examination, which showed scarring, confirmed Lauries sexual abuse. With all her material in Pisces in 5th/1st houses, with ruler of b 5th in b 1st house, and with her toxic 4th chart with its influence to 5th houses, astrologically her childhood sexual abuse is astrologically confirmed. It looks like her father was involved, but this conclusion can only become firm following considerably more research on parent/child incest.\n\nIn conclusion, both Elisas and Lauries charts show heavy affliction to 5th houses in the chart (10th for mother, 4th for father) representing the parent who apparently molested them.\n\nBefore closing this appendix, I will show the chart of a pedophile, John Rex, Jr. He raped two boys and was arrested when he tried to get some other boys to abduct a young blond boy (between the ages of six and nine) for him so he could take the boy to his family cabin in New Hampshire. While in jail, he confessed to his cellmate that he had buried the body of a 12-year-old boy in his back yard. The body was found in April, 1994, and Rex was charged with the rape of two boys plus the murder of this third boy. We want to look at his significators for pedophilia. They could be in either the 7th or the 5th chart. In Rexs case, they were in the 7th chart.\n\nThe following section on the pedophile astrology of John Rex, Jr. is incorrect. This paper was written some time between May 2005 and March 2006. In June 2011, on this site I published a paper on the significators for pedophilia found in charts of 25 pedophiles. Rexs correct astrology for pedophilia is found there. Here is the link: Paper on Pedophilia . This ought to make it abundantly clear that until most of the human race has had its astrology analyzed into a comprehensive data base, significators are subject to change.\n\nJohn Rex, Jr. Partial Harmonic Chart for the 7th House, Part I\n\nPlacidus: c11--20Sag, c12--14Cap, c2--8Ari, c3--7Tau b11--19Aqu, b12--1Ari, b2--8Gem, b3--28Gem\n\nSet (1) shows c7 moon in Gemini (youth) in c 5th house (sex). That moon also co-rules (14 of 24°) c 5th house. Set (2) shows c moon (also co-ruler of c 5th house) in Pisces (suffering) in a set with moon and mercury (youth, co-ruler of b 5th house) in Sagittarius. Set (3) shows mercury (youth), co-ruler (30 of 42°) of b 5th house (sex), in Gemini (youth). It is lighted by the two 7th chart harmonic suns at 5 Sagittarius 30.\n\nI repeat what I write in all papers in which I write about the significators for pedophilia: it would be a serious mistake to conclude that just because and individual has Gemini planets in or ruling the 5th, or a mercury/5th connection he/she is a pedophile. For most individuals such sets indicate the merely like children or that they are attracted to younger types, but not children. Or, even if they found children sexually attractive, they would not act on it. More likely, they would block such awareness out of their mind\n\nJohn Rex, Jr. Partial Harmonic Chart for the 7th House, Part II\n\nPlacidus: c11--20Sag, c12--14Cap, c2--8Ari, c3--7Tau b11--19Aqu, b12--1Ari, b2--8Gem, b3--28Gem\n\nEven though Set (4) contains a mercury (which rules c 5th house) I do not think it is causative in Rexs pedophilia. That is, by itself in some ones chart I doubt it would represent pedophilia. It does, however, explain his intense need to completely possess (he told the boys he was going to eat the abducted boy) his sexual partner.. He has sun/mercury/neptune/neptune all in Scorpio and in c 8th house. He would be fascinated (neptune) with death (Scorpio/8th) and total possession (8th as representative of the sex of marriage). Instead of marrying and enjoying a robust and profound sex life with his partner, he combined this set with his mercury/Gemini sets into sexual interest in children and the eventual death of one of them. Also part of the set is b mars at 4 Leo 21, giving him sun/mars/neptune, making his relations with others (7th) crazy (mars/neptune). None of the planets in this set rule an Angle, so it is not forefront in influence. Houses rules or co-ruled are 1st, 5th, 7th, 11th, and 12th.\n\nNone of Rexs Set (4) influence a 3rd house. Not even in his 3rd chart. The data classified him as having a psychotic episode. He may have had such, but he is not psychotic. His interests are simply far too, and far to potently, skewed toward the 5th/8th experiences. Some would say it this way, he is simply bad news.\n\nWe get no clue from his 7th chart why Rex turned toward children. It contains nothing pertinent in Gemini and his sexuality is not blocked as occurs with some child sexual predators.\n\nWe do get some interesting information by looking at sets in his 4th (father) and 10th (mother) charts.\n\nRexs 10th chart contains the following set:"
