        "text": "Halloween Night 1974 started out like any other typical night for many families: Ronald Clark O’Bryan and his wife, Daynene, planned to take their children, 8-year-old Timothy and 5-year-old Elizabeth, trick-or-treating. Unfortunately, this seemingly ordinary Halloween would be anything but for the O’Bryan family. By the end of the night, little Timothy O’Bryan would pass away due to consuming contaminated Halloween candy. But upon investigation, police would soon learn that Timothy’s death wasn’t accidental at all. Join Arielle and Amanda as they discuss the tragic murder of Timothy O’Bryan by the man who has been called “The Candy Man” or “The Man Who Killed Halloween.”\n\nWhen Sallie Rohrbach, auditor for the North Carolina Department of Insurance, traveled to Charlotte in May 2008 to perform a routine audit of an insurance agency, she didn’t think this assignment would be any different from the hundreds and thousands of audits she had done in her career. Unfortunately, this assignment would be Sallie’s last. Join Arielle and Amanda as they discuss the lengths white-collar criminals will go to when they’re backed into a corner and their fraudulent activities are likely to be revealed.\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think of a cult? Is it “Don’t drink the Kool-Aid?” Did you know this seemingly innocuous saying resulted from a massacre that was the second largest loss of life of American citizens in history? I am talking, of course, about the Jonestown Massacre that took place in Guyana, South America in November 1978. What happens when a man who originally set out to change the world for the better lets the power go to his head and drugs and sex corrupt his vision and morals?\n\nJoin Arielle and Amanda in part 4 of a 4 part series as they try to decipher how Jim Jones went from small-town preacher to a self-proclaimed Prophet that led almost 1,000 of his followers to their deaths in Jonestown, Guyana.\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think of a cult?

Ben owned and operated Renick’s Reptiles from his 72-acre farm in Missouri alongside his wife, Lynlee. Ben was at the top of the snake breeding game and was creating colors and patterns in snakes no one had ever seen before. So the snake enthusiast community was rocked in June 2017 when Ben was found murdered in his snake facility in New Florence, Missouri. Was Ben murdered for his snake collection? Or was it for a more nefarious reason? Join Arielle and Amanda as they discuss this case involving exotic animals, murder, fraud, and more. But watch your back… because sometimes snakes aren’t the only ones who are cold-hearted killers."
