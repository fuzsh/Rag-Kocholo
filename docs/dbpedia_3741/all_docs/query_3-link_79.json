        "text": "Administrators at a Brooklyn preschool attended by Alisa Izquierdo, the 6-year-old girl whose mother is charged with beating her to death, said Saturday that they feared for the girl so much the school's director urged a Family Court judge in a July 1994 letter to consider placing her in the custody of an aunt.\n\nAdministrators at the YWCA Montessori Day School said that just two months earlier, Alisa's father, who had taken care of her for most of her life, had died, and the girl stood at a crossroads.\n\nIn one direction, they said, lay the promise of a private education at the Brooklyn Friends Academy, where Alisa had been admitted for kindergarten beginning in September 1994.\n\nHer tuition through the 12th grade was to be paid by Prince Michael of Greece, who had been a benefactor of the Montessori School and had taken a special interest in Alisa, school officials said.\n\nIn the other direction lay life with her mother, Awilda Lopez, who, after obtaining temporary custody refused to allow Alisa to finish her last month of preschool, the officials said.\n\n\"It's such a tragedy _ for her to have come so close to a fairy tale existence,\" said Patricia Stevens, the director of communications at the school. Stevens said that she, like almost every other official at the school, saw Alisa as a child with a chance to rise above her troubled origins.\n\n\"I can hardly talk about it,\" said Stevens, sobbing.\n\nShe said that when Prince Michael offered to pay Alisa's way through private school, \"We were ecstatic about it.\n\n\"Then her father died,\" Stevens said, \"and she was thrown back into this den of wolves.\"\n\nAlisa was found dead Wednesday in Lopez's apartment in the Rutgers Houses project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Her body bore bruises and scars that indicated a long history of abuse.\n\nLopez has been charged with inflicting the final, deadly blow, which caused internal bleeding in Alisa's brain.\n\nThe accounts given Saturday by administrators at the school that Alisa attended for about four years were the latest allegations that public officials were warned that Alisa might be in danger from her mother.\n\nPhyllis Bryce, the former director of the school, said Saturday in a telephone conversation from her retirement home in Florida that although Alisa's father, Gustavo Izquierdo, took good care of the girl, whenever Alisa would return from occasional weekend visits to her mother's, \"she was very, very upset.\"\n\n\"At times, she had bruises on her body,\" Bryce said.\n\nBryce said that she reported this to Izquierdo and to a social worker at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Services, where Izquierdo was attending parenting classes. She said she also called the statewide phone line for reports about suspected child abuse, although she said she could not recall the precise number or dates of her calls.\n\nChild welfare authorities subsequently visited Lopez's home, she said.\n\n\"They went briefly, and then they stopped, as they usually do,\" Bryce said.\n\nThe city Child Welfare Administration has said that state confidentiality laws prevent it from commenting on what contact, if any, it had with the Lopez family.\n\nBryce said that when Izquierdo died of cancer sometime around May 1994 and custody of Alisa came into dispute, she sent a letter to a Brooklyn Family Court judge who was hearing the case.\n\nBryce identified that judge as Phoebe Greenbaum. Greenbaum could not be reached Saturday afternoon for comment.\n\nBryce read Saturday from her letter, which outlined school workers' suspicions that Lopez physically abused Alisa and recommended the aunt be awarded custody.\n\nBryce said she offered in the letter to talk with the judge but never heard back."
