        "text": "4.V CO 1 KSKpaSto -u-- lii-u NEAR COLLAPSE, Awilda Lopez was apologetic and weeping yesterday when she was sentenced for the death of her 6-year-old daughter, Elisa By BARBARA ROSS and DON GENTILE Dcly News Stjff Writers Sobbing and hysterical, Awilda Lopez yesterday apologized for beating and torturing her tiny daughter, Elisa Izquierdo, to death, then was sentenced to tional attention and led to reforms in the state's child welfare laws. Children such as \"Elisa, the babies, the most vulnerable of us all,\" have no lobbyists to get the attention of lawmakers, said Schlesinger. \"As a result, the amount of money they receive is small,\" he said. \"It results in agencies hiring insufficiently educated and trained people, too many nine-to-fivers. \"If anything is to be learned from this awful, this horrendous tragedy, it is that we 15 years to life in prison .\n\n\"Lisa, I'm sorry for whatev er happened to you and for what all your brothers and sisters are going through,\" Lopez wailed as she stood before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Alvin Schlesinger. Then she screamed and buried her face in her arms. \"I think the magnitude of Iftoyst er Sr. wants illp SOU In HELAYNE SEIOMAN Izquierdo. must give some priorities to these babies.\" Patricia Stevens, a spokesman for the Montessori School that Elisa once attended in Brooklyn, agreed with Schlesinger, lambasting the Family Court judge who returned Elisa to Lopez and noting that not one city child welfare official was in court yesterday .\n\n\"They helped kill her as far as we're concerned,\" she said. Lopez' common-law husband, Carlos Lopez, faces lesser charges in the girl's death. In recent months, professors at the University of New Hampshire, Bennington College in Vermont and Delaware Community College in Pennsylvania have won suits against students. \"What happened to Professor Kennedy is not uncommon today in big businesses and universities all over the country,\" said his lawyer, Steve Barrison. \"She felt she could get away with this; she felt, 'Who cares about ruining this guy's Robert Ruback, the university's general counsel, called Kennedy's suit \"spurious\" and noted that a panel of school officials in 1992 found Kennedy guilty of harassing a female student In 1990, Kennedy faced yet another allegation, but that case was dropped when the student transferred to another school .\n\n\"He had been warned in writing not to engage in similar conduct,\" Ruback said. Persaud could not be reached for comment. for $3iY3 charges degree murder last month, Lopez admitted smashing the child's head against a concrete wall, then letting her lie unattended for two days. Always dressed in rags during previous court appearances, Lopez attended her sentencing wearing a dress and heels, with her hair neatly coiffed. Lopez is not alone to blame for Elisa's death, the judge declared .\n\nHe blasted the child welfare system that failed the youngster, whose death drew na- THE SON: John Royster Royster complained that his son's lawyers from the state Capital Defender's Office failed to meet with him as promised before a Manhattan grand jury handed up a first degree murder indictment against his son in early July. Attorney Mitchell Dinner-stein, of the Capital Defender's Office, sloughed off the elder Royster's claims. \"We're interested in providing John with the best possible representation,\" Dinnerstein said. The elder Royster, serving a life sentence for the 1989 shotgun slaying of a former girlfriend on a midtown subway platform, has a reputation as a jailhouse lawyer. i i i Iff i what she did finally hit her today,\" said her lawyer, Daniel Ollen, outside the courtroom .\n\nA crackhead when she was arrested last November, Lopez, 29, had previously expressed little remorse over the tragic end of 6-year-old Elisa Pleading guilty to second- media activities\" that result in \"flowers and hearts portrayals of the assault victims designed to inflame public lynching appetites.\" Saying Royster's mother, Lynese Sykes Royster, has \"abandoned\" their son, the jailed dad said he wants to handle the affairs of the son he lost custody of in court years ago. The unusual request, made in court papers filed last month, has caught prosecutors and defense attorneys off guard. The petition will be heard in several weeks, after it is assigned to a civil court judge. Normally, guardians are appointed for grown children when the children are mentally disabled, brain-damaged or otherwise unable to fend for themselves. The elder Royster does not make such an argument about his 22-year-old son but states merely that he alone has his son's best interests at heart \"as the lawful father\" and \"possessor of great love and affection and devotion\" for the accused killer .\n\nProf sues By GREG B. SMITH Daily News Staff Writer A Pace University professor accused of sexual harassment sued the school and his student accuser for $13 million yesterday, charging the claims are bogus and have ruined his career. Veteran math professor John Kennedy says student Syndemala Persaud dreamed up false harassment charges because she was failing his courses and faced dismissal from school. But the university says Kennedy has faced repeated sex harassment charges in the past and was even found guilty in 1992 by a school panel investigating similar charges against him. Kennedy's suit, filed in Manhattan Federal Court, is one of a handful of new legal attacks by professors around the nation who say students are using harassment complaints as weapons to get better grades .\n\narass By BARBARA ROSS and DON GENTILE Daily News Staff Writers The jailed killer dad of crime spree suspect John Royster wants to take over his son's legal affairs. Though he hasn't seen his son in 10 years, John J. Royster has written to the courts from his upstate jail cell asking that he be appointed his son's legal guardian and put in charge of his affairs. The younger Royster is charged with the murder of dry cleaner Evalin Alvarez, the brutal sexual assault on a young pianist in Central Park and the beating of a woman on the East Side. If convicted, he could face the death penalty .\n\nHis dad said court-appointed attorneys are not doing enough for his boy. Those lawyers, says the elder Royster, have not prevented police from \"parading his son through the streets and courts like a Vietnam prisoner of war of the Cong.\" He said the authorities have also inspired a \"proliferation of slanderous and infamous LU ."
