        "text": "Advocates for children blast mayor no horror Closed Nadine case By RUSS BUETTNER, ALICE McQUILLAN and DON GENTILE Daily News Staff Writers Despite a detailed warning that 4-year-old Nadine Lockwood was being starved, a child welfare investigator reported seeing no signs of malnutrition when he visited the apartment in June last year, case files showed yesterday. Further files also revealed the discovery that other Lockwood children had not been in school for a year and had not received proper immunizations, and that the mother herself was complaining of rats in the apartment. The evidence in the files added new impetus for investigators trying to determine if the city's child welfare agency had somehow failed to save Nadine. On Monday, Administration of Children's Services Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the agency knew at the time of the June visit that Nadine and at least one other child in the family had tested positive for drugs at birth and had an absentee father. Yet with all the evidence, the new records show, the agency closed the file on the family in December .\n\nAfter visiting the Lockwood home in Washington Heights on June 6, a child welfare investigator wrote: \"Family visited. All observed. No signs of malnutrition.\" Agency sources told the Daily News yesterday the investi- Abuse calls rise this year By KIMBERLY SCHAYE Daily News Albany Bureau ALBANY Calls to the state's child abuse hotline skyrocketed in the first seven months of the year, officials said yesterday. The state Central Register for Child Abuse and Maltreatment received 108,738 calls 40,403 from New York City from January through July. That's a jump over the same period last year .\n\nState officials attributed the increase largely to greater public awareness about child abuse after November's tragic slaying of Elisa Izquierdo by her mother. The 6-year-old girl was found dead of multiple injuries in her family's lower East Side apartment after repeated abuse by her mother, Awilda By JOEL SIEGEL Daily News City Hall Bureau Chief gator was a supervisor. The investigator continued, \"Home is appropriate, but mother claims there are rats in the apartment none The new details from the case file came as Carla Lockwood, 32, now facing murder charges for allegedly starving Nadine to death, suffered a miscarriage from an ectopic pregnancy. She was under guard last night in Elmhurst Hospital Center's psychiatric ward. Law enforcement sources yesterday also revealed new details from Lockwood's video-taped confession, which quotes the woman saying she had never breast-fed Nadine, never bonded with her and isolated her because the girl reminded her so much of the husband who abandoned her .\n\nConfidential state records obtained by The News show child welfare authorities monitored the Lockwood home from June 6, 1995, to Oct. 30, 1995. The investigation was sparked by an anonymous call to the state child-abuse hotline May 25, 1995, alleging that Nadine was \"extremely underweight\" and appeared as if she was \"from a Third World country.\" The caller reported that Lockwood kept Nadine a virtual prisoner in her crib. \"It is believed that the mother is starving this child and See ABUSE Page 27 Calls to the New York State Child Abuse Hotline, January July NYC Statewide Calls Totals 1994 29,533 76,790 1995 28.481 76,573 1996 40,403 108,738 SOURCE: NYS Depart. of Social Services .\n\nLopez, 29. \"We know that that case did have a dramatic impact on the number of reports coming in,\" said Terrance McGrath, a spokesman for the state Department of Social Services. \"Whether there's something else going on, we're not sure, but we're sure that has been a major McGrath said it was typical for the number of abuse reports to increase after a highprofile child-abuse death. The state recorded a similar jump after the 1987 beating death of Lisa Steinberg, when the number of calls \"went up to a new plateau and stayed there,\" he said. Since Elisa's death, \"most people are taking the attitude See HOTLINE Page 27 SMILING MOM Carla Lockwood holds her son Nicholas, now 6, shortly after his birth .\n\nLockwood is charged in the starvation death of her daughter Nadine. Leroy (Punch) Dickerson (below), Nadine's father, has said Lockwood is \"the kindest, gentlest person I know.\" COREY SIPKIN Child No. 6 was lucky By RUSS BUETTNER Daily News Staff Writer Carla Lockwood didn't even stay around the hospital long enough to name the sixth of her eight children. Lockwood, accused this week of starving her daughter Nadine to death, gave birth to another girl in 1992 and immediately signed papers allowing for the infant to be adopted. She checked out of the hospital and never looked back .\n\n\"She never even named the baby,\" said Karen Freedman, co-director of Lawyers for Children, which represented the baby in Family Court. \"On the child's birth certificate, the name is blank. One of the nurses in the hospital named the child.\" Lockwood told police she wanted to do the same with Nadine, her daughter born the year before. But Nadine's father prevailed upon Lockwood to keep the baby. He then abandoned her and her children after the birth .\n\nAdvocates yesterday seized on the death of Nadine Lockwood to accuse Mayor Giuliani of breaking his promise to make protection of children a priority. The mayor answered that New York \"does more for children than any city in America\" and said blame for Nadine's death \"ultimately lies with the parents and the family,\" not with the city's child protective agency. After the beating death of little Elisa Izquierdo exposed systemic problems in the Child Welfare Administration, the mayor announced in January that his administration would focus on \"improving the lives of children.\" The mayor yanked the agency from the city's welfare bureaucracy, renamed it the Administration for Children's Services and appointed a new commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta. He also shielded the Administration for Children's Services from some budget cuts that have hit other agencies. Still, the city was warned 15 months ago that little Nadine was being starved yet she, too, slipped through the safety net .\n\nAdvocates for children contended yesterday that her death represented new evidence that reality has not matched Giuliani's rhetoric. \"What has the mayor done other than recruit Nicholas Scoppetta, who is a very competent administrator, to head one agency that deals with one aspect of children's lives?\" said Rose Anello of the Citizens Committee for Children. She cited school overcrowding, youth services cuts that have not been reversed and a new city policy requiring more homeless families seeking emergency shelter to double up with relatives. \"The mayor has ratcheted down expectations for what government should do. The standard now is, 'What government can not, 'What do kids Anello said .\n\nAsked about Nadine's death, Giuliani yesterday said the city does so much to help troubled kids \"that when mistakes are made it's much more obvious. In other cities you wouldn't have a situation in which anybody attempted to do anything.\" He said the Administration for Children's Services \"is doing an excellent job. It has changed dramatically. It's going to take several years to have those changes reach every single situation.\" Even then, he added, \"There still will be things that go wrong.\" Giuliani said parents must be held more accountable for their children, calling it a \"perversion\" that \"the first question\" asked after the death of an abused child is, \"What did the City of New York have to do with this? The first questions that should have been raised here, and it's part of what's wrong .1. about the family? What about the mother? What about the father? What about the people around that child? SMEN DAILY 1996 September Wednesday, Weeks from her fifth birthday, Nadine was found starved to death in a crib on Saturday .\n\nLockwood, 32, has been arrested in Nadine's death. The baby born in 1992 spent three months in the hospital. She was then sent to live with the foster family that eventually adopted her. But during a year of Family Court proceedings before the adoption, Lockwood never appeared in court, Freedman said. \"In a sense, that was one child who was extremely fortunate,\" Freedman said .\n\n\"Although she was born to that family, she really was never, ever part of that family.\" Freedman pointed out the cruel difference between the child who was adopted whose case moved swiftly and mercifully through the city's troubled child welfare system and little Nadine. \"For this one child, the system really did work,\" Freedman said. ."
