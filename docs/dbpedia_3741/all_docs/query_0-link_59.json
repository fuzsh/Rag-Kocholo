        "text": "Awilda Lopez brutally murdered her 6-year old daughter, Elisa Izquierdo, on 11/22/95. Elisa was raised by her doting father since birth, but sadly he died of cancer in 1994. Before his death, Awilda was awarded unsupervised overnight weekend visitation rights claiming she was no longer on drugs. She immediately began abusing the child. Once the father found bruises on Elisa's body including around her genitalia, he reported it to ACS. Visitation was stopped. However, the father died & Elisa had to be placed somewhere. The father's cousin petitioned for custody for fear of Elisa's safety. Before the father died, he was so afraid that Awilda would get visitation again, that he planned to leave to Cuba. He had already purchased the plane tickets but apparently he died that die. Even after documented abuse & her school's insistence that she not return to her mother, ACS & the child's appointed attorney recommended the child's mother gain custody. Unfortunately, Judge Phoebe Greenbaum agreed... I am sure (or hope) a decision she regrets until she dies. A little over a year later Elisa died after being tortured physically & sexually with inanimate objects. Awilda singled out Elisa from her 5 other siblings! Elisa was forced to eat her own feces while her siblings ate human food. She was locked in a room while her siblings played outside. Elisa's beautiful head of hair was used as a mop!!! During this time, her school called ACS & apparently the claim was \"unsubstantiated\". Awilda took her out of school permanently. I am not sure how she got away with that. Perhaps she claimed she was going to home school her as a way to hide the abuse? Please sign this petition to ensure that this monster is not released!! She was sentenced 15 years to life. Thus far, she has been denied parole. Let's keep it that way! She is scheduled to face the parole board in January 2022. We only have a few months!!! Elisa's life mattered. Don't let her torturer & murderer be free. I beg of you."
