This failure highlighted significant gaps in the child welfare system and raised questions about the protection of vulnerable children​ ​​ ​.\n\nElisa’s Law: A Legacy of Change\n\nIn the wake of Elisa’s death, “Elisa’s Law” was enacted. This law aimed to strengthen the criteria for investigating reports of child abuse and improve the response of local family police agencies like ACS.
