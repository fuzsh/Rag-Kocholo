        "text": "FIVE-YEAR-OLD Ashianay Carzan, blind, crippled and unable even to speak about her terrible hunger, was found starved to death in her fetid Bronx apartment last May.\n\nFive months later, she is forgotten.\n\nNot a mention was made in the news in June, when the medical examiner ruled that the death of the child – who weighed a pitiful 17 pounds and wore only a diaper when her stunted body was found – was not caused by her cerebral palsy, but her mom.\n\nIt is both a blessing and a curse that today, fewer children than ever in this city die at the hands of\n\na father, mother or the mother’s boyfriend.\n\nA blessing, because more children grow up.\n\nA curse, because we grow complacent over the ones who don’t.\n\nSome names live on in the collective memory: Elisa Izquierdo, beaten to death by the woman who gave her life. Lisa Steinberg, slain by a man who called himself Father.\n\nThese children, over whom the entire city wept, evoke an era in New York when authorities were too timid, busy or inept to knock on the doors behind which children screamed.\n\nBut yesterday, as the good news was trumpeted – 23 children “known” to child-welfare folks died last year, an all-time low – it was difficult to find out what happened in the case of poor, pathetic Ashianay.\n\nThe person who enlightened me was Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the Administration for Children’s Services.\n\nHe never forgets a child.\n\n“The mother was not charged. The Bronx district attorney’s office is still investigating,” said Scoppetta, who lost a lot of sleep over this little girl. Actually, he loses sleep over them all.\n\n“This one was tough,” he said.\n\nThe sobering truth is that you can’t save all the children. Not when parents take great pains to conceal the damage they inflict.\n\nIn the case of Ashianay, the little girl suffered from cerebral palsy so severe, she could not talk or open her fists. She was blind, and badly in need of physical therapy and education. And nutrition.\n\nAt her death, which was ruled a homicide because of severe neglect, the girl was found to have suffered from pneumonia.\n\nBut the girl’s mother, Ebony Carzan, refused help many times. She balked at the notion of letting Ashianay go to a special school, where she might learn to speak and move her limbs. At the same time, she did everything conceivable to trick authorities into believing she was taking good care of the child.\n\nShe lied.\n\nYesterday, activists who make a living when the body count is high complained that the ACS and Scoppetta were taking credit for a mere downward fluctuation in the number of child deaths.\n\n“These same activists were attacking ACS when fatalities went up four or five cases,” Scoppetta said. “They pointed that out as an indication that reforms weren’t taking hold. They can’t have it both ways.”\n\nThe drop in deaths is dramatic – a 61 percent decrease among children “known” to ACS since 1988, when 59 lost their lives.\n\nAt the same time as fatalities have gone down, the number of kids in foster care has also shrunk. Thanks to better training of caseworkers and a new computer system, the number of children removed from their homes has dropped from 43,000 in 1997 to 32,500 last year.\n\nWhat’s more, for the first time in child-welfare history, caseworkers who don’t do their jobs can be fired or demoted.\n\n“That has never happened before in the ACS. It was very rare for someone to be fired,” said spokeswoman Jennifer Falk.\n\nAll the good work still cannot save every child. One wrong decision, one benefit of the doubt given to a lying mother, can have permanent consequences. This is why Scoppetta remains sleepless.\n\nSomeone has to remember the Ashianays.\n\nBut he also has a happier reason to have his slumber interrupted.\n\n“I became a grandfather in the last 10 weeks,” he said.\n\nThe boy is named Luca Nicholas Scoppetta-Stern.\n\n“He’s almost royalty.”"
