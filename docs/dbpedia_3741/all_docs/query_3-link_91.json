        "text": "Elisa Izquierdo was a 6-year-old Puerto Rican/ Cuban- American girl. she was born in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nWhen Elisa was born her mother was addicted to crack cocaine and full custody was awarded to her father. Elisa’s father was a doting dad who rose to the challenge, taking parenting classes and celebrating Elisa’s birthdays happily with her. He would refer to Elisa as his ‘princess.’\n\nThe year Elisa began preschool, Elisa’s mother, Awilda, was described as successfully beating her addiction and marrying a maintenance worker. Carlos Lopez. In November 1991, Awilda got the rights to unsupervised visits with Elisa. Reportedly during these visits, Elisa would be beaten and neglected by her mother and stepfather. Both Elisa’s father and her teachers noted Elisa had bruising and signs of mistreatment when she returned from these visits. She said her mother had hit her repeatedly and that she did not wish to see her mum again. In the lead up to Elisa’s visits with her mother, Elisa would wet the bed and have frequent nightmares, she would also vomit upon her return from these trips. Elisa’s father reported this abuse to the authorities and applied in 1992 for Awilda’s visitation rights with Elisa to stop however the courts ruled the visitations could continue but warned Awilda not to hit her daughter.\n\nIn 1993, Elisa’s father made plans to relocate with Elisa to Cuba, he bought airline tickets for both of them for May 1994. The story took a tragic turn when Elisa’s father was admitted to the hospital with respiratory complications and was diagnosed with lung cancer. On the very day he booked the plane tickets for he died. Upon hearing about his death, Elisa’s teachers contacted a court judge expressing concerns about Elisa’s care if her mother was to gain full custody.\n\nAwilda applied for full, permanent custody of Elisa. Elisa’s paternal aunt attempted to challenge this custody and asked for custody of Elisa herself but was denied. Awilda’s application for full custody of Elisa was granted in September 1994.\n\nWhen Awilda was given full custody she changed Elisa’s school to a public school. Elisa was observed as withdrawn, disturbed and uncommunicative. In March 1995, an anonymous letter was sent to Child Welfare Authorities informing them that Awilda had been cutting off Elisa’s hair and locking her in a dark room. Six days later, Elisa was admitted to hospital with a fractured shoulder that had not been treated for 3 days. Elisa’s school continued to report concerns but were told their worries were 'not reportable’ due to lack of evidence. Awilda eventually fully withdrew Elisa from school.\n\nElisa was repeatedly locked in her bedroom and not allowed to talk to others. Neighbours reported hearing the young girl pleading with her mother not to be beaten and crying late into the night. She was sexually violated, forced to eat faeces and burned among other horrific abuses.\n\nOn 15th November, Elisa is thought to have died after being thrown against a wall days earlier. The police were called by a concerned neighbour and Awilda and Elisa’s step-father were both taken into custody. An autopsy revealed a catalogue of traumatic and horrific injuries including broken fingers, damage to organs, deep welts and burns and evidence of sexual assault. The injuries had been sustained over a prolonged period.\n\nAwilda Lopez pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was offered a deal in which she would become eligible for parole after serving 15 years in prison. Carlos Lopez, Elisa’s stepfather, was sentenced to one-and-a-half to three years in prison. Elisa’s siblings were removed from the family home and raised in separate foster homes, all five suffered from severe psychological trauma due to the extreme violence they had been forced to witness.\n\nThe case was described by New York City authorities as to the 'worst case of child abuse they had ever seen."
