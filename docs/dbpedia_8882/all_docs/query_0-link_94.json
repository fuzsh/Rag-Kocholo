        "text": "Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.\n\nDo not travel to North Korea due to the continuing serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals. Exercise increased caution to North Korea due to the critical threat of wrongful detention.\n\nAll U.S. passports are invalid for travel to, in, or through the DPRK unless specially validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State.\n\nSpecial validations are granted only in very limited circumstances. More information on how to apply for the special validation is available here.\n\nThe U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in North Korea as it does not have diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea. Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency services. The North Korean government routinely delays or denies Swedish officials access to detained U.S. citizens.\n\nDue to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of North Korea, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to North Korea.\n\nIf you receive a special validation to travel to North Korea:\n\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nU.S. passports are not valid for travel into, in, or through the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea) due to the serious and mounting risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. citizens in North Korea. Those traveling on U.S. passports in North Korea should have already departed North Korea. Those who wish to travel to North Korea on a U.S. passport after this time must obtain a special validation in a limited validity passport under 22 C.F.R. 51.64, which will be granted only under very limited circumstances. U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizen nationals abroad can apply for this special validation at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\n\nWith a special validation to enter North Korea in a limited passport: one to three months validity to enter North Korea. If you enter and depart North Korea through China, six months validity on your passport with multiple entry/exit visas for China. Note: you cannot enter North Korea through the Demilitarized Zone from South Korea.\n\nIf you enter North Korea without a special validation: the Department of State can revoke your passport for misuse under 22 C.F.R. 51.62(a)(2). Further, you may be subject to felony prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1544 for misuse of a U.S. passport.\n\nWhere to apply for a DPRK visa: DPRK Embassy in Beijing, China or in any country that has diplomatic relations with North Korea.\n\nThe Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Beijing:\n\nNo. 11, Ritan Bei Lu,\n\nJianguomen Wai,\n\nChaoyang District\n\nBeijing, China 100600\n\nTelephone: (86-10) 6532-6639 (Visa Office)\n\nTelephone: (86-10) 65312-1186\n\nFacsimile: (86-10) 6532-6056\n\nIf you reside in the United States, inquire through the DPRK Mission to the UN whether your request for a DPRK visa will be approved before you leave the United States for China:\n\nThe Permanent Representative of the Democratic\n\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to the United Nations\n\n820 Second Avenue\n\nNew York, NY 10017\n\nTelephone: (212) 972-3105\n\nFacsimile: (212) 972-3154\n\nIf you reside in a country with diplomatic relations with the DPRK, ask the DPRK embassy in that country for visa advice.\n\nIf you try to enter North Korea without required travel documents: you may be denied entry, fined, detained, arrested, or imprisoned.\n\nIf you plan to enter and depart North Korea through China without multiple Chinese visas in your passport or with Chinese visas that expire before you depart North Korea, you may not be able to exit North Korea.\n\nHIV/AIDS: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrtictions for visitors to or foreign residents of North Korea.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nPlease see the sections on “Local Laws and Special Circumstances” and “Criminal Penalties.”\n\nCrime: North Korea does not release crime statistics. Petty thefts have been reported at the airport in Pyongyang.\n\nDo not buy counterfeit and/or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. The purchase of counterfeit and pirated goods is illegal in the United States and may be illegal in North Korea.\n\nSee the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.\n\nVictims of Crime: Report the crime to your local host/liaison and contact the Embassy of Sweden for assistance. Your local host/liaison should contact the local authorities on your behalf.\n\nLost or Stolen Passports:\n\nIf your passport is lost or stolen in North Korea, you will need to contact the Embassy of Sweden in Pyongyang, U.S. Protecting Power, for assistance in reaching out to a U.S. Embassy or Consulate and obtaining a replacement passport. You will also need a replacement visa for China.\n\nPlease see our information for victims of crime, including possible victim compensation programs in the United States.\n\nTourism: Individuals cannot use a U.S. passport to travel to, in, or through North Korea without a special validation from the Department of State. Special Validations are granted only if it is in the US national interest to do so. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nLOCAL LAWS\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the Embassy of Sweden immediately. See our webpage for further information\n\nEducate yourself about North Korean law. The North Korea legal system is an instrument of state power and not an independent branch of the government. Protections guaranteed under the U.S. legal system do not apply, and your U.S. passport does not confer special status. Your local host/liaison may be able to provide useful guidance. However, do not assume your host will provide assistance to you if you are arrested, or that any information you shared with your host will not be turned over to North Korean authorities.\n\nCriminal acts unique to North Korea:\n\nShowing disrespect (both physically and verbally) to the country’s former leaders, Kil Il Sung or Kim Jong Il, or the country’s current leader, Kim Jong Un including but not limited to tampering with or mishandling materials bearing their names or images such as money, newspapers, or political slogans in Korean\n\nEntering North Korea without proper travel documentation\n\nPossessing material, printed or digital including e-book readers, DVDs, USB drives, documents, literature, audio and video files that is critical of or hostile to North Korea\n\nProselytizing or carrying out religious activities, including activities that may be construed as such, like leaving behind religious materials, either intentionally or unintentionally\n\nEngaging in unsanctioned political activities\n\nUnauthorized interacting with North Koreans\n\nTaking unauthorized photographs\n\nHaving unauthorized conversations with North Koreans\n\nTraveling without authorization even for short distances\n\nExchanging currency with an unauthorized vendor\n\nShopping at stores not designated for foreigners\n\nBringing pornography into the country\n\nNo Expectation of Privacy:\n\nAll electronic and multimedia devices including USB drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, Internet browsing histories, and cookies are subject to search for banned content.\n\nPersonal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.\n\nIf DPRK authorities permit you to keep your mobile phone when you enter the country, it will not function unless you use the DPRK mobile service, which will enable DPRK authorities to monitor your calls. GPS-trackers and satellite phones are not allowed.\n\nA host or minder will keep track of you.\n\nRemoving or tampering with political slogans and signs or pictures of political leaders.\n\nCriminal Penalties: At least 16 U.S. citizens have been detained in North Korea in the past ten years. While in North Korea, you are subject to North Korean laws. If you violate North Korean laws, even unwittingly, you may be:\n\nHeld in isolation without charges for lengthy periods of time,\n\nInterrogated without counsel,\n\nCompelled to draft public confessions,\n\nTried,\n\nConvicted,\n\nSentenced, and\n\nSent to a labor camp for years.\n\nSome laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nSPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nPress: North Korea officials watch journalists closely to prevent them from unauthorized conversations with North Koreans or questioning the policies, actions, or public statements of North Korea’s leadership.\n\nNorth Korea has confiscated objectionable material from foreign journalists.\n\nJournalists who engaged in activities that challenged the regime have been deported, arrested, or detained to face criminal charges.\n\nFor additional information on the lack of freedom of information in North Korea, see the Department of State’s Human Rights Report for North Korea.\n\nU.S. Government Economic Sanctions Against North Korea: North Korea remains one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world.\n\nThe government of North Korea and the Workers’ Party of Korea are blocked persons, and U.S. citizens may generally not engage in transactions with them or with their property.\n\nMost exports to North Korea are subject to licensing by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\nThe importation and exportation of goods, services, and technology from or to North Korea are generally prohibited unless authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and, for exports or goods, the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\nUN Security Council statements November 17, 2017: For information on the United States and the United Nations Security Council concern regarding escalating tensions from the recent missile launch, and other activities prohibited by United Nations Security Council Resolutions, see UN website.\n\nCustoms Regulations: North Korean authorities may seize documents, literature, audio and video files, computer equipment, DVDs, USB drives and other digital media, and letters deemed by North Korean officials to be pornographic or intended for religious proselytizing or subversive activities. Please see our information on customs regulations.\n\nDual Nationality: North Korea does not recognize dual nationality. If you are of Korean heritage – even if you are a U.S. citizen – you could be subject to ten years of military service in North Korea and taxes on foreign source income. Please see our information on Information on Dual Nationality.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report.\n\nLGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations because same-sex sexual relations are considered a foreign phenomenon. DPRK claims that there are no LGBTI in the country. It would therefore not be possible to organize an LGBTI event here.\n\nAdditionally, any open demonstration of affection is frowned upon, as well as between opposite sex couples.\n\nSee our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details.\n\nPersons with Mobility Issues. Hotels and medical facilities are generally accessible. However, pavements/curbs are high.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nIf you have medical problems, do not travel to North Korea:\n\nMedical facilities in the DPRK lack resources and electricity.\n\nMedical personnel have inadequate or outdated skills.\n\nHospitals in Pyongyang can perform basic examinations and lifesaving measures, but functioning x-ray facilities are not generally available.\n\nAvoid surgery.\n\nIf you have an accident outside Pyongyang, transport back to the capital can be lengthy and without medical assistance.\n\nHospitals will expect immediate U.S. dollar cash payment for medical treatment.\n\nYou cannot use credit cards or checks in the DPRK.\n\nCarry your regular medication with you along with the doctor’s prescription: DPRK Customs says that most prescription medication may be brought into the country with no restrictions.\n\nMedical Evacuations: Local DPRK hosts are often not aware of options available for medical evacuations and might claim that no such options exist.\n\nInsist on contacting the Embassy of Sweden, which will attempt to arrange flight clearances for air ambulances performing emergency medical evacuations.\n\nCosts for medical air evacuation vary, but according to SOS International, an evacuation from Pyongyang to Beijing averages approximately USD 40,000 including medical personnel (1 doctor and 1 nurse), the aircraft, and clearance costs.\n\nThe General Bureau of the Koryo Civil Aviation of the DPRK says that it provides around-the-clock service and that requests for air clearance will be granted within 24 hours.\n\nIf a U.S. citizen with a medical emergency is in Pyongyang, the Embassy of Sweden can usually arrange a medical evacuation to Beijing in one day. If the patient is located outside Pyongyang, it will take longer.\n\nMedical evacuation by regularly scheduled airlines can be arranged, but very few flights operate from Pyongyang to Beijing (Air Koryo and Air China), Shenyang (Air Koryo), or Vladivostok (Air Koryo).\n\nAir Koryo flights go to Shanghai only on a charter basis in the tourist season (April-October).\n\nIn order to transit China, Chinese visas for injured foreigners and any escorts must be obtained prior to the evacuation from North Korea. Even in the case of a medical emergency, transit visas may take several days to arrange.\n\nEvacuation across the DMZ to South Korea is not allowed.\n\nVaccinations: Information on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection are located at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the CDC Internet site. For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad, consult the World Health Organization's (WHO) website. If you have special dietary requirements, you are advised to bring food with you to North Korea, as the restaurants available to foreigners have limited menus that may not meet your dietary needs.\n\nCompanies that may be able to arrange evacuation services include, but are not limited to, those listed below. You may wish to contact these or other emergency medical assistance providers for information about their ability to provide medical evacuation insurance and/or assistance for travelers to North Korea.\n\nInternational SOS\n\nTelephone (inside China): 400-818-0767\n\nTelephone (outside China): (86-10) 6462-9100\n\nUnited Healthcare Global Assistance\n\nTelephone: (U.S.) (410) 453-6330\n\nTelephone: (Toll free within China) 10-8888-800-527-0218\n\nTelephone: (outside China) (86-10) 6595-8510)\n\nYou can find useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas insurance programs, on the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs website.\n\nAlso, see our extensive tips and advice on Traveling Safely Abroad.\n\nBills - We do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas: The DPRK says U.S. citizens are accountable for costs associated with detention or incarceration in North Korea such as lodging, food, telephone calls, and medical assistance (hospital bills).\n\nMake sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance (our webpage) to cover medical evacuation. Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\n\nMajor country-specific health concerns: Tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in North Korea. For further information, please consult the CDC's information on TB.\n\nBe up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor further health information, go to:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nTRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: Road conditions and driving habits in a foreign country can differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning North Korea is provided for general reference only. You are not allowed to drive in North Korea unless you hold a valid DPRK driver’s license. Bicycles are unavailable for rental or purchase. Please refer to our Road Safety information.\n\nAVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT: As there is no direct commercial air service between the United States and North Korea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed North Korea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA's safety assessment page.\n\nAs a result of concerns arising from unannounced missile launch activities and GPS navigation systems interference and/or disruption, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Prohibition and Advisory notice to U.S. airmen and operators. The FAA has issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 79 which prohibits U.S. civil aviation from flying in the Pyongyang Flight Information Region (FIR) west of 132 degrees east longitude, and the FAA has advised those flying in and around the Pyongyang (FIR) east of 132 degrees east longitude to be aware of possible GPS interruptions. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.\n\nMARITIME SAFETY OVERSIGHT: Mariners planning travel in the vicinity of North Korea should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Security Communications with Industry WebPortal. Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website and as a broadcast warning on the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website."
