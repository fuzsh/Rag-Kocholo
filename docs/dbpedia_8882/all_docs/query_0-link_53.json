The currency was introduced in 1947, following the country's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. The North Korean Won is not traded internationally, and it is not convertible to other currencies. The currency is heavily controlled by the government, and its value is determined by the state-run central bank. Understanding the economic background of North Korea is crucial to comprehending the value and role of the North Korean Won.\n\n1. The North Korean Economy\n\nNorth Korea is a highly centralized command economy, with the government controlling almost all aspects of the economy. The country has a small industrial base, and most of its economic activity is focused on agriculture and mining. The country has been under international sanctions for many years, which has severely limited its ability to trade with other countries. As a result, the North Korean economy is heavily reliant on China for trade and aid.\n\n2. The role of the Central bank\n\nIn North Korea, the central bank plays a crucial role in controlling the value of the North Korean Won.

In reality, the North Korean Won is heavily undervalued, and its real value is difficult to determine.\n\n4. The Black Market\n\nDue to the highly controlled nature of the North Korean economy, a black market for foreign currency has emerged.

The government has attempted to crack down on the black market, but it remains a significant part of the economy.\n\n5. Investing in North Korea\n\nInvesting in North Korea is highly risky due to the country's unstable political situation and the heavily controlled nature of the economy. The government has a history of expropriating foreign assets, and there is little legal recourse for investors.
