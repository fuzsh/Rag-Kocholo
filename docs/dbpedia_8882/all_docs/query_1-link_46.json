        "text": "Currency\n\nCurious about Korean currency and Korean money?\n\nIn this article, we’ll talk about South Korea’s currency, the history of Korean money, the different Korean bills and coins, and why you should learn about Korean money.\n\nRead on to learn more about the South Korean Won, also known as South Korean Won, Korean Republic Won, or KRW if you want to call it by its three-digit currency code.\n\nKorean Money\n\nOver the past decades, we’ve seen Korea evolve into one of the strongest economies in Asia. It’s fascinating to know that the South Korean economy and the South Korean currency have improved a lot after what the country has gone through, including what happened during World War II and the Korean War.\n\nHow to say “money” in Korean\n\nBefore we dive deeper into this lesson, let’s first learn how to say “money” in Korean.\n\nThe Korean word for “money” is 돈 (don).\n\nSample sentence:\n\n우리가 쇼핑을 가기 전에 ATM에서 돈을 인출해야 해요. (uriga shoppingeul gagi jeone ATM-eseo doneul inchulhaeya haeyo.)\n\nI need to withdraw some money from the ATM before we go shopping.\n\nKorean Currency\n\nThe official name for Korean money is “Won.” This is the name used for both South Korean and North Korean currency. This became the official currency for both countries after being divided into two.\n\nThe name “won” originated from a Hanja character similar to the Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen.\n\nAlthough this is where the Korean money’s name came from, their value is quite different. For instance, 1 KRW equals 0.10 Japanese Yen (JPY) and only 0.005 Chinese Yuan (CNY).\n\nAnother way of looking at it would be that 1 US Dollar to South Korean Won would be 1,218.28 KRW, 6.36 CNY in Chinese Yuan, and 123.87 JPY in Japanese Yuan.\n\nWhat is the currency in Korea?\n\nThe official currency of South Korea is the Korean Republic Won or simply the South Korean Won. In Korean, this currency is called 대한민국 원 (daehanminguk won).\n\nWhat is KRW?\n\nSouth Korean’s currency is the South Korean Won, or KRW. This currency uses the symbol “₩.”\n\nHistory of the Korean Won\n\nThe currency in Korea dates back hundreds of years to the Joseon Dynasty. During Joseon, Koreans made use of coins made of bronze and iron, which are known as 통보 (t’ongbo) and 정보 (jeongbo), respectively. Paper money, or 저화 (jeohwa) in Korean, was first used during the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nFast forward to the present day, Korean currency makes use of Korean bills and coins. In them are printed images of people who have made significant contributions to South Korea.\n\nThe first South Korean Won bills were issued by the Bank of Joseon but later on, were issued by the Bank of Korea.\n\nIt’s impressive that when learning more about South Korean Won, you can’t help but also learn about Korean history.\n\nHow does Korean Money work?\n\nCurrently, four South Korean banknotes or paper bills are in circulation in the country. These are the 50000 won bill, 10000 won bill, 5000 won bill, and 1000 won bill.\n\nAs for the South Korean won coin denominations, there are currently four that are in circulation. These are the 10-won coin, 50-won coin, 100-won coin, and the 500-won coin.\n\nCan't read Korean yet?

Let the fun facts begin!\n\nKorean Bills\n\nThere are four different Korean won bills issued by the Bank of Korea and used in South Korea. They are 50,000 won, 10,000 won, 5,000 won, and 1,000 won.\n\nThe bills get larger as they go up. The 5,000 won bill is slightly larger than the 1,000 won bill, and the 10,000 won bill is somewhat larger than the 5,000 won bill.\n\nMany of the names here are written in Hangeul, the Korean Alphabet. If you can’t read Korean characters yet, you can learn them for free in about one hour here.\n\nNote: We have added each KRW to USD rate below. However, you can use Google Currency Converter for more accurate conversions and updated exchange rates.\n\n1,000 won\n\nThe front of the ₩1,000 bill features 퇴계이황 Toegye Yi Hwang (1501 – 1570).\n\nYi Hwang was a famous Confucian scholar from the Joseon Dynasty (That’s the 500-year Confucian dynasty in Korea!) who was big into calligraphy and poetry.\n\nIf you’re wondering who Toegye is, great question! That was his pen name. Yi Hwang was a busy guy.\n\nThe back of the ₩1,000 bill is the 계상정거도 Gyesangjeonggeodo. In addition to being an impressively long name for a painting, the backside of the 1,000 won bill also represents a painting of Yi Hwang in Dosan Seowon (area of Korea).\n\nIf you’ve ever visited present-day Andong in Korea, then you have been to Dosan Seowon!\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\nThe USD exchange rate of ₩1,000 (KRW) is less than 1 USD, around $0.78.\n\n5,000 won\n\nThe front side of the ₩5,000 bill is 율곡이이 Yulgok Yi I (1536 – 1584).\n\nLike Yi Hwang, Yi I (pronounced “yee-ee”) was also a mover and a shaker back in the 1500s. He attained fame as a Confucian scholar and flew under the radar with his pen name Yulgok.\n\nThe backside is another famous painting, 초충도 Chochungdo. This painting was made by Shin Saimdang (Yi I’s mother). It’s called “Insects and Plants.”\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\nThe USD exchange rate of ₩5,000 (KRW) is roughly $4.07.\n\n10,000 won\n\nThe ₩10,000 bill features 세종대왕 Sejong the Great (1397 – 1450).\n\nIf you haven’t heard of this 4th king of the Joseon Dynasty, then consider this the first of many times that you will! He is the one responsible for introducing Hangeul into Korean society. Hangeul is essential to Korean society; it even has its own holiday!\n\nThe back of the 10,000 won bill is the 혼천시계 Honcheonsigye.\n\nSince “sigye” means “clock” in Korean, we can call the picture on the back of this note the “Hocheon Clock.” 혼천시계 (honcheonsigye) is an astronomical clock that was made in 1669 and is still in existence today. If you’re ever sitting in your house and wondering what the position of the universe is at any given time, you’ll want to stop by Korea University to consult with the Hocehon Clock in person!\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\nThe USD exchange rate of ₩10,000 (KRW) is roughly $8.14.\n\n50,000 won\n\nThe front of the ₩50,000 bill is 신사임당 Shin Saimdang (1504 – 1551).\n\nTry saying that name four times fast! Shin Saimdang was the mother of Yi I, as well as a writer, artist, calligraphist, and poet. Her artwork captured beautiful and delicate images of insects, flowers, fish, and landscapes. People liked her because she was a model of Confucian ideals.\n\nAt the back of the bill is the 월매도 Wolmaedo. Fairly simple; this is a painting of bamboo and a plum tree.\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\nThe US dollar exchange rate of ₩50,000 (KRW) is roughly $40.69.\n\nThere you have it, the big four in Korean currency.\n\nNow, let’s move on to the coins!\n\nKorean Coins\n\nCrack open your piggy banks; we’re about to give you the need-to-know information for each of those famous coins you often see.
