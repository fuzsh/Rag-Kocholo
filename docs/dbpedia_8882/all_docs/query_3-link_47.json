        "text": "Bank notes in North Korea\n\nby: KTG\n\nHi Rosa,\n\nTerribly sorry for such a late reply to your comment! Those currencies are fine. Regarding the conditions of the notes you are right that they should not be torn or spoiled, we always explain this to travellers before their departure date to the DPRK. Serial numbers - we have never heard of this and have never had any customers have issues with the serial numbers of their bank notes.\n\nIt's also worthwhile pointing out that you should try to avoid taking in large denomination bills as they may struggle to find change for this (and you may received change in a variety of currencies).\n\nPlease do let us know if you have any other questions regarding money in North Korea.\n\nCheers,\n\nKTG\n\nCurrencies for North Korea.\n\nby: Rosa\n\nI have been informed to take US$, Euros Pounds Sterling and RMB in coins and notes must be straight off the press must not be bent or have nay nips in them and all in certain serial numbers.\n\nI have been advised that there are three exchange rates: Airport, Official and Street Rate. What coinage and bills do you recommend taking? How does one find out what serail numbers are acceptable as I believe that there are similar problems like this in Burma.\n\nUsing money in North Korea\n\nby: KTG\n\nHi Al,\n\nWe recommend taking around 50 Euros per day. Not that you will necessary use it, but as there are not ATMs and cards cannot be used in North Korea, you'd be better off having more on you than less.\n\nCheers,\n\nKTG"
