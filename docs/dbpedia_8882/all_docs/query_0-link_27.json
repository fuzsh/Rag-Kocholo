A single won is divided into 100 jeon, the monetary subunit. The jeon is no longer used for everyday transactions, and it appears only in foreign exchange rates. The currency is issued by the Bank of Korea, based in the capital city of Seoul.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Korean won\n\nThe old \"won\" was a cognate of the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, which were both derived from the Spanish-American silver dollar. It is derived from the hanja 圓 (원, won), meaning \"round\", which describes the shape of the silver dollar.\n\nThe won was subdivided into 100 jeon (Korean: 전; Hanja: 錢; MR: chŏn), itself a cognate of the Chinese unit of weight mace and synonymous with money in general. The current won (1962 to present) is written in hangul only and does not officially have any hanja associated with it.[3][4]\n\nFirst South Korean won\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Korean won, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen were all derived from the Spanish-American silver dollar, a coin widely used for international trade between Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries.\n\nDuring the colonial era under the Japanese (1910–45), the won was replaced by the Korean yen which was at par with the Japanese yen.\n\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, Korea was divided, resulting in two separate currencies, both called won, for the South and the North. Both the Southern won and the Northern won replaced the yen at par. The first South Korean won was subdivided into 100 jeon.\n\nThe South Korean won initially had a fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 15 won to 1 dollar. A series of devaluations followed, the later ones, in part, due to the Korean War (1950–53). The pegs were:\n\nPegs for the first South Korean won Date introduced Value of U.S. dollar in won October, 1945 15 July 15, 1947 50 October 1, 1948 450 June 14, 1949 900 (non-government transactions only) May 1, 1950 1,800 November 1, 1950 2,500 April 1, 1951 6,000\n\nThe first South Korean won was replaced by the hwan on February 15, 1953, at a rate of 1 hwan = 100 won.[5]\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1946, the Bank of Joseon introduced 10 and 100 won notes. These were followed in 1949 by 5 and 1,000 won notes.\n\nA new central bank, the Bank of Korea, was established on 12 June 1950,[6] and assumed the duties of Bank of Joseon. Notes were introduced (some dated 1949) in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 jeon, and 100 and 1,000 won. The 500 won notes were introduced in 1952. In 1953, a series of banknotes was issued which, although it gave the denominations in English in won, were, in fact, the first issues of the hwan.\n\nSecond South Korean won\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe won was reintroduced on June 10, 1962, at a rate of 1 won = 10 hwan. It became the sole legal tender on March 22, 1975, with the withdrawal of the last circulating hwan coins. Its ISO 4217 code is KRW. At the reintroduction of the won in 1962, its value was pegged at 125 won = US$1. The following pegs operated between 1962 and 1980:\n\nPegs for the second South Korean won Date introduced Value of U.S. dollar in won June 10, 1962 125 May 3, 1964 255 August 3, 1972 400 December 7, 1974 480 January 12, 1980 580\n\nOn February 27, 1980, efforts were initiated to lead to a floating exchange rate. The won was finally allowed to float on December 24, 1997, when an agreement was signed with the International Monetary Fund.[7] Shortly after, the won was devalued to almost half of its value, as part of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\n\nCoins\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil 1966, 10 and 50 hwan coins, revalued as 1 and 5 won, were the only coins in circulation. New coins, denominated in won, were introduced by the Bank of Korea on August 16, 1966, in denominations of 1, 5 and 10 won, with the 1 won struck in brass and the 5 and 10 won in bronze. These were the first South Korean coins to display the date in the Gregorian calendar, earlier coins having used the Korean calendar. The 10 and 50 hwan coins were demonetized on March 22, 1975.[8]\n\nIn 1968, as the intrinsic value of the brass 1 won coin far surpassed its face value, new aluminium 1 won coins were issued to replace them. As an attempt to further reduce currency production costs, new 5 and 10 won coins were issued in 1970, struck in brass. Cupronickel 100 won coins were also introduced that year, followed by cupronickel 50 won coins in 1972.[8]\n\n1966–1982 issued coins[9][10] (in Korean) Image Value Technical parameters Description Date of BOK series designation Obverse Reverse Diameter Mass Composition Edge Obverse Reverse First minting Issue Issue Suspended ₩1 17.2 mm 1.7 g Brass\n\n60% copper\n\n40% zinc Plain Rose of Sharon, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1966 August 16, 1966 December 1, 1980 Series I (가) ₩1 17.2 mm 0.729 g 100% aluminium Plain Rose of Sharon, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1968 August 26, 1968 1992 Series II (나) ₩5 20.4 mm 3.09 g Commercial bronze\n\n88% copper\n\n12% zinc Plain Geobukseon, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1966 August 16, 1966 1992 Series I (가) ₩5 20.4 mm 2.95 g High brass\n\n65% copper\n\n35% zinc Plain Geobukseon, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1970 July 16, 1970 1992 Series II (나) ₩10 22.86 mm 4.22 g Commercial bronze\n\n88% copper\n\n12% zinc Plain Dabotap Pagoda, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1966 August 16, 1966 Still circulating Series I (가) ₩10 22.86 mm 4.06 g High brass\n\n65% copper\n\n35% zinc Plain Dabotap Pagoda, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1970 July 16, 1970 Still circulating Series II (나) ₩50 21.6 mm 4.16 g 70% copper\n\n18% zinc\n\n12% nickel Reeded Stalk of rice, value (hangul) Value (digit), bank title (hangul), year of minting 1972 December 1, 1972 Still circulating Series I (가) ₩100 24 mm 5.42 g Cupronickel\n\n75% copper\n\n25% nickel Yi Sun-sin, value, bank title (hangul) Value (digit), year of minting 1970 November 30, 1970 These images are to scale at 2.5 pixels per millimetre.

In January 1983, with the purpose of standardizing the coinage, a new series of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won coins was issued, using the same layout as the 500 won coins, but conserving the coins' old themes.[8]\n\n1982–2006 issued coins[11][12] Image Value Technical parameters Description Date of BOK series designation Obverse Reverse Diameter Mass Composition Edge Obverse Reverse First minting Issue ₩1 [ko] 17.2 mm 0.729 g 100% aluminium Plain Rose of Sharon, value (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1983 January 15, 1983 Series III (다) ₩5 [ko] 20.4 mm 2.95 g High brass\n\n65% copper\n\n35% zinc Plain Geobukseon, value (hangul) Value (digit), bank title, year of minting 1983 January 15, 1983 Series III (다) ₩10 22.86 mm 4.06 g Dabotap Pagoda, value (hangul) These images are to scale at 2.5 pixels per millimetre.

For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nThe Bank of Korea announced in early 2006 its intention to redesign the 10 won coin by the end of that year. With the increasing cost of production, then at 38 won per 10 won coin, and rumors that some people had been melting the coins to make jewelry, the redesign was needed to make the coin more cost-effective to produce.[13] The new coin is made of copper-coated aluminium with a reduced diameter of 18 mm, and a weight of 1.22 g. Its visual design is the same as the old coin.[14] The new coin was issued on December 18, 2006.[15][16]\n\nThe 1 and 5 won coins are rarely in circulation since 1992, and prices of consumer goods are rounded to the nearest 10 won. However, they are still in production, minting limited amounts of these two coins every year, for the Bank of Korea's annual mint sets.[17] In 1998, the production costs per coin were: 10 won coins each cost 35 won to produce, 100 won coins cost 58 won, and 500 won coins cost 77 won.[18]\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bank of Korea designates banknote and coin series in a unique way. Instead of putting those of similar design and issue dates in the same series, it assigns series number X to the Xth design of a given denomination. The series numbers are expressed with Korean letters used in alphabetical order, e.g. 가, 나, 다, 라, 마, 바, 사. Therefore, 1,000 won issued in 1983 is series II (나) because it is the second design of all 1,000 won designs since the introduction of the South Korean won in 1962.\n\nIn 1962, 10 and 50 jeon, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 won notes were introduced by the Bank of Korea. The first issue of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 won notes was printed in the UK by Thomas De La Rue. The jeon notes together with a second issue of 10 and 100 won notes were printed domestically by the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation.\n\nIn 1965, 100 won notes (series III) were printed using intaglio printing techniques, for the first time on domestically printed notes, to reduce counterfeiting. Replacements for the British 500 won notes followed in 1966, also using intaglio printing, and for the 50 won notes in 1969 using lithoprinting.[8]\n\n1962 Thomas De La Rue Series[9] (in Korean) Image Value Dimensions Main color Description Date of BOK series designation Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse Issue Issue Suspended ₩1 94 × 50 mm Pink Bank of Korea's symbol Value June 10, 1962 May 20, 1970 None ₩5 Blue May 1, 1969 ₩10 108 × 54 mm Green September 1, 1962 Series I (가) ₩50 156 × 66 mm Orange Haegeumgang near Geoje Torch, value May 20, 1970 ₩100 Green Independence Gate (Dongnimmun) February 14, 1969 ₩500 Grey Namdaemun February 3, 1967 1962–1969 KOMSCO Series[9] (in Korean) 10 jeon 90 × 50 mm Blue \"Bank of Korea\" and value (Korean) \"Bank of Korea\" and value (English) December 1, 1962 December 1, 1980 None 50 jeon Brown ₩10 140 × 63 mm Purple Cheomseongdae Geobukseon September 21, 1962 October 30, 1973 Series II (나) ₩50 149 × 64 mm Green and orange / blue Tapgol Park in Seoul Beacon, Rose of Sharon March 21, 1969 Series II (나) ₩100 156 × 66 mm Green Independence Gate Gyeonghoeru Pavilion at Gyeongbok Palace November 1, 1962 Series II (나) Sejong the Great Main building of the Bank of Korea August 14, 1965 December 1, 1980 Series III (다) ₩500 165 × 73 mm Brown Namdaemun Geobukseon August 16, 1966 May 10, 1975 Series II (나) These images are to scale at 0.7 pixel per millimetre. For table standards, see the banknote specification table.\n\nWith the economic development from the 1960s, the value of the 500 won notes fell, resulting in a greater use of cashier's checks with higher fixed denominations as means of payment, as well as an increased use of counterfeited ones.[8] In 1970, the 100 won notes were replaced by coins, with the same happening to the 50 won notes in 1972.\n\nHigher-denomination notes of 5,000 and 10,000 won were introduced in 1972 and 1973, respectively. The notes incorporated new security features, including watermark, security thread, and ultraviolet response fibres, and were intaglio printed. The release of 10,000 won notes was planned to be at the same time as the 5,000 won notes, but problems with the main theme delayed it by a year.[19] Newly designed 500 won notes were also released in 1973, and the need for a medium denomination resulted in the introduction of 1,000 won notes in 1975.\n\n1972–1973 Series[10] (in Korean) Image Value Dimensions Main color Description Date of BOK series designation Plate produced Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse Watermark Issue Issue Suspended ₩5,000 167 × 77 mm Brown Yi I Main building of the Bank of Korea July 1, 1972 December 1, 1980 Series I (가) By Thomas de la Rue[20] ₩10,000 171 × 81 mm Green Sejong the Great, Rose of Sharon Geunjeongjeon at Gyeongbok Palace June 12, 1973 November 10, 1981 Series I (가) In Japan[19] 1973–1979 Series[10] (in Korean) ₩500 159 × 69 mm Green and pink Yi Sun-sin, Geobukseon Yi Sun-sin's Shrine at Hyeonchungsa None September 1, 1973 May 12, 1993 Series III (다) ₩1,000 163 × 73 mm Purple Yi Hwang, Rose of Sharon Dosan Seowon (Dosan Confucian Academy) August 14, 1975 Series I (가) In Japan[21] ₩5,000 167 × 77 mm Orange Yi I Ojukheon in Gangneung June 1, 1977 May 12, 1993 Series II (나) In Japan[20] ₩10,000 171 × 81 mm Green Sejong the Great, Water clock Gyeonghoeru Pavilion at Gyeongbok Palace, Rose of Sharon June 15, 1979 May 12, 1993 Series II (나) In Japan[19] These images are to scale at 0.7 pixel per millimetre. For table standards, see the banknote specification table.\n\nIn 1982, the 500 won note was replaced by a coin. The following year, as part of its policy of rationalizing the currency system, the Bank of Korea issued a new set of notes, as well as a new set of coins. Some of the notes' most notable features were distinguishable marks for the blind under the watermark and the addition of machine-readable language in preparation for mechanization of cash handling. They were also printed on better-quality cotton pulp to reduce the production costs by extending their circulation life.[8]\n\nTo cope with the deregulation of imports of color printers and the increasing use of computers and scanners, modified 5,000 and 10,000 won notes were released between 1994 and 2002 with various new security features, which included color-shifting ink, microprint, segmented metal thread, moiré, and EURion constellation. The latest version of the 5,000 and 10,000 won notes are easily identifiable by the copyright information inscribed under the watermark: \"© 한국은행\" and year of issue on the obverse, \"© The Bank of Korea\" and year of issue on the reverse.\n\nThe plates for the 5,000 won notes were produced in Japan, while the ones for the 1,000 and 10,000 won notes were produced by the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation. They were all printed in intaglio.[19][20][21]\n\n1983–2002 Series[22] (in Korean) Image Value Dimensions Main Color Description Date of issue Suspended Date BOK series designation Modification Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse Watermark ₩1,000 151 × 76 mm Purple Yi Hwang Dosan Seowon (Dosan Confucian Academy) Reversed portrait June 11, 1983 June 1, 2016 Series II (나) ₩5,000 156 × 76 mm Orange Yi I Ojukheon in Gangneung June 11, 1983 Series III (다) June 12, 2002 Series IV (라) Color-shifting ink on the dots for blinds, segmented metal thread, copyright inscription ₩10,000 161 × 76 mm Green Sejong the Great, Water clock Gyeonghoeru Pavilion at Gyeongbok Palace October 8, 1983 Series III (다) January 20, 1994 Series IV (라) Segmented metal thread, microprint under the water clock, moiré on watermark area, intaglio latent image Reversed portrait, Taeguk June 19, 2000 Series V (마) Color-shifting ink on the dots for blinds, removal of moiré, EURion constellation, copyright inscription These images are to scale at 0.7 pixel per millimetre. For table standards, see the banknote specification table.\n\nNew security features\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2006, it became a major concern that the South Korean won banknotes were being counterfeited/forged. This led the government to issue a new series of banknotes, with the 5,000 won note being the first one to be redesigned. Later in 2007, the 1,000 and 10,000 won notes were introduced.\n\nOn June 23, 2009, the Bank of Korea released the 50,000 won note. The obverse bears a portrait of Shin Saimdang, a prominent 16th-century artist, calligrapher, and mother of Korean scholar Yulgok, also known as Yi I, who is on the 5,000 won note. This note is the first Korean banknote to feature the portrait of a woman.[23] The release of the 50,000 won note stirred some controversy among shop owners and those with visual impairments due to its similarity in color and numerical denomination with the 5,000 won note.[24]\n\nNew 100,000 won notes were also announced, but their release was later cancelled due to the controversy over the banknote's planned image, featuring the Daedongyeojido map, and not including the disputed Dokdo islands.[25][26][27][28] Also of controversy was the appearance of Kim Ku on the note, who is controversial among the South Korean right.[29]\n\nThe banknotes include over 10 security features in each denomination. The 50,000 won note has 22 security features, the 10,000 won note 21, the 5,000 won note 17, the 2,000 won note 10 and the 1,000 won note 19. Many modern security features that can be also found in euros, pounds, Canadian dollars, and Japanese yen are included in the banknotes. Some security features inserted in won notes are:\n\nHolograms with three-dimensional images that change colors within the metallic foil on the obverse side of the notes (except ₩1,000)\n\nWatermark portraits of the effigy of the note are visible when held to the light in the white section of the note.\n\nIntaglio printing on words and the effigy give off a raised feeling, different from ordinary paper\n\nSecurity thread in the right side of the obverse side of the note with small lettering \"한국은행 Bank of Korea\" and its corresponding denomination\n\nColor-shifting ink on the value number at the back of the note:\n\nFor the first time in the world, KOMSCO, the Korean mint, inserted a new substance in the notes to detect counterfeits. This technique is being exported to Europe, North America, etc.[30]\n\n2006 Series[31] (in Korean) Image Value Dimensions Main color Description Date of issue BOK series designation Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse Watermark ₩1,000 [ko] 136 × 68 mm Blue Yi Hwang, Myeongryundang in Seonggyungwan, plum flowers \"Gyesangjeonggeodo\"; a painting Yi Hwang in Dosan Seowon by Jeong Seon Reversed portrait and electrotype denomination (₩1,000 to ₩50,000) January 22, 2007 Series III (다) ₩5,000 [ko] 142 × 68 mm Orange Yi I, Ojukheon in Gangneung, black bamboo \"Insects and Plants\", a painting of a watermelon and cockscombs by Yi I's mother Shin Saimdang January 2, 2006 Series V (마) ₩10,000 [ko] 148 × 68 mm Green Sejong the Great, Irworobongdo, a folding screen for Joseon-era kings, and text from the second chapter of Yongbieocheonga, the first work of literature written in hangul Globe of Honcheonsigye, Cheonsang Yeolcha Bunyajido C14 star map and reflecting telescope at Bohyeonsan Observatory in the background January 22, 2007 Series VI (바) ₩50,000 [ko] 154 × 68 mm Yellow Shin Saimdang with Chochungdo - a Folding Screen of Embroidered Plants and Insects (South Korean National Treasure No. 595) in the background Bamboo and a plum tree June 23, 2009 Series I (가) These images are to scale at 0.7 pixel per millimetre.

The Bank of Korea began a trial which would result in the total cessation of the production of coins by depositing change into prepaid cards.[33] As of 2019, however, public participation in this program has decreased.[34]\n\nRedenomination proposals\n\n[edit]\n\nThere have been recurring proposals in the South Korean National Assembly to redenominate the won by introducing a new won or new unit, equal to 1,000 old won, and worth nearly one U.S. dollar. While proponents cite a more valuable currency unit better projects the strength of the nation's economy, a majority remain opposed to the idea. Reasons cited are: economic harm if done immediately, no issues on public confidence in the won and its inflation rate, limited cost savings, and the presence of more urgent economic issues.[35]\n\nCurrency production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bank of Korea is the only institution in South Korea with the right to print banknotes and mint coins. The banknotes and coins are printed at the KOMSCO, a government-owned corporation, under the guidance of the Bank of Korea. After the new banknotes and coins are printed/minted, they are bundled or rolled and shipped to the headquarters of the Bank of Korea. When delivered, they are deposited inside the bank's vault, ready to be distributed to commercial banks when requested. Every year, around Seollal and Chuseok, two major Korean holidays, the Bank of Korea distributes large amounts of its currency to most of the commercial banks in South Korea, which are then given to their customers upon request.\n\nCurrent exchange rates\n\n[edit]\n\nRanking\n\n[edit]\n\nMost traded currencies by value\n\nCurrency distribution of global foreign exchange market turnover[36] Rank Currency ISO 4217\n\ncode Symbol or\n\nabbreviation Proportion of daily volume Change\n\n(2019–2022) April 2019 April 2022 1 U.S. dollar USD US$ 88.3% 88.5% 0.2pp 2 Euro EUR € 32.3% 30.5% 1.8pp 3 Japanese yen JPY ¥ / 円 16.8% 16.7% 0.1pp 4 Sterling GBP £ 12.8% 12.9% 0.1pp 5 Renminbi CNY ¥ / 元 4.3% 7.0% 2.7pp 6 Australian dollar AUD A$ 6.8% 6.4% 0.4pp 7 Canadian dollar CAD C$ 5.0% 6.2% 1.2pp 8 Swiss franc CHF CHF 4.9% 5.2% 0.3pp 9 Hong Kong dollar HKD HK$ 3.5% 2.6% 0.9pp 10 Singapore dollar SGD S$ 1.8% 2.4% 0.6pp 11 Swedish krona SEK kr 2.0% 2.2% 0.2pp 12 South Korean won KRW ₩ / 원 2.0% 1.9% 0.1pp 13 Norwegian krone NOK kr 1.8% 1.7% 0.1pp 14 New Zealand dollar NZD NZ$ 2.1% 1.7% 0.4pp 15 Indian rupee INR ₹ 1.7% 1.6% 0.1pp 16 Mexican peso MXN MX$ 1.7% 1.5% 0.2pp 17 New Taiwan dollar TWD NT$ 0.9% 1.1% 0.2pp 18 South African rand ZAR R 1.1% 1.0% 0.1pp 19 Brazilian real BRL R$ 1.1% 0.9% 0.2pp 20 Danish krone DKK kr 0.6% 0.7% 0.1pp 21 Polish złoty PLN zł 0.6% 0.7% 0.1pp 22 Thai baht THB ฿ 0.5% 0.4% 0.1pp 23 Israeli new shekel ILS ₪ 0.3% 0.4% 0.1pp 24 Indonesian rupiah IDR Rp 0.4% 0.4% 25 Czech koruna CZK Kč 0.4% 0.4% 26 UAE dirham AED د.إ 0.2% 0.4% 0.2pp 27 Turkish lira TRY ₺ 1.1% 0.4% 0.7pp 28 Hungarian forint HUF Ft 0.4% 0.3% 0.1pp 29 Chilean peso CLP CLP$ 0.3% 0.3% 30 Saudi riyal SAR ﷼ 0.2% 0.2% 31 Philippine peso PHP ₱ 0.3% 0.2% 0.1pp 32 Malaysian ringgit MYR RM 0.2% 0.2% 33 Colombian peso COP COL$ 0.2% 0.2% 34 Russian ruble RUB ₽ 1.1% 0.2% 0.9pp 35 Romanian leu RON L 0.1% 0.1% 36 Peruvian sol PEN S/ 0.1% 0.1% 37 Bahraini dinar BHD .د.ب 0.0% 0.0% 38 Bulgarian lev BGN BGN 0.0% 0.0% 39 Argentine peso ARS ARG$ 0.1% 0.0% 0.1pp … Other 1.8% 2.3% 0.5pp Total[a] 200.0% 200.0%\n\nCurrent KRW exchange rates From Google Finance: AUD CAD CHF CNY EUR GBP HKD JPY USD EUR JPY USD From Yahoo!
