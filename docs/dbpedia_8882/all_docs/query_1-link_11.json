        "text": "What Is the Korean Won (KRW)?\n\nThe Korean won (KRW) is the national currency of South Korea. Its users denote the won by using the symbol \"₩,\" as in \"₩1,000.\"\n\nIt has been administered by the nation's central bank, the Bank of Korea, since 1950. The won is fully convertible and is routinely traded against other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), the Japanese yen (JPY), and the euro (EUR). One won is divided into 100 subunits, called \"jeon.\"\n\nOne U.S. dollar was equal to approximately 1,325 KRW as of January 2024.\n\nUnderstanding the Korean Won\n\nThe Korean won has been used in some form for thousands of years. It was briefly replaced with a Japanese colonial currency called the Korean yen during the occupation of Korea by Japan from 1910 to 1945.\n\nThe division of North Korea and South Korea resulted in two separate currencies after World War II. They were both called the Korean won. They were initially pegged to the USD at a rate of 15 won to one dollar but several devaluations occurred thereafter due largely to the effects of the Korean War on the nation's economy.\n\nThe Bank of Korea began operations as South Korea's central bank in 1950. It assumed the duties of the previous monetary authority, the Bank of Joseon, with exclusive authority to issue banknotes and coins for the country.\n\nSouth Korea sought to expand the relevance of its currency to international trade by replacing its dollar peg with a basket of currencies in the 1980s. Further changes were made in the late 1990s when the government responded to the Asian Financial Crisis by allowing the won to float freely on foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe Won and Korea's Economy\n\nSouth Korea's economy is one of the largest in Asia and it's a major force in international commerce. Like many advanced economies, it has a large service sector that makes up about 56% of the annual gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nIndustry is a significant component of South Korean GDP, contributing about 32% of the total in 2022, the last year for which comprehensive figures are available.\n\nThe value of the won has been quite stable in the millennium. One USD was equal to 1,117 won in February 2011. The equivalent figure was marginally greater as of December 2023: 1,304 won per USD.\n\nInflation in South Korea declined from 4.67% in 2008 down to .54% in 2020, but it then climbed back up to 3.42% in 2023. The country's economy has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 2.8% per year. Per-capita GDP measured based on purchasing power parity (PPP) grew from $29,644 in 2009 to $50,330 in 2022 in constant international $.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Korean won is the national currency of the Republic of South Korea, a country that boasts an extensive and advanced economy. The won existed in some form for literally thousands of years. A U.S. dollar was worth about 1,325 Korean won as of January 2024, but this is a fluctuating number that can react to numerous factors."
