        "text": "Two days after I visited North Korea with my father Eric — then Google’s executive chairman — in January 2013, I sent a trip report to my friends. The report went 2010s-era viral: millions of views, media requests, and rather a lot of feedback about my choice to publish on Google Sites. I found my one minute of fame overwhelming, so I hid and left the site alone. Recently, my colleague Michael Donohoe noticed that the original report had finally fallen into the internet’s abyss. He offered to reconstitute it for Rest of World. With a wince — who likes their old writing? — I said yes.\n\nYou can read the full, restored report here.\n\nReading it now, I’m struck by how little I understood North Korea at the time. I had the conventional Western view but no grasp on how much human complexity can exist within a “closed” system.\n\nIt’s not hyperbole to say that this trip changed my life. I left with an enduring fascination for North Korea, and an unexpected protective reflex when I hear the word “brainwashed.” The surreal nature of an official propaganda tour (sparkling metro stations are a favored stop, as Tucker Carlson can attest) and the psychic pressure of constant monitoring stay with you.\n\nThis trip also begat Rest of World, in a way. It fed the same hunger that fueled my 20s: wanting to reconcile how digital technology could thrive in countries where, according to the prevailing belief at the time, it should be challenging (if not upending) illiberal structures. In January 2013, smartphone adoption was on a global tear, and tech optimism had not yet curdled into something less uplifting. Young, Swiss-educated Kim Jong Un was newly in power, his mysteriousness nurturing a fragile hope that he might be a reformer. But by December of that year, he had his uncle publicly executed — either by an anti-aircraft gun or a pack of ravenous dogs (experts disagree). The window of possibility shut, but the tech march of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continued.\n\nThere’s no better way to honor this old trip report — which put me on a path to build the very website you can now read it on — than to talk to North Korea experts about what I missed.\n\nIt’s unconventional (not unpredictable) with strategic absurdity.\n\nOne of the biggest myths about the DPRK, according to Sung-Yoon Lee, a prominent North Korea scholar and a current fellow at the Wilson Center, is that the regime is unknowable. “I’ve observed recurring patterns going back to the Korean War,” he told me. The most important being how the U.S. and South Korean governments consistently underestimate the grand strategy behind North Korea’s volatile moods. “Not only are they very good at shooting missiles,” Lee explained, “they also excel at post-provocation fake charm offensives.” Over time, it becomes clear that the pendulum swings between bombastic nuke-the-White-House threats and polite retreats after extracting concessions.\n\nWhat is new is the public debut of the Supreme Leader’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong. The subject of Lee’s excellent new book The Sister, she was revealed to the world with the same gauzy, who-is-she obfuscatory swirl that accompanies any news from the Kim dynasty. Trained in the same imperial school as her brother, but smarter — “She’s the brains behind the family operation,” Lee said — she ran the propaganda department for years before rising to even higher duties. Lee considers her the most dangerous woman in the world.\n\nI asked him why North Korea, a legitimately scary authoritarian state, was — unlike other scary authoritarian states — still a punchline to much of the world. It’s intentional, according to Lee. “They’ve weaponized their weirdness,” he said. The silly origin myths, the over-the-top insults lobbed at world leaders, the parades and 30-minute standing ovations. The weirdness keeps other governments off balance, forcing them to react to the regime’s mercurial demands.\n\nAccess to (their own) technology has exploded.\n\nWhen I visited Pyongyang, the officials were eager to show off their homemade smartphones and tablets: crudely built, with barely a connection to the country’s official intranet, called Kwangmyong (“bright star”). Since then, there’s been a significant digitalization leap under Kim Jong Un, according to Jieun Baek, author of two books on North Korea and connectivity.\n\nBaek spends much of her time interviewing defectors and examining the contemporary devices they smuggle out. It’s clear North Korean consumer technology has improved since 2013 — with a few caveats. Nobody can access the real internet yet, but certain groups and institutions have permission to use Kwangmyong. Like high school students, who now complete and submit their exams via intranet. Smartphone functionality is limited compared to my iPhone X, but there’s a thriving app market for games, e-books, and even dupes of popular Chinese beauty apps. You just have to go to a physical app store to download them.\n\nNorth Korea was a fairly early adopter of some technology, as 38 North’s Martyn Williams and Natalia Slavney outline in their chronicle of the country’s 20-year tech journey. Mobile phones were first available in 2002, a year before I got my first phone as a Silicon Valley high schooler. But the cellular network was switched off after a 2004 rail explosion, which was believed to be detonated by a cell phone. There was also an ill-fated mobile money experiment: Given access to top-up minutes for their mobile phones, North Koreans swiftly converted them into a multipurpose backup currency. (You may recognize this as a usage that emerged in parallel among users in mobile money-pioneer countries like Kenya, too.) That is, until the regime noticed and shut it down.\n\n“Is Bluetooth available?” goes a joke between North Korea tech watchers. Answer: “Depends on the month.” Nat Kretchun, who researches North Korea information controls at Open Technology Fund, said the government turns off Bluetooth access every time people find a creative way to use it.\n\nPyongyang today is a highly connected environment: lots of solar panels, LED TVs, video conferencing. Everyone has state-built smartphones and laptops — which run on Android — as well as (once-banned, now-legal) storage devices like USB sticks and hard drives. Outside the capital, access drops precipitously. But Baek, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, reminded me: “The elite’s access to digital technology comes with a commensurate increase in surveillance and control.”\n\nNorth Korea is not a monolith (even if it pretends to be).\n\nTo the outside world, North Korea projects an image of absolute control over its population. After all, the population lives under constant ideological education — including a Pyongyang TV channel that names and shames individual residents for treasonous violations — and with extremely high penalties, like a minor infraction sending three generations of a family to a prison camp. Who wouldn’t fall in line?\n\nBut Geoffrey K. See, a Singaporean entrepreneur whose organization Choson Exchange has run educational programs inside North Korea since 2009, has had a different experience. “There’s a lot of opportunism within the structures of power, so you have to figure out the avenues to navigate,” he told me. Getting permission to run their trainings means finding the right gatekeeper. “There’s not just one personality,” See said.\n\nIt’s a highly entrepreneurial culture.\n\nDespite the control — or because of it — many North Koreans are natural entrepreneurs. They have to be. “People are forced to find a way to make a living, and that involves day jobs and side hustles,” See said. Even if it’s risky. Kretchun agreed: “They all figure out where the line is, then they poke the line.” What I couldn’t see on my propaganda tour was a busy autonomous economy that exists within the state but is not run by it. Beneath that, a gray economy of informal and illegal activities hums along. Baek told me the story of a recent government defector – an engineer so talented he was sent to international programming competitions as a teenager. He supplemented his state job income with a side hustle: wiping the laptops of other officials to ensure no technical crumbs remained of their prohibited communications and contraband movies.\n\nEntrepreneurship may also present an avenue towards systemic change. “Look at Vietnam,” said See, as an example of gradual economic opening. “Not long ago, it didn’t look that different from North Korea. Today, Vietnam is a very different place. People can do things their forefathers couldn’t imagine doing under the 1980s’ Communist regime.” Building a shared economic vocabulary, he said, empowers North Koreans with the language they can use to connect to the outside world.\n\nIt’s not as closed as you’d think.\n\nI first met See in the summer of 2013, when he invited me to give a talk on the internet to North Korean businesswomen visiting Singapore. I was shocked that any North Koreans would be allowed to take trips abroad, let alone listen to an American talk about the real internet. What I found was a group of mostly young women, sharp and focused but also prone to bouts of performative crying. To date, thousands of students, business owners, professors, and officials have participated in Choson Exchange programs — both in and outside of North Korea — in modules focused on economic policy, technology, and entrepreneurship.\n\nHow do you teach entrepreneurship to a community that can’t access outside information, or outside markets? “We try to convey things that are practical and implementable: the next steps,” See said. “It’s saying, ‘This is the potential. This is where you can be down the road.’” His team is allowed to use examples from the outside world to demonstrate how businesses grow, and gently dispels any protestations that North Koreans do have the internet by showing them the real one. The participants are always curious and engaged.\n\nBut not being entirely closed goes both ways. For years, North Korea has shipped its citizens abroad to work and generate hard foreign currency, circumventing sanctions to fund its nuclear program. I had dinner once in an official North Korean restaurant in Myanmar, staffed by acrobatic female waitresses who, I learned later, were locked in a nearby compound when not serving bowls of chilled raengmyon. Journalist Ian Urbina’s recent exposé for The New Yorker lays bare the massive network of forced labor by North Korean workers overseas. You’ll never be able to pick up a McDonald’s Filet-o-Fish or seafood from your local supermarket without wondering if it was prepared by diminutive North Korean women forced to toil in Chinese factories under duress.\n\nDon’t shut the door on hope.\n\nKim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong are around my age (36), based on the best estimates. That means a potentially long time — several decades — in power. It can be difficult to feel much optimism when thinking about North Korea’s future: a control system that only gets stronger, a growing nuclear stockpile, and a brother-sister ruling pair who show no desire to stray from the antagonistic path set up by their father and grandfather. Even deeper diplomatic isolation is a top concern among policy experts, given recent actions like North Korea supplying Russia with millions of munitions for its war of aggression in Ukraine.\n\nIf hope is to be found, it’s at the individual level. Access to information technology — even if extremely constrained — is probably a slim net positive, experts told me. Kretchun of the Open Technology Fund said his favorite question to ask defectors is how many contacts they had on their phones. Most had 50 or 100, even 200, spread out across multiple provinces — which is notable given how restricted physical travel is within the country. “That’s a pretty aggressive reconfiguration of what’s possible,” he said, describing the government’s longtime policy of structuring people into strict vertical networks. You report to your work unit, which reports to your local party, then on to the regional party, and up the chain it goes. Mobile phones made horizontal social networks possible, enabling a level of business and gray market activity that was unthinkable before. What’s even more impressive is these networks depend on trust between strangers: no small thing in a country where children are trained to report their parents to the authorities for ideological missteps.\n\nAfter my lecture in Singapore, I spent a humid afternoon with the North Korean exchange participants. A few of the women had developed colds since arriving in Singapore, having never experienced air conditioning. We wandered in a mall together, and I desperately tried to bond. Towards the end of the day, one girl approached me to ask if it was really true we ate bread every day. I said not every day, but sure — often. She looked confused. “And,” she continued slowly, “it fills you up?”\n\nMaking sense of North Korea is hard. In an age where the prime struggle is too much information — infinite content creation, misinformation, a news cycle that never stops — North Korea stands apart. What we do know about the country comes almost entirely secondhand, through the stories of defectors and the hard work of professional North Korean watchers. But it’s only ever a composite guess, an incomplete portrait of a nuclear state with about 25 million civilian hostages. Still, the people inside are not the mindless drones that Western culture imagines them to be. Agency, however slight, exists and should be recognized.\n\nThere is one enduring truth, Baek told me: North Koreans are experts in survival. They have a saying, she said, that captures the population’s well-honed self-preservation skills. Here, when assessing danger, I might say I look over my shoulder. For North Koreans? “We have three shoulders.”"
