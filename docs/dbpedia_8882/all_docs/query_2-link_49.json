        "text": "No. Only 24 countries have embassies in Pyongyang. As of 2021, many of these embassies were vacant, as foreign diplomats left the country and were unable to be replaced due to Pyongyang's stringent border controls imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMany of the countries that have diplomatic relations with the DPRK base diplomatic staff handling North Korea at their embassies in Beijing or Seoul, but the North Korean government has not always permitted non-resident ambassadors to present their credentials in Pyongyang. Additionally, some countries have established policies limiting diplomatic contact with North Korea -- Canada, for example, has implemented a \"Controlled Engagement Policy\" toward North Korea since 2010, strictly limiting government-to-government cooperation and communication.\n\nSeveral countries have formally suspended or severed diplomatic relations with North Korea. During the 1970s, several countries severed relations with the DPRK when their governments switched Cold War alignments. In 1980, Iraq broke off relations with the DPRK due to North Korea's arms sales to Iran, and Myanmar \"de-recognized\" the DPRK in 1983 following the attempted assassination of South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan in Rangoon. (DPRK-Myanmar relations were re-established in 2007.) Following the publication of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry Report on Human Rights in North Korea in 2014, Botswana terminated its diplomatic relations with the DPRK.\n\nIn 2017, Portugal and the United Arab Emirates both broke diplomatic ties with North Korea, following North Korean ICBM and thermonuclear tests. Jordan broke diplomatic ties with North Korea in early 2018. These breaks in relations also came amidst a U.S. diplomatic campaign encouraging countries to reduce their economic and diplomatic relations with North Korea, and after Mexico, Peru, Kuwait, Spain, and Italy expelled resident DPRK ambassadors and downgraded diplomatic relations.\n\nIn 2021, North Korea severed diplomatic ties with Malaysia, citing the extradition of a DPRK national to the U.S. on charges related to money laundering and sanctions evasion. The break in relations came four years after the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, in Kuala Lumpur International Airport."
