        "text": "won, monetary units of South Korea and North Korea. The Bank of Korea has the exclusive authority to issue banknotes and coins for South Korea. Banknotes are issued in denominations ranging from 1,000 to 50,000 won. The notes are adorned on the obverse with early Yi (Chosŏn) dynasty figures, including writers Yi Hwang (1,000-won note) and Yi I (5,000-won note) and King Sejong (10,000-won note), who reigned from 1419 to 1450. Coins range in value from 1 to 500 won. The new won was adopted in 1962, when the old won was replaced at a rate of 100 to 1.\n\nThe Central Bank of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) was established in 1946 and has exclusive authority for issuing and regulating banknotes and currency in the country. The North Korean won, known as the people’s won until 1959, is divided into 100 chŏn. The local North Korean won is not convertible to foreign currencies and is strictly controlled by the government (a special convertible won has been introduced for use by foreigners). In late 2009 the North Korean government revalued the won to 1 percent of its value."
