        "text": "Safety and security\n\nSafety information\n\nCanadian (and Swedish) authorities may encounter major difficulties and delays in obtaining consular access to you if you are detained, particularly outside of Pyongyang. The provision of consular access is solely at the discretion of the North Korean government. Knowledge of North Korean police and judicial systems is limited, which may further affect our ability to provide assistance to you.\n\nTourist facilities are minimal and telecommunications are unreliable. Individual tourism can be arranged only through a handful of North Korean government-approved travel agencies. Travel must be authorized in advance by the government. Travellers are closely observed, and their accommodations and telecommunications are monitored.\n\nThere are serious shortages of food, electricity and clean water.\n\nYou have no right to privacy. Your movements and communications may be under surveillance at any time. Your personal belongings may be searched, and authorities may review the contents stored on your electronic devices.\n\nRegister with the Embassy of Canada to South Korea in Seoul and with the Embassy of Sweden in Pyongyang.\n\nTensions on the Korean Peninsula\n\nTensions on the Korean Peninsula can escalate with little notice. They may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests, military exercises and incidents such as inter-Korean border skirmishes or other incidents that one or the other side finds offensive. Due to very limited access to international media broadcasts in North Korea, you may be taken by surprise by events that could affect your security.\n\nCrime\n\nThe crime rate is low. Petty crime occurs, especially at the Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.\n\nRoad safety\n\nTravel within North Korea is severely restricted. Transportation is usually provided by local tour representatives or authorities. Major highways are in good condition, while rural roads can be hazardous. Police checkpoints, usually located at the entry to towns, may require that travellers provide documentation before onward travel is permitted.\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nEntry and exit requirements\n\nEvery country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination’s entry or exit requirements.\n\nWe have obtained the information on this page from the North Korean authorities. It can, however, change at any time.\n\nVerify this information with the Foreign Representatives in Canada.\n\nPassport\n\nEntry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel.\n\nBefore you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country’s entry rules.\n\nRegular Canadian passport\n\nYour passport must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date you expect to leave North Korea.\n\nPassport for official travel\n\nDifferent entry rules may apply.\n\nOfficial travel\n\nPassport with “X” gender identifier\n\nWhile the Government of Canada issues passports with an “X” gender identifier, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. You might face entry restrictions in countries that do not recognize the “X” gender identifier. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.\n\nOther travel documents\n\nDifferent entry rules may apply when travelling with a temporary passport or an emergency travel document. Before you leave, check with the closest foreign representative for your destination.\n\nUseful links\n\nForeign Representatives in Canada\n\nCanadian passports\n\nVisas\n\nCanadians must have a visa to enter North Korea. You can obtain a visa from a North Korean mission in a third country after approval from the government in Pyongyang. The process for obtaining visas can be extremely slow and arduous.\n\nCanadians arriving without a valid Canadian passport and visa may be detained, arrested, fined or denied entry.\n\nProfessional journalists must apply for special permission to visit North Korea and may not enter the country on a tourist visa, even if they are travelling for personal reasons.\n\nTourist visa: required\n\nBusiness visa: required\n\nStudent visa: required\n\nOther entry information\n\nForeigners can enter North Korea either by air or by train. It is not possible to enter North Korea from South Korea or to enter South Korea from North Korea.\n\nEven if you meet all entry requirements, you may be arbitrarily arrested and/or detained at your point of entry.\n\nDual citizenship\n\nIf you are a Korean citizen or have family ties with North Korea, you should carefully consider your decision to visit. Authorities periodically subject dual citizens and children of former Koreans to certain laws and obligations.\n\nCanadians who also have South Korean citizenship must obtain approval from South Korean authorities for travel to North Korea. For more information, contact the Embassy of Canada to the Republic of Korea in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nUnauthorized points of entry\n\nForeigners have been detained, and in one instance shot, for entering the country at unauthorized points. Ensure that you stay within permitted zones and strictly follow North Korea’s procedures and protocols.\n\nChildren and travel\n\nLearn more about travelling with children.\n\nYellow fever\n\nLearn about potential entry requirements related to yellow fever (vaccines section).\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centre\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nJapanese encephalitis\n\nJapanese encephalitis is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain. It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling.\n\nTravellers are at higher risk if they will be:\n\ntravelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days)\n\nmaking multiple trips to endemic areas\n\nstaying for extended periods in rural areas\n\nvisiting an area suffering a JE outbreak\n\nengaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists)\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nLimited malaria transmission may occur in this destination, but risk to travellers is very low.\n\nAntimalarial medication is not recommended for most travellers. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\nCover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\nExclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\nUse insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\nWear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country, risk of dengue is sporadic. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nThe level of medical services and facilities is poor. Hospitals often lack heat and medicine, and suffer from frequent power outages. Immediate payment in cash is expected for treatment. Pyongyang Friendship Hospital, in the Munsu-dong district of Pyongyang, is staffed by English-speaking professionals. If possible, avoid undergoing surgery. Medical evacuations are very difficult to arrange and are not guaranteed. You should take this into account prior to travel if you have an unstable medical condition. If you show symptoms of a serious communicable disease, you may be subject to strict quarantine conditions.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nNorth Korea is under international and Canadian sanctions. These sanctions could be relevant to and affect your travel.\n\nLaws\n\nForeigners must register through their host organization within 24 hours of arrival in the country.\n\nYou must be accompanied by an official guide at all times. Follow all instructions from your guide. Unauthorized conversations with locals or currency exchange, as well as making a purchase in a store not designated for foreigners, could lead to fines or arrest.\n\nForeigners are prohibited from using public buses or the subway.\n\nPenalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are strict. Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and travel\n\nImport and exports\n\nImportation of satellite telephones and shortwave radios is prohibited. Such items are confiscated upon entry and usually returned upon departure.\n\nThe import and export of local currency is prohibited.\n\nAuthorities may seize any material that they deem to be pornographic, political or intended for religious proselytizing. If you plan to bring material written in the Korean language, ensure that it will not be interpreted by local authorities as being against the interests of the North Korean regime.\n\nInvolvement in politics and unsanctioned religious activity can result in detention.\n\nPhotography of airports, roads, bridges, seaports and rail stations is prohibited. Any pictures or video taken outside of tourist areas could result in confiscation of equipment or detention. Seek permission from your tour guide before taking photographs.\n\nDual citizenship\n\nDual citizenship is not legally recognized in North Korea.\n\nIf local authorities consider you a citizen of North Korea, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.\n\nDual citizens\n\nInternational Child Abduction\n\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and North Korea.\n\nIf your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in North Korea by an abducting parent:\n\nact as quickly as you can\n\nconsult a lawyer in Canada and in North Korea to explore all the legal options for the return of your child\n\nreport the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre\n\nIf your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.\n\nBe aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.\n\nUseful links\n\nInternational Child Abductions: A guide for affected parents\n\nChildren and travel\n\nCanadian embassies and consulates by destination\n\nRequest emergency assistance\n\nCulture\n\nEnsure that you are not seen to be critical of the country’s political system or its current and former leaders Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-Sung and their family members.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons\n\nNorth Korean law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted in North Korean society.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons have experienced harassment and verbal abuse.\n\nTravel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency is North Korean won (KPW). Cash is the most accepted form of payment. Foreigners are expected to use the Euro or, alternatively, the Chinese renminbi or U.S. dollar. Change in foreign currency is often unavailable. Banking facilities are limited. There are no ATMs. Some hotels accept credit cards, if you give them advance notice."
