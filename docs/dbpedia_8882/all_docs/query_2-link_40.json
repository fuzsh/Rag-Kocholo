        "text": "In the 1990s, North Koreaâs socialist economy collapsed, triggering a devastating famine that took the lives of up to a million North Koreans and changed the relationship between the people and the regime forever. The regime could not provide enough food through its public distribution system so they prioritized resources to the ruling elites, leaving millions of ordinary North Koreans to fend for themselves.\n\nâ\n\nThe North Korean people had to get creative to survive so they took the economy into their own hands. They abandoned defunct work units, started foraging for food, and trading in new illegal markets called âJangmadangâ. These markets quickly became the main source of food for ordinary North Koreans and gradually grew to include more goods and services. This new market mindset and profit motive spread throughout North Korean society ushering in a new era of âmarketization from belowâ, fundamentally changing the relationship between the people and the regime.\n\nWATCH 3 North Koreans Talk\n\nAbout Starting Businesses\n\n\"We realized that if we didnât do anything, weâd starve to death. So we started trading.\"\n\nâ Joo Yang, escaped North Korea in 2010\n\nIn the past, every North Korean was assigned to a mandatory work unit and received rations from the government, but today more North Koreans have exited the state-socialist system to earn a living in the market economy. These acts are a form of âmass disobedienceâ or âeveryday resistanceâ.\n\nBy marketizing the economy, North Korean people have been able to increase their resilience to malnutrition and quality of life. Meanwhile their interests and needs have become increasingly opposed to the regimeâs economic policy, restrictions, and crackdowns.\n\nâ\n\nIn a micro-survey inside North Korea, 72% of respondents said almost all of their income now comes from market activity!\n\nThe Regimeâs Response\n\n\"Youâre not supposed to have private trade under socialist law. The State used to stop groups of people from gathering in groups to trade. They would go around and confiscate everything. But when everyone started trading, the state was powerless to stop it. So the markets got bigger and bigger.â\n\nâ Joo Yang, escaped North Korea in 2010\n\nâ\n\nPrivate markets have no place in official North Korean ideology. The regime depends on this ideology for its legitimacy, so they are concerned about the role of marketization in helping the people break away from the state both physically and psychologically. Kim Jong-il himself referred to the markets as âa birthplace of all sorts of non-socialist practices.â\n\nOver the past two decades, the regime has wavered between grudging tolerance and crackdowns. But the markets are here to stay. There are now over 400 markets officially sanctioned by the government and the regime leverages taxes and fees on merchants to generate revenue.\n\nâ\n\nThe regime has made serious missteps in their handling of the market economy that has further eroded the peopleâs trust in the state. In 2009, the regime issued a sudden currency re-evaluation to destroy private wealth and tighten control. Many North Koreans who had made money through market activities saw their savings vanish overnight.\n\n\"In 2009, there was a big currency re-evaluation.Â The government had changed the value of North Korean money in order to take back control.Â Everyone around me was panicking because suddenly all their savings had become nothing. I was lucky because most of my worth was in my products, not in cash.Â But I knew I couldnât live like this for long. Two years later I crossed the Yalu river into China and left North Korea forever.\"\n\nâ Jessie Kim escaped North Korea in 2011\n\nThere was so much outrage from the North Korean people about the re-evaluation that the government reportedly apologized and walked-back some of their restrictions. Nonetheless, this event was a watershed moment for many North Koreans who see the regime as an impediment toward them living better lives.\n\nThe regime invests tremendous resources into indoctrinating the North Korean people and making North Korea the most closed media environment in the world. But that hasnât stopped the people from consuming forbidden foreign media and outside information.\n\nâ\n\nAs the people started moving and trading within the country and across the border into China, the Jangmadang also became a place of exchange for new information and technologies. Increased access to this information is changing perceptions of the outside world and challenging the regimeâs propaganda, ultimately eroding the North Korean peopleâs loyalty to the regime.\n\n\"Everything portrayed in the South Korean dramas was so clean and everyone seemed so wealthy. I used to think âWow, there is such a world out there.âÂ We were taught that South Korea was a poor country but I wondered, why canât we live like that?â.\"\n\nâ Jihyun Kang, escaped North Korea in 2010\n\nHow Foreign Media Changed One Womanâs Life\n\nThe North Korean regime severely cracks down on foreign media consumption but the people continue to watch despite the risks. Through smuggled movies, television programs and even music, North Koreans are learning more about the reality of life in the outside world and the reasons for their own poverty, and they cannot unlearn these things. As this âeducation in realityâ continues, the North Korean people will be increasingly empowered to think independently from the regime. And when people think differently, they eventually act differently.\n\nâI knew Iâd be sentenced to hard labor if I watched foreign media, but I did it anyway. When I first saw the buildings, cars, and clothes on the screen I thought they were all set up just for the sake of the movie. Thatâs what they do on North Korean TV all the time: lie. But as I watched foreign movie after foreign movie, I thought to myself, âthat canât be fake. Thatâs got to be real.â\n\nâ Chae Hwan, escaped North Korea in 2017\n\nHow Foreign Media Changes Perceptions\n\nMarketization is accelerating the spread of both foreign content and the devices to consume them on such as mobile phones, televisions, tablets, laptops, radios, and DVD players. Today in North Korea, itâs possible to buy cheap Chinese DVD players for around $20. USB drives have grown in popularity in recent years, and are used with computers and DVD players that have a USB input port. These drives are small enough to hide and can contain hours of content, making it easier to share and consume media without being as easily detected by the secret police.\n\n4 North Koreans Talk About\n\nThe Spread of Foreign Media\n\n81% of North Koreans who had left the country reported having access to a USBs.\n\n98% of North Koreans who had a USB carried illegal media on it.\n\nFrom the report 'Compromising Connectivity' â these numbers do not necessarily reflect the entire country.\n\nOutside Information\n\nThe famine and grassroots marketization also triggered an unprecedented number of North Koreans to begin illegally traveling back and forth to China. This includes smugglers, traders, and even North Korean refugees who are caught and sent back. These people have had direct exposure to the outside world and share this information with their home communities, countering the regimeâs propaganda.\n\nâ\n\nCross-border trade and smuggling has also exposed North Koreans to foreign products that are far superior to domestically produced ones. The knowledge that foreign countries are creating these goods is a tangible sign that the quality of life outside the country might be better.\n\nâ\n\n83% of respondents said they found outside goods and information to be of greater impact on their lives than decisions by the North Korean government.\n\nâ\n\nAs the chasm between traditional propaganda and the peopleâs understanding of their reality continues to widen, and the bottom-up forces empowering the North Korean people continues to increase, the regime will be forced to:\n\nâ\n\n1. Adapt its propaganda to align more with reality.\n\n2. Allow a better standard of living in order to maintain power and control\n\nâ\n\nIf they fail, their propaganda will become increasingly irrelevant, or even counter-productive.\n\nKoreans who had a USB carried illegal media on it*\n\nIf marketization and outside information are the engines that are accelerating change in North Korea, corruption is the grease that helps them go faster. In North Korea, where the laws are designed to protect the regime, there are a lot of benefits for ordinary people when the rule of law breaks down. Corruption corrodes the regimeâs control and enables many of North Koreaâs other social changes.\n\nâBribery is effective in North Korea. One cannot lead a life in North Korea if he or she does not bribe his or her way.â â North Korean refugee, from the UN report The Price Is Rights\n\nâ\n\nMany economic activities in North Korea are still technically illegal. But regime officials rely on the markets and bribes for their livelihoods since their official pay is so meager. So these officials use their power and authority to extract bribes from people running businesses instead of arresting them and sentencing them for breaking the law.Â The threat of harsher punishments allows security officials to extract higher bribes, but this also makes it impossible for the regime to effectively crack down on private business.\n\nBribing officials in North Korea\n\nSince the regimeâs institutions are the only agencies with legal rights in North Korea, itâs inevitable that entrepreneurs will bribe regime officials to obtain their licenses which causes a breakdown in government authority. Driven by the profit-motive and enabled by corruption, a variety of businesses have emerged such as restaurants, karaoke bars, bathhouses and even private coal mines, all taking advantage of the new business environment.\n\nNorth Koreans who are now in their 20s and early 30s grew up after the collapse of the state-socialist economy and that is the only North Korea they know. These North Korean millennials are the Jangmadang Generation and their attitudes, values, and behaviors are significantly different from their parentsâ and grandparentsâ.\n\nLearn More About North\n\nKoreaâs Change Generation\n\nâOur parentsâ generation was given everything by the government. But not our generation â we had to find our own food and make our own money. Our generation had to learn how to do everything for ourselves.\"\n\nââ Min Sung, escaped North Korea in 2010\n\nThe Jangmadang Generation grew up in an era where people had to fend for themselves. Many of them never relied on the state for work, food, wealth, status, protection, or information. Traditional ideology seems hollow and irrelevant to them, and they are more influenced by foreign media.\n\nâ\n\nItâs no surprise then that many of these young North Koreans show more interest in foreign films, fashions, and music, and feel little attachment to the regime or the leadership, seeing regime officials as takers rather than providers and as the source of problems inside the country. They have less respect for the regime compared to previous generations, and this demographic is only going to grow with time. They will be crucial in pushing for change in the future.\n\nour latest documentary\n\nThe Jangmadang Generation: All the incredible changes this generation is driving\n\nAuthoritarian regimes like North Korea often ensure their power by preventing the people from forming bonds with each other outside of the stateâs control. They remove societal mechanisms that might produce a challenge to their authority and utilize a society-wide system of informants to keep peopleâs everyday behavior in check, which generates a sense of mistrust and fear between the people.\n\nHowever, North Koreans are increasingly engaging in shared illegal activities such as illicit business or gathering with small groups of friends to watch foreign films. They are more reliant on each other for goods and information that the regime is either unwilling or unable to provide. Shared participation in illegal activities such as trading banned products or discussion of âsubversiveâ information leads to mutual dependence, trust-building, and the normalization of such disobedience within communities. This encourages further sharing, private discussion, and the strengthening of bonds between the people. Ultimately this could result in a growing civil space for the people, separate from the regime.\n\nâWe would call all our closest friends, people you could really trust, and get them together to watch foreign media. If you watched it together then no one would report it because theyâd go down for it too.\"\n\nââ Shimon Huh, escaped North Korea in 2013\n\nThe regimeâs repressive security apparatus is still too effective to allow any public challenge to the ruling elite. People may be more open with sharing their views, but they are still very cautious, and anything more than very private criticism of the regime within a trusted group of friends or relatives is still too risky.\n\nâ\n\nGrassroots marketization and the spread of outside information may be contributing to the emergence of a growing space for people who are breaking off from the state not just at an individual level but increasingly at a community level. This may enable people to push back against the regime collectively, on small and localized issues at first. There is evidence that this is already happening!"
