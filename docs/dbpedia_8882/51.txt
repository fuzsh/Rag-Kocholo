North Korean Currency

The North Korean Won is issued in Pyongyang by the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

North Korean currency uses banknotes (and also coins rarely in circulation).

The images on these banknotes illustrate areas, people, political ideologies, and landmarks of national importance.

Each banknote is market with the North Korean Coat of Arms. This is positioned in the top left-hand corner.

The North Korean Coat of Arms is made up of a 5-pointed red star shining over Mt. Paektu and a hydroelectric dam.

The red star is widely used to symbolise socialism, whilst Mt. Paketu is Korea’s most sacred mountain. The hydroelectric dam represents self-sustainability and prosperity.

In the red ribbon featured on the emblem are the words ‘Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’, the official name for North Korea (or DPRK for short).

North Korean Currency History

1947

The North Korean Won became the official currency of North Korea on December 6, 1947.

This replaced the Korean Yen that was in circulation at the time.

Initially, North Korean was only intended for exclusive use by North Koreans. Any foreigner to visit the country has issued a separate currency. But this was also then further divided depending on which country you were coming from as a foreigner - one for those from socialist countries, and one for those from capitalist countries.

The currency used by those from socialist countries were red, and those from capitalist countries were blue/green.

2001

Since the establishment of North Korean won, the North Korean government pegged the value at 2.16 won to the dollar.

This number is significant as it is the date of second leader Kim Jong Il’s birthday (16th February).

In 2001, this pegged value was removed.

2002

The use of separate foreign currencies by foreigners was officially abolished, and instead, foreigners were able to pay in hard foreign currency.

2009

The North Korean won was revalued in November 2009. This is the first time that a revaluation had taken place, and it proved a difficult time for Koreans.

North Koreans were told that they had seven days in which to exchange a maximum of ₩100,000 (approx. US$40), which was then raised to ₩150,000 in hard cash and ₩300,000 in bank savings.

On November 30th, old notes ceased to be legal tender. The new North Korean won notes didn’t start circulation until December 7th.

The current series of banknotes first circulated in 2009 when North Korea underwent a currency reform.

2014

New edition of the 5000 North Korean Won note came into circulation with a new image (see below). As of 2020, both old edition and new edition remain in circulation.
