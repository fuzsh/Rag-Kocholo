        "text": "IVORY Coast club Asec Mimosas took full advantage of being able to play at home again as they thumped Primeiro Agosto of Angola 4-0 at the weekend in the African Confederation Cup.\n\nMangoua Kesse broke the Abidjan deadlock on 34 minutes and second-half goals from Irenee N'Doua, Adama Bakayoko and Nigerian Olarenwaju Kayode completed an unexpectedly comfortable fourth round, first leg victory.\n\nRegular African football campaigners Primeiro had come to the Ivorian commercial capital with a reputation embellished by a victory over title holders FUS Rabat of Morocco in the previous round.\n\nPortuguese coach Carlos Manuel boasted after that triumph that his team were capable of winning the second-tier African competition, but it is difficult to imagine Asec surrendering a commanding lead.\n\nPost-presidential election violence in Ivory Coast forced Asec to play Motor Action of Zimbabwe and Raja Casablanca of Morocco away in single-leg African Champions League ties.\n\nBoth matches went to a penalty shootout with the youthful team coached by Frenchman Sebastien Desabre winning in Harare and losing in Casablanca - a defeat that meant demotion to the Confederation Cup.\n\nAngolan football followers still had cause for celebration as InterClube took a 3-0 lead over Difaa al-Jadida of Morocco in Luanda with Dias Caires and Moco grabbing late goals after Minguito scored on the stroke of half-time.\n\nMoghreb Fes of Morocco also lost in Southern Africa, but a 1-0 defeat by Zesco United of Zambia in Ndola keeps alive hopes of qualifying for the eight-club group phase.\n\nDerrick Kabwe scored the winner 16 minutes into the second half for Zesco, who lacked injured leading scorer Alfred Luputa, one of just four footballers to score a hat-trick in a Pan-African club competition this year.\n\nThe giant-killing run of Kenyan outfit Sokapaka appears over after a 3-0 defeat in Tunisia by Club Africain, with Khaled Melliti netting a brace. Algerian challengers had mixed fortunes with Entente Setif taking a narrow 1-0 home lead over Kaduna United of Nigeria while a JS Kabylie side depleted by injuries and suspensions left Senegal happy after holding Diaraf 1-1 in Dakar.\n\nReturn matches are scheduled for the weekend of June 10-12."
