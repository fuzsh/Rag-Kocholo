The magazine was later discontinued and substituted by a website.[1][4]\n\nThe organization was originally financed by Iraqi Ba’athists.[5] which enable it to produce relatively high-quality propaganda materials. For example, it issued audio cassettes which were smuggled into Libya alongside Sawt at-Talia during the 1980s.[6] The organization also ran radio broadcasts over Radio Baghdad.[6]\n\nIn January 1987 the “Libyan National Movement” and seven other opposition groups (such as the Libyan National Struggle Movement and the Libyan Liberation Organization) agreed to form a working group headed by Major Abd al Munim al Huni, a former RCC member who had been living in Cairo since the 1975 coup attempt.[7]\n\nIn July 2005 the Libyan National Movement took part in a foundation of the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition in London,\n\nwhich signed a joint ‘national accord’ calling for the removal of the Great Jamahiriya in totality and the establishment of a transitional government.They are opposed to anything coming from the mind of Muammar al-Qathafi.[8][9]\n\nBoth the “Green Book” and the “Charter” are found also in: “MY VISION” (edited by the Algerian EDMOND JOUVE)—also printed in many languages, published in 2005.\n\n_______________\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ a b من نحــن [About] (in Arabic), Libyan National Movement.\n\n^ a b Tachau, Frank.

NATO as an organization should have been disbanded after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact but they have done quite the opposite and have continued with a global expansion that has made NATO the single largest military power in the history of the world.\n\nNo matter that the cold war has long been over, and the West and NATO’s beloved reason for expansion, the “Evil Specter” of Communism in Europe, has been regulated to the pages of history, the U.S. and its NATO allies need phantoms and demons, rogues nations and terrorists, evil aggressors and vicious invaders to justify their own existence and even more so, to justify their own endless aggressive expansion and disguise the fact that such a global expansion is illegal and in fact a plan aimed at the domination of the world by one power.\n\nNATO, which originally was conceived as a military alliance of North Atlantic countries aimed against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), has continued its expansion unhindered since the end of the Cold War and now includes members, partners and participants of “special programs” on every continent of the planet except Antarctica.\n\nThe organization has used the pretext of terrorism to justify its expansion to many countries and has spread the fear of nuclear missile attacks from Iran and North Korea as a way to terrify countries into joining or supporting the organization or allowing them to, in effect, annex their military forces with promises of protection, training and invulnerability.\n\nNATO has continued to encircle the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China for over a decade with missiles and what are effectively, with the flick of a switch, first strike weapons and a “shield” which will neutralize any Russian or Chinese responsive attack and the have done so with impunity under the claim that Europe is under some sort of threat from Iranian missiles.\n\nPoland has been a key country in the expansion of NATO to the East and key, due to its location, in neutralizing any sort of Russian defensive of counter response, if it is attacked by the West. It is also the latest location where NATO is planning massive training exercises under the pretext of a supposed NATO article 5 defense of Poland under attack from a “phantom enemy” which could only be Russia.\n\nThe planned NATO exercises, with the unlikely name of “Steadfast Jazz 2013”, planned for November, include ex-Soviet Baltic Republics; Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as well as Poland, and envisage those countries being attacked by a “foreign power”. Some unidentified “phantom menace”, and are reminiscent of the Cold War according to the Deputy Defense Minister of the Russian Federation, Anatoly Antonov.\n\nAt a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council in Brussels, the Deputy Defense Minister stated the following: “As we prepared for this meeting, we carefully studied information received from NATO countries about Steadfast Jazz-2013, and I can’t hide the fact that the Russian Defense Ministry was bewildered by the proclaimed goal of this exercise, which envisages the application of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty triggering a response to an aggression against Poland. These drills are in the spirit of the Cold War.”\n\nThese words from official Moscow are unlikely to change NATO’s plans as have all previous protests against the alliance’s expansion and the surrounding of Russia with NATO “missile defense” elements, protests which have fallen on deaf ears. NATO has an agenda and they will stop at nothing to fulfill that agenda. The agenda is what you might call an “open secret” and is nothing less than achieving military domination over the entire planet and even the “space” above us.\n\nThe U.S. and western military industrial complex are not interested in peace, and while countries in Eastern Europe, former Soviet Republics and other countries across Europe, the Middles East, South America, North America, Scandinavia, Africa and Asia might be spending more on improving their own economies, advancing peace and trade relations with their neighbors and other states, and making life better for their own citizens and those of the world, NATO’s persistent expansion and the demands on member and partner country’s economies and resources diverts precious resources towards their own expansion and the supposed “defense” against “phantom menaces”.\n\nThis persistent stance of needing to defend against a “phantom menace” as a pretext towards their own aggressive domination of the world and their own commission of acts of aggression against peaceful countries which do not pose any real threat to the “alliance”, such as Yugoslavia, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China, only serves to destabilize the world and perpetuate an artificial state of endless war and danger.\n\nSure NATO has not attacked North Korea, Iran, Russia or China, yet, but their aggressive placement of missiles and military infrastructure around these countries and the continuous beating of the war drum by the alliance in no way promotes peace or understanding between nations and in fact has a complete and total destabilizing effect on the entire planet.\n\nTherefore in reality the single biggest threat to peace in today’s world is not from the bogeyman of terrorism, or from a nuclear Iran or North Korea but from the aggressive expansionist saber-rattling polices of the West, namely the United States of America and its NATO subordinates and their constant meddling in countries all over the globe in their endless attempt to dominate and bend the will of the world’s countries to their own agenda. Whether that be access to resources, economic enrichment or other “strategic” goals.\n\nThese types of exercises are the antithesis of advancing peaceful relations between nations. The real geopolitical situation which exists in the world, and in particular Europe, today sees no real scenario where Poland is being attacked by an aggressive power (Russia), but the exercises against the phantom menace (which appears to be Russia) serve NATO’s expansion and allows it to further annex and indebt the countries involved.\n\nThe fact that NATO members whose militaries are integrated into NATO in effect lose the sovereignty of their militaries is a matter few countries consider and is something that is rarely, if ever touched upon. Just how far countries allow NATO to integrate with their military structures is a question that members should be asking but are not. Blindly trusting the intentions of a military block who ultimate goal is complete and total world domination is a dangerous prospect and one which should set off warning bells but unfortunately the world has been duped into blindly trusting NATO.\n\nThe opinions and views expressed here are my own.

(20-25 L) of milk a day. A camel with well-formed udders may produce 8-10.6 gal. (30-40 L) a day. Camels can give milk even under harsh conditions and, unlike dairy cows, do not need much or any supplements to do so. A camel can produce 5.28 gal. (20 L) of milk a day without drinking any water for up to 10 days! Camel milk is chemically similar to cattle milk, but has a higher proportion of vitamin C. It also has more fat, protein, and minerals than either cow’s or goat’s milk… Camel milk is said to be an acquired taste….\n\nThe Muammar Gaddafi Story\n\n(Libyan leader spanning six decades)\n\nAs a young boy, Muammar tended the family’s goats and travelled by camel between grazing grounds and oases. Noticed by his father and other elders as having an exceptionally brilliant mind, Gaddafi was sent away to school – at much sacrifice to the family – and from there he began his lifelong passion for knowledge and his mission to liberate his people from foreign occupation.\n\nwatch Libya hero Gaddafi with Egpyt hero Nasser in 1969\n\n(Gaddafi’s model for Libya revolution was Nasser in Egypt)\n\nwatch Gaddafi in 1976: at work/at home documentary\n\n(took Libya from Middle Age poverty to modern prosperity)\n\nGaddafi’s revolutionary democracy: power to the people\n\n(wealth of Libya spread horizontally, not vertically)\n\nWatch Gaddafi interviewed up close & personal in library\n\n(explaining truth about self, Libya & world issues)\n\nGaddafi a patron saint to 31 sub-Saharan Africa countries\n\n(hotels/oil/exploration/mining/tourism/agriculture/infrastructure)\n\n53 African Union nations will miss Gaddafi’s generosity\n\n(financial/moral support to Africa unrelenting/wholehearted)\n\nJFK-LUMUMBA\n\nwatch Gaddafi tell UN investigate Lumumba/JFK assassination\n\n(“we want to know who killed JFK & Lumumba”)\n\nwatch video GADDAFI’S TRUE LIBYA read scrolling\n\n(from poorest to highest standard of living in world)\n\nwatch GADDAFI A LIBYAN HERO listen\n\n(soundtrack Eye of the Tiger – the will to survive)\n\nWhat I learned about Gaddafi & Libya is the truth\n\n(people wake up/get informed/watch video & be shocked)\n\n53 African Union nations will miss Gaddafi’s generosity\n\n(financial/moral support to Africa unrelenting/wholehearted)\n\n___________________________________________\n\n(I gave people houses/hospitals/schools/money/democracy…\n\nmade Libya into farmland from the desert):\n\nGADDAFI: RECOLLECTIONS OF MY LIFE\n\n(gave people houses/hospitals/schools/desert into farmland)\n\nGaddafi’s GREEN BOOK Islamic Socialism\n\n(gov’t by the people not by parliament/party/class…)\n\n(not capitalism or communism or corporatism)\n\nGADDAFI: RECOLLECTIONS OF MY LIFE\n\nOn 01 September 2009 – a year and a half before the UN declared illegal, unjustified war on Libya and commenced assassination attempts on Gaddafi (and three weeks before Gaddafi’s historic speech to the UN where, as Chairman of the African Union, he blasted the UN Security Council for approving 65 wars against small nations in the 65 years since the UN was founded in 1945) – Gaddafi hosted dignitaries at the spectacular 40th anniversary celebrations of the “people’s revolution”.\n\nClip: Gadaffi’s historic 2009 speech slamming UN\n\n(Security Council should be called “terror council”)\n\nwatch Gaddafi explains UN is illegal/undemocratic\n\n(65 wars in 65 years since UNITED NATIONS was created)\n\nwatch GADDAFI SPEECH TO UNITED NATIONS 2009\n\nGaddafi blasted big powers USA/China/Russia in UN speech\n\n(UN allowed 65 aggressive wars against small nations)\n\nGaddafi – “man of the people” – and his daughter Aisha arrived in a golf-cart for ceremonies held in a massive green tent.

I always advise him to look after his health and take things easy, but apart from that it is him who gives me advice. If I had to pick his single best piece of wisdom, it would be that he underlines being modest, not to be arrogant, and that we should shoulder our responsibilities…. The man is the man. He never changes. He is a man of principles, he believes in causes, defending the poor and underdog, he never changes the main ideas that he believes in. I would say that now the future of Libya is very promising, bright and optimistic. It is taking its rightful place in the international community and everyone is seeking good ties with us.\n\nYouTube/Telegraph, 07 Sept. 2011\n\nBROTHER GADDAFI AT HOME IN TENT\n\n& DAUGHTER DESCRIBES GRANDPA GADDAFI\n\nDAUGHTER DESCRIBES GRANDPA GADDAFI\n\n“I remember once we were on a holiday – my husband and I and the children.\n\nAnd I remember the little boys were crying, they don’t want to enjoy their vacation,\n\nthey want to go back to the tent of their grandfather.\n\nThey want to drink the camel’s milk *1- they are so much used to it.\n\nSo we did our best to appease them and divert their attention.\n\nBut they never listened to us so we had, really,\n\nto break our holiday and go back to their grandfather,\n\nwho is my father, of course.”\n\nwatch Aisha Gaddafi talks about her relationship with her father Muammar Gaddafi\n\nto Colin Freeman in Tripoli, Telegraph video, Oct 21, 2010\n\n“…Yes, I see him every day….I am very happy about this sort of relationship – the strong ties between my sons and my father.

But he has also made it a rule to himself to give as much time as possible to his family, to his sons, despite the fact that he is busy.

But now the grandchildren take the spotlight, they take most of the time. But this is a school, this is an education for us – so we like to be together and learn from this great man – who is my father, and I am proud of him of course….\n\n“It does happen many times – people do not know who I am and suddenly, maybe, they find out that I am Aisha, the daughter of the leader. And so they gasp sometimes, and then they get so much friendly and welcoming and they take the chance to send greetings to my father and mother….”\n\nMeet Gaddafi’s girl: daughter Aisha a chip off the old block\n\nby Colin Freeman, Telegraph, Oct 10, 2010\n\nTo anyone in Britain who still thinks of her Dad as a tyrant, IRA quartermaster extraordinaire, and all-round Mad Dog of the Middle East, Aisha Gaddafi would like to extend a cordial invite. “Come to Libya, you are all most welcome,” she says, when asked about her father’s unique talent for planting thorns in the side of successive British governments. “I know what is said in Britain about my father, and most of it is just following a political agenda. So I would give the British people this invite: find out the real facts by coming and meeting us Libyans in person.”\n\nFirst though, meet Aisha herself, the only girl among the eight children that Gaddafi has fathered in between his other duties as Brotherly Leader, self-appointed Saviour of Africa and Guide of the Revolution. Dubbed “The Claudia Schiffer of North Africa” in the Arab press for her striking good looks, the 33-year-old is arguably the most photogenic of Libya’s First Family, yet she is still very much a chip off the old block. A lawyer by training, her father’s regime is not the only contentious cause she has spoken up for over the years. In her youth, just like her Dad, she was a keen supporter of the IRA, and three years ago, she was on the legal team that defended that other controversial Arab leader, Saddam Hussein….\n\nShe agreed last week to a no-holds-barred interview at her home, a huge, high-walled villa in a Tripoli suburb. At first, it feels rather like being in a Gaddafi version of a Hello! shoot. Flawlessly turned out in peach jacket, white trousers and designer jewellery, Aisha holds court in a vast drawing room decked out with family pictures, and later poses for photos on a huge, mermaid-shaped settee worthy of her father’s extravagant tastes. Meanwhile, her three young children wander in – one of whom, three-year-old Muammar, is named after Grandpa. “People forget that as well as being a great leader, he is also my father,” she smiles, as the pint-sized Gaddafis scuttle about. “We are very close as a family, and while he is always very busy, every day I insist that we have a gathering with him. My boys love being in his tent, and they enjoy drinking his camel’s milk.”.*1…\n\nWith that, The Sunday Telegraph’s time Chez Gaddafi is up, although the hospitality is not quite finished yet. As we leave, a housekeeper bustles in with gifts: for my photographer and I, there are smart Gaddafi-style robes, and for my six-week-old daughter, there is a dummy in a special presentation box. It comes across as a genuinely thoughtful gesture, although as the large gates of her villa clang shut behind us, I wonder if I am falling for the same kind of charm tactics that so successfully wooed Mr Blair.\n\nColonel Gaddafi’s daughter Aisha gives rare insight into her family’s struggle\n\n(she fears that a bomb could take their life any day)\n\nvideo report by David Kilpatrick, New York Times, 26April 2011\n\nI received a phone call a few days ago from the office of Aisha al Gaddafi, the daughter of the libyan leader Colonel Muammar al Gaddafi and they said that she wanted to do an interview which, interestingly, I hadn’t requested. But I offered to fly back to Tripoli and they made that possible.\n\nWhen I got there I was surprised by her tone and I think she was offering a window into how the family was feeling right now. It was much more fatalistic. She talked as though it had already happened, sometimes – about how much the West would regret driving her father from power; about the dire consequences that she predicted when Col Gaddafi was gone, in terms of an exodus of illegal immigrants into Europe; a terrorist foothold on the Meditteranean; chaos in Libya and other dire consequences that she forecasted… Miss Gaddafi is trained as a lawyer at a Libyan university…. She finds alot of parallels between the case of Saddam Hussein and the Libyan example….She told me she thinks that what would happen in Libya would be far, far worse…\n\nShe said that she tells her children bedtime stories about the afterlife and she finds that especially appropriate right now because she fears that a bomb could take their life any day. Her five year old, she said, is so afraid of the bombs that he is now suffering from incontinence.\n\nThat night, in fact, the UN/NATO airstrikes actually hit the Gaddafi compound for the third time in their most serious bombing of that facility. We were brought there shortly after the bombs had fallen. One of the buildings had a tangle of wires and antennae coming out of it so it may have been a communications and command control facility, a military facility. Other parts of the complex were inarguably non-military. One was a building used primarily for for meeting foreign dignitaries; another was just offices. Gaddafi’s official translator told me that his office was destroyed that night of the bombing and he was glad he wasn’t working late that night.\n\nwatch Home movies of Gaddafi in tent with grandchildren\n\n(UN-rebels plunder family homes destroyed by UN bombs)\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nBERNARD-HENRI LEVY:\n\nFrench Jewish writer met terrorist rebels in Libya\n\n(delivered message to Israel premier in Jerusalem)\n\nCIA/MI6/MOSSAD agents lead anti-Gaddafi ‘rebellion’\n\n(agents on ground in Libya training/arming ‘rebels’)\n\nUN warplanes blast Tripoli in heaviest bombing yet\n\n(3 dead/150 wounded near Gaddafi compound)\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nBROTHER GADDAFI AT HOME IN TENT Throughout the four decades in which he has given his Vision to Libya,\n\nMuammar Gaddafi has made sure to bring his Bedouin tent with him everywhere in the world.\n\nThe mobile “flying tent” is a replica of the original one set next to the ruins of Bab al-Azizia,\n\nGaddafi’s headquarters in the south of the capital Tripoli\n\nwhich was bombed by the U.S. in 1986.\n\nBefore the BIG BROTHER UNITED NATIONS barbaric war on Libya began three months ago now – first bomb dropped on Benghazi on 19 March 2011 – I didn’t know much about Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, other than what I’d heard over the years – his picture often plastered on headlines screaming “MAD DOG FROM THE EAST” over hideously distorted images of him.\n\nGaddafi son says UN lied saying Libya killed civilians\n\n(same as they lied saying Iraq had WMDs)\n\n(Libya under attack by biggest military force in history)\n\nWatch Gaddafi TV footage/spokesman Ibrahim press conference\n\n(it’s not Obama or UN who decides who leads Libya)\n\nBut when the bombing of Libya started I reflected back on having flown over Benghazi four and a half years ago and taking pictures from the window of the airplane.\n\nBecause of those photos – and the very name “Benghazi” sounds like something out of the Arabian Nights – I felt an irresistable draw to learn more about Libya and Gaddafi. I knew, instinctively and intellectually, that if BIG BROTHER said Gaddafi was bad, then Gaddafi must be good.\n\nIn the ensuing months of BIG BROTHER’S diabolical war on Libya – involving the country where I live, Canada (which is openly being taken-over by Communist China) dropping millions of dollars worth of bombs on Libya (paid for with money borrowed from foreign banks) – I’ve learned a great deal about Gaddafi and I was right – he IS good, and that’s WHY they’re trying to kill him – just like they killed JFK.\n\n(totally opposed to communism & Islamic fundamentalism)\n\n(truthful history of Libyan resistance to colonialism)\n\nWatch Gaddafi warns UN stop bombing homes/offices/families\n\n(radio speech to thousands at pro-Gaddafi rally)\n\nWatch Gaddafi son Saif: Libya like McDonalds for UN-NATO\n\n(fast war as fast food; snakes hungry for Libya gas-oil-cash)\n\nGaddafi daughter Aisha: UN spilling of Libyan blood must end\n\n(father strong; will never leave Libya; a symbol, a guide)\n\nJul 4-23, 2011\n\nWatch: Saif: “To tell my father to leave the country is a joke”\n\n(agrees to concessions but UN constantly refuses cease-fire)\n\nThe evil UN war against Gaddafi – a civilian holding no political office in Libya since 1977 but nationally honoured as “Brother Leader of the 1969 Revolution” and founding father of the democratic-socialist conception of the Third Universal Theory as enshrined in “The Green Book” – began officially on February 17, 2011 with all-encompassing trade-embargo sanctions – including a NO-FLY ZONE – imposed against Libya based on totally-false UN accusations that Gaddafi was “killing his own people” for allegedly “protesting in the streets against him”. Canada, following orders from BIG BROTHER UN, pulled workers from Libya and stopped shipment of equipment worth millions of dollars toward the building of the 8th Wonder of the World – Gaddafi’s GREAT MAN-MADE RIVER project – which we’re now helping bomb under UN-NATO’s banner OPERATION UNIFIED PROTECTOR.\n\nUN-NATO LIBYA MISSION: OPERATION UNIFIED PROTECTOR( “bombing civilians protects civilians” )\n\nUN bombs hit hotel/apartment/bus/university/medical factory\n\n(another night of NATO murder/terror/horror killing civilians)\n\n( “bombing civilians protects civilians” )\n\nUN bombs hit hotel/apartment/bus/university/medical factory\n\n(another night of NATO murder/terror/horror killing civilians)\n\nUN war on Libya: “Operation Unified Protector”\n\n(killing civilians & destroying infrastructure)\n\nThe Orwellian ‘mission’ of OPERATION UNIFIED PROTECTOR – according to UN Resolution #1973 – is “to protect Libyan civilians by bombing Libya to prevent civilians from being killed by Gaddafi” (note: “prevent” means it hasnt yet happened and in fact it never has happened, and “protect” – to UN – means “kill” because that’s what bombs do – they kill). The bombing, as mentioned previously, began on 19 March 2011 as “support” to Jewish-backed non-Libyan agent-provocateur-Islamic-extremist terrorists (what UN refers to as “anti-Gaddafi, pro-democracy ‘rebels'”) who were rioting in the streets and attacking government military ammunition buildings and were consequently being put down by the Libyan government’s security forces – just as they’d likewise be put down in London, or New York, or any other nation on the planet. In Libya, the protestors aren’t disenfranchised poverty-stricken people. In Libya the people aren’t disenfranchised – they run the government through “people’s congresses” – and they aren’t poor – they’ve got the highest standard of living on the continent – as determined by the UN itself in recent reports.\n\nSeveral times during OPERATION UNIFIED PROTECTOR‘s ongoing bombing campaign on Libya, Gaddafi has called for a cease-fire so that civilized talks and negotiations can take place. He’s hosted world leaders – including the Secretary General of the UN – in his tent in Tripoli.\n\nThe African Union sent a so-called ‘peacekeeping’ mission to meet Gaddafi on April 10, 2011 and Gaddafi agreed to their proposal for a cease-fire. But the UN – as usual – refused to stop their one-sided bombing.\n\nLast week the international media – the Orwellian Ministry of Truth (Lies) – was matter-of-factly reporting that BIG BROTHER bombs had obliterated the buildings in Gaddafi’s residential compound in Tripoli and his tent in the desert on the outskirts of Tripoli.\n\nPictures taken at the scene 07 June 2011 showed camels wandering around the burnt-out remains of a golf-cart.\n\nWatch What you don’t know about Gaddafi\n\n(“one of 20th century’s greatest freedom fighters” said Mandela)\n\nFacing the bombs of UN-NATO in the Libya Jamahiriya\n\n(every night thousands gather to support Muammar Gaddafi)\n\nCanada needs more 500-pound “smart” bombs to bomb Libya\n\n(ordering 1,300 laser-guided bombs @ $100,000 each)\n\nUN-NATO vs Gaddafi: What all friends of Africa should know\n\n(France-Britain-USA are the “F-UK-US” Alliance)\n\nWatch UN-NATO bombs kill family of Gaddafi close friend Hamedi\n\n(children/fathers/pregnant mothers/uncles/aunts/grandchildren)\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nMuammar al-Qathafi’s conscience has always been clear and his heart clean, with a total subserviance to God/ALLAH alone….and his principles have NEVER changed (so witnessed and testified to, by his daughter Aischa).\n\nI remember seeing photos of Gaddafi in a golf-cart like that and it heart-wrenchingly symbolizes his humbleness.\n\nA picture of Gaddafi in the golf-cart, holding an umbrella, was taken on 22 February 2011 just a few days after the so-called anti-government ‘rebellion’ had begun in Benghazi and ‘protestors’ were making their way to Tripoli.\n\nGaddafi drove the golf-cart to the Green Square – where millions of supporters had gathered – to prove to the people that he hadn’t left the country –\n\nas had been lyingly reported in the BIG BROTHER-owned Ministry of Truth (Lies) world press.\n\nGaddafi was seen in the golf-cart again a week later, this time driving to the People’s Hall, the Libyan version of parliament – called “Congress of the People” – where he gave a speech on the 34th anniversary of his having stepped down as leader in 1977 wherein he handed the government of Libya to congresses of the people. This was 02 March 2011, two weeks before the UN started non-stop bombing of Libya on March 19, 2011 and since which time the Congress of the People – and other non-military government buildings and civilian homes – have been destroyed and thousands of Libyan civilians have been killed and injured.\n\nOn 21 March 2011 UN warplanes bombed Gaddafi’s residential compound in Tripoli – the same one the USA had bombed 25 years ago, the remnants of which Gaddafi has left standing as a memorial to his eighteen-month-old adopted daughter, StepHANIE and the hundred plus other civilians injured and killed that day.\n\nSince then, Gaddafi has mostly lived in a tent set up near his bombed-out former home.\n\nNATO BOMBED the Home school for handicapped and Mongoloid children:\n\nNATO bombed, and Bombed almost every buliding they could find, including schools and Mosques–:\n\nThis one killed 93 IMAM who were praying for peace:\n\nFrom Gaddafi daughter: a glimpse inside the bunker, New York Times, Apr 26, 2011\n\nFrom a Qaddafi Daughter, a Glimpse Inside the Bunker\n\nLouafi Larbi/Reuters\n\nAisha el-Qaddafi, daughter of Col.

Muammar el-Qaddafi\n\nRelated\n\nNATO Says It Is Stepping Up Attacks on Libya Targets (27 April 2011)\n\n__________________________\n\nTRIPOLI, Libya — Aisha el-Qaddafi, the daughter of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, likes to tell her three young children bedtime stories about the afterlife. Now, she says, they are especially appropriate.\n\n“To make them ready,” she said, “because in a time of war, you never know when a rocket or a bomb might hit you, and that will be the end.”\n\nIn a rare interview at her charitable foundation here, Ms. Qaddafi, 36, a Libyan-trained lawyer who once worked on Saddam Hussein’s legal defense team, offered a glimpse into the fatalistic mind-set of the increasingly isolated family at the core of the battle for Libya, the bloodiest arena in the democratic uprising that is sweeping the region.\n\nShe dismissed the rebels as “terrorists” but suggested that some former Qaddafi officials who are now in the opposition’s governing council still “keep in touch with us.” She pleaded for dialogue and talked about democratic reforms. But she dismissed the rebels as unfit for such talks because of their use of violence, hurled personal barbs at President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and, at one point, appeared to disparage the basic idea of electoral democracy.\n\nAfter arranging the interview last week, Ms. Qaddafi spoke for more than an hour late Sunday afternoon, just hours before NATO escalated its airstrikes with an attack that disrupted state television and another on the Libyan leader’s compound in Tripoli. Ms. Qaddafi, one of the many unofficial and sometimes rivalrous Qaddafi family power brokers who dominate Libya’s economic and political life, said the crisis had pulled the family together “like one hand.”\n\nMs. Qaddafi said that she and her seven brothers “have a dialogue between us and exchange points of view” before anyone takes a major step in their common defense. She acknowledged that she had seen news reports that her siblings had proposed easing their father from power in a transition under the direction of her brother Seif al-Islam, but she declined to comment on the details.\n\nShe also pointedly declined to answer when asked if Abdel Fattah Younes, a top rebel military official who was a longtime interior minister, was among the leaders who had kept in touch with the Qaddafi family.\n\n“They say to us that they have their own families, daughters, sons, spouses, and they fear for them, and that is why they have taken those positions,” she said of those rebel leaders. “There are many members of the council who have worked with my father for 42 years and been loyal to him. Do you think they would just go like that?”\n\nInstead of the angry defiance and vows of retribution issued by her father and her brother Seif, Ms. Qaddafi focused on how the West would rue the chaos she predicted would engulf a post-Qaddafi Libya. When pressed repeatedly on how her family could stay in power, she said more than once, “We have a great hope in God.”\n\nMs. Qaddafi has appeared in public twice since the bombings began, before cheering crowds at the colonel’s compound, but she seldom speaks in public. During the interview, she wore close-fitting jeans, Gucci shoes and a pale scarf that did not cover her long blond hair. At times, she laughed at her fate, recalling how the United Nations, after “begging” her to be an envoy for peace in the past, has now referred her to the International Criminal Court. Her staff presented an illustrated biography entitled “Princess of Peace.”\n\nShe said her experience as a volunteer on Saddam Hussein’s defense team offered relevant parallels.\n\n“The opposition in Iraq told the West that when you come to Iraq they will greet you with roses,” she said. “Almost 10 years later they are receiving the Americans with bullets, and, believe me, the situation in Libya will be much worse.”\n\nShe taunted both President Obama and Mrs. Clinton, saying that Mr. Obama had “achieved nothing so far” and laughing as she posed a question to Mrs. Clinton: “Why didn’t you leave the White House when you found out about the cheating of your husband?”\n\nEven as she deprecated the American leaders, she repeatedly called for talks. “The world should come together at a round table,” she said, “under the auspices of international organizations.”\n\nAt the same time, she ruled out any dialogue with the Libyan rebels who now control the eastern half of the country; its commercial center, Misurata; and the western mountain towns of Zintan and Nalut, dismissing them as “terrorists” who “are just fighting for the sake of fighting.”\n\nUnder her brother Seif’s unofficial leadership, she said, the Libyan government had been on the verge of unveiling a constitution as a step toward democratic reform when “this tragedy happened and spoiled things.”\n\nAt the same time, she also derided, and possibly misunderstood, the basic ideas of checks and balances and public accountability in an electoral democracy. “Let me say something about the Western elections that they say are a democratic system of ruling,” she volunteered, referring to handwritten notes she had prepared for the interview. In an election where one candidate won with 50 percent of the vote and another lost with 48 percent, she asked, “Do you call this democracy? Just this one vote? What happened to the 48 percent who said ‘no’?”\n\nShe complained of the “betrayal” of Arabs whose causes her father had supported and the Western allies to whom he had turned over his weapons of mass destruction. “Is this the reward that we get?” she asked. “This would lead every country that has weapons of mass destruction to keep them or make more so they will not meet the same fate as Libya.”\n\nWithout Colonel Qaddafi, she predicted, illegal immigrants from Africa would pour into Europe, Islamic radicals would establish a base on the Mediterranean’s shores, and Libyan tribes would turn their guns on one another.\n\nCiting unconfirmed Libyan intelligence reports, she asserted that the weapons-starved rebels had actually sold arms to the Islamist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. “When my father was there, see how safe Europe was and how safe Libya was?” she asked.\n\nMs. Qaddafi initially dismissed reports of the handful of nights two months ago when protesters took over the streets of Tripoli and almost every other big city, pulling down Qaddafi posters and burning police stations. Then, told that journalists had seen the evidence, she argued the destruction proved they were not civilian protesters but “saboteurs.”\n\nShe also appeared to dismiss witnesses’ accounts of Colonel Qaddafi’s forces shooting unarmed demonstrators. “I am not sure that happened,” she said. “But let’s say it did: it was limited in scope.”\n\nAs for her father’s state of mind, she said with a laugh that he was not worried at all. “He is as strong as the world knows him,” she said. “He is quite sure that the Libyan people are loyal to him.”\n\nHer family still hoped, she said, to go back to its previous position, what she called “a return to normal.” But, she added, “of course we can expedite that if NATO will stop bombing us.”\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on April 27, 2011, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: From Qaddafi Daughter, Glimpses of the Bunker.\n\nwatch video Colonel Gaddafi’s daughter Aisha gives rare insight into her family’s struggle (she fears that a bomb could take their life any day)\n\nby David Kilpatrick, New York Times, Apr 26, 2011\n\nwatch video: Gaddafi’s daughter gives defiant speech, NPR, 15 Apr 2011\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/04/15/135444101/gadhafis-daughter-delivers-defiant-speech-to-supporters\n\nAisha Gadhafi delivered a defiant speech speech in Tripoli today, saying “The suggestion of Gaddafi stepping down is a provocation to all Libyans. “Gadhafi is not in Libya but in the hearts of Libyans“. Aisha made the public appearance at her father’s Bab al-Azizia compound, where since the beginning of the Allied airstrikes Gadhafi supporters have gathered to act as human shields. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan ordered airstrikes on the compound that reportedly killed one of Gadhafi’s daughters.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, NATO warplanes had flown sorties over Tripoli. Explosions and responding gunfire and anti-aircraft fire echoed around the capital, destroying at least one military site and causing blast damage to a nearby university cafeteria. Aisha’s message was one of uncompromising defiance. Referring to the strike in 1986, she said: “They rained down on us their missiles and bombs, they tried to kill me and they killed dozens of children in Libya. Now a quarter of a century later the same missiles and bombs are raining down on the heads of my and your children“.\n\nBelow her was a statue of a giant golden fist crushing a western warplane in its grip. The throbbing crowd – mainly men, but including hundreds of women separated to one side – appeared intoxicated on love and loyalty. Reuters reports that Aisha said the West’s demand that her father step down was an “insult” to Libyans“. The event was held to mark the 25th anniversary of the U.S. airstrikes on the compound.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nSix months later – on 30 April 2011 – Aisha’s baby daughter was killed by UN bombs – as were two of her nephews and one of her brothers. Gaddafi’s wife subsequently gave an interview to CNN on 27 May 2011 decrying the war-crime horror being inflicted on Libyan civilians by UN’s bombing of their country.\n\nBIG BROTHER DOUBLETHINK BOMBING LIBYA\n\n(UN bombs killed Gaddafi son & grandchildren)\n\nMuammar Gaddafi calls for ceasefire & negotiation in Libyan TV address (as air strikes hit government complex in Libyan capital)\n\nGuardian, Apr 30, 2011\n\nMuammar Gaddafi called for a mutual ceasefire and negotiations with Nato powers in a live speech on state TV early on Saturday, while UN-NATO bombs struck a government complex in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The targeted compound included the state television building, which was not damaged. Gaddafi spoke from an undisclosed location. In his rambling pre-dawn speech, the Libyan leader appeared subdued but defiant, repeatedly pausing as he flipped through handwritten notes. “The door to peace is open,” Gaddafi said, sitting behind a desk. “You are the aggressors. We will negotiate with you. Come France, Italy, UK, America, come, we will negotiate with you. Why are you attacking us?” He said Libyans had the right to choose their own political system, but not under the threat of UN-NATO bombings. “Why are you killing our children? Why are you destroying our infrastructure?,” he said.\n\nRebel leaders [UN-backed foreign Islamic-extremist terrorists] have said they will only lay down their arms and begin talks on Libya’s future after Gaddafi and his sons step aside. Gaddafi has repeatedly refused to resign. Reporters visiting the scene of the air strikes were told two damaged buildings housed a commission for women and children and offices of parliamentary staff.\n\nOne of at least three bombs or missiles knocked down a large part of a two-storey building. In another building, doors were blown out and ceiling tiles had dropped to the ground. One missile hit the street outside the attorney general’s office. A policeman said three people were wounded, one seriously….\n\nVideo: Libyan opposition rejects Gaddafi truce offer, al Jazeera, 30 Apr 2011\n\n…The rejection came hours after Gaddafi announced in an address on state television that he would not leave Libya. But he added that he was ready for a truce once “all sides” are involved and UN-NATO stops attacking his forces. “We were the first to welcome a ceasefire and we were the first to accept a ceasefire…but the crusader UN-NATO attack has not stopped,” he said. “We did not attack them or cross the sea…why are they attacking us? Let us negotiate with you, the countries that attack us. Let us negotiate“….Gaddafi urged opposition fighters to lay down their weapons and said Libyans should not be fighting each other. He blamed the uprising on mercenaries and foreigners. “We cannot fight each other,” he said. “We are one family.” Gaddafi denied mass attacks on civilians and challenged UN-NATO to find him the names of 1,000 people who had been killed in the conflict. After the pre-dawn broadcast on Saturday, state television said UN-NATO warplanes had bombed a site in the Libyan capital, Tripoli next to the television building during Gaddafi’s address. “A building adjacent to the Jamahiriya building was bombed during the broadcast of Muammar Gaddafi’s speech and that implies a target on the leader of the revolution himself,” the report said.\n\nGaddafi calls for ceasefire as NATO strikes Tripoli, Wash Post, Saturday, April 30, 2011\n\nTripoli – Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi called for a ceasefire and negotiations with UN-NATO Saturday but refused to surrender power, as UN-alliance warplanes struck a government complex in the capital. In a rambling address on state television which began around 2:30 a.m. and lasted 80 minutes, Gaddafi appeared both calm and defiant, describing military intervention by UN-NATO, designed to protect civilians from his regime, as a massacre.\n\nIn Brussels, a UN-NATO official told the Associated Press the alliance needed “to see not words but actions,” and that UN-NATO would keep up the pressure until the U.N. Security Council mandate to protect Libyan civilians was fulfilled. Rebels [non-Libyan Islamic-extremist agent-provocateur mercenary UN-bakced al-Qaeda terrorists] also rejected Gaddafi’s offer of a ceasefire as “lies.”\n\n“The gate to peace is open,” Gaddafi said, sitting behind a desk and occasionally glancing at copious hand-written notes. “You are the aggressors. We will negotiate with you. Come, France, Italy, U.K., America, come, we will negotiate with you. “Why are you attacking us? Why are you killing our children? Why are you destroying our infrastructure?” he asked, while denying his forces had killed Libyan civilians.\n\nAs he spoke, UN-NATO warplanes attacked government buildings close to the television center in Tripoli in what the Libyan government described as an attempt to kill Gaddafi. The TV images briefly went black on three occasions but the signal was quickly restored and Gaddafi, speaking from an undisclosed location, carried on without interruption. The TV center was not damaged. The Libyan leader, who has ruled for more than four decades, said he would negotiate and uphold a ceasefire if UN-NATO “stopped its planes”. But even as he made the offer he appeared to dismiss the possibility, describing his enemies as al-Qaeda operatives who did not understand what a truce meant. He also refused to step down or leave the country as the rebels [UN-backed non-Libyan Islamic-extremist agent provocateur mercenary al-Qaeda terrorists] and the leaders of the United States, Britain and France demand. “I’m not leaving my country“, Gaddafi said. “No one can force me to leave my country and no one can tell me not to fight for my country“….\n\nGaddafi has made sporadic appearances since the start of the CIA fostered uprising- revolt against him on 17February 2011, mainly to dispel rumors he had fled, to declare how much support he commands in Libya or to demonstrate his defiance. Sitting in front of a painting of tribal horsemen, he spoke on the anniversary of a famous battle near his hometown of Sirte against the Italian occupation 96 years ago, a battle he says his grandfather was killed in. He described young rebels as children “tricked” by UN-NATO, and promised to reward them if they lay down their weapons. “When Libya returns as it was before this conspiracy, you’ll take cars,” he promised. “The money will come to you.”\n\nGaddafi son & 3 grandchildren killed in UN airstrike on Saturday, April 30th\n\nDaily Mail, May 2, 2011\n\nCrowds of Libyans have gathered in the capital today for the funeral of Colonel Gaddafi’s son and three grandchildren. Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, 29, and three of the Libyan leader’s grandchildren were apparently killed in a UN-NATO airstrike on a Tripoli compound on Saturday….Libyan officials accused UN-NATO of deliberating targeting people and trying to assassinate Gaddafi….2,000 people carrying flags and pictures of Gaddafi attended the funeral. They pumped their fists in the air and chanted pro-Gaddafi slogans. One placard read: ‘We are all with Gaddafi’s Libya’. Saif’s coffin, covered in flowers and wrapped in the green flag that has represented Libya since Gaddafi took power in a 1969 coup, was carried through the crowds to the grave at Hani cemetery. Colonel Gaddafi did not appear to be at the funeral but Saif al-Islam, his most prominent son, attended in dark tribal robes. Saif had no children, but three of his nieces and nephews were also said to have been killed in Saturday’s blast. They were the children of his siblings Hannibal, Aisha and Mohammed. The air raid has provoked renewed debate on whether the British and French-led strikes are exceeding a UN mandate to protect civilians. The South African government, which has led an African peace initiative, condemned the attack and said the UN resolution did not cover the assassination of individuals….\n\nMourners vow revenge as Gaddafi son buried, WashPost, May 3, 2011\n\n…Saif al-Arab was killed in a NATO airstrike on his home on Saturday evening, along with a friend and three of Gaddafi’s grandchildren, ages 6 months to 2 years, Libya’s government says. They were the children of Gaddafi’s sons Mohammed and Hannibal and of his daughter, Aisha. The government says that Gaddafi and his wife were also in the residence at the time of the airstrike but escaped unharmed and that UN-NATO must have had some intelligence about the Libyan leader’s whereabouts, perhaps from an informer or from communications intercepts….\n\n2,000 Gaddafi supporters attend funeral of son, Telegraph, May 2, 2011\n\nSaif al-Arab Gaddafi, the leader’s second youngest son, was killed in an allied air strike on Saturday night. Col Gaddafi himself did not attend the funeral, but two of his other sons, Saif al-Islam, who has the highest profile and was seen as his father’s intended successor, and Hannibal were both seen in the crowd. Some mourners fired weapons into the air. Others chanted “revenge for the martyrs” and carried placards reading “We are all with Gaddafi’s Libya”, according to news organisations. The body, covered in a green cloth and with a wreath was delivered to the Al-Hani Cemetery in a black ambulance. Three of Gaddafi’s grandchildren, identified by the authorities as being a child each of Hannibal, their oldest brother, Mohammed, and their sister Aisha, were also buried…. Despite denials from Western leaders that the UN air raid on the Gaddafi compound was an assassination attempt, it has provoked renewed debate on whether the British and French-led strikes are exceeding the UN mandate to protect civilians.\n\nUN bombs kill Gaddafi son & 3 grandchildren, Tripoli Post, May 2, 2011\n\nCrowds mill around the coffin during the funeral of Seif al-Arab in Tripoli. Mourners shouted for revenge in the Libyan capital on Monday as some 2,000 people greeted a funeral procession carrying Muammar Al Qathafi’s second youngest son, Seif al-Arab who officials say was killed in a UN-NATO airstrike. The crowd, carrying flags and pictures of Al Qathafi attended the funeral. They pumped their fists in the air and chanted pro-Al Qathafi slogans as they jostled to get close to Seif’s coffin when it was taken out of a black hearse to a grave at Hani cemetery in Tripoli. One placard read: ‘We are all with Al Qathafi’s Libya.’ Some people prayed, some flashed victory signs and others shouted for revenge. “Revenge, revenge for you Libya,” chanted the crowd around the coffin, which was draped in the green Libyan flag and was topped with a wreath of flowers that were wilting in the heat. Saif’s coffin, covered in flowers and wrapped in the green flag that has represented Libya since Al Qathafi took power in a 1969 coup, was carried through the crowds to the grave. The mourners were led by the leader’s most prominent and oldest son, Seif al-Islam, wearing dark tribal robes, but the Libyan leader Muammar Al Qathafi did not appear to be at the funeral. Despite earlier claims, it was reported today that Seif al-Arab had no children, but three of his nieces and nephews were also said to have been killed in Saturday’s blast. They were the children of his siblings Hannibal, Ayesha and Mohammed.\n\nLibyan officials said 29-year-old Seif al-Arab was killed late on Saturday along with three of Al Qathafi’s grandchildren when UN-NATO bombed the family’s compound in Tripoli. Muammar Al Qathafi and his wife were present during the attack but were unharmed, they said. The deaths triggered attacks by angry crowds on the British and French embassies, and the U.S. diplomatic mission in the capital. Libyan officials also accused UN-NATO of deliberating targeting people and trying to assassinate the Libyan leader.\n\nIt comes as government forces kept up its attacks on rebels, shelling the port area of Misurata with rockets and artillery and disrupting operations to bring supplies in by sea to the besieged city. The UN-NATO air raid has provoked renewed debate on whether the British and French-led strikes are exceeding a UN mandate to protect civilians. The South African government, which has led an African peace initiative, condemned the attack and said the UN resolution did not cover the assassination of individuals. ‘The attacks on leaders and officials can only result in the escalation of tensions and conflicts on all sides and make future reconciliation difficult,’ it said in a statement. Rocket barrages hit the Misurata port area Sunday as an aid ship was trying to unload. Libyan state TV claimed it was shelled to stop UN-NATO delivering weapons to rebels [non-Libyan Islamic-extremist agent-provacateur/mercenty terrorists]. Another aid ship was still waiting off the coast Monday for bombing to stop and mines to be cleared before it could try to deliver supplies and evacuate some 1,000 foreigners and wounded Libyan, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Spokesman Jean-Phillipe Chauzy said: ‘We will wait until Tuesday noon. We are still hoping that things will improve.’ Rights groups say hundreds of people, including many civilians, have been killed in Misurata.

In the rambling predawn address, which lasted for more than an hour, he said: “The door to peace is open. You are the aggressors. We will negotiate with you. Come, France, Italy, UK, America, come, we will negotiate with you. Why are you killing our children?“.\n\nThe Libyan leader continued to deny that his forces had killed any of his countrymen, even as government shells rained down on the rebelheld town of Misrata yesterday. Despite his plea for peace, Gaddafi appeared to dismiss the possibility of a ceasefire, saying his enemies were al Qaeda operatives who did not understand what a truce meant. He also claimed the rebels were children “tricked” by UN-NATO promises and attempted to bribe them to give up their weapons. He said: “When Libya returns as it was, before this conspiracy, you’ll take cars… the money will come to you.”\n\nRebel leaders [UN-backed foreign Islamic-extremist terrorists] have said they will only lay down their arms after Gaddafi and his family step down but he refuses to resign. UN-NATO later rejected the ceasefire call saying they need “actions not words”. And they vowed to continue operations until all attacks and threats against civilians have ceased. Gaddafi’s speech came as the latest UN-NATO air strikes targeted Tripoli, including the state television building. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim denounced the strikes as a crime and alleged they were meant to kill Gaddafi as it was known he was to make a live TV address. A government complex was also hit and reporters visiting the scene were told the damaged buildings included a commission for women and children.\n\nUN barbarically bombing Libyan people/homes/schools/gov’t\n\n(UN killing civilians goes unreported; conspiracy of silence)\n\nSupporters worry about Gaddafi after bombing\n\n(not seen since UN killed son & grandchildren)\n\nWatch Funeral held for Gaddafi’s youngest son Saif al-Arab\n\n(visible emotion on face of elder brother Saif-al-Islam)\n\nThree explosions as UN jets overfly Tripoli, MSN, May 4, 2011\n\nThree explosions have been heard as jets overflew the Libyan capital Tripoli, days after the regime said Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi escaped an air strike that killed one of his sons. Gunfire rang out following the second strike early on Wednesday. A witness said that there were three explosions in total, and that smoke could be seen rising from one of the sites in eastern Tripoli. Early on Sunday, government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said that Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, one of the Libyan leader’s sons, and three of his grandchildren were killed in a UN-NATO airstrike that he termed a bid to assassinate the strongman. An international UN-coalition began carrying out strikes on forces loyal to Gaddafi on 19 March 2011, under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians in the country. UN-NATO took command of operations over Libya on March 31.\n\nGaddafi not seen in public since son & granchildren killed, Reuters, 03 May 2011\n\nUSA intelligence officials believe Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who has not been seen in public since a UN-NATO missile attack reportedly killed his son, is still alive, CIA Director Leon Panetta told NBC television on Tuesday. “The best intelligence we have is that he’s still alive,” Panetta said in an interview with NBC News. Gaddafi, who seized power in a 1969 coup, has not been seen in public since a UN-NATO missile attack on Saturday struck a house in his compound in Tripoli. Libyan officials said Gaddafi survived, but his youngest son and three grandchildren were killed. UN-NATO could not confirm the reports that Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Arab Gaddafi, had been killed….Critics say UN-NATO has already overstepped its mandate with Saturday night’s attack on the Tripoli house.

Echorouk reported that a seven-vehicle convoy carrying 31 asylum seekers, including members of the Gaddafi family, had arrived from Libya to Illizi, the province bordering Libya but had to wait for around 12 hours before they were allowed in. Echorouk, quoting sources it did not identify, reported that Aisha was nine-month pregnant and was in a critical condition, a fact that weighed heavily in the decision made by the Algerian authorities to provide assistance and allow the convoy in on humanitarian ground. The daily said that Algeria also based its decision to receive the high-profile fugitives on the fact that neither Gaddafi’s wife nor two sons or daughter were wanted by the The Hague-based International Criminal Court. The court had approved warrants for the arrest of Gaddafi, his son Saif Al Islam, and Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah Al Senoussi on charges of crimes against humanity. The family members and their helpers are expected to remain in Illizi. The sources ruled out they would be moved up to Algiers, the capital. Libyan rebels, however, are now demanding that Algeria return the fugitives for trial.\n\nwatch Gaddafi radio speech to Libyans listen\n\n(millions braved UN bombs to show support)\n\nGADDAFI GREEN SQUARE SPEECH TO WORLD\n\nWatch Gaddafi banner biggest in world/see from space\n\nGaddafi in radio broadcast vows to defeat"
