        "text": "Aerodynamics and Control of Quadrotors\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBangura, Moses\n\nQuadrotors are aerial vehicles with a four motor-rotor assembly for generating lift and controllability. Their light weight, ease of design and simple dynamics have increased their use in aerial robotics research. There are many quadrotors that are commercially available or under development. Commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors usually lack the ability to be reprogrammed and are unsuitable for use as research platforms. The open-source code developed in this thesis differs from other open-source systems by focusing on the key performance road blocks in implementing high performance experimental quadrotor platforms for research: motor-rotor control for thrust regulation, velocity and attitude estimation, and control for position regulation and trajectory tracking. In all three of these fundamental subsystems, code sub modules for implementation on commonly available hardware are provided. In addition, the thesis provides guidance on scoping and commissioning open-source hardware components to build a custom quadrotor. A key contribution of the thesis is then a design methodology for the development of experimental quadrotor platforms from open-source or commercial off-the-shelf software and hardware components that have active community support. Quadrotors built following the methodology allows the user access to the operation of the subsystems and, in particular, the user can tune the gains of the observers and controllers in order to push the overall system to its performance limits. This enables the quadrotor framework to be used for a variety of applications such as heavy lifting and high performance aggressive manoeuvres by both the hobby and academic communities. To address the question of thrust control, momentum and blade element theories are used to develop aerodynamic models for rotor blades specific to quadrotors. With the aerodynamic models, a novel thrust estimation and control scheme that improves on existing RPM (revolutions per minute) control of\n\nQuadrotor trajectory tracking using PID cascade control\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIdres, M.; Mustapha, O.; Okasha, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nQuadrotors have been applied to collect information for traffic, weather monitoring, surveillance and aerial photography. In order to accomplish their mission, quadrotors have to follow specific trajectories. This paper presents proportional-integral-derivative (PID) cascade control of a quadrotor for path tracking problem when velocity and acceleration are small. It is based on near hover controller for small attitude angles. The integral of time-weighted absolute error (ITAE) criterion is used to determine the PID gains as a function of quadrotor modeling parameters. The controller is evaluated in three-dimensional environment in Simulink. Overall, the tracking performance is found to be excellent for small velocity condition.\n\nFlocking of quad-rotor UAVs with fuzzy control.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMao, Xiang; Zhang, Hongbin; Wang, Yanhui\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis paper investigates the flocking problem of quad-rotor UAVs. Considering the actual situations, we derived a new simplified quad-rotor UAV model which is more reasonable. Based on the model, the T-S fuzzy model of attitude dynamic equation and the corresponding T-S fuzzy feedback controller are discussed. By introducing a double-loop control construction, we adjust its attitude to realize the position control. Then a flocking algorithm is proposed to achieve the flocking of the quad-rotor UAVs. Compared with the flocking algorithm of the mass point model, we dealt with the collision problem of the quad-rotor UAVs. In order to improve the airspace utilization, a more compact configuration called quasi e-lattice is constructed to guarantee the compact flight of the quad-rotor UAVs. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. Copyright Â© 2018 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As applications diversify, quadrotors are increasingly required to operate under unknown mass properties, for example as a multirole sensor platform or for package delivery operations. The work presented here consists of the derivation of a generalized quadrotor dynamic model without the typical simplifying assumptions on the first and second moments of mass. The maximum payload capacity of a quadrotor in hover, and the observability of the unknown mass properties are discussed. A brief introduction of L1 adaptive control is provided, and three different L 1 adaptive controllers were designed for the Parrot AR.Drone quadrotor. Their tracking and disturbance rejection performance was compared to the baseline nonlinear controller in experiments. Finally, the results of the combination of L1 adaptive control with iterative learning control are presented, showing high performance trajectory tracking under uncertainty.\n\nThe Quadrotor Dynamic Modeling and Indoor Target Tracking Control Method\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDewei Zhang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A reliable nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor is presented. The nonlinear dynamic model includes actuator dynamic and aerodynamic effect. Since the rotors run near a constant hovering speed, the dynamic model is simplified at hovering operating point. Based on the simplified nonlinear dynamic model, the PID controllers with feedback linearization and feedforward control are proposed using the backstepping method. These controllers are used to control both the attitude and position of the quadrotor. A fully custom quadrotor is developed to verify the correctness of the dynamic model and control algorithms. The attitude of the quadrotor is measured by inertia measurement unit (IMU. The position of the quadrotor in a GPS-denied environment, especially indoor environment, is estimated from the downward camera and ultrasonic sensor measurements. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed dynamic model and control algorithms are demonstrated by experimental results. It is shown that the vehicle achieves robust vision-based hovering and moving target tracking control.\n\nBackstepping Based Formation Control of Quadrotors with the State Transformation Technique\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKeun Uk Lee\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper, a backstepping-based formation control of quadrotors with the state transformation technique is proposed. First, the dynamics of a quadrotor is derived by using the NewtonâEuler formulation. Next, a backstepping-based formation control for quadrotors using a state transformation technique is presented. In the position control, which is the basis of formation control, it is possible to derive the reference attitude angles employing a state transformation technique without the small angle assumption or the simplified dynamics usually used. Stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theorem shows that the proposed formation controller can provide a quadrotor formation error system that is asymptotically stabilized. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed formation control method through comparison simulations.\n\nAttitude Control of Quad-rotor by Improving the Reliability of Multi-Sensor System\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYu, Dong Hyeon; Chong, Kil To [Chon-bok National University, Jeonju (Korea, Republic of); Park, Jong Ho [Seonam University, Namwon (Korea, Republic of); Ryu, Ji Hyoung [ETRI, Daejeon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2015-05-15\n\nThis paper presents the results of study for improving the reliability of quadrotor attitude control by applying a multi-sensor along with a data fusion algorithm. First, a mathematical model of the quadrotor dynamics was developed. Then, using the quadrotor mathematical model, simulations were performed using the improved reliability multi-sensor data as the inputs. From the simulation results, we designed a Gimbal-equipped quadrotor system. With the quadrotor in a hover state, we performed experiments according to the angle change of the user's specifications . We then calculated the attitude control data from the actual experimental data. Furthermore, with additional simulations, we verified the performance of the designed quadrotor attitude control system with multiple sensors.\n\nAutonomous Control of a Quadrotor UAV Using Fuzzy Logic\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSureshkumar, Vijaykumar\n\nUAVs are being increasingly used today than ever before in both military and civil applications. They are heavily preferred in \"dull, dirty or dangerous\" mission scenarios. Increasingly, UAVs of all kinds are being used in policing, fire-fighting, inspection of structures, pipelines etc. Recently, the FAA gave its permission for UAVs to be used on film sets for motion capture and high definition video recording. The rapid development in MEMS and actuator technology has made possible a plethora of UAVs that are suited for commercial applications in an increasingly cost effective manner. An emerging popular rotary wing UAV platform is the Quadrotor A Quadrotor is a helicopter with four rotors, that make it more stable; but more complex to model and control. Characteristics that provide a clear advantage over other fixed wing UAVs are VTOL and hovering capabilities as well as a greater maneuverability. It is also simple in construction and design compared to a scaled single rotorcraft. Flying such UAVs using a traditional radio Transmitter-Receiver setup can be a daunting task especially in high stress situations. In order to make such platforms widely applicable, a certain level of autonomy is imperative to the future of such UAVs. This thesis paper presents a methodology for the autonomous control of a Quadrotor UAV using Fuzzy Logic. Fuzzy logic control has been chosen over conventional control methods as it can deal effectively with highly nonlinear systems, allows for imprecise data and is extremely modular. Modularity and adaptability are the key cornerstones of FLC. The objective of this thesis is to present the steps of designing, building and simulating an intelligent flight control module for a Quadrotor UAV. In the course of this research effort, a Quadrotor UAV is indigenously developed utilizing the resources of an online open source project called Aeroquad. System design is comprehensively dealt with. A math model for the Quadrotor is developed and a\n\nPID self tuning control based on Mamdani fuzzy logic control for quadrotor stabilization\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPriyambodo, Tri Kuntoro, E-mail: mastri@ugm.ac.id; Putra, Agfianto Eko [Aerospace and Aeronautics Electronics Research Group, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta (Indonesia); Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta (Indonesia); Dharmawan, Andi, E-mail: andi-dharmawan@ugm.ac.id [Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta (Indonesia)\n\n2016-02-01\n\nQuadrotor as one type of UAV have the ability to perform Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL). It allows the Quadrotor to be stationary hovering in the air. PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control system is one of the control methods that are commonly used. It is usually used to optimize the Quadrotor stabilization at least based on the three Eulerian angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) as input parameters for the control system. The three constants of PID can be obtained in various methods. The simplest method is tuning manually. This method has several weaknesses. For example if the three constants are not exact, the resulting response will deviate from the desired result. By combining the methods of PID with fuzzy logic systems where human expertise is implemented into the machine language is expected to further optimize the control system.\n\nSimple adaptive control system design for a quadrotor with an internal PFC\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMizumoto, Ikuro; Nakamura, Takuto; Kumon, Makoto; Takagi, Taro [Dept. of Mechanical Systems Engineering, Kumamoto University 2-39-1 Kurokami, Kumamoto, 860-8555 (Japan)\n\n2014-12-10\n\nThe paper deals with an adaptive control system design problem for a four rotor helicopter or quadrotor. A simple adaptive control design scheme with a parallel feedforward compensator (PFC) in the internal loop of the considered quadrotor will be proposed based on the backstepping strategy. As is well known, the backstepping control strategy is one of the advanced control strategy for nonlinear systems. However, the control algorithm will become complex if the system has higher order relative degrees. We will show that one can skip some design steps of the backstepping method by introducing a PFC in the inner loop of the considered quadrotor, so that the structure of the obtained controller will be simplified and a high gain based adaptive feedback control system will be designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method will be confirmed through numerical simulations.\n\nSecond order sliding mode control for a quadrotor UAV.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZheng, En-Hui; Xiong, Jing-Jing; Luo, Ji-Liang\n\n2014-07-01\n\nA method based on second order sliding mode control (2-SMC) is proposed to design controllers for a small quadrotor UAV. For the switching sliding manifold design, the selection of the coefficients of the switching sliding manifold is in general a sophisticated issue because the coefficients are nonlinear. In this work, in order to perform the position and attitude tracking control of the quadrotor perfectly, the dynamical model of the quadrotor is divided into two subsystems, i.e., a fully actuated subsystem and an underactuated subsystem. For the former, a sliding manifold is defined by combining the position and velocity tracking errors of one state variable, i.e., the sliding manifold has two coefficients. For the latter, a sliding manifold is constructed via a linear combination of position and velocity tracking errors of two state variables, i.e., the sliding manifold has four coefficients. In order to further obtain the nonlinear coefficients of the sliding manifold, Hurwitz stability analysis is used to the solving process. In addition, the flight controllers are derived by using Lyapunov theory, which guarantees that all system state trajectories reach and stay on the sliding surfaces. Extensive simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Copyright Â© 2014 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, the dynamic model of the quadrotor is divided into two subsystems, i.e., a fully actuated subsystem and an underactuated subsystem. Secondly, the dynamic flight controllers of the quadrotor are formulated based on global fast dynamic TSMC, which is able to guarantee that the position and velocity tracking errors of all system state variables converge to zero in finite-time. Moreover, the global fast dynamic TSMC is also able to eliminate the chattering phenomenon caused by the switching control action and realize the high precision performance. In addition, the stabilities of two subsystems are demonstrated by Lyapunov theory, respectively. Lastly, the simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method in the presence of external disturbances. Copyright Â© 2016 ISA.

Navabi\n\nFull Text Available Abstract This paper focuses on robust optimal adaptive control strategy to deal with tracking problem of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV in presence of parametric uncertainties, actuator amplitude constraints, and unknown time-varying external disturbances. First, Lyapunov-based indirect adaptive controller optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO is developed for multi-input multi-output (MIMO nonlinear quadrotor to prevent input constraints violation, and then disturbance observer-based control (DOBC technique is aggregated with the control system to attenuate the effects of disturbance generated by an exogenous system. The performance of synthesis control method is evaluated by a new performance index function in time-domain, and the stability analysis is carried out using Lyapunov theory. Finally, illustrative numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach in altitude and attitude tracking under several conditions, including large time-varying uncertainty, exogenous disturbance, and control input constraints.\n\nDevelopment of a Quadrotor Test Bed â Modelling, Parameter Identification, Controller Design and Trajectory Generation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWei Dong\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper, a quadrotor test bed is developed. The technical approach for this test bed is firstly proposed by utilizing a commercial quadrotor, a Vicon motion capture system and a ground station. Then, the mathematical model of the quadrotor is formulated considering aerodynamic effects, and the parameter identification approaches for this model are provided accordingly. Based on the developed model and identified parameters, a simulation environment that is consistent with the real system is developed. Subsequently, a flight control strategy and a trajectory generation method, both of which are conceptually and computationally lightweight, are developed and tested in the simulation environment. The developed algorithms are then directly transplanted to the real system, and the experimental results show that their responses in the real-time flights match well with those from the simulations. This indicates that the control algorithms developed for the quadrotor can be preliminarily verified and refined though simulations, and then directly implemented to the real system, which could significantly reduce the experimental risks and costs. Meanwhile, real-time experiments show that the developed flight controller can efficiently stabilize the quadrotor when external disturbances exist, and the trajectory generation approach can provide safe guidance for the quadrotor to fly smoothly through cluttered environments with obstacle rings. All of these features are valuable for real applications, thus demonstrating the feasibility of further development.\n\nStabilization and control of quad-rotor helicopter using a smartphone device\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDesai, Alok; Lee, Dah-Jye; Moore, Jason; Chang, Yung-Ping\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn recent years, autonomous, micro-unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), or more specifically hovering micro- UAVs, have proven suitable for many promising applications such as unknown environment exploration and search and rescue operations. The early versions of UAVs had no on-board control capabilities, and were difficult for manual control from a ground station. Many UAVs now are equipped with on-board control systems that reduce the amount of control required from the ground-station operator. However, the limitations on payload, power consumption and control without human interference remain the biggest challenges. This paper proposes to use a smartphone as the sole computational device to stabilize and control a quad-rotor. The goal is to use the readily available sensors in a smartphone such as the GPS, the accelerometer, the rate-gyros, and the camera to support vision-related tasks such as flight stabilization, estimation of the height above ground, target tracking, obstacle detection, and surveillance. We use a quad-rotor platform that has been built in the Robotic Vision Lab at Brigham Young University for our development and experiments. An Android smartphone is connected through the USB port to an external hardware that has a microprocessor and circuitries to generate pulse-width modulation signals to control the brushless servomotors on the quad-rotor. The high-resolution camera on the smartphone is used to detect and track features to maintain a desired altitude level. The vision algorithms implemented include template matching, Harris feature detector, RANSAC similarity-constrained homography, and color segmentation. Other sensors are used to control yaw, pitch, and roll of the quad-rotor. This smartphone-based system is able to stabilize and control micro-UAVs and is ideal for micro-UAVs that have size, weight, and power limitations.\n\nDirect Self-Repairing Control for Quadrotor Helicopter Attitude Systems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHuiliao Yang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A quadrotor helicopter with uncertain actuator faults, such as loss of effectiveness and lock-in-place, is studied in this paper. An adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller based on direct self-repairing control is designed for such nonlinear system to track the desired output signal, when any actuator of this quadrotor helicopter is loss of effectiveness or stuck at some place. Moreover, using the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the whole system and the convergence of the tracking error can be guaranteed. Finally, the availability of the proposed method is verified by simulation on 3-DOF hover to ensure that the system performance under faulty conditions can be quickly recovered to its normal level. And this proposed method is also proved to be better than that of LQR through simulation.\n\nAn experimental stationary quadrotor with variable DOF\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\n2016-08-26\n\nAug 26, 2016 ...

A sufficient condition of the existence for RGCC is derived by Lyapunov stability theorem. The designed RGCC not only guarantees the whole closed-loop system asymptotically stable but also makes the quadratic performance level built for the closed-loop system have an upper bound irrespective to all admissible parameter uncertainties. Then, an optimal robust guaranteed cost controller is developed to minimize the upper bound of performance level. Simulation results verify the presented control algorithms possess small overshoot and short setting time, with which the quadrotor has ability to perform set-point tracking task well.

All the drags, aerodynamic, coriolis and gyroscopic effect are neglected. A Newton-Euler formulation is used to derive the mathematical model. A smart self-tuning fuzzy PID controller based on an EKF algorithm is proposed for the attitude and position control of the quadrotor. The PID gains are tuned using a self-tuning fuzzy algorithm. The self-tuning of fuzzy parameters is achieved based on an EKF algorithm. A smart selection technique and exclusive tuning of active fuzzy parameters is proposed to reduce the computational time. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for path planning in a closed and known environment filled with obstacles and/or boundaries. The Dijkstra algorithm helps avoid obstacle and find the shortest route from a given initial position to the final position.\n\nAn indirect adaptive neural control of a visual-based quadrotor robot for pursuing a moving target.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShirzadeh, Masoud; Amirkhani, Abdollah; Jalali, Aliakbar; Mosavi, Mohammad R\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThis paper aims to use a visual-based control mechanism to control a quadrotor type aerial robot which is in pursuit of a moving target. The nonlinear nature of a quadrotor, on the one hand, and the difficulty of obtaining an exact model for it, on the other hand, constitute two serious challenges in designing a controller for this UAV. A potential solution for such problems is the use of intelligent control methods such as those that rely on artificial neural networks and other similar approaches. In addition to the two mentioned problems, another problem that emerges due to the moving nature of a target is the uncertainty that exists in the target image. By employing an artificial neural network with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) an indirect adaptive neural controller has been designed for a quadrotor robot in search of a moving target. The results of the simulation for different paths show that the quadrotor has efficiently tracked the moving target. Copyright Â© 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this method, the nonlinear model is firstly transformed to the linear model based on quasi-LPV method; then, the quadrotor nonlinear motion function is transformed to transfer function matrix based on the transformation model from the state space to the transfer function; further, IMC is designed to control the controlled object represented by transfer function matrix and realize quadrotor trajectory tracking. The performance of the controller proposed in this paper is tested by tracking for three reference trajectories with drastic changes. The simulation results indicate that the control method proposed in this paper has stronger robustness to parameters uncertainty and disturbance rejection performance.\n\nDesign of passive fault-tolerant controllers of a quadrotor based on sliding mode theory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMerheb Abdel-Razzak\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract In this paper, sliding mode control is used to develop two passive fault tolerant controllers for an AscTec Pelican UAV quadrotor. In the first approach, a regular sliding mode controller (SMC augmented with an integrator uses the robustness property of variable structure control to tolerate partial actuator faults. The second approach is a cascaded sliding mode controller with an inner and outer SMC loops. In this configuration, faults are tolerated in the fast inner loop controlling the velocity system. Tuning the controllers to find the optimal values of the sliding mode controller gains is made using the ecological systems algorithm (ESA, a biologically inspired stochastic search algorithm based on the natural equilibrium of animal species. The controllers are tested using SIMULINK in the presence of two different types of actuator faults, partial loss of motor power affecting all the motors at once, and partial loss of motor speed. Results of the quadrotor following a continuous path demonstrated the effectiveness of the controllers, which are able to tolerate a significant number of actuator faults despite the lack of hardware redundancy in the quadrotor system. Tuning the controller using a faulty system improves further its ability to afford more severe faults. Simulation results show that passive schemes reserve their important role in fault tolerant control and are complementary to active techniques\n\nA Survey of Modelling and Identification of Quadrotor Robot\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXiaodong Zhang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A quadrotor is a rotorcraft capable of hover, forward flight, and VTOL and is emerging as a fundamental research and application platform at present with flexibility, adaptability, and ease of construction. Since a quadrotor is basically considered an unstable system with the characteristics of dynamics such as being intensively nonlinear, multivariable, strongly coupled, and underactuated, a precise and practical model is critical to control the vehicle which seems to be simple to operate. As a rotorcraft, the dynamics of a quadrotor is mainly dominated by the complicated aerodynamic effects of the rotors. This paper gives a tutorial of the platform configuration, methodology of modeling, comprehensive nonlinear model, the aerodynamic effects, and model identification for a quadrotor.\n\nAdaptive fuzzy PID control for a quadrotor stabilisation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCherrat, N.; Boubertakh, H.; Arioui, H.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis paper deals with the design of an adaptive fuzzy PID control law for attitude and altitude stabilization of a quadrotor despite the system model uncertainties and disturbances. To this end, a PID control with adaptive gains is used in order to approximate a virtual ideal control previously designed to achieve the predefined objective. Specifically, the control gains are estimated and adjusted by mean of a fuzzy system whose parameters are adjusted online via a gradient descent-based adaptation law. The analysis of the closed-loop system is given by the Lyapunov approach. The simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.\n\nOutput feedback control of a quadrotor UAV using neural networks.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDierks, Travis; Jagannathan, Sarangapani\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn this paper, a new nonlinear controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed using neural networks (NNs) and output feedback. The assumption on the availability of UAV dynamics is not always practical, especially in an outdoor environment. Therefore, in this work, an NN is introduced to learn the complete dynamics of the UAV online, including uncertain nonlinear terms like aerodynamic friction and blade flapping. Although a quadrotor UAV is underactuated, a novel NN virtual control input scheme is proposed which allows all six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the UAV to be controlled using only four control inputs. Furthermore, an NN observer is introduced to estimate the translational and angular velocities of the UAV, and an output feedback control law is developed in which only the position and the attitude of the UAV are considered measurable. It is shown using Lyapunov theory that the position, orientation, and velocity tracking errors, the virtual control and observer estimation errors, and the NN weight estimation errors for each NN are all semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the presence of bounded disturbances and NN functional reconstruction errors while simultaneously relaxing the separation principle. The effectiveness of proposed output feedback control scheme is then demonstrated in the presence of unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and simulation results are included to demonstrate the theoretical conjecture.\n\nFeedback Linearization approach for Standard and Fault Tolerant control: Application to a Quadrotor UAV Testbed\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGhandour, J; Aberkane, S; Ponsart, J-C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this paper the control problem of a quadrotor vehicle experiencing a rotor failure is investigated. We develop a Feedback linearization approach to design a controller whose task is to make the vehicle performs trajectory following. Then we use the same approach to design a controller whose task is to make the vehicle enter a stable spin around its vertical axis, while retaining zero angular velocities around the other axis when a rotor failure is present. These conditions can be exploited to design a second control loop, which is used to perform trajectory following. The proposed double control loop architecture allows the vehicle to perform both trajectory and roll/pitch control. At last, to test the robustness of the feedback linearization technique, we applied wind to the quadrotor in mid flight\n\nDesign of a quadrotor flight test stand for system identification\n\nCSIR Research Space (South Africa)\n\nBeharie, MM\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents the design, development and construction of a flight test stand for a quadrotor UAV.

They are employed in many applications, from military operations to civilian tasks. Quad-rotor helicopter autonomous navigation based on the vanishing point fast estimation (VPFE algorithm using clustering principle is implemented in this paper. For images collected by the camera of quad-rotor helicopter, the system executes the process of preprocessing of image, deleting noise interference, edge extracting using Canny operator, and extracting straight lines by randomized hough transformation (RHT method. Then system obtains the position of vanishing point and regards it as destination point and finally controls the autonomous navigation of the quad-rotor helicopter by continuous modification according to the calculated navigation error. The experimental results show that the quad-rotor helicopter can implement the destination navigation well in the indoor environment.\n\nSeguimiento de trayectorias tridimensionales de un quadrotor mediante control PVA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSilvia EstellÃÂ©s MartÃÂ­nez\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Resumen: Este trabajo presenta el modelado de un quadrotor como un sistema multicuerpo llevado a cabo mediante el software Vehicle- Sim, en el que los diferentes componentes del sistema son descritos mediante una estructura paterno-filial seÃÂ±alando las restricciones fÃÂ­sicas entre ellos.

The method is based on a special parameterization of the antecedent part of fuzzy systems that results in fuzzy-partitions for antecedents. This antecedent parameter representation method of fuzzy rules ensures upholding of predefined linguistic value ordering and ensures that fuzzy-partitions remain intact throughout an unconstrained hybrid evolutionary and gradient descent based optimization process. In the equations of motion the first order derivative component is calculated based on Christoffel symbols, the derivatives of fuzzy systems are used for modelling the Coriolis effects, gyroscopic and centrifugal terms. The non-linear parameters are subjected to an initial global evolutionary optimization scheme and fine tuning with gradient descent based local search. Simulation results of the proposed new quadrotor dynamic model identification method are promising.\n\nData Driven, Force Based Interaction for Quadrotors\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcKinnon, Christopher D.\n\nQuadrotors are small and agile, and are becoming more capable for their compact size. They are expected perform a wide variety of tasks including inspection, physical interaction, and formation flight. In all of these tasks, the quadrotors can come into close proximity with infrastructure or other quadrotors, and may experience significant external forces and torques. Reacting properly in each case is essential to completing the task safely and effectively. In this thesis, we develop an algorithm, based on the Unscented Kalman Filter, to estimate such forces and torques without making assumptions about the source of the forces and torques. We then show in experiment how the proposed estimation algorithm can be used in conjunction with controls and machine learning to choose the appropriate actions in a wide variety of tasks including detecting downwash, tracking the wind induced by a fan, and detecting proximity to the wall.\n\nAdaptive Trajectory Tracking Control using Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWenjie Lou\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Inaccurate system parameters and unpredicted external disturbances affect the performance of non-linear controllers. In this paper, a new adaptive control algorithm under the reinforcement framework is proposed to stabilize a quadrotor helicopter. Based on a command-filtered non-linear control algorithm, adaptive elements are added and learned by policy-search methods. To predict the inaccurate system parameters, a new kernel-based regression learning method is provided. In addition, Policy learning by Weighting Exploration with the Returns (PoWER and Return Weighted Regression (RWR are utilized to learn the appropriate parameters for adaptive elements in order to cancel the effect of external disturbance. Furthermore, numerical simulations under several conditions are performed, and the ability of adaptive trajectory-tracking control with reinforcement learning are demonstrated.\n\nColour-based Object Detection and Tracking for Autonomous Quadrotor UAV\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKadouf, Hani Hunud A; Mustafah, Yasir Mohd\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWith robotics becoming a fundamental aspect of modern society, further research and consequent application is ever increasing. Aerial robotics, in particular, covers applications such as surveillance in hostile military zones or search and rescue operations in disaster stricken areas, where ground navigation is impossible. The increased visual capacity of UAV's (Unmanned Air Vehicles) is also applicable in the support of ground vehicles to provide supplies for emergency assistance, for scouting purposes or to extend communication beyond insurmountable land or water barriers. The Quadrotor, which is a small UAV has its lift generated by four rotors and can be controlled by altering the speeds of its motors relative to each other. The four rotors allow for a higher payload than single or dual rotor UAVs, which makes it safer and more suitable to carry camera and transmitter equipment. An onboard camera is used to capture and transmit images of the Quadrotor's First Person View (FPV) while in flight, in real time, wirelessly to a base station. The aim of this research is to develop an autonomous quadrotor platform capable of transmitting real time video signals to a base station for processing. The result from the image analysis will be used as a feedback in the quadrotor positioning control. To validate the system, the algorithm should have the capacity to make the quadrotor identify, track or hover above stationary or moving objects\n\nTowards a Low-Cost Quadrotor Research Platform\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-03-01\n\nFIGURES Figure 1.

This aircraft achieves high accuracy in the attitude control and smooth flight mode transition with four rotors rather than the conventional VTOL UAVs using control surfaces. The proposal of angled rotor mounting is adopted to address the issue of insufficient yaw control authority. The layout of symmetrically mounted fixed wings makes the aircraft have capability of rapid bidirectional flight mode transition to improve maneuverability. To validate the performance of the aircraft, simulation and flight experiments are both implemented. These results show that the aircraft has a rapid yaw response under condition of the stable attitude control. In comparative experiment, it is shown that the aircraft is more flexible than other similar configuration of aircrafts. This symmetrical quad-rotor biplane tail-sitter VTOL UAV will have a wide range of potential applications in the military and civilian areas due to its superior performance..\n\nControl Neuronal en LÃ­nea para RegulaciÃ³n y Seguimiento de Trayectorias de PosiciÃ³n para un Quadrotor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHugo YaÃ±ez-Badillo\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Resumen: Los sistemas de control automÃ¡tico dÃ­a a dÃ­a se han convertido en elementos importantes en la vida cotidiana, en tal sentido, se deben proponer nuevas y mejores formas de incorporar modelos matemÃ¡ticos y algoritmos de control adaptativos para superar la gran cantidad de cambios tÃ©cnicos y fÃ­sicos a los que se enfrentan para su utilizaciÃ³n.

Abstract: Automatic control systems every day become more important in everyday life; therefore, it must find new and better ways to incorporate mathematical models and adaptive control algorithms to cope with a number of technical and physical challenges for exploitation. In this paper, the algorithm of the dynamic model of a Quadrotor applied to an angular position and trajectory control as a study case is detailed. Due to nonlinear nature of this type of systems, an adaptive on line neurocontroller algorithm based on B-spline neural networks is proposed, the learning procedure is divided in two stages: a an initial off line training and; b an on line continuous learning. This form of learning allows the Quadrotor extend its\n\nOptimal Path Planning and Control of Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Area Coverage\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFan, Jiankun\n\nAn Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without a human pilot on board. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by computers onboard the vehicle, or remotely by a pilot on the ground, or by another vehicle. In recent years, UAVs have been used more commonly than prior years. The example includes areo-camera where a high speed camera was attached to a UAV which can be used as an airborne camera to obtain aerial video. It also could be used for detecting events on ground for tasks such as surveillance and monitoring which is a common task during wars. Similarly UAVs can be used for relaying communication signal during scenarios when regular communication infrastructure is destroyed. The objective of this thesis is motivated from such civilian operations such as search and rescue or wildfire detection and monitoring. One scenario is that of search and rescue where UAV's objective is to geo-locate a person in a given area. The task is carried out with the help of a camera whose live feed is provided to search and rescue personnel. For this objective, the UAV needs to carry out scanning of the entire area in the shortest time. The aim of this thesis to develop algorithms to enable a UAV to scan an area in optimal time, a problem referred to as \"Coverage Control\" in literature. The thesis focuses on a special kind of UAVs called \"quadrotor\" that is propelled with the help of four rotors. The overall objective of this thesis is achieved via solving two problems. The first problem is to develop a dynamic control model of quadrtor. In this thesis, a proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) based feedback control system is developed and implemented on MATLAB's Simulink. The PID controller helps track any given trajectory. The second problem is to design a trajectory that will fulfill the mission. The planed trajectory should make sure the quadrotor will scan the whole area without missing any part to make sure that the quadrotor will find the lost\n\nGlobal Tracking Control of Quadrotor VTOL Aircraft in Three-Dimensional Space\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDuc Khac Do\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a method to design controllers that force a quadrotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL aircraft to globally asymptotically track a reference trajectory in three-dimensional space. Motivated by the vehicle's steering practice, the roll and pitch angles are considered as immediate controls plus the total thrust forceÂ provided by the aircraft's four rotors to control the position and yaw angle of the aircraft. The control design is based on the newly introduced one-step ahead backstepping, the standard backstepping and Lyapunov's direct methods. A combination of Euler angles and unit-quaternion for the attitude representation of the aircraft is used to obtain global tracking control results. The paper also includes a design of observers that exponentially estimate the aircraft's linear velocity vector and disturbances. Simulations illustrate the results.\n\nPosition and attitude tracking control for a quadrotor UAV.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXiong, Jing-Jing; Zheng, En-Hui\n\n2014-05-01\n\nA synthesis control method is proposed to perform the position and attitude tracking control of the dynamical model of a small quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where the dynamical model is underactuated, highly-coupled and nonlinear. Firstly, the dynamical model is divided into a fully actuated subsystem and an underactuated subsystem. Secondly, a controller of the fully actuated subsystem is designed through a novel robust terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) algorithm, which is utilized to guarantee all state variables converge to their desired values in short time, the convergence time is so small that the state variables are acted as time invariants in the underactuated subsystem, and, a controller of the underactuated subsystem is designed via sliding mode control (SMC), in addition, the stabilities of the subsystems are demonstrated by Lyapunov theory, respectively. Lastly, in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed control method, the aerodynamic forces and moments and air drag taken as external disturbances are taken into account, the obtained simulation results show that the synthesis control method has good performance in terms of position and attitude tracking when faced with external disturbances.

The quadrotorâs attitude is represented by the unit quaternion rather than Euler angles to avoid singularity problem. Taking dynamical behavior of motors into consideration and ignoring aerodynamic effect, a nonlinear controller is developed to stabilize the attitude. The control design is accomplished by using backstepping control technique. The proposed control law is based on the compensation for the Coriolis and gyroscope torques. Applying Lyapunov stability analysis proves that the closed-loop attitude system is asymptotic stable. Moreover, the controller can guarantee that all the states of the system are uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of external disturbance torque. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is analytically authenticated and also validated via simulation study.\n\nQuad-rotor flight path energy optimization\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKemper, Edward\n\nQuad-Rotor unmanned areal vehicles (UAVs) have been a popular area of research and development in the last decade, especially with the advent of affordable microcontrollers like the MSP 430 and the Raspberry Pi. Path-Energy Optimization is an area that is well developed for linear systems. In this thesis, this idea of path-energy optimization is extended to the nonlinear model of the Quad-rotor UAV. The classical optimization technique is adapted to the nonlinear model that is derived for the problem at hand, coming up with a set of partial differential equations and boundary value conditions to solve these equations. Then, different techniques to implement energy optimization algorithms are tested using simulations in Python. First, a purely nonlinear approach is used. This method is shown to be computationally intensive, with no practical solution available in a reasonable amount of time. Second, heuristic techniques to minimize the energy of the flight path are tested, using Ziegler-Nichols' proportional integral derivative (PID) controller tuning technique. Finally, a brute force look-up table based PID controller is used. Simulation results of the heuristic method show that both reliable control of the system and path-energy optimization are achieved in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nIntelligent Controller Design for Quad-Rotor Stabilization in Presence of Parameter Variations\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOualid Doukhi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents the mathematical model of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV and the design of robust Self-Tuning PID controller based on fuzzy logic, which offers several advantages over certain types of conventional control methods, specifically in dealing with highly nonlinear systems and parameter uncertainty. The proposed controller is applied to the inner and outer loop for heading and position trajectory tracking control to handle the external disturbances caused by the variation in the payload weight during the flight period. The results of the numerical simulation using gazebo physics engine simulator and real-time experiment using AR drone 2.0 test bed demonstrate the effectiveness of this intelligent control strategy which can improve the robustness of the whole system and achieve accurate trajectory tracking control, comparing it with the conventional proportional integral derivative (PID.\n\nOutdoor altitude stabilization of QuadRotor based on type-2 fuzzy and fuzzy PID\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWicaksono, H.; Yusuf, Y.

The throttle signal as a control input was provided by the controller to leveling QuadRotor in particular altitude and known well as altitude stabilization. The parameter of type-2 fuzzy and fuzzy PID was tuned in several heights to get the best control parameter for any height. Type-2 fuzzy produced better result than fuzzy PID but had a slow response in the beginning.\n\nPath planning of decentralized multi-quadrotor based on fuzzy-cell decomposition algorithm\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIswanto, Wahyunggoro, Oyas; Cahyadi, Adha Imam\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe paper aims to present a design algorithm for multi quadrotor lanes in order to move towards the goal quickly and avoid obstacles in an area with obstacles. There are several problems in path planning including how to get to the goal position quickly and avoid static and dynamic obstacles. To overcome the problem, therefore, the paper presents fuzzy logic algorithm and fuzzy cell decomposition algorithm. Fuzzy logic algorithm is one of the artificial intelligence algorithms which can be applied to robot path planning that is able to detect static and dynamic obstacles. Cell decomposition algorithm is an algorithm of graph theory used to make a robot path map. By using the two algorithms the robot is able to get to the goal position and avoid obstacles but it takes a considerable time because they are able to find the shortest path. Therefore, this paper describes a modification of the algorithms by adding a potential field algorithm used to provide weight values on the map applied for each quadrotor by using decentralized controlled, so that the quadrotor is able to move to the goal position quickly by finding the shortest path. The simulations conducted have shown that multi-quadrotor can avoid various obstacles and find the shortest path by using the proposed algorithms.\n\nQuadrotor Intercept Trajectory Planning and Simulation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-06-01\n\nthe airframe.

In the design process of control system, adaptive estimation technique is introduced into the closed loop system in order to compensate the lumped disturbance term. More specifically, the designed controller utilizes \"prescribed performance bounds\" method, and therefore guarantees the transient performance of tracking errors, even in the presence of the lumped disturbance. Adaptive compensation algorithms under the proposed closed loop system structure are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability analysis such that the attitude tracking error converge to a small neighborhood of equilibrium point. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Copyright Â© 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the hierarchical control principle, the quadrotor dynamics is decomposed into translational and rotational subsystems to facilitate the back-stepping control design. With given model information incorporated into observer design, a high-order extended state observer (ESO) that relies only on position measurements is developed to estimate the remaining unmeasurable states and the lumped disturbances in rotational subsystem simultaneously. To overcome the problem of \"explosion of complexity\" in the back-stepping design, the sigmoid tracking differentiator (STD) is introduced to compute the derivative of virtual control laws. The advantage is that the proposed controller via output-feedback scheme not only can ensure good tracking performance using very limited information of quadrotors, but also has the ability of handling the undesired uncertainties. The stability analysis is established using the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in achieving a guaranteed tracking performance with respect to an 8-shaped reference trajectory.\n\nRencontres avec Philippe Soupault\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLance, Alain\n\n2017-01-01\n\nJâai dÃ©couvert Philippe Soupault en Ã©coutant, vers la fin des annÃ©es cinquante, ses Ã©missions radiophoniques sur la poÃ©sie, lâune sâappelait PoÃ¨tes Ã vos luths, lâautre PoÃ¨tes oubliÃ©s, amis inconnus.

The Unmanned Flights via Quad-rotors are built because multi-rotor dynamics are an important starting point and fair analog for space craft control systems and they make good terrestrial development platforms for various aspects of control for space crafts. The project is being conducted to see what the thrust response is going to be when a pulse width modulation command is sent to the control system since the quad-rotors are PWM controlled. A simulation environment in constructed so that one can quickly iterate and test different designs such as control systems, PID control vs. LDR control, and state estimation. Using two DIY Quad Kits, APM 2.6, testing apparatus (called a data acquisition system) to test the quad-rotors, and a simulation program such as Simulink, two quad-rotors are built and controlled via a simulation program, which is designed to be as realistic as possible and not idealistic. Due to the quad-rotors not being completely built nor ready for testing, there are no results or conclusions to report.\n\nAdaptive control of a quadrotor aerial vehicle with input constraints and uncertain parameters\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTran, Trong-Toan; Ge, Shuzhi Sam; He, Wei\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this paper, we address the problem of adaptive bounded control for the trajectory tracking of a Quadrotor Aerial Vehicle (QAV) while the input saturations and uncertain parameters with the known bounds are simultaneously taken into account. First, to deal with the underactuated property of the QAV model, we decouple and construct the QAV model as a cascaded structure which consists of two fully actuated subsystems. Second, to handle the input constraints and uncertain parameters, we use a combination of the smooth saturation function and smooth projection operator in the control design. Third, to ensure the stability of the overall system of the QAV, we develop the technique for the cascaded system in the presence of both the input constraints and uncertain parameters. Finally, the region of stability of the closed-loop system is constructed explicitly, and our design ensures the asymptotic convergence of the tracking errors to the origin. The simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nPhilipp van den Bossche â Sac. Caes. Mai.

Andrew\n\n2016-05-01\n\nMany mechanical and electrical systems have utilized the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control strategy. The concept of PID control is a classical approach but it is easy to implement and yields a very good tracking performance. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are currently experiencing a significant growth in popularity. Due to the advantages of PID controllers, UAVs are implementing PID controllers for improved stability and performance. An important consideration for the system is the selection of PID gain values in order to achieve a safe flight and successful mission. There are a number of different algorithms that can be used for real-time tuning of gains. This paper presents two algorithms for gain tuning, and are based on the method of steepest descent and Newton's minimization of an objective function. This paper compares the results of applying these two gain tuning algorithms in conjunction with a PD controller on a quadrotor system.\n\nPartial study of quadrotor based on quaternions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJi, Xiang\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this paper, the attitude calculation of quadrotor is studied, and the attitude angle of quaternions and the method of using IIR low pass filter to filter the high frequency noise are proposed. First of all, this paper puts forward the characteristics of quadrotor more flexible than other aircraft. The flexible steering mode of quadrotor is classified into three categories. Starting from reality, this paper proposes an algorithm to transform the value of acceleration sensor to pose angle, which can greatly reduce the amount of computation and is the theoretical basis for real-time attitude calculation of aircraft. When introducing the number of quaternion, this article starts from the theoretical model and first introduces the conceptual meaning of the number of quaternion. In this model, the aircraft's own coordinate axis and the geographical axis are regarded as two rigid bodies, and they have three coordinate axes that are orthogonal to each other. When the steering operation is involved, the corresponding acceleration is generated. By using the quaternion multiplicative formula mentioned in this paper, the change of attitude angle can be obtained. n reality, in order to ensure the accuracy of the output attitude angle. More accurate input variables are often needed, and the IIR low pass filter is introduced in this way. In this paper, a nine order IIR filter is designed according to the actual situation, and its spectrum characteristics are obtained by simulation software. After mixing the original signal generated by propeller's high frequency noise, it outputs clean signals through filter, all of which are intuitively reflected by three spectrum images. After giving some practical solutions, this paper looks forward to the prospect of the aircraft.\n\nUnique Two-Way Field Probe Concept Utilizing a Geodesic Sphere and Quad-Rotor\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-03-26\n\nencompass the quad-rotor.

However, manual tuning of these controllers is tedious and often leads to poor performance. The conventional Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N method of PID tuning was done experimentally enables easy identification stable PID parameters in a short time, but is accompanied by overshoot, high steady-state error, and large rise time. Therefore, in this study, the modern heuristics approach of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO was employed to enhance the capabilities of the conventional Z-N technique. PSO with the constriction coefficient method experimentally demonstrated the ability to efficiently and effectively identify optimal PID controller parameters for attitude stabilization of a quadrotor.\n\nReview: Joschka Philipps, Ambivalent Rage: Youth Gangs and Urban Protest in Conakry, Guinea (2013)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nIneke van Kessel; Afrika-Studiecentrum Leiden\n\n2014-01-01\n\nReview of the Monograph:Joschka Philipps, Ambivalent Rage: Youth Gangs and Urban Protest in Conakry, Guinea, Paris: LâHarmattan, 2013, ISBN 978-2-343-01577-4, 238 pp. Besprechung der Monographie:Joschka Philipps, Ambivalent Rage: Youth Gangs and Urban Protest in Conakry, Guinea, Paris: LâHarmattan, 2013, ISBN 978-2-343-01577-4, 238 Seiten\n\nPhilippe Starck : Disainerist popstaariks.

Both of the hardware and software platforms are developed by Quanser Company, Canada. The proposed tracking and positioning algorithm could be divided into several stages. First, a tracker is developed based on an optical flow method to track the target; and then, in order to improve the reliability of tracking algorithm and also help in retrieving the lost target, a cascade target detector is developed; meanwhile, a model updated scheme aiming at some possible errors in tracking and detecting process is presented based on Positive-Negative (P-N learning system; at last, a monocular visual positioning system is designed based on the corresponding navigation message. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed flight control system is verified by both simulation and hardware-in-loop system results in several tracking flight tests.\n\nIsa Philippe Jourdan vÃµttis vastu Tallinna Toomkiriku autasu / Tiiu Pikkur\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nPikkur, Tiiu, 1947-\n\n2008-01-01\n\n5. oktoobril toimunud jumalateenistusel Tallinna Toomkirikus anti koguduse selle aasta kultuuripreemia laureaadile, Rooma-Katoliku Kririku Eesti apostellikule administraatorile piiskop Philippe Jourdanile Ã¼le Maarja medal\n\nArt historyâs history in Melbourne: Franz Philipp in correspondence with Arthur Boyd\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJaynie Anderson\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe article considers the Austrian born art historian Franz Philipp, who came to Australia and made his career at the University of Melbourne in the years after the Second World War.

Mundialmente conhecido por seus espetÃ¡culos e por sÃ©ries televisivas concebidas entre os anos 70 e 80, com o passar do tempo o seu trabalho como marionetista evoluiu para um tipo de teatro que o artista denomina como teatro visual. O teatro visual Ã© um conceito surgido na dÃ©cada de 80 na Europa e, no caso de Philippe Genty, Ã guisa de uma definiÃ§Ã£o prÃ©via desse termo, podemos afirmar que a marionete deixou de ser o principal elemento de seus espetÃ¡culos e que todos os elementos da encenaÃ§Ã£o, inclusive o elemento humano, passaram a contribuir significativamente para a construÃ§Ã£o das suas novas dramaturgias.

This thesis discusses the development of a hybrid air vehicle which seamlessly combines both flight capabilities: hover and high-speed forward flight. It is the quad-rotor biplane, which weighs 240 grams and consists of four propellers with wings arranged in a biplane configuration. The performance of the vehicle system was investigated in conditions representative of flight through a series of wind tunnel experiments. These studies provided an understanding of propeller-wing interaction effects and system trim analysis. This showed that the maximum speed of 11 m/s and a cruise speed of 4 m/s were achievable and that the cruise power is approximately one-third of the hover power. Free flight testing of the vehicle successfully highlighted its ability to achieve equilibrium transition flight. Key design parameters were experimentally investigated to understand their effect on overall performance. It was found that a trade-off between efficiency and compactness affects the final choice of the design. Design improvements have allowed for decreases in vehicle weight and ground footprint, while increasing structural soundness. Numerous vehicle designs, models, and flight tests have proven system scalability as well as versatility, including an upscaled model to be utilized in an extensive commercial package delivery system. Overall, the quad-rotor biplane is proven to be an efficient and effective multi-role vehicle.\n\nQuad Rotorcraft Control Vision-Based Hovering and Navigation\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGarcÃ­a Carrillo, Luis Rodolfo; Lozano, Rogelio; PÃ©gard, Claude\n\n2013-01-01\n\nQuad-Rotor Control develops original control methods for the navigation and hovering flight of an autonomous mini-quad-rotor robotic helicopter. These methods use an imaging system and a combination of inertial and altitude sensors to localize and guide the movement of the unmanned aerial vehicle relative to its immediate environment. The history, classification and applications of UAVs are introduced, followed by a description of modelling techniques for quad-rotors and the experimental platform itself. A control strategy for the improvement of attitude stabilization in quad-rotors is then proposed and tested in real-time experiments. The strategy, based on the use of low-cost components and with experimentally-established robustness, avoids drift in the UAVâs angular position by the addition of an internal control loop to each electronic speed controller ensuring that, during hovering flight, all four motors turn at almost the same speed. The quad-rotorâs Euler angles being very close to the origin, oth...\n\nDie gestaltes van Philipp Melanchthon se Spreukekommentaar\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJames Alfred Loader\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This article argues the following thesis: The distinctive characteristics of Philipp Melanchthonâs Explicatio Proverbiorum Salomonis (1525 and following years and the differences between the several editions or versions of it can only partly be explained by the origins of the book in Melanchthonâs teaching activities during the ferment at German universities in the course of the sixteenth century Reformation. Both the peculiarities of the commentary itself and the way several differing versions of it were tolerated alongside one another only become explicable when a theological consideration is brought into the equation. On the one hand this resides in the view of Holy Scripture shared by Melanchthon and Martin Luther, and on the other hand in the humanist notion of context that Melanchthonâs exegetical work had in common with that of John Calvin.\n\nTuning of PID Controllers for Quadcopter System using Cultural Exchange Imperialist Competitive Algorithm\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNizar Hadi Abbas\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Quadrotors are coming up as an attractive platform for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV research, due to the simplicity of their structure and maintenance, their ability to hover, and their vertical take-off and landing (VTOL capability. With the vast advancements in small-size sensors, actuators, and processors, researchers are now focusing on developing mini UAVâs to be used in both research and commercial applications. This work presents a detailed mathematical nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor which is formulated using the Newton-Euler method. Although the quadrotor is a 6 DOF under-actuated system, the derived rotational subsystem is fully actuated, while the translational subsystem is under-actuated. The derivation of the mathematical model was followed by the development of the controller to control the altitude, attitude, heading and position of the quadrotor in space, which is, based on the linear Proportional-Derivative- Integral (PID controller; thus, a simplified version of the model is obtained. The gains of the controllers will be tuned using optimization techniques to improve the system's dynamic response. The standard Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA was applied to tune the PID parameters and then it was compared to Cultural Exchange Imperialist Competitive algorithm (CEICA tuning, and the results show improvement in the proposed algorithm. The objective function results were enhanced by (23.91% in the CEICA compared with ICA.\n\nPerformance and Sizing Tool for Quadrotor Biplane Tailsitter UAS\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStrom, Eric\n\nThe Quadrotor-Biplane-Tailsitter (QBT) configuration is the basis for a mechanically simplistic rotorcraft capable of both long-range, high-speed cruise as well as hovering flight. This work presents the development and validation of a set of preliminary design tools built specifically for this aircraft to enable its further development, including: a QBT weight model, preliminary sizing framework, and vehicle analysis tools. The preliminary sizing tool presented here shows the advantage afforded by QBT designs in missions with aggressive cruise requirements, such as offshore wind turbine inspections, wherein transition from a quadcopter configuration to a QBT allows for a 5:1 trade of battery weight for wing weight. A 3D, unsteady panel method utilizing a nonlinear implementation of the Kutta-Joukowsky condition is also presented as a means of computing aerodynamic interference effects and, through the implementation of rotor, body, and wing geometry generators, is prepared for coupling with a comprehensive rotor analysis package.\n\nPhilipp Weselsky - profesor chemie vÃ­deÅskÃ© techniky z ÄeskomoravskÃ© vysoÄiny\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nJindra, JiÅÃ­\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 43, Ä. 4 (2010), s. 255-259 ISSN 0300-4414 Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z80630520 Keywords : Vienna Technical university 1854-1884 * tuition of analytical chemistry * Philipp Weselsky Subject RIV: AB - History\n\nQuadrotor helicopter for surface hydrological measurements\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPagano, C.; Tauro, F.; Porfiri, M.; Grimaldi, S.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nSurface hydrological measurements are typically performed through user-assisted and intrusive field methodologies which can be inadequate to monitor remote and extended areas. In this poster, we present the design and development of a quadrotor helicopter equipped with digital acquisition system and image calibration units for surface flow measurements. This custom-built aerial vehicle is engineered to be lightweight, low-cost, highly customizable, and stable to guarantee optimal image quality. Quadricopter stability guarantees minimal vibrations during image acquisition and, therefore, improved accuracy in flow velocity estimation through large scale particle image velocimetry algorithms or particle tracking procedures. Stability during the vehicle pitching and rolling is achieved by adopting large arm span and high-wing configurations. Further, the vehicle framework is composed of lightweight aluminum and durable carbon fiber for optimal resilience. The open source Ardupilot microcontroller is used for remote control of the quadricopter. The microcontroller includes an inertial measurement unit (IMU) equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes for stable flight through feedback control. The vehicle is powered by a 3 cell (11.1V) 3000 mAh Lithium-polymer battery. Electronic equipment and wiring are hosted into the hollow arms and on several carbon fiber platforms in the waterproof fuselage. Four 35A high-torque motors are supported at the far end of each arm with 10 Ã 4.7 inch propellers. Energy dissipation during landing is accomplished by four pivoting legs that, through the use of shock absorbers, prevent the impact energy from affecting the frame thus causing significant damage. The data capturing system consists of a GoPro Hero3 camera and in-house built camera gimbal and shock absorber damping device. The camera gimbal, hosted below the vehicle fuselage, is engineered to maintain the orthogonality of the camera axis with respect to the water surface by\n\nTrajectory optimization of multiple quad-rotor UAVs in collaborative assembling task\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChen Yongbo\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available A hierarchic optimization strategy based on the offline path planning process and online trajectory planning process is presented to solve the trajectory optimization problem of multiple quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles in the collaborative assembling task. Firstly, the path planning process is solved by a novel parallel intelligent optimization algorithm, the central force optimization-genetic algorithm (CFO-GA, which combines the central force optimization (CFO algorithm with the genetic algorithm (GA. Because of the immaturity of the CFO, the convergence analysis of the CFO is completed by the stability theory of the linear time-variant discrete-time systems. The results show that the parallel CFO-GA algorithm converges faster than the parallel CFO and the central force optimization-sequential quadratic programming (CFO-SQP algorithm. Then, the trajectory planning problem is established based on the path planning results. In order to limit the range of the attitude angle and guarantee the flight stability, the optimized object is changed from the ordinary six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body dynamic model to the dynamic model with an inner-loop attitude controller. The results show that the trajectory planning process can be solved by the mature SQP algorithm easily. Finally, the discussion and analysis of the real-time performance of the hierarchic optimization strategy are presented around the group number of the waypoints and the equal interval time.\n\nA Comparison of Closed-Loop Performance of Multirotor Configurations Using Non-Linear Dynamic Inversion Control\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMurray L. Ireland\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Multirotor is the umbrella term for the family of unmanned aircraft, which include the quadrotor, hexarotor and other vertical take-off and landing (VTOL aircraft that employ multiple main rotors for lift and control. Development and testing of novel multirotor designs has been aided by the proliferation of 3D printing and inexpensive flight controllers and components. Different multirotor configurations exhibit specific strengths, while presenting unique challenges with regards to design and control. This article highlights the primary differences between three multirotor platforms: a quadrotor; a fully-actuated hexarotor; and an octorotor. Each platform is modelled and then controlled using non-linear dynamic inversion. The differences in dynamics, control and performance are then discussed.\n\nPhilippe Bloch: Reducing distance between experiments and CERN\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWith its unique combination of several hundred staff members and thousands of users from around the world sharing offices and physics data and profiting from mutually beneficial exchanges of know-how and expertise, the PH Department is a good example of a successful worldwide collaboration, set up as it was to construct and run the Laboratoryâs physics experiments.

First, a mathematical model based on Euler-Lagrange formulation using a logarithmic mapping in the quaternion space is introduced. Then, a new methodology: a quaternion-passivity-based control is derived, which does not compute excessive and complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs for synthesizing the control law, making a significant advantage in comparison with other methodologies. Therefore, the control design to a system as the quad-rotor is easily solved by the proposed methodology. Another advantage is the possibility to stabilize quad-rotor full dynamics which may not be possible with classical PBC techniques. Experimental results and numerical simulations to validate our proposed scheme are presented.\n\nA debugging method of the Quadrotor UAV based on infrared thermal imaging\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCui, Guangjie; Hao, Qian; Yang, Jianguo; Chen, Lizhi; Hu, Hongkang; Zhang, Lijun\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHigh-performance UAV has been popular and in great need in recent years. The paper introduces a new method in debugging Quadrotor UAVs. Based on the infrared thermal technology and heat transfer theory, a UAV is under debugging above a hot-wire grid which is composed of 14 heated nichrome wires. And the air flow propelled by the rotating rotors has an influence on the temperature distribution of the hot-wire grid. An infrared thermal imager below observes the distribution and gets thermal images of the hot-wire grid. With the assistance of mathematic model and some experiments, the paper discusses the relationship between thermal images and the speed of rotors. By means of getting debugged UAVs into test, the standard information and thermal images can be acquired. The paper demonstrates that comparing to the standard thermal images, a UAV being debugging in the same test can draw some critical data directly or after interpolation. The results are shown in the paper and the advantages are discussed.\n\nPhilippe Descola, Par-delÃ nature et culture, Paris, Gallimard, 2006, 618 p.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStÃ©phane Callens\n\n2006-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Philippe Descola est connu pour ses travaux sur lâune des quatre tribus Jivaros, les Achuar.

It was read to the Society for Natural History in Paris on Dec. 11, 1794, soon after the fall of the Jacobin dictatorship. It is thus a political document, an appeal to the Revolutionary government to build asylums where the mentally ill could be decently treated. It is translated here for the first time. Philippe Pinel (1745-1826) served as \"physician of the infirmaries\" at BicÃªtre, the public hospice for men near Paris, from 1793 to 1795. In the \"Memoir on Madness\" he explains his \"psychologic treatment,\" the principles of the humane method that made him the founder of psychiatry in France. Pinel states that mental illness is often curable. To arrive at a diagnosis, the physician must carefully observe a patient's behavior, interview him, listen carefully, and take notes. He must understand the natural history of the disease and the precipitating event and write an accurate case history. Diagnosis and prognosis can then be made. Periodic patterns of mental illness can be helpful for therapy. Usually only one faculty is affected. Patients with delusions may be malicious or murderous. They may have to be restrained; it was Pinel's assistant, Jean Baptiste Pussin, who removed the chains from the insane men at BicÃªtre Hospice in 1797 and replaced them with strait-jackets. Pinel followed suit at the SalpÃªtriÃ¨re, the public hospice for women, 3 years later. Pinel here states that one must \"dominate agitated madmen while respecting human rights.\"\n\nJean-Philippe Costes, Les subversifs hollywoodiens.
