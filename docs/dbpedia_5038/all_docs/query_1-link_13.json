        "text": "Low-cost nonlinear optics experiment for undergraduate instructional laboratory and lecture demonstration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTurchiello, Rozane de F.; Pereira, Luiz A. A.; GÃ³mez, Sergio L.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis paper presents a simple and affordable experiment on the thermal lens effect, suitable for an undergraduate educational laboratory or as a tabletop demonstration in a lecture on nonlinear optics. Such an experiment exploits the formation of a lens in an absorbing medium illuminated by a laser beam with a Gaussian intensity profile. As an absorber, we use a commercial soy sauce, which exhibits a strong thermal lensing effect. Additionally, we show how to measure the radius of a Gaussian beam using the knife-edge method, and how to estimate the focal length of the induced thermal lens.\n\nDevelopment of Laboratory Seismic Exploration Experiment for Education and Demonstration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKuwano, O.; Nakanishi, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe developed a laboratory experiment to simulate a seismic refraction survey for educational purposes. The experiment is tabletop scaled experiment using the soft hydrogel as an analogue material of a layered crust. So, we can conduct the seismic exploration experiment in a laboratory or a classroom. The softness and the transparency of the gel material enable us to observe the wave propagation with our naked eyes, using the photoelastic technique. By analyzing the waveforms obtained by the image analysis of the movie of the experiment, one can estimate the velocities and the structure of the gel specimen in the same way as an actual seismic survey. We report details of the practical course and the public outreach activities using the experiment.\n\nNulling interferometry for the darwin mission: laboratory demonstration experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOllivier, Marc; LÃ©ger, Alain; Sekulic, Predrag; LabÃ¨que, Alain; Michel, Guy\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe DARWIN mission is a project of the European Space Agency that should allow around 2012 the search for extrasolar planets and a spectral analysis of their potential atmosphere in order to evidence gases and particularly tracers of life. The principle of the instrument is based on the Bracewell nulling interferometer. It allows high angular resolution and high dynamic range. However, this concept, proposed more than 20 years ago, has never been experimentally demonstrated in the thermal infrared with high levels of extinction. We present here a laboratory monochromatic experiment dedicated to this goal. A theoretical and numerical approach of the question highlights a strong difficulty: the need for very clean and homogeneous wavefronts, in terms of intensity, phase and polarisation distribution. A classical interferometric approach appears to be insufficient to reach our goals. We have shown theoretically then numerically that this difficulty can be surpassed if we perform an optical filtering of the interfering beams. This technique allows us to decrease strongly the optical requirements and to view very high interferometric contrast measurements with commercial optical pieces. We present here a laboratory interferometer working at 10,6 microns, and implementing several techniques of optical filtering (pinholes and single-mode waveguides), its realisation, and its first promising results. We particularly present measurements that exhibit stable visibility levels better than 99,9% that is to say extinction levels better than 1000.\n\nA Graphical Simulation of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium for Use as an Undergraduate Laboratory Experiment and to Demonstrate the Concept of Mathematical Modeling.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWhitman, David L.; Terry, Ronald E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nDemonstrating petroleum engineering concepts in undergraduate laboratories often requires expensive and time-consuming experiments.

It consists of an array of 64 monolithic, calorimetric CdZnTe semiconductor detectors with a coplanar-grid design and a total mass of 380 g. It is used to investigate the experimental challenges faced when operating CdZnTe detectors in low-background mode, to identify potential background sources and to show the long-term stability of the detectors. The first data-taking period started in 2011 with a subset of the detectors, while the demonstrator was completed in November 2013. To date, more than 250 kg d of data have been collected. This paper describes the technical details of the experimental setup and the hardware components.\n\nExperiments To Demonstrate Chemical Process Safety Principles.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDorathy, Brian D.; Mooers, Jamisue A.; Warren, Matthew M.; Mich, Jennifer L.; Murhammer, David W.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nPoints out the need to educate undergraduate chemical engineering students on chemical process safety and introduces the content of a chemical process safety course offered at the University of Iowa.

Students who have never performed a technique must be guided through the process, which is often difficult to standardize across multiple lab sections. Visual demonstration of laboratory procedures is a key element in teaching pedagogy. The main goals of the study were to create videos explaining and demonstrating a variety of lab techniques that would serve as teaching tools for undergraduate and graduate lab courses and to assess the impact of these videos on student learning. Demonstrations of individual laboratory procedures were videotaped and then edited with iMovie. Narration for the videos was edited with Audacity. Undergraduate students were surveyed anonymously prior to and following screening to assess the impact of the videos on student lab performance by completion of two Participant Perception Indicator surveys. A total of 203 and 171 students completed the pre- and posttesting surveys, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed to compare student perceptions of knowledge of, confidence in, and experience with the lab techniques before and after viewing the videos. Eleven demonstrations were recorded. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of students reporting increased knowledge of, confidence in, and experience with the lab techniques after viewing the videos. Incorporation of instructional videos as prelaboratory exercises has the potential to standardize techniques and to promote successful experimental outcomes.\n\nIntegration of Video-Based Demonstrations to Prepare Students for the Organic Chemistry Laboratory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNadelson, Louis S.; Scaggs, Jonathan; Sheffield, Colin; McDougal, Owen M.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nConsistent, high-quality introductions to organic chemistry laboratory techniques effectively and efficiently support student learning in the organic chemistry laboratory. In this work, we developed and deployed a series of instructional videos to communicate core laboratory techniques and concepts. Using a quasi-experimental design, we tested the videos in five traditional laboratory experiments by integrating them with the standard pre-laboratory student preparation presentations and instructor demonstrations. We assessed the influence of the videos on student laboratory knowledge and performance, using sections of students who did not view the videos as the control. Our analysis of pre-quizzes revealed the control group had equivalent scores to the treatment group, while the post-quiz results show consistently greater learning gains for the treatment group. Additionally, the students who watched the videos as part of their pre-laboratory instruction completed their experiments in less time.\n\nLaboratory experiments from the toy store\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcclelland, H.

The first CSI flight experiment of the Naval Research Laboratory, the Low Power Atmospheric Compensation Experiment (LACE) dynamics experiment, has successfully measured vibrations of an orbiting satellite with a ground-based laser radar. The observations, made on January 7, 8 and 10, 1991, represent the first ever measurements of this type. In the tests, a narrowband heterodyne CO2 laser radar, operating at a wavelength of 10.6 microns, detected vibration induced differential-Doppler signatures of the LACE satellite. Power spectral densities of forced oscillations and modal frequencies and damping rates of free-damped vibrations were obtained and compared with finite element structural models of the LACE system. Another manifested flight experiment is the Advanced Controls Technology Experiment (ACTEX) designed to demonstrate active and passive damping with piezo-electric (PZT) sensors and actuators. This experiment was developed under the management of the Air Force Phillips Laboratory with integration of the experiment at NRL. It is to ride as a secondary, or 'piggyback,' experiment on a future Navy satellite.\n\nCSI flight experiment projects of the Naval Research Laboratory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFisher, Shalom\n\n1993-02-01\n\nThe Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is involved in an active program of CSI flight experiments.

The light source is passing through tiny holes drilled on the thin metal plate is used as the simulated stellar and its companions. Those diffracted light at the edge of the holes bears a similarity to the light from the bright stellar. Those images are evaginated about the optical axis after the maximum focal length of the first axicon lens. Then the evaginated images of have cut off using the motorized iris which means the suppressed the central stellar light preferentially. Various length between the holes which represent the angular distance are examined. The laboratory experimental results are shown that the axicon-lens coronagraph has feature of ability to achieve the smaller IWA than l/D and high-contrast direct imaging. The laboratory based axicon-lens coronagraph imaging support the symbolic computation results which has potential in direct imaging for finding exoplanet and various astrophysical activities.

Employing discrete-event simulation, we present a counterexample to John Bell's remarkable \"proof\" that any theory of physics, which is both Einstein-local and \"realistic\" (counterfactually definite), results in a strong upper bound to the correlations that are being measured in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments.

B.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIt would not be exaggerating to say that R. W. Wood was the most respected experimental optical physicist of his time. Thus the null result of his attempt to demonstrate the greenhouse effect by comparing temperature rise in illuminated cylinders with glass or rock salt windows has echoed down through the years in climate science discussions both on the professional and public levels1. Today the web is full of videos purporting to demonstrate the greenhouse effect, but careful examination shows that they simply demonstrate heating via absorption of IR or NIR light by CO2. These experiments miss that the greenhouse effect is a result of the temperature difference between the surface and the upper troposphere as a result of which radiation from greenhouse molecules slows as the level rises. The average distance a photon emitted from a vibrationally excited CO2 molecule is about 10 m at the surface, increasing with altitude until at about 8 km the mean free path allows for radiation to space. Increasing CO2 concentrations raises this level to a higher one, which is colder, and at which the rate of radiation to space decreases. Emitting the same amount of radiation to space as before requires heating the entire system including the surface. To model the greenhouse effect we have used a 22 L bulb with a capsule heater in the center. The temperature near the heater (the surface) or above it can be monitored using a thermocouple and the CO2 mixing ratio determined using a NDIR sensor. By controlling the CO2 concentration in the bulb, the mean free path of re-radiated photons from CO2 can be controlled so that it much smaller than the bulb's diameter. We have measure rises in temperature both near the heater and at a distance from it as CO2is introduced, demonstrating the greenhouse effect. 1. R.W.

Mitch\n\nHigh school science laboratory experiences are an accepted teaching practice across the nation despite a lack of research evidence to support them. The purpose of this study was to examine the perspective of students---stakeholders often ignored---on these experiences. Insight into the students' perspective was explored progressively using a grounded theory methodology. Field observations of science classrooms led to an open-ended survey of high school science students, garnering 665 responses. Twelve student interviews then focused on the data and questions evolving from the survey. The student perspective on laboratory experiences revealed varied information based on individual experience. Concurrent analysis of the data revealed that although most students like (348/665) or sometimes like (270/665) these experiences, some consistent factors yielded negative experiences and prompted suggestions for improvement. The category of responses that emerged as the core idea focused on student understanding of the experience. Students desire to understand the why do, the how to, and the what it means of laboratory experiences. Lacking any one of these, the experience loses educational value for them. This single recurring theme crossed the boundaries of age, level in school, gender, and even the student view of lab experiences as positive or negative. This study suggests reflection on the current laboratory activities in which science teachers engage their students. Is the activity appropriate (as opposed to being merely a favorite), does it encourage learning, does it fit, does it operate at the appropriate level of inquiry, and finally what can science teachers do to integrate these activities into the classroom curriculum more effectively? Simply stated, what can teachers do so that students understand what to do, what's the point, and how that point fits into what they are learning outside the laboratory?\n\nEmulation-Based Virtual Laboratories: A Low-Cost Alternative to Physical Experiments in Control Engineering Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGoodwin, G.

This laboratory makes use of oxidation/reduction chemistry to produce a product familiar to students. The result is a mixture rather than a compound, but the composition must be carefully measured to produce a sparkler that will stay lit and produce sparks. The dramatic reaction may be the most impressive and memorable experience that students encounter in the laboratory. Sparklers are formulated from iron, magnesium, and aluminum powders, plus potassium chlorate and barium nitrate held on thick iron wire by a starch paste. At elevated temperatures metal nitrates and chlorates decompose to produces gases, providing the necessary force to eject bits of powdered, burning metal into the air.\n\nStructural assembly demonstration experiment, phase 1\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAkin, David L.; Bowden, Mary L.; Miller, Rene H.\n\n1983-03-01\n\nThe goal of this phase of the structural assembly and demonstration experiment (SADE) program was to begin to define a shuttle flight experiment that would yield data to compare on-orbit assembly operations of large space structures with neutral buoyancy simulations. In addition, the experiment would be an early demonstration of structural hardware and human capabilities in extravehicular activity (EVA). The objectives of the MIT study, as listed in the statement of work, were: to provide support in establishing a baseline neutral buoyancy testing data base, to develop a correlation technique between neutral buoyancy test results and on-orbit operations, and to prepare the SADE experiment plan (MSFC-PLAN-913).\n\nWiki Laboratory Notebooks: Supporting Student Learning in Collaborative Inquiry-Based Laboratory Experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLawrie, Gwendolyn Angela; GrÃ¸ndahl, Lisbeth; Boman, Simon; Andrews, Trish\n\n2016-06-01\n\nRecent examples of high-impact teaching practices in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory that include course-based undergraduate research experiences and inquiry-based experiments require new approaches to assessing individual student learning outcomes. Instructors require tools and strategies that can provide them with insight into individual student contributions to collaborative group/teamwork throughout the processes of experimental design, data analysis, display and communication of their outcomes in relation to their research question(s). Traditional assessments in the form of laboratory notebooks or experimental reports provide limited insight into the processes of collaborative inquiry-based activities. A wiki environment offers a collaborative domain that can potentially support collaborative laboratory processes and scientific record keeping. In this study, the effectiveness of the wiki in supporting laboratory learning and assessment has been evaluated through analysis of the content and histories for three consenting, participating groups of students. The conversational framework has been applied to map the relationships between the instructor, tutor, students and laboratory activities. Analytics that have been applied to the wiki platform include: character counts, page views, edits, timelines and the extent and nature of the contribution by each student to the wiki. Student perceptions of both the role and the impact of the wiki on their experiences and processes have also been collected. Evidence has emerged from this study that the wiki environment has enhanced co-construction of understanding of both the experimental process and subsequent communication of outcomes and data. A number of features are identified to support success in the use of the wiki platform for laboratory notebooks.\n\nThe BDX experiment at Jefferson Laboratory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCelentano, Andrea\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe existence of MeV-GeV dark matter (DM) is theoretically well motivated but remarkably unexplored. The Beam Dump eXperiment (BDX) at Jefferson Laboratory aims to investigate this mass range. Dark matter particles will be detected trough scattering on a segmented, plastic scintillator detector placed downstream of the beam-dump at one of the high intensity JLab experimental Halls. The experiment will collect up to 1022 electrons-on-target (EOT) in a one-year period. For these conditions, BDX is sensitive to the DM-nucleon elastic scattering at the level of a thousand counts per year, and is only limited by cosmogenic backgrounds. The experiment is also sensitive to DM-electron elastic and inelastic scattering, at the level of 10 counts/year. The foreseen signal for these channels is an high-energy (> 100 MeV) electromagnetic shower, with almost no background. The experiment, has been presented in form of a Letter of Intent to the laboratory, receiving positive feedback, and is currently being designed.\n\nEffective Laboratory Experiences for Students with Disabilities: The Role of a Student Laboratory Assistant\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPence, Laura E.; Workman, Harry J.; Riecke, Pauline\n\n2003-03-01\n\nTwo separate experiences with students whose disabilities significantly limited the number of laboratory activities they could accomplish independently has given us a general experience base for determining successful strategies for accommodating students facing these situatiuons. For a student who had substantially limited physical mobility and for a student who had no visual ability, employing a student laboratory assistant allowed the students with disabilities to have a productive and positive laboratory experience. One of the priorities in these situations should be to avoid depersonalizing the student with a disability. Interactions with the instructor and with other students should focus on the disabled student rather than the student laboratory assistant who may be carrying out specific tasks. One of the most crucial aspects of a successful project is the selection of a laboratory assistant who has excellent interpersonal skills and who will add his or her creativity to that of the student with a disability to meet unforeseen challenges. Other considerations are discussed, such as the importance of advance notification that a disabled student has enrolled in a course as well as factors that should contribute to choosing an optimum laboratory station for each situation.\n\nTested Demonstrations.

However, college students are often skeptical about using their bare hands in this experiment because they learned in early science lessons that skin is not a reliable detector of heat transfer. Moreover, when the experiment is conducted in a school laboratory, it is often difficult for students to perceive the slight differences in heat transfer on the dull black and silvery aluminum leaves attached to their hands. Rather than replacing students' bare hands with such sophisticated apparatus as a data logger and temperature probe, I suggest using a simple (and delicious!) low-cost instrument, i.e., chocolate, which simply melts when it receives radiation.\n\nRadionuclide migration: laboratory experiments with isolated fractures\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRundberg, R.S.; Thompson, J.L.; Maestas, S.\n\nLaboratory experiments examining flow and element migration in rocks containing isolated fractures have been initiated at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Techniques are being developed to establish simple fracture flow systems which are appropriate to models using analytical solutions to the matrix diffusion-flow equations, such as those of I. Neretnieks [I. Neretnieks, Diffusion in the Rock Matrix: An Important Factor in Radionuclide Retardation? J. Geophys. Res. 85, 4379 (1980).] These experiments are intended to be intermediate steps toward larger scale field experiments where it may become more difficult to establish and control the parameters important to nuclide migration in fracturedmoreÂ Â» media. Laboratory experiments have been run on fractures ranging in size from 1 to 20 cm in length. The hydraulic flow in these fractures was studied to provide the effective apertures. The flows established in these fracture systems are similar to those in the granite fracture flow experiments of Witherspoon et al. [P.A. Witherspoon, J.S.Y. Wang, K. Iwai, and J.E. Gale, Validity of Cubic Law for Fluid Flow in a Deformable Rock Fracture, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory report LBL-9557 (October 1979).] Traced solutions containing {sup 85}Sr and {sup 137}Cs were flowed through fractures in Climax Stock granite and welded tuff (Bullfrog and Tram members, Yucca Mountain, Nevada Test Site). The results of the elutions through granite agree with the matrix diffusion calculations based on independent measurements of K/sub d/. The results of the elutions through tuff, however, agree only if the K/sub d/ values used in the calculations are lower than the K/sub d/ values measured using a batch technique. This trend has been previously observed in chromatographic column experiments with tuff. 5 figures, 3 tables.Â«Â less\n\nEffects of Various Dental Materials on Alkaline Phosphatase Extracted from Pulp: An Experiment for the Biochemistry Laboratory.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nThompson, Lorin R.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA laboratory experiment that demonstrates the effects of various dental materials on a representative enzyme from the pulp is outlined.

Science students, in particular chemistry students, must not only be made aware of these issues, but also be taught that chemistry (and science) can provide solutions to such real-life issues. To this end, a newly developed biochemistry laboratory experiment is described that guides students to learn about the applicability of peroxidase enzymes to degrade organic dyes (as model pollutants) in simulated waste water. In addition to showing how enzymes can potentially be used for waste water remediation, various factors than can affect enzyme-based reactions such as pH, temperature, concentration of substrates/enzymes, and denaturants can also be tested. This \"applied biotechnology\" experiment was successfully implemented in an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course to enhance students' learning of environmental issues as well important biochemistry concepts. Student survey confirmed that this laboratory experiment was successful in achieving the objectives of raising environmental awareness in students and illustrating the usefulness of chemistry in solving real-life problems. This experiment can be easily adopted in an introductory biochemistry laboratory course and taught as an inquiry-guided exercise.

Natural selection is increasingly being leveraged in laboratory settings for industrial and basic science applications. Despite increasing deployment, there are no standardized procedures available for designing and performing adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments. Thus, there is a need to optimize the experimental design, specifically for determining when to consider an experiment complete and for balancing outcomes with available resources (i.e., laboratory supplies, personnel, and time). To design and to better understand ALE experiments, a simulator, ALEsim, was developed, validated, and applied to the optimization of ALE experiments. The effects of various passage sizes were experimentally determined and subsequently evaluated with ALEsim, to explain differences in experimental outcomes. Furthermore, a beneficial mutation rate of 10 -6.9 to 10 -8.4 mutations per cell division was derived. A retrospective analysis of ALE experiments revealed that passage sizes typically employed in serial passage batch culture ALE experiments led to inefficient production and fixation of beneficial mutations. ALEsim and the results described here will aid in the design of ALE experiments to fit the exact needs of a project while taking into account the resources required and will lower the barriers to entry for this experimental technique. IMPORTANCE ALE is a widely used scientific technique to increase scientific understanding, as well as to create industrially relevant organisms.

We report on a strategy, begun in 1992, for allowing each student to understand fundamental scientific principles by interactively confronting astronomical and physical phenomena, through direct observation and by computer simulation. These experiments have evolved as :a) the quality and speed of the hardware has greatly increasedb) the corresponding hardware costs have decreasedc) the students have become computer and Internet literated) the importance of computationally and scientifically literate arts graduates in the workplace has increased.We present the current suite of laboratory experiments, and describe the nature, procedures, and goals in this two-semester laboratory for liberal arts majors at the Astro 101 university level.\n\nCircular dichroism spectroscopy: Enhancing a traditional undergraduate biochemistry laboratory experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nLewis, Russell L; Seal, Erin L; Lorts, Aimee R; Stewart, Amanda L\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe undergraduate biochemistry laboratory curriculum is designed to provide students with experience in protein isolation and purification protocols as well as various data analysis techniques, which enhance the biochemistry lecture course and give students a broad range of tools upon which to build in graduate level laboratories or once they begin their careers. One of the most common biochemistry protein purification experiments is the isolation and characterization of cytochrome c. Students across the country purify cytochrome c, lysozyme, or some other well-known protein to learn these common purification techniques. What this series of experiments lacks is the use of sophisticated instrumentation that is rarely available to undergraduate students. To give students a broader background in biochemical spectroscopy techniques, a new circular dichroism (CD) laboratory experiment was introduced into the biochemistry laboratory curriculum. This CD experiment provides students with a means of conceptualizing the secondary structure of their purified protein, and assessments indicate that students' understanding of the technique increased significantly. Students conducted this experiment with ease and in a short time frame, so this laboratory is conducive to merging with other data analysis techniques within a single laboratory period.

B.; Phillips, J. C.; Chojnicki, K. N.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nLaboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the dynamics of Vulcanian eruptions. A reservoir containing a mixture of water and methanol plus solid particles was pressurized and suddenly released via a rapid-release valve into a 2 ft by 2 ft by 4 ft plexiglass tank containing fresh water. Water and methanol created a light interstitial fluid to simulate buoyant volcanic gases in erupted mixtures. The duration of the subsequent experiments was not pre-determined, but instead was limited by the potential energy associated with the pressurized fluid, rather than by the volume of available fluid. Suspending liquid density was varied between 960 and 1000 kg m-3 by changing methanol concentrations from 5 to 20%. Particle size (4 & 45 microns) and concentration (1 to 5 vol%) were varied in order to change particle settling characteristics and control bulk mixture density. Variations in reservoir pressure and vent size allowed exploration of the controlling source parameters, buoyancy flux (Bo) and momentum flux (Mo). The velocity-height relationship of each experiment was documented by high-speed video, permitting classification of the laboratory flows, which ranged from long continuously accelerating jets, to starting plumes, to low-energy thermals, to collapsing fountains generating density currents. Field-documented Vulcanian explosions exhibit this same wide range of behavior (Self et al. 1979, Nature 277; Sparks & Wilson 1982, Geophys. J. R. astr. Soc. 69; Druitt et al. 2002, Geol. Soc. London, 21), demonstrating that flows obtained in the laboratory are relevant to natural systems. A generalized framework of results was defined as follows. Increasing Mo/Bo for small particles (4 microns; settling time > experiment duration) pushes the system from low-energy thermals toward high-energy, continuously accelerating jets; increasing Mo/Bo for large particles (>45 microns; settling time < experiment duration) pushes the system from a low collapsing fountain to a\n\nLaboratory demonstration of image reconstruction for coherent optical system of modular imaging collectors (COSMIC)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTraub, W.

This is an optical validation of previous theoretical and numerical simulations of the COSMIC telescope array (coherent optical system of modular imaging collectors). The present experiment utilizes 17 diffraction blurred exposures of a laboratory light source, as imaged by a lens covered by a narrow-slit aperture; the aperture is rotated 10 degrees between each exposure. The images are recorded in digitized form by a CCD camera, Fourier transformed, numerically filtered, and added; the sum is then filtered and inverse Fourier transformed to form the final image. The image reconstruction process is found to be stable with respect to uncertainties in values of all physical parameters such as effective wavelength, rotation angle, pointing jitter, and aperture shape. Future experiments will explore the effects of low counting rates, autoguiding on the image, various aperture configurations, and separated optics.\n\nNumerical modeling of laser-driven experiments aiming to demonstrate magnetic field amplification via turbulent dynamo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTzeferacos, P.; Rigby, A.; Bott, A.; Bell, A.

We have conceived experiments that aim to demonstrate and study the turbulent dynamo mechanism in the laboratory. Here, we describe the design of these experiments through simulation campaigns using FLASH, a highly capable radiation magnetohydrodynamics code that we have developed, and large-scale three-dimensional simulations on the Mira supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory. The simulation results indicate that the experimental platform may be capable of reaching a turbulent plasma state and determining the dynamo amplification.

Was the implementation of a laboratory automation system (LAS) in the Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory at Singapore General Hospital successful? There is no simple answer, so the following topics comparing and contrasting pre- and post-LAS have been explored: turnaround time (TAT), laboratory errors, and staff satisfaction. The benefits and limitations of LAS from the laboratory experience were also reviewed. The mean TAT for both stat and routine samples decreased post-LAS (30% and 13.4%, respectively). In the 90th percentile TAT chart, a 29% reduction was seen in the processing of stat samples on the LAS. However, no significant difference in the 90th percentile TAT was observed with routine samples. It was surprising to note that laboratory errors increased post-LAS. Considerable effort was needed to overcome the initial difficulties associated with adjusting to a new system, new software, and new working procedures. Although some of the known advantages and limitations of LAS have been validated, the claimed benefits such as improvements in TAT, laboratory errors, and staff morale were not evident in the initial months.\n\nScaled laboratory experiments explain the kink behaviour of the Crab Nebula jet\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi, C. K.; Tzeferacos, P.; Lamb, D.\n\nX-ray images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory show that the South-East jet in the Crab nebula changes direction every few years. This remarkable phenomenon is also observed in jets associated with pulsar wind nebulae and other astrophysical objects, and therefore is a fundamental feature of astrophysical jet evolution that needs to be understood. Theoretical modeling and numerical simulations have suggested that this phenomenon may be a consequence of magnetic fields (B) and current-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities taking place in the jet, but until now there has been no verification of this process in a controlled laboratory environment. Here we reportmoreÂ Â» the first such experiments, using scaled laboratory plasma jets generated by high-power lasers to model the Crab jet and monoenergetic-proton radiography to provide direct visualization and measurement of magnetic fields and their behavior. The toroidal magnetic field embedded in the supersonic jet triggered plasma instabilities and resulted in considerable deflections throughout the jet propagation, mimicking the kinks in the Crab jet. We also demonstrated that these kinks are stabilized by high jet velocity, consistent with the observation that instabilities alter the jet orientation but do not disrupt the overall jet structure. We successfully modeled these laboratory experiments with a validated three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation, which in conjunction with the experiments provide compelling evidence that we have an accurate model of the most important physics of magnetic fields and MHD instabilities in the observed, kinked jet in the Crab nebula.

Y.; Eastes, L. A.; Hester, E. T.; Widdowson, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe hyporheic zone is the surface water-groundwater interface surrounding the river's perimeter. Prior research demonstrates the ability of the hyporheic zone to attenuate pollutants when surface water cycles through reactive sediments (non-mixing-dependent reactions). However, the colocation of both surface and ground water within hyporheic sediments also allows mixing-dependent reactions that require mixing of reactants from these two water sources. Recent modeling studies show these mixing zones can be small under steady state homogeneous conditions, but do not validate those results in the laboratory or explore the range of hydrological characteristics that control the extent of mixing. Our objective was to simulate the mixing zone, quantify its thickness, and probe its hydrological controls using a \"mix\" of laboratory and numerical experiments. For the lab experiments, a hyporheic zone was simulated in a sand mesocosm, and a mixing-dependent abiotic reaction of sodium sulfite and dissolved oxygen was induced. Oxygen concentration response and oxygen consumption were visualized via planar optodes. Sulfate production by the mixing-dependent reaction was measured by fluid samples and a spectrophometer. Key hydrologic controls varied in the mesocosm included head gradient driving hyporheic exchange and hydraulic conductivity/heterogeneity. Results show a clear mixing area, sulfate production, and oxygen gradient. Mixing zone length (hyporheic flow cell size) and thickness both increase with the driving head gradient. For the numerical experiments, transient surface water boundary conditions were implemented together with heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity. Results indicate that both fluctuating boundary conditions and heterogeneity increase mixing-dependent reaction. The hyporheic zone is deemed an attenuation hotspot by multiple studies, but here we demonstrate its potential for mixing-dependent reactions and the influence of important hydrological\n\nNumerical modeling of laser-driven experiments aiming to demonstrate magnetic field amplification via turbulent dynamo\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nTzeferacos, Petros; Rigby, A.; Bott, A.; ...\n\n2017-03-22\n\nThe universe is permeated by magnetic fields, with strengths ranging from a femtogauss in the voids between the filaments of galaxy clusters to several teragauss in black holes and neutron stars.

In order to meet this need, significant upgrades were made to NASA Glenn Research Center s Rotordynamics Laboratory and a series of tests were conducted on simulated turbine engine disks as a means of demonstrating potential crack-detection techniques. The Rotordynamics Laboratory consists of a high-precision spin rig that can rotate subscale engine disks at speeds up to 12,000 rpm. The crack-detection experiment involved introducing a notch on a subscale engine disk and measuring its vibration response using externally mounted blade-tip-clearance sensors as the disk was operated at speeds up to 12 000 rpm. Testing was accomplished on both a clean baseline disk and a disk with an artificial crack: a 50.8-mm- (2-in.-) long introduced notch. The disk s vibration responses were compared and evaluated against theoretical models to investigate how successful the technique was in detecting cracks. This paper presents the capabilities of the Rotordynamics Laboratory, the baseline theory and experimental setup for the crack-detection experiments, and the associated results from the latest test campaign.\n\nA Simple Photochemical Experiment for the Advanced Laboratory.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRosenfeld, Stuart M.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nDescribes an experiment to provide students with: (1) an introduction to photochemical techniques and theory; (2) an experience with semimicro techniques; (3) an application of carbon-14 nuclear magnetic resonance; and (4) a laboratory with some qualities of a genuine experiment.

To improve the performance of future coronagraphs and to stretch their inner fields of view toward the solar limb, the new concept of coronagraphs in formation flight has been introduced in the scientific debate. Solar coronagraphs in formation flight require several mechanical and technological constraints to be met, mainly due to the large dimension of the occulter and to the spacecraft's reciprocal alignment. The occulter edge requires special attention to minimize diffraction while being compatible with the handling and integrating of large delicate space components. Moreover, it is practically impossible to set up a full-scale model for laboratory tests. This article describes the design and laboratory tests on a demonstrator for a coronagraph to be operated in formation flight. The demonstrator is based on the principle of the linear edge, thus the presented results cannot be directly extrapolated to the case of the flying circular occulter. Nevertheless, we are able to confirm the results of other authors investigating on smaller coronagraphs and provide further information on the geometry and tolerances of the optimization system. The described work is one of the results of the ESA STARTIGER program on formation flying coronagraphs [\"The STARTIGER's demonstrators: toward a new generation of formation flying solar coronagraphs,\" in 2010 International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO) (2010), paper 39].\n\nDefinition of experiments and instruments for a communication/navigation research laboratory.
