        "text": "Océano Club de Kerkennah (Arabic: نادي محيط قرقنة‎), often referred to as OCK or mainly El-Mouhit is a Tunisian football team from the archipelago of Kerkennah, Tunisia. The club was founded in 1963. They play in blue and white colors.\n\nL`OCK have also small volleyball, kung-fu, judo and swimming sections, and formerly handball, basketball and pétanque sections.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 History of the Logo\n\n3 Jersey of OCK\n\n4 Stadiums in Sfax\n\n4.1 Stadium Farhat Hached in Kerkennah\n\n5 Supporters\n\n6 Achievements\n\n6.1 Tunisian President Cup\n\n6.2 Championship of Tunisia\n\n7 Sfax Derbies\n\n8 Derbies Between Two Islands\n\n9 Derby of Kerkennah\n\n10 Squad\n\n10.1 2009–2010\n\n11 Former Personal\n\n11.1 Presidents\n\n11.2 Coaches\n\n11.3 Former Players\n\n12 References\n\n13 External links\n\nHistory\n\nOn October 1964 l`OCK plays for the first time in the third division. They were successful and placed first at the end of the season, going undefeated with 7 wins, one draw and no losses. But in the final playoff match for promotion to the Second Division L`OCK were defeated by Club Olympique de Médenine.\n\nAt 1969 a handball and a pétanque section were founded. These sections of the sports club are now defunct.\n\nAfter five years in the Regional League III (region of Sfax), where they won the regional championship each time but failed the playoffs, the club eventually joined the second division in 1970 to spend nine years before joining the elite in the 1978/1979 season. L`OCK spent 13 seasons in the first division (professional level). Known for their ultra-defensive playing style, they clung on for five years but eventually were relegated. During the 1990s, considered by many to be the glory years of the club, L`OCK 'clung like an octopus' (as the other clubs of League I described).\n\nOn the season 1990 – 1991 l`OCK promoted in the First division.On 1991 – 1992 the club has the best budget of his history and the 6th best budget of all first division clubs after Espérance Sportive de Tunis ,Club Africain ,Étoile Sportive du Sahel , Club Sportif Sfaxien and Stade Tunisien with 645 000 00 Tunisian Dinar.\n\nA year later, they came back with a new style that often led them to great success. After mixed fortunes, the club were relegated from League I for the last time in 1997 to the League II. After two seasons (1997–1998 and 1998–1999) in League II, they were relegated again. Since the season 1999–2000, L`OCK have played in League III, where they been fighting for survival for a number of years. The club has struggled with constant coach changes to achieve the consistency required for promotion back to League II.\n\nAt the season 2009–2010 L`OCK was very near to go back to Tunisian League II after an good first half of the season.But after an bad second half of the season they became onnl the 6th on the final table of tunisian League III.This season was the first season after their come back last season in which L`OCK plays complete at the Farhat Hached Stadium in Remla, Kerkennah.\n\nHistory of the Logo\n\nThe first logo in the history of OCK.\n\nThis logo is used by the Tunisian medias and also on some jerseys.\n\nLogo during the beginning of the 2000s in Arabic language and with red dolphin.\n\nLogo during the beginning of the 2000s in French language and with orange dolphin.\n\nCurrent logo of OCK in French language.\n\nCurrent logo of OCK in Arabic language.\n\nJersey of OCK\n\nStadiums in Sfax\n\nL`OCK has played in the City El Habib Stadium in recent years, and occasionally also plays in the 2 Mars Stadium in Sfax.\n\nThe important games (against professional teams) are played in the Stade Taïeb Mhiri of Sfax.\n\nStadium Farhat Hached in Kerkennah\n\nIn 2001–02, L`OCK played its first season at Farhat Hached Stadium in Remla Kerkennah. But after many problems for the security detail of Kerkennah Stadium, the team had to stop playing there and went back to the stadiums of Sfax.\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, L`OCK moved back to the more modernised Farhat Hached Stadium. The stadium was modernised with a new security force, new third generation grass, new floodlights and new player banks. The inauguration game of the new stadium on 15 March 2009 was won by L`OCK against Club Olympique de Médenine, 2–1.\n\nBefore L`OCK played in Farhat Hached Stadium, it was mainly used by the second football team of Kerkennah, Kerkennah Sports (KS).\n\nPlatform in 2009 after modernize the Stadium.\n\nThe new grass in 2009 after modernize the Stadium.\n\nView out of the player tunnel in 2009 after modernize the Stadium.\n\nSupporters\n\nL`Association Supporters OCK was the first supporter group of OCK. This group founded in the 1990s, when OCK was enjoying its greatest success, participating in League I.\n\nAlso, the traditional Kerkennien folklore group often supports the team with tbal and Zokra.\n\nAchievements\n\nIt is at the amateur levels of Tunisian football that OCK have obtained their greatest achievements:\n\nTunisian Ligue Professionnelle 2: 4\n\n1990/91\n\nWinner of (South Pole) : 1977/78, 1984/85, 1995/96\n\nLeague cup of Amateurs: (2)\n\n2004/05[1] 2005/06[2]\n\nSemi-Finalist – 2006/07[3]\n\nFair Play Cup Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 : 1\n\n1991/92\n\nFair Play Cup Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 2 : 1\n\n1990/91\n\nEspoirs Cup (U 21): 1\n\n1987/88\n\nCadets A Cup: 1\n\n1995/96\n\nTunisian President Cup\n\nSemi-Finals: 1\n\n1991/92 – OCK 0–1 Stade Tunisien\n\nQuarter-Finals: 5\n\n1982/83 – Stade Tunisien 3–0 OCK\n\n1989/90 – Stade Tunisien 1–0 OCK\n\n1991/92 – OCK 1–0 Club Athlétique Bizertin\n\n2005/06 – OCK 0–1 Club Africain\n\n2006/07 – OCK 2–3 (aet) Club Athlétique Bizertin\n\nSecond round: 1\n\n2004/05 OCK 0–2 Club Athlétique Bizertin\n\nChampionship of Tunisia\n\nSeason Years Final Standing Points Top Goal Scorer Movement 1 1978–79 11 49 Mohamed Jemal (3) 2 1979–80 9 49 Khaled Msakni (5) 3 1980–81 12 45 Khaled Msakni (10) 4 1981–82 12 49 Khaled Msakni (6) 5 1982–83 13 44 onze joueurs (1) Relegated to the 2nd Division 6 1985–86 12 50 Ezzeddine Hadj Sassi (7) 7 1986–87 12 52 Ezzeddine Hadj Sassi (11) Relegated to the 2nd Division 8 1988–89 14 39 Ezzeddine Hadj Sassi et Imed Trabelsi (3) Relegated to the 2nd Division 9 1991–92 7 59 Amor Ben Tahar (14) 10 1992–93 6 24 Amor Ben Tahar (13) 11 1993–94 10 21 Amor Ben Tahar (12) 12 1994–95 13 18 Amor Ben Tahar (7) Relegated to the 2nd Division 13 1996–97 13 14 Mourad Ouni (4) Relegated to the 2nd Division\n\nL'OCK has played on many occasions against the largest and most important teams of Tunisian football. Their playing record against these teams is as follows:\n\nClub Games Wins Losses Draws AS Kasserine 4 2 1 1 Avenir Sportif de La Marsa 26 5 9 12 Association Mégrine Sportive 2 1 0 1 Club Africain 26 3 18 5 Club Athlétique Bizertin 26 9 16 1 Club Olympique des Transports 12 1 6 5 Club Sportif de Hammam-Lif 22 5 11 6 CS Korba 2 2 0 0 Club Sportif de Menzel Bouzelfa 2 1 1 0 Club Sportif Sfaxien 26 3 13 10 Espérance Sportive de Tunis 26 5 14 7 Espérance Sportive de Zarzis 6 2 1 3 ES Beni-Khalled 2 1 0 1 Étoile Sportive du Sahel 26 4 13 9 Jeunesse Sportive Kairouanaise 26 6 11 9 El Makarem de Mahdia 2 0 1 1 Olympique Béja 16 4 9 3 Olympique du Kef 10 4 4 2 Sfax Railways Sports 20 2 4 14 Stade Gabèsien 6 2 2 2 Stade Sportif Sfaxien 2 1 0 1 Stade Tunisien 26 7 9 10 Stade Soussien 2 1 1 0 STIA Sousse 2 1 1 0 Union Sportive Monastir 18 6 7 5\n\nSfax Derbies\n\nAll games of l`OCK against Club Sportif Sfaxien, Sfax Railways Sports, Stade Sportif Sfaxien and Club Ahly Sfaxien are considered derbies of the Sfax region. Because Kerkennah is an archipelago of Sfax, there is a big rivalry between these teams. Another major rivalry was between l`OCK and Club Sportif Sfaxien during the 1990s (the glory years of l`OCK).\n\nDerbies Between Two Islands\n\nThe games of l`OCK against Espoir Sportif de Jerba Midoun, AS Djerba (Houmt Souk) and Union Sportive d`Ajim are the only games between two islands in Tunsian football, because the other two smaller islands of Tunisia are not represented by teams in the national football competition.\n\nDerby of Kerkennah\n\nL`OCK also takes part in the 'Derby of Kerkennah' against Kerkennah Sports (KS), but mainly on friendly level. There is a good atmosphere between the two clubs and no rivalry.\n\nSquad\n\n2009–2010\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules.
