During the present testing times for the whole of humanity, Dimoria College family is determined to stand tall and united for overcoming the challenges thrown by COVID 19 in the arena of Higher Education in Assam. We believe so because every crisis is pregnant with immense possibilities and opportunities as beautifully expressed by the famous lyric of Dr. Bhupen Hazarika,Nothing echoes this more than Dimoria College which has already proved against all odds that a rural college can be designated as a college with potential for excellence\", accredited with grade \"A\" by NAAC and so on, We are fully committed to the vision of the founding fathers of our college who focussed on character building of the students to be competent citizens who can be agents of social change by way of comprehensive socio-economic upliftment of the poor, backward and disadvantaged people of Dimoria in particular and Assam in general. In view of the current pandemic situation, the whole teaching-leatning process is going through a pardigm shift challenging us to adopt the virtual/online means so that the process doesn't get interrupted. All the stakeholders in Higher Education, especially the students and the teachers need to rise to the occasion to accept this challenge and turn it into a beautiful opportunity for augmenting the whole process of teaching-learning.\n\nReaching our institutional goals of alround excellence in academic, co-curricular and socio-economic spheres with a value based approach is a collective journey for every member of the college family. Focussing on the principles of equality, equity and excellence, we intend to embrace and encapsulate the goodness of the whole universe in the DNA of Dimoria College. We welcome you all to Dimoria College to join our hands in achieving the aforesaid goals with a free and fresh mind in a clean and green campus free from any kind of discrimination and injustice! Long live Dimoria College!"
