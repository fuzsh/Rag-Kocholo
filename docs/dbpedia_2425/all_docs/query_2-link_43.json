It depends on fulfilment of eligibility conditions and intake capacity of the department/colleges for the concerned Course.\n\nAll are advised to keep visiting this website for any update regarding the Admission process from time to time.\n\nThe University is not responsible for any unwanted technical failure which may disturb the admission process, either at the University end, or from the studentâ€™s end.\n\nAll prospective applicants can apply for one Traditional Course and a maximum of Two Interdisciplinary Course. It is extremely IMPORTANT that an applicant should apply to all three courses (if any) from one Login ID and the registration fee has to be paid together for all the three courses.

In such cases, the Registration Fee paid WILL NOT be refunded."
