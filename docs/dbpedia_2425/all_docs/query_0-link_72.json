        "text": "Dr. Lalit Chandra Rabha\n\nPrincipal\n\nFrom The Principal's Desk\n\nMy dear students,\n\nOn behalf of Dudhnoi College family, I feel proud to welcome you to Dudhnoi College, the premier higher education in the Goalpara District. This institution of higher education was established on 4th August, 1972 with P.U. Course in Arts stream. Latter on Science and Commerce streams were added in the 1985 and 2015 respectively. I offer my sincere tribute to the noble persons of the locality without whose vision and mission this institution would not have seen the light of the day.\n\nThanks to the honourable president and members of the Governing Body, teaching and nonÂ­ teaching staff of the college who have given quality and consistency through their efforts. Their hard work and sacrifices have helped in shaping the lives of students of this college. After joining the college on 10th July, 2018 as Principal I have been trying my level best to do better in the field of teaching, learning, research and other corporate activities.\n\nI hope like other educational institution, Dudhnoi College will also be a greater partner in building up the society and nation.\n\nThanking you"
