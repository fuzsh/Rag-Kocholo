His career achievements include winning the Critérium International a record-tying 5 times and a number of one-week stage races, as well as two Tour de France stage victories. In September 2014, he set a new hour record.\n\nGiro d'Italia cyclists · 1,981T\n\nGerman male cyclists · 582T\n\nGerman Giro d'Italia stage winners · 14T\n\nErik Zabel German racing cyclist\n\n0 0\n\nrank #2 ·\n\nErik Zabel (born 7 July 1970) is a German former professional road bicycle racer who last raced with Milram.
