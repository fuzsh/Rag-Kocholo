        "text": "Three cyclists set world indoor records today and three swimmers beat medal- winning times at the Los Angeles Olympics as Soviet-bloc athletes continued to dominate the Friendship '84 games organized by the Soviet Union.\n\nBernd Dittert of East Germany set a world record of 4 minutes 36.47 seconds in qualifying for the quarterfinals of the 4,000-meter individual pursuit cycling race.\n\nAlso bettering the previous mark of 4:37.68, set in Moscow last year by Viktor Kupovets of the Soviet Union, was Ryszard Davidovicz of Poland. He was timed in 4:36.97 before Dittert delighted a capacity crowd of 6,000 at the Olympic Sports Cycling Center in the Moscow suburb of Krylatskoye.\n\nThe world record in the 4,000-meter individual pursuit can only be set in qualifying, when riders perform individually against the clock. Thereafter, they race against each other, with two cyclists circling the track together. The event continues on Monday.\n\nIn the 500-meter men's cycle race, Michael Huebner of East Germany clocked 26.479 seconds, beating the previous best of 27.469 set by Aleksandr Panfilov of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the women's 1,000-meter event, Erika Salumyae of the Soviet Union set a world mark of 1:08.24, beating her previous best of 1:09.07.\n\nThe Soviet Union and East Germany each won two events as the swimming competition got under way at Moscow's Olympic pool in the competitions organized for athletes from the 14 nations that did not attend the Los Angeles Games, as well as those from about 30 other nations.\n\nIn the women's 100-meter freestyle, Kristin Otto and Birgit Meineke both were faster than the 55.92 seconds clocked by Carrie Steinseifer and Nancy Hogshead of the United States, who tied for the Olympic gold medal. Miss Otto was timed in 55.75 and Miss Meineke in 55.79.\n\nThe women's 400-meter individual medley was won by the Soviet champion, Yelina Dendeberova, in 4:43.78, which would have given her a silver at Los Angeles behind Tracy Caulkins of the United States.\n\nMoses Withdraws\n\nHANOVER, West Germany, Aug. 19 (AP) - Edwin Moses, the world- record holder, suffered a dizzy spell and left the track shortly before his 400-meter hurdles race today.\n\nEvelyn Ashford of the United States, who won Olympic gold at Los Angeles, also backed out of competition in the women's 100 meters because of a pulled muscle. Officials said she had injured it at a meet Friday.\n\nOfficials said Moses was suffering from intestinal flu, perhaps because of difficulty adjusting to the climate and time change.\n\nThe absence of Moses allowed West Germany's Harald Schmid, the last man to beat him, to win the 400-meter hurdles in 49.63 seconds."
