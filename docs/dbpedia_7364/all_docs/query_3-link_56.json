One Biondi's Disney Ad Violation of Olympic Commercialism Ban THE ASSOCIATED PRESS SEOUL, South Korea Disney World won't be allowed to use a poolside commercial made by U.S. swimmer Matt Biondi immediately after he won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle, the Orlando Sentinel has reported today. Biondi had agreed to do the two-line commercial endorsement for $50,000 as he emerged from the Olympic pool after winning his first individual gold medal .\n\nThe plan remained on hold after he managed only a bronze and a silver in his first two events, but he did the endorsement after he won the 100 free Wednesday night. However, an East German swimming official complained, according to Larry Cirillo, in charge of swimming coverage for NBC, which taped the bit for Disney. \"We already had approval from FINA, the international swimming federation,\" Cirillo told the Sentinel. Robert Helmick, president of FINA and the U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee, said that the poolside taping had never been approved .\n\n\"We can't allow that,\" he said. \"NBC has given us a letter of assurance the tape won't be aired. We have put out a general directive that no commercials will be allowed within the competition venues. As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.\" Other U.S. stars also have reached similar agreements to endorse Disneyland Girl ASSOCIATED PRESS America's Edwin Moses, right, pulls ahead of Allan Ince of Barbados during heat competition in the 400-meter hurdles .\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE D1 Canada, bolted from the blocks, then coasted home in 10.37 to win his first heat. Johnson, whose world mark is 9.83, was third in his second heat, again pulling up short of the finish line. Lewis later complained that the starter had too quick a trigger finger, which may favor Johnson, who is known for his fast starts. Joyner-Kersee, world record-holder and 1987 world champion, charged over the 100-meter high hurdles in 12.69 seconds, an Olympic record, in the first of seven events making up the heptathlon. After six days of Games, the medal standings looked like this: Soviet Union 29 medals, 15 gold; East Germany 20, 6 gold; United States 13, 5 gold .\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team, which played China late Thursday, revealed that both J.R. Reid and Stacey Augmon sustained minor foot injuries against Brazil on Wednesday. Coach John Thompson said either could play, but \"it would not be smart to play them.\" The U.S. team already has clinched a berth in the medal round .\n\nBiondi won the 100-meter freestyle for his fourth medal, and he is almost certain to win three more. Evans, slack-jawed and shaking her head when she saw the clock, cut a huge 1.6 seconds from her own world record in the 400-meter freestyle. \"I couldn't believe it,\" she said. \"I was just amazed.\" Amazing was an apt adjective, too, for the conduct of South Korean boxing officials, who attacked a referee and punched him after a close decision went against one of their boxers. Five Koreans, including a coach and a trainer, were banned from the Games for their part in the debacle .\n\n\"It was very disgraceful be havior,\" said Shin Hyon-ung, director general of the Seoul organizing committee's international press department. Escorted from the arena by police, referee Keith Walker of New Zealand immediately left for home. Through it all, the Korean boxer, Byun Jong-il, sat in defiance in his corner. In fact, -he sat there for 67 minutes while boxing went on in the other of two rings at the Chamshil Students' Gymnasium, and then they turned the lights out. Byun, yet another disappointment for a team falling far short of expectations, was suspended inde finitely from international competition .\n\nThe golds by Biondi and Evans, and a silver by Chris Jacobs in Biondi's event, gave a needed lift to a team considered one of the best in the world, yet a winner of only five of a possible 27 medals in nine events before Thursday. \"I told Chris, 'Good luck,\" Biondi said. \"We both wanted to do our best times. Along with Janet, we felt we could boost the team.\" Biondi, of Moraga, had a time of 48.63, missing his own world record by .21 seconds but breaking the Olympic mark of 49.04 he set earlier in qualifying heats. With four medals, he is on track to become the second man to win seven medals in a Summer Olympics .\n\nMark Spitz won seven in 1972, all gold. Jacobs, of Livingston, N.J., was second in 49.08. Evans, of Placentia, who also won the 400 individual medley, won the 400 freestyle in 4:03.85. Her old world mark was 4:05.45.

She still has one more event, the 800 freestyle, and she owns the world record in that, too. Meanwhile, America's \"Madame Butterfly,\" Mary T. Meagher, nearly failed to qualify for the event in which she holds the world record .\n\nShe was the slowest of eight qualifiers for the 100-meter butterfly. Meagher, winner of two butterfly golds four years ago, turned in a time of 1:01.48 in the 100 butterfly, way off her world mark of 57.93 The top qualifier was Catherine Ple-winski of France in 59.34. Evans, meanwhile, easily reached the final for the 800-meter freestyle, qualifying second to astrid Strauss of East Germany. Tami Bruce of San Diego qualified fifth. All eight qualifiers in the men's 400-meter freestyle, meanwhile, broke the Olympic record, led by Mariusz Podkoscielny of Poland in 3:49.51 .\n\nThe old record was 3:50.91. Four swimmers, including Tania Dangalakova of Bulgaria and world record-holder Silke Hoerner of East Germany, broke the Olympic record in qualifying for the 100-meter breaststroke. The U.S. water polo team followed a loss to Spain on Wednesday with a 14-7 victory over China on Thursday. \"The Chinese aren't as strong physically as some of the other teams,\" said Terry Schroeder, who scored four goals .\n\n\"We were able to move them around.\" Jozef Pribilinec of Czechoslovakia won the men's 20-kilometer walk.
