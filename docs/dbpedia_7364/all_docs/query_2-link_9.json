        "text": "MOSCOW -- Gintautas Umaras of the Soviet Union Monday won the 4,000 meters individual pursuit, first cycling event of the Friendship-84 Games to be decided, with a powerful performance which wore down East Germany's Bernd Dittert.\n\nUmaras, who set a world record of four minutes 36.47 seconds in Sunday qualifying, was even faster in the second half of the race. Times set in the latter stages of direct pursuit competition, however, do not count as world records.\n\nTrailing by less than half a second at the halfway mark, Umaras clawed his way in front and after three kilometers was more than two seconds up.\n\nDittert, riding the new type of cycle seen at the Los Angeles Olympics with a front wheel smaller than the rear, pulled back in the final stages but Umaras won in 4:33.63 to Dittert's 4:34.88.\n\nBoth finalists times were far better than the 4:39.35 with which American Steve Hegg won the Olympic pursuit gold medal. But direct comparisons would not take account of different conditions-the cycling events here are held on an indoor track whereas the Los Angeles velodrome was open-air.\n\nBetter comparisons should be possible at next week's World Cycling Championships in Barcelona, Spain, where Los Angeles competitors and those who missed the Olympics will race each other.\n\nUmaras had shown his come-from-behind style in the semifinals when he was led by Poland's Ryszard Dawidowicz until the final kilometer but then came through to win by almost 14 seconds. The Pole took third place in a ride-off with Hungarian Miklos Somogyi, who was well beaten by Dittert in the semifinals.\n\nIn the men's sprint quarterfinals, favorites Lutz Hesslich of East Germany and Soviet Sergei Kopilov easily went through to the last four. Defending world champion Hesslich disposed of Hungary's Zoltan Liptak comfortably in two legs and Kopilov, world champion in 1980 and 1982, similarly defeated Colombian Ugo Maya.\n\nThe two favorites were joined in Tuesday's semifinals by Czechoslovak Bratislav Sustr, who put out Areto Mekilla of Finland, also in two straight races, and Poland's Andrzej Michalak, 2-1 winner over Bulgarian Nikolai Borissov."
