        "text": "April 04, 2024\n\n“All the drama we love about the Olympics begins with Making Team USA, when our nation’s best athletes vie to make the most competitive team in the world. In some events, it’s harder to qualify for the U.S. team than it is to win a medal at the Olympics themselves.”\n\n— Molly Solomon, Executive Producer & President of NBC Olympics Production\n\nThe road to the Olympic Games Paris 2024 for the United States’ best and brightest athletes starts here: NBCUniversal will present comprehensive coverage of Making Team USA Presented by Xfinity -- the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Team Trials -- this spring and summer. NBCU is presenting over 200 hours of coverage, including more than 35 hours in primetime on NBC in the lead up to the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad in Paris, France, which take place July 26-Aug. 11.\n\nTeam USA is arguably the hardest Olympic team to make and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Team Trials are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many of the athletes involved, representing the culmination of decades of training and preparation. NBCU’s Making Team USA coverage strives not only to capture the athletic performances at the Trials but to also include athlete-led storytelling and behind-the-scenes content to fully present the experience of qualifying for the Olympics.\n\n“Earning a place on Team USA is a lifelong dream for these athletes and most of them get only one opportunity to do so, which is what makes the competition so fierce and the drama so compelling. But the reward for all the hard work is sweet -- once you make Team USA, you’re an Olympian for life.”\n\n“The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Team Trials offer some of the best competition anywhere in the world - a testament to the excellence and depth of the athlete pool striving to represent Team USA in Paris this summer,” said Rocky Harris, USOPC chief of sport and athlete services. “We are looking forward to the Paris Games – opening just a little more than 100 days from now – but first we join fans around the country in celebrating the awesome effort of athletes giving their all to make Team USA.”\n\nSwimming, Gymnastics, Track & Field and Diving Coverage for Olympic Team Trials\n\nNBCU’s April coverage consists of wrestling, rowing, canoe/kayaking while June covers swimming, diving, track & field, and gymnastics, including 14 nights in primetime on NBC. Some of the most anticipated stories and athletes for the June events leading into Paris include:\n\nSwimming: Seven-time Olympic gold medalist Katie Ledecky, who could tie or break the all-time record for Olympic gold medals won by a U.S. woman (8); seven-time Olympic gold medalist Caeleb Dressel, who earned five in Tokyo; 14-time world medalist Kate Douglass; and six-time Olympic medalist Ryan Murphy. Coverage runs from June 15-23 and includes nine nights of primetime coverage on NBC.\n\nGymnastics: The most decorated gymnast in history and four-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, who could become the first woman since Věra Čáslavská (Czechoslovakia, 1964 and 1968) to win two Olympic all-around titles, and as with Ledecky, has a chance to tie or break the all-time record for gold medals won by a U.S. woman (8); three-time Tokyo Olympic medalist Suni Lee, including individual all-around gold, can also become the first woman since Čáslavská to win two all-around titles; Tokyo Olympic floor gold medalist Jade Carey; Tokyo Olympic team silver medalist Jordan Chiles; six-time world medalist Shilese Jones; and four-time world medalist Leanne Wong. Jones and Wong are aiming to make their Olympic debuts in Paris. Coverage takes place June 27-30 and culminates with the women’s final live in primetime on NBC.\n\nTrack & Field: Six-time world champion Noah Lyles, coming off a 2023 World Championship performance that saw him become the first athlete since Usain Bolt to win the men’s 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay; defending Olympic women’s 400m hurdles champion and world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone; reigning women’s 100m world champion Sha’Carri Richardson, looking to make her Olympic debut; and two-time defending Olympic men’s shot put gold medalist and world record holder Ryan Crouser, aiming to become the first athlete to win three consecutive shot put gold medals. Track & field coverage runs from June 21-24 and June 27-30, featuring eight nights of primetime on NBC.\n\nDiving: Tokyo Olympic synchronized 10m platform silver medalist Jessica Parratto, aiming for her third Olympic appearance; Tokyo Olympic synchronized 3m springboard silver medalist Andrew Capobianco; and Tokyo Olympian Tyler Downs are all expected to compete. Coverage will take place June 17-23, and includes live coverage of the men’s and women’s springboard and platform finals on NBC.\n\nXFINITY's Athlete Connections\n\nAs presenting sponsor, Xfinity will partner with NBCUniversal to shine a light on the journeys of these remarkable athletes across its connectivity and entertainment platforms. Xfinity is also rolling out its Xfinity Athlete Connections program, which will provide a “connections credit” to each athlete who qualifies for the 2024 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams to help them remain connected while pursuing their dreams this summer.\n\n“The Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024 will be nothing short of extraordinary. As a proud partner of Team USA, we’re honored to spotlight the incredible athletes on their path to Making Team USA,” said Matt Lederer, Vice President, Brand Partnerships & Amplification, Xfinity. “And, our Xfinity Athlete Connections program will keep Team USA athletes connected to what matters most during their pursuit of Olympic and Paralympic gold.”\n\nNBCU has already presented U.S. Olympic Team Trials coverage of Boxing, the Marathon, and Table Tennis.\n\nAll Olympic and Paralympic Trials coverage streams via NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app.\n\nROWING\n\nLive coverage of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Team Trials – Rowing from Sarasota, Fla., will be presented live on Peacock from April 6-7, with both windows beginning at 8 a.m. ET.
