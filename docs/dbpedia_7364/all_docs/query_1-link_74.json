        "text": "It’s hard to imagine a Summer Olympics without basketball, and perhaps even harder still to imagine it without a U.S. team competing for another gold medal in the sport.\n\nSince basketball first became an Olympics sport in 1936, there have been 20 tournaments to determine hardcourt supremacy. The United States has walked away with gold 16 times, a mark of dominance seldom seen in sports.\n\nAnd in the process, the U.S. has provided some of the most indelible moments in Olympics history. Who can forget the 1992 Dream Team, which saw professional NBA stars enter the Olympics for the first time, delighting crowds with its sheer talent and star power in Barcelona?\n\nRELATED: Who's on Team USA? Here's a List of the Athletes Qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nWell, it’s time to make some more memories, and the United States is sending some of its all-time greats like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry to the 2024 Paris Olympics to bring home gold once more. But, as has been a growing trend over the last couple of decades, the international game is growing stronger, and victory is by no means assured.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Olympics Men’s Basketball Tournament in Paris.\n\nWho’s qualified for the Olympics 5x5 Men’s Basketball Tournament?\n\nTwelve nations will vie for gold in men’s basketball.

In the event of two teams being tied, the result of their head-to-head matchup will determine who advances.\n\nAll Group stage games will be held at Pierre Mauroy Stadium, located in Lille, about 140 miles north of Paris.
