        "text": "A 3-goal performance by Pedro Garcia led Spain to a 9-7 upset victory over the United States in water polo Thursday.\n\nAll 3 of his goals came on powerful shots from the perimeter, lifting the Spanish team to its second victory in as many days and the lead in its division.\n\nSpain took a 2-0 lead on a pair of goals by Salvador Gomez and led at the half, 3-2.\n\nNewport Beach’s James Bergeson, who scored the winning goal with 5 seconds left as the United States beat Yugoslavia Wednesday, brought the U.S. team to within striking distance with 2 goals to end the third period at 5-4.\n\nBut Spain followed with 4 fourth-quarter goals to cap a frustrating day for the U.S. team.\n\nSpain moves to 2-0 to lead the division, while the United States falls to 1-1. The two teams with the best records advance to the medal round.\n\nSwimming: Matt Biondi, of Moraga, Calif., broke the Olympic record in qualifying for the 100-meter freestyle, lowering the standard set just 5 minutes earlier by fellow American Chris Jacobs.\n\nBiondi, who already has won gold, silver and bronze medals, was timed in 49.04 seconds in his specialty. He holds the world record (48.42) in the event.\n\nJacobs, of Livingston, N.J., was timed in 49.20 before Biondi swam, breaking the previous Olympic record of 49.80, set by Rowdy Gaines of the United States in 1984.\n\nPlacentia’s Janet Evans, the only American woman swimmer with a medal after 4 events, was the top qualifier in the women’s 400-meter freestyle.\n\nEvans, who won the 400 individual medley Monday, was first in the final heat in 4:10.12.\n\nAnke Moehring of East Germany was the No. 2 qualifier, followed by Tami Bruce of San Diego.\n\nKristin Otto of East Germany was the top qualifier in the women’s 100 backstroke in 1:01.45. Otto was followed by teammate Cornelia Sirch in 1:01.63 and Kristina Egerszegi of Hungary in 1:02.09.\n\nEast Germany (3:43.13) was the fastest qualifier in the women’s 400-meter freestyle relay, the Netherlands (3:44.12) was second and the U.S. team of Jill Sterkel, Paige Zemina, Laura Walker and Mary Wayte was third in 3:45.10.\n\nGreco-Roman wrestling: Minutes after winning the bronze medal, U.S. wrestler Dennis Koslowski said he had finished his career.\n\nKoslowski, of Minneapolis, took the bronze medal in the 100-kilogram (220-pound) class, overwhelming Bulgarian Ilia Gueorguiev, 6-0.\n\nHis bronze medal was the best finish ever for the U.S. in Greco-Roman during an Olympics involving Eastern Bloc competitors.\n\nJon Ronningen of Norway overwhelmed Atsuji Miyahara of Japan, 12-7, for the gold in the 52-kilogram (115-pound) division. Korea’s Lee Jae-suk got the bronze after beating Russian Alexandre Ignatenko, 4-3.\n\nKorea’s Kim Young-nam won the gold in the 74-kilogram (163-pound) class by edging Daoulet Tourlykhanov of the Soviet Union, 2-1. Jozef Tracz of Poland took the bronze.\n\nAndrzej Wronski of Poland beat Gerhard Himmel of West Germany for the gold in the 100-kilogram (220-pound) class.\n\nCycling: Cyclists Gintautas Umaras of the Soviet Union and Dean Woods of Australia sped past semifinal opponents to reach the gold medal race in men’s individual pursuit.\n\nUmaras defeated Colin Sturgess of Britain by 6 seconds in one semifinal and Woods beat Bernd Dittert of East Germany in the other race leading to the final.\n\nSturgess, who eliminated U.S. cyclist David Brinton from the competition, will face Dittert for third place.\n\nEast Germany’s Lutz Hesslich led 8 riders into the quarterfinals of the men’s match sprint. The 1980 Olympic gold medalist defeated Japan’s Hideki Miwa and Edward Alexander of Britain in a second-round race.\n\nMexico’s Jose Yousjimatz won a qualifying heat for the men’s points race. Czechoslovakia’s Lubos Lom was second and Trinidad’s Gene Samuel was third.\n\nTennis: Stefan Edberg, the men’s favorite, swept Augustin Moreno of Mexico, 6-2, 7-6, 6-0.\n\nEdberg, who won the demonstration tennis event at Los Angeles in 1984, stayed on course to repeat that success. Tennis is a medal sport for the first time since 1924.\n\nThird-seeded Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia defeated Jeremy Bates of Britain 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 in a second-round match.\n\nIn women’s competition, Nathalie Tauziat of France defeated Carling Bassett of Canada 7-6, 6-1.\n\nBasketball: Andrew Gaze scored 25 points and Philip Smyth added 24, leading Australia over the Central Africa Republic, 106-67.\n\nGaze, who will attend Seton Hall after the Olympics, scored 20 points in the first half and Smyth scored 19.\n\nThe Soviet Union women’s basketball team squeaked home 69-66 against South Korea, thanks to their considerable height advantage. The Soviets were an average of three inches taller.\n\nGalina Savitskaya led the Soviets with 18 points, 10 of them from the free throw line. Irina Minkh scored 13 and Olga Buryakina 10.\n\nChoi Kyung-Lee led the Korean team with 20 points, but managed only four of nine from three-point range.
