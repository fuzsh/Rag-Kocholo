This is the standard size for international swimming, and more notably, it's the length of the pool used during the Olympics. Unless stated otherwise, the World Championships are typically swam in a 50-meter pool. Allan Jones Aquatic Center is designed so that it can be extended to a full Olympic-sized pool, offering an advantage in training for Tennessee swimmers.\n\nSCM: If LCM is long-course meters, then you guessed it; SCM stands for Short-Course Meters. As the name suggests, this a shorter pool length than the standard Olympic-sized pool. Short-course pools are 25 in length, so the distance is still the same when it's all said and done, but short-course pools allow for more underwater swimming and turns. More on this later. Of the three different pool lengths, SCM is the least common in competition for Tennessee swimming's purposes. The most popular event for this length is the Short Course World Championships.\n\nSCY: Finally, this brings us to our last pool length: Short-Course Yards. Like SCM, these pools are 25 in length, and the obvious difference is that SCY is yards and SCM is meters. SCM is slightly larger in length than an SCY pool, but the style in which they are swam are similar compared to that of the LCM pool. SCY is the standard pool size in collegiate competitions, including the SEC Championships and NCAA Championships.\n\nEasily Mistaken: One common mistake that people often make when first covering swimming is the distinction between pool sizes and thus the race length (50-yard freestyle is vastly different than 50-meter freestyle). Because the Olympics serve as an introduction to many when it comes to swimming, it's easy to mistake the two. The best way to remember the differences is that college swimming is yards and international swimming is meters, specifically 50 meters in length unless designated as being short course/SCM.\n\nDifferent Lengths, Different Swim Styles: Like we stated earlier, the most obivious difference between long course and short course is the number of turns. A good explanation of this difference was described by Swimming World: \"A short-course race has twice as much turning and gliding, allowing you to spend up to 60% of the race underwater. On the other hand, a long course pool only allows you to stay underwater for up to 30% of the race. Underwaters have a major effect on speed. Moving at the surface of the water is slower and uses more energy. Swimming under the surface, or gliding, avoids these problems.\n\n“The extra underwater time doesn’t just give you a boost; it also serves as a ‘recovery time.' When a swimmer is gliding, their muscles catch a break and are able to clear out some of the hydrogen, reducing the muscle fatigue before returning to the surface. In the end, the extra underwaters in short course races help swimmers maintain a higher energy output throughout the race.\"\n\nThus, speed, leg power and underwaters are going to play much more of a factor and be an advantage to some swimmers when it comes to short course pools, whereas stroke rate and endurance are much more of an emphasis when swimming long course.\n\nSet to join the Lady Vols in the fall of 2024, Jillian Crooks' international success landed her as one of the top recruits in the 2024 signing class. The sister of current UT swimmer and fellow Olympian Jordan Crooks, she competed at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and once again earned her spot on the roster for 2024 Paris. Jillian boasts 11 LCM Cayman Islands national records. After finishing 41st in the 100 free in Tokyo, she will once again compete in the event this year. Her career-best mark in the 100 free is 55.18 from the Commonwealth Youth Games in August 2023 would've ranked 29th during the last games. With her signing, she becomes the first Lady Vol swimming Olympian to hail from the Cayman Islands.\n\nAll of this comes before Crooks ever steps foot on Rocky Top. Joining the Lady Vols in the fall, the two-time Olympian was ranked as a top-10 recruit in the 2024 signing class by SwimSwam (6th) and Swimcloud (7th). Like her brother, Crooks specializes in the sprint freestyle and also excels in the 100 back with her top times in each event coming at the Speedo Winter Junior Championship East this past December.\n\nCrooks' 47.30 effort in the 100 free would be good for third in program history behind USA Olympian Erika Connolly and 2024 freshman All-American Camille Spink. She would rank sixth in the 100 back (51.54) and tied for ninth in the 50 free (21.95) with her current personal-best times."
