        "text": "Mijain Lopez is going out on top – which is where he has been for 16 years.\n\nThe Cuban won his first Olympic gold medal in 2008, and then five-peated on Tuesday with his victory in the Greco-Roman wrestling 130-kilogram division.\n\nWith the win, he became the first person to ever win an individual event five times at the Olympics.\n\nLopez won gold in the 120-kilogram division in 2008, then did so again in 2012. Four years later in Rio, the weight class than bumped up 10 kilos, and he won again.\n\nHe won another gold in the class in Tokyo three years ago, and did the same in Paris on Tuesday.\n\nAfter cementing his legacy, Lopez placed his shoes in the center of the mat, symbolizing his retirement. \"What’s great is the joy,\" Lopez said through a translator. \"It was a result that I was craving, but also for the whole world and my country. So happy to reach the Olympic elite. The reward of a lifetime of working hard with the help of everyone and my family. It is my biggest win.\"\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Morik.\n\nWhen the United States women's gymnastics team won gold in Paris, Simone Biles clapped back at a former teammate.\n\nTokyo Olympic gymnast MyKayla Skinner called out the 2024 team's work ethic, \"besides Simone,\" in a since-deleted video.\n\nBiles posted a collage of photos on Instagram showing her and her teammates carrying the American flag across the floor to celebrate their gold medal victory in the team final. In her post on Instagram, Biles did not mince words.\n\n\"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions,\" she wrote.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE, Biles defended calling out her ex-teammate, saying she needed to take the \"team lead\" for her teammates as a three-time Olympian.\n\n\"It's important because you have to teach them to use their voices. And if not, you're a voice for the voiceless, which is okay,\" Biles said. \"I just felt like it was right in that moment to stand up for them, because they're so young and they haven't fully stood in their power yet.\"\n\n\"For somebody to stand up, I know it meant a lot for [my teammates],\" Biles added.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Morik.\n\nQuincy Hall came from behind to win the men's 400m final for his very first Olympic gold medal.\n\nIt's the United States' first gold in the event since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 - it was the second year in a row the USA had swept the podium.\n\nIt's the first medal for the United States since Merritt earned bronze in 2016.\n\nHall finished the race in 43.40 seconds, a personal best - he was 0.37 seconds off world-record time.\n\nHe was in fourth place as he entered the straightaway, and by the looks of his face, he was going to give it 110%.\n\nHall did not take the lead until just mere meters away from the finish line, but it was enough to earn the title.\n\nGreat Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith finished just 0.04 seconds behind Hall to settle for silver, while Zambia's Muzala Samukonga won bronze with a time of 43.74.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Morik.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes looked like they were headed home without any hardware, but pulled off a miraculous comeback to eventually win in a shootout.\n\nDown 7-6 with just over 30 seconds to play, the United States was on a power play when Alex Bowen found the back of the net, eventually sending the game to a shootout.\n\nBoth the United States and Australia scored on their first two shootout attempts, but U.S. goalkeeper Adrian Weinberg blocked Australia's third shot. When Bowen scored, the U.S. controlled their own destiny.\n\nRound 4 saw both shot attempts blocked (Weinberg even made a save with his face), and after Australia tied the shootout in Round 5, a goal would have sent the United States to the semifinals.\n\nMarko Vavic then wound up and sniped one past the Australian keeper, to earn the 11-10 win.\n\nIt's the United States' first time going to the semifinals in men's water polo since 2008. That year, they settled for silver against Hungary.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Morik.\n\nCharles Barkley made his expectations for the U.S. men's basketball team clear.\n\nThe legendary former NBA player wants to see Team USA return from the Paris Olympics with the gold medal in their possession. Barkley was so steadfast in his belief that he suggested the players should find another country to call home if they somehow fall short of his expectations.\n\n\"Listen, if they lose, we can’t let them back in the country,\" Barkley said during a recent appearance on Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George's \"P Podcast.\" \"We can’t. I’ll tell them, ‘You can’t come back.’\"\n\nBarkley is a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He was a member of the U.S. men's national basketball team during the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, better known as the \"Dream Team.\" Barkley and Team USA also won gold on American soil during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nMany have attempted to draw comparisons between the 2024 edition of the U.S. men's basketball team and the storied roster from 1992. Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing and other all-time NBA greats played on the \"Dream Team.\"\n\nThe Americans will have to overcome a strong field of competitors this summer if they want to bring home the gold. Barkley acknowledged the challenges the team faces, but he still does not believe the U.S. team should finish the Summer Games in any place but first.\n\n\"Have the international teams gotten better, 100%,\" Barkley said. \"They're still not better than the United States. You take away ‘Joker’ [Nikola Jokic] and Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and Luka [Doncic] — all three guys are great, great players. Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] is great also, but we still got the next 10 best players in every game.\"\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Chantz Martin.\n\nIt’s not about how you start, it’s about how you finish.\n\nKenneth Rooks was in no hurry coming out of the gates in the men’s steeplechase final on Wednesday. He knew he just needed to maintain the middle of the pack and take a late charge. And that's exactly what he did.\n\nWith a little over a lap to go the American looked poised to take the lead and secure a gold medal for Team USA. The 2023 NCAA Division I champ in the 3000-meter steeplechase had calculated it perfectly.\n\nDespite a fall at the last barrier, Rooks was all but guaranteed a medal - it was just a matter of what color.\n\nMorocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali would end up hawking Rooks down, edging him by .36 seconds for the gold. Rooks beat his personal best time by almost nine seconds to capture America’s second silver medal over the last three Olympics in that event.\n\nRyan Canfield contributed to this report.\n\nThe Americans have been there before, but never golden.\n\nOn Wednesday, road race Olympic champion Kristen Faulkner, Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente and Lilly Williams defeated New Zealand in the women’s team pursuit final to win America’s first gold medal in the event, improving on their silver and bronze medals in the past three Olympics.\n\n“We knew we had a strong team coming in,” Faulkner said, “and I feel like the lucky one, because they have won medals before on the track and I haven't. I just wanted to live up to their expectations.”\n\n“It's pretty surreal,” Williams added. “I do not think anybody expected this.”\n\nThe U.S. clinched the gold medal with an official time of 4:04.306, while the team of Ally Wollaston, Bryony Botha, Emily Shearman and Nicole Shields earned a silver medal with a time of 4:04.927.\n\nDygert is on to her second medal of the 2024 Paris Games, claiming bronze in the women’s time trial last week. Faulkner is on gold medal No. 2 after winning the women’s road race on Sunday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAustralian Olympian Tom Craig broke his silence on Wednesday after he was arrested in Paris for allegedly buying cocaine after his team fell out of medal contention.\n\nCraig departed a team function on Tuesday night and was arrested about 15 minutes later, the Herald Sun in Australia reported.\n\n\"I'd firstly like to apologize for what has occurred in the last 24 hours. I made a terrible mistake. I take full responsibility for my actions,\" Craig told reporters as he left the police station, via Reuters.\n\n\"My actions are my own and in no way, reflect the values of my family, my teammates, my friends, my sport, and the Australian Olympic team. I've embarrassed you all. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nAustralian Olympic Committee spokesperson Dominic Smith said police let Craig off with a warning.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that a member of the Australian Olympic team was detained for buying cocaine. French media, citing police sources, reported Craig allegedly bought about a gram of cocaine.\n\nThis is an except from a report by Ryan Gaydos.\n\nSteeplechase is an Olympic event that was first introduced in 1920. The event’s name originated from the horse racing event, where horses would race on a track and navigate various obstacles.\n\nIt has been standardized to be a 3,000-meter race, or about seven and half laps around a track. The race features 28 barriers, including hurdles and seven water jumps throughout the race.\n\nIn the men’s competition the barriers are 36 inches tall and 30 inches tall in the women’s competition. The water pit is 12 feet long, and at its deepest point is nearly 20 inches deep. The water pits are sloped from the barrier back inclining toward the track level.\n\nThe barriers and water jump on the course are fixed, so the athletes can choose if they want to jump over them or use the barriers to propel them into a longer jump. Winfred Yavi of Bahrain won gold in the women’s 3,000-meter steeplechase on Tuesday.\n\nThe men’s steeplechase final is on Wednesday at 3:43 p.m. ET.\n\nRyan Canfield contributed to this report.\n\nClaire Michel spoke out on social media this week after she was forced to withdraw from the mixed relay event at the Paris Olympics after she got sick days after competing in the women’s triathlon, which included a swim in the Seine River.\n\n“There’s been a lot of conflicting information in the media lately, so I just wanted to clarify a few things,” she wrote in a post on Instagram. “First of all, thanks to great medical care from both the Team Belgium medical team and the incredible volunteer doctors and nurses at the Polyclinic in the Olympic village, I am gradually doing better and I returned home to Belgium today.”\n\n“Blood tests showed that I contracted a virus (not E. Coli). After three days of vomiting and diarrhea, which left me quite empty, I ended up needing more significant medical attention and spent the Sunday at the clinic.”\n\nMichel was one of many athletes to fall ill after the triathlon, leading to speculation that the water in the Seine River was to blame.\n\nBacteria levels in the long-polluted river have been in flux during the Games, causing test swims ahead of the triathlon events to be canceled and the men's triathlon to be delayed by a day. Organizers had said that water quality tests done the day of the individual triathlon races showed “very good” levels of fecal bacteria E. coli and enterococci.\n\nIt was initially reported that Michel contracted E. coli, but she clarified Tuesday that she contracted a virus. Several other athletes have since fallen sick with gastrointestinal issues.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nMichelle Obama, the former first lady of the United States, praised American gymnasts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles for showing sportsmanship toward Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade.\n\nBiles and Chiles took home silver and bronze medals, respectively, on the floor exercise at the Paris Olympics while Andrade won the gold. Biles and Chiles then bowed to Andrade while on the podium in what appeared to underscore what the Olympic spirit was all about.\n\nWhile Baltimore Ravens star Marlon Humphrey called the moment \"literally disgusting\" in a trollish post on X, Obama had nothing but praise for the gymnasts.\n\n\"I’m still not over this beautiful moment of sisterhood and sportsmanship! You can just feel the love shining through these ladies. Congrats Rebeca, Jordan and Simone!\" Obama wrote.\n\nAndrade had worked back from three ACL surgeries to get the gold, which is why Biles and Chiles were seen praising her.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a report by Ryan Gaydos.\n\nControversy struck the women’s wrestling portion of the Paris Olympics on Wednesday as India’s Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the 50-kilogram division after missing weight.\n\nPhogat was set to compete against American Sarah Ann Hildebrandt for the gold medal but now Cuban Yusneylis Guzman Lopez will take her spot.\n\n“It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the women’s wrestling 50kg class,” the Indiana Olympic Committee said in a statement. “Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning.\n\n“No further comments will be made by the contingent at this time. The Indian team requests you respect Vinesh’s privacy. It would like to focus on the competitions on hand.”\n\nEach weight category in the Olympics is organized over the course of two days. The medical control and weigh-in for each category takes place in the morning of each competition day and those who qualify for the finals and the repechage are weighed again, according to Olympics.com.\n\nIf a wrestler fails the weigh-in on either day of competition, then they are eliminated from the event.\n\nUkrainian athletes have put on courageous displays at the Paris Olympics despite worries back home over Russia’s incursion into their countries.\n\nZhan Beleniuk, who is set to wrestle in the 87-kilogram category, has a lot of weight on his shoulders. Not only is he representing his country on the biggest sporting stage in the world, but he’s also a member of parliament.\n\nBeleniuk is hopeful to win a second gold medal. He implored his fellow athletes to show that “Ukraine is still alive.”\n\n“We still protect our land, we still do our job,” he said.\n\nBeleniuk’s primary responsibility in the Ukrainian government is youth and sport but he also meets with other leaders to ward off Russian propaganda.\n\n“Our country gave me everything that I have now, so my responsibility in this tough period for our country, to share this information to connect with different MPs (members of parliament) around the world and manage this problem,” he said.\n\nBeleniuk’s next match is against Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Tursynov after already defeating China’s Qian Haitao.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGreek long jumper Miltiadis Tentoglou joined an exclusive club on Tuesday at the Paris Olympics.\n\nTentoglou became the second man to win consecutive long-jumping gold medals. The first? American Olympic legend Carl Lewis.“It’s a great achievement,” Tentoglou said.\n\nLewis won four Olympic long jump titles in a row, starting with the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and running through Atlanta in 1996. The Greek Olympian suggested he wasn’t quite finished with his Olympic aspirations as he set his sights on 2028 and 2032.\n\n“Of course I will go,” Tentoglou said. “(For 2032), we will see. And also (for 2028), we will see because you never know. But I will try.”\n\nTentoglou won gold at the 2024 World Indoor Championships in Glasgow and the 2023 World Championships in Budapest. But he has plenty of other gold medals on his docket across the Diamond League, European Championships, European Indoor Championships and junior championships.\n\nThe only silvers he has came in 2022 at the World Championships in Eugene and the 2016 World Junior Championships in Bydgoszcz.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
