        "text": "The acting coach of the German U23 National Team has been accused of having used doping products during his career as a rider. The coach, Bernd Dittert, has denied the charges, according to the German cycling federation's vice president, Harald Pfab. The organizers up the upcoming World Championships in Stuttgart have asked the German federation, the Bund Deutsche Radfahrer, for a quick explanation of the charges.\n\nThe Stuttgarter Zeitung claimed to have copies of letters written by Pfab and an unnamed individual in which it is claimed that the Institute for Doping Analysis and Sports Biochemistry in Kreischa, Germany, has proof that Dittert was doped in 1987 and 1988. Dittert rode on the East German national track team in the 1980s. In addition, the letters are said to claim that the BDR hired Dittert in 1993 without doing a background check on him.\n\nDittert took over the coach's job in June, after Peter Weibel was suspended due to doping allegations.\n\nWorld's organization committee Chairman Susanne Eisenmann called on the BDR to investigate Dittert's past as quickly as possibly. The federation agreed to the request."
