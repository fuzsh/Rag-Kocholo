To further characterize this aberration, we studied 81 cases with del(14q): 54 of CLL and 27 of small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), the largest reported series to date. Using karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the most frequent additional abnormality was trisomy 12 (tri12), observed in 28/79 (35%) cases, followed by del13q14 (12/79, 15%), delTP53 (11/80, 14%) delATM (5/79, 6%), and del6q21 (3/76, 4%). IGHV genes were unmutated in 41/53 (77%) patients, with a high frequency of IGHV1-69 (21/52, 40%). NOTCH1 gene was mutated in 14/45 (31%) patients. There was no significant difference in cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities between CLL and SLL. Investigations using FISH and SNP-array demonstrated the heterogeneous size of the 14q deletions. However, a group with the same del(14)(q24.1q32.33) was identified in 48% of cases. In this group, tri12 (P = 0.004) and NOTCH1 mutations (P = 0.02) were significantly more frequent than in the other patients. In CLL patients with del(14q), median treatment-free survival (TFS) was 27 months. In conclusion, del(14q) is associated with tri12 and with pejorative prognostic factors: unmutated IGHV genes (with over-representation of the IGHV1-69 repertoire), NOTCH1 mutations, and a short TFS.

Although DNA aberrations change over time, IgHV sequences and mutational status are considered stable. In a retrospective review, 409 CLL patients, between 2008 and 2015, had IgHV analysis: 56 patients had multiple analyses performed. Seven patients' IgHV results changed: 2 from unmutated to mutated and 5 from mutated to unmutated IgHV sequence. Three concurrently changed their variable heavy-chain sequence. Secondary to allelic exclusion, 2 of the new variable heavy chains produced were biologically nonplausible. The existence of these new nonplausible heavy-chain variable regions suggests either the CLL cancer stem-cell maintains the ability to rearrange a previously silenced IgH allele or more likely that the cancer stem-cell produced at least 2 subclones, suggesting that the CLL cancer stem cell exists before the process of allelic exclusion occurs.

AID has previously been shown to preferentially deaminate WRC (W = A/T, R = A/G) hotspots. WGCW sites, which contain an overlapping WRC hotspot on both DNA strands, mutate at much higher frequency than single hotspots. Human Ig heavy chain (IGHV) genes differ in terms of WGCW numbers, ranging from 4 for IGHV3-48*03 to as many as 12 in IGHV1-69*01. An absence of V-region mutations in CLL patients (\"IGHV unmutated\", or U-CLL) is associated with a poorer prognosis compared to \"IGHV mutated\" (M-CLL) patients. The reasons for this difference are still unclear, but it has been noted that particular IGHV genes associate with U-CLL vs M-CLL. For example, patients with IGHV1-69 clones tend to be U-CLL with a poor prognosis, whereas patients with IGHV3-30 tend to be M-CLL and have a better prognosis. Another distinctive feature of CLL is that ~30% of (mostly poor prognosis) patients can be classified into \"stereotyped\" subsets, each defined by HCDR3 similarity, suggesting selection, possibly for a self-antigen. We analyzed >1000 IGHV genes from CLL patients and found a highly significant statistical relationship between the number of WGCW hotspots in the germline V-region and the observed mutation frequency in patients. However, paradoxically, this correlation was inverse, with V-regions with more WGCW hotspots being less likely to be mutated, i.e., more likely to be U-CLL. The number of WGCW hotspots in particular, are more strongly correlated with mutation frequency than either non-overlapping (WRC) hotspots or more general models of mutability derived from somatic hypermutation data. Furthermore, this correlation is not observed in sequences from the B cell repertoires of normal individuals and those with autoimmune diseases.\n\nClonal evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: analysis of correlations with IGHV mutational status, NOTCH1 mutations and clinical significance.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez, Cristina; Delgado, Julio; Costa, Dolors; Villamor, Neus; Navarro, Alba; Cazorla, Maite; GÃ³mez, CÃ¡ndida; Arias, Amparo; MuÃ±oz, Concha; Cabezas, Sandra; Baumann, Tycho; Rozman, MarÃ­a; Aymerich, Marta; Colomer, Dolors; Pereira, Arturo; Cobo, Francesc; LÃ³pez-Guillermo, Armando; Campo, ElÃ­as; CarriÃ³, Ana\n\n2013-10-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized with highly variable clinical course. The most common chromosomal abnormalities in CLL, using conventional and molecular cytogenetics, are trisomy 12, del(13)(q14), del(11)(q22-23), del(17)(p13), and del(6)(q21). Whereas the prognostic marker such as IGHV mutational status remains stable during course of the diseases, chromosomal aberrations may be acquired over time. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, and biological significance of clonal evolution (CE) using conventional and molecular cytogenetics and its relationship with prognostic markers such as CD38, ZAP70, and the mutational status of IGHV and NOTCH1. One hundred and forty-three untreated CLL patients were included in the study. The median time interval between analyses was 32 months (range 6-156 months). Forty-seven patients (33%) had CE as evidenced by detection of new cytogenetic abnormalities during follow-up. CE was not correlated with high expression of ZAP70, unmutated IGHV genes or NOTCH1 mutations. Multivariate analysis revealed that CE and IGHV mutation status had a significant impact on TFS. The combination of conventional and molecular cytogenetics increased the detection of CE, this phenomenon probably being a reflection of genomic instability and conferring a more aggressive clinical course.

PMID\n\nMajor prognostic value of complex karyotype in addition to TP53 and IGHV mutational status in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Bris, Yannick; Struski, StÃ©phanie; GuiÃ¨ze, Romain; Rouvellat, Caroline; Prade, NaÃ¯s; Troussard, Xavier; Tournilhac, Olivier; BÃ©nÃ©, Marie C; Delabesse, Eric; Ysebaert, LoÃ¯c\n\n2017-12-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder of remarkable heterogeneity as demonstrated by cytogenetics and molecular analyses. Complex karyotype (CK), TP53 deletions and/or mutations (TP53 disruption), IGVH mutational status, and, more recently, recurrent somatic mutations have been identified as prognostic markers in CLL. On a cohort of 110 patients with CLL treated with first-line fludarabin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab treatment compared with 33 untreated (watch and wait) patients with CLL, we report more frequent complex karyotypes (34 vs 15%; PÂ =Â .05), unmutated IGHV (70 vs 21%; PÂ <Â .0001), ATM deletion (25 vs 6%, PÂ =Â .02), and NOTCH mutation (3 vs 17%, PÂ =Â .04). Among treated patients, 39 relapsed during the follow-up period. These patients were characterized before treatment by a higher incidence of trisomy 12 (38 vs 11%, PÂ <Â .001) and TP53 disruption (31 vs 4%, PÂ =Â .0002). A significantly shorter 5-year overall survival was found for treated patients with CK (72.4 vs 85.8%; PÂ =Â .007), unmutated IGHV (70 vs 100%; PÂ =Â .04), or TP53 disruption (55.7 vs 82.7%; PÂ <Â .0001). Three risk groups were defined based on the status of TP53 disruption or unmutated IGVH, which differed significantly in terms of 5-year overall survival. Moreover, the presence of CK impacted pejoratively 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival in all these 3 groups. Conventional karyotyping therefore appears to be of value, CK being an additional factor, undetectable in classical FISH, in patients with CLL at the stage when therapy becomes required.

Patients with unmutated IGHV have a more aggressive disease and a worse outcome than patients with cells having somatic IGHV gene mutations. Moreover, up to 30% of the unmutated CLL clones exhibit very similar or identical B cell receptors (BcR), often encoded by the same IG genes. These âstereotypedâ BcRs have been classified into defined subsets. The presence of an IGHV gene somatic mutation and the utilization of a skewed gene repertoire compared with normal B cells together with the expression of stereotyped receptors by unmutated CLL clones may indicate stimulation/selection by antigenic epitopes. This antigenic stimulation may occur prior to or during neoplastic transformation, but it is unknown whether this stimulation/selection continues after leukemogenesis has ceased. In this study, we focused on seven CLL cases with stereotyped BcR Subset #8 found among a cohort of 700 patients; in six, the cells expressed IgG and utilized IGHV4-39 and IGKV1-39/IGKV1D-39 genes, as reported for Subset #8 BcR. One case exhibited special features, including expression of IgM or IgG by different subclones consequent to an isotype switch, allelic inclusion at the IGH locus in the IgM-expressing cells and a particular pattern of cytogenetic lesions. Collectively, the data indicate a process of antigenic stimulation/selection of the fully transformed CLL cells leading to the expansion of the Subset #8 IgG-bearing subclone.

Here, we studied the treatment-free survival (TFS) impact of normal serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) at diagnosis. One hundred twelve patients with CLL were analyzed. The main prognostic factors (Binet stage; lymphocytosis; IGHV mutation status; TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, and BIRC3 mutations; and cytogenetic abnormalities) were studied. The frequencies of IGHV mutation status, cytogenetic abnormalities, and TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, and BIRC3 mutations were not significantly different between normal and abnormal SPE. Normal SPE was associated with Binet stage A, nonprogressive disease for 6Â months, lymphocytosis below 30Â G/L, and the absence of the IGHV3-21 gene rearrangement which is associated with poor prognosis. The TFS of patients with normal SPE was significantly longer than that of patients with abnormal SPE (log-rank test: PÂ =Â 0.0015, with 51% untreated patients at 5.6Â years and a perfect plateau afterward vs. a median TFS at 2.64Â years for abnormal SPE with no plateau). Multivariate analysis using two different Cox models and bootstrapping showed that normal SPE was an independent good prognostic marker for either Binet stage, lymphocytosis, or IGHV mutation status. TFS was further increased when both normal SPE and mutated IGHV were present (log-rank test: PÂ =Â 0.008, median not reached, plateau at 5.6Â years and 66% untreated patients). A comparison with other prognostic markers suggested that normal SPE could reflect slowly advancing CLL disease. Altogether, our results show that a combination of normal SPE and mutated IGHV genes defines a subgroup of patients with CLL who evolve very slowly and who might never need treatment.

In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic rearranged IGHV gene is strongly associated with patient outcome. Correct determination of this parameter strictly depends on the comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the clonotypic rearranged IGHV gene with that of the closest germline counterpart. Consequently, changes in the reference directories could, in principle, affect the correct interpretation of the IGHV mutational status in CLL. To this end, we analyzed 8066 productive IG heavy chain (IGH) rearrangement sequences from our consortium both before and after the latest update of the IMGT/V-QUEST reference directory. Differences were identified in 405 cases (5Â % of the cohort). In 291/405 sequences (71.9Â %), changes concerned only the IGHV gene or allele name, whereas a change in the percent germline identity (%GI) was noted in 114/405 (28.1Â %) sequences; in 50/114 (43.8Â %) sequences, changes in the %GI led to a change in the mutational set. In conclusion, recent changes in the IMGT reference directories affected the interpretation of SHM in a sizeable number of IGH rearrangement sequences from CLL patients. This indicates that both physicians and researchers should consider a re-evaluation of IG sequence data, especially for those IGH rearrangement sequences that, up to date, have a GI close to 98Â %, where caution is warranted.\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia: A prognostic model comprising only two biomarkers (IGHV mutational status and FISH cytogenetics) separates patients with different outcome and simplifies the CLL-IPI.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelgado, Julio; Doubek, Michael; Baumann, Tycho; Kotaskova, Jana; Molica, Stefano; Mozas, Pablo; Rivas-Delgado, Alfredo; Morabito, Fortunato; Pospisilova, Sarka; Montserrat, Emili\n\n2017-04-01\n\nRai and Binet staging systems are important to predict the outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but do not reflect the biologic diversity of the disease nor predict response to therapy, which ultimately shape patients' outcome. We devised a biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system based on the two most important prognostic parameters in CLL (i.e., IGHV mutational status and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] cytogenetics), separating three different risk groups: (1) low-risk (mutated IGHVâ+âno adverse FISH cytogenetics [del(17p), del(11q)]); (2) intermediate-risk (either unmutated IGHV or adverse FISH cytogenetics) and (3) high-risk (unmutated IGHVâ+âadverse FISH cytogenetics). In 524 unselected subjects with CLL, the 10-year overall survival was 82% (95% CI 76%-88%), 52% (45%-62%), and 27% (17%-42%) for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Patients with low-risk comprised around 50% of the series and had a life expectancy comparable to the general population. The prognostic model was fully validated in two independent cohorts, including 417 patients representative of general CLL population and 337 patients with Binet stage A CLL. The model had a similar discriminatory value as the CLL-IPI. Moreover, it applied to all patients with CLL independently of age, and separated patients with different risk within Rai or Binet clinical stages. The biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system presented here simplifies the CLL-IPI and could be useful in daily practice and to stratify patients in clinical trials.

Here, we evaluated the reactivity of a panel of different CLL recombinant antibodies (rAbs) encoded by the most commonly expressed IGHV genes with a panel of selected viral and bacterial pathogens. Six different CLL rAbs encoded by IGHV1-69 or IGHV3-21, but not a CLL rAb encoded by IGHV4-39 genes, reacted with a single protein of human cytomegalovirus (CMV). The CMV protein was identified as the large structural phosphoprotein pUL32. In contrast, none of the CLL rAbs bound to any other structure of CMV, adenovirus serotype 2, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, or of cells used for propagation of these microorganisms. Monoclonal antibodies or humanized rAbs of irrelevant specificity to pUL32 did not react with any of the proteins present in the different lysates. Still, rAbs encoded by a germ line IGHV1-69 51p1 allele from CMV-seropositive and -negative adults also reacted with pUL32. The observed reactivity of multiple different CLL rAbs and natural antibodies from CMV-seronegative adults with pUL32 is consistent with the properties of a superantigen.

Several prognostic factors such as the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (IGHV) mutation status are linked to the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, supporting a role for triggering the BCR in vivo in the pathogenesis. The miRNA profile upon stimulation and correlation with IGHV mutation status is however unknown. To evaluate the transcriptional response of peripheral blood CLL cells upon BCR stimulation in vitro, miRNA and mRNA expression was measured using hybridization arrays and qPCR. We found both IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells to respond with increased expression of MYC and other genes associated with BCR activation, and a phenotype of cell cycle progression. Genome-wide expression studies showed hsa-miR-132-3p/hsa-miR-212 miRNA cluster induction associated with a set of downregulated genes, enriched for genes modulated by BCR activation and amplified by Myc. We conclude that BCR triggering of CLL cells induces a transcriptional response of genes associated with BCR activation, enhanced cell cycle entry and progression and suggest that part of the transcriptional profiles linked to IGHV mutation status observed in isolated peripheral blood are not cell intrinsic but rather secondary to in vivo BCR stimulation.

It is also highly expressed in several B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. G6 is an anti-idiotypic monoclonal Ab that selectively binds to IGHV1-69 heavy chain germline gene 51p1 alleles that have been implicated in these Ab responses and disease processes. Here, we determine the co-crystal structure of humanized G6 (hG6.3) in complex with anti-influenza hemagglutinin stem-directed broadly neutralizing Ab D80. The core ofÂ the hG6.3 idiotope is a continuous string of CDR-H2 residues starting with M53 and ending with N58. G6 binding studies demonstrate the remarkable breadth of binding to 51p1 IGHV1-69 Abs with diverse CDR-H3, light chain, and antigen binding specificities. These studies detail the broad expression of the G6 cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) that further define its potential role in precision medicine. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

Most information on CLL immunoglobulins (Igs), such as the definition of stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs), was derived from germline unmutated Igs. In particular, detailed studies on the distribution and nature of mutations in paired heavy- and light-chain domains of CLL clones bearing mutated Igs are lacking. To address the somatic hyper-mutation dynamics of CLL Igs, we analyzed the mutation pattern of paired IGHVâdiversity-joining (IGHV-D-J ) and immunoglobulin kappa/lambda variable-joining (IGK/LV-J ) rearrangements of 193 leukemic clones that displayed â¥2% mutations in at least one of the two immunoglobulin variable (IGV ) genes (IGHV and/or IGK/LV ). The relationship between the mutation frequency in IGHV and IGK/LV complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs) was evaluated by correlation analysis. Replacement (R) mutation frequency within IGK/LV chain CDRs correlated significantly with mutation frequency of paired IGHV CDRs in Î» but not Îº isotype CLL clones. CDRs of IGKV-J rearrangements displayed a lower percentage of R mutations than IGHVs. The frequency/pattern of mutations in kappa CLL Igs differed also from that in Îº-expressing normal B cells described in the literature. Instead, the mutation frequency within the FRs of IGHV and either IGKV or IGLV was correlated. Notably, the amount of diversity introduced by replaced amino acids was comparable between IGHVs and IGKVs. The data indicate a different mutation pattern between Îº and Î» isotype CLL clones and suggest an antigenic selection that, in Îº samples, operates against CDR variation.

Of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes expressed in CLL, IGHV1-69 is the most common, and often is expressed with little or no somatic mutation, and restricted IGHD and IGHJ gene usage. We found that antibodies encoded by one particular IGHV1-69 subset, designated CLL69C, with the HCDR3 encoded by the IGHD3-3 gene in reading frame 2 and IGHJ6, specifically bound to oxidation-specific epitopes (OSE), which are products of enhanced lipid peroxidation and a major target of innate natural antibodies. Specifically, CLL69C bound immunodominant OSE adducts termed MAA (malondialdehydeâacetaldehyde-adducts), which are found on apoptotic cells, inflammatory tissues, and atherosclerotic lesions. It also reacted specifically with MAA-specific peptide mimotopes. Light chain shuffling indicated that non-stochastically paired L chain of IGLV3-9 contributes to the antigen binding of CLL69C. A nearly identical CLL69C Ig heavy chain was identified from an MAA-enriched umbilical cord phage displayed Fab library, and a derived Fab with the same HCDR3 rearrangement displayed identical MAA-binding properties. These data support the concept that OSE (MAA-epitopes), which are ubiquitous products of inflammation, may play a role in clonal selection and expansion of CLL B cells.

The mechanisms whereby HBV induces ALF are unknown. Here, we show that liver tissue collected at the time of liver transplantation in two patients with HBV-associated ALF is characterized by an overwhelming B cell response apparently centered in the liver with massive accumulation of plasma cells secreting IgG and IgM, accompanied by complement deposition. We demonstrate that the molecular target of these antibodies is the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg); that these anti-bodies display a restricted variable heavy chain (V(H)) repertoire and lack somatic mutations; and that these two unrelated individuals with ALF use an identical predominant V(H) gene with unmutated variable domain (IGHV1-3) for both IgG and IgM anti-HBc antibodies, indicating that HBcAg is the target of a germline human V(H) gene. These data suggest that humoral immunity may exert a primary role in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated ALF.\n\nRisk adjusted therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a phase II cancer trials Ireland (CTRIAL-IE [ICORG 07-01]) study of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab therapy evaluating response adapted, abbreviated frontline therapy with FCR in non-del(17p) CLL.\n\nPubMed\n\nAppleby, Niamh; O'Brien, David; Quinn, Fiona M; Smyth, Liam; Kelly, Johanna; Parker, Imelda; Scott, Kathleen; Cahill, Mary R; Crotty, Gerard; Enright, Helen; Hennessy, Brian; Hodgson, Andrew; Leahy, Maeve; O'Leary, Hilary; O'Dwyer, Michael; Hayat, Amjad; Vandenberghe, Elisabeth A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nMinimal residual disease negative complete response (MRD-negative CR) provides an early marker for time to treatment failure (TTF) in CLL treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). MRD was assessed after four FCR cycles (FCR4); MRD-negative CR patients discontinued treatment. Fifty-two patients (35M; 17F) were enrolled. Eighteen (18/52; 34.6%) patients reached MRD-negative CR after FCR4 and 29/52 (55.8%) were MRD-negative CR at end of treatment (EOT). Median TTF was 71.1 months (95% CI 61.3-84.1 months), with median overall survival not reached. Mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements (IGHV) were associated with early MRD-negative remissions, translating into prolonged TTF. Unmutated-IGHV, mutated-SF3B1 and mutated-NOTCH1 were associated with shortened TTF. No TTF difference was observed between patients in MRD-negative CR after four versus six cycles (82.2 versus 85.3 months, pâ=â.6306). Abbreviated FCR therapy is effective for patients achieving early MRD-negative remissions. Interim MRD assessment assists in personalizing therapy and reducing chemotherapy-associated toxicity.\n\nGenome-wide DNA methylation profiling integrated with gene expression profiling identifies PAX9 as a novel prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRani, Lata; Mathur, Nitin; Gupta, Ritu; Gogia, Ajay; Kaur, Gurvinder; Dhanjal, Jaspreet Kaur; Sundar, Durai; Kumar, Lalit; Sharma, Atul\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), epigenomic and genomic studies have expanded the existing knowledge about the disease biology and led to the identification of potential biomarkers relevant for implementation of personalized medicine. In this study, an attempt has been made to examine and integrate the global DNA methylation changes with gene expression profile and their impact on clinical outcome in early stage CLL patients. The integration of DNA methylation profile ( n â=â14) with the gene expression profile ( n â=â21) revealed 142 genes as hypermethylated-downregulated and; 62 genes as hypomethylated-upregulated in early stage CLL patients compared to CD19+ B-cells from healthy individuals. The mRNA expression levels of 17 genes identified to be differentially methylated and/or differentially expressed was further examined in early stage CLL patients ( n â=â93) by quantitative real time PCR (RQ-PCR). Significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression of MEIS1 , PMEPA1 , SOX7 , SPRY1 , CDK6 , TBX2 , and SPRY2 genes in CLL cells as compared to B-cells from healthy individuals. The analysis in the IGHV mutation based categories (Unmutatedâ=â39, Mutatedâ=â54) revealed significantly higher mRNA expression of CRY1 and PAX9 genes in the IGHV unmutated subgroup ( p â<â0.001). The relative risk of treatment initiation was significantly higher among patients with high expression of CRY1 (RRâ=â1.91, p â=â0.005) or PAX9 (RRâ=â1.87, p â=â0.001). High expression of CRY1 (HR: 3.53, p â<â0.001) or PAX9 (HR: 3.14, p â<â0.001) gene was significantly associated with shorter time to first treatment. The high expression of PAX9 gene (HR: 3.29, 95% CI 1.172-9.272, p â=â0.016) was also predictive of shorter overall survival in CLL. The DNA methylation changes associated with mRNA expression of CRY1 and PAX9 genes allow risk stratification of early stage CLL patients.

Using microarray based gene expression profiling we have recently demonstrated that the gene for Pgrn, granulin (GRN), is significantly higher expressed in aggressive CD38+ZAP-70+ as compared to indolent CD38âZAP-70â chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases. Here, we measured Pgrn plasma concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the Essen CLL cohort of 131 patients and examined Pgrn for association with established prognostic markers and clinical outcome. We found that high Pgrn plasma levels were strongly associated with adverse risk factors including unmutated IGHV status, expression of CD38 and ZAP-70, poor risk cytogenetics (11q-, 17p-) as detected by flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high Binet stage. Pgrn as well as the aforementioned risk factors were prognostic for time to first treatment and overall survival in this series. Importantly, these results could be confirmed in the independent multicentric CLL1 cohort of untreated Binet stage A patients (nâ=â163). Here, multivariate analysis of time to first treatment revealed that high risk Pgrn (HRâ=â2.06, 95%-CIâ=â1.13â3.76, pâ=â0.018), unmutated IGHV status (HRâ=â5.63, 95%-CIâ=â3.05â10.38, p<0.001), high risk as defined by the study protocol (HRâ=â2.06, 95%-CIâ=â1.09â3.89, pâ=â0.026) but not poor risk cytogenetics were independent prognostic markers.

Cytogenetic analysis showed favorable findings (normal karyotype and isolated 13q14 deletion) in 30 patients, unfavorable (complex karyotype and/or 17p13/11q22 deletion) in 34 cases and intermediate (all other abnormalities) in 36 cases. A complex karyotype was present in 21 patients. Mutations were detected in 56 cases and were associated with unmutated IGHV status (p = 0.040) and complex karyotype (p = 0.047). TP53 disruption (i.e. TP53 mutations and/or 17p13 deletion by FISH) correlated with the presence of â¥ 2 mutations (p = 0.001) and a complex karyotype (p = 0.012). By multivariate analysis, an advanced Binet stage (p < 0.001) and an unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.001) predicted a shorter time to first treatment. TP53 disruption (p = 0.019) and the unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.028) predicted a worse overall survival. A shorter time to chemorefractoriness was associated with TP53 disruption (p = 0.001) and unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.025). Patients with both unfavorable karyotype and TP53 disruption presented a dismal outcome (median overall survival and time to chemorefractoriness of 28.7 and 15.0 months, respectively). In conclusion, karyotype analysis refines risk stratification in high-risk CLL patients and could identify a subset of patients with highly unfavorable outcome requiring alternative treatments.

To investigate the association between clinicobiologic features and responsiveness of CLL cells to anti-IgM stimulation, we evaluated gene expression changes and modifications in cell-cycle distribution, proliferation, and apoptosis of IgV(H) mutated (M) and unmutated (UM) samples upon BCR cross-linking. Unsupervised analysis highlighted a different response profile to BCR stimulation between UM and M samples. Supervised analysis identified several genes modulated exclusively in the UM cases upon BCR cross-linking. Functional gene groups, including signal transduction, transcription, cell-cycle regulation, and cytoskeleton organization, were up-regulated upon stimulation in UM cases. Cell-cycle and proliferation analyses confirmed that IgM cross-linking induced a significant progression into the G(1) phase and a moderate increase of proliferative activity exclusively in UM patients. Moreover, we observed only a small reduction in the percentage of subG(0/1) cells, without changes in apoptosis, in UM cases; contrariwise, a significant increase of apoptotic levels was observed in stimulated cells from M cases. These results document that a differential genotypic and functional response to BCR ligation between IgV(H) M and UM cases is operational in CLL, indicating that response to antigenic stimulation plays a pivotal role in disease progression.\n\nThe histone methyltransferase EZH2 as a novel prosurvival factor in clinically aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nPapakonstantinou, Nikos; Ntoufa, Stavroula; Chartomatsidou, Elisavet; Kotta, Konstantia; Agathangelidis, Andreas; Giassafaki, Lefki; Karamanli, Tzeni; Bele, Panagiota; Moysiadis, Theodoros; Baliakas, Panagiotis; Sutton, Lesley Ann; Stavroyianni, Niki; Anagnostopoulos, Achilles; Makris, Antonios M; Ghia, Paolo; Rosenquist, Richard; Stamatopoulos, Kostas\n\n2016-06-14\n\nThe histone methyltransferase EZH2 induces gene repression through trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). EZH2 overexpression has been reported in many types of cancer and associated with poor prognosis. Here we investigated the expression and functionality of EZH2 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Aggressive cases with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL) displayed significantly higher EZH2 expression compared to indolent CLL cases with mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL); furthermore, in U-CLL EZH2 expression was upregulated with disease progression. Within U-CLL, EZH2high cases harbored significantly fewer (p = 0.033) TP53 gene abnormalities compared to EZH2low cases. EZH2high cases displayed high H3K27me3 levels and increased viability suggesting that EZH2 is functional and likely confers a survival advantage to CLL cells. This argument was further supported by siRNA-mediated downmodulation of EZH2 which resulted in increased apoptosis. Notably, at the intraclonal level, cell proliferation was significantly associated with EZH2 expression. Treatment of primary CLL cells with EZH2 inhibitors induced downregulation of H3K27me3 levels leading to increased cell apoptosis. In conclusion, EZH2 is overexpressed in adverse-prognosis CLL and associated with increased cell survival and proliferation.

Taking advantage of a population of 608 patients, we identified the strongest prognostic markers of survival and, subsequently, in a cohort of 212 patients we integrated data of cytogenetic lesions, IGHV mutational status, and CD38 expression in a new and easy scoring system we called the integrated CLL scoring system (ICSS). ICSS defines 3 groups of risk: (1) low risk (patients with 13q(-) or normal fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis results, mutated IGHV, and CD38) (2) high risk (all 11q(-) or 17p(-) patients and/or all unmutated IGHV and CD38(+) patients); and (3) intermediate risk (all remaining patients). Using only these 3 already available prognostic factors, we were able to properly redefine patients and better predict the clinical course of the disease. ICSS could become a useful tool for CLL patients' management. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In total, 108 IGH@ rearrangements were analyzed. Most of them (75.3%) were non-productive. IGHV@ segments proximal to IGHD-IGHJ@ were preferentially rearranged (45.3%). Increased utilization of IGHV3 segments IGHV3-13 (11.3%) and IGHV3-15 (9.3%), IGHD3 (30.5%), and IGHJ4 (34%) was noted. In pro-B ALL more frequent were IGHV3-11 (33.3%) and IGHV6-1 (33.3%), IGHD2-21 (50%), IGHJ4 (50%), and IGHJ6 (50%) segments. Shorter CDR3 length was observed in IGHV@6, IGHD7, and IGHJ1 segments, whereas increased CDR3 length was related to IGHV3, IGHD2, and IGHJ4 segments. Increased risk of relapse was found in patients with productive sequences. Specifically, the relapse-free survival rate at 5 years in patients with productive sequences at diagnosis was 75% (standard error [SE] Â±9%), whereas in patients with non-productive sequences it was 97% (SE Â±1.92%) (p-value =0.0264). Monoclonality and oligoclonality were identified in 81.2% and 18.75% cases at diagnosis, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed IGHV@ to IGHDJ joining only in 6.6% cases with oligoclonality. The majority (75%) of relapsed patients had monoclonal IGH@ rearrangements. The preferential utilization of IGHV@ segments proximal to IGHDJ depended on their location on the IGHV@ locus. Molecular mechanisms occurring during IGH@ rearrangement might play an essential role in childhood ALL prognosis. In our study, the productivity of the rearranged sequences at diagnosis proved to be a significant prognostic factor.\n\nZAP-70 compared with immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene mutation status as a predictor of disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRassenti, Laura Z; Huynh, Lang; Toy, Tracy L; Chen, Liguang; Keating, Michael J; Gribben, John G; Neuberg, Donna S; Flinn, Ian W; Rai, Kanti R; Byrd, John C; Kay, Neil E; Greaves, Andrew; Weiss, Arthur; Kipps, Thomas J\n\n2004-08-26\n\nThe course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is variable. In aggressive disease, the CLL cells usually express an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IgV(H)) and the 70-kD zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), whereas in indolent disease, the CLL cells usually express mutated IgV(H) but lack expression of ZAP-70. We evaluated the CLL B cells from 307 patients with CLL for ZAP-70 and mutations in the rearranged IgV(H) gene. We then investigated the association between the results and the time from diagnosis to initial therapy. We found that ZAP-70 was expressed above a defined threshold level in 117 of the 164 patients with an unmutated IgV(H) gene (71 percent), but in only 24 of the 143 patients with a mutated IgV(H) gene (17 percent, P<0.001). Among the patients with ZAP-70-positive CLL cells, the median time from diagnosis to initial therapy in those who had an unmutated IgV(H) gene (2.8 years) was not significantly different from the median time in those who had a mutated IgV(H) gene (4.2 years, P=0.07). However, the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in each of these groups was significantly shorter than the time in patients with ZAP-70-negative CLL cells who had either mutated or unmutated IgV(H) genes (P<0.001). The median time from diagnosis to initial therapy among patients who did not have ZAP-70 was 11.0 years in those with a mutated IgV(H) gene and 7.1 years in those with an unmutated IgV(H) gene (P<0.001). Although the presence of an unmutated IgV(H) gene is strongly associated with the expression of ZAP-70, ZAP-70 is a stronger predictor of the need for treatment in B-cell CLL.

CLL cells that expressed Î¶-chainâassociated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP-70) or that used unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes, each had a median expression level of miR-150 that was significantly lower than that of ZAP-70ânegative CLL cells or those that used mutated IGHV genes. In samples stratified for expression of miR-150, CLL cells with low-level miR-150 expressed relatively higher levels of forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) and GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1), genes with 3â² untranslated regions having evolutionary-conserved binding sites for miR-150. High-level expression of miR-150 could repress expression of these genes, which encode proteins that enhance B-cell receptor signaling, a putative CLL-growth/survival signal. Also, high-level expression of miR-150 was a significant independent predictor of longer treatment-free survival or overall survival, whereas an inverse association was observed for high-level expression of GAB1 or FOXP1 for overall survival. This study demonstrates that expression of miR-150 can influence the relative expression of GAB1 and FOXP1 and the signaling potential of the B-cell receptor, thereby possibly accounting for the noted association of expression of miR-150 and disease outcome.

The high complexity and diversity of the AIRR coupled with the limited amount of starting material, which can compromise identification of the full biological diversity makes such sequencing particularly challenging. AIRR sequencing protocols often fail to fully capture the sampled AIRR diversity, especially for samples containing restricted numbers of B lymphocytes. Here, we describe a library preparation method for immunoglobulin sequencing that results in an exhaustive full-length repertoire where virtually every sampled B-cell is sequenced. This maximizes the likelihood of identifying and quantifying the entire IGHV-D-J repertoire of a sample, including the detection of rearrangements present in only one cell in the starting population. The methodology establishes the importance of circumventing genetic material dilution in the preamplification phases and incorporates the use of certain described concepts: (1) balancing the starting material amount and depth of sequencing, (2) avoiding IGHV gene-specific amplification, and (3) using Unique Molecular Identifier. Together, this methodology is highly efficient, in particular for detecting rare rearrangements in the sampled population and when only a limited amount of starting material is available.\n\nPseudo-Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Presentation of a Crystal-Storing Histiocytosis With an Unmutated Monoclonal Îº Light Chain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAline-Fardin, Aude; Bender, Sebastien; Fabiani, Bettina; Buob, David; Brahimi, Said; Verpont, Marie Christine; Mothy, Mohamad; Ronco, Pierre; Boffa, Jean Jacques; Aucouturier, Pierre; Garderet, Laurent\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Crystal-storing histiocytosis (CSH) is a rare complication of monoclonal gammopathies caused by accumulation of crystalline material inside macrophages, and it may result in a variety of clinical manifestations depending on the involved organs. Although immunoglobulin Îº light chains (LCs) seem to be the most frequent pathogenic component, very few molecular data are currently available. A 69-year-old man presented with a very poor performance status. Remarkable features were mesenteric lymph node enlargement and proteinuria, including a monoclonal Îº LC. Light and electron microscopy studies revealed the presence of crystals within macrophages in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and kidney, leading to the diagnosis of CSH. The pathogenic Îº LC variable domain sequence was identical to the germline Vk3-20â01/Jk2â01 gene segments, without any somatic mutation, suggesting an extra-follicular B cell proliferation. The patient was successfully treated with 4 cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone. After a 12-month follow-up, he remains in hematological and renal remission. CSH may present as pseudo-peritoneal carcinomatosis and relate to a monoclonal Îº LC encoded by an unmutated gene. Bortezomib-based therapy proved efficacious in this case.

An issue remaining enigmatic in SHM is how AID is preferentially targeted during transcription to hypermutable bases in its substrates (WRC motifs) on both DNA strands. AID targets only single stranded DNA. By modelling the dynamical behaviour of IGHV3-23 DNA, a commonly used human variable gene segment, we observed that hypermutable bases on the non-transcribed strand are paired whereas those on transcribed strand are mostly unpaired. Hypermutable bases (both paired and unpaired) are made accessible to AID in stabilised secondary structures formed with increasing transcription levels. This observation provides a rationale for the hypermutable bases on both the strands of DNA being targeted to a similar extent despite having differences in unpairedness. We propose that increasing transcription and RNAP II stalling resulting in the formation and stabilisation of stem-loop structures with AID hotspots in negatively supercoiled region can localise the hypermutable bases of both strands of DNA, to AID-mediated SHM.\n\nA unique proteomic profile on surface IgM ligation in unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPerrot, Aurore; Pionneau, CÃ©dric; Nadaud, Sophie; Davi, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Leblond, VÃ©ronique; Jacob, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Merle-BÃ©ral, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Herbrecht, Raoul; BÃ©nÃ©, Marie-Christine; Gribben, John G.; Vallat, Laurent\n\n2011-01-01\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a highly variable clinical course with 2 extreme subsets: indolent, ZAP70â and mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (M-CLL); and aggressive, ZAP70+ and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain (UM-CLL). Given the long-term suspicion of antigenic stimulation as a primum movens in the disease, the role of the B-cell receptor has been extensively studied in various experimental settings; albeit scarcely in a comparative dynamic proteomic approach. Here we use a quantitative 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis technology to compare 48 proteomic profiles of the 2 CLL subsets before and after anti-IgM ligation. Differentially expressed proteins were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. We show that unstimulated M- and UM-CLL cells display distinct proteomic profiles. Furthermore, anti-IgM stimulation induces a specific proteomic response, more pronounced in the more aggressive CLL. Statistical analyses demonstrate several significant protein variations according to stimulation conditions. Finally, we identify an intermediate form of M-CLL cells, with an indolent profile (ZAP70â) but sharing aggressive proteomic profiles alike UM-CLL cells. Collectively, this first quantitative and dynamic proteome analysis of CLL further dissects the complex molecular pathway after B-cell receptor stimulation and depicts distinct proteomic profiles, which could lead to novel molecular stratification of the disease.

Abs generated during such responses are isotype switched and have a high affinity to the Ag because of somatic hypermutation of Ab genes. B cell responses to purified polysaccharides are T cell independent and do not result in the formation of bona fide germinal centers, and the dominant Ab isotype produced during such responses is IgM with very few or no somatic mutations. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for both somatic hypermutation and Ig isotype switching in humans and mice. To test the extent to which unmutated polysaccharide-specific IgM confers protective immunity, we immunized wildtype and AID -/- mice with either heat-killed Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi) or purified Vi polysaccharide (ViPS). We found that wildtype and AID -/- mice immunized with heat-killed S. Typhi generated similar anti-ViPS IgM responses. As expected, wildtype, but not AID -/- mice generated ViPS-specific IgG. However, the differences in the Ab-dependent killing of S. Typhi mediated by the classical pathway of complement activation were not statistically significant. In ViPS-immunized wildtype and AID -/- mice, the ViPS-specific IgM levels and S. Typhi bactericidal Ab titers at 7 but not at 28 d postimmunization were also comparable. To test the protective immunity conferred by these immunizations, mice were challenged with a chimeric S. Typhimurium strain expressing ViPS. Compared with their naive counterparts, immunized wildtype and AID -/- mice exhibited significantly reduced bacterial burden regardless of the route of infection. These data indicate that an unmutated IgM response to ViPS contributes to protective immunity to S. Typhi.

Here, we explored targeted re-sequencing as a novel strategy to assess the mutation status of genes with prognostic potential. To this end, we utilized HaloPlex targeted enrichment technology and designed a panel including nine genes: ATM, BIRC3, MYD88, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53, which have been linked to the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and KLHL6, POT1 and XPO1, which are less characterized but were found to be recurrently mutated in various sequencing studies. A total of 188 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with poor prognostic features (unmutated IGHV, n=137; IGHV3-21 subset #2, n=51) were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 and data were analyzed using well-established bioinformatics tools. Using a conservative cutoff of 10% for the mutant allele, we found that 114/180 (63%) patients carried at least one mutation, with mutations in ATM, BIRC3, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 accounting for 149/177 (84%) of all mutations. We selected 155 mutations for Sanger validation (variant allele frequency, 10-99%) and 93% (144/155) of mutations were confirmed; notably, all 11 discordant variants had a variant allele frequency between 11-27%, hence at the detection limit of conventional Sanger sequencing. Technical precision was assessed by repeating the entire HaloPlex procedure for 63 patients; concordance was found for 77/82 (94%) mutations. In summary, this study demonstrates that targeted next-generation sequencing is an accurate and reproducible technique potentially suitable for routine screening, eventually as a stand-alone test without the need for confirmation by Sanger sequencing.

They are essential to maintain chromosomal integrity and genome stability. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex containing an internal RNA template (hTR) and a catalytic subunit (hTERT). The human hTR gene consists of three major domains; among them the H/ACA domain is essential for telomere biogenesis. H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is composed of four evolutionary conserved proteins, including dyskerin (encoded by DKC1 gene), NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1. In this study, we have evaluated the expression profile of the H/ACA RNP complex genes: DKC1, NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1, as well as hTERT and hTR mRNA levels, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Results were correlated with the number and type of genetic alteration detected by conventional cytogenetics and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region) mutational status, telomere length (TL) and clinico-pathological characteristics of patients. Our results showed significant decreased expression of GAR1, NOP10, DKC1 and hTR, as well as increased mRNA levels of hTERT in patients compared to controls (pâ¤0.04). A positive correlation between the expression of GAR1-NHP2, GAR1-NOP10, and NOP10-NHP2 (p<0.0001), were observed. The analysis taking into account prognostic factors showed a significant increased expression of hTERT gene in unmutated-IGHV cases compared to mutated-CLL patients (p = 0.0185). The comparisons among FISH groups exhibited increased expression of DKC1 in cases with two or more alterations with respect to no abnormalities, trisomy 12 and del13q14, and of NHP2 and NOP10 compared to those with del13q14 (p = 0.03). The analysis according to TL showed a significant increased expression of hTERT (p = 0.0074) and DKC1 (p = 0.0036) in patients with short telomeres compared to those with long TL.

It never occurred as a sole abnormality and was associated with other changes (6q deletion; 1p gain). The region of 2p gain frequently included two oncogenes, REL and MYCN. All patients with gain of REL were unmutated for IGHV (p=0.03). Gain of MYCN was associated with increased mRNA expression (p=0.005), suggesting a pathogenic role for MYCN. Gain of 2p appears to be a marker of progression and may contribute to the poor prognosis. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Cells were separated into cytosol and membrane protein fractions then labeled with acid-cleavable ICAT reagents (cICAT). Labeled proteins were digested with trypsin then subjected to SCX and affinity chromatography followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. A total of 9 proteins from the cytosol fraction and 4 from the membrane fraction showed a 3-fold or greater difference between M-CLL and UM-CLL and a subset of these were examined by Western blot where results concurred with cICAT abundance ratios. The abundance of one of the proteins in particular, the mitochondrial membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit COX G was examined in 6 M-CLL and 6 UM-CLL patients using western blot and results showed significantly greater levels (P < 0.001) in M-CLL patients vs UM-CLL patients. These results demonstrate that stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry can complement 2D gel electrophoresis and gene microarray technologies for identifying putative and perhaps unique prognostic markers in CLL.\n\nAnalysis of the IgV(H) somatic mutations in splenic marginal zone lymphoma defines a group of unmutated cases with frequent 7q deletion and adverse clinical course.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlgara, Patricia; Mateo, Marisol S; Sanchez-Beato, Margarita; Mollejo, Manuela; Navas, Immaculada C; Romero, Lourdes; SolÃ©, Francesc; Salido, Marta; Florensa, Lourdes; MartÃ­nez, Pedro; Campo, Elias; Piris, Miguel A\n\n2002-02-15\n\nThis study aimed to correlate the frequency of somatic mutations in the IgV(H) gene and the use of specific segments in the V(H) repertoire with the clinical and characteristic features of a series of 35 cases of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). The cases were studied by seminested polymerase chain reaction by using primers from the FR1 and J(H) region. The results showed unexpected molecular heterogeneity in this entity, with 49% unmutated cases (less than 2% somatic mutations). The 7q31 deletions and a shorter overall survival were more frequent in this group. Additionally a high percentage (18 of 40 sequences) of SMZL cases showed usage of the V(H)1-2 segment, thereby emphasizing the singularity of this neoplasia, suggesting that this tumor derives from a highly selected B-cell population and encouraging the search for specific antigens that are pathogenically relevant in the genesis or progression of this tumor.\n\nComprehensive characterization of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRenÃ©, CÃ©line; Prat, Nathalie; Thuizat, Audrey; Broctawik, MÃ©lanie; Avinens, Odile; Eliaou, Jean-FranÃ§ois\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a geographical pattern of immunoglobulin rearrangement in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), which could be as a result of a genetic background or an environmental antigen. However, the characteristics of Ig rearrangements in the population from the South of France have not yet been established. Here, we studied CLL B-cell repertoire and mutational pattern in a Southern French cohort of patients using an in-house protocol for whole sequencing of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Described biased usage of variable, diversity and joining genes between the mutated and unmutated groups was found in our population. However, variable gene frequencies are more in accordance with those observed in the Mediterranean patients. We found that the third complementary-determining region (CDR) length was higher in unmutated sequences, because of bias in the diversity and joining genes usage and not due to the N diversity. Mutations found in CLL followed the features of canonical somatic hypermutation mechanism: preference of targeting for activation-induced cytidine deaminase and polymerase motifs, base change bias for transitions and more replacement mutations occurring in CDRs than in framework regions. Surprisingly, localization of activation-induced cytidine deaminase motifs onto the variable gene showed a preference for framework regions. The study of the characteristics at the age of diagnosis showed no difference in clinical outcome, but suggested a tendency of increased replacement and transition-over-transversion mutations and a longer third CDR length in older patients.

This bioinformatics framework allowed us to investigate alignments of heavy chain framework regions (FRHs) and the separate alignments of FRHs and heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRHs) to determine their germline origin in the four cattle breeds Aubrac, German Black Pied, German Simmental, and Holstein Friesian. Now it is also possible to specifically analyze Ig heavy chains possessing exceptionally long CDR3Hs. In order to gain more insight into breed specific differences in Ig combinatorial diversity, somatic hypermutations and putative gene conversions of IgG, we compared the dominantly transcribed variable (IGHV), diversity (IGHD), and joining (IGHJ) segments and their recombination in the four cattle breeds. The analysis revealed the use of 15 different IGHV segments, 21 IGHD segments, and two IGHJ segments with significant different transcription levels within the breeds. Furthermore, there are preferred rearrangements within the three groups of CDR3H lengths. In the sequences of group 2 (CDR3H lengths (L) of 11-47 amino acid residues (aa)) a higher number of recombination was observed than in sequences of group 1 (Lâ¤10 aa) and 3 (Lâ¥48 aa). The combinatorial diversity of germline IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ-segments revealed 162 rearrangements that were significantly different. The few preferably rearranged gene segments within group 3 CDR3H regions may indicate specialized antibodies because this length is unique in cattle. The most important finding of this study, which was enabled by using the bioinformatics framework, is the discovery of strong evidence for gene conversion as a rare event using pseudogenes fulfilling all definitions for this particular diversification mechanism.\n\nDevelopment of a Bioinformatics Framework for the Detection of Gene Conversion and the Analysis of Combinatorial Diversity in Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains in Four Cattle Breeds\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCzerny, Claus-Peter; KÃ¶nig, Sven; Diesterbeck, Ulrike S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe have developed a new bioinformatics framework for the analysis of rearranged bovine heavy chain immunoglobulin (Ig) variable regions by combining and refining widely used alignment algorithms.

The disease has an extremely variable clinical course, and several prognostic features have been identified to assess individual risk. The configuration of the immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain gene (IgV(H)) is a strong predictor of the outcome. CLL patients with unmutated IgV(H) status have an aggressive clinical course and a short survival. Unfortunately, analysis of IgV(H) gene configuration is not available in most clinical laboratories. A small number of genes are differentially expressed between unmutated IgV(H) and mutated IgV(H) clinical forms of CLL. One of these genes is ZAP-70, which is detected in leukemic cells from patients with the unmutated IgV(H) form of CLL. Flow cytometry presents advantages over other methods to detect ZAP-70, and its quantification by flow cytometry has proved its predictive value. This unit focuses on protocols to quantify ZAP-70 by flow cytometry in CLL.\n\nProduction of individualized V gene databases reveals high levels of immunoglobulin genetic diversity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCorcoran, Martin M.; Phad, Ganesh E.; Bernat, NÃ©stor VÃ¡zquez; Stahl-Hennig, Christiane; Sumida, Noriyuki; Persson, Mats A.

Previous work has shown expression in peripheral blood (PB) of CLL B cells of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) among CLL patients with an unmutated (UM) profile of immunoglobulin genes and with ongoing class switch recombination (CSR) process. Because AID expression results from interaction with activated tissue microenvironment, we speculated whether the small subset with ongoing CSR is responsible for high levels of AID expression and could be derived from this particular microenvironment. In this work, we quantified AID expression and ongoing CSR in PB of 50 CLL patients and characterized the expression of different molecules related to microenvironment interaction. Our results show that among UM patients (1) high AID expression is restricted to the subpopulation of tumoral cells ongoing CSR; (2) this small subset expresses high levels of proliferation, antiapoptotic and progression markers (Ki-67, c-myc, Bcl-2, CD49d, and CCL3/4 chemokines). Overall, this work outlines the importance of a cellular subset in PB of UM CLL patients with a poor clinical outcome, high AID levels, and ongoing CSR, whose presence might be a hallmark of a recent contact with the microenvironment.\n\nAnalysis of a Clonal Lineage of HIV-1 Envelope V2/V3 Conformational Epitope-Specific Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies and Their Inferred Unmutated Common Ancestors â¿ â\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBonsignori, Mattia; Hwang, Kwan-Ki; Chen, Xi; Tsao, Chun-Yen; Morris, Lynn; Gray, Elin; Marshall, Dawn J.; Crump, John A.; Kapiga, Saidi H.; Sam, Noel E.; Sinangil, Faruk; Pancera, Marie; Yongping, Yang; Zhang, Baoshan; Zhu, Jiang; Kwong, Peter D.; O'Dell, Sijy; Mascola, John R.; Wu, Lan; Nabel, Gary J.; Phogat, Sanjay; Seaman, Michael S.; Whitesides, John F.; Moody, M.

Since an elicitation of previously known broadly neutralizing antibodies has proven elusive, the induction of antibodies with such specificity is an important goal for HIV-1 vaccine development. A critical question is which immunogens and vaccine formulations might be used to trigger and drive the development of memory B cell precursors with V2/V3 conformational epitope specificity. In this paper we identified a clonal lineage of four V2/V3 conformational epitope broadly neutralizing antibodies (CH01 to CH04) from an African HIV-1-infected broad neutralizer and inferred their common reverted unmutated ancestor (RUA) antibodies. While conformational epitope antibodies rarely bind recombinant Env monomers, a screen of 32 recombinant envelopes for binding to the CH01 to CH04 antibodies showed monoclonal antibody (MAb) binding to the E.A244 gp120 Env and to chronic Env AE.CM243; MAbs CH01 and CH02 also bound to transmitted/founder Env B.9021. CH01 to CH04 neutralized 38% to 49% of a panel of 91 HIV-1 tier 2 pseudoviruses, while the RUAs neutralized only 16% of HIV-1 isolates. Although the reverted unmutated ancestors showed restricted neutralizing activity, they retained the ability to bind to the E.A244 gp120 HIV-1 envelope with an affinity predicted to trigger B cell development. Thus, E.A244, B.9021, and AE.CM243 Envs are three potential immunogen candidates for studies aimed at defining strategies to induce V2/V3 conformational epitope-specific antibodies.

As maturation history of B-cell is \"imprinted\" during B-cell development on the immunoglobulin gene sequence, we studied the structure and sequence of the variable part of the genes (IGHV, IGLV, IGKV), immunoglobulin surface expression and features of class switching in order to determine the PCLBCL-LT cell of origin. Clonality analysis with BIOMED2 protocol and VH leader primers was done on DNA extracted from frozen skin biopsies on retrospective samples from 14 patients. The clonal DNA IGHV sequence of the tumor was aligned and compared with the closest germline sequence and homology percentage was calculated. Superantigen binding sites were studied. Features of selection pressure were evaluated with the multinomial Lossos model. A functional monoclonal sequence was observed in 14 cases as determined for IGHV (10), IGLV (2) or IGKV (3). IGV mutation rates were high (>5%) in all cases but one (median:15.5%), with superantigen binding sites conservation. Features of selection pressure were identified in 11/12 interpretable cases, more frequently negative (75%) than positive (25%). Intraclonal variation was detected in 3 of 8 tumor specimens with a low rate of mutations. Surface immunoglobulin was an IgM in 12/12 cases. FISH analysis of IGHM locus, deleted during class switching, showed heterozygous IGHM gene deletion in half of cases. The genomic PCR analysis confirmed the deletions within the switch Î¼ region. IGV sequences were highly mutated but functional, with negative features of selection pressure suggesting one or more germinal center passage(s) with somatic hypermutation, but superantigen (SpA) binding sites conservation. Genetic features of class switch were observed, but on the non functional allele and co-existing with primary isotype IgM expression. These data suggest that cell-of origin is\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): a cohort study of newly diagnosed patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nParikh, Sameer A; Rabe, Kari G; Call, Timothy G; Zent, Clive S; Habermann, Thomas M; Ding, Wei; Leis, Jose F; Schwager, Susan M; Hanson, Curtis A; Macon, William R; Kay, Neil E; Slager, Susan L; Shanafelt, Tait D\n\n2013-09-01\n\nNearly all information about patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who develop diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [Richter syndrome (RS)] is derived from retrospective case series or patients treated on clinical trials. We used the Mayo Clinic CLL Database to identify patients with newly diagnosed CLL between January 2000 and July 2011. Individuals who developed biopsy-proven RS during follow-up were identified. After a median follow-up of 4 years, 37/1641 (2Â·3%) CLL patients developed RS. The rate of RS was approximately 0Â·5%/year. Risk of RS was associated with advanced Rai stage at diagnosis (P < 0Â·001), high-risk genetic abnormalitites on fluorescence in situ hybridization (P < 0Â·0001), unmutated IGHV (P = 0Â·003), and expression of ZAP70 (P = 0Â·02) and CD38 (P = 0Â·001). The rate of RS doubled in patients after treatment for CLL (1%/year). Stereotyped B-cell receptors (odds-ratio = 4Â·2; P = 0Â·01) but not IGHV4-39 family usage was associated with increased risk of RS. Treatment with combination of purine analogues and alkylating agents increased the risk of RS three-fold (odds-ratio = 3Â·26, P = 0Â·0003). Median survival after RS diagnosis was 2Â·1 years. The RS prognosis score stratified patients into three risk groups with median survivals of 0Â·5 years, 2Â·1 years and not reached. Both underlying characteristics of the CLL clone and subsequent CLL therapy influence the risk of RS. Survival after RS remains poor and new therapies are needed.

We examined whether IL-4-mediated growth, as measured by 4PS phosphorylation, and gene induction were similarly controlled. Studies of M12.4.1 cells expressing human IL-4R truncation mutants indicated that the region between amino acids 557-657 is necessary for full gene expression, which correlated with Stat6 DNA binding activity. This region was not required for 4PS phosphorylation. Tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations in the interval between amino acids 557-657 revealed that as long as one tyrosine remained unmutated, CD23 was fully induced. When all three tyrosines were mutated, the receptor was unable to induce CD23. The results indicate that growth regulation and gene expression are principally controlled by distinct regions of IL-4R.\n\nAnalysis of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable genes in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nCapello, Daniela; Cerri, Michaela; Muti, Giuliana; Lucioni, Marco; Oreste, Pierluigi; Gloghini, Annunziata; Berra, Eva; Deambrogi, Clara; Franceschetti, Silvia; Rossi, Davide; Alabiso, Oscar; Morra, Enrica; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Carbone, Antonino; Paulli, Marco; Gaidano, Gianluca\n\n2006-12-01\n\nPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) derive from antigen-experienced B-cells and represent a major complication of solid organ transplantation. We characterized usage, mutation frequency and mutation pattern of immunoglobulin variable (IGV) gene rearrangements in 50 PTLD (polymorphic PTLD, n=10; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, n=35; and Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma, n=5). Among PTLD yielding clonal IGV amplimers, a functional IGV heavy chain (IGHV) rearrangement was found in 40/50 (80.0%) cases, whereas a potentially functional IGV light chain rearrangement was identified in 36/46 (78.3%) PTLD. By combining IGHV and IGV light chain rearrangements, 10/50 (20.0%) PTLD carried crippling mutations, precluding expression of a functional B-cell receptor (BCR). Immunohistochemistry showed detectable expression of IG light chains in only 18/43 (41.9%) PTLD. Failure to detect a functional IGV rearrangement associated with lack of IGV expression. Our data suggest that a large fraction of PTLD arise from germinal centre (GC)-experienced B-cells that display impaired BCR. Since a functional BCR is required for normal B-cell survival during GC transit, PTLD development may implicate rescue from apoptosis and expansion of B-cells that have failed the GC reaction. The high frequency of IGV loci inactivation appears to be a peculiar feature of PTLD among immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferations.\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia patients exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl NPP accident--with focus on immunoglobulin heavy chain gene analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbramenko, Iryna; Bilous, Nadia; Chumak, Anatoliy; Davidova, Ekaterina; Kryachok, Iryna; Martina, Zoya; Nechaev, Stanislav; Dyagil, Iryna; Bazyka, Dmytriy; Bebeshko, Vladimir\n\n2008-04-01\n\nClinical data and immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) gene configuration were analyzed in 47 CLL patients, exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) due to Chernobyl NPP accident, and 141 non-exposed patients. Clean-up workers of the second quarter of 1986 (n=19) were picked out as separate group with the highest number of unmutated cases (94.4%), increased usage of IgVH1-69 (33.3%) and IgVH3-21 (16.7%) genes, high frequency of secondary solid tumors (6 cases) and Richter transformation (4 cases). These preliminary data suggest that CLL in the most suffered contingent due to Chernobyl NPP accident might have some specific features.\n\nBiological and clinical characterization of recurrent 14q deletions in CLL and other mature B-cell neoplasms.\n\nPubMed\n\nReindl, Lena; Bacher, Ulrike; Dicker, Frank; Alpermann, Tamara; Kern, Wolfgang; Schnittger, Susanne; Haferlach, Torsten; Haferlach, Claudia\n\n2010-10-01\n\n14q-deletions have been repeatedly described in mature B-cell neoplasms, but not yet characterized in a larger cohort. Based on chromosome banding analysis, the present study identified 47 del(14q) cases in 3054 mature B-cell neoplasms (1Â·5%) (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [CLL]: 1Â·9%; CLL/prolymphocytic leukaemia [PL]: 9Â·0%; others: 0Â·2%). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed with probes for 14q22.1, 14q24.1, 14q32.33, and IGH@ (14q32.3). The del(14q) had heterogeneous size but showed a breakpoint cluster at the centromeric site in 14q24.1 (62% of cases). At the telomeric side, the most frequent breakpoint was within the IGH@ locus (14q32.3) between IGH@ 3'-flanking and IGHV (IgVH) probes (45%). In 16 cases (34%), breakpoints occurred within 14q24.1 and 14q32.3. Eighty-one percent of del(14q) cases showed 1-3 additional cytogenetic alterations (in 45%, +12), and 56% were IGHV-unmutated. In all cases (16/16) with breakpoints in 14q24.1 and 14q32.3, a B-CLL immunophenotype was found. Clinical follow-up in 32 del(14q) patients was compared to 383 CLL and CLL/PL patients without del(14q). While 3-year-overall survival did not differ significantly, time to treatment was significantly shorter in the del(14q) cohort (21Â·0 months vs. 80Â·1 months, P = 0Â·015). In conclusion, the del(14q) is a rare recurrent alteration in diverse mature B-cell neoplasms, shows variable size but distinct clustering of breakpoints, and is associated with short time to treatment.

DNA sequencing experiments have shown that about 30% of CLL patients have stereotyped antigen-specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) with a high level of sequence homology in the variable domains of the heavy and light chains. These include many of the most aggressive cases that haveIGHV-unmutated BCRs whose sequences have not diverged significantly from the germ line. This suggests a personalized therapy strategy in which a toxin or immune effector function is delivered selectively to the pathogenic B-cells but not to healthy B-cells. To execute this strategy, serum-stable, drug-like compounds able to target the antigen-binding sites of most or all patients in a stereotyped subset are required. We demonstrate here the feasibility of this approach with the discovery of selective, high affinity ligands for CLL BCRs of the aggressive, stereotyped subset 7P that cross-react with the BCRs of several CLL patients in subset 7p, but not with BCRs from patients outside this subset.
