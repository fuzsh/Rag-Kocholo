List (all ITF/Red Rooster unless otherwise specified):\n\nAlghera Pro (1996): hand-printed, based on a handwritten Portuguese wine label design.\n\nAlys (1995): Calligraphic.\n\nAppleyard (1992): based on an old Monotype design, Prumyslava.\n\nBadger (1992): comic book style. In 2010, this was Steve Jackaman and Ashley Muir as Badger Pro.\n\nBasset, Basset Five, Basset Four, Basset One, Basset Six, Basset Three (1997): headline family.\n\nBellini (1992): a garalde typeface based on Progreso (1923, Richard Gans Foundry). See Veer, where the font is sold as \"Bellini\". Linotype sells Greco (DsgnHaus, 1996) which according to some typophiles really is Progreso.\n\nByron (1992, by Paul and Pat Hickson): a calligraphic font originally cut in the 1980s for QBF based on a design in Printing Types of the World (1931, Pitmans). Later redone in digial form as LDN Piccadilly (2019) at London Type.\n\nColiseum (1992, ITF), co-designed with Julie Hopwood. Steve Jackaman completely redesigned, redrew, and improved the Coliseum family in 2017 and called it Coliseum Pro. That redesign also produced the sister typefaces Clydesdale and Torpedo.\n\nDundee, Dundee Condensed (1993), inspired by the various headlines used in children's comic books in England, published by D.C. Thompson of Dundee, Scotland.\n\nErasmus (1992): based on a design of Sjoerd Hendrik de Roos, 1923, Amsterdam Foundry.\n\nForum Titling (1994): based on the Frederick Goudy design first shown in 1912, which was produced as a foundry typeface by Lanston Monotype in 1924.\n\nGilmore Fahrenheit and Gilmore Sans (1992): ugly typefaces based on Eric Gill designs.\n\nGrove Script (1992).\n\nJavelin (1994): a connected fifties diner typeface in the style of Continental Railway Magneto Bold, Parkway Hotel, Permanent Waves, and Raceway.\n\nITC Mona Lisa (ITC, 1992, and Elsner&Flake, 1991), ITC Mona Lisa Recut (ITC, 1991): an interpretation of a 1930 tall modern type by Albert Auspurg for Ludwig&Mayer.\n\nRivoli Initials. Based on the William T. Sniffin design for ATF, circa 1928.\n\nRoller, Roller Shadow (1997): based on Iberica by Carlos Winkow for Fundicion Nacional, ca. 1942.\n\nSinclair Script (1992).\n\nStirling (1992).\n\nVenezuela (2000, Red Rooster) is a decorative Mexican simulation font based on the typeface Vesta by Albert Auspurg, circa 1926.\n\nHeseltine (2014) was designed by Paul & Pat Hickson in Text & Titling weights. The Heseltine typeface family was originally produced as a gift from Haymarket Media Group to Lord Heseltine for his 75th birthday.\n\nLondon Belgravia (2019, by Paul and Pat Hickson). An art deco sans.\n\nWith Paul Hickson, she designed the floriated initial caps font LDN Garamond Initials (2020), which accompanies Paul's LDN Garamond (2020), which is a faithful revival of Claude Garamond's typeface.\n\nMyFonts link. FontShop link. Klingspor link. [Google] [MyFonts] [More] ⦿\n\nA Survey of Free Math Fonts for TeX and LaTeX\n\n[Stephen G. Hartke]\n\nArticle by Stephen Hartke from Urbana, IL, written in 2006. He surveys free math fonts for TeX and LaTeX, with examples, instructions for using LaTeX packages for changing fonts, and links to sources for the fonts and packages. PDF version of the paper. Hartke is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nHe finished a font family called Aurulent Sans and Aurulent Sans Mono (2007), and released the free monospaced font Verily Serif Mono (2006, based on Vera Serif, with same dimensions as Vera Sans Mono). Fontsy link. Alternate URL. Yet another URL. Twentyfour examples of text face/math typeface are showcased. Some are quite disappointing. Here are the better ones (with some text quoted from Hartke's article):\n\nComputer Modern (by Don Knuth), still my favorite. Type 1 versions of Computer Modern from Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. have been made freely available by the American Mathematical Society (AMS). Basil K. Malyshev has also released a free Type 1 version of Computer Modern, the BaKoMa fonts. Computer Modern has been extended to include more characters, particularly for non-English European languages. These fonts include European Computer Modern by Jörg Knappen and Norbert Schwarz (METAFONT only), Tt2001 by Peter Szabó (converted into Type 1 format from METAFONT sources using textrace), CM-Super by Vladimir Volovich (also converted using textrace); and Latin Modern by Bogusaw Jackowski and Janusz M. Nowacki (extended from the Blue Sky AMS fonts using MetaType1).\n\nConcrete text with Euler math, or Concrete text with Concrete math. The Concrete font was created by Knuth for his book Concrete Mathematics. Hermann Zapf was commissioned by the AMS to create the math font Euler for use in Concrete Mathematics. Type 1 versions of Concrete in T1 encoding are available in the CM-Super collection, and Type 1 versions of Euler are available in the Blue Sky collection from the AMS and in the BaKoMa collection. The eulervm package by Walter Schmidt implements virtual fonts for Euler that are more efficient to use with LaTeX. Ulrik Vieth created the Concrete Math fonts to match the Concrete text fonts; the only early free versions are implemented in METAFONT. The ccfonts package by Walter Schmidt changes the text font to Concrete and changes the math font to the Concrete Math fonts if eulervm is not loaded. Note that Concrete Text has no bold, but the Computer Modern Bold does just fine for that. However, in 2022, Daniel Flipo developed a free OpenType font based on Vieth's Metafont, also called Concrete Math.\n\nAntykwa Poltawskiego text and Computer Modern Math. J. M. Nowacki created the font Antykwa Poltawskiego using the MetaType1 system based on a typeface by Polish typographer Adam Poltawski.\n\nAntykwa Toru&nacute;ska text and math. Antykwa Toru&nacute;ska was created by J. M. Nowacki using the MetaType1 system based on a typeface by the Polish typographer Zygfryd Gardzielewski. The package anttor has complete math support in both TeX and LaTeX.\n\nKerkis text and math. Kerkis was created by Antonis Tsolomitis by extending URW Bookman L to include Greek and additional Latin characters. The resulting fonts are stand-alone and can be used by applications outside of TeX. A font of math symbols is included, but not used by the LaTeX package. The package kmath uses txfonts for math symbols and uppercase Greek letters.\n\nNew Century Schoolbook with Millennial math. New Century Schoolbook with Fourier math. The Millennial math font by Stephen Hartke contains Greek letters and other letter-like mathematical symbols. A set of virtual fonts is provided that uses New Century Schoolbook for Latin letters in math, Millennial for Greek and other letter-like symbols, and txfonts and Computer Modern for all other symbols, including binary operators, relations, and large symbols. This font is still in development, but will hopefully be released in 2006. The fouriernc package of Michael Zedler uses New Century Schoolbook for text and Latin letters in mathematics, and the Greek and symbol fonts from the Fourier-GUTenberg package for the remaining mathematical symbols.\n\nPalatino and pxfonts, Pazo, or mathpple for math symbols. Young Ryu created the pxfonts collection, which contains Greek and other letter-like symbols, as well as a complete set of geometric symbols, including the AMS symbols. Diego Puga created the Pazo math fonts, which include the Greek letters and other letter-like symbols in a style that matches Palatino. The LaTeX package mathpazo (now part of PSNFSS) uses Palatino for Latin letters, Pazo for Greek and other letter-like symbols, and Computer Modern for geometric symbols. The LaTeX package mathpple (also part of PSNFSS) uses Palatino for Latin letters and slanted Euler for Greek and other symbols. Since Hermann Zapf designed both Palatino and Euler, the designs mesh well. An alternate use of Euler is using the eulervm package. Ralf Stubner added small caps and old-style figures to URW Palladio L in the FPL package, and Walter Schmidt extended these fonts in the FPL Neu package.\n\nUtopia and Fourier or Math Design. Utopia was donated by Adobe for use with X Windows. Michel Bovani created Fourier-GUTenberg as an accompaniment to Utopia and is very complete, containing both Greek letters and standard and AMS symbols. The Math Design fonts for Utopia of Paul Pichaureau are also very complete, including Greek letters and AMS symbols.\n\nCharter and Math Design. Or URW Garamond and Math Design. Charter was donated by Bitstream for use with X Windows. The Math Design fonts for Charter created by Paul Pichaureau are very complete, including Greek letters, symbols from Computer Modern, and the AMS symbols. Charis SIL might be an alternate source for Greek letters that match Charter more closely. Another possibility for a math font is to use the Euler fonts with the charter and eulervm packages. URW Garamond No. 8 is available under the Aladdin Free Public License as part of the GhostPCL project. The Math Design fonts for URW Garamond created by Paul Pichaureau are very complete, including Greek letters, symbols from Computer Modern, and the AMS symbols.\n\nTimes or Omega Serif, and txfonts, Belleek, mathptmx, or mbtimes. Young Ryu created the txfonts collection, which contains Greek and other letter-like symbols, as well as a complete set of geometric symbols, including the AMS symbols. The txfonts package also includes a very nice typewriter font, txtt. Belleek was created by Richard Kinch and is a drop-in replacement for the commercial fonts required by the mathtime package (now part of PSNFSS). The LaTeX package mathptmx (also part of PSNFSS) uses Times for Latin letters and Symbol for Greek and other symbols. Michel Bovani created the mbtimes package by using Omega Serif for text and Latin and Greek letters in mathematics. mbtimes also includes symbol fonts and a set of calligraphic letters. Omega Serif is the primary font for Omega, a 16-bit extension of TeX by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous. The STIX fonts project is a collaboration of several academic publishers to create a set of Times-compatible fonts containing every possible glyph needed for mathematical and technical publishing. These fonts are still in development, with a scheduled release in the middle of 2006. Note: When Adobe introduced Postscript in 1984, they defined 35 core fonts (in 10 typefaces) that must be present in all Postscript interpreters. In 1996, URW++ released a replacement set for the core fonts under the GNU General Public License. The URW++ fonts were primarily released for use with Ghostscript, a free Postscript interpreter. For example, Times is Nimbus Roman No. 9 L, Palatino is URW Palladio L, New Century Schoolbook is Century Schoolbook L and Symbol is Standard Symbols L.\n\nKlingspor link. Dafont link.

It is headquartered in New York City. The digital typefaces are managed and executed by Charles Nix. There are two type families, Augereau (a garalde in 13 styles) and Abrams Venetian (a Venetian in 6 styles).\n\nAbrams Venetian was designed in 1989 based on Nicolas Jenson's renaissance letterforms, but was not available until ten years later.\n\nAugereau was designed and released by George Abrams in 1997.

Poster by Dayne Petera. [Google] [More] ⦿\n\nAdobe Systems Inc\n\nThe company that changed typesetting by the introduction of PostScript and type 1 fonts. Adobe Systems, based in San Jose, California, was started by John Warnock and Chuck Geschke in 1982. In 1999 it became a billion dollar company. The success of the PostScript graphics programming language, a printing industry standard since the mid-1980s, explains its early success. The company grew thanks to other popular products such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and thanks to the introduction of the PDF format for document. Sumner Stone was the Director of Typography from 1984 to 1991. He initiated Adobe's design program, where classic fonts (including Garamond and Caslon) were revived by type designers such as Robert Slimbach, Carol Twombly, and others. New type designs such as Minion and Myriad saw the light. The Adobe type design group was later headed by David Lemon, with the help of Thomas Phinney. Other gems in the Adobe arsenal include the PostScript Type 3 format, which permit designers to use programming tools (loops and calculations) to show typefaces. This font format was dropped after a decade (although one can still use it in PostScript programs) because ATM, Adobe's Type Manager for screens, cannot ghandle them. The Multiple Master format, which allows an infinite number of fonts to be interpolated between a set of master designs was also promising. It too was dropped in 1999 after about a decade.\n\nAdobe Fonts at Type Network.\n\nCatalog of Adobe fonts in order of popularity. Catalog of fonts in alphabetical order [large web page warning].

His typefaces were all designed and cut by the brilliant Francesco Griffo, a punchcutter who created the first roman type cut from study of classical Roman capitals. Bembo, Cloister Italic and Poliphilus [aka Aldus Manutius' Roman] can be traced back to him. Example of his Italian Antiqua, 1499.\n\nKevin Steele explains in 1996: Some sources cite the publication of Cardinal Bembo's De Aetna as 1493 or 1495. And in fact, the design continued to evolve until the 1499 publishing of the spectacular Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. Let's not split hairs. Let's celebrate 500 years of Bembo! In the mid fifteenth century printing quickly spread to Italy from Germany, and by the 1470's Venice had became the center of the printing industry, home to over 100 printing companies. Pioneers such as Erhard Ratdolt and Nicolas Jenson had already begun working on adapting the roman alphabet for metal type by the time Aldus Manutius established his press in 1494, with the intention of publishing all the Greek classics. Aldus Manutius (1450-1515) was a printer, entrepreneur, a great ego, and publisher of over 1200 titles. Among the many contributions of Aldus was the popularization of small, portable books. His expensive beautiful books were far from today's paperbacks, mind you. One of the many great talents working for Aldus was Francesco Griffo, a gifted type designer. Griffo created many innovative type designs that are still admired for their beauty and readability. Their collaboration broke up over a copyright dispute, primarily over the ownership of the cursive type typeface that Griffo developed under the direction of Aldus. Although Aldus even had a papal decree to protect this style of alphabet, it was as difficult then as it is now to protect a typeface design. The alphabet was widely copied, and the style is known as italic, after its country of origin.\n\nDigital typefaces derived from his work: 1501 Manutius (2001) by Klaus-Peter Schäffel.\n\nSelection of fonts based on Manutius's work.

TypoBrand writes: Reinterpreted and carefully crafted, the ATF Collection offers more weights and widths, expanded character sets, and robust typographic features in type designs beautifully suited to modern use and media. From the printed page to the screen, the new ATF Collection brings a tradition of typographic richness to the digital era. Their typefaces:\n\nATF Alternate Gothic (2015, Mark van Bronkhorst, Alan Dague-Greene, David Sudweeks, Igino Marini, & Ben Kiel). ATF Alternate Gothic is a new, significant digital expansion to 40 fonts of Morris Fuller Benton's classic 1903 design.\n\nATF Brush (2015). In five weights, this classic brush face is based on ATF Brush by Robert E. Smith, American Type Founders, 1942.\n\nATF Garamond (2015, Mark van Bronkhorst, Igino Marini, & Ben Kiel). An 18-style family based on the Garamond designed between 1918 and 1923 by Morris Fuller Benton and Thomas M. Cleland. ATF Garamond was first released in roman and italic styles around 1918, drawn by Morris Fuller Benton, head of the American Type Founders design department. In 1922, Thomas M.

Thirty fonts in all!\n\nATF Railroad Gothic (2016, Mark van Bronkhorst, Luis Batlle, Igino Marini, & Ben Kiel). The designers write: First introduced by the American Type Founders Company in 1906, Railroad Gothic was the quintessential typographic expression of turn-of-the-century industrial spirit---bold and brash in tone, and a little rough around the edges. A favorite for the plain speak of big headlines, Railroad Gothic quickly gained popularity among printers. Its condensed but robust forms were likely a source of inspiration for later families of industrial sans serifs. The ATF original was extended with four new weights.\n\nATF Wedding Gothic (2015, Mark van Bronkhorst, Luis Batlle, Igino Marini, & Ben Kiel). An 18-font engravers gothic based on an original from ca. 1901.\n\nATF Franklin Gothic (2019, Mark van Bronkhorst, Igino Marini, & Ben Kiel).

The history of all fonts used and produced by Cupertino, CA-based Apple. A brief summary of this:\n\nCorporate fonts and brand identity\n\nMotter Tektura (designed by Othmar Motter of Voralberger Graphic in 1975): before the first Macintosh, Apple used Motter Tektura to accompany the Apple logo. \"According to the logo designer, Rob Janoff, the typeface was selected for its playful qualities and techno look, in line with Apple's mission statement of making high-technology accessible to anyone.\"\n\nApple Garamond, the new corporate font used when the Macintosh was introduced in 1984. ITC Garamond (Tony Stan, 1977) was condensed to 80% of its normal width by Bitstream, who also adjusted and hinted it. Apple Garamond was used in most of Apple's marketing. The Wikipedia comment: \"Many typographers consider ITC Garamond in general, and Apple Garamond in particular, to be poorly designed typefaces. A common viewpoint is that the algorithmic scaling distorted the typeface.\"\n\nMyriad Pro: starting in 2002, Apple began using Myriad Pro Semibold (a sans serif face) in its marketing, gradually replacing Apple Garamond. MyriadPro and MyriadApple can be downloaded here.\n\nGill Sans Regular: used in the marketing of the Newton PDA.\n\nFonts of the original Macintosh All but one of these bitmap fonts were due to Susan Kare. The fonts were originally named after stops along the Paoli, Pennsylvania commuter train line: Overbrook, Merion, Ardmore, and Rosemont. Later, under pressure from Steve Jobs, names of world cities were chosen. A number of different variants of each font were algorithmically generated on-the-fly from the standard fonts. Bold, italic, outlined, underlined and shaded variations were the most common.\n\nCairo: a bitmap dingbat font, most famous for the dogcow at the 'z' character position.\n\nChicago (sans-serif): the default Macintosh system font in System 17.6.\n\nGeneva (sans-serif): designed for small point sizes and prevalent in all versions of the Mac user interface.\n\nLondon (blackletter): an Old English-style font.\n\nLos Angeles (script): a thin font that emulated handwriting.\n\nMonaco (sans-serif, monospaced): a fixed-width font well-suited for 912 pt use.\n\nNew York (serif): a Times Roman-inspired font family. Freely avaliable from Apple.\n\nSan Francisco: a ransom note face.\n\nVenice (script): a calligraphic font designed by Bill Atkinson.\n\nFonts in Mac OS X\n\nLucida Grande: the primary system font in Mac OS X (all versions). Lucida Grande looks like Lucida Sans, but has more glyphs. It covers Roman, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai and Greek. Many of its 2800+ glyphs were added by Michael Everson to the original collection.\n\nMac OS X ships with a number of high-quality typefaces, for a number of different scripts, licensed from several sources.\n\nLastResort (designed by Michael Everson of Evertype): used by the system to display reference glyphs in the event that real glyphs needed to display a given character are not found in any other available font. Wikipedia states: \"The glyphs are square with rounded corners with a bold outline. In the left and right sides of the outline, the Unicode range that the character belongs to is given using hexadecimal digits. Top and bottom are used for one or two descriptions of the Unicode block name. A symbol representative of the block is centered inside the square. By Everson's design, the typeface used for the text cut-outs in the outline is Chicago, otherwise not included with Mac OS X. The LastResort font has been part of Mac OS since version 8.5, but the limited success of ATSUI on the classic Mac OS means that only users of Mac OS X are regularly exposed to it.\"\n\nApple Symbols (2003-2006): a 4000+-glyph dingbat font that complements the symbols from Lucida Grande, inttroduced first in Mac OS X 10.3 (\"Panther\").\n\nZapfino (a calligraphic typeface designed by and named after renowned typeface designer Hermann Zapf for Linotype, based on an example he first drew in 1944): Zapfino utilizes the most advanced typographic features of the truetype format, and is partially included in OS X as a technology demo for ligatures and character substitutions.\n\nMac OS X Snow Leopard comes with four new fonts in 2009: Chalkduster (emulating chalk on a blackboard), Menlo (a monospaced family based on Bitstream's Vera Sans Mono that replaces Monaco for applications such as Terminal and code editors; see also Deja Vu Sans Serif Mono), Heiti SC and TC and Hiragino Sans GB.\n\nFonts used in other devices\n\nEspy Sans: designed in 1993 by Apple's Human Interface Group designed the typeface Espy Sans specifically for on-screen use. It was first used for the Newton OS GUI and later integrated into Apple's eWorld online service.\n\neWorld Tight: a bitmap font used for headlines in Apple's eWorld. The metrics of eWorld Tight were based on Helvetica Ultra Compressed.\n\nChicago (see above): bitmap typeface used in Apple's iPod music player since 2001.\n\nThe Apple Design team won two awards at 25 TDC in 2022, pne for SF Arabic (a contemporary interpretation of the Naskh style with a rational and flexible design; this extension of San Francisco serves as the Arabic system font on Apple platforms.

The original is by Venetian Francesco Griffo (1495), created for use in printing De Aetna by Cardinal Pietro Bembo. The cursive is attributed to Giovanantonio Tagliente (1524). Stanley Morison made a metal version at Monotype in 1929.\n\nUlrich Stiehl says: Bembo recuts sold today by Monotype, Adobe, and Linotype, have short ascenders (b, d, f, k, l) so that the spirit of freedom expressed by this Renaissance typeface gets lost. We offer here a few type specimens of former recuts of the Bembo which was used for the first time in the Latin book \"De Aetna\" written by \"Petrus Bembus\" (= Pietro Bembo). You can find gifs in this link of the following: Bembo, hand-composition foundry type (Germany, 1963), Monotype hot-metal composition Bembo (England, 1973), Monotype composition Bembo (Germany, year unknown), Berthold photocomposition Bembo with long ascenders (Germany, 1985), Bembo-Antiqua Series 270 Monotype in all type sizes from 4 pt to 72 pt (Germany, 1966).\n\nFor digital versions, see Monotype Bembo. Bembo Book was released by Monotype in 2005. Bitstream's Aldine 401 is a Bembo look-alike. Other digital typefaces include fbb (2014, a free font by Michael Sharpe on the CTAN site), Bemtus (URW), Bamberg Serial (SoftMaker) and Bergamo (SoftMaker).\n\nMac McGrew writes: Bembo was cut in 1929 by the English Monotype corporation under the direction of Stanley Morison, and shortly thereafter by Lanston Monotype in America. It derives from the first roman type used by Aldus Manutius in the dialogue De Aetna, by Pietro Bembo, printed in Venice in 1495. Punches were cut by Francesco Griffo of Bologna, the designer responsible four years later for the first italic types. This typeface is probably the most popular and successful of the numerous typefaces revived by Morison as typographic adviser to the English company. Morison attributed its success to the fact that \"it was inspired not by writing but by engraving; not script but sculpture.\" The italic is adapted from a 1524 typeface of Giovanni Taglienti, and has a natural grace of its own. English Monotype also made Bembo Bold and Bembo Bold Italic.\n\nPoster by Arturo Gil. Poster by Agustina Fernandez (2013).

He also worked with Ken Botnick at emdash. He runs Typefounding, a typeface design and production studio in St. Louis, Missouri. He teaches at Washington University in St. Louis and the Type@Cooper certificate program at Cooper Union, and has taught at the Maryland Institute College of Art and the University of Delaware. He is a partner at XYZ Type with Jesse Ragan.\n\nHe designed Katje and Cimarron (2005, University of Reading, a serif family with support for Latin and Greek). Speaker at ATypI 2006 in Lisbon on Python scripts for FontLab and RoboFab. Image.\n\nIn 2011, Vincent Pacella, Ben Kiel and Adam Cruz created the fat slab serif face Goliath, based on Film No. 6206 in the PhotoLettering archive. West Barnum Ultra, designed by Dave West and digitized by Ben Kiel&Adam Cruz in 2011, was film no. 5494 in the original Photo-Lettering archive.\n\nAt House Industries, he redesigned the iconic Rea Irvin lettering for The New Yorker in September 2013. The typefaces are named New Yorker Irvin and New Yorker Neutraface. In 2012 at House Industries he revived the Photo Lettering Inc font Worthe Numerals, which pushed fat didone to its limits.\n\nStill at House Industries, Christian Schwartz, Mitja Miklavcic and Ben Kiel co-developed Yorklyn Stencil.\n\nCortado Script (2014) was designed by Jesse Ragan and Ben Kiel. It was inspired by Swedish illustrator's Cecilia Carlstedt's hand-painted lettering. It follows one year after a similar signage script typeface, Carlstedt Script (2013), also co-designed by Jesse Ragan and Ben Kiel---it was a custom signage typeface for Aldo Shoes.\n\nIn 2015, Mark van Bronkhorst set up TypoBrand LLC in Berkeley, CA. As part of TypoBrand, he published several typefaces that are modern digital reinterpretations of ATF typefaces. The collection is published by TypoBrand LLC under the names ATF Type or American Type Founders Collection. Ben Kiel co-designed, sometimes with others, classics such as ATF Alternate Gothic (2015), ATF Brush (2015), ATF Egyptian Antique (an expansion of Schraubstadter's Rockwell Antique by Mark van Bronkhorst, Igino Marini, and Ben Kiel), ATF Railroad Gothic (2016), ATF Garamond (2015), ATF Headline Gothic (2015), ATF Livermore Script (by Mark van Bronkhorst, Igino Marini, and Ben Kiel), ATF Poster Gothic (2015) and ATF Wedding Gothic (2015).\n\nAt XYZ Type, Ben Kiel co-designed Cortado Script in 2013 with Jesse Ragan and designed the sans typeface Grep (2017).\n\nIn 2019, Ben Kiel participated in the development of ATF Franklin Gothic (Mark van Bronkhorst, Igino Marini, and Ben Kiel). A broad and multi-weight interpretation of Morris Fuller Benton's classic from 1905, Franklin Gothic, which only had bolder weights. For the lighter styles, the designers were inspired by Benton's Monotone Gothic.\n\nGirard Sky (2019) is based on Alexander Girard's original typeface for his redesign of Braniff Airways. Working with the original drawings for the photoset typeface found in the Girard archive, the design was revived as part of the Alexander Girard collection.

I feel these are the true winners---unlike all those awards for which one has to apply, pay a fee and be subject to the scrutiny of a \"selection committee\". Masterfully brought to you by Stephen Coles---bravo! As Stephen himself notes this year (2005), there are three trends: (1) Gone are the days when large commercial outfits put out the bulk of serious type. Nine of the 14 top selections come from one-man studios. Meanwhile, several of the big boys (ITC, Linotype, Monotype, URW) are absent. (2) Nearly every featured font is available in OpenType, and many exclusively so. (3) Xavier Dupré: the Cambodia-based Frenchman is perhaps todays most productive single source of creative type design, rivaled only by Christian Schwartz. Drumrolls:\n\nLisboa (Ricardo Santos): Hrant Papazian writes: Lisboa harbors the sagacity to merely vie for — and thereby achieve — a simple Iberian warmth, something especially difficult in a sans. In the severely over-crowded field of humanist sans-serifs, Lisboa distinguishes itself through completeness (including expert characters and two numeral styles) and technical sophistication (as in its trapping), but mostly by providing two subtly varied cuts: one that helps exhibit the design's particular character; and another that eschews detail for maximal clarity in small sizes.\n\nFreight (Joshua Darden). Dyana Weissman: While we move out of the era of the antiseptic sans-serifs, Freight offers refreshing anomalies that warm up the design.[...] This family is insane. Not only because of the 100 styles, but also because of its charming little quirks.\n\nMinistry Script (Alejandro Paul). Paul Hunt comments: How do you convey sexiness with type? Use a sultry script face. The only thing more typographically titillating might be a set of canoodling ligatures.\n\nGaramond Premier Pro (Robert Slimbach).\n\nDeréon (Jean-François Porchez). Chris Rugen writes: When I see Déreon, I see a Whitman and Dalliance mix (two of my favorites) creating something unique. Like Whitman, Deréon gets its body from the Scotch Didone Caledonia.\n\nProxima Nova (Mark Simonson). Kyle Hildebrant: It nestles neatly in a place between the geometric, grotesque, and gothic. Its generous x-height, thoughtfully balanced color, and expert typographic features (small caps, text figures, lining figures, etc.) position it as a prime candidate for extended textual setting.\n\nZingha (Xavier Dupré, Font Bureau). Norbert Florendo comments: Reviewing Zingha is as delightful as discovering several long lost cases of unreleased ATF hot metal typefaces.\n\nVista Sans (Xavier Dupré). Stephen Coles: With its friendly quirks, Vista Sans is a lot like Tarzana — another Emigre font — but succeeds everywhere Tarzana fails. The more distinctive glyphs feel harmonious with the rest of the font, never jarring. Gentle swashes and a large x-height make for a friendly sans that would work just right in so many settings.\n\nCézanne Pro (James Grieshaber).\n\nFF Maiola (Veronika Burian). Dan Reynolds drools: Just when you thought your collection's text categories were set, Veronika Burian burst the stable doors open, reviving the Czech genre and its warm idiosyncrasies. A “warm” typeface? FF Maiola solves this puzzle using discrete play of irregularity and multiple angles, hearkening back to Menhart and Preissig's approaches.\n\nMaple (Eric Olson). Mark Simonson: Other type designers have mined the 19th century English grotesque, but Eric Olson gives it an energetic crispness which makes earlier attempts seem a bit stuffy. Maple captures the exuberant quirkiness of the grots without slavishly imitating them.\n\nGarda (Mario Feliciano). William Berkson notes: With great elegance and style—and alternative characters and ligatures—the set offers superb alternatives to Trajan, Optima, and Futura for titling.\n\nLitteratra (Karsten Lücke). Yippie! Keep it up, Karsten! Joshua Lurie-Terrell: It's a sort of roman amalgam of textura and Schwabacher, channeling the expressionist spirit of Vojtech Preissig. [...] It's an entire historical movement.\n\nRelato (Eduardo Manso). My compatriot Yves Peters: Emtype Relato combines Dutch purposefulness with Latin sensuality. Its serifs are constructed following a clever principle, and the typefaces look simply gorgeous.\n\nHonorable mentions: FF Absara Sans (Xavier Dupré), Amor (František Storm), Arrival (Keith Tam), Avebury Black and Open (Jim Parkinson), Ayres Royal (Gert Wiescher), Bembo Book (Robin Nicholas), Bluemlein Scripts (Alejandro Paul), Botanika (Tomáš Brousil), Cabazon (Jim Parkinson), Chocolate (Angel Koziupa and Alejandro Paul), Crank8 (Greg Lindy & Henk Elenga), Deutsche Bahn [PDF] (Christian Schwartz and Erik Spiekermann), Dynasty (Rian Hughes), Fedra Sans Display (Peter Bilak), Flama (Mário Feliciano), Galicia (Rian Hughes), Gill Sans Pro (Monotype), Groovin' (Jason Walcott), Handsome Pro (Nick Shinn), Happy Hour (Jason Walcott), Incognito (Gábor Kóthay), Kaffeesatz (Jan Gerner), Kingfisher (Jeremy Tankard), Lapture (Tim Ahrens), Mashine (Tim Ahrens), Mercury Display & Text (Jonathan Hoefler & Tobias Frere-Jones), Miserichordia (Rian Hughes), Modesto Text (Jim Parkinson), Morice (Stephen Banham), Nerva (Dino dos Santos), Nicholas (Nick Shinn), Ogravan (Tomáš Brousil), Paperback (John Downer), Propane (David Buck), Radiogram (Rian Hughes), Rough Riders and Redux (Michael Hagemann), Sculptura (Jason Castle), ITC Stone Humanist Sans (Sumner Stone), Soap (Ray Larabie), Sovereign (Nick Cooke), Tamarillo (Jason Walcott), Tourette (Jonathan Barnbrook), Wanderer (Michael Hagemann).

His oeuvre is simply irresistible, charming and a worthy representative of the Polish poster style---witness Alergia (2016), Magiel Pro (2017) and Madiso (2017).\n\nHe is the creator of the blackletter-inspired typeface Raus (2012), which also could pass for a Cyrillic simulation font. It was possibly made with Pawel Wypych. He also made Kebab (2012, a fat caps face), Duce (2012, art deco: withdrawn from MyFonts after Charles Borges complained that it was a rip-off of his own Gloria), Fikus (2012), Woodie (2012, a condensed rough wood type face), Polon (2012), Aurora (2012, a German expressionist poster face), Musli (monoline connected script), HWDP (2012, poster font), Wieczorek Script (2012, hand-printed), Hamlet (2012, a sword and dagger typeface, renamed to Prince), Caryca (2012, Cyrillic simulation, done with Pawel Wypych), Bezerro (2012, poster face), Bitmach (2012, pixel face), Meat Script (2012, a caps only market signage brush script), Krac (2012, a tall poster font), Hermes (2012: Ten Dollar Fonts), Berg (2012, a roughened blackletter face), Buldog (2012), Dudu (2012, tall condensed face).\n\nIn 2012, Polish designer Wojciech Freudenreich and Mateusz Machalski combined forces to design the techno typeface SYN, which is based on an earlier De Stijl-genre alphabet by Freudenreich. In 2020, they released the free typeface family SYN Nova, which includes additional styles and a variable font.\n\nMachalski likes old wood types, which inspired him in 2012 to publish a wood type collection of weathered display typefaces: Condom, Hype, Whore, Banger, Buka. Elo (2012) and Duce (2012) are fat weathered wood types.\n\nTypefaces made in 2013: Wood Type Collection 2 (which includes Brie, Kaszti, Mader, Modi, Rena, Roast, Ursus), Zigfrid (headline face), Salute (letterpress style), Benito (a letterpress or geometric wood typeface), Bojo (heavy wood style poster face), Picadilly (heavily inktrapped open counter sans family), GIT (a manly headline sans), Lito (an eroded poster typeface), Haine (vernacular caps), Aneba (an organic sans family, renewed in 2016 as Aneba Neue), Vitali (sans), Korpo Serif (slab serif), Korpo Sans (elliptical family; +Greek, +Cyrillic).\n\nTypefaces from 2014: Adagio Slab, Adagio Serif, Adagio Sans (a superfamily not to be confused with the 2006 typeface Adagio Pro by Profonts), Adagio Sans Script, Adagio Serif Script, Adagio Slab Script, Tupperware Pro.

Free download from the Polish president's site. The digitization was made possible after Janusz Tryzno acquired the fonts from Poltawski's estate. The official presentation of the font took place in the Polish Presidential Palace, in presence of the (right wing, ultra-conservative, nationalist, law and order) President of Poland, Andrzej Duda. Calling it a national typeface, the president assured the designers that he would use Brygada 1918 in his office. It will be used for diplomas and various other official forms. In 2021, with Anna Wielunska added to the list of authors, it was added as a variable font covering Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Google Fonts.
