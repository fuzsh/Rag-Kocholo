        "text": "In the women's 81-kilometer road race of the 1992 Summer Games cycling competition, Kathryn Watt of Australia surprised favorite Jeannie Longo of France to win the gold medal by 20 seconds. Monique Knol of the Netherlands won the bronze.\n\nAmericans Jeanne Golay and Sally Zack finished sixth and 10th in a pack 21 seconds behind Watt. The United States' best medal hope, Inga Thompson, led after one lap, but was knocked off her bike in a tight turn on the third and never got back into contention, finishing 26th.\n\nWatt, 27 years old, broke away from the pack early in the final 10-mile lap, sprinted past Marie Purvis of Britain and Maria Turcutto of Italy, then outraced 53 cyclists from 27 countries to win in 2 hours 4 minutes 42 seconds.\n\n\"I was in a bunch,\" Watt said. \"I don't like to be a conformist, so I attacked.\"\n\nIt was Australia's first gold medal in the event and its first over all in cycling since the 1984 men's 4,000-meter team pursuit title. Watt was fifth in last summer's pre-Olympic road race in Barcelona and won the event in the 1990 Commonwealth Games."
