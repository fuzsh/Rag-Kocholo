It is very satisfying to be able to thank all those who helped me arrive at this point. Let me begin with the institutions and individuals that made the research possible. The John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress was the first institution to support this project; I am particularly grateful for their early interest. The Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada provided me with three years of research funding, including one term of teaching release. This generous grant covered numerous forays into the archives and provided some uninterrupted time to write, a precious commodity indeed. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation also provided welcome funds for two research stays in Germany and should be commended for recognizing the desire of scholars to have their families with them while abroad. Among the many archivists who helped push this project toward completion, special thanks are owed to Petra Secunde (Daimler), Sonja Nilson (Henkel), Thorsten Finke (Beiersdorf), and Birgit Nachtwey (Bahlsen). Dr. Henrich Hunke was also kind enough to welcome me into his home and share his personal collection of his father’s writings. I very much appreciated his openness and hospitality. McMaster University, my institutional home, and its Arts Research Board also deserve thanks for supporting this project financially as well as for offering a stimulating environment in which to work. Not least of the perks of being on faculty at McMaster is the ability to access the McMaster Children’s Centre. The staff at the Centre has been a part of my family’s life for more than a decade and has contributed in important ways to any success I have enjoyed.\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThanks also goes to those who invited me to present my research over the last few years, including Hartmut Berghoff of the German Historical Institute, Washington, DC; Peter C. Caldwell of Rice University; Till van Rahden, Université de Montreal; Thomas Schaarschmidt of the Zentrum für Zeithistorische Forschung, Potsdam; and Annette Timm, University of Calgary. My editor at Stanford, Norris Pope, was patient while I wrote and a pleasure to work with through the production process. The two reviewers for the press were equally collegial and suggested improvements that I readily incorporated. Tim Mueller, Katrina Espanol-Miller, and Gerulf Hirt provided me with some key technical assistance down the stretch. I thank them for their help. Wendy Benedetti and Debbie Lobban also deserve mention for their administrative skills, without which my job as department chair would be much more time consuming. I also owe much to those friends and colleagues whose wise counsel and timely pep talks were instrumental in the completion of the project. At McMaster, Stephen Heathorn and Martin Horn have been trusted friends for many years and came to my rescue in a variety of ways during the writing of this book. I am grateful to Justin Powell, who continues to provide me a most welcoming home in Berlin. In addition, I must also thank Richard Bessel, Belinda Davis, Peter Fritzsche, Jeff Hayton, Claudia Koonz, Lisa Heineman, and Jonathan Wiesen for their input in discussions of this material. My deepest gratitude goes to those who read whole sections of the manuscript: Frank Biess, Paul Lerner, Corey Ross, and Jonathan Zatlin. Their criticism and enthusiasm were invaluable. In the final inning H. V. Nelles willingly stepped up to the plate and read the entire book. I am very lucky to know so many generous scholars. Lastly, I thank my family. My boys, Jack, Nathaniel, and Paul, to my continued bewilderment show an interest in my work that reminds me on a daily basis of the connections between historical scholarship, teaching, and a healthy civil society. Happily, my husband, Matt Leighninger, looks forward to time in Berlin’s Staatsbibliothek as much as I do. He was probably less excited to edit this manuscript, but he did so willingly nonetheless. I dedicate this book to him.\n\nContents\n\nAbbreviations xiii\n\nIntroduction 1\n\npart i: From Internationalism to “German Advertising” 1. Advertising in the Weimar Republic 17\n\n2.

If we, as a people, do not want to decline, we must become comfortable with the new and emerging world. Advertising is a language of this world.1\n\nThis plea, made in 1929, neatly encapsulates the starting point for this book. It comes from the pen of Hans Luther, the deliberately party-less, former chancellor of the Weimar Republic and soon-to-be head of the Reichsbank and ambassador to the United States until 1937. Typical of his entire political career, which included roles in the republic, Nazi dictatorship, and the early Federal Republic, this statement is one that encourages adaptation. The details of how Germans were to “become comfortable with the new and emerging world” and what that world might look like were yet to be determined. What was certain, according to Luther, was that advertising would be a key component of this emerging world, a medium for participating in this transformative process. Men and women working in ads-related jobs certainly welcomed the social and economic significance attributed to their work. Others were more wary of any world in which advertising was to be a central form of expression, and yet even they agreed that the modern advertisement—at once arresting in form or content and banal in its ubiquitous presence—was here to stay. This book takes Luther’s entreaty seriously by examining what advertising in the two decades following this statement can tell us about the ways Germans came to terms with the “new and emerging world.” This process was not a passive one: individuals in a variety of fields championed their own visions of reform or revolution in Germany after the First World War; after 1933 Nazi ideologues and supporters began to implement their utopian blueprint; and the victorious Allies entered the stage with new ideals\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nand plans in 1945. With its focus on the Third Reich, this book attempts on one level to tease out the complex relationships between corporations and the regime. These relationships were not equal, but neither was the power of the dictatorship absolute. Rather a bounded relative autonomy characterized the relationship between the National Socialist regime and the commercial sector, including the aspiring advertising profession in the 1930s. Bounded because the regime set certain non-negotiable parameters: anti-Semitic, nationalist, and regenerative, which ad professionals accepted largely without complaint. Relatively autonomous in the sense that both parties wished to maintain a degree of separation, recognized some mutuality of interest, and preferred self-discipline to command and control. At the same time, Selling under the Swastika seeks to go beyond decisions made by corporate elites and the regime’s bureaucrats. By examining the production and circulation of promotional materials, evaluating sales strategies and consumer feedback, the book offers a new perspective on life in National Socialist Germany. I demonstrate that companies and their consumers were fully engaged in the market even into the war years: companies fought to continue advertising, selling, and preparing for expansion, while consumers continued to purchase many products (particularly lowpriced items) they had come to rely on. The book discusses the strategies employed by commercial actors that created ties for consumers between their own material lives and “the new order,” thereby assisting the regime in gaining and maintaining mass support. However, thinking about National Socialism as a “political response to the problems created by consumption” is a more complicated task than simply outlining policies of control and coercion from above, or resistance to those policies from below.2 Instead, the book maintains that the promotion of commerce and a certain Nazi vision of business ethics were intrinsic to the ideological goals of the regime and the dreams of empire after the onset of war. In other words, the regime’s attempts to reach out to those working in the commercial sector and their customers were not driven solely by the need to achieve legitimacy for the dictatorship; consumers and commercial actors had active roles to play in the Nazi utopia.3 In exploring this territory, this study offers three correctives to the existing literature on social cohesion, consumption, and business in the Third Reich. While recent scholarship has convincingly demonstrated that in the mid-1930s most members of the racial community [Volksgemeinschaft] responded positively to the calls for participation in building the new Germany, and experienced this period as a time of pleasure and optimism, this\n\nIntroduction\n\nbook offers evidence that appeals to community and other Nazi goals came also from the private sector—appeals that were perhaps more persuasive coming from respected national corporations or local employers. 4 It also challenges the dominance of the “virtual consumption” model that emphasizes the importance of state promises of future plenty, by focusing on the actual buying and selling that continued to shape daily life.5 In this way the book uses advertisements to examine the ways brand name goods “became a favorite repository of new Nazi myths and fantasies.”6 Finally, in arguing that the mechanics of individual consumption and the advertising industry that lubricated it were more than just a means of stabilizing the Nazi government, the book redresses our understanding of the legacy of Nazi-era reforms for postwar German developments. Twenty years ago Michael Geyer issued his provocative statement that “the social contract for an acquisitive [German] society was formed in the consuming passions of the 1930s and 1940s rather than in the postwar years.”7 Selling under the Swastika puts Geyer’s declaration to the test. By exploring the mechanisms of German commercial culture between the end of the 1920s and the early 1950s, the book confirms that the language of buying and selling triumphed, despite the war, and re-emerged after 1945 in a position to supersede the language of politics as a unifying force.\n\nconsumer culture, commercial culture Nazi Germany was not a mass-consumer society, but it was closer to being one than we often presume. If we apply John Brewer’s six criteria characteristic of mass-consumer societies, Nazi Germany passes easily on all but two, and even those two shortcomings are debatable. This book demonstrates that there were “communication systems that attach[ed] meaningful images to certain goods” and that there was “a shared recognition of commodities as conveyors of meaning.” It is also clear that consumers were viewed as “economic players” and that some citizens had “an ambivalence toward the phenomenon of consumption.”8 What is perhaps missing is the availability of a broad range of products and the emphasis on leisure found in a mass-consumer society.9 The chief sticking point for most scholars with regard to the former point is that the majority of German households were unable to afford consumer durables, such as cars and large household appliances, until the late 1950s. Durables are considered the benchmark in judging the significance of individual consumption in any economy because of\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe complexity of these purchases, involving lay-away schemes, credit, or personal savings, and the significance of the manufacturing process, which involves heavy investment of labor and material resources.10 Despite the absence of durables in the majority of German households, individuals did experience a wide range of consumer goods. The wealthy certainly enjoyed a broad spectrum of luxury and daily use items, but the middle and even the working classes also saw their lives changed by a growing range of less expensive products in these decades.11 The issue of leisure is also a tricky one. Hitler’s government certainly prioritized war readiness, which led to a productionist mentality generally, but the labor involved was always coupled with incentives, including greater leisure opportunities for members of the Volk at least until the war began. Despite this proximity to Brewer’s definition and the interest scholars have taken in investigating West German consumer culture, the focus of the historical literature of the Third Reich has been on the production side of the economy. Studies of national recovery and rearmament policies, heavy industry, finance, cartelization, and the use of slave labor during the war years are plentiful. The fact that purchasing power remained low in the 1930s has served as sufficient reason to continue the focus on the economic conditions for waging war.12 However, Albrecht Ritschl maintains that the worst of the Depression was over by 1932, and that the upswing that followed cannot be chiefly attributed to deficit spending in the form of building projects, state employment schemes, or rearmament policies of the new Nazi-led government.13 “With or without Hitler,” Ritschl insists, recovery was “on the doorstep,” and long-term unemployment was becoming less and less of a threat.14 While the debate remains alive and others give much more credit to the “military Keynesianism” of the regime, oral history evidence seems to corroborate Ritschl’s statistical findings that stress improvement in the private sector.15 From these sources, we learn that compared with the upheavals of the 1920s and the Depression years of the early 1930s, many individuals (at least, those not targeted by the regime) developed a sense of optimism about their financial futures in the middle part of the decade.16 André Steiner concurs with this evaluation. Despite the fact that the average real income among workers continued to worsen from 1932 until 1935, only improving thereafter, Steiner emphasizes the psychological significance of stable employment. In other words, even if living standards were only marginally better in 1938 than they had been in 1932, given higher prices and intermittent shortages, family incomes were more secure,\n\nIntroduction\n\nand that in itself went far in providing emotional relief for weary Germans and ultimately support for the regime.17 This optimism did not extend to the purchase of large-ticket items; household appliances and cars remained beyond the reach of the vast majority of Germans until the post-1945 period. The “virtual consumption” of such items, however, relied on this optimism—the confidence that ownership was just around the corner. In the meantime, men and women were able to take pleasure in an array of relatively inexpensive nonessential consumer products and leisure activities that were available until the early 1940s.18 This relative contentment among members of the Volk had its political dimensions as well. It appeared that the regime was making good on its promise to stabilize the economy. This real consumption of affordable goods had tangible consequences for the growth and maintenance of support for the dictatorship. Just as heroic images of productive laboring “Aryans” aided the mission of drawing the racial community together,19 certain visions of consuming Aryans also bound the nation more tightly and made it easier to cleave off others from economic and social life. Missing from the debates about the Third Reich has been an examination of the territory that mediates between production and consumption: commercial culture, or “the historically specific and reciprocal interactions of economic and cultural capital.”20 Despite the limits on individual consumption effected by economic policies that prioritized the coming war, commercial culture remained an active and meaningful sphere in which ideological claims about gender, race, the nation, urbanization, consumption, business, health, morality, and pleasure were tested. Advertising, the practice of making others aware of goods and services for sale, is one realm in which these and other historically contingent themes were publicly contested in Nazi Germany. Hitler, Goebbels, and other leaders recognized the importance of reforming practices around buying and selling; this created key opportunities for the advocates of commerce, from advertisers and sales staffs to marketing scientists and even some state and party officials. These individuals worked under very unfavorable conditions in the 1930s and 1940s to make sales and consumption respectable pursuits. Their motivations were manifold. Some advertisers, corporate managers, and sales staff were undoubtedly principled National Socialists.21 Others were likely more motivated by their willingness to further their own careers or bolster the status of their professions or the brands they represented. Corporate leaders also sought to protect their shares of the market and profitability in potentially difficult\n\n5\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nfinancial times. This study does not operate at the level of individual motivations, but what is clear is that those in the private sector who worked to normalize commercial relations during the Third Reich did much to bolster the dictatorship and its policies. They embraced buying and selling as a hallmark of the modern age. Indeed, for some it served as an essential way to participate in the life of the Volk. Moreover, while the postwar Germany that emerged after 1945 was unlike anything they imagined, their actions helped lay the foundations for the consumer desires and demands of the 1950s. Finally, in addition to relying on state and business archives, contemporary theoretical writings, and the trade press, this study contributes to the growing body of historical scholarship that employs visual sources as evidentiary matter. While scholars have already used visual representation to examine the ideology and brutality of the regime, this book argues that advertisements from some of Germany’s most popular brand-name products, then and today, also offer a lens through which to explore the relationships between businesses and the Nazi state, and between members of the Volk and Germany’s political and commercial powers. There was no tremendous rupture in ad culture between the Weimar and Nazi eras, but the changes that did take place were generally welcomed. The resulting mixture of continuity and reform led to a visual culture that was both reassuring in its familiarity and encouraging in its portrayal of Germany’s present path.\n\nadvertising and german history Scholars have begun turning to advertisements as key sources for analyzing needs and desires at a particular historical moment. This statement is most true for the United States, where a number of important texts on advertising have become essential reading for making sense of American culture.22 The same cannot be said for Germany. Historians of early twentieth-century Germany have generally stayed away from advertising as either an important subject in its own right or as a way to get at other questions about German society, politics, culture, or economic development.23 Most scholars have concluded that Germany did not have a consumer culture until the 1950s or later, and so issues related to consumption in earlier periods have appeared less significant, particularly given the two world wars that dominated the experiences of Germans in these decades and scholarship since. Historians who might have turned to commercial advertising out\n\nIntroduction\n\nof individual interest in visual culture may have chosen to study the vast political propaganda that marked Germany’s tumultuous past with revolution, wars, and dictatorships.24 Finally, there is still some hesitation about what to do with advertisements as historical sources.25 At various conferences, for example, I have been asked how I deal with the “reception problem”—the fact that it is largely impossible to evaluate how individual consumers interpreted the ads they saw. Judging how advertising messages were received is particularly difficult in the pre-1945 era, before consumer surveys and other forms of testing “success” became common in Europe. However, we should not see this point as a major stumbling block to working closely with ads. Instead, as David Ciarlo entreats, we need to look for “a pattern in a downpour.” In other words, by viewing large numbers of images we can begin to see certain patterns that reflect common ways of “crafting and of seeing imagery” in a given time period. Surely there are always individuals (among advertisers and among consumers) who interpreted imagery in wholly unique ways, but we can also presume by looking at the coherence among ads for different products that there were patterns of representation that became so common they constituted a “visual hegemony.”26 By the late nineteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization of Germany meant that more and more products competed for attention in the marketplace. While signage and ads were not new, the vast proliferation of advertising materials around the turn of the century marked a new era in the relationship between sellers and buyers. The ubiquitous nature of ads in the twentieth century, far more prevalent than state-sponsored propaganda even under National Socialism, forces us to examine their relevance in this society. Advertisements are important cultural artifacts that gave shape to the anxieties and aspirations prevalent at this time. Advertisements do not reflect social reality, but they do allow us to consider what ideas circulated under this regime alongside the messages delivered by state and party propaganda, and to what extent they reinforced or diverged from Nazi ideology. While I encourage others to consider how advertisements might aid their own research, let me make a few comments about how I approached the research for this project. It was surprisingly difficult to get access to corporate archives.27 The nature of that reluctance was not always clear, but the two most common answers are somewhat telling of advertising’s lowly status. Some companies had clearly chosen not to save any materials related to advertising. Others had prioritized the archiving of packaging and other\n\n7\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nephemera for their aesthetic value, but had not saved any references to the planning or production of those designs. Clearly the historical worth of ads, beyond their artistic merit, has often gone unrecognized. Moreover, records that might have shed light on how in-house ad departments functioned or about the employees within those departments were generally nonexistent. As a result, beyond a few individuals I am not able to make more than the broadest generalizations about the social backgrounds of Germany’s ad writers and designers. There is also the chance that some companies did not want their brands represented in this book, and other collections were destroyed in the war. Without the luxury of picking and choosing, I examined the papers of any company that welcomed me. A number of these are well known to the scholarly community because they have been willing in the past to allow scholars access: Beiersdorf, Bayer, Henkel, and others. My luck changed somewhat when I realized that the archival holdings of companies nationalized by the East German government had become public materials and were housed since reunification in Germany’s system of state archives. Some key collections came to me in this way, chief among them Osram and Böhme Fettchemie. Regardless of the generosity of some firms and the fortuitousness of GDR policy, the source base for this study may appear haphazard. Another strategy would have been to build the source base from a chosen set of newspapers or illustrated magazines, but I did not want to draw my analysis solely or primarily from published advertisements. Instead I have chosen to rely on companies for which advertisements could be found in the national press and read in conjunction with textual documents left by the ad designers or sales departments. The biggest disappointment of the research stage of this project was that it was nearly impossible to find records from any of the independent ad agencies or placement services that existed in this period. As discussed in the next chapter, there is one very practical reason for this gap. Ad agencies, as we think of them in North America, were quite rare in Nazi-era Germany. The J. Walter Thompson collection at Duke University is an incredible resource, but the American agency was already selling off its Berlin office in 1932 to its German manager. The story at Duke ends with this acrimonious deal, though the new owner continued to operate the agency through the 1930s. German branches of British agencies were also shuttered during the Depression. There are some references in subsequent chapters to the Dorland agency, which quite amazingly survived the war, despite serving as a friendly home to former Bauhaus artists, including most famously Herbert\n\nIntroduction\n\nBayer. Dorland is still open for business in Berlin today and its managers were kind enough to let me look at their historical collection, but it is quite limited in scope particularly for the years of this study. Other agencies and placement services either disappeared altogether during the war years or were bought up by large international firms in the postwar period, and their archives did not survive these transitions. Readers, it is hoped, will agree that the collection of consumer brands presented here, though in no way exhaustive, offers a useful sample of the major brand-name consumer product manufacturers of the day.28 The ads for these products are in part interesting to today’s readers because many of the brands they represent are still available.29 Of course, these big national, and even international, brand-name manufacturers were but a very small percentage of the total number of corporations that placed ads in these years. But as David Ciarlo so clearly demonstrates in his work on the Wilhelmine era, imitation was the name of the game.30 If I were to compile ads for hand crème from a dozen different brands, many would mimic each other in terms of the images and textual tropes used. Each company kept files of competitors’ ads from around Germany and abroad and attempted to incorporate what were thought to be winning ideas in their own promotional materials. Although the more prominent brands had styles that would be recognizable to consumers, this cross pollination does lead to the question: to what extent can any advertisement of this era be considered German or more significantly “Nazi”? As is shown in the first chapter, German ad designers traveled abroad, reviewed ads from other countries, attended international conferences and trade shows, and read foreign professional journals and manuals even after the republican era came to an end. Manufacturers of big brand-name products often had significant export sales and sought efficiencies by using artwork and sometimes text too (albeit in translation) in more than one national market. Commercial culture in the Third Reich was, in Jonathan Wiesen’s formulation, “flexible enough to accommodate publicity norms that were not, as such, ‘German’ and that could be effective beyond the borders of the Reich.”31 Yet there were national peculiarities that resisted dilution. While many of the artistic and conceptual trends should be seen in a larger international context, German advertising also had to remain in sync with its audience at home—and that was an audience that by and large supported the regime and its racist worldview. Designers, copy writers, and sales staff could not make their work relevant if they completely ignored these facts. Nor is it likely that these corporate actors wanted to undercut the regime’s popular-\n\n9\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nity, or run afoul of its authority in any way. Many managers cheered the ascension of the Nazi Party; others directly benefited from the new state’s racist policies that led to the removal of Jews from their positions. For all these reasons, advertisers sought to align the brands they represented with the challenges and “achievements” of the day. In so doing, company directors demonstrated that they were “on board” with the regime, thereby legitimizing the direction of policy and aiding in the establishment of a Nazi lifestyle.32 As one cigarette ad triumphantly announced, “We have learned to see anew, think and feel anew—we also want now to learn to smoke [in a new way]!”33 What does this say about the depth of National Socialist support? Renewed scholarly interest in the concept of a Nazi Volksgemeinschaft has led to a more complete understanding of how the racial community operated at an everyday level.34 John Connelly’s work on Eisenach was an early contribution to the new wave of debate. He argued that a Volksgemeinschaft was never achieved “in the way the party leadership intended,” but that the concept still had significance in Nazi society. Rather than “internalizing” the ideology, Connelly asserted that at the very least many Germans “externalized” it—using the concept of racial community, and the catchwords issued by the state and party, to serve their own individual needs. This book confirms these findings by presenting instances in which commercial and corporate actors mobilized the language of Volksgemeinschaft to suit their own interests. Time and again we are confronted with examples in which advertisers anticipated the regime in its enacting of Volksgemeinschaft. As Connelly explained, this “dynamic of anticipatory compliance gave National Socialism its tenacity and radicalism.”35 From 1933 until 1942, companies used their advertisements in ways that both implicitly and explicitly supported the regime. Consumers sought products to fulfill needs and desires, but consumption was easily reconciled with the ideology. While there were obvious limits in this economy, hobbled first by international financial crisis and then wage freezes and expenditures for war, consumer items could be easily marketed as beneficial to the material or spiritual well-being of members of the Volk. As long as such items existed, the regime was doing what it promised and ads served as a daily reminder of that claim. By 1943, it was impossible to maintain this link between goods and the promises of Volksgemeinschaft, and the production of new ads ceased. Memories of products gone from the shelves inevitably lost their identification with the dreams of the Third Reich, making it possible to resurrect seemingly “untainted” goods in the postwar period as hallmarks of a new consumer society.\n\nIntroduction\n\nselling under the swastika The first chapter of the book sets the stage by describing the advertising industry in the Weimar Republic, charting its development in the 1920s and its search for recognition as a valuable and upstanding profession. While German advertisements were well respected throughout Europe and North America for their aesthetic value, at home the industry was still plagued by self-doubt about its economic and social worth. Some Germans remained distrustful of the messages contained in ads, and debate continued about the suitability of the Anglo-American model, in which full-service agencies managed the design and placement of all promotional materials for a brand as part of a concerted effort based on research and planning.36 The chapter, therefore, also touches on the growing interest in the science of marketing, which coincided with the emergence of sophisticated mass media and hotly contested election campaigns in the unfolding crisis of the republic.37 In this shifting climate, we see evidence of changing ad content and new innovations, including the adoption of text-laden ads and the more frequent use of photographs and “scientific proof.” Debate continued, however, and intensified after 1929 as the Depression and political turmoil led some advertisers and other observers to question whether the path of internationalization was the correct one for the industry. The appointment of the Hitler-led government in early 1933 changed the nature of these discussions. The new regime acted quickly. Chapter 2 examines the establishment of the Werberat der Deutschen Wirtschaft, the Ad Council for the German Economy. The minimal scholarship that exists on this body dismisses it as insignificant.38 However, I argue that the Ad Council’s legacy has been largely misunderstood by scholars, who expected heavy censorship of ads and a wholly new and uniform Nazi ad style. Most of the men involved in the Werberat came from the business world; they saw the organization as more akin to a lobbying group positioned to defend advertising from its detractors and improve the industry’s reputation with the public, businesses, and the state. Of course the council’s idea of reform included the purging of thousands of ad professionals who were unable to obtain licenses to practice in the field, according to racial and political/professional criteria. However, this “cleansing” combined with changes to the business side of the industry, including new sizing and pricing, the promotion of systematized training, and the support of marketing science to make a lasting impact on German commercial culture.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 3 begins a new section that describes the commercial culture of the prewar years. The chapter begins with a discussion of ads in the new media of radio and film. These were innovations introduced well before 1933, but the regime did make its mark. Although Goebbels had outlawed the use of radio as an inappropriate platform for commercial messages, advertisers did hold on to film as a relatively new and exciting platform. Yet print ads remained by far the most popular method for promoting goods throughout this period. In their films, print ads, and other promotional venues, companies sought ways to tap into the Zeitgeist, producing ads that combined national socialist priorities with trends that can be seen in other national contexts in this period. After the Four-Year Plan (1936) began to squeeze manufacturers with shortages of raw materials, restrictions on trade, and war-readiness became a constant refrain, advertisers sought new and better ways to indicate their products’ worth to the Volk. Leaving advertisers behind for the moment, Chapter 4 highlights consumers and salesmen as essential actors in this commercial culture. As other scholars have found, it is very difficult to uncover the experiences of the largely female consumer population, except as mediated by others, such as state representatives or party officials.39 In this case, I turn largely to the writings of advertisers and other corporate staff to argue that manufacturers and retailers had more respect for women’s “power of the pocketbook” and decision-making skills than is commonly recognized. Of course, not all consumers can be lumped together. Although I have tried to stay away from brands seen as luxury goods, the very nature of brand-name products, which represented uniform quality and an investment in promotional efforts to showcase that reliability, meant that these products were generally out of reach for poor Germans. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that unlike in the United States, where purveyors of consumer goods downplayed class differentiation as they sought to create mass markets, advertisers in Germany did not replace all peasants and workers with ideal middleclass families.40 The National Socialist glorification of physical labor and the masculine Aryan body meant that heroic male workers and farmers remained staples in German ad culture, appearing sometimes even in ads that featured plainly middle-class goods, such as the expensive decaffeinated coffee brand Kaffee Hag. Nazi Germany was not a classless society, and this book considers the ways class and gender norms were complicated by racial narratives. Darcy Buerkle has noted, for example, that advertisements in the popular magazine Die Dame in the 1920s regularly depicted feminine traits that are “Jewish-enough” so as to include the possibility of\n\nIntroduction\n\na Jewish-German female shopper. This potential disappears, she argues, by the mid-1930s.41 Perhaps it goes without saying that racial “others” did not play a significant role in advertising in Nazi Germany. Yet hate-filled caricatures of Jews, blacks, and Slavs were common staples of Nazi-era political propaganda, and images of black servants in particular had a long history in Germany’s visual landscape.42 The absence of non-Aryan figures, caricatured or otherwise, is in itself meaningful. While minorities had always been marginalized in German society, their ostracism became state policy after 1933. The “purification” of “German ads” was just one of the myriad ways in which racism was interwoven into the fabric of daily life in Nazi Germany. Moreover, in terms of business ethics, the rejection of an allegedly “Jewish” sales style was implied in every reform. “Honest” business practices were by definition racially circumscribed. With this point in mind, Chapter 4 turns to sales representatives to ask how these commercial actors hoped to fit in to the new marketplace and whether they had a role in the Aryanization of the economy before the war. A discussion of commercial culture during the Second World War is sorely lacking from the vast historiography of the conflict. This lack of attention to advertising, and the efforts of consumer products industries to retain promotional links to consumers at home and abroad, means that we have missed an important part of daily life in Germany and a link between the empire-building goals of the Third Reich and the emergence of West Germany, in particular, as an economic power. While the war led to sharp cuts in manpower and material resources for consumer products industries and prompted some to insist that ads had no place in a war economy, there were others in industry and with links to the government who were concerned about morale on the home front, and fought to maintain some minimum level of consumer satisfaction. Chapter 5 examines this renewed debate over the value of advertisements and asks how individual consumption was thought to fit in with the visions of empire circulating during the euphoric years of military victory. The final chapter of Selling under the Swastika carries the story through defeat and discusses briefly the re-establishment of a German ads industry in West and East Germany. Although conditions on the home front did not completely deteriorate until late 1944, the collapse of the consumer market after 1942 meant that the visual partnership between brand-name products and the Third Reich began to falter. Chapter 6 suggests that this uncoupling of individual consumption and the Nazi worldview in the second\n\n13\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nhalf of the war was instrumental to the postwar rehabilitation of Germany’s consumer goods industries. Messages that linked consumer goods and the regime were largely absent from the landscape, thanks to paper shortages and Allied bombings. In homes ersatz goods had replaced brand names. Long lines, the black market, and going without marked the consumer’s world in the last half of the war, and these experiences only became more desperate in the first postwar years. Manufacturers of brand-name goods, and the commercial sphere more generally, thus escaped the taint of defeat. Ultimately, Selling under the Swastika argues that German companies and the Nazi Werberat were able to save advertising from itself. They convinced Germans that buying and selling were not foreign imports or threats to unity, but in fact ways to belong to the community. Even during the war, ads played a reassuring role by reminding Germans of products they associated with peacetime and by offering strategies to deal with hardship. Though, fortunately, the German empire imagined by these advocates of advertising never came to pass, commercial culture was ready to step forward in postwar Germany as a unifying project that could take the place of a disgraced political culture.\n\nchapter one\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic Advertise and don’t despair!1\n\nWriting in the first months of the Third Reich, Hanns F. J. Kropff, a leading German researcher in the science of advertising, began his book: “In a time in which the word ‘rational’ shines as a beacon of light on every wall, it is astounding that German ads in many cases are still ‘driven by emotions.’ The recognition of the utility of a system—in the highest sense of the orderly distribution and design of the advertisement—is still far from commonplace among all those who work [in the industry].”2 Kropff ’s analysis, which began a treatise on the importance of psychology in effective ad design, went on to praise the work of American and British ad designers and included their work time and again in his 1934 text as examples of best practice for understanding human desires and motivations, for incorporating effective use of color and type, and researching market trends.3 Kropff serves as a useful example of the modernist strain in National Socialism. The best way to understand culture in Hitler’s society is not as a “beautiful illusion”—a mirage of light and color that bewitched the spectator, an orderly surface that masked irrationality.4 Rather, someone like Kropff speaks to the ease with which some thinkers moved from the rationalization of the Weimar era to the Nazi period, hopeful that Hitler’s regime would fulfill the promises of reform that had been in the air throughout the 1920s. Kropff was certainly no friend of Weimar, but he believed the call for rationalization that marked the 1920s to be a path to economic success and professional standing for his discipline.5 Like others, he embraced the “experimenting, reordering, reconstructing” mission of National Socialism. It is this “spirit of renovation” that we see emerge out of debates in the republican era and develop more fully after 1933.6 We begin, therefore, with an analysis of German advertising and commercial culture in the 1920s and\n\n18\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nthe sometimes collaborative, sometimes competitive, relationship between German advertisers and their Anglo-American counterparts, who led the way designing the “rational” ads that attracted Kropff. Most important, however, the chapter highlights the manner in which commercial actors debated the way forward during the Depression and the political turbulence that accompanied it. In addition to its uses righting the economy, some hoped that what they saw as an international language of ads could promote an understanding between nations that would cement the peace. Others became more protectionist at the end of 1920s and insisted that product promotion should not only highlight the importance of buying home-grown goods but should also represent “national character” in form and content. The chapter discusses these debates and concludes with the offensive of German advertisers like Kropff who adopted the nationalist line as a way to withstand the tumultuous 1920s and prepare a niche for their industry in the coming National Socialist era.\n\nadvertising in the 1920s: supporters and critics Germany had a long tradition of commercial advertising. The biannual Leipzig fair had been held since the Middle Ages, drawing exhibitors and attendees from all over the world. Of course, the fair predated the emergence of a German state by several hundred years, but the Germans claimed it as their own, and even boasted of hosting the European marketplace.7 By the second half of the 1920s, the Leipzig fair could in fact be seen, according to Victoria de Grazia, as the center of a new global economy—with regularly sponsored stands representing countries from all corners of the earth.8 But as de Grazia also argues, commercial fairs constituted only one of a growing number of advertising methods by the end of the nineteenth century. Posters, print advertisements and classifieds, shop window displays, branded collectibles such as match books and trading cards, and the verbal advertisements and demonstrations offered by company representatives, retailers, and door-to-door salespeople were taken for granted by most as part of daily life. As radio and film became popular media outlets, advertisements found their ways to those venues as well. In many of these areas, German advertisers and businessmen were not world leaders. The sales tools that most Germans still upheld as the most respectable and dependable were those that had maintained the Leipzig\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nfair as a potent force for hundreds of years: face-to-face meetings between manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers, the ability to demonstrate the quality of wares and production methods in person, and contracts that were negotiated and signed on the spot. These strategies were far removed from the new mass marketing techniques that focused on investigations of consumer desires increasingly practiced in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Britain. In the years following the First World War, German businesses did not readily embrace change. There were both practical (the ailing economy) and principled reasons (a distrust of imported practices) working against the adoption of new strategies, such as the introduction of customer surveys, the psychological study of consumer behavior, and the growth of full-service ad agencies to handle all aspects of the branding process. In fact, beyond the handful of branches of American and British agencies that opened in the mid- and late 1920s, the concept of the full-service advertising campaign handled by external experts did not really take hold until the 1960s. In the interwar period most German companies continued to handle their advertisements in-house. In 1930, a large retailer with five hundred men and women on its payroll was likely to employ twenty-five to thirty of them in the advertising of its wares.9 Indeed, only a handful of the most established brands had a well-developed image around which they could base an entire promotional program. Ideas for advertisements, according to Alexander Schug, simply flowed from the owners and sales staff to the office in charge of design, or were simply stolen from the advertisements of competitors.10 Satisfied customers were also fond of sending in letters with personal stories, poems, slogans, photographs, and jingles they recommended for use in ads. The motivations behind these suggestions seem to range from real emotional attachment to the brand, and a desire to see it thrive, to the hope that contributing a well-rhymed jingle might lead to remuneration. If the business did not have its own in-house ad department and did not work with a full-service agency or an independent ad designer, a draft of an idea would be sent directly to a graphic artist or printer. In all cases where full-service agencies were not employed, the company or retailer then relied on one of the many placement services [AnnoncenExpeditionen] to handle the business side of seeking out sites and placing advertisements.11 Unlike the American ad agencies that would handle the placement of ads in all media, German placement services tended to specialize in one format, such as print, radio, film, building exteriors, or billboards. Pay-\n\n19\n\n20\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nment systems were also different in the respective countries. The ad agencies handled the whole account, charging one fee for the production of all materials plus an additional 15 percent for consultation and planning. German businesses seeking to advertise their wares and services were charged in a piecemeal fashion, but the total costs were far lower than working with one of the transplanted Anglo-American full-service agencies. The German businessman paid the graphic artists and printers individually for the advertisements they readied for placement, and then the placement services (of which a business might use several) received a commission for the number of ads “sold” to publishers or other media outlets, deals that often included rebates for the quantity of ad space purchased.12 There were a variety of reasons for the reluctance of some Germans to adopt new advertising methods. First, the whole concept of Propaganda, which was still often used interchangeably with the word for advertising [Reklame], had an unfavorable reputation throughout Europe, owing largely to the deceptions of state and military propagandists during the First World War. These negative connotations combined with older concerns that advertising was an unethical, almost shameful sales strategy— one that would only hurt the company’s reputation in the long run. A company’s goods should win new customers on word-of-mouth reputation alone; quality didn’t need to shout to gain attention.13 Second, per capita income in Germany showed no clear signs of growth between 1913 and 1947.14 Under such circumstances, it was hard for many business owners to invest heavily in new sales methods or even the old ones. The financial instability of the republic not only made it less likely for new investment in large-scale promotional efforts; some consumers also believed that advertising did little more than increase the price of the goods. Creating a brand-name product was therefore risky, not only because of the expense but also because it had the possibility of actually turning away some potential buyers. Third, some advertisers and business owners accepted advertising as a strategy but wanted to conserve the uniquely German style of poster design. Before the war, prominent graphic artists such as Lucien Bernhard and Ludwig Hohlwein had created stark imagery that helped cement the logos and names of some of Germany’s first branded goods in the minds of consumers. Their eye-catching posters, characterized by brilliant colors, minimal text (often just the brand name), and stark imagery were internationally respected. And while this Plakatstil was on the decline in the 1920s, increasingly crowded out by cheaply made and placed print ads, many ad-\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nvertisers in Germany (and other parts of Europe) were unwilling to abandon the poster and its brash style completely out of respect for its aesthetic value and tradition of commercial success. Moreover, the international admiration enjoyed by German artists, including Oskar Kokoschka, Heinrich Zille, and Kurt Schwitters, who worked intermittently for advertisers to make ends meet in the unstable economic climate, reinforced the long-held belief among German business leaders that advertising was best left to the creative genius of the artist. It is also worth remembering that advertising as a profession was less developed than we might expect in Germany in the 1920s, certainly in comparison with the United States. In addition to highly skilled artists that came and went, there was also an influx of young men and women entering advertising and related professions after the war. During the period of relative economic stability in the mid-1920s, and the concomitant growth of mass media and individual consumption, there were new jobs to be had in this sector. Either classroom training or workplace experience in sales, decorating, journalism, or graphic arts could lead someone toward a career in advertising. Without formalized professional standards of training, advertising was wide open to young urbanites from a variety of backgrounds.15 In Erich Kästner’s sardonic 1931 novel Fabian: The Story of a Moralist, the university-trained protagonist describes himself in the opening scene as “Fabian, Jacob, aged thirty-two, profession variable, at present advertising copywriter.” Later in the novel, when he is asked by a colleague what will happen if he loses his job writing advertisements for a cigarette company, he answers: “Do you think I’ve spent my life since the day I was confirmed making good publicity for bad cigarettes? When these people kick me out, I shall look for a new profession. One more won’t make much difference to me.”16 This lack of a uniform path into advertising meant that disseminating the theories of scientific selling was a slow process, but it also meant that marginalized groups, chiefly women and Jews, had a chance of making inroads into these new fields. Women first took up positions in store window decorating, for which their domestic skills were thought to be a useful foundation. They also had success entering ad departments as entrylevel artists, creating sketches or painting in the final image according to a male artist’s directions.17 Over time some women moved up within ad departments or chose to work independently. Likewise, Jews did not find anti-Semitic barriers to be as difficult to hurdle as in more established professions. Jews from retailing families, in particular, likely found this an easy\n\n21\n\n22\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nstep to take. Youthful advertisers may have also had a slight advantage in their work. Other white-collar professions were also expanding, leading to greater purchasing power among this sector of young consumers, including the so-called new women. Employers of advertisers needed to take this fact seriously, one expert warned: “[The advertiser] will only hit the mark with these new, young consumers, if his ad speaks to them in a youthful tone!”18 While the poster tradition continued to find supporters in 1920s Germany, practitioners did incrementally turn their attention to the technical side of selling, thinking ever more seriously about the impact of color, lighting, size, and other aspects of form and content in their posters rather than artistic merit alone.19 The professional journal founded in 1921, Das Plakat [The Poster], changed its name in 1924 to Gebrauchsgraphik [Graphic Art], signaling the shifting emphasis toward a wider variety of media and more psychologically savvy design methods, even if the business side of advertising remained fairly constant.20 Alongside these financial, professional, and aesthetic challenges of the 1920s, anti-advertising sentiment was also fed by much older anti-Semitic stereotypes of the conniving, swindling Jewish merchant.21 While a prejudicial association between Jews and less-thanhonorable sales practices was well ingrained throughout Europe, it gained renewed legitimacy at the start of the twentieth century when revived by leading German intellectuals who feared new forms of capitalism, which included mass production, department and chain stores, and, of course, ads. In his 1911 treatise The Jews and Modern Capitalism, the sociologist Werner Sombart claimed that the eighteenth-century practice of Jewish clothiers who “seized the passer-by by the arm and tried to force him to make purchases” had developed into the contemporary sales aim “to get hold of the customers.” Sombart targeted the sales practices of large brand-name firms such as AEG, a company that happened to have been founded by the Jewish Berlin patrician Emil Rathenau in 1883. The older, “disorderly” attempt to grab hold of potential customers, explained Sombart, was first “systematized when advertising was resorted to.” While Sombart admitted to having no “conclusive evidence,” he was clearly comfortable (and influential) connecting the dots, concluding that “their [Jews’] claims to be the fathers of modern advertising are equally well established.”22 Before the First World War, therefore, those German business elites who did see an economic benefit in advertising still felt it necessary to write pleading commentaries on the value of product promotion for the national economy. Christian Adalbert Kupferberg was one of the earliest\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nand most vocal businessmen to make the case for the value of ads, as well as the need to study the topic systematically in order to develop the most effective advertising possible. The scion of the eponymous sparkling wine producers from Mainz, C. A. Kupferberg started an ad department in his family’s business in 1909, allegedly causing a great rift between himself and his scandalized uncle, who eventually sold off his share of the family firm.23 The young Kupferberg traveled frequently to the United States, and was an honorary member of the Advertising Club of Baltimore. He wrote in 1914: “Those who are not close to the sales profession and the advertising work that is connected to it will seldom realize what extraordinarily high significance advertising has for our economic life today.” It was astounding, he continued, given the “millions and millions” that the ad industry generated in terms of employment and profits that there was really no professional training or systematic study of the “scientific discipline.” Further, he bemoaned the fact that in Germany the “sales profession” did not enjoy the esteem that it deserved as the most important “factor in purchasing [Erwerbsfaktor] in the nation.”24 His recipe for improving the situation was fairly simple, calling for uniform training and closer attention to the study of psychology. He also advocated for the most rudimentary market research, such as gaining a profile of the readership of a newspaper or magazine before making choices about where to place advertisements. Kupferberg recognized the difficulty of convincing Germans that advertising worked. He concluded with a reminder (in a rather transparent reference to some of the biggest brand-name products of his day) that fifty years prior there had been no serious market for mouthwash, facial creams, and other cosmetics, but ads had “first taught us to use these things.”25 The number of people who, like Kupferberg’s uncle, rejected advertising altogether became smaller and smaller in the early 1920s, while the debate about how best to advertise grew more intense, as evidenced by the burgeoning number of journals devoted to the topic. Kupferberg remained adamant that Germany suffered because of the lack of respect and attention given to advertising. In comparison to American magazines, he noted in 1921, German advertisement sections lacked order and taste and therefore efficacy. They could be compared, he insisted in a metaphor that demonstrated his fervent nationalism, with “a Polish parliament, the assemblies of which were characterized by everyone clamoring at once rather than an orderly assembly.” Without proper regulations and planning, he implied, all voices were lost in the din.26 On one hand there were reasons to be hopeful for men like Kupferberg. The postwar urban environment was\n\n23\n\n24\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nawash in new advertising opportunities.27 Only ten to fifteen years prior, an advertiser had only three major choices for placement: newspaper classifieds, poster columns, or hoardings—there were only a handful of lighted ad signs in all of Germany in 1914. By the 1920s, Kupferberg could rejoice that “the railways, street car companies, the postal service, shipping lines, as well as countless landlords, and owners of gardens and fencing hoped to rent out surfaces to advertisers.” These public spaces joined the fray alongside other emerging alternatives: “address book inserts, newspaper binders, mobile loudspeakers, table lampshades, match stands and more.” Berlin alone had three thousand lighted advertisements in 1929, and the use of color in neon displays would continue to expand after 1933.28 On the other hand, Kupferberg harbored the fear that the results of this “ad-flood” would be increasing immunity to the messages among consumers, leading to greater and greater expenditures on ads that held less and less value in the crowded marketplace. The danger mirrored the snowballing effects of the inflationary monetary situation that Germany was experiencing as Kupferberg penned his essay.29 The sensory onslaught of advertisements brought with it other dangers, according to some medical officials. As early as the eighteenth century, doctors had claimed that individual consumption was linked with intoxication and hysteria among women.30 Throughout the nineteenth century, cultural critics and medical professionals continued to characterize female shoppers as particularly susceptible to the chicanery of unscrupulous retailers and ad men.31 The ever-expanding world of consumption and the new media forms that promoted it intensified concerns about the masses, particularly women, becoming overwrought with emotion. As Paul Lerner notes, criminologists continued to insist into the early twentieth century that the desire to consume among female shoppers could become uncontrollable in the presence of elaborate displays of goods, leading to unwise purchases and even kleptomania.32 For those as convinced as Kupferberg of the potential of advertisements to power the economy, this flood was no real obstacle. Rather the vast quantity had the potential to push advertising to achieve higher standards of quality. Advertisers would seek out the best sites and reject the old chaotic “shrieking” that seemed to echo off the hoardings. Furthermore, Kupferberg claimed that more rational, effective forms of advertising had the potential to beautify the city by bringing art to the streets. Surely it was a matter of opinion, he admitted, whether one felt “the undecorated streetcars of the old type looked better than the streetcars of today with their\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nnew, colorful, in many cases artistically pleasing pictures.” But it was clear where he stood on the matter: “A metropolis is no idyllic countryside. The advertisement belongs in its goings-on [treiben], like the crowd, the blare of the automobile horn and the dust of the streets.”33 With this kind of declaration, advocates of advertising were confronting head-on another set of detractors: those who decried advertisements as unsightly. As Thomas Lekan explains, the German Homeland Protection Society, which led the Heimatschutz movement, has been rehabilitated in recent years by environmental historians who now see the organization’s conservation work between 1880 and 1914 as akin to later attempts to create an “environmentally sensitive modernity.” However, Lekan thinks we have overlooked the subject of advertising in our revisionist understanding of Wilhelmine Heimatschutz.34 To these protoenvironmental activists, perhaps the biggest defiler of Germany’s pristine landscape was not industry or changes to infrastructure, but advertisements, particularly those posters and billboards geared toward tourists en route through the countryside. To the cultural elites involved in the Heimatschutz movement, all the signage for inns, pubs, and tourist sites also signaled the birth of a mass tourism that challenged class boundaries and bourgeois understandings of leisure and consumption.35 After a hiatus during the First World War, the Heimatschutz movement continued to fight for legislation against advertisements in rural communities and along country roadways. Even in the urban context, many supporters of this movement thought that ads were fundamentally bothersome and should face strict regulation. As one commentator insisted, “The home, not only in the narrow sense but also in the broader sense of the word, should offer complete peace and relaxation after all the confinement and disquiet of the workday; therefore all residential streets should also be kept free of unnecessary noise and also from the pestering disturbances to the eyes [caused by ads].”36 Many German cities ultimately established successful commissions in the 1920s that brought together citizens, city officials, and representatives of industry to find ways to integrate advertising in a manner acceptable to all stakeholders.37 There was, however, no national solution, and the debate would begin anew in the National Socialist era.38 Beyond the important issues of preservation versus commercialization, the controversy also reminds us of the divisions that still existed between city and country in the interwar years.39 The differences between life in the metropolis and life in the village, however, did not always lead to a rejection of ads in the countryside. While there was an increasing acceptance of ads as central to the modern\n\n25\n\n26\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\ncityscape, some far away from Germany’s bustling metropolises also came to recognize the significance that advertisements might hold for their own economic and cultural futures. Provincial retailers on occasion felt compelled to remind the big companies whose products they sold not to forget them—they too deserved the most up-to-date promotional efforts from which urban retailers presumably benefited.40 The urban marketplace was also becoming more complex. The country’s cities were not just larger than ever before, they were far more diverse. As one observer put it in 1929, Berlin had completely changed in the last fifty years, owing to an annual influx of 100,000 newcomers from around Germany and beyond. According to one practitioner, those who wanted to get their messages across to consumers had to recognize that the “native Berliner” [Urberliner] of old, who would have understood a classified that reminded the reader simply to “buy chocolate at Hildebrandt’s” or a “hat at Reiser’s on King Street” was “nearly extinct.”41\n\nencounters with british and american ads and advertisers This criticism was mainly reserved for the classifieds placed by smaller, local companies and retailers, who had failed to update their sales methods or think seriously about their copy in the 1920s. For larger firms who marketed popular brand-name items throughout Germany, the stabilization of the economy in the second half of the decade allowed for greater investment and even experimentation with design and copy. While the debates about how to advertise effectively continued, the discussion became more international, just as the number of international institutions (business, political and cultural) and brands was also growing. Like German businessmen who were drawn to the United States for study tours of cutting-edge production facilities, German advertisers traveled to the U.S. to visit the big full-service ad agencies, listen to experts, and meet with professional associations and chambers of commerce.42 Even the most widely read illustrated magazine of the era, Die Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung (BIZ), joined in the game by commissioning Arthur Rundt, who in 1926 had written a popular travel book on the United States called America Is Different [Amerika ist anders], to return to America and report back on that nation’s “highly developed, to us still somewhat foreign methods to advertise wares and ideas.”43\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nAlthough the U.S. consumer-driven economy was the success story to many, scholars agree that attempts to import American promotional methods were integrated only partially, and none were quick to take hold during the 1920s.44 At the start of the decade, Christian Kupferberg pointed out that German advertisers were too prescriptive in their methods compared with the creativity of the Americans, who thought about how to foreground the “appeal” (English in the original) of the commodity first, and then began convincing the reader that brand x was the best version. And yet he too recognized that this style of advertising could not simply be dropped into German print ads. American designers downplayed the artwork in favor of argument and the ability to reach a diverse consumer market; German readers simply did not view the advertisement sections in the press “as an educational or valuable extension of the news section” and so would miss the instructions provided.45 Rundt’s 1928 article made clear in its very title, “The Controllable USA-mind,” that the popular vision of American consumption and marketing was not necessarily one Germans valued, and that their advertisers and public relations experts represented a very different breed of commercial actor—they even worked with their office doors open.46 In 1930, an author in Die Reklame still insisted that using as few words as possible in advertisements was what fit the German consumer best. American consumers were frequently forced to read “novellas, biographies, cultural history essays” that would simply bore the “adindifferent or ad-resistant” German reader.47 While they debated the efficacy of “teaching ads” from the United States, German ad men and their business colleagues also remained keenly interested in what their European neighbors were up to in terms of advancements in branding and artistry.48 Particularly after the 1922 fascist takeover in Italy, for example, congratulatory articles in leading journals of the German trade press, such as Die Reklame and Seidels Reklame, about the modernization of media and design in that country became common. In other words, we should not forget that practitioners were also open to innovations from other European countries and still reasoned that in the end each country’s advertisers needed to determine what worked best among its own population. Nonetheless, German advertisers and their employers were confronted most squarely by the alternative model of the AngloAmerican full-service agency, because a number of the largest agencies in the United States and Britain decided to try their hand at breaking into the German market around 1927, shortly before the Depression brought those ventures to a halt.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nThe most prominent firm to expand into Europe was the largest American ad agency, J. Walter Thompson (JWT).49 Sam Meek, who had been working for a small New York ad agency, was brought over to JWT in order to be shipped to London and from there to plan and direct Continental expansion. By the beginning of 1926, Meek and Stanley Resor, working together in London, had decided to extend their services “to any client in any part of the world where there was enough business to warrant them.” Mainly representing American companies abroad, JWT’s decisions about where to open branch offices were typically dictated by the firm’s largest client, General Motors. By 1927 James Webb Young had arrived in London, accompanied by “seven men, three wives, one baby and a cat,” with the mandate to establish an office in every country where GM had a manufacturing plant.50 JWT could boast thirty-three offices around the world by 1930.51 The Berlin office, which opened in 1927, was among the first and in 1930 was still predicted by the agency “to become the most important office in Europe.”52 In the short period that the office was open, the staff tried convincing German firms to invest in JWT’s full-service strategy. To do so, they worked with a largely German staff, though the office manager, Kennett Hinks, was an American and the art director, George Butler, hailed from Britain.53 What they were offering, of course, was still quite foreign (and expensive) to the Germans.54 And there was a certain mutual lack of enthusiasm. Butler, for one, considered German ads rather “brutal and ponderous” and believed there to be “subtler and more effective ways of instilling positive interest in the public concerning a commodity than by shouting.”55 As a more diplomatic JWT research report put it in January 1928: “The mechanics of advertising receive much more attention [in Germany] than the message. Art is apparently desired that attracts attention as ‘clever art.’ . . . This emphasis on catching attention by extraordinary appearance has the natural result of reducing both the amount, the conception of the importance, and the quality of the copy.”56 The JWT style, in contrast, depended far less on imagery, and was often limited to “little line drawings” dwarfed by a great deal of instructional text. The copywriter (who in the case of JWT was often female) tried to convince consumers to change their habits in ways that would lead to new or greater numbers of purchases: changing shirts more regularly and therefore using more detergent, trying a Pyrex cooking pot and eventually buying a whole set of new cookware.57 The JWT style also differed in the amount of research that was conducted in advance of the campaign’s design.58 For example, media research done by JWT in the United States found that the only section of the news-\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\npaper that all family members read was the comics. And so JWT began writing comic strip advertisements, often with the same humorous narrative style as a noncommercial strip.59 This method, and humor more generally, was slow to be adopted in Germany, but it did make some inroads into ad culture throughout the interwar period.60 JWT also immediately undertook its own market research in Europe. In the summer of 1928, Sam Meek reported proudly that “222 different investigations” had been conducted in the past eighteen months, encompassing “37,076 consumers and 7,010 dealers—a total of 44,086 interviews in 13 different countries. There were 83 investigations on food products, 31 on drugs, 55 on motor cars and 14 on media. . . . All these investigations are done by natives of the countries in which they are conducted.”61 Summing up the differences between American and German advertising, the JWT researcher writing in 1928 concluded arrogantly that it represented a gap of about “30 years.”62 The tension between German businesses and the American and British agencies that arrived in the late 1920s, such as JWT, Dorland, W. S. Crawford, and Erwin, Wasey, never truly subsided. We might speculate that in time and under different economic and political circumstances, these firms would have had greater success winning German clients to complement their largely American and British brand portfolios, but when the Depression hit, a number of the major accounts that served as anchors to these recently founded branch offices pulled out of the German market. It was not, therefore, the rise of National Socialism that led to the departure of the Anglo-American full-service agencies, but rather the economic collapse. One agency with American origins, Dorland, was able to benefit from the exodus of its competitors.63 By 1929 Dorland’s Berlin bureau was directed by the experienced German ad man Walter Matthess, who moved quickly to take over the remaining accounts of Erwin, Wasey and then W. S. Crawford when both agencies liquidated their Berlin offices in the early 1930s. Dorland had already gobbled up the well-known local agency Deutscher Reklamedienst, extending its reach and reputation among native German brands. When Matthess then bought out all of the remaining Dorland shares held in New York by Condé Nast, the agency became solely German; Mathess’s prescience positioned Dorland to thrive through the 1930s and, with only a relatively short interruption during the war, into the postwar period.64 By the early 1930s JWT, on the other hand, had lost the all-important General Motors account—a result of the slumping market for passenger vehicles and the fact that the German GM subsidiary did not like having\n\n29\n\n30\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nits artwork come from London. The departure of GM was a major blow to the Berlin office. In 1931, Ken Hinks returned to the United States, having never felt at home in Berlin. According to his colleague, Butler, Hinks had been unable (or unwilling) to learn the language and “didn’t like the German way of doing business either; none of us did. . . . Cheating was universal.”65 Allegations of underhanded practices plagued the industry in the 1920s, causing concern not only among foreigners like Butler and Hinks but among German ad men as well.66 Although ad agencies and placement firms were also criticized for their own lack of transparency with regard to their services and pricing, the most common charge was that publishers were unwilling to make public accurate and up-to-date circulation figures, so advertisers (and their customers) never knew for certain how many readers they were reaching. The publishers’ practice of awarding rebates to advertisers for the size of their orders was also targeted as unfair. Rebate levels were totally arbitrary, negotiated case by case, leaving many suspicious that competitors got better deals. It also meant that owners of small businesses, in particular, were vulnerable to untruths from placement service firms about the actual costs of their inserts. The handful of full-service agencies like JWT believed that by avoiding these middle men and dealing directly with the publishers, they would develop more transparent relationships that would pay off down the road. They sought to convince German customers that as newcomers they might not get the best rebates at the start, but would be in a better position to negotiate in the future.67 It was hard for some local clients to understand this approach. In 1932, JWT reported that a number of accounts held by European branch offices were pressing to treat the ad giant like a placing service, and trying to pay “lower commission rates based on the grounds either that our own campaigns are mere adaptations of those prepared in London or Paris, or that they would be satisfied with mere translations of those being used in America.”68 JWT headquarters was unwilling to budge on its full-service mantra and local attention, reasoning that even during the Depression the company would rather lose smaller accounts than give up on its successful American formula. And yet it was clear that if JWT Berlin was to survive in this form, it would need to acquire more domestic German clients. With this goal in mind, the decision was made to replace Hinks with the office’s first German manager, the young Fritz Solm, educated at Columbia University and trained at the London JWT office before moving back to his native country to work in the Berlin office. Solm kept the agency going in the capital throughout the 1930s. At first the firm was\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\noperated under the J. Walter Thompson name, but Solm soon had a falling out with his former employers over the conditions of his purchase of the agency. Despite, or perhaps because of, the acrimonious parting of ways between JWT and its first German manager, Solm become a significant figure in the German ad world after 1933. While the American and British ad agencies retreated from the Continent in the early 1930s, leaving most companies to continue handling their advertising in-house, the scientific selling promoted by the large agencies, among others, had put down roots that had taken hold. As the Reichardt Cocoa Company told its sales staff at the end of 1932, it would be a mistake to reject market analysis, even though, “like many buzzwords,” it had “become banal and been misused.” “We must, if we want to have further success be attentive to the signs of the times.”69 However, while German advertisers remained interested in the design innovations around Europe and the market research and instructional copy coming out of the United States and Britain, what most occupied their thoughts as the economic conditions worsened was the more fundamental quandary of escaping the mistrust of their work and salesmanship more broadly defined. This challenge seemed increasingly difficult, despite the fact that the slump had scared off much of their foreign competition.\n\nthe challenge of the depression To improve the image of the ad industry many German advertisers at the end of the 1920s favored the adoption of reforms in education and professional development. Despite a few programs at various business colleges, there was no uniform training for advertisers. In degree-conscious Germany, this was a major disadvantage to working in an ads-related job. The fact that no comprehensive exams had been passed, and no diploma awarded, only fueled the public stereotype of the ad man as huckster. The tradition of respecting artistic genius—a quality that transcended the practicalities of classroom teaching—had added to the difficulties of coming to consensus about a proper curriculum that could bestow professional status. But by the late 1920s, influenced also by the Anglo-American advertisers, who Germans (perhaps mistakenly) believed enjoyed greater respect in their home countries and by the growing Continental interest in psychology, psychoanalysis, and even sociology, most German advertisers had concluded that it was time to set some standards.\n\n31\n\n32\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nWhen the members of the German Advertising Association (DRV), an umbrella group encompassing everyone from window dressers to independent ad consultants and graphic artists, gathered to discuss their collective future in 1928, they drew also on a certain level of injured national pride to fuel the enthusiasm for reform. Many German advertisers had had enough of articles like the one in the chief American professional journal, Advertising and Selling, that had been reprinted in Die Reklame and began: The German mentality is strange. [Germans] understand better than other nations the most dense and complicated things. Yet they don’t understand the simplest things. Perhaps this explains the fact that German industrialists still have not fully grasped the fact that advertising is a force that deserves respect. If Germany finally recognizes that advertising is lucrative, it will take greater steps on the path to leadership [Führerschaft] than ever before. I bought a product in Munich that appears to render the analogous American commodity worthless. Was it being advertised? Of course not!70\n\nIn the hope of overcoming this criticism, the DRV set three goals for 1929: the “unity and recognition” of all those working in the field; the “creation of systematic, practical and, theoretical training” for everyone in advertising; and the creation of an “office for the assessment of ad materials [Werbsachenprüfamt].” Those planning for the industry’s future also believed that the high percentage of “untrained” professionals hurt the entire ad industry, remarking that virtually no one was prevented from taking a job in advertising or kept out of the professional associations. Not only were there calls for standards among each professional grouping, but also demands for the establishment of city and state advertising schools. Once such uniform training was available, the DRV would be in the position to insist that it be a requirement for admission to the appropriate professional associations. “If the German ad industry makes these changes in 1929,” concluded the author for the DRV, “German businessmen will be convinced more than ever before of the work of advertising, and those abroad will not be able to deny it its due.”71 Regardless of the apparent self-doubt among Germany’s ad professionals, the country could boast an extensive academic and professional literature beyond the trade journals. Dating back to the start of the century, books by Paul Ruben, Viktor Mataja, Rudolf Seyffert, Hans Weidenmueller, and even Christian Kupferberg (from the corporate side) were respected for their serious technical and theoretical contributions.72 There were also institutes in Cologne, Mannheim, Berlin, and Düsseldorf that continued this academic research. Some local and regional associations of-\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nfered continuing education courses and lecture series for men and women already working in the field. What was missing, according to the DRV, was midlevel specialized professional training to bring together the scientific and the practical.73 Once again the DRV highlighted the progress the United States had made in this area years earlier. In a long 1930 article written by the American ad man William Ingersoll, readers of Die Reklame learned how after years of similar struggle, members of New York’s Advertising Men’s Club had stumbled upon the work of Frank Parsons, the former professor of psychology and founder of the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, who helped them establish the foundations of a unified curriculum.74 It is worth noting, however, that while German advertisers seeking greater status for their field turned to the United States for examples, the debate about professionalization was actually far from over in the United States in the 1920s. Roland Marchand highlights two sides of the American debate. Some advertisers expected that the new degrees and awards handed out by universities such as Harvard should and would lead to greater recognition, putting them on par with doctors and lawyers as providing an important social service through their work. There were others, however, who rejected such lofty goals, and insisted that advertising be accepted for what it was—a supremely useful way to increase profits. In this view, worrying about contributing to the social good, or meeting artistic goals, only fed doubts among businessmen that advertising was not crucial to the corporate bottom line. Emphasizing the role that ads could play in sales was the only sensible strategy.75 German advertisers do not appear to have split down these lines, believing instead that their service to society was to bolster the economy through the education of consumers. Despite the declining economic outlook, the industry did have cause for celebration as 1929 arrived. The decision to hold the annual International Advertising Association Congress in Berlin was confirmed.76 This announcement seemed likely to aid all the goals set by the DRV: fostering unity within the association, developing further training opportunities and standards, and advancing their position as a respected profession among business leaders and the public both at home and abroad. The congress had been hosted by American cities in all previous years, except 1924 when London enjoyed the honor. Being granted the same opportunity was a hopeful sign to German advertisers that their contributions to the field were beginning to be noticed among their colleagues abroad. And when news arrived in late 1928 that the Americans\n\n33\n\n34\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nplanned to send a contingent to Berlin larger than the twenty-five hundred who had attended the London congress, members of the DRV grew giddy with anticipation.77 The congress opened on 11 August 1929 and was visited by five thousand advertisers from more than twenty countries. The delegates were busy over the four days with much “speech-applauding, back-patting, beer-quaffing, [and] sightseeing,” according to the reporter for the American news magazine Time. In addition to the four thousand bottles of wine consumed by the twenty-five hundred banquet attendees, there were a variety of serious issues considered, including the role advertising could play for churches and, once again, whether billboards were ruining the German countryside—a criticism raised this time by an American speaker.78 The overriding message of the congress was to convince those watching that advertising, “with all its possibilities of development, studied and investigated by the most able intellects, will introduce a new factor into World Trade, will become the key to universal prosperity.” But this confidence that advertisers could right the economic decline was not the only conclusion that the congress organizers wanted to resonate beyond the walls of the banquet halls. Meeting a decade after the conclusion of the First World War, and with fascism on the rise in Europe, the German hosts also advocated for “peaceful competition” among nations. Advertising, they explained, served as “a free outlet for those forces that formerly led to discord and trouble, [as] the active self-assertion of nations towards the outside world by means of no other weapon than peaceful trade.”79 On the occasion of the meeting, Hanns Brose, one of the most prolific and successful German ad men of his age, who got his start at the Berlin branch of the American firm Dorland, took the opportunity to evaluate what Germany could learn from other countries and vice versa.80 He began by admitting the influence that other nations—namely, the United States— had had on German advertising in the previous decade, largely owing to the political and economic context of postwar reconstruction. The Germans were just getting started, but the “others” had already built “a house with a strong foundation, well lighted rooms, sensible and comfortable, hygienic and aesthetically pleasing . . . . [On] the pediment of the house “The New Advertising” we read the word truth [italicized words are English in the original]. . . . We have learned to love these others as one loves an older and successful brother.” Brose was completely convinced that the American-built house was the model to emulate, and “though [it was] still under debate,” he implored his German colleagues to “recognize that the\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nbasis for effective advertising is not the aesthetic, rather the psychological, that advertising is not designed with artistic methods as much as persuasive ones.” Brose also pointed out that those outside of Germany must respect the give-and-take nature of the relationship—that they would not always hold the lucky hand. Dropping “American text” into German ads would meet with little success. Just as novels and films from abroad did not always speak to “the German psyche,” neither would advertisements that were not created with a German audience in mind. The transatlantic collaboration via study tours and the work of international associations over the last several years had shown Brose, as the World Congress organizers also claimed, that advertisements could contribute to understanding between nations through the economic trade and cultural contact they represented. And as each side learned about the “psychological conditions” of the other, they could become “equal rivals—and partners in a common cause.”81 Men like Brose did not just pin their hopes on advertising’s potential to encourage international peace and prosperity. They also quite sincerely believed that advertising, and their own roles as purveyors of these messages, had a significant role to play in improving the quality of life of their countrymen. Brose would go so far as to say, at the very end of 1929, “Advertising is the only truly democratic manifestation of public life today.” For if everyone was still beholden to various higher authorities, “in our economic decisions we are free.” In fact, Brose hailed, there was “no power on earth” that could force an individual to make a purchase he did not choose to make.82 In the early 1930s, against all evidence to the contrary, advertisers like Brose held on to the image of friendly international collaboration, the idealistic vision of individual consumption as democratic, and the belief that their work was essential to both domestic and international peace and prosperity. The worsening economic crisis led supporters of advertising, such as Alfred Knapp, to press more energetically for a comprehensive training site for ad men and women. In April 1931 he once again insisted that individual consumption was as essential to economic health as production. “It is a clear duty of the government and Germany business community,” Knapp explained, “to provide the necessary means to establish [the German Institute for Advertising Science], the success of which will benefit the entire economy.” Knapp referred specifically to the research monies enjoyed by the Association of German Engineers, and drew on the words of experts who had argued recently in the press and parliament that scientific research was a critical investment during these economically difficult times. Knapp\n\n35\n\n36\n\nFrom Internationalism to “German Advertising”\n\nalso highlighted the Empire Marketing Board of Britain, which spent a majority of its budget on research.83 A similar body in Berlin would be well placed to collaborate with the Handelshochschule, and the research institutes for the press [Deutsches Institut für Zeitungskunde] and for economics and business [Institut für Konjunkturforschung]. The institute would serve as a clearinghouse for all literature produced on advertising, including the various professional journals, and house an archive of current and historical advertising materials. It would gather statistical information about the German market, frame the big theoretical questions about efficacy, provide practical advice to those in the field, and explore noncommercial promotional efforts—what Knapp called “Idea-Advertising” for politics, religion, and public welfare.84 It was an ambitious proposal, and with the economy in a nosedive, Knapp’s vision was not to be realized. The amount of advertising appearing in newspapers and magazines was shrinking, according to one Hamburg newspaper, at a faster rate than purchasing power was dwindling. As consumers became more cautious with their remaining funds, companies anticipated the drop in sales and withdrew their ads from the press to minimize their own losses. Naturally, this retraction weakened the financial health of the press, as well as the advertisers and consumer goods industries more generally. In what appeared as a rather bold and unusual move, the Hamburger Fremdenblatt took out its own ads in its publication—not encouraging people to buy the paper, but explaining to readers that the economy would not improve with such pessimism and fear, reminding business owners that investment in the future was still necessary, and warning everyone that all sectors of the economy were dependent on one another.85 Articles like this one became more and more prevalent. Politics too became more evident in the public discussions of the industry. Some authors said outright that the spirit of the times was one that encouraged “collectivism” in response to financial expediency. Gemeinschaftswerbungen, ads that promote a whole sector, such as the milk industry, became more common and helped businesses pool their dwindling funds. While this response to the economic crisis was acceptable to most advertisers, anxiety grew that the trend away from competition might lead to a future in which ads were wholly superfluous.86 As the DRV planned its “Advertising Day” for 1932, they selected the rather desperate-sounding slogan “Advertise and Don’t Despair!” to promote the event. The meeting’s organizers emphasized that their work was not self-indulgent, and reiterated that without ads there are no sales. At\n\nAdvertising in the Weimar Republic\n\nthe same time, however, there was also a greater connection than ever to the dire political context and the deepening influence of the right. On the meeting’s agenda were speeches on “Advertising and the State” and “Advertising and Po"
