Fischer, Federica Maruccia, Katiuska Rosas, Ignacio Delgado Alvarez, Anna Rey-Perez, Gemma Piella, Aykut Eken, Marcelino Baguena, Paola Cano, Carolina Fajardo Vega, Maria Antonia Poca and Turgut Durduran2\n\n1ICFO\n\n21ICFO-Institut de Ciéncies Fotóniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain; 2Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) has several potential uses in the management of cerebral pathologies. ICP manifests itself as a fluctuating signal caused by passive changes of cerebral artery walls driven by arterial blood pressure and dynamic increase in blood volume during cardiac/respiratory cycles. Thus, several non-invasive methods (e.g. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound-based methods [1]) were proposed for non-invasive ICP monitoring, but none was accurate enough for clinical practice. Recently, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) measures of microvascular blood flow - blood flow index (BFI) - were proposed as an alternative and several works utilizing its pulsatile features for characterization/estimation of ICP were published [2,3].\n\nAim: We explore the potential of DCS in ICP monitoring and examine relationship between BFI and ICP fluctuations.\n\nMethod: DCS data synchronized with invasive ICP were acquired from several patient cohorts (adult, children) and a detailed analysis was carried out to identify patterns of ICP alterations. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms utilizing Recurrent Neural Network were applied to estimate absolute ICP.\n\nResults/Conclusions: Our results (Fig.1) demonstrated that BFI and its spectral content are effective in detecting ICP patterns (e.g. so-called “ICP-waves”) and, combined with ML algorithms, can estimate ICP values with high accuracy close to clinical standards. To strengthen the reliability of our methods, we are collecting more data from various populations, enhancing our ML algorithms and advancing the analysis with additional physiological information. We present an ultra-portable DCS-ML-based device as a practical bed-side “ICP-meter”.\n\n1. Cardim J. Neurotrauma, 2016\n\n2. Fischer J. Neurotrauma, 2020\n\n3.

Turner4, Pilar Delgado3 and Anna Rosell1\n\n1VHIR\n\n2HUVH\n\n3VHIR/HUVH\n\n4ISGlobal\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: the combustion of fossil fuels, mainly by diesel engines, generates Diesel Exhaust Particles (DEP) which has become the main source of Particulate Matter (PM), a major air pollutant in urban areas. These particles are a risk factor for stroke with 5.6% of strokes attributed to the PM exposure.\n\nAim: our aim is to evaluate the effect of DEP exposure on clot formation and lysis in the context of stroke.\n\nMethods: An ex-vivo clot formation and lysis turbidimetric assay has been conducted in human and mouse plasma samples from ischemic stroke or control subjects exposed to DEP or control conditions. Experimental DEP exposure was achieved by nasal instillation in Blab/c mice (n = 56), or by ex-vivo exposure in human plasma (n = 32). A cohort of hypertensive subjects living in low/high polluted areas was also analyzed (n = 31). Cerebral ischemia in mice was conducted by the permanent distal MCAocclusion.\n\nResults: results show consistent pro-thrombogenic features in plasma (LagTime, Clot formation rate and maximum absorbance) after human ischemic stroke and mouse cerebral ischemia (permanent distal MCAo), boosted by the presence of DEP. Otherwise, thrombolysis times were increased after mouse ischemia (lysis time, p < 0.05) but not DEP exposed mice, after chronic treatment. Finally, subjects living in areas with high PM levels presented accelerated thrombolysis compared to those living in low polluted areas (lysis time and clot time p < 0.05).\n\nConclusions: Overall, our results point at a disbalance of the plasma thrombogenic/lytic system in presence of DEP which could impact on ischemic stroke onset, clot size and thrombolytic treatment.\n\nSubarachnoid Haemorrhage Leads to Desialilation of Hippocampal Glycocalyx Followed by Complement System Activation\n\nEugene Golanov, Angelique Regnier-Golanov, Haley Goodwin, Nino Kvirkvelia, Rosemarie Le and Gavin Britz\n\nHMRI\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) – the accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space - is the most fatal stroke, with a 40% mortality rate and 95% of survivors suffer permanent disabilities. Hippocampal neuroinflammation following SAH has been recognized as a potential cause of post-SAH syndrome, and the complement system, in particular, has been identified as a major player. Levels of C1q, the activating protein of the classical pathway of the complement system, has been found to be significantly higher in hippocampus (HPC) following SAH. However, mechanisms of C1q activation, the first step in complement cascade activation, remain unknown.\n\nAim: Our earlier data demonstrated that SAH triggers hippocampal neuroinflammation, which involves microglia activation and release of sialidase “trimming” terminal glycocalyx sialic acid (SA) and exposing potential binding sites for C1q.\n\nMethod: To test this hypothesis in perforation of the Willis circle model of SAH we employed immunohistochemical staining using various lectins to detect changes in sialylation and sialidase inhibitor (SI) treatment to explore changes in the hippocampal layers in SAH and Sham mouse brains.\n\nResults: Levels of C1q increased significantly in the hippocampal molecular layer (ML) and stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) (P < 0.002 and P < 0.03, resp. n = 6) following SAH (areas of perforant pathway termination). Calculation of C1q/SA immunostaining ratio showed an increase (P < 0.005, n = 3) ratio in SAH versus Sham animals suggesting increased C1q binding due to cleavage of SA. Cleavage of terminal SA was confirmed by increased exposure of β-Galactose and N-acetyl-galactosamine (P < 0.04, n = 3, P < 0.005, n = 3, resp.) after SAH. Intra ventricular administration of SI reversed hippocampal synaptic loss (P < 0.0004, n = 6). Slice treatment with exogenous SI resulted in (P < 0.02, n = 4) higher levels of SA in Sham than in SAH animals.\n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that desialylated glycans form a substrate for C1q binding and its subsequent activation respective activation of innate complement system.\n\nEarly and long-lasting white matter damage in the perforant pathway following subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice\n\nAngelique Regnier-Golanov, Eugene Golanov, Rosemarie Le, Christof Karmonik, Haley Goodwin, Nino Kvirkvelia and Gavin Britz\n\nHMRI\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), when the blood extravasates into the subarachnoid space, is the least frequent stroke but has a high fatality rate (40%). SAH often debilitates people of working age (<55–65 years) and impedes them from going back to work. In our mouse model of SAH, we observed the development of chronic behavioral abnormalities consistent with those observed in humans. Our RNA next-generation sequencing study of the hippocampus, structure of learning and memory, at 4-days, showed a significant downregulation in the myelin/oligodendrocytes-related genes.\n\nAim: The aim of the present study is to show the existence of early myelin/oligodendrocytes and white matter damages occurring in the perforant pathway, connecting the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus that may play a major role in the cognitive deficits observed.\n\nMethod: SAH was induced by the perforation of the circle of Willis. In Sham, the filament was inserted without perforation. At 96h, brains were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) of MBP (Myelin Basic Protein). At 10–12months following SAH, we conducted diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI-MRI) in ex vivo brain to assess the water diffusion in the brain fibers and explore their structure.\n\nResults: At 96h, IHC for MBP tended to increase in all layers of the hippocampus and significantly in the stratum radiatum (P = 0.002) and the pyramidal layers (P = 0.03; n = 3 SAH, 3 Sham). These results are consistent with the destruction of myelin that may uncover more epitopes explaining an increase in staining. Increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) measuring the directionality of the fibers, was observed in the entorhinal cortex (P < 0.05) but no significant FA changes were observed in the hippocampus, suggesting a remodelling of the white fibers over time.\n\nConclusions: While further investigations are needed, the present results confirm early time points and long-lasting white matter abnormalities occurring after SAH.\n\nOptimal anti-hypertensive therapy in patients with severe carotid stenosis\n\nKang-Ho Choi1, Doo-Young Kim2, Seo-Young Choi2, Soo-Yeon Kim2, Trinh thi hong Phuong2 and Ja-Hae Kim3\n\n1Department of Neurology, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital\n\n2Chonnam National University Hospital\n\n3Department of Nuclear Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, Department of AI Convergence, Chonnam National University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: To evaluate the temporal changes of cerebral perfusion in patients with asymptomatic ipsilateral cerebral artery stenosis according to the intensity of anti-hypertensive therapy and to determine the correlation between the posttreatment Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) findings and the initial MR abnormalities.\n\nMethods: This prospective study enrolled 22 patients with asymptomatic ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis. All underwent two consecutive Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT and brain MRI before and after intensive medical treatment at the 1-year interval. Demographic variables, underlying medical diseases, the affected side of the involved cerebral artery, and the severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain MRI were collected. The quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the mean and total cerebral blood flow (CBF) of both the affected and normal cerebral hemispheres by a single blind observer. The CBFs and their change were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\nResults: The mean and total CBFs before treatment showed no differences in the affected and normal hemispheres according to the demographic and clinical variables. After 1-year treatment, the mean and total CBFs were improved in both the affected and normal hemispheres. Compared between group 1 (patients with no or mild degree of WMH) and group 2 (patients with moderate or severe degree of WMH), the mean and total CBFs in group 1 showed slight improvement in both the affected and normal side, and the changes of CBFs were insignificant. However, the mean and total CBFs in group 2 showed marked improvement in both the affected (p = 0.019) and the normal side (p = 0.066).\n\nConclusion: Cerebral perfusion of patients with asymptomatic ipsilateral cerebral artery stenosis was improved in both affected and normal cerebral hemispheres after 1-year intensive anti-hypertensive therapy. Improvement of cerebral perfusion after intensive anti-hypertensive treatment was more marked in patients with high WMH on the initial MRI.\n\nOpen-source statistical and data processing tools for wide-field optical imaging data in mice\n\nLindsey Brier and Joseph Culver\n\nWashington University In St. Louis School of Medicine\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Wide-field optical imaging (WOI) can produce concurrent hemodynamic and cell-specific calcium recordings across the entire cerebral cortex in animal models. There have been multiple studies using WOI to image mouse models with various environmental or genetic manipulations in order to understand various human diseases. Despite the utility of pursuing mouse WOI alongside human functional imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, or positron emission tomography, PET), and the multitude of analysis toolboxes in the human imaging literature, there is not an available open-source, user-friendly data processing and statistical analysis toolbox for WOI data.\n\nAim: To assemble a MATLAB toolbox for processing and statistically testing WOI data, as described and adapted to combine techniques from multiple WOI groups and fMRI.\n\nMethod: We outline our MATLAB toolbox on GitHub with multiple data processing and analysis packages and translate a commonly used statistical approach from the fMRI literature to the WOI data. To illustrate the utility of our MATLAB toolbox, we demonstrate the ability of the processing and analysis framework to detect a well-established deficit in a mouse model of stroke and plot activation areas during an electrical hindpaw stimulus experiment. Both of these experiments utilize a small sample size to contrast the different levels of spatial specificity afforded by hemodynamics and calcium imaging while maintaining statistical significance.\n\nResults: Our processing toolbox and statistical methods isolate a somatosensory based deficit three days following photothrombotic stroke (N = 4) and cleanly localize sensory stimulus activations (N = 2).\n\nConclusions: The toolbox presented here details an open-source, user-friendly compilation of WOI processing tools with statistical methods to apply to any biological question investigated with WOI techniques.\n\nNight photo-therapy of cerebral hemorrhages\n\nOxana Semyachkina-Glushkovskaya1, Ivan Fedosov2, Alexander Shirokov2, Inna Blokhina2, Nikita Navolokin3, Andrey Terskov2 and Juergen Kurths4\n\n1Saratov State University; Humboldt University\n\n2Saratov State University\n\n3Saratov State Medical University\n\n4Humboldt University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is the most fatal form of brain injury. However, the therapy of IVH is very limited, and new strategies are needed to reduce hematoma expansion. In our recent review we highlight new trends in transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) of the meningeal lymphatics (MLVs) during deep sleep as a breakthrough technology for the effective removal of wastes and toxins from the brain in order to increase the brain neuroprotection (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24043221).\n\nAim: The aim of this pioneering study was the analysis of effectiveness of night and daytime tPBM in the IVH therapy via tPBM-related activation of lymphatic removal of red blood cells (RBCs) from the mouse brain.\n\nMethod: To produce an IVH model, autologous blood (50 μl) was injected into the right lateral ventricle in male BALB/c mice (25–28 g). A LED 1250 nm (9 J/cm2) was used as a source of irradiation during night sleep (it was detected by telemetric EEG) and wakefulness. The therapeutic effects of tPBM was evaluated by the analysis of the size of hematoma, intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, lymphatic removal of RBCs (the confocal analysis of RBCs in MVLs and in the deep cervical lymph nodes), mortality rate, and behavioural tests.\n\nResults: Our results clearly demonstrate that night tPBM causes the more intense accelerating the lymphatic RBCs evacuation from the ventricles and better decrease in ICP build-up that is accompanied by more effective improving neurological outcome and reducing mortality than daytime tPBM.\n\nConclusions: We discover that night tPBM is a more promising candidate as an effective method in the IVH therapy than daytime tPBM. The night rPBM can be a novel bedside, readily applicable, and commercially viable technology for treatment of IVH and other types of brain bleedings. This study was supported by RSF project No.23-75-30001.\n\nEffects of transplantation of human skull-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a simulated microgravity on a rat model of cerebral infarction\n\nMasashi Kuwabara1, Takafumi Mitsuhara1, Takahito Okazaki1, Masaaki Takeda1, Daizo Ishii1, Kiyoharu Shimizu1, Masahiro Hosogai1, Yuyo Maeda1, Louis Yuge2 and Nobutaka Horie1\n\n1Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University\n\n2Division of Bio-Environmental Adaptation Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for stem cells used in regenerative medicine because of their proliferative and multidifferentiation potential and their transplantation effects on models of central nervous system diseases. Previously, we reported that human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMCSs) have higher neuronal differentiation potential than conventional human bone marrow-derived MSCs (bMSCs) and improved motor function when transplanted into ischemic stroke model. On the other hand, we also reported that cMSCs cultured under simulated microgravity (MG) environment showed higher expression of neurotrophic factors than cMSCs cultured under normal gravity (1G) environment, and improved functional prognosis after transplantation into brain injury and spinal cord injury models.\n\nAim: In the present study, we investigated the transplantation effect of cMSCs cultured in the MG environment on a rat model of cerebral infarction.\n\nMethod: Cerebral infarction model rats were created, and cMSCs cultured in a 1G environment and cMSCs cultured in an MG environment were administered via vein one day after the creation of the infarction, respectively.\n\nResults: The results showed that the group transplanted with cMSCs cultured in the MG environment (group MG) showed significantly improved motor function after transplantation compared to the group transplanted with cMSCs cultured in the 1G environment (group 1G). Furthermore, gene expression analysis of cerebral infarct tissue showed significantly higher expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and synaptophysin (SYP) and significantly lower expression of sortilin 1 (SORT1) in the MG group.\n\nConclusions: These findings indicate that cMSCs cultured in the MG environment inhibit neural apoptosis and have more potent effects on angiogenesis, synapse formation, and repair against cell damage, and cMSCs cultured in the MG environment may be a useful source of stem cells for the recovery of motor function after ischemic stroke.\n\nFirst-in-human PET imaging biodistribution studies of methyl N4-(7-[18F]fluoro-9H-fluoren-2-yl)asparaginate tracer RP-115 in healthy volunteers\n\nJohn Gerdes1, Chih-kai Chao1, Joseph Blecha2, Ilona Polvoy2, Ryan Nillo2, Youngho Seo2, Henry VanBrocklin2, David Wilson2 and John Forsayeth1\n\n1Rio Pharmaceuticals, Inc\n\n2University of California, San Francisco\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The fluorine-18 PET imaging tracer methyl N4-(7-[18F]fluoro-9H-fluoren-2-yl)asparaginate, known as RP-115, hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid metabolite in the central nervous system (CNS) that specifically binds to the L-glutamate excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) protein located primarily on astrocyte cell membranes.\n\nAim: The objective of this first-in-human study was to investigate the safety and radiation dosimetry profile of RP-115 in healthy volunteers and quantitatively assess radioactivity biodistribution in peripheral organs and CNS tissues.\n\nMethod: Four healthy volunteers (2 males and 2 females; 57–75 years) were enrolled. RP-115 bolus intravenous injections (188.7–355.2 MBq) were followed by multiple PET-MR scans over 3 hours. Volumes-of-interest were defined for multiple organs and time-integrated activity coefficients (TIAC) were derived. The TIACs were used for absorbed and effective dose calculations via Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment (OLINDA).\n\nResults: The RP-115 injections and PET-MR scans were well tolerated and no participant adverse events were reported. Biodistribution analysis showed activity in both peripheral organs in addition to brain and spine. The highest integrated uptake was in the kidneys and urinary bladder. Additional uptake was found in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, brain and spine. The estimated mean effective doses for RP-115 were: males 18.3 µSv/MBq (16.1–20.4 µSv/MBq) and females 25.1 µSv/MBq (24.1–26.1 µSv/MBq). Brain and spine tissue standardized uptake values (SUV) were dependent on tracer dose amount and ranged between ∼1.0–2.0 SUV.\n\nConclusions: This study shows that RP-115 in healthy volunteers is well tolerated and results in a radiation dosimetry profile similar to other established [18F]labeled PET tracers. The kidneys were identified as the critical organ. Significant brain and spine tissue SUV profiles demonstrate the strong potential for human RP-115 EAAT2 targeted CNS PET imaging applications. These findings, in addition to our ongoing efforts to determine regional CNS EAAT2 density estimates will be discussed.\n\nFigure (optional)\n\nInvestigation of the effects of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in a brain injury rat model using longitudinal electrophysiological evaluation\n\nYuyo Maeda, Takafumi Mitsuhara, Masaaki Takeda, Kiyoharu Shimizu, Masashi Kuwabara, Masahiro Hosogai and Nobutaka Horie\n\nDepartment of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Hiroshima University has independently established cranial bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) and compared their neurotrophic effects, such as neurotrophic factor expression and effects of transplantation, with those of other MSCs in a central nervous system injury model.\n\nAim: In this study, we investigated the effects of cMSCs in a brain injury rat model using our previously established longitudinal electrophysiological evaluation method.\n\nMethod: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used to construct a brain injury model. The study included rats that had been transplanted with cMSCs from the tail vein on the first day after injury (cMSCs group, n = 8). A control group (rats with brain injury but without cMSCs transplantation, n = 7) and a sham group (rats without brain injury but with craniotomy, n = 7) were also created for comparison. The Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) scale scores and inclined plate test measurements were recorded for motor function evaluations. Transcranial electrically stimulated motor-evoked potentials were recorded in the rats’ forelimbs for electrophysiological evaluations, and the amplitude recovery rate was measured. Histopathological evaluation of the rat brains was performed 4 weeks post injury.\n\nResults: Compared with the sham group, the other two groups showed a significant decrease in motor function after injury. The cMSCs group revealed a significant recovery of motor function, both in the inclined plate test the day following transplantation and in the BBB score 5 days post-transplantation, compared with the control group. With regard to electrophysiological evaluation, the cMSCs group also demonstrated a significant recovery of amplitude 14 days post-transplantation, compared with the control group. Histopathological evaluation confirmed cerebral contusions in the cMSCs and control groups.\n\nConclusions: We established the effects of cMSCs transplantation on motor function and electrophysiological activity in a brain injury model. We intend to perform further research to investigate the mechanisms underlying electrophysiological recovery associated with cMSCs transplantation.\n\nCerebral blood flow during brain cooling in a severe ischemic stroke porcine model\n\nOlivia Tong1, Kevin J. Chung1, Jennifer Hadway2, Laura Morrison2, Lise Desjardins2, Susan Tyler2, Marcus Flamminio2, Lynn Keenliside2 and Ting-Yim Lee1\n\n1Lawson Health Research Institute; Robarts Research Institute; Western University\n\n2Lawson Health Research Institute\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Despite the success of reperfusion therapy by mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion stroke, not all treated patients fully recovered their function. Selective brain cooling could be adjuvant therapy to maximize the beneficial effect of reperfusion. However, clinical application is limited by the lack of optimal delivery methods and unknown treatment parameters. Monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) may guide the optimal depth and duration of brain cooling.\n\nAim: We aim to determine the relationship between CBF and brain cooling, delivered by our in-house developed Vortex tube IntraNasal Cooling Instrument (VINCI), in severe ischemic stroke.\n\nMethod: 15 pigs were subjected to ischemic stroke by vasoconstrictor (ET-1). The animals were then assigned to normothermia/control (n = 5) and treatment (n = 10) groups. The treatment group had cooling with VINCI at a target temperature (3–5°C from normothermia) for 17 h before rewarming. Throughout the study, vitals and CBF by CT perfusion (CTP) were recorded. To assess the utility of CBF, it was compared to online vitals and histology at sacrifice.\n\nResults: All animals (n = 5) with severe global hyperperfusion (high CBF) before rewarming were associated with abnormal vitals (p = 0.04) with severe neuronal damage. Global hyperperfusion preceded significant changes in physiological variables from baseline. When severe hyperperfusion was absent (n = 5), subacute injuries were averted. This was corroborated by (1) the predicted lesion volume by CTP at the target temperature matched the true infarct by histology, and (2) a smaller mean true infarct volume compared to that with global hyperperfusion (p = 0.04).\n\nConclusions: Global hyperperfusion during cooling could be an early marker of ineffective neuroprotection in severe ischemic stroke. In future, VINCI-enabled brain cooling could be guided by CBF imaging as a neuroprotective therapy for ischemic stroke. This work lays the groundwork toward individualized selective brain cooling.\n\nGABAergic system is vulnerable to amyloid pathology in aged Alzheimer’s diseases model; neuroPET studies in APPswe/PS2\n\nJae Yong Choi, Se Jong Oh, Kyung Rok Nam, Kyung Jun Kang\n\nKorea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the leading major cause of dementia. Since the deposition of senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles is identified as a major pathology in AD, many researchers have attempted to conquer AD by targeting these proteinopathies. However, we don’t know about the obvious mechanism of AD.\n\nAim: The aim is to investigate how amyloid pathological change affects the neurotransmitter systems in an AD animal model.\n\nMethod: Double APPswe/PS2 mice (21 months of age, AD, n = 6) and age-matched wild-type mice (WT, n = 6) underwent consecutive neuroPET imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Firstly, glucose (18F-FDG) and amyloid PET (18F-florbetaben) were performed to evaluate the neuronal integrity and amyloid pathology respectively. Then, glutamate (18F-FPEB) and GABA PET (18F-flumazenil) were acquired to evaluate the excitatory-inhibitory neurotransmission system. And, dopamine PET was performed using 18F-fallypride. To elucidate the neurochemical changes, MRS experiment was performed. After molecular imaging studies, animals were sacrificed, and the amyloid pathology was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis in the hippocampus.\n\nResults: Amyloid PET showed that radioactivities in AD group was 6–12% higher than those in the WT. In the glutamatergic and the GABAergic system, AD group showed a 25–27% decrease and a 14–35% increase in compared to the WT group in the cortical and limbic areas. The dopaminergic system in the striatum of the AD group had a 29% decreased striatal uptake compared to that of the WT group. MRS studies also showed a significant reduction of glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, and taurine in the AD group. In the IHC experiments, positive Aβ42 cells in AD were 375% - 417% higher than those in WT.\n\nConclusions: GABAergic system is the most vulnerable to amyloid pathology.\n\nFigure\n\nUsefulness of early CT perfusion status to predict prognosis in non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage\n\nMin Kim1, So young Park1, Sung Eun Lee2 and Ji Man Hong3\n\n1Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine\n\n2Department of Emergency Medicine, Ajou University School of Medicine\n\n32Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common cause of stroke and is associated with a high risk of death and disability, especially in high ICH scores. However, CT perfusion images commonly used in acute stroke diagnosis have been rarely used in ICH treatment decisions or prognosis.\n\nAim: We were to elucidate the relationship between CT perfusion images and ICH prognosis.\n\nMethod: Our study included patients who had acute neurological symptoms within 8 hours of activation of the thrombolysis code from September 2020 to October 2022. Among patients with acute stroke code activation in a referral stroke center, only ICH patients were included. The outcome was measured with a 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS): good outcome of 0 to 4 points and poor outcome of 5 to 6 points. ICH volume was measured by ABC/2 method. The perfusion change of the CT perfusion image was quantitatively measured by the RAPID program.\n\nResults: A total of 80 ICH patients were recruited, of which 28 were classified as good outcome and 52 as poor outcome groups. The poor outcome group (vs. good outcome group) had initially lower GCS, larger ICH volume, more frequent IVH, and more higher ICH score (p < 0.001). The poor outcome group (vs. good outcome group) had significant delay of Tmax and lower values of CBF and CBV (p < 0.001). The decrease in perfusion status to the opposite side as well as the lesion side where ICH occurred at Tmax > 4s, the largest decrease in the perfusion maps, was significantly reduced in the poor outcome group (102.6 ± 149.6 vs 292.3 ± 226.9, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that the initial perfusion status in ICH is related to clinical prognosis and can be used as a predictor of poor outcomes.\n\nOsteopontin Isoforms as Novel Regulators of Myelination and Axonal Integrity\n\nXiaoyang Wang1, Gisela Nilsson2, Amin Mottahedin3, Aura Zelco3, Volker Lauschke4, Joakim Ek3 and Jianmei Leavenworth5\n\n1University of Gothenburg\n\n2Centre of Perinatal Medicine & Health, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 41685, Sweden\n\n3Centre of Perinatal Medicine & Health, Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg 40530, Sweden\n\n4Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 17177, Sweden\n\n5Department of Neurosurgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Abnormal myelination is critical in white matter diseases such as preterm white matter injury and multiple sclerosis. Osteopontin (OPN) has been suggested to play a role in myelination, but whether the isoforms of OPN have isoform-specific involvement in myelination remains unknown.\n\nAim: This study aimed to investigate whether the secreted isoform of OPN (sOPN) or the intracellular isoform (iOPN) has isoform-specific involvement in myelination and axonal integrity.\n\nMethod: We generated OPN-KO mice, which lacked both OPN isoforms in all cells, and OLs-iOPN-KI mice, which lacked sOPN systemically but expressed iOPN specifically in oligodendrocytes. We conducted transcriptome analysis (RNAseq) of isolated oligodendrocytes from mouse brains at postnatal day 5 (n = 7/genotype) and evaluated myelin formation using transmission electron microscopy (n = 5/genotype) in postnatal day 12 and adult mice.\n\nResults: RNAseq analysis revealed that the absence of both OPN isoforms in OPN-KO mice led to an enrichment of genes and pathways related to increased myelination and altered cell cycle control. This resulted in increased axonal myelination, indicated by a significant increased myelin thickness in OPN-KO mice compared to controls (p = 0.0001). In contrast, OLs-iOPN-KI mice showed differential regulation of genes and pathways related to increased cell adhesion, motility, and decreased axonal/neuronal development. OLs-iOPN-KI mice showed abnormal myelin formation in the early phase of myelination in young mice at postnatal day 12 (p = 0.02) and signs of axonal degeneration in adulthood.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that sOPN may act as a negative regulator of myelination in the final stages of myelination. Expression of OLs-iOPN in the absence of sOPN resulted in axonal degeneration, suggesting that the expression of sOPN and iOPN needs to be balanced for proper myelination and axonal integrity. Overall, this study highlights the isoform-specific involvement of OPN and the potential interplay between the isoforms in myelination and axonal integrity.\n\nExploring the Efficacy of Alpha1-Antitrypsin in Protecting the Developing Brain against Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury\n\nChanglian Zhu1, Shan Zhang2, Juan Song2 and Xiaoyang Wang1\n\n1University of Gothenburg\n\n2Zhengzhou University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Preterm brain injury is a significant cause of lifelong disabilities, and effective therapies are limited. Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is an endogenous inhibitor of serine proteinases with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and cytoprotective properties. AAT may have potential as a therapeutic agent for preterm brain injury.\n\nAim: This study aimed to investigate whether AAT has neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of preterm brain injury.\n\nMethod: Preterm brain injury was induced on postnatal day 5 in mouse pups by cutting their right common carotid arteries between two ligations followed by hypoxia induction. Brain injury was evaluated through immunohistochemistry staining and magnetic resonance imaging. Fluoro-Jade B and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to investigate neuronal cell death and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Motor function and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by CatWalk gait analysis and the open field test.\n\nResults: After hypoxia-ischemia (HI) insult, AAT treatment resulted in reduced BBB permeability, reduced neuronal cell death and caspase-3 activation, and inhibition of microglia activation, all of which contributed to alleviating brain injury. Additionally, AAT administration significantly improved HI-induced motor function deficiencies in mice. The neuroprotective effect of AAT was more pronounced in male mice.\n\nConclusions: AAT treatment is neuroprotective against preterm brain injury in neonatal mice, and the effect is more significant in males. These findings suggest that AAT may be a promising therapeutic agent for preterm brain injury, particularly in males, although further research is needed to evaluate its clinical potential.\n\nLeptomeningeal neutrophils and IL-36γ in inflammation-sensitized pediatric stroke\n\nChia-Yi (Alex) Kuan\n\nUniversity of Virginia School of Medicine\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Infections and inflammation have been identified as significant risk factors in pediatric stroke, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear.\n\nAim/Methods: We utilized the Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-sensitized photothrombosis (PT) model to test the roles of immune infiltrates in a murine model of pediatric stroke.\n\nResults: Here, First, we observed a more significant influx of neutrophils with a hyper-activation status in brain parenchyma following LPS/PT than pure-PT stroke in postnatal day 16 mice. Depletion of neutrophils, but not monocytes, led to a diminished infraction in LPS/PT-injured mice, suggesting preferential functions of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of pediatric stroke. We then found neutrophil accumulation in leptomeningeal spaces prior to brain infiltration within 6–24 h onset of stroke in P16 mice. We identified neutrophil invasion across the pial-meningeal barrier after stroke using photo-convertible KikGR mice and intravital imaging plus flow cytometry. In addition, RNA sequencing showed major transcriptome differences between leptomeningeal and blood-borne neutrophils in stroke-injured brain parenchyma. Specifically, we detected high expression of IL-36 in leptomeningeal neutrophils during the pediatric stroke. Intra-cisterna magna injection of IL-36Ra—a natural peptide that antagonizes IL-36 signaling—after stroke reduced infractions.\n\nConclusions: Our results implicate the leptomeningeal barrier as an important route for neutrophil infiltration in pediatric stroke, which may suggest therapeutic targets\n\nFigure:\n\n(A,B) t-SNE projection of scRNA-Seq clustering in leptomeningeal CD45+ cells in sham and 24 h post-LPS/PT mice. A is color-coded for these two conditions. B is cell-type annotated based on cluster-enriched DEGs. (C) Expression of IL-36γ on t-SNE projection is highly enriched in the neutrophilic infiltrates.\n\nRelationship between EndothelialGlycocalyx and new cerebral infarction after endovascular treatment in patients with intracranial artery stenosis\n\nFangfang Zhao\n\nChinese Society for Innovative Drug Development\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: It was to study predictive value for new cerebral infarction of glycocalyx in patients with severe intracranial arterial stenosis(ICAS) .\n\nMethod: Plasma samples from healthy individuals and patients with ICAS were detected for different components of Glycocalyx. The risk factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The risk model is presented in Nomogram form and evaluated.\n\nResult: Compared with healthy individuals, the levels of Syndecan-1, Syndecan-2, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, Glypican, Biglycan in plasma of patients with ICAS were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), and the levels of Syndecan-4, heparan sulfate, keratin sulfate, CD44 were significantly increased (p < 0.05) . Univariate analysis showed that the history of diabetes, Eccentric, Remodeling index (>1.05), hyperglycemia, increased Syndecan-4, and increased hyaluronic acid were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05) .Multivariate analysis showed that Eccentric (OR = 3.599, 95% CI: 1.168 ∼ 12.478, P = 0.032) and hyaluronic acid (OR = 5.542, 95% CI: 1.545 ∼ 23.573, P = 0.013) were risk factors (p < 0.05) .The risk model of Eccentric, Remodeling index, Blood glucose, HA, Age was presented as a Nomogram. The model had good discrimination and accuracy, with C index of 0.8095051 (95% CI, 0.7286209–0.8903893) .Further analysis showed that plasma hyaluronic acid level was positively correlated with fibrinogen, hsCRP, HbA1C, ApoB and blood glucose (P < 0.05) .Multivariate analysis showed that Fibrinogen and HbA1C were the factors affecting the change of hyaluronic acid.\n\nConclusion: We evaluated the vascular endothelial health status of patients with severe ICAS by more comprehensive detection of plasma EG components, and found that hyaluronic acid plays an important role in predicting the occurrence of adverse events of cerebral infarction after endovascular treatment in patients with ICAS.\n\nDifferences in cerebral oxidative stress between early Alzheimer’s disease and healthy controls analyzed using multimodality images from PET/MRI\n\nHidehiko Okazawa, Masamichi Ikawa, Tetsuya Mori, Akira Makino, Munenobu Nogami, Yasushi Kiyono and Hirotaka Kosaka\n\nUniversity of Fukui\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The oxidative stress imaging using [64Cu]diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (ATSM) has been established and applied to neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nAim: To evaluate brain oxidative stress in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (eAD), PET/MRI multimodality images were compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC).\n\nMethods: Thirty-five eAD (71 ± 8y.o.) and 20 HC (72 ± 8y.o.) underwent PET/MRI using both [11C]PiB and [64Cu]ATSM with dynamic acquisition. Multiple MRI sequences were acquired during the PET scans including 3D-T1WI, MR-perfusion (ASL), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Using late-phase static PiB-PET data, the centiloid scale for each subject was obtained using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) image with reference region of the cerebellum. To evaluate oxidative stress in the brain, three parameters of Cu-ATSM PET were compared; SUVR, influx rate (Kin) from the slope of the Patlak plot method and rate constant k3 from NLS-fitting. Regional cerebral values were statistically compared.\n\nResults: There was a significant MMSE difference between the eAD (23.5 ± 3.4) and HC (29.1 ± 1.6). All eAD had positive and HC had negative cortical accumulation with mean PiB-centiloid scales of 85.8 ± 30.9 and 0.5 ± 6.1 (P < 0.0001). The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of eAD showed significantly greater Kin compared with HC. The overall k3 were greater in eAD, particularly in the hippocampus. Kin images of the eAD showed significant regional reduction in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right posterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) after global normalization. The differences in ACC were also observed in the rs-fMRI analysis. ASL images showed significant reductions in the parietal lobes and PCC of eAD. DTI images showed no significant differences in white matter function, consistent with PiB accumulation.\n\nConclusions: [64Cu]ATSM-PET/MRI elucidated cerebral oxidative stress in eAD defined by elevation of centiloid in cerebral cortices. Multimodality analysis showed regional differences in the cingulate cortex and PHG. PET/MRI is useful to evaluate brain neurodegenerative changes.\n\nAssessing the efficacy of sodium selenate as a disease-modifying treatment for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy\n\nCassandra Marotta1, Kelly Bertram2, Andrew Evans3, John O'Sullivan4, Thomas Kimber5, Simon Lewis6, Stephen Tisch7, Terence O'Brien1 and Lucy Vivash1\n\n1Monash University\n\n2Alfred Hospital\n\n3Royal Melbourne Hospital\n\n4University of Queensland\n\n5Royal Adelaide Hospital\n\n6University of Sydney\n\n7St Vincents Hospital Sydney\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative movement disorder for which there is currently no disease modifying treatments. The primary pathology of PSP is the accumulation of hyperphosorylated tau. It has been shown that sodium selenate increases the upregulation of protein phosphatase 2 which increases the dephosphorylation of tau making sodium selenate a possible therapeutic treatment for PSP.\n\nAim: This is a multi-site, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium selenate as a disease modifying treatment for PSP.\n\nMethod: Up to 70 participants with probable PSP will be recruited into the study and randomised (1:1) to receive either sodium selenate or placebo (15mg tds) for 52 weeks. The primary study outcome will be change in MRI volume composite (frontal lobe+midbrain–3rd ventricle) over the 52 week treatment period. The percentage change of the volume composite between the screening and week 52 scans will be calculated and group differences between the two treatment arms will be compared. Secondary outcome measures will include change on the PSP rating scale, clinical global impression of change, and change in midbrain mean diffusivity.\n\nResults: Presently, 19 patients have been screened, resulting in 3 screen fails, 15 randomisations and 1 awaiting randomisation. Of the 15 patients randomised, 3 have completed the study, 1 withdrew early (due to an adverse event) and 11 remain on treatment. Baseline characteristics of randomised patients are: Age median 64 years (range 47–74), male (n = 10) and PSPRS total score: mean 37.4 (range 11–61). To date safety has been good with no serious adverse events related to treatment.\n\nConclusions: Recruitment is ongoing and is expected to complete in March 2024, with last patient last visit in June 2025.\n\nThe effects of early life stress on neurotransmitter system related to excitation–inhibition balance and mood; a sex-specific evaluation\n\nSe Jong Oh, Kyung Jun Kang, Kyung Rok Nam, Namhun Lee, Jae Yong Choi\n\nKorea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Early life stress (ELS) is strongly associated with psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia in adulthood. Many previous studies have focused on molecular biology aspect of ELS, but studies on functional changes in neural circuits remain unclear.\n\nAim: Present study aimed to examined the effect of ELS on excitation–inhibition and serotonergic neurotransmission system using neuroPET.\n\nMethod: To compare the effect of stress intensity, animal models were divided into single trauma (MS) and double trauma groups (MRS). MS was derived from maternal separation (PND 2 to PND 13), whereas MRS was derived from maternal separation and restraint stress (PND 20 to PND 26). Then, to evaluate alterations in the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic system, [18F]FPEB, [18F]flumazenil, and [18F]Mefway brain PET were acquired. The regional radioactivities were acquired from volume of interests.\n\nResults: The stress exposure groups (MS and MRS) showed lower brain uptake for GABAergic (7–38%), glutamatergic (7–30%), and serotonergic systems (7–35%) compared with the control group. In the sex comparison, the female MRS group showed 27–43% lower the binding profile of the glutamatergic and serotonergic systems compared to the control group. However, male MRS group represented only 11–22% lower binding profile compared to the control group.\n\nConclusions: Developmental stress induces dysfunction of neurotransmission in vivo, and females are more vulnerable to stress than males.\n\nFigure\n\nPotential role of RNF213 variant as autophagic flux dysregulator presenting endothelial impairment in Moyamoya disease\n\nHee Sun Shin1, Geun Hwa Park1, Da Sol Kim1, So Young Park2, Min Kim2 and Ji Man Hong3\n\n1Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University Graduate School of Medicine, Korea\n\n2Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine\n\n32Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a major cause of young stroke patients and is characterized by a gradual occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus as the dysfunctional endothelium becomes microscopically thickened. Most MMD patients have sporadic causes, but some patients in East Asia have genetic predispositions identified as a variant [R4810K (c.14429G > A)] of Ring finger protein 213 (RNF213). Although the biological function of RNF213 (a susceptibility gene of MMD) is unclear, progressive intimal thickening of the intracranial arteries may reflect imbalances in autophagic clearance like a plausible mechanism of various degenerative CNS (central nervous system) diseases.\n\nAim: In MMD patients-derived cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with RNF213 variant, we investigate whether RNF213 variant is associated with endothelial dysfunction due to autophagic impairment by ischemic insults.\n\nMethod: Autophagic markers were evaluated in MMD patients with wildtype or R4810K variants. To mimic the intracranial environment of clinical MMD patients, HUVECs were transfected with RNF213 variant (HUVECs-R4810K) and exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) as in vitro ischemia. We evaluated autophagy protein expression, endothelial damage, and ultrastructure inside cells. Autophagic modulators (Rapamycin and Cilostazol), known to restore damaged cells under OGD, have been used in gene transfected cells.\n\nResults: RNF213 variant group [vs. wildtype HUVECs (n = 3, respectively)] had increased protein expression of p62 (p = 0.0010) and LC3-II (p = 0.0316) under OGD. RNF213 variant group was also significantly impaired in the endothelial cell function (p = 0.0252) under OGD. Interestingly, autophagic vesicles per cell were remarkably increased in HUVECs-R4810K (n = 15) after OGD exposure (p = 0.0005). After administration of autophagic modulator (Rapamycin or Cilostazol), the function of HUVECs-R4810K and autophagic flux (n = 3) were significantly restored by increasing tube formation (p < 0.0001, respectively).\n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that autophagy may be a key mechanism of progressive endothelial dysfunction leading to MMD.\n\nL-theanine, an AMPA receptor inhibitor, ameliorates traumatic brain injury-induced hippocampal neuronal death in rats\n\nMin Kyu Park1, Bo Young Choi2, Song Hee Lee1, Beom Seok Kang1, Min Sohn3 and Sang Won Suh4\n\n1Hallym University, College of Medicine\n\n2Department of Physical Education, Hallym University\n\n3Inha University, Department of Nursing\n\n4Department of Physiology, Hallym University College of Medicine\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most prevalent brain diseases and is caused by physical force trauma followed by accident or violent strike to the head. The primary cause of TBI is brain edema, swelling and intracranial hemorrhage that contribute to the emergence of secondary injuries such as excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Both primary and secondary damage from TBI lead to cognitive impairment, social and behavioral disorders, permanent disability and even death. Excitatory neurotransmitter receptors typically have a glutamate binding site, which moves extracellular calcium into the intracellular space through these receptors in neurons under certain conditions.\n\nAim: Neuro-pathological disorders such as ischemia, seizure or hypoglycemia lead to excessive calcium and zinc influx by hyper-activation of glutamate receptors including NMDA, AMPA and KA subtypes. In particular, the AMPA receptor subtype causes excessive calcium and zinc influx, leading to neuronal injury and cognitive impairment. L-theanine is known as an AMPA receptor inhibitor by functioning as an competitive antagonist and enhances glutathione formation, which has strong anti-oxidative effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that L-theanine could decrease TBI-induced hippocampal neuronal damage by reducing excessive translocation of calcium and zinc into the cells.\n\nMethod: To confirm our hypothesis, we immediately injected L-theanine (200mg/kg) to TBI-experienced rats and sacrificed them at 24 hours later. We evaluated L-theanine effects with several histological analysis such as Fluoro-Jade B (FJB), 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining.\n\nResults: In the present study, we found that L-theanine treatment inhibited neuronal death and cognitive impairment by inhibiting the activation of AMPA receptor and increasing the production of glutathione.\n\nConclusions: Therefore, our findings propose that the suppression of AMPA receptor may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuronal death after TBI.\n\nImpact of aging on systemic and cerebral vascular systems during head-up tilt test\n\nDa Young Kim1, So Young Park2, Catherine Park1, Hyelim Lee1 and Ji Man Hong3\n\n1Ajou university, Leading Convergence of Healthcare and Medicine, Institute of Science & Technology (ALCHeMIST), Suwon, Korea\n\n2Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine\n\n32Department of Neurology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Various dizzy conditions related to systemic and cerebral vascular responses are common in the old population. To evaluate the effects of disease and aging, it is pivotal how systemic and cerebral vascular parameters are affected by aging. The head-up tilt (HUT) test is useful for non-invasive diagnosis of dizziness and fainting.\n\nAim: We are to compare systemic and cerebral vascular responses during HUT according to various age groups in normal healthy subjects.\n\nMethod: With HUT setup at a referral stroke center from August 2015 to February 2022, we enrolled consecutive subjects (n = 2,342) who were interpreted as ‘normal (n = 1,104)’ by neurologists. We examined sequential changes of the hemodynamic variables [cerebral blood flow (CBF) of middle cerebral artery, blood pressures (BPs), pulse pressure (PP), and heart rate (HR) and analysed sequential changes (baseline, 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes) of those variables during HUT. Participants were stratified into 3 age groups: young group (10–45 years; n = 297), intermediate group (46–59 years; n = 344), old group (≥60 years; n = 436).\n\nResults: Within 1 minute (early phase), young group (vs. old group; n = 297) had more increase of systemic hemodynamic responses (BPs and HR; F = 26.9, p < 0.001, F = 27.1, p < 0.001 and F = 20.1, p < 0.001) and had more decrease of CBF (F = 40.0, p < 0.001). Old group (vs. young group; n = 436) had PP widening suggesting inelastic systemic vascular structure in all time points (F = 228.3, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: The present study suggests that an insensitive response of systemic and cerebral hemodynamics (BPs, HR, CBF) in early phase with aging during HUT in healthy subjects.\n\nMetabolic connectivity changes following theta burst stimulation (TBS): a PET-FDG pilot study in healthy non human primates (NHPs)\n\nLucero Aceves-Serrano1, Yilong Ma2 and Doudet Doris1\n\n1Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, University of British Columbia\n\n2Center for Neurosciences, Institute of Molecular Medicine, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: TBS delivery has been shown to modulate functional connectivity, however there are limited studies on its effects on metabolism. Metabolic connectivity can be assessed using scale sub-profile model (SSM), a spatial covariance method based on principal component analysis (PCA), which decomposes sources of variation from PET-FDG images into a set of linearly uncorrelated vectors called Principal Components (PCs).\n\nAim: To evaluate changes in metabolic connectivity following a clinical course of TBS in the healthy brain, to prevent disease cofounds.\n\nMethods: Eleven NHPs received sham stimulation, intermittent (iTBS) or continuous TBS (cTBS) for 3–4 weeks over the left motor cortex, while awake. FDG uptake was quantified from the awake animal [1] before and one day after chronic stimulation. Images were analyzed using SSM-PCA, carried in the pre- and post-intervention images. PCs were classified as stilumation-specific if 1) they accounted for at least 5% of the total subject-by-region variability and 2) paired t-test of subject’s socres resulted in a p < 0.05. If more than one PC displayed these characteristics, they were entered into a logic regression model to create a stimulation pattern\n\nResults: SSM-PCA analysis of sham and cTBS evaluation yielded no PCs expressed differently after stimulation. The paired t-test for iTBS revealed two PCs whose expression (subject scores) significantly differed between baseline and post-stimulation assessments. The linear combination of these PC is shown in Figure 1.\n\nConclusion: In this pilot study, we identified a network or regions whose metabolic activity changed after chronic iTBS delivery. Evaluation of metabolic connectiivty is relevant in the study of rTMS clinical applicability as metabolic connectivity changes have been identified in different patient populations such as Parkinson’s. While validation of this pattern is still necessary, findings are in agreement with previous reports of network modulation after rTMS.\n\n1. Ma et al.

The SUR2 and Kir6.1 subunits of vascular KATP channels are expressed in cerebral pericytes, a mural cell surrounding cerebral capillaries. Pericytes have been implicated in neurovascular coupling (NVC), but the role of pericyte KATP channels has not been fully characterized.\n\nAim: The aim of this experiment was to demonstrate a clear controlling role for KATP channels in NVC.\n\nMethods: We used in vivo wide-field optical imaging to simultaneously examine changes in neural and vascular activity during whisker stimulation in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP. Mice were administered pinacidil (KATP activator) and glibenclamide (KATP inhibitor), and neural and vascular activity was recorded before and after administration. A pericyte-specific dominant negative KATP transgene, which abolishes conductance when incorporated into the KATP channel, was expressed in mice to examine the role of KATP particularly within pericytes.\n\nResults: The average change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration and GCaMP fluorescence in response to whisker stimulation was significantly reduced in GCaMP mice after glibenclamide administration (n = 14, p = 0.0002; n = 14, p = 0.0027 respectively), as well as after pinacidil administration (n = 12, p = 7 × 10−5; n = 12, p = 9 × 10−5 respectively). SUR2 knockout (KO) animals showed a decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in response to stimulation compared to controls as well (n = 12, p = 0.0015), with pinacidil having a significantly lessened effect in SUR2 KO mice than in GCaMP mice (n = 6, p = 8 × 10−5). Additionally, induction of dominant negative KATP channels in mice caused a significant shortening in the decay of oxygenated hemoglobin concentration following stimulation (n = 10, p = 0.003).\n\nConclusions: Together, these data indicate that activation and inactivation of KATP channels disrupts neurovascular coupling. This study also reveals a regulatory role for both pericyte and non-pericyte KATP in neurovascular coupling.\n\nTamoxifen improves the long term functional and neuropathological deficits after hippocampal silent infarct in male rats\n\nNicole Jones1, Margaret Morris2, Fred Westbrrook3, Artur Shvetcov4 and Caitlin Finney5\n\n1ICBFM\n\n2School of Biomedical Sciences - UNSW Sydney\n\n3School of Psychology - UNSW Sydney\n\n4Black Dog Institute/School of Psychiatry - UNSW Sydney\n\n5Westmead Institute for Medical Research/School of Medical Sciences - The University of Sydney\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Silent infarcts (SI) are a cerebral small vessel disease characterized by small subcortical infarcts without associated ischemia symptoms. SI have been linked to long-term cognitive decline and dementia. There are no approved treatments for SI. One potential treatment strategy is the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, tamoxifen. Previous results from our lab demonstrated short-term neuroprotective benefits of tamoxifen against SI.\n\nAim: We wanted to identify whether the benefits of tamoxifen persist in the long-term using a rodent model of hippocampal SI.\n\nMethod: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated to treatment groups (n = 7–10 per group). A unilateral injection into dorsal hippocampal CA1 of either saline (Sham group) or endothelin-1 (15pmol; SI group) was performed. Tamoxifen (5mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (1:4 ethanol:corn oil) treatment occurred immediately after surgery, and a 2nd injection was performed 24 h later. Cognition was examined using the hippocampal-dependent place recognition task performed pre-, 2-, 10- and 21-days post-surgery. At day 21, brains were collected to analyse cell loss, apoptosis, gliosis, and ER immunohistochemistry.\n\nResults: Tamoxifen protected against cognitive dysfunction across 21 days (p < 0.001). It also protected against SI-induced cell (p < 0.001) and ERα and ERβ loss (p < 0.001), as well as against increased caspase-3 (p < 0.001), astrocytes (p < 0.001), microglia (p < 0.01), and glial scarring (p < 0.01). Further confirming these neuroprotective effects, a principal component analysis showed that SI-tamoxifen rats were identical to Sham control groups across measures. Using machine learning, we also found that caspase-3 and ERα were predictive of progression from an early SI-triggered ischemic state to the late-stage dementia-like state, suggesting that both are good targets for SI therapies.\n\nConclusions: Tamoxifen was neuroprotective against the long-term pathophysiological effects of SI, including apoptosis, gliosis, inflammation, ER loss, leading to improved cognitive outcomes after hippocampal SI.\n\nThe Impact of Multiple Sclerosis on Motor Speech-Related Functional Activation\n\nKatherine Kenyon1, Frederique Boonstra1, Gustavo Noffs1, Angela Morgan2, Scott Kolbe3, Adam Vogel4 and Anneke van der Walt1\n\n1Monash University\n\n2Murdoch Children's Research Institute\n\n3RMIT\n\n4The University of Melbourne\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Up to half of all people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) develop dysarthria, a motor speech disorder. Due to resulting difficulties in communication, dysarthria is associated with decreased quality of life in pwMS. It is also correlated with disease severity in pwMS, with more severe dysarthria seen in people with the secondary progressive form of the disease. Dysarthria in MS is still not well understood, especially in terms of changes in brain activity.\n\nAim: This study aimed to define the functional pathophysiology of speech in pwMS using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesised that pwMS would show increased functional activation during speech as compensation for neuronal injury.\n\nMethod: Sixty-two pwMS and 14 healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. All participants completed two runs of a six-minute word repetition task during a 3T MRI with echo gradient echo planar fMRI. This is the first time this speech task has been used with pwMS. FSL Feat was used to complete a multi-level general linear model analysis of the data.\n\nResults: Findings show an increase in functional activation during speech in pwMS compared to healthy controls. This is observed specifically in the left frontopolar cortex (z = 3.94, p < .05). Additionally, we found higher widespread neural activation during the speech preparation aspect of the task in HC compared to MS participants.\n\nConclusions: PwMS require higher levels of neural activation than HC to complete the same word repetition task, specifically requiring higher activation of the frontopolar cortex. This area is involved in goal-oriented behaviour including attention control, working memory, decision making and word generation. This could be explained as compensation due to the lower overall neural activation in pwMS during speech preparation.\n\nDifferential Effect of Global Signal Regression Between Awake and Anesthetized Conditions in Mice\n\nDa Wang1, Hui Li2, Mengyang Xu3, Binshi Bo4, Mengchao Pei4, Qikai Qin1, Zhifeng Liang4 and Garth Thompson1\n\n1iHuman Institute, ShanghaiTech University\n\n2iHuman institute, ShanghaiTech University\n\n3iHuman institute, Shanghaitech University\n\n4CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Sciences and Intelligence Technology, Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: In resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies, global signal regression (GSR) is a controversial preprocessing strategy. It effectively eliminates global noise driven by motion and respiration but also can introduce artifacts and remove functionally relevant metabolic information. Most preclinical rs-fMRI studies are performed in anesthetized animals, and anesthesia will alter both metabolic and neuronal activity.\n\nAim: We explored the effect of GSR on rs-fMRI data collected in dexmedetomidine anesthetized (Dex) and awake states in mice. We measured functional connectivity (FC), functional connectivity density (FCD) maps, and brain modularity methods to quantify altered connectivity.\n\nMethods: Fifteen male adult C57BL/6 mice, 7 to 9 weeks old, were imaged awake and under anesthesia (Bruker BioSpec 9.4T scanner, T2RARE, BOLD-EPI). Preprocessing included motion correction, slice timing, registration, filtering. For standard FC, correlation coefficients were calculated between time courses of regions of interest. Functional connectivity density (FCD) for each voxel was the number of voxels whose correlation with adjacent voxels is greater than or equal to 0.25. Brain modularity was calculated using the modularity_und tool from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net/).\n\nResults:\n\nFC and modularity alteration due to GSR\n\nGSR decreased FC (Fig. 1a) and increased brain modularity (Fig. 1b) in both awake and Dex mice (N = 12). The change in modularity score and FC was greater in Dex mice compared with awake mice.\n\nFCD alteration due to GSR\n\nThe decrease of FCD with GSR in visceral areas in awake mice was significantly lower than Dex mice (p = 0.0061, T = –3.3843), while in hypothalamus it was higher than Dex mice (p = 0.027, T = 2.511). (Fig. 1c)\n\nConclusions: (1) The anesthetic condition was more sensitive to GSR. (2) GSR had opposite effects on different brain regions for awake versus anesthetized mice.\n\nFigure\n\nA novel paramagnetic probe for in-vivo MRI imaging of cannabinoid-1 receptor in the mouse brain\n\nQi Ouyang1, Garth Thompson2, Mengyang Xu3 and Fei Zhao1\n\n1ShanghaiTech University\n\n2iHuman Institute, ShanghaiTech University\n\n3iHuman institute, Shanghaitech University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Cannabinoid type I receptor (CB1R) is one of the most highly expressed G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the central nervous system, mainly expressed in brain tissue. CB1R is involved in a wide range of biological functions, thus much can be learned about the role of the receptor by determining its localization. Although techniques for mapping CB1 receptor in the nervous system have seen substantial advances in recent years, current methods either lack spatial resolution (particularly for small brain regions in mouse models), or are only available in vitro. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can offer minimal invasiveness, ability to monitor large fields of view, and relatively high spatial resolution.\n\nAim: We aim to develop an in vivo paramagnetic probe suitable for the imaging of cannabinoid system. The specificity of the drug Rimonabant binding to CB1R and the contrast generated by gadolinium chelate (Gd-DOTA) in MRI were used to investigate the distribution of CB1R in real time in vivo.\n\nMethod & Results: By chemically conjugating Rimonabant to the gadolinium chelate, we created a novel paramagnetic probe (Fig.a). In in vitro experiments, we tested the biobinding activity and relaxivity of the probe (Fig.b). Introduction of the probe into mouse brains furthermore permits MRI-based measurement, including Cisterna magna injection and lateral ventricle injection (Fig.c). We measured the T1 relaxation change in vivo in mice after infusion of the probe. The colored voxels represent areas where the contrast agent is distributed (Fig.d). We also performed fMRI experiments (Fig.e).\n\nConclusions: Our current data are not sufficient to prove that the probe binds specifically in vivo to CB1, thus in vivo testing is still ongoing. We still need to collect data regarding probe infusion, and then compare it with Gd-DOTA to acquire the distribution of the CB1R in mice brain.\n\nEzh2 knockdown reversed the post-ischemic promotion of neurogenesis in gerbil dentate gyrus\n\nYoshihide Sehara1, Ryota Watano1, Kenji Ohba1, Kuniko Shimazaki2, Kensuke Kawai2 and Hiroaki Mizukami1\n\n1Division of Genetic Therapeutics, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University\n\n2Department of Neurosurgery, Jichi Medical University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Neurogenesis persists during the whole life in the two distinct regions in the brain, including the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle and the dentate gyrus of hippocampus. Further, this neurogenesis increases after brain insults such as ischemia, epilepsy, and trauma. However, the mechanisms of neurogenesis have not been elucidated.\n\nAim: This study focuses on the relationship between polycomb group complex (PcG) and neurogenesis after transient ischemia, which is established to regulate gene silencing through histone methylation.\n\nMethod: We made adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying small interfring RNA (siRNA) targeting Ezh2, which is a core component of PcG. For the control group, nontargeting (NT) siRNA was also prepared. Four-week-old male gerbils were injected with 3.4 × 1010 viral genomes of AAV vector into the right hippocampus. At the age of 6 weeks, the animals were operated with 5-min-occlusion of bilateral carotid arteries. At the age of 7 weeks, the animals were injected with 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU, 50 mg/kg body weight, twice) intraperitoneally to label newborn cells. At the age of 9 weeks, the animals were decapitated for the histological analysis.\n\nResults: In the dentate gyrus, the number of EdU-positive cells in the NT siRNA + ischemia group was significantly increased compared to the control (p < 0.001; N = 5, each group). Furthermore, Ezh2 siRNA + ischemia group showed significantly smaller number of EdU-positive cells, compared to NT siRNA + ischemia group (p < 0.05) (Control: 20.4 ± 3.1; NT siRNA + sham: 14.8 ± 1.4; Ezh2 + sham siRNA: 17.0 ± 2.2; NT siRNA + ischemia: 64.2 ± 6.1; Ezh2 siRNA + ischemia: 32.8 ± 5.8).\n\nConclusions: Ezh2 reversed the post-ischemic promotion of neurogenesis in the gerbil dentate gyrus.\n\nBlood-brain barrier dysfunction in abnormal brain tissue two weeks after subarachnoid hemorrhage is a predictor for the development of late epilepsy\n\nJens Dreier1, Svetlana Lublinski2, Viktor Horst1, Sebastian Major1, Coline Lemale1, Vasilis Kola1, Jed Hartings3, Joannes Woitzik4 and Alon Friedman5\n\n1Charité University Medicine Berlin\n\n2Ben-Gurion University of the Negev\n\n3University of Cincinnati\n\n4University of Oldenburg\n\n5Dalhousie University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is characterized by long-term sequelae such as epilepsy.\n\nAim: We investigated predictors of late epilepsy based on prospectively collected data from the DISCHARGE-1 trial.\n\nMethod: Consecutive patients requiring neurosurgical intervention were enrolled from 09/2009 to 04/2018 at six university hospitals. Subdural electrodes were implanted to record spreading depolarizations and electrographic seizures for 2 weeks. Pre-interventional CT was performed on Day ∼0, post-interventional neuroimage on Day ∼2, post-neuromonitoring neuroimage on Day ∼14 and follow-up MRI at 7 months. Parenchymal damage and extraluminal blood volumes were determined via manual neuroimage segmentation. In addition, volumes of (1) normal brain tissue (NBT), (2) abnormal brain tissue (ABT) (cytotoxic/vasogenic edema, gliosis or hemorrhage), (3) subarachnoid space, (4) lateral ventricles, (5) tissue with blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBBD), (6) BBBD in NBT and (7) BBBD in ABT in % of total volume were semi-automatically segmented in longitudinal MRIs. Patients were interviewed by a trained neurologist 3.2 [interquartile range: 0.9 - 5.0] years after the initial hemorrhage to determine whether late onset epilepsy had developed.\n\nResults: The strongest predictor of late epilepsy at ∼3 years among all variables available at the end of the neuromonitoring period at 2 weeks after the initial hemorrhage was the semi-automatically determined tissue volume with BBBD in ABT as % of total volume. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of BBBD in ABT was 0.77 (0.66–0.88, P < 0.0001) for late epilepsy (n = 82).\n\nConclusions: Experimental evidence suggests that BBBD has a key role in epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration via TGF-beta receptor-activated signaling in astrocytes that mediate neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability. Our clinical study provides a nuanced picture, suggesting that epileptogenesis is related to ABT with BBBD rather than NBT with BBBD. In experimental models, such tissue is located in a typical zone around the core of ischemic or traumatic lesions.\n\nIdentifying the mechanisms of intact and impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation\n\nNatali van Zijl1, Abhirup Banerjee1 and Stephen Payne2\n\n1University of Oxford\n\n2National Taiwan University; University of Oxford\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is the mechanism that acts to control cerebral blood flow (CBF) approximately constant in response to short-term changes in arterial blood pressure (ABP). dCA is known to become impaired in various cerebrovascular diseases.\n\nAim: How individual mechanisms of dCA are affected in impaired dCA is not known. This study therefore aimed to identify if and how two of these mechanisms, termed the metabolic and myogenic responses, are affected in impaired dCA.\n\nMethod: A dynamic mathematical model of dCA was developed as an extension of an existing static CA model (Payne, 2018), where the myogenic and metabolic mechanisms were each represented by a gain and time constant. These parameters were optimised using experimentally derived pressure-flow impulse responses under conditions of normocapnia and thigh cuff to simulate intact dCA, and hypercapnia to simulate impaired dCA. The impulse responses were derived by performing transfer function analysis on ABP (Finometer) and CBF velocity (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound in both middle cerebral arteries) recordings from 300 recordings (Nikolic et al., 2015).\n\nResults: Three parameters were estimated robustly from the model: ratio of myogenic gain over time constant ( SM/τM ), metabolic gain ( SV ), and metabolic time constant ( τV ), shown in the table. Findings show that SM/τM is significantly smaller in hypercapnia (representing impaired dCA) compared to normocapnia and thigh cuff (representing intact dCA); SV is not significantly affected by condition; τV is significantly larger in hypercapnia compared to normocapnia and thigh cuff. This indicates a slower metabolic response in impaired dCA.\n\nConclusions: Both the myogenic and metabolic responses are affected in impaired dCA. Future work will examine the response in other conditions to quantify the changes.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThe authors thank David Simpson and Tony Birch for the use of their data in this project.

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA\n\n3Boston university\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Widefield microscopy of mouse cerebral cortex enables mesoscale imaging of spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity. An array of fluorescent reporters is used to visualize distinct aspects of brain function. Reporters with different colors enable spectral multiplexing. A change in neuronal activity induces changes in blood volume and -oxygenation. The resulting dynamic changes in light absorption by oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin (HbO and Hb, respectively) can interfere with fluorescence signal detection. Quantification of Hb/HbO concentrations is a central technique in neurovascular imaging and enables correction of hemodynamic artifacts in fluorescence recordings.\n\nAim: Build an instrument for concurrent imaging of red and green fluorophores as well as changes in Hb and HbO concentrations across mouse cortex.\n\nMethod: Two-color fluorescence imaging is performed in epi-illumination mode. For reflectance imaging of Hb/HbO absorption, 525- and 625-nm LEDs are placed on a custom-made illumination ring around the objective. An opaque cone between objective and cranial window prevents the animal from perceiving the strobing illumination light. A single sCMOS camera is used to detect fluorescence and reflectance signals. The instrument is controlled through MATLAB-generated trigger signals. We strobe four LED channels to acquire two fluorescence and two reflectance time series at an effective rate of 10 Hz.\n\nResults: We illustrate instrument performance by conducting cortex-wide imaging of spontaneous and evoked neuronal and hemodynamic activity in mice expressing the red calcium indicator jRGECO1a and the green acetylcholine indicator GRABACh3.0. We show signal changes in response to tactile whisker and visual stimulation. In parallel, we built a system for concurrent widefield fluorescence imaging and BOLD fMRI in awake mice to compare results from optical Hb/HbO measurements with BOLD fMRI-based measurements of hemoglobin oxygenation.\n\nConclusions: We developed a versatile system for widefield imaging of two fluorescent reporters and changes in hemoglobin oxygenation with a single camera.\n\nFigure\n\nLongitudinal intravital imaging of photothrombotic cerebral microinfarction reveals a dynamic cellular-level reaction to glial scar\n\nJieun Choi and Pilhan Kim\n\nKAIST\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Cerebral microinfarcts, small ischemic lesions, can be caused by cerebral small vessel disease, microemboli, and hypoperfusion. Prevalent microinfarcts contribute to the disruption of structural brain connection, which can progress to a cognitive impairment and dementia. However, how microscopic cerebrovascular disruption affects the brain tissue in cellular-level are mostly unknown.\n\nAim: We aim to analyze complex cellular behaviors in a live animal models over long period of time after the onset of cerebral microinfarction with high-resolution longitudinal intravital imaging of astrocyte, pericyte, endothelial cells, and neuron as well as microvascular integrity.\n\nMethod: Chronic cranial imaging window implantation was performed for intravital imaging of cerebral microinfarction in vivo. A photothrombotic cerebral microinfarction was induced by 561nm laser illumination after intravenous injection of Rose Bengal. Video-rate laser-scanning confocal and two-photon microscope system was used for long-term repetitive intravital imaging for 1 month after microinfarct induction.\n\nResults: The intravital imaging revealed an acute tissue expansion, localized micro-edema, at day 2 followed by gradual tissue shrinkage for 1 month, resulting a collagen-rich scar formation surrounding the microinfarct. An acute astrocyte loss and neuronal death observed after the microinfarct induction was persisted until 1 month whereas acute impairment of pericyte-vessel coverage, microvascular disruption and vascular leakage were partially recovered at day 5. GFAP+ reactive astrocytes started to be observed at the peri-infarct area from 2 days and appeared to be accumulated until 1 month with fibrous collagen-rich glial scar formation and accumulation of GFAP+LCN2+ reactive astrocytes in the peri-infarct.\n\nConclusions: Dynamic cellular-level changes after microinfarction were analysed by long-term intravital imaging. It revealed a fibrous collagen-rich scar formation in the microinfarct with accumulation of GFAP+ reactive astrocytes at the peri-infarct. Susceptibility of astrocytes to ischemic brain injury and their reactive response leads to a glial scar formation in cerebral cortex after cerebral ischemic microinfarction.\n\nElovanoids, novel lipid mediators, is neuroprotective in experimental traumatic brain injury\n\nLudmila Belayev1, Pranab K Mukherjee1, Andre Obenaus2, Larissa Khoutorova1 and Nicolas G Bazan1\n\n1LSUHSC\n\n2UCI\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Recently, we discovered and characterized a novel class of homeostatic lipid mediators, termed elovanoids (ELV), which are derivatives from very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs, n-3). ELV displays neuroprotective bioactivities both in vitro and in vivo experimental ischemic stroke. We also found that intravenous administration of ELV is neuroprotective in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nAim: We evaluated whether treatment with ELVs, made of 32 and 34 C atoms in length (ELV-N32 and ELV-N34), would an equally effective as intravenous ELV in a rat model of TBI.\n\nMethods: Male SD rats were subjected to moderate right parieto-occipital parasagittal fluid-percussion injury. ElovMix (32:2, 34:6, and acetyl form of ELVs) and saline were administered intranasally at 1 h and 24 h after TBI (n = 6–7/group). Behavior was evaluated on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 after TBI. Ex vivo MRI was conducted on day 14 for lesion volumes, edema (T2WI), and white matter connectivity (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI). In addition, two separate groups of rats were subjected to the same TBI model, treatments, behavioral evaluation and sacrificed on day 3, and LC-MS/MS was used to detect the ELVs in the different areas of the brain.\n\nResults: Body weight was increased by ELV treatment by 14% on day 14. ELV improved behavior by 37, 45, 41, 41% on days 2, 3, 7, and 14 (P < .005). T2WI abnormalities, including cortical thinning and enlarged ventricles, were smaller in ELV-treated rats. DTI metrics were extracted from 80 brain regions, including the hippocampus. ELVs were detected in the ipsilateral cortex of ELVs treated rats on day 3.\n\nConclusion: We have shown that the intranasal administration of ELVs provides high-grade neuroprotection and can be selectively delivered to the brain. Our study opens avenues of exploration of ELVs as a possible therapeutic approach for TBI.\n\nIn vivo Brain Pericytes Calcium Signaling during Vasomotion and Neurovascular coupling in Murine models\n\nJessica Meza Resillas1, Finnegan O'Hara2, Michael Stobart1, Noushin Ahmadpour1, John Del Rosario1, Megan Rodriguez1 and Jillian Stobart1\n\n1University of Manitoba\n\n2University of Waterloo\n\nAbstract\n\nPericytes are spatially isolated mural cells embedded on brain blood vessels. They participate in endogenous pathways like vasomotion and neurovascular coupling (NVC) that direct cerebral blood flow (CBF) to highly activated areas of the brain. They have been shown to have a contractile capacity; however, recent studies have identified different types of pericytes that differ in morphology and protein expression, creating a debate on their functional roles in CBF control.\n\nThe aim of this study is to clarify the influence of different pericyte types on vasomotion and NVC by studying specific calcium channels that may generate intracellular calcium events and contractility.\n\nUtilizing in vivo two-photon microscopy, we evaluated the calcium signaling of distinct pericyte populations: ensheathing (EP) and capillary (CP) pericytes in transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators (RCaMP1.07 and GCaMP6s), while simultaneously measuring the hemodynamic properties of nearby blood vessels. The effects of calcium channel blockers, nimodipine and Pyr3, on pericyte calcium signals and vessel hemodynamics were determined.\n\nWe found differential effects of specific calcium pathways in brain pericytes on the local hemodynamic behavior. Both nimodipine and Pyr3 decreased calcium activity in both pericyte types and this decrease varied throughout their morphological structures. Nimodipine dilated vessels covered by EP, decreasing the CBF velocity and diminishing their response to NVC. However, nimodipine reduced capillary CBF velocity, flux, and the response of CP to NVC. Interestingly, Pyr3 caused a vasodilatory effect in both EP and CP and decreased the response to NVC of EP. #animals = 7 per mouse line.\n\nOur data provides novel insight into brain pericyte calcium signaling mechanisms and opens new avenues for clarify the role of pericytes in CBF regulation. This may also contribute to the understanding of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in which their pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated.\n\nReduction in serotonin 1B receptor binding in the dorsal brain stem is related to response to SSRI for depression\n\nMartin Gärde1, Granville Matheson2, Katarina Varnäs1, Johan Lundberg1 and Mikael Tiger1\n\n1Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n2Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, USA\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1B) has been proposed as a potential target for new antidepressant drugs. Reduced 5-HT1BR expression has been observed after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration in rats, non-human primates, and healthy volunteers.\n\nAim: The study aimed to: (1) Quantify 5-HT1BR-change in relevant brain regions after SSRI treatment for MDD. (2) Examine associations between 5-HT1BR binding and treatment response.\n\nMethod: Eight unmedicated patients diagnosed with moderate to severe MDD underwent PET with [11C]AZ10419369 before and after 3 weeks of treatment with the SSRI escitalopram 10mg. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), with the cerebellum as reference region, was used to estimate 5-HT1BR BPND. Depression severity was assessed at time of PET and at 7-week post-treatment start using the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Linear mixed effects modelling was applied on longitudinal 5-HT1BR changes while Pearson’s regression was used to test correlation with MADRS change.\n\nResults: Treatment responders showed a 24% decrease in dorsal brain stem (DBS) BPND (n = 6, p = .024), however, this effect was non-significant when including non-responders (n = 8, p = .138). No statistically significant change was found for other examined brain regions including the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. We observed a significant correlation between MADRS reduction and reduced DBS 5-HT1BR BPND after Escitalopram treatment (r = 0.92, p = .001).\n\nConclusions: The strong correlation between reduction in depressive symptoms and 5-HT1BR BPND change in the dorsal brain stem may indicate involvement of 5-HT1B receptor downregulation in the antidepressant effect of SSRIs. The reduction in 5-HT1BR BPND among treatment responders should be interpreted with caution given the exploratory nature of this analysis. However, this finding corresponds with earlier observations of reduced brain stem raphe nuclei 5-HT1BR expression in rats after SSRI administration.\n\nFigure:\n\nHuman amnion epithelial cells reduce infarct growth following tissue plasminogen activator therapy in ischemic stroke\n\nLiz Judith Barreto Arce1, Hyun Ah Kim2, Shenpeng R. Zhang1, Siow Teng Chan3, Grant R. Drummond1 and Christopher G. Sobey1\n\n1Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Disease Research, Department of Microbiology, Anatomy, Physiology & Pharmacology, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\n\n2Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Disease Research, Department of Microbiology, Anatomy, Physiology & Pharmacology, School of Agriculture, Biomedicine & Environment, La Trobe University\n\n3The Ritchie Centre, Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, VIC, Australia\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The only drug treatment available for ischemic stroke is the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA); however, it has a narrow therapeutic window and there is a increased risk of cerebral haemorrhage after 4.5 h of stroke onset. We have previously demonstrated that intravenous administration of human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) in mice reduces infarct growth at 24–72 h following stroke, but there is unknown whether the therapeutic effect of tPA could be enhanced with the administration of hAECs.\n\nAim: To assess the neuroprotective efficacy of hAECs in the presence of tPA.\n\nMethods: Male C57BL/6 mice (aged 8–12 weeks) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h followed by reperfusion. Immediately following reperfusion, vehicle (saline, n = 18) or tPA (Alteplase, 10 mg/kg; n = 75) was administered intravenously. After a further 30 min of reperfusion, tPA-treated mice were injected intravenously with either hAECs (1 × 106; n = 32) or vehicle (2% human serum albumin; n = 43). Mice were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups and euthanised at 3, 6 or 24 h (n = 21, 34, and 38, respectively), and brains were collected to assess infarct volume, and inflammatory markers.\n\nResults: While there was no mortality within 6 h of stroke, high mortality at >6 h in tPA-treated mice was found compared to tPA plus hAECs (60% vs 27%). This outcome prevented an unbiased comparison of infarct volume of survivors at 24 h. However, at 6 h, infarcts in the subcortical region (corresponding to the expanding infarct core) were ∼50% larger in tPA vs vehicle-treated mice (22.1 ± 2.9 mm3 vs 14.7 ± 2.3 mm3) but were ∼40% smaller in mice receiving hAECs (13.0 ± 2.2 mm3, p = 0.03 vs tPA alone). No difference was found in inflammatory cells between the groups.\n\nConclusion: Administration of hAECs, after tPA treatment, limited infarct growth and mortality following stroke.\n\nThe Role of Neuroinflammation in Delayed Neurodegeneration following Ischaemic Stroke\n\nShannon Stuckey1, Lyndsey Collins-Praino2, Isabella Bilecki1, Madeleine Homes-Vickers1, Amy Poyzer1, Rebecca Hood3, Lin Ong4 and Renee Turner5\n\n1Translational Neuropathology Laboratory (TNL), The University of Adelaide, Department of Anatomy and Pathology, Faculty of Health & Medical Sciences, Adelaide Medical School, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia\n\n2Cognition Ageing and Neurodegenerative Disease Laboratory (CANDL), The University of Adelaide, Department of Anatomy and Pathology, Faculty of Health & Medical Sciences, Adelaide Medical School, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia\n\n3Translational Neuropathology Laboratory (TNL), Discipline of Anatomy and Pathology, School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health & Medical Sciences, The University of Adelaide, SA, Australia\n\n4School of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Southern Queensland\n\n5International Society for Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Many patients suffer long-term functional deficits following stroke. This is linked with delayed neuronal death in areas distal from, but connected to, the infarct site, termed secondary neurodegeneration (SND). The underlying mechanisms of SND are poorly understood, particularly long-term following stroke (>28 days). However, increasing evidence implicates neuroinflammation as a potential driver.\n\nAim: Investigate the spatiotemporal profile of markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and associated functional changes, long-term following stroke.\n\nMethod: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 44/gp; 12 weeks) underwent photothrombotic stroke or sham surgery. Brain tissue, serum and cerebrospinal fluid were collected at 12- or 15-months post-stroke (n = 30 stroke; n = 14 sham/gp), and markers of neuroinflammation (microglia and cytokines) and neurodegeneration (neuronal loss and degenerative proteins) are currently being assessed. Motor outcomes (step test and open field), anxiety behaviour (open field), and cognitive decline (Barnes maze and paired-associates learning task) were assessed at 12- or 15- months post-stroke, with motor outcomes also assessed at pre-stroke and 7-days post-stroke.\n\nResults: Motor deficits were observed at both timepoints (p < 0.05). Unexpectedly, animals showed significantly higher levels of anxiety and cognitive decline at 12-months compared with 15-months post-stroke (p < 0.05). Preliminary investigation showed increased levels of microglia and neuronal loss (p < 0.05) within the thalamus and amygdala at 12-months post-stroke, suggesting that the increased anxiety behaviour at this time-point may be associated with neuroinflammation. Analysis of 15-month tissue, as well as other SND regions (hippocampus and basal ganglia), is ongoing.\n\nConclusions: Persistent complications shown at 12-months post-stroke and beyond, particularly increased neuroinflammation and neuronal loss, suggest that pathological progression is still occurring >12 months post-stroke. These results highlight a need for inclusion of long-term timepoints in experimental stroke research. Given recovery on cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures at 15-months post-stroke, investigation into brain mechanisms that may account for this is the focus of our ongoing research.\n\nTime of day of endovascular treatment modulates clinical outcome after stroke\n\nVanessa Granja Burbano1, Teresa Woelfer1, Naomi Vlegels1, Fanny Quandt2, Hanna Zimmermann3, Johannes Wischmann2, Lars Kellert4, Thomas Liebig3, Konstantinos Dimitriadis4, Jeffrey Saver5 and Steffen Tiedt1\n\n1Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, University Hospital, LMU Munich\n\n2Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf\n\n3Institute of Neuroradiology, University Hospital, LMU Munich\n\n4Department of Neurology, University Hospital, LMU Munich\n\n5Department of Neurology and Comprehensive Stroke Center, David Geffen School of 15 Medicine, University of California Los Angeles\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Experimental stroke studies suggest a strong influence of the time-of-day treatment on outcome and treatment efficacy. Whether this translates to human stroke is uncertain but could influence the selection of patients for treatments.\n\nAim: To determine whether the time of day of stroke onset or of endovascular treatment (EVT) is associated with functional outcome after stroke.\n\nMethod: Here, we leveraged data from patients with large-vessel-occlusion from the German Stroke Registry to determine whether the time-of-day of endovascular treatment (i.e. flow restoration) modulates clinical outcomes and the benefit from successful recanalization.\n\nThe primary end point was the distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included the rate of functional independence at 90 days and discharge and 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores. The analyses were performed by 6-hour time-blocks (eg, morning 05:00–10:59) and by time as a continuous variable.\n\nResults: In adjusted analyses of data from 9,357 patients, morning treatment was associated with lower 90-day mRS scores compared to other times of the day (aOR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.07–1.47]; p = 0.004). This result was consistent in analyses of all secondary outcomes. Sinusoidal regression analysis mapped the time-of-day treatment with best outcomes to 07:12. The association of successful recanalization with lower mRS scores at 90 days was more pronounced in morning compared to evening-treated patients (aOR, 95% CI: 4.34 [1.67–12.50] vs. 2.00 [1.22–3.24], pinteraction = 0.049) with the benefit from successful recanalization for morning patients persisting until 24 hours after onset while being lost after 11.5 hours for evening patients.\n\nConclusions: This study supports the idea of time-of-day effect on ischemic stroke evolution with better clinical outcomes and prolonged treatment benefits for morning-treated patients.\n\nSpatially varying multi-compartment model of blood flow and oxygen transport in the human brain\n\nStephen Payne\n\nNational Taiwan University\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The brain relies on a continuous supply of oxygen and other metabolic supplies since its storage capacity is very limited. Brain tissue is thus very highly perfused. However, obtaining information about flow and metabolism is highly challenging and mathematical models play an important role in interpreting clinical data. However, these are mostly based on highly simplified compartmental models or highly detailed network models.\n\nAim: A new multiple compartment model of blood flow and oxygen transport is thus proposed obtained via a porous medium model.\n\nMethod: Three blood compartments (arterial, capillary, and venous) are assumed for simplicity. Conservation of mass in each compartment gives three governing equations in terms of volume fraction, pressure, and velocity field. Darcy flow is assumed. Displacement of the solid phase is neglected, and a linear pressure-volume relationship assumed. Continuity for oxygen transport is then applied, based on the same assumptions. These are re-written using the flow equations and conservation of volume. Values and boundary conditions are taken from previous studies. The equations are then solved in a spherically symmetric annular shell, with properties scaled between grey and white matter.\n\nResults: The radial variations in arterial and capillary blood oxygen saturation, Figure 1, show significant spatial variability with saturation values dropping towards the ventricles, although the tissue partial pressure remains high enough to ensure a sufficient metabolic rate throughout the tissue. Such variability is thus likely to be masked in imaging data.\n\nConclusions: A new multi-compartmental framework for spatially varying cerebral blood flow and oxygen concentration is presented. Future work will focus on the validation of these results against available experimental data and testing the model against medical imaging models of perfusion and oxygen extraction factor (OEF).\n\nFigure\n\nFigure 1: Arterial and capillary blood oxygen saturation against radial distance (both grey and white matter).\n\nEstimating cerebral mechanical properties non-invasively through the use of tissue pulsations in the human brain\n\nStephen Payne1, Isla Henderson2, Van Dung Nguyen2, Antoine Jerusalem2, Jenny Nicholls3, Jonathan Ince3, Jatinder Minhas3, Andrea Lecchini-Visintini4 and Emma Chung5\n\n1National Taiwan University\n\n2University of Oxford\n\n3University of Leicester\n\n4University of Southampton\n\n5King's College, London\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The mechanical properties of in vivo brain tissue remain very poorly characterized. These properties are, however, critical in understanding the brain’s behaviour. The use of ultrasound, via the Transcranial Tissue Doppler method (TCTD), has received new interest recently, as the brain tissue pulsations (BTP) measurements are well tolerated, even by patients, and are quick and cheap to acquire.\n\nAim: We aim to use these experimental measurements to estimate non-invasively the mechanical properties of brain tissue.\n\nMethod: The brain is assumed to comprise a coupled solid-fluid system. The solid phase is assumed to comprise a linear, isotropic material and the fluid to follow Darcy’s law. The resulting equations can be solved given suitable boundary conditions. BTP recordings were obtained from 20 volunteers at rest using a Brain Tissue Velocimetry (Brain TV) TCTD prototype (Nihon Kohden, Japan). Synchronous BP readings were obtained using a finger-cuff Finometer system. Velocity was integrated over time to obtain a BTP signal representing tissue displacement at 33 depths (22–86 mm). The data were converted to transfer function form to give an ensemble-averaged frequency response, Figure 1. There is significant variability between individual subjects, but a clear trend of increasing magnitude with depth.\n\nResults: Using a simple optimization method based on RMSE, we calculated the parameter values that yield the best fit to the population-averaged data. The parameter values (E = 17.6 kPa; κ/μ = 8.73 x 10−7 m3s/kg; Q = 4,570"
