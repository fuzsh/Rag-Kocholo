Lombok has been developed for tourism activity since years ago. The Lombok Province Government has identified Tourism as one of the key drives for the economic development. Hotel resort and others hospitalities buildings have been developed to all of the areas. Nowadays, the development of Sade Cultural Kampong will therefore open up new and demand oriented products (only focus on traditional woven of Sasak). Sade Kampong should be developed as a tourism destination with appreciated and developed its heritage and traditions with sustainability concepts (with the focus on social, economic, and environmental). This paper will elaborate some local potential Sade Kampong, such as architecture, culture, and landscape as a local potential for developing a new tourism destination.\n\nCorrupting Conversations with the Marquis de Sade: On Education, Gender, and Sexuality\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGreteman, Adam J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this essay, the author joins a conversation started by Martin (\"Reclaiming the conversation: the ideal of the educated woman.\" Yale University Press, New Haven, 1985) regarding gender and education seeking to extend the conversation to address sexuality.

Fermencin SD11 was purified using three steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight was found to be 33,000Â Da using SDS-PAGE and confirmed as 33,593.4Â Da by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fermencin SD11 exhibited activity against a wide range of oral pathogens including cariogenic and periodontogenic pathogens and Candida. The active activity was stable between 60 - 80Â Â°C in a pH range of 3.0 to 7.0. It was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (proteinase K and trypsin), but it was not affected by Î±-amylase, catalase, lysozyme, and saliva. The optimum conditions for growth and bacteriocin production of L. fermentum SD11 were cultured at acidic with pH of 5.0-6.0 at 37 or 40Â Â°C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions for 12Â h. It is promising that L. fermentum SD11 and its bacteriocin may be an alternative approach for promoting oral health or prevention of oral diseases, e.g., dental caries and periodontitis, which would require further clinical trials.\n\nPurification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by oral Lactobacillus paracasei SD1.\n\nPubMed\n\nWannun, P; Piwat, S; Teanpaisan, R\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe present study aimed to purify and characterize the antimicrobial protein from Lactobacillus paracasei SD1, which is a strain from the human oral cavity. Antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of L.Â paracasei SD1. Purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by chloroform and gel filtration chromatography. As revealed by SDS-PAGE, the active fraction was homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 25,000Â Da. It was confirmed as having a molecular mass of 24,028.2Â Da by mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial compound, named \"paracasin SD1\", exhibited a broad spectrum against oral pathogens. Paracasin SD1 was stable in a pH range between 3.0 and 8.0 at 100Â Â°C for 5Â min, and showed resistance to Î±-amylase, catalase, lysozyme and whole saliva. However, its activity was lost after proteinase K and trypsin treatment. The results obtained suggest the possibility of using paracasin SD1 for application in prevention/treatment of oral diseases.

Alcohol Denat. and various specially denatured (SD) alcohols are used as cosmetic ingredients in a wide variety of products. Many denaturants have been previously considered, on an individual basis, as cosmetic ingredients by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel, whereas others, including Brucine and Brucine Sulfate, Denatonium Benzoate, and Quassin, have not previously been evaluated. Quassin is a bitter alkaloid obtained from the wood of Quassia amara. Quassin has been used as an insect antifeedant and insecticide and several studies demonstrate its effectiveness. At oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg using rats, Quassin was not toxic in acute and short-term tests, but some reversible piloerection, decrease in motor activity, and a partial loss of righting reflex were found in mice at 500 mg/kg. At 1000 mg/kg given intraperitoneally (i.p.), all mice died within 24 h of receiving treatment. In a cytotoxicity test with brine shrimp, 1 mg/ml of Quassin did not possess any cytotoxic or antiplasmodial activity. Quassin administered to rat Leydig cells in vitro at concentrations of 5-25 ng/ml inhibited both the basal and luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated testosterone secretion in a dose-related fashion. Quassin at doses up to 2.0 g/kg in drinking water using rats produced no significant effect on the body weights, but the mean weights of the testes, seminal vesicles, and epididymides were significantly reduced, and the weights of the anterior pituitary glands were significantly increased. The sperm counts and levels of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone were significantly lower in groups treated with Quassin. Brucine is a derivative of 2-hydroxystrychnine. Swiss-Webster mice given Brucine base, 30 ml/kg, had an acute oral LD(50) of 150 mg/kg, with central nervous system depression followed by convulsions and seizures in some cases.

Consequently, the 3' end of ssu rRNA (3'TAIL) is strongly conserved among bacterial species because a change in the region may impact the translation of many protein-coding genes. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis differ in their 3' ends of ssu rRNA, being GAUC ACCUCCUUA 3' in E. coli and GAUC ACCUCCUU UCU3' or GAUC ACCUCCUU UCUA3' in B. subtilis Such differences in 3'TAIL lead to species-specific SDs (designated SD Ec for E. coli and SD Bs for B. subtilis ) that can form strong and well-positioned SD/aSD pairing in one species but not in the other. Selection mediated by the species-specific 3'TAIL is expected to favor SD Bs against SD Ec in B. subtilis , but favor SD Ec against SD Bs in E. coli Among well-positioned SDs, SD Ec is used more in E. coli than in B. subtilis , and SD Bs more in B. subtilis than in E. coli Highly expressed genes and genes of high translation efficiency tend to have longer SDs than lowly expressed genes and genes with low translation efficiency in both species, but more so in B. subtilis than in E. coli Both species overuse SDs matching the bolded part of the 3'TAIL shown above. The 3'TAIL difference contributes to the host specificity of phages.

This study compared use of the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator (dVSSS) to the standard da Vinci (SdV) robot for skills acquisition in a prospective randomized study. Residents from urology, gynecology, and general surgery programs performed three virtual reality tasks (thread the ring, ring rail, and tubes) on the dvSSS. Participants were then randomized to one of the two study groups (dVSSS and SdV). Each participant then practiced on either the dVSSS or the SdV (depending on randomization) for 30Â min per week over a 4-week time period. The dVSSS arm was not permitted to practice ring rail (due to no similar practice scenario available for the SdV group). Following 4Â weeks of practice, participants performed the same three virtual reality tasks and the results were recorded and compared to baseline. Overall and percent improvement were recorded for all participants from pre-test to post-test. Two-way ANOVA analyses were used to compare the dVSSS and SdV groups and three tasks. Initially, 30 participants were identified and enrolled in the study. Randomization resulted in 15 participants in each arm. During the course of the study, four participants were unable to complete all tasks and practice sessions and were, therefore, excluded. This resulted in a total of 26 participants (15 in the dVSSS group and 11 in the SdV group) who completed the study. Overall total improvement score was found to be 23.23 and 23.48 for the SdV and dVSSS groups, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.9245). The percent improvement was 60 and 47Â % for the SdV and dVSSS groups respectively, which was a statistically significant difference between the two groups and three tasks. Practicing on the standard da Vinci is comparable to practicing on the da Vinci simulator for acquiring robotic surgical skills. In spite of several potential advantages, the dVSSS arm performed no better than the SdV arm in the final\n\nEffect of sensory adaptation on anxiety of children with developmental disabilities: a new approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nShapiro, Michele; Melmed, Raphael N; Sgan-Cohen, Harold D; Parush, Shula\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a sensory-adapted dental environment (SADE) on anxiety, relaxation, and cooperation of children with developmental disabilities (CDDs). Pharmacological treatment has been widely used to reduce anxiety, but nonpharmacological methods may be similarly effective. The standardized clinical situation chosen was a dental hygiene cleaning. A SADE was structured. Sixteen CDDs participated in an open cross-over intervention trial measuring behavioral and psychophysiological variables. There was a substantial increase in relaxation and cooperation in the SADE as opposed to the regular dental environment (RDE). This was reflected by: mean duration of anxious behaviors (SADE = 9.04 minutes vs. RDE = 23.44 minutes; P < .01); mean magnitude of anxious behaviors (SADE = 8.49 vs. RDE = 15.50; P < .01); cooperation levels (SADE = 331 vs. RDE = 1.94; P < .01); mean electrodermal activity (EDA; SADE = 1230 vs. RDE = 446; P < .001); and difference in degree of relaxation by EDA (SADE=2014 vs. RDE=763; P < .004). The findings indicate the potential importance of considering the sensory-adapted environment as a preferable dental environment for this population.\n\nSierra/SD User's Notes.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMunday, Lynn Brendon; Day, David M.; Bunting, Gregory\n\nSierra/SD provides a massively parallel implementation of structural dynamics finite element analysis, required for high fidelity, validated models used in modal, vibration, static and shock analysis of weapons systems.

Audrey; Zabetakis, Dan\n\n2013-05-01\n\nSingle domain antibodies (sdAb) are variable domains cloned from camel, llama, or shark heavy chain only antibodies, and are among the smallest known naturally derived antigen binding fragments. SdAb derived from immunized llamas are able to bind antigens with high affinity, and most are capable of refolding after heat or chemical denaturation to bind antigen again. We hypothesized that the ability to produce heterodimeric sdAb would enable reagents with the robust characteristics of component sdAb, but with dramatically improved overall affinity through increased avidity. Previously we had constructed multimeric sdAb by genetically linking sdAb that bind non-overlapping epitopes on the toxin, ricin. In this work we explored a more flexible approach; the construction of multivalent binding reagents using multimerization domains. We expressed anti-ricin sdAb that recognize different epitopes on the toxin as fusions with differently charged leucine zippers. When the initially produced homodimers are mixed the leucine zipper domains will pair to produce heterodimers. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to confirm heterodimer formation. Surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, and fluid array assays were used to characterize the multimer constructs, and evaluate their utility in toxin detection.\n\nProduct of the SNPP VIIRS SD Screen Transmittance and the SD BRDF (RSB) From Both Yaw Maneuver and Regular On-Orbit Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLei, Ning; Xiong, Xiaoxiong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo assure data quality, the Earth-observing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) regularly performs on-orbit radiometric calibrations of its 22 spectral bands. The primary calibration radiance source for the reflective solar bands (RSBs) is a sunlit solar diffuser (SD). During the calibration process, sunlight goes through a perforated plate (the SD screen) and then strikes the SD. The SD scattered sunlight is used for the calibration, with the spectral radiance proportional to the product of the SD screen transmittance and the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The BRDF is decomposed to the product of its value at launch and a numerical factor quantifying its change since launch. Therefore, the RSB calibration requires accurate knowledge of the product of the SD screen transmittance and the BRDF (RSB; launch time). Previously, we calculated the product with yaw maneuver data and found that the product had improved accuracy over the prelaunch one. With both yaw maneuver and regular on orbit data, we were able to improve the accuracy of the SDSM screen transmittance and the product for the solar diffuser stability monitor SD view. In this study, we use both yaw maneuver and a small portion of regular on-orbit data to determine the product for the RSB SD view.\n\nElucidating the 16S rRNA 3' boundaries and defining optimal SD/aSD pairing in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis using RNA-Seq data.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Yulong; Silke, Jordan R; Xia, Xuhua\n\n2017-12-15\n\nBacterial translation initiation is influenced by base pairing between the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the 5' UTR of mRNA and the anti-SD (aSD) sequence at the free 3' end of the 16S rRNA (3' TAIL) due to: 1) the SD/aSD sequence binding location and 2) SD/aSD binding affinity. In order to understand what makes an SD/aSD interaction optimal, we must define: 1) terminus of the 3' TAIL and 2) extent of the core aSD sequence within the 3' TAIL. Our approach to characterize these components in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis involves 1) mapping the 3' boundary of the mature 16S rRNA using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and 2) identifying the segment within the 3' TAIL that is strongly preferred in SD/aSD pairing. Using RNA-Seq data, we resolve previous discrepancies in the reported 3' TAIL in B. subtilis and recovered the established 3' TAIL in E. coli. Furthermore, we extend previous studies to suggest that both highly and lowly expressed genes favor SD sequences with intermediate binding affinity, but this trend is exclusive to SD sequences that complement the core aSD sequences defined herein.\n\nProducts of the SNPP VIIRS SD Screen Transmittance and the SD BRDFs From Both Yaw Maneuver and Regular On-Orbit Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLei, Ning; Xiong, Xiaoxiong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo ensure data quality, the Earth-observing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite regularly performs on-orbit radiometric calibration of its 22 spectral bands. The primary radiance source for the calibration of the VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSBs) is a sunlit onboard solar diffuser (SD).During the calibration process, sunlight goes through a perforated plate (the SD screen) and then strikes the SD. The sunlight, scattered off the SD of near-Lambertian property, is used for the calibration. Consequently, the spectral radiance of the scattered sunlight is proportional to the product of the SD screen transmittance and the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) value at the observation direction. The BRDF value is decomposed to the product of its initial value at launch and a numerical degradation factor that quantifies the decrease from the initial value. The degradation factor is determined by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). During the BRDF degradation factor determination process, the SDSM receives the SD scattered sunlight and the sunlight that goes through another perforated plate at almost the same time. The ratio of the signal strengths from the two observations is used to determine the BRDF degradation factor. Consequently, the RSB radiometric calibration requires the accurate knowledge of the product of the SD screen transmittance and the initial BRDF value as sensed by the RSB and the SDSM detectors. We use both yaw maneuver and a small portion of regular on-orbit data to determine the products.\n\nUser's Manual for Space Debris Surfaces (SD_SURF)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElfer, N. C.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA unique collection of computer codes, Space Debris Surfaces (SD_SURF), have been developed to assist in the design and analysis of space debris protection systems. SD_SURF calculates and summarizes a vehicle's vulnerability to space debris as a function of impact velocity and obliquity. An SD_SURF analysis will show which velocities and obliquities are the most probable to cause a penetration. This determination can help the analyst select a shield design which is best suited to the predominant penetration mechanism. The analysis also indicates the most suitable parameters for development or verification testing. The SD_SURF programs offer the option of either FORTRAN programs and Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheets and macros. The FORTRAN programs work with BUMPERII version 1.2a or 1.3 (Cosmic released). The EXCEL spreadsheets and macros can be used independently or with selected output from the SD_SURF FORTRAN programs.\n\nSD DOT Customer Survey\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1997-06-30\n\nFollowing a series of qualitative interviews with South Dakota Department of Transportation (SD DOT) as well as consumers during the week of March 24, 1997, a telephone survey of 800 interviews was conducted between April 17 and May 8, 1997 among two...\n\n77 FR 4617 - Environmental Impact Statement: Pennington County, SD\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-01-30\n\n...: Pennington County, SD AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.

Participants were 44 children ages 6-12 (n=22 typical, n=22 ASD). In an experimental crossover design, each participant underwent two professional dental cleanings, one in a regular dental environment (RDE) and one in a SADE, administered in a randomized and counterbalanced order three to four months apart. Outcomes included measures of physiological anxiety, behavioral distress, pain intensity, and sensory discomfort. Both groups exhibited decreased physiological anxiety and reported lower pain and sensory discomfort in the SADE condition compared to RDE, indicating a beneficial effect of the SADE.

Cytokeratins (CKs) which may also be expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are generally considered to be markers for the differentiation of epithelial cells. Small, dense, low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles, also termed LDL-IV, independently predict risk of CVD. Aims: The aims of this study were to develop an analytical method, apart from ultracentrifugation capable of isolating sdLDL in order to study any associated proteins. Materials and Methods: Using modified gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE), de-identified sdLDL-enriched plasma was used to physically elute and isolate sdLDL particles. To validate the finding, additional plasma from 77 normal and 48 higher risk subjects were used to measure sdLDL particles and CK8. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting method were used to identify the characteristics of proteins associated with sdLDL. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was developed and validated for the measurement of CK8 in plasma. Results: The validation of the CK8 ELISA method showed good analytical performance. The isolated sdLDL particles were verified with nondenaturing GGE with the apolipoprotein B component confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting, CK8 was associated with sdLDL. Two-tailed statistical analysis showed that CK8 and sdLDL particles were significantly higher in the high-risk CVD group compared to control group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: This study reports a novel association between CK8 and sdLDL in individuals with CVD who have a predominance of sdLDL.

The annual cumulative dust fluxes released by CTDE events was about one third of that by SADE events, with the order of 103â¼104 Î¼g m-2 s-1. The particle size distributions (PSDs) with diameter between 0.1 and 20 Î¼m during CTDE and SADE events over the Horqin Sandy Land area were simulated based on the fragmentation theory, respectively. The results indicated that an improved equation based on fragmentation theory could be applied to describe the PSDs over the Horqin site which may be because the scale-invariant fragmentation theory mainly explains the PSDs of free dust particles on the surface, which differ from the PSDs of suspend airborne dust and the improved equation was more applicable to the PSDs of SADE events because the dust emission mechanism of SADE are saltation bombardment and aggregation disintegration. The number-related mean aerosol diameters (DN) barely varied under different friction velocity (u*) for SADE events, while the volume-related mean aerosol diameters (DV) changed distinctly with the change of u*. For CTDE events, the DN and DV had no obvious relationship with the change of u* because the dominating influence factor during CTDE event was thermal convection rather than u*. The mass-related PSDs usually exhibited a peak between 0.45 and 0.70 Î¼m during SADE events, while for CTDE events there was a wide peak in the range of 0.10 0.70 Î¼m. The results suggest that DN should be not be recommended as an individual parameter to describe the PSDs. The mass-related PSDs can effectively distinguish the SADE and CTDE events.\n\nThe sdA problem - I. Physical properties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPelisoli, Ingrid; Kepler, S. O.; Koester, D.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe so-called sdA stars are defined by having H-rich spectra and surface gravities similar to hot subdwarf stars, but effective temperature below the zero-age horizontal branch. Their evolutionary history is an enigma: their surface gravity is too high for main-sequence stars, but too low for single evolution white dwarfs. They are most likely byproducts of binary evolution, including blue-stragglers, extremely-low mass white dwarf stars (ELMs) and their precursors (pre-ELMs). A small number of ELMs with similar properties to sdAs is known. Other possibilities include metal-poor A/F dwarfs, second generation stars, or even stars accreted from dwarf galaxies. In this work, we analyse colours, proper motions, and spacial velocities of a sample of sdAs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to assess their nature and evolutionary origin. We define a probability of belonging to the main sequence and a probability of being a (pre-)ELM based on these properties. We find that 7 per cent of the sdAs are more likely to be (pre-)ELMs than main-sequence stars. However, the spacial velocity distribution suggests that over 35 per cent of them cannot be explained as single metal-poor A/F stars.\n\nPattern Driven Selection and Configuration of S&D Mechanisms at Runtime\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrespo, Beatriz Gallego-Nicasio; PiÃ±uela, Ana; Soria-Rodriguez, Pedro; Serrano, Daniel; MaÃ±a, Antonio\n\nIn order to satisfy the requests of SERENITY-aware applications, the SERENITY Runtime Frameworkâs main task is to perform pattern selection, to provide the application with the most suitable S&D Solution that satisfies the request. The result of this selection process depends on two main factors: the content of the S&D Library and the information stored and managed by the Context Manager. Three processes are involved: searching of the S&D Library to get the initial set of candidates to be selected; filtering and ordering the collection, based on the SRF configuration; and perform a loop to check S&D Pattern preconditions over the remaining S&D Artifacts in order to select the most suitable S&D Pattern first, and later the appropriate S&D Implementation for the environment conditions. Once the S&D Implementation is selected, the SERENITY Runtime Framework instantiates an Executable Component (EC) and provides the application with the necessary information and mechanism to make use of the EC.\n\n76 FR 67058 - Amendment of Class E Airspace; Sturgis, SD\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-10-31\n\n...-0430; Airspace Docket No. 11-AGL-10] Amendment of Class E Airspace; Sturgis, SD AGENCY: Federal...

Intimately coupling UV photolysis with biodegradation, realized with the internal loop photobiodegradation reactor, accelerated SD biodegradation and mineralization by 35 and 71 %, respectively. The main organic products from photolysis were 2-aminopyrimidine (2-AP), p-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (ABS), and aniline (An), and an SD-photolysis pathway could be identified using C, N, and S balances. Adding An or ABS (but not 2-AP) into the SD solution during biodegradation experiments (no UV photolysis) gave SD removal and mineralization rates similar to intimately coupled photolysis and biodegradation. An SD biodegradation pathway, based on a diverse set of the experimental results, explains how the mineralization of ABS and An (but not 2-AP) provided internal electron carriers that accelerated the initial mono-oxygenation reactions of SD biodegradation. Thus, multiple lines of evidence support that the mechanism by which intimately coupled photolysis and biodegradation accelerated SD removal and mineralization was through producing co-substrates whose oxidation produced electron equivalents that stimulated the initial mono-oxygenation reactions for SD biodegradation.\n\n78 FR 48302 - Establishment of Class E Airspace; Wagner, SD\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-08-08\n\n...-0004; Airspace Docket No. 13-AGL-1] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Wagner, SD AGENCY: Federal... at Wagner, SD.

The VIIRS regularly performs on-orbit radiometric calibration of its reflective solar bands (RSBs) through observing an onboard sunlit solar diffuser (SD). The reflectance of the SD changes over time and the change is denoted as the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function degradation factor. The degradation factor, measured by an onboard solar diffuser stability monitor, has been shown to be both incident sunlight and outgoing direction dependent. In this Proceeding, we investigate the factor's dependence on SD position. We develop a model to relate the SD degradation factor with the amount of solar exposure. We use Earth measurements to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.\n\nDa Vinci Xi RobotâAssisted Penetrating Keratoplasty\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChammas, Jimmy; Sauer, Arnaud; Pizzuto, JoÃ«lle; Pouthier, Fabienne; Gaucher, David; Marescaux, Jacques; Mutter, Didier; Bourcier, Tristan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose This study aims (1) to investigate the feasibility of robot-assisted penetrating keratoplasty (PK) using the new Da Vinci Xi Surgical System and (2) to report what we believe to be the first use of this system in experimental eye surgery. Methods Robot-assisted PK procedures were performed on human corneal transplants using the Da Vinci Xi Surgical System. After an 8-mm corneal trephination, four interrupted sutures and one 10.0 monofilament running suture were made. For each procedure, duration and successful completion of the surgery as well as any unexpected events were assessed. The depth of the corneal sutures was checked postoperatively using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Results Robot-assisted PK was successfully performed on 12 corneas. The Da Vinci Xi Surgical System provided the necessary dexterity to perform the different steps of surgery. The mean duration of the procedures was 43.4 Â± 8.9 minutes (range: 28.5â61.1 minutes). There were no unexpected intraoperative events. SD-OCT confirmed that the sutures were placed at the appropriate depth. Conclusions We confirm the feasibility of robot-assisted PK with the new Da Vinci Surgical System and report the first use of the Xi model in experimental eye surgery. Operative time of robot-assisted PK surgery is now close to that of conventional manual surgery due to both improvement of the optical system and the presence of microsurgical instruments.

A distinctive feature compared with numerical and previous computer algebra approaches to solving spin dynamics problems results from the fact that no matrix representation for spin operators is used in SD-CAS, which determines a full symbolic character to the performed computations. Spin correlations are stored in SD-CAS as four-entry nested lists of which size increases linearly with the number of spins into the system and are easily mapped into analytical expressions in terms of spin operator products. For the so defined SD-CAS spin correlations a set of specialized functions and procedures is introduced that are essential for implementing basic spin algebra operations, such as the spin operator products, commutators, and scalar products. They provide results in an abstract algebraic form: specific procedures to quantitatively evaluate such symbolic expressions with respect to the involved spin interaction parameters and experimental conditions are also discussed. Although the main focus in the present work is on laying the foundation for spin dynamics symbolic computation in NMR based on a non-matrix formalism, practical aspects are also considered throughout the theoretical development process. In particular, specific SD-CAS routines have been implemented using the YACAS computer algebra package (http://yacas.sourceforge.net), and their functionality was demonstrated on a few illustrative examples.

To provide an example of an occupational therapy feasibility study and evaluate the implementation of a randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial examining the impact of a sensory-adapted dental environment (SADE) to enhance oral care for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHOD. Twenty-two children with ASD and 22 typically developing children, ages 6â12 yr, attended a dental clinic in an urban hospital. Participants completed two dental cleanings, 3â4 mo apart, one in a regular environment and one in a SADE. Feasibility outcome measures were recruitment, retention, accrual, dropout, and protocol adherence. Intervention outcome measures were physiological stress, behavioral distress, pain, and cost. RESULTS. We successfully recruited and retained participants. Parents expressed satisfaction with research study participation. Dentists stated that the intervention could be incorporated in normal practice. Intervention outcome measures favored the SADE condition. CONCLUSION. Preliminary positive benefit of SADE in children with ASD warrants moving forward with a large-scale clinical trial.

With the increased availability of highly sensitive, low cost rapid point-of-care tests, the ability to meet those recommendations has increased, granting wider access to quick and accurate diagnoses. Using blood specimens collected from a Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) sexually transmitted infection clinic, we evaluated the SD Bioline HIV/Syphilis Duo, a rapid test that simultaneously detects antibodies to HIV and syphilis and has the potential to further benefit clinics and patients by reducing costs, testing complexity, and patient wait times. SD DUO HIV sensitivity and specificity, when compared to BCHD results, were 91.7 and 99.5%, respectively. SD DUO syphilis sensitivity and specificity, when compared to rapid plasma reagin, were 85.7 and 96.8%, respectively, and 69.7 and 99.7%, respectively, when compared to Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA). SD DUO syphilis sensitivity and specificity, when compared to a traditional screening algorithm, improved to 92.3 and 100%, respectively, and improved to 72.9 and 99.7%, respectively, when compared to a reverse screening algorithm. The HIV component of the SD DUO performed moderately well. However, results for the SD DUO syphilis component, when compared to TPPA, support the need for further testing and assessment.\n\nProtective effect of DA-9401 in finasteride-induced apoptosis in rat testis: inositol requiring kinase 1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoni, Kiran Kumar; Shin, Yu Seob; Choi, Bo Ram; Karna, Keshab Kumar; Kim, Hye Kyung; Lee, Sung Won; Kim, Chul Young; Park, Jong Kwan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFinasteride is used to treat male pattern baldness and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study investigated the toxicity of finasteride and recovery by DA-9401 using Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Forty adult male SD rats were assigned to four groups: control (CTR), finasteride 1 mg/kg/day (F), finasteride 1 mg/kg + DA-9401 100 mg/kg/day (F + DA 100) and finasteride 1 mg/kg + DA-9401 200 mg/kg/day (F + DA 200). Treatments were by oral delivery once daily for 90 consecutive days. The gross anatomical parameters assessed included: genital organ weight; vas deferens sperm count and sperm motility; testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and malondialdehyde levels; and histological and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of testis for spermatogenic cell density, Johnsen's score and apoptosis. Testicular tissue was also used for evaluating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptotic proteins. Epididymis weight, seminal vesicle weight, prostate weight, penile weight and vas deferens sperm motility showed significant differences between the F group and the CTR, F + DA 100 and F + DA 200 groups. There was no significant change in the testosterone level. DHT level decreased significantly in the F group compared with the CTR group. Testis tissue revealed significant changes in spermatogenic cell density, Johnsen's score and apoptotic index. Western blot showed significant changes in the ER stress and apoptotic markers. Finasteride resulted in reduced fertility and increased ER stress and apoptotic markers, which were recovered by administration of DA-9401 in the SD rats.\n\nEye Shape Using Partial Coherence Interferometry, Autorefraction and SD OCT\n\nPubMed Central\n\nClark, Christopher A.; Elsner, Ann E.; Konynenbelt, Benjamin J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose Peripheral refraction and retinal shape may influence refractive development. Peripheral refraction has been shown to have a high degree of variability and can take considerable time to perform. SD OCT and peripheral axial length measures may be more reliable, assuming that the retinal position is more important than the peripheral optics of the lens/cornea. Methods 79 subjects right eyes were imaged for this study (age range: 22 to 34 yr, refractive error: â10 to +5.00.) Thirty deg SD OCT (Spectralis, Heidleberg) images were collected in a radial pattern along with peripheral refraction with an autorefractor (Shin-Nippon Auto-refractor) and peripheral axial length measurements with partial coherence interferometry (PCI) (IOLmaster, Zeiss). Statistics were performed using repeat measures ANOVA in SPSS (IBM), Bland-Altman analyses, and regression. All measures were converted to diopters to allow direct comparison. Results SD OCT showed a retinal shape with an increased curvature for myopes compared to emmetropes/hyperopes. This retinal shape change became significant around 5 deg. The SD OCT analysis for retinal shape provides a resolution of 0.026 dipopters, which is about ten times more accurate than using autorefraction or clinical refractive techniques. Bland-Altman analyses suggest that retinal shape measured by SD OCT and the PCI method were more consistent with one another than either was with AR. Conclusions With more accurate measures of retinal shape using SD OCT, consistent differences between emmetrope/hyperopes and myopes were found nearer to the fovea than previously reported. Retinal shape may be influenced by central refractive error, and not merely peripheral optics. Partial coherence interferometry and SD OCT appear to be more accurate than autorefraction, which may be influenced other factors such as fixation and accommodation. Autorefraction does measure the optics directly, which may be a strength of that method.

J.; Morales-Rueda, L.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nIt has been suggested that besides stellar companions, substellar objects in close orbits may be able to trigger mass loss in a common envelope phase and form hot subdwarfs. In an ongoing project we search for close substellar companions combining time resolved high resolution spectroscopy with photometry. We determine the fraction of as yet undetected radial velocity variable systems from a sample of 27 apparently single sdB stars to be Ëeq16%. We discovered low-mass stellar companions to the He-sdB CPD-20circ 1123 and the pulsator KPD 0629-0016. The brown dwarf reported to orbit the eclipsing binary SDSS J0820+0008 could be confirmed by an analysis of high resolution spectra taken with UVES. Reflection effects have been detected in the light curves of the known sdB binaries CPD -64circ 481 and BPS CS 22169-0001. The inclinations of these systems must be much higher than expected and the most likely companion masses are in the substellar regime. Finally, we determined the orbit of the sdB binary PHL 457, which has a very small radial velocity amplitude and may host the lowest mass substellar companion known. The implications of these new results for the open question of sdB formation are discussed.\n\n76 FR 67596 - Amendment of Class E Airspace; Spearfish, SD\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-11-02\n\n...

The activation of CSB-SD to activate the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and to increase the number of yeast, prior to making bread, was conducted by mixing CSB-SD with wheat flour and water and then incubating for 24 h. Wheat flour was then substituted by this activated CSB-SD (aCSB-SD) at 10%, 30%, and 50% (w/w) to make bread. Dough and bread properties were studied comparing to the control (without aCSB-SD). From the farinograph results, a high aCSB-SD substitution level resulted in a less stability in dough with a higher degree of softening. Extensigraph results suggested that after aging, all the substituted dough yielded a greater resistance to extension with lower extensibility values than the control. Substitutions with 30% and 50% (w/w) aCSB-SD significantly increased the total CO(2) gas generation. Scanning electron microscopy SEM images of the 30% and 50% (w/w) substituted dough showed a well-developed gluten matrix. The 50% (w/w) substituted breads obtained a greater risen volume, finer crumb grain, and retained more softness after 5-d storage than the control. In addition, both the 30% and 50% (w/w) substituted breads showed a slightly increased mold stability, as compared to the 0% and 10% (w/w) substituted breads.

Therefore, tests detecting H. pylori antibody lack specificity and sensitivity. On the other hand, H. pylori stool antigen tests are reported as an alternative assay because of their reliability and simplicity. However, the comparative performance of H. pylori stool antigen tests for detecting the presence of the bacterium in clinical specimens in the study area is not assessed. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the performance of SD BIOLINE H. pylori Ag rapid test with reference to the commercially available EZ- STEP ELISA and SD BIOLINE H. pylori Ag ELISA tests. Stool samples were collected to analyse the diagnostic performance of SD BIOLINE H. pylori Ag rapid test kit using SD H. pylori Ag ELISA kit and EZ- STEP ELISA tests as a gold standard. Serum samples were also collected from each patient to test for the presence of H. pylori antibodies using dBest H. pylori Test Disk. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and kappa value are assessed. P values <â0.05 were taken statistically significant. Stool and serum samples were collected from 201 dyspeptic patients and analysed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the SD BIOLINE H. pylori Ag rapid test were: 95.6% (95% CI, 88.8-98.8), 92.5% (95%CI, 89-94.1%), 86.7% (95% CI, 80.5-89.6), and 97.6% (95% CI, 993.9-99.3) respectively. The performance of SD BIOLINE H. pylori Ag rapid test was better than the currently available antibody test in study area. Therefore, the SD BIOLINE Ag rapid stool test could replace and be used to diagnose active H. pylori infection before the commencement of therapy among dyspeptic patients.\n\nPerformance of Paracheckâ¢-Pf, SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf and SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf/pan for diagnosis of falciparum malaria in the Central African Republic\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the current complement to microscopy for ensuring prompt malaria treatment. We determined the performance of three candidate RDTs (Paracheckâ¢-Pf, SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf and SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf/pan) for rapid diagnosis of malaria in the Central African Republic. Methods Blood samples from consecutive febrile patients who attended for laboratory analysis of malaria at the three main health centres of Bangui were screened by microscopy and the RDTs. Two reference standards were used to assess the performance of the RDTs: microscopy and, a combination of microscopy plus nested PCR for slides reported as negative, on the assumption that negative results by microscopy were due to sub-patent parasitaemia. Results We analysed 436 samples. Using the combined reference standard of microscopyâ+âPCR, the sensitivity of Paracheckâ¢-Pf was 85.7% (95% CI, 80.8â89.8%), that of SD Bioline Ag-Pf was 85.4% (95% CI, 80.5â90.7%), and that of SD Bioline Ag-Pf/pan was 88.2% (95% CI, 83.2â92.0%). The tests performed less well in cases of low parasitaemia; however, the sensitivity wasâ>â95% atâ>â500 parasites/Î¼l. Conclusions Overall, SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf and SD Bioline malaria Ag-Pf/pan performed slightly better than Paracheckâ¢-Pf.

PCR, DNA sequencing, recombinant protein expression, lectin blot, ultra high performance liquid chromatography analysis and a chitinase assay were used to identify ndoS-like genes and characterize EndoSd. EndoSd were found in four SDSD strains. EndoSd hydrolyzes the chitobiose core of the glycan on IgG. The amino acid sequence of EndoSd is 70% identical to EndoS in S. pyogenes, but it has a unique C-terminal sequence. EndoSd secretion is influenced by the carbohydrate composition of the growth medium. Our findings indicate that IgG glycan hydrolyzing activity is present in SDSD, and that the activity can be attributed to the here identified enzyme EndoSd.\n\nEye shape using partial coherence interferometry, autorefraction, and SD-OCT.\n\nPubMed\n\nClark, Christopher A; Elsner, Ann E; Konynenbelt, Benjamin J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPeripheral refraction and retinal shape may influence refractive development. Peripheral refraction has been shown to have a high degree of variability and can take considerable time to perform. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and peripheral axial length measures may be more reliable, assuming that the retinal position is more important than the peripheral optics of the lens/cornea. Seventy-nine subjects' right eyes were imaged for this study (age range, 22 to 34 years; refractive error, -10 to +5.00). Thirty-degree SD-OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) images were collected in a radial pattern along with peripheral refraction with an autorefractor (Shin-Nippon Autorefractor) and peripheral axial length measurements with partial coherence interferometry (IOLMaster, Zeiss). Statistics were performed using repeated-measures analysis of variance in SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY), Bland-Altman analyses, and regression. All measures were converted to diopters to allow direct comparison. Spectral domain OCT showed a retinal shape with an increased curvature for myopes compared with emmetropes/hyperopes. This retinal shape change became significant around 5 degrees. The SD-OCT analysis for retinal shape provides a resolution of 0.026 diopters, which is about 10 times more accurate than using autorefraction (AR) or clinical refractive techniques. Bland-Altman analyses suggest that retinal shape measured by SD-OCT and the partial coherence interferometry method were more consistent with one another than either was with AR. With more accurate measures of retinal shape using SD-OCT, consistent differences between emmetropes/hyperopes and myopes were found nearer to the fovea than previously reported. Retinal shape may be influenced by central refractive error, and not merely peripheral optics. Partial coherence interferometry and SD-OCT appear to be more accurate than AR, which may be influenced by other factors such as fixation and\n\nRadNet Air Data From Pierre, SD\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis page presents radiation air monitoring and air filter analysis data for Pierre, SD from EPA's RadNet system.

A high-resolution SD-OCT system was built for single-shot imaging of the whole mouse eye in vivo. The axial resolution and imaging depth of the system are 4.5 Î¼m (in tissue) and 5.2 mm, respectively. The system is capable of acquiring a cross-sectional OCT image consisting of 2,048 depth scans in 85 ms. The imaging capability of the SD-OCT system was validated by imaging the normal ocular growth and experimental myopia model using C57BL/6J mice. The biometric dimensions of the mouse eye can be calculated directly from one snapshot of the SD-OCT image. The biometric parameters of the mouse eye including axial length, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, vitreous chamber depth, and retinal thickness were successfully measured by the SD-OCT. In the normal ocular growth group, the axial length increased significantly from 28 to 82 days of age (P < .001). The lens thickness increased and the vitreous chamber depth decreased significantly during this period (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). In the experimental myopia group, there were significant increases in vitreous chamber depth and axial length in comparison to the control eyes (P = .040 and P < .001, respectively). SD-OCT is capable of providing single-shot direct, fast, and high-resolution measurements of the dimensions of young and adult mouse eyes. As a result, SD-OCT is a potentially powerful tool that can be easily applied to research in eye development and myopia using small animal models. Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.\n\n32.

It appears in advanced stages of non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and can lead to vision loss. We present a semi-automated GA segmentation algorithm for spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images. The method first identifies and segments a surface between the RPE and the choroid to generate retinal projection images in which the projection region is restricted to a sub-volume of the retina where the presence of GA can be identified. Subsequently, a geometric active contour model is employed to automatically detect and segment the extent of GA in the projection images. Two image data sets, consisting on 55 SD-OCT scans from twelve eyes in eight patients with GA and 56 SD-OCT scans from 56 eyes in 56 patients with GA, respectively, were utilized to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the proposed GA segmentation method. Experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm can achieve high segmentation accuracy. The mean GA overlap ratios between our proposed method and outlines drawn in the SD-OCT scans, our method and outlines drawn in the fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF) images, and the commercial software (Carl Zeiss Meditec proprietary software, Cirrus version 6.0) and outlines drawn in FAF images were 72.60%, 65.88% and 59.83%, respectively.\n\nBlack Hills Region, SD, USA\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1973-06-22\n\nSL2-81-157 (22 June 1973) --- This view of the Black Hills Region, SD (44.0N, 104.0W) shows the scenic Black Hills where Mt.

Going to heavier nuclei requires new techniques or extensions of old ones. One of these is the so-called No Core Shell Model (NCSM) with a Core approach, which involves an Okubo-Lee-Suzuki (OLS) transformation of a converged NCSM result into a single major shell, such as the sd-shell. The obtained effective two-body matrix elements can be separated into core and single-particle (s.p.) energies plus residual two-body interactions, which can be used for performing standard shell-model (SSM) calculations. As an example, an application of this procedure will be given for nuclei at the beginning ofthe sd-shell.\n\nMolecular Characterization of a Novel Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Isolate SD-15\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Lisai; Lu, Haibing; Cao, Yufeng; Gai, Xiaochun; Guo, Changming; Liu, Yajing; Liu, Jiaxu; Wang, Xinping\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAs one of the major pathogens, bovine viral diarrhea virus caused a significant economic loss to the livestock industry worldwide. Although BVDV infections have increasingly been reported in China in recent years, the molecular aspects of those BVDV strains were barely characterized. In this study, we reported the identification and characterization of a novel BVDV isolate designated as SD-15 from cattle, which is associated with an outbreak characterized by severe hemorrhagic and mucous diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality in Shandong, China. SD-15 was revealed to be a noncytopathic BVDV, and has a complete genomic sequence of 12,285 nucleotides that contains a large open reading frame encoding 3900 amino acids. Alignment analysis showed that SD-15 has 93.8% nucleotide sequence identity with BVDV ZM-95 isolate, a previous BVDV strain isolated from pigs manifesting clinical signs and lesions resembling to classical swine fever. Phylogenetic analysis clustered SD-15 to a BVDV-1m subgenotype. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of glycoproteins revealed that E2 has several highly conserved and variable regions within BVDV-1 genotypes. An additional N-glycosylation site (240NTT) was revealed exclusively in SD-15-encoded E2 in addition to four potential glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) shared by all BVDV-1 genotypes. Furthermore, unique amino acid and linear epitope mutations were revealed in SD-15-encoded Erns glycoprotein compared with known BVDV-1 genotype. In conclusion, we have isolated a noncytopathic BVDV-1m strain that is associated with a disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality, revealed the complete genome sequence of the first BVDV-1m virus originated from cattle, and found a unique glycosylation site in E2 and a linear epitope mutation in Erns encoded by SD-15 strain. Those results will broaden the current understanding of BVDV infection and lay a basis for future investigation on SD-15-related pathogenesis.

The SD oscillator can capture the qualitative characteristics of quasi-zero-stiffness and negative-stiffness. We focus mainly on the primary resonance of the quasi-zero-stiffness SD oscillator and the stochastic resonance (SR) of the negative-stiffness SD oscillator. Using the averaging method, we have been analyzed the amplitude response of the quasi-zero-stiffness SD oscillator. In this regard, the optimum time delay for changing the control intensity according to the optimization standard proposed can be obtained. For the optimum time delay, increasing the displacement feedback intensity is advantageous to suppress the vibrations in resonant regime where vibration isolation is needed, however, increasing the velocity feedback intensity is advantageous to strengthen the vibrations. Moreover, the effects of time-delayed feedback on the SR of the negative-stiffness SD oscillator are investigated under harmonic forcing and Gaussian white noise, based on the Langevin and Fokker-Planck approaches. The time-delayed feedback can enhance the SR phenomenon where vibrational energy harvesting is needed. This paper established the relationship between the parameters and vibration properties of a stiffness nonlinearities SD which provides the guidance for optimizing time-delayed control for vibration isolation and vibrational energy harvesting of the nonlinear systems.\n\nAre sdAs helium core stars?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPelisoli, Ingrid; Kepler, S. O.; Koester, Detlev\n\n2017-12-01\n\nEvolved stars with a helium core can be formed by non-conservative mass exchange interaction with a companion or by strong mass loss. Their masses are smaller than 0.5 Mâ. In the database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), there are several thousand stars which were classified by the pipeline as dwarf O, B and A stars. Considering the lifetimes of these classes on the main sequence, and their distance modulus at the SDSS bright saturation, if these were common main sequence stars, there would be a considerable population of young stars very far from the galactic disk. Their spectra are dominated by Balmer lines which suggest effective temperatures around 8 000-10 000 K. Several thousand have significant proper motions, indicative of distances smaller than 1 kpc. Many show surface gravity in intermediate values between main sequence and white dwarf, 4.75 < log g < 6.5, hence they have been called sdA stars. Their physical nature and evolutionary history remains a puzzle. We propose they are not H-core main sequence stars, but helium core stars and the outcomes of binary evolution. We report the discovery of two new extremely-low mass white dwarfs among the sdAs to support this statement.\n\nRadNet Air Data From Rapid City, SD\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThis page presents radiation air monitoring and air filter analysis data for Rapid City, SD from EPA's RadNet system.

By leveraging infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), virtual SD-EONs (vSD-EONs) can be realized to further enhance the adaptivity of SD-EONs and shorten the time-to-market of new services. In this paper, we design and demonstrate the building and operating of quality-of-service (QoS) aware survivable vSD-EONs that are equipped with transparent data plane (DP) resiliency. Specifically, when slicing a vSD-EON, our network hypervisor (NHV) chooses to use \"1:1\" virtual link (VL) protection or on-demand VL remapping as the DP restoration scheme, according to the service-level agreement (SLA) between the vSD-EON's operator and the infrastructure provider (InP). Then, during an actual substrate link (SL) failure, the NHV realizes automatic DP restoration that is transparent to the controllers of vSD-EONs. We build a network testbed to demonstrate the creation of QoS-aware survivable vSD-EONs, the activation of lightpaths in the vSD-EONs to support upper-layer applications, and the automatic and simultaneous QoS-aware DP restorations during an SL failure. The experimental results indicate that our vSD-EON slicing system can build QoS-aware survivable vSD-EONs on-demand, operate them to set up lightpaths for carrying real application traffic, and facilitate differentiated DP restorations during SL failures to recover the vSD-EONs' services according to their SLAs.\n\nAutomated Segmentability Index for Layer Segmentation of Macular SD-OCT Images.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Kyungmoo; Buitendijk, GabriÃ«lle H S; Bogunovic, Hrvoje; Springelkamp, HenriÃ«t; Hofman, Albert; Wahle, Andreas; Sonka, Milan; Vingerling, Johannes R; Klaver, Caroline C W; AbrÃ moff, Michael D\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo automatically identify which spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans will provide reliable automated layer segmentations for more accurate layer thickness analyses in population studies. Six hundred ninety macular SD-OCT image volumes (6.0 Ã 6.0 Ã 2.3 mm 3 ) were obtained from one eyes of 690 subjects (74.6 Â± 9.7 [mean Â± SD] years, 37.8% of males) randomly selected from the population-based Rotterdam Study. The dataset consisted of 420 OCT volumes with successful automated retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) segmentations obtained from our previously reported graph-based segmentation method and 270 volumes with failed segmentations. To evaluate the reliability of the layer segmentations, we have developed a new metric, segmentability index SI, which is obtained from a random forest regressor based on 12 features using OCT voxel intensities, edge-based costs, and on-surface costs. The SI was compared with well-known quality indices, quality index (QI), and maximum tissue contrast index (mTCI), using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The 95% confidence interval (CI) and the area under the curve (AUC) for the QI are 0.621 to 0.805 with AUC 0.713, for the mTCI 0.673 to 0.838 with AUC 0.756, and for the SI 0.784 to 0.920 with AUC 0.852. The SI AUC is significantly larger than either the QI or mTCI AUC ( P < 0.01). The segmentability index SI is well suited to identify SD-OCT scans for which successful automated intraretinal layer segmentations can be expected. Interpreting the quantification of SD-OCT images requires the underlying segmentation to be reliable, but standard SD-OCT quality metrics do not predict which segmentations are reliable and which are not. The segmentability index SI presented in this study does allow reliable segmentations to be identified, which is important for more accurate layer thickness analyses in research and population studies.\n\n75 FR 69732 - South Dakota Disaster #SD-00035\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-11-15\n\n...

The spectroscopically confirmed sdB sample\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVos, Joris; NÃ©meth, PÃ©ter; VuÄkoviÄ, Maja; Ãstensen, Roy; Parsons, Steven\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHot subdwarf-B (sdB) stars in long-period binaries are found to be on eccentric orbits, even though current binary-evolution theory predicts that these objects are circularized before the onset of Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). To increase our understanding of binary interaction processes during the RLOF phase, we started a long-term observing campaign to study wide sdB binaries. In this paper, we present a sample of composite binary sdBs, and the results of the spectral analysis of nine such systems. The grid search in stellar parameters (GSSP) code is used to derive atmospheric parameters for the cool companions. To cross-check our results and also to characterize the hot subdwarfs, we used the independent XTGRID code, which employs TLUSTY non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models to derive atmospheric parameters for the sdB component and PHOENIX synthetic spectra for the cool companions. The independent GSSP and XTGRID codes are found to show good agreement for three test systems that have atmospheric parameters available in the literature. Based on the rotational velocity of the companions, we make an estimate for the mass accreted during the RLOF phase and the minimum duration of that phase. We find that the mass transfer to the companion is minimal during the subdwarf formation.\n\nFUSE Observations of He-rich sdB Stars\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSwiegart, A. V.; Lanz, T.; Brown, T. M.; Hubeny, I.; Landsman, W. B.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nMost subdwarf B stars are extremely deficient in helium and selected light elements, but a minority are helium-rich. New evolutionary calculations suggest that these helium-rich sdB stars are the result of a delayed helium-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve, which leads to extensive mixing between the hydrogen envelope and helium core. Such mixed stars should show greatly enhanced helium and carbon with respect to the other heavy elements. We have recently obtained FUSE spectra of two helium-rich sdB stars, PG1544+488 and JL87, revealing huge C Ill lines at 977 and 1176 A. Our analysis shows that PG1544+488 has a surface composition of 97% He, 2% C, and 1% N, in agreement with the new evolutionary scenario. While JL87 also reveals a large enrichment in carbon and nitrogen (1.4% and 0.4%, respectively), there is still a significant amount of hydrogen in its atmosphere.\n\nVerification of S&D Solutions for Network Communications and Devices\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRudolph, Carsten; Compagna, Luca; Carbone, Roberto; MuÃ±oz, Antonio; Repp, JÃ¼rgen\n\nThis chapter describes the tool-supported verification of S&D Solutions on the level of network communications and devices.

The purpose is to automatically segment choroid for three-dimensional (3D) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images. We present a novel choroid segmentation strategy for SD-OCT images by incorporating the enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) images. The down boundary of the choroid, namely choroid-sclera junction (CSJ), is almost invisible in SD-OCT images, while visible in EDI-OCT images. During the SD-OCT imaging, the EDI-OCT images can be generated for the same eye. Thus, we present an EDI-OCT-driven choroid segmentation method for SD-OCT images, where the choroid segmentation results of the EDI-OCT images are used to estimate the average choroidal thickness and to improve the construction of the CSJ feature space of the SD-OCT images. We also present a whole registration method between EDI-OCT and SD-OCT images based on retinal thickness and Bruch's Membrane (BM) position. The CSJ surface is obtained with a 3D graph search in the CSJ feature space. Experimental results with 768 images (6 cubes, 128 B-scan images for each cube) from 2 healthy persons, 2 age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 2 diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients, and 210 B-scan images from other 8 healthy persons and 21 patients demonstrate that our method can achieve high segmentation accuracy. The mean choroid volume difference and overlap ratio for 6 cubes between our proposed method and outlines drawn by experts were -1.96Âµm3 and 88.56%, respectively. Our method is effective for the 3D choroid segmentation of SD-OCT images because the segmentation accuracy and stability are compared with the manual segmentation. Copyright Â© 2017.

Little information exists regarding this pathogen, yet it is among the most common viruses detected in serologic surveys of rats used in research. In the study reported here, a novel isolate of RTV, designated RTV1, was cultured from the feces of infected rats. The RTV1 genome contained 8094 nucleotides and had approximately 95% identity with another rat theilovirus, NSG910, and 73% identity with TMEV strains. In addition, the genome size of RTV1 was similar to those of TMEV strains but larger than that reported for NSG910. Oral inoculation of Sprague-Dawley (SD) and CD male rats (n = 10 each group) with RTV1 revealed that SD rats were more susceptible than CD rats to RTV1 infection. At 14 d postinoculation, 100% of SD rats shed virus in the feces, and 70% were positive for RTV serum antibodies. By 56 d postinoculation 30% of SD rats continued to have detectable virus in the feces, and 90% had seroconverted. In contrast, in inoculated CD rats RTV was detected only in the feces at 14 d postinoculation, at which time 40% of CD rats were fecal positive. By 56 d postinoculation only 20% of CD rats had detectable RTV serum antibodies. Our data provide additional sequence information regarding a rat-specific Cardiovirus and indicate that SD rats are more susceptible than CD rats to RTV1 infection.\n\nAn Atlantic streamer in stratospheric ozone observations and SD-WACCM simulation data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHocke, Klemens; Schranz, Franziska; Maillard Barras, Eliane; Moreira, Lorena; KÃ¤mpfer, Niklaus\n\n2017-03-01\n\nObservation and simulation of individual ozone streamers are important for the description and understanding of non-linear transport processes in the middle atmosphere. A sudden increase in mid-stratospheric ozone occurred above central Europe on 4 December 2015. The GROund-based Millimeter-wave Ozone Spectrometer (GROMOS) and the Stratospheric Ozone MOnitoring RAdiometer (SOMORA) in Switzerland measured an ozone enhancement of about 30 % at 34 km altitude (8.3 hPa) from 1 to 4 December. A similar ozone increase is simulated by the Specified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate (SD-WACCM) model. Further, the global ozone fields at 34 km altitude (8.3 hPa) from SD-WACCM and the satellite experiment Aura/MLS show a remarkable agreement for the location and timing of an ozone streamer (large-scale tongue-like structure) extending from the subtropics in northern America over the Atlantic to central Europe. This agreement indicates that SD-WACCM can inform us about the wind inside the Atlantic ozone streamer. SD-WACCM shows an eastward wind of about 100 m s-1 inside the Atlantic streamer in the mid-stratosphere. SD-WACCM shows that the Atlantic streamer flows along the edge of the polar vortex. The Atlantic streamer turns southward at an erosion region of the polar vortex located above the Caspian Sea. The spatial distribution of stratospheric water vapour indicates a filament outgoing from this erosion region. The Atlantic streamer, the polar vortex erosion region and the water vapour filament belong to the process of planetary wave breaking in the so-called surf zone of the northern midlatitude winter stratosphere.\n\nSex differences in the stress response in SD rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Jing; Wu, Xue-Yan; Zhu, Qiong-Bin; Li, Jia; Shi, Li-Gen; Wu, Juan-Li; Zhang, Qi-Jun; Huang, Man-Li; Bao, Ai-Min\n\n2015-05-01\n\nSex differences play an important role in depression, the basis of which is an excessive stress response. We aimed at revealing the neurobiological sex differences in the same study in acute- and chronically-stressed rats. Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), acute foot shock (FS) and controls, animals in all 3 groups were sacrificed in proestrus or diestrus. Male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: CUMS, FS and controls. Comparisons were made of behavioral changes in CUMS and control rats, plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT), testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2), and of the hypothalamic mRNA-expression of stress-related molecules, i.e. estrogen receptor Î± and Î², androgen receptor, aromatase, mineralocorticoid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. CUMS resulted in disordered estrus cycles, more behavioral and hypothalamic stress-related molecules changes and a stronger CORT response in female rats compared with male rats. Female rats also showed decreased E2 and T levels after FS and CUMS, while male FS rats showed increased E2 and male CUMS rats showed decreased T levels. Stress affects the behavioral, endocrine and the molecular response of the stress systems in the hypothalamus of SD rats in a clear sexual dimorphic way, which has parallels in human data on stress and depression.

Genetically marked auxotrophic strains were produced by mutation with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Protoplast fusion of pairs of unlike doubly auxotrophic strains and isolation of stable prototrophic fusion products were carried out. By growth of the fusion products on complete medium, selective pressure for prototrophy was removed and auxotrophic segregants were allowed to form. Analysis of these and recovery of segregants with nonleaky, non-parent-type combinations of auxotrophic characteristics has provided strong evidence that a parasexual cycle can function in Claviceps sp. strain SD 58. Preliminary work suggests that the genetics of ergot might be studied by mitotic analysis and that protoplast fusion and selection procedures might be useful for the enhancement of favorable characteristics in Claviceps strains.
