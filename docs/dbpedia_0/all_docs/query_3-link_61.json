        "text": "The hard-hitting, melodic heavy metal band Alcatrazz celebrate RSD Drops 2021 with the release of a colored double vinyl edition of their latest studio offering, Born Innocent. The 13-track opus, having previously only been available on CD and digital formats and never on vinyl will be a must-have collectible for anyone who considers themselves a fan of rock (pun intended!)\n\nTheir first studio venture since 1986s Dangerous Game. Alongside the unique vocal prowess and range of star frontman and founding member Graham Bonnet, Born Innocent also features fellow founding members Jimmy Waldo and Gary Shea. And from the classic album art, featuring the mighty rock itself, Born Innocent is a journey into the sort of heavy, melodic and supremely articulated hard rock that is a cornerstone of the likes of Rainbow and the Michael Schenker Group, territory Alcatrazz successfully strode in the 80s before going on hiatus.\n\nBorn Innocent was produced by Jimmy Waldo with Giles Lavery and mixed and mastered by Andy Haller and features many former stars from Graham's long career. Guest appearances include Chris Impellitteri, who wrote the music and played all guitars on the arpeggio-powered Born Innocent, with Bonnets vocals soaring to old-school heights, as did Bob Kulick for the majestic I Am The King. Virtuoso Japanese guitar maestro Nozomu Wakai similarly wrote and played guitars on the double-kick steel-plated Irish warrior ode Finn McCool, while the six-string legend that is Steve Vai wrote Dirty Like The City, with Bonnet once again powerfully hitting notes that are beyond the business of most humans.\n\nAs fans will immediately hear, Alcatrazz are back doing what only they can do with Born Innocent, delivering quality hard rock with genuine storyteller lyrics, virtuoso performances and an added layer of modern heavy that underscores the melodic excellence. Dont miss out on this piece of rock history.\n\nBorn Innocent/Polar Bear/ Finn McCool/We Still Remember/London 1666/Dirty Like the City/I Am the King/Something That I Am Missing/Paper Flags/The Wound Is Open/Body Beautiful/Warth Lane/For Tony\n\nAfter the release of the Beat Farmers successful 1985 debut album Tales Of The New West, the band did a tour of the UK and Europe and while there recorded a six song EP originally only released in the UK, and never on vinyl in the US. Glad N' Greasy features the original members of this alt-country band that was an influence on many bands and artists in the much larger Americana movement that followed. Many consider the six songs on Glad N Greasy to be the Beat Farmers finest hour. The reissue comes in a gatefold jacket with photos and notes written by the band.\n\nSide 1: 1. Powderfinger 2. Death Train 3. Beat Generation\n\nSide 2: 1. Glad N Greasy 2. Delayed Reaction 3. Big Rock Candy Mountain\n\nThis recording features a full performance by great musicians at their peak, providing a \"you are there\" experience of the excitement of great music and an appreciative crowd. Mastered from the original tape reels by Kevin Gray, the limited-edition 180g 3LP set includes an extensive booklet with rare photos, plus interviews with Carlos Garnett and Cecil McBee. Award-winning arts journalist and critic Mark Stryker contributes the main essay alongside remembrances by American journalist, educator, author, activist and friend of Roy Brooks Herb Boyd, alto saxophone legend Charles McPherson (who grew up with Roy Brooks), Louis Hayes (who got Roy the gig with Horace Silver) and more. The project came about as a desire by Reel to Real Recordings to make a positive contribution to Black Lives Matter. Understanding is our celebration of the talent, courage and spirit of the Black musicians who created a timeless and universal art, with the recognition that the injustices of 50 years ago are still with us. Proceeds will go directly to The Detroit Sound Conservancy. The album is produced with the cooperation of Cecil McBee and Carlos Garnett and the estates of Roy Brooks, Harold Mabern and Woody Shaw.\n\nAbout the artist: In his younger days in Detroit, Brooks started off drumming with Yusef Lateef. He played with Horace Silver from 1959-64, including on the album Song for My Father; in 1963 he released his first album as a leader. Following this he freelanced in New York City through the 1960s and early 1970s, playing with Lateef again (1967-70), Sonny Stitt, Lee Morgan, Dexter Gordon, Chet Baker, Junior Cook, Blue Mitchell, Charles McPherson, Pharoah Sanders (1970), Wes Montgomery, Dollar Brand, Jackie McLean, James Moody (1970-72), Charles Mingus (1972-73), and Milt Jackson. His 1970 album The Free Slave featured Cecil McBee and Woody Shaw. Later in 1970 he joined Max Roach's ensemble M'Boom, and in 1972 put together the ensemble The Artistic Truth.\n\nTrack Listing: Side 1: Prelude To Understanding (22:13) Side 2: Understanding (20:17) Side 3: Billies Bounce (21:04) Side 4: Zoltan (24:04) Side 5: Taurus Woman (17:39) Side 6: Taurus Woman Continuation, The Theme (20:33)\n\nSoundtrack to the Emmy award-winning HBO TV drama starring Mark Ruffalo. Comprises original score by Harold Budd alongside curated archive selections used in the show. At the time the show originally aired in summer 2020, this was the first new music to be heard from Budd in over six years. Tragically it also ended up being some of the last, as he passed away in December at the age of 84. The Guardian wrote Harold Budd's sublime music was a gateway to a brighter world. It can't be contained with the term 'ambient', it is a guide to dreamworlds and a haven in tough times. His albums are a gateway to a beyond and an invitation to exist, however briefly, above yourself. Pressed on clear vinyl.\n\nSide A: 1. Penny Ann Drinkwater 2. The Serpent (In Quicksilver) 3.

He was a member of the famous Wrecking Crew, played on Lawrence Welk, recorded Frank Zappas first demo, and even backed Elvis Presley on film. His inventions include the Wah-Wah pedal and the Ecco-Fonic, influencing the development of electric guitar playing. In 1978, Casher was impressed by Bill Conti's top selling score for Rocky, and set out to make an album with original compositions of disco and jazz/funk inspired by the film. With a series of tunes written, he gathered some of the top studio players in Hollywood including Billy Preston, Stan Worth, and members of Johnny Carson's Tonight Show band. The working title for this album in the making was called Music Inspired By Rocky And Other Compositions. A film company who had acquired the rights to Sylvester Stallone's 1970 debut \"The Party At Kitty And Stud's\" heard the music and immediately recognized it as the perfect fit for their rebranded Italian Stallion film release. Though the score was never released outside of the film, it generated lots of interest in the early 2000s when the internet became a widespread phenomenon, and fans began recording the audio off of the film themselves. The soundtrack for Italian Stallion stands on its own as a musical masterpiece. Over 40 years later, with the help of ORG Music, Del Casher dug up his original master tapes and assembled a records worth of material for the soundtracks first ever release. Italian Stallion will make its long overdue debut with a vinyl pressing, exclusively for RSD 2021.\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. Italian Stallion Theme 2. Three Girls In A Whirl 3. Flexing 4. Outside Walk 5.

As it is, the younger Davies brother has accomplished much more. His first studio album in over 20 years finds Ray's frequently overshadowed sibling reviving that rather charming '70s device, the concept album--the plot here revolving around extraterrestrial visitation and brain implantation. Davies brings the idea of benign aliens a little closer in a collection that recalls some of the best trends of the '60s and '70s. He uses a rock template that harkens back to post-Tommy Who (\"The Lie\"), Mott the Hoople (\"Whose Fooling Who\"), and Deep Purple (\"It Ain't Over 'Till It's Done\"), sounding rather anachronistic as a result. The songs are engaging and show Davies to be a writer of considerable skill and wit, but they're somewhat stuck in the way-back machine.\n\n1. Who's Foolin' Who 2. It Ain't over, 'Till Its Done! 3. The Lie! 4. Let Me Be 5. Displaced Person 6. Rock You, Rock Me 7. Flowers in the Rain 8. Fortis Green 9. Why?!! 10. True Phenomenon 11. Bug 12. De-Bug 13. Life After Life (Transformation)\n\nMiles Davis had a deep love and respect for boxing, seeing deep parallels between the sweet science and his own relationship with music. One of Miles favorites of his own recordings was the 1971 soundtrack to the Bill Cayton documentary about Jack Johnson, and he was inspired by the political and racial subtext of the legendary boxers saga. Culled from the celebrated expanded project The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions released in 2003, and name-checking a number of pugilistic legends (Ali, Sugar Ray, Duran, Johnny Bratton), these funk-infused recordings rock harder than anything else that Miles put to tape. Featuring a sterling line-up of musicians (Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Dave Holland, Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Cobham) and a legendary cover photo of Miles in the ring captured by Jim Marshall, the release finds this music issued on vinyl (in brilliant yellow), for general release, for the first time ever.\n\nSide A 1. Duran - Take 4 2. Sugar Ray 3. Johnny Bratton Take 4\n\nSide B 1. Ali - Take 3 2. Ali - Take 4 3. Right Off - Take 11\n\nThe science fiction masterpiece has captured the imagination of another generation with news of a new Matrix film.

Dorm rooms coast to coast transform into audio dub houses where young women with aching arms scratch out hand-written labels and personal letters like \"you have to hear this.\" These quasi-booking agent and pirate distributors work long into the night purchasing greyhound tickets for a certain young Folksinger to come play at their school. Today. Folk and poetry prevail. Vulnerable stories arm themselves as powerful songs on Ani DiFranco's self-titled first solo record. Ani's voice is rich and eloquent. Her guitar moves like an appendage. From cockroach pus to abortion rights the record doesn't flinch. This singer/songwriter folk mecca contains songs with an epic stage life such as, \"Both Hands,\" \"Out of Habit,\" \"The Slant,\" and \"Fire Door.\" All of the tracks embody the love and humor inherent in Ani's music. Thematically this record gives a face to feminism that is both beautiful and accessible to anyone. The stories focus on relationships and humanity. We sit in the waiting room of an abortion clinic after facing an angry crowd in \"Lost Woman Song.\" \"Talk to Me Now\" and \"The Story\" confront the inequality of the sexes in a man's world. The love songs examine relationships with the same discernment as the political ones. \"Both Hands\" is a hands down favorite among any DiFranco fan. \"Every Angle\" infuses the thrill of protest with the joy of a crush, \"thoughts of you are picketing my brain/ they refuse to work such long hours without rest/ in unstable conditions at best.\" And the unforgettably poetic and guitarific, \"Fire Door\" is a heartfelt treat in its first studio recording.\n\n1. Both Hands 2. Talk to Me Now 3. The Slant 4. Work Your Way Out 5. Dog Coffee 6. Lost Woman Song 7. Pale Purple 8. Rush Hour 9. Fire Door 10. The Story 11. Every Angle 12. Out of Habit 13.
