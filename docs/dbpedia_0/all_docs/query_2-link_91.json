        "text": "Blimey, how the Jebus did we get to mid December already?! Well if it be that time of the year, then I guess it must be time for Tracksuite’s Best 50 Tracks of 2023, brought to you, as tradition now serves, in a lovingly crafted playlist bundle. Presented for your aural pleasure through Spotify, if that’s your thing. Or the hit of the whole fruit both audio and visual via YouTube.\n\nI hope you got the chance to check out the Best Albums of 2023 blog. If not, simply carry on scrolling down below for a choice word or two about the 10 best long player selections of the year with some YouTube pickings to give you a flavour. If you’ve already devoured the blog then you’ll already have a heads up on 10 of the tunes included in the following playlist. There’s never more than one track from any particular album in this playlist, quite simply there’s just too much good stuff out there and while there’s always lots of love to go around, there’s not always the playlist space.\n\nSo what’s in there? demands the impatient listener. Well, its a Tracksuite mix, so it covers the bases; pop, rock, indie, country, funk, soul, some alt variants, post punk, folk, jazz, dance, rap, drum and bass etc sub genre derivatives etc. Kicking off with a sublime new turn from Mitski. Highlights include a sixties sounding gem from The Lathums. A deadly rocker from Josienne Clark. Dark dancehall return from Chase and Status. Typical Lankum genius and some Lankum infused and influenced brilliance with Øxn. Delicious beats from Prof. Yard Act turned up to 11. A masterpiece from Roseanne Reid and finishing up down the Mother Road with Grace Potter. Aswell as whole jammed pick n mix of other treats for your ears.\n\nStay tuned for the festive favourite, Xmasuite 2023, a 30 track strong playlist of christmas tunes you’re not much likely to hear anywhere else.\n\nLove as always, D@Tracksuite\n\nAfter the first couple of months of the year passing without note, March 24th brought the release of ‘False Lankum’ on Rough Trade Records, named after the original John Reilly ballad from which the previously named ‘Lynched’ claimed their new moniker in 2016. It’s the Irish folk giants third long player and the third to be included in a Tracksuite best album of the year list. It’s fair to say we love this band. Since catching them live touring their Between the Earth and Sky album, in the relatively modestly sized Oran Mor venue in Glasgow, their popularity is growing at a hefty rate that now sees them packing out much bigger venues across this country and further afield. In parallel with their growing audiences, or perhaps due in no small part to them, their sound is maturing and expanding. Clash Music said ‘The record swells and retreats at will as the group flex their musical dexterity’. They sure did.\n\nIf you haven’t been lucky enough to experience Lankum, then the album’s opener ‘Go Dig My Grave’ is where they lay out their stall, a perfect example of what they do and how they do it. You may have heard a version of the folk ballad ‘The Butcher’s Boy’ via anyone from The Clancy Brothers to Kirsty MacColl to Elvis Costello but whoever you heard deliver it, it was unlikely to sound like this. Altogether darker and more foreboding, like their version of The ‘Wild Rover’ from the last album ‘The Livelong Day’. Instead of cleaning up bloodthirsty and often terrifying folk stories for a popular audience, they go the other way and heighten the horror with drone and clatter. All the time with Radie Peat’s inimitable vocals, the sound of a fallen angel if ever there was, painting the details onto these songs like Goya’s paintings in sound.\n\n‘They returned with a successor that takes what worked on their previous album and pushes further in every direction. Radie Peat and producer Spud Murphy have spread their remarkable talents this year in the recently released debut six track long(ish) player from fellow doom folk band Øxn, alongside Katie Kim and Eleanor Myler, the highlights of which are undoubtedly the very Lankumesque and brilliant tracks, ‘Cruel Mother’ and ‘The Wife of Michael Cleary’.\n\nThe Guardian said, ’There is so much to revel in here. ... They remain a radical band while making music that is reaching out to the mainstream – while also giving off the thrilling sense that there is so much more to come’. Tracksuite wholeheartedly agrees.\n\nOther album highlights are the stunning love story ‘Newcastle’, the haunting ‘Lord Abore and Mary Flynn’, the tale of a mother poisoning her own son to stop a marriage and ending with incredible ‘The Turn’. This Lankum original closes the album, the song stretching and peeling off, carrying the spirits with it.\n\nAnother African artist pushing at the boundaries of the traditional is South African singer-songwriter Bongeziwe Mabandla, releasing his fourth studio album, AmaXesha, on May 5th. via both Black Major and Platoon.\n\nMabandla has always had high quality songs built on a very individual sound. Ever since his debut album Umlilo in 2012, although wholly more organic and traditional in terms of approach, the signature feel of his music as sensual, soaring and spiritual has always been there. It was in his follow up long player Mangaliso in 2017 that we started to find traces of experimentation in production, courtesy of his career long collaboration and relationship with producer Tiago Correia-Paulo. Then through last album Iimini and the new album, the symbiosis between pushing the dual crafts of performance and production have been refined to perfection. The journey arc of music through this album is beautifully choreographed and to echo the sentiment of Mabandla himself in discussion with his producer during recording of ‘Xesha’, properly allows the listener to ‘vibe out’.\n\nThe Guardian said ‘No longer just an interpretation of Xhosa folk music, ‘AmaXesha’ places Mabandla’s music firmly in its own lane, capable of transmuting the shades of tradition into something else entirely’.\n\nAn album highlight and one that perfectly encapsulates the sense of the album is ‘Ukuthanda Wena’, translated as ‘Loving You’. Built on a skipping pulse beat and dark atmospheric synth bed, reminiscent of The XX, Mabandla’s vocal shines, delicately balanced on top of relentless waves of electronica. The vocals coming straight from the heart, the yearning and longing is, yes, heart breaking, but impossible not to be drawn to. From the moment the epic build finally breaks into the vocal on the stunning opener ‘Sisahleleleni (Part 1)’, you can feel the power of the sentiment that echoes throughout. As with so many albums just now, the concepts and writing were explored and shaped through Covid lockdown and Mabandla’s sensitivity from that time is to the fore in this music.\n\nAfrican culture magazine Okay Africa says ‘AmaXesha captures that yearning for true connection, a yearning the pandemic only made more acute.’\n\nThe album’s first single ‘Noba Bangathini’ is an admittedly slow ponderous track but the feel of it is as if stumbling along fits the idea of a soul lost in love perfectly. ‘Hlala’ picks up the pace and uplifts the spirit in a joyous danceable treat. ‘Ndikhale’ takes a step back into the traditional gospel folk style but feels no less modern or out of place here. As the album approaches the end, another stand out track is the moving ‘Libali’, a soulful rhythmic wonder with another distinctive vocal hook over the reflective lines ‘I have not forgotten, I have still not forgotten’. Then finally, what is effectively the album closer, (minus 3rd part of refrain Xesha, with the sumptuous ‘Ubukho Bakho’, which I think translates as ‘Your Presence’), a Tracy Chapman like number that seems to be sum up the introspection reflected throughout the album, while also looking forward and outwards from it.\n\nNext up, on June 2nd, Roseanne Reid released her sophomore album, ‘Lawside’, on Last Man Music. Her excellent debut, ‘Trails', from 2019, featured on that year’s Tracksuite best of the year list, with a collection of such finely crafted and ageless songs, the like of which, I profer, have ne’er been found on a debut album for quite some time. And Reid has just picked up from where that album left off. Another collection of classic sounding tracks that takes her further towards, if a little early to proclaim, as one of the finest Scottish songwriters ever.\n\n‘If Americana dominated her 2019 debut ‘Trails’, ’Lawside’ returns Reid to her Scottish roots. Through simple but fabulously effective instrumentation runs an unmistakable Celtic streak. To her previously soft Appalachian sound Reid now puts her vocals right up front. ‘All pulled together ‘Lawside’ is a complete success’ - Americana UK\n\nAlong with churning out folk country gems by the truckload and charming her evermore increasing number of fans, Reid has also been very busy on a personal level since her last album. She is now married and has her first child, the love of both a constant reference throughout the album, heard immediately in the sublime opener ‘All I Need’, a love letter to her wife. ‘Couldn’t Wish More For You’ and ‘All My Days’ both shine with the love for her son and are clearly lit with joy. Album highlight, in an album packed with highlights, ‘Mona Lisa’ is quite a rare treat from Reid, as she really cuts loose proclaiming that joy with a rollicking bootscooter. Online mag At The Barrier said ‘From hymn to hoedown, Mona Lisa is a gradually escalating hootenanny, a vocal chorale bolstering the feel good fiddle and accordion, a banjo plonking away with intent. The slightest song here, it’s placing is integral to the mood of the whole, coming as light relief between the headier tracks’.\n\nOne of the age old perks of success in the music industry is the ability for the artist to have more choice and control over the production of their art. Admittedly it’s not always the key to better product, an elusive secret to the x factor of perfect product remains mostly elusive. However, where her debut album was done in a five day rush in Brooklyn, albeit in the hands of the genius Teddy Thompson, this was completed in comparatively more relaxed circumstances with musical partner David Macfarlane in a studio just up the road in Perth. Rushed or not rushed, she delivers.\n\nKicking any second album syndrome fears into touch; this seems certain to figure in year-end best-of lists and launch her into the wider consciousness of fans on both sides of the Atlantic. - Folk Radio\n\nCatch this lady play live as soon as you possibly can, her performance is one of subtle perfection. A delicate artistry that can hush even the largest of spaces and break the largest of hearts. But if you can’t get out to see her, you will not regret investing in her two albums (and a lovely wee EP in the middle). Just turn off the world and soak up flawless ageless songwriting.\n\nHere we have another example of a perfect follow up album that arrived via Partisan Records on 23rd June, with ‘3D Country’ from Brooklyn based five piece indie rock band Geese. Their debut ‘Projector’ also made it into Tracksuite’s Best album list in 2021. A band with mastery beyond their years, their debut was a mashup of indie punk heritage with everything 1981 through 2021. Here, as to be expected, is a broadening of the sound, bringing in all sorts of new influences like sixties new wave, seventies prog, r&b, grunge, alt country and more. Tracks like funky hot stepper ‘Mysterious Love’ sound like the Rolling Stones one minute with Mick Jagger wailing over a Keith Richards groove but then soon after a guitar chop the breakdown drops into nineties alt rock before returning to the Jagger refrain. ‘I See Myself’ carries the spirit of Prince straight into a late career Chris Cornell riff. ‘Tomorrow’s Crusades’ would not seem out of place on the stage at Woodstock. All the time this is all going on, they manage to lose absolutely none of their original essence and sound irrefutably just like themselves.\n\nLike Paste put it, ‘Across 11 tracks, 3D Country is gnarled, chaotic and vibrant. But, what’s potentially the most-shattering truth of all is that, amid all of this charismatic, wholehearted sonic anarchy, Geese have only just begun.’ After a few listens to both of Geese’s album, it can come as quite a shock when you’re reminded that these are still just the first two albums from still a relatively young group of musicians.\n\nAlbum highlights are very difficult to pick out with a band that likes to load each track with a few more hooks and a couple more riffs than you’d expect to find in a rock tune, notwithstanding all the tempo changes and influence switches. However opener ‘2122’ is such an immediate and fully loaded attack on the senses, it will stick with you and to you throughout. An anarchic punk/country/prog hybrid monster of a tune, its a demonstration of all the growl this band can muster and a swift kicking down of the sides to the box that the band had been popped in following their debut. Incredible to think the plan for these guys was to split after the first album to concentrate on college and university. Plans we can all thank the gods for have been stuck on the back burner for the time being. Anyway, ’2122’ can be found in Tracksuite’s Best 50 Tracks of 2023 playlist.\n\nReleased on the same day as Geese’s ‘3D Country’ via Poison City Records and Merge Records came the third studio album ‘All her Plans’ from Melbourne punk trio Cable Ties. Described by Merge as ‘fierce, tense rock’n’roll’, they take the three-minute punk burner and stretch it past breaking point to deliver smouldering feminist anthems.’ Another band that only pinged on to the Tracksuite radar this year and whose work up till this point is still to be explored. However it appears by a brief dip of the aural toe into the first two albums, that these guys are punk to the core and have been true to the form from their beginnings.\n\nClearly snapping at the bit, there’s no building into this. Opener ‘Crashing Through’ does just that, straight into an insistent bass line and drum kick, while vocalist Jenny McKechnie greets us with a ‘Everybody’s ready, Everybody’s waiting, For me to get into gear. I keep it steady, Trying to keep my brain from, Sliding sideways out of my ear!’ You just know there’s going to be no letting up from there. The rhythm keeps driving and the vocals pitch up from a snarl into something you don’t hear a lot in rock these days, a classic rock falsetto reminiscent of Robert Plant, and I have to say I didn’t know I missed that sound until now. There’s an intermittent but consistent return to it all the way through this album and never once does it feel like its forced or referential for the sake it. Instead it seems the natural platform of expression for McKechnie as she bounces back and forth from hooks of sneer and drawl to this high pitched, anthemic nod to rock royalty . Follow up track ‘Perfect Client’ just gets faster, higher and more forceful.\n\nThere’s a purveying garage rock roots sensibility here. I don’t know these people but the music tells me that they are happiest when playing up close to their audience, in some rough and ready sweat pit than in bigger more refined settings. So, if they aren’t already, very soon they’re going to have to make the inevitable and unavoidable tough choice of how to cater for increasing audience numbers while retaining the intimacy that thus far still tightly informs their brilliant output.\n\nAfter a smattering of dazzling single and EP releases, like the pulsing megagroove of ‘LeBron James’ from 2019 and jagged swing of ‘Rolex’ from 2021, the debut album from Nottingham post punkers ‘Do Nothing’ was much anticipated. However, when it finally arrived on June 30th this year via Exact Truth, it’s fair to say it is not what was expected. The extroverted swagger of the pre album releases was followed by a self proclaimed ‘creative stutter’, and the album has turned inside to achieve a more introverted, subtler sound. It’s not lost one bit of the wry humour that gives the band their signature bite but the critics have rather unsurprisingly and perhaps a little tediously gone too cold on what, with a bit more investment than background listening, is actually a complex and deeply rewarding collection of songs.\n\nThat said, the lead single ‘Happy Feet’, released in February, plays closest to the early releases with its punchier rhythm and singalong hook but all the while there’s an irrefutable sense of unease in the tone of it, an echo of the nagging doubt any adult can find creeping in after the shine of your cocky early years start to fade, and it’s that that makes this album so intriguing. It wouldn’t be the first time this listener’s opinion forks off from the trodden path and age sometimes plays a part in that. Yes, I heard The Fall and The Walkmen and the many other comparisons that have been given the band before but I think they’ve done very quickly what most bands in similar situation fail to do because they don’t want to do, and that’s shirk of the branding that’s always comparing them and never allowing them to be. By avoiding treading those softened boards of success and not exemplifying the comparisons and posturing appropriately, they have dug down to the roots of something that has the makings of being bigger and far more interesting.\n\nThe title track ‘Snake Sideways’ is the game changer. For the visual thinkers out there, it has the feel of a small stage lit in high contrast by a single spotlight. Have a look at the album cover for reference. A light buzz in the audio suggests an opening as a sound system settles. A jazz bass and scattering drum beat backs singer Chris Bailey drooped pensively over the mic stand like a seasoned stand up. Then the real discovery of the new Do Nothing is his voice. The confident spoken word is still strong here but now there’s added cream on the pudding with honey dipped vocals that wield real power. Sitting comfortably alongside the cutting wit is aching introspection and its in this where Do Nothing now play their game and where they will undoubtedly thrive.\n\nIt was all very contemporary from UK/US Soul trio Gabriels with a drip feed release of their debut album ‘Angels and Queens’. The initial taster seven track Part 1 was released in September 2022, then the full 12 track album, inclusive of the initial part 1, released on 7 July this year by Atlas Artists and Parlophone. Then came the 20 track deluxe edition that included a few extras and 5 tracks from their Glastonbury 2022 set. But let us stick with the 12 track release before I invite the wrath of the fairness trolls, should any other releases in this blog have any bumper editions that I am unaware of. That and, well, as 12 tracks go, it is more than enough.\n\n‘Every song is a wonder. It is unlikely Angels & Queens will inspire many imitators of its retro-future soul, its damaged doo-wop. It’s simply too good to be copied’ - The Observer\n\nKicking off from their brilliant first couple of introductory EPs in 2021 ‘Love and Hate in a Different Time’, two songs from which have been punched for the full album, and ‘Bloodline’, Gabriels continue to embellish and elevate their custom sound of gospel rhythm and blues. The first offering, aptly named ‘Offering’ sets out their choir stall with a solid soulful dancefloor filler. A pin perfect rhythm section from Ryan Hope and Ali Balouzian, feels both nostalgic and yet crispy fresh at once. Topped, of course, by the inexplicably beautiful voice of Compton’s own Jacob Lusk, a talent that appears to span generations in referential ability. On top of all that, of course, the album is blessed with the hefty production talents of Mark Anthony Spears, aka, Sounwave, a big time player who has worked with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift and Beyonce.\n\nAlbum highlight still remains the same as the track included in Tracksuite’s best tracks of last year playlist, ‘Taboo’. Apparently about a complex relationship that defies societal norms and expectations, they execute this by crafting a complex and bewilderingly good tune that defies all musical norms and industry expectations. Three minutes of breathtaking drama and released joy. ‘Professional’ is sumptuous vintage homage to early cinema and stage and ‘Glory’ is a fully ‘hands in the air’ disco delight. But Tracksuite’s choice for the 2023 playlist is the infectious Al Green type soul slinker ‘Remember Me’, a sublime mood setter, suited to both a low lit intimate dance space with the one you hold closest and also the fully lit club experience.\n\nOn Sept 8th, the hugely exciting Brighton based electro punk trio CLT DRP released the follow up to their brilliant debut album from 2020, ‘Without The Eyes’. An incredibly tough act to follow, the critically acclaimed debut was a thoroughly welcome left field attack on the senses in every way that a punk album should be, never cowing to outdated dogma about what punk is and the rules it should follow (seriously, they do that!), but insisting on breaking the mould. Now with ‘Nothing Clever, Just Feelings’, another lovely wry title, released on creative punk label Venn Records, the band have crashed through their own mould before it’s even had a chance to set. While losing none of the rasping edge or willingness to experiment, they’ve cleverly managed to round off some the angular make up of the earlier stuff. After six years honing their music and solid years of touring, everything sounds more considered, the overall effect feels more complete and the hooks in the songs are coming through cleaner.\n\nIf you haven’t heard them yet, the most obvious comparison would have to be Canadian electroclash pioneer Peaches, an undoubted influence that can be heard so clearly on the title track, with its twisted synth bass rumble, techno tweaks and direct acerbic vocals from Annie Dorrett. Otherwise it’s pretty difficult to pin them down, they appear to be at their happiest when breaking free of any preconceived form. The songs are obliterating the boundaries, constantly writhing and struggling free to do something new. Tracksuite’s pick ‘Desire / 1 on 1’ is an industrial pounder that comes in with a techno build before breaking into a mosh pit stomp. ‘M.U.T.M’ feels like St Vincent in a particularly abrasive mood with an abstract electronica backdrop, effected guitar chops and typically provocational vocals. ‘Cake 4 The Women’ bops a casual groove before quickly double timing with huge guitar punch and offbeat jagged sonic stabs. The most interesting new elements are when they pitch things down. ‘The Door’ is an intriguing minute and a half of nostalgic early days electronica. ‘Easier Than This’ has an 80s Kate Bush tint with contemporary indie sensibility. The almost shoegazey downbeat reflective ‘I See My Body Through You’ has a very cinematic feel, highly contrasting a swirling dreamscape sound with visceral Rage Against The Machine like power riff sections.\n\nCLT DRP clearly have the talent and ambition for success but, perhaps most importantly, they have that edge that will let them continue to shake things up and carve out a singular path on the way. Always challenging the audience, while never failing to rock the show, makes them one of the most exciting bands out there.\n\nThe final album in this year’s best album list isn’t actually technically an album, ‘2 Ruff Vol 1’ by Chase and Status, released on Nov 10, is in fact (and according to the artists themselves), a mixtape. I don’t really know why, I can’t even remember when collections of songs sold and presented in bundles started being called mixtapes so I must have missed that meeting. To my ears, it sounds like an album, so we’ll move ahead on that basis.\n\nChase & Status have already provided us with a two-word review of their latest release;“Absolutely nasty!” and although that essentially nails it, I will try and pad it out a little. The first thing that hits is a very welcome return to earlier career form of purer roots based bangers and almost none of the glitzier mid career pop edged anthems. Since 2019 and the aptly named ‘Rtrn II Jungle’, the London duo of Saul Milton (Chase) and Will Kennard (Status) have done just that and for it we are thankful. It can never be an easy decision for any artist to make, to pass on the privilege and wealth that must come from serious pop success and instead, jump back into the fire of the edgy drum and bass scene. But thankfully they have and they have done so proving why they are now stepping up to the plate as elder statesmen of the scene. This album, full to the brim with MC vocal talent, is a cranked up bunch of top rate ‘absolutely nasty’ killer tunes. I guess the only downside and possibly one of the reasons for calling it a mixtape, as well as the ‘Vol 1’ giveaway, is the ‘shorter than album length’ of just under 35 mins. But these tracks will live mostly outside this album, with extended mixes and club remixes. Besides, quality is quality, and not once here does that quality drop. So it’s difficult to pick highlights here, and so if filthy but perfectly produced weaponised drum and bass is your thing this is a must listen. The opener ‘Selecta’ feat Stefflon Don immediately plants the flag of what they want this music to be, and that’s dank stacked boiler room intensive chaos. It continues as planned with the brilliant ‘Liquor and Cigarettes’ feat Hedex and Arrdee.\n\nOn Tracksuite’s best of year playlist is the lead track and dancehall mega hit ‘Baddadan’ which features regular collaborators Irah, Flowdan, Trigga and Takura, a dark, fiery, infectious hardcore gem that proudly exemplifies the glory of the genre. This regeneration of Chase and Status has actually managed to wind back the stylist clock while simultaneously slingshotting their return to mainstream success, this time bringing the scene and all the talent with them.\n\nThe first of three albums in the list with the word ‘problems’ in the title. Possibly reflective of the state of things post covid or possibly just entirely coincidental. Anyway, it tells much about my age that an album of this ferocity has failed to garner much of my interest in recent years. I think I’ve started to feel that intense hardcore noise music just struggles to deliver enough variety for my aural pallet, in both emotive range and musical style. The message doesn’t get through anymore. Then Soul Glo decided to up their game considerably and produce a major label debut that is bigger and braver in all the ways I needed it to be. Don’t get me wrong, these songs are as fierce as ever, but there’s maturity and depth at play. There’s always been a creative edge to their work but here it feels like they’ve given themselves enough space to really plough the psychological depths and push into those screeching high ends, while the band take the opportunity to really flex. One of the biggest tracks is the warning call ‘Jump!! (Or Get Jumped!!!)((by the future))’, an awesome high octane track of brain bleeding force and lyrical prowess and the perfect gateway into the album. They then slow it right down to more of a standard rap music pace for the next release but no less abrasive ‘Driponomics’ featuring the absolute class of Mother Maryrose on the verse. The stand out for Tracksuite has got to be the incredible closer ‘Spiritual Level of Gang Shit’. A steady builder that starts with the feel of performance poetry on a bass bed but then comes in with a mighty boom bap groove featuring the skills of McKinley Dixon and Lojii. Then right on queue kicks on to a double time and Pierce Jordan lays in with the screamo. And just when you think you’ve got the band and this track figured, Soul Glo bring in the horns! Both the song and the album play out with the track title sung on repeat to a riff that sounds almost like the end credits to an epic spaghetti western. It is nothing short of glorious.\n\nAnd to rap things up (Ha! Had to get at least one dad joke in), third studio album by London rapper Benjamin Gerard Coyle-Larner (who performs as Loyle Carner) has taken a huge leap forward in production maturity, songwriting craft and introspective depth. There were glints of Carner’s genius on his first two records with ‘Yesterday’ and ‘Stars and Shards’ shining out on his debut ‘Yesterday’s Gone’ and 'Ottolenghi (feat Jordan Rakei)’ and ‘Loose Ends (feat Jorja Smith) showing off an ability to skilfully lean towards contemporary jazz soul on the follow up ‘Not Waving, but Drowning’. Now with ‘Hugo’ he has found his full strength, returning to an old school sound at times that first flexed on his earlier ‘A Little Late’ EP but also keeping things chill with a lighter creative touch in trickling beats and soft keys. He clashes this sound with some of the harshest spat vitriol at those who have wronged him and the combination of these seemingly opposing forces in the sound are what give it its potency. The first single ‘Hate’ gave a clear announcement of his intentions to step back into the limelight before the album dropped. Although it doesn’t shy away from throwing verbal attack on those deserving, it’s a bit of a deceptive title, as it ends throwing grace on all those equally deserving. The Observer said ‘Like Michael Kiwanuka, Carner’s first two albums were occasionally terrific but his third is a masterpiece.’ Strong words that Tracksuite can't argue against. Tracks like ‘Georgetown’ and ‘Speed of Plight’ kick furiously while feeling suitably reflexive. ‘Homerton’ and ‘Blood on My Nikes’ are pure RnB beauty. All tracks feel intrinsically Carner while all the time nodding in respect to past greats. Tracksuite’s choice for the playlist is the soaring ‘Nobody Knows (Ladas Road)’. The Line of Best Fit said ‘A clear cut statement on what it feels like to be alive in these troubling times from an artist who is carefully cementing himself as one of the most compelling and earnest young talents.’ What filters through on all of Carner’s music, despite the frustration and animosity, is this man’s capacity for love. He appears not as a character playing a part, like a lot can in this genre with bravado in place of bravery, but as bluntly truthful with all the frailties and all the charm of the human condition. Like all of the music on this list, at the heart of it all is its heart and I can’t think of a more apt finishing sentiment.\n\nHey, you’ll never guess who’s at the door - 2022! What?! At this hour?! But we’re only half way…etc etc. Still reeling from the heavy blow to the head that was 2020 and all the symptoms that came with that concussion, we’ve barely recalibrated our thoughts into facing forwards again and the world is winding up to throw yet another year at us. Why are we even bothered to go back outside again? Oh yeah - Gigs! Gigs are back - Whoop! But now there’s a new variant. Eek. And that variant has a ‘stealth’ strain. confused.com, I want to support music, support society and community, find a way to break the shackles and not just exist but really live alongside covid. But I still want to keep myself and my loved ones alive. We still have a long way to go. Some live music has been experienced with understandable hesitancy but pleasingly fulfilling results. It will continue to be to some degree, at considered pace but there’s no hurry. I appreciate that’s possibly easy to say from someone who doesn’t rely on live music for his existence but I come from the school of thought that favours small positive steps forward rather than risk another entire shutdown and further loss of possible future talent that would be all of our loss.\n\nThere’s always new music but I’m sure it’s not just me that’s aware of the hit of destruction from the last two years. Covid has cut a violent and scathing blow to the music industry and the productivity can be felt this year. We mourn the loss of so much that could’ve been.\n\nThat said, there has been undoubted quality. And here at Tracksuite we are enormously grateful and cheered by that. Here’s our list of ten top selected albums for 2021\n\nSturgill Simpson - The Ballad of Dood & Juanita\n\nWe made it! December has finally arrived and 2020 nears its end. But despite everything, once again our hats are off to the frontline musicians, artists and players who’ve saved our lives by soundtracking the silver lining to this horror show of a year. This year’s playlist is a demonstration that quality music is still being made and it’s a testament to both the resilience of artists to produce in extreme circumstances as well as the all encompassing nature of the art itself. It’s time now to take stock of what we have and really celebrate the best of what this year has brought us.\n\nBut first, please allow me this platform to address an unsettling situation for the music industry. There’s unlikely been a tougher year in living memory for musicians. Since the onslaught of streaming, the live scene has been long recognised as the financial saving grace for artists, a means to recoup what decreasing physical sales have taken away. Now this year, that has been taken away too. Having a knock on effect, of course, to all road crew, venue staff and the many others who rely on the live music network for employment. Without the live music financial stream, the structure that is supposed to sustain the industry is crumbling, the ability to produce is being stretched to breaking and there is real danger of cutting off the well of music that we all need to drink from.\n\nPetitions and legal bids are ongoing against streaming services to look again at their policies and readdress the balance for fair remuneration, but the creatives whose work enriches all of our lives are still losing out. As thousands of online groups scream for the return of live music and copious hashtags fight for the right to party, the makers of the music are literally going hungry and the future of an art form that means so much and respected so little is at real threat of disappearing. Yes, if you have shelter, be appreciative. Yes, if you have food, recognise that. Yes, if you have loved ones, cherish them. But also, if you like music, make sure you buy some. Don’t cash in your cancelled gig tickets, instead book more ahead to help ensure its survival. Look out for the brilliant fundraising project Whole Lotta Roadies, released on 18th December. A compilation by Rod Jones of Idlewild of covers by road crews to raise money for road crews, featuring the likes of The Rezillos, Arab Strap and The Proclaimers lending their vocal talents to their own covers.\n\nI grant you it’s an arguably hypocritical statement from a playlist blog that uses free streaming services but most of the industry now agree that the establishing of streaming platforms has now gone so far as to make withdrawing them a bigger risk to the majority of acts. Many bands and artists still need that platform to highlight their work but the longer they are taken advantage of and not recognised as the primary reason for the overall success of it all, the sooner production will slow and art will dry up. Not all of it of course, those whose tastes are limited to major label pop dictation will probably be forever catered for and so can continue to want only for what they are given. But if your capacity lies anywhere beyond that then you are truly obligated to invest.\n\nSo here’s Tracksuite’s take on the top 50 tunes of the past year. As always, it comes in hand crafted playlist form. The vast majority of these artists are emergent and indie crafts people who have unlikely yet bought their first yacht. They are the ones aforementioned, struggling to make ends meet and find the parity between the level of quality in their art and in their bank account. So, please proceed to enjoy the genius on show but remember to delve deeper and cough up where you can.\n\nDig in. Best Albums of 2020 coming soon…\n\nLove and Hope\n\nD@Tracksuite\n\nLankum – The Livelong Day\n\nIn the autumn of 2017 I heard the opening song ‘What Will We Do When We have No Money?’ from the album ‘Beneath the Earth and Sky’ by Lankum (formerly Lynched) the self described Dublin folk miscreants. Instantly I heard the sound of what folk music could, and arguably, should be. In this same blog of that year, I described how the song on first listen made me cry and has done on every listen since. What I failed to clarify was why. It wasn’t because of any saccharine sentiment but simply because it had sheer weight of power. The music seemed to channel the souls of people long since dead who suffered under the weight of this world but yet who bore their burden steadfastly. That power and strength is for me, what lies at the heart of Lankum’s music. The new album ‘The Livelong Day’ released in October on Rough Trade continues reinterpreting folk music of the past but again, as with all they’ve ever done, nothing sounds like the treading of familiar ground. You may think there’s no new way to go with the well frequented folk staple ‘The Wild Rover’ but well into the full 10 min album track version (the video below is shortened, seek out the album version), all has changed and the instrumental torment that closes the track just may have you questioning your own sanity and may have nudged you from whatever soft safety you thought you had before you started listening. I knew immediately it had to be the closing track for Tracksuite’s Best Tracks of 2019 playlist, which will be coming soon. It was between that and the gorgeous ‘The Dark Eyed Gypsy’, a story of hard fought love played at such a sluggishly slow pace that would be usually unbearable but which Lankum have truly mastered as the means to the message. Jude Rogers wrote in The Guardian ‘Nothing less than a thorough exploration and devastation of folk’s most conventional tropes is Lankum’s impressive game.’\n\nAs half time for 2019 approaches, let’s do what is expected of every music based website on the face of the internet and look back at our favourite releases of the year so far – and because we’re Tracksuite, you get a playlist.\n\nLike an old school M.C, - let’s break it down.\n\nFirst up, the opening track from one of the earliest releases of the year, ‘Midnight Monsoon’ by Subjective, the new collaborative project from Goldie and James Davidson and their album ‘Act One: Music for Inanimate Objects’. The Line of Best Fit describes how the ‘Sweeping strings and shuffling percussion soften the pounding kick drum’ as this track establishes the quality ambient work to come. Then another album opener, ‘Feet’ from Peckham alt rock outfit Fat White Family, who’ve seen a surge in 2019 off the back of their new album Serf’s Up! Skinny said – ‘Lead single ‘Feet’ is the group’s statement of intent: a sprawling, decaying disco track that puts up a united front.’ Followed swiftly by the return of The Twilight Sad on mighty form with ‘VTr’ from the album ‘It Won/t Be Like This All The Time’ – NME said “it’s a track as driven by change and hope as it is loaded with sadness’. Kicking on from this with ‘Woman’ from another new collaboration by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and American producer Danger Mouse from the album ‘Lux Prima’ released in March. Also released in March was the album ‘On The Line’ by indomitable country rock singer songwriter Jenny Lewis and the incredible track ‘Red Bull and Hennessy’ – Rolling Stone said ‘The singer channels the groove of Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” throughout “Red Bull & Hennessy,” crooning over a steady, two-note bassline, rippling tremolo guitars and chiming piano melodies.’ The playlist breaks free from the guitars and takes up the beats with the standout track ‘Afrika’ from new DJ Yoda album ‘Home Cooking’, then follows with two back to back legendary returns – first from Chaka Khan with the utter groove monster ‘Like Sugar’ from ‘Hello Happiness’, her first album in 11 years and then ‘B.L.M’ from new album ‘Encore’ by The Specials, their first studio album of new material in over 20 years. This politically charged track NME describes ‘finds Lynval Golding telling the story of his father arriving in the UK on the Windrush to help rebuild a war-torn Britain, and his own experiences of racism in the UK and America’. The beat sticks with French producer Yuksek and fresh disco fire in ‘I Don’t Have A Drum Machine’ and steps up again from English DJ producer John Ford aka Joyryde with the epic hard house mixer upper ‘I’m Gone’. Tracksuite would very much love to hear more big tunes take this alt route in future.\n\nChanging direction a little after the first third of the mix with ‘Sugar Mama’ from the haunting genius of multidisciplinary performing artist Dua Saleh from the ‘Nur’ EP, the earliest release in the mix from January 3rdon Against Giants. Continuing to bring you down smoothly with the stretch sound of third generation mardi gras Indian chief Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah and the title track from his new album ‘Ancestral Recall’ feat Saul Williams. Then the electronic nu-jazz sound of Ninja Tune’s Cinematic Orchestra and ‘A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life feat. the unmistakable tones of Rodney Smith, aka Roots Manuva from their fifth album ‘To Believe’. The wheel then turns again as we follow on with the highly stylised and impossible to compartmentalise alt country sound of Canadian musician Orville Peck – who Loud and Quiet says ‘His rich, crooning tenor is heavily reminiscent of Roy Orbison being appropriated by David Lynch’. The Line of Best Fit says ‘album opener \"Dead of Night\" is held around a faint percussive tambourine rattlesnake and a solitary allure. As Peck’s lustrous voice swills effortlessly into the intonated croon of Chris Isaak, you can hear the Nevada desert’s incompatibility to young, same-sex love.’ We stay in alt country territory with Sweden’s Daniel Norgren from his release ‘Wooh Dang’ and the affirming ballad ‘The Power’. Then troubled and reformed trio Ohtis with the brilliant ‘Runnin’ from their album ‘Curve of Earth’ – The Line of Best Fit again says “Runnin” shows Ohtis not in a state of disarray despite the track’s content, but rather a group with razor-sharp focus, simply conscious of how things once were.’ Roseanne Reid follows on with ‘Levi’ from one of Tracksuite’s favourite albums of the year, her debut ‘Trails’ – an incredibly mature and accomplished collection of tracks that lays the foundation for a must follow career. Another of Tracksuite’s favourite all time female vocalists Naomi Bedford along with partner in life and music Paul Simmonds reworking again the fantastic old folk ballad ‘Matty Groves’ that she first did on her Bluebirds EP in 2012. Then back on the country tip with some pure good old boy sound from Logan Ledger and ‘Starlight’, one of two taster songs dropped ahead of the release of his debut album due in the autumn. Legendary Americana producer T Bone Burnett describes his first impression of Ledger; ‘He had, and has, a voice filled with history. I could hear echoes of one great singer after another in his tone’. Sticking with the old country sound on ‘Flint City Shake It’, a highly infectious shit kicker from Justin Townes Earle on the album ‘The Saint of Lost Causes’.\n\nAnother change of gear into the final third with another best album of the year contender in the aptly named ‘My Finest Work Yet’ by Andrew Bird. AV Club said ‘Tracks like “Olympians” … a full-throated sing-along that wouldn’t be out of place in a Beatles tune like “All You Need Is Love.” Then the opener ‘Change’ off the fourteenth studio album by American rhythm blues and gospel queen Mavis Staples sets up the force of nature that is North Carolina’s Resse McHenry and the blistering passion fuelled ‘Detroit’ from her astounding album ‘No Dados’. Another voice loaded with greats of the past is American soul singer `Kelly Finnigan who stokes the fire with ‘I Called You Back Baby’. Charging on with ‘Who’ by German electronic duo Modeselektor feat . Estonian rapper and artist Tommy Cash. Clash Mag described it as ‘Frantic but without sacrificing melody, 'Who' feels like a dance-rap masterpiece from an alternate dimension.’ Chase and Status returned recently with their new album ‘RTRN II JUNGLE’, a blazing homage to their drum and bass, jungle music roots that feels truthful and fresh in equal measure. Hard to pick a favourite but right now its ‘Program’. Carrying the pace and energy straight into ‘Summon the Fire’ by The Comet is Coming – Shabaka Hutchings continuing to rule with another fine selection of huge jazz gems. Taking the baton, Dublin post punks Fontaines D.C. with ‘Hurricane Laughter’ from their debut album ‘Dogrel’ – DIY Mag says ‘its verses full of stream-of-consciousness intrigue before building to a moshpit-inducing, shout-along inclusive chorus’. Now screaming up the final straight with Gothenburg’s Westkust with the opener ‘Swebeach’ from their new self titled album. Nothing But Hope and Passion said of it, ‘Swebeach is shoegaze direct-injected with rocket fuel, a great wall of scorching, abrasive guitar sound cut through with Julia Bjernelind’s vocal, melody that stands its ground through the musical storm’. And finally, taking us over the finishing line, Tracksuite faves from Denver, The Yawpers and ‘Forgiveness Through Pain’, that Popmatters also picked as an album highlight saying, ‘Parmet's thunderous guitar overtakes Cook's bluesy noodling in the opening of \"Forgiveness Through Pain\", driven maddeningly forward by Koshak's drums and Cook's white-boy jive vocals (the best I've heard this side of Steven Tyler at his peak)’.\n\nAnd that be the playlist – get around it. Tracksuite abides.\n\nSons of Kemet – Your Queen is a Reptile\n\nReleased in March on Impulse under the Verve Records banner, the 3rd album from the London jazz frontiersmen.\n\nA super-group of sorts led by clarinetist, saxophonist and composer Shabaka Hutchings (a man whose star has continued in ascendence over the last few years as part of various outfits such as Melt Yourself Down Shabaka and The Ancestors Sons of Kemet The Comet is Coming and more…) with Oren Marshall on tuba and both Tom Skinner and Seb Rochford on drums.\n\nThe Mercury Music Prize was stolen from them earlier this year, an absolute travesty of justice proven by their topping The Wire magazine's annual critics' poll.\n\nThe album title is a no holds barred message challenging listeners to contemplate the ongoing lack of racial equality in the country and the world in 2018. It invites us to consider great black activist figures of the past, going direct for the jugular with a direct hit to reference Johnny Rotten by attacking the supposed figurehead. Tracksuite pick ‘My Queen is Harriet Tubman’ references the infamous former slave turned freedom fighter, soldier then activist for black rights and woman’s suffrage, a woman who has become an icon of courage and freedom. Spin magazine says: ‘“My Queen Is Harriet Tubman” opens with a flurry of percussion that does not abate for the next five minutes, a dazzling indicator of Sons of Kemet’s musical loyalties, which lie with rhythm above all else. The white-knuckled drumming contains traces of Trinidadian soca, Jamaican dancehall, London grime, New Orleans second line bands—channeling a multi-continental and -generational legacy that has survived in the face of oppression across the globe.’\n\n‘An immaculately conceived record, the latest from Sons of Kemet is proof that British jazz is alive and well and, even beyond that, may be one of the best cultural tools we have in fighting the oppressive and deeply troubling political landscape that appears to be forming in the west, of late’ – Under The Radar\n\n‘The richness of the source material and the deftness of interplay of each member of the band ensures that Your Queen is a Reptile leaves you with a sense of having been a part of something truly special’ – The Line of Best Fit.\n\n‘Your Queen Is A Reptile, is 55 minutes of ecstatic insurgency’ – Exclaim\n\nIdles – Joy as an Act of Resistance\n\nJoy as an Act of Resistance is the second album by Bristol band Idles, released in August 2018.\n\nJordan Bassett, reviewing the album for NME, awarded the album five stars, calling it \"an instant classic\"\n\n\"Britain’s most necessary band\" – The Guardian\n\n‘everything anyone could have wanted or expected it to be: Idles have released the most relevant and at times gut wrenching album of the year.’ – Drowned In Sound\n\n\"a heart-breaking but jubilant exploration of joy, honesty, fragility and expression as our most powerful means of human resistance” – Classic Rock mag\n\n\"an album that manages to combine grief, self-loathing and a realisation that life’s better played honest, with a fine-tuned, brutal sound: something like bent sheet metal being hammered straight” – Record Collector\n\nSinger Joseph Talbot stated \"This album is an attempt to be vulnerable to our audience and to encourage vulnerability; a brave naked smile in this shitty new world.\"\n\nSnarling, angry, abrasive punk noise but with no lack of humour, includes a cover version of Solomon Burkes ‘Cry To me’ and certainly not designed for the low brow. There’s wit and wisdom in spades, aiming directly at targets like backward political sensibilities, toxic masculinity and racism. Tracksuite picked out ‘Danny Nedelko’ for the playlist but despite some critics calling the album too samey, its jammed with typical Idles brilliance; the anti brexit anthem ‘Great’, the raw edged ‘Colossus’ and the hilarious ‘Never Fight a Man with a Perm’.\n\n‘Across its 40-odd minutes, Joy As An Act of Resistance makes you want to laugh and cry and roar into the wind and cradle your nearest and dearest. It is a beautiful slice of humanity delivered by a group of men whose vulnerability and heart has become a guiding light in the fog for an increasing community of fans who don’t just want, but need this.’ – DIY"
