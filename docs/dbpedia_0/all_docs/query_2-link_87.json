The rest of us discussed this and were happy to see that we all felt that there's no way we're stopping now. We've worked too hard to get where we are, and we enjoy playing together, so why would we give it all up?

Anyway back in the day when we were 5 guys in a garage playing our hearts out every Tuesday and Thursday in Whittier, CA getting ready for what was hopefully to come. I wrote the lyrics from a place of wonder and curiosity of what it's gonna be like to be gone for months at a time and not be able to see my family and friends on a daily basis. So I called it \"Future\" because hopefully that is where we were headed and hear we are, which is very cool by the way.\n\nHear what it's all about, learn more about the band and the CD, plus find out where you can see them live.
