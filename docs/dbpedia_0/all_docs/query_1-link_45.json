        "text": "One year since you, Dix. Dixie Chick of Shadowland White. Dixalicious. Chunk with the Junk in Her Trunk. My Snuggleupagus.\n\nI still miss you every every every day, especially when I’m walking home after work. I used to get home and launch into a frustrated rant about work or slow walkers or silent filibusters. You’d sit at my feet, shifting back and forth, if necessary, as I paced, twitching the very tip of your tail hopefully, like you always did. When you got impatient, you’d put your paw up on my knee, like, “excuse me, down here, hi, hi, hello!” I’d finally get the message, and I’d kneel down to greet you and instantly forget all my troubles.\n\nWhen I scratched your ears, rubbed your belly, or snuggled your scruff, your comfort and happiness comforted me and made me happy. I believe you knew that, and that you felt the same way.\n\nI loved knowingâ€”usuallyâ€”what you needed from me, and that I could provide it. And you could always give back what I needed most from you. Could you read my mind and know what I was feeling? I’m not entirely sure about that. I think it just worked out that what was best for you was best for me; that’s enough for me to know that our bond was specialâ€”honest, generous, affectionate, and loyal.\n\nI’ve faced some tough times in the last year. When I’m sad, sick, or tired, I miss you terribly. When I can’t sleep or concentrate, I remember your thunderous snoring and the insistent, reassuring press of your forehead, chin, or rump against me. When I feel weak or hopeless, I remember your steady gait and your patient gaze. But I also miss you when I’m happiest, because feeling safe, peaceful, or loved always reminds me of you.\n\nA few fantastic things have come my way this year, tooâ€”four of them are other Shadowland labs, including your granddaughter, Birdie Balderdash!\n\nIda Run-A-Muck & Birdie “The Bird” Balderdash of Shadowland,Â November 2015\n\nYour wonderful pawrents Karen and Craig have sent Birdie, along with young ladies named Ida, Sally, and Shirley, toÂ visit me, and Mom and Dad, for sleepover weekends when we’ve needed some labrador love in the house.\n\nSisters (yes, littermates!) Sally and Shirley of Shadowland,Â February 2016\n\nShadowland is in very good paws with those girls! We feel so lucky to be part of the extended Shadowland family, thanks to you. Karen and Craig adored you; I’m so grateful that they shared you with me.\n\nRight after you died, I worried a lot about where you might be and if you were okay there. It tore up my heart to think about you being somewhere unfamiliar, not sure what to do, lonely, waiting for me, and wondering why I didn’t come. On bad days, I felt so guilty, angry, helpless, and sad that I looked forward to the “good” days when just the sadness, on its own, felt tolerable. A year later, I think I’ve finally come to believe that wherever you are, you’re safe and content, and comfortable enough to roll belly-up when you’re dreaming. Now, I’m just hoping I get to be with you again someday,Â there, wherever there is. I know you’ll wait for me.\n\nIt’s been a very warm March week, the kind of days you would have liked to spending lying on the deck, baking in the sun. Even before it registered that this anniversary was approaching so quickly, I’d found myself thinking about how much you loved to do that and wishing you were here to enjoy this weather. Making you happy was not only a delight, but a point of pride! I hadn’t grasped that facet of love so thoroughly until I loved you; you probably understood it all along.\n\nSo, wherever you are, know that I’m thinking about you, which is kind of like petting you with my mind. Thank you for being my best friend. I promise that I’m okay and I’m ready to love another dog full-time, just as soon as I’m allowed to bring one home! I’m so proud of you for overcoming your fear of cutlery and for becoming the Dog of the House after Maggie was gone. You did a great job looking after Mom and Dad. Please say ‘hi’ to Maggie for me. You’re a good, good girl. I love you, Dix.\n\nAlways,\n\nYour Girl, Emily\n\nMy eleven favorite 2011 releases\n\nTurning Tables, Adele\n\nNext time I’ll be braver /Â I’ll be my own savior /Â When the thunder calls for me\n\nHelplessness Blues, Fleet Foxes\n\nYeah, Iâ€™m tongue-tied and dizzy and I canâ€™t keep it to myself Â /Â What good is it to sing helplessness blues; why should I wait for anyone else?\n\nDon’t Turn Out the Lights (D.T.O.T.L.), NKOTBSB\n\nI still got this fire for you, we can get it back again / If you donâ€™t say that itâ€™s the end (the end)\n\nShake it Out, Florence and the Machine\n\nAnd I am done with my graceless heart / So tonight I’m gonna cut it out and then restart\n\nSorry 4 the Wait, Lil Wayne\n\nHello, goodbye, where are you Wayne?

I found it on the wrong rackâ€”a petite size far from the petite sectionâ€”and it was marked down so far that I knew it was the last one of its kind.Â But, it was a size up from what I normally wear and the petite size conversion rule turned out to be true!Â At the three-way mirror in the fitting room, I had to use a clothes hanger to fend off a few admirers who would have stripped the garment from my body for themselves.Â I escaped with the dress and I’m so excited to finally wear it!Â Maggy London’s Fall 2009 collection is online here.\n\nCan a girl go wrong with Tiffany?Â Of course not.Â I don’t think the silver beads get enough play.Â They’re darling; the fine metal equivalent of pearls.Â The bracelet was a gift in high school; the earrings were a little gift to myself after I got my second job.\n\nI detest heels.Â Really.Â Partly on principle, but mostly because they hurt me.Â But my Maid of Honor dress at Jill’s wedding in July was tea length, and I couldn’t get away with silver Birkenstocks in the church anyway, so I picked out this pair of sandals from Naturalizer’s N5 Comfort Elements collection.Â These heels are amaaaaazing.Â I made it down the aisle and back and through a night of dancing with the under-10 crowd at the wedding in these shoes, and in the morning, when I went back to the hotel to pick up Jill’s dress, I put them back on, just for kicks.Â I think it was clear, when I walked into the hotel dining room that morning in a commemorative t-shirt from the 1984 Olympic games, madras shorts and silver heels, that my principles were out the window.\n\nThank you, Grandmom, for outfitting me with such an extensive dress-up collection when I was a little girl.Â Thank you, too, for including items that could translate from pink plastic dress-up suitcase to special occasions in my adult life!Â I’ve always loved the snap that this faux leather clutch makes when it’s snapped shut.Â I’ll have to resist opening and closing it throughout the wedding ceremony.\n\nI found this lovely violet silk flower among many effortlessly enchanting floral accessories in an Etsy shop called East End Home Arts.Â I browsed the heck out of Etsy on a quest for silk flowers, and the selection in Suzy’s shop is unique, feminine, and affordable.Â Her customer service is fantastic, too.Â I my first order with her (for one of these peach cosmos) on the night before she gave birth to her first baby, and the new mom still managed to deliver within a week.Â She told me that custom orders are her favorites to work on, so if you’re in the “flowers in your hair” mood, get in touch with her.Â And if you’re not in the “flowers in your hair” mood, please take a good hard look at yourself and get back to me when you’ve sorted yourself out.\n\nI’m ready to get dressed for this wedding now.Â Where is my pink plastic dress-up suitcase?"
