        "text": "Aging has a profound and devastating effect on the brain. Old age is accompanied by declining cognitive function and enhanced risk of brain diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. A key question is whether cells with regenerative potential contribute to brain health and even brain “rejuvenation.” This review discusses mechanisms that regulate neural stem cells (NSCs) during aging, focusing on the effect of metabolism, genetic regulation, and the surrounding niche. We also explore emerging rejuvenating strategies for old NSCs. Finally, we consider how new technologies may help harness NSCs’ potential to restore healthy brain function during physiological and pathological aging.\n\nMain Text\n\nIntroduction\n\nMore than any other organ, the brain feels central to us for its ability to coordinate higher-order cognitive functions. But brain function deteriorates with age. In parallel, neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases) and brain cancers (e.g., gliomas) surge in the elderly population. Although all cell types in the brain are affected during aging and could contribute to physiological decline and disease, resident neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain have the potential to generate new neurons (neurogenesis) and regenerate aspects of brain function. Thus, maintaining a healthy stem cell pool in the brain throughout aging could be critical to improve overall brain health and reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.\n\nThe adult mammalian brain contains two primary reservoirs of regenerative NSCs (known as “neurogenic niches”): the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (Figure 1;\n\nBond et al., 2015\n\nBond A.M.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nAdult Mammalian Neural Stem Cells and Neurogenesis: Five Decades Later.\n\n;\n\nSilva-Vargas et al., 2013\n\nSilva-Vargas V.\n\nCrouch E.E.\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nAdult neural stem cells and their niche: a dynamic duo during homeostasis, regeneration, and aging.\n\n). A third pool of NSCs has been reported more recently in the hypothalamus (\n\nBolborea and Dale, 2013\n\nBolborea M.\n\nDale N.\n\nHypothalamic tanycytes: potential roles in the control of feeding and energy balance.\n\n;\n\nPellegrino et al., 2018\n\nPellegrino G.\n\nTrubert C.\n\nTerrien J.\n\nPifferi F.\n\nLeroy D.\n\nLoyens A.\n\nMigaud M.\n\nBaroncini M.\n\nMaurage C.A.\n\nFontaine C.\n\net al.\n\nA comparative study of the neural stem cell niche in the adult hypothalamus of human, mouse, rat and gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus).\n\n). This review will primarily focus on the SVZ and hippocampal neurogenic niches but will also discuss specific results from NSCs in the hypothalamus. Neurogenic niches are specialized microenvironments comprising a variety of different cell types, including cells from the NSC lineage, but also endothelial cells (blood vessels) and microglia (\n\nAimone et al., 2014\n\nAimone J.B.\n\nLi Y.\n\nLee S.W.\n\nClemenson G.D.\n\nDeng W.\n\nGage F.H.\n\nRegulation and function of adult neurogenesis: from genes to cognition.\n\n). The head of the NSC lineage consists of quiescent NSCs (qNSCs), which are normally dormant but can be activated to generate proliferating NSCs. Activated NSCs (aNSCs), in turn, give rise to neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which have the potential to differentiate primarily into new neurons, and, in smaller proportions, into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (\n\nBond et al., 2015\n\nBond A.M.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nAdult Mammalian Neural Stem Cells and Neurogenesis: Five Decades Later.\n\n). The SVZ and hippocampal neurogenic niches have similarities in their overall cellular composition and neurogenic potential. However, these reservoirs also exhibit differences in their turnover dynamics (symmetric versus asymmetric divisions;\n\nCalzolari et al., 2015\n\nCalzolari F.\n\nMichel J.\n\nBaumgart E.V.\n\nTheis F.\n\nGötz M.\n\nNinkovic J.\n\nFast clonal expansion and limited neural stem cell self-renewal in the adult subependymal zone.\n\n;\n\nEncinas et al., 2011\n\nEncinas J.M.\n\nMichurina T.V.\n\nPeunova N.\n\nPark J.H.\n\nTordo J.\n\nPeterson D.A.\n\nFishell G.\n\nKoulakov A.\n\nEnikolopov G.\n\nDivision-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.\n\n;\n\nObernier et al., 2018\n\nObernier K.\n\nCebrian-Silla A.\n\nThomson M.\n\nParraguez J.I.\n\nAnderson R.\n\nGuinto C.\n\nRodas Rodriguez J.\n\nGarcia-Verdugo J.M.\n\nAlvarez-Buylla A.\n\nAdult Neurogenesis Is Sustained by Symmetric Self-Renewal and Differentiation.\n\n), their ability to give rise to glia (oligodendrocytes versus astrocytes;\n\nBonaguidi et al., 2011\n\nBonaguidi M.A.\n\nWheeler M.A.\n\nShapiro J.S.\n\nStadel R.P.\n\nSun G.J.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nIn vivo clonal analysis reveals self-renewing and multipotent adult neural stem cell characteristics.\n\n;\n\nOrtega et al., 2013\n\nOrtega F.\n\nGascón S.\n\nMasserdotti G.\n\nDeshpande A.\n\nSimon C.\n\nFischer J.\n\nDimou L.\n\nChichung Lie D.\n\nSchroeder T.\n\nBerninger B.\n\nOligodendrogliogenic and neurogenic adult subependymal zone neural stem cells constitute distinct lineages and exhibit differential responsiveness to Wnt signalling.\n\n), and their contribution to brain function (\n\nAimone et al., 2014\n\nAimone J.B.\n\nLi Y.\n\nLee S.W.\n\nClemenson G.D.\n\nDeng W.\n\nGage F.H.\n\nRegulation and function of adult neurogenesis: from genes to cognition.\n\n;\n\nCorsini et al., 2009\n\nCorsini N.S.\n\nSancho-Martinez I.\n\nLaudenklos S.\n\nGlagow D.\n\nKumar S.\n\nLetellier E.\n\nKoch P.\n\nTeodorczyk M.\n\nKleber S.\n\nKlussmann S.\n\net al.\n\nThe death receptor CD95 activates adult neural stem cells for working memory formation and brain repair.\n\n;\n\nDupret et al., 2008\n\nDupret D.\n\nRevest J.M.\n\nKoehl M.\n\nIchas F.\n\nDe Giorgi F.\n\nCostet P.\n\nAbrous D.N.\n\nPiazza P.V.\n\nSpatial relational memory requires hippocampal adult neurogenesis.\n\n;\n\nGao et al., 2018\n\nGao A.\n\nXia F.\n\nGuskjolen A.J.\n\nRamsaran A.I.\n\nSantoro A.\n\nJosselyn S.A.\n\nFrankland P.W.\n\nElevation of Hippocampal Neurogenesis Induces a Temporally Graded Pattern of Forgetting of Contextual Fear Memories.\n\n;\n\nGheusi et al., 2000\n\nGheusi G.\n\nCremer H.\n\nMcLean H.\n\nChazal G.\n\nVincent J.D.\n\nLledo P.M.\n\nImportance of newly generated neurons in the adult olfactory bulb for odor discrimination.\n\n).\n\nIn the SVZ, NSCs are located within “pinwheel” structures and contact the brain’s vasculature and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lateral ventricle (\n\nMirzadeh et al., 2008\n\nMirzadeh Z.\n\nMerkle F.T.\n\nSoriano-Navarro M.\n\nGarcia-Verdugo J.M.\n\nAlvarez-Buylla A.\n\nNeural stem cells confer unique pinwheel architecture to the ventricular surface in neurogenic regions of the adult brain.\n\n;\n\nShen et al., 2008\n\nShen Q.\n\nWang Y.\n\nKokovay E.\n\nLin G.\n\nChuang S.M.\n\nGoderie S.K.\n\nRoysam B.\n\nTemple S.\n\nAdult SVZ stem cells lie in a vascular niche: a quantitative analysis of niche cell-cell interactions.\n\n;\n\nTavazoie et al., 2008\n\nTavazoie M.\n\nVan der Veken L.\n\nSilva-Vargas V.\n\nLouissaint M.\n\nColonna L.\n\nZaidi B.\n\nGarcia-Verdugo J.M.\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nA specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.\n\n). SVZ NSCs produce neuroblasts that migrate along the rostral migratory stream and generate new neurons in the olfactory bulb in rodents (\n\nDoetsch et al., 1997\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nGarcía-Verdugo J.M.\n\nAlvarez-Buylla A.\n\nCellular composition and three-dimensional organization of the subventricular germinal zone in the adult mammalian brain.\n\n;\n\nMizrahi et al., 2006\n\nMizrahi A.\n\nLu J.\n\nIrving R.\n\nFeng G.\n\nKatz L.C.\n\nIn vivo imaging of juxtaglomerular neuron turnover in the mouse olfactory bulb.\n\n) or incorporate into the striatum in humans (\n\nErnst et al., 2014\n\nErnst A.\n\nAlkass K.\n\nBernard S.\n\nSalehpour M.\n\nPerl S.\n\nTisdale J.\n\nPossnert G.\n\nDruid H.\n\nFrisén J.\n\nNeurogenesis in the striatum of the adult human brain.\n\n). SVZ neurogenesis is important for various olfactory functions in rodents, such as odor discrimination and olfactory learning and memory (\n\nBragado Alonso et al., 2019\n\nBragado Alonso S.\n\nReinert J.K.\n\nMarichal N.\n\nMassalini S.\n\nBerninger B.\n\nKuner T.\n\nCalegari F.\n\nAn increase in neural stem cells and olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis improves discrimination of highly similar odorants.\n\n;\n\nGheusi et al., 2000\n\nGheusi G.\n\nCremer H.\n\nMcLean H.\n\nChazal G.\n\nVincent J.D.\n\nLledo P.M.\n\nImportance of newly generated neurons in the adult olfactory bulb for odor discrimination.\n\n;\n\nSakamoto et al., 2011\n\nSakamoto M.\n\nImayoshi I.\n\nOhtsuka T.\n\nYamaguchi M.\n\nMori K.\n\nKageyama R.\n\nContinuous neurogenesis in the adult forebrain is required for innate olfactory responses.\n\n). Interestingly, SVZ NSCs can also be activated upon injury (e.g., stroke) to generate newborn neurons and astrocytes that can help to repair brain injury in mice (\n\nBenner et al., 2013\n\nBenner E.J.\n\nLuciano D.\n\nJo R.\n\nAbdi K.\n\nPaez-Gonzalez P.\n\nSheng H.\n\nWarner D.S.\n\nLiu C.\n\nEroglu C.\n\nKuo C.T.\n\nProtective astrogenesis from the SVZ niche after injury is controlled by Notch modulator Thbs4.\n\n;\n\nFaiz et al., 2015\n\nFaiz M.\n\nSachewsky N.\n\nGascón S.\n\nBang K.W.\n\nMorshead C.M.\n\nNagy A.\n\nAdult Neural Stem Cells from the Subventricular Zone Give Rise to Reactive Astrocytes in the Cortex after Stroke.\n\n;\n\nLi et al., 2010a\n\nLi L.\n\nHarms K.M.\n\nVentura P.B.\n\nLagace D.C.\n\nEisch A.J.\n\nCunningham L.A.\n\nFocal cerebral ischemia induces a multilineage cytogenic response from adult subventricular zone that is predominantly gliogenic.\n\n).\n\nIn the hippocampal niche, NSCs are located at the border of the inner granule cell layer in the DG, and they generate neuroblasts, which migrate along the subgranular zone to produce granule neurons (\n\nGage, 2002\n\nGage F.H.\n\nNeurogenesis in the adult brain.\n\n;\n\nMing and Song, 2011\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nAdult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain: significant answers and significant questions.\n\n;\n\nSun et al., 2015\n\nSun G.J.\n\nZhou Y.\n\nIto S.\n\nBonaguidi M.A.\n\nStein-O’Brien G.\n\nKawasaki N.K.\n\nModak N.\n\nZhu Y.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nLatent tri-lineage potential of adult hippocampal neural stem cells revealed by Nf1 inactivation.\n\n).

This decline likely involves a number of cellular processes, including increased NSC dormancy, decreased NSC self-renewal, a decline in neuronal fate commitment, and NSC death (\n\nEncinas et al., 2011\n\nEncinas J.M.\n\nMichurina T.V.\n\nPeunova N.\n\nPark J.H.\n\nTordo J.\n\nPeterson D.A.\n\nFishell G.\n\nKoulakov A.\n\nEnikolopov G.\n\nDivision-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.\n\n;\n\nObernier and Alvarez-Buylla, 2019\n\nObernier K.\n\nAlvarez-Buylla A.\n\nNeural stem cells: origin, heterogeneity and regulation in the adult mammalian brain.\n\n;\n\nUrbán et al., 2016\n\nUrbán N.\n\nvan den Berg D.L.\n\nForget A.\n\nAndersen J.\n\nDemmers J.A.\n\nHunt C.\n\nAyrault O.\n\nGuillemot F.\n\nReturn to quiescence of mouse neural stem cells by degradation of a proactivation protein.\n\n). The decrease in neurogenesis with age is accompanied by poorer performance on learning and memory tasks and reduced olfactory discrimination (\n\nEnwere et al., 2004\n\nEnwere E.\n\nShingo T.\n\nGregg C.\n\nFujikawa H.\n\nOhta S.\n\nWeiss S.\n\nAging results in reduced epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, diminished olfactory neurogenesis, and deficits in fine olfactory discrimination.\n\n;\n\nGage and Temple, 2013\n\nGage F.H.\n\nTemple S.\n\nNeural stem cells: generating and regenerating the brain.\n\n;\n\nMcAvoy et al., 2016\n\nMcAvoy K.M.\n\nScobie K.N.\n\nBerger S.\n\nRusso C.\n\nGuo N.\n\nDecharatanachart P.\n\nVega-Ramirez H.\n\nMiake-Lye S.\n\nWhalen M.\n\nNelson M.\n\net al.\n\nModulating Neuronal Competition Dynamics in the Dentate Gyrus to Rejuvenate Aging Memory Circuits.\n\n), suggesting that age-related NSC defects may have broad functional consequences. In humans, the decline in neurogenesis in elderly individuals has been associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases (\n\nMoreno-Jiménez et al., 2019\n\nMoreno-Jiménez E.P.\n\nFlor-García M.\n\nTerreros-Roncal J.\n\nRábano A.\n\nCafini F.\n\nPallas-Bazarra N.\n\nÁvila J.\n\nLlorens-Martín M.\n\nAdult hippocampal neurogenesis is abundant in neurologically healthy subjects and drops sharply in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n;\n\nTobin et al., 2019\n\nTobin M.K.\n\nMusaraca K.\n\nDisouky A.\n\nShetti A.\n\nBheri A.\n\nHoner W.G.\n\nKim N.\n\nDawe R.J.\n\nBennett D.A.\n\nArfanakis K.\n\net al.\n\nHuman Hippocampal Neurogenesis Persists in Aged Adults and Alzheimer’s Disease Patients.\n\n). Thus, key questions emerging in this field include the following. How do regenerative regions containing NSCs change over a lifespan? Do the various regenerative niches differ, or do they rely on similar mechanisms? Are the cells that divide in the old brain the same cells that had already divided and produced neurons in the younger brain? How can the regenerative potential of NSCs be leveraged to promote brain homeostasis and repair?\n\nIn this review, we discuss recently discovered mechanisms leading to the age-related decline in neurogenesis in vertebrates, focusing on intrinsic factors (e.g., metabolism and genetic regulation) and extrinsic factors from the niche (e.g., systemic factors and other cell types). We also review the connection between NSCs and brain diseases as well as emerging strategies to rescue NSC decline during aging. In addition, we speculate regarding the evolutionary role of vertebrate neurogenesis with a focus on human neurogenesis. Finally, we present how new technological advances could shape our understanding of NSC aging at the molecular, niche, brain, and organismal levels and provide new avenues to slow or potentially even reverse the age-dependent decline in neurogenesis.\n\nNutrient-Sensing Pathways, Metabolism, and Protein Homeostasis during NSC Aging\n\nNeurogenic niches are sensitive to changes in nutrient availability and signaling, including those occurring during aging. The various cell types in the niche have very different metabolic and protein homeostasis needs, depending on their state (e.g., qNSCs versus actively proliferating NSCs). In this section, we review recent evidence supporting the role of these processes in NSC aging and rejuvenation.\n\nNutrient-Sensing Pathways\n\nNutrient-sensing pathways, such as the insulin/insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1)-FOXO pathway, are key conserved regulators of aging (\n\nChantranupong et al., 2015\n\nChantranupong L.\n\nWolfson R.L.\n\nSabatini D.M.\n\nNutrient-sensing mechanisms across evolution.\n\n) and are also essential for NSC maintenance and function in the SVZ and DG. For example, early work revealed that loss of FOXO transcription factors (FOXOs), the downstream effectors of the insulin/IGF1 pathway, leads to premature exhaustion of the NSC pool (\n\nPaik et al., 2009\n\nPaik J.H.\n\nDing Z.\n\nNarurkar R.\n\nRamkissoon S.\n\nMuller F.\n\nKamoun W.S.\n\nChae S.S.\n\nZheng H.\n\nYing H.\n\nMahoney J.\n\net al.\n\nFoxOs cooperatively regulate diverse pathways governing neural stem cell homeostasis.\n\n;\n\nRenault et al., 2009\n\nRenault V.M.\n\nRafalski V.A.\n\nMorgan A.A.\n\nSalih D.A.\n\nBrett J.O.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nVilleda S.A.\n\nThekkat P.U.\n\nGuillerey C.\n\nDenko N.C.\n\net al.\n\nFoxO3 regulates neural stem cell homeostasis.\n\n;\n\nYeo et al., 2013\n\nYeo H.\n\nLyssiotis C.A.\n\nZhang Y.\n\nYing H.\n\nAsara J.M.\n\nCantley L.C.\n\nPaik J.H.\n\nFoxO3 coordinates metabolic pathways to maintain redox balance in neural stem cells.\n\n). Consistently, loss of the PTEN phosphatase (which is upstream of FOXO) also causes NSC depletion (\n\nBonaguidi et al., 2011\n\nBonaguidi M.A.\n\nWheeler M.A.\n\nShapiro J.S.\n\nStadel R.P.\n\nSun G.J.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nIn vivo clonal analysis reveals self-renewing and multipotent adult neural stem cell characteristics.\n\n), even when PTEN loss initially triggers NSC proliferation (\n\nGregorian et al., 2009\n\nGregorian C.\n\nNakashima J.\n\nLe Belle J.\n\nOhab J.\n\nKim R.\n\nLiu A.\n\nSmith K.B.\n\nGroszer M.\n\nGarcia A.D.\n\nSofroniew M.V.\n\net al.\n\nPten deletion in adult neural stem/progenitor cells enhances constitutive neurogenesis.\n\n). More recent work has shown that suppression of IGF1 signaling in young NSCs via IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) conditional knockout in vivo (which results in FOXO activation) improves neurogenesis in the SVZ, increases spine density in newborn neurons, and enhances olfactory learning (\n\nChaker et al., 2015\n\nChaker Z.\n\nAïd S.\n\nBerry H.\n\nHolzenberger M.\n\nSuppression of IGF-I signals in neural stem cells enhances neurogenesis and olfactory function during aging.\n\n). Together, these results indicate that suppressing insulin/IGF1 signaling (and, subsequently, activating FOXO) is beneficial for long-term maintenance of the NSC pool. Suppression of signaling pathways downstream of the insulin/IGF1 pathway, such as the mTOR pathway, are also likely to enhance NSC maintenance (see below). However, it is important to note that increased IGF1 signaling can be beneficial for neuronal function by promoting neuronal differentiation and organization during neurogenesis in the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb (\n\nHurtado-Chong et al., 2009\n\nHurtado-Chong A.\n\nYusta-Boyo M.J.\n\nVergaño-Vera E.\n\nBulfone A.\n\nde Pablo F.\n\nVicario-Abejón C.\n\nIGF-I promotes neuronal migration and positioning in the olfactory bulb and the exit of neuroblasts from the subventricular zone.\n\n;\n\nNieto-Estévez et al., 2016\n\nNieto-Estévez V.\n\nOueslati-Morales C.O.\n\nLi L.\n\nPickel J.\n\nMorales A.V.\n\nVicario-Abejón C.\n\nBrain Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I Directs the Transition from Stem Cells to Mature Neurons During Postnatal/Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.\n\n). Thus, alternating cycles of low and high insulin/IGF1 signaling might help maintain the stem cell pool while still allowing NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Indeed, cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet with ad libitum feeding, which periodically change the levels of insulin and IGF1, increase hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive performance in old mice (\n\nBrandhorst et al., 2015\n\nBrandhorst S.\n\nChoi I.Y.\n\nWei M.\n\nCheng C.W.\n\nSedrakyan S.\n\nNavarrete G.\n\nDubeau L.\n\nYap L.P.\n\nPark R.\n\nVinciguerra M.\n\net al.\n\nA Periodic Diet that Mimics Fasting Promotes Multi-System Regeneration, Enhanced Cognitive Performance, and Healthspan.\n\n).\n\nMitochondria\n\nMitochondria play a central role in maintaining NSC states during aging. Transcriptomic analysis of NSCs isolated from the SVZ or hippocampus revealed that qNSCs express genes involved in β-oxidation, which partly takes place in mitochondria, whereas aNSCs express genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n;\n\nShin et al., 2015\n\nShin J.\n\nBerg D.A.\n\nZhu Y.\n\nShin J.Y.\n\nSong J.\n\nBonaguidi M.A.\n\nEnikolopov G.\n\nNauen D.W.\n\nChristian K.M.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nSingle-Cell RNA-Seq with Waterfall Reveals Molecular Cascades underlying Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n). Indeed, mitochondria are morphologically different in qNSCs and aNSCs in the adult hippocampus; mitochondria are thin and elongated in qNSCs, whereas they have mixed globular and tubular shapes in aNSCs (\n\nBeckervordersandforth et al., 2017\n\nBeckervordersandforth R.\n\nEbert B.\n\nSchäffner I.\n\nMoss J.\n\nFiebig C.\n\nShin J.\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nGhosh L.\n\nTrinchero M.F.\n\nStockburger C.\n\net al.\n\nRole of Mitochondrial Metabolism in the Control of Early Lineage Progression and Aging Phenotypes in Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.\n\n). During aging, mitochondria become more dispersed and less perinuclear in qNSCs of the SVZ niche (\n\nCapilla-Gonzalez et al., 2014\n\nCapilla-Gonzalez V.\n\nCebrian-Silla A.\n\nGuerrero-Cazares H.\n\nGarcia-Verdugo J.M.\n\nQuiñones-Hinojosa A.\n\nAge-related changes in astrocytic and ependymal cells of the subventricular zone.\n\n). Furthermore, aging causes mitochondria to become more densely packed in hippocampal aNSCs, with decreased membrane potential and lower levels of ATP (\n\nBeckervordersandforth et al., 2017\n\nBeckervordersandforth R.\n\nEbert B.\n\nSchäffner I.\n\nMoss J.\n\nFiebig C.\n\nShin J.\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nGhosh L.\n\nTrinchero M.F.\n\nStockburger C.\n\net al.\n\nRole of Mitochondrial Metabolism in the Control of Early Lineage Progression and Aging Phenotypes in Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.\n\n). Restoring mitochondrial function in old aNSCs with piracetam (a drug with suggested use for age-related cognitive decline) can improve hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo in old mice (\n\nBeckervordersandforth et al., 2017\n\nBeckervordersandforth R.\n\nEbert B.\n\nSchäffner I.\n\nMoss J.\n\nFiebig C.\n\nShin J.\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nGhosh L.\n\nTrinchero M.F.\n\nStockburger C.\n\net al.\n\nRole of Mitochondrial Metabolism in the Control of Early Lineage Progression and Aging Phenotypes in Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.\n\n). Similarly, ectopic expression of proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1a), a factor that increases cellular aerobic capacity by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic gene transcription, also improves neurogenesis in the aged SVZ in vivo (\n\nStoll et al., 2015\n\nStoll E.A.\n\nMakin R.\n\nSweet I.R.\n\nTrevelyan A.J.\n\nMiwa S.\n\nHorner P.J.\n\nTurnbull D.M.\n\nNeural Stem Cells in the Adult Subventricular Zone Oxidize Fatty Acids to Produce Energy and Support Neurogenic Activity.\n\n). Because aNSCs and qNSCs rely on mitochondria to optimally control metabolism, restoring mitochondrial function in old individuals could improve cellular function across the NSC lineage, resulting in an overall boost in neurogenesis.\n\nLipid Metabolism\n\nLipid metabolism is emerging as an important component of NSC regulation, but its role during NSC aging remains unknown. Degradation of lipids via fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is important for maintenance of quiescence in young hippocampal qNSCs in vivo, and inhibition of FAO (via addition of malonyl-coenzyme A [CoA]) is sufficient to induce exit from quiescence and enhance NSC proliferation in vitro (\n\nKnobloch et al., 2017\n\nKnobloch M.\n\nPilz G.A.\n\nGhesquière B.\n\nKovacs W.J.\n\nWegleiter T.\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nHruzova M.\n\nZamboni N.\n\nCarmeliet P.\n\nJessberger S.\n\nA Fatty Acid Oxidation-Dependent Metabolic Shift Regulates Adult Neural Stem Cell Activity.\n\n). FAO is also a major regulator of quiescence in hematopoietic (\n\nIto et al., 2012\n\nIto K.\n\nCarracedo A.\n\nWeiss D.\n\nArai F.\n\nAla U.\n\nAvigan D.E.\n\nSchafer Z.T.\n\nEvans R.M.\n\nSuda T.\n\nLee C.H.\n\nPandolfi P.P.\n\nA PML–PPAR-δ pathway for fatty acid oxidation regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance.\n\n), intestinal (\n\nMihaylova et al., 2018\n\nMihaylova M.M.\n\nCheng C.W.\n\nCao A.Q.\n\nTripathi S.\n\nMana M.D.\n\nBauer-Rowe K.E.\n\nAbu-Remaileh M.\n\nClavain L.\n\nErdemir A.\n\nLewis C.A.\n\net al.\n\nFasting Activates Fatty Acid Oxidation to Enhance Intestinal Stem Cell Function during Homeostasis and Aging.\n\n), and muscle stem cells (\n\nRyall et al., 2015\n\nRyall J.G.\n\nDell’Orso S.\n\nDerfoul A.\n\nJuan A.\n\nZare H.\n\nFeng X.\n\nClermont D.\n\nKoulnis M.\n\nGutierrez-Cruz G.\n\nFulco M.\n\nSartorelli V.\n\nThe NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase translates a metabolic switch into regulatory epigenetics in skeletal muscle stem cells.\n\n). Whether FAO changes with age in NSCs has not yet been examined. However, this process decreases with age in intestinal stem cells (\n\nMihaylova et al., 2018\n\nMihaylova M.M.\n\nCheng C.W.\n\nCao A.Q.\n\nTripathi S.\n\nMana M.D.\n\nBauer-Rowe K.E.\n\nAbu-Remaileh M.\n\nClavain L.\n\nErdemir A.\n\nLewis C.A.\n\net al.\n\nFasting Activates Fatty Acid Oxidation to Enhance Intestinal Stem Cell Function during Homeostasis and Aging.\n\n), suggesting that maintaining FAO could play an important role in protecting qNSCs during aging. In contrast, young aNSCs upregulate lipid production through fatty acid synthase (FASN)-dependent de novo lipogenesis in the hippocampus (\n\nKnobloch et al., 2013\n\nKnobloch M.\n\nBraun S.M.\n\nZurkirchen L.\n\nvon Schoultz C.\n\nZamboni N.\n\nAraúzo-Bravo M.J.\n\nKovacs W.J.\n\nKaralay O.\n\nSuter U.\n\nMachado R.A.\n\net al.\n\nMetabolic control of adult neural stem cell activity by Fasn-dependent lipogenesis.\n\n). Furthermore, inhibiting FASN in vivo abolishes the beneficial effects of running on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in mice (\n\nChorna et al., 2013\n\nChorna N.E.\n\nSantos-Soto I.J.\n\nCarballeira N.M.\n\nMorales J.L.\n\nde la Nuez J.\n\nCátala-Valentin A.\n\nChornyy A.P.\n\nVázquez-Montes A.\n\nDe Ortiz S.P.\n\nFatty acid synthase as a factor required for exercise-induced cognitive enhancement and dentate gyrus cellular proliferation.\n\n). Proper FASN function is also required for hippocampal NSC proliferation in mice and humans (\n\nBowers et al., 2020\n\nBowers M.\n\nLiang T.\n\nGonzalez-Bohorquez D.\n\nZocher S.\n\nJaeger B.N.\n\nKovacs W.J.\n\nRöhrl C.\n\nCramb K.M.L.\n\nWinterer J.\n\nKruse M.\n\net al.\n\nFASN-Dependent Lipid Metabolism Links Neurogenic Stem/Progenitor Cell Activity to Learning and Memory Deficits.\n\n). Thus, maintenance of lipogenesis in aNSCs could be essential to counter NSC decline during aging. Lipid accumulation in other cells in the niche may also indirectly contribute to NSC aging. For example, dietary supplementation with the mono-unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid leads to lipid droplet formation in ependymal cells, and this is associated with decreased neurogenesis in the SVZ (in the context of an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model, 3xTg-AD) (\n\nHamilton et al., 2015\n\nHamilton L.K.\n\nDufresne M.\n\nJoppé S.E.\n\nPetryszyn S.\n\nAumont A.\n\nCalon F.\n\nBarnabé-Heider F.\n\nFurtos A.\n\nParent M.\n\nChaurand P.\n\nFernandes K.J.\n\nAberrant Lipid Metabolism in the Forebrain Niche Suppresses Adult Neural Stem Cell Proliferation in an Animal Model of Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\n). Similarly, obesity induces build-up of senescent glial cells containing excessive fat deposits in the SVZ, and genetic ablation of these senescent glial cells can restore neurogenesis in the SVZ niche (\n\nOgrodnik et al., 2019\n\nOgrodnik M.\n\nZhu Y.\n\nLanghi L.G.P.\n\nTchkonia T.\n\nKrüger P.\n\nFielder E.\n\nVictorelli S.\n\nRuswhandi R.A.\n\nGiorgadze N.\n\nPirtskhalava T.\n\net al.\n\nObesity-Induced Cellular Senescence Drives Anxiety and Impairs Neurogenesis.\n\n). Future studies will be needed to determine how specific lipids regulate NSC function during aging and whether lipids could have critical roles in processes beyond metabolism, including membrane homeostasis and signaling. Given the malleability of dietary interventions, modulating the composition of lipids in the diet could provide novel ways to “rejuvenate” old neurogenic niches.\n\nProtein Homeostasis\n\nPreservation of a pristine proteome is essential for the maintenance of cells such as NSCs that must continuously function over long periods of time. NSCs and their progeny use different strategies to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis); qNSCs and differentiated progeny rely mostly on the lysosome-autophagy pathway, whereas aNSCs turn to active proteasomes and chaperones (\n\nKobayashi et al., 2019\n\nKobayashi T.\n\nPiao W.\n\nTakamura T.\n\nKori H.\n\nMiyachi H.\n\nKitano S.\n\nIwamoto Y.\n\nYamada M.\n\nImayoshi I.\n\nShioda S.\n\net al.\n\nEnhanced lysosomal degradation maintains the quiescent state of neural stem cells.\n\n;\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n;\n\nSchaffner et al., 2018\n\nSchaffner I.\n\nMinakaki G.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBalta E.A.\n\nSchlotzer-Schrehardt U.\n\nSchwarz T.J.\n\nBeckervordersandforth R.\n\nWinner B.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nDePinho R.A.\n\net al.\n\nFoxO Function Is Essential for Maintenance of Autophagic Flux and Neuronal Morphogenesis in Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n;\n\nVonk et al., 2020\n\nVonk W.I.M.\n\nRainbolt T.K.\n\nDolan P.T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nBrunet A.\n\nFrydman J.\n\nDifferentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.\n\n). During aging, impaired function of the lysosome-autophagy pathway in qNSCs from the SVZ contributes to their reduced ability to exit quiescence and start proliferating (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n). However, this decline is not inexorable. Overexpression of a key transcription factor that activates the lysosome-autophagy pathway (transcription factor EB, TFEB) in primary cultures of qNSCs from old SVZs improves the ability of these old qNSCs to exit quiescence (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n). The role of the lysosome-autophagy pathway in quiescence (and its decline with age) has also been reported in the hematopoietic stem cell pool (\n\nHo et al., 2017\n\nHo T.T.\n\nWarr M.R.\n\nAdelman E.R.\n\nLansinger O.M.\n\nFlach J.\n\nVerovskaya E.V.\n\nFigueroa M.E.\n\nPassegué E.\n\nAutophagy maintains the metabolism and function of young and old stem cells.\n\n) and in the nematode germline (\n\nBohnert and Kenyon, 2017\n\nBohnert K.A.\n\nKenyon C.\n\nA lysosomal switch triggers proteostasis renewal in the immortal C. elegans germ lineage.\n\n), suggesting that targeting this pathway in old qNSCs could improve dormant cell function and reactivation upon stimulation. Autophagy is also important in proliferative NSCs. The FOXO family member FOXO3 functionally regulates induction of autophagy genes in primary cultures of aNSCs isolated from the SVZ of young adult mice (\n\nAudesse et al., 2019\n\nAudesse A.J.\n\nDhakal S.\n\nHassell L.A.\n\nGardell Z.\n\nNemtsova Y.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nFOXO3 directly regulates an autophagy network to functionally regulate proteostasis in adult neural stem cells.\n\n). Finally, differentiated progeny (new neurons) rely mainly on the lysosome-autophagy pathway to maintain a healthy proteome (\n\nSchaffner et al., 2018\n\nSchaffner I.\n\nMinakaki G.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBalta E.A.\n\nSchlotzer-Schrehardt U.\n\nSchwarz T.J.\n\nBeckervordersandforth R.\n\nWinner B.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nDePinho R.A.\n\net al.\n\nFoxO Function Is Essential for Maintenance of Autophagic Flux and Neuronal Morphogenesis in Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n). Induction of autophagy via FOXO transcription factors regulates the morphology and spine density of newborn hippocampal neurons in young adult mice (\n\nSchaffner et al., 2018\n\nSchaffner I.\n\nMinakaki G.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBalta E.A.\n\nSchlotzer-Schrehardt U.\n\nSchwarz T.J.\n\nBeckervordersandforth R.\n\nWinner B.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nDePinho R.A.\n\net al.\n\nFoxO Function Is Essential for Maintenance of Autophagic Flux and Neuronal Morphogenesis in Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n). Thus, targeting the autophagy pathway in old individuals could have multiple beneficial effects by improving the function of qNSCs, helping aNSCs, and favoring newborn neurons.\n\nThe function of the proteasome deteriorates in aNSCs during aging, which may contribute to the reduced proliferative capacity of these cells. Expression of proteasomal components declines in SVZ aNSCs with age (\n\nZhao et al., 2016\n\nZhao Y.\n\nLiu X.\n\nHe Z.\n\nNiu X.\n\nShi W.\n\nDing J.M.\n\nZhang L.\n\nYuan T.\n\nLi A.\n\nYang W.\n\nLu L.\n\nEssential role of proteasomes in maintaining self-renewal in neural progenitor cells.\n\n). Enhancing the activity of the proteasome by overexpression of PSMB5 (a component of the 20S proteasome complex) or 18α-GA (a proteasome activator) leads to increased NSC proliferation in culture and in vivo in young mice (\n\nZhao et al., 2016\n\nZhao Y.\n\nLiu X.\n\nHe Z.\n\nNiu X.\n\nShi W.\n\nDing J.M.\n\nZhang L.\n\nYuan T.\n\nLi A.\n\nYang W.\n\nLu L.\n\nEssential role of proteasomes in maintaining self-renewal in neural progenitor cells.\n\n), but it remains to be determined whether increased proteasome activity also boosts NSCs from old individuals. Similarly, other proliferative stem cell pools, including embryonic stem cells (\n\nVilchez et al., 2012\n\nVilchez D.\n\nBoyer L.\n\nMorantte I.\n\nLutz M.\n\nMerkwirth C.\n\nJoyce D.\n\nSpencer B.\n\nPage L.\n\nMasliah E.\n\nBerggren W.T.\n\net al.\n\nIncreased proteasome activity in human embryonic stem cells is regulated by PSMD11.\n\n) and induced pluripotent stem cells (\n\nBuckley et al., 2012\n\nBuckley S.M.\n\nAranda-Orgilles B.\n\nStrikoudis A.\n\nApostolou E.\n\nLoizou E.\n\nMoran-Crusio K.\n\nFarnsworth C.L.\n\nKoller A.A.\n\nDasgupta R.\n\nSilva J.C.\n\net al.\n\nRegulation of pluripotency and cellular reprogramming by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n\n), exhibit high proteasome activity, which may be essential for their “immortal” features. Enhancing proteasome activity in old proliferating stem cell pools could help to ameliorate proteostatic stress and restore their regenerative potential.\n\nThe chaperone network also declines with aging, and this deficit affects aNSCs and their progeny. Chaperones are heavily remodeled during NSC differentiation (\n\nVonk et al., 2020\n\nVonk W.I.M.\n\nRainbolt T.K.\n\nDolan P.T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nBrunet A.\n\nFrydman J.\n\nDifferentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.\n\n); proliferating NSCs express high levels of the chaperonin TRiC/CCT, whereas differentiated progeny express small heat shock proteins (\n\nVonk et al., 2020\n\nVonk W.I.M.\n\nRainbolt T.K.\n\nDolan P.T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nBrunet A.\n\nFrydman J.\n\nDifferentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.\n\n). TRiC/CCT protein levels decline in hippocampal aNSCs during aging (\n\nVonk et al., 2020\n\nVonk W.I.M.\n\nRainbolt T.K.\n\nDolan P.T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nBrunet A.\n\nFrydman J.\n\nDifferentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.\n\n). It will be interesting to determine the relative contributions of the chaperone network to NSC function and differentiation during aging and its interplay with the other branches of the proteostasis network.\n\nProtein Aggregates\n\nThe decline in proteostasis during aging leads to accumulation of aggregated proteins. Interestingly, young adult qNSCs already contain protein aggregates, whereas young aNSCs have very few aggregates (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n). These observations suggest that quiescent stem cells may tolerate more protein aggregates or may require proteins with increased propensity to aggregate for their function, which may have deleterious consequences during aging. Old qNSCs freshly isolated from the SVZ have more aggregates than young ones (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n), consistent with a decline in lysosome-autophagy function in these cells. qNSCs isolated from the hippocampus also harbor protein aggregates (\n\nMorrow et al., 2020\n\nMorrow C.S.\n\nPorter T.J.\n\nXu N.\n\nArndt Z.P.\n\nAko-Asare K.\n\nHeo H.J.\n\nThompson E.A.N.\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nVimentin Coordinates Protein Turnover at the Aggresome during Neural Stem Cell Quiescence Exit.\n\n). Localization of proteasomes to these protein aggregates, mediated by the intermediate filament vimentin, is important for the transition from quiescence to proliferation (\n\nMorrow et al., 2020\n\nMorrow C.S.\n\nPorter T.J.\n\nXu N.\n\nArndt Z.P.\n\nAko-Asare K.\n\nHeo H.J.\n\nThompson E.A.N.\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nVimentin Coordinates Protein Turnover at the Aggresome during Neural Stem Cell Quiescence Exit.\n\n). The difference in aggregate content between aNSCs and qNSCs may be explained by differences in their protein synthesis rates and proteostasis strategies. Proteasomes in aNSCs may be more efficient at eliminating protein aggregates, and the combination of proteasome and autophagy induction in aNSCs may help to efficiently remove aggregates (\n\nAudesse et al., 2019\n\nAudesse A.J.\n\nDhakal S.\n\nHassell L.A.\n\nGardell Z.\n\nNemtsova Y.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nFOXO3 directly regulates an autophagy network to functionally regulate proteostasis in adult neural stem cells.\n\n). Furthermore, the high expression levels of the chaperonin TRiC/CCT in proliferative NSCs also contribute to maintenance of misfolded protein solubility (\n\nVonk et al., 2020\n\nVonk W.I.M.\n\nRainbolt T.K.\n\nDolan P.T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nBrunet A.\n\nFrydman J.\n\nDifferentiation Drives Widespread Rewiring of the Neural Stem Cell Chaperone Network.\n\n). Finally, by virtue of being proliferative stem cells, aNSCs may dilute or differentially segregate protein aggregates during cell division and differentiation. Indeed, when young aNSCs divide, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a physical barrier that segregates damaged proteins to the non-stem daughter cell, protecting aNSCs from proteostatic stress (\n\nMoore et al., 2015\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nPilz G.A.\n\nAraúzo-Bravo M.J.\n\nBarral Y.\n\nJessberger S.\n\nA mechanism for the segregation of age in mammalian neural stem cells.\n\n). This barrier weakens with age in primary cultures of aNSCs from the hippocampus of old mice, which leads to an equal distribution of damaged proteins between stem and non-stem daughter cells during cell division and an increase in proteostatic burden in aNSCs (\n\nMoore et al., 2015\n\nMoore D.L.\n\nPilz G.A.\n\nAraúzo-Bravo M.J.\n\nBarral Y.\n\nJessberger S.\n\nA mechanism for the segregation of age in mammalian neural stem cells.\n\n). This increase in proteostatic burden could lead to an age-dependent decline in NSC function by slowing the rate of NSC proliferation or by promoting a more quiescent state. The specific proteins in these aggregates could also participate in NSC defects, but the composition of the protein aggregates in young and old NSCs remains entirely unknown.\n\nIntegration of Nutrient-Sensing, Metabolism, and Proteostasis Pathways in NSCs\n\nOverall, the different metabolic and proteostatic strategies used by qNSCs and aNSCs and their progeny are likely necessary to support the fundamental functional differences between these cell types (Figure 2; see reviews by\n\nCavallucci et al., 2016\n\nCavallucci V.\n\nFidaleo M.\n\nPani G.\n\nNeural Stem Cells and Nutrients: Poised Between Quiescence and Exhaustion.\n\n;\n\nKnobloch and Jessberger, 2017\n\nKnobloch M.\n\nJessberger S.\n\nMetabolism and neurogenesis.\n\n). Dormant, non-dividing qNSCs have lower metabolic demands and employ mechanisms to produce energy long term, such as the lysosome-autophagy pathway and FAO. In contrast, actively dividing aNSCs have higher metabolic and protein synthesis rates (\n\nBaser et al., 2019\n\nBaser A.\n\nSkabkin M.\n\nKleber S.\n\nDang Y.\n\nGülcüler Balta G.S.\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nGöpferich M.\n\nIbañez D.C.\n\nSchefzik R.\n\nLopez A.S.\n\net al.\n\nOnset of differentiation is post-transcriptionally controlled in adult neural stem cells.\n\n), so they rely mostly on oxidative phosphorylation, an effective and fast energy production process, and they upregulate lipogenesis. Actively proliferating aNSCs also require chaperones and active proteasomes to remove short-lived proteins, such as cell cycle regulators, as well as damaged or unfolded proteins to prevent them from forming large aggregates that could compromise their function or be transferred to their progeny. Although metabolic and proteostatic processes ultimately decline with age, this decline can be counteracted. Inducing autophagy can facilitate not only removal of protein aggregates but also clearing of defective mitochondria (mitophagy) and degradation of lipids (lipophagy) to produce free fatty acids for oxidative phosphorylation (\n\nSingh and Cuervo, 2011\n\nSingh R.\n\nCuervo A.M.\n\nAutophagy in the cellular energetic balance.\n\n). Similarly, reducing nutrient intake or blocking nutrient-sensing pathways (insulin/IGF1 and mTOR) can improve NSC function by triggering activation of transcription factors (FOXO and TFEB) that coordinate metabolism and proteostasis. Given how connected these pathways are, targeting one of these processes in old NSCs may also restore related pathways, resulting in a synergistic effect to improve old NSC function.\n\nNutrient-sensing, metabolism, and proteostasis pathways may also be regulated differentially with age, depending on the cell type or even the neurogenic niche. Interestingly, because many aspects of organismal metabolic regulation are non-cell autonomous, it is possible that age-dependent changes in one neurogenic niche could affect other regions. For example, NSCs in the hypothalamus, a region involved in systemic regulation of metabolism, may participate in regulation of organismal metabolism (\n\nBolborea and Dale, 2013\n\nBolborea M.\n\nDale N.\n\nHypothalamic tanycytes: potential roles in the control of feeding and energy balance.\n\n). Understanding the integration of different pathways and their specific actions within neurogenic niches or at a distance in the whole organism will be crucial for identifying strategies to counter NSC aging.\n\nTranscriptional, Epigenomic, and Cell Cycle Changes in NSC Aging\n\nThe decline in neurogenic potential exhibited by aged NSCs is partly mediated by changes to the global transcriptional and epigenomic landscape that regulates stem cell function. Among these global changes, expression changes in key cell cycle regulators have emerged as critical for NSC activation, exhaustion, and senescence. Cell cycle regulators are particularly interesting because they could be readily modulated to improve old NSC function.\n\nTranscriptomic Analyses of the Aging NSC Niche\n\nAnalysis of the NSC transcriptome provides a global snapshot of the cellular processes and pathways that are most affected by age. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of freshly isolated astrocytes, qNSCs, aNSCs, and NPCs from the SVZ of young and old mice revealed fundamental transcriptomic differences in aging qNSC and aNSC states (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n). During aging, quiescent cells (astrocytes and qNSCs) undergo more transcriptional changes than proliferative cells (aNSCs and NPCs), including changes in proteostasis pathways (lysosome and proteasome) (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n). Consistently, cultured aNSCs from the SVZ of young and old mice displayed few transcriptomic differences with age (\n\nLupo et al., 2018\n\nLupo G.\n\nNisi P.S.\n\nEsteve P.\n\nPaul Y.L.\n\nNovo C.L.\n\nSidders B.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBiagioni S.\n\nLiu H.K.\n\nBovolenta P.\n\net al.\n\nMolecular profiling of aged neural progenitors identifies Dbx2 as a candidate regulator of age-associated neurogenic decline.\n\n). Because aNSCs arise from qNSCs, these results raise intriguing possibilities. The rapid proliferation and differentiation of the transient aNSC population could preclude accumulation of transcriptional changes. Alternatively, the very process of activation could functionally reset the aging hallmarks of qNSCs, leading to a more “youthful” transcriptional landscape.\n\nOne challenge in unravelling how aging affects complex tissues, such as neurogenic niches, is cellular heterogeneity. The rapid expansion of single-cell RNA-seq technologies has helped probe the heterogeneity of cell types and transcriptional profiles in young and old neurogenic niches in the SVZ and hippocampus (\n\nArtegiani et al., 2017\n\nArtegiani B.\n\nLyubimova A.\n\nMuraro M.\n\nvan Es J.H.\n\nvan Oudenaarden A.\n\nClevers H.\n\nA Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Study Reveals Cellular and Molecular Dynamics of the Hippocampal Neurogenic Niche.\n\n;\n\nBasak et al., 2018\n\nBasak O.\n\nKrieger T.G.\n\nMuraro M.J.\n\nWiebrands K.\n\nStange D.E.\n\nFrias-Aldeguer J.\n\nRivron N.C.\n\nvan de Wetering M.\n\nvan Es J.H.\n\nvan Oudenaarden A.\n\net al.\n\nTroy+ brain stem cells cycle through quiescence and regulate their number by sensing niche occupancy.\n\n;\n\nDulken et al., 2017\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nBrunet A.\n\nSingle-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis Defines Heterogeneity and Transcriptional Dynamics in the Adult Neural Stem Cell Lineage.\n\n,\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n;\n\nHochgerner et al., 2018\n\nHochgerner H.\n\nZeisel A.\n\nLönnerberg P.\n\nLinnarsson S.\n\nConserved properties of dentate gyrus neurogenesis across postnatal development revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.\n\n;\n\nKalamakis et al., 2019\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nBrune D.\n\nRavichandran S.\n\nBolz J.\n\nFan W.\n\nZiebell F.\n\nStiehl T.\n\nCatala-Martinez F.\n\nKupke J.\n\nZhao S.\n\net al.\n\nQuiescence Modulates Stem Cell Maintenance and Regenerative Capacity in the Aging Brain.\n\n;\n\nLlorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015\n\nLlorens-Bobadilla E.\n\nZhao S.\n\nBaser A.\n\nSaiz-Castro G.\n\nZwadlo K.\n\nMartin-Villalba A.\n\nSingle-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals a Population of Dormant Neural Stem Cells that Become Activated upon Brain Injury.\n\n;\n\nLuo et al., 2015\n\nLuo Y.\n\nCoskun V.\n\nLiang A.\n\nYu J.\n\nCheng L.\n\nGe W.\n\nShi Z.\n\nZhang K.\n\nLi C.\n\nCui Y.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell transcriptome analyses reveal signals to activate dormant neural stem cells.\n\n;\n\nMizrak et al., 2019\n\nMizrak D.\n\nLevitin H.M.\n\nDelgado A.C.\n\nCrotet V.\n\nYuan J.\n\nChaker Z.\n\nSilva-Vargas V.\n\nSims P.A.\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nSingle-Cell Analysis of Regional Differences in Adult V-SVZ Neural Stem Cell Lineages.\n\n;\n\nShi et al., 2018\n\nShi Z.\n\nGeng Y.\n\nLiu J.\n\nZhang H.\n\nZhou L.\n\nLin Q.\n\nYu J.\n\nZhang K.\n\nLiu J.\n\nGao X.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell transcriptomics reveals gene signatures and alterations associated with aging in distinct neural stem/progenitor cell subpopulations.\n\n;\n\nShin et al., 2015\n\nShin J.\n\nBerg D.A.\n\nZhu Y.\n\nShin J.Y.\n\nSong J.\n\nBonaguidi M.A.\n\nEnikolopov G.\n\nNauen D.W.\n\nChristian K.M.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nSingle-Cell RNA-Seq with Waterfall Reveals Molecular Cascades underlying Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n;\n\nZywitza et al., 2018\n\nZywitza V.\n\nMisios A.\n\nBunatyan L.\n\nWillnow T.E.\n\nRajewsky N.\n\nSingle-Cell Transcriptomics Characterizes Cell Types in the Subventricular Zone and Uncovers Molecular Defects Impairing Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n).

Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of the whole SVZ niche have revealed that the majority of age-related transcriptional changes occur in specific cell populations (microglia, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and qNSCs), all of which exhibit strong transcriptional upregulation of interferon signaling pathways with age (\n\nArtegiani et al., 2017\n\nArtegiani B.\n\nLyubimova A.\n\nMuraro M.\n\nvan Es J.H.\n\nvan Oudenaarden A.\n\nClevers H.\n\nA Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Study Reveals Cellular and Molecular Dynamics of the Hippocampal Neurogenic Niche.\n\n;\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n;\n\nKalamakis et al., 2019\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nBrune D.\n\nRavichandran S.\n\nBolz J.\n\nFan W.\n\nZiebell F.\n\nStiehl T.\n\nCatala-Martinez F.\n\nKupke J.\n\nZhao S.\n\net al.\n\nQuiescence Modulates Stem Cell Maintenance and Regenerative Capacity in the Aging Brain.\n\n). Single-cell RNA-seq analyses have also shown that qNSCs and aNSC population numbers are significantly smaller in SVZs from old mice (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n;\n\nKalamakis et al., 2019\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nBrune D.\n\nRavichandran S.\n\nBolz J.\n\nFan W.\n\nZiebell F.\n\nStiehl T.\n\nCatala-Martinez F.\n\nKupke J.\n\nZhao S.\n\net al.\n\nQuiescence Modulates Stem Cell Maintenance and Regenerative Capacity in the Aging Brain.\n\n), consistent with previous data by immunofluorescence staining and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (\n\nLuo et al., 2006\n\nLuo J.\n\nDaniels S.B.\n\nLennington J.B.\n\nNotti R.Q.\n\nConover J.C.\n\nThe aging neurogenic subventricular zone.\n\n). Collectively, these single-cell transcriptomic studies have established a global cell atlas of the neurogenic niches and revealed changes in cell composition (with decreases in NSCs) and in the transcriptome of specific cell populations (e.g., microglia) with aging. It will be interesting to determine which of these age-dependent changes can be reversed by known “rejuvenation” interventions, such as dietary changes.\n\nChromatin Modifiers and Epigenomic Changes\n\nAnalysis of the epigenomic landscape and resulting chromatin states of NSCs during aging can provide key information about how age affects cell identity and function (\n\nKlemm et al., 2019\n\nKlemm S.L.\n\nShipony Z.\n\nGreenleaf W.J.\n\nChromatin accessibility and the regulatory epigenome.\n\n). Because of the reversibility of epigenomic marks, identifying the enzymes that are responsible for the epigenomic changes observed during NSC aging is an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention.\n\nHistorically, many studies have been dedicated to understanding the role of DNA methylation and its upstream modifiers, such as DNA methyltransferases, in embryonic and adult neurogenesis (extensively reviewed in\n\nCui and Xu, 2018\n\nCui D.\n\nXu X.\n\nDNA Methyltransferases, DNA Methylation, and Age-Associated Cognitive Function.\n\n;\n\nJobe and Zhao, 2017\n\nJobe E.M.\n\nZhao X.\n\nDNA Methylation and Adult Neurogenesis.\n\n). More recently, studies have begun to characterize global DNA methylation changes throughout aging. Global levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) decrease with age in whole hippocampus samples and correlate with the age-related decline in neurogenesis (\n\nGontier et al., 2018\n\nGontier G.\n\nIyer M.\n\nShea J.M.\n\nBieri G.\n\nWheatley E.G.\n\nRamalho-Santos M.\n\nVilleda S.A.\n\nTet2 Rescues Age-Related Regenerative Decline and Enhances Cognitive Function in the Adult Mouse Brain.\n\n). In parallel, mRNA levels of TET2, the enzyme that catalyzes formation of 5hmC from 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) via oxidation, also decrease in the hippocampus with age. Reducing in vivo TET2 expression in young hippocampal NPCs alone (by injection of tamoxifen in Tet2flox/flox; NestinCre-ERT2 mice) is sufficient to decrease neurogenesis and cognitive performance, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect (\n\nGontier et al., 2018\n\nGontier G.\n\nIyer M.\n\nShea J.M.\n\nBieri G.\n\nWheatley E.G.\n\nRamalho-Santos M.\n\nVilleda S.A.\n\nTet2 Rescues Age-Related Regenerative Decline and Enhances Cognitive Function in the Adult Mouse Brain.\n\n). Conversely, overexpression of TET2 in the DG of young adult mice via in vivo lentivirus administration increases the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus and improves spatial learning and memory (\n\nGontier et al., 2018\n\nGontier G.\n\nIyer M.\n\nShea J.M.\n\nBieri G.\n\nWheatley E.G.\n\nRamalho-Santos M.\n\nVilleda S.A.\n\nTet2 Rescues Age-Related Regenerative Decline and Enhances Cognitive Function in the Adult Mouse Brain.\n\n). Thus, overexpressing or activating TET2 in middle-aged animals could be a strategy to enhance neurogenesis and cognitive performance in aging animals.\n\nGlobal profiling of histone methylation marks (histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation [H3K4me3] and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation [H3K27me3] chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) and DNA methylation marks (5mc and 5hmC) have uncovered changes in aNSCs cultured from young and old SVZs (\n\nLupo et al., 2018\n\nLupo G.\n\nNisi P.S.\n\nEsteve P.\n\nPaul Y.L.\n\nNovo C.L.\n\nSidders B.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBiagioni S.\n\nLiu H.K.\n\nBovolenta P.\n\net al.\n\nMolecular profiling of aged neural progenitors identifies Dbx2 as a candidate regulator of age-associated neurogenic decline.\n\n). Although there are relatively few epigenomic (and transcriptomic) differences, the regulatory marks associated with the Dbx2 locus change with age (\n\nLupo et al., 2018\n\nLupo G.\n\nNisi P.S.\n\nEsteve P.\n\nPaul Y.L.\n\nNovo C.L.\n\nSidders B.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBiagioni S.\n\nLiu H.K.\n\nBovolenta P.\n\net al.\n\nMolecular profiling of aged neural progenitors identifies Dbx2 as a candidate regulator of age-associated neurogenic decline.\n\n). The Dbx2 locus encodes a transcription factor that was previously implicated in spinal cord development (\n\nPierani et al., 1999\n\nPierani A.\n\nBrenner-Morton S.\n\nChiang C.\n\nJessell T.M.\n\nA sonic hedgehog-independent, retinoid-activated pathway of neurogenesis in the ventral spinal cord.\n\n). Overexpression of DBX2 in young aNSCs in vitro leads to reduced NSC proliferation and changes in the transcriptome that resemble those occurring in old aNSCs (\n\nLupo et al., 2018\n\nLupo G.\n\nNisi P.S.\n\nEsteve P.\n\nPaul Y.L.\n\nNovo C.L.\n\nSidders B.\n\nKhan M.A.\n\nBiagioni S.\n\nLiu H.K.\n\nBovolenta P.\n\net al.\n\nMolecular profiling of aged neural progenitors identifies Dbx2 as a candidate regulator of age-associated neurogenic decline.\n\n). Thus, decreasing DBX2 levels could have potential therapeutic advantages for improving neurogenesis in old individuals.\n\nSeveral studies have also characterized the global epigenomic differences between qNSCs and aNSCs derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or neonatal mice, although it is not yet known how these epigenomic marks could be affected during aging. Co-localization of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (a chromatin mark associated with enhancers) and p300 (a transcriptional co-activator that binds enhancers) has been used to identify quiescence- and activation-specific enhancers genome-wide in cultured murine ESC-derived NSCs (\n\nMartynoga et al., 2013\n\nMartynoga B.\n\nMateo J.L.\n\nZhou B.\n\nAndersen J.\n\nAchimastou A.\n\nUrbán N.\n\nvan den Berg D.\n\nGeorgopoulou D.\n\nHadjur S.\n\nWittbrodt J.\n\net al.\n\nEpigenomic enhancer annotation reveals a key role for NFIX in neural stem cell quiescence.\n\n). Enhancers in quiescent cells exhibit enrichment for the nuclear factor one (NFI) transcription factor family motif (\n\nMartynoga et al., 2013\n\nMartynoga B.\n\nMateo J.L.\n\nZhou B.\n\nAndersen J.\n\nAchimastou A.\n\nUrbán N.\n\nvan den Berg D.\n\nGeorgopoulou D.\n\nHadjur S.\n\nWittbrodt J.\n\net al.\n\nEpigenomic enhancer annotation reveals a key role for NFIX in neural stem cell quiescence.\n\n). The loss of the family member nuclear factor one X (NFIX) (in Nfix−/− mice) is sufficient to reduce the proportion of qNSCs in the hippocampus of postnatal mice, implicating NFIX as a key regulator of the quiescent state (\n\nMartynoga et al., 2013\n\nMartynoga B.\n\nMateo J.L.\n\nZhou B.\n\nAndersen J.\n\nAchimastou A.\n\nUrbán N.\n\nvan den Berg D.\n\nGeorgopoulou D.\n\nHadjur S.\n\nWittbrodt J.\n\net al.\n\nEpigenomic enhancer annotation reveals a key role for NFIX in neural stem cell quiescence.\n\n). Epigenomic assays that profile long-range binding interactions, such as chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), have also uncovered how transcription factors bind to regulate NSC maintenance. ChIP-seq and ChIA-PET of murine neonatal forebrain-derived aNSCs identified SOX2 binding sites predominantly located in promoters and enhancers (\n\nBertolini et al., 2019\n\nBertolini J.A.\n\nFavaro R.\n\nZhu Y.\n\nPagin M.\n\nNgan C.Y.\n\nWong C.H.\n\nTjong H.\n\nVermunt M.W.\n\nMartynoga B.\n\nBarone C.\n\net al.\n\nMapping the Global Chromatin Connectivity Network for Sox2 Function in Neural Stem Cell Maintenance.\n\n). SOX2 is an important transcription factor for NSC maintenance, and its loss causes self-renewal defects (\n\nGraham et al., 2003\n\nGraham V.\n\nKhudyakov J.\n\nEllis P.\n\nPevny L.\n\nSOX2 functions to maintain neural progenitor identity.\n\n). SOX2 enhancer-promoter interactions are particularly important for regulation of the gene Socs3, a JAK/STAT signaling inhibitor, and SOCS3 overexpression can rescue the self-renewal defect observed in Sox2−/− NSCs (\n\nBertolini et al., 2019\n\nBertolini J.A.\n\nFavaro R.\n\nZhu Y.\n\nPagin M.\n\nNgan C.Y.\n\nWong C.H.\n\nTjong H.\n\nVermunt M.W.\n\nMartynoga B.\n\nBarone C.\n\net al.\n\nMapping the Global Chromatin Connectivity Network for Sox2 Function in Neural Stem Cell Maintenance.\n\n). However, how NFIX and SOX2 and their target genes change with age and affect NSC aging has yet to be determined.\n\nGlobal profiling of epigenomic changes within aging neurogenic niches has identified potential therapeutic targets, such as DBX2 and TET2. However, most of the studies so far have been conducted on whole-tissue samples or using cultured cells. There is a need for single-cell epigenomic assays (such as single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing [scATAC-seq];\n\nBuenrostro et al., 2015\n\nBuenrostro J.D.\n\nWu B.\n\nLitzenburger U.M.\n\nRuff D.\n\nGonzales M.L.\n\nSnyder M.P.\n\nChang H.Y.\n\nGreenleaf W.J.\n\nSingle-cell chromatin accessibility reveals principles of regulatory variation.\n\n) to identify heterogeneous epigenomic regulation within and between cell types. In addition, profiling a greater diversity of epigenomic marks on specific, isolated in vivo cell populations in the niche during aging will provide key insights into how to restore this landscape and rejuvenate the niche.\n\nRegulation of the Cell Cycle and Senescence\n\nThe ability of NSCs to efficiently enter the cell cycle declines with age. Genes involved in regulating the cell cycle, including tumor suppressors, play a key role in the maintenance of NSC quiescence and activation. These same cell cycle regulators are involved in initiation of cellular senescence, which could diminish the functionality of the stem cell pool during aging. We next discuss how regulation of gene expression programs that control the balance between quiescence and proliferation is critical to guarantee lifelong neurogenesis and avoid premature stem cell exhaustion and senescence.\n\np16INK4a is a negative cell cycle regulator and a prominent biomarker for cellular senescence, a cell state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest and distinct morphological and transcriptional changes (reviewed in\n\nHernandez-Segura et al., 2018\n\nHernandez-Segura A.\n\nNehme J.\n\nDemaria M.\n\nHallmarks of Cellular Senescence.\n\n). Expression of p16INK4a is strongly induced with age in the SVZ and may contribute to the accompanying decline in neurogenesis through cell cycle suppression of aNSCs and NPCs (\n\nMolofsky et al., 2006\n\nMolofsky A.V.\n\nSlutsky S.G.\n\nJoseph N.M.\n\nHe S.\n\nPardal R.\n\nKrishnamurthy J.\n\nSharpless N.E.\n\nMorrison S.J.\n\nIncreasing p16INK4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors and neurogenesis during ageing.\n\n). In middle-aged mice, p16INK4a suppresses hippocampal NSC proliferation in response to exercise (\n\nMicheli et al., 2019\n\nMicheli L.\n\nD’Andrea G.\n\nCeccarelli M.\n\nFerri A.\n\nScardigli R.\n\nTirone F.\n\np16Ink4a Prevents the Activation of Aged Quiescent Dentate Gyrus Stem Cells by Physical Exercise.\n\n). This suppression could be mediated by the ability of p16INK4a to induce senescence. Indeed, p16INK4a upregulation (driven by removal of the monocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein [MOZ]) leads to replicative senescence in ESC-derived NSCs (\n\nPerez-Campo et al., 2014\n\nPerez-Campo F.M.\n\nCosta G.\n\nLie-A-Ling M.\n\nStifani S.\n\nKouskoff V.\n\nLacaud G.\n\nMOZ-mediated repression of p16(INK) (4) (a) is critical for the self-renewal of neural and hematopoietic stem cells.\n\n). In cultured NSCs derived from the hypothalamus, expression of an upstream repressor of the p16INK4a locus, the non-coding RNA Hnscr, declines with age (\n\nXiao et al., 2020\n\nXiao Y.Z.\n\nYang M.\n\nXiao Y.\n\nGuo Q.\n\nHuang Y.\n\nLi C.J.\n\nCai D.\n\nLuo X.H.\n\nReducing Hypothalamic Stem Cell Senescence Protects against Aging-Associated Physiological Decline.\n\n). Knocking down Hnscr in vivo in hypothalamic NSCs increases cellular senescence and results in decreased cognitive performance (i.e., novel object recognition) (\n\nXiao et al., 2020\n\nXiao Y.Z.\n\nYang M.\n\nXiao Y.\n\nGuo Q.\n\nHuang Y.\n\nLi C.J.\n\nCai D.\n\nLuo X.H.\n\nReducing Hypothalamic Stem Cell Senescence Protects against Aging-Associated Physiological Decline.\n\n). Consistently, the senescence phenotype of primary NSCs cultured from the SVZ of an accelerated senescence mouse model (SAMP8 mice) could be prevented by decreasing the mRNA levels of p19ARF, another tumor suppressor encoded within the same locus as p16INK4a, through epigenomic regulation of the locus by histone acetyltransferases (\n\nSoriano-Cantón et al., 2015\n\nSoriano-Cantón R.\n\nPerez-Villalba A.\n\nMorante-Redolat J.M.\n\nMarqués-Torrejón M.A.\n\nPallás M.\n\nPérez-Sánchez F.\n\nFariñas I.\n\nRegulation of the p19(Arf)/p53 pathway by histone acetylation underlies neural stem cell behavior in senescence-prone SAMP8 mice.\n\n). Collectively, these studies suggest that increased expression of negative cell cycle regulators, such as p16INK4a and p19ARF, drives senescent phenotypes in NSCs and seems to be at least partially responsible for the decrease in neurogenic potential observed in NSCs during aging.\n\nConversely, expression of positive cell cycle regulators, such as the Polycomb family member BMI-1 (PCGF4) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), can promote NSC expansion and lead to cognitive improvement. BMI-1 is a known transcriptional repressor of cell cycle inhibitors, including p19ARF/Mdm2/p53 (\n\nGu et al., 2014\n\nGu M.\n\nShen L.\n\nBai L.\n\nGao J.\n\nMarshall C.\n\nWu T.\n\nDing J.\n\nMiao D.\n\nXiao M.\n\nHeterozygous knockout of the Bmi-1 gene causes an early onset of phenotypes associated with brain aging.\n\n), and upregulation of BMI-1 increases self-renewal in hippocampal NSCs (\n\nZelentsova-Levytskyi et al., 2017\n\nZelentsova-Levytskyi K.\n\nTalmi Z.\n\nAbboud-Jarrous G.\n\nCapucha T.\n\nSapir T.\n\nBurstyn-Cohen T.\n\nProtein S Negatively Regulates Neural Stem Cell Self-Renewal through Bmi-1 Signaling.\n\n). Furthermore, simultaneous overexpression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in hippocampal NSCs in older mice (16 months old) by lentiviral delivery of a transgene in vivo increased hippocampal neurogenesis and rescued aspects of age-related cognitive impairment (\n\nBerdugo-Vega et al., 2020\n\nBerdugo-Vega G.\n\nArias-Gil G.\n\nLópez-Fernández A.\n\nArtegiani B.\n\nWasielewska J.M.\n\nLee C.C.\n\nLippert M.T.\n\nKempermann G.\n\nTakagaki K.\n\nCalegari F.\n\nIncreasing neurogenesis refines hippocampal activity rejuvenating navigational learning strategies and contextual memory throughout life.\n\n).\n\nSurprisingly, however, low-level overexpression of negative regulators of the cell cycle (p16INK4a/p19ARF/p53) in mice increases NSC numbers in the SVZ and DG of old individuals and improves cognitive performance (\n\nCarrasco-Garcia et al., 2015\n\nCarrasco-Garcia E.\n\nArrizabalaga O.\n\nSerrano M.\n\nLovell-Badge R.\n\nMatheu A.\n\nIncreased gene dosage of Ink4/Arf and p53 delays age-associated central nervous system functional decline.\n\n). The beneficial effects of low-level overexpression of negative cell cycle regulators might be due to their ability to prevent premature exhaustion of the stem cell pool. Thus, the timing and levels of cell cycle regulator expression are key to maintaining NSC fitness throughout life.\n\nOverall, the critical nature of cell cycle regulators such as p16INK4a, p19ARF, p53, and BMI-1 in regulating NSC viability and neurogenesis has positioned them as potential therapeutic targets to rejuvenate aged NSCs. However, these pathways are delicately regulated. Future work remains to be done to determine the correct dosage and timing of manipulation that will improve NSC health without inadvertently causing premature stem cell exhaustion or senescence.\n\nThe Role of the Niche and Inflammation in NSC Aging\n\nNSCs reside in complex and specialized microenvironments within the brain that contain different cell types and are influenced by a variety of local and systemic factors. NSCs can integrate signals from the niche to couple their activation state and fate decisions to the tissue demands. The cellular composition of NSC niches, their response to local or systemic cues, and even their physical properties, such as stiffness (\n\nSegel et al., 2019\n\nSegel M.\n\nNeumann B.\n\nHill M.F.E.\n\nWeber I.P.\n\nViscomi C.\n\nZhao C.\n\nYoung A.\n\nAgley C.C.\n\nThompson A.J.\n\nGonzalez G.A.\n\net al.\n\nNiche stiffness underlies the ageing of central nervous system progenitor cells.\n\n), change during aging. This section examines recent advances in our understanding of how age-related changes in the niche (e.g., systemic or local extracellular cues or other cell types) can influence and contribute to the decrease in neurogenesis during aging (summarized in Figure 3). Although many of the mechanisms that underlie the NSC response to these extrinsic cues are not yet known, they are likely to impinge on the intrinsic pathways described above to affect NSC function. In the future, it will be interesting to better understand the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic regulators of NSC aging.\n\nSystemic Blood Factors and Local Factors\n\nSystemic factors in the blood play an important role in NSC aging. Heterochronic parabiosis studies, in which the circulatory system of a young and an old mouse are joined, have revealed positive and negative effects of young and old blood on neurogenesis in the DG (\n\nRebo et al., 2016\n\nRebo J.\n\nMehdipour M.\n\nGathwala R.\n\nCausey K.\n\nLiu Y.\n\nConboy M.J.\n\nConboy I.M.\n\nA single heterochronic blood exchange reveals rapid inhibition of multiple tissues by old blood.\n\n;\n\nVilleda et al., 2011\n\nVilleda S.A.\n\nLuo J.\n\nMosher K.I.\n\nZou B.\n\nBritschgi M.\n\nBieri G.\n\nStan T.M.\n\nFainberg N.\n\nDing Z.\n\nEggel A.\n\net al.\n\nThe ageing systemic milieu negatively regulates neurogenesis and cognitive function.\n\n) and SVZ neurogenic niches (\n\nKatsimpardi et al., 2014\n\nKatsimpardi L.\n\nLitterman N.K.\n\nSchein P.A.\n\nMiller C.M.\n\nLoffredo F.S.\n\nWojtkiewicz G.R.\n\nChen J.W.\n\nLee R.T.\n\nWagers A.J.\n\nRubin L.L.\n\nVascular and neurogenic rejuvenation of the aging mouse brain by young systemic factors.\n\n). A variety of systemic factors and signaling pathways mediating these effects have been identified, many of which are immune related.

In contrast, GDF11, a circulating transforming growth factor, appears to be present at higher levels in young blood and to have positive effects on old SVZ NSCs (\n\nKatsimpardi et al., 2014\n\nKatsimpardi L.\n\nLitterman N.K.\n\nSchein P.A.\n\nMiller C.M.\n\nLoffredo F.S.\n\nWojtkiewicz G.R.\n\nChen J.W.\n\nLee R.T.\n\nWagers A.J.\n\nRubin L.L.\n\nVascular and neurogenic rejuvenation of the aging mouse brain by young systemic factors.\n\n), but the extent of GDF11 rejuvenating properties remain unclear (\n\nEgerman et al., 2015\n\nEgerman M.A.\n\nCadena S.M.\n\nGilbert J.A.\n\nMeyer A.\n\nNelson H.N.\n\nSwalley S.E.\n\nMallozzi C.\n\nJacobi C.\n\nJennings L.L.\n\nClay I.\n\net al.\n\nGDF11 Increases with Age and Inhibits Skeletal Muscle Regeneration.\n\n;\n\nSmith et al., 2015b\n\nSmith S.C.\n\nZhang X.\n\nZhang X.\n\nGross P.\n\nStarosta T.\n\nMohsin S.\n\nFranti M.\n\nGupta P.\n\nHayes D.\n\nMyzithras M.\n\net al.\n\nGDF11 does not rescue aging-related pathological hypertrophy.\n\n). TIMP2, a metalloproteinase inhibitor found in human umbilical cord plasma, improves synaptic plasticity and cognition when injected systemically into old mice (\n\nCastellano et al., 2017\n\nCastellano J.M.\n\nMosher K.I.\n\nAbbey R.J.\n\nMcBride A.A.\n\nJames M.L.\n\nBerdnik D.\n\nShen J.C.\n\nZou B.\n\nXie X.S.\n\nTingle M.\n\net al.\n\nHuman umbilical cord plasma proteins revitalize hippocampal function in aged mice.\n\n). However, the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus is unchanged upon TIMP2 injection, suggesting that this factor acts independent of neurogenesis, perhaps by changing the properties of the extracellular matrix (\n\nCastellano et al., 2017\n\nCastellano J.M.\n\nMosher K.I.\n\nAbbey R.J.\n\nMcBride A.A.\n\nJames M.L.\n\nBerdnik D.\n\nShen J.C.\n\nZou B.\n\nXie X.S.\n\nTingle M.\n\net al.\n\nHuman umbilical cord plasma proteins revitalize hippocampal function in aged mice.\n\n). It also remains to be determined whether these factors mediate their effects on neurogenesis by acting directly on niche cells or indirectly by shifting the niche milieu toward a less inflammatory state. In addition to systemic factors, local morphogens, including Notch, Wnt, sonic hedgehog, and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), are critical during embryonic development, and they also regulate NSCs throughout life (reviewed in\n\nBond et al., 2015\n\nBond A.M.\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nAdult Mammalian Neural Stem Cells and Neurogenesis: Five Decades Later.\n\n;\n\nMing and Song, 2011\n\nMing G.L.\n\nSong H.\n\nAdult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain: significant answers and significant questions.\n\n). Upregulating Wnt signaling in the hippocampus can counteract the age-related decrease in neurogenesis and its associated cognitive decline (\n\nSeib et al., 2013\n\nSeib D.R.\n\nCorsini N.S.\n\nEllwanger K.\n\nPlaas C.\n\nMateos A.\n\nPitzer C.\n\nNiehrs C.\n\nCelikel T.\n\nMartin-Villalba A.\n\nLoss of Dickkopf-1 restores neurogenesis in old age and counteracts cognitive decline.\n\n). Notch signaling also plays an important role in maintaining NSC quiescence and activation in SVZ and hippocampal niches (\n\nBasak et al., 2012\n\nBasak O.\n\nGiachino C.\n\nFiorini E.\n\nMacdonald H.R.\n\nTaylor V.\n\nNeurogenic subventricular zone stem/progenitor cells are Notch1-dependent in their active but not quiescent state.\n\n;\n\nBlomfield et al., 2019\n\nBlomfield I.M.\n\nRocamonde B.\n\nMasdeu M.D.M.\n\nMulugeta E.\n\nVaga S.\n\nvan den Berg D.L.\n\nHuillard E.\n\nGuillemot F.\n\nUrbán N.\n\nId4 promotes the elimination of the pro-activation factor Ascl1 to maintain quiescence of adult hippocampal stem cells.\n\n;\n\nEngler et al., 2018\n\nEngler A.\n\nRolando C.\n\nGiachino C.\n\nSaotome I.\n\nErni A.\n\nBrien C.\n\nZhang R.\n\nZimber-Strobl U.\n\nRadtke F.\n\nArtavanis-Tsakonas S.\n\net al.\n\nNotch2 Signaling Maintains NSC Quiescence in the Murine Ventricular-Subventricular Zone.\n\n;\n\nZhang et al., 2019\n\nZhang R.\n\nBoareto M.\n\nEngler A.\n\nLouvi A.\n\nGiachino C.\n\nIber D.\n\nTaylor V.\n\nId4 Downstream of Notch2 Maintains Neural Stem Cell Quiescence in the Adult Hippocampus.\n\n) and could be critical during aging.\n\nThe Choroid Plexus and CSF\n\nThe choroid plexus is a monolayer of epithelial cells in the brain ventricles that produces CSF (\n\nJohanson et al., 2011\n\nJohanson C.E.\n\nStopa E.G.\n\nMcMillan P.N.\n\nThe blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier: structure and functional significance.\n\n) and constitutes the blood-CSF barrier, integrating signals from both systems. Analysis of the effects of the lateral ventricle choroid plexus secretome on the growth of freshly purified NSCs in vitro revealed that aNSCs from the SVZ are very sensitive to age-related changes in secreted factors from the choroid plexus (\n\nSilva-Vargas et al., 2016\n\nSilva-Vargas V.\n\nMaldonado-Soto A.R.\n\nMizrak D.\n\nCodega P.\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nAge-Dependent Niche Signals from the Choroid Plexus Regulate Adult Neural Stem Cells.\n\n). Specifically, factors that can induce NSC proliferation, such BMP5 and IGF1, are depleted from the choroid plexus secretome of old mice (\n\nSilva-Vargas et al., 2016\n\nSilva-Vargas V.\n\nMaldonado-Soto A.R.\n\nMizrak D.\n\nCodega P.\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nAge-Dependent Niche Signals from the Choroid Plexus Regulate Adult Neural Stem Cells.\n\n). The aged choroid plexus also exhibits an expression profile corresponding to a type I interferon (IFN-I) response (i.e., IFNα and IFNβ) (\n\nBaruch et al., 2014\n\nBaruch K.\n\nDeczkowska A.\n\nDavid E.\n\nCastellano J.M.\n\nMiller O.\n\nKertser A.\n\nBerkutzki T.\n\nBarnett-Itzhaki Z.\n\nBezalel D.\n\nWyss-Coray T.\n\net al.\n\nAging. Aging-induced type I interferon response at the choroid plexus negatively affects brain function.\n\n). Notably, blocking IFN-I signaling by delivery of antibodies against the IFNα receptor into the CSF improves hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in old mice (\n\nBaruch et al., 2014\n\nBaruch K.\n\nDeczkowska A.\n\nDavid E.\n\nCastellano J.M.\n\nMiller O.\n\nKertser A.\n\nBerkutzki T.\n\nBarnett-Itzhaki Z.\n\nBezalel D.\n\nWyss-Coray T.\n\net al.\n\nAging. Aging-induced type I interferon response at the choroid plexus negatively affects brain function.\n\n). Hypothalamic NSCs can secrete exosomes into the CSF at the third ventricle (\n\nZhang et al., 2017\n\nZhang Y.\n\nKim M.S.\n\nJia B.\n\nYan J.\n\nZuniga-Hertz J.P.\n\nHan C.\n\nCai D.\n\nHypothalamic stem cells control ageing speed partly through exosomal miRNAs.\n\n). Thus, NSCs in the hypothalamic niche may not only be influenced by the CSF but may also contribute to systemic changes that affect the aging process (\n\nZhang et al., 2017\n\nZhang Y.\n\nKim M.S.\n\nJia B.\n\nYan J.\n\nZuniga-Hertz J.P.\n\nHan C.\n\nCai D.\n\nHypothalamic stem cells control ageing speed partly through exosomal miRNAs.\n\n). The choroid plexus and CSF play a crucial role, relaying changes in the brain environment, including inflammatory signals during aging, to the NSC niche.\n\nEndothelial Cells and Pericytes\n\nThe brain’s vasculature (endothelial cells and surrounding pericytes) forms a tightly regulated interface between the circulatory system and the brain parenchyma, known as the blood-brain barrier. Recent studies have shown that the transcriptome of endothelial cells in the neurogenic niche changes dramatically with age, shifting toward an inflammatory transcriptomic profile (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n;\n\nKalamakis et al., 2019\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nBrune D.\n\nRavichandran S.\n\nBolz J.\n\nFan W.\n\nZiebell F.\n\nStiehl T.\n\nCatala-Martinez F.\n\nKupke J.\n\nZhao S.\n\net al.\n\nQuiescence Modulates Stem Cell Maintenance and Regenerative Capacity in the Aging Brain.\n\n;\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n;\n\nYousef et al., 2019\n\nYousef H.\n\nCzupalla C.J.\n\nLee D.\n\nChen M.B.\n\nBurke A.N.\n\nZera K.A.\n\nZandstra J.\n\nBerber E.\n\nLehallier B.\n\nMathur V.\n\net al.\n\nAged blood impairs hippocampal neural precursor activity and activates microglia via brain endothelial cell VCAM1.\n\n). Endothelial cells and pericytes can secrete factors, such as placental growth factor 2 (PlGF-2), that promote proliferation of NSCs isolated from the SVZ of young mice (\n\nCrouch et al., 2015\n\nCrouch E.E.\n\nLiu C.\n\nSilva-Vargas V.\n\nDoetsch F.\n\nRegional and stage-specific effects of prospectively purified vascular cells on the adult V-SVZ neural stem cell lineage.\n\n). However, in middle-aged mice, endothelial cells start producing increased levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), an inflammatory cytokine that triggers NSC apoptosis via TGF-β and SMAD3 signaling (\n\nPineda et al., 2013\n\nPineda J.R.\n\nDaynac M.\n\nChicheportiche A.\n\nCebrian-Silla A.\n\nSii Felice K.\n\nGarcia-Verdugo J.M.\n\nBoussin F.D.\n\nMouthon M.A.\n\nVascular-derived TGF-β increases in the stem cell niche and perturbs neurogenesis during aging and following irradiation in the adult mouse brain.\n\n). Consistently, genetic or pharmacological attenuation of the TGF-β pathway can rescue neurogenesis in old mice (\n\nYousef et al., 2015\n\nYousef H.\n\nConboy M.J.\n\nMorgenthaler A.\n\nSchlesinger C.\n\nBugaj L.\n\nPaliwal P.\n\nGreer C.\n\nConboy I.M.\n\nSchaffer D.\n\nSystemic attenuation of the TGF-β pathway by a single drug simultaneously rejuvenates hippocampal neurogenesis and myogenesis in the same old mammal.\n\n). Endothelial cells also display focal upregulation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM1) in old brains (\n\nYousef et al., 2019\n\nYousef H.\n\nCzupalla C.J.\n\nLee D.\n\nChen M.B.\n\nBurke A.N.\n\nZera K.A.\n\nZandstra J.\n\nBerber E.\n\nLehallier B.\n\nMathur V.\n\net al.\n\nAged blood impairs hippocampal neural precursor activity and activates microglia via brain endothelial cell VCAM1.\n\n). Decreasing VCAM1 levels in endothelial cells, genetically or via systemic anti-VCAM1 antibodies, reverses the negative effects of old plasma in the young brain and increases the number of NSCs in the hippocampus of old mice (\n\nYousef et al., 2019\n\nYousef H.\n\nCzupalla C.J.\n\nLee D.\n\nChen M.B.\n\nBurke A.N.\n\nZera K.A.\n\nZandstra J.\n\nBerber E.\n\nLehallier B.\n\nMathur V.\n\net al.\n\nAged blood impairs hippocampal neural precursor activity and activates microglia via brain endothelial cell VCAM1.\n\n). Although VCAM1 is normally known for facilitating vascular-immune cell interactions (\n\nOsborn et al., 1989\n\nOsborn L.\n\nHession C.\n\nTizard R.\n\nVassallo C.\n\nLuhowskyj S.\n\nChi-Rosso G.\n\nLobb R.\n\nDirect expression cloning of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, a cytokine-induced endothelial protein that binds to lymphocytes.\n\n;\n\nSchlesinger and Bendas, 2015\n\nSchlesinger M.\n\nBendas G.\n\nVascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)--an increasing insight into its role in tumorigenicity and metastasis.\n\n), during aging, VCAM1 may allow tethering of blood cells to endothelial cells but not their transport, and this may induce chronic inflammation of endothelial cells (\n\nYousef et al., 2019\n\nYousef H.\n\nCzupalla C.J.\n\nLee D.\n\nChen M.B.\n\nBurke A.N.\n\nZera K.A.\n\nZandstra J.\n\nBerber E.\n\nLehallier B.\n\nMathur V.\n\net al.\n\nAged blood impairs hippocampal neural precursor activity and activates microglia via brain endothelial cell VCAM1.\n\n). The inflamed state of endothelial cells could, in turn, lead to microglia activation (see below), inhibition of NSC proliferation, and cognitive impairment (\n\nYousef et al., 2019\n\nYousef H.\n\nCzupalla C.J.\n\nLee D.\n\nChen M.B.\n\nBurke A.N.\n\nZera K.A.\n\nZandstra J.\n\nBerber E.\n\nLehallier B.\n\nMathur V.\n\net al.\n\nAged blood impairs hippocampal neural precursor activity and activates microglia via brain endothelial cell VCAM1.\n\n). Thus, restoring endothelial cell function in old brains may help to reduce inflammation, ameliorate NSC decline, and improve brain function.\n\nMicroglia\n\nMicroglia are the resident immune cells of the brain. These cells patrol the brain parenchyma, maintaining homeostasis through engulfment and degradation of extracellular materials via phagocytosis. The phagocytic activity of microglia helps to maintain homeostasis in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche by removing newborn NPCs that undergo apoptosis before becoming neuroblasts (\n\nSierra et al., 2010\n\nSierra A.\n\nEncinas J.M.\n\nDeudero J.J.\n\nChancey J.H.\n\nEnikolopov G.\n\nOverstreet-Wadiche L.S.\n\nTsirka S.E.\n\nMaletic-Savatic M.\n\nMicroglia shape adult hippocampal neurogenesis through apoptosis-coupled phagocytosis.\n\n). Furthermore, the secretome of phagocytic microglia limits production of new neurons in hippocampal NSC cultures and when injected directly into the hippocampus of young adult mice (\n\nDiaz-Aparicio et al., 2020\n\nDiaz-Aparicio I.\n\nParis I.\n\nSierra-Torre V.\n\nPlaza-Zabala A.\n\nRodríguez-Iglesias N.\n\nMárquez-Ropero M.\n\nBeccari S.\n\nHuguet P.\n\nAbiega O.\n\nAlberdi E.\n\net al.\n\nMicroglia Actively Remodel Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis through the Phagocytosis Secretome.\n\n). However, during aging, microglial phagocytosis is impaired (\n\nMarschallinger et al., 2020\n\nMarschallinger J.\n\nIram T.\n\nZardeneta M.\n\nLee S.E.\n\nLehallier B.\n\nHaney M.S.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\nMathur V.\n\nHahn O.\n\nMorgens D.W.\n\net al.\n\nLipid-droplet-accumulating microglia represent a dysfunctional and proinflammatory state in the aging brain.\n\n;\n\nPluvinage et al., 2019\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\nHaney M.S.\n\nSmith B.A.H.\n\nSun J.\n\nIram T.\n\nBonanno L.\n\nLi L.\n\nLee D.P.\n\nMorgens D.W.\n\nYang A.C.\n\net al.\n\nCD22 blockade restores homeostatic microglial phagocytosis in ageing brains.\n\n) which may contribute to accumulation of debris and aggregates in the niche and may perturb NSC niche homeostasis. Microglia also normally support neurogenesis in the hippocampus and SVZ through production of growth factors and cytokines in young animals (\n\nShigemoto-Mogami et al., 2014\n\nShigemoto-Mogami Y.\n\nHoshikawa K.\n\nGoldman J.E.\n\nSekino Y.\n\nSato K.\n\nMicroglia enhance neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the early postnatal subventricular zone.\n\n;\n\nZiv and Schwartz, 2008\n\nZiv Y.\n\nSchwartz M.\n\nImmune-based regulation of adult neurogenesis: implications for learning and memory.\n\n). Sustained inflammation during aging leads to increased microglial activation (i.e., proliferative microglia secreting inflammatory cytokines) and subsequent reduction in NSC proliferation in the SVZ and hippocampus (\n\nBachstetter et al., 2011\n\nBachstetter A.D.\n\nMorganti J.M.\n\nJernberg J.\n\nSchlunk A.\n\nMitchell S.H.\n\nBrewster K.W.\n\nHudson C.E.\n\nCole M.J.\n\nHarrison J.K.\n\nBickford P.C.\n\nGemma C.\n\nFractalkine and CX 3 CR1 regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in adult and aged rats.\n\n;\n\nMonje et al., 2003\n\nMonje M.L.\n\nToda H.\n\nPalmer T.D.\n\nInflammatory blockade restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis.\n\n;\n\nSolano Fonseca et al., 2016\n\nSolano Fonseca R.\n\nMahesula S.\n\nApple D.M.\n\nRaghunathan R.\n\nDugan A.\n\nCardona A.\n\nO’Connor J.\n\nKokovay E.\n\nNeurogenic Niche Microglia Undergo Positional Remodeling and Progressive Activation Contributing to Age-Associated Reductions in Neurogenesis.\n\n). Therefore, improving microglial function in old brains might not only boost the function of other cells (e.g., NSCs) in the niche but also actively promote clearance and reduce infiltration of immune cells in the niche.\n\nInfiltration of T Cells\n\nThe brain has long been regarded as an immune-privileged organ, especially under physiological conditions. Interestingly, however, immune cells, such as T cells, infiltrate the brain of old individuals in mice and humans (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n;\n\nMrdjen et al., 2018\n\nMrdjen D.\n\nPavlovic A.\n\nHartmann F.J.\n\nSchreiner B.\n\nUtz S.G.\n\nLeung B.P.\n\nLelios I.\n\nHeppner F.L.\n\nKipnis J.\n\nMerkler D.\n\net al.\n\nHigh-Dimensional Single-Cell Mapping of Central Nervous System Immune Cells Reveals Distinct Myeloid Subsets in Health, Aging, and Disease.\n\n;\n\nRitzel et al., 2016\n\nRitzel R.M.\n\nCrapser J.\n\nPatel A.R.\n\nVerma R.\n\nGrenier J.M.\n\nChauhan A.\n\nJellison E.R.\n\nMcCullough L.D.\n\nAge-Associated Resident Memory CD8 T Cells in the Central Nervous System Are Primed To Potentiate Inflammation after Ischemic Brain Injury.\n\n). Single-cell RNA-seq of the entire SVZ niche revealed infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the old SVZ, which was confirmed by immunocytochemistry in aged mice and elderly humans (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n). T cell receptor sequencing showed that brain T cells are clonally expanded (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n), suggesting that they may recognize specific antigens in the brain rather than passively diffuse through a disrupted aged blood-brain barrier (\n\nMontagne et al., 2015\n\nMontagne A.\n\nBarnes S.R.\n\nSweeney M.D.\n\nHalliday M.R.\n\nSagare A.P.\n\nZhao Z.\n\nToga A.W.\n\nJacobs R.E.\n\nLiu C.Y.\n\nAmezcua L.\n\net al.\n\nBlood-brain barrier breakdown in the aging human hippocampus.\n\n). These T cells may be attracted to the old neurogenic niche by a combination of brain-specific antigens and chemokines. An exciting possibility is that they may recognize neo-antigens derived from aggregated proteins in old NSCs (\n\nLeeman et al., 2018\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nRuetz T.\n\nWebb A.E.\n\nMcKay A.\n\nPollina E.A.\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nZhao X.\n\nYeo R.W.\n\nHo T.T.\n\net al.\n\nLysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging.\n\n). This is the case in Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis, where T cells recognize α-synuclein (\n\nSulzer et al., 2017\n\nSulzer D.\n\nAlcalay R.N.\n\nGarretti F.\n\nCote L.\n\nKanter E.\n\nAgin-Liebes J.\n\nLiong C.\n\nMcMurtrey C.\n\nHildebrand W.H.\n\nMao X.\n\net al.\n\nT cells from patients with Parkinson’s disease recognize α-synuclein peptides.\n\n) and β-synuclein (\n\nLodygin et al., 2019\n\nLodygin D.\n\nHermann M.\n\nSchweingruber N.\n\nFlügel-Koch C.\n\nWatanabe T.\n\nSchlosser C.\n\nMerlini A.\n\nKörner H.\n\nChang H.F.\n\nFischer H.J.\n\net al.\n\nβ-Synuclein-reactive T cells induce autoimmune CNS grey matter degeneration.\n\n), respectively.\n\nInfiltrating T cells are the main cellular source of IFNγ in the SVZ niche (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n). IFNγ is known to act as an antiproliferative agent in the adult neurogenic niche, suggesting that accumulation of T cells might contribute to age-related neurogenic decline (\n\nLi et al., 2010b\n\nLi L.\n\nWalker T.L.\n\nZhang Y.\n\nMackay E.W.\n\nBartlett P.F.\n\nEndogenous interferon gamma directly regulates neural precursors in the non-inflammatory brain.\n\n;\n\nPereira et al., 2015\n\nPereira L.\n\nMedina R.\n\nBaena M.\n\nPlanas A.M.\n\nPozas E.\n\nIFN gamma regulates proliferation and neuronal differentiation by STAT1 in adult SVZ niche.\n\n). Indeed, the IFN response is associated with a decline in NSC proliferation in the SVZ (\n\nDulken et al., 2019\n\nDulken B.W.\n\nBuckley M.T.\n\nNavarro Negredo P.\n\nSaligrama N.\n\nCayrol R.\n\nLeeman D.S.\n\nGeorge B.M.\n\nBoutet S.C.\n\nHebestreit K.\n\nPluvinage J.V.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell analysis reveals T cell infiltration in old neurogenic niches.\n\n). Interestingly, inhibition of IFN signaling (using IFNα and IFNγ receptor knockout mice) results in higher proliferating NSC numbers in the SVZ of old animals (\n\nKalamakis et al., 2019\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nBrune D.\n\nRavichandran S.\n\nBolz J.\n\nFan W.\n\nZiebell F.\n\nStiehl T.\n\nCatala-Martinez F.\n\nKupke J.\n\nZhao S.\n\net al.\n\nQuiescence Modulates Stem Cell Maintenance and Regenerative Capacity in the Aging Brain.\n\n). Similarly, inhibition of the chemokine CXCL10, which is released in response to IFNγ, decreases the number of qNSCs and increases production of neuroblasts in old SVZ neurogenic niches, providing a causal link between inflammation and the inability of NSCs to activate in the old brain (\n\nKalamakis et al., 2019\n\nKalamakis G.\n\nBrune D.\n\nRavichandran S.\n\nBolz J.\n\nFan W.\n\nZiebell F.\n\nStiehl T.\n\nCatala-Martinez F.\n\nKupke J.\n\nZhao S.\n\net al.\n\nQuiescence Modulates Stem Cell Maintenance and Regenerative Capacity in the Aging Brain.\n\n). Thus, although infiltrating T cells may have beneficial effects during development (hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities are significantly decreased in T cell-deficient mice in early adulthood;\n\nWolf et al., 2009\n\nWolf S.A.\n\nSteiner B.\n\nAkpinarli A.\n\nKammertoens T.\n\nNassenstein C.\n\nBraun A.\n\nBlankenstein T.\n\nKempermann G.\n\nCD4-positive T lymphocytes provide a neuroimmunological link in the control of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.\n\n;\n\nZiv et al., 2006\n\nZiv Y.\n\nRon N.\n\nButovsky O.\n\nLanda G.\n\nSudai E.\n\nGreenberg N.\n\nCohen H.\n\nKipnis J.\n\nSchwartz M.\n\nImmune cells contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood.\n\n), they may have a detrimental effect on NSCs during aging, in part by secreting inflammatory cytokines.\n\nIt will be interesting to determine the relationship between infiltrating T cells and NSCs during development and aging and the potential shift from a protective role during development to a detrimental, possibly cytotoxic effect of T cells in the inflamed old brain. It will also be important to explore how the different neurogenic niches respond to immune cell infiltration and inflammatory signals. For example, the proinflammatory pathway involving Iκβ kinase (IKKβ) and the downstream nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) impairs survival, proliferation, and differentiation of adult NSCs in the hypothalamic neurogenic niche and results in obesity and pre-diabetes in mice (\n\nLi et al., 2012\n\nLi J.\n\nTang Y.\n\nCai D.\n\nIKKβ/NF-κB disrupts adult hypothalamic neural stem cells to mediate a neurodegenerative mechanism of dietary obesity and pre-diabetes.\n\n). Thus, blocking T cells or reducing inflammation levels in old neurogenic niches could be an effective strategy to restore old brain function.\n\nMeningeal Lymphatic Vessels and the Glymphatic System\n\nThe brain contains dorsal and basal lymphatic vessels in the meninges that assist with drainage of CSF components and meningeal immune cells into the cervical lymph nodes (\n\nAhn et al., 2019\n\nAhn J.H.\n\nCho H.\n\nKim J.H.\n\nKim S.H.\n\nHam J.S.\n\nPark I.\n\nSuh S.H.\n\nHong S.P.\n\nSong J.H.\n\nHong Y.K.\n\net al.\n\nMeningeal lymphatic vessels at the skull base drain cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n;\n\nDa Mesquita et al., 2018\n\nDa Mesquita S.\n\nLouveau A.\n\nVaccari A.\n\nSmirnov I.\n\nCornelison R.C.\n\nKingsmore K.M.\n\nContarino C.\n\nOnengut-Gumuscu S.\n\nFarber E.\n\nRaper D.\n\net al.\n\nFunctional aspects of meningeal lymphatics in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n;\n\nLouveau et al., 2015\n\nLouveau A.\n\nHarris T.H.\n\nKipnis J.\n\nRevisiting the Mechanisms of CNS Immune Privilege.\n\n). In addition, the “glymphatic” system, a glia-associated lymphatic system (\n\nAspelund et al., 2015\n\nAspelund A.\n\nAntila S.\n\nProulx S.T.\n\nKarlsen T.V.\n\nKaraman S.\n\nDetmar M.\n\nWiig H.\n\nAlitalo K.\n\nA dural lymphatic vascular system that drains brain interstitial fluid and macromolecules.\n\n), is likely connected to lymphatic vessels (\n\nLouveau et al., 2017\n\nLouveau A.\n\nPlog B.A.\n\nAntila S.\n\nAlitalo K.\n\nNedergaard M.\n\nKipnis J.\n\nUnderstanding the functions and relationships of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatics.\n\n) and has been shown to be involved in β-amyloid clearance (\n\nXie et al., 2013\n\nXie L.\n\nKang H.\n\nXu Q.\n\nChen M.J.\n\nLiao Y.\n\nThiyagarajan M.\n\nO’Donnell J.\n\nChristensen D.J.\n\nNicholson C.\n\nIliff J.J.\n\net al.\n\nSleep drives metabolite clearance from the adult brain.\n\n). Meningeal lymphatic vessels and the glymphatic system provide a new potential link between the CNS and the peripheral immune system. Interestingly, the meningeal lymphatic system also declines functionally during aging (\n\nAhn et al., 2019\n\nAhn J.H.\n\nCho H.\n\nKim J.H.\n\nKim S.H.\n\nHam J.S.\n\nPark I.\n\nSuh S.H.\n\nHong S.P.\n\nSong J.H.\n\nHong Y.K.\n\net al.\n\nMeningeal lymphatic vessels at the skull base drain cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n;\n\nDa Mesquita et al., 2018\n\nDa Mesquita S.\n\nLouveau A.\n\nVaccari A.\n\nSmirnov I.\n\nCornelison R.C.\n\nKingsmore K.M.\n\nContarino C.\n\nOnengut-Gumuscu S.\n\nFarber E.\n\nRaper D.\n\net al.\n\nFunctional aspects of meningeal lymphatics in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n), and disrupting meningeal lymphatic vessels with a photodynamic drug (Visudyne) results in cognitive impairments in young mice (\n\nDa Mesquita et al., 2018\n\nDa Mesquita S.\n\nLouveau A.\n\nVaccari A.\n\nSmirnov I.\n\nCornelison R.C.\n\nKingsmore K.M.\n\nContarino C.\n\nOnengut-Gumuscu S.\n\nFarber E.\n\nRaper D.\n\net al.\n\nFunctional aspects of meningeal lymphatics in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n). Although enhancing meningeal lymphatics improves aspects of learning and memory in old mice, it does not increase the number of dividing NSCs in the hippocampus of these mice (\n\nDa Mesquita et al., 2018\n\nDa Mesquita S.\n\nLouveau A.\n\nVaccari A.\n\nSmirnov I.\n\nCornelison R.C.\n\nKingsmore K.M.\n\nContarino C.\n\nOnengut-Gumuscu S.\n\nFarber E.\n\nRaper D.\n\net al.\n\nFunctional aspects of meningeal lymphatics in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n). Nonetheless, it will be exciting to determine how meningeal lymphatic vessels and the glymphatic system interact and integrate with the neurogenic niche to influence the function of NSCs and other niche cells during aging.\n\nEpendymal Cells\n\nEpendymal cells form a layer of epithelial multiciliated cells that line the brain’s ventricular walls. The coordinated beating of ependymal cilia contributes to CSF dynamics, which is crucial for exposure of NSCs to trophic factors and metabolites and for clearance of waste and toxins from the brain (\n\nSpassky and Meunier, 2017\n\nSpassky N.\n\nMeunier A.\n\nThe development and functions of multiciliated epithelia.\n\n). Although qNSCs and ependymal cells derive from a common radial glial cell progenitor during development (\n\nOrtiz-Alvarez et al., 2019\n\nOrtiz-Alvarez G.\n\nDaclin M.\n\nShihavuddin A.\n\nLansade P.\n\nFortoul A.\n\nFaucourt M.\n\nClavreul S.\n\nLalioti M.E.\n\nTaraviras S.\n\nHippenmeyer S.\n\net al.\n\nAdult Neural Stem Cells and Multiciliated Ependymal Cells Share a Common Lineage Regulated by the Geminin Family Members..\n\n;\n\nSpassky et al., 2005\n\nSpassky N.\n\nMerkle F.T.\n\nFlames N.\n\nTramontin A.D.\n\nGarcía-Verdugo J.M.\n\nAlvarez-Buylla A.\n\nAdult ependymal cells are postmitotic and are derived from radial glial cells during embryogenesis.\n\n) and share phenotypic markers (SOX2, SOX9, NESTIN, and CD133), these two cell types have different morphologies and functions in the adult brain. Ependymal cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) as a marker are transcriptionally different from NSCs and do not proliferate in vitro or in vivo under pro-growth conditions that normally induce NSCs proliferation (\n\nShah et al., 2018\n\nShah P.T.\n\nStratton J.A.\n\nStykel M.G.\n\nAbbasi S.\n\nSharma S.\n\nMayr K.A.\n\nKoblinger K.\n\nWhelan P.J.\n\nBiernaskie J.\n\nSingle-Cell Transcriptomics and Fate Mapping of Ependymal Cells Reveals an Absence of Neural Stem Cell Function.\n\n). Single-cell RNA-seq confirmed that ependymal cells do not have NSC function (\n\nShah et al., 2018\n\nShah P.T.\n\nStratton J.A.\n\nStykel M.G.\n\nAbbasi S.\n\nSharma S.\n\nMayr K.A.\n\nKoblinger K.\n\nWhelan P.J.\n\nBiernaskie J.\n\nSingle-Cell Transcriptomics and Fate Mapping of Ependymal Cells Reveals an Absence of Neural Stem Cell Function.\n\n). However, modulation of CSF dynamics by ependymal cell cilia can affect NSC function and neurogenesis, and this could be critical during aging. For example, beating of ependymal cilia is required for directional migration of neuroblasts toward the olfactory bulb in mice (\n\nSawamoto et al., 2006\n\nSawamoto K.\n\nWichterle H.\n\nGonzalez-Perez O.\n\nCholfin J.A.\n\nYamada M.\n\nSpassky N.\n\nMurcia N.S.\n\nGarcia-Verdugo J.M.\n\nMarin O.\n\nRubenstein J.L.\n\net al.\n\nNew neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain.\n\n).
