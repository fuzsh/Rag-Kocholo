        "text": "Track: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS007\n\nOscillating Machinery of a Circadian Clock\n\nAndy LiWang\n\nUniversity of California, Merced (United States)\n\nCircadian clocks provide a biochemical representation of local time inside cells and control the timing of gene expression in anticipation of sunrise and sunset. In cyanobacteria, a circadian oscillator comprised of three Kai proteins — KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC — relay temporal information downstream through two kinases, SasA and CikA, to regulate the transcription factor RpaA. Identifying the mechanisms by which circadian clocks exert temporal control over gene expression has been challenging in the complex milieu of cells. Thus, we reassembled an intact clock including oscillator and signal transduction components under defined conditions in vitro. Together with structural studies and biochemical analyses of partial clock reactions, we acquired new insights into mechanisms by which the cyanobacterial circadian clock functions to control gene expression. The in vitro oscillator is known to function under a relatively narrow set of Kai protein concentrations; we show here that a KaiABC-only mixture that fails to oscillate in a sustained manner due to limiting levels of KaiB can be rescued by SasA, which acts to recruit KaiB to the KaiC hexamer through heterotropic cooperativity. Cooperativity is based on structural mimicry between SasA and KaiB, and mutations that eliminate heterocooperativity in vitro profoundly affect circadian rhythms in vivo. CikA also rescues period defects under low levels of KaiA; together, our data help explain how the clock compensates in vivo for changes in concentrations of oscillator components that occur as part of the transcription-translation feedback loop and protein turnover. The coupling between oscillator and input-output components blurs their distinction. We developed the in vitro clock to establish causal links between clock biochemistry and in vivo phenotypes, and it provides a platform to explore how changes in factors such as temperature or ATP levels are propagated to regulate transcription.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS021\n\nA comprehensive structural view of target recognition in the Streptococcus Class A sortase catalytic mechanism\n\nJeanine Amacher, Alex Johnson, Isabel Piper, Brandon Vogel, Sophie Jackson, Justin Svendsen, Hanna Kodama, Jay McCarty, John Antos\n\nWestern Washington University (United States)\n\nThe cell wall is a critical extracellular barrier for bacteria and many other organisms. In bacteria, this structural layer is comprised of peptidoglycan, which maintains cell shape and integrity and provides a scaffold for displaying various protein factors. To attach proteins to the cell wall, gram-positive bacteria utilize sortase enzymes, which are cysteine transpeptidases that recognize and cleave a specific sorting signal, followed by ligation of the sorting signal-containing protein to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II. This mechanism is the subject of considerable interest as a target for therapeutic intervention and as a tool for protein engineering, where sortases have enabled sortase mediated ligation or sortagging strategies. Despite these uses, there remains an incomplete understanding of the stereochemistry of substrate recognition and ligation product formation. Here, we solved the first structures of sortase A from Streptococcus pyogenes (spySrtA) bound to two substrate sequences, LPATA and LPATS. In addition, we synthesized a mimetic of the product of sortase-mediated ligation involving lipid II (LPAT-lipid II), and solved the complex structure in two ligand conformations. These structures were further used as the basis for molecular dynamics simulations to probe SrtA ligand dynamics and to construct a model of the acyl enzyme intermediate, thus providing a complete structural view of key states in the catalytic mechanism. Overall, this structural information provides new insights into the recognition of the sortase substrate motif and lipid II ligation partner and will support the continued development of sortases for protein engineering applications.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS022\n\nFilamentation/Polymerization as a Novel Wide-Spread and Evolutionarily Conserved Enzyme Regulatory Mechanism\n\nNancy Horton, Niloofar Ghadirian, Dmitry Lyumkis, Zelin Shan\n\nUniversity of Arizona (United States)\n\nWe use a model system, the sequence dependent endonuclease SgrAI, to investigate important mechanistic and biological questions regarding enzyme filamentation and enzyme regulation. SgrAI forms structured assemblies of heterogeneous stoichiometries under conditions where its DNA cleavage activity is 200-1000 fold accelerated, and surprisingly, its DNA sequence specificity is altered (Biochem. 49, 8818). We have shown that these assemblies are helical filaments composed of SgrAI (Biochem. 52, 4373, Structure 21, 1848), and have proposed hypotheses for 1) how filamentation activates the DNA cleavage activity of SgrAI, as well as 2) how filamentation modulates the enzyme's DNA sequence specificity using the sequence specific energy of DNA distortions (Structure 27, 1). We have also carried out a complete kinetic investigation to create a full computational model of the entire DNA cleavage pathway including filamentation and all forward and reverse rate constants for each step (JBC 293, 14585 & 14599). This model has allowed us to predict the behavior of SgrAI within a cell, at biologically relevant concentrations, and showed that the filamentation mechanism, and in particular the slow filament assembly step, allows SgrAI to target invading DNA while minimizing damage to its host genome (J. Virol. 93, e01647). We now present new Cryo-EM structural data supporting the hypothesis that filamentation stabilizes a conformation of SgrAI where a second divalent cation binds in the active site, thereby enhancing the rate of DNA cleavage (JBC, in press). We also propose a model for control of SgrAI filamentation and DNA sequence specificity involving a disorder-to-order transition in SgrAI. Finally, new kinetic modeling also show how the secondary recognition sequences alter the thermodynamic states of SgrAI to affect filamentation and DNA cleavage preferences.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS023\n\nBiochemical and Biophysical Characterization of Small Molecule Inhibition of Gankyrin as a Therapeutic Strategy for Cancers\n\nEmma Kane, Dipti Kanabar, Abbas Kabir, Taylor Laflamme, Aaron Muth, Donald Spratt\n\nClark University (United States)\n\nGankyrin is a seven-ankyrin repeat containing oncoprotein associated with the 26S proteasome assembly that regulates numerous oncogenic and inflammatory pathways through facilitating protein-protein interactions. As a chaperone protein, gankyrin binds to the S6 ATPase subunit of the 19S regulatory cap of the 26S proteasome that enhances both mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) mediated proteolysis of tumor suppressor proteins (TSP) p53 and retinoblastoma protein (Rb), respectively. Previous studies have shown that gankyrin overexpression increases the degradation of tumor suppressor proteins resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and the onset of various cancers. The first small molecule identified for gankyrin inhibition, cjoc42, has been rudimentarily characterized to disrupt the interaction with S6 ATPase as a therapeutic approach for both liver and breast cancer. Here we show using a structure-based drug design approach that novel small molecule cjoc42 derivatives show marked improvement in inhibition of tumorigenesis with concurrent increases in TSP expression levels. Further biophysical evaluation revealed that these cjoc42 derivations mode of action induce global gankyrin unfolding. These findings also provide insight into clarifying essential residues within gankyrin that are required for small molecule interaction. Taken together, this work aims to establish optimal targeting of tandem repeat proteins to increase selectivity, mitigate off-target activity, and conceptualize a biochemical approach coupled with drug discovery.\n\nTrack: Protein Science Addressing Health Disparities\n\nABS024\n\nMass spectrometry based protein assays for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection\n\nSanjeeva Srivastava\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Bombay (India)\n\nDuring the past year, the understanding of COVID-19 severity has strengthened substantially. Using mass-spectrometry based proteomics, metabolomics & ML approaches, we discovered classifiers of COVID-19 severity such as AGT, FGG, APOB and SERPINA3 and also developed targeted protein assays based on Selected Reaction Monitoring for clinical translation. The altered plasma proteome of COVID-19 severe patients revealed dysregulation of peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis and myeloid leukocyte activation pathways. This study revealed that mass spectrometry-based peptide tests can be used by the clinicians for diagnosis as well as identified pathways/ markers as the predictors of the disease progression. Further, we also investigated the potential of attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy as a rapid blood test for classification of COVID-19 disease severity using a cohort of 160 COVID-19 patients. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy as a rapid, low-cost COVID-19 severity triage tool to facilitate COVID-19 patient management during an outbreak.\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS025\n\nProteomic investigation of COVID-19 severity during the tsunamic second wave in India\n\nSanjeeva Srivastava\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Bombay (India)\n\nA mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis has been done on severe and non-severe group of COVID 19 patients using nasopharyngeal swab samples. We have concluded from our study that antimicrobial peptide pathway might have a key role in the severity of the disease during the second wave of COVID-19. Further exploration of this pathway can shed light to improve our understanding for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and severity during the second wave. We have also identified severity markers and did their validation using MRM, but further validation is required before taking them forward for clinical translation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proteomic study depicting the role of antimicrobial peptide pathway in the severity of second wave of COVID-19.\n\nTrack: Synthetic Biology & Biosensing: Engineering Protein Components\n\nABS026\n\nExpressed Protein Ligation without Intein\n\nWenshe Liu, Yuchen Qiao\n\nTexas A&M University (United States)\n\nProteins with a functionalized C-terminus such as a C-terminal thioester are key to the synthesis of larger proteins via expressed protein ligation. They are usually made by recombinant fusion to intein. Although powerful, the intein fusion approach suffers from premature hydrolysis and low compatibility with denatured conditions. To totally bypass the involvement of an enzyme for expressed protein ligation, here we showed that a cysteine in a recombinant protein was chemically activated by a small molecule cyanylating reagent at its N-side amide for undergoing nucleophilic acyl substitution with amines including a number of L- and D-amino acids and hydrazine. The afforded protein hydrazides could be used further for expressed protein ligation. We demonstrated the versatility of this activated cysteine-directed protein ligation (ACPL) approach with the successful synthesis of ubiquitin conjugates, ubiquitin-like protein conjugates, histone H2A with a C-terminal posttranslational modification, RNAse H that actively hydrolyzed RNA, and exenatide that is a commercial therapeutic peptide. The technique, which is exceedingly simple but highly useful, expands to a great extent the synthetic capacity of protein chemistry and will therefore make a large avenue of new research possible.1-2\n\n1.

In order to make crystallography more accessible, NE-CAT offers a course in the practical aspects of crystallography, guiding users at all levels: undergraduate student, graduate student, postdoc or new investigator. The course covers the programs needed to take a crystal from an initial dataset to a final publication-ready structure.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS029\n\nAllosteric network analysis in galectin-7 uncovers key residues controlling positive cooperativity between two opposite glycan binding sites\n\nNgoc Thu Hang Pham, Alex Paré, Myriam Létourneau, Marlène Fortier, Gabriel Bégin, David Chatenet, Yves St-Pierre, Patrick Lagüe, Charles Calmettes, Nicolas Doucet\n\nCentre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Université du Québec, Laval, QC, Canada. (Canada)\n\nHuman galectin-7 (GAL-7) plays dual roles as a pro- and anti-tumorigenic protein. It is a prototypical galectin characterized by a beta-galactoside binding site (GBS) and a homodimeric molecular architecture. Due to high GBS similarity among several galectin homologs in the cell, the development of GAL-7 glycan-based inhibitors aimed at perturbing glycoreceptor interactions remains a high-risk strategy plagued by unwanted off-target effects. Functional allosteric modulation thus represents an alternative strategy to improve GAL-7 selectivity. In the present work, we used network analysis to predict residue positions that allosterically modulate the pro-apoptotic activity mediated by GAL-7. We uncovered how crucial residue contacts at the dimer interface can be altered to control its biological function by allosterically modulating communication between protomers. We show that introducing a covalent disulfide bridge at position G16 strengthens protomer interactions to improve positive cooperativity by favoring interprotomer communication between residue pair Arg20-Asp103 at the dimer interface. Accordingly, we describe a new approach to investigate the global communication flow between the two GBSs, revealing that altered electrostatic interactions between residue pairs Arg20-Asp103 and Arg22-Asp103 reduces interprotomer communication. This is consistent with decreased pro-apoptotic activity in GAL-7 variants R20A, R22A, and D103A, further suggesting that Arg20, Arg22, and Asp103 are potentially controlling positive cooperativity in GAL-7. Our study illustrates how the shortest pathway analysis can illuminate global flow communication to reveal key residues controlling allosteric communication between long-range functional sites within a protein.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS030\n\nZinc as a modulator of PSD-95 palmitoyl modification\n\nYonghong Zhang\n\nThe University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (United States)\n\nPSD-95 is an important postsynaptic membrane-associated protein. It is a central component of postsynaptic densities and plays a primary role in synaptic development and maturation. PSD-95 mediates postsynaptic location of AMPA receptors through its N-terminal C3/C5 palmitoylation/depalmitoylation switch. The palmitoylation-site N-terminus contains a zinc finger motif with unknown function. In this study, the interaction between Zn2+ and PSD-95NT was investigated for the first time. The NMR titration of 15N-labeled PSD-95NT by ZnCl2 was performed and demonstrated Zn2+ binds to PSD-95NT with a binding affinity (Kd) in the micromolar range. The zinc binding was confirmed by fluorescence and mutagenesis assays, indicating two cysteines and two histidines (H24, H28) are critical residues for the binding. These results suggested the concentration-dependent zinc binding is likely to influence PSD-95 palmitoylation since the binding site overlaps the palmitoylation sites, which was verified by the mimic PSD-95 palmitoyl modification and intact cell palmitoylation assays. This study reveals zinc as a novel modulator for PSD-95 postsynaptic membrane association by chelating its N-terminal region, indicative of its importance in postsynaptic signaling.\n\nTrack: Synthetic Biology & Biosensing: Engineering Protein Components\n\nABS031\n\nInvestigating the structure of TolA and its relationship with the proton motive force\n\nCara Press, Melissa Webby, Christina Redfield, Simon Newstead, Colin Kleanthous\n\nUniversity of Oxford (United Kingdom)\n\nIn Gram-negative bacteria the outer membrane (OM) provides a barrier to the outside world and confers intrinsic antibiotic resistance. It is a non-energised membrane, so energy requiring processes such as nutrient import must use energy sources across the inner membrane (IM) or in the cytoplasm. The Tol-Pal system utilises the proton motive force (PMF) across the IM for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the OM.\n\nOne of the five core components of the Tol-Pal system, Pal, is a lipoprotein anchored into the OM that binds to peptidoglycan (PG) forming a tether between the two layers (Parsons, Lin and Orban, 2006). The other four components TolA, TolB, TolQ and TolR, work to modulate the binding state of Pal. When bound to TolB, Pal can diffuse freely, allowing it to be recruited to the septum during cell division (Petiti et al., 2019; Szczepaniak et al., 2020). The inner membrane complex of TolQ-TolR transduces the PMF through the effector protein TolA and pulls TolB from Pal, thereby allowing Pal to bind to PG. The periplasmic second domain of TolA is essential for the function of the system and has been shown to undergo a PMF dependent conformational change (Germon et al., 2001). In this study we characterise the nature of TolA domain II using a range of biophysical techniques and examine the structure of the domain using both NMR and X-ray crystallography. It is hoped that elucidating the structure of TolA domain II will shed some light on the mechanism of action of the Tol-Pal system and how PMF-driven conformational changes in TolA translate to force transduction.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS032\n\nA multipronged footprinting map for interaction sites of stress biomarker Neurotransmitter Y (NPY) and novel peptide biorecognition elements\n\nRohit Jain, Erik Farquhar, Janna Kiselar, David Lodowski, Mark Chance\n\nCase Western Reserve University (United States)\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) signals important stress and mood phenotypes in the brain. Novel peptide biological recognition elements (BREs) have been developed as a first step towards developing hormone biosensors for stress and weight management. We employed protein footprinting mass spectrometry (PF-MS) to provide readout of NPY residues responsive to BRE binding. Three complimentary PF-MS approaches – Hydroxyl radical footprinting, Trifluoromethyl radical footprinting and Carboxyl group footprinting were applied independently.\n\nThis multipronged approach mapped changes in NPY solvent accessibility with 42% labeling coverage. The location and mechanism of binding of two BREs (N2, N3) with NPY was evaluated, revealing changes in NPY structure. PF-MS derived solvent accessibility for the NPY-N2 and NPY-N3 complexes shows distinct structural conformations. Deprotection of residues in NPY due to N2 binding suggest an extended NPY conformation, whereas the absence of deprotection in the NPY-N3 complex points to a hairpin conformation. Protection of sites in the NPY-N3 complex agree with reported MD results, confirming a C-terminal binding site.\n\nNMR structures of NPY shows multiple distinct conformations, including an extended structure with unfolded N-terminus and a poly-proline α-helix that is back folded on the C-terminus of NPY. Knowing the correct NPY conformation is essential to better design sensors based upon the NPY-N2 and NPY-N3 complexes. To do so, we reversed the order of PF-MS experiments via a “digest and label” strategy. We found the baseline structure of NPY has a higher order structure and by comparison to intact NPY BRE complexes FP, structural determinants impacting NPY solvent accessibility are being elucidated.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS033\n\nInDel Mix & Match. Reshaping coenzyme binding pockets through insertions and deletions\n\nSaacnicteh Toledo Patino\n\nOkinawa Institute of Science and Technology (Japan)\n\nEnzymes that employ cofactors to perform catalysis are ubiquitous across the tree of life and are necessary to assist half of the enzymatic reactions in nature. Among cofactors, nucleotide derivatives are believed to be the catalytic fossils of a hypothetical RNA-based world. They may have become associated with early peptides, which evolved towards the enormous catalysis we observe today. Given their importance, it is fundamental to understand how their binding modes emerged within protein scaffolds. This understanding will allow us to switch cofactor specificities and therefore functions across protein families and superfamilies. To date is widely accepted that protein scaffolds may have evolved through amplification and combination of ancient peptides. It has been shown that these ancestral units usually bind to nucleotide-moieties and how their combination in the laboratory leads to solubly expressed chimeras. Similarly, random mutagenesis has proven to alter protein functions. However, the role of insertions and deletions (InDels) in the emergence of protein functions remains underexplored. Not only are InDels highly deleterious, but also difficult to implement in randomized libraries, compared to amino acid substitutions.\n\nWe systematically searched for InDels within coenzyme binding pockets to study the hypothesis that insertions and deletions were involved in the divergence of coenzyme-binding in early evolution, and as a proof of principle, we engineered InDels to remodel the nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) binding pocket of oxidoreductases into the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding pocket of Rossmann methyltransferases. The elucidation of the mutants' crystal structures and binding studies corroborated the orthogonal binding switch from NAD to SAM, providing the first example where the implementation of InDels in rational design leads to a coenzyme-specificity switch that links two distinct enzymatic chemistries (redox and methylation) in Rossmann proteins. We believe this strategy can be generalized and will constitute a handy asset to the current protein engineering methods.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS034\n\nRCSB PROTEIN DATA BANK: Enabling Next Generation Exploration of PDB Data\n\nConnor Parker, Zukang Feng, Dennis Piehl, Stephen Burley\n\nRutgers (United States)\n\nThe Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established in 1971 as the first open-access digital data resource in biology. Beginning with seven protein structures, the PDB archive now hosts >185,000 structures of proteins, DNA, and RNA (totaling >1 billion atoms). Today, PDB is universally regarded as a core data science resource of fundamental importance to the life-science community and long-term preservation of biological data. PDB data impacts basic and applied research in fundamental biology, biomedicine, biotechnology, and energy.\n\nThe archive is managed by partners in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB): RCSB PDB, PDBe, and PDBj. This collaboration requires regular coordination and management of data across wwPDB data centers. The public data archive is 923 GB, with internal holdings significantly larger. A recently-developed application (File Access Application Programming Interface) will provide an updated means of synchronization between members. Using this new application, the process of sending and receiving data internally across wwPDB data centers will become less time consuming and more efficient.\n\nEach wwPDB partner maintains a public website for data access and exploration. The RCSB PDB website (RCSB.org) is visited by millions of users annually. Features include a structural motif search that finds residue patterns that recur throughout the PDB; a 3D Protein Feature View that maps 1D sequence features and annotations onto 3D structures, and new annotations for membrane proteins, antibodies, and domain classifications.\n\nThese new tools are intended to enable the next generation of PDB data exploration.\n\nRCSB PDB is a member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwpdb.org). RCSB PDB is funded by the National Science Foundation (DBI-1832184), the US Department of Energy (DE-SC0019749), and the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under grant R01GM133198.\n\nTrack: Synthetic Biology & Biosensing: Engineering Protein Components\n\nABS035\n\nDose-dependent nuclear delivery and transcriptional repression with a cell-penetrant MeCP2\n\nXizi Zhang, Alanna Schepartz\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley (United States)\n\nMethyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MeCP2) is a nuclear protein abundantly expressed in neurons and is essential for postnatal brain development. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe and incurable neurological disorder that disproportionately affects young girls. Despite the recent development in drugs capable of treating RTT-related symptoms, no disease modifying treatments exist for patients with RTT. Here we seek to develop a cell-penetrant MeCP2 that restores functional protein levels in cells as a potential therapy for RTT. We utilized the mini-protein known as ZF5.3 that is shown to be capable of efficiently delivering multiple proteins and enzymes to the cytosol and nuclei of multiple cells lines. Using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we find that the fusion protein ZF5.3-MeCP2 reaches the nucleus 2-fold higher than unconjugated MeCP2 protein, achieving nuclear concentrations greater than 600 nM. Moreover, western blot analysis of isolated nuclear fractions shows ZF5.3-MeCP2 remains intact and retains the ability to associate with known MeCP2-interacting protein partners once delivered to the nucleus. Finally, using an in cellulo transcriptional repression assay, we determine that nuclear-delivered ZF5.3-MeCP2 selectively binds and represses methylated gene expression.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS036\n\nRole of cystathionine--lyase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cysteine biosynthesis and H2S generation\n\nMarco Pedretti, Carolina Conter, Luis Alfonso Martínez-Cruz, Paola Dominici, Alessandra Astegno\n\nUniversity of Verona (Italy)\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is one of the most life-threatening multidrug-resistant (MDR) “superbug”, declared a priority 1 pathogen by WHO. Due to its emerging nonsusceptibility to conventional antibiotics, the identification of new pharmacological interventions is urgently needed. In this scenario, a novel approach to tackle antibiotic resistance relies on targeting the primary enzymatic sources of the bacterial hydrogen sulfide (H2S)–mediated defense system. H2S has been shown to promote resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics in Pa and other bacterial pathogens [1], and an effective antimicrobial strategy targeting the cystathionine-γ-lyase (CGL) enzyme as the primary generator of H2S in two major human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pa, has been recently purposed [2]. To extend the knowledge about this targetable system, herein, we report a comprehensive kinetic and structural characterization of recombinant CGL from Pa (PaCGL). We established that native PaCGL is a homotetramer in solution, in which the PLP cofactor is covalently bound to each monomer through Lys208 via a Schiff base linkage. The kinetic analysis, in combination with the identification of reaction products by RP-HPLC, revealed that PaCGL specifically catalyzes the canonical α, γ-hydrolysis of L-cystathionine to form L-cysteine. Importantly, PaCGL can also efficiently produce H2S using L-cysteine or L-homocysteine as substrates. This study, together with the obtainment of the crystal structure of the enzyme (PDB: 7BA4), demonstrates a crucial role of PaGCL not only in cysteine biosynthesis but also in H2S generation and opens the avenue to innovative anti-Pa interventions based on pharmacological targeting of the CGL enzyme.\n\n[1] Shatalin, Konstantin, et al. \"H2S: a universal defense against antibiotics in bacteria.\" Science 334.6058 (2011): 986-990\n\n[2] Shatalin, Konstantin, et al. \"Inhibitors of bacterial H2S biogenesis targeting antibiotic resistance and tolerance.\" Science 372.6547 (2021): 1169-1175\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS038\n\nNot refoldable, aggregation-prone, and toxic: A story about production of a high-value drug target\n\nAnais Naretto, Walter Chazin\n\nVanderbilt University (United States)\n\nThe majority of targets pursued by the pharmaceutical industry are membrane proteins.1 However, designing a drug effective against such targets are highly challenging. High Throughput Screening (HTS) is a common but often inefficient approach. Our goal is to use structure-based and fragment-based discovery approaches, which can provide a more directed and efficient path to lead inhibitors. However, production of recombinant target protein in high quantity, high purity, and soluble represents a major barrier to pursuing structure-based drug discovery for membrane proteins. The goal of our team is to develop inhibitors of a human type II transmembrane protein (T), targeting the extracellular domain. However, several intrinsic characteristics pose major obstacles to production in E.coli as T: (i) contains four disulfide bonds, (ii) has two free cysteines are involved in the receptor oligomerization, (iii) has an extensive hydrophobic core as well as a significant surface hydrophobic cleft, and (iv) is toxic, functioning in a cell death pathway in mammalian cells and to a lesser extent in E.coli. In addition, T forms homo- and hetro-oligomers and binds carbohydrates. This presentation focuses on our efforts to produce T for our drug discovery campaign. We have expressed T in E.coli, which uniformly produced protein in inclusion bodies. Attempts to obtain soluble in bacteria included changing expression conditions and testing different adjuvants. In parallel, an extensive array of refolding approaches were assayed, along with screening for additives, detergent, and reducing agents. In-silico modeling was also used to predict less aggregation-prone mutants that might facilitate refolding and these are being produced and tested. We are also expressing T in genetically modified yeast that produce glycosylated protein closely mimicking those found in humans.\n\nTrack: Miniproteins: Are There Really That Many Additional Genes That We Have Been Missing?\n\nABS039\n\nEmergence of a catalytic activity in a SH3-like fold provides a powerful resistance mechanism\n\nClaudèle Lemay-St-Denis, Lorea Alejaldre, Zakaria Jemouai, Kiana Lafontaine, Maxime St-Aubin, Katia Hitache, Donya Valhikani, Myriam Létourneau, Nicolas Doucet, Christian Baron, Janine N Copp, Joelle N Pelletier\n\nUniversité de Montréal (Canada)\n\nType B dihydrofolate reductases (DfrB), first identified in the 1970s, procure strong resistance to the synthetic antimicrobial trimethoprim. DfrB enzymes are constituted of a single SH3-like fold of 78 residues that assembles as an obligate homotetramer to form a central, highly symmetrical active site. Intriguingly, DfrB enzymes have no evolutionary homology to any characterized protein, such that their evolutionary origin is unknown. Here, I present our investigation of distant DfrB homologues that begins to fill gaps in our knowledge of the evolution of this SH3-like fold into a powerful antimicrobial resistance mechanism. Through metagenomics database searches of uncharacterized and putative proteins, we identified distant homologues to the DfrB, which we characterized for their capacity to provide trimethoprim resistance when expressed in E. coli. By means of kinetic characterization, circular dichroism, negative-stain electron microscopy and more, we demonstrate that a 365-residue distant homologue, having similarity with DfrB only in its small SH3-like fold, recreates the DfrB active site environment through multimerization, yielding undistinguishable dihydrofolate reductase activity and trimethoprim resistance. These results contribute to our goal of establishing the evolutionary path that has led the SH3-like fold of the DfrB enzymes to the modern resistome. This research will deepen our knowledge of evolution of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, a major issue in modern medicine.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS040\n\nMultiscale modeling approaches for the protein-solid interface\n\nSophie Sacquin-Mora\n\nLaboratoire de Biochimie Théorique, CNRS UPR9080 (France)\n\nThe adsorption of proteins on solid surfaces remains a complex but central issue in the biomaterials field, which requires us to understand this process at the atomic level. In particular, designing efficient devices using immobilized proteins requires us to grasp details of the protein-solid interface, such as the adsorbed enzyme orientation, the stability of the adsorption and its consequences on the protein function [1]. Such information can be obtained using molecular modeling approaches on different scales, either with classical all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations, or with coarse-grain calculations based on Elastic Network Models [2]. Applications on [NiFe]-hydrogenases (which catalyze hydrogen oxidation) [3-4] and copper-billirubin oxidase (which catalyzes oxygen reduction) [5] show how simulations give us insight on factors determining enzymes orientation on the electrode surfaces, and how the adsorption on a solid surface can impact proteins structure, dynamics and mechanical properties, and therefore their\n\ncatalytic activity. Furthermore, simulations on cellulose degradation) adsorbed on bare and SAM-functionalized gold surfaces highlight how one must find an acceptable stability-activity trade-off when working with immobilized enzymes [6].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Hitaishi et al., Catalysts., 8, 192 (2018).\n\n[2] Sacquin-Mora Methods Enzymol. 578, 227 (2016)\n\n[3] Oteri et al., PCCP, 16, 11318 (2014).\n\n[4] Oteri et al., J.

These PES are formed by the multitude of different accessible molecular conformations. Various methods exist to analyze this chemical space. Among these methods is Molecular Dynamics (MD). MD simulations are commonly used to calculate the time evolution of various chemical systems, ranging in size from dimers in vacuo to solvated enzymes.\n\nA common problem when applying MD simulations on large biochemical systems is a lack of sampling, caused by, e.g. large barrier heights separating stable basins or a rough surface with many local minima. This lack of sampling traps the dynamic system, preventing an efficient exploration of the PES.\n\nReplica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) allows for an extensive exploration of these less accessible PES, by performing simulations at differing conditions and exchanging these conditions at predefined intervals.\n\nThe Q software package, which was developed to perform empirical valence bond (EVB) and free energy calculations, is frequently used for the study of reaction mechanisms in biomolecules using reactive MD. The tool presented here, Q-Repex, increases the sampling efficiency of the robust EVB-FEP/US approach by means of REMD. Tests were performed on various, prior studied, biochemical reactions, including the TIM catalyzed isomerisation reaction of GAP. Q-Repex decreases the computational costs, and opens the possibility of new in depth studies of biochemical reactions.\n\nTrack: Protein Science Addressing Health Disparities\n\nABS042\n\nMechanism of protein protection by desiccation-tolerance molecules\n\nJulia Brom, Sasiprapa Samsri, Ruta Petrikis, Gary Pielak\n\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) (United States)\n\nProtein-based drugs are amazingly effective, but solution instability of proteins means these therapeutics require costly refrigeration, impeding their accessibility [1,2]. Drying can increase stability, but most proteins do not withstand dehydration [3]. Protective molecules, excipients, are often added to safeguard proteins during drying [4,5]. Formulation, however, is empirical and of varying efficacy due to a paucity of high-resolution information about dry proteins; we do not fully understand the mechanism(s) of protection [4,6].\n\nTo solve this problem, we developed Liquid-Observed Vapor Exchange (LOVE) NMR, a technique that reports on dry protein structure at the residue level [7]. Using LOVE NMR, we showed that dry proteins comprise an immobile but diverse conformational ensemble [7]. We also showed that electrostatic interactions and disorder are important for protection by desiccation-tolerance proteins from a tardigrade and a midge [8].\n\nWe will describe our recent efforts on protection by sugars, including trehalose, a well-known excipient [9,10]. We will also present data on new client proteins that allow us to apply both LOVE NMR and activity assays, enabling investigation of both structure and function. Such efforts elucidate mechanisms of dehydration protection, allowing rational design of excipient formulations and making protein products more affordable and accessible [11].\n\nSupported by NIH grant R01GM127291.\n\n1.

Bile acids are the endogenous FXR ligands. Bile acid binding to FXR induces association with FXR response element sequences (FXREs), and promotes selective recruitment of coregulator proteins via induced structural changes in the activation function AF-2 surface, i.e. the site of coregulator binding. However, there is a poor understanding of how FXR is allosterically regulated by bile acid, which acts as a molecular switch to initiate critical long-range of transcriptional events.\n\nThe goal of this work is to understand how minor structural modifications in bile acids give rise to differential FXR transcriptional activity. We used dual luciferase assays to determine how bile acids modulate FXR DNA binding preferences for a wide range of FXREs. We also used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the effect of the bile acids on AF-2 signaling. We have identified key residues that mediate specific allosteric communication pathways in FXR, and the mutations of the key residues in FXR-LBD affect bile acid-specific FXR transcriptional activities, confirming their roles in ligand-AF-2 allostery. These findings can further our understanding of how bile acids impact FXR promoter selectivity and coregulator recruitment.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS044\n\nA CRYPTIC POCKET IN EBOLA VP35 ALLOSTERICALLY CONTROLS RNA BINDING\n\nMatthew Cruz, Thomas Frederick, Upasana Mallimadugula, Rishi Samarth, Gaya Amarasinghe, Gregory Bowman\n\nWashington University in St. Louis (United States)\n\nMany proteins are difficult to target with drugs because their primary function is to participate in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-nucleic acid interactions (PNIs) through flat interfaces that are less conducive to small molecule binding. These interactions are found in many viral proteins that interact with host factors and viral nucleic acids in order to evade the host immune system. We focused our study on viral protein 35 (VP35), from the highly lethal Ebola virus. VP35 plays essential roles in Ebola's replication cycle, including binding the viral RNA genome to block a host's innate immunity. However, there are no FDA approved drugs targeting VP35. One promising opportunity for discovering and designing new drugs is cryptic pockets, or pockets that are absent in available protein structures but form due to protein dynamics. Identifying and exploiting cryptic pockets remains challenging as most known pockets were discovered alongside the identification of a small molecule effector. Here, we applied adaptive sampling simulations to sample states in VP35's conformational landscape with large pocket volumes which revealed a potentially druggable cryptic pocket. Then, using allosteric network detection algorithms, we predicted that VP35 harbors a cryptic pocket that is allosterically coupled to its RNA-binding interface. Thiol labeling experiments along with dsRNA binding experiments suggest the VP35 cryptic pocket is present and that stabilizing this pocket in its open form allosterically disrupts RNA binding. We then conducted an experimental high throughput screen for dsRNA binding inhibitors targeting VP35 that yielded a number of hits. These results demonstrate the potential of cryptic pockets to allosterically affect PPI and PNIs presenting new therapeutic opportunities for targeting these prevalent interactions.\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS045\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network profoundly shapes the protein sequence space accessible to HIV envelope\n\nJimin Yoon, Emmanuel Nekongo, Jessica Patrick, Taffani Hui, Angela Phillips, Anna Ponomarenko, Rebecca Sebastian, Yu Meng Zhang, Vincent Butty, C. Ogbunugafor, Yu-Shan Lin, Matthew Shoulders\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (United States)\n\nThe sequence space accessible to evolving proteins can be enhanced by cellular chaperones that assist biophysically defective clients in navigating complex folding landscapes. It is also possible for proteostasis mechanisms that promote strict quality control to greatly constrain accessible protein sequence space. Unfortunately, most efforts to understand how proteostasis mechanisms influence evolution rely on artificial inhibition or altered expression of specific chaperones or quality control factors. Here, we use chemical genetic strategies to tune proteostasis networks via natural stress response pathways that regulate the levels of entire suites of proteostasis factors. Specifically, we upregulate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to test the hypothesis that the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network shapes the sequence space accessible to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) protein. Elucidating factors that enhance or constrain Env sequence space is critical because Env evolves extremely rapidly, yielding HIV strains with antibody- and drug-escape mutations. We find that UPR-mediated upregulation of ER proteostasis factors, particularly those controlled by the IRE1-XBP1s UPR arm, globally reduces Env mutational tolerance. Conserved, functionally important Env regions exhibit the largest decreases in mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction. Our data indicate that this phenomenon likely reflects strict quality control endowed by XBP1s-mediated remodeling of the ER proteostasis environment. Intriguingly, and in contrast, specific regions of Env, including regions targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies, display enhanced mutational tolerance when XBP1s is induced, hinting at a role for host proteostasis network hijacking in potentiating antibody escape. These observations reveal a key function for proteostasis networks in decreasing instead of expanding the sequence space accessible to client proteins, while also demonstrating that the host ER proteostasis network profoundly shapes the mutational tolerance of Env in ways that could have important consequences for HIV adaptation.\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS046\n\nDeep mutational scanning of a predicted Syk-family kinase ancestor using a bacterial assay\n\nHelen Hobbs, Neel Shah, Sophie Shoemaker, Jeanine Amacher, Susan Marqusee, John Kuriyan\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine (United States)\n\nMany tyrosine kinases cannot be expressed readily in E. coli, limiting facile access to these proteins for biochemical experiments. We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to generate a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) variant that, unlike the present-day members of this family (Syk and ZAP-70), can be expressed in bacteria. This bacterially-expressed protein has catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and allosteric regulation by phosphorylation that reflect those of human Syk and ZAP-70. Taking advantage of the ability to express this novel Syk-family kinase in bacteria, we developed a two-hybrid assay that couples the growth of E.coli in the presence of an antibiotic to successful phosphorylation of a bait peptide by the kinase. Using this assay, we screened a saturation mutagenesis library of the reconstructed Syk-family kinase. Loss-of-function mutations identified in the screen correlate well with residues established as critical to function and/or structure in protein kinases. We also identify activating mutations in the regulatory hydrophobic spine, catalytic hydrophobic spine, and activation loop, all of which are within key motifs involved in kinase regulation. Strikingly, one of the mutations to the bacterially-expressed Syk-family kinase identified in our screen resulted in a dramatic increase in expression. Thus, through ancestral sequence reconstruction followed by deep mutational scanning we have generated a high yield Syk-family kinase that can be expressed in bacteria.\n\nTrack: Machine Learning in Protein Science\n\nABS047\n\nComputational Development for Automatic Enzyme Design\n\nQianzhen Shao\n\nVanderbilt University (United States)\n\nThe a priori computational design of function-enhancing enzyme mutants is significant for expanding the biocatalytic toolbox for late-stage functionalization of drug-like molecules, environmental degradation of plastics and other pollutants, and medical treatment of food allergies. In this talk, I will introduce our ongoing efforts to develop computational database, software, and workflows that facilitate the discovery of beneficial enzyme mutants for catalyzing new-to-nature reactions. This includes an integrated enzyme structure-function database, IntEnzyDB; a high-throughput enzyme modeling software, EnzyHTP; a deep learning framework for predicting the outcome of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolytic kinetic resolution, EnzyKR. We will also talk about the use of these tools to advance the understanding of fundamental enzyme catalysis processes.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS048\n\nInsights into the function of an essential membrane protease Rv2903c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nIndu Bhatia\n\nNational Institute of Immunology (India)\n\nCell envelope of pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is intriguingly a complex structure representing a significant barrier to drug delivery and provides substantial survival advantages to the pathogen within the granulomas. Furthermore, the functional knowledge on proteins harboured within the cell membrane is scarce owing to the substantial experimental challenges of working with the membrane proteins. The extracytosolic secretion of proteins is a key cellular process for cell survival and inarguably play a vital role in virulence of Mtb; promoting host cell invasion because of their direct involvement in the molecular interactions made between the pathogen and their target cells, therefore representing important molecules to study the host-pathogen study of Mtb. In the present study, we report the in vitro functional characterization of an essential full length membrane protein LepB (Rv2903c) which encodes the sole homolog of the type I signal peptidase in Mtb. LepB full length membrane protein was purified to homogeneity using various chromatographic techniques and its native folded state was studied using circular dichroism (CD) and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectrometry. Its sub-cellular localization studies infer that LepB proteins localizes to the cell membrane. Since, lepB is a type I signal peptidase which are critical for the release of translocated preproteins from the cell membrane. In light of its function, an essential mycP3 protein (Rv0291) and immunogenic implicated protein fbpA (Rv3804) has been studied as lepB substrates via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and in vitro activity assays. Thus, this study on in vitro functional characterization of LepB which will aid in better understanding of enigmatic area of protein export of Mtb proteins.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS049\n\nSmall Molecules Targeting the Disordered Transactivation Domain of the Androgen Receptor Induce the Formation of Collapsed Helical States\n\nJiaqi Zhu, Paul Robustelli\n\nDartmouth College (United States)\n\nCastration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal condition suffered by ∼35% of prostate cancer patients who become resistant to existing FDA-approved drugs. Small molecules that target the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor (AR-NTD) have shown promise in circumventing CPRC drug-resistance. A prodrug of one such compound, EPI-002, entered human trials in 2015 but was discontinued after phase I due to poor potency. The compound EPI-7170 was subsequently found to have improved potency, and a related compound entered human trials in 2020. NMR measurements have localized the strongest effects of these compounds to a transiently helical region of the disordered AR-NTD but no detailed structural or mechanistic rationale exists to explain their affinity to this region or the comparative potency of EPI-7170. Here, we utilize all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the binding mechanisms of the small molecules EPI-002 and EPI-7170 to the disordered AR-NTD. We observe that both compounds induce the formation of collapsed helical states in the Tau-5 transactivation domain and that these bound states consist of heterogenous ensembles of interconverting binding modes. We find that EPI-7170 has a higher affinity to Tau-5 than EPI-002 and that the EPI-7170 bound ensemble contains a substantially higher population of collapsed helical states than the bound ensemble of EPI-002. We identify a network of interactions in the EPI-7170 bound ensemble that stabilize collapsed helical conformations. Our results provide atomically detailed binding mechanisms for EPI compounds consistent with NMR experiments that will prove useful for drug discovery for CRPC.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS050\n\nThioesterase enzymes in the updated ThYme database\n\nCaio Carvalho, Benjamim Caswell, Hung Nguyen, Monikrishna Roy, Tin Nguyen, David Cantu\n\nUniversity of Nevada – Reno (United States)\n\nThioesterases (TEs) hydrolyze thioester bonds. They catalyze important reactions in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis, essential for the biological production of components in foods, cosmetics, detergents, insecticides, fungicides, antibiotics, and other medicinal compounds. Thioesterases are classified into thirty-five TE families,1 which appear in the publicly available thioester-active enzyme (ThYme) database.2 Enzymes in a family are classified according to sequence similarity, which allows inferring the tertiary structure and catalytic residues of all family members based on those that have been experimentally characterized. The TE families have been recently updated in a new version of the ThYme database, including the TE enzyme families, sequences, and structures. The new version of ThYme currently presents >100,000 sequences in a modern online interface that allows users to interactively search sequences, blast sequences in a short time, customize their preferences, and download content. The new ThYme also includes other enzyme groups that act on thioester bonds such as ketoacyl synthases. In this presentation, we will describe: i) the functions, structures, and mechanisms of the thirty-five TE families, ii) the catalytic residues in most TE families with known tertiary structures, iii) the phylogenetic analysis of experimentally-confirmed TEs that have a HotDog or an alpha-beta hydrolase fold, and iv) the new functionalities in the updated ThYme database. Convergent and divergent evolution is observed in TEs, which show that thioester hydrolysis can proceed in different structures and by other mechanisms, leading to multiple substrate specificities.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS051\n\nThermostability and DNA-Binding Function of Engineered, Chimeric Proteins\n\nJessica DeSanctis, Nicole Boardman, Amber Persson, Michelle McCully\n\nSanta Clara University (United States)\n\nFunctional thermostable proteins are beneficial for many industries including pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and transportation. Protein stability is imperative for safely handling and storing biopharmaceuticals as well as the efficiency of their transportation by eliminating the need for industrial freezers. Here, we attempt to rationally design a protein that is both thermostable and functional. The Engrailed homeodomain (EnHD), a protein isolated from Drosophila melanogaster, is a good target for assessing functionality and thermostability due to its moderate melting temperature (Tm = 52 °C) and its ability to bind to DNA. UVF, an engineered homologue of EnHD, is nonfunctional but very thermostable (Tm >99 °C). UVF shares a 22% sequence identity to EnHD. ​​ We created chimeras of EnHD and UVF by combining the functional components of EnHD and the thermostable elements of UVF using MODELLER. We conducted all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the proteins alone and with DNA at 25 and 100 °C. We compared their Cα RMSD between temperatures to assess thermostability and analyzed contact time with DNA to assess function. Proteins were expressed using recombinant protein methods in E. coli. After expression and purification, we used Circular Dichroism (CD) and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) in order to analyze the thermostability and functionality of the chimeric proteins.\n\nTrack: Synthetic Biology & Biosensing: Engineering Protein Components\n\nABS053\n\nMetabolic Engineering of Live Yeast for the Production of Novel Tetracyclines for In Situ Treatment of Antibiotic Resistance\n\nArden Lee, Ehud Herbst, Scott Snyder, Yi Tang, Virginia Cornish\n\nColumbia University (United States)\n\nDeveloping treatments for antibiotic resistant bacterial infections is among the highest priority public health challenges worldwide. Tetracyclines, one of the most important classes of antibiotics, have fallen prey to antibiotic resistance, necessitating the generation of new analogs. Many tetracycline analogs have been accessed through both total synthesis and semisynthesis, but key C-ring tetracycline analogs remain inaccessible. New methods are needed to unlock access to these analogs, and heterologous biosynthesis in a tractable host such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a candidate method. C-ring analog biosynthesis can mimic nature's biosynthesis of tetracyclines from anhydrotetracyclines, but challenges exist, including the absence of the unique cofactor F420 in common heterologous hosts. Here, we describe the biosynthesis of tetracycline from anhydrotetracycline in S. cerevisiae heterologously expressing three enzymes from three bacterial hosts. Additionally, our collaborators in the Tang laboratory reported the heterologous biosynthesis of a non-antibiotic anhydrotetracycline derivative, TAN-1612, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from Aspergillus niger; we propose to convert TAN-1612 into a high titer tetracycline- and analog-producer by modifying the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions, proven critical for antibiotic activity. By hijacking biosynthetic hydroxylating and reducing enzymes, we will modify the 6-alpha-position, dearomatizing the C-ring. By taking advantage of yeast's natural biosynthetic pathways, we will create inexpensive, single-dose antibiotics, setting the stage to pursue yeast as a novel therapeutic. These state-of-the-art synthetic biology technologies will create entirely new paradigms, leading the charge against infections and diseases.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS054\n\nDetergent Alternatives: Membrane Protein Purification Using Synthetic Nanodisc Polymers\n\nValentina Dimitrova, Saemee Song, Alexandra Karagiaridi, Anika Marand, Heather Pinkett\n\nDepartment of Molecular Biosciences, Northwestern University (United States)\n\nThe development of styrene maleic acid (SMA) and diisobutylene maleic acid (DIBMA) co-polymers provides an alternative to traditional detergent extraction of integral membrane proteins. By inserting into the lipid bilayer, these polymers can extract membrane proteins with lipids in the form of native nanodiscs. Unlike detergent solubilization, where membrane proteins may lose annular lipids necessary for proper folding and stability, native nanodiscs allow for the extracted targets to remain in the natural lipid environment. In addition, polymer-based nanodiscs can be purified using common chromatography methods, similar to protocols established for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins. Here we describe the solubilization screening and purification of an integral membrane protein using several commercial co-polymers. We focus our efforts on SapC, a transmembrane domain in the Type I ABC importer SapABCDF, and we demonstrate that SMA-bound SapC nanodiscs can assemble with the separately purified nucleotide binding domain SapF to build the SapCF complex. Our pursuits have since expanded to include the second nucleotide binding domain of the Sap transporter, SapD, as we seek to understand the mechanism of transporter regulation by the SapD/SapF domain pair.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS056\n\nDiscovery of a reversible covalent inhibitor against Papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS-CoV-2 virus\n\nTeena Bajaj, Eddie Wehri, Rahul Suryawanshi, Kundan Pardeshi, Elizabeth King, Kamyar Behrouzi, Zahra Khodabakshi, G Renuka Kumar, Mohammad R.K. Mofrad, Daniel K. Nomura, Melanie Ott, Julia Schaltesky, Niren Murthy\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley (United States)\n\nReversible covalent inhibitors have generated a tremendous interest because of their unique combination of high efficacy and low toxicity. However, developing reversible covalent inhibitors is a very challenging task because the only strategy available for generating reversible covalent inhibitors are based upon either boronic acids or a retro-michael addition reaction, which are effective on only a small set of proteins. In this report, we demonstrate that a thiouridine fragment can serve as a scaffold for developing thiol triggered reversible covalent inhibitors. The thiouridine fragment was identified from a 115,000 molecule screen performed against the papain-like protease (PLpro) from SARS CoV-2 virus. This fragment inhibited PLpro with a IC50 of 3.8 μM and also inhibited SARS CoV-2 replication in cells. In addition, the thiouridine fragment covalently reacted with cysteines in PLpro, and its inhibition of PLpro was reversed via the addition of thiols. The thiouridine fragment undergoes an additional-elimination reaction with the active site cysteine of PLpro, and thiols that can enter the active site are able to displace the thiouridine fragment. These experiments demonstrate that the addition elimination reaction has the potential to generate reversible covalent inhibitors and dramatically expands the classes of warheads that can generate reversible covalent inhibitors.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS057\n\nInsight Into the Structural Evolution of Polyamine Acetyltransferases Across Prokaryotes, Eukaryotes, and Archaea\n\nHuy Do, Nicola Bordin, Clemens Rauer, Christine Orengo, Misty Kuhn\n\nSan Francisco State University (United States)\n\nPolyamines are critical small molecules that are found in a variety of organisms and regulate numerous processes such as bacterial biofilm formation, siderophore production, and transcription. One way polyamine concentrations are regulated is through their acetylation via polyamine acetyltransferases. The most widely studied polyamine acetyltransferases are the spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferases (SSATs), which acetylate spermidine and spermine using the donor molecule acetyl-coenzyme A. These enzymes belong to the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, which is comprised of a variety of enzymes that adopt a characteristic GNAT structural fold. While SSATs all adopt this fold, their oligomeric states and presence and absence of domain swapping vary across organisms. The two most prominent and structurally characterized SSATs in bacteria and humans are SpeG and hSSAT, respectively. However, SpeG is a dodecamer without domain swapping and has allosteric sites, whereas hSSAT is a dimer with domain swapping and to our knowledge has no allosteric site. In this study, we sought to determine the evolutionary structural changes that potentially contributed to the two distinct structural forms of these proteins. Therefore, we grouped GNAT protein sequences into functional clusters and identified sub-clusters of proteins that were located between the SpeG and hSSAT clusters. Since none of the proteins within these sub-clusters had been structurally determined, we generated Alphafold models to perform structural comparisons. Our analysis of these data revealed distinct groups of proteins that likely share similar structural characteristics.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS058\n\nInvestigating the Importance of a Series of Active Site Residues on PA3945 Enzyme Activity\n\nCillian Variot, Misty Kuhn\n\nSan Francisco State University (United States)\n\nThe diverse and widespread superfamily of Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) are characterized by structural motifs and varying acceptor pockets that allow them to bind and acetylate a breadth of substrates. One example of a GNAT that exhibits substrate promiscuity is the PA3944 enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have previously shown this enzyme acetylates a variety of substrates, including the macrocyclic antibiotic polymyxin B, and examined the importance of numerous active site residues for substrate specificity. A homologous enzyme PA3945 shares a 71% sequence identity with PA3944, yet it is inactive toward polymyxin B. A comparison of a homology model of PA3945 and the 3D crystal structure of PA3944 indicates the proteins may adopt a similar overall structure but some active site residues do not appear to be conserved. To determine whether the lack of activity toward polymyxin B is due to the non-conserved proline residues or alteration of other active site residues, we generated point mutations of the PA3945 enzyme to mimic the active site residues in PA3944 and screened the mutants for activity. Our research details the importance of acceptor site residues on the activity of PA3945 and expands on our understanding of the evolution of these two enzymes.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS059\n\nAssessing the Importance of an Active Site Serine Residue on Binding and Enzymatic Activity of AAC(6)-Ig and -Ih Aminoglycoside Acetyltransferase Enzymes\n\nDaniel Capule, Xhulio Arolli, Daniel Becker, Misty Kuhn\n\nSan Francisco State University (United States)\n\nAminoglycosides are a potent class of antibiotics that can be used against a wide variety of microbes. These drugs typically work by binding to a ribosomal subunit and causing errors in translation, leading to bacterial death. However, these antibiotics can become inactivated via acetylation by aminoglycoside acetyltransferases. These enzymes belong to the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily, which utilize a variety of chemical mechanisms to acetylate an assortment of substrates. The most common general acid/base chemical mechanism for GNATs tends to use a catalytic tyrosine residue as a general acid involving a direct transfer kinetic mechanism. However, other chemical and kinetic mechanisms are possible. For example, we recently showed that some GNATs can use a catalytic serine residue, which is involved in a hybrid ping-pong kinetic mechanism. Our comparative examination of AAC(6′)-Ig and -Ih aminoglycoside acetyltransferases from Acinetobacter shows these two enzymes have a serine residue in a similar location in the active site. To determine whether this serine residue is indeed critical for activity, we generated point mutations of these serine residues and screened the enzymes for activity against a panel of aminoglycoside antibiotics. We also performed docking studies with this serine residue acetylated and non-acetylated to probe the binding modes of the aminoglycosides in these two conditions. These results provide an understanding of how these two enzyme acceptor site residues may bind diverse aminoglycosides and contribute to antibiotic resistance in these organisms.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS060\n\nExamination of the Structural Motifs that Underpin the GNAT Fold Across Diverse 3D Protein Structures\n\nK. Phelan Glenn, Huy Do, Nicola Bordin, Christine Orengo, Misty Kuhn\n\nSan Francisco State University (United States)\n\nGcn5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) are important enzymes that catalyze the acetylation of small and large biomolecules. The impact of acetylation ranges from enabling antibiotic resistance to post-translational modifications of proteins. While GNATs catalyze diverse reactions, they all tend to adopt a common structural fold that enables the acetyl donor and acetyl acceptor molecules to bind. This fold is defined by four motifs A-D, which were documented over twenty years ago when the number of GNAT 3D protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were more limited. Today, there are numerous GNAT protein structures that have been determined, which has expanded our understanding of how diverse proteins from this superfamily fold. To determine whether the boundaries of these motifs remain applicable across this larger structural dataset or should be refined, we examined their locations on 56 representative structures from the PDB. Based on these data, we found some secondary structure extensions or deviations from the core motifs on a subset of proteins. We then grouped these structures based on these deviations and examined whether there were patterns to their functional or liganded state. Our results provide new insight into whether the originally defined GNAT motifs are retained or deviate in an expanded GNAT structural dataset.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS061\n\nDecarboxylase Enzymes in the Polyamine Biosynthetic Pathway are Post-translationally Modified by Lysine Acetyltransferase Proteins\n\nPatricia Uychoco, Pamela Caro De Silva, Tiffany Chambers, Misty Kuhn\n\nSan Francisco State University (United States)\n\nPolyamines are small polycationic organic molecules that are biosynthesized from a variety of amino acids and are utilized by living organisms for many cellular processes. Polyamine biosynthesis and degradation are highly regulated processes, and in some bacteria polyamines act as regulatory molecules for biofilm formation and dispersion. Prior studies have shown that several lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) enzymes in E. coli acetylate a multitude of different proteins. While the corresponding substrate proteins and sites of acetylation have been identified, their locations on 3D protein structures have not been thoroughly investigated across all substrates. Moreover, not much is known about whether lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification for polyamine metabolic enzymes. Our analysis identified three regulatory polyamine biosynthetic decarboxylase enzymes that are enzymatically acetylated by KAT proteins. We performed a structural analysis to compare the location of these acetylation sites in 3D on the different enzymes. Our structural investigation revealed that while the enzymes catalyze similar reactions, they do not share the same structural folds and the sites of acetylation are scattered across protein domains. These results provide a framework for further elucidating the substrate specificity of KAT proteins and how polyamine metabolism may be further regulated by lysine acetylation.\n\nTrack: Cellular Tasks\n\nABS062\n\nExploring the Regulation of Polyamine Biosynthesis and Degradation via Lysine Acetylation in E. coli\n\nPamela Caro De Silva, Patricia Uychoco, Tiffany Chambers, Misty Kuhn\n\nSan Francisco State University (United States)\n\nPolyamines are aliphatic small molecules that are important for cellular homeostasis and bacterial survival under stressful conditions. High concentrations of polyamines in cells can be toxic and their acetylation by polyamine acetyltransferases neutralizes this toxicity. One way polyamine acetylation is regulated in E. coli is via the spermidine N-acetyltransferase SpeG enzyme. It also has an allosteric site that is thought to be important for regulating SpeG kinetic activity by binding polyamine at the allosteric site. Polyamine metabolism can also be regulated at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. At the post-translational level, many E. coli proteins involved in polyamine metabolism are modified via lysine acetyltransferases (KATs). To learn more about the potential effects of acetylation of these proteins on the regulation of polyamine metabolism in E. coli, we examined the location of acetylated and non-acetylated enzymes within polyamine biosynthetic and degradative pathways. We found the proteins that were acetylated are located at key regulatory points of these pathways or are global transcriptional regulator proteins that are important for transitioning between anerobic and aerobic metabolism. Our results highlight possible scenarios for the effects of acetylation on the flux of these pathways and uncover unexplored avenues for further studies on the regulation of polyamine metabolism in bacteria.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS065\n\nStructures of the Pro-Oncogenic Singly-Liganded HER2/HER3 Heterodimer Reveal Novel Asymmetry\n\nDevan Diwanji, Raphael Trenker, Tarjani Thakar, Feng Wang, David Agard, Kliment Verba, Natalia Jura\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (United States)\n\nThe Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3) form a potent pro-oncogenic signaling unit upon binding to the extracellular ligand neuregulin-1ß (NRG1ß). The mechanism of HER2 heteromeric association with HER3 remains unknown in the absence of any structure of the complex. Through novel ligand-based purification and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on graphene oxide supported grids, we solved three novel structures of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer in the context of near-full length receptors. These structures represent the first depictions of a singly-liganded HER receptor dimer, HER2 actively engaged with a co-receptor, and HER3 in a ligand-bound configuration. Our structure of the HER2/HER3/NRG1ß heterocomplex in which only HER3 is bound to a ligand reveals unexpected dynamics at the HER2/HER3 dimerization interface and supports a model in which ligand binding allosterically coordinates a receptive pocket for the dimerization arm of the co-receptor. This novel allosteric mechanism of ligand occupancy sensing also explains an intrinsic mode of HER2 autoinhibition in which the extracellular domains of HER2 do not homo-associate via the canonical active dimer interfaces despite adopting an active-like conformation without a ligand. In a second heterocomplex structure featuring the most prevalent oncogenic extracellular domain HER2 mutant, S310F, we observe a compensatory interaction with the HER3 dimerization arm that stabilizes the dimerization interface. We show that both HER2/HER3 and HER2-S310F/HER3 retain the capacity to bind to the HER2-targeting therapeutic antibody, trastuzumab, but the mutant complex does not bind to pertuzumab. Our third structure of the HER2-S310F/HER3/NRG1ß/trastuzumab Fragment antigen binding (Fab) complex, the first structure of this therapeutic in the context of a HER receptor dimer, demonstrates how the receptor dimer subtly rearranges to accommodate trastuzumab. These findings have broad implications for understanding HER receptor dimerization and unveil previously unknown structural details for rational bispecific drug design.\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS066\n\nProgress report on characterizing the stability of 500 repacked variants of a four-helix bundle protein\n\nTIANQI GUO, TIANQI GUO\n\nthe ohio state university (United States)\n\nAs a group of essential bio-macromolecules, most proteins become functional when folding into unique 3-dimensional structure. The limited understanding of the sequence basis of the protein folding and stability is a major obstacle for engineering therapeutic protein molecules. Many lines of evidence suggest that the residues packed in the hydrophobic core are important for a protein to maintain native-like properties. Here we analyze how the stability and other biophysical properties vary by repacking the hydrophobic core of the four-helix-bundle protein, Rop. We used combinatorial mutagenesis in selected positions within the core region of Rop to generate a large library of variants. Via a robust cell-based screening method, we can screen for the active variants based on the fluorescent phenotype. By employing a growth selection based on the function of Rop, we can enrich the active variants in the population and confirm the sequences in large-scale. A high-throughput thermal scanning technique has been developed to obtain insight into the stability effects of the hydrophobic core repacking. Combined with other biophysical characterization and MD simulation, we will further define the roles of the hydrophobic core in protein folding and functioning. Here we present a preliminary analysis of over 300 variants, which has revealed unexpected sequence patterns and also produced some of the most stable variants of Rop that have been engineered to date.\n\nTrack: Protein and Ligand - A New Marriage Between an Old Couple\n\nABS067\n\nDeveloping Small-Molecule Probes for Activity-Based Profiling of Tyrosine Phosphatases\n\nSuk ho Hong, Sarah Xi, Lauren Tang, Andrew Johns, Allyson Li, Marko Jovanovic, Neel Shah\n\nColumbia University (United States)\n\nTyrosine phosphatases, enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, make up one of the largest families of signaling proteins in humans. As protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification that can modulate protein-protein interactions, protein localization, stability, and enzyme activity, tyrosine phosphatases possess significant roles in signaling pathways of both normal cellular processes and a wide variety of diseases, including cancer. However, we know relatively little about how and when tyrosine phosphatases are regulated, calling for development of more tools to probe their activities in various signaling contexts. Here, we describe our efforts to design chemical probes that covalently label the active sites of tyrosine phosphatases and report on their activity across the proteome. First, we designed a small library of candidate molecules, by combining a series of thiol-reactive functional groups that could label the catalytic cysteine residue, along with a variety of scaffold structures. The library was then screened for reactivity against thiols and specificity towards target active sites. Then, several candidates were augmented with alkyne groups to enable click chemistry with biotin tags for enrichment, and subjected to further biochemical assays. Finally, lysates and intact cells were treated with these candidates and analyzed in mass spectrometry proteomics experiments to detect labeled proteins. We showed that these molecules can label certain tyrosine phosphatases with specificity. With this ability, the probes offer a way to investigate changes on abundance and activity levels across the tyrosine phosphatase family upon differing signaling states or cell types. Furthermore, we anticipate that our design efforts will also yield new insights into the general development processes of activity-based probes.\n\nTrack: Cellular Tasks\n\nABS068\n\nX-ray crystallographic structure of BrxA, an enzyme involved in redox homeostasis in gram-positive organisms\n\nPaul Cook, Paul Cook, Colin McHugh\n\nGrand Valley State University (United States)\n\nBacillithiol is a low-molecular-weight thiol produced by many gram-positive bacteria, such as the pathogenic organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis. It is involved in detoxification of xenobiotic agents as well as redox homeostasis. During oxidative stress, bacillithiol is added to protein thiols by forming mixed disulfides with cysteine side chains to protect them from oxidative damage. Bacilliredoxins are small enzymes that remove these mixed bacillithiol disulfides from protected proteins through a disulfide-exchange reaction, which restores the thiol group on the target protein. BrxA is a bacilliredoxin from S. aureus that has been used in biosensor applications for bacillithiol detection and antibiotic efficacy assessment. The broad thioredoxin family of proteins typically contains a CXXC motif, whereas bacilliredoxins like BrxA contain an unusual conserved CGC motif. Furthermore, their exact catalytic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we describe a 1.6 Å resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of the bacilliredoxin BrxA from S. aureus. The structure adopts the typical thioredoxin fold and contains bacillithiol in a mixed disulfide with Cys54. The crystal structure, coupled with a site-directed mutagenic study, demonstrates that an inter-subunit disulfide linkage at Cys56 forms under oxidizing conditions and may play a role in dimer stabilization. This structure represents the first-ever crystallographic observation of bacillithiol, and the findings presented here will provide insight into the function of BrxA and other bacilliredoxins.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS070\n\nUse of Deepmind Alphafold to Recreate Prion Protein in silico Predicted Structures\n\nJennifer Grant\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Stout (United States)\n\nWhile prion proteins are known to be soluble in their PrPC state, in pathologies they aggregate to form fibrils. Although these rich in beta-sheet, the tertiary structure of fibril-forming prions remains elusive. Questions remain about how these structures rich in beta-sheet form.\n\nIn addition to several NMR structures of recombinant human prion proteins containing these mutations, several in silico models predicting the effects of these mutations have been published. Research suggests that destabilization of the beta2/alpha2 loop allows the prion to protein to sample conformations that can lead to protein misfolding.\n\nHere, the ten point-mutations evaluated in silico by Meli, et al. [PLoS One. 2011 Apr 28;6(4)] were re-predicted using Deepmind Alphafold. Each structure was then compared against the NMR ensemble structure 1qlz using the ‘super’ command in Pymol, and RMSD values were recorded. These Alphafold predictions were also compared to the in silico predictions of Meli, et al.\n\nIn terms of overall tertiary structure and most elements of secondary structure, Deepmind Alphafold predictions successfully recapitulated the overall NMR solution structure.\n\nHowever, Deepmind Alphafold predictions for the D178N, T188K, and E196K mutants revealed substantial deviations from the NMR structure 1qlz, within the beta2/alpha2 loop; these Alphafold predicted structures did not reveal a 3/10 helix. Interestingly, the alpha3 helix in the Alphafold prediction for the F198S mutant seemed to deviate from the 1qlz NMR structure more than any of the other predictions.\n\nTrack: Synthetic Biology & Biosensing: Engineering Protein Components\n\nABS071\n\nEngineering Protein-based Materials via Synthetic biology\n\nFuzhong Zhang\n\nWashington University in St. Louis (United States)\n\nNature has evolved a wide range of protein-based, high-performance materials that can outperform the best available synthetic materials. Producing these protein materials can provide a renewable and environmentally-friendly route to replace current petroleum-derived materials. However, the natural biosynthetic process of these materials are often impossible to harness for scalable production as they are produced in limited quantity by slow growing organisms. Engineering microbes to produce these high-performance materials could provide an attractive solution, but face multiple technical challenges. In this talk, I will introduce our recently developed strategies using synthetic biology and protein engineering to microbially produce megadalton protein based materials, including titin polymers and amyloid-silk hybrid proteins. Our engineered hybrid proteins include structural and function domains from multiple proteins to deliver desirable and tunable properties. We then engineer bacteria to overexpress these highly repetitive, high molecular weight hybrid proteins that incorporate non-canonical amino acids. Additional, we developed a strategy to perform protein polymerization reactions in living cells using folded proteins as monomers. These synthetic strategies have resulted ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) titin polymers and amyloid-silk proteins. To explore their applications, these proteins were spun to fibers that not only recapture highly desirable properties of their natural counterparts (i.e., high damping capacity and mechanical recovery for titin, stable β-sheet structures for amyloid) but also exhibit exceptionally high strength, toughness, and damping energy — outperforming many synthetic and natural polymers. Our strategies in protein engineering and synthetic biology may have broad applications, leading to various novel protein-based materials.\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS072\n\nComplete mutational mapping of a GTPase switch in vivo reveals novel allosteric regulation\n\nChristopher Mathy, Parul Mishra, Julia Flynn, Tina Perica, David Mavor, Daniel Bolon, Tanja Kortemme\n\nUCSF (United States)\n\nGTPases are highly regulated molecular switches that control signaling in cells. Switching occurs via catalyzed GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, yet the importance of additional regulation for biological function - suggested by high GTPase conservation and centrality in protein networks - is unclear. Here we map the function of each residue in the central GTPase Gsp1/Ran in its native biological network by deep mutagenesis. Quantitative fitness measurements for 4333 point mutations revealed an unexpected toxic/gain-of-function response resulting from 29% of mutations, located throughout the Gsp1/Ran structure including at several novel allosteric sites. Using biochemical measurements and computational modeling in Rosetta, we show that these sites are coupled to the active site, and can modulate the kinetics of GTPase switching. We identify distinct mechanisms by which perturbations at these sites alter Gsp1/Ran cellular function. Our systematic discovery and functional annotation of new regulatory sites provides a residue-level map which we show generalizes to other GTPases such as Ras. This “functional anatomy” of a GTPase molecular switch opens avenues to interrogate and target GTPases controlling many essential biological processes. Finally, our study adds to the emerging linkage between allosteric regulation of switch balance, the ultrasensitivity of switches, and functional consequences for cellular regulation.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS073\n\nAllosteric Regulation of E3 Ligase Parkin Studied by HydrogenDeuterium Exchange Measured by Mass Spectrometry (nsHX-MS) and Single Molecule FRET (smFRET)\n\nXiang Ye, Sravya Kotaru, Shannen Cravens, Shweta Him, Yale E. Goldman, Peng-Hsun Chen, Wenshe Liu, S. Walter Englander, A. Joshua Wand\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Biophysics, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Texas A&M University (United States)\n\nParkin is a multi-domain ubiquitin E3 ligase and is central to the controlled destruction of damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). To function normally, Parkin needs to maintain a delicate balance between an auto-inhibited resting state and an activated state competent in ubiquitinating mitochondria outer membrane proteins. Its function is tightly regulated by several allosteric regulators and post-translational modifications. A number of Parkin genetic variants across the protein sequence are found to be correlated with human diseases such as early onset Parkinson's disease. Despite several crystal structures being available, the mechanism(s) by which these mutations affect Parkin function remains elusive.\n\nTo better understand the biophysical basis of allosteric regulation of Parkin, we build a state-ensemble based model derived from rigorous statistical thermodynamic principles. The population distribution of high-energy partially unfolded state ensemble and its shift in response to allosteric signals are crucial to understanding allosteric regulations. We perform nsHX-MS to detect and map the high energy states populated by Parkin. HX due to large scale sub-global and global unfolding events is promoted by titrating in low concentrations of chaotrope, which in turn, enables mapping Parkin folding stability in a structure-resolved manner. Here, we focus on interaction between the inhibitory Ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) and the rest of Parkin. We've found the interaction is only marginally stabilizing which explains why many seemingly mild amino-acid substitutions could affect Parkin activation.\n\nOur smFRET measurements further corroborate and complement the nsHX-MS results. In these measurements, we show Parkin partition into a major population corresponding to the auto-inhibited state and a minor one where the distance between the Ubl and the Parkin core is much larger than in the auto-inhibited state. The latter may represent an activated state.

Arginase is a ubiquitous enzyme hydrolyzing L-arginine to generate L-ornithine and urea, whereas DcsB hydrolyzes Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine (L-NOHA), an arginase inhibitor, to generate L-ornithine and hydroxyurea. We determined the crystal structure of DcsB associated with L-ornithine and that with the tetrahedral derivative of 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid, whose boron atom forms a covalent bond with an oxygen atom bridging two manganese ions at the active center. The substrate-binding pocket of DcsB is narrower than that of arginase, suggesting that DcsB is unsuitable for the binding of L-NOHA in an inhibitory manner. The transition state-like structure demonstrated that Asp210 and Glu241 have a role to trap a positively charged ion near the dimanganese cluster. Kinetic analysis using the mutated DcsB showed that the enzyme employs different catalytic mechanisms under the neutral and alkaline pH conditions. Glu241 in DcsB is likely involved in the recognition of the hydroxyguanidino group of L-NOHA, whereas Asp210, in cooperation with Glu241, seems to contribute to the reactivity toward the protonated L-NOHA, which is a preferable species under the neutral pH conditions. After entering of the protonated L-NOHA to the substrate-binding pocket of DcsB, a hydronium ion may be trapped at the positive ion-binding site. Then, the ion serves as a specific acid catalyst to facilitate the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate of L-NOHA.\n\nTrack: Integrating Techniques to Address Challenges in Protein Structural Biology\n\nABS076\n\nStatic and Dynamic Characterization of Protein Structures on Ramachandran Plots\n\nSoon Woo Park, Byung Ho Lee, Seung Hun Song, Moon Ki Kim\n\nSungkyunkwan University (South Korea)\n\nProtein structures are directly related to their biological functions or processes. Therefore, various techniques have been developed to describe their shapes and among them, Ramachandran plot which expresses two torsion angles (phi, psi) of the backbone on a two-dimensional plane has played an important role in structural biology for decades. Although many studies have been carried out in terms of Ramachandran plot to analyze the protein structure, Ramachandran plot is still constructed by only small number of dataset and further it cannot specifically reflect a steric structure of proteins.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed both static and dynamic characteristics of the secondary structures of proteins. In the static part, Ramachandran plot was revisited for high-resolution proteins (<2.0 Å) released in the protein data bank (PDB) until March 2022. And then, amino acid propensities according to residue depth were expressed on a Ramachandran plot using the DEPTH program. In the dynamic part, normal mode analysis (NMA) based on elastic network model (ENM) was performed for dataset by the Korea SKKU morph server (KOSMOS). All NMA results were built as a database in KOSMOS web server so that all researchers could use them in various ways. In addition, by statistically analyzing the NMA results, the degree of conformational change according to the secondary structure of all proteins belonging to the dataset was expressed in the phi-psi space. Through this analysis, we quantitatively surveyed the contribution of the protein conformational change on Ramachandran plot. Provided that biological functions of proteins are closely related to their structures and dynamics, this bioinformatics approach will play an important role in functional biomaterial design as well as protein folding prediction.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS077\n\nInDels in the loop region shapes new protein function in the evolution of GH19 chitinase\n\nDan Kozome, Paola Laurino\n\nOkinawa Institute of Science and Technology (Japan)\n\nIn addition to substitutions, insertions and deletions (InDels) play a key role in the emergence of enzyme functions. However, our understanding of the role of InDels is limited compared to the one of substitution. Most protein engineering methods focus on exploring the sequence space of the fixed length while sequence space including InDels has been overlooked due to the ambiguity in evolutionary information and the difficulties in creating libraries. Herein we choose glycoside hydrolase family 19 (GH19) chitinase as a candidate to investigate how InDels in the loop regions contribute to the emergence of new functions in proteins. The function of GH19 varies from chitinase activity to antifungal activity, depending on the presence/absence of loop regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the ancestral nodes where the InDels in loop regions occurred. Characterizations of eight protein variants based on two reconstructed ancestral proteins with different loop combinations revealed the critical loop for new function acquisition. This study suggests that non-catalytic loop additions/removals are one of the strategies that Nature applies, to acquire new protein functions.\n\nTrack: High Throughput Protein Science\n\nABS078\n\nModulation of Ribosomal Frameshifting by Cotranslational Folding and Misfolding of the Nascent Polypeptide Chain\n\nPatrick Carmody, Matthew Zimmer, Charles Kuntz, Haley Harrington, Kate Duckworth, Wesley Penn, Suchetana Mukhopadhyay, Thomas Miller, Jonathan Schlebach\n\nIndiana University (United States)\n\nMembrane protein folding is an error-prone process that is subject to numerous forms of biochemical regulation. The ribosome and its ensemble of accessory proteins employ a variety of mechanisms to monitor membrane protein folding and misfolding during translation that are essential for the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Nevertheless, it's unclear how this biosynthetic machinery detects and responds to folding and misfolding in real time. We recently found that the mechanical forces generated by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of transmembrane domains can stimulate a translational recoding event known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF). Alphaviruses modulate the efficiency of -1PRF through crosstalk between an mRNA structure that pauses the ribosome on a slippery-sequence of the transcript during the translocon-mediated cotranslational folding. Based on the features of this motif, we searched the human transcriptome for other potential sites that may promote this cotranslational feedback and identified hundred potential candidates. Preliminary efforts to validate certain hits have identified an active -1PRF motif within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the misfolding of which causes cystic fibrosis. Ribosomal frameshifting at this site results in the premature termination of translation, and knocking out this motif partially restores the expression of a common CFTR variant (ΔF508) that undergoes cotranslational misfolding. These findings suggest a novel role for ribosomal frameshifting in eukaryotic protein homeostasis.\n\nTrack: Synthetic Biology & Biosensing: Engineering Protein Components\n\nABS079\n\nDeveloping An Ex Vivo Rubber Biosynthesis Platform From Prenyl Transferase Enzyme Complexes\n\nGrisel Ponciano, Colleen McMahan, Patrick Scannon, Christie Howard, Aldo Duran, Luis Fonseca, Chen Dong, Paul Hoeprich\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (United States)\n\nNatural rubber (NR) is a cis-polyisoprene biopolymer essential for the manufacture of thousands of industrial products. Synthetic rubber can be used to manufacture some of those products, but its physicochemical properties are suboptimal for many critical applications such as tires and medical products, and its carbon footprint is environmentally damaging. A single plant species, Hevea brasiliensis (Hevea), has been the sole producer of NR in the world for over a century. Biological and geopolitical concerns currently threatening Hevea rubber production is driving efforts to develop other rubber producing plants as well as ex vivo rubber biosynthesis platforms.\n\nNR is synthesized in vivo within the lipidaceous monolayer membrane of round structures known as rubber particles (RP) where the hydrophobic rubber molecule is effectively sequestered from the aqueous environment of the plant cell cytosol. Plant functional genomics studies have identified several RP-associated proteins, and two of these, cis-prenyl transferase (CPT) and CPT-binding protein (CBP), appear to be essential for NR biosynthesis. These two proteins form either a heterodimer, or another yet to be characterized quaternary structure leading to an active enzymatic complex. Here we demonstrate that recombinant CPT and CBP proteins, from two rubber-producing plant species, are enzymatically active and synthesize polyisoprenes but not natural rubber. Hence, reconstitution of prenyl transferase enzyme activity is necessary but not sufficient for ex vivo rubber synthesis. However, we demonstrate changes in the reaction constituents, such as organic solvents, provide improved conditions for higher enzyme activity.\n\nTrack: Structure and Dynamics Perspectives on Enzyme Function\n\nABS081\n\nGuanidine degradation in bacteria reveals a new, broadly distributed carboxyguanidine deiminase enzyme family\n\nMartin St. Maurice, Jordan Mewhorter, Nicholas Schneider\n\nMarquette University, Department of Biological Sciences (United States)\n\nThe recent discovery of operons controlled by guanidinium-binding riboswitches has generated renewed interest in bacterial guanidine degradation and export pathways. The genes encoding the enzymes urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase are well represented in operons controlled by the guanidine-I riboswitch. These enzymes function in tandem to facilitate the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, yielding a similar outcome to the action of urease, but through a mechanistically distinct process. We and others have demonstrated that urea carboxylase has a strong substrate preference for guanidine over urea, suggesting that the primary enzymatic function is to act as a guanidine carboxylase (GC) to activate guanidine for subsequent degradation. We demonstrate that a heteromeric enzyme, previously annotated as a “urea carboxylase-associated protein”, is required for the decomposition of guanidine to ammonia and carbon dioxide. This enzyme (CgdAB) acts as a carboxyguanidine deiminase to hydrolyze carboxyguanidine to allophanate for subsequent degradation by allophanate hydrolase. Closer inspection of CgdAB reveals that it belongs to a large, functionally uncharacteri"
