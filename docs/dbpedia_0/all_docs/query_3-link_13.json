        "text": "The photodissociation dynamics of jet-cooled thiomethoxy radical (CH3S) via the B̃2A2 ← X̃2E transition was studied in the ultraviolet region of 216–225 nm using the high-n Rydberg H-atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique. The H-atom product channel was directly observed from the H-atom TOF spectra (using both dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide precursors). The H-atom photofragment yield spectrum showed a broad feature in the region of 216–225 nm and three B̃2A2 vibronic peaks at 217.7, 220.3, and 221.5 nm. Several H-atom dissociation pathways were identified. The excited-state CH3S had a repulsive, prompt dissociation pathway to the ground-state H2CS(X̃1A1) + H products, with the product translational energy peaking near the maximum available energy, a predominant C–S stretch vibrational excitation in H2CS(X̃1A1), and an anisotropic angular distribution. The main pathway was the H2CS(X̃1A1) + H product channel via the unimolecular dissociation of internally hot CH3S radical in the ground electronic state after internal conversion from the electronic excited state, with a modest translational energy release (peaking at a low translational energy of ∼11 kcal/mol and extending near the maximum available energy) and a nearly isotropic angular distribution. The H + H2CS(Ã1A2) and H + H2CS(ã3A2) product channels were also observed but were minor channels. The C–H bond dissociation energy of CH3S to the H + H2CS(X̃1A1) products was determined to be 48.8 ± 0.7 kcal/mol.\n\nThe decomposition of isopropyl nitrate was measured behind incident shock waves using laser schlieren densitometry in a diaphragmless shock tube. Experiments were conducted over the temperature range of 700–1000 K and at pressures of 71, 126, and 240 Torr. Electronic structure theory and RRKM Master Equation methods were used to predict the decomposition kinetics. RRKM/ME parameters were optimized against the experimental data to provide an accurate prediction over a broader range of conditions. The initial decomposition i-C3H7ONO2 ⇌ i-C3H7O + NO2 has a high-pressure limit rate coefficient of 5.70 × 1022T–1.80 exp[−21287.5/T] s–1. A new chemical kinetic mechanism was developed to model the chemistry after the initial dissociation. A new shock tube module was developed for Cantera, which allows for arbitrarily large mechanisms in the simulation of laser schlieren experiments. The present work is in good agreement with previous experimental studies.\n\nAlthough both atomic carbon and water are omnipresent in human life, there is a debate about the possibility of carbon reaction with water. Some low-temperature spectroscopic investigations have rejected the reaction, whereas some room-temperature experiments and theoretical studies have accepted the possibility of the reaction by reporting rate coefficients ranging from 105 to 109 L mol–1 s–1. This study provides new lines of evidence about the reaction through exploration of the reaction mechanism using the CCSD(T) method and solving the corresponding master equation by following two main approaches. According to the results, the rate coefficient of the reaction is significantly influenced by the tunneling and hindered rotation effects, in addition to the selected total angular momentum (J). Furthermore, the total rate coefficient of the reaction increases dramatically (from 107 to 1011 L mol–1 s–1) with the rise of temperature from 100 to 4000 K, while the total rate coefficient is insensitive to pressure (0.1–10 atm). Despite some differences between the results of the two approaches, the rate coefficients of both methods are consistent with the previously reported rate coefficients. Also, in agreement with the previous studies, the major products are 2HOC + 2H and 2HCO + 2H. In general, the findings approve the occurrence of the title reaction and indicate that the mentioned conflict is due to the sensitivity of the reaction to the investigated temperature and J level. The sensitivity does not permit low-temperature spectroscopic studies to detect any products and varies the measured and calculated rate coefficients.\n\nThe kinetic energy dependences of the reactions of ThO+, ThO2+, and OThOD+ with D2O, ThO2+ with D2, and OThOD+ with Xe were studied using guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry. Exothermic formation of OThOD+ is the dominant process observed in reactions of both ThO+ and ThO2+ with D2O. Minor products formed in endothermic reactions include ThO2+, DThO+, and ThO2D2+. OThOD+ is also formed in the reaction of ThO2+ with D2 but in an endothermic process. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of OThOD+ with Xe leads to endothermic loss of the hydroxide ligand. OThOD+ reacts further with D2O to form the associative complex ThO3D3+, which is long-lived before dissociating back to the reactants. The OThOD+–D2O bond energy of the associative complex is measured to be 2.96 ± 0.05 eV by modeling the kinetic energy-dependent cross section for association using a phase space theory model that rigorously conserves angular momentum. By comparison with theory, this bond energy identifies the ThO3D3+ species as the trihydroxide cation, Th(OD)3+. From the endothermic reactions and CID of OThOD+ with Xe, the OTh+–D, OTh+–O, and OTh+–OD bond dissociation energies (BDEs) are measured to be 2.33 ± 0.24, 4.66 ± 0.15, and 6.00 ± 0.17 eV, respectively. All four of these BDEs are experimentally determined for the first time and agree reasonably well with values calculated at the B3LYP, B3PW91, and PBE0 levels of theory with cc-pVQZ basis sets. Complete potential energy surfaces for all reactions were calculated at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level and elucidate the mechanisms for all processes observed.\n\nThe UV photodissociation of pyruvic acid (PA) is studied in molecular beams using time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy and time-sliced velocity map imaging (VMI) following excitation to the first absorption band (S1 ← S0) at 330–380 nm. CH3CO, HOCO, CO, CH3, and H are detected as photodissociation products. The photofragment yield (PFY) spectrum of the H product is recorded at 350–380 nm in He and Ar carrier gases. The spectrum shows sharp vibrational features reflecting the significant rotational cooling achieved in the molecular beam. It matches well the broad features observed in the room temperature absorption spectrum and indicates that the S1 state lives longer than a picosecond. The origin band of the S1 ← S0 transition is identified at 26 710 cm–1, and progressions in the CH3 and C–C torsional modes are tentatively assigned. Kinetic energy release (KER) and angular distributions of CH3CO, HOCO, CO, CH3, and H fragments indicate that additional photon absorption from S1 to the S2/S3 states is facile and is followed by rapid dissociation to the observed fragments. On the basis of the energetics of the different dissociation pathways and analyses of the observed KER distributions, three-body fragmentation processes are proposed as major contributors to the formation of the observed products.\n\nThe modification of vibrational dynamics is essential for controlling chemical reactions and IR photonic applications. The hybridization between cavity modes and molecular vibrational modes provides a new way to control molecular dynamics. In this work, we study the dynamics of molecular vibrational polaritons in various solvent environments. We find the dynamics of the polariton system is strongly influenced by the nature of the solvents. While the relaxation from upper polariton (UP) to dark modes is always fast (<5 ps) regardless of the medium, lower polariton (LP) in low polarity solvents shows much slower transfer (10–30 ps) into dark modes, despite the fact that the LP lifetime remains within 5 ps. This result suggests that in the latter media, the energy pumped into the LP is first transferred into intermediate states which only subsequently decay into dark modes. In contrast, in solvent environments that strongly interact with the solute, the LP population relaxes into the dense dark state manifold within a much faster time scale. We propose the intermediate state to be the high-lying excited states of dark modes, which are effectively populated by LP via, e.g., ladder-climbing. Such population in the high-lying states can be retained for tens of picoseconds, which could be pertinent to recently observed cavity-modified chemistry.\n\nCoumarins are well-known to exhibit environment-dependent excited-state behavior. We have exploited this feature to probe the accessibility of solvent water molecules to coumarins (guest) encapsulated within an organic capsule (host). Two sets of coumarins, one small that fits well within the capsule and the other larger that fits within an enlarged capsule, are used as guests. In our study, the two sets of coumarins serve different purposes: one is employed to explore electron transfer across the capsule and the other to release photoprotected acids into the aqueous environment. The capsule is made up of two molecules of octa acid (OA) and is soluble in an aqueous medium under slightly basic conditions. Molecular modeling studies revealed that while the OA capsule is fully closed with no access to water in the case of smaller coumarins, with the larger molecules, the capsule is not tight and the guest is in contact with water molecules, the number being dependent on the size of the coumarin. We have used the ultrafast time-dependent Stokes shift method to understand the solvent dynamics around the above guest molecules encapsulated within an OA capsule in an aqueous medium. Results depict that for the smaller sets of coumarins, water cannot access the guests within the OA cavity during their excited state lifetime. However, the case is completely different for the larger coumaryl esters. Distorted capsule structure exposes the guest to water, and a dynamics Stokes shift is observed. The average solvation time decreases with the increasing size of guests that clearly indicates accessibility of the encapsulated guests toward greater number of water molecules as the capsule structure distorts with increasing size of the guests. Results of the ultrafast solvation dynamics are consistent with that of molecular dynamics simulation.\n\nBy combining a newly developed spin–orbit electronic state-selected ion source for vanadium cations (V+) with a double quadrupole–double octopole mass spectrometer, we have investigated in detail the chemical reactivity or integral cross sections (σ’s) for the reactions of V+[a5DJ (J = 0, 1), a5FJ (J = 1, 2), and a3FJ (J = 2, 3)] ion with a deuterium molecule (D2). The vanadium deuteride ion (VD+) is identified to be the only product ion formed in the center-of-mass collision energies of Ecm = 0.1–10.0 V. No J dependence for the σ’s is discernible for individual electronic states, indicating that the spin–orbit coupling is weak and has little effect on the chemical reactivity of the titled reaction. The maximum σ value for the V+(a3FJ) state [σ(a3FJ)] is about 7 and 70 times larger than those for σ(a5DJ) and σ(a5FJ), respectively, showing that the triplet V+(a3FJ) state is dominantly more reactive than the quintet states. Although the V+(a5FJ) state is 0.3 eV higher than the V+(a5DJ) ground state, the chemical reactivity of the V+(a5FJ) state is significantly lower than that of the V+(a5DJ) state, clearly indicating that the differences in chemical activity observed are due to quantum electronic states rather than energy effects. The Ecm thresholds determined for σ(a5DJ), σ(a5FJ), and σ(a3FJ) are consistent with the respective energetics for the formation of VD+ from the V+(a5DJ, a5FJ, and a3FJ) + D2 reactions. The analysis of Ecm threshold measurements yields a bond energy of D0(V+–D) = 2.5 ± 0.2 eV, suggesting that the previously reported values are too low by up to 0.4 eV. The large differences for σ(a5DJ, a5FJ, and a3FJ) observed here indicate that the activation of D2 by a V+ ion can be efficiently controlled by selecting the V+ electronic state as well as the Ecm. The quantum state-selected σ values presented here can also serve as experimental benchmarks for first-principles theoretical reaction dynamics calculations.\n\nBarrierless intermolecular proton transfer from a CH bond has recently been reported in the vertical ionization of the trimethyl amine (TMA) dimer. This result indicates the remarkable enhancement of the proton-donating ability of the CH bond in its cationic state. In the present study, we have carried out an infrared spectroscopy of the neutral and cationic TMA in the CH stretch region and their theoretical calculations to investigate the mechanism of enhancement of the proton-donating ability in the cationic state. In the spectrum of the cation, the CH stretch band shows a long tail of up to 2600 cm–1. This tail component is attributed to the CH bond hyperconjugated with the nonbonding orbital at the nitrogen atom through geometry deformation (excitation of molecular vibrations) with the excess energy upon photoionization. This hyperconjugation causes the delocalization of the σ electron of the CH bond to the singly occupied nonbonding orbital so that the proton-donating ability of the CH is enhanced. It is shown that the excitation of the CN stretching vibration is especially effective in promoting the hyperconjugation.\n\nIn this study, we show that the “Michler’s base” motif can be combined in a donor–acceptor arrangement with a range of acceptor units (indandione, indandione with cyano substituents, barbituric acid, or rhodanine) to give photophysical properties that are dominated by delocalized excited states. By changing the acceptor unit and by altering the planarity of this system, it is possible to tune the low-energy absorption feature in terms of intensity from 23 000 to 67 000 M–1 cm–1 and energy between 500 and 700 nm. Resonance Raman spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory indicate that this absorption feature has two underlying transitions: a weaker charge-transfer transition around 500 nm and a strong mixed or delocalized transition between 550 and 700 nm. Generally, these compounds are not strongly emissive; however, dual emission is observed, and the relative intensity of the two states can be modulated by solvent polarity. The energy of these emissive states does not correlate with the Lippert–Mataga analysis in which the Stokes shift is related to the solvent polarity (Δf).\n\nExperiments on the lowest lying singlet and triplet states of didehydropyrazine isomers (that focus on energy gaps, geometries, and vibrational frequencies) have been carried out computationally by implementing the improved virtual orbital-based multireference (MR) ab initio methods. Pyrazines possess a reasonable MR nature making their description challenging with the conventional quantum chemical approaches. Although wave functions of the diradicals usually have two dominant configurations, a larger reference space is warranted to consistently and accurately describe pyrazine diradicals indicating the complex nature of the systems. Present calculations predict a singlet ground state for ortho- and para-pyrazines, while a triplet ground state is suggested for the meta isomer. The adiabatic singlet–triplet energy gap for the para form is found to be notably higher (by 28.4 kcal/mol) compared to ortho (2.0 kcal/mol) and meta isomers (−5.1 kcal/mol). Accurate and reliable computations are imperative for forecasting the state-ordering in such diradicals. The structural properties obtained from the present calculations lend strong support toward future experimental explorations on these systems.\n\nHydrazine–boranes (H2NNH2·BH3 and H3B·NH2NH2·BH3) have been proposed for the storage of hydrogen, but these compounds have not created scope for extensive research works as ammonia– and methylamine–boranes have made these last decades. In the exciting research devoted to energy storage with environmentally friendly processes, hydrazine–borane, hydrazine–bisborane, and their simply substituted derivatives could provide a satisfactory response for hydrogen production and recyclability of the formed products. To date, knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of these compounds is still scarce. In this paper, the electronic structure of various hydrazine–boranes complexes is studied by ultraviolet-photoelectron spectroscopy (UV-PES), which is the experimental technique giving direct access to the energy of occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, UV-PE spectra were registered and first ionization energies were determined. Understanding of different types of interactions between nitrogen lone pairs and their variations by complexation has been our essential goal in these studies. In particular, clear stabilization of all molecular orbital energies is noted when complexation with borane takes place. Evolution of the σBN bond during the hydrogen release process upon thermal activation has also been studied experimentally by UV-PES and supported by quantum chemical calculations.\n\nThe gas-phase acidity of ferrocene (ΔH°acid(1) = 391.5 ± 1.3 kcal mol–1) and electron affinity of the ferrocenyl radical (EA(1r) = 1.74 ± 0.08 eV) were measured in a Fourier transform mass spectrometer and combined in a thermodynamic cycle with the known ionization energy of the hydrogen atom to afford the C–H bond dissociation energy of 1 (BDE(1) = 118.0 ± 2.3 kcal mol–1). Companion M06-2X but not B3LYP computations reproduce each of these thermodynamic quantities and are in accord with an unusually strong aromatic C–H BDE. Natural population analysis and atomic polar tensor charges indicate that a covalent description of ferrocene with a neutral iron atom is a better representation of this compound than an ionic one with a doubly charged Fe2+ center. Predicted structural differences upon deprotonation of MCp2, M = Fe and Mg, are also in accord with this view.\n\nFor aerosol particles that exist in highly viscous, diffusion-limited states, steep chemical gradients are expected to form during photochemical aging in the atmosphere. Under these conditions, species at the aerosol surface are more rapidly transformed than molecules residing in the particle interior. To examine the formation and evolution of chemical gradients at aerosol interfaces, the heterogeneous reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on ∼200 nm particles of pure squalane (a branched, liquid hydrocarbon) and octacosane (a linear, solid hydrocarbon) and binary mixtures of the two are used to understand how diffusion limitations and phase separation impact the particle reactivity. Aerosol mass spectrometry is used to measure the effective heterogeneous OH uptake coefficient (γeff) and oxidation kinetics in the bulk, which are compared with the elemental composition of the surface obtained using X-ray photoemission. When diffusion rates are fast relative to the reaction frequency, as is the case for squalane and low-viscosity squalane–octacosane mixtures, the reaction is efficient (γeff ∼ 0.3) and only limited by the arrival of OH to the interface. However, for cases, where the diffusion rates are slower than reaction rates, as in pure octacosane and higher-viscosity squalane–octacosane mixtures, the heterogeneous reaction occurs in a mixing-limited regime and is ∼10× slower (γeff ∼ 0.03). This is in contrast to carbon and oxygen K edge X-ray absorption measurements that show that the octacosane interface is oxidized much more rapidly than that of pure squalane particles. The O/C ratio of the surface (estimated to be the top 6–8 nm of the interface) is measured to change with rate constants of (3.0 ± 0.9) × 10–13 and (8.6 ± 1.2) × 10–13 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 for squalane and octacosane particles, respectively. The differences in surface oxidation rates are analyzed using a previously published reaction-diffusion model, which suggests that a 1–2 nm highly oxidized crust forms on octacosane particles, whereas in pure squalane, the reaction products are homogeneously mixed within the aerosol. This work illustrates how diffusion limitations can form particles with highly oxidized surfaces even at relatively low oxidant exposures, which is in turn expected to influence their microphysics in the atmosphere.\n\nModels suggest BrHgONO to be the major Hg(II) species formed in the global oxidation of Hg(0), and BrHgONO undergoes rapid photolysis to produce the thermally stable radical BrHgO•. We previously used quantum chemistry to demonstrate that BrHgO• can, like •OH radicals, readily abstract hydrogen atoms from sp3-hybridized carbon atoms as well as add to NO and NO2. In the present work, we reveal that BrHgO• can also add to C2H4 to form BrHgOCH2CH2•, although this addition appears to proceed with a lower rate constant than the analogous addition of •OH to C2H4. Additionally, BrHgO• can readily react with HCHO in two different ways: either by addition to carbon or by abstraction of a hydrogen atom. The minimum energy path for the BrHgO• + HCHO reaction bifurcates, forming two prereactive complexes, each of which passes over a separate transition state to form different products. Rate constants computed using Master Equation simulations indicate that hydrogen abstraction dominates over addition at atmospheric temperatures (200 K ≤ T ≤ 333 K) and pressures (0.01 atm ≤ P ≤ 1 atm). Subsequently, we compute the atmospheric fate of BrHgO• in a variety of air masses and find that BrHgOH formation via hydrogen abstraction will be the predominant fate (∼70–99%), with major competition (∼20%) coming from addition to NO and NO2 in polluted urban regions and stratospheric air. Given the absence of either field data on the identity of Hg(II) compounds or experimental data on the kinetics of BrHgO• reactions, the present manuscript should provide guidance to a range of scientists studying atmospheric mercury.\n\nIn the present study, we propose a new set of descriptors that, along with a few structural features of nanoporous materials, can be used by machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions of the gas uptake capacities of these materials. All new descriptors closely resemble the helium atom void fraction of the material framework. However, instead of a helium atom, a particle with an appropriately defined van der Waals radius is used. The set of void fractions of a small number of these particles is found to be sufficient to characterize uniquely the structure of each material and to account for the most important topological features. We assess the accuracy of our approach by examining the predictions of the random forest algorithm in the relative small dataset of the computation-ready, experimental (CoRE) MOFs (∼4700 structures) that have been experimentally synthesized and whose geometrical/structural features have been accurately calculated before. We first performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to accurately determine their methane uptake capacities at two different temperatures (280 and 298 K) and three different pressures (1, 5.8, and 65 bar). Despite the high chemical and structural diversity of the CoRE MOFs, it was found that the use of the proposed descriptors significantly improves the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm, particularly at low pressures, compared to the predictions made based solely on the rest structural features. More importantly, the algorithm can be easily adapted for other types of nanoporous materials beyond MOFs. Convergence of the predictions was reached even for small training set sizes compared to what was found in previous works using the hypothetical MOF database."
