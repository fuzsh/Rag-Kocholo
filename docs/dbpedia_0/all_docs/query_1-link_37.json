        "text": "Materials and Methods\n\nPhyscomitrium patens tissue culture for maintenance and spore germination analyses\n\nPhyscomitrium patens Hedw. ‘Gransden UK’/Birmingham (Gd-UK/Birmingham) strain (Haas et al., 2020) wild type was used for comparison with Ppdella mutant strains provided by Professor Nicholas Harberd, University of Oxford (Ppdellaa, Ppdellab, Ppdellaab, Yasumura et al., 2007). Physcomitrium tissue was cultured for phenotyping and spores germinated as described previously (Moody et al., 2012; Vesty et al., 2016). Sporulation was induced and sporophytes harvested as described in Moody et al. (2012). Further details are provided in Supporting Information Methods S1.\n\nPhyscomitrium patens tissue culture for gametangia/sporophyte and crossing analyses\n\nFor gametangia analyses, P. patens Gd-UK and Ppdellaab were cultivated as described in Hiss et al. (2017). Tissues for crossing analyses (Gd-UK, Ppdellaab, Re-mCherry, Ppccdc39) were cultivated as described in Perroud et al. (2018 and 2019), Meyberg et al. (2020). Further details are given in Methods S1.\n\nArabidopsis growth\n\nArabidopsis thaliana L. ‘Landsberg erecta (Ler)’ wild-type ecotype and pRGA::GFP-AtRGA overexpression line in Ler background (Achard et al., 2006), kindly provided by Prof. Nicholas Harberd, University of Oxford, were grown as described in Nibau et al. (2011).\n\nProtein sequence alignment and phylogeny\n\nPutative full-length land plant DELLA protein sequences were obtained from Phytozome (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/) (Goodstein et al., 2012) using Blastp or from NCBI (Altschul et al., 1990; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) using standard protein Blast, or from the OneKP database (One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes, 2019; https://db.cngb.org/onekp/) using Blastp. AtRGA protein sequence was used as query for all Blast searches. DELLA protein sequences of Anthoceros punctatus and Anthoceros agrestis were obtained from (Li et al., 2020) and DELLA protein sequences of Ceratopteris richardii from (Marchant et al., 2019). Sequence alignment was carried out using SeaView software (v.4.7) (Gouy et al., 2010) and presented using BoxShade (v.3.2) (https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/BOX_form.html) on default settings. Phylogenetic trees of DELLA land plant homologues were created in SeaView software on default settings, using the maximum likelihood algorithm with 100 bootstrap replicates or the BioNJ algorithm with 1000 bootstrap replicates, and displayed using iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/).\n\nPhyscomitrium patens protoplast isolation and transformation\n\nPhyscomitrium patens protoplast isolation was carried out as described in Schaefer et al. (1991) and protoplast transformation as in Moody et al. (2021).\n\nPhyscomitrium patens genomic DNA extraction\n\nGenomic DNA extraction was carried out as described in Moody et al. (2021). Further details are given in the Methods S1.\n\nPhyscomitrium patens RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and reverse transcription PCR\n\nPhyscomitrium patens RNA was isolated as described in Vesty et al. (2016). Physcomitrium patens cDNA was synthesised using the Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline) with OligodT primers as per manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described in Vesty et al. (2016).\n\nPCR and sequencing primers\n\nAll primers are listed in Table S1. PCR primers were designed using the NCBI primer designing tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/).\n\nGeneration of PpDELLA inducible overexpression constructs\n\nPpDELLAa and PpDELLAb coding sequences (excluding start codons) were PCR-amplified from P. patens genomic DNA using XhoI-PpDELLAa_pHSP-F with SalI-PpDELLAa_pHSP-R and XhoI-PpDELLAb_pHSP-F with SalI-PpDELLAb_pHSP-R, respectively. The PCR products were ligated into pCR-blunt using the Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions, and then sequenced (Eurofins, Wolverhampton, UK) using the primers M13_F, XhoI-PpDELLAa_pHSP-F, PpDELLAa_internal_F and M13_R for PpDELLAa, and M13_F, XhoI-PpDELLAb_pHSP-F, PpDELLAb_internal_F and M13_R for PpDELLAb. PpDELLAa and PpDELLAb were then digested out of pCR-blunt using XhoI and SalI and ligated into pHSP-MCS-GFP-108-35SNPT (GenBank: KP893621.1; Moody et al., 2016).\n\nGenotyping of Physcomitrium patens transformants\n\nPCR was used to screen transformants for the presence of pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP, pHSP::PpDELLAb-GFP or pHSP::GFP. For pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP and pHSP::PpDELLAb-GFP, the primers pHSP_F and mGFP_R were used. In addition, for pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP the primer mGFP_R was also used in combination with the primer XhoI-PpDELLAa_pHSP-F. For pHSP::GFP, the primers pHSP_F and 35STer_R were used. All transformants were also genotyped using primers nptII_F and 108locus5′_R to confirm integration into the inert 108 genomic locus.\n\nPlant protein expression analysis\n\nFor P. patens protein expression analysis, 7-d or 14-d-old protonemata transformed with pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP-108-35SNPT, pHSP::PpDELLAb-GFP-108-35SNPT or pHSP::GFP-108-35SNPT were incubated in liquid BCD supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM ammonium tartrate in 24-well plates for 1 h at 37°C (protein induction) or at 22 ± 1°C (control) with gentle agitation, followed by incubation at 22 ± 1°C for at least 6 h with gentle agitation. Normally, half a plate of P. patens tissue was transferred to each well, which contained 1 ml of liquid BCD supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM ammonium tartrate. For testing the effects of GA3, GA9-ME, ent-kaurenoic acid or methanol on protein stability, the chemical was added to the well following the 6-h post-heat-shock incubation period. For Arabidopsis pRGA::GFP-AtRGA, 7-d-old seedlings were incubated in 24-well plates in liquid ½ Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium (2.2 g MS basal medium (M0404; Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 l dH2O, pH 5.7) supplemented with GA3, GA9-ME or methanol. For protein extraction, P. patens or Arabidopsis tissue was collected in 50 ml Falcon tubes or 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. For live-cell imaging analysis, confocal microscopy was used.\n\nConfocal microscopy\n\nConfocal images or z-stacks of protein expression in P. patens protonemata or Arabidopsis roots were captured with the Zen 2012 software using the Zeiss LSM170 confocal microscope (20× objective). Wild-type protonemata and protonemata with uninduced GFP expression were compared with protonemata with induced PpDELLA-GFP protein expression using identical laser power, gain and pinhole settings. For Arabidopsis, Ler roots were compared to pRGA::GFP-AtRGA roots. Excitation and emission wavelengths for GFP fluorescence were 488 nm and 530 nm respectively and for chloroplast autofluorescence 634 nm and 696 nm respectively.\n\nPlant protein extraction\n\nA mortar and a pestle (pretreated with 70% ethanol) were used to grind up frozen plant tissue in liquid nitrogen. As soon as the ground tissue had reached room temperature, protein extraction buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 or HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, cOmplete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche), one per 10 ml buffer) was added to the tissue and grinding was continued until a homogenous suspension was formed. The lysate was then filtered through a single layer of miracloth (Millipore) into 50 ml falcon tubes or 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 14 000 g for 30–45 min at 4°C and the supernatant transferred into fresh tubes. For protein analysis by western blotting, the protein extract was diluted in 5× Laemmli buffer (10% (w/v) SDS, 50% (w/v) glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and boiled for 10 min at 95°C. For P. patens protein extraction destined for immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry, four plates of 17-d-old protonemata carrying either pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP or pHSP::GFP were incubated for 1 h at 37°C to induce protein expression, followed by incubation at 22 ± 1°C for 6 h. Four plates of 17-d-old protonemata carrying pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP were also continuously incubated at 22 ± 1°C without undergoing incubation at 37°C (control). Physcomitrium patens tissue was then flash frozen in 50 ml Falcon tubes in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Frozen tissue from the three treatment groups was ground in liquid nitrogen, and then mixed with 4 ml protein extraction buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% triton X-100, cOmplete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche), one per 10 ml buffer) as soon as the ground tissue had reached room temperature. Grinding was continued until a homogenous suspension was formed, which was filtered successively through a double and a single layer of miracloth (Millipore) into 50 ml Falcon tubes on ice. This was followed by two rounds of centrifugation in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes at 12 000 g for 30 min each at 4°C. Supernatants were collected into single 15 ml Falcon tubes and total protein adjusted to 4.8 mg in 3.7 ml protein extraction buffer, made up to 7.4 ml with dilution buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, cOmplete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche) - one per 10 ml buffer) and stored in −80°C until immunoprecipitation was performed.\n\nYeast protein extraction\n\nAH109 yeast was cultured overnight in liquid synthetic amino acid Drop out (DO) −leu−trp at 30°C. 1 ml yeast culture with OD600 eight was centrifuged for 4 min at 12 000 g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl Buffer A (0.1 M NaOH, 50 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 90°C for 10 min. The suspension was supplemented with 0.67 μl 3 M acetic acid, vortexed for 30 s on a Titrtek and for 1 min on a vortex, and incubated for 10 min at 90°C. This was followed by addition of 12.5 μl of Buffer B (250 mM Tris pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue), brief vortexing and centrifugation at 12 000 g for 5 min. 55 μl supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and boiled for 1 min at 98°C. Protein expression was analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.\n\nSDS-PAGE and western blotting\n\nSDS-PAGE and western blotting were performed as described in Gibbs et al. (2014). Further details are given in the Methods S1.\n\nGeneration of yeast two-hybrid constructs\n\nPpDELLAs or AtRGA cloned in pGADT7 and PpGLP1 or AtGID1c cloned in pGBKT7 (Yasumura et al., 2007) were kindly provided by Professor Nicholas Harberd, University of Oxford. PpPHY5B (Pp3c12_9240), PpPHOTA2 (Pp3c21_21410) and PpPHOTB1 (Pp3c2_10380) coding sequences (excluding the start codons) were PCR-amplified from P. patens cDNA (from gametophore tissue) using NdeI-PpPHY5B_F with NotI-PpPHY5B_R, SalI-PpPHOTA2_F (including an additional TT after the restriction site to enable in-frame cloning) with NotI- PpPHOTA2_R, and NdeI-PpPHOTB1_F with NotI-PpPHOTB1_R, respectively. The PCR products were ligated into pCR-blunt using the Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer's instructions, and then sequenced (Eurofins, Wolverhampton, UK) using the primers M13_F and M13_R. PpPHY5B, PpPHOTA2 and PpPHOTB1 cDNA (excluding the start codons) was PCR-amplified using pCR-blunt as template and NdeI-PpPHY5B_F with NotI-PpPHY5B_R, SalI-PpPHOTA2_F with NotI-PpPHOTA2_R, and NdeI-PpPHOTB1_F with NotI-PpPHOTB1_R, respectively. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and NotI for PpPHY5B and PpPHOTB1 or SalI and NotI for PpPHOTA2, and ligated into pGBKT7 (Clontech, Takara Bio, San Jose, CA, USA), where they were sequenced (Eurofins, Wolverhampton, UK). For PpPHY5B, the following sequencing primers were used: T7_F, NdeI-PpPHY5B_F, PpPHY5B-Seq_F, PpPHY5B-Seq2_F, PpPHY5B-Seq3_F. For PpPHOTA2, the following sequencing primers were used: T7_F, M13_R, SalI-PpPHOTA2_F, PpPHOTA2-Seq_F, PpPHOTA2-Seq2_F, PpPHOTA2-Seq3_F. For PpPHOTB1, the following sequencing primers were used: T7_F, M13_R, NdeI-PpPHOTB1_F, PpPHOTB1-Seq_F, PpPHOTB1-Seq2_F and PpPHOTB1-Seq3_F.\n\nYeast two-hybrid assays\n\nTransformation of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen (AH109) with the appropriate plasmids was carried out as described in Gibbs et al. (2014). Further details are given in the Methods S1.\n\nCo-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) in a cell-free system\n\nMYC-tagged AtGID1c or PpGLP1 expressed from pGBKT7 and HA-tagged AtRGA or PpDELLAa or PpDELLAb expressed from pGADT7 (Yasumura et al., 2007) were translated in vitro using the TNT® T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Further details are given in Methods S1.\n\nPhyscomitrium patens spore culture and germination assays\n\nSpores were cultured and germination assays were performed as described in Vesty et al. (2016).\n\nPhyscomitrium patens vegetative tissue growth assays under abiotic stress conditions\n\nPhyscomitrium patens vegetative growth under salt and oxidative stress was assayed by measuring plant area after culture plates were photographed using a Nikon D40 SLR camera. Individual plants of similar size were transferred onto BCDATG agar (4–5 per plate) supplemented with NaCl or methyl viologen (856 177; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 22 ± 1°C with a 16 h : 8 h, light : dark cycle. Plant area measured at the start of the assay was subtracted from that measured at the end of the assay. For measurements, the polygon function in Fiji software was used. For desiccation stress, P. patens vegetative growth was assayed by transferring cellophanes carrying 7-d-old protonemata growing on BCD agar supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM ammonium tartrate (BCDAT) onto fresh BCDAT agar plates supplemented with ABA or methanol and incubating them overnight at 22 ± 1°C with a 16 h : 8 h, light : dark cycle. Following this, cellophanes were transferred into empty Petri dishes and incubated under the same conditions for 7 d, after which time they were transferred onto fresh BCDAT agar plates for another 7 d to allow tissue recovery. The effect of desiccation stress was assayed qualitatively by observing plant physical appearance at the end of the assay.\n\nSporophyte development assays\n\nFor sporophyte development assays, P. patens protonemata were homogenised and cultured on BCDAT agar supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM ammonium tartrate for 7–14 d. Individual moss plants of similar size were then transferred aseptically onto cellophane-overlaid BCDATG agar plates. Plates were incubated at 22 ± 1°C with a 16 h : 8 h light : dark cycle for 4 wk, and plants transferred aseptically inside sterile Magenta™ vessels (CO542; Merck) containing BCD agar supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 (one plant per vessel). Plants were incubated at 15°C with an 8 h : 16 h, light : dark cycle for 7 wk to induce reproductive development. Photographs were taken using a Nikon D40 SLR camera and sporophyte density was quantified by counting the number of sporophytes per plant tissue area, estimated using the polygon function in Fiji software.\n\nGametangia, sporophyte and crossing analyses\n\nFor gametangia analyses, apices of adult gametophores (21 d after short day transfer, timepoint of mature antheridia and archegonia) were uncovered and transferred on an objective slide with sterile tap water. Sporophytes were counted and analysed 2–3 wk after watering for crossed sporophytes using a Leica MZ10F binocular to detect mCherry fluorescence in Re-mCherry crossed sporophytes. Samples were covered with coverslips and subsequently analysed with a Leica DM6000 microscope equipped with a DFC295 camera (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) using the Leica Application Suite 4.4 with the Multi-Stack Module. For sporophyte and crossing statistical analyses Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) was used to determine mean and standard error as well as to visualize data. To determine sporophytes per gametophore and the number of crossed sporophytes per total sporophytes, at least 100 gametophores per strain were analysed. To arrange and modify brightness and contrast of microscopic images, Microsoft Power Point was used (Microsoft).\n\nImmunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry\n\nImmunoprecipitation was carried out using the GFP-trap® magnetic agarose kit (Chromotek, Planegg, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions. Further details are given in Methods S1. Following SDS-PAGE, gels were stained using the ProteoSilver™ silver staining kit (Sigma-Aldrich) as per manufacturer's instructions. Following staining, each run sample was split into two gel pieces. A strong band present in the middle of all samples was used as a reference for excising. Gel pieces excised were submitted for trypsin digest and LC/MS analysis at the School of Biosciences Proteomics Facility, Birmingham. Orbitrap Elite and Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometers were used. Peptides were matched against Uniprot database and proteins were identified with cut-off protein false discovery rate (FDR) set to 1%.\n\nPhyscomitrium patens light assays\n\nFor spore or vegetative tissue growth assays under different light wavelengths, P. patens was incubated on BCDATG agar (for vegetative tissue) or BCD agar supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM ammonium tartrate (for spores) plates inside cardboard boxes at 22 ± 1°C under continuous illumination from the top by either white LED lights, filtered via neutral density or colour filters, or by far-red LED lights (LumitronixR, Hechingen, Germany). White light (63 μmol m−2 s−1) was filtered using overlaid single layers of neutral density filters no. 209 and no. 298 (LEE filters, Andover, UK), red light (640–695 nM, 26μmol m−2 s−1) was filtered using two layers of Deep golden amber filter no. 135 (LEE filters) and blue light (445–490 nM, 16 μmol m−2 s−1) using three layers of Moonlight blue filter no. 183 (LEE filters). Far-red light (730 nM) was adjusted to 16 μmol m−2 s−1. The effect of light wavelength on vegetative tissue growth was assayed qualitatively by observing physical appearance, for example, gametophore development or wilting after culture plates were photographed using a Nikon D40 SLR camera.\n\nRNA preparation and RNAseq analysis\n\nThe samples consisted of P. patens gametophores grown in BCDAT for 3 wk. Total RNA was extracted from triplicate samples with the NucleoSpin™ RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany), and the RNA concentration and integrity (RIN) were measured in an RNA nanochip (Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies 2100, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The preparation of libraries and subsequent sequencing in an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform was carried out at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) yielding at least 20 M 100-bp paired-end reads per sample. The read qualities were explored using FastQC v.0.11.9. The adaptors were removed from the reads processing the paired-end files together using Bbduk v.38.42 with the default adapters file and the following parameters: ‘ktrim=r k=23 mink=11 hdist=1’. Next, the reads were quality filtered using Trimmomatic v.0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) with the following parameters: ‘-phred33 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:35’ and the quality of the filtered files was assessed with FastQC.\n\nFor the differential expression analysis, the P. patens annotation v.3.3 was downloaded from Phytozome (Goodstein et al., 2012). An index file was created using the index command from Salmon v.1.1.0 (Patro et al., 2017). The number of reads per transcript was determined with salmon quant using the –validateMappings parameter and the filtered reads file. Finally, the differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014).\n\nGO enrichment analysis was carried out with the corresponding tool in PlantRegMap (Tian et al., 2020) and the categories were organized and represented with ReviGO (Supek et al., 2011). TF enrichment analysis was performed using the TF enrichment tool available at PlantRegMap (Tian et al., 2020) A TF is considered enriched if the number of possible targets for it on the input list of genes is higher than expected; and a gene is considered a target if there is experimental evidence or it has cis regulatory elements or binding motifs for the TF. Log fold-change for DEGs and TF enrichment were visualised using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).\n\nResults\n\nDELLA proteins in Physcomitrium patens are part of monophyletic bryophyte and moss groups but are divergent from other plant DELLAs\n\nWe placed bryophyte DELLAs in a phylogeny with a selection of full-length bryophyte, lycophyte, fern, gymnosperm and flowering plant DELLA protein sequences (Figs 1a, S1). Bryophyte DELLAs form a monophyletic group within which resides a moss DELLA clade. Hornwort DELLAs are basal within the bryophyte clade in this analysis. The two Physcomitrium DELLAs appear to be the result of a relatively recent genome duplication (Fig. 1a). Alignment of both the N-terminal DELLA-LEQLE domain and the VHYNP domain that are conserved in flowering plants (Yasumura et al., 2007) demonstrates that all selected mosses show considerable divergence in the DELLA and VHYNP domains compared to other bryophytes and vascular plants, while Sphagnum fallax and Marchantia show the most divergence in the LEQLE region (Fig. 1b). By contrast, the GRAS domain of moss DELLA proteins (including the LHR1 domain; Fig. 1c) does not appear to be more divergent than other bryophyte- or vascular plant DELLAs (Figs 1c, S1). These data suggest that moss DELLAs may have some conserved roles (involving the GRAS domain) and some divergent functions (involving the N-terminal DELLA-LEQLE-VHYNP domains).\n\nPpDELLAs are not degraded in response to diterpenes\n\nGiven the divergent N-terminal sequences of PpDELLA proteins, we explored the functions of moss N-terminal DELLA domains further by analysing the stability of PpDELLA proteins compared to flowering plant DELLAs. We generated transgenic Physcomitrium lines expressing either PpDELLAa or PpDELLAb as C-terminal fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of an inducible heat shock promoter (Saidi et al., 2005), named pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP and pHSP::PpDELLAb-GFP, in addition to control lines expressing pHSP::GFP (Figs S2, S3). Upon heat shock induction of PpDELLAa-GFP and PpDELLAb-GFP proteins both localise to the nucleus in Physcomitrium protonemal cells, with PpDELLAb being expressed more strongly and PpDELLAa showing additional punctate cytosolic localisation (Fig. 2a). Neither PpDELLAa-GFP nor PpDELLAb-GFP appear to be degraded upon treatment with 10 μM GA9-methyl ester (a diterpene which mimics the function of moss bioactive diterpenes; Hayashi et al., 2010) or 10 μM GA3, whilst specific GA3-dependent degradation of an Arabidopsis GFP-AtRGA fusion protein expressed from the RGA promoter (Achard et al., 2006) in Arabidopsis roots is observed (Fig. 2a,b). Moreover, no differences in PpDELLAa-GFP or PpDELLAb-GFP stability are seen upon treatment with 10 μM ent-kaurene. This suggests that PpDELLA protein levels are not affected by changes in diterpene levels caused by exogeneous application of diterpenes.\n\nPpDELLAs do not interact with GID1 receptor homologues from Arabidopsis or Physcomitrium in the presence of bryophyte-active diterpenes\n\nAs PpDELLA protein stability is not affected by diterpenes and previous studies demonstrated that PpDELLAs could not interact with GID1 homologues from Physcomitrium or Arabidopsis in the presence of gibberellins (Hirano et al., 2007; Yasumura et al., 2007), an obvious hypothesis is that no link exists between DELLA protein function and gibberellin-like signalling in mosses. To build on previous studies, we tested the possibility of an interaction between Arabidopsis and moss DELLA-receptor pairs both within- and between species (both PpDELLAs with the representative putative receptor PpGLP1 (as in Yasumura et al., 2007), both PpDELLAs with AtGID1c, AtRGA with PpGLP1 and AtRGA with AtGID1c) in the presence of GA3, GA9 methyl ester and ent-kaurenoic acid (Fig. 2). The only interaction detected both via yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 3a) and via pull-down assays in a cell-free system (Fig. 3b,c) was the known interaction between AtRGA and AtGID1c in the presence of GA3. This supports the hypothesis that DELLAs and GID1-like proteins do not interact in moss and that there is no link between diterpene function and DELLA protein function in moss.\n\nPpDELLAs restrain spore germination, while diterpenes promote spore germination in a PpDELLA-independent manner\n\nBecause of the function of diterpenes in promoting Physcomitrium spore germination and the existence of some parallels between seed- and spore germination (Vesty et al., 2016), and the fact that DELLAs regulate seed germination (Tyler et al., 2004), we investigated whether PpDELLAs were involved in spore germination. We analysed PpDELLAa and PpDELLAb expression by RT-PCR during the spore germination process (dry spores, imbibed spores and germinating spores) compared to PpDELLA expression in protonemal tissue and leafy gametophores (Fig. S4a). PpDELLAa is most strongly expressed in dry spores, with expression reducing considerably after spore imbibition and absent from germinating spores (Fig. S4a). PpDELLAa expression is present in older protonemal tissue and then increases in leafy tissue but not to such a high level as in dry spores (Fig. S4a). PpDELLAb expression is lower than PpDELLAa in the tissues tested by RT-PCR, corroborated by RNAseq data (Fig. S4a–c). The expression pattern of PpDELLAa implies function(s) for PpDELLAs during spore germination. We found that Ppdellaa, Ppdellab and Ppdellaab mutant spores all germinate faster than wild type spores and that the increased germination rate is similar across all three mutant genotypes (Fig. 4a–c). This demonstrates that PpDELLAa and PpDELLAb have non-redundant functions restraining spore germination in Physcomitrium.\n\nThe absence of a change in DELLA stability in response to diterpenes (Fig. S3) and the lack of interaction between PpDELLAs and PpGLP1 (Fig. 3) strongly suggests that diterpenes and PpDELLAs regulate spore germination via independent pathways. To test this suggestion, Ppdella mutant spores were germinated in the presence of GA9-methyl ester (Fig. 4a,b). GA9 methyl ester was able to increase spore germination rate significantly in Ppdellaa and Ppdellab mutants as in wild-type spores (Fig. 4d,e), demonstrating that effects of GA9-methyl ester on spore germination are not dependent on the presence of PpDELLAs. Futhermore, the Ppdellaab double mutant is similarly sensitive to spore germination inhibition by ABA as the wild-type, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of ABA on Physcomitrium spore germination is also independent of PpDELLAs (Fig. 4f).\n\nLoss of PpDELLA function does not affect responses to oxidative stress and ABA\n\nTo examine whether PpDELLA proteins have vegetative roles similar to the functions of Marchantia MpDELLA and Arabidopsis AtDELLAs, we analysed the effects of oxidative stress and the ‘stress hormone’ ABA on Physcomitrium vegetative tissue (Fig. S5). No differences in response to the oxidative stress-inducing methyl viologen were seen between wild-type and Ppdellaab vegetative growth (Fig. S5a). Both wild type and Ppdellaab vegetative tissue is similarly desiccation-sensitive, and this sensitivity can be rescued in each genotype by pretreatment with 10 μM ABA (Fig. S5b). This suggests that the vegetative roles of DELLA proteins seen in Marchantia and flowering plants are not conserved in the moss Physcomitrium.\n\nPpDELLA proteins promote reproductive development\n\nWe observed that the Ppdellaab mutant consistently develops fewer sporophytes than wild type plants. Frequent monitoring of developmental processes after watering showed that Ppdellaab kept on developing reproductive organs, which usually happens when no fertilisation takes place (Meyberg et al., 2020) but was largely unable to develop sporophytes (Fig. 5a–c). PpDELLAa is most highly expressed in the S1 and S2 stage developing sporophyte (Fig. S4b,c) whilst PpDELLAb is most strongly expressed in the S2 and S3 stage developing sporophyte (Fig. S4b,c), suggesting role(s) for PpDELLAs in sporophyte development.\n\nTo examine the cause of this sporophyte-formation defect, we examined the ability of the Ppdellaab mutant to develop both male (antheridia) and female (archegonia) reproductive organs. The Ppdellaab mutant develops morphologically normal antheridia and archegonia similarly to wild type plants (Fig. S6). However, crossing analysis showed that the Ppdellaab mutant likely has a male fertility defect, as Ppdellaab mutants can develop sporophytes when crossed with the male-fertile Physcomitrium Reute (Re)-mCherry marker strain (Perroud et al., 2019; Fig. S7a). Interestingly, the stomata in crossed plants show aberrant distribution (Fig. S7a). In addition, the male infertile strain Ppccdc39 (Hiss et al., 2017; Meyberg et al., 2020) could not be fertilized by Ppdellaab, supporting the hypothesis that Ppdellaab has a fertility defect (Fig. S7b). This ties in with detection of PpDELLA expression in antheridia (Fig. S4d). Thus, a positive role for DELLA proteins in male reproductive development is present in the moss Physcomitrium, as in flowering plants.\n\nPpDELLAs interact with Physcomitrium hybrid light receptors\n\nGiven that the function of PpDELLAs in spore germination and reproductive development cannot be linked to regulation by diterpene/gibberellin signalling, we sought to identify protein interaction partners of PpDELLAs that could represent alternative regulators of their activity. We carried out immunoprecipitation (IP) of PpDELLAa-GFP protein from induced pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP moss tissue using an anti-GFP antibody, followed by mass spectrometry (MS). The proteins obtained by IP-MS from induced pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP were compared to those obtained from uninduced pHSP::PpDELLAa-GFP tissue and induced pHSP::GFP tissue, to define proteins pulled down specifically in the presence of PpDELLAa (Fig. 6a; Table S2). From the 408 proteins specifically immunoprecipitated in the presence of PpDELLAa, eight proteins came under the Gene Ontology (GO) ‘Biological Function’ category of ‘chromophore-protein linkage’ (GO:0018298) (Fig. 6b). Of these eight proteins, three were putative photoreceptors, namely PHOTOTROPIN A2 (PpPHOTA2), PHOTOTROPIN B1 (PpPHOTB1) and PHYTOCHROME 5B (PpPHY5B).\n\nTo confirm the association between PpDELLAs and PpPHOTA2, PpPHOTB1 and PpPHY5B, their interactions were tested in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 6c). PpPHY5B was able to interact with both PpDELLAa and PpDELLAb in yeast, while PpPHOTA2 interacted with PpDELLAb only (Fig. 6c), perhaps reflecting a technical issue with the yeast system compared to the analysis in planta. No interaction was detected between PpPHOTB1 and PpDELLAs in the yeast system, but this is likely due to its lack of detectable expression in yeast compared to PpPHY5B and PpPHOTA2 (Fig. 6d). The interactions between PpDELLAb and PpPHY5B/PpPHOTA2 were not changed in the presence of red, far-red or blue light (Fig. S8a). This suggests that PpDELLAs can interact with certain moss photoreceptor proteins independently of a particular wavelength of light.\n\nSince flowering plant phytochromes function as temperature sensors as well as red/far-red light receptors (Jung et al., 2016; Legris et al., 2016) and since moss spore germination is reversibly inhibited by a far-red light pulse or a temperature of 35°C (Vesty et al., 2016), we tested the sensitivity of Ppdellaab mutant spores to transient 35°C exposure. Ppdellaab mutant spore germination was reversibly inhibited by incubation at 35°C similarly to wild type (Fig. S8b). To investigate if PpDELLAs were involved in photoreceptor-mediated regulation of development, we examined the responses of Ppdellaab mutant spores to red and blue light. Both wild-type and Ppdellaab spores germinated faster under red light than white light and germination of both genotypes was inhibited under blue light (Fig. S9a). Similarly, no differences in the vegetative growth of wild-type and Ppdellaab mutant plants were observed under red, far-red or blue light (Fig. S9b). Taken together, these data suggest that PpDELLA-photoreceptor interactions are not required for spore germination or vegetative growth and that PpDELLAs do not mediate photoreceptor action via physical interaction or any other mechanism.\n\nPpDELLAs likely function as transcriptional regulators of metabolism\n\nTo discover putative transcriptional targets of PpDELLA proteins, we compared the gametophore transcriptomes of wild-type and Ppdellaab mutant plants. 782 genes were downregulated in the Ppdellaab mutant compared to wild type (Fig. 7a; Table S3). 907 genes were upregulated in the Ppdellaab mutant (Fig. 7b; Table S4). When examined for GO term enrichment of biological processes, genes downregulated in the Ppdellaab mutant (therefore likely to be PpDELLA-induced, either directly or indirectly) were largely chloroplast- or photosynthesis-related (Fig. 7c) with some primary metabolic functions (terpenoid/isoprenoid (including carotenoid- and pigment-) biosynthesis and metabolism) and some functions in responses to light and hormones (Fig. 7d).\n\nGenes upregulated in the Ppdellaab mutant, therefore likely to be directly or indirectly DELLA-repressed, fell largely into the GO biological process category of primary metabolism in addition to secondary metabolism and stress response (Fig. 7c). Metabolic genes included those involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and cell wall metabolism (Fig. 7e).\n\nTo understand more about how PpDELLAs might carry out their metabolic functions, analysis was carried out using PlantRegMap to identify transcription factor binding sites enriched in the promoters of Ppdellaab differentially expressed genes (PpDELLA target genes). We would predict that TFs that bind to the promoters of PpDELLA target genes are possible PpDELLA protein-interacting transcription factors (DELLA-TFs). Following the assumption that cis elements for putative DELLA-TFs would be enriched in the promoters of PpDELLA target genes, 51 putative transcription factors were identified (Fig. 8a,b; Table S5). Amongst the 21 transcription factors predicted to bind to the promoters of genes downregulated in Ppdellaab (therefore induced by PpDELLA activity), binding sites for certain C2H2, DOF, LBD, bZIP, ERF, C3H, bHLH, SBP, WRKY, G2-like and Trihelix transcription factors were enriched (Fig. 8a). Amongst the 41 transcription factors predicted to bind to the promoters of Ppdellaab-upregulated genes (genes repressed by PpDELLA activity), binding sites for specific transcription factors from the LBD, ERF, bZIP, WRKY, bHLH, C2H2, CAMTA, MYB, TCP, NAC, HSF, AP2 and BES1 families were enriched (Fig. 8b). There are 11 DELLA-TFs that are predicted to bind to both PpDELLA-induced and DELLA-repressed gene promoters (Table S5). TFs belonging to each of these families have been previously shown to act as DELLA-interacting proteins in Arabidopsis (Marin-de la Rosa et al., 2014; Lantzouni et al., 2020). Moreover, one of the transcription factor-encoding genes identified as a putative PpDELLAa-interactor using PlantRegMap is the MYB domain transcription factor Pp3c3_17580V3.1. Pp3c3_17580V3.1 was also detected as a PpDELLAa-interacting protein in the IP-MS experiment (Table S2). These data suggest that as in flowering plants (Hernandez-Garcia et al., 2019, 2021b; Phokas & Coates, 2021), PpDELLAs act as ‘hubs’ for interaction with transcription factors.\n\nThere is no overlap between the putative PpDELLA-interacting transcription factor genes and the 88 DEGs in moss tissue treated with GA9-methyl ester (Perroud et al., 2019) (Fig. 7c). In total, 29 out of the 88 GA9-methyl ester DEGs (33%) are present amongst the 1689 Ppdellaab DEGs (Fig. 7c). This supports the idea that PpDELLA and diterpenes act via independent transcriptional mechanisms in Physcomitrium although they impinge on some of the same developmental processes."
