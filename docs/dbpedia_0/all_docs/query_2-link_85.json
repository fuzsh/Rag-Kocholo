We are parents first and foremost, to one incredibly wonderful hamster and we ask for his and out space and privacy to be respected at this difficult time. We haven't really conducted our relationship that privately , and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner. Love, Megan & Wes'\n\nShe later added: 'In all seriousness, I am so grateful and so blessed to have found Wes, I will always love and adore him and I am so lucky to call him my best friend, it has been an incredibly hard decision to make for both of us but we are both looking forward to moving on together as friends and supporting each other in everything we do.

I get home, I‚Äôve still got the dishes to do.
