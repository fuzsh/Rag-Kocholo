        "text": "I was not entirely looking forward to meeting Debbie Harry. The first time we crossed paths was all of 25 years ago, when I waited patiently outside the stage door of the Hammersmith Odeon in leather jacket and jeans and newly shorn hair, to pay homage to her band, Blondie, the consummate punk-pop outfit of the time. Back then, she looked like nothing on earth: porcelain skin, red lips, and to-die-for cheekbones framed by that signature shock of blond hair. Though, at 32, she was inordinately old by punk standards, she seemed like a Hollywood starlet from another era; like the pop icon she would soon become.\n\nI stared in wide-eyed wonder as she signed autographs, posed for photos, and dropped one-liners in a flat New York drawl that, to me, was the epitome of cool. Then she disappeared into the tour bus, accompanied by her partner, Chris Stein, who, along with the other three members of Blondie, had lingered around in her shadow, feigning nonchalance, fated for ever to be the Di Maggio to her Monroe.\n\nThat, though, was a quarter-century ago; an eternity in pop terms. As soon as I agreed to interview her, a nagging voice in my head kept telling me that those rose-tinted memories would be better left intact. It is echoing loudly as I sit in the Empire Diner in midtown Manhattan on a sunny Sunday morning, waiting for Deborah Harry, as she now likes to be known, to show up. Nervously, I re-read a review of one of her recent shows as lead singer of the quirky-going-on-avant-garde Jazz Passengers, a downtown combo whose sense of adventure, at least, is in keeping with the spirit of punk, even if their musicianship is light years away from the three-chords-and-an-attitude swagger that underpinned Blondie.\n\nI try to imagine Debbie Harry, the ultra-cool, almost casual pop singer, transformed into Deborah Harry, a mature, measured jazz diva. It is well nigh impossible.\n\nThen, suddenly, I look out of the window and there she is, standing right out front on the corner where 22nd Street traverses 5th Avenue. For a moment, the years fall away. In shades, dark coat, pastel dress and white sneakers, she is instantly recognisable, iconic even, her blond hair longer now, less coiffured, more straggly, but still a signature of sorts. Other heads turn. People nudge each other. In seconds, there is a major diva alert, New York style, everyone peering out the window while trying to appear as if they are doing anything but.\n\nOnce inside, she orders a BLT and a soda, and when she starts to talk her every pause is accompanied by a strange low-level whimper. She fiddles constantly with her handbag, patting it from time to time and making what appear to be soothing noises.\n\nNot sure what to make of this, I spend the first moments of our interview wondering whether Harry has developed a strange nervous disposition. She confides that her dog 'is having a trauma'. I nod, trying to appear sympathetic but sensing that we are moving full-speed ahead towards Planet Wacko. The whimpering continues, louder now. It takes another moment to dawn on me that the mutt is in the bag.\n\nWhen the waitress departs, Harry opens the zip an inch or so more. A pug nose peeps out. 'She's going through a bad time,' Harry elaborates, patting the severely put-out pooch. 'I got a new puppy last week and things haven't been the same.' I nod some more. The waitress returns with the drinks, the zip closes on the dog and the whimpering starts up again. This is not going to be a regular interview.\n\nUp close and personal, Deborah Harry is smaller than I remembered. Now approaching her fifty-eighth birthday, her face is lined and pale, and her body, once boyish, is now womanly. She still exudes a star quality, and when she takes off her shades her eyes are as clear and as vibrant as ever. Her mind, though, is not on the job at hand. How, I begin, does she spend her time these days?\n\n'Oh, y'know, I work,' she replies, gazing out of the window. 'As far as I know, I'm still a singer.'\n\nDoes she, I persist, consider herself a jazz singer rather than a pop singer these days? A shrug. 'I just try to sing as good as I can, y'know. A song is a song when you get down to it.' 'Not,' I reply, maybe a little too pointedly, 'when it's Ella Fitzgerald singing it.'\n\nThere's a pause.\n\nSomewhere a dog whimpers, or maybe it's me.\n\n'Well, y'know, I do what I do. I guess they must like it 'cos they keep asking me back.'\n\nThis, I think, could be going a whole lot better. Our order arrives and not a moment too soon. She seems to soften a bit. 'I guess I found the performing part tough at the start. In rock'n'roll, someone is always playing the melody line, but with this stuff, that often isn't the case. Often, I'd be out there alone.' She feigns a look of mock panic. 'It was a new and a scary world.'\n\n'Debbie fitted right in,' Roy Nathanson, the effusive leader of the Jazz Passengers, tells me later. 'Her pitch was pretty impressive for someone who didn't earn their chops singing jazz. But I guess it's kind of difficult for her because she really has two lives. One is Blondie and success and stardom, and the other is this - eccentric jazz and very little money and carrying your own bags on the train to another city. I got to hand it to her, she's been amazing.'\n\nIn many ways, though, Deborah Harry's collaboration with the Jazz Passengers is not so surprising. Way before punk, in the pre-swinging mid-Sixties, she hung out with the boho set in Greenwich Village, joining various avant-garde groups, including the intriguingly named First National Unaphrenic Church and Bank. She was, she says, 'always drawn to the exotic'.\n\nHer childhood seems to have been relatively uneventful, although she was adopted, born in Florida, and brought up in New Jersey by a salesman, Richard Harry, and his wife. Perhaps this accounts for her distinct sense of otherness, that slight blankness - she was Warhol's favourite pop star - that, even at the height of her popularity, made her intriguingly difficult to read.\n\nAs a child, she daydreamed that Marilyn Monroe was her real mother. She began dyeing her hair at 12, experimenting with various shades of violet before settling on the blond that became her trademark. She once told a reporter she was 'making a statement'. Elsewhere she said: 'I was extraordinary looking... but a lot of people thought I was in a different world than I was. My inside world was a lot different from my outside world.' It is difficult to know whether that is still the case.\n\nHer ambition was evident from the start. Asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, she answered, 'to be famous, what else?' As an adventurous teenager in New Jersey in the Fifties, she listened to the liberating rhythm and blues of Fats Domino, Bo Diddley and the rest, but her first real awakening came with the Beats, and with the birth of modern jazz. 'I had a boyfriend who was hip. We'd go to the Village to see bands. Back then, there was that sense that everything was up for grabs. Kind of like punk later on. Those moments are important. They sweep away a lot of old-fashioned stuff and bring in a whole new attitude.\n\n'Attitude,' she adds, biting into her BLT, 'is important.'\n\nDuring punk, when attitude was all, Debbie Harry evinced a kind of timeless cosmopolitan cool that was both sassy and sardonic, slightly detached and off-hand in that peculiarly East Coast way. She had already been around a bit, having worked briefly as a Playboy bunny, then a waitress at CBGB's, the down-at-heel home of New York glam rock and, later, punk.\n\nHer previous group was The Stilettos, an ironically exaggerated version of classic Sixties all-girl groups like the Ronettes or the Shangri-las. Blondie, formed by Harry and her long-term partner, Stein, took elements of that tradition and welded them to a melodic power-pop that effortlessly transcended the sum of its influences. Stein was the group's guitarist and residing genius, co-composer and arranger of a string of hits that began with 'Denis' and 'I'm Always Touched By Your Presence Dear' in 1978, and continued through the Seventies and into the early Eighties.\n\nThe group had an uncanny knack of absorbing contemporary trends, including futuristic Euro-disco on the anthemic 'Heart of Glass', and early hip-hop on 'Rapture'. One of their biggest hits was a jaunty pop version of the old reggae classic 'The Tide Is High'. Everything they touched, though, became a Blondie song. 'It was never that thought-out,' she says now. 'We more or less just did what we felt, and stuck to what we were good at. It was kind of effortless.'\n\nDoes she miss that era?\n\n'I guess so,' she mumbles, 'but I don't stay awake at night thinking about it.'\n\nHer gaze drifts off out of the window again. I poke hopelessly at my scrambled eggs. 'I miss a lot of the people, though,' she says eventually, wistfully. 'So many of them are gone.' One of her best friends back then was Nancy Spungen, she says, an inveterate groupie who was later killed by her lover, the late Sid Vicious. We talk briefly, too, about Joey Ramone, another friend, who died from cancer last year, and whose gangly frame and minimal vocal style epitomised one strand of New York street punk.\n\n'You could drift into CBGBs and see Television one night and the Ramones the next, then Patti [Smith] reading her poetry. People forget that the scene was so unique and varied that everybody was doing their own thing, taking risks, making leaps. I guess that's what I really miss.'\n\nHaving found global fame as a pop star and sex symbol, Harry then realised her original ambition to become a film star, albeit fleetingly. She appeared in David Cronenberg's chilling cyber-porn classic, Videodrome, and alongside Ricki Lake in John Waters's Hairspray. Between 1983 and 1985 her career was put on hold as she disappeared from view altogether. The news leaked out that Stein was suffering from a rare and often fatal genetic skin disease, pemphigus, which attacks the immune system. She nursed him through the illness. He survived but soon afterwards their relationship faltered and the longest-running couple in pop split up.\n\nThe effect was traumatic. Having grown tired of the way that her own personality and her Blondie persona had become blurred by the media, she returned briefly as a brunette. Her music seemed tougher and edgier but somehow forced. She looked drawn and uninterested. Unsurprisingly, her record company suffered a loss of nerve. 'They wanted Debbie Harry,' she once quipped, 'Not Dirty Harry.'\n\nSome kind of depression ensued, and in the mid-Eighties, which she now calls 'the ice-cream years', she put on far too much weight and seemed to have temporarily given up on the notion of pop stardom. The tabloids had a field day with her weight gain, her reclusiveness and the whole sex-symbol-gone-to-seed schtick.\n\nI am building up the courage to approach all this when Harry, perhaps sensing that, having done punk, this is the point in every interview when her private life is broached, decides we should only talk about the present.\n\n'That Blondie stuff's been told a million times,' she drawls, pushing the remains of her BLT aside. 'It's history. What I'm doing now is hot. We're going to be playing with the BBC orchestra in London. I mean, this is serious.'\n\nWe duly talk about her re-emergence as a jazz singer, her reworkings of standards and the odd Blondie song with the Jazz Passengers, and about her nervousness at fronting a 60-piece orchestra. For the first time this morning she seems happy, focused, at home with the idea of Deborah Harry, working musician, rather than Debbie Harry, erstwhile pop icon. And, who can blame her for that?\n\nAfter a few minutes, though, she is making her excuses and leaving, another journalist hung up on the past dispensed with. I am left with a feeling of vague disquiet. Weirdly, she seems even more elusive now than she was before I met her.\n\nOn the street, she stops to let her newly released dog linger at a lamp-post. People come up to her and chat. I bend to pat the dog, and it snaps at my hand. She apologises but, unless I'm mistaken, her face, for the first time today, is stifling a smile.\n\nDeborah Harry and the Jazz Passengers will appear at London's Barbican next Sunday (19 May)"
