        "text": "Gemma Hayes is an alternative rock, folk, and indie rock singer from Ireland. She has a lovely sweet voice that can reach high notes perfectly. She plays her own guitar during her shows instead of depending on a band at all times.\n\nHer song of \"Shock to the System,\" will always have to be my favorite of hers. Listen to a few of her songs and you will instantly fall in love with the melodies she composes for all to enjoy. She is a great performer and got that way without taking the low road of becoming a Hollywood puppet like most entertainers.\n\nTake my advice here, when her tour is set to come to your town or to a town near you then please grab those tickets as soon as you can! You definitely won't regret it! The crowd is usually full of young adults and teens but her music is loved by all. Everybody sways in harmony together emanating good vibes to each other.\n\nGemma Hayes is such a cool down to earth woman who talks to her fans during the show. She's always laughing and smiling and she will make you do the same!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nWas a wonderful, magical night! Every song was played beautifully, the whole band were amazing. Gemma's voice is most definitely the best voice I've ever heard live! In my top 5 gigs of all time (I've been to a lot;))\n\nMy top three songs of the night were \"Laughter\", \"To Be Your Honey\", and \"Making My Way Back\".\n\nI've been a fan for many years but this was the 1st time catching this amazing lady live- Can't wait for the next one :)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
