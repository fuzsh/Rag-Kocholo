        "text": "Listen and subscribe to the official A State Of Trance Top 1000 playlist on Spotify\n\nHere are the results of the all-time A State Of Trance Top 1000. The Top 1000 list took center stage during a seven-day-long A State Of Trance Top 1000 stream, running down to the milestone episode of Armin van Buuren’s weekly radio show when the broadcast of episode 999 ended on January 14 at 10 p.m. (CET).\n\nPresented by Armin van Buuren, co-host Ruben de Ronde and monthly show resident Ferry Corsten, the A State of Trance Top 1000 stream featured everything from ASOT year mixes, exclusive interviews and fan videos to the official countdown of the A State Of Trance Top 1000. The list is composed of the most popular ASOT-played records of all time, based on the votes of the show’s fan base.\n\nWhen the seven-day livestream ended on Thursday, January 21, our hosts then dived head first into the 1000th episode of A State Of Trance, live from the ASOT radio studio in Amsterdam. The broadcast started three hours earlier than normal – at 5 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. (CET) – and ran through the final top 50 tracks of the A State Of Trance Top 1000, finishing with the top ASOT play of all time as voted for by the fans.
