The 13-track opus, having previously only been available on CD and digital formats and never on vinyl will be a must-have collectible for anyone who considers themselves a fan of rock (pun intended!)\n\nTheir first studio venture since 1986Âs Dangerous Game. Alongside the unique vocal prowess and range of star frontman and founding member Graham Bonnet, Born Innocent also features fellow founding members Jimmy Waldo and Gary Shea. And from the classic album art, featuring the mighty rock itself, Born Innocent is a journey into the sort of heavy, melodic and supremely articulated hard rock that is a cornerstone of the likes of Rainbow and the Michael Schenker Group, territory Alcatrazz successfully strode in the Â80s before going on hiatus.\n\nBorn Innocent was produced by Jimmy Waldo with Giles Lavery and mixed and mastered by Andy Haller and features many former stars from Graham's long career. Guest appearances include Chris Impellitteri, who wrote the music and played all guitars on the arpeggio-powered ÂBorn InnocentÂ, with BonnetÂs vocals soaring to old-school heights, as did Bob Kulick for the majestic ÂI Am The KingÂ.

The original line-up of Chip Robinson (lead vocal, guitar, electric 12-string guitar), Steve Howell (harmony vocal, lead guitar), Danny Kurtz (bass), Jeff ÂJDÂ Dennis (drums), came back together in 2012 with new bandmate Greg Rice (keyboards). With engineer John Plymale of Overdub Lane at the board, they wasted no time in recording the RALEIGHWOOD (EP), featuring their hardcore honky-tonk and unmistakable swagger. Steve Howell describes the writing of these songs: ÂHeadlightsÂ was written in the spirit of late Â60s/early Â70s California Country Rock with peyote and red wine as the chief inspirations. ÂYou Can Be My Baby NowÂ is the haze of a long weekend listening to Big Star and Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. ÂNightfallsÂ was written after being haunted by a ghost that never told me her name. Danny and JD kicked it up into the southern soul stratosphere. ÂForever and EverÂ is the result of Neil Young and Crazy Horse running thick through my teenage veins. I can still taste it! ÂTwangÂ, well... nothing says attitude better than a twangy Gretsch guitar right between the eyes.Â The attitude of the original lineup is still there, though they may not be the same band that burned up the road all those years before, they still have something to say, something to prove, and something to be.\n\nProceeds from this release, and three others in this series support The Shalom Project (an organization that supports NC families in need).\n\nThis is a regional release and though itÂs available to all RSD-participating stores, it will primarily be available at stores in North Carolina.\n\nSide 1: ÂHeadlightsÂ, ÂYou Can Be My BabyÂ\n\nSide 2: ÂNight FallsÂ, ÂForever And EverÂ, ÂTwangÂ\n\nRaleighwood The Backsliders Backsliders Record Store Day Vinyl RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 250\n\nBad Omens\n\nLive + Unplugged\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 7/17/2021\n\nFormat: 2 x LP\n\nLabel: Sumerian Records\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nNeon Magenta Inside Ultra Clear w/ Black Splatter 2xLP featuring Live + Unplugged versions of the band's songs.Â\n\nGlass Houses (Live) / The Worst In Me (Live) / Never Know (Live) / Careful What You Wish For (Live) / Limits (Live) / Dethrone (Live) / Mercy (Live)\n\nNever Know (Unplugged) / Limits (Unplugged) / Careful What You Wish For (Unplugged) / Mercy (Unplugged) / Burning Out (Unplugged) / If I'm There (Unplugged)\n\nLive + Unplugged Bad Omens Bad Sumerian Records 2 x LP RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 1000\n\nBastille\n\nVs.

Mastered from the original tape reels by Kevin Gray, the limited-edition 180g 3LP set includes an extensive booklet with rare photos, plus interviews with Carlos Garnett and Cecil McBee. Award-winning arts journalist and critic Mark Stryker contributes the main essay alongside remembrances by American journalist, educator, author, activist and friend of Roy Brooks Herb Boyd, alto saxophone legend Charles McPherson (who grew up with Roy Brooks), Louis Hayes (who got Roy the gig with Horace Silver) and more. The project came about as a desire by Reel to Real Recordings to make a positive contribution to Black Lives Matter. Understanding is our celebration of the talent, courage and spirit of the Black musicians who created a timeless and universal art, with the recognition that the injustices of 50 years ago are still with us. Proceeds will go directly to The Detroit Sound Conservancy. The album is produced with the cooperation of Cecil McBee and Carlos Garnett and the estates of Roy Brooks, Harold Mabern and Woody Shaw.\n\nAbout the artist: In his younger days in Detroit, Brooks started off drumming with Yusef Lateef. He played with Horace Silver from 1959-64, including on the album Song for My Father; in 1963 he released his first album as a leader. Following this he freelanced in New York City through the 1960s and early 1970s, playing with Lateef again (1967-70), Sonny Stitt, Lee Morgan, Dexter Gordon, Chet Baker, Junior Cook, Blue Mitchell, Charles McPherson, Pharoah Sanders (1970), Wes Montgomery, Dollar Brand, Jackie McLean, James Moody (1970-72), Charles Mingus (1972-73), and Milt Jackson. His 1970 album The Free Slave featured Cecil McBee and Woody Shaw. Later in 1970 he joined Max Roach's ensemble M'Boom, and in 1972 put together the ensemble The Artistic Truth.\n\nTrack Listing: Side 1: Prelude To Understanding (22:13) Side 2: Understanding (20:17) Side 3: BillieÂs Bounce (21:04) Side 4: Zoltan (24:04) Side 5: Taurus Woman (17:39) Side 6: Taurus Woman Continuation, The Theme (20:33)\n\nUnderstanding Roy Brooks Brooks Reel To Real 3 x LP RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 1500\n\nHarold Budd\n\nI Know This Much Is True (Music from the HBO series)\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 7/17/2021\n\nFormat: 2 x LP\n\nLabel: All Saints\n\nQuantity: 750\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nSoundtrack to the Emmy award-winning HBO TV drama starring Mark Ruffalo.

He was a member of the famous Wrecking Crew, played on Lawrence Welk, recorded Frank ZappaÂs first demo, and even backed Elvis Presley on film. His inventions include the Wah-Wah pedal and the Ecco-Fonic, influencing the development of electric guitar playing. In 1978, Casher was impressed by Bill Conti's top selling score for Rocky, and set out to make an album with original compositions of disco and jazz/funk inspired by the film. With a series of tunes written, he gathered some of the top studio players in Hollywood including Billy Preston, Stan Worth, and members of Johnny Carson's Tonight Show band. The working title for this album in the making was called ÂMusic Inspired By Rocky And Other CompositionsÂ. A film company who had acquired the rights to Sylvester Stallone's 1970 debut \"The Party At Kitty And Stud's\" heard the music and immediately recognized it as the perfect fit for their rebranded ÂItalian StallionÂ film release. Though the score was never released outside of the film, it generated lots of interest in the early 2000Âs when the internet became a widespread phenomenon, and fans began recording the audio off of the film themselves. The soundtrack for Italian Stallion stands on its own as a musical masterpiece. Over 40 years later, with the help of ORG Music, Del Casher dug up his original master tapes and assembled a recordÂs worth of material for the soundtrackÂs first ever release. Italian Stallion will make its long overdue debut with a vinyl pressing, exclusively for RSD 2021.\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. Italian Stallion Theme 2. Three Girls In A Whirl 3. Flexing 4. Outside Walk 5.

As it is, the younger Davies brother has accomplished much more. His first studio album in over 20 years finds Ray's frequently overshadowed sibling reviving that rather charming '70s device, the concept album--the plot here revolving around extraterrestrial visitation and brain implantation. Davies brings the idea of benign aliens a little closer in a collection that recalls some of the best trends of the '60s and '70s. He uses a rock template that harkens back to post-Tommy Who (\"The Lie\"), Mott the Hoople (\"Whose Fooling Who\"), and Deep Purple (\"It Ain't Over 'Till It's Done\"), sounding rather anachronistic as a result. The songs are engaging and show Davies to be a writer of considerable skill and wit, but they're somewhat stuck in the way-back machine.\n\n1. Who's Foolin' Who 2. It Ain't over, 'Till Its Done! 3.

One of MilesÂ favorites of his own recordings was the 1971 soundtrack to the Bill Cayton documentary about Jack Johnson, and he was inspired by the political and racial subtext of the legendary boxerÂs saga. Â Culled from the celebrated expanded project The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions released in 2003, and name-checking a number of pugilistic legends (ÂAli,Â ÂSugar Ray,Â ÂDuran,Â ÂJohnny BrattonÂ), these funk-infused recordings rock harder than anything else that Miles put to tape. Featuring a sterling line-up of musicians (Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Dave Holland, Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Cobham) and a legendary cover photo of Miles in the ring captured by Jim Marshall, the release finds this music issued on vinyl (in brilliant yellow), for general release, for the first time ever.Â\n\nSide A 1.

Dorm rooms coast to coast transform into audio dub houses where young women with aching arms scratch out hand-written labels and personal letters like \"you have to hear this.\" These quasi-booking agent and pirate distributors work long into the night purchasing greyhound tickets for a certain young Folksinger to come play at their school. Today. Folk and poetry prevail. Vulnerable stories arm themselves as powerful songs on Ani DiFranco's self-titled first solo record. Ani's voice is rich and eloquent. Her guitar moves like an appendage. From cockroach pus to abortion rights the record doesn't flinch. This singer/songwriter folk mecca contains songs with an epic stage life such as, \"Both Hands,\" \"Out of Habit,\" \"The Slant,\" and \"Fire Door.\" All of the tracks embody the love and humor inherent in Ani's music. Thematically this record gives a face to feminism that is both beautiful and accessible to anyone. The stories focus on relationships and humanity. We sit in the waiting room of an abortion clinic after facing an angry crowd in \"Lost Woman Song.\" \"Talk to Me Now\" and \"The Story\" confront the inequality of the sexes in a man's world. The love songs examine relationships with the same discernment as the political ones. \"Both Hands\" is a hands down favorite among any DiFranco fan. \"Every Angle\" infuses the thrill of protest with the joy of a crush, \"thoughts of you are picketing my brain/ they refuse to work such long hours without rest/ in unstable conditions at best.\" And the unforgettably poetic and guitarific, \"Fire Door\" is a heartfelt treat in its first studio recording.\n\n1.

Before she arrived at Muscle Shoals to work her magic with the late great Rick Hall, Bobbie cut a laid back album of classic and contemporary jazz tunes that was abandoned before it had chance to see the light of day. This was a shame, as Bobbie proves herself as adept in this genre as in any other. This self-produced collection first saw the light of day on the Bobbie Gentry boxset, but this lost album deserves to have its own separate release and what better format than vinyl? The set exudes a sophisticated and intimate late-night vibe mostly featuring Bobbie alone with her guitar accompanied by a bass player; occasionally there is a whisper of strings from Jimmie Haskell who famously composed the cello and violin arrangement on Ode to Billie Joe. Gentry fans will find much to love in BobbieÂs short lived but brilliant turn as a jazz singer. The original 8 tracks to be supplemented by the ÂI DidnÂt KnowÂ and ÂHushabye MountainÂ demos recorded around the same time, this LP also features the previously unreleased Hushabye Mountain [alternate version].\n\nSuppertime\n\nGod Bless The Child\n\nSince I Fell For You\n\nHereÂs That Rainy Day\n\nI DidnÂt Know [demo]\n\nHushabye Mountain [Demo]\n\nStormy\n\nSave Your Love For Me\n\nThis GirlÂs in Love With You\n\nThe Windows of the World\n\nHushabye Mountain (previously unreleased)\n\nThe Windows of the World Bobbie Gentry Gentry Capitol Nashville LP RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 2500\n\nGod Forbid\n\nDetermination\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 7/17/2021\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: M-Theory Audio\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nIn celebration of the album's 20th anniversary, M-Theory Audio presents the first-ever vinyl release of Determination, from God Forbid.

In addition to an appearance on Ozzfest, the group logged many miles on the road touring alongside legacy acts such as Slayer and Anthrax, as well as scene contemporaries such as Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, and Hatebreed.

This new issue of the record will also include an expanded layout with new liner notes from Doc Coyle, and rare photos and memorabilia.

As a vocalist, she was at her peak. Pete KellyÂs Blues (her best acting role) and Lady And The Tramp (she co-wrote six songs and provided the voices for four characters) were both set to be released. That same year, she recorded 49 selections as radio transcriptions for the World Program Service. These recordings were not released to the public, but used by radio stations with unexpected time to fill. The music is more jazz-oriented than many of her Decca recordings of the time. LeeÂs cool but inwardly heated voice is joined by frequent collaborators, pianist Gene DiNovi, guitarist Bill Pitman, Bob Whitlock or Don Prell on bass, drummer Larry Bunker, Ramon ÂRayÂ Rivera on congas, harpist Stella Castellucci, and trumpeter Pete Candoli. This series compiles the best selections from those 1955 recordings, beginning with 14 tunes on this first volume. The recordings were mastered for vinyl at Infrasonic Mastering and pressed at Furnace Record Pressing on color vinyl, Exclusively as part of RSD Drops.Â\n\nItÂs a Good Day / That Old Black Magic / Autumn in NY / I May Be Wrong / I Gotta Right / I Get A Kick / What is This Thing / The Positive / Me / People Will Say We / What Can I Say / Beautiful Morning / Taking A Chance / Bye Bye BlackbirdÂ\n\nWorld Broadcast Recordings 1955, Vol. 1 Peggy Lee Lee ORG Music LP RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 1500\n\nThe Lillingtons\n\nThe Backchannel Broadcast: 20th Anniversary Edition\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 7/17/2021\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Red Scare Industries\n\nQuantity: 641\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nThe Lillingtons are best known for their catchy tunes about the paranormal, but twenty years ago they surprised us all with the release of The Backchannel Broadcast, an album of high adventure with songs about the Wild West and Russian Spies.

Long before bedroom recording became an aesthetic choice, R. Stevie Moore built a legend of pop experimentalism, home recording, and mystic curmudgeonry. Equal parts songwriter, improviser, composer, producer, filmmaker, artist, and comedy writer, the self-taught Tennessean polymath has released hundreds of homemade albums since the '60s--and inspired a thousand times more. Rather than pose and slither in the music biz, Moore opted for a more genuine life and a spot on the staff at legendary indie radio station WFMU, sharing Bedroom Radio with the world. His independent streak extends to his record releases, the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club successful and long-lasting enough that it became the R. Stevie Moore CD-R Club. By refusing to settle into any one genre or style, Moore has always dedicated himself to eccentric ideas and passions whether around the world or focused into his home. And as Moore now eases into a well-deserved retirement, ON EARTH stands as a powerful statement, an intimate companion, and a goofy guide through a storied career. Ranging all the way back to 1976's classic Phonography, the double-disc retrospective collects a full suite of dazzling power pop, psychedelia, and indie rock, and opens the gateway to the ultimate cult DIY hero.\n\nDocumentary, ÂCool Daddio: The Second Youth of R. Stevie Moore.Â came out on R. Stevie Moore in 2020.\n\nFor fans of Gary Wilson, Arthur Russell, Daniel Johnston, Beat Happening, Mac DeMarco, Tin Pan Alley to Frank Zappa (the angular synth lines of \"I Wish I Could Sing\"), from Roy Wood of the Move (\"I've Begun to Fall in Love\") to Sparks and the Bonzo Dog Band. Other songs are inspired by Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson, Syd Barrett (the brilliantly titled \"Wayne Wayne Go Away\"), Cheap Trick, and XTC.\n\n*Limited edition pressing / Double Black Vinyl With Baby Pink Pink Splatter / Gatefold / Hype Sticker\n\nSince 1966 R. Stevie Moore has recorded nearly 2,000 songs on over 400 very original homemade double albums of alarmingly idiosyncratic variety and styles, often considered a seminal pioneer in the DIY ethic\n\nMade his first home recording in 1966\n\nA New York Times article referenced Moore as the progenitor of \"bedroom pop\"\n\nXTC founder Andy Partridge said of Moore's work: \"What beauty, what invention.\"\n\nAllMusic's Stewart Mason summarized Moore's body of work as a \"one of a kind\" mixture of \"classic pop influences, arty experimentalism, idiosyncratic lyrics, wild stylistic left turns, and homemade rough edges.\"\n\nÂAlthough his work generally takes this humorously abstract approach, it can be straightforward, even gentle.Â NEW YORK ROCKER : JULY-AUGUST 1980\n\nÂEverything he does is one-of-a-kind, because Stevie gets bored quickly. Much of his musical and lyrical content is characterised by a quirky cynicism. He also has a highly sophisticated sense of melody, again without following formulas.Â NJArtform\n\nRolling Stone listed the original release of one of his albums among the fifty most important indie releases ever.

The arrangements and production are cinematic and full of drama which befits a production born of the belly of Hollywood. Romance, intrigue, and a touch of the unreal is where the tripartite of musical craftsmen have brewed this potion of melodies.\n\nThe two unreleased songs will be available for the first time as a 7\" single, exclusively as part of RSD Drops.\n\nÂ \"Cats\" b/w \"Funny Face\"\n\n\"Cats\" b/w \"Funny Face\" Johnny O'Donnell featuring Van Dyke Parks O'Donnell ORG Music 7\" Vinyl RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 1000\n\nPVRIS\n\nUse Me (Deluxe EP)\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 7/17/2021\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Warner\n\nQuantity: 2725\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nPVRIS marked a new era with the release of Use Me in 2020, as frontwoman, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer Lynn Gunn confidently stepped forward as PVRISÂ leader and sole architect. That newfound sense of freedom defined the record, on which Lynn wrote, played the entirely of the guitar, drums, and bass parts, cooked up beats, and of course, sang vocals. Awash in glitchy beat-craft, airy guitars, and spell-binding vocals, the record included 070 Shake collaboration ÂUse Me,Â explosive song ÂHallucinations,Â plus ÂDead Weight,Â ÂGimme A Minute,Â and ÂDeath of MeÂ all brought to life by producer JT Daly [K. Flay].\n\nThe deluxe edition of the acclaimed third studio album featured five new tracks, including remixes of fan-favorites ÂDead WeightÂ (remixed by Nicole Moudaber) and ÂLoveless,Â (remixed by Lynn herself), plus brand-new song ÂThank YouÂ featuring RAYE. For the first time ever, these five tracks are now available on coke bottle clear vinyl, exclusively for RSD Drops.\n\nUse Me (Deluxe EP) PVRIS PVRIS Warner LP RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th 2725\n\nPARTYNEXTDOOR\n\nPARTYNEXTDOOR Limited Edition Vinyl Box Set\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 7/17/2021\n\nFormat: Box Set\n\nLabel: OVO\n\nQuantity: 2100\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jul 17th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nSpecial vinyl box set that contains all four studio albums - including the first album, Partynextdoor, which has never before been available on vinyl.

At that time, he entered a recording studio in an attempt to secure a record deal as a solo artist. The recordings have been long forgotten and unheard until now. The Adams Brothers, who gained notoriety on Mike Judge's Tales From The Tour Bus episode on Paycheck, produced the songs and worked as Paycheck's band. These recordings showcase Paycheck's considerable talent long before the music world took notice. Paycheck performs songs by some of country music's most iconic songwriters such as Cowboy Jack Clement, Mel Tillis, and Bill Anderson.

Composer Don Peake created an incredibly atmospheric and spooky score for this film. Peake's career is insane Âas a guitarist and member of the Wrecking Crew, heÂs played on albums by Marvin Gaye, Phil Spector, Everly Brothers, Mahalia Jackson, John Lennon, Jackson Five and more. It's an incredible career and his musical diversity shines on this score. Fun fact: People Under the Stairs opened at #1 on the box office chart and stayed in the Top 10 for a month.
