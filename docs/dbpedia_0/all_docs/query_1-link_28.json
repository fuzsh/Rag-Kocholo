        "text": "In bacterial cells, the separation of sister chromosomes is performed by the ParABS system and the SMC complex (Britton et al., 1998; Ireton et al., 1994; Jensen and Shapiro, 1999; Marbouty et al., 2015; Mohl and Gober, 1997; Song and Loparo, 2015; Wang et al., 2014). The ParABS system consists of the ATPase protein ParA, the DNA-binding protein ParB, and a centromere-like palindromic DNA sequence named parS (Funnell, 2016; Lin and Grossman, 1998). In vivo imaging experiments in Bacillus subtilis showed that multiple ParB proteins co-localize with SMC complexes at a given parS site forming distinctive clusters in the cell (Gruber and Errington, 2009; Minnen et al., 2011; Sullivan et al., 2009). Notably, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) experiments indicate that ParB covers regions of up to 18 kilobase pairs (kbp) of DNA surrounding parS (Breier and Grossman, 2007; Graham et al., 2014; Minnen et al., 2016; Murray et al., 2006; Rodionov et al., 1999), a phenomenon named spreading. Originally, this spreading was interpreted as the formation of a nucleoprotein filament extending from a parS nucleation site (Murray et al., 2006; Rodionov et al., 1999). However, it later became clear that ParB foci contained far too few proteins to coat tens of kbp-long DNA segments (Graham et al., 2014). Instead, we and others have shown that ParB can self-associate to form networks which include specific binding to parS sequences but also non-specific binding to distal DNA segments. Overall, this results in the condensation and bridging of DNA at low forces (below 1 pN) (Fisher et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2014; Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019; Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2015), and could explain how distant regions of DNA are bound by limited numbers of ParB proteins as shown in ChIP experiments. However, DNA condensation has only been observed in vitro at high ParB concentrations, in the low micromolar range. Moreover, and unexpectedly, parS sequences did not affect DNA condensation under these conditions (Taylor et al., 2015). Therefore, the mechanism of ParB spreading and condensation, and in particular the molecular basis for the specific localization around parS, has remained unclear despite extensive investigation in vivo, in vitro, and in silico (Broedersz et al., 2014; Guilhas et al., 2020; Sanchez et al., 2015; Walter et al., 2020).\n\nParB proteins comprise three distinct domains (Figure 1A and B). The N-terminal domain (NTD) binds ParA (Bouet and Funnell, 1999; Davis et al., 1992; Radnedge et al., 1998; Vecchiarelli et al., 2010) and was recently appreciated to contain a CTP-binding pocket that serves as a CTP-dependent dimerization interface (Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019; Soh et al., 2019). Mutation R80A in the CTP-binding pocket has been shown to impair nucleoid segregation and ParB spreading (Autret et al., 2001; Breier and Grossman, 2007). A central DNA-binding domain (CDBD) binds specifically to the palindromic parS sequence and may also facilitate dimerization (Leonard et al., 2004; Schumacher and Funnell, 2005). In this central region, the mutation R149G within a helix-turn-helix motif impedes parS binding (Autret et al., 2001; Fisher et al., 2017; Gruber and Errington, 2009). Finally, the C-terminal domain (CTD) forms dimers with a lysine-rich surface that binds to DNA non-specifically (Fisher et al., 2017). Interactions between CTDs are essential for condensation in vitro and for the formation of ParB foci in vivo (Fisher et al., 2017). Based upon these results, we proposed a model for DNA condensation dependent on ParB CTD dimerization and non-specific DNA (nsDNA) binding (Fisher et al., 2017). Further work using lateral pulling of long DNA molecules in a magnetic tweezers (MT) setup combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) demonstrated that ParB networks are highly dynamic and display a continual exchange of protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces (Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019).\n\nRecently, two laboratories demonstrated independent that B. subtilis ParB and the Myxococcus xanthus ParB hydrolyse cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to cytidine diphosphate (CDP) (Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019; Soh et al., 2019) and require CTP for partition complex formation in vivo (Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019). Importantly, parS DNA stimulates the binding and hydrolysis of CTP (Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019; Soh et al., 2019), CTP has been shown to be necessary for ParB spreading in vitro (Jalal et al., 2020), and a model has been proposed in which centromeres assemble via the loading of ParB-DNA sliding clamps at parS sequences (Jalal et al., 2020; Soh et al., 2019). These observations fundamentally change our understanding of how ParB can become engaged with nsDNA surrounding parS, but the significance of CTP-dependent spreading in the formation of the ParB networks that cause DNA bridging and condensation has not been addressed.\n\nHere, we investigated the role of CTP binding and hydrolysis in the binding of ParB to parS sequences and nsDNA at the single-molecule level. We present the first visualization of the specific binding of ParB to parS. ParB proteins were also detected at nsDNA far from parS, albeit at a much lower density. Importantly, this only occurred in parS-containing DNA, suggesting spreading from parS sites. The placement of tight-binding protein roadblocks on DNA constrained the spreading, suggesting it arises from one-dimensional movement along the contour of DNA, consistent with a sliding clamp model. CTP binding mediated by a Mg2+ cofactor, but not CTP hydrolysis, was critical for spreading from parS to non-parS sites which triggered DNA condensation at nanomolar protein concentration. We propose a model where ParB-CTP-Mg2+ loads to parS, diffuses to non-parS sites, and then self-associates, resulting in the condensation of kbp-long DNA molecules.\n\nWe report here the first visualization of ParB binding to parS sequences. Previous observation of the specific binding to parS was hindered by the fact that ParB binding to DNA induces condensation and bridging (Graham et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2015). To overcome this issue, we and others stretched the DNA molecules using flow or magnetic pulling combined with TIRFM (Graham et al., 2014; Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019). However, these experiments were performed in the absence of CTP and required high concentrations of ParB, conditions which allow ParB to interact directly (i.e., from free solution rather than via parS loading sites) with nsDNA. The recent discovery that ParB is a parS-dependent CTPase has led to the proposal of radically new models for ParB-DNA interactions in which parS acts as a loading site for ParB-DNA sliding clamps (Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019; Soh et al., 2019). Together with bulk bio-layer interferometric analysis (Jalal et al., 2020), and supported by recent in silico modelling (Walter et al., 2020), this work suggests that ParB binds to parS in the apo state and CTP binding induces a conformational change that liberates the ParB dimer from parS allowing spreading. Motivated by these important new observations, we have revisited our earlier single-molecule experiments using much lower concentrations of ParB in the presence of CTP. Our results confirm many aspects of the published models but also extend them, by addressing how CTP facilitates localized DNA condensation around parS sites.\n\nIn an attempt to visualize the specific binding of ParB to parS in the presence of CTP, Soh et al. observed stretched DNA bound to a glass surface using TIRFM and reported accumulation of ParB around parS (Soh et al., 2019). Here, we used a combination of optical tweezers and confocal microscopy that allowed us not only to observe more precisely the direct binding of ParB to single DNA molecules, but also facilitated the quantification of fluorescence intensity around parS sites and distal non-specific sites. In our assay we found very good correlation between the position of ParB in time-averaged intensity profiles and the position of the groups of parS sites engineered into our substrate. These profiles easily allowed us to distinguish between the different orientations of substrate molecules (Figure 1). In these experiments, confocal illumination was initiated after a long ParB incubation with the substrate DNA such that the initial images should reflect equilibrium binding conditions (Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019). In the absence of CTP, we observed a clear fluorescence intensity at parS sequences and a zero intensity (within error) in distal regions of nsDNA. We interpret this as reflecting the highly specific binding of ParB in an open clamp conformation directly to the parS sequences via the HtH motifs in the CDBD (Figure 7, step 1).\n\nWhen we next added either CTP or the non-hydrolysable analogue CTPγS, we saw a four-fold increased fluorescence intensity around the parS sequences and a lower (but clearly non-zero) intensity in distal non-specific regions of the DNA. Note that, because this is a single-molecule experiment, the increased intensity associated with the parS clusters strongly suggests that there is a higher density of ParB dimers on the DNA at or near (i.e., within the spatial resolution of the imaging; ~250 nm) parS sequences. We interpret this as the CTP binding-dependent conversion of parS-bound ParB dimers into sliding clamps that move into neighbouring regions of the DNA to allow additional ParB open clamps to be recruited to the DNA (Figure 7, step 2). It is interesting to note that the presence of CTP and CTPγS does not prevent the initial binding of ParB to DNA by favouring a closed clamp structure before DNA association. This might suggest either that the DNA entry gate for ParB is a different interface (e.g., transient opening of the CTD) or simply that the CTP cannot bind efficiently until after DNA enters ParB though the NTD entry gate. In either case, following the formation of closed ParB clamps on DNA, we imagine that they spread but remain largely restrained to the region of nsDNA immediately surrounding parS sequences as a result of protein:protein interactions (Figure 7, step 2, interlaced circles). Note however that in our C-trap experiment, the ends of the DNA substrate are held at high force by the beads, meaning that the DNA cannot begin to condense by sliding into the ParB networks that are forming around parS. The higher density of proteins (and a higher fluorescence) in the parS region could also arise from the design of the DNA substrate, where sliding ParBs might become trapped between adjacent parS sites. However, C-trap experiments using substrates containing seven or two parS sites (Figure 3) also showed higher florescence density at parS favouring the idea of short-range ParB network formation around parS versus confinement by sliding.\n\nThe weaker fluorescence intensity in distal non-specific regions of the substrate is observed exclusively in CTP or CTPγS conditions and is interpreted as ParB sliding clamps which have escaped from the ParB network at parS (Figure 7, step 2). Direct evidence that these ParB molecules are indeed involved in one-dimensional (1D) sliding interactions with the DNA is provided by experiments using QD labelled ParB (Figure 3). We measured a diffusion constant for ParB of 0.41±0.02 µm2 s−1, in agreement with other reports that used single-molecules analysis (Graham et al., 2014) and super-resolution cell imaging (Guilhas et al., 2020). Roadblock experiments with a catalytically inactive EcoRI mutant also supported 1D diffusion. The weaker fluorescence intensity associated with sparsely distributed ParB molecules in nsDNA regions was only observed in segments of DNA containing parS sequences and was corralled by EcoRI roadblocks placed either side of the centromere sequences.\n\nDespite the fact that free ParB is always present in the imaging channel in our experiments, we observed a rapid decay of the fluorescence intensity upon illumination. This suggests that the photobleaching rate is faster than the binding and unbinding kinetics of ParB. Interestingly, we observed an apparently faster fluorescence loss at distal regions of nsDNA when compared to the regions close to parS (Animation 1 and 2). This likely reflects the much higher density of ParB that our model anticipates in parS regions compared to distal nsDNA, where we observed the fluorescence of individual diffusing proteins. Alternatively, continuous loading at parS may counteract the fluorescence decay caused by photobleaching to a greater extent than at distal DNA regions (where ParB cannot bind from free solution).\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of CTP on ParB-induced DNA condensation, we employed an MT apparatus. In the presence of CTP-Mg2+, ParB condensed parS-containing DNA at nanomolar concentrations, much lower than those reported before (Fisher et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2015; Figure 4). Importantly, this strong stimulatory effect of CTP on DNA condensation, which is completely specific for parS-containing DNA, helps to resolve the question of how ParB networks can form uniquely at parS loci within the huge bacterial chromosome. This had not been readily apparent from previous experiments performed without CTP (see Graham et al., 2014; Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2015 for discussion). Control experiments showed that efficient condensation required both the parS sequence and either CTP or CTPγS, suggesting that it is CTP binding but not its hydrolysis that is important for promoting condensation. The condensation force increased with the number of parS sites (Figure 6) and a minimum value of between 5 and 7 sites was required to observe condensation, probably because a minimum force is always applied in these MT assays (see below).\n\nWe can interpret the behaviour observed in the MT using a simple extension of the model described above for the confocal microscopy experiments. In the MT experiment, the DNA ends are held apart by a very low force and the DNA is able to condense. Therefore, the ParB dimers which load around the parS sequence (Figure 7, step 2), or those which diffuse to the nsDNA region, can self-associate bringing distal DNA parts together (Figure 7, step 3). This creates a dynamic network of ParB molecules constraining DNA loops. Importantly, MT experiments including EcoRI roadblocks directly linked ParB diffusion with condensation because the DNA region non-accessible to ParB, due to EcoRI blocking, remained non-condensed (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The greater the number of parS sequences present in the DNA, the greater will be the loading rate of ParB clamps into non-specific regions of the DNA, and the more stable will be the condensation against weak restraining forces. In vivo experiments have shown that a single parS is enough to promote chromosome segregation (Broedersz et al., 2014; Jecz et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). This might simply reflect the difference in ParB concentrations, or solution conditions that are found in vivo compared to our MT experiments. However, we favour the simplest explanation which relates to the difference in restraining forces between in vitro and in vivo conditions. Indeed, further experiments using TPM and AFM performed in the absence of force indicate that a single parS sequence is sufficient for DNA condensation under CTP-Mg2+ conditions.\n\nThe molecular basis for the protein-protein interactions that hold the ParB network together in our model remains unclear and is an important subject for future study. ParB contains multiple non-exclusive interfaces within all three domains that could be relevant to this activity (Song et al., 2017). For example, we have previously provided direct evidence that disruption of CTD-CTD interactions decondenses DNA in vitro and prevents the formation of ParB networks in vivo, so these protein-protein interactions may contribute to network formation (Figure 7, step 3). However, we note that our results can also be re-interpreted in the light of the new concept of topological engagement between DNA and a ParB toroidal clamp. If CTD-CTD interactions are important for closing the sliding clamp around DNA as has been suggested (Jalal et al., 2020; Soh et al., 2019), then disruption of these interactions would dissolve ParB networks, not by breaking protein-protein interactions between ParB molecules, but rather by releasing the constrained DNA loops and promoting ParB dissociation into free solution. Other possible interfaces that may establish ParB networks include those that have been observed between the CDBD or NTD (Chen et al., 2015; Leonard et al., 2004; Schumacher and Funnell, 2005). A final open question concerns the loading of the SMC complexes at bacterial centromeres which leads to the individualization of bacterial chromosomes following DNA replication (Hayes and Barillà, 2006; Schumacher, 2008). Despite the intimate functional relationship between the ParABS partitioning system and SMC complexes, the nature of the physical interactions between these systems and their regulation are not understood."
