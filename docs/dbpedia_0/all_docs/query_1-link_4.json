it aint so\n\nI can still make you...\n\nI, I'm on your side\n\nHanging around\n\nI used to want the morning\n\nYou and me\n\nJust hanging around\n\nBut I can't shake this feeling off\n\nCan't shake this dead-weight off of my back\n\nIt's a troubled place we stay\n\nBut we just play it out\n\nYou give too much away\n\nIt leaves you cold, oh, oh\n\nGot no place else to go\n\nIn a daze\n\nJust hanging around\n\nIt's a dirt ground we crawl upon\n\nI've stared at your face for much too long\n\nIt's a troubled place we stay\n\nWhere we just wait it out\n\nWatch us give too much away\n\nIt leaves you cold, oh oh\n\nCold, oh oh\n\nI used to want the morning\n\nYou and me just hanging around\n\nIt's a troubled game we stage\n\nWhere we just play it out\n\nWatch us give too much away\n\nAnd we just wait it out\n\nAnd the words you meant to say\n\nAnd the words I gave away\n\nIt leaves you cold, oh oh\n\nCold, oh oh\n\nCold, oh oh\n\nCold\n\nBack of my hand\n\nI'll be seeing you tomorrow\n\nI'll be seeing you again\n\nGod knows we've said so little\n\nI'd go so far as to call you a friend\n\nBut there's something in your ways\n\nThat keeps me vying for a connection\n\nAnd I know you feel the same\n\nIt's become a two-way addiction\n\nCome on and give me your heart\n\nWrite it on the back of my hand\n\nAnd say it's forever\n\nWell we never really said goodbye\n\nKinda left it in the air\n\nAnd as the train pulled off I knew you loved her more\n\nOh no no no no\n\nI'm not afraid to lose\n\nOh no no no no\n\nJust give me some time and I'll walk to a different groove\n\nGo on and give her your heart\n\nWrite it on the back of her hand\n\nAnd say it's forever\n\nGo on and give her your heart\n\nWrite it on the back of her hand\n\nAnd say it's forever\n\nThat's alright, that's ok, the thoughts of you are leaving\n\nThat's alright, that's ok, the thoughts of you are leaving\n\nAnyway, are fading anyway\n\nCome on and give her your heart\n\nWrite it on the back of her hand\n\nAnd say it's forever\n\nCome on and give me your heart\n\nCome on and give me your heart\n\nCome on and give me your heart\n\nOver & Over\n\nOver and over\n\nWe tried to make it\n\nWe played all the right games\n\nWe took too much for granted\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me\n\nAgain\n\nOver and over\n\nWe made too many plans\n\nWhen it came to reality\n\nWe forgot how to land\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me\n\nAgain\n\nOver and over\n\nWe tried to make it\n\nWe played all the right games\n\nWe took too much for granted\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me yeah\n\nPlease don't stray, so far from me\n\nPlease

thing go\n\nIn the shade of every moment I bled\n\nSuch a sorrow was to be expected\n\nI let a good thing go\n\nI let a good thing go\n\nNow every feeling it kicks me to the bone\n\nAnd takes me under to a place that I have known\n\nThere goes my quiet life I used to keep me warm\n\nIn the shade of this moment I am born\n\nI let a good thing go\n\nI let a good thing go\n\nIn the shade of every moment I bled\n\nSuch a sorrow was to be expected\n\nI let a good thing go\n\nI let a good thing go\n\nGood thing go\n\nRan for Miles\n\nWell I got myself a new day\n\nAnd I got myself a second chance\n\nSo I headed to the bus stop\n\nAnd the sun, the sun was warm on my back\n\nToday I ran for miles\n\nJust to see what I was made of\n\nToday I ran for all that was mine\n\nWell I got myself a song inside\n\nAnd I got myself some full blown daylight\n\nWanna tell you just how hard it's been\n\nTrying to talk myself out of jumping\n\nToday I ran for miles\n\nJust to see what I was made of\n\nToday I ran for all that was mine, yeah\n\nToday I ran for miles\n\nJust to see what I was made of\n\nToday I ran for all that was mine\n\nJust to see what I was made of\n\nToday I ran for all that was mine, yeah\n\nWhat a Day\n\nFive hours from now\n\nYou'll be sleeping\n\nI'll be lying awake wondering\n\nDid we make the right decision\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nBrian and I decided\n\nThis year we'll make ourselves believe in everything\n\nI don't know about you but I've had enough of trying to live through doubt and\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a way to go\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a day\n\nWhat a day we had\n\nWhat a way to go\n\nWhat a way to go\n\nTear in my Side\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nWhat it's like to be alive and then shot down\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nI feel it, I feel it, all\n\nI feel it, I feel it, all\n\nI feel it, I feel it, all\n\nI feel it, I feel it, all\n\nI feel it, I feel it, all\n\nI feel it, I feel it, all\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nTear in my side, I feel it all\n\nTear in my side\n\nI Wanna Stay\n\nI wanna stay\n\nOut all night\n\nWith you\n\nYeah you make my world all right\n\nNo sun was up\n\nToday we didn't mind\n\nToo busy making the rain shine\n\nAnd there goes\n\nEverything\n\nAnd I don't care\n\nYeah there goes\n\nEverything\n\nAnd I just don't care\n\nAs long as you're near\n\nI gotta stay\n\nOut all night\n\n'Til I'm back feeling alright\n\nAnd there goes\n\nEverything\n\nAnd I don't care\n\nYeah there goes\n\nEverything\n\nAnd I just don't care\n\nAs long as you're near\n\nLucky one (bird of casadaga)\n\nAren't you the lucky one\n\nNever need any more than this...\n\nMy God\n\nMy God\n\nHope you're on call\n\n'Cause I maybe in danger of crashing before I get to fall\n\nNight on my Side\n\nWhen I hear the sound of laughing\n\nIt takes me back to forever\n\nWhere the sunset sleeps across the fields\n\nAwoken by my dreams racing\n\nWith such a long goodbye\n\nYou knew it would make you cry\n\nThe twilight comes to quieten our hearts\n\nMy good friends we were scared of nothing\n\nLamplight stretched across my bed\n\nI'm awoken by cars racing\n\nWith such a long goodbye\n\nYou knew it would make you cry\n\nWith such a long goodbye\n\nYou knew it would make you cry\n\nPicking them up\n\nThose pieces I've dropped\n\nThe love that I stopped\n\nGonna find some rest\n\nI lied to my friends\n\nI showed him I could\n\nEven told him I would\n\nBut then, I gave in\n\nPicking them up\n\nThose pieces I've dropped\n\nThe love that I stopped\n\nGonna find some rest\n\nGonna find some rest\n\nGonna find some rest\n\nGonna find some rest\n\nGonna find some rest\n\n*** Thanx a lot to Gerardo for this one ***\n\nThe Roads Don't Love You\n\nTwo Step\n\nTwo steps closer, than i had in mind\n\nBut i am good at the cold shoulder\n\nI lost myself, trying to catch the sun\n\nI gave you everything, left myself with none\n\nWell, i'm living straight now you're not on my mind\n\nMy sweet addiction, always at the side\n\nStop chasing every little thing that sparks\n\nYou'll carry all you ever need in your heart\n\nStop chasing every little thing\n\nI'm sorry but i'm restless\n\nThe closer it gets, the less i need it\n\nI lost myself trying to catch the sun\n\nTurn the corner, now walk on\n\nStop chasing every little thing that sparks\n\nYou'll carry all you ever need in your heart\n\nStop chasing every little thing that sparks\n\nYou'll carry all you ever need in your heart\n\nOh, wait a minute more\n\nCos you almost said it out, oh wait a minute more\n\nCos you almost said it, say it to me now\n\nStop chasing every little thing that sparks\n\nYou'll carry all you ever need in your heart\n\nStop chasing every little thing that sparks\n\nYou'll carry all you ever need in your heart\n\nStop chasing every little thing that sparks\n\n(it always sparkles from a distance)\n\nYou'll carry all you ever need in your heart\n\n(it'll burn you in an instant)\n\nAnother for the Darkness\n\nTalk, talk.. Empty sentiment\n\nI havent got the heart for disappointment\n\nTen thousand reasons why i should get out\n\nThe state you're in, i better get you home\n\nCar crash, running through my head\n\nI'm saying things that are best left unsaid\n\nStop looking at me that way\n\nI'm not the answer, i'll be your anchor\n\nTired of the fight\n\nWell i dont understand you better than most\n\nI am just your friend, with troubles of my own\n\nAnd i don't understand you better than most\n\nBetter than most\n\nYou say you're unravelling\n\nI havent got the heart to watch you crying\n\nOne for the road, and another for the darkness\n\nI'll get you home and tomorrow you'll forget this\n\nGet ready for the fight\n\nWell i don't understand you better than most\n\nI am just your friend, with troubles of my own\n\nAnd i dont understand you better than most\n\nBetter than most\n\nHailstones beating on my heart\n\nAnd i'm tired of holding back\n\nWhat if i was to? What would be so wrong with that?\n\nThese days i'm surrounded by people i dont even like\n\nBut boy, you are a flower, tonight i'll be a liar\n\nAnd tell you, it's not right..\n\nThat i dont understand you better than most\n\nI am just your friend with troubles of my own\n\nAnd i dont understand you better than most\n\nBetter than most\n\nHappy Sad\n\nMy dirty joy, my laden back\n\nMy

strangeness is a welcome guest\n\nAnd i will make a bed for him to rest\n\nWe will arise there after\n\nFall around the place in drunken laughter\n\nAnd never look back again\n\nYears of merry dancing\n\nWeighed heavy on our chest\n\nNo more could we afford a place to rest\n\nCold was the winter\n\nWe promised to stay dry together\n\nWe never spoke again\n\nSomething in my Way\n\nThe

that you didnât say\n\nIt's that sad song on the line\n\nThat cuts right through your ribcage and gets stuck inside\n\nAs the wheels kick dust in your view\n\nYou know the longer you look\n\nThe further she'll get from you\n\nWhere's the light now you've only got the shade\n\nWell she took all the colour\n\nNow it's back to black and white days\n\nThat sad song stings your eyes\n\nSinging \"wonder do I ever cross your mind\"\n\nSuch a sad ol song\n\nSuch a sad ol song\n\nSuch a sad ol song\n\nAt Constant Speed\n\nA lonely burden rests gently\n\nThis is harder than I thought\n\nYour face is distant and paler now\n\nItâs funny how things work out\n\nBut if I keep a constant speed\n\nAnd watch everything rush past me\n\nItâs the quickest way to leave it all behind\n\nOnly it never leaves\n\nI'm beginning to forget, I'm beginning to forget you\n\nI just see an outline\n\nI'm beginning to forget, I'm beginning to forget you\n\nI hope that's alright\n\nI miss your kitchen window view\n\nThe effect I had on you\n\nYour voice is lost in static waves\n\nErased by every day\n\nIf I keep a constant speed\n\nAnd let everything rush past me\n\nThis bloody mess I can leave behind\n\nOnly it never leaves\n\nI'm beginning to forget\n\nI'm beginning to forget you\n\nI just see an outline\n\nIâm beginning to forget\n\nI'm beginning to forget you\n\nI hope that's alright\n\nI'm beginning to forget\n\nI'm beginning to forget you\n\nI just see an outline\n\nI'm beginning to forget\n\nI'm beginning to forget you\n\nI hope that's alright\n\nI just see an

in every face I see\n\nBut the city brings sweet relief\n\nUntil you find me\n\nI might as well be lost in Hollywood or London town\n\nThan be lost in you, you\n\nI might as well be lost on Oslo or Tokyo, Seoul\n\nThan be lost in your world\n\nSomething you said created a storm\n\nThat triggered a landslide\n\nAnd that took you from me\n\nFalse starts and endless dreams\n\nYou say youâre doing okay\n\nBut your farce give it all away\n\nUntil you find me\n\nI might as well be lost in Hollywood or London town\n\nThan be lost in you, you\n\nI might as well be lost on Oslo or Tokyo, Seoul\n\nThan be lost in your world\n\nWhere did you go\n\nWhere did you go\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nI turn around and everything changed\n\nNow I might as well be lost in Hollywood or London town\n\nThan be lost in you\n\nI might as well be lost in Oslo or Tokyo, Seoul\n\nThan be lost in your world\n\nJust keep you running\n\nJust keep running\n\nInto my arms\n\nAll I need\n\nWake up tired little eyes\n\nI know the feeling when the world\n\nKicks you on the inside\n\nItâs what youâre doing to me\n\nTomorrowâs banging on your door\n\nThe sun is screaming\n\nGet up, get out and face the roar\n\nWhen in gets too much\n\nRest your mouth on my mouth\n\nThis is all I need\n\nThis is all I need\n\nTo carry me\n\nAnd now Iâm slipping on the ground\n\nI liked the feeling of free falling\n\nBut thereâs no more down\n\nI donât wanna get up\n\nDonât wanna stand in line\n\nIâm gonna keep my eyes closed\n\nGod knows I find\n\nThis is all I need\n\nThis is all I need\n\nTo carry, to carry me\n\nThis is all I need\n\nTo carry, to carry me\n\nThis is all I need\n\nTo carry, to carry me\n\nWake up tired eyes\n\nWhen itâs not real\n\nRest your mouth\n\nOn my mouth\n\nThis is all I need\n\nTo carry meâ¦\n\nFire\n\nChocking on the edges of a melody\n\nYou used to sing to me\n\nPull yourself together again\n\nPull yourself together\n\nI gotta hand it to you\n\nWho could tell you hide it well\n\nThey say youâre brave to jump\n\nBut I see your eyes and I know you fell\n\nYour face, your face\n\nGives it all away\n\nItâs says the suns not here\n\nBut I know itâs coming\n\nYou are the fire in my spine\n\nLeave no shadow burning up my sorrow\n\nYou are this melody I canât get out\n\nGetâs caught in my ribcage turning me inside out\n\nHere comes a high\n\nHere comes a low\n\nAll is quiet in your arms in the early morning\n\nCars chasing light below\n\nMy love what a mess weâre in\n\nCaught up in confusion and skin\n\nHas the world gone crazy\n\nHave we all gone mad\n\nWhat I wouldnât do to bring you back\n\nYou are the fire in my spine\n\nLeave no shadow burning up my sorrow\n\nYou are this melody I canât get out\n\nGetâs caught in my ribcage turning me inside out\n\nThe sun is not here\n\nBut I know itâs coming\n\nYou are the fire in my spine\n\nLeave no shadow burning up my sorrow\n\nYou are this melody I canât get out\n\nGetâs caught in my ribcage turning me inside out\n\nWish I could carry you away from here\n\nBrittle Winter\n\nBoth of us hanging on\n\nTo driftwood passing\n\nThe sun has been now gone\n\nThe waterâs bloody freezing\n\nWhat were we thinking\n\nWhy did we ever jump\n\nGone like the winter\n\nGone like my lover\n\nGone is the aching\n\nGone forever\n\nCar lights keep passing\n\nWeâre down in a deep ravine\n\nYou have never been so dear to me\n\nI have never felt this clean\n\nWhat were we thinking\n\nWhy did we ever jump\n\nGone like the winter\n\nGone like my lover\n\nGone is the aching\n\nGone like the flower\n\nMy heart gave up the fight\n\nDown down down\n\nPlease donât take her\n\nMy brittle winter\n\nIâm gone like the lovers\n\nGone like the liars\n\nGone is my aching\n\nGone is my love\n\nGone gone gone\n\nShock to my System\n\nItâs like getting close to the sun\n\nI wanna tell you things I just canât get\n\nAir in my lungs long enough to explain\n\nSee I was born awake\n\nLittle by little I simply fell asleep\n\nThen you came and it all changed\n\nYou were right, I was half alive\n\nYou were a shock to my system\n\nTearing up my quiet life\n\nNow itâs hard to watch your back\n\nMove away from me just like that\n\nIn an instant\n\nAll is gone, all is wrong\n\nIâm caught in the red but Iâm fading to grey\n\nA constant reminder that nothing stays the same\n\nBut nothing ever really changes\n\nYou were right, I was half alive\n\nYou were a shock to my system\n\nTearing up my quiet life\n\nI felt safe walking straight lines\n\nYou were a shock to my system\n\nLighting up a fire so bright\n\nNow thereâs no turning back for me\n\nI met you in the corner of the day\n\nYou said I was beautiful\n\nBut only when Iâm lost\n\nAnd you were right\n\nI was half alive\n\nYou were a shock to my system\n\nTearing up my quiet life\n\nI felt safe walking straight lines\n\nYou were a shock to my system\n\nLighting up a fire so bright\n\nThereâs no turning back for me\n\nTo Be Beside You\n\nAlone, such a simple word\n\nThe sick on easy in this world\n\nFor I have longed but never stirred\n\nAnd given up what I could deserve\n\nJust to be beside you\n\nJust to be beside you\n\nThis could almost be love\n\nThis could almost be in love\n\nLet's not read all the signs\n\n'Cause there's a lot to be said for living a lie\n\nJust to be beside you\n\nJust to be beside you\n\nSay it out loud, no nothing can reach us here\n\nSay it out loud, no nothing can reach us here\n\nSay it out loud, no nothing can reach us here, here\n\nSay it out\n\nRuin\n\nHiding out in trenches Iâve built\n\nIâm so good at it now\n\nI know how to trick myself\n\nWeâll soon see if youâll be my ruin\n\nI maybe high but you got me terrified\n\nYou make me feel something again\n\nYou make me feel human\n\nYou make me feel something again\n\nAt least I feel human again\n\nI was fine with nothing\n\nI was fine in a dream\n\nDid nobody tell you\n\nYou canât wake a girl who pretends to sleep\n\nI, I donât know how you did it\n\nBut I canât catch my breath\n\nWrapped so tightly round my chest\n\nYour love is a tourniquet\n\nYou make me feel something again\n\nYou make me feel human\n\nYou make me feel something again\n\nAt least I feel human again\n\nWhat do you burn\n\nWhat do you keep\n\nYou canât wake a girl\n\nWho pretends to sleep\n\nOver and over\n\nCutting at scars\n\nYou need the darkness\n\nIf you wanna see stars\n\nWhat do you burn\n\nWhat do you keep\n\nYou canât wake a girl\n\nWho pretends to sleep\n\nOver and over\n\nCutting at scars\n\nYou need the darkness\n\nIf you wanna see stars\n\nI donât know why I tell you these things\n\nI donât know why I tell you these things\n\nI donât know why I tell you these things\n\nI donât know why I tell you these things\n\nSorrow Be Gone\n\nI see a mountain\n\nThe wind is a crazy man\n\nSaying no you can't\n\nBut I know once I get up there\n\nGone, my sorrow be gone\n\nMy sorrow be gone\n\nAway\n\nI will not

opposite\n\nDirection until I realise\n\nDoesn't matter where I go\n\nCopy paste is a sin, always on the run is better\n\nBaby I'm just making my way back to you\n\nMaking my way back\n\nI was always

the pain\n\nThat sits in equal parts between us\n\nWe get caught up chasing lights\n\nWe play the game but the rope gets tight\n\nNothing changes till you change\n\nI know you don`t want it easy\n\nI see your face in every face\n\nDoesn't matter where I go\n\nAlways hollow, chasing shadows\n\nI'm just making my way back to you\n\nMaking my way back\n\nI was always making my way back\n\nI just

path\n\nOh I was making my way back to you\n\nMaking my way back\n\nI was always making my way back\n\nI just didn't realise\n\nCaught\n\nAlone such a simple word\n\nSick uneasy in this world\n\nFor I have longed but never stirred\n\nI have waded through a dirt heart\n\nThen somebody's hand\n\nCaught my hand\n\nAnd pulled me up, pulled me up\n\nCopy paste is a sin, always on the run is better\n\nThere is a lesser kind of sight\n\nThat means to steal you from this life\n\nTake comfort in artificial light\n\nWhere angels are nowhere\n\nThen somebody's hand\n\nCaught my hand\n\nAnd pulled me up, pull me up\n\nYou pulled me up, you pull me up\n\nYou pulled me up, pull me up\n\nAe Fond Kiss\n\n( Robert Burns )\n\nAe fond kiss, and then we sever;\n\nAe fareweel, and then for
