        "text": "Comparison of environmental forcings affecting suspended sediments variability in two macrotidal, highly-turbid estuaries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJalÃ³n-Rojas, Isabel; Schmidt, Sabine; Sottolichio, Aldo\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe relative contribution of environmental forcing frequencies on turbidity variability is, for the first time, quantified at seasonal and multiannual time scales in tidal estuarine systems. With a decade of high-frequency, multi-site turbidity monitoring, the two nearby, macrotidal and highly-turbid Gironde and Loire estuaries (west France) are excellent natural laboratories for this purpose. Singular Spectrum Analyses, combined with Lomb-Scargle periodograms and Wavelet Transforms, were applied to the continuous multiannual turbidity time series. Frequencies of the main environmental factors affecting turbidity were identified: hydrological regime (high versus low river discharges), river flow variability, tidal range, tidal cycles, and turbulence. Their relative influences show similar patterns in both estuaries and depend on the estuarine region (lower or upper estuary) and the time scale (multiannual or seasonal). On the multiannual time scale, the relative contribution of tidal frequencies (tidal cycles and range) to turbidity variability decreases up-estuary from 68% to 47%, while the influence of river flow frequencies increases from 3% to 42%. On the seasonal time scale, the relative influence of forcings frequencies remains almost constant in the lower estuary, dominated by tidal frequencies (60% and 30% for tidal cycles and tidal range, respectively); in the upper reaches, it is variable depending on hydrological regime, even if tidal frequencies are responsible for up 50% of turbidity variance. These quantifications show the potential of combined spectral analyses to compare the behavior of suspended sediment in tidal estuaries throughout the world and to evaluate long-term changes in environmental forcings, especially in a context of global change. The relevance of this approach to compare nearby and overseas systems and to support management strategies is discussed (e.g., selection of effective operation frequencies/regions, prediction of the most\n\nSalinity and turbidity distributions in the Brisbane River estuary, Australia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, Yingying; Zhang, Hong; Lemckert, Charles\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe Brisbane River estuary (BRE) in Australia not only plays a vital role in ecosystem health, but is also of importance for people who live nearby. Comprehensive investigations, both in the short- and long-term, into the salinity and turbidity distributions in the BRE were conducted. Firstly, the analysis of numerical results revealed that the longitudinal salinity varied at approximately 0.45 and 0.61 psu/h during neap and spring tides, respectively. The turbidity stayed at a higher level and was less impacted by tide in the upper estuary, however, the water cleared up while the tide changed from flood to ebb in the mid and lower estuary. The second investigation into the seasonal variations of salinity and turbidity in the BRE was conducted, using ten-year field measurement data. A fourth-order polynomial equation was proposed, describing the longitudinal variation in salinity dilution changes as the upstream distance in the BRE during the wet and dry seasons. From the observation, the mid and upper estuaries were vertically well-mixed during both seasons, but the lower BRE was stratified, particularly during the wet season. The estuary turbidity maximum (ETM) zone was about 10 km longer during the wet season than the dry season. Particular emphasis was given to the third investigation into the use of satellite remote sensing techniques for estimation of the turbidity level in the BRE. A linear relationship between satellite observed water reflectance and surface turbidity level in the BRE was validated with an R2 of 0.75. The application of satellite-observed water reflectance therefore provided a practical solution for estimating surface turbidity levels of estuarine rivers not only under normal weather conditions, but also during flood events. The results acquired from this study are valuable for further hydrological research in the BRE and particularly prominent for immediate assessment of flood impacts.\n\nEffects of prevailing winds on turbidity of a shallow estuary.\n\nPubMed\n\nCho, Hyun Jung\n\n2007-06-01\n\nEstuarine waters are generally more turbid than lakes or marine waters due to greater algal mass and continual re-suspension of sediments. The varying effects of diurnal and seasonal prevailing winds on the turbidity condition of a wind-dominated estuary were investigated by spatial and statistical analyses of wind direction, water level, turbidity, chlorophyll a, and PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) collected in Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, USA. The prolonged prevailing winds were responsible for the long-term, large-scale turbidity pattern of the estuary, whereas the short-term changes in wind direction had differential effects on turbidity and water level in varying locations. There were temporal and spatial changes in the relationship between vertical light attenuation coefficient (Kd) and turbidity, which indicate difference in phytoplankton and color also affect Kd. This study demonstrates that the effect of wind on turbidity and water level on different shores can be identified through system-specific analyses of turbidity patterns.\n\nEffects of Prevailing Winds on Turbidity of a Shallow Estuary\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCho, Hyun Jung\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEstuarine waters are generally more turbid than lakes or marine waters due to greater algal mass and continual re-suspension of sediments.

PMID:17617683\n\nA note on the comparative turbidity of some estuaries of the Americas\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nUncles, R.J.; Smith, R.E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nField data from 27 estuaries of the Americas are used to show that, in broad terms, there is a large difference in turbidity between the analyzed east and west-coast estuaries and that tidal range and tidal length have an important influence on that turbidity. Generic, numerical sediment-transport modeling is used to illustrate this influence, which exists over a range of space scales from, e.g., the Rogue River Estuary (few km, few mg l-1) to the Bay of Fundy (hundreds of km, few g l-1). The difference in Pacific and Atlantic seaboard estuarine turbidity for the analyzed estuaries is ultimately related to the broad-scale geomorphology of the two continents.\n\nSeasonal variability of salinity, temperature, turbidity and suspended chlorophyll in the Tweed Estuary.\n\nPubMed\n\nUncles, R J; Bloomer, N J; Frickers, P E; Griffiths, M L; Harris, C; Howland, R J; Morris, A W; Plummer, D H; Tappin, A D\n\n2000-05-05\n\nResults are presented from a campaign of measurements that were undertaken to examine seasonal variability in physical and chemical fluxes and processes within the Tweed Estuary during the period September 1996-August 1997. The study utilised monthly surveys, each of approximately 1 week duration. This article interprets a subset of the salinity, temperature, turbidity [suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels] and chlorophyll a data. Measurements discussed here were obtained throughout the estuary during high-speed transects that covered the region between the tidal river and the coastal zone. Longitudinal distributions of surface salinity depended strongly on freshwater runoff. During high runoff the surface salinity was low and the freshwater-saltwater interface (FSI) was located close to the mouth. The reverse was true at times of low runoff. Salinity stratification was generally strong. During the surveys, river runoff temperatures ranged from approximately 2 to 18 degrees C and coastal waters (approximately 33 salinity) from approximately 6 to 15 degrees C. Turbidity was low throughout the campaign (SPM < 30 mg l(-1)). Because of rapid flushing times (one or two tides), turbidity tended to mix conservatively between river and coastal waters. Higher coastal turbidity was associated with stronger wind events, and higher fluvial turbidity with spate events. Suspended chlorophyll a levels were usually low throughout the estuary (typically < 2 microg l(-1)) and showed large spatial variability. Because of the rapid flushing of the estuary, it is hypothesised that it was not possible for several algal cell divisions to occur before algae were flushed to the coastal zone. A 'bloom' occurred during the May 1997 survey, when chlorophyll a levels reached 14 microg l(-1). Higher chlorophyll a concentrations at that time occurred at very low salinities, indicating that these waters and algae were largely fluvially derived, and may have resulted from increasing\n\nPhytoplankton bloom dynamics in temperate, turbid, stressed estuaries: a model study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Swart, Huib E.; Liu, Bo; de Jonge, Victor\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTo gain insight into mechanisms underlying phytoplankton bloom dynamics in temperature, turbid estuaries, experiments were conducted with an idealised model that couples physical and biological processes. Results show that the model is capable of producing the main features of the observed blooms in the Ems estuary (Northwest Germany), viz. in the lower reach a spring bloom occur, which is followed by a secondary bloom in autumn. The along-estuary distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and the along-estuary distance between the nutrient source and the seaward bound of the turbidity zone control both the along-estuary locations and intensities of the blooms. Results of further sensitivity studies reveal that in a shallow, well-mixed estuary, under temporally-constant suspended sediment conditions, the seasonally-varying water temperature has larger impact on the timing of spring blooms than the seasonally-varying incident light intensity. The occurrence of the secondary bloom is caused by the fact that the growth rate of phytoplankton attains a maximum at an optimum water temperature. Bloom intensities are also modulated by the advective processes related to subtidal current because the latter regulates the seaward transport of nutrient from riverine source. Large-scale deepening of navigation channels leads to later spring blooms due to increased mixing depth. Finally, phytoplankton blooms are unlikely to occur in the upper reach due to the elevated SSC and the landward expansion of turbidity zone related to large-scale deepening.\n\nNutrient variability and its influence on nitrogen processes in a highly turbid tropical estuary (Bangpakong, Gulf of Thailand).\n\nPubMed\n\nBordalo, Adriano A; Chalermwat, Kashane; Teixeira, Catarina\n\n2016-07-01\n\nEstuarine ecosystems in SE Asia have been poorly studied when compared to other tropical environments. Important gaps exist particularly in the understanding of their biogeochemical function and contribution to global change. In this work we looked into N-turnover in the water column and sediments of the Bangpakong estuary (13Â°N). A seasonal sampling program was performed along the salinity gradient covering different stretches of the estuary (68km). Key physical and chemical characteristics were also monitored in order to unravel possible environmental controls. Results showed the occurrence of active denitrification in sediments (5.7-50.9nmol N-N2/(cm(3)Â·hr)), and water column (3.5-1044pmol N-N2/(cm(3)Â·hr)). No seasonal or spatial variability was detected for denitrification potential in sediment samples. However, in the water column, the denitrification activity peaked during the transition season in the downstream sites coinciding with high turbidity levels. Therefore, in that period of the year, the water column compartment may be an important contributor to nitrate reduction within the estuary. The rather low nitrification rates detected were not always measurable, probably due to the reduced oxygen content and high siltation. This study is one of the few dealing simultaneously with sediments and water column processes in a highly turbid tropical estuary. Therefore, it emerges as a valuable contribution for the understanding of the dynamics of the nitrogen cycle in tropical environments by exploring the role of estuarine N microbial activity in reducing the effects of increased nitrogen loads.

Based on the fact that the absorption coefficient of sea water aw(Î») is generally much larger than those of the other constituents aiop(Î») at the NIR wavelengths in coastal and inland waters, an NIR-based bbp(Î») algorithm for turbid coastal and inland waters has been developed and used in this study. This algorithm can be safely used for highly turbid waters with nLw(745) and nLw(862) < Ë6 and Ë4 mW cm-2 Î¼m-1 sr-1, respectively. Seasonal and interannual variations of bbp(Î») in China's east coastal region, the Amazon River Estuary, the La Plata River Estuary, the Meghna River Estuary, the Atchafalaya River Estuary, and Lake Taihu are characterized and quantified. The coefficient bbp(Î») can reach over Ë3-4 m-1 in the Amazon River Estuary and China's east coastal region. The Amazon River Estuary is identified as the most turbid region in the global ocean in terms of bbp(Î») magnitude. bbp(Î») spectra in these five highly turbid regions are also seasonal-dependent and regional-dependent. In the highly turbid waters of China's east coastal region and the Amazon River Estuary, bbp(Î») generally increases in wavelength from 410 to 862 nm, while it decreases in the La Plata River Estuary and Atchafalaya River Estuary. This is attributed to the different particle size distributions in these waters. The geophysical implication of the bbp(Î») spectral curvatures for different waters is discussed. To improve global bbp(Î») for both open oceans and coastal turbid waters, a new combined NIR-based and Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA)-based bbp(Î») algorithm is proposed and demonstrated.\n\nTurbidity as a control on phytoplankton biomass and productivity in estuaries\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCloern, J.E.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn many coastal plain estuaries light attenuation by suspended sediments confines the photic zone to a small fraction of the water column, such that light limitation is a major control on phytoplankon production and turnover rate. For a variety of estuarine systems (e.g. San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound, Delaware Bay, Hudson River plume), photic-zone productivity can be estimated as a function of phytoplankton biomass times mean irradiance of the photic zone. Net water column productivity also varies with light availability, and in San Francisco Bay net productivity is zero (estimated respiratory loss of phytoplankton balances photosynthesis) when the ratio of photic depth (Zp) to mixed depth (Zm) is less than about 0.2. Thus whenever Zp:Zm < 0.2, the water column is a sink for phytoplankton production. Much of the spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton biomass or productivity in estuaries is explained by variations in the ratio of photic depth to mixed depth. For example, phytoplankton blooms often coincide with stratification events that reduce the depth of the surface mixed layer (increase Zp:Zm). Shallow estuarine embayments (high Zp:Zm) are often characterized by high phytoplankton biomass relative to adjacent channels (low Zp:Zm). Many estuaries have longitudinal gradients in productivity that mirror the distribution of suspended sediments: productivity is low near the riverine source of sediments (low Zp:Zm) and increases toward the estuary mouth where turbidity decreases. Some of these generalizations are qualitative in nature, and detailed understanding of the interaction between turbidity and estuarine phytoplankton dynamics requires improved understanding of vertical mixing rates and phytoplankton respiration. ?? 1987.\n\nCharacterization of turbidity in Florida's Lake Okeechobee and Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries using MODIS-Aqua measurements.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Menghua; Nim, Carl J; Son, Seunghyun; Shi, Wei\n\n2012-10-15\n\nThis paper describes the use of ocean color remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to characterize turbidity in Lake Okeechobee and its primary drainage basins, the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries from 2002 to 2010. Drainage modification and agricultural development in southern Florida transport sediments and nutrients from watershed agricultural areas to Lake Okeechobee. As a result of development around Lake Okeechobee and the estuaries that are connected to Lake Okeechobee, estuarine conditions have also been adversely impacted, resulting in salinity and nutrient fluctuations. The measurement of water turbidity in lacustrine and estuarine ecosystems allows researchers to understand important factors such as light limitation and the potential release of nutrients from re-suspended sediments. Based on a strong correlation between water turbidity and normalized water-leaving radiance at the near-infrared (NIR) band (nL(w)(869)), a new satellite water turbidity algorithm has been developed for Lake Okeechobee. This study has shown important applications with satellite-measured nL(w)(869) data for water quality monitoring and measurements for turbid inland lakes. MODIS-Aqua-measured water property data are derived using the shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction algorithm in order to remotely obtain synoptic turbidity data in Lake Okeechobee and normalized water-leaving radiance using the red band (nL(w)(645)) in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries. We found varied, but distinct seasonal, spatial, and event driven turbidity trends in Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuary regions. Wind waves and hurricanes have the largest influence on turbidity trends in Lake Okeechobee, while tides, currents, wind waves, and hurricanes influence the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuarine areas.

Four fixed platforms equipped with turbidity sensors calibrated to give the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration provided continuous information in the upper estuary. Full resolution data recorded by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms provided information in the central and lower estuary twice a day (depending on cloud cover). Field data were used to validate a recently developed SPM quantification algorithm applied to the MODIS 'surface reflectance' product. The algorithm is based on a relationship between the SPM concentration and a reflectance ratio of MODIS bands 2 (near-infrared) and 1 (red). Based on 62 and 75 match-ups identified in 2005 with MODIS Terra and Aqua data, the relative uncertainty of the algorithm applied to these sensors was found to be 22 and 18%, respectively. Field measurements showed the tidal variations of turbidity in the upper estuary, while monthly-averaged MODIS satellite data complemented by field data allowed observing the monthly movements of the TM in the whole estuary. The trapping of fine sediments occurred in the upper estuary during the period of low river flow. This resulted in the formation of a highly concentrated TM during a 4-month period. With increasing river flow, the TM moved rapidly to the central estuary. A part of the TM detached, moved progressively in the lower estuary and was finally either massively exported to the ocean during peak floods or temporary trapped (settled) on intertidal mudflats. The massive export to the ocean was apparently the result of combined favorable environmental conditions: presence of fluid mud near the mouth, high river flow, high tides and limited wind speeds. The mean SPM concentration\n\nDynamics of coarse particulate matter in the turbidity maximum zone of the Gironde Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFuentes-Cid, Ana; Etcheber, Henri; Schmidt, Sabine; Abril, GwenaÃ«l; De-Oliveira, Eric; Lepage, Mario; Sottolichio, Aldo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThere is a lack of studies devoted to coarse particulate matter (CPM) in estuaries, although this fraction can disturb activities that filter large volumes of water, such as industrial or fishery activities. In the macrotidal and highly-turbid Gironde Estuary, a monthly sampling of CPM was performed in 2011 and 2013 at two stations in the Turbidity Maximum Zone (TMZ) to understand its seasonal, tidal and hydrological dynamics. Regardless of the season and station, low quantities of CPM (few g m-3) were observed in comparison with suspended particulate matter (several 103 g m-3). The highest concentrations were consistently recorded in bottom waters and at the upstream station. Whereas there is no clear link between the CPM present in the column water and spring or neap tides, an increase in the CPM size has been identified at the two stations after a flood event, fact potentially critical regarding filtering functioning of estuarine activities.\n\nOrganic matter exploitation in a highly turbid environment: Planktonic food web in the Charente estuary, France\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nModÃ©ran, Julien; David, ValÃ©rie; Bouvais, Pierre; Richard, Pierre; Fichet, Denis\n\n2012-02-01\n\nEstuaries are highly dynamic systems where multiple organic matter sources coexist and where complex biogeochemical processes greatly affect their fate. Although zooplankton plays a key role of in the energy fluxes between primary sources and exploited macrofauna, there is still a critical lack of field information concerning the spatio-temporal variability of the trophic pathways supporting its high biomasses in estuaries. From January 2007 to January 2008, suspended matter, microphytobenthos and zooplankton were sampled along the salinity gradient of the Charente estuary to determine their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition. The relative homogeneity of the Î´ 13C values of particulate organic matter (POM) all along the estuary (-23.6 to -26.5â° except in March and June, Ë -28.5â°) was attributed to physical mixing of marine and terrestrially derived organic matter with the great load of tidally resuspended particles. The five zooplankton taxa analysed displayed a wide range of Î´ 13C (from -34.9 to -17.4â°) and Î´ 15N values (3.4-15.2â°) over the year, providing strong evidence for high selectivity toward different organic matter sources and reinforcing the idea that a spatio-temporal succession of species assemblages lead to multiple trophic pathways and may stabilize the estuarine trophic network. The high Î´ 15N values of Eurytemora affinis in the maximum turbidity zone were believed to reflect a higher carnivorous tendency as a functional response to the strong decrease of phytoplankton availability. Conversely, Acartia spp. appeared unable to change their diet in the same way and was thus unable to colonize upstream areas. Stable isotope analysis also revealed that Mesopodopsis slabberi mostly relied on fresh phytoplankton and microphytobenthos while Neomysis integer presented a clear carnivorous tendency toward copepods, at least during the warm period. Additionally evidence was provided for passive (downstream advection of freshwater\n\nThe Impact of High-Turbidity Water's Seasonal and Decadal Variations on Offshore Phytoplankton and Nutrients Dynamics around The Changjiang Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGe, J.; Torres, R.; Chen, C.; Bellerby, R. G. J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Changjiang Estuary is characterized as strong river discharge into the inner shelf of the East China Sea with abundant sediment load, producing significant high-turbidity water coverage from river mouth to deep region. The growth of offshore phytoplankton is dynamically controlled by river flushed low-salinity and high-turbidity water, and salter water from inner shelf of East China Sea. During last decade, the sediment and nutrients from the Changjiang River has significantly changed, which lead to the variation of offshore phytoplankton dynamics. The variations of sediment, nutrients, and their influenced phytoplankton has been simulated through a comprehensive modeling system, which integrated a multi-scale current-wave-sediment FVCOM model and generic marine biogeochemistry and ecosystem ERSEM model through The Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM). This model system has successfully revealed the seasonal and decadal variations of sediment, nutrients transport around the inner shelf of the East China Sea. The spring and autumn peaks of phytoplankton growth were correctly captured by simulation. The modeling results, as well as MODIS and GOCI remote sensing, shows a strong sediment decreasing from northern to southern region, which creates different patterns of Chlorophyll-a distribution and seasonal variations. These results indicate the high-turbidity water in northern region strongly influenced the light attenuation in the water column and limits the phytoplankton growth in this relatively higher-nutrient area, especially in the wintertime. The relatively low-turbidity southern region has significant productivity of phytoplankton, even during low-temperature winter. The phytoplankton growth increased in the northern region from 2005 to 2010, with the increase of the nutrient load during this period. Then it became a decreasing trend after 2010.\n\nThe dependence of estuarine turbidity on tidal intrusion length, tidal range and residence time\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nUncles, R.J.; Stephens, J.A.; Smith, R.E.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIt is shown that there is a marked tendency for long, strongly tidal estuaries to have greater suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations within their high-turbidity regions than shorter estuaries with comparable tidal ranges at their mouths, or weakly tidal estuaries. Using consistently derived data from 44 estuaries in Europe and the Americas, contours of the logarithm of maximum estuarine SPM concentration are shown to be reasonably smooth when plotted against the logarithm of mean spring tidal range (at the estuary mouth) and the logarithm of estuarine tidal length. Predictions from the plot are compared with published observations made in the Delaware, Scheldt, Rio de la Plata, Gironde, Bay of Fundy, Changjiang (Yangtze), Amazon, Paros Lagoon and the Hawkesbury Estuary and it is shown that, qualitatively, there are no serious discrepancies. Short, weakly tidal estuaries are predicted to have very low 'intrinsic' SPM concentrations. High SPM concentrations in these estuaries would most likely be the result of either locally generated wave resuspension, high freshwater sediment loads due to freshets, or intruding seawater carrying suspended sediments derived from wave activity in the coastal zone. Application of a generic tidal model demonstrates that longer estuaries possess faster tidal currents for a given tidal range at their mouth and, in the presence of a supply of erodable fine sediment, therefore (by implication) produce greater concentrations of SPM that can be accumulated within a turbidity maximum. The same is true if the tidal range is increased for estuaries of a given length. These features are illustrated by comparing surveys of SPM data from two large estuaries possessing greatly different tidal ranges (the microtidal, medium turbidity Potomac and the macrotidal, highly turbid Humber-Ouse) and a third, much smaller but strongly tidal estuary (the low-turbidity Tweed). It is demonstrated that longer estuaries tend to have longer flushing\n\nThe dependence of estuarine turbidity on tidal intrusion length, tidal range and residence time\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nUncles, R.J.; Stephens, J.A.; Smith, R.E.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIt is shown that there is a marked tendency for long, strongly tidal estuaries to have greater suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations within their high-turbidity regions than shorter estuaries with comparable tidal ranges at their mouths, or weakly tidal estuaries.

Based on the measurements of two large-scale field surveys conducted in the wet season of 1978 (July of 1978) and the dry season of 1979 (March of 1979), the existence and seasonal variations of TM in the PRE focusing on the two major natural navigation channels have been studied. The sediment transport fluxes over two consecutive tidal cycles have been analyzed in detail. The analysis results reveal that the formation mechanisms of TM in the estuary are rather complex. In general, gravitational circulation, tidal trapping, and sediment resuspension and deposition processes are the primary TM formation mechanisms in the PRE. The clockwise back flow pattern around Lingding Island also leads to the formation of TM in the West channel of the PRE. The occurrence of TM far upstream of the salt water wedge is the result of the complex hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes generated by the runoff of the major rivers.\n\nUsing turbidity and acoustic backscatter intensity as surrogate measures of suspended sediment concentration in a small subtropical estuary.\n\nPubMed\n\nChanson, Hubert; Takeuchi, Maiko; Trevethan, Mark\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe suspended sediment concentration is a key element in stream monitoring, although the turbidity and acoustic Doppler backscattering may be suitable surrogate measures. Herein a series of new experiments were conducted in laboratory under controlled conditions using water and mud samples collected in a small subtropical estuary of Eastern Australia. The relationship between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity exhibited a linear relationship, while the relationships between suspended sediment concentration and acoustic backscatter intensity showed a monotonic increase. The calibration curves were affected by both sediment material characteristics and water quality properties, implying that the calibration of an acoustic Doppler system must be performed with the waters and soil materials of the natural system. The results were applied to some field studies in the estuary during which the acoustic Doppler velocimeter was sampled continuously at high frequency. The data yielded the instantaneous suspended sediment flux per unit area in the estuarine zone. They showed some significant fluctuations in instantaneous suspended mass flux, with a net upstream-suspended mass flux during flood tide and net downstream sediment flux during ebb tide. For each tidal cycle, the integration of the suspended sediment flux per unit area data with respect of time yielded some net upstream sediment flux in average.\n\nTrapping effect of estuarine turbidity maximum on particulate organic carbon and its response to a typhoon event in a macro-tidal estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Aijun; Ye, Xiang; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Liang\n\n2017-04-01\n\nEstuaries are key nodes of land-ocean interaction, the associated suspended sediment processes being crucial for global and regional material fluxes and environmental health. Within estuaries, there is commonly a reach where the water turbidity is markedly higher than both landward and seaward. This elevated suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is termed the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM). The ETM has important influences on harbor siltation, ecological conservation, and biogeochemical dynamics. Jiulongjiang estuary is a small macro-tidal estuary in southeast China coastal area, which is a typical example for estuarine ecosystem conservation and its response to catchment management. Observed results show that the tidal current is the main factor which control the variations of SSC in ETM under the normal condition. However, under the influence of typhoon event, the hydrodynamic action was strengthened and the salt water intrusion was also enhanced, and the fresh water and sediment discharged from river system increased, which led to the complicated variations of the ETM. Under the normal conditions, the maximum width of ETM was about 10 km in spring tide. However, before typhoon landed, the maximum width of the ETM was about 14 km; after the typhoon landed, the maximum width of the ETM was more than 20 km, and during the low tide stage, the width of the ETM was still 19 km which was induced by high turbidity water input from river system. The particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration reached 19.26 mg/L within the ETM at the next day after typhoon landed, which was much higher than that under normal weather condition (the maximum value was only 3.15 mg/L). During the low tide level, the POC concentration increased remarkably from upstream to the core of ETM and then decreased toward downstream, while the POC concentration decreased toward downstream during high tide level. Compared with normal weather condition, the POC concentration varied not obviously\n\nRelationship between nutrients and plankton biomass in the turbidity maximum zone of the Pearl River Estuary.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Zhen; Xu, Jie; Huang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Xia; Jiang, Zhijian; Ye, Feng; Liang, Ximei\n\n2017-07-01\n\nNutrients, dissolved and particulate organic carbon and plankton (bacterio-, phyto- and zoo-) were compared in the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) and adjacent areas (non-TMZ) in the Pearl River estuary. Our results showed that high levels of suspended substances had marked effect on dynamics of nutrients and plankton in the TMZ. Based on the cluster analysis of total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, all stations were divided into two groups, TMZ with average TSS of 171mg/L and non-TMZ of 45mg/L. Suspended substances adsorbed PO 4 3- and dissolved organic carbon, resulting in higher particulate phosphorus and organic carbon (POC) and lower PO 4 3- and DOC in the TMZ, compared to the non-TMZ. However, suspended substances had limited effect on nitrogenous nutrients. Phytoplankton growth was light-limited due to high concentrations of suspended substances in the TMZ and a peak of phytoplankton abundance appeared in the non-TMZ. In contrast, the highest bacterial abundance occurred in the TMZ, which was likely partly responsible for low DOC levels. Two peaks of zooplankton abundance observed in the TMZ and non-TMZ in the Pearl River estuary were primarily supported by bacteria and phytoplankton, respectively. Our finding implied that high levels of suspended solids in the TMZ affect the trophic balance. Copyright Â© 2016.

L.; Francis, C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nNitrification is the link between reduced and oxidized forms of inorganic nitrogen, and is therefore a crucial step in the estuarine nitrogen cycle. Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms catalyze the rate-limiting step of ammonia oxidation to nitrite and thus play key roles in the biogeochemical cycling nutrient-rich estuaries. Yet, few studies have measured nitrification rates in tandem with ammonia oxidizer functional gene (amoA) expression, abundance, and diversity in estuary waters. Here, we present a multi-year data set on the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of nitrification in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, the largest estuary on the North American west coast, collected throughout all regions of the estuary from 2012 to 2014. Data on microbial community distributions use functional gene-based PCR assays to assess the diversity, abundance, and mRNA expression of ammonia oxidizers, while stable isotope tracer experiments were used to measure nitrification rates. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) typically outnumbered ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) throughout the sampled gradient, though the relative abundance of AOB was often greater in brackish regions. mRNA expression of amoA appeared to largely track DNA abundance, but suggested only a fraction of the ammonia-oxidizing community was typically active. AOA were always numerically dominant in the Sacramento River, where average nitrification rates were highest, suggesting the AOA communities in this river are responsible for a relatively constant nitrification hotspot. Additionally, depth profiles of nitrification rates suggested high biogeochemical activity near the sediment-water interface in samples with abnormally high turbidity, indicating similar but transient nitrification hotspots in bottom waters containing resuspended sediments. This work increases our knowledge of the ecology and dynamics of ammonia oxidizers in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, with time series data allowing for the putative\n\nA study of in-situ sediment flocculation in the turbidity maxima of the Yangtze Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuo, Chao; He, Qing; Guo, Leicheng; Winterwerp, Johan C.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn order to improve our understandings of temporal and vertical variations of sediment flocculation dynamics within the turbidity maxima (TM) of the highly turbid Yangtze Estuary (YE), we deployed LISST-100C, a laser instrument for in-situ monitor of the sizes and concentrations of flocculated particles in a wet season. Field data in terms of vertical profiles of flow velocity, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), salinity, flocculated particle size distribution and volume concentration were obtained, based on field works conducted at consecutive spring, moderate, and neap tides. Data analyses show that the mean floc diameters (DM) were in the range of 14-95 Î¼m, and flocculation exhibited strong temporal and vertical variations within a tidal cycle and between spring-neap cycles. Larger DM were observed during high and low slack waters, and the averaged floc size at neap tide was found 57% larger than at spring tide. Effective density of flocs decreased with the increase of floc size, and fractal dimension of flocs in the YE was mainly between 1.5 and 2.1. We also estimated the settling velocity of flocs by 0.04-0.6 mm s-1 and the largest settling velocity occurred also at slack waters. Moreover, it is found that turbulence plays a dominant role in the flocculation process. Floc size decreases significantly when the shear rate parameter G is > 2-3 s-1, suggesting the turbulence breaking force. Combined effects of fine sediment flocculation, enhanced settling process, and high sediment concentration resulted in a large settling flux around high water, which can in part explain the severe siltation in the TM of the YE, thus shedding lights on the navigation channel management.\n\nSuspended-Sediment Impacts on Light-limited Productivity in the Delaware Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcSweeney, J.; Chant, R. J.; Wilkin, J.; Sommerfield, C. K.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Delaware Estuary has a history of high anthropogenic nutrient loadings, but has been classified as a high-nutrient, low-growth system due persistent light limitations caused by turbidity. While the biogeochemical implications of light limitation in turbid estuaries has been well-studied, there has been minimal effort focused on the connectivity between hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, and light-limitation. Our understanding of sediment dynamics in the Delaware Estuary has advanced significantly in the last decade, and this study provides insight about how the spatiotemporal variability of the estuarine turbidity maximum controls the light available for primary productivity. This analysis uses data from eight along-estuary cruises from March, June, September, and December 2010 and 2011 to look at the seasonality of suspended sediment and chlorophyll distributions. By estimating the absorption due to sediment under a range of environmental conditions, we describe how the movement of the turbidity maximum affects light availability. We also use an idealized 2-dimensional Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) numerical model to evaluate how river discharge and spring-neap variability modulate the location of phytoplankton blooms. We conclude that high river flows and neap tides can drive stratification that is strong enough to prevent sediment from being resuspended into the surface layer, thus providing light conditions favorable for primary productivity. This study sheds light on the importance of sediment in the limiting primary productivity, and the role of stratification in promoting production, highlighting the potential limitations of biogeochemical models that do not account for sediment absorption.\n\nTidal variations of flow convergence, shear, and stratification at the Rio de la Plata estuary turbidity front\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFramiÃ±An, Mariana B.; Valle-Levinson, Arnoldo; SepÃºlveda, HÃ©Ctor H.; Brown, Otis B.\n\n2008-08-01\n\nIntratidal variability of density and velocity fields is investigated at the turbidity front of the RÃ­o de la Plata Estuary, South America. Current velocity and temperature-salinity profiles collected in August 1999 along a repeated transect crossing the front are analyzed. Horizontal and vertical gradients, stability of the front, convergence zones, and transverse flow associated to the frontal boundary are described. Strong horizontal convergence of the across-front velocity and build up of along-front velocity shear were observed at the front. In the proximity of the front, enhanced transverse (or along-front) flow created jet-like structures at the surface and near the bottom flowing in opposite directions. These structures persisted throughout the tidal cycle and were advected upstream (downstream) by the flood (ebb) current through a distance of Ë10 km. During peak flood, the upper layer flow reversed from its predominant downstream direction and upstreamflow occupied the entire water column; outside the peak flood, two-layer estuarine circulation dominated. Changes in density field were observed in response to tidal straining, tidal advection, and wind-induced mixing, but stratification remained throughout the tidal cycle. This work demonstrates the large spatial variability of the velocity field at the turbidity front; it provides evidence of enhanced transverse circulation along the frontal boundary; and reveals the importance of advective and frictional intratidal processes in the dynamics of the central part of the estuary.\n\nCoupled effects of vertical mixing and benthic grazing on phytoplankton populations in shallow, turbid estuaries\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nKoseff, Jeffrey R.; Holen, Jacqueline K.; Monismith, Stephen G.; Cloern, James E.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nCoastal ocean waters tend to have very different patterns of phytoplankton biomass variability from the open ocean, and the connections between physical variability and phytoplankton bloom dynamics are less well established for these shallow systems. Predictions of biological responses to physical variability in these environments is inherently difficult because the recurrent seasonal patterns of mixing are complicated by aperiodic fluctuations in river discharge and the high-frequency components of tidal variability. We might expect, then, less predictable and more complex bloom dynamics in these shallow coastal systems compared with the open ocean. Given this complex and dynamic physical environment, can we develop a quantitative framework to define the physical regimes necessary for bloom inception, and can we identify the important mechanisms of physical-biological coupling that lead to the initiation and termination of blooms in estuaries and shallow coastal waters? Numerical modeling provides one approach to address these questions. Here we present results of simulation experiments with a refined version of Cloern's (1991) model in which mixing processes are treated more realistically to reflect the dynamic nature of turbulence generation in estuaries. We investigated several simple models for the turbulent mixing coefficient. We found that the addition of diurnal tidal variation to Cloern's model greatly reduces biomass growth indicating that variations of mixing on the time scale of hours are crucial. Furthermore, we found that for conditions representative of South San Francisco Bay, numerical simulations only allowed for bloom development when the water column was stratified and when minimal mixing was prescribed in the upper layer. Stratification, however, itself isÂ notÂ sufficient to ensure that a bloom will develop: minimal wind stirring is a further prerequisite to bloom development in shallow turbid estuaries with abundant populations of benthic\n\nCan phytoplankton maintain a positive carbon balance in a turbid, freshwater, tidal estuary\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCole, J.J.; Caraco, N.F.; Peierls, B.L.\n\n1992-12-01\n\nAn analysis of phytoplankton primary production in the tidal freshwater portion of the Hudson River estuary suggests that net primary production is strongly limited by light and mixing regime.

Autotrophic dark respiration, conservatively estimated at 5% of P[sup b][sub max], is of sufficient magnitude to make positive algal growth impossible over much of the river and much of the year.

M.; van Maren, Dirk S.; Schrottke, Kerstin; BorgsmÃ¼ller, Christine; SchÃ¶l, Andreas\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn this paper, we analyse the behaviour of fine sediments in the hyper-turbid Lower Ems River, with focus on the river's upper reaches, a stretch of about 25 km up-estuary of Terborg. Our analysis is based on long records of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from optical backscatter (OBS) measurements close to the bed at seven stations along the river, records of salinity and water level measurements at these stations, acoustic measurements on the vertical mud structure just up-estuary of Terborg and oxygen profiles in the lower 3 m of the water column close to Leerort and Terborg. Further, we use cross-sectionally averaged velocities computed with a calibrated numerical model. Distinction is made between four timescales, i.e. the semi-diurnal tidal timescale, the spring-neap tidal timescale, a timescale around an isolated peak in river flow (i.e. about 3 weeks) and a seasonal timescale. The data suggest that a pool of fluid/soft mud is present in these upper reaches, from up-estuary of Papenburg to a bit down-estuary of Terborg. Between Terborg and Gandersum, SPM values drop rapidly but remain high at a few gram per litre. The pool of fluid/soft mud is entrained/mobilized at the onset of flood, yielding SPM values of many tens gram per litre. This suspension is transported up-estuary with the flood. Around high water slack, part of the suspension settles, being remixed during ebb, while migrating down-estuary, but likely not much further than Terborg. Around low water slack, a large fraction of the sediment settles, reforming the pool of fluid mud. The rapid entrainment from the fluid mud layer after low water slack is only possible when the peak flood velocity exceeds a critical value of around 1 m/s, i.e. when the stratified water column seems to become internally supercritical. If the peak flood velocity does not reach this critical value, f.i. during neap tide, fluid mud is not entrained up to the OBS sensors. Thus, it is not classical tidal asymmetry, but\n\nSediment source, turbidity maximum, and implications for mud exchange between channel and mangroves in an Amazonian estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAsp, Nils Edvin; Gomes, Vando JosÃ© Costa; Ogston, Andrea; Borges, JosÃ© Carlos CorrÃªa; Nittrouer, Charles Albert\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe tide-dominated eastern sector of the Brazilian Amazonian coast includes large mangrove areas and several estuaries, including the estuary associated with the UrumajÃ³ River. There, the dynamics of suspended sediments and delivery mechanisms for mud to the tidal flats and mangroves are complex and were investigated in this study. Four longitudinal measuring campaigns were carried out, encompassing spring/neap tides and dry/rainy seasons. During spring tides, water levels were measured simultaneously at 5 points along the estuary. Currents, salinity, and suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) were measured over the tidal cycle in a cross section at the middle sector of the estuary. Results show a marked turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) during the rainy season, with a 4-km upstream displacement from neap to spring tide. During dry season, the TMZ was conspicuous only during neap tide and dislocated about 5 km upstream and was substantially less apparent in comparison to that observed during rainy season. The results show that mud is being concentrated in the channel associated with the TMZ especially during the rainy season. At this time, a substantial amount of the mud is washed out from mangroves to the estuarine channel and hydrodynamic/salinity conditions for TMZ formation are optimal. As expected, transport to the mangrove flats is most effective during spring tide and substantially reduced at neap tide, when mangroves are not being flooded. During the dry season, mud is resuspended from the bed in the TMZ sector and is a source of sediment delivered to the tidal flats and mangroves. The seasonal variation of the sediments on the seabed is in agreement with the variation of suspended sediments as well.\n\nAnalysis of Suspended-Sediment Dynamics in Gulf of Mexico Estuaries Using MODIS/Terra 250-m Imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcCarthy, M.

R.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nSuspended sediments in coastal ecosystems reduce light penetration, degrade water quality, and inhibit primary production. In this study, a 15-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra) turbidity time-series was developed for use in the estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) at 645 nm and 250-m resolution was validated with in-situ turbidity measurements in these estuaries: Coastal Bend Bays (TX), Galveston Bay (TX), Barataria and Terrebonne Bays (LA), Mobile Bay (AL), Tampa Bay (FL), Sarasota Bay (FL), and Charlotte Harbor (FL). Mean values of turbidity over the time-series ranged from 2.5 NTU to over 10 NTU. Turbidity patterns exhibited seasonal cycles with peak values generally found during spring months, although there is considerable variability in the timing of peak turbidity. Episodes of elevated turbidity ranged from 6 episodes in Galveston Bay to 15 in Mobile Bay. The spatial extent of elevated turbidity within estuaries, frequency and duration of turbidity events, and potential driving factors behind episodes of elevated turbidity were also examined.\n\nVertical and Tidal Variability of the Floc Size Distribution in a Partially Mixed, Low Turbidity, Anthropogenically Altered Geum River Estuary, Korea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, G. H.; Figueroa, S. M.; Shin, H. J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAfter the construction of the Geum River Estuary dam in 1994, current velocities and water turbidity decreased while the rate of mud deposition doubled, causing the water to become increasingly shallower. To better understand the sediment transport processes in the estuary, profiles of current speed, salinity, and the in-situ floc size distribution were measured during the wet season over three spring tidal cycles in the inner estuary. Although the primary particle size distribution (PPSD) was bimodal clay and coarse silt, the in-situ floc size distribution was observed to be unimodal during conditions promoting flocculation, with a mode (400 um) almost an order of magnitude larger than the coarse silt mode of the PPSD. Sediment resuspension and deflocculation were observed throughout the water column during flood while rapid flocculation and settling were observed in the surface water during calmer slack tides. During ebb, a halocline developed due to tidal straining which trapped macroflocs and created a mid-depth maximum in median floc size. These observations imply periodic stratification is important for floc dynamics even during spring tides and suggests that asymmetry in flocculation during the short term (tidal cycle) could be an important factor in the long term sediment deposition in Geum River Estuary.\n\nTowards a long-term chlorophyll-a data record in a turbid estuary using MODIS observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe, Chengfeng; Hu, Chuanmin; English, David; Cannizzaro, Jennifer; Chen, Zhiqiang; Feng, Lian; Boler, Richard; Kovach, Charles\n\n2013-02-01\n\nDespite recent advances in using satellite data for continuous monitoring of estuarine water quality parameters such as turbidity and water clarity, estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla) has remained problematic due to the optical complexity of estuarine waters and imperfect atmospheric correction. This poses a significant challenge to the community as synoptic and frequent Chla âmeasurementsâ from satellites are in high demand by various government agencies and environmental groups to help make management decisions. Here, using 10 years of in situ and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements from a moderately sized, turbid estuary, Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), we developed and validated a new algorithm specifically designed for retrieving Chla from MODIS data. The algorithm takes the red-to-green remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs(Î»)) band ratio of [Rrs(667) + Rrs(678)]/[Rrs(531) + Rrs(547)] as the independent variable, and estimates Chla through the non-linear regression function: Ln(Chla) = 1.91Ln(x) + 3.40 (R2 = 0.87, N = 97, p < 0.01, 1.5 < Chla < 80 mg m-3) where âx' is the band ratio. Validation of the algorithm using two independent datasets collected by different groups and near-concurrent MODIS measurements showed robust algorithm performance for Chla within this range, with mean relative errors of 25.8% and 41.7% for the two datasets. Time-series analyses at representative stations using both in situ and MODIS Chla also showed general agreement, with instances of noticeable discrepancy attributed to different measurement frequencies. The algorithm was implemented to establish a 10-year Chla data record for Tampa Bay in order to serve as a baseline for monitoring future phytoplankton bloom events. The 10-year Chla data record showed substantial variability in both space and time, with generally higher Chla observed during the wet season and in upper bay segments, and Chla minima observed in all bay segments during May\n\nSedimentation and erosion trends over 50 years in the macrotidal Gironde estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSottolichio, Aldo; Hanquiez, Vincent; Arriagada, Joselyn; Jalon-Rojas, Isabel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nRecent studies have emphasized on the drastic morphodynamic evolution of many european urbanized estuaries, which have become more turbid during the XXth century because of human-induced deepening and narrowing. For some systems, the availability of data has allowed detailed analysis of evolution, while for some other estuaries, knowledge remains limited. For the latter, it is difficult to elucidate any effect due to climate change, extreme events or human activities. Among them, the Gironde estuary is a macrotidal funnel-shape system, the largest estuary of Western Europe, and characterized by high levels of turbidity. Despite numerous investigations on sedimentary processes carried out in this estuary in the past, there is poor knowledge on the evolution of its morphology and tides over the XXth century. Recently, an investigation on tidal patterns has started in the Garonne tidal river, where it is known that gravel extraction during the sixties has deeply modified the mean depth of the channel. In the meantime, there is evidence of a long-term shift of the turbidity maximum in this area, mainly due to a reduction of river flow in the last 40 years. However, for the main estuarine portion, which represents 80% of the total surface, morphology evolution and associated physical processes remain under-investigated. In this study the morphological evolution of the Gironde estuary has been documented and investigated for the first time, based on some bathymetric and tidal data collected from the archives of the port of Bordeaux. Six bathymetric maps covering a period of 50 years, from the 1953 to year 2000 were compared, highlighting areas of accretion and erosion. Results show that the zone of maximum volume of deposited sediment has migrated continuously towards the upstream portion of the estuary, which is coherent with the intensification of the low river flow periods and the upstream shift of the turbidity maximum zone to the riverine sections. In the meantime\n\nNatural forcings on a transformed territory overshoot thresholds of primary productivity in the Guadalquivir estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRuiz, J.; MacÃ­as, D.; Navarro, G.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA three year-long quasi continuum sampling dataset on the Guadalquivir estuary water quality was used to assess the role of light availability on its biological production. We found that inorganic nutrients within the estuary are very high (with mean values for inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous of 285 and 2.4 Î¼M respectively) while phytoplankton biomass remains low most of the time (with a mean value of 2.6 mg/m3). A strong relationship between phytoplankton biomass and water turbidity was found indicating that, indeed, light availability is the major constraint of primary production in this system. Most of the time this limitation of primary production is not associated to enhanced turbidity connected to fresh water inputs. Instead, our data indicate that, independently of freshwater inputs, the photosynthesis is restricted by tidal forcings enhancing turbidity in an estuary that has been highly modified. Our results match with classical theories on the functioning of well-mixed, estuarine ecosystems as well as with recent modeling exercises. We also discuss the potential impacts of this particular characteristic of some estuarine systems for their management and regulatory control.\n\nInfluence of main forcing affecting the Tagus turbid plume under high river discharges using MODIS imagery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ³mez-Gesteira, M.; Mendes, R.; deCastro, M.; Vaz, N.; Dias, J.

This study was performed combining daily images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor located onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. Composites were generated by averaging pixels with the same forcing conditions. River discharge shows a strong relation with the extension of the Tagus plume. The plume grows with the increasing river discharge and express a two day lag caused by the long residence time of water within the estuary. The Tagus turbid plume was found to be smaller under northerly and easterly winds, than under southerly and westerly winds. It is suggested that upwelling favoring winds provoke the offshore movement of the plume material with a rapidly decrease in turbidity values whereas downwelling favoring winds retain plume material in the north coast close to the Tagus mouth. Eastern cross-shore (oceanward) winds spread the plume seaward and to the north following the coast geometry, whereas western cross-shore (landward) winds keep the plume material in both alongshore directions occupying a large part of the area enclosed by the bay. Low tides produce larger and more turbid plumes than high tides. In terms of fortnightly periodicity, the maximum plume extension corresponding to the highest turbidity is observed during and after spring tides.

In the Yangtze River Estuary, the magnitude and extent of the TMZ vary with water discharge. In this study, the cumulative human activity altered the water discharge regime from the river to the estuary. In the post-Three Gorges Dam (TGD) period, water discharge increased by 35.10Â % at Datong in February compared with that in the pre-TGD period. The effects of water discharge variation on the characteristics of the TMZ were analyzed during spring and neap tidal periods using the three-dimensional environmental fluid dynamic code (EFDC) model. The area of the TMZ decreased by 3.11 and 17.39Â % during neap and spring tides, respectively. In addition, the upper limit of the TMZ moved 11.68Â km seaward during neap tide, whereas the upper limit of the TMZ in the upstream and downstream areas moved seaward 9.65 and 2.34Â km, respectively, during spring tide. These findings suggest that the area and location of the TMZ are more sensitive to upstream runoff during spring tide than during neap tide. These changes in the TMZ will impact the biochemical processes in the Yangtze River Estuary. In the foreseeable future, the distribution characteristic of TMZ will inevitably change due to variations in the Yangtze River discharge resulting from new human activities (i.e., new dams), which are being constructed upstream in the Yangtze River system.\n\nImpact of urban effluents on summer hypoxia in the highly turbid Gironde Estuary, applying a 3D model coupling hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemical processes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLajaunie-Salla, Katixa; Wild-Allen, Karen; Sottolichio, Aldo; Thouvenin, BÃ©nÃ©dicte; Litrico, Xavier; Abril, GwenaÃ«l\n\n2017-10-01\n\nEstuaries are increasingly degraded due to coastal urban development and are prone to hypoxia problems. The macro-tidal Gironde Estuary is characterized by a highly concentrated turbidity maximum zone (TMZ). Field observations show that hypoxia occurs in summer in the TMZ at low river flow and a few days after the spring tide peak. In situ data highlight lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations around the city of Bordeaux, located in the upper estuary. Interactions between multiple factors limit the understanding of the processes controlling the dynamics of hypoxia. A 3D biogeochemical model was developed, coupled with hydrodynamics and a sediment transport model, to assess the contribution of the TMZ and the impact of urban effluents through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sewage overflows (SOs) on hypoxia. Our model describes the transport of solutes and suspended material and the biogeochemical mechanisms impacting oxygen: primary production, degradation of all organic matter (i.e. including phytoplankton respiration, degradation of river and urban watershed matter), nitrification and gas exchange. The composition and the degradation rates of each variable were characterized by in situ measurements and experimental data from the study area. The DO model was validated against observations in Bordeaux City. The simulated DO concentrations show good agreement with field observations and satisfactorily reproduce the seasonal and neap-spring time scale variations around the city of Bordeaux. Simulations show a spatial and temporal correlation between the formation of summer hypoxia and the location of the TMZ, with minimum DO centered in the vicinity of Bordeaux. To understand the contribution of the urban watershed forcing, different simulations with the presence or absence of urban effluents were compared. Our results show that in summer, a reduction of POC from SO would increase the DO minimum in the vicinity of Bordeaux by 3% of saturation.

First, satellite-ground synchronous data (n = 850) was collected from 2014 to 2015 using 11 buoys equipped with a Yellow Spring Instrument (YSI) multi-parameter sonde capable of taking hourly turbidity measurements. The GOCI data-derived Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R(rc)) was used in place of the widely used remote sensing reflectance (R(rs)) to model turbidity. Various band characteristics, including single band, band ratio, band subtraction, and selected band combinations, were analyzed to identify correlations with turbidity. The results indicated that band 6 had the closest relationship to turbidity; however, the combined bands 3 and 6 model simulated turbidity most accurately (R(2) = 0.821, p<0.0001), while the model based on band 6 alone performed almost as well (R(2) = 0.749, p<0.0001). An independent validation data set was used to evaluate the performances of both models, and the mean relative error values of 42.5% and 51.2% were obtained for the combined model and the band 6 model, respectively. The accurate performances of the proposed models indicated that the use of R(rc) to model turbidity in highly turbid coastal waters is feasible. As an example, the developed model was applied to 8 hourly GOCI images on 30 December 2014. Three cross sections were selected to identify the spatiotemporal variation of turbidity in the study area. Turbidity generally decreased from near-shore to offshore and from morning to afternoon. Overall, the findings of this study provide a simple and practical method, based on GOCI data, to estimate turbidity in highly turbid coastal waters at high temporal resolutions.\n\nPhysicochemical and biological factors controlling water column metabolism in Sundarbans estuary, India.\n\nPubMed\n\nChaudhuri, Kaberi; Manna, Suman; Sarma, Kakoli Sen; Naskar, Pankaj; Bhattacharyya, Somenath; Bhattacharyya, Maitree\n\n2012-10-19\n\nSundarbans is the single largest deltaic mangrove forest in the world, formed at estuarine phase of the Ganges - Brahmaputra river system.

This system is one of the most important estuarine environments in the continent, being a highly productive area that sustains valuable artisanal and coastal fisheries in Uruguay and Argentina. The main goals of this paper are to summarize recent knowledge on this estuary, integrating physical, chemical and biological studies, and to explore the sources and ecological meaning of estuarine variability associated to the stratification/mixing alternateness in the estuary. We summarized unpublished data and information from several bibliographic sources. From study cases representing different stratification conditions, we draw a holistic view of physical patterns and ecological processes of the stratification/mixing alternateness. This estuary is characterized by strong vertical salinity stratification most of the time (the salt-wedge condition). The head of the estuary is characterized by a well-developed turbidity front. High turbidity constrains their photosynthesis. Immediately offshore the turbidity front, water becomes less turbid and phytoplankton peaks. As a consequence, trophic web in the estuary could be based on two sources of organic matter: phytoplankton and plant detritus. Dense plankton aggregations occur below the halocline and at the tip of the salt wedge. The mysid Neomysis americana, a key prey for juvenile fishes, occurs all along the turbidity front. A similar spatial pattern is shown by one of the most abundant benthic species, the clam Mactra isabelleana. These species could be taken advantage of the particulate organic matter and/or phytoplankton concentrated near the front. Nekton is represented by a rich fish community, with several fishes breeding inside the estuary. The most important species in terms of biomass is Micropogonias furnieri, the main target for the coastal fisheries of Argentina and Uruguay. Two processes have been identified\n\nConsumption processes and food web structure in the Columbia River Estuary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSimenstad, Charles A.; Small, Lawrence F.; David McIntire, C.\n\nConsumption processes at several trophic levels tend to coverage in the central (estuarine-mixing) region of the Columbia River estuary, where living and dentrital food resources are entrained within the energy null of the turbidity maximum zone. Primary consumers in this region are generalist and omnivorous feeders, capable of exploiting both autotrophic and heterotrophic food web pathways. In the presence of higher standing stocks of their prey resources, feeding by secondary and tertiary consumers is also concentrated, or more effective, in the estuarine mixing region of the estuary. During the 1980-1981 studies of the estuary, total consumer (metazoan) production averaged 5.5g C m -2 within the estuary. Of the estimated 15 x 10 3mt Cyy -1 attributed to primary consumption in the water column, 83% was the result of suspension-feeding pelagic zooplankton. In comparison to grazing on phytoplankton, it was estimated that approximately 84% of primary consumption in the water column was based on suspended detritus and, presumably, associated microbiota. Endemic primary,consumers, principally epibenthic crustaceans such as the calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis, the harpacticoid copepod Scottolana canadensis, and the crangonid shrimp Crangon franciscorum, accounted for a high proportion of the consumption of suspended particles. Wertland herbivores inhabiting the estuary's extensive marshes, on the other hand, were estimated to account for only 2 to 17% of total estuarine primary consumption. Trophic linkages to secondary and tertiary consumers were more evenly apportioned among pelagic fishes, motile macroinvertebrates, and benthic infauna. High, comparatively unknown fluxes of migratory or wide-ranging tertiary consumers, such as piscivorous birds, seals and sea lions, made estimation of their annual consumption rates in the estuary highly tenuous. The physical processes of mixing and stratification, sediments accretion and erosion, and salinity intrusion appear to\n\nAssessing the risk posed by high-turbidity water to water supplies.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Chia-Ling; Liao, Chung-Sheng\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the risk of insufficient water supply posed by high-turbidity water. Several phenomena can pose risks to the sufficiency of a water supply; this study concerns risks to water treatment plants from particular properties of rainfall and raw water turbidity. High-turbidity water can impede water treatment plant operations; rainfall properties can influence the degree of soil erosion. Thus, water turbidity relates to rainfall characteristics. Exceedance probabilities are presented for different rainfall intensities and turbidities of water. When the turbidity of raw water is higher than 5,000Â NTU, it can cause operational problems for a water treatment plant. Calculations show that the turbidity of raw water at the Ban-Sin water treatment plant will be higher than 5,000Â NTU if the rainfall intensity is larger than 165Â mm/day. The exceedance probability of high turbidity (turbidity >5,000Â NTU) in the Ban-Sin water treatment plant is larger than 10%. When any water treatment plant cannot work regularly, its ability to supply water to its customers is at risk.\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase Activity : an overlooked player on the phosphate behavior in macrotidal estuaries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDelmas, Daniel; Labry, Claire; Youenou, Agnes; Quere, Julien; Auguet, Jean Christophe; Montanie, Helene\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe non-conservative behavior of phosphate within the estuarine salinity gradient is essentially assigned to physico-chemical processes, such as desorption at low salinity and to benthic exchanges. Microbial phosphatase activity (APA), generally related to phosphate deficiency, is seldom studied in phosphate rich estuarine waters. In order to address the impact of microbial activity (bacterial abundance, production BSP, APA) on phosphate behavior, we studied these activities on a seasonal basis within the salinity gradient of two macrotidal estuaries presenting different levels of suspended solids. Whatever the season the Charente estuary is characterized by high levels of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM > 1g.L-1), particularly in the Maximum Turbidity Zone (MTZ) located at the 5-10 psu. In this area characterized by high BSP and APA there is a significant increase of PO4 levels especially during summer. In the Aulne estuary the particle load is significantly lower (1/10) but high BSP and APA are equally recorded. In the highly turbid waters of the Charente estuary, active phytoplankton is virtually absent as pheopigments constitute up to 80% of the total pigments, particularly in the MTZ, therefore APA may essentially have a bacterial origin. In the Aulne estuary attached bacteria are dominant, both in numbers and production, and their distribution along the haline gradient perfectly follows those of APA and phosphate levels. These observations, associated with the very close relationships observed between APA, SPM and BSP, suggest that APA derive mainly from bacterial (attached) origin and operate at the expense of particulate phosphorus and hence contribute to PO4 regeneration, especially in spring and summer. Finally, as APA increased as PO4, whereas the reverse is observed in both fresh and marine waters, an original scheme for APA regulation, related to the large dominance of attached bacteria can be described for the estuarine waters.\n\nHigh-resolution remote sensing of water quality in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFichot, CÃ©dric G.; Downing, Bryan D.; Bergamaschi, Brian; Windham-Myers, Lisamarie; Marvin-DiPasquale, Mark C.; Thompson, David R.; Gierach, Michelle M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe San Francisco BayâDelta Estuary watershed is a major source of freshwater for California and a profoundly human-impacted environment. The water quality monitoring that is critical to the management of this important water resource and ecosystem relies primarily on a system of fixed water-quality monitoring stations, but the limited spatial coverage often hinders understanding. Here, we show how the latest technology in visible/near-infrared imaging spectroscopy can facilitate water quality monitoring in this highly dynamic and heterogeneous system by enabling simultaneous depictions of several water quality indicators at very high spatial resolution. The airborne portable remote imaging spectrometer (PRISM) was used to derive high-spatial-resolution (2.6 Ã 2.6 m) distributions of turbidity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a concentrations in a wetland-influenced region of this estuary. A filter-passing methylmercury vs DOC relationship was also developed using in situ samples and enabled the high-spatial-resolution depiction of surface methylmercury concentrations in this area. The results illustrate how high-resolution imaging spectroscopy can inform management and policy development in important inland and estuarine water bodies by facilitating the detection of point- and nonpoint-source pollution, and by providing data to help assess the complex impacts of wetland restoration and climate change on water quality and ecosystem productivity.\n\nPhysical and biogeochemical controls on light attenuation in a eutrophic, back-barrier estuary\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGanju, Neil K.; Miselis, Jennifer L.; Aretxabaleta, Alfredo L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLight attenuation is a critical parameter governing the ecological function of shallow estuaries. In these systems primary production is often dominated by benthic macroalgae and seagrass; thus light penetration to the bed is of primary importance. We quantified light attenuation in three seagrass meadows in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, a shallow eutrophic back-barrier estuary; two of the sites were located within designated Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs). We sequentially deployed instrumentation measuring photosynthetically active radiation, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) fluorescence, dissolved organic matter fluorescence (fDOM; a proxy for colored DOM absorbance), turbidity, pressure, and water velocity at 10 min intervals over three week periods at each site. At the southernmost site, where sediment availability was highest, light attenuation was highest and dominated by turbidity and to a lesser extent chl-a and CDOM. At the central site, chl-a dominated followed by turbidity and CDOM, and at the northernmost site turbidity and CDOM contributed equally to light attenuation. At a given site, the temporal variability of light attenuation exceeded the difference in median light attenuation at the three sites, indicating the need for continuous high-temporal resolution measurements. Vessel wakes, anecdotally implicated in increasing sediment resuspension, did not contribute to local resuspension within the seagrass beds, though frequent vessel wakes were observed in the channels. With regards to light attenuation and water clarity, physical and biogeochemical variables appear to outweigh any regulation of boat traffic within the ESAs.\n\nStratigraphic Expression of the Turbidity Maximum and Evidence for Short-Term Climate Change from Estimates of Paleosalinity in the Hudson Estuary Between 6 and 2 ka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPekar, S. F.; McHugh, C. M.; Lynch-Stieglitz, J.; Christie-Blick, N.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nBenthic foraminiferal biofacies and oxygen isotopes from juvenile bivalves have been used to estimate paleosalinity changes in three cores from the lower Hudson estuary (5 km north of the George Washington Bridge to north of the Tappan Zee Bridge) for the mid-Holocene between 6 and 2 ka. Four foraminiferal biofacies were identified and compared with living assemblages previously calibrated to salinity in the estuary. Oxygen isotopes were obtained from monospecific bivalves (Gemma gemma) within a narrow size fraction (1.0-1.7 mm) to minimize temperature effects that would otherwise tend to dominate isotopic records. A comparison shows good agreement between paleosalinity estimates from foraminiferal biofacies and oxygen isotopes; thus, permitting oxygen isotopes to be used as paleosalinity proxies. These data were integrated with sedimentological interpretations of the cores and C-14 ages to evaluate the patterns that emerged. West of the main channel and 5 km north of the Tappan Zee Bridge (20 km upstream of the northernmost present-day location of the ETM, Core SD-30), sedimentation increased by a factor of four at 4.9 ka, within an interval for which the highest paleosalinity is estimated (20-27â° ) for this area. Paleosalinity decreased to 10-16â° at 3.5 ka, coinciding with an abrupt decrease in the rate of sediment accumulation. Directly west of SD-30 and nearer to the shore, comparable changes in sedimentation were not observed although similar trends in paleosalinity are observed in the record (25â° decreasing to 14â° ). Further seaward and in the eastern part of the estuary, paleosalinities and sedimentation remained relatively constant (20-27â° salinity and 0.8-1.9 mm/yr). Observations in the modern estuary indicate that sediment accumulates preferentially on the western subaqueous flats in the vicinity of the turbidity maximum that corresponds with salinities ranging from the low twenties to mid teens. We hypothesize that Holocene sedimentation\n\nHydrologic data summary for the St. Lucie River Estuary, Martin and St. Lucie Counties, Florida, 1998-2001\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nByrne, Michael J.; Patino, Eduardo\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA hydrologic analysis was made at three canal sites and four tidal sites along the St. Lucie River Estuary in southeastern Florida from 1998 to 2001. The data included for analysis are stage, 15-minute flow, salinity, water temperature, turbidity, and suspended-solids concentration. During the period of record, the estuary experienced a drought, major storm events, and high-water discharge from Lake Okeechobee. Flow mainly occurred through the South Fork of the St. Lucie River; however, when flow increased through control structures along the C-23 and C-24 Canals, the North Fork was a larger than usual contributor of total freshwater inflow to the estuary. At one tidal site (Steele Point), the majority of flow was southward toward the St. Lucie Inlet; at a second tidal site (Indian River Bridge), the majority of flow was northward into the Indian River Lagoon. Large-volume stormwater discharge events greatly affected the St. Lucie River Estuary. Increased discharge typically was accompanied by salinity decreases that resulted in water becoming and remaining fresh throughout the estuary until the discharge events ended. Salinity in the estuary usually returned to prestorm levels within a few days after the events. Turbidity decreased and salinity began to increase almost immediately when the gates at the control structures closed. Salinity ranged from less than 1 to greater than 35 parts per thousand during the period of record (1998-2001), and typically varied by several parts per thousand during a tidal cycle. Suspended-solids concentrations were observed at one canal site (S-80) and two tidal sites (Speedy Point and Steele Point) during a discharge event in April and May 2000. Results suggest that most deposition of suspended-solids concentration occurs between S-80 and Speedy Point. The turbidity data collected also support this interpretation. The ratio of inorganic to organic suspended-solids concentration observed at S-80, Speedy Point, and Steele Point\n\nPPCPs in Jiulong River estuary (China): Spatiotemporal distributions, fate, and their use as chemical markers of wastewater.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Qian; Li, Yan; Li, Mingyue; Ashfaq, Muhammad; Lv, Min; Wang, Hongjie; Hu, Anyi; Yu, Chang-Ping\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe occurrence and fate of 50 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were investigated in the surface water of Jiulong River estuary in the southeast of China in spring, wet season, summer, autumn and winter. Results demonstrated a wide distribution of PPCPs in Jiulong River estuary, where 34 PPCPs were detected at least once and 5 PPCPs were detected in all the samples, including caffeine, diclofenac, metoprolol, methyl paraben, and propyl paraben. Spatial and seasonal variations were observed. Special emphasis was placed on the PPCP fate in the estuary. Most PPCPs showed a non-conservative behavior in the estuary, while the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and bisphenol A showed a pseudo-conservative behavior. The non-conservative and pseudo-conservative behavior was attributed to the combination of the seawater dilution, the introduction of PPCPs via the sewage water, and the physical, chemical, or biological removal processes. Furthermore, PPCP concentrations showed drastic variations in the turbidity maximum zones. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to indicate the pseudo-conservative behavior of PPCPs in the estuary, and to show the drastic variations of PPCPs in the turbidity maximum zone. In addition, the ratio of labile to conservative PPCPs was calculated to track the source of untreated sewage contamination. Results showed a significantly higher ratio compared to the average value in WWTP effluents, indicating the ubiquitous discharge of untreated domestic wastewater in Jiulong River estuary. In addition, the high ratio of bisphenol A to conservative PPCPs implied the potential input of untreated industrial wastewater in Jiulong River estuary. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical Modeling of Turbidity Maximum Dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrasso, F.; Verney, R.; Le Hir, P.; Thouvenin, B.; Schulz, E.; Kervella, Y.; Khojasteh Pour Fard, I.; Lemoine, J.-P.; Dumas, F.; Garnier, V.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTidal pumping, baroclinic circulation, and vertical mixing are known to be the main mechanisms responsible for the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) formation. However, the influence of hydro-meteorological conditions on ETM dynamics is still not properly grasped and requires further investigation to be quantified. Based on a realistic three-dimensional numerical model of the macrotidal Seine Estuary (France) that accounts for mud and sand transport processes, the objective of this study is to quantify the influence of the main forcing (river flow, tides, and waves) on the ETM location and mass changes. As expected, the ETM location is strongly modulated by semidiurnal tidal cycles and fortnightly time scales with a high sensitivity to river flow variations. The ETM mass is clearly driven by the tidal range, characteristic of the tidal pumping mechanism. However, it is not significantly affected by the river flow. Energetic wave conditions substantially influence the ETM mass by contributing up to 44% of the maximum mass observed during spring tides and by increasing the mass by a factor of 3 during mean tides compared to calm wave conditions. This means that neglecting wave forcing can result in significantly underestimating the ETM mass in estuarine environments. In addition, neap-to-spring phasing has a strong influence on ETM location and mass through a hysteresis response associated with the delay for tidal pumping and stratification to fully develop. Finally, simulations show that the uppermost limit of the Seine ETM location did not change notably during the last 35 years; however, the seaward limit migrated few kilometers upstream.\n\nTurbidity interferes with foraging success of visual but not chemosensory predators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmee, Delbert L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPredation can significantly affect prey populations and communities, but predator effects can be attenuated when abiotic conditions interfere with foraging activities. In estuarine communities, turbidity can affect species richness and abundance and is changing in many areas because of coastal development. Many fish species are less efficient foragers in turbid waters, and previous research revealed that in elevated turbidity, fish are less abundant whereas crabs and shrimp are more abundant. We hypothesized that turbidity altered predatory interactions in estuaries by interfering with visually-foraging predators and prey but not with organisms relying on chemoreception. We measured the effects of turbidity on the predation rates of two model predators: a visual predator (pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides) and a chemosensory predator (blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus) in clear and turbid water (0 and â¼100 nephelometric turbidity units). Feeding assays were conducted with two prey items, mud crabs (Panopeus spp.) that rely heavily on chemoreception to detect predators, and brown shrimp (Farfantepenaus aztecus) that use both chemical and visual cues for predator detection. Because turbidity reduced pinfish foraging on both mud crabs and shrimp, the changes in predation rates are likely driven by turbidity attenuating fish foraging ability and not by affecting prey vulnerability to fish consumers. Blue crab foraging was unaffected by turbidity, and blue crabs were able to successfully consume nearly all mud crab and shrimp prey. Turbidity can influence predatorâprey interactions by reducing the feeding efficiency of visual predators, providing a competitive advantage to chemosensory predators, and altering top-down control in food webs.
