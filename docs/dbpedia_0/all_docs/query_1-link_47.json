        "text": "In this paper, we analyze stellar proper motions in the core of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae to explore the possibility of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) influence on the stellar dynamics. Our use of short-wavelength photometry affords us an exceedingly clear view of stellar motions into the very center of the crowded core, yielding proper motions for >50,000 stars in the central 2'. We model the velocity dispersion profile of the cluster using an isotropic Jeans model. The density distribution is taken as a central IMBH point mass added to a combination of King templates. We individually model the general low-mass cluster objects (main sequence/giant stars), as well as the concentrated populations of heavy binary systems and dark stellar remnants. Using unbinned likelihood model fitting, we find that the inclusion of the concentrated populations in our model plays a crucial role in fitting for an IMBH mass. The concentrated binaries and stellar-mass black holes (BHs) produce a sufficient velocity dispersion signal in the core so as to make an IMBH unnecessary to fit the observations. We additionally determine that a stellar-mass BH retention fraction of ≳8.5% becomes incompatible with our observed velocities in the core.\n\nShock waves play an important role in turbulent astrophysical media by compressing the gas and dissipating the turbulent energy into the thermal energy. Here, we study shocks in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence using high-resolution simulations. Turbulent Mach numbers of and initial magnetic fields of plasma beta β0 = 0.1–10 are considered, targeting turbulences in interstellar and intracluster media. Specifically, we present the statistics of fast and slow shocks, such as the distribution of shock Mach numbers (Ms) and the energy dissipation at shocks, based on refined methodologies for their quantifications. While most shocks form with low Ms, strong shocks follow exponentially decreasing distributions of Ms. More shocks appear for larger and larger β0. Fast shock populations dominate over slow shocks if β0 ≫ 1, but substantial populations of slow shocks develop in the cases of β ≲ 1, i.e., strong background fields. The shock dissipation of turbulent energy occurs preferentially at fast shocks with Ms ≲ of a few to several, and the dissipation at strong shocks shows exponentially decreasing functions of Ms. The energy dissipation at shocks, normalized to the energy injection, shock/inj, is estimated to be in the range of ∼0.1–0.5, except for the case of and β0 = 0.1, where the shock dissipation is negligible. The fraction decreases with it is close to ∼0.4–0.6 for , while it is ∼0.1–0.25 for . The rest of the turbulent energy is expected to dissipate through the turbulent cascade. Our work will add insights into the interpretations of physical processes in turbulent interstellar and intracluster media.\n\nWe present Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) spectroscopy for nine early-type galaxies (ETGs) representing the most CO-rich and far-infrared (FIR) bright galaxies of the volume-limited Atlas3D sample. Our data include detections of mid- to high-J CO transitions (J = 4–3 to J = 13–12) and the [C i] (1–0) and (2–1) emission lines. CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) for our ETGs indicate low gas excitation, barring NGC 1266. We use the [C i] emission lines to determine the excitation temperature of the neutral gas, as well as estimate the mass of molecular hydrogen. The masses agree well with masses derived from CO, making this technique very promising for high-redshift galaxies. We do not find a trend between the [N ii] 205 flux and the infrared luminosity, but we do find that the [N ii] 205/CO(6–5) line ratio is correlated with the 60/100 μm Infrared Astronomical Satellite colors. Thus the [N ii] 205/CO(6–5) ratio can be used to infer a dust temperature and hence the intensity of the interstellar radiation field. Photodissociation region models show that use of [C i] and CO lines in addition to the typical [C ii], [O i], and FIR fluxes drive the model solutions to higher densities and lower values of G0. In short, the SPIRE lines indicate that the atomic and molecular gas in the CO-rich ETGs have similar properties to other galaxies. As might be expected from their low levels of star formation activity, the ETGs have rather low excitation CO SLEDs, low temperatures inferred from the [C i] lines, and modestly lower [C i]/CO ratios.\n\nWe present spectral and timing properties of the newly discovered X-ray transient source, MAXI J1535-571, which is believed to be a Galactic X-ray binary containing a black hole candidate (BHC) as the primary object. Since its discovery on 2017 September 2, it has been monitored regularly in multi-wavelength bands by several satellites. We use archival data of the Swift (XRT and BAT) and MAXI (GSC) satellite instruments to study accretion flow dynamics of the source during the outburst. During its outburst, the source became very bright in the sky with a maximum observed flux of 5 Crab in the 2–10 keV GSC band. Similar to other transient BHCs, it also shows signatures of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) during the outburst. Spectral data of different instruments are fitted with the transonic flow, solution-based two-component advective flow model fits file to find the direct accretion flow parameters. The evolution of spectral states and their transitions are understood from the model-fitted physical flow parameters and nature of QPOs. We also estimate the probable mass of the black hole from our spectral analysis as 7.9–9.9 M⊙ or 8.9 ± 1.0 M⊙.\n\nThe manner in which warps in accretion disks evolve depends on the magnitude of the viscosity. For small viscosity (α < H/R), the warp evolves in a wave-like manner; for large viscosity, H/R < α ≪ 1, it evolves diffusively. Here, α is the viscosity parameter and H/R is the disk aspect ratio. Currently there is no simple set of equations that describes the evolution in both regimes. In this paper, we describe a possible solution to this problem and introduce a set of one-dimensional equations that describe the evolution of a warped disk that are applicable in both high- and low-viscosity regimes for arbitrary tilts, but small warps.\n\nWe report NOrthern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) observations of warm molecular gas traced by CO(5 − 4) in a gas-rich main-sequence (MS) galaxy, initially serendipitously detected in CO(3 − 2) emission in \"blind\" deep NOEMA observations. Our target shows a gas excitation consistent with that seen in MS galaxies ( ), albeit toward the low end, as well as a similar star formation efficiency based on the CO(3 − 2) line luminosity and the . However, it shows a high molecular gas fraction ( ) as compared to MS galaxies ( ), consistent with a cosmologically increasing gas fraction beyond and our current understanding of scaling relations between z, , the stellar mass M*, and the specific star formation rate. Our results are consistent with recent findings by the COLDz and ASPECS molecular line scan surveys, and suggest that deep searches for CO emission are a powerful means to identify gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at high redshift.\n\nWe investigate the climate modes and climate evolution of Earth-like planets—specifically planets that receive lower insolation than the present Earth—to discuss the outer limits of the habitable zones (HZs) associated with main-sequence stars. The HZ outer limit is discussed in terms of the insolation above which a planet maintains liquid water on its surface (e.g., warm climate). We call this a \"warm start limit.\" However, an alternative outer limit exists above which a planet characterized by a snowball climate transitions to a warm climate, which we call a \"cold start limit.\" The cold start limit is determined by two different mechanisms: condensation of CO2 and maximum CO2 greenhouse effect. The threshold insolation is always higher than the warm start limit. We find that for the initial few billion years following the formation of a planetary system, the location of its outer HZ limit does not evolve away from the initial warm start limit. It subsequently moves in accordance with the evolution of the cold start limit. We also find that when the luminosity increase of the central star is slow relative to the decrease in the CO2 degassing rate, the location of the outer limit of the HZ may even move inward. We conclude that the cold start limit should be treated as the outer limit of the HZ given the prevailing uncertainties, including the evolution of the CO2 degassing rate and continental growth.\n\nMeasuring stellar rotational velocities is a powerful way to probe the many astrophysical phenomena that drive, or are driven by, the evolution of stellar angular momentum. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to measuring the projected rotational velocity, . Rather than directly measuring the broadening of spectral lines, we leverage the large information content of high-resolution spectral data to empirically estimate . We adapt the framework laid down by The Cannon, which trains a generative model of the stellar flux as a function of wavelength using high-fidelity reference data, and can then produce estimates of stellar parameters and abundances for other stars directly from their spectra. Instead of modeling the flux as a function of wavelength, however, we model the first derivative of the spectra, as we expect the slopes of spectral lines to change as a function of . This technique is computationally efficient and provides a means of rapidly estimating for large numbers of stars in spectroscopic survey data. We analyze Sloan Digital Sky Survey Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectra, constructing a model informed by high-fidelity stellar parameter estimates derived from high-resolution California Kepler Survey spectra of the same stars. We use the model to estimate up to 15 for 27,000 APOGEE spectra, in fractions of a second per spectrum. Our estimates agree with the APOGEE estimates to within 1.2 .\n\nArgon, krypton, xenon, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus have all been measured and found to be enriched by a quasi uniform factor in the 2–4 range, compared to their protosolar values, in the atmosphere of Jupiter. To elucidate the origin of these volatile enrichments, we investigate the possibility of an inward drift of particles made of amorphous ice and adsorbed volatiles, and their ability to enrich in heavy elements the gas phase of the protosolar nebula, once they cross the amorphous-to-crystalline ice transition zone, following the original idea formulated by Monga & Desch. To do so, we use a simple accretion disk model coupled to modules depicting the radial evolution of icy particles and vapors, assuming growth, fragmentation, and crystallization of amorphous grains. We show that it is possible to accrete supersolar gas from the nebula onto proto-Jupiter's core to form its envelope, and allowing it to match the observed volatile enrichments. Our calculations suggest that nebular gas, with a metallicity similar to that measured in Jupiter, can be accreted by its envelope if the planet is formed in the ∼0.5–2 Myr time range and in the 0.5–20 au distance range from the Sun, depending on the adopted viscosity parameter of the disk. These values match a wide range of Jupiter's formation scenarios, including in situ formation and migration/formation models.\n\nMagnetohydrodynamic simulation is carried out for the NOAA AR 12615 in the time span t ∈ {05:48, 06:18} UT on 2016 December 5; covering events of a blowout jet and a C1.2 flare. The events are selected based on the small interval between their occurrences, which provides us with an opportunity to explore two energetically different events of magnetic reconnection (MR) within the run time of a single magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. The simulation is initiated with magnetic field extrapolated from the vector magnetogram provided by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager/Solar Dynamics Observatory, using a non-force-free approximation. The extrapolated Lorentz force is found to decay at a rate faster than the volume current density, making the higher corona to be effectively force-free while the Lorentz force affects only the lower corona and the photosphere—a desirable feature that agrees with the contemporary understanding. For the simulation, the plasma is idealized to be incompressible, thermally homogeneous and having perfect electrical conductivity. The results affirm MRs near a set of two three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls to be responsible for initiating the jet. Moreover, a flux rope located near the nulls contributes to the jet by changing its magnetic field lines from an anchored to an open topology. The scenario agrees with the standard mini-filament breakout model for blowout jets and provides its first demonstration from a 3D data-constrained MHD simulation where the computational output is reconciled with magnetogram(s) only once. The generation of flare ribbons is attributed to reconnections at a 3D null and a quasi-separatrix layer (QSL), highlighting the importance of topological complexity in flare initiation.\n\nThe magma ocean (MO) is a crucial stage in the build-up of terrestrial planets. Its solidification and the accompanying outgassing of volatiles set the conditions for important processes occurring later or even simultaneously, such as solid-state mantle convection and atmospheric escape. To constrain the duration of a global-scale Earth MO, we have built and applied a 1D interior model coupled with either a gray H2O/CO2 atmosphere or with a pure H2O atmosphere treated with a line-by-line model described in a companion paper by Katyal et al. We study in detail the effects of several factors affecting the MO lifetime, such as the initial abundance of H2O and CO2, the convection regime, the viscosity, the mantle melting temperature, and the longwave radiation absorption from the atmosphere. In this specifically multivariable system, we assess the impact of each factor with respect to a reference setting commonly assumed in the literature. We find that the MO stage can last from a few thousand to several million years. By coupling the interior model with the line-by-line atmosphere model, we identify the conditions that determine whether the planet experiences a transient MO or it ceases to cool and maintains a continuous MO. We find a simultaneous dependence of this distinction on the mass of the outgassed H2O atmosphere and on the MO surface melting temperature. We discuss their combined impact on the MO's lifetime in addition to the known dependence on albedo, orbital distance, and stellar luminosity, and we note observational degeneracies that arise thereby for target exoplanets.\n\nObservations of isolated neutron stars place constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, neutron-rich matter, while nuclear physics experiments probe the EOS of hot, symmetric matter. Many dynamical phenomena, such as core-collapse supernovae, the formation and cooling of proto-neutron stars, and neutron star mergers, lie between these two regimes and depend on the EOS at finite temperatures for matter with varying proton fractions. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to accurately calculate the thermal pressure of neutron–proton–electron matter at arbitrary density, temperature, and proton fraction. This framework can be expressed using a set of five physically motivated parameters that span a narrow range of values for realistic EOS and are able to capture the leading-order effects of degenerate matter on the thermal pressure. We base two of these parameters on a new approximation of the Dirac effective mass, with which we reproduce the thermal pressure to within ≲30% for a variety of realistic EOS at densities of interest. Three additional parameters, which are based on the behavior of the symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density, allow us to extrapolate any cold EOS in β-equilibrium to arbitrary proton fractions. Our model thus allows a user to extend any cold nucleonic EOS, including piecewise polytropes, to arbitrary temperature and proton fraction for use in calculations and numerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena. We find that our formalism is able to reproduce realistic finite-temperature EOS with errors of ≲20% and offers a 1–3 orders-of-magnitude improvement over existing ideal-fluid models.\n\nBright Be star β CMi has been identified as a nonradial pulsator on the basis of space photometry with the Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars (MOST) satellite and also as a single-line spectroscopic binary with a period of 170 4. The purpose of this study is to re-examine both these findings using numerous electronic spectra from the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, Ondřejov Observatory, Universitätssterwarte Bochum, archival electronic spectra from several observatories, as well as the original MOST satellite photometry. We measured the radial velocity of the outer wings of the double Hα emission in all spectra at our disposal, and were not able to confirm significant radial-velocity changes. We also discuss the problems related to the detection of very small radial-velocity changes and conclude that while it is still possible that the star is a spectroscopic binary, there is currently no convincing proof of it from the radial-velocity measurements. Wavelet analysis of the MOST photometry shows that there is only one persistent (and perhaps slightly variable) periodicity of 0 617 of the light variations, with a double-wave light curve; all other short periods having only transient character. Our suggestion that this dominant period is the star's rotational period agrees with the estimated stellar radius, projected rotational velocity, and with the orbital inclination derived by two teams of investigators. New spectral observations obtained in the whole-night series would be needed to find out whether some possibly real, very small radial-velocity changes cannot, in fact, be due to rapid line-profile changes.\n\nSupernova remnants (SNRs) are complex, three-dimensional objects; properly accounting for this complexity when modeling the resulting X-ray emission presents quite a challenge and makes it difficult to accurately characterize the properties of the full SNR volume. We apply for the first time a novel analysis method called smoothed particle inference, which can be used to study and characterize the structure, dynamics, morphology, and abundances of the entire remnant with a single analysis. We apply the method to the SNe Ia remnant DEM L71. We present histograms and maps showing global properties of the remnant, including temperature, abundances of various elements, abundance ratios, and ionization age. Our analysis confirms the high abundance of Fe within the ejecta of the supernova, which has led to it being typed as a Ia. We demonstrate that the results obtained with this method are consistent with results derived from numerical simulations carried out by us, as well as with previous analyses in the literature. At the same time, we show that despite its regular appearance, the temperature and other parameter maps exhibit highly irregular substructure that is not captured with typical X-ray analysis methods.\n\nThe quasar 3C 454.3 underwent a uniquely structured multifrequency outburst in 2016 June. The blazar was observed in the optical R-band by several ground-based telescopes in photometric and polarimetric modes, at γ-ray frequencies by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, and at 43 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array. The maximum flux density was observed on 2016 June 24 at both optical and γ-ray frequencies, reaching mJy and ph cm−2 s−1, respectively. The 2016 June outburst possessed a precipitous decay at both γ-ray and optical frequencies, with the source decreasing in flux density by a factor of 4 over a 24 hr period in the R-band. Intraday variability was observed throughout the outburst, with flux density changes between 1 and 5 mJy over the course of a night. The precipitous decay featured statistically significant quasiperiodic microvariability oscillations with an amplitude of ∼2%–3% about the mean trend and a characteristic period of 36 minutes. The optical degree of polarization jumped from ∼3% to nearly 20% during the outburst, while the position angle varied by ∼120°. A knot was ejected from the 43 GHz core on 2016 February 25, moving at an apparent speed . From the observed minimum timescale of variability and derived Doppler factor δ = 22.6, we find the size of the emission region r ≲ 2.6 × 1015 cm. If the quasiperiodic microvariability oscillations are caused by periodic variations of the Doppler factor of emission from a turbulent vortex, we derive the rotational speed of the vortex to be ∼0.2c.\n\nIn clusters of galaxies, the red sequence is believed to be a consequence of a correlation between stellar mass and chemical abundances, with more massive galaxies being more metal-rich and, as a consequence, redder. However, there is a color scatter around the red sequence that holds even with precision photometry, implying that the galaxy population is more complicated than as described by a mass–metallicity relation. We use precision photometry from the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) to investigate what drives this scatter. In four CLASH clusters at z = 0.355 ± 0.007, we find that the optical–IR galaxy colors confirm the previously known trend of metallicity along the red sequence but also show a strong connection between stellar age and red sequence offset, with ages ranging from 3 to 8 Gyr. Starting with fixed-age color–magnitude relations motivated by the mass–metallicity correlations of CLASH cluster galaxies, and by adjusting galaxy colors through stellar population models to put them all at the age of our red sequence, we are able to reduce the, e.g., F625W–F814W scatter from 0.051 to 0.026 mag with median photometric errors of 0.029 mag. While we will extend this analysis to the full CLASH sample, in four clusters our technique already provides a color precision in near-total-light apertures to resolve the spread in stellar population formation ages that drives the scatter in the red sequence.\n\nWe perform hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and circumstellar medium (CSM) for SN 1993J and SN 2011dh, and calculate the radio and X-ray emissions expected from the shocked gas at late epochs (t). Considering the ejecta structure from multi-group radiation hydrodynamics simulation, we find that the observed rapid drop in radio and X-ray light curves of SN 1993J at t > 3000 days may be due to a change in the mass-loss rate ( ) ∼6500 yr prior to the explosion of the SN. The exact epoch scales inversely with the assumed wind velocity of vw = 10 . The progenitor of this SN very likely belonged to a binary system, where, during its evolution, the primary had transferred material to the secondary. It is argued in this paper that the change in can happen because of a change in the mass accretion efficiency (η) of the companion star. It is possible that before ∼6500 (vw/10 )−1 yr prior to the explosion, η was high, and thus the CSM was tenuous, which causes the late-time downturn in fluxes. In the case of SN 2011dh, the late-time evolution is found to be consistent with a wind medium with /vw = 4 × 10−6 /10 . It is difficult from our analysis to predict whether the progenitor of this SN had a binary companion; however, if future observations show a similar decrease in radio and X-ray fluxes, then this would give strong support to a scenario where both SNe had undergone a similar kind of binary evolution before explosion.\n\nWe present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and grism spectroscopy of a strongly lensed LIRG at z = 0.816, SGAS 143845.1+145407, and use the magnification boost of gravitational lensing to study the distribution of star formation throughout this galaxy. Based on the HST imaging data, we create a lens model for this system; we compute the mass distribution and magnification map of the z = 0.237 foreground lens. We find that the magnification of the lensed galaxy ranges between 2 and 10, with a total magnification (measured over all the images of the source) of μ = . We find that the total projected mass density within ∼34 kpc of the brightest cluster galaxy is . Using the lens model we create a source reconstruction for SGAS 143845.1+145407, which, paired with a faint detection of Hα in the grism spectroscopy, allows us to finally comment directly on the distribution of star formation in a z ∼ 1 LIRG. We find widespread star formation across this galaxy, in agreement with the current understanding of these objects. However, we note a deficit of Hα emission in the nucleus of SGAS 143845.1+145407, likely due to dust extinction.\n\nWe present timing solutions for four pulsars discovered in the Green Bank Northern Celestial Cap survey. All four pulsars are isolated with spin periods between 0.26 and 1.84 s. PSR J0038−2501 has a 0.26 s period and a period derivative of 7.6 × 10−19 s s−1, which is unusually low for isolated pulsars with similar periods. This low period derivative may be simply an extreme value for an isolated pulsar or it could indicate an unusual evolution path for PSR J0038−2501, such as a disrupted recycled pulsar from a binary system or an orphaned central compact object (CCO). Correcting the observed spin-down rate for the Shklovskii effect suggests that this pulsar may have an unusually low space velocity, which is consistent with expectations for DRPs. There is no X-ray emission detected from PSR J0038−2501 in an archival Swift observation, which suggests that it is not a young orphaned CCO. The high dispersion measure of PSR J1949+3426 suggests a distance of 12.3 kpc. This distance indicates that PSR J1949+3426 is among the most distant 7% of Galactic field pulsars, and is one of the most luminous pulsars.\n\nWe present a mean-field approach to simulating merging processes of two spherical collisionless stellar systems. This approach is realized with a self-consistent field (SCF) method in which the full spatial dependence of the density and potential of a system is expanded in a set of basis functions for solving Poisson's equation. To apply this SCF method to a merging situation where two systems are moving in space, we assign the expansion center to the center of mass of each system, the position of which is followed by a massless particle placed at that position initially. Merging simulations over a wide range of impact parameters are performed using both an SCF code developed here and a tree code. The results of each simulation produced by the two codes show excellent agreement in the evolving morphology of the merging systems and in the density and velocity dispersion profiles of the merged systems. However, comparing the results generated by the tree code with those obtained with the softening-free SCF code, we found that in large impact parameter cases, a softening length of the Plummer type introduced in the tree code has an effect of advancing the orbital phase of the two systems in the merging process at late times. We demonstrate that the faster orbital phase originates from the larger convergence length to the pure Newtonian force. Other application problems suitable to the current SCF code are also discussed.\n\nWe present a census of ionized gas outflows in 599 normal galaxies at redshift 0.6 < z < 2.7, mostly based on integral field spectroscopy of Hα, [N ii], and [S ii] line emission. The sample fairly homogeneously covers the main sequence of star-forming galaxies with masses 9.0 < log(M*/M⊙) < 11.7, and probes into the regimes of quiescent galaxies and starburst outliers. About one-third exhibits the high-velocity component indicative of outflows, roughly equally split into winds driven by star formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The incidence of SF-driven winds correlates mainly with SF properties. These outflows have typical velocities of ∼450 km s−1, local electron densities of ne ∼ 380 cm−3, modest mass loading factors of ∼0.1–0.2 at all galaxy masses, and energetics compatible with momentum driving by young stellar populations. The SF-driven winds may escape from log(M*/M⊙) ≲ 10.3 galaxies, but substantial mass, momentum, and energy in hotter and colder outflow phases seem required to account for low galaxy formation efficiencies in the low-mass regime. Faster AGN-driven outflows (∼1000–2000 km s−1) are commonly detected above log(M*/M⊙) ∼ 10.7, in up to ∼75% of log(M*/M⊙) ≳ 11.2 galaxies. The incidence, strength, and velocity of AGN-driven winds strongly correlates with stellar mass and central concentration. Their outflowing ionized gas appears denser (ne ∼ 1000 cm−3), and possibly compressed and shock-excited. These winds have comparable mass loading factors as the SF-driven winds but carry ∼10 (∼50) times more momentum (energy). The results confirm our previous findings of high-duty-cycle, energy-driven outflows powered by AGN above the Schechter mass, which may contribute to SF quenching.\n\nThe TRAPPIST-1 system is sufficiently closely packed that tides raised by one planet on another are significant. We investigate whether this source of tidal heating is comparable to eccentricity tides raised by the star. Assuming a homogeneous body with a Maxwell rheology, we find that energy dissipation from stellar tides always dominates over that from planet–planet tides across a range of viscosities. TRAPPIST-1 g may experience the greatest proportion of planet–planet tidal heating, where it can account for between 2% and 20% of the total amount of tidal heating, for high-viscosity (1021 Pa s) and low-viscosity (1014 Pa s) regimes, respectively. If planet–planet tidal heating is to exceed that from stellar eccentricity tides, orbital eccentricities must be no more than e = 10−3–10−4 for most of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\n\nThis paper continues the approach of Kostenko & Thompson to calculating quantum electrodynamic processes in the ultrastrong magnetic field near some neutron stars, such as magnetars or merging binary neutron stars. Here we consider electron–positron scattering, the Coulomb scattering of electrons and positrons off ions, and relativistic e±–ion bremsstrahlung. The evaluation of differential and total cross sections simplifies considerably when the magnetic field lies in the range 103BQ ≫ B ≫ BQ, where BQ ≡ m2/e = 4.4 × 1013 G. Then, relativistic motion of e± is possible even when restricted to the lowest Landau state. Accurate results for differential and total cross sections are obtained by truncating the sum over intermediate-state Landau levels and otherwise disregarding terms inversely proportional to the magnetic field, which are complicated enough to have inhibited previous attempts to calculate magnetic electron–positron scattering and relativistic bremsstrahlung. A quantitative account is made of the effects of Debye screening.\n\nFilaments are ubiquitous structures in molecular clouds and play an important role in the mass assembly of stars. We present results of dynamical stability analyses for filaments in the infrared dark cloud G14.225−0.506, where a delayed onset of massive star formation was reported in the two hubs at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length. Full-synthesis imaging is performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to map the emission in two hub-filament systems with a spatial resolution of ∼0.034 pc. Kinematics are derived from a sophisticated spectral fitting algorithm that accounts for line blending, large optical depth, and multiple velocity components. We identify five velocity coherent filaments and derive their velocity gradients with principal component analysis. The mass accretion rates along the filaments are up to and are significant enough to affect the hub dynamics within one freefall time (∼105 yr). The filaments are in equilibrium with virial parameter αvir ∼ 1.2. We compare αvir measured in the filaments, filaments, 870 μm dense clumps, and 3 mm dense cores. The decreasing trend in αvir with decreasing spatial scales persists, suggesting an increasingly important role of gravity at small scales. Meanwhile, αvir also decreases with decreasing nonthermal motions. In combination with the absence of high-mass protostars and massive cores, our results are consistent with the global hierarchical collapse scenario.\n\nWe report on the discovery of the companion star to the millisecond pulsar J1342+2822B in the globular cluster M3. We exploited a combination of near-ultraviolet and optical observations acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope in order to search for the optical counterparts to the known millisecond pulsars in this cluster. At a position in excellent agreement with that of the radio pulsar J1342+2822B (M3B), we have identified a blue and faint object (mF275W ≈ 22.45) that, in the color–magnitude diagram of the cluster, is located in the region of He core white dwarfs (WDs). From the comparison of the observed magnitudes with theoretical cooling tracks we have estimated the physical properties of the companion star: it has a mass of only 0.19 ± 0.02 M⊙, a surface temperature of (12 ± 1) × 103 K, and a cooling age of Gyr. Its progenitor was likely a ∼0.84 M⊙ star, and the bulk of the mass-transfer activity occurred during the subgiant branch phase. The companion mass, combined with the pulsar mass function, implies that this system is observed almost edge-on and that the neutron star (NS) has a mass of 1.1 ± 0.3 M⊙, in agreement with the typical values measured for recycled NSs in these compact binary systems. We have also identified a candidate counterpart to the wide and eccentric binary millisecond pulsar J1342+2822D. It is another WD with a He core and a mass of 0.22 ± 0.2 M⊙, implying that the system is observed at a high inclination angle and hosts a typical NS with a mass of 1.3 ± 0.3 M⊙. At the moment, the large uncertainty on the radio position of this millisecond pulsar prevents us from robustly concluding that the detected star is its optical counterpart.\n\nThe standard self-similar model of galaxy cluster formation predicts that the X-ray luminosity–temperature (LX–TX) relation of galaxy clusters should have been in absence of the baryonic physics, such as radiative cooling and feedback from stars and black holes. However, this baseline relation is predicted without considering the fact that the halo concentration and the characteristic density of clusters increases as their mass decreases, which is a consequence of hierarchical structure formation of the universe. Here, we show that the actual baseline relation should be , where α ∼ 1.7, instead of α = 2, given the mass dependence of the concentration and the fundamental plane relation of galaxy clusters. Numerical simulations show that α ∼ 1.6, which is consistent with the prediction. We also show that the baseline luminosity–mass (LX–MΔ) relation should have been , where β ∼ 1.1–1.2, in contrast with the conventional prediction (β = 4/3). In addition, some of the scatter in the LX–MΔ relation can be attributed to the scatter in the concentration–mass (c–M) relation. The confirmation of the shallow slope could be proof of hierarchical clustering. As an example, we show that the new baseline relations could be checked by studying the temperature or mass dependence of gas mass fraction of clusters. Moreover, the highest-temperature clusters would follow the shallow baseline relations if the influences of cool cores and cluster mergers are properly removed.\n\nGas-phase coronene cations ( ) can be sequentially hydrogenated with up to 24 additional H atoms, inducing a gradual transition from a planar, aromatic molecule toward a corrugated, aliphatic species. The mass spectra of hydrogenated coronene cations show that molecules with odd numbers of additional hydrogen atoms (nH) are dominant, with particularly high relative intensity for \"magic numbers\" nH = 5, 11, and 17, for which hydrogen atoms have the highest binding energies. Reaction barriers and binding energies strongly affect the hydrogenation sequence and its site specificity. In this contribution, we monitor this sequence experimentally by the evolution of infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra of gaseous with nH = 3–11, obtained using an infrared free electron laser coupled to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometer. For weakly hydrogenated systems (nH = 3, 5) multiple-photon absorption mainly leads to loss of H atoms (and/or H2). With increasing nH, C2H2 loss becomes more relevant. For nH = 9, 11, the carbon skeleton is substantially weakened and fragmentation is distributed over a large number of channels. A comparison of our IRMPD spectra with density functional theory calculations clearly shows that only one or two hydrogenation isomers contribute to each nH. This confirms the concept of hydrogenation occurring along very specific sequences. Moreover, the atomic sites participating in the first 11 steps of this hydrogenation sequence are clearly identified.\n\nThe solar magnetic field (SMF) has historically been considered as dipole in order to build models of the radially expanding corona, that is, the solar wind in the solar minimum. The simplified approach suggests the existence of only one quasi-stationary current sheet (QCS) of solar origin in the heliosphere, namely, the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). However, the SMF becomes more complicated over the solar cycle, comprising higher-order components. The overlapping of the dipole and multipole components of the SMF suggests a formation of more than one QCS in the corona, which may expand further to the heliosphere. We study the impact of the quadrupole and octupole harmonics of the SMF on the formation and spatial characteristics of QCSs, building a stationary axisymmetric MHD model of QCSs in the heliosphere. It is shown that if the dipole component dominates, a single QCS appears in the solar wind at low heliolatitudes as the classic HCS. In other cases, the number of QCSs varies from one to three, depending on the relative input of the quadrupole and octupole components. QCSs possess a conic form and may occur at a wide variety of heliolatitudes. The existence of QCSs opens wide opportunities for explanations of puzzling observations of cosmic rays and energetic particles in the heliosphere and, at the same time, raises a risk of misinterpretation of in situ crossings of QCSs because of mixing up the HCS and higher-heliolatitude QCSs, which can be significantly disturbed in the dynamical solar wind.\n\nWe present results from a quantitative spectroscopic analysis conducted on archival Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) sample of transiting planetary host stars identified from the Kepler mission. The spectroscopic analysis was based on a carefully selected set of Fe i and Fe ii lines, resulting in precise values for the stellar parameters of effective temperature (Teff) and surface gravity (log g). Combining the stellar parameters with Gaia DR2 parallaxes and precise distances, we derived both stellar and planetary radii for our sample, with a median internal uncertainty of 2.8% in the stellar radii and 3.7% in the planetary radii. An investigation into the distribution of planetary radii confirmed the bimodal nature of this distribution for the small-radius planets found in previous studies, with peaks at ∼1.47 ± 0.05 and ∼2.72 ± 0.10 R⊕ with a gap at ∼1.9 R⊕. Previous studies that modeled planetary formation that is dominated by photoevaporation predicted this bimodal radii distribution and the presence of a radius gap, or photoevaporation valley. Our results are in overall agreement with these models, as well as core powered mass-loss models. The high internal precision achieved here in the derived planetary radii clearly reveal the presence of a slope in the photoevaporation valley for the CKS sample, indicating that the position of the radius gap decreases with orbital period; this decrease was fit by a power law of the form Rpl ∝ P−0.11, which is consistent with both photoevaporation and core powered mass-loss models of planet formation, with Earth-like core compositions.\n\nThe parent bodies of ordinary chondrites, carbonaceous CM chondrites, and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) represent most of the mass of the solar system's small (D ≤ 250 km) bodies. The times of formation of the ordinary and carbonaceous CM chondrite parent bodies have previously been pinpointed, respectively, to ≈2 and 3–4 million years after calcium–aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs). However, the timing of the formation of IDP parent bodies such as P- and D-type main-belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans has not been tightly constrained. Here, we show that they formed later than 5–6 million years after CAIs. We use models of their thermal and structural evolution to show that their anhydrous surface composition would otherwise have been lost due to melting and ice-rock differentiation driven by heating from the short-lived radionuclide 26Al. This suggests that IDP-like volatile-rich small bodies may have formed after the gas of the protoplanetary disk dissipated and thus later than the massive cores of the giant planets. It also confirms an intuitive increase in formation times with increased heliocentric distance, and suggests that there may have been a gap in time between the formation of carbonaceous chondrite (chondrule-rich) and IDP (chondrule-poor) parent bodies.\n\nThe evolution of Earth's early atmosphere and the emergence of habitable conditions on our planet are intricately coupled with the development and duration of the magma ocean (MO) phase during the early Hadean period (4–4.5 Ga). In this paper, we study the evolution of the steam atmosphere during the MO period. We obtain the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) using the line-by-line radiative transfer code GARLIC. Our study suggests that an atmosphere consisting of pure H2O, built as a result of outgassing, extends the MO lifetime to several million years. The thermal emission as a function of the solidification timescale of an MO is shown. We study the effect of thermal dissociation of H2O at higher temperatures by applying atmospheric chemical equilibrium, which results in the formation of H2 and O2 during the early phase of the MO. A 1%–6% reduction in the OLR is seen. We also obtain the effective height of the atmosphere by calculating the transmission spectra for the whole duration of the MO. An atmosphere of depth 100 km is seen for pure water atmospheres. The effect of thermal dissociation on the effective height of the atmosphere is also shown. Due to the difference in the absorption behavior at different altitudes, the spectral features of H2 and O2 are seen at different altitudes of the atmosphere. Therefore, these species, along with H2O, have a significant contribution to the transmission spectra and could be useful for placing observational constraints on MO exoplanets.\n\nWe report the discovery of a 1° scale X-ray plume in the northern Galactic Center (GC) region observed with Suzaku. The plume is located at (l, b) ∼ (0 2, 0 6), east of the radio lobe reported by previous studies. No significant X-ray excesses are found inside or to the west of the radio lobe. The spectrum of the plume exhibits strong emission lines from highly ionized Mg, Si, and S that are reproduced by a thin thermal plasma model with kT ∼ 0.7 keV and solar metallicity. There is no signature of non-equilibrium ionization. The unabsorbed surface brightness is 3 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 arcmin−2 in the 1.5–3.0 keV band. Strong interstellar absorption in the soft X-ray band indicates that the plume is not a foreground source but is at the GC distance, giving a physical size of ∼100 pc, density of 0.1 cm−3, thermal pressure of 1 × 10−10 erg cm−3, mass of 600 M⊙, and thermal energy of 7 × 1050 erg. From the apparent association with a polarized radio emission, we propose that the X-ray plume is a magnetized hot gas outflow from the GC.\n\nSolar flares often display pulsating and oscillatory signatures in the emission, known as quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP). QPP are typically identified during the impulsive phase of flares, yet in some cases, their presence is detected late into the decay phase. Here, we report extensive fine structure QPP that are detected throughout the large X8.2 flare from 2017 September 10. Following the analysis of the thermal pulsations observed in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite/X-ray sensor and the 131 Å channel of Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we find a pulsation period of ∼65 s during the impulsive phase followed by lower amplitude QPP with a period of ∼150 s in the decay phase, up to three hours after the peak of the flare. We find that during the time of the impulsive QPP, the soft X-ray source observed with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager rapidly rises at a velocity of approximately 17 km s−1 following the plasmoid/coronal mass ejection eruption. We interpret these QPP in terms of a manifestation of the reconnection dynamics in the eruptive event. During the long-duration decay phase lasting several hours, extended downward contractions of collapsing loops/plasmoids that reach the top of the flare arcade are observed in EUV. We note that the existence of persistent QPP into the decay phase of this flare are most likely related to these features. The QPP during this phase are discussed in terms of magnetohydrodynamic wave modes triggered in the post-flaring loops.\n\nThe existing set of SNe Ia is now sufficient to detect oscillatory deviations from the canonical ΛCDM cosmology. We determine that the Fourier spectrum of the Pantheon data set of spectroscopically well-observed SNe Ia is consistent with the predictions of ΛCDM. We also develop and describe two complementary techniques for using SNe Ia to constrain those alternate cosmological models that predict deviations from ΛCDM that are oscillatory in conformal time. The first technique uses the reduced χ2 statistic to determine the likelihood that the observed data would result from a given model. The second technique uses bootstrap analysis to determine the likelihood that the Fourier spectrum of a proposed model could result from statistical fluctuations around ΛCDM. We constrain three oscillatory alternate cosmological models: one in which the dark energy equation of state parameter oscillates around the canonical value of wΛ = −1, one in which the energy density of dark energy oscillates around its ΛCDM value, and one in which gravity derives from a scalar field evolving under an oscillatory coupling. We further determine that any alternate cosmological model that produces distance modulus residuals with a Fourier amplitude of ≃36 millimags is strongly ruled out, given the existing data, for frequencies between ≃0.08 Gyr−1h100 and ≃80 Gyr−1h100.\n\nUnderstanding elemental abundance variations in the solar corona provides an insight into how matter and energy flow from the chromosphere into the heliosphere. Observed variations depend on the first ionization potential (FIP) of the main elements of the Sun's atmosphere. High-FIP elements (>10 eV) maintain photospheric abundances in the corona, whereas low-FIP elements have enhanced abundances. Conversely, inverse FIP (IFIP) refers to the enhancement of high-FIP or depletion of low-FIP elements. We use spatially resolved spectroscopic observations, specifically the Ar xiv/Ca xiv intensity ratio, from Hinode's Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer to investigate the distribution and evolution of plasma composition within two confined flares in a newly emerging, highly sheared active region. During the decay phase of the first flare, patches above the flare ribbons evolve from the FIP to the IFIP effect, while the flaring loop tops show a stronger FIP effect. The patch and loop compositions then evolve toward the preflare basal state. We propose an explanation of how flaring in strands of highly sheared emerging magnetic fields can lead to flare-modulated IFIP plasma composition over coalescing umbrae which are crossed by flare ribbons. Subsurface reconnection between the coalescing umbrae leads to the depletion of low-FIP elements as a result of an increased wave flux from below. This material is evaporated when the flare ribbons cross the umbrae. Our results are consistent with the ponderomotive fractionation model for the creation of IFIP-biased plasma.\n\nThe solar wind emitted from the solar corona is a highly ionized plasma composed of electrons, protons, He2+ ions, and a small fraction of heavier ions. Additionally, interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms ionized in the heliosphere form populations of pickup ions (PUIs). The two most abundant PUIs are of H+ and He+. Some solar wind ions are neutralized due to charge exchange with ISN atoms. Besides the neutral solar wind created by this process, a population of He+ ions is formed from solar wind He2+ ions, with kinetic properties inherited from solar wind ions. The rate of production of these He+ ions increases significantly with solar wind speed. Consequently, in the fast solar wind, over 10% of solar wind He2+ turns into He+ along the path to the termination shock. There have been very few observations of this population so far. Here we show that observations from the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on New Horizons contain a signature of this population. Namely, solar wind He+ ions cause an enhanced flux just below the cutoff energy of H+ PUIs. We identify 17 daily spectra collected by SWAP with this feature during steady solar wind conditions. We find that the fit parameters of the H+ PUI model are considerably affected when the He+ ion population is significant. Moreover, we note that some of the observations are likely also affected by other heavy solar wind ions, e.g., oxygen and carbon.\n\nRecent observations of protoplanetary disks, as well as simulations of planet–disk interaction, have suggested that a single planet may excite multiple spiral arms in the disk, in contrast to the previous expectations based on linear theory (predicting a one-armed density wave). We reassess the origin of multiple arms in the framework of linear theory by solving for the global two-dimensional response of a nonbarotropic disk to an orbiting planet. We show that the formation of a secondary arm in the inner disk, at about half of the orbital radius of the planet, is a robust prediction of linear theory. This arm becomes stronger than the primary spiral at several tenths of the orbital radius of the planet. Several additional, weaker spiral arms may also form in the inner disk. On the contrary, a secondary spiral arm is unlikely to form in the outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully accounting for the global behavior of both the phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally support the recently proposed WKB phase argument for the secondary arm origin (as caused by the intricacy of constructive interference of the azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation at different radii). We provide analytical arguments showing that the process of a single spiral wake splitting up into multiple arms is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in differentially rotating disks. It is not unique to planet-driven waves and also occurs in linear calculations of spiral wakes freely propagating with no external torques. These results are relevant for understanding formation of multiple rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks.\n\nWe present H-band polarized scattered light imagery and JHK high-contrast spectroscopy of the protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 observed with the High-Contrast Coronographic Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) and Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO)/Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) instruments at Subaru Observatory. The polarimetric imagery resolve a broken ring structure surrounding HD 163296 that peaks at a distance along the major axis of 0 65 (66 au) and extends out to 0 98 (100 au) along the major axis. Our 2011 H-band data exhibit clear axisymmetry, with the NW and SE side of the disk exhibiting similar intensities. Our data are clearly different from 2016 epoch H-band observations of the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE), which found a strong 2.7× asymmetry between the NW and SE side of the disk. Collectively, these results indicate the presence of time-variable, non-azimuthally symmetric illumination of the outer disk. While our SCExAO/CHARIS data are sensitive enough to recover the planet candidate identified from NIRC2 in the thermal infrared (IR), we fail to detect an object with JHK brightness nominally consistent with this object. This suggests that the candidate is either fainter in JHK bands than model predictions, possibly due to extinction from the disk or atmospheric dust/clouds, or that it is an artifact of the data set/data processing, such as a residual speckle or partially subtracted disk feature. Assuming standard hot-start evolutionary models and a system age of 5 Myr, we set new, direct mass limits for the inner (outer) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)-predicted protoplanet candidate along the major (minor) disk axis of of 1.5 (2) MJ.\n\nThe remanent magnetization of solar system bodies reflects their accretion mechanism, the space environment in which they formed, and their subsequent geological evolution. In particular, it has been suggested that some primitive bodies may have formed large regions of coherent remanent magnetization as a consequence of their accretion in a background magnetic field. Measurements acquired by the Rosetta Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor have shown that comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P) has a surface magnetic field of less than 0.9 nT. To constrain the spatial scale and intensity of remanent magnetization in 67P, we modeled its magnetic field assuming various characteristic spatial scales of uniform magnetization. We find that for regions of coherent magnetization with ≥10 cm radius, the specific magnetic moment is ≲5 × 10−6 . If 67P formed during the lifetime of the solar nebula and has not undergone significant subsequent collisional or aqueous alteration, this very low specific magnetization is inconsistent with its formation from the gentle gravitational collapse of a cloud of millimeter-sized pebbles in a background magnetic field ≳3 μT. Given the evidence from other Rosetta instruments that 67P formed by pebble-pile processes, this would indicate that the nebular magnetic field was ≲3 μT at 15–45 au from the young Sun. This constraint is consistent with theories of magnetically driven evolution of protoplanetary disks.\n\nPlanet formation simulations are capable of directly integrating the evolution of hundreds to thousands of planetary embryos and planetesimals as they accrete pairwise to become planets. In principle, these investigations allow us to better understand the final configuration and geochemistry of the terrestrial planets, and also to place our solar system in the context of other exosolar systems. While these simulations classically prescribe collisions to result in perfect mergers, recent computational advances have begun to allow for more complex outcomes to be implemented. Here we apply machine learning to a large but sparse database of giant impact studies, which allows us to streamline the simulations into a classifier of collision outcomes and a regressor of accretion efficiency. The classifier maps a four-dimensional (4D) parameter space (target mass, projectile-to-target mass ratio, impact velocity, impact angle) into the four major collision types: merger, graze-and-merge, hit-and-run, and disruption. The definition of the four regimes and their boundary is fully data-driven. The results do not suffer from any model assumption in the fitting. The classifier maps the structure of the parameter space and it provides insights into the outcome regimes. The regressor is a neural network that is trained to closely mimic the functional relationship between the 4D space of collision parameters, and a real-variable outcome, the mass of the largest remnant. This work is a prototype of a more complete surrogate model, that will be based on extended sets of simulations (big data), that will quickly and reliably predict specific collision outcomes for use in realistic N-body dynamical studies of planetary formation.\n\nWe employ the accretion disk reflection model relxill_nk to test the spacetime geometry around the stellar-mass black hole in GRS 1915+105. We adopt the Johannsen metric with the deformation parameters α13 and α22, for which the Kerr solution is recovered when α13 = α22 = 0. We analyze a NuSTAR observation of 2012, obtaining vanishing and non-vanishing values of the deformation parameters depending on the astrophysical model adopted. Similar difficulties were not found in our previous tests with other sources. The results of this work can shed light on the choice of sources suitable for testing the Kerr metric using X-ray reflection spectroscopy and on the parts of our reflection models that more urgently require improvement.\n\nRecent spectroscopic analysis has set an upper limit on the age of the S-stars, the ∼30 B-type stars in highly eccentric orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic center. The inferred age (<15 Myr) is in tension with the binary breakup scenario proposed to explain their origin. However, the new estimate is compatible with the age of the disk of O-type stars that lies at a farther distance from the SMBH. Here, we investigate a new formation scenario, assuming that both S-stars and the O-type stars were born in the same disk around SgrA*. We simulate encounters between binaries of the stellar disk and stellar black holes from a dark cusp around SgrA*. We find that B-type binaries can be easily broken up by the encounters and their binary components are kicked into highly eccentric orbits around the SMBH. In contrast, O-type binaries are less frequently disrupted and their members remain in low-eccentricity orbits. This mechanism can reproduce 12 S-stars just by assuming that the binaries initially lie within the stellar disk as observed nowadays. To reproduce all the S-stars, the original disk must have been extended down to . However, in this case many B- and O-type stars remain in low-eccentricity orbits below , in contrast with the observations. Therefore, some other mechanism is necessary to disrupt the disk below . This scenario can also explain the high eccentricity of the G-objects, if they have a stellar origin.\n\nThe snow line in a protoplanetary disk demarcates regions with H2O ice from regions with H2O vapor. Where a planet forms relative to this location determines how much water and other volatiles it forms with. Giant-planet formation may be triggered at the water–snow line if vapor diffuses outward and is cold-trapped beyond the snow line faster than icy particles can drift inward. In this study, we investigate the distribution of water across the snow line, considering three different radial profiles of the turbulence parameter α(r), corresponding to three different angular momentum transport mechanisms. We consider the radial transport of water vapor and icy particles by diffusion, advection, and drift. We show that even for similar values of α, the gradient of α(r) across the snow line significantly changes the snow line location, the sharpness of the volatile gradient across the snow line, and the final water/rock ratio in planetary bodies. A profile of radially decreasing α, consistent with transport by hydrodynamic instabilities plus magnetic disk winds, appears consistent with the distribution of water in the solar nebula, with monotonically increasing radial water content and a diverse population of asteroids with different water content. We argue that Σ(r) and water abundance are likely a diagnostic of α(r) and thus of the mechanism for angular momentum transport in inner disks.\n\nWe have investigated the linear X-ray filament, G359.944−0.052, previously identified as a likely X-ray counterpart of a parsec-scale jet from the Galactic Center supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), using a total of ∼5.6 Ms ultra-deep Chandra observations taken from 1999 September to 2017 July. This unprecedented data set enables us to examine flux and spectral variations that might be related to intrinsic properties of the weakly accreting SMBH. We find no flux or spectral variation in G359.944−0.052 after the G2 periapsis passage around early 2014; however, a moderate flux increase of ∼2σ significance might be associated with the periapsis passage of G1 in early 2001. The filament exhibits an unusually hard spectrum (photon index ≲1) in its portion closest to Sgr A* (i.e., near side) and a significant spectral softening in the more distant portion, which can be interpreted as synchrotron cooling of the relativistic electrons moving along the jet path. In particular, the hard spectrum of the near side suggests a piling up of quasi-monoenergetic electrons caused by rapid radiative cooling. The spectral and temporal properties of G359.944−0.052 strengthen the case for it being the X-ray counterpart of a jet launched by Sgr A*.\n\nThe small class of known stars with unusually warm, dusty debris disks is a key sample to probe in order to understand cascade models and the extreme collisions that likely lead to the final configurations of planetary systems. Because of its extreme dustiness and small radius, the disk of BD +20 307 has a short predicted collision time and is therefore an interesting target in which to look for changes in dust quantity and composition over time. To compare with previous ground and Spitzer Space Telescope data, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) photometry and spectroscopy were obtained. The system's 8.8–12.5 μm infrared emission increased by 10 ± 2% over nine years between the SOFIA and earlier Spitzer measurements. In addition to an overall increase in infrared excess, there is a suggestion of a greater increase in flux at shorter wavelengths (less than 10.6 μm) compared to longer wavelengths (greater than 10.6 μm). Steady-state collisional cascade models cannot explain the increase in BD +20 307's disk flux over such short timescales. A catastrophic collision between planetary-scale bodies is still the most likely origin for the system's extreme dust; however, the cause for its recent variation requires further investigation.\n\nRobustly modeling the inner edge of the habitable zone is essential for determining the most promising potentially habitable exoplanets for atmospheric characterization. Global climate models (GCMs) have become the standard tool for calculating this boundary, but divergent results have emerged among the various GCMs. In this study, we perform an intercomparison of standard GCMs used in the field on a rapidly rotating planet receiving a G-star spectral energy distribution and on a tidally locked planet receiving an M-star spectral energy distribution. Experiments both with and without clouds are examined. We find relatively small difference (within 8 K) in global-mean surface temperature simulation among the models in the G-star case with clouds. In contrast, the global-mean surface temperature simulation in the M-star case is highly divergent (20–30 K). Moreover, even differences in the simulated surface temperature when clouds are turned off are significant. These differences are caused by differences in cloud simulation and/or radiative transfer, as well as complex interactions between atmospheric dynamics and these two processes. For example we find that an increase in atmospheric absorption of shortwave radiation can lead to higher relative humidity at high altitudes globally and, therefore, a significant decrease in planetary radiation emitted to space. This study emphasizes the importance of basing conclusions about planetary climate on simulations from a variety of GCMs and motivates the eventual comparison of GCM results with terrestrial exoplanet observations to improve their performance.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability is an essential large-scale mechanism to generate plasma waves along the boundary layers of Venus. In this paper, evolution of KH instability on the Venusian ionopause with the influence of the Hall effect was investigated under Hall magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Linear and nonlinear physical behaviors of KH instability with different wavelengths of perturbation, magnetic field configurations, and ion inertial lengths were studied. Numerical results indicate that, for perturbation with short wavelength, the circulation area of matter becomes small and the driving force is weakened. The combined effect of short wavelength and the antiparallel magnetic field leads to longer linear growth time, while the antiparallel magnetic field tends to enlarge the pressure gradient. As for the moderate wavelength of perturbation, the growth rate reaches its peak value, whereas the maximal y component of total kinetic energy increases significantly with the wavelength. Hall MHD simulations indicate that the Hall effect does not change the growth rates for different ion inertial lengths at all. However, the Hall effect has a depression effect on small structures at the nonlinear stage of KH instability.\n\nThe tilt, rotation, or offset of each CCD with respect to the focal plane, as well as the distortion of the focal plane itself, causes shape distortions in the observed objects, an effect typically known as field distortion (FD). We point out that FD provides a unique way of quantifying the accuracy of cosmic shear measurement. The idea is to stack the shear estimators from galaxies that share similar FD-induced shape distortions. Given that the latter can be calculated with parameters from astrometric calibrations, the accuracy of the shear estimator can be directly tested on real images. It provides a way to calibrate the multiplicative and additive shear recovery biases within the scientific data itself, without requiring simulations or any external data sets. We use the CFHTLenS images to test the Fourier_Quad shear recovery method. We highlight some details in our image-processing pipeline, including background removal, source identification and deblending, astrometric calibration, star selection for point-spread function reconstruction, noise reduction, etc. We show that in the shear ranges of −0.005 ≲ g1 ≲ 0.005 and −0.008 ≲ g2 ≲ 0.008, the multiplicative biases are at the level of ≲0.04. Slight additive biases on the order of ∼5 × 10−4 (6σ) are identified for sources provided by the official CFHTLenS catalog (not using its shear catalog), but are minor (4σ) for the source catalog generated by our Fourier_Quad pipeline.\n\nUnlike mergers of two compact objects containing a neutron star (NS), binary black hole (BBH) mergers are not accompanied by the production of tidally disrupted material and hence lack the most direct source of accretion to power a jet and generate electromagnetic (EM) radiation. However, following a tentative detection by the Fermi GBM of a γ-ray counterpart to GW150914, several ideas were proposed for driving a jet and producing EM radiation. If such jets were in fact produced, they would, however, lack the cocoon emission that makes jets from binary NSs also bright at large viewing angles. Here, via Monte Carlo simulations of a population of BBH mergers with properties consistent with those inferred from the existing LIGO/Virgo observations and the angular emission characteristic of jets propagating into the interstellar medium, we derive limits on the allowed energetics and Lorentz factors of such jets from EM follow-ups to GW-detected BBH merger events to date, and we make predictions that will help tighten these limits with broadband EM follow-ups to events in future LIGO/Virgo runs. The condition that ≲1 event out of 10 GW-detected BBH mergers be above the Fermi/GBM threshold imposes that any currently allowed emission model has to satisfy the condition (Eiso/1049 erg)(θjet/20°) ≲ 1.\n\nWe present the new calibration of black hole mass ( ) estimators based on the Mg iiλ2798 broad emission line using the Hβ reverberation-mapped (RM) sample of 31 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that have high-quality UV spectra. The updated and enlarged sample at redshift z < 0.16 covers a large dynamic range in (i.e., ) and bolometric luminosity (i.e., erg s−1). We also investigate the mass estimators by adding a sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project, which consists of 24 AGNs at a higher redshift range, z = 0.36–0.89. We determine the line width of the Mg ii line using FWHM or line dispersion (σline), which are respectively used for the recipe. Comparing with the Hβ reverberation masses, we provide several calibrations for the Mg ii–based mass, the best of which is consistent with the virial assumption and photoionization expectation (i.e., and ). The derived based the Mg ii estimator is consistent with the Hβ reverberation mass within a factor of 2.\n\nWe report on the accretion properties of low-mass stars in the LH 95 association within the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using noncontemporaneous wideband optical and narrowband Hα photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we identify 245 low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) candidates showing Hα excess emission above the 4σ level. We derive their physical parameters, including effective temperatures, luminosities, masses (M⋆), ages, accretion luminosities, and mass accretion rates ( ). We identify two different stellar populations: younger than ∼8 Myr with median yr−1 (and M⋆ ∼ 0.15–1.8 M⊙) and older than ∼8 Myr with median yr−1 (and M⋆ ∼ 0.6–1.2 M⊙). We find that the younger PMS candidates are assembled in groups around Be stars, while older PMS candidates are uniformly distributed within the region without evidence of clustering. We find that in LH 95 decreases with time more slowly than what is observed in Galactic star-forming regions (SFRs). This agrees with the recent interpretation, according to which higher metallicity limits the accretion process in both rate and duration due to higher radiation pressure. The –M⋆ relationship shows different behavior at different ages, becoming progressively steeper at older ages, indicating that the effects of mass and age on cannot be treated independently. With the aim to identify reliable correlations between mass, age, and , we used a multivariate linear regression fit between these parameters for our PMS candidates. The comparison between our results and those obtained in other SFRs of our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds confirms the importance of the metallicity for the study of the evolution in clusters with different environmental conditions.\n\nUsing the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 304 Å images obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we study two jets that occurred during the M5.8 class flare on 2017 April 3 and the M5.5 class flare on 2016 July 23, respectively. During the M5.8 class flare, many vortex-like structures occurred in the upstream and downstream regimes of the associated jet. While the jet was ejected upwards to the corona, some dark material at its base flowed through a bright structure with a velocity of 110 km s−1. The boundary between the material and the structure changed from smooth to uneven. Later, the jet material at the higher atmosphere started to fall down with velocities of over 200 km s−1, and the left boundary of the jet developed into a sawtooth pattern. The vortex-like structures were formed, and the growth rates of two structures were presented. During the M5.5 class flare, we also observed many vortex-like structures in the downstream regime of the jet. At the late stage of the jet, some material at the south boundary of the jet fell back to the solar surface, and vortex-like structures at the boundary grew from ripple-like minim into vortices with diameters of 3.4–5.4 Mm. The growth rates of the vortex-like structures were calculated. We suggest that the vortex-like structures in the upstream regime are the manifestations of Kelvin−Helmholtz instability, and those in the downstream regime are simultaneously driven by Kelvin−Helmholtz instability and Raleigh−Taylor instability.\n\nWe have analyzed how anisotropic emission of radiation affects the observed sample of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) by performing simulations of the evolution of stellar populations, employing recent developments in stellar and binary physics, and by utilizing a geometrical beaming model motivated by theory and observation. While ULXs harboring black hole accretors (BH ULXs) are typically emitting isotropically, the majority of ULXs with neutron star accretors (NS ULXs) are found to be beamed. These findings confirm previous assertions that a significant fraction of ULXs are hidden from view due to a substantial misalignment of the emission beam and the line of sight. We find the total number of NS ULXs in regions with constant star formation (SF), solar metallicity, and ages above to be higher than the BH ULXs, although observationally both populations are comparable. For lower metallicities, BH ULX dominate both the total and observed ULX populations. As far as burst SF is concerned, young ULX populations are dominated by BH ULXs, but this changes as the population ages and, post SF, NS ULXs dominate both the observed and total ULX populations. We also compare our simulation output to a previous analytical prediction for the relative ratio of BH to NS ULXs in idealized flux-limited observations and find broad agreement for all but the lowest metallicities. In so doing, we find that in such surveys the observed ULX population should be heavily dominated by black hole systems rather than by systems containing neutron stars.\n\nNumerous observations indicate that galaxies need a continuous gas supply to fuel star formation and explain the star formation history. However, direct observational evidence of gas accretion remains rare. Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite, we study cold gas accretion onto galaxies and the observational signatures of the cold gas kinematics. For EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.27, we find that cold gas accretes onto galaxies anisotropically with typical inflow speeds between 20 and 60 km s−1. Most of these galaxies have comparable mass inflow rates and star formation rates, implying that the cold inflowing gas plausibly accounts for sustaining the star-forming activities of the galaxies. As motivation for future work to compare the cold gas kinematics with measurements from quasar sightline observations, we select an EAGLE galaxy with an extended cold gas disk, and we probe the cold gas using mock quasar sightlines. We demonstrate that by viewing the disk edge on, sightlines at azimuthal angles below 10° and impact parameters out to 60 pkpc can detect cold gas that corotates with the galaxy disk. This example suggests that cold gas disks extending beyond the optical disks possibly explain the sightline observations that detect corotating cold gas near galaxy major axes.\n\nModeling the submillimeter to centimeter emission of stars is challenging due to a lack of sensitive observations at these long wavelengths. We launched an ongoing campaign to obtain new observations entitled Measuring the Emission of Stellar Atmospheres at Submillimeter/millimeter wavelengths (MESAS). Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, Green Bank Telescope, and Very Large Array observations of Sirius A, the closest main-sequence A-type star, that span from 1.4 to 9.0 mm. These observations complement our previous millimeter data on Sirius A and are entirely consistent with the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models constructed to explain them. We note that accurate models of long-wavelength emission from stars are essential not only to understand fundamental stellar processes, but also to determine the presence of dusty debris in spatially unresolved observations of circumstellar disks.\n\nAstrophysical black hole systems are the ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of gravity in the strong field regime. We have recently developed a framework that uses the reflection spectrum of black hole systems to perform precision tests of general relativity by testing the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In this paper, we analyze XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the supermassive black hole in the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG–06–30–15 with our disk reflection model. We consider the Johannsen metric with the deformation parameters α13 and α22, which quantify deviations from the Kerr metric. For α22 = 0, we obtain the black hole spin and . For α13 = 0, we obtain and . The Kerr solution is recovered for α13 = α22 = 0. Thus, our results include the Kerr solution within statistical uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are difficult to account for, and we discuss some issues in this regard.\n\nThe Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) waves predominantly excited at the Earth's low-latitude magnetopause were suggested to be dawn–dusk asymmetric. We report a prolonged simultaneous observations of the K-H waves on the dawn and dusk magnetopause by Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and THEMIS-A (THA) spacecraft, respectively. The quasi-periodic K-H waves on both flanks have unambiguous low-density and high-speed patterns. The wave periods vary gradually on both flanks, with similar average periods (303 ± 107 s for MMS and 266 ± 102 s for THA). The lag time between the variations of the wave periods is close to the wave propagation time from THA to MMS, which suggests that the K-H waves generate and propagate quasi-symmetrically on both flanks. Larger local magnetic shear angles are observed on the trailing edges by MMS than by THA, which is probably due to the strong magnetic field distortion during the tailward propagation. The increased magnetic shear may excite magnetic reconnection, thus contributing to the formation of the low-latitude boundary layer.\n\nCompact ellipticals (cEs) are outliers from the scaling relations of early-type galaxies, particularly the mass–metallicity relation, which is an important outcome of feedback. The formation of such low-mass, but metal-rich and compact, objects is a long-standing puzzle. Using a pair of high-resolution N-body+gas simulations, we investigate the evolution of a gas-rich low-mass galaxy on a highly radial orbit around a massive host galaxy. As the infalling low-mass galaxy passes through the host's corona at supersonic speeds, its diffuse gas outskirts are stripped by ram pressure, as expected. However, the compactness increases rapidly because of bursty star formation in the gas tidally driven to the center. The metal-rich gas produced by supernovae and stellar winds is confined by the ram pressure from the surrounding environment, leading to subsequent generations of stars being more metal-rich. After the gas is depleted, tidal interactions enhance the metallicity further via the stripping of weakly bound, old, and metal-poor stars, while the size of the satellite is changed only modestly. The outcome is a metal-rich cE that is consistent with observations. These results argue that classical cEs are neither the stripped remnants of much more massive galaxies nor the merger remnants of normal dwarfs. We present observable predictions that can be used to test our model.\n\nWe describe the gravitational-wave (GW) follow-up strategy and subsequent results of the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey (DLT40) during the second science run (O2) of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory and Virgo collaboration (LVC). Depending on the information provided in the GW alert together with the localization map sent by the LVC, DLT40 would respond promptly to image the corresponding galaxies selected by our ranking algorithm in order to search for possible electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in real time. During the LVC O2 run, DLT40 followed 10 GW triggers, observing between ∼20 and 100 galaxies within the GW localization area of each event. From this campaign, we identified two real transient sources within the GW localizations with an appropriate on-source time—one was an unrelated SN Ia (SN 2017cbv), and the other was the optical kilonova, AT 2017fgo/SSS17a/DLT17ck, associated with the binary neutron star (BNS) coalescence GW170817 (a.k.a gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A). We conclude with a discussion of the DLT40 survey's plans for the upcoming LVC O3 run, which include expanding our galaxy search fields out to D ≈ 65 Mpc to match the LVC's planned three-detector sensitivity for BNS mergers.\n\nWe investigate the kinematic alignments of luminous early-type galaxies (Mr ≤ −19.5 mag) in A119 and A168 using the kinematic position angles ( ) from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field spectrograph (SAMI) survey data, motivated by the implication of the galaxy spin alignment in a cosmological context. To increase the size of our sample for statistical significance, we also use the photometric position angles ( ) for galaxies that have not been observed by SAMI, if their ellipticities are higher than 0.15. Our luminous early-type galaxies tend to prefer the specific position angles in both clusters, confirming the results of Kim et al., who recently found the kinematic alignment of early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster based on the ATLAS3D integral-field spectroscopic data. This alignment signal is more prominent for galaxies in the projected phase-space regions dominated by infalling populations. Furthermore, the alignment angles are closely related to the directions of the filamentary structures around clusters. The results lead us to conclude that many cluster early-type galaxies are likely to be accreted along filaments while maintaining their spin axes, which are predetermined before cluster infall.\n\nThere is now strong evidence that the close binary fraction (P < 104 days; a < 10 au) of solar-type stars (M1 ≈ 0.6–1.5 ) decreases significantly with metallicity. Although early surveys showed that the observed spectroscopic binary (SB) fractions in the galactic disk and halo are similar (e.g., Carney–Latham sample), these studies did not correct for incompleteness. In this study, we examine five different surveys and thoroughly account for their underlying selection biases to measure the intrinsic occurrence rate of close solar-type binaries. We reanalyze (1) a volume-limited sample of solar-type stars, (2) the Carney-Latham SB survey of high proper motion stars, (3) various SB samples of metal-poor giants, (4) the APOGEE survey of radial velocity (RV) variables, and (5) eclipsing binaries (EBs) discovered by Kepler. The observed APOGEE RV variability fraction and Kepler EB fraction both decrease by a factor of ≈4 across −1.0 < [Fe/H] < 0.5 at the 22σ and 9σ confidence levels, respectively. After correcting for incompleteness, all five samples/methods exhibit a quantitatively consistent anticorrelation between the intrinsic close binary fraction (a < 10 au) and metallicity: Fclose = 53% ± 12%, 40% ± 6%, 24% ± 4%, and 10% ± 3% at [Fe/H] = −3.0, −1.0, −0.2 (mean field metallicity), and +0.5, respectively. We present simple fragmentation models that explain why the close binary fraction of solar-type stars strongly decreases with metallicity while the wide binary fraction, close binary fraction of OB stars, and initial mass function are all relatively constant across −1.5 ≲ [Fe/H] < 0.5. The majority of solar-type stars with [Fe/H] ≲ −1.0 will interact with a stellar companion, which has profound implications for binary evolution in old and metal-poor environments such as the galactic halo, bulge, thick disk, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and high-redshift universe.\n\nWe analyze 12CO(J = 2−1), 13CO(J = 2−1), C18O (J = 2−1), and 1.3 mm continuum maps of the ρ Ophiuchi A photodissociation region (PDR) obtained with ALMA. Layered structures of the three CO isotopologues with an angular separation of 10'' = 6.6 × 10−3 pc = 1400 au are clearly detected around the Be star, S1 (i.e., each front of emission shifts from the near to far side in order of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O). We estimate the spatial variations of X(13CO)/X(C18O) abundance ratios, and find that the abundance ratio is as high as 40 near the emission front, and decreases to the typical value in the solar system of 5.5 on a small angular scale of 4'' = 2.6 × 10−3 pc = 560 au. We also find that the I(12CO(2−1))/I(13CO(2−1)) intensity ratio is very high (>21) in the flat-spectrum young stellar object, GY-51, located in the PDR. The enhancement of the ratios indicates that the UV radiation significantly affects the CO isotopologues via selective dissociation in the overall ρ Ophiuchi A PDR, and that the ρ Ophiuchi A PDR has a plane-parallel structure.\n\nWe present weak-lensing measurements using the first-year data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program on the Subaru telescope for eight galaxy clusters selected through their thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) signal measured at 148 GHz with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter experiment. The overlap between the two surveys in this work is 33.8 square degrees, before masking bright stars. The signal-to-noise ratio of individual cluster lensing measurements ranges from 2.2 to 8.7, with a total of 11.1 for the stacked cluster weak-lensing signal. We fit for an average weak-lensing mass distribution using three different profiles, a Navarro–Frenk–White profile, a dark-matter-only emulated profile, and a full cosmological hydrodynamic emulated profile. We interpret the differences among the masses inferred by these models as a systematic error of 10%, which is currently smaller than the statistical error. We obtain the ratio of the SZ-estimated mass to the lensing-estimated mass (the so-called hydrostatic mass bias 1−b) of , which is comparable to previous SZ-selected clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and from the Planck Satellite. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for cosmological parameters inferred from cluster abundances compared to cosmic microwave background primary anisotropy measurements.\n\nWe present results based on the optical R-band observations of the polarization of 280 stars distributed toward the dark globule LDN 1225. Parallaxes from Gaia data release 2 along with the polarization data of ∼200 stars have been used to (a) constrain the distance of LDN 1225 as 830 ± 83 pc, (b) determine the contribution of interstellar polarization, and (c) characterize the dust properties and delineate the magnetic field (B-field) morphology of LDN 1225. We find that B-fields are more organized and exhibit a small dispersion of 12°. Using the 12CO molecular line data from the Purple Mountain Observatory, along with the column density and dispersion in B-fields, we estimate the B-field strength to be ∼56 ± 10 μG, the ratio of magnetic to turbulent pressure to be ∼3 ± 2, and the ratio of mass to magnetic flux (in units of the critical value) to be <1. These results indicate the dominant role of B-fields in comparison to turbulence and gravity in rendering the cloud support. B-fields are aligned parallel to the low-density parts (traced by a 12CO map) of the cloud; in contrast, they are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the high-density core structures (traced by 13CO and C18O maps). LDN 1225 hosts two 70 μm sources, which seem to be low-mass Class 0 sources. The ratio of total to selective extinction derived using optical and near-infrared photometric data is found to be anomalous (RV = 3.4), suggesting the growth of dust grains in LDN 1225. The polarization efficiency of dust grains follows a power law with an index of −0.7, implying that optical polarimetry traces B-fields in the outer parts of the cloud.\n\nWe present new, deep (245 ks) Chandra observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 1664 (z = 0.1283). These images reveal rich structure, including elongation and accompanying compressions of the X-ray isophotes in the NE–SW direction, suggesting that the hot gas is sloshing in the gravitational potential. This sloshing has resulted in cold fronts, at distances of 50, 110, and 325 kpc from the cluster center. Our results indicate that the core of A1664 is highly disturbed, as the global metallicity and cooling time flatten at small radii, implying mixing on a range of scales. The central active galactic nucleus (AGN) appears to have recently undergone a mechanical outburst, as evidenced by our detection of cavities. These cavities are the X-ray manifestations of radio bubbles inflated by the AGN and may explain the motion of cold molecular CO clouds previously observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated mechanical power of the AGN, using the minimum energy required to inflate the cavities as a proxy, is erg s−1, which may be enough to drive the molecular gas flows, and offset the cooling luminosity of the intracluster medium, at erg s−1. This mechanical power is orders of magnitude higher than the measured upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN, suggesting that its black hole may be extremely massive and/or radiatively inefficient. We map temperature variations on the same spatial scale as the molecular gas and find that the most rapidly cooling gas is mostly coincident with the molecular gas reservoir centered on the brightest cluster galaxy's systemic velocity observed with ALMA and may be fueling cold accretion onto the central black hole.\n\nGaseous disks have been proposed as a mechanism for facilitating mergers of binary black holes. We explore circumbinary disk systems to determine the evolution of the central binary. To do so, we perform 3D, hydrodynamic, locally isothermal simulations of circumbinary disks on a Cartesian grid. We focus on binaries of equal mass ratios on fixed circular orbits. To investigate the orbital evolution of the binary, we examine the various torques exerted on the system. For the case where the disk plane and binary orbital plane are aligned, we find that the total torque is positive so that the semimajor axis of the binary increases. For the misaligned case, we run simulations with the binary orbital plane and disk midplane misaligned by 45° and find the same results—the binary grows. The timescale for the circumbinary disk to realign to the plane of the binary is consistent with the global viscous timescale of the disk.\n\nWe present new constraints on parameters of cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization derived from the EDGES High-Band spectrum (90–190 MHz). The parameters are probed by evaluating global 21 cm signals generated with the recently developed Global21cm tool. This tool uses neural networks trained and tested on ∼30,000 spectra produced with semi-numerical simulations that assume the standard thermal evolution of the cosmic microwave background and the intergalactic medium. From our analysis, we constrain at 68% (1) the minimum virial circular velocity of star-forming halos to Vc < 19.3 km s−1, (2) the X-ray heating efficiency of early sources to fX > 0.0042, and (3) the low-energy cutoff of the X-ray spectral energy distribution to νmin < 2.3 keV. We also constrain the star formation efficiency (f*), the electron scattering optical depth (τe), and the mean-free path of ionizing photons (Rmfp). We recompute the constraints after incorporating into the analysis four estimates for the neutral hydrogen fraction from high-z quasars and galaxies, and a prior on τe from Planck 2018. The largest impact of the external observations is on the parameters that most directly characterize reionization. Specifically, we derive the combined 68% constraints τe < 0.063 and Rmfp > 27.5 Mpc. The external observations also have a significant effect on Vc due to its degeneracy with τe, while the constraints on f*, fX, and νmin, remain primarily determined by EDGES.\n\nWe report the identification of the possible optical counterparts of five out of seven ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in the galaxy pair NGC 4490/4485. Using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data, we identified a single optical candidate for two ULXs (X-4 and X-7) and multiple optical candidates for the other three (X-2, X-3, and X-6) within ∼0 2 error radius at the 90% confidence level. Of the two remaining ULXs, X-1 has no HST imaging data, and photometry could not be performed due to the position of X-5 in NGC 4490. Absolute magnitudes (MV) of the optical candidates lie between −5.7 and −3.8. Color–magnitude diagrams have been used to investigate the properties of the counterparts and their environments. The locations of the counterparts of X-2, X-4, and X-6 suggest possible association with a nearby group of stars, while the others have no association with a star cluster or group of stars. For comparison purposes, we analyzed three previously unused archival XMM-Newton observations. The long-term X-ray light curves of the sources (except transient X-7) show variability by a factor of three on a timescale of more than a decade. The use of a disk blackbody model for the mass of the compact objects indicates that these objects most likely have masses in the range 10–15 M☉.\n\nThe rapidly growing statistical precision of galaxy surveys has led to a need for ever more precise predictions of the observables used to constrain cosmological and galaxy formation models. The primary avenue through which such predictions will be obtained is suites of numerical simulations. These simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to obtain the precision demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in order to ensure accuracy. In this paper, we present one such suite of simulations, forming the basis for the Aemulus Project, a collaboration devoted to precision emulation of galaxy survey observables. We have run a set of 75 (1.05 h−1 Gpc)3 simulations with mass resolution and force softening of and 20 h−1 kpc, respectively, in 47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter space allowed by the combination of recent cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Type Ia supernova results. We present convergence tests of several observables including spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering in redshift space, and matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these statistics are converged to 1% (2%) or to the sample variance of the statistic, whichever is larger, for halos with more than 500 (200) particles, respectively, and scales of r > 200 h−1 kpc in real space or k ∼ 3 h Mpc−1 in harmonic space for z ≤ 1. We find that the dominant source of uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200 particles and scales smaller than k ∼ 4 h Mpc−1. We provide the halo catalogs and snapshots detailed in this work to the community at https://AemulusProject.github.io.\n\nPrecise instrument calibration is critical to the success of 21 cm cosmology experiments. Unmitigated errors in calibration contaminate the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal, precluding a detection. Barry et al. characterized one class of inherent errors that emerge from calibrating to an incomplete sky model; however, it has been unclear if errors in the sky model affect the calibration of redundant arrays. In this paper, we show that redundant calibration is vulnerable to errors from sky model incompleteness even in the limit of perfect antenna positioning and identical beams. These errors are at a level that can overwhelm the EoR signal and prevent a detection in crucial power spectrum modes. Finally, we suggest error mitigation strategies with implications for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array.\n\nFilament eruptions, one of the most energetic explosions on the Sun, release large quantities of magnetized plasma into the interplanetary space. Hence, the understanding of the initiation and evolution of filament eruptions can provide broader implications for space weather and geospace climate. Here, we present a confined partial eruption of double-decker structure that consisted of two vertically separated filaments on 2016 April 16. Only the upper filament erupted, and the eruption was closely associated with an episode of flux cancellation, surrounding transient brightenings, and unambiguous tether-cutting reconnections of the overlying sheared loops. However, the lower filament was nearly intact through the eruption. Interestingly, the erupting material moved along large-scale external loops and eventually arrived at remote sites, indicating a confined partial eruption. All the results show that the partial eruption involved two magnetic reconnections at least, and the bottom magnetic cancellation and internal tether-cutting reconnections between filaments both play critical roles in triggering the eruption. We conjecture that the newly formed low-lying loops due to tether-cutting reconnections and the flare loops resulting from the partial eruption likely contribute to maintaining the equilibrium of the lower filament. It is also suggested that the restriction of some large-scale external magnetic structures is crucial to turn the successful partial eruption into a confined event.\n\nCoupled models of mantle thermal evolution, volcanism, outgassing, weathering, and climate evolution for Earth-like (in terms of size and composition) stagnant lid planets are used to assess their prospects for habitability. The results indicate that planetary CO2 budgets ranging from ≈3 orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to ≈1 order of magnitude larger, along with radiogenic heating budgets as large or larger than Earth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1–5 Gyr. The ability of stagnant lid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored; recovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere–ocean chemical exchange is possible. For a \"hard\" snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most CO2 outgassing takes place via metamorphic decarbonation of the crust, which occurs below the ice layer. However, for a \"soft\" snowball where there is exchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both hard and soft snowball states, there is a minimum CO2 budget needed for recovery; below this limit, any snowball state would be permanent. Thus, there is the possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate evolution, where planets with low CO2 budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be permanently stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start with a temperate climate will be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyr or more. Finally, the model results have important implications for future exoplanet missions, as they can guide observations to planets most likely to possess habitable climates.\n\nSmall hydrocarbons are an important organic reservoir in protost"
