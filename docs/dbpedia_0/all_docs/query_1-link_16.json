Moreover, a significant discrepancy in pharmacological and interventional strategies has been reported. Therefore, poor outcomes and more significant mortality have been shown in many diseases. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences in drug metabolism have also been described so that effectiveness could be different according to sex. However, awareness about the gender gap remains too scarce. Consequently, gender-specific guidelines are lacking, and the need for a sex-specific approach has become more evident in the last few years. This paper aims to evaluate different therapeutic approaches to managing the most common women’s diseases.\n\nKeywords: Cardiovascular drugs, Cardiovascular therapy, Gender, Gender differences, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, Sex, Women\n\nIntroduction\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the leading cause of mortality worldwide in both sexes.1 The purpose of guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of CVD by boards, working groups, and committees with international representativeness aimed at ensuring a plurality of perspectives regardless of race, ethnicity, and gender. In recent years, there has been increased inclusion of women among the authors of consensus documents and guidelines, although female representation remains consistently lower than that of males.2 Moreover, in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), women are numerically inferior to men, sometimes even in contradiction with epidemiology. The reduced percentage of women in enrolled patient populations results in many disadvantages, as data on women are numerically inferior to those relating to their male counterparts.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that, despite the widely acknowledged gender differences in the field of CVD, the perception persists in the collective imagination that women have some sort of protection from CVD. In reality, already from pre-menopause, the protection provided by sex hormones drastically decreases, making women even more vulnerable compared to men. In this regard, scientific societies have made considerable efforts to recognize the importance of CVD in women.1,2\n\nIn light of these considerations, it would be desirable to revise the current cardiology guidelines to take into account gender differences, especially regarding the different pharmacokinetics and dosing aspects of the main molecules used in the cardiovascular (CV) field. The purpose of this document is to highlight how differentiated clinical and therapeutic pathways based on gender could play an important role in improving the treatment and prevention of CVD.\n\nMenopause\n\nMenopause is a normal ageing phenomenon in women and consists of a gradual transition from the reproductive to the non-reproductive phase of life; it is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation and the diagnosis is made retrospectively after menstruation is absent for 12 months.3 Most women enter menopause at the median age of around 50 years, while menopause before the age of 40 years is defined as premature. As a result of the increasing life expectancy, many women spend at least one-third of their life in the post-menopausal stage.3–5 It represents a primary ovarian failure where there is a depletion of ovarian follicles, the primary source of oestrogens.5 Exposure to endogenous oestrogens during the reproductive years provides young women with protection against CVD, whereas the female cardiovascular risk increases significantly around 10 years after the time of the menopausal transition, superimposing the effect of ageing.6,7 The changing hormonal milieu, with the rapid loss of ovarian oestrogens and progesterone and the circulating androgens, may induce also sub-clinical (activation of the renin–angiotensin system and of the sympathetic nervous system, presence of coronary artery calcium, reduced compliance of the large arteries, alterations in rheological properties of plasma and platelet function) and overt changes in the cardiovascular system8–10 Additionally, complex interactions between oxidative stress and levels of L-arginine and ADMA may also influence endothelial dysfunction in menopause.11 The arterial actions of oestrogens, but also part of that of androgens through their aromatization into oestrogens, are mediated by the oestrogen receptors (ER)α and ERβ. Oestrogen receptors belong to the nuclear receptor family and act by transcriptional regulation in the nucleus, but also exert non-genomic/extranuclear actions.12 Besides the decline of oestrogens at menopause, abnormalities in the expression and/or function of ERs could contribute to the failure in protecting arteries during ageing.\n\nMenopause, besides, is an important cardiovascular risk factor, favouring a constellation of risk factors, such as an increase in fat mass with visceral obesity, Type 2 diabetes, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, dysregulation in glucose homeostasis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, and arterial hypertension.13,14 In particular, women with vasomotor symptoms during menopause seem to have an unfavourable cardiometabolic profile.6 Post-menopausal oestrogen deficiency may also have an overall negative effect on the reaction to stress7 Independent of ageing, menopausal status is associated with elevations in serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, and decreases in HDL cholesterol.13,14\n\nEmerging research also suggests that after menopause there is a loss of functional HDL cardioprotective properties.14 Hypertension is more common in younger men than women, but this trend is inverted at approximately 60 years of age; thereafter, hypertension is more common in women.15 The influence of menopause per se on blood pressure remains uncertain. Oestrogens influence the vascular system by inducing vasodilatation, inhibiting vascular remodelling processes, and modulating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic system16\n\nHowever, changes in the prevalence of hypertension in post-menopausal women might be due to ageing and not oestrogen deficiency.17 Post-menopausal women are particularly affected by obesity and have higher rates of severe obesity when compared to their male counterparts. Obesity is linked to hormonal, lifestyle, and environmental changes that occur during the menopausal transition.18\n\nCardiovascular diseases account for at least one-third of all deaths in women and half of deaths in women over 50 years.10 Indeed, the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) is lower in females than in males, but only up to menopause, when, especially after 65 years of age, the differences disappear19; women develop CVD when they are about 10 years older than men.20 However, an independent association of menopause per se with increased risk of CVD events has only been proven for early-onset menopause (<45 years).20 In the EPIC-CVD,21 post-menopausal women were not at higher CVD risk compared with pre-menopausal women, but earlier menopause was linearly associated with higher CVD risk (HR 1.02, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.01–1.03, P 0.001), as well as surgical menopause compared with those with natural menopause (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10–1.42, P < 0.001).22 Also in a pooled data analysis from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and the Jackson Heart Study early menopause was associated with an increased risk for CVD.23 In the ARIC study, compared with women with later onset of menopause, those with early menopause had elevated heart failure risk (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01–1.43).24 In the UK Biobank Cohort study, compared with women with natural menopause, women with natural menopause before 40 years (HR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.64, 3.45) or hysterectomy before 40 years (HR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.23, 2.07) had a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 16 studies encompassing 321 233 adults unveiled a notable link between experiencing menopause at a younger age and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. However, this association did not extend to the risk of CV mortality.25 However, in the Dutch HELIUS Study, the addition of early menopause to current eligibility criteria did not improve the detection of women at high CVD risk.26 In the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke, white women in natural menopause (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.31, 0.66) and surgical menopause (HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42, 0.99) had a reduced hazard of non-fatal events, compared to white men.27 We should also consider the reproductive life span (RLS), the period between onset of menarche and menopause. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a longer duration of reproductive years was associated with a lower risk of CVD, compared with a shorter duration (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.92).28 Also in the Malmo Diet Cancer Study, a shorter RLS was associated with an increased CVD risk (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06–1.34, P 0.004) and with a higher mortality risk. The association remained significant when specifically controlling for a history of hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy.29 Another Chinese study showed that the CVD risk was reduced by 3.8% for every 1-year increase in RLS.30 A systematic review confirmed that a shorter RLS is associated with a higher risk of CVD events.31 As regards surgical menopause, in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study survey, it was a strong predictor of CVD (HR 4.32, P < 0.001). In a systematic review and meta-analysis including 78 studies on 10 187 540 persons, the pooled relative risks of any stroke were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.34–1.50) after oophorectomy vs. no oophorectomy.32\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is acknowledged as the gold standard for the alleviation of the disabling vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Early HRT initiation confers a favourable effect on lipid profile,33 with increased medium-to-large HDL particle count and decreased small-to-medium LDL particle.34 It has not been clearly demonstrated, however, that HRT reduces blood pressure levels.34 In the past, it has been hypothesized that the protective effect of oestrogens could translate into improved CVD outcomes, buffering adverse effects of menopause, but, unfortunately, some trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit35,36 and others, i.e. the Women’s Health Initiative study in older post-menopausal women, described significant risks.37 It is increasingly recognized that hormone therapy is inappropriate for older post-menopausal women no longer displaying menopausal symptoms,37 and guidelines do not indicate HRT for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention.33 However, the magnitude and type of HRT-associated risks, including breast cancer, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, are rare (<10 events/10 000 women), not unique to HRT, and comparable with other medications38; some variables, such as the type of HRT, the time of initiation according to age and/or time since menopause, underlying health of target tissue, and duration of therapy should be considered.38 Meta-analyses of randomized trials show an increased risk of ischaemic stroke associated with the use of oral conjugated equine oestrogens, associated or not with medroxyprogesterone acetate, while the use of transdermal oestrogen therapy combined with progesterone seems safer,39 since they do not increase triglyceride concentrations and are not associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (oral oestrogens are contraindicated in women with a history of venous thromboembolism).13 The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is not increased and appears to be significantly reduced when HRT is started <10 years after menopause or before the age of 60.39 A population cohort in Reykjavik, Iceland, showed the lowest coronary artery calcium in those who started HRT within 5 years after menopause.40 In contrast, in the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program neither the timing of hormone therapy initiation nor the duration of therapy is significantly associated with MI risk.41 The current international guidelines recommend women with early menopause use HRT until the average age of menopause.42 One should carefully consider these factors before starting HRT, which may still have a role in the prevention of CVD if given to the right woman and at the right time.43 For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of HRT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration44 with a multidisciplinary approach, adequately monitoring and treating risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia.45\n\nPharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences in the elderly\n\nDue to the ageing of populations, clinical practice is increasingly challenged by the associated variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This condition is evidenced by the excess incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in older patients, which are found in up to 46% of hospitalized elderly.46\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAgeing per se does not affect gastric acid secretion; however, 50 to 80% of older patients exhibit HP-related atrophic lesions, with ensuing impaired acid secretion.47 Also, ageing is associated with delayed gastric emptying and small bowel transit.47 Noticeably, studies on middle-aged subjects indicated delayed gastric emptying in women as compared with men.48 Eventually, bicarbonate secretion is reduced in older women, but not men.49 The combined effect of such alterations is often unpredictable.50 For instance, absorption of dabigatran should be hindered in advanced age because of increased gastric pH. Nevertheless, in older subjects, its area under the curve is increased by 40–60%, and Cmax by 25.\n\nSerum proteins, particularly albumin, are reduced in advanced age. As unbound drug concentration is a major determinant of pharmacodynamic activity, the effect of drugs with high protein binding (such as warfarin, bound rate 98–99%) is enhanced; this phenomenon is not observed for agents with lower protein binding, such as flecainide (protein-bound fraction 40%).51\n\nWith ageing lean mass decreases, and total fat increases, particularly in older women. Thus, the concentration of hydrophilic agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid, digoxin, or direct oral anticoagulants is increased. Conversely, lipophilic agents accumulate in fat tissue. For instance, in long-term users, amiodarone concentrations are up to 266 times higher in fat than in plasma.52\n\nLiver mass declines by 10–15% per decade in women, with 60% reduction in hepatic flow in both sexes. However, hepatic metabolism is substantially unaffected by age.47\n\nSeveral cytochromes decrease with ageing, while CYP3A activity is substantially higher in older women than in men.53 The effects of such modifications are still uncertain. Hepatic expression of P glycoprotein is 2.4-fold lower in women, yet its activity at the blood-brain barrier declines in men but not in women. This might account for the increased risk of confusion by cardiovascular drugs, including Class IC anti-arrhythmics.\n\nRenal function declines with ageing at an increased rate in women; nevertheless, the rate of decline is extremely variable, and in several cases, no age-related reduction is observed.54 The assessment of renal function from serum creatinine is concealed by decreased muscle mass in older women55; the use of cystatin C might overcome this limitation.56\n\nPharmacodynamics\n\nPharmacodynamics in older age is affected by changes in receptor expression and affinity, second messenger response and cellular and homeostatic regulation.57\n\nThe effects of similar concentrations at the site of action might change due to changes in drug-receptor interaction, post-receptor events, or homeostatic responses; frail subjects are often also due to organ damage.58 For instance, PR or QT prolongation from anti-depressants, neuroleptics, or other CNS drugs is almost exclusively found in older subjects. Polypharmacy accounts for most ADRs in the elderly59; nevertheless, ageing per se is associated with common ADRs, such as hypokalaemia from intravenous furosemide, or delirium from antibiotics, anti-arrhythmics, or digoxin.60 These reactions derive from variations in renal tubular secretion, intracellular free calcium levels, blood-brain barrier permeability, and post-synaptic choline content. Also, peripherial alpha-adrenergic secretion and receptor expression are reduced in advanced age, so orthostatic hypotension from calcium antagonists or alpha-adrenergic blockers is common. For the same reason, even though older patients are less sensitive to the cardiac effects of beta-blockers because of reduced expression of beta receptors, orthostatic hypotension is a frequent ADR of these agents.\n\nTo conclude, older women might be at increased risk of toxicity, mainly because of increased drug serum levels; nevertheless, data from specific studies are needed to clarify the pitfalls of drug therapy in this population.\n\nHeart failure\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide, and its incidence has been stable over the years despite recent drug and device advancements.61 It has been well recognized that several gender discrepancies exist affecting clinical features and prognosis, with major mortality in men, although women are more likely to have more hospitalizations.62\n\nIt has been shown that females are more likely to be older than men when HF occurs. Moreover, sex-specific risk factors, including early menopause, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive disorders, have been reported to have a role in the development of HF in women.5 Anaemia, a common comorbidity in HF, has been shown to occur more commonly in women than men, especially during fertile age.63\n\nMoreover, it has been shown that females are more likely to be affected by HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), differently from men who more frequently experienced HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).64,65 HFpEF is more common in post-menopausal women,66 suggesting the role of endogenous oestrogen.\n\nDespite the more severe symptoms and the worse functional status occurring in women with HF, they seem to have a better prognosis and lower mortality compared to men.67,68\n\nMoreover, women experienced some physiological changes during pregnancy related to the cardiovascular remodelling for the volume overload that could represent a sort of training for the heart, resulting in preventing or improving HF if it occurs.69 Furthermore, hypertension and lung disease, more common in women, are classically described as risk factors for HFpEF, also explaining the strict association among sex, comorbidities, and HF aetiology.\n\nLastly, in consideration of the different clinical courses of the disease, it has been noted that HF in women appeared clinically more severe, with more symptoms and worse functional class, expressed by New York Heart Association (NYHA) III or IV.70 Despite the severity of symptoms, women with HF have a better prognosis compared to males, and the female sex seems to be an independent predictor of lower mortality in HFpEF patients.68 These data have also been confirmed when HFrEF has been considered, even in the case of ischaemic aetiology or advanced systolic dysfunction.67\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme-I, ARB, beta-blockers in HF\n\nPhysiologically, sex hormones elicit distinct effects on adrenergic receptors and the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Oestrogens and progesterone confer cardioprotective benefits by suppressing the cardiac expression of β1-adrenoceptors and attenuating β-adrenergic-mediated stimulation.71,72 Regarding the RAAS, oestrogens elevate angiotensinogen and angiotensin II levels but concurrently decrease ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) activity and the expression of angiotensin II Type 1 receptors. Conversely, androgens exert an up-regulatory influence on the RAAS.73–75 These effects partially contribute to the cardioprotective influence of oestrogen observed during the pre-menopausal phase with respect to cardiovascular diseases.\n\nSex-related differences affect the pharmacokinetics of ACE-I, ARBs, and beta-blockers, which have a decreased drug clearance in females than males due to a smaller volume distribution and reduced glomerular and hepatic filtration. Accordingly, after administering a similar dose, maximum plasma concentration may be up to 2.5 times higher in females than males.76–78 Additionally, contraceptive therapy can affect metoprolol metabolism with further increases in plasma levels.79 Thus, a greater reduction in heart rate and blood pressure and a significantly increased risk of bradycardia have been reported in women.80\n\nConsequently, due to these different sex-related pharmacokinetic characteristics and sex hormones, females are more likely to experience side adverse effects, with a 1.5–1.7-fold higher incidence than in men.78\n\nDue to the under-representation of women in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in observational registries, assessing drugs’ effects on women is more challenging than on men.\n\nRCTs (CONSENSUS, SAVE, SOLVD) suggested a reduction of mortality in males but not in females81–83 ( ). Meta-analytic data, however, did not find differences between sex in treatment effect for ACE-I and ARBs.84 These data have further been confirmed in a recent meta-analysis from 7 RCTs showing no difference in the ACE-I or ARB's treatment between sex in all-cause mortality and the combined outcome of mortality and HF hospitalization.85 HF guidelines recommend up-titration of these drugs to the same target dose in both sexes. However, two post-doc analyses from the HEAAL86 and ATLAS87 studies have shown that a lower dosage in women was equally effective compared to higher dosages. The importance of dose-dependent differences between sexes is further highlighted by the BIOSTAT-CHF study,88 showing that men achieved the greatest reduction in the risk of death or hospitalization for HF at 100% of the recommended dose of ACE-I or ARBs, while women the lowest risk of death or hospitalization for HF at 40–60% the guideline-recommended doses. The most relevant observation was that, in women, there was no further decrease in risk at higher dose levels.88 In contrast, up-titration may significantly increase the risk of adverse events.\n\nTable 1\n\nReferenceYearSettingMain findingsHendrix et al.200572 351 hypertensive patients from 262 primary care providers at 69 sites in the US SoutheastWomen received fewer statin prescriptions than men (47.7% vs. 65.1%, P ≤ 0.0001)Koopman et al.2013Pharmo database (1 203 290 persons ≥25 years eligible for primary prevention, 84 621 persons hospitalized for an ACS, and 15 651 persons eligible for secondary prevention)The proportion of women using lipid-lowering drugs in primary prevention was lower than menGupta et al.2016Large hospital database in IndiaStatin use was significantly lower in women (5.8%) than men (10.3%)Ballo et al.20162088 consecutive patients discharged from 5 local community hospitals with a definite diagnosis of HFWomen showed a lower statin prescription rate (25.7% vs. 35.3%, P < 0.0001) and a lower prevalence of adequate statin dose (32.6% vs. 42.3%, P < 0.0001) than men.

Importantly, similar to ACE-I, women needed lower doses of beta-blockers than males (50–60% of the target doses) to achieve the same reduction of the outcomes.88\n\nDiuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists\n\nLoop diuretics are considered the mainstay of the treatment of volume overload in patients with HF and are recommended to reduce signs and symptoms of congestion.94 It has been shown that women with HF are prescribed comparable diuretic treatment regimens to men, albeit at lower dosages, regardless of whether they exhibit preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).95,96 Gender-specific differences have been observed in pharmacokinetics for torasemide, which was shown to have a clearance one-third lower in women than in men, thus resulting in higher peak and mean plasma concentrations.97 Similarly, animal studies showed that females have higher natriuretic, kaliuretic, and diuretic responses to furosemide.98 These findings could partially explain the higher incidence of adverse drug events for diuretics among women.99,100 Indeed, women hospitalized for acute decompensated HF are more likely to develop acute kidney injury despite receiving significantly less furosemide than men.96 These data could warrant closer monitoring of renal function and potassium after treatment initiation.\n\nNo sex-related differences in outcomes have been reported for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in HFrEF.101,102\n\nIn HFpEF, in a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT-Americas, treatment with spironolactone was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in females but not in males103 suggesting that differences in the biological activity of spironolactone in the kidney and the myocardium could account for a sex-specific benefit.104,105\n\nHowever, a meta-analysis using individual patient data from three large RCTs (RALES, EMPHASIS-HF, and TOPCAT) representing the full spectrum of LVEF did not confirm the previous evidence on sex-related differences in treatment response to MRA in patients with HFpEF.106 In this analysis, MRA treatment led to similar risk reductions of cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization in women and males (31% vs. 29%), regardless of their NYHA class, LVEF, and other confounding factors. Indeed, there were significant differences in clinical features between sexes, with women being older, with poorer NYHA functional class, and more likely suffering from hypertension and worsening renal function. The treatment effect was consistent between men and women, even in three subgroups of patients at particularly high risk, such as the elderly, patients with diabetes, and those with a low eGFR. Notably, sex-related differences in the occurrence of MRA-associated side effects did not emerge in this meta-analysis, and there was no specific impact of sex on hyperkalaemia and worsening renal function.106\n\nAngiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor\n\nSex differences in pathophysiologic mechanisms of HF, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs may impact pharmacological treatment benefits in HF. Sacubitril–valsartan, a drug class known as angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), has been tested in both HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF), in the PARADIGM-HF107 trial and the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (PARAGON-HF)108 trial, respectively. In the PARADIGM trial, of 8442 randomized, 1832 patients (21.7%) were females. The pre-specified subgroup analysis showed that ARNI reduced the primary endpoint (a composite of hospitalization for HF or cardiovascular death) regardless of patient sex (P for interaction = 0.63).107 However, ARNI clinical benefits in women appeared due to a reduction in hospital admissions without a significant effect on cardiovascular mortality.\n\nThe PARAGON-HF trial, which included 4796 patients (51.7% women), showed a trend towards a lower rate of the primary endpoint (a composite of hospitalizations for worsening HF and cardiovascular mortality) among patients treated with ARNI compared to those treated with valsartan, without to achieve a statistically significant difference between the two treatments arms. The pre-specified analysis that assessed endpoints according to sex found a lower rate of the primary endpoint in women treated with sacubitril–valsartan compared with those treated with valsartan alone [0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59–0.90] and no difference in the risk rate of the two treatment arms in men (1.03, 95% CI, 0.84–1.25; P-interaction = 0.017). In more detail, ARNI reduced hospitalizations, but not cardiovascular mortality, in females more than males. This result is potentially relevant since HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common HF phenotype in women. A sex-related difference in treatment effect by HF phenotype, preserved vs. reduced EF, has also been reported with other drugs, such as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in TOPCAT.109\n\nIn the pre-specified analysis that combined data from the PARADIGM-HF trial, which included patients with EF ≤40%, and the PARAGON-HF trial, which included patients with EF ≥45%, ARNI clinical benefits were shown to vary by EF with benefits in women that seem to extend at higher EF.110\n\nOf note, HFpEF is a clinical syndrome that may present with different clinical characteristics and have different prognoses. Since ARNI pharmacokinetics do not differ between females and males,111 other possible mechanisms have been postulated to explain the different effects of ARNI in men and women. For example, there are sex-related differences in natriuretic peptides biology, with a reduction in circulating NP concentrations after menopause.112 Indeed, in the PARAGON-HF trial, women, compared with men, were older (mean age 71.8 vs. 73.6 years, P < 0.001) and had lower NP levels [median value 1712 pg/mL vs. 1508 pg/mL, P < 0.001, in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and 575 pg/mL vs. 625, P 0.022, in patients without AF].108 By increasing NP levels, ARNI may have a greater therapeutic effect in females than in males. However, available data do not provide enough information to definite the mechanistic basis for the PARAGON-HF results in women. Since the female population in HF clinical trials is often under-represented, to provide robust sex-specific data on treatment effects and test the efficacy of a tailored treatment based on sex, specific measures to increase women's enrolment in clinical trials should be implemented.\n\nSodium–glucose cotransporter-2\n\nSodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have been shown to improve HF prognosis across the EF spectrum, first in patients with HF and reduced EF (HFrEF) with the Phase 3 trials Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF)113 and Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Reduced).114 These drugs were later shown to improve clinical outcomes in HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) in the EMPEROR-Preserved115 and the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER)116 trials. In all these trials, the risk of the primary outcome, which was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF, was lower in patients treated with gliflozin than in the placebo arm. For all trials, analyses on the efficacy and tolerability of gliflozins in men and women were performed.\n\nPatient-level data from DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials, which included 11 007 patients (35% women) overall, were analyzed together.117 This study showed that dapagliflozin had a similar impact on the primary and secondary endpoints (P-interaction = 0.77 and > 0.35, respectively) and had a similar safety profile in both men and women.\n\nThe EMPEROR-Reduced trial included 3730 patients (23.9% women). In this trial, the benefit of empagliflozin in terms of primary endpoint incidence reduction was consistent in the pre-specified analysis for sex [0.80 (0.68–0.93) and 0.59 (0.44–0.80) were the hazard ratio and CI in male and female subgroups, respectively].\n\nA recent study evaluated the impact of sex on empagliflozin effects in the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, which enrolled 5988 patients (44.7% women). The study showed that empagliflozin reduces the rate of the primary outcome similarly in both sexes (P-interaction = 0.54), with a benefit consistent across EF groups. The benefits of secondary outcomes and physiological measures, such as blood pressure, haemoglobin, and natriuretic peptide levels, were also similar.\n\nThese findings support the use of gliflozins in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF regardless of sex.\n\nCardiac resynchronization therapy\n\nThe benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on the outcomes of HF patients are well known.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of the data regarding gender-specific CRT effects is masked by the absence of prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials comparing responses in male vs. female CRT patients.118 Moreover, women were under-represented in the studies and are less than one-third of the total population.119 The reasons for this discrepancy can be the higher rates of HFpEF, for which CRT is not indicated, but also higher procedural complications and higher refusal rates to CRT implant in women than in men.120\n\nDespite these limitations, some observational studies (MADIT-CRT,121 MIRACLE,121 RAFT122) showed that women had a greater benefit from CRT than men. Also, a large English database with almost 44 000 patients (25% women) demonstrated that women lived longer and had less hospitalization for HF after CRT.123\n\nThere are multiple reasons for the sex difference in CRT-D outcomes related to the anatomy, electrical dyssynchrony, and aetiology of HF. Women had small ventricles with higher incidence of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and lower scar burden that could improve the response to CRT.124 Still, the effective relation between these factors and sex discrepancies remains unclear.125,126 Also, the role of the left bundle branch block is debated. A shorter QRS duration was observed in women with LBBB,127 and for any given QRS duration, women have greater electrical desynchrony with a consequence of greater CRT benefit. The use of cut-off based on trials with a high prevalence of male patients could deny a life-saving therapy to women likely to benefit from CRT.128\n\nAlso, other biological factors, such as hormonal differences and disparities in the cardiac autonomic system, could play a role in these discrepancies. Further studies are needed to understand sex differences and develop new strategies to tailor CRT therapy in our female patients.\n\nHeart transplantation\n\nHeart transplant (HTx) is the treatment of choice for patients affected by end-stage heart disease who have symptoms requiring frequent hospitalizations despite maximal medical therapy.94 Several studies have analyzed the sex differences in the waiting list and in the outcomes after HTx, despite females being under-represented in most of the trials on advanced HF.129 Effectively, despite women representing more than half of deaths due to HF, only a quarter of all would definitely have access to the HTx list.130 Moreover, women have had fewer opportunities to take advantage of temporary and permanent mechanical circulatory support along the time,131 receiving a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy only in less than one-third of cases.132\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to analyze the available data focused on gender discrepancy in relation to three important checkpoints in advanced HF management:\n\nHTx waiting list;\n\naccess to mechanical circulatory supports (MCS);\n\npost-HTx outcome.\n\nConcerning the data on HTx waiting list, women arrived at HTx more frequently for dilated cardiomyopathy (61.7%); conversely, CHD is the first reason for HF leading to HTx for men (48%).133 Different comorbidities affect the two sexes: men have more frequent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and kidney disease, both before and after HTx.133,134 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that women listed for HTx have an increased risk of death compared to men during waiting time; thus, the female sex is associated with higher mortality as United Network for Organ Sharing Status 1A (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.29) and 1B (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.30) according to an American report presented at the Scientific Meeting of HF.135 These data have been analyzed with the aim of adequately changing the allocation system, with the female recipients significantly younger than males (51 years old vs. 54 years old, respectively).133–136\n\nIn consideration of temporary or permanent supports, data demonstrated that women would have access to LVAD therapy only in a more advanced stage than men.137 Effectively, as demonstrated by an analysis of the multi-centre PCHF-VAD registry including 13 European HF tertiary referral centres, only 19% of LVAD patients were women, despite a huge number of females with advanced HF already reported in previous studies, suggesting its under-utilization.138 Moreover, female patients have access to LVAD when already in INTERMACS Profiles 1 or 2, thus in great delay for this kind of therapy.138,139 This later referral could justify the higher rate of complications after LVAD implantation, such as significant arrhythmias, major bleeding, or episodes of right-ventricular failure in women with LVAD compared to men,140 leading to a worse prognosis for the first one. For all these reasons, survival rates are lower in women than in men following LVAD implantation.130 On the contrary, survival rates following HTx are similar between the two sexes when adjusted for donor and recipient characteristics.141\n\nLastly, in relation to the outcome after HTx, cardiac transplanted women are more frequently affected by allograft HF, and they suffer more episodes of antibody-mediated rejections despite a low percentage of them developing cardiac allograft vasculopathy or malignancies of any grade. This could be explained by some sex-related differences, as far as the higher anti-HLA antibodies frequently detected in women.142 Anyway, the majority of studies available until now are focused on donor-recipient mismatch after HTx136; conversely, when sex-related differences are analyzed in the recipients, no difference emerged in survival and 1-year outcomes after HTx.143\n\nIn conclusion, women are under-represented in advanced HF therapies, such as left LVADs and HTx. However, the underlying reasons for this phenomenon remain uncertain, and it is unclear whether it stems from selection or referral biases or if certain sex-specific factors may be the primary contributing factors. Additional endeavours are warranted to address the gender-related obstacles in the context of HTx patients.\n\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection\n\nSpontaneous coronary dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of non-obstructive ischaemic heart disease in young to middle-aged women without traditional cardiovascular risk factors, particularly during pregnancy or the peripartum period.144 Women comprise 87–95% of all SCAD patients, with the mean age of presentation ranging from 44 to 53 years.145 SCAD should, therefore, be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in women. The higher prevalence of SCAD in female patients and the association with pregnancy advocate a pathophysiological role for female sex hormones. The exact nature of this relationship remains to be explained but may relate to sex-hormonal influences on vascular, smooth muscle, and/or the vessel microvasculature.\n\nThere are a large number of reported risk factors for SCAD other than female gender: fibromuscular dysplasia, arteriopathy, inflammatory diseases, connective tissue disorders, and emotional or physical stress.\n\nIn SCAD, spontaneous non-iatrogenic or trauma-related separation of the coronary wall occurs with the formation of a parietal haematoma within the tunica media that separates the intima from the vessel, resulting in compression of the true lumen and impairment of coronary blood flow.146 Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathophysiological process. There is an ‘inside-out’ hypothesis where an endothelial-intimal flap develops first, and then blood enters the sub-intimal space from the true lumen. More recently, intracoronary imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) seem instead to better support the ‘outside-in’ hypothesis where medial haemorrhage or rupture of the vasa vasorum within the tunica adventitia results in haemorrhage into the arterial wall and an intramural haematoma.\n\nThe gold standard for diagnosing SCAD is coronary angiography. The Yip-Saw angiographic classification divides it into three types.147 In SCAD Type 1, the contrast penetrates the false lumen, giving a double-lumen appearance. Type 2 is the most common and presents as a long, smooth stenosis. SCAD Type 2 is divided into Type 2A, where the narrowed segment of the coronary artery is followed by segments of normal calibre, and Type 2B, where the stenosis continues to the end of the affected coronary artery. Type 3 mimics focal stenosis of atherosclerotic disease and requires intracoronary imaging to distinguish. OCT is the imaging technique to be preferred because it allows a direct view of the walls of the coronary arteries but carries a certain risk as it can cause the dissection to spread, worsening the patient's clinical condition.\n\nManagement differs from ACS due to atherosclerosis with a first-line conservative approach recommended over percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Indeed, the natural history of SCAD appears to be gradual spontaneous healing of the vessel wall within a few weeks in most cases. In contrast, PCI is associated with worse outcomes and high complication rates in this setting. PCI should be performed only in case of ongoing myocardial ischaemia, persistent ST elevation, haemodynamic instability, and refractory ventricular arrhythmias, particularly when left main or the proximal coronary arteries are involved.144,148,149\n\nTo date, there are no definite indications about medical therapy, and recommendations are based only on expert consensus.144,148,149 Thrombolysis is contraindicated, and heparin use is discouraged. It is currently suggested single antiplatelet therapy in SCAD unless the patient receives coronary stenting and DAPT is indicated. Nevertheless, DAPT increases the bleeding risk and could theoretically determine the expansion of the intramuscular haematoma and extension of the dissection. Beta-blockers, ACE-I, or ARBs should be administered, whereas since SCAD is not due to atherosclerotic plaque statins, the prescription is controversial.\n\nTakotsubo syndrome\n\nTakotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient regional ventricular contractile dysfunction in the absence of culprit epicardial CAD that is frequently precipitated by acute emotional or physical stress.150 Although the precise pathophysiologic mechanism underlying this syndrome remains unknown, enhanced sympathetic stimulation resulting in microvascular dysfunction and/or direct myocyte injury is believed to have a role in the syndrome's pathogenesis.151 Takotsubo syndrome is not the benign condition it was previously considered to be. To date, it is well recognized that TTS has a heterogenous course with rates of in-hospital mortality reported in literature up to 15% in men and from 1 to 6% in women.152\n\nSince its first description in the early 1990s, many case series of TTS described the marked preponderance of women, approximately 90% of cases with a mean age of 65–75 years.153 The precise reason why older women are more affected remains unknown. It has been suggested that oestrogen depletion following menopause may play a role in the worsening of cardiac microvascular function and in putting post-menopausal women at particularly high risk of TTS during episodes of excessive sympathetic stimulation. However, data on the role of oestrogen in TTS remain conflicting.154 Although men clearly are the minority of reported cases, from the earliest literature evidence, men seemed to be more affected at younger ages, presented more physiological triggers, and more compromised clinical status at admission.155 An analysis of age-related variation in TTS reported that the prevalence of male patients increased with decreasing age and was highest in younger patients.156 These findings are in line with a prior study that suggested males are younger at the time of the index event.157 Interestingly, the prevalence of cardiogenic shock (CS) and the need for intensive cardiac care treatment, including catecholamine use and non-invasive and invasive ventilation, was particularly high in younger TTS patients. Moreover, younger patients had a numerically higher in-hospital mortality.156\n\nA recent analysis of 2492 patients included in the GEIST (German Italian Spanish Takotsubo) registry,158 confirmed that 11% were men. Men with TTS were significantly younger and with a higher prevalence of comorbidity (diabetes, pulmonary disease, malignancies, smoking habit). A physical trigger was more commonly reported in men (55% vs. 32%, P < 0.001), whereas the emotional one was more common in women (39% vs. 19%; P < 0.001). Electrocardiogram findings and ballooning pattern were the same in both genders. Men with TTS more frequently presented with CS (19% vs. 8%; P < 0.001) and had higher in-hospital mortality (7% vs. 2%; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the male sex is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, along with age, left ventricular EF, and CS. Male sex remains an independent predictor of long-term mortality.158\n\nHence, based on current observational evidence, it appears that men are less prone to developing TTS compared to women. However, when men do experience TTS, they tend to face more severe complications and a higher mortality rate, as illustrated in . Gender differences in epidemiology and outcome of TTS may be due to the different susceptibility and the degree of sympathetic stimulation needed to cause the TTS: only mild sympathetic stimulation may need to precipitate TTS in highly susceptible individuals such as post-menopausal women, and strong noradrenergic stimulation may be necessary to precipitate TTS in men who have lower resting sympathetic tone and less microvascular dysfunction, resulting in larger myocardial involvement and a higher incidence of pump failure and mortality.158 The reason why physical triggers were more frequently reported in male patients, whereas emotional triggers were more common in female patients, could be the consequence of different stress management strategies in men and women.\n\nIn patients with TTS presenting with CS, catecholamine, and inotropes should be avoided as they are considered to play a key role in TTS pathogenesis with a substantial risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In this setting, the use of MCS may represent a valid alternative. Recently a case series of 16 TS patients159 supported with an Impella pVAD were identified (mean age, 61.8 ± 15.5 years; 87.5% women). Left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation was severely reduced (mean, 19.4 ± 8.3%). Prior to MCS, 13 patients (81.3%) were mechanically ventilated, 4 patients (25.0%) had been resuscitated, and the mean serum lactate was 4.7 ± 3.5 mmol/L. Thirteen patients (81.3%) survived to discharge, and all survivors experienced cardiac recovery with significant improvement of LVEF at discharge compared to baseline (20.4 ± 8.8 vs. 52.9 ± 12.0, P < 0.001).\n\nIn the absence of evidence-based treatments, patients with TTS continue to have an increased risk of complications, morbidity, and mortality. Sex differences in all these mechanisms remain to be explored. New clinical evidence is needed to guide clinical decision-making and improve the quality of life and outcomes for patients with TTS.\n\nCardiogenic shock\n\nCardiogenic shock is a life-threatening syndrome defined by clinical and haemodynamic criteria. The prevalence of CS complicating MI is higher among women than men (11.6% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.01) but is still associated with a very high short-term mortality (≈50%).\n\nIn the clinical suspicion of CS, patient evaluation has to be fast and multiparametric to establish underlying aetiology and decide the appropriate timing of revascularization and therapy.160\n\nThe recent SCAI classification stratifies CS in five stages (A to E) from least to greatest severity: data regarding gender-associated differences are still insufficient.\n\nThe primary mechanism of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) in women is LV failure, caused by mechanical complications such as ventricular septal or papillary muscle rupture (women 7.7% vs. men 3.5%, P = 0.003) and severe mitral regurgitation (women 11.4% vs. men 7.1%, P = 0.014).161\n\nA large US nationwide analysis of AMI-CS patients (17 195, 37% women) showed that women received less guideline-recommended care and had worse in-hospital outcomes than men.162\n\nIn the CULPRIT SHOCK Trial, independent predictors for mortality in the AMI-CS female group within 30 days were older age, no previous PCI, high levels of creatinine, and LAD as culprit vessel.163\n\nMedical therapy in CS is based on catecholamines and inotropes/vasopressors with the aim of maintaining mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg, 8–12 H2O central VP, SvO2 > 65%, and diuresis > 70 mL/h. These agents increase myocardial oxygen demand and cardiac afterload, hence the need to confine medical therapy at the shortest duration and the lowest dose, given the array of available mechanical circulatory supports (MCS).\n\nThe most common temporary MCS devices available are intra-aortic balloon pumps, micro-axial flow pumps (Impella, Abiomed Inc., MA, USA) and the extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VA-ECMO).\n\nIABP-SHOCK II trial demonstrated that IABP, compared to medical therapy before revascularization, did not reduce 30-day mortality. IABP is still largely used due to its wide availability, beneficial haemodynamic effects, smaller sheath size and ease of insertion. However, it provides only 0.5 L/min flow.\n\nImpella is a percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) based on a microaxial pump to move blood from the left ventricle to ascending aorta, using a constant axial flow. It can generate up to 5.5 L/min and provides significant unloading of left ventricle.\n\nA recent systematic meta-analysis of six cohort studies comparing VA-ECMO to Impella in AMI-CS patients showed that Impella is associated with more reduction in short and medium term mortality and complication rates without statistical sex differences.164\n\nRecent European data on 978 CS patients (295 women) showed that female patients were medically treated but less likely to undergo pLVAD support. A potential reason hypothesized might be physicians’ reluctance to implant pLVAD, worried about higher complication risk in females due to their smaller body and thus vessel size, as pLVAD requires a large bore vessel access.165\n\nOptimizing pLVAD, for example, by adjusting the inflow cannula design specifically for female patients might reduce device-associated complications.\n\nAnyway, data are promising with the current generation devices.\n\nThe RECOVER III registry analyzed sex-based outcomes of 358 AMI-CS patients (82 women) receiving pLVAD pre-PCI: in-hospital adverse events were similar in women and men.\n\nWomen had better survival with pre-PCI pLVAD implantation without evidence of increased risk of access-related complications.166\n\nThe IMP-IT registry (Impella Mechanical Circulatory Support Device in Italy) showed that, among 406 patients, women with CS more frequently presented with other than ST-segment elevation MI aetiologies, including MI with non-obstructive CAD. Early pVAD support initiation pre-PCI was confirmed to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality.167\n\nMyocardial revascularization\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women as well as in men both in Europe and worldwide. Although there was a decrease in the global age-adjusted prevalence of CVD in women between 1990 and 2010, the condition has been rising since 2010, particularly the annual incidence of MI hospitalizations in younger women has increased.168–171\n\nDespite the fact that the guidelines for chronic CAD do not differ by sex, women with significant obstructive coronary disease less frequently receive guideline-recommended invasive treatment with PCI. Moreover, females treated with PCI tend to be older than males, with more cardiovascular risk factors.172 Several studies show that females who undergo PCI for angina have worse short-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality than males. However, this may, in part, relate to differences in baseline characteristics.173–175\n\nAn invasive strategy of early catheterization and revascularization improves the outcome of men with an NSTEMI when compared with a non-invasive approach. However, in women, the benefit of early invasive therapy appears to be more nuanced, as shown by a recent meta-analysis of contemporary trials.176 Of note, a clear benefit in 6-month outcomes emerged when the subgroup of women with elevated troponin levels was examined. A subsequent meta-analysis of eight trials found that an early invasive strategy had a similar benefit in high-risk (troponin-positive) women as it did in men. Still, that benefit could not be shown for lower risk (troponin-negative) women.177\n\nWomen with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) should be treated similarly to men. Women undergoing primary PCI have had higher rates of in-hospital and longer term mortality than men in both retrospective observational studies and subset analyses of randomized trials.178,179\n\nA recent meta-analysis of 35 studies involving 18 555 women and 49 981 men with STEMI treated with primary PCI found that women had higher risk for in-hospital and 1-year mortality even after adjusting for baseline differences and comorbidities, demonstrating the need for further improvements in invasive management in female patients.180\n\nOf note, both women and men have experienced improvements in mortality with the advent of modern, second-generation coronary drug-eluting stents.181\n\nLastly, data from DELTA registries show that in women undergoing coronary revascularization for unprotected left main CAD, coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with lower risk of death, MI, or cerebrovascular accidents. In contrast, no significant differences between coronary artery bypass grafting and PCI were observed in men.182\n\nWomen also have a greater risk of bleeding and peri-procedural complications. Despite the use of smaller sheaths and guiding catheters, their early removal and ‘radial first’ strategy for arterial access, in-hospital bleeding, and access-related vascular complications after PCI continue to be more frequent in women compared to their male counterparts. Although the increased bleeding risk in females remains a phenomenon not yet fully understood, the use of doses of anti-thrombotic drugs inappropriate for the body's surface area and renal function may partially explain it.183 The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after PCI is more frequent among women, partially due to the association with old age, diabetes, and hypertension, but also as an independent factor. Female gender is also a marker of <1-year survival after CIN in patients without pre-PCI chronic renal failure.184 Moreover, despite a lower in-hospital survival rate, women were less likely to receive mechanical cardiac support such as IABP, Impella, or ECMO, and the incidence of hospitalization for HF was higher among women during long-term follow-up, especially among patients who had undergone PCI.\n\nAnti-thrombotic therapy\n\nCompared to men, women have an increased platelet reactivity and a hypercoagulable state.184–186 Moreover, there are several sex-related differences in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of anti-thrombotic drugs due at least in part to hormonal status but also to different drugs absorption, distribution, and elimination.184–186\n\nAspirin\n\nDespite gender differences in response to aspirin,187 two meta-analyses have demonstrated that the benefits and the risk of bleeding from aspirin in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease were consistent across genders.188,189\n\nP2Y12 inhibitors\n\nClopidogrel\n\nThe CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events) trial, evaluating the effects of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin in patients with ACS without ST-segment elevation, showed a smaller relative risk reduction in MACE in women compared with men.190 Comparable results were found in the subgroup of patients who were scheduled to undergo PCI.191 However, a subsequent meta-analysis of several clopidogrel trials, including about 80 000 patients, showed a similar efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in women and men.192\n\nPrasugrel\n\nIn TRITON-TIMI 38 (trial to assess improvement in therapeutic outcomes by optimizing platelet inhibition with prasugrel-Trombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38) trial, prasugrel reduced MACE as compared with clopidogrel in ACS patients undergoing PCI, despite an increased risk of bleeding. No significant sex–treatment interaction was found despite a higher risk reduction of the primary endpoint with prasugrel in men as compared to women.193 The TRILOGY ACS (the Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial failed to demonstrate the superiority of prasugrel over clopidogrel for the reduction of ischaemic endpoints in medically managed ACS patients, with no significant heterogeneity observed between men and women.194\n\nTicagrelor\n\nThe PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial showed that ticagrelor was associated with a significant reduction in MACE compared to clopidogrel in patients with ACS intended for an invasive or medical approach.195 In this study, no significant sex difference has been observed in terms of both ischaemic or major bleeding events between genders.\n\nIntravenous antiplatelet agents\n\nIn a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, no differences were observed in MACE between sexes, but the incidence of bleedings with cangrelor was more frequent in females.196\n\nConcerning glycoproteins IIb/IIIa inhibitors, two meta-analyses of RCTs demonstrated no significant sex–treatment interaction.197,198\n\nUnfractionated heparin/low molecular weight heparin\n\nIt has been shown that women are more likely to reach higher activated partial thromboplastin time in response to unfractionated heparin (UFH).199 On the other hand, a post hoc analysis of the TIMI 11A (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 11A) study showed that neither pharmacokinetics nor pharmacodynamics after enoxaparin administration in ACS patients are affected by sex.200\n\nFondaparinux\n\nIn the OASIS-5 (Fifth Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes) trial, fondaparinux reduced major bleeding during long-term follow-up in ACS patients. Notably, women showed a higher reduction of major bleeding with fondaparinux, resulting in a trend for statistical interaction.201 The risk of the composite endpoint (death, MI, refractory ischaemia, and major bleeding) was reduced in both sexes to a similar degree.\n\nAlthough sex-based differences in thrombosis and platelet function, current evidence supports comparable benefits of anti-thrombotic therapy between genders. On the other hand, a higher incidence of bleeding has been consistently reported in women. Therefore, pharmacological strategies developed to minimize bleeding risk may be particularly suitable for women.\n\nDyslipidaemia\n\nStatins and ezetimibe\n\nA gender difference has been found in the achievement of target levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).202–204 In patients aged 60 years with ACS admitted to a tertiary hospital in Vietnam, i.e. the proportion of participants achieving LDL-C target after 3 months was 40.9% in women and 66.9% in men (P < 0.001, adjusted odds ratio, OR, 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.78).204 In a multi-centre cross-sectional survey conducted among patients with dyslipidaemia receiving statin therapy in Spain, LDL-C levels were higher in women than in men (3.5 ± 1.2 mmol/L vs. 3.1 ± 1.0 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Compliance with established goals for LDL-C (39.7% vs. 25.4%, P < 0.0001) was superior in men than in women.203 In 4288 patients with diabetes mellitus with LDL-C >100 mg/dL or taking statins, recruited for the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study from 2003 to 2007, LDL-C control was lower for black males and white and black females than for white males [prevalence ratios (95% CI): 0.85 (0.79–0.93), 0.89 (0.82–0.96), and 0.73 (0.67–0.80), respectively, P < 0.001].205\n\nIn a meta-analysis, however, the odds of achieving LDL-C < 100 mg/dL was significantly greater for women vs. men.202\n\nThis can be due to variances in clinical practice. Women are less likely to receive statins (in particular at high intensity) and/or ezetimibe treatment.206–214 Some recent data are, however, in contrast, namely in primary prevention.138,212,215–217 Results of some recent studies on statin/ezetimibe treatment according to gender are shown in .\n\nAdherence to statin/ezetimibe, side effects, and gender\n\nFurthermore, disparities between women and men in medication adherence may influence statin efficacy in cardiovascular prevention.218 In the VA healthcare system, women with peripheral artery disease (PAD) had lower statin adherence (PDC ≥ 0.8: 34.6% vs. 45.5%, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69–0.82) compared with men. Similar disparities were seen in ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) patients.219 Potential reasons for this gender difference can be observed both in intentional and unintentional non-adherence. Notable gender-specific contributing factors for statin non-adherence include decreased provider and patient awareness of cardiovascular risk and higher risk of statin intolerance among women, as well as competing demands associated with family caregiving responsibilities. The sex-dependent impact of adverse side effects is one of the reasons advocated for explaining the gender gap, but it is not evidence-proved. In the Understanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Patient Education survey, a self-administered, Internet-based questionnaire,220 more women reported switching or stopping a statin because of side effects compared with men. New or worsening muscle symptoms were reported in 31% of women compared with 26% of men (P < 0.01). The safety profile of subjects receiving ezetimibe plus statin was similar to that of patients receiving statin monotherapy and similar between the two sexes.221 In a meta-analysis, women reported significantly more gallbladder-related, gastrointestinal-related, and allergic reaction or rash-related adverse events vs. men (no differences between statins and ezetimibe). Men reported significantly more creatine kinase elevations (no differences between treatments) and hepatitis-related adverse events vs. women (significantly more with ezetimibe + simvastatin vs. statin).202\n\nLipid-lowering effects of statin/ezetimibe and gender\n\nThe effect of statins in reducing cholesterol seems independent of gender. In the VOYAGER study, investigating 32 258 patients, all statins and doses gave significant dose-dependent reductions in LDL-C and non-HDL-C, and increases in HDL-C, in both genders. A 2.1% greater reduction in LDL-C was observed in women compared with men (P < 0.0001). However, men experienced a significantly greater increase in HDL-C than women.222 In a recent meta-analysis,223 statin therapy reduced after 12 months lipid values in both sexes. Adding ezetimibe to basal statin therapy further reduced total cholesterol, but it was significantly greater in males than in females.224 In other studies, the enhanced lipid-altering effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs. those of simvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia were consistent within genders.225 A post hoc analysis of two multi-centre, 6-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trials assessed gender effects on atorvastatin plus ezetimibe vs. up-titration of atorvastatin in hypercholesterolaemic patients. Although some variability existed, gender subgroups did not substantially differ from the entire patient population about lipid-altering findings.226 In a 16-week, single-centre, prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial involving 323 patients hospitalized for ACS, the response to atorvastatin and EZE combination was similar for both men and women.227 In four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced parallel-group trials comparing the efficacy and safety of statin monotherapy vs. ezetimibe 10 mg plus statin, the beneficial effects of ezetimibe were comparable in women and men.228 Among 18 144 patients in the IMPROVE-IT trial, at 12 months, the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline compared with simvastatin monotherapy in men and women equally (absolute reduction, 16.7 mg/dL in men and 16.4 mg/dL in women).221 However, in a meta-analysis of 27 double-blind, active or placebo-controlled studies that randomized adult hypercholesterolaemic patients to statin or statin + ezetimibe, men treated with ezetimibe + statin experienced significantly greater changes in LDL-C (P = 0.0066), non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, apolipoprotein A-I (all P < 0.0001), and apolipoprotein B (P = 0.0055) compared with women.\n\nTreatment with statins/ezetimibe and outcomes\n\nAnother question is whether statin/ezetimibe treatment has the same impact on outcomes in both sexes. The small representation of women in clinical trials and the fewer rates of events due to the lower female baseline cardiovascular risk may have conditioned contradictory findings. Most studies evaluating the efficacy of statins have not been powered to compare efficacy between sexes specifically. Aside from a different pharmacological action, statins are not proven to be less effective or less safe in one gender compared to the other. Specifically, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of statin therapy in women with a high risk, while their role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Among female patients with PAD or ICVD, statin adherence was associated with lower odds of MI (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59–0.98), while use of any statin (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56–0.91) was associated with lower odds of death at 12 months.219 In a prospective study conducted at a tertiary medical centre on older adults aged ≥80 years, the all-cause 3-year mortality rates were significantly lower only in women who had used statins compared with women who had not used statins (24.2% vs. 57.1%; RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.1–0.5; P < 0.0001). The 3-year cumulative survival rates were significantly higher in women who had used statins as part of primary as well as secondary cardiovascular prevention (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.014, respectively). A Cox regression analysis showed that statin therapy was independently associated with low 3-year cumulative mortality rates in women (HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1–0.6; P = 0.001).229 In 2088, consecutive patients discharged from 5 local community hospitals with a definite diagnosis of HF, statin prescription, and adequacy of dosing were associated with 35 and 44% decreases in the risk of 1-year mortality, respectively, irrespective of gender. A nested case/control analysis confirmed that adequate statin dose was associated with 48% lower 1-year mortality, again without interaction with gender.210 Finally, a recent large meta-analysis of both primary and secondary prevention with sex-specific outcomes on data from 22 trials of statin therapy vs. control (n = 134 537) and five trials of more intensive vs. less intensive statin therapy (n = 39 612) showed that the proportional reductions per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C in major vascular events were similar in women (RR 0.84; 99% CI 0.78–0.91) and men (RR 0.78; 99% CI 0.75–0.81), both overall and among those at <10% predicted 5-year risk. Likewise, the proportional reductions in major coronary events, coronary revascularization and stroke did not differ by gender. Since there were similar proportional reductions in vascular mortality in women (RR 0.92; 99% CI 0.82–1.03) and men (RR 0.87; 99% CI 0.82–0.92) but no apparent effect on non-vascular deaths in either sex, all-cause mortality was reduced in both women (RR 0.91; 99% CI 0.84–0.99) and men (RR 0.90; 99% CI 0.86–0.95).223\n\nIn the IMPROVE-IT trial, women receiving ezetimibe/simvastatin had a 12% risk reduction over those receiving placebo/simvastatin for the primary composite end point (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79–0.99) compared with a 5% reduction for men (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90–1.01; P = 0.26 for interaction). When the total number of primary events was considered, women had an 18% reduction with the addition of ezetimibe (RR 95% CI 0.81; 0.71–0.94), and men had a 6% reduction (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.87–1.02; P = 0.08 for interaction).221\n\nIn hypercholesterolaemic patients with co-existing polycystic ovary syndrome, simvastatin decreased serum levels of total testosterone (23%, P < 0.001), free testosterone (32%, P < 0.001), androstendione (20%, P < 0.01), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (17%, P < 0.05), as well as tended to reduce the luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio (23%, P = 0.095), whereas ezetimibe only insignificantly reduced serum levels of free testosterone (14%, P = 0.098).220\n\nProprotein convertase subtilisin kexin Type 9\n\nProprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of cholesterol metabolism and increases plasma LDL-C levels by triggering the degradation of LDL receptors. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin Type 9 also has direct atherosclerotic effects on the vascular wall and is associated with coronary plaque inflammation. Thus, high PCSK9 concentrations are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, emerging data show that women have higher circulating PCSK9 concentrations than men, suggesting that the potential roles of PCSK9 may have different impacts according to sex.230 In a large European cohort of individuals (n = 3673, aged 54–79 years) free of cardiovascular diseases enrolled in seven centres of five European countries: Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, PCSK9 plasma level was higher in women than in men.231 Another study among Thai subjects confirmed that PCSK9 concentrations were significantly higher in women than in men (P = 0.002).232\n\nPCSK9 concentrations were also significantly higher in post-menopausal women than in pre-menopausal women (P < 0.001), and in post-menopausal women with metabolic syndrome than in pre-menopausal women without (P < 0.001).232\n\nCirculating PCSK9 represents a valid pharmacological target for preventing cardiovascular events. New medications such as PCSK9 inhibitors have shown significant results in treating hyperlipidemia. Alirocumab and evolocumab were approved for lowering LDL levels in patients with familial hyperlipidemia and those with high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. These life-altering drugs are, however, still limited in use because of their difficulty in accessing, as public and private insurers have set up administrative obstacles (formulary exclusions and prior authorizations) to offset the high costs. By 2017, only two in five eligible patients were approved for PCSK9 inhibitors.233 Thus, it is likely that women might be discriminated in PCSK9 inhibitors prescription. According to data from 374 786 adults ≥ 66 years of age with US Medicare fee-for-service coverage who had a MI between 2015 and 2018, were not taking ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor, and had217 very high cardiovascular risk, overall, only 1433 (0.4%) beneficiaries initiated a PCSK9 inhibitor. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for PCSK9 inhibitor initiation comparing women to men were 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06–1.17) and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01–1.25), respectively. This seems to indicate the lack of significant difference between genders for PCSK9 initiation. However, a systematic review including 20 articles demonstrated that women were less likely to receive the correct, clinically indicated therapy for hyperlipidemia.234\n\nMultiple studies were performed on these drugs to illustrate their effectiveness in both genders. Available evidence indicates that women derive a similar benefit as men from secondary prevention pharmacological therapies with PCSK9 inhibitors.235 In the FOURIER trial, the LDL-C reduction with evolocumab at four weeks was nominally greater in men than women, but the relative risk reductions in the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint were similar in women [0.81 (0.69–0.95) and 0.74 (0.61–0.90), respectively] compared with men [0.86 (0.80–0.94) and 0.81 (0.73–0.90), respectively].236 Consistently, the preliminary results of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial comparing alirocumab with control (placebo/ezetimibe) showed that the relative risk reductions for the primary composite endpoint were broadly similar in women and men (9 and 17%, respectively).237 Besides, from data pooled from 10 phase 3 ODYSSEY randomized trials (n = 4983), overall, 36.5 and 58.7% of women and men, respectively, achieved on-treatment LDL-C < 50 mg/dL. Each 39 mg/dL lower LDL-C was associated with a 33 and 22% lower risk of MACE in women (P = 0.0209) and men (P = 0.0307), respectively, with no significant between-sex difference.238 In the real world, however, a multi-centre and retrospective study of 652 patients initiating treatment with any PCSK9 inhibitor in 18 different hospitals showed that on-treatment LDL-C was higher in women, and the mean LDL-C reduction was lower in women (47.4% vs. 56.9%; P = 0.0002) receiving evolocumab or alirocumab. The percentage of patients who achieved ≥50% LDL-C reduction was higher in men (71.36% vs. 57.62%; P = 0.002, OR: 0.31).239\n\nAs regards safety issues, in the FOURIER trial adverse events were more common in women but, with the exception of injection site reactions, there were no important significant differences reported by those assigned evolocumab vs. placebo.236 In ODISSEY trials, alirocumab was generally well tolerated in both sexes.238\n\nInclisiran\n\nInclisiran is a first-in-class small interfering RNA targeting the mRNA of PCSK9 specifically in the liver, owing to the conjugation with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine.240 The main advantage over conventional pharmacotherapy and anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies is its favourable administration regimen, with a subcutaneous dosing schedule of once every six months after the initial and 3-month doses (0–90–180 days), which should lead to much better compliance.241,242\n\nClinical trials conducted so far have confirmed the tolerability and efficacy of inclisiran in long-term robust and durable reductions of PCSK9 and LDL-C level. Inclisaran has been studied in the ORION clinical development programme, consisting of some Phases 2 and 3 RCTs, some of which have been completed.241\n\nORION-1 was a Phase 2 trial assessing 6 different inclisiran dosing regimens vs. placebo, evaluating 501 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD risk and elevated LDL-C despite receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy received a single-dose (200, 300, or 500 mg) or 2-dose starting regimen (100, 200, or 300 mg on Days 1 and 90) of inclisiran or placebo.243–245 Inclisiran was associated with marked declines in LDL-C.243–245 This trial allowed us to establish that 300 mg on Day 1 and Day 90 and then every 180 days was the best dose regimen to be adopted. Inclisiran, besides had an adverse profile like that of placebo. Among ORION-1 participants, 35% were females.246\n\nParticipants with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (482 patients) [ORION-9 (Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Inclisiran Treatment on LDL-C in Subjects With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolaemia)], ASCVD (n = 1561) [ORION-10 (Inclisiran for Participants With ASCVD and Elevated LDL-C)], or ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents (n = 1671) [ORION-11 (Inclisiran for Subjects With ASCVD or ASCVD-Risk Equivalents and Elevated LDL-C)] taking maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without other LDL-C–lowering agents, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inclisiran or placebo.247 A pooled analysis, involving ORION-9, -10 and -11 trials, showed the superiority of inclisiran vs. placebo, i.e. LDL-C was lowered at Day 510 by 50.7% (95% CI: 52.9–48.4%; P < 0.0001).247 See shows the prevalence of women in these trials.\n\nThe results of the ORION-4 trial will provide definite evidence of the effects of Inclisiran on the reduction of major cardiovascular events (MACE). Awaiting these results, in a pre-specified exploratory endpoint of MACE including non-adjudicated CV death, cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, and fatal and non-fatal stroke, among 3655 patients of ORION-9, -10 and -11 trials, over 18 months, 303 (8.3%) experienced MACE, including 74 (2.0%) fatal and non-fatal MIs, and 28 (0.8%) fatal and non-fatal strokes. Inclisiran significantly reduced composite MACE [OR (95% CI): 0.74 (0.58–0.94)], but not fatal and non-fatal MIs [OR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.50–1.27)] or fatal and non-fatal stroke [OR (95% CI): 0.86 (0.41–1.81)].244\n\nThese effects are consistent in different categories of patients, although published data focused specifically on women are lacking.242 This drug should not be used in pregnancy and may not be safe in breastfeeding.\n\nBempedoic acid\n\nBempedoic acid (BA) is a first-in-class, small oral molecule, which reduces plasma LDL-cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL).248 Adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase is involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway by acting upstream of the hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. BA is administered orally once daily as a single dose of 180 mg. Bempedoic acid is a prodrug and must be converted to the active bempedoyl-CoA by the enzyme very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 (ACSVL1). ACSVL1 is expressed only in the hepatocytes; the activity of BA, therefore, is limited to the liver and, unlike statins, should not cause muscle-related adverse events.249 Bempedoic acid is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and has a half-life of 15–24 h. Food does not affect its oral bioavailability nor its pharmacokinetic properties by age, sex, race, or weight.\n\nThe efficacy of BA has been tested in the wide clinical CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) programme, which enrolled 3621 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in 4 Phase III RCTs (CLEAR Harmony, CLEAR Wisdom, CLEAR Serenity and CLEAR Tranquility). Overall, the LDL-C was reduced from baseline to week 12 by 17.8% (placebo corrected, 95% CI, −19.5% to −16.0%; P < 0.001) among individuals receiving a maximally tolerated statin and by 24.5% (placebo corrected, 95% CI, −27.8% to −21.1%; P < 0.001) among those with statin intolerance. The reduction in LDL-C levels with BA was sustained during long-term follow-up in both groups of patients. On the other hand, BA is very well tolerated with very few adverse events that did not differ when compared to placebo, except for a slight increase in serum uric acid levels (2.1% and 0.5% and P = 0.001), a greater incidence of gout (1.4% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.008)250 and a higher risk of tendon rupture (0.5% vs. 0%). According to Mendelian randomization studies251 and based on its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, BA is an excellent add-on therapy to all the current lipid-lowering treatments. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C by 38% (placebo corrected) when combined with ezetimibe252 and by 60% (placebo corrected) together with ezetimibe and atorvastatin 20 mg.252 Furthermore, BA lowered LDL-C by an additional 30.3% when added to a background PCSK9i therapy.253 Finally, it is noteworthy that, according to the preliminary announcement, BA reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with statin intolerance during an expected median duration of 3.5 years in the Phase III CLEAR Outcomes trial.\n\nSo far, gender-related differences in BA efficacy/safety are scant. To identify potential clinical factors associated with enhanced LDL-C lowering with BA, a post hoc analysis from pooled data of the CLEAR Harmony, the CLEAR Wisdom, the CLEAR Serenity and the CLEAR Tranquility studies has been performed.254 Patients randomized 2:1 to once daily BA 180 mg (n = 2321) or placebo (n = 1167) for 12–52 weeks were grouped based on percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 12. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified several factors associated with increased rates of achieving ≥30% LDL-C reduction with BA. Among these, younger age, baseline LDL-C, non-statin use, history of diabetes, ezetimibe use, baseline body mass index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level and female sex. In particular, being female was associated with the probability of achieving at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C of >60% compared to males (OR 1.643, 95% CI 1.365–1.978; P < 0.0001). After adjusting for covariates, female sex remained statistically associated (P = 0.0096) with an enhanced LDL-C lowering with BA compared to males. This result could be the consequence of the higher total atherogenic lipoprotein burden in middle-aged women compared to men, to the higher experiencing of statin intolerance or to the fact that women are less likely to be treated with any statin or guideline-recommended statin intensity than men. In other words, the particular benefit of BA in women was not related to the female sex per se, but because women are often under-treated or unable to tolerate statins and at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nA deeper evaluation of the efficacy and safety of BA in women vs. men, using the same pooled data from the CLEAR programme, can be obtained from a previous communication at the 2020 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions.254 According to the data presented, among the 3621 (2424 in the BA group and 1197 in the placebo) patients included in the analyses (separated by background statin and study length) 34.3% were women (n = 1242) with a higher proportion of women in the statin-intolerant pool (58.4%) compared with the ASCVD and HeFH on statins pool (29.4%). Baseline demographics were generally comparable between the sexes, while baseline lipid levels and hsCRP concentrations were slightly higher in women compared with men ( ). After 12 weeks of treatment, BA significantly lowered LDL-C in both sexes: the placebo-corrected difference was −21.2% (95% CI, −24.8 to −17.5; P < 0.001) and −17.4% (95% CI, −19.2 to −15.5; P < 0.001) in on-statin pool and −27.7% (95% CI, −32.1 to −23.2; P < 0.001) and −22.1% (95% CI, −26.9 to −17.2; P > 0.001) in statin-intolerant group, for women and men, respectively. The P per interaction values for treatment by sex subgroup resulted in significant (P = 0.044) for the on-statin pool or borderline significant (P = 0.079) in the statin-intolerant group, suggesting an enhanced response in females compared to males. As far as safety is concerned, common treatment-related adverse events occurred at similar rates in both sexes. There was a higher incidence of urinary tract infection (8.0% vs. 2.7% in BA group; 10.3% vs. 3.0% in placebo group), headache (4.1% vs. 2.1% in BA group; 4.8% vs. 2.2% in placebo group) and pain in extremity (4.2% vs. 2.6% in BA group; 2.9% vs. 1.6% in placebo group) in women compared to men both in BA and placebo groups, but rates of special adverse events, such as new onset diabetes/hyperglycemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, muscular disorders, CPK elevation neurocognitive disorders, renal disorders, uric acid elevations/gout, anaemia, were generally similar between the sexes, in both treatment arms and both in on-statin and in-statin intolerance pools. Women were slightly more likely to discontinue the study drug treatment compared to men, but the difference could not be attributed to any specific adverse events.\n\nIn conclusion, BA seems well tolerated in both sexes and marginally more effective in women compared to men. However, the reason remains unclear and will require further investigation in the real-world setting.\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSeveral studies have been published on gender differences in the pathology and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.255–257 However, there are only a few specific studies aimed at investigating gender differences and anti-arrhythmic drugs. A few studies, both in Western and Asian patients, showed that female AF patients are usually older than male ones, and they often present more severe AF-related symptoms.258 Nevertheless, they usually received more conservative treatments (e.g. female patients received less anti-arrhythmics, less cardioversion, and less radiofrequency catheter ablation).\n\nAnti-arrhythmic medications remain a keystone treatment for cardiac arrhythmias. While the efficacy of Class I and Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs appear to be similar, the risk of adverse effects, most notably drug-induced pro-arrhythmic, is much higher for the latter.\n\nA well-known meta-analysis of 93 articles259 showed that women are more likely to develop torsade's de pointes (TDP) during the administration of anti-arrhythmic drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization (including drugs: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol, bepridil, and prenylamine). An important sub-analysis of the Rate Control vs. Electrical Cardioversion (RACE) study,260 including 192 females out of 522 patients, showed that severe adverse effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs occur more frequently in women than men; however, as the numbers were small, this should be confirmed through larger trials. In this respect, it should be noted that a gender difference was not observed in the AFFIRM study,261 nor in the 1330 patients enrolled in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study.262,2"
