Gemma Hayes "Shock to my System" Let it Break (2011) [Intro] Eb Cm Bb [Verse]

It’s like getting cEblose to the sun I wCmanna tell you things I juBbst can’t get AbAir in my lungs long enougGmh to explaBbin See I wEbas born awake CmLittle by little I siBbmplyAb fell asleep Then you cGmame and it all cBbhanged

[Chorus]

You were rEbight, I was haCmlf alive You were a sBbhock to my sAbystem Tearing Gmup my quiBbet life

Eb Cm [Verse]

Now it’s Ebhard to watch your back Move awCmay from me just like that Bb In an iAbnstant All is gGmone, all is wBbrong

I’m caEbught in the red but I’m fading to grey A coCmnstant reminder that nothing stayBbs the samAbe But nothing ever reGmally changes Bb

[Chorus]

You were rEbight, I was haCmlf alive You were a sBbhock to my sAbystem Tearing Gmup my quiBbet life Eb I felt safe walkiCmng straight lines You were a sBbhock to my sAbystem Lighting uGmp a fireBb so bright Ab Now there’s noBb turning back for me

[Change] Eb Eb-5 Cm Ooh.... Ooh....

I met you in the cAborner of the day You said I wasF beautiful But oAbnly when I’m lost

[Chorus]
