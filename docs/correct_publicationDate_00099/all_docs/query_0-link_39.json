An excellent collaborative effort made by Stephen 'Xeelee' Baxter and Arthur 'Ole Arfer' C. Clarke. Stephen Baxter is, unquestionably, the best science fiction writer Britain has produced in the past 20 or 30 years. Read his \"Xeelee\" stories, his novel \"The Ring\" or his collection, \"Vacuum Flowers\" and you'll know whereof I speak. His non-Xeelee material is just as good, with the colossal novel, \"Time\", for example, capable of blowing anybody's mind, especially with joss sticks, herbal tea and a sunny dsposition on standby. This is a very fine, unread proof in clean flawless cream wrappers, a spine so fine that other spines cringe as they gaze in shock and awe at its hubris-fuelled perfection, and pristine pages of Omo-tastic white. AS NEW and SIGNED & DATED BY STEPHEN BAXTER.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Stephen Baxter (born 13 November 1957) is an English hard science fiction author. He has degrees in mathematics and engineering. Baxter's \"Future History\"[1] mode is based on research into hard science. It encompasses the Xeelee Sequence, which of seven novels (including the Destiny's Children trilogy), plus three volumes collecting the 52 short pieces (short stories and novellas) in the series, all of which fit into a single timeline stretching from the Big Bang singularity of the past to his Timelike Infinity singularity of the future.[ These stories begin in the present day and end when the Milky Way galaxy collides with Andromeda five billion years in the future. (Wikipedia).Sir Arthur Charles Clarke CBE FRAS (16 December 1917 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host. He co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most influential films of all time. Clarke was a science writer who was an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability. He wrote over a dozen books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961 he received the Kalinga Prize, a UNESCO award for popularising science. Clarke's science and science fiction writings earned him the moniker \"Prophet of the Space Age\". His science fiction earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, which along with a large readership made him one of the towering figures of science fiction. For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov were known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction. (Wikipedia). .
