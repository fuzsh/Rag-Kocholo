        "text": "The Color Purple, novel by Alice Walker, published in 1982. It won a Pulitzer Prize in 1983, making Walker the first African American woman to win a Pulitzer for fiction. A feminist work about an abused and uneducated African American woman’s struggle for empowerment, The Color Purple was praised for the depth of its female characters and for its eloquent use of Black English Vernacular.\n\nAn epistolary novel composed of letters written by two sisters, The Color Purple took form as Walker was living in a small town in northern California, trying to find the right voice for the novel’s story. In 1983 she told The New York Times that the letter form worked best because “It was…a way of solving a technical problem of having characters in Georgia and Africa. They never actually get the letters, but that’s beside the point. By writing, they drew closer.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nIn writing the book, Walker was inspired by the experience of her grandparents, with whom she had lived for a year in rural Georgia when she was a child. In a 2015 TimesTalk interview, she said of her grandparents, “They were so kind, so giving. In the early days, they were terrible, terrible people. So I began to wonder, how could people who were so wonderful, when I knew them, be terrible when I didn’t know them? That made me realize there was some reclamation to be done.”\n\nPlot summary and characters\n\nSpanning from 1909 to 1947, The Color Purple documents the traumas and gradual triumph of Celie, introduced at the novel’s start as an African American teenager raised in rural isolation in Georgia, as she comes to resist the paralyzing self-concept forced on her by others. Celie narrates her life through painfully honest letters to God. These are prompted when her abusive father, Alphonso, warns her, “You better not never tell nobody but God” after he rapes her and she becomes pregnant for a second time at the age of 14. After she gives birth, Alphonso takes the child away, as he had done with her first baby, which Celie believes he killed in the woods while Celie was sleeping. Then Celie’s mother dies. In her letter to God after her second baby’s birth, Celie writes of the worsening situation this creates for her and her younger sister, Nettie: “He took my other little baby, a boy this time. But I don’t think he kilt it. I think he sold it to a man an his wife over Monticello.…I keep hoping he fine somebody to marry. I see him looking at my little sister. She scared. But I say I’ll take care of you.”\n\nWhen the widowed Mr.__ (also called Albert) proposes marriage to Nettie, Alphonso pushes him to take Celie instead, forcing her into an abusive marriage. Soon thereafter, Nettie flees Alphonso—who has married a girl Celie’s age—and briefly lives with Celie. However, Albert’s continued interest in Nettie results in her leaving.\n\nCelie subsequently begins to build relationships with other Black women, especially those engaging forcefully with oppression. Of note is the defiant Sofia, who marries Albert’s son Harpo after becoming pregnant. Unable to control her, Harpo seeks advice, and Celie suggests that he beat Sofia. However, when Harpo strikes her, Sofia fights back. Upon learning that Celie encouraged Harpo’s abuse, she confronts a guilty Celie, who admits to being jealous of Sofia’s refusal to back down, and the two women become friends.More significant, however, is Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery, a glamorous and independent singer who is also Albert’s sometime mistress. When Celie sees a picture of Shug for the first time, she is struck by Shug’s captivating style and beauty. Celie writes in a letter: “I see her there in furs. Her face rouge. Her hair like somethin tail. She grinning with her foot up on somebody motocar. Her eyes serious tho. Sad some.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Celie begins reading them and learns that Nettie has befriended a minister, Samuel, and his wife, Corrine, and that the couple’s adopted children, Adam and Olivia, are actually Celie’s. Nettie joins the family on a mission in Liberia, where Corrine later dies. The letters also reveal that Alphonso is actually Celie’s stepfather and that her biological father was lynched. Questioning her faith, Celie begins addressing her letters to Nettie. In her first letter to her sister, Celie recounts a conversation she had with Shug, who encourages Celie to change her beliefs about God: “Here’s the thing, say Shug. The thing I believe. God is inside you and inside everybody else. You come into the world with God. But only them that search for it inside find it. And sometimes it just manifest itself even if you not looking, or don’t know what you looking for.”\n\nAn emboldened Celie then decides to leave Albert and go to Memphis with Shug. Once there, Celie comes into her own and creates a successful business selling tailored pants. Her happiness, however, is tempered by Shug’s affairs, though Celie continues to love her. Following Alphonso’s death, Celie inherits his house, where she eventually settles. During this time she develops a friendship with Albert, who is apologetic about his earlier treatment of her. After some 30 years apart, Celie is then reunited with Nettie, who has married Samuel. In the novel’s powerful ending Celie also meets her long-lost children."
