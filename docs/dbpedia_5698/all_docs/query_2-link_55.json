        "text": "Bill was born and raised in the Cariboo region of British Columbia, near Williams Lake. Following high school, he moved to Kamloops to attend Cariboo College.\n\nUpon graduating with his Communications Media diploma in 1976, he headed north to cut his broadcasting teeth in Dawson Creek with CJDC. He made stops in Williams Lake and Penticton before returning to Kamloops in 1979 to work in the CFJC sports department under his soon-to-be good friend Earl Seitz.\n\nIn 1986, Bill’s career took him to CTV Regina. He worked for 13 years in the sports department and a couple of years anchoring the news. But Bill’s calling seemed to be in Kamloops, and he returned to his adopted home in August 2001. Since then, he has been a constant as the anchor of the CFJC Evening News.\n\nBill’s vast experience has helped to develop countless young journalists who spent time in the CFJC newsroom. His desire for accuracy and fairness has made CFJC News a model for journalistic integrity. And his constant drive has pushed everyone to reach for the high standards he has espoused.\n\nOver two decades, Bill’s impact on the community has been profound. His volunteer work includes acting as the P.A. voice of the Kamloops Blazers and his support of School District programs promoting literacy.\n\nHis achievements in the newsroom and his support of many community events have certainly made Bill a worthy recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award."
