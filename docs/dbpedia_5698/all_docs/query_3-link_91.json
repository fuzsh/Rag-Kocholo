        "text": "On December 3, 1944 he was on the crew of the B-29 Superfortress #42-24181 when they departed in a group of over two dozen heavy bombers from their base at Isley Field on Saipan. Their primary mission was to bomb and strafe the Nakajima aircraft factory in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nAfter a successful mission they were returning to base when they radioed about mechanical trouble. One engine was out and another was feathered. It was reported that they ditched in the sea. There were no survivors. All men onboard were officially declared dead on December 4, 1945. Some records indicate they were shot down.\n\nWe identified 11 casualties in our archive related to the #42-24181 incident on December 3, 1944.\n\n◼Donald De Shazo :: Gunner\n\n◼Anthony T Fraune :: Pilot\n\n◼Harry Goin Jr :: Gunner\n\n◼Elbert W Hyde :: Pilot\n\n◼Joe B Kendall :: Co-Pilot\n\n◼John J O'Donovan :: Navigator\n\n◼Frank E Pfeiffer :: Radar Operator\n\n◼Joseph J Richter :: Gunner\n\n◼Stanley N Samuelson :: Gunner\n\n◼William E Swink Jr :: Radio Operator\n\n◼Irving J Twedt :: Bombardier"
