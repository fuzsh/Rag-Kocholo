        "text": "<strong>DOVER</strong> Lost Men Dover <strong>Kent</strong> Armed Service Personnel and Civilians who are missing from the Borough’s Civic War Memorial It should be noted that some of the civic war memorial non-commemorations as set out below, are fortunately commemorated on other secular or places of worship forms of rememberance, within the Borough of Dover, <strong>Kent</strong>. Although this addition list of commemorations has been added to aid ‘Dover’ researchers, it should be pointed out that whilst most of the following casualties were known to be actual Dover, <strong>Kent</strong> town residents and/or natives, some are probably the war dead of surrounding villages within the Dover, <strong>Kent</strong> area. Most of the following British Great War army deaths have been accessed via the excellent O/SDGW books and/or C.D. which records the majority of the casualties by their location to their nearest town, it normally being part of the then postal address, and obviously the same criteria would also apply below. Royal Navy ratings details as accessed via the National Archives also in some instances show place of birth as being the nearest town, in much the same way as O/SDGW. In view of same Dover, <strong>Kent</strong> Royal Navy ratings deaths might relate to a sailor who was actually born in a nearby rural location, as costs prevents purchase of all birth certificates, and/or other supporting documentary ‘evidence.’ Although clearly this roll of non-commemorations, as with commemorated rolls of honour is an ongoing project which doubtless will be added to as more casualties are revealed, post winter 2004, as unfortunately there are doubtless several more non-commemorations which have not been accessed, during the researches for formulation of the following remembrances. The Great War 1914-1919"
