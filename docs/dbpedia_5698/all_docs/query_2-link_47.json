        "text": "About the year 1836, a young man named John O’Donovan was despatched by the office of the Ordnance Survey to visit in succession every county in Ireland with the object of noting and recording all existing remains of antiquity:\n\nBy the direction of the Ordnance, O’Donovan visited, we may say, every townland in Ireland, thus acquiring an amount of knowledge of Irish topography and an acquaintance with local traditions and dialects, never previously nor since attainable by any individual. In these journeys, and in settling the orthography of the names in the Ordnance maps, he was mainly occupied till the sudden and unexpected dissolution of the topographical section of the Survey in 1842.\n\nIt was a unique job. Sir Thomas Aiskew Larcom, Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey, had ‘conceived the grand idea’ of making the work of the Ordnance Survey ‘embrace every species of local information relating to the country,’ and to Larcom – in the form of letters – O’Donovan reported.[1]\n\nIn September 1841, O’Donovan was in Castleisland with his colleague, Thomas O’Conor.[2]\n\nOn September 10th, the two men, who evidently divided the parishes in the barony of Trughanacmy between them, worked almost side by side. O’Donovan concentrated on Castleisland and O’Conor focussed on Ballincuslane.[3]\n\nIt is easy to imagine the two men taking refreshments in one of the inns in Castleisland town, deep in conversation about the antiquities they had that day measured and documented.[4] O’Donovan, however, certainly played down the task in a letter to Captain Larcom on the 22nd of the same month:\n\nWe have identified some very curious localities in Kerry but the reading of the letters will be very tiresome as they consist principally of measurements of old churches, castles, stone cells, &c &c.\n\nThe following year, the plug was pulled on the project.\n\nThe Letters\n\nSeventy years later, a writer asked about ‘the desirability of publishing the Ordnance Survey Letters of Ireland’ as they constituted such ‘a valuable asset in the historical, topographical, and antiquarian records of the country.’[5]\n\nThe writer gave a brief outline of the progress of the letters since the project came to its sudden halt in 1842. The Royal Irish Academy had stepped in to help, and a Commission appointed in 1843. The Commission recommended the recommencement of the work, but it came to nothing. The Great Famine intervened, and the papers were deposited in Mountjoy barracks.[6]\n\nIn 1860, the Royal Irish Academy applied to the Government for custody of the documents, and in November of that year more than 100 volumes of manuscripts with eleven volumes of antiquarian drawings, fully indexed and bound, were presented to the Academy:\n\nAfter a vote of thanks to Colonel James and Lieutenant-Colonel Leach, by whose hands they were deposited, the Academy testified to the importance of the services rendered to the history and antiquities of Ireland by Sir Thomas Larcom, and thus ended the story of Ordnance Memoirs of Ireland.[7]\n\nThe documents remain in the custodianship of the Royal Irish Academy.[8] Its website reveals that printed editions of the letters for selected counties have been published, almost all of them prepared by the late Michael Herity of Ballintra, Co Donegal, Professor Emeritus of Archaeology at University College, Dublin.[9]\n\nThanks to modern day technology, the work undertaken by O’Donovan and O’Conor covering the entire county of Kerry is now accessible online, a standard source of reference for researchers, particularly useful in comparing the condition of buildings in pre-Famine Ireland to today. Some buildings in Kerry, like Ballymacadam Castle, have since disappeared.\n\nJohn O’Donovan, Antiquarian\n\nThe death of the translator of the Annals of the Four Masters cannot be considered otherwise than as a national calamity – Irish Examiner, 11 December 1861\n\nJohn O’Donovan was born ‘of very humble parentage although descended from as distinguished ancestry as any in Ireland.’[10] His father, Edmond O’Donovan, was born at Kilcolumb in 1760. Edmond was a farmer, described as a large, strong and very courageous man. In 1763, Edmond moved to Atateemore, Slieverue, in the parish of Kilcolumb, and in 1789, married Eleanor Hoberlin of Rochestown, Kilkenny. John, his fourth son, was born on 26 July 1809.[11]\n\nEdmond O’Donovan moved to a farm at Redgap, Kilcolumb in 1816 and died the following year, on 19 July 1817, leaving his young family in poor circumstances.[12]\n\nJohn, a boy in his eighth year, derived an education from a number of sources, including his uncle Patrick O’Donovan, and some knowledge of Latin and Greek from a relative (a priest) supplemented by an education in an Irish hedge-school.\n\nHe later found work as a clerk and steward ‘to a gentleman residing in the Queen’s County’ and there the directors of the Ordnance Survey chanced to find him:\n\nThey were astonished at the amount of topographical and historical information which he was enabled to afford them. He was taken into the service of the Ordnance Commission and henceforth became recognised as a remarkable man.[13]\n\nO’Donovan thereafter remained in Dublin. His considerable output included a translation of the Annals of Ireland, ‘the grandest and most learned historical publication ever edited in these countries by an individual scholar,’ and The Book of Rights.[14]\n\nO’Donovan’s labours were duly recognised and honours conferred on him including Doctor of Laws by TCD. However, the accolades and adulation did not reflect in his financial standing:\n\nO’Donovan received no sterling support or recognition from the high and opulent in his own country and while large sums were weekly lavished in Dublin on trifles of the hour, the great scholar, whose profound works had in every part of the world obtained a respectful recognition for Irish learning, was permitted to remain at home obscure and unnoticed except by the few who knew how to value his labours and to appreciate his character.[15]\n\nO’Donovan considered emigrating to obtain better prospects for his large growing family but ‘fortunately for learning and for Ireland’ he remained in the country. He obtained an appointment with Eugene O’Curry, transcribing and translating the Brehon Laws to which he applied himself ‘with his characteristic assiduity and self-denial, never sparing an hour for relaxation.’[16]\n\n‘P.23 Ends.’[17] – The last words written by Dr O’Donovan\n\nThe straightforward simplicity of his character made for him a friend of every one with whom he had even casual acquaintance – Obituary, Duffy’s Hibernian Magazine\n\nJohn O’Donovan could be seen taking his daily exercise in Dublin in all weathers, ‘often struggling against storm and hail, yet intently pursuing his course’:\n\nHe never could be induced to avail himself of a vehicle, erroneously imagining that walking exercise, even in the most tempestuous weather, was necessary as a counterpoise to the sedentary pursuits which consumed so large a portion of his time. In unwisely indulging in one of these excursions, he caught his mortal illness.[18]\n\nO’Donovan suffered an attack of rheumatic fever and died at about twenty past midnight on the night of Monday 9 December 1861 from ‘inflammation of the bronchial tubes.’[19]\n\nOn Thursday 12 December 1861, Dr John O’Donovan was laid to rest in Glasnevin in a plot assigned by the Cemetery Committee alongside the sculptor, John Hogan.[20] A few days later, a special meeting was held by the Council of the Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society to open a public fund for O’Donovan’s widow and six sons.[21]\n\nWith the death of Dr John O’Donovan, certain branches of Irish learning were said to have perished. Many tributes followed. One described how his ‘career of usefulness’ began on the Irish Ordnance Survey ‘when a mere boy.’ When Eugene O’Curry later joined that service, it ‘laid the foundation for the productions of both gentlemen that have arrested the attention of the learned of all nations for the last quarter of a century or more.’\n\nThey have laboured together as on the Survey, the Brehon Laws, and for the Archaeological Society; and separately, as on the Annals of the Four Masters, and the MS Materials of Irish History.[22]\n\nAnother gave a measure of O’Donovan’s ability:\n\nHe had to contend with the obscure and obsolete idioms of a peculiar language and to seek his authorities and illustrations among our unclassified and un-indexed Celtic monuments – half-effaced by the accidents of time, and which would still remain unintelligible and inaccessible to the literary investigator but for the labours of himself and his erudite associate, Eugene Curry.[23]\n\nOf O’Donovan’s translation of the Annals of Ireland, the writer added:\n\nIt must be admitted that these Annals, as edited by Dr John O’Donovan, form one of the most remarkable works yet produced in the history of any portion of the British Isles. The mass of information which they embody constitutes a collection of national records, the value of which can never be surpassed.[24]\n\nThe O’Donovan Curse\n\nJohn O’Donovan had the greatest interest in his ancestry. Writing to Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa, Skibbereen, Co Cork, from his home at 36 Upper Buckingham Street, Dublin on 24 December 1854, he described how he feared the Donovans were ‘doomed to extinction – many curses hang over us!’:\n\nThe holy Columb MacKerrigan, bishop of Cork, cursed our progenitor, Donovan, from whom we all descend (and our names, Donovanides), in the year 976, in the most solemn manner that any human being ever was cursed or denounced, and so late as 1652, a good and pious Protestant woman’s family (the children of Dorothy Ford) cursed Daniel O’Donovan of Castle Donovan and caused a Braca Sinshir (Aillse) to trickle from a stone arch in Castle Donovan which will never cease to flow till the last of the race of the said Daniel O’Donovan is extinct. It appears from the depositions in Trinity College Dublin that the said Daniel O’Donovan and Seige A Duna MacCarthy hanged the said Dorothy at Castle Donovan to deprive her and her family of debts lawfully due unto them. You and I escape the last curse but we reel under that pronounced by the holy Columb.[25]\n\nIn another letter to the same correspondent in 1860, O’Donovan remarked again on family history:\n\nOur ancestor, Donabhan, son of Cathal, was certainly a singularly wicked and treacherous man, and it is to be hoped that his characteristics have not been transmitted, and, therefore, that the curse of the good Coarb of St Barry has spent its rage long since. But I believe that the curse still hangs over us.[26]\n\nThe Family of Dr John O’Donovan\n\nO’Donovan’s concerns about the curse were certainly borne out in the lives of his own children. He married, on 18 January 1840, Mary Anne (or Marianna) Broughton, daughter of John Broughton of Killaderry, Broadford, Kilseily, Co Clare. Nine sons were born to them, six survived to adulthood.[27]\n\nThe youngest was only five years old when his father died in 1861. About five years later, Mrs O’Donovan, then in receipt of a government pension, left Dublin with her family and returned to Co Clare. A property, Crean Mount (otherwise ‘Glenview’) was purchased near Broadford and became the family home.[28]\n\nThe deaths of Mrs O’Donovan’s three eldest sons occurred in her lifetime.\n\nJohn O’Donovan (1842-1873) John O’Donovan left Ireland after being imprisoned on charges of Fenianism. He was professor of English literature and natural science in the Christian Brothers’ College, St Louis, Missouri. He drowned on 23 June 1873 while swimming with friends in Creve Coeur Lake and was buried in Calvary Cemetery. In later life, Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa wrote that he feared his own early acquaintanceship with John O’Donovan’s sons ‘had something to do with disturbing the serenity of their lives in after years.’[29] Edmond O’Donovan (1848-1883) ‘O’Donovan of Merv’ ‘Howie Wylie, when at Portpatrick the day after the sinking of the SS Orion, found a small Irish boy on holiday from Dublin sketching the funnel and mast of the sunken steamer protruding out of the water. Mr Wylie begged the sketch from the boy, sent it to London, and it appeared in the Illustrated London News, then a struggling journal, as ‘by our artist on the spot.’ A cheque in payment came by return of post and was handed to the boy’s mother by Mr Wylie. The boy, Edmond O’Donovan, son of Dr John O’Donovan, the well-known Celtic scholar of Dublin, was thus introduced to journalism, becoming the famous war correspondent who was lost in the annihilation of Hicks Pasha’s ill-starred expedition in the Soudan.’[30] Edmond O’Donovan was author of The Merv Oasis Travels and Adventures East of the Caspian during the Years 1879-80-81 (1883, 2 vols) in which he wrote, ‘These pages contain a simple record of my wanderings around and beyond the Caspian including a five months’ residence at Merv during the three years 1879-1881.’ Shortly before he was reported to have perished in the Soudan, Edmond wrote to a friend, ‘To die out here with a lance-head as big as a shovel through me will meet my views better than the gradual slow sinking into the grave which is the lot of many.’[31] It was held by some that O’Donovan was not killed in 1883 as his body was never recovered. Others, including his mother, maintained that he was the White Pasha.[32] An article, ‘Edmond O’Donovan, Fenian and War Correspondent, and his Circle’ by Eva O Cathaoir includes photographs of Edmond O’Donovan.[33] William O’Donovan (1846-1886) On news of the presumed death of his younger brother Edmond in 1883, William O’Donovan addressed the editor of the Boston Republic newspaper correcting a few errors that had appeared in a tribute. Writing from New York on 1 December 1883, he stated, ‘Edmond was not born in Kilrush, county Clare, but in the North-strand, Dublin City, and the date of his birth was September 13th, 1848. He was never Paris correspondent of the Irishman as I occupied that position from the time it was given up by John Augustus O’Shea until the close of the Prussian siege of Paris ... Your contributor confuses him during the Carlist war with a younger brother, Henry, who was in the medical service of Don Carlos, and was imprisoned by the Royalists for an indiscreet profession of Republican principles. There can be no mistake about this as it was I who applied to Cardinal Cullen and the present Bishop of Ardagh, then Rector of the Dublin Catholic University, to intercede on behalf of Henry ... I may add Edmond was never married either to a Khan’s daughter or anyone else.’[34] William O’Donovan joined the Fenian movement while a student of Trinity College Dublin. He was elected by that movement to receive funds brought over by John Mitchel and was dubbed, ‘The Chancellor of the Exchequer.’ William O’Donovan worked as a journalist in Paris and New York, and died from Bright’s disease in New York on 25 April 1886 at the age of 41.\n\nThree sons, Richard, Henry and Daniel, survived their mother.\n\nRichard O’Donovan (1849-1939) Richard O’Donovan of Norfolk Avenue, Prestatyn, Flint, was the only son to marry. In 1875, Richard went to Liverpool en route for the United States where he intended to join the Christian Brothers. However, he was persuaded to remain in the city by William Horan, a member of the Fenian organisation in Liverpool, and secured work as translator in the Royal Insurance Co, Liverpool, where he remained for over 43 years until his retirement.[35] He married, in 1881, Anna Maria Cahill (1854-1930), daughter of William Cahill of Ennis. They had one daughter, Maria (or Mya) in 1882, who married on 28 April 1903 Dr William Pritchard-Airey (1866-1950) of Menai Bridge at St Peter and St Paul’s Church, New Brighton. Richard O’Donovan was then resident at Woodbine Cottage, New Brighton, Wirral. In 1919, Richard settled in Prestatyn to be near his daughter. His wife, Anna Maria O’Donovan, of 7 Norfolk Avenue, Prestatyn, died on 1 January 1930 at 38 Bentley Road, Princes Park, Liverpool and was buried at Wallasey. Richard O’Donovan of Norfolk Avenue, Prestatyn, North Wales died at Painton, Prestatyn, Flintshire on 10 June 1939 in his 91st year. His funeral service was held in SS Peter and Francis’s Church, interment at Coed Bell Cemetery, Prestatyn. His headstone there is inscribed (in Latin): Hic Oucoue Jacet/Ricardus O’Donovan/Filius Joannis O’Donovan LL.D M.R.I.A./Die X Mensis Jun 11 Anno Salutis MCMXXXIX/Annos Natus XCI/RIP/Maria Pritchard Airey Filia Dilectissima Moerens/Patri Suo Hoc Monumentum. Richard O’Donovan left property on trust for his brother, Daniel Cornelius O’Donovan for life. Mrs Pritchard-Airey died in December 1969 in St Asaph, Flintshire, Wales with no surviving issue, and thus the line of Dr John O’Donovan would seem to have come to an end. Henry O’Donovan (1853-1905) Henry O’Donovan endured ‘months under the death sentence in a dungeon at Estella on a trumped-up charge of having plotted the poisoning of Don Carlos.’ This event occurred in 1874: Henry O’Donovan, a philanthropic Irish gentleman, whose exuberant benevolence induced him to go on a Samaritan mission among the Carlists. He has returned to St Jean de Luz after a series of adventures which have made him a wiser man. That he did not die in a Carlist dungeon or meet with the same sad fate as Captain Schmidt is owing to the kind offices of Mr Furley who managed to obtain his liberation and bundle him off to France when no letters from Cardinal Cullen and other influential persons had any effect on the hard hearts of the Santo Officio.[36] Henry described his experiences in a letter to his brother in Spain, written from St Jean de Luz, where he was lying ill. He explained how he had been accused of being an emissary of the Ronda Secreta of Madrid because a preparation of laudanum he carried to help him sleep was observed in his room by a padre cara. Henry was reported and informed that he was, ‘without doubt,’ an assassin of Carlos VII and he was packed off to the Carcel of Estella. Henry’s description of his prison ordeal reveals he was most fortunate to survive.[37] The progress of Henry O’Donovan’s life from this point is open to research. He is stated to have worked in England as assistant physician in the north of the country. Indeed, the UK Census of 1881 records 28-year-old Henry O’Donovan, medical assistant, in Manchester. In this respect, it is worth noting that a writer in 1883 described one of Dr John O’Donovan’s sons as a surgeon in Lancashire who ‘acted as Premier to Oko Jumbo, an African king on the shores of the Bonny River for a short period.’[38] Henry O’Donovan was present at his mother’s death in Co Clare in 1893. After this, he seems to have returned to England where he evidently fell on hard times.[39] He died in North Riding Lunatic Asylum, York on 23 September 1905. He was buried in York Cemetery.’[40] Daniel Cornelius O’Donovan (1856-1932) The life of Daniel (Donal) Cornelius O’Donovan is open to research. The UK Census of 1911 shows that he was living with his niece, Mya Pritchard-Airey and her husband in Wallasey, Merseyside. He was single, aged 54 and his occupation was given as chemist and druggist. He was remembered in the will of his brother, Richard. His date of demise is given as 23 October 1932. He was buried in Coed Bell cemetery, Prestatyn.\n\nMrs O’Donovan died at the family residence, Glenview, ‘to the general regret of the whole countryside amongst whom she was a familiar and kindly and beloved presence’ in June 1893.\n\nWith her passing, ‘the renaissance of native Irish literature’ was recorded:\n\nIf any lady of the Irish land could be Irish of the Irish she was. A Celtic student of no mean attainments herself, she was her husband’s and Eugene O’Curry’s fellow worker in the great movement of the renaissance of native Irish literature and the critical, as well as the popular, study of the Irish language. Her husband was a student who, beyond his connection with the Young Ireland movement, took little interest in politics. He felt his mission to be to aid in convincing the world that his race had a civilised history to boast of. Mrs O’Donovan impressed upon her sons with the enthusiasm and the culture of an educated Irish mother that they were the children of an ancient nation which had a future. Mrs O’Donovan was affectionately attached to her children but never when they were required at any point of danger in their country’s cause did she ask them to remain with her. She was proud of their courage and their achievements.[41]\n\n__________________"
