        "text": "Franklin Macaulay Gillespie 1872 - 1915;\n\nBorn at Colchester, Essex, on the 19th of August 1872.I have not found Franklin in the 1881 census.\n\nEducated at Dover College, Dover, Kent, unknown dates.\n\nEducated at the Royal Military College Sandhurst, Berkshire, unknown date.\n\nLodger at Stone House, Richmond, Surrey, in the 1891 census. Franklin aged 18, is a Gentleman Cadet at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.\n\nCommissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant, South Wales Borderers, on the 25th of July 1891. Published in the London Gazette, Issue 26186, Page 3943.\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant, on the 22nd of February 1893.\n\nPosted to West Africa, unknown date.\n\nPosted on Special Extra Regimental Duty, with the Royal Niger Constabulary, on the 14th of November 1896, until the 5th of April 1897.\n\nIn 1886, when the Royal Niger Company was granted a charter by the British government, it became necessary to extend protection to British trading interests in the north. The Royal Niger Constabulary was thus formed as the second indigenous military force with the assignment of protecting all business interests of the Royal Niger Company in British West Africa.\n\n\"Franklin was sent up the Niger River, to Egbon, Bida and Ilorin, where the growing menace of the great slave trading Fulah Power threatened to drive us into the sea. He was in the fight at the capture of capital of Nupe and the subjugation of the smaller states.\"\n\nAwarded the Royal Niger Company Medal 1886-97 with Clasp, Nigeria 1886-97.\n\nPosted to the 1st Battalion, Northern Nigeria Regiment, West African Frontier Force, and served at Borgu between 1897 and 1898.\n\nPromoted to Captain, on the 6th of March 1898. Published in the London Gazette, on the 1st of April 1898, Issue 26953, Page 2091\n\nAwarded the East and West Africa Medal with Clasps, 1897-98\n\nFranklin remained with the 1st Battalion, Northern Nigeria Regiment, until March 1900.\n\nPosted to South Africa (2nd Boer War 1899-1902), rejoining the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers, March 1900.\n\nPresent at the operation in the Orange Free State, between July 1900 and June 1901.\n\nAppointed Commandant at Roodeval Spruit, unknown date, until the 10th of February 1901.\n\nPresent at the operations in the Transvaal, between June 1901 and May 1902.\n\nAwarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with Clasps, Cape Colony, Orange Free State and Transvaal.\n\nAwarded the King's South Africa Medal with Clasps, South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902.\n\nPosted back to England, unknown date.\n\nAppointed Adjutant of the 5th Volunteer Battalion (later renamed the 7th Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers), at Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales, from the 18th of April 1903, until the 14th of July 1908.\n\nFranklin married Agnes Rose Pryce-Jones, at Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales, on the 27th of July 1905. Agnes residence was given as 'Bromley', Camberley, Surrey.\n\nPosted to the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers, at Aldershot, Hampshire, July 1908.\n\nPromoted to Major, on the 26th of September 1909.\n\nLiving at Military Barracks, South Africa, in the 1911 census. Franklin now aged 38, is a Major, serving with the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers.\n\nPosted to the 1st Battalion, South Wales Borderers, at Chatham, Kent, unknown date.\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, unknown date.\n\nAppointed Commanding Officer of the Regimental Depot, at Brecon, Montgomeryshire, Wales, from February 1914.\n\nWith the outbreak of war in August 1914, Franklin was appointed Commanding Officer of the newly formed 4th (Service) Battalion, South Wales Borderers, at Brecon, Montgomeryshire, Wales.\n\nPosted to Gallipoli, Turkey, embarking the S.S. 'Megantic', at Avonmouth, Gloucestershire, on the 28th of June 1915, and sailing the next day via Malta and Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Battalion, South Wales Borderers landed at 'V' Beach, Gallipoli, on the 15th of July, and were soon posted to the trenches.\n\nThe Battalion War Diary notes that things were generally - save for the occasional bomb throwing and sniper activity - quiet. There were signs of a recent fight, however. The unburied dead of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers still lying think on the ground. Unbearable heat would also be a problem. The men's ration of Bully Beef had actually turned into liquid, which - \"....few dared to tackle, and most people lived on dry biscuits with a little jam when the flies would let them eat it.\"\n\nThe Battalion went to Mudros on the Isle of Lemnos for a short rest and on the 3rd of August, they returned to Gallipoli in preparation for an attack on the strongly held ridge, Damakjelik Bair.\n\nThe 4th Battalion South Wales Borderers were to be the lead column, heading two miles north along the shore, and then head inland.\n\nMoving out at 8.00pm on the 8th of August 1915, and after covering two miles of very broken and difficult ground covered with boulders and prickly scrub, the battalion reached the Achyl Dere, and immediately were under enemy fire.\n\nThe enemy fire came from a trench opposite the Achyl Dere, and 'D' Company in the lead, charged with a cheer and carried the trench with bayonet. The battalion crossed the trench moving to the right and after dealing with several parties of Turks, had captured its objective, Damakjelik Bair, by 1.30am.\n\nKilled In Action on the 9th of August 1915, aged 42.\n\nOn the 9th of August 1915, the 4th Battalion, South Wales Borderers, met and defeated a determined counter-attack on the Damakjelik Bair, but in doing so Lieutenant-Colonel Franklin Macaulay Gillespie, was killed early in the attack, shot through the head by a sniper, whilst directing machine gun fire.\n\nIn this action, the 4th South Wales Borderers and their leader, would win the admiration of Commander-in-Chief, Sir Ian Hamilton. He wrote: \"The rapid success of this movement was largely due to Lieutenant-Colonel Gillespie, a very fine man, who commanded the advance Guard, consisting of his own regiment....a corps worthy of such a leader.\"\n\nDamakjelik Bair, was offically named 'Gillespie Spur', by the Allied Forces.\n\nBy the 22nd of August 1915, the 4th Battalion South Wales Borderers, had lost over 400 men out of the 775 that had landed at Gallipoli on the 15th of July 1915.\n\nMentioned In Despatches, published in the London Gazette, on the 28th of January 1916.\n\nOriginally buried at the 39th Casualty Clearing Station Cemetery.

A large mine was blown (by us) on our Right in the ST ELOI CRATERS and our barrage opened on the enemy front line. The intensity of the barrage was extreme.\n\n3.13 a.m. At zero plus 3 minutes the barrage lifted from the enemy front line & the leading wave entered it with no opposition as it appeared to unoccupied. The advance then continued to the enemy support line where the first halted for the purpose of mopping up. None was required as the trench was completely demolished & they advanced again. At this point the 5th Wave, which was employed as a carrying party, dumped its load & went forward as a fighting wave. The 2nd WAVE followed the barrage & halted at the RED LINE where a few enemy were encountered (About 8)\n\n3.30 a.m. It was between this line and the enemy support that the enemy barrage fell, though it was very ragged. The 3rd, 4th & 6th moved straight on to the BLUE LINE. the 2nd objective (DAMSTRASSE) which they carried with considerable dash although enfiladed by M.G. fire from the direction of WHITE CHATEAU and THE STABLES. About 30 Germans taken prisoner & an equal number killed.\n\n5 a.m. A line was rapidly dug in front of the DAMSTRASSE, protected by Lewis Gun posts pushed forward. This line afforded good cover by 5.a.m. Very little resistance was encountered at all during the attack and the prisoners taken were entirely demoralised. The line must of been lightly held or evacuated since few enemy dead were seen. The 8th LONDON REGT on our left were held up for some time by M.G. fire from WHITE CHATEAU. Whilst digging in afterwards during the day very little hostile shell fire was experienced. It was even possible to bring up pack animals to the DAMSTRASSE while it was still light. Battalion Headquarters were established at O 9 b 88.\n\nDAMSTRASSE\n\n6.50 a.m. At zero plus 3 Hours 50 Minutes the 122nd Inf. Brigade attacked through our line (BLUE LINE) accompanied by Tanks & captured the BLACK LINE (OBLONG RESERVE & OBSCURE TRENCH) This caused no hostile retaliation on our position.\n\n3.10 p.m. At zero plus 12 hours the 24th Division also attack through our lines and captured a line of trenches about 150 yds in front of the BLACK LIne.\n\nGROUND. The ground attacked over was very much cut up by shell fire & almost all trenches obliterated so that some difficulty was experienced in recognizing any particular portion of the enemy's lines. Early in the attack Major Wardell was seriously wounded in the head. Captain W. L. Spencer Cox them took command of the Battalion until the arrival of Captain T.

At 2.30 a.m. there was an issue of rum. At 2.45 a.m. the bombardment of the enemy's trenches & wire commenced & continued till 3.15 a.m. At 3.15 a.m. precisely the leading platoons of A Coy scaled the ladders & rushed towards the German trenches to their front. It was now just daylight. As soon as our men showed their heads above our parapet the enemy intense rifle fire & it seemed no way affected by the artillery bombardment. The remaining two platoons of A coy followed the first line at an interval of 50 yds & B coy did likewise but when the first line of \"C\" coy had gone & the enemy's fire seemed as hot as ever our artillery was asked to open again on the enemy's trenches & this was done. The second bombardment, chiefly lyditte, took effect & lasted a quarter of an hour & then the remaining half of \"C\" coy & all \"D\" coy were enabled to get along & force the enemy to leave his trenches. It appears that most of the enemy ran along their trench to our right & excellent work was then done by the Brigade Grenade Coy who drove the Germans some considerable distance to our right.\n\nThe majority of casualties amongst officers and men occurred between our lines & those of the enemy. The remaining officers & men , Major Kirkpatrick, Lieuts. Furze, Philpot & Taylor Jones (& Lieut. Ross now lent from Bde Grenade Coy) & about 230 N.C.O's & Men advanced beyond the captured German line towards their final objective as shown on sketch. The 888 800 yds were covered quickly & with very slight opposition. Two more so-called German lines were passed & also LA QUINQUE RUE. The final objective, the German commn. trench M.6 was reached about 6 a.m. where we connected up with the Staffords on the right & a part of the Warwicks & Welsh Fusiliers on left.\n\nThis communication trench was only cover from view & in daylight it was impossible to consolidate the position to any appreciable extent. Owing to the inability of the 20th Bde (now advancing on our left) to push ahead we had our left exposed throughout the day. The Orchard at M.9 presented great difficulties & it seemed impossible to dislodge the enemy there. Major Kirkpatrick was again wounded at about 3.30 p.m. & had to retire. Lieut. Furze then took over command of the battalion. Throughout the day the enemy heavily shelled the original British line & the captured German first line & at about 3.30 p.m. we found ourselves subject to enfilade H.E. shell fire from both flanks. Many men were wounded & because the position became untenable & our left flank remained en l'air the remains of the Queen's, Welsh Fusiliers & Warwicks withdrew about 7.30 p.m. & occupied the first line of German trenches captured in the early morning. The battalion had done what was asked of it but at great cost. If the 20th Bde had been able to make headway our final objective would have been undoubtedly been possible.\n\nCasualties\n\nOfficers Killed and Died of Wounds 11 Wounded 8\n\nOther Ranks Killed 147 Wounded 237 Missing 42 Died of Wounds 6 Missing believed killed 2 Wounded and Missing 1\n\nTotal Casualties 437.\"\n\nNo known grave.\n\nRemembered on the Le Touret Memoria, Pas de Calais, France.\n\nPanel Reference: Panel 4 and 5.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.\n\nSon of Mark and Annette Sarah Godwin, of 24, Princess St., Camberley, Surrey.

If it wasn't for the experience of Captain Graham and Captains Beauchamp and Duff, the Miri Mission would have led to a disaster.\n\nOn the 11th of February 1912, near to Tali, Captain Graham was up on a ridge, when spotted about two hundred tribesman advancing on the head of his column, \"For a moment the position was serious. The Convoy was straggling and the strength of the troops available was by no means sufficient to hold the position if a sudden attack was made. There was, therefore, no alternative to immediate action and Captain Graham, putting a bold front upon a bad situation, cleared the field after firing half-a-dozen shots.\" The tribesman retreated and the column reached the village of Tali, safely.\n\nTrouble was brewing in the local villages, led by the tribes headmen, and the tribesmen from the villages of Rugi and Tali, attacked early morning;\n\n\"Captain Graham was laying in his blankets at work; Mr Kerwood was asleep; the sepoys, except for a guard, were either cooking breakfast or cutting wood some little distance away. All was peaceful when suddenly the sentry fired his rifle and shouted 'Sahib, the enemy are upon us'. Captain Graham seizing his revolver, jumped out of his blankets to find but very few yards away a party of three hundred tribesman, armed with swords and spears, charging down upon the camp. Firing as rapidly as possible, Captain Graham held the enemy at bay, as, with extraordinary gallantry and coolness, he dropped men shot by shot, the last falling as near as eight yards from him in the actual perimeter of the camp. It was a fine and plucky action, and saved the situation until the sepoys were able to reach their rifles. So soon as the rifles began to speak, the raiders fled. Twenty dead were left behind in the field, no less than ten being killed by Captain Graham in his single-handed defence.\"\n\nThe villages of Rugi and Tali were punished, and burned to the ground in the few days after the attacks, and the Miri Mission was abandoned.\n\nAwarded the King's Military Police Medal.\n\nThe official recommendation stated;\n\n\"Recommended for conspicuous gallantry and valuable political services.\n\nCaptain Alan Moir Graham is Assistant Commandant of the Lushai Hills Miltatry Police Battalion.

He was conspicuous for gallantry and presence of mind when a determined attack was made on the Miri Mission Force in the village of Tali, and it was entirely owing to his prompt and courageous action that the surpise attack was checked and finally repulsed.

Witness did not see his son with a knife in his hand outside the \"Wellington Arms.\"\n\nCharles Grove, son of the last witness, deposed to the quarrel in the public-house, and said that when they got outside Neville came up and struck witness on the left eye. Witness fell down, and when he got up Cumnor knocked him down again. Neville wanted to hit witness' mother and witness as well, but he was held back. Witness's sister prevented defendant from striking him the third time. He had a knife with him.\n\nElizabeth Grove, sister of last witness, said she saw her elder brother come out of the \"Wellington Arms\" and also saw Neville knock him down.

Her brother did not have a knife. Defendants were sober.\n\nAlfred New, a youth, who was subpoenaed, stated that when \"sky larking\" with Neville the latter struck him behind the ear. Rogers came up and said \"Neville mistook you for Grove. I hope you won't summons him.\"\n\nJohn Rogers, in defence, said that when the complainant came in, Arthur Grove jeered at him and Mrs. Grove abused witness. He went to speak to young Grove, when Mrs. Grove threw a glass of beer over witness' head. Witness did not throw any beer at all\n\nWm. Scott denied that the defendant Rogers threatened Arthur Grove. Maria Grove threw a glass of beer at defendant and used abusive language. He heard Mrs. Grove call out to her son to \"knife em.\"\n\nDaniel Neville also gave evidence and said that when outside, Arthur Grove, jun., took out his knife, opened it, and threatened witness, and witness struck him.

Mount Temple and disembarking at Havre on the 27th of July 1915.\n\nAppointed Lance Corporal, unknown date.\n\nPromoted to Corporal, unknown date.\n\nKilled In Action on the 18th of November 1916, aged 21.\n\nThe 7th Battalion Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment War diary recorded;\n\n\"On the night of 17-18th November, the battalion less \"C\" & \"D\" Companies moved from OVILLERS HUTS into the trenches. \"B\" Company to HESSIAN and \"A\" Company to ZOLLERN TRENCH; \"C\" Company moving up and taking over its attack front in REGINA TRENCH, \"D\" Company moving across into its attacking front. Dispositions for attack were completed by 2-30 a.m.\n\nThe morning of the 18th was extremely cold. A little snow fell and rain following, made the ground very slippery. There was very little light at ZERO hour except it was possible to see figures outlined against the little snow that had fallen, the conditions approximated to a night attack.\n\nThe assaulting waves moved off at ZERO hour in good line with the 7th Buffs Regt on the right. The connection with Brigade on the left was not maintained. The Party of dug-out clearers had both N.C.O's knocked by a shell and failed in its mission. The enemy seems to have been unusually alert, as soon as our barrage opened a large numbers of Very lights were sent up from his line and he opened a very heavy barrage on REGINA TRENCH, and to a less degree on HESSIAN TRENCH at 6-12 a.m. This barrage slackened about 7 a.m. Our barrage was somewhat ragged and not nearly so heavy as had been expected.\n\nThe right of first wave suffered some casualties from short bursts. At 8. a.m. 4 prisoners were brought to Battalion report centre. 1 of them stated he had ben captured in DESIRE TRENCH.\n\nAt about 9-30 a.m. as no news had been received from assaulting Companies, runners were sent out to try and gain touch with them. These runners after crossing REGINA TRENCH were in every case held up by rifle fire fairly soon after crossing REGINA TRENCH, and except for finding some wounded, failed to get any connection with assaulting Companies. About 11 a.m. a wounded Sergeant of \"D\" Company (who was consider quite reliable) was brought in. He stated that he had seen the assaulting Companies almost reach DESIRE TRENCH and that they had not suffered very heavily, although considerable rifle and machine gun fire was coming from STUMP ROAD.\n\nAs runners were still unable to get touch with the front line and no runners came back from \"C\" & \"D\" Companies it was deduced that there were enemy snipers who had been passed over in the darkness by the assaulting waves between REGINA & DESIRE TRENCHES, whose presence made inter-communication impossible. A similar situation existed in front of the 7th Buffs Regt. No information as to progress of Brigade on left had been received.\n\nAt 12-10 p.m. permission was asked to use third Company for clearing ground between REGINA & DESIRE TRENCHES. This permission was granted and at 4-15 p.m. \"B\" Company (Captain J. M. DuBUISSON) in conjunction with 1 Company 7th Buffs Regt moved forward to attack from HESSIAN TRENCH.\n\nThe leading wave (2 platoons) under 2nd Lieut. H. W. HEWETT, got forward to with 100 yards of REGINA TRENCH. He then met strong opposition from enemy holding STUMP ROAD, and as these platoons had suffered fairly heavily and become disorganised in the growing darkness, the remainder of the Company was not pushed into the attack, but used to hold REGINA TRENCH for the night.\n\nPatrols during the night of 18-19th November and on morning of 19th failed to gain any touch with \"C\" or \"D\" Companies, though getting as far forward as the junction of DESIRE TRENCH and STUMP ROAD. During the 19th it was plain that DESIRE TRENCH was not being held by the enemy, but parties of them were on several occasions seen moving about R.15. Central. Patrols during the 19th except for finding wounded of \"D\" Company could gain no touch with assaulting Companies. At dusk on the 19th \"A\" Company less 2 platoons relieved \"B\" Company in REGINA TRENCH, having received instructions to be prepared to occupy STUMP ROAD and DESIRE TRENCH in conjunction with party of 7th Buffs Regiment who had made good the latter as far as about R.15.d.77 by dusk 19th.\n\nOrders were received about 6 p.m. that the occupation of STUMP ROAD and DESIRE TRENCH were not to take place. \"A\" Company therefore continued to hold REGINA TRENCH and established posts at R.15.c.62 in STUMP ROAD. A patrol of \"A\" Company under Corporal ANSCOMBE during the night of 19-20th reached R.15.c.85, and heard parties of enemy moving near to this point. A number of dead of the Battalion were found about R.15.c.93. No trace could be found of any Officer nor of \"C\" or \"D\" Companies.\n\nFrom survivors of \"C\" & \"D\" Coys the following information has been obtained. Survivors have proved to be far from the best men of the Companies and their statements are accepted with reserve.\n\nFor the first 200 yards of the advance the attacking waves met little fire and the Battalion appeared to advancing straight on to its objective. At about 100 yards before reaching DESIRE TRENCH, it was seen that the left assaulting Company was inclining to its left and losing direction, part of the company crossing STUMP ROAD and that the whole Battalion was being assailed with heavy rifle and machine gun fire from both flanks. The enemy apparently emerged from dug-outs in STUMP ROAD and GRANDCOURT ROAD. (The dug-outs in STUMP ROAD R.26.a.79 were afterwards carefully patrolled and found to be equipped with trap door M.G. emplacements and it seems probable that these further North were of like pattern.)\n\nHeavy casualties were suffered about DESIRE TRENCH. The remainder of assaulting Companies were taken in flank and rear from STUMP ROAD and some parties of British Prisoners were seen to be marched to the rear. One survivor states that \"It was all over in 10 minutes.\"\n\nCasualties for 18-19th November;\n\nOfficers; Killed 0, Wounded 2, Missing 5\n\nOther Ranks; Killed 10, Wounded 75, Missing\"\n\n(Sergeant Arthur Tyrell M.M. was also killed in this attack.

On the 31st of August it was directed to leave Mhow at once for Bombay to take over from the Sherwood Foresters. The Battalion stayed at Colaba (were they removed ammo from a ship on fire in the dockyard) until the middle of November, when the 1/7th Hampshire relieved them.\n\nPosted to England, which saw 21 officers, 43 sergeants, 15 drummers, and 816 rank and file board the 'Gloucester Castle' on the 16th of November and head for England. On the 22nd of December 1914 the convoy reached Plymouth, then Romsey, Hampshire. They joined the 29th Division and were attached to the 88th Brigade at Stafford-on-Avon and Warwick.\n\nThe 2nd Hampshire was at first allotted to go to France, but then was dispatched to Gallipoli. Before they left on the 12th of March 1915 the 29th division passed in review of the King.\n\nPosted to Gallipoli, embarking at Avonmouth, Gloucestershire, on the 29th of March 1915.\n\nW and X companies embarked on the H.T. 'Aragon', Y and Z on the 'Manitou', 26 officers, 993 other ranks. Calling in at Malta and Alexandria, Egypt on the 2nd of April, and the island of Lemnos. On April 24th Headquarters, Y and Z companies left Lemnos on the 'Alaunia' for Tenedos, where they transferred to the River Clyde.\n\nPhillip took part in the Gallipoli Landings on the 25th of April 1915, he was with Z Company, 2nd Battalion Hampshire Regiment\n\nThe Gallipoli Campaign begun on the 19th of February 1915, with Naval operations attempting to force the Dardanelles, but by the 18th March 1915 the Turks had defeated the British and French attacks, three Battleships had struck mines and sunk, with a further three battleships and the battlecruiser H.M.S. Inflexible badly damaged.\n\nOn the 22nd of March 1915 at a conference between General Sir Ian Hamilton, General Officer Commanding of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and Vice-Admiral John de Robeck, it was decided to make an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsular.\n\nV Beach was three hundred yards long with Cape Helles and Fort Etrugrul (Fort No.1) on the left and the old Sedd el Bahr castle on the right. The beach was defended by a Company from the 3rd Battalion, 26th Regiment Turkish Army, equipped with four machine guns. At 6.00am on the 25th of April 1915 the first Allied troops begun to land from boats that were towed or rowed to the beach, and as the 1st Battalion Royal Fusiliers approached all was quiet. As the men begun to land the Ottoman defenders open fired with deadly accuracy, from the guns in the forts and castle. Some of the Fusiliers made it onto the beach, but were pinned down behind a sandbank where they remained. Out the seven hundred men of the 1st Battalion Royal Fusiliers who went in, only three hundred had survived and many of those were wounded.\n\nClose behind the first landing was the SS River Clyde, a 4,000 ton converted collier, with eleven machine guns on the bow and sally ports cut into the hull to allow the disembarkation of the two thousand men of the 1st Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers including two Companies from the 2nd Btn, the 2nd Battalion Hampshire Regiment and one Company from the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.\n\nTo connect the River Clyde to the beachhead, the Argyll a steam hopper was to be beached to form a bridge. The Argyll ended up broadside to the beach, so the Captain led his crew outside to manhandle transport boats into position to form a bridge and only now could disembarkation commenced.\n\nTwo companies of The Royal Munster Fusiliers begun to emerge from the sally holes and were immediately cut down suffering seventy percent casualties. The men from the next company attempted to move about 9.00am but this also failed. At 9.30am another attempt to get ashore by the Hampshire Regiment failed with most of the men killed.\n\nBrigardier General Napier was killed attempting to lead his men ashore from the River Clyde, before General Hamilton issued orders at 10.21am for the main force to land at W Beach, leaving the thousand men still on the SS River Clyde to wait until nightfall before attempting to come ashore.\n\nSix Victoria Crosses were won on V Beach on the 25th of April, and all belong to the sailors and men of the Royal Naval Reserve, who had attempted to hold the transport boats in position as a bridge between the Argyll and the River Clyde, and for also rescuing the wounded.\n\nAlthough the landing on V Beach had so far failed, a further 29,000 men had been landed on six beaches along the Gallipoli peninsular, in face of desperate resistance by strong Turkish forces, that were well dug in and supported by artillery.\n\nBy 12.30am on the 26th the remaining men aboard the River Clyde had disembarked and made their way ashore where they would spend a wet, cold and miserable night and some were wavering as they had either been stuck in the Hull of the River Clyde or stuck behind the sandbank on the beach unable to move and surrounded by the dead and wounded. A lack of experienced Officers after so many casualties led the Officers of the Staff to intervene and lead the men by personal example.\n\nLed by Lieutenant-Colonel Doughty-Wylie and Captain Garth Neville Walford the surviving men from the Munster Fusiliers, Royal Fusiliers and two companies from the Hampshire Regiment, moved as one large mass and stormed the castle. The castle was taken with all the Turkish snipers found within bayoneted.\n\nBy 8.00am the Sedd el Bahr castle had been occupied and the men turned their attention to the Ottoman Forces in the Etrugrul Fort and those overlooking the beach. The Allied advances were held off on the 26th and 27th of April and as Ottoman reinforcements arrived, and counter-attacks ensued, the possibility of a swift Allied victory on the peninsula disappeared and the fighting bogged down into a battle of attrition.\n\nKilled In Action on the 29th of June 1915, aged 22.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of Z Company, 2nd Battalion Hampshire Regiment wrote the following;\n\n\"September 6th 1915\n\nDear Madam,\n\nYour son No. 8361, Lance-Corporal PHILLIP HALL, met his death while rescuing wounded comrades from the burning furze, like a true British Soldier.

It was the biggest British attack of 1915, the first time that the British used poison gas and the first mass engagement of New Army units. The French and British tried to break through the German defences in Artois and Champagne to restore a war of movement.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment's war diary recorded;\n\n\"The Battalion was detailed in Operation Orders as Supporting Battalion for the attack on the German Line on Sept. 25th + was assigned a position in the old Support Line from Boyau 2 on the left to Boyau A5 on the right + with one Coy (\"B\") in the old forming line, its left resting on B2. This position was taken up at 1.50 AM on Sept 25th,\n\nMy orders were that immediately the two assaulting Battns. (1st L. N. Lancs and 2 K.R.R.S.) advanced the Royal Sussex were to move forward + occupy their trenches in the front line in readiness to move forward again in support of the Assault as soon as I could ascertain that the assaulting Battns. had obtained a footing in the German front line trench. at 6.30 am the assaulting Battns. advanced and the Royal Sussex immediately pushed on to our own front line trench. Owing to the dense smoke from the smoke candles it was not possible to see how the advanced was progressing but the wind had veered round and had carried some of the gas back over our Front Trench casusing a good deal of confusion for the amongst the troops of the assaulting line. My Company Commanders then on their own initiative at once advanced and pushed on to the assault the Battalion thus becoming part of the assaulting line at a very early stage of the attack.\n\nThis advance was pushed right up to the German wire which was not cut and at this stage all our officers and men who had reached or or close to the wire were either killed or wounded. The Ryl Sussex Machine Gun Section which had advanced with the Battalion endeavoured to reach the German Line but were annihilated about 50 yds in front of Lone Tree.\n\nMeanwhile the 15th Division on our right and the 1st Brigade on our left had succeeded in driving the Germans out of their Front Line Trenches, owing to the fact that almost all of my officers and N.C.O's were either killed or wounded it was very difficult to obtain reliable information as to the progress of the attack but it was evident that in front of the 2nd Bde the Germans were holding their front line in strength. My second in Command Major Willett went forward to endeavour to obtain information as to the progress of the attack, he was able to get as far as Lone Tree but beyond this it was impossible for anyone to advance in the face of German Machine Gun and Rifle fire.\n\nat about 11.45 AM Green's force attacked but at this time did not get any further forward than Lone Tree. a second attack delivered by the same force later in the day was able to push on further and at about 3.40 PM the Germans in front of 2nd Bde surrendered.\n\nAt about 3,15 PM I and Major Willett with Lieuts Baker & Wallington, collected all the men of the Battn whom we could get hold of some 70 in all and found a line close to LONE TREE + when the Germans in the front line surrendered I occupied their trenches and from thence pushed on to CHALK PIT where by order of G.O.C. 2nd Bde, we entrenched ourselves along the LENS-LA BASSEE ROAD with our right resting on the CHALK PIT. This line we held until relieved at about 3 AM on Sept. 26th when we returned to the old British Line in front of BOIS CARREE.\"\n\nOriginally buried at Le Rutoire British Cemetery. The cemetery was close to Le Rutoire Farm, which is on Loos Plain, near the village of Vermelles. It was used in 1915, and contained the graves of 82 soldiers from the United Kingdom and six French soldiers.\n\nAfter the armistice, Arthur was reburied at Dud Corner Cemetery, Loos, Pas de Calais, France.\n\nGrave Reference: VII.

Published in the London Gazette, on the 16th of February 1917.\n\nKilled In Action on the 25th of January 1917, aged 38, near the River Hai, Kut, Mesopotamia (now Iraq).\n\nFor the second half of 1916 the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force was to spend time on building up a force strong enough to resume the offensive towards Baghdad and to drive the Turkish Army out of the country. The beginning of the British offensive took place on the 25th January 1917 at the Hai salient to the south-west of Kut, which was to become the Second Battle of Kut-el-Amara.\n\nTwo battalions, the 9th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment and the 7th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment, got within 50 yards of the enemy front, protected by artillery fire, and after the bombardment lifted they entered the enemy lines. Although the 7th North Staffs suffered heavy casualties, they still managed to carry out their objectives. However, the Turks made a series of counter-attacks and were supported by shrapnel fire, trench mortar and bombs, which forced the North Staffs back on to the Worcestershire battalion.\n\nIt was at this point that the 9th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment were brought up from brigade reserve to make a counter-attack of their own. Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Henderson personally led the leading troops through the retiring troops across 500 yards of open ground in order to recapture the objectives lost by the North Staffordshire Regiment.\n\nAwarded the Victoria Cross for Valour. Citation published in the London Gazette, on the 8th of June 1917;\n\n\"Date of Award: 25th of January 1917;\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery, leadership and personal example when in command of his battalion ( West Bank of the Hai, Mesopotamia ).\n\nLt.-Col. Henderson brought his battalion up to our two front trenches, which were under intense fire, and his battalion had suffered heavy casualties when the enemy made a heavy counter-attack, and succeeded in penetrating our lines in several places, the situation becoming critical.\n\nAlthough shot through the arm, Lt.-Col. Henderson jumped on to the parapet and advanced alone some distance in front of his battalion, cheering them on under the most intense fire over 500 yards of open ground. Again wounded, he nevertheless continued to lead his men on in the most gallant manner, finally capturing the position by a bayonet charge. He was again twice wounded, and died when he was eventually brought in.\"\n\nLying out wounded in the open Lieutenant-Colonel E. E. D. Henderson was rescued by his adjutant Lieutenant Robert Phillips, who was to earn the Victoria Cross on the same day.\n\nBuried at Amara War Cemetery, Amara, Iraq.\n\nGrave Reference: XXIV.B.31.\n\nIn 1933, all of the headstones were removed from this cemetery when it was discovered that salts in the soil were causing them to deteriorate. Instead a screen wall was erected with the names of those buried in the cemetery engraved upon it.\n\nWhilst the current climate of political instability persists it is not possible for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to manage or maintain its cemeteries and memorials located within Iraq. Alternative arrangements for commemoration have therefore been implemented and a two volume Roll of Honour listing all casualties buried and commemorated in Iraq has been produced. These volumes are on display at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Head Office in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and are available for the public to view.\n\nRemembered at the Garrison Church, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire.\n\nProbate records show that Edward's residence at the time of his death was; 'Dalhousie', Gordon Road, Camberley, Surrey.\n\nSon of Major-General Philip D.

The 7th and 9th Battalions of the Suffolk Regiment had cause to celebrate. Their gains had been nothing short of spectacular, ground taken, minimal casualties and vast amounts of materiel and prisoners taken.\n\nAs they consolidated their gains; the 7th around the rear of Lateau Wood and the ground that dropped off it is rear, and the 9th, around the bridges and the hills to the east of Marcoing, they felt that they had thoroughly routed the Germans and that this might be well on the way to a large scale breakthrough. This was not to be and the German's on the 30th of November unleashed the biggest counter-attack against the B.E.F. since 1914.\n\nAfter a ferocious artillery barrage, the Germans counterattacked and broken through in a number of places along the Allied front line. Forging a wedge below Lateau Wood, they drove westwards between 7th Suffolk in Reserve lines near Pam Pam Farm, and their counterparts to the north, then swung round and retook the wood. In minutes the Battalion were in retreat and moving southwards. Those who had been wounded in the barrage had to be left. Everybody was pushed in a disorganised retreat heading southwest towards Gouzeaucourt. By the end of the battle, the British retained some of the ground captured in the north and the Germans a smaller amount taken in the south.\n\nThe 7th Battalion Suffolk war diary recorded;\n\n“Enemy counterattacked. 13 officers and 219 o-ranks missing. HQ and A Company surrounded and captured. Enemy broke through the division on the right and attacked Battalion in the rear”\n\nNo known grave.\n\nTwice mentioned in Despatches, unknown dates.\n\nRemembered on the Cambrai Memorial, Louverval, Nord, France.\n\nPanel Reference: Panel 4.\n\nRemembered on the Sturminster Marshall War Memorial, Sturminster Marshall, Dorset.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.\n\nSon of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Percival Henty and Charlotte Ellen Henty; Husband of Ethel Maud Henty (nee Moody), of, Ferndale, Gordon Road, Camberley, Surrey.\n\nHubert Herrington 1893 - 1916;\n\nBorn at Farnham, Surrey, on the 5th of April 1893.\n\nBaptised at St. Andrew's, Farnham, Surrey, on the 13th of June 1893.\n\nLiving at Lynchford Road, Farnborough, Hampshire, in the 1901 census.\n\nEnlisted on the 5th of September 1910.

Black Prince, on the 21st of April 1914.\n\nH.M.S. Black Prince was one of the four armoured cruisers serving in the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, at the outbreak of war in August 1914.\n\nShe participated in the pursuit of Goeben and Breslau. Following the escape of the two German ships to neutral Turkey, Black Prince and Duke of Edinburgh were sent into the Red Sea to search for German merchant ships, with the Black Prince capturing the German ocean liners Südmark and Istria.\n\nKilled In Action on the 31st of May 1916, aged 23, during the Battle of Jutland.\n\nThe circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after. As the British had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed, they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking. During the battle, the First Cruiser Squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet, but H.M.S. Black Prince lost contact with the rest of the Squadron as it came into contact with German forces, at about 5.42pm, on the 31st of May 1916.\n\nThere were no positive sightings of H.M.S. Black Prince by the British fleet after that, although a wireless signal from her was received at 8.45pm, reporting a submarine sighting.\n\nGerman accounts of the sinking of H.M.S. Black Prince, show that she briefly engaged the German battleship Rheinland at about 11.35pm, scoring two hits with 6-inch shells. Separated from the rest of the British fleet, H.M.S. Black Prince approached the German lines at approximately midnight. She turned away from the German battleships, but it was too late. The German battleship Thüringen fixed H.M.S. Black Prince in her searchlights and opened fire. Up to five other German ships, including battleships Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Friedrich der Grosse, joined in the bombardment, with return fire from H.M.S. Black Prince being ineffective.\n\nMost of the German ships were between 750 and 1500 yards of the H.M.S. Black Prince, point blank range for naval gunnery, and she was hit by at least twelve heavy shells and several smaller ones, sinking within 15 minutes, with the loss of all 857 hands.\n\nRemembered on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial, Portsmouth, Hampshire.\n\nPanel Reference: Panel 13.\n\nRemembered on the St. Andrew's Lych Gate Memorial, Frimley Green, Surrey.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.\n\nSon of Hubert and Alice Isabel Herrington (nee Laker), of, 'Westbourne', Frimley Green, Surrey.\n\nHenry Jephson Hilary 1875 - 1917;\n\nBorn at Tonbridge, Kent, on the 30th of June 1875.\n\nLiving at Dry Hill Park, Park Crescent, Tunbridge, Kent, in the 1881 census.

He died at the Casualty Clearing Station next day without having recovered consciousness.\n\nDied of Wounds on the 3rd of June 1917, aged 42.\n\nThe 17th Brigade Adjutant wrote;\n\n\"The whole Brigade has felt his loss. There was no one for whom we all felt greater affection out here.\"\n\nThe Brigade Chaplain said;\n\n\" From the very first he was in the very highest degree liked and respected by all. I used thoroughly to enjoy talking with him about Cambridge and the Classics. He will never be forgotten here. I admired him greatly.\"\n\nA fellow Officer who went through training at St. John's wrote to his wife Isobel;\n\n\"I was privileged to go all through the course with your husband and I feel myself that I have lost a very valued and gallant friend. The only consolation is that he died as I am sure he would have had it. He was imbued with a stronger and finer patriotism than any man I ever met and his sacrifice was not altogether wasted, if only for the fine example he set to the younger men at St. John's Wood. I certainly should not think my life had been wasted if I could think that I had had so good an influence as your husband had on the very many men he knew and by whom he was held in deep admiration amongst our fellow cadets at St. John's Wood. You and your children at least have the consolation of the memory of a brave and very fine man.\"\n\nHis Commanding Officer wrote;\n\n\" I , who had learned in these few months to love and respect him, can only act as the mouthpiece of the few of us still left with the Brigade in tendering you our deep sympathy. I know nothing to equal the splendour of the last few months of his life. To give up a great position to accept a junior position as a soldier, far below that to which his talents entitled him ; to master what was, to him, a novel work, full of difficulties and intricacies; to accept with unfailing cheerfulness the sufferings and the hardships and the dangers of a subaltern's life ; to have been an example as a soldier to us all—all this, and more, was pre-eminent in him, and will live in our memories.\"\n\nThe Statesman, published in Calcutta, India on the 12th of June 1917;\n\n\" We announce with much regret the death of Mr. H. J. Hilary, the Vice-Chairman of the Calcutta Port Trust. Mr. Hilary, it will be remembered, took leave a year ago, in order to go on active service, and he has now succumbed to wounds. A heroic death has completed the noble self-sacrifice which led him to exchange a great position in the commercial world of India for the battlefields of France. The records of this war contain many glorious examples of such devoted patriotism, and Mr. Hilary would have been the last to claim any special merit for himself. Nevertheless, for those who knew him and the work which lay before him, much sadness mingles with the admiration which they feel for the career thus prematurely ended. He had gained at a comparatively early age a post of much honour and responsibility. A vast scheme for the improvement of the Port of Calcutta had been settled after considerable controversy, and in its execution Mr. Hilary's grasp of the affairs of the port, his sound judgment and administrative ability would have been invaluable. He bade fair to earn a high reputation and to receive every recognition which the Government and the commercial community could bestow. All these prospects of usefulness and dignity he gave up for a commission in the Royal Field Artillery, because he thought he could thus best serve his country. While such a gallant spirit breathes among Englishmen there need be no fear for the future of the British Empire.\"\n\nBuried at Duisans British Cemetery, Etrun, Pas de Calais, France.\n\nGrave Reference: IV.

(CWGC records the 26th of October 1914, SDGW records 20th of October 1914)\n\nAfter the German retreat on the Marne, both warring parties tried to flank the opponent. The \"race to the sea\" in October and November 1914 extended the front to the North Sea coast in a desire to reach and secure the ports on the northern French coast. With the agreement of the French Commander-in-Chief (General Joffre), the British Commander-in-Chief (Field-Marshal Sir John French) withdrew British forces of the British Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.) from their positions on the Aisne battlefield. They moved to Artois and Flanders to extend the left flank of the French Army and hold back the German advance towards the coast. It becomes a desperate epic fight east of the city of Ypres which finally results in stalemate and entrenched warfare. It takes place at the same time as the Battle of the Yser, fought nearby by the Belgian Army against the Germans, and the battles to the south at Messines, Armentieres and La Bassee.\n\nAfter the battle only 4 Officers and 200 men remained of the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards.\n\nBuried at Zandvoorde British Cemetery, Zonnebeke, Belgium.\n\nGrave Reference: V.

Attached to the 9th (Queen's Royal) Lancers as replacements for casualties amongst the 9th Lancers’ officers by the end of the Battle of the Aisne were required.\n\nThe 9th Lancers were involved in the Battle of Messines in October 1914 – part of the ‘Race to the Sea’, in which the British and German armies tried to outflank one another.\n\nKilled In Action on the 30th of October 1914, aged 26.\n\nOn the 30th of October, the 9th Lancers received orders to take over trenches in front of the town of Messines. A report written by Lieutenant Colonel David Campbell in the regiment’s official War Diary makes clear that the 9th Lancers were overstretched and needed reinforcements. German forces attacked in the night of the 30th–31st of October and the 9th Lancers retreated through Messines. The regiment experienced ferocious fighting in the streets of Messines, during which Jack went missing.\n\nThe first news that the Hollings’ family had of the fate of Jack came in a War Office telegram dated the 5th of November 1914, stating that he had been wounded on 30/31 October, how seriously being unknown. A further letter, sent on the 22nd of December to Hollings’ father with a copy to Lt-Colonel Fletcher, who had been making enquiries on behalf of his daughter, quoted a report from the Adjutant of the 9th Lancers: ‘Lt. Hollings was wounded at Messines on night of 30/31 October. He with others was put in a house and since then nothing further has been heard of him’. A day later the B.E.F.’s Deputy Adjutant General’s department informed the War Office that Hollings was wounded and a prisoner of war. This led to Florence Fletcher initiating an official enquiry to Berlin, which elicited the reply, ‘unbekannt’ (unknown).\n\nThere matters stood until early February 1915, when a Lieutenant Charles W.N. Moncrieff, of the 2nd Battalion King’s Own Scottish Borderers, wrote to the British Red Cross Society describing what he had seen on the night of the 31st of October at Messines. ‘With regard to Lt J. H. B. Hollings, 21st Lancers, reported missing on the 30th October’, he wrote:\n\n\"I regret to say that in Messines on the night of 31st October, in the garden of the Convent school there, I found the body of a subaltern of the 21st Lancers. He seemed to have been standing on a ladder looking out over the garden wall, and to have been killed by a shell which had brought down the wall at this place, as well as the ladder on which he was standing. As the hour was very late, the night dark, and much to be done, I did not look for his identity disc, and next morning before I had been to the place again to identify and to arrange for his burial, we were ordered to retire from Messines; but if the casualty lists of the time do not allow for the death of any other subaltern of the 21st Lancers at that time and place, I am afraid that he must be identified as Mr. Hollings. He was in a remote corner of the garden, and it is probable that no one else of the Cavalry Brigade saw him killed.\n\nIt was not until May 1917 that the War Office officially recognised that Jack was dead and his family did not respond to the offer of Hollings’ name being published as a casualty although Jack’s mother, Nina, seems to have accepted that her son was dead by 1915, when she travelled to France to serve in a military hospital. Later in the War, she and her friend, Lady Helena Gleichen, trained in radiography and gained prominence operating a mobile X-ray unit treating wounded soldiers on the Italian Front.\n\nBuried at La Brique Military Cemetery No. 2, Le Brique, Ypres, Belgium.\n\nGrave Reference: I. D. 6.\n\nJack’s body was originally buried as that of an unknown soldier and he is therefore named on the Menin Gate. Following the work of the Grave Registration Service immediately after the war, his Regiment and Officer status were established through clothing and buttons found with the body, though the body itself remained unidentified. However, subsequent to an investigation in 1992 in which all the evidence conclusively linked Jack to this grave\n\nRemembered on the Eton College Memorial.\n\nRemembered on the 9th (Queen's Royal)"
