        "text": "Powell Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nThe last name Powell is a baptismal surname with two sources. First, it derives from the Welsh Ap Hoel or Ap Howell, meaning “the son of Hoel”, an Anglicized version of the ancient personal (first) name Howel in Wales, meaning eminent, deriving from the Old Welsh name Houel (an old male given name that became popular because it was borne by a Welsh King in the 900s AD).\n\nSecond, “the son of Poul, or Powl or Powel”, i.e. Paul, an ancient biblical personal (first) name. In Latin, the word paulus means small. Paul the Apostle, or Saint Paul, was born as Saul of Tarsus who taught the Gospel of Christ during the first century, founding numerous churches throughout Asia Minor and Europe. Although this surname has a reputation for being entirely Welsh, author Charles Wareing Charles Bardsley, in his 1901 book, A Dictionary of English and Welsh Surnames, claims this is a great fallacy and “probably half of our Powells are of pure English descent”. In Ireland, it is sometimes a surname adopted as an equivalent of the Galiec name Mac Giolla Phoil, “the son of the servant of St. Paul”, related to the last name Guilfoyle.\n\nThe name was first found in Breconshire, a county in southern Wales, which took its name from the old Welsh Kingdom of Brycheiniog (existed from 400-900 AD). Patronymica Britannica, a book authored by Mark Antony Lower, asserts the progenitor of this family was Philip ap Howell, whose pedigree is traced all the way back to Edwin ap Grono, Lord of Tegaingl, Founer of the 13th Noble Tribe of North Wales and Powys, who lived from 1017-1073 AD. However, other sources claim the family descends from King Hywel Dda “The Good” Ap Cavell (850-950 AD),the son on Cadel lap Rhodri, and grandson of Rhodri the Great (also known as Rhodri ap Merfyn, succeeded his father Merfyn Frych as King of Gwynedd in 1844 AD).\n\nSpelling Variations\n\nCommon spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Powel, Poul, Powle, and Puel (French).\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Powell ranks 91st in popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census. The name ranks particularly high in the following five states: North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, and Delaware.\n\nThe surname Isaac frequency/commonness ranks as follows in the British Isles: England (88th), Scotland (515th), Wales (23rd), Ireland (668th) and Northern Ireland (795th). In England, it ranks highest in county Herefordshire. In Scotland, it rankest highest in Argyll. In Wales, the Powell name ranks highest in Radnorshire and Brecknockshire. In Ireland, it ranks highest in Tipperary. In Northern Ireland, it ranks highest in Armagh.\n\nThe name is also present throughout the remainder English speaking world: Canada (346th), New Zealand (181st), Australia (144th), and South Africa (740th).\n\nThe 1890 book Homes of Family Names by H.B. Guppy, states the following in regard to this surname: “Its great home is in Herefordshire, but it is also very frequent in Monmouthshire, Shropshire, and South Wales. Thence it advances across England, reaching the counties of Sussex and Norfolk, and establishing itself also in Dorset and Berks. Powell is the contraction of Ap-Howel, the son of Howel or Howell, a common name in Wales. It is, in truth, remarkable that the names of Howell and Howells have, in a general sense, the same distribution as Powell. They mostly characterise South Wales and Monmouthshire, and to a less extent Shropshire, Herefordshire, and, strangely enough, Norfolk. The isolated colony of the Norfolk Howells and Powells invites some further explanation”.\n\nEarly Bearers of the Surname\n\nThe Hundred Rolls of 1273 AD, a census of Wales and England, known in Latin as Rotuli Hundredorum lists three bearers of this surname: Henry Powel (London), Geoffrey Powel (Cambridge), Mazelina Powel (Suffolk), and Hugh Poul (Buckinghamshire). A one John Powell or Powle was recorded in the Register of the University of Oxford in 1432 AD. John Appowell was documented in the Valor Ecclesiasticus in 1535 AD. Early marriages involving this surname were Jone Appowell to William Pypar at St. Dionis Backchurch in London in 1547.\n\nPowell Family Tree & Powell Genealogy\n\nPowel of Castle Madoc\n\nHugh Powell Powel, Esquire of Castle of Madoc, county Brecknock, was Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant, as well as High Sheriff in 1870.
