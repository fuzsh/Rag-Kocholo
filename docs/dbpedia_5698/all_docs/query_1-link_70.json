        "text": "O donovan History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nMany of the Irish surnames in use today have long rich histories behind them. The name O donovan originally appeared in Gaelic as Ó Donnabhain, derived from the words \"donn,\" which means \"brown,\" and \"dubhan,\" a derivative of \"dubh,\" which means \"black.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the O donovan family\n\nThe surname O donovan was first found in County Limerick (Irish: Luimneach) located in Southwestern Ireland, in the province of Munster, where they held a family seat from very ancient times at Bruree. Their hereditary territory were the lands along the banks of the river Maigues in that county. They were descended from Crom, the Chief of the Donovans, who built Crom Castle, and he in turn was descended anciently from Eoghan Mor (Eugene the Great), King of Munster. Amhailgadh II's son, Crom's great, great grandfather, was a commander with King Brian Boru in the Battle of Clontarf against the Danes, and it was at this time through marriage that they lost the throne of Munster.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the O donovan family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our O donovan research.

Accordingly, research into the name O donovan revealed spelling variations, including Donovan, Donavon, Donavan, Donevan, Donnovan, Donnavon, Donnavan, Donnovin and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the O donovan family\n\nNotable amongst the family name at this time was Donal II O'Donovan (Irish: Domhnall Ó Donnabháin), The O'Donovan of Clann Cathail, Lord of Clancahill (died 1639); Donal III O'Donovan (Irish: Domhnall Ó Donnabháin), The O'Donovan of Clancahill, (born before 1584), he joined the so-called Irish Rebellion of 1641 under Donagh MacCarthy and was accordingly stripped of his estates by...\n\nAnother 58 words (4 lines of text) are included under the topic Early O donovan Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nO donovan migration to the United States +\n\nIrish families fled the English-colonized Ireland in record numbers during the 19th century for North America. Many of those destitute families died from disease during, and even shortly after, the long journey.

Those in the urban centers would labor in the manufacturing sector, whereas those in work camps would to build critical infrastructures such as bridges, canals, roads, and railways.
