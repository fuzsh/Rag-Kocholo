Becher, B.A. This Gentleman was formerly an Episcopalian*, and was educated at Cambridge with a view to entering the Church. At the close of his University course he found himself unable conscientiously to take such a step and having a taste for an active life he came to the colonies. Latterly he has joined the Baptists, engaged in preaching, and afforded our friends in Sydney the somewhat unusual sight of a Baptist Ordination Service. The ceremony seems to have been performed without the laying on of the hands, either of the Bishop or of the presbytery-an omission the ill effects of which, either as regards his happiness or his usefulness, we trust our brother will never feel. * doubtful that Richard Becher was an Episcopalian Do they even exist in England or Ireland? He would have been bought up C of Ireland/England.\n\nGrafton~A short while ago, the Anglican Minister of this place sounded a note of warning to his warning to his people about attending dissenting places of worship, to which the R. F. Becher replied by a straightforward assault upon that gentleman in particular, and the system with which he is connected. This was enough for the Churchman, for ever since he has held his piece, and his parishioners are worrying him through the papers, asking where he has gone to and why he does not make good his attack upon others for the honour of his Church? We notice too, that when Mr. Becher began to baptize, it was ridiculed in the local papers. But our brother knows too well the ground he occupies to be intimidated by newspaper criticism or clerical assumption. Without doubt this opposition has helped forward the cause it was meant to retard. At any rate, we have cheering news to hand, to which we gladly give publicity. On Lords Day, May 13th, Mr. Becher had the pleasure of baptizing five, and on the following Lords Day he immersed two more. They were most of them new converts who had received spiritual benefit under his own ministry. And there are others asking the great question, among them whom are one or two notable sinners. Mr Becher took advantage of the first Baptism Service to preach from 1 Cor. i. 17 : Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, which he explained thus-  Not to baptize, that is to perform the act of immersion, but to teach the truth of Christianity, of which immersion in the name of the glorious Trinity is one.. We believe God did send Mr. Becher to the Grafton district to preach the Gospel and to baptise also, and our prayer is, that he may be divinely assisted to perform both to the glory of God and the benefit.\n\n1878 The Times Monday 16th September 1878\n\nMarriages  On the 12th September at Southwell Minster, by the Rev E Pickard-Cambridge, Uncle of the Bride .The Rev William Becher, 2nd son of the Late J D Becher of Hill House, Southwell to Edith Eliza, eldest daughter of T F Rolt, Esq, of Normanton Hall, Southwell, Notts.\n\n1878 16 November 1878 Freemans journal\n\nBecher- In September at King Williamstown, South Africa, William Arthur Becher, aged 20, only son of William Augustus Becher Esq. of Park Crescent, Brighton.\n\n1879 Freemans Journal Monday 6 January 1879\n\nDEATHS~ Jan 1 at her residence, Maida Vale, London W, Susan, Widow of Captain Martin William Becher.\n\n1879 The Pall Mall Gazette Friday 17, 1879\n\nMARRIAGES~Freeman~Becher  At Southwell Minster, Edward V. son of the Late Archdeacon Freeman to Honor H. daughter of the Late Rev.

Becher B.A. of Cambridge University, whose death was announced in our issue of yesterday, will take place this afternoon from St Jamess Church in Collins-street west. Mr. Becher arrived here in 1861 as a permanent resident of the colony: but he visited it first in 1855, as the agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society. He laboured here in that capacity for about two years, and during that time was married to Miss Jennings, daughter of Mr. Jennings of Melbourne, Solicitor. In 1857 he returned to England to Barnoldby-Le-Beck in Lincolnshire, of which parish he was the rector, and remained there until 1861, when he was offered the incumbency of St Jamess, then the Cathedral Church of Victoria. He accepted the offer, came out to the colony, and retained the incumbency until the date of his death. He was a very zealous minister, and until about 15 months ago when seized with the illness which eventually terminated in his death, was a most active and earnest supporter of all movements tending to the promotion of religion, morality and temperance. For several years also he was the editor of the Church of England Messenger. Although his death was not an altogether unexpected event, it will be regretted by the extensive circle of friends he had formed in this colony. The deceased had a large family, and has left a wife and nine children. Funeral services will be held tomorrow, in the morning by the Dean of Melbourne, in the evening by the Rev. Canon Chase.\n\n1883 The Argus Monday 8 January 1883\n\n THE LATE CANON BECHER\n\nThe funeral of the late Rev. Michael Henry Becher B.A. took place on Saturday & was numerously attended. The remains were carried from the parsonage in Little Collins-street to St Jamess Cathedral, and the procession was led by Dean McCartney, Archdeacon Stretch, and the Rev. Mr. Goodman from the Cathedral gate into the church, from where a large congregation had assembled. The first part of the funeral services was read by the Dean, after which Archdeacon Stretch gave a short address, in which he referred in feeling terms to his late brother, and bore testimony to the humble and true Christian character of the deceased. The coffin, which was covered with beautiful wreaths of flowers, was then carried to the hearse, and born to the Melbourne General Cemetery. There were five mourning coaches, occupied by the relatives of the deceased, the officiating clergymen, and the churchwardens, and these were followed by many private vehicles. At the cemetery, the Dean, assisted by Messers Goodman and Goodwin, concluded the funeral service. The pallbearers were three churchwardens, two representatives of St Jamess Bible Class, the deputy registrar of the diocese (Mr. W. E. Morris) and Mr. B. Whyte. The funeral arrangements were entrusted to Mr. A. A. Sleight of Collins-street.\n\nThe Very Re. Dean McCartney preached a funeral sermon in connection with the death of the reverend Gentleman at St. Jamess Pro-Cathedral yesterday forenoon. The interior of the church was draped in mourning, and at the conclusion of the service The Dead March in Saul was played as a voluntary by the organist. The Dean chose as his text the 54th and 55th verses of St. Pauls First Epistle to the Corinthians. When the corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be bought to pass the saying that is written-Death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death where is thy sting; Oh! Grave where is thy victory. It was a solemn thing, he said, when a congregation assembled together for the first time in the new year, and if anything could add to that solemnity it was the recent removal from this life of one who was well known, and whose death brought immediately before them the realities of the eternal world, as well as the realities of this present world.
