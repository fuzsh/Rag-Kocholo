        "meta_description": "Timothy John O’Donovan, a loving husband, father, brother, and grandfather as well as a devout Irish Catholic, passed away in Red Bank, NJ at the age of 88. He passed peacefully surrounded by his family. Tim was born November 14, 1933 in the town of Skibbereen in County Cork, Ireland to parents Patrick and Ellen O’Donovan (née Sullivan). The oldest of five children, he grew up on his family’s farm. At the suggestion of his cousin, Tim decided to immigrate to the United States as a young man, passing through Ellis Island before settling in Staten Island, New York. There, he met his wife Mariellen (née Donnelly), whom he married February 11, 1961.             After a stint in the army, Tim pursued a successful career in banking, working his way up to vice president at Marine Midland Bank in Manhattan. He also raised a family of five adoring children. Following their retirement, Tim and Mariellen moved to Middletown, New Jersey in 2001. There, they served as proud grandparents to their many grandchildren. Tim was an inspiring figure to all who knew him. His success in his adopted home country of America reflects both his drive and his intelligence. He had a natural charm and wit that came through in every conversation and he will be forever remembered as a consummate family man and a natural storyteller.           His family will greatly miss his vocal renditions of Irish classics, such as“Hello, Patsy Fagan. ”The farm in Ireland never completely left Tim’s heart and soul. He loved animals and fondly remembered the family dog Sandy as a great companion. He also had great interest and knowledge of investing in the stock market.  Tim is survived by his wife of 61 years, Mariellen, alongside his five children, Ellen Murphy (Thomas), Elizabeth Lee (William), Maureen Taylor (Jeffrey), Timothy M. O’Donovan (Sandy), and Susan Sessler (William); his siblings Ellie Keane and Patrick O’Donovan; his brother-in-law Patrick Donnelly and sister-in-law Cornelia Ryan; his eleven grandchildren, Christopher (Bridget), Sean (Kate), Daniel, Brian, Patrick, Brendan, Kate, Emily, William, Ava and Aidan; and a great grandson on the way. He was predeceased by his sisters Elizabeth O’Donovan and Mary Northam, and longtime friend and brother-in-law,  Cornelius Keane. Visitation will be Wednesday, February 9th, 4-8 p. m. at Hanley Funeral Home, 60 New Dorp Lane, Staten Island, NY 10306. A Mass of the Christian Burial will be offered on Thursday, February 10th, at 11:45 a. m. at Saint Christopher’s Church, 130 Midland Avenue, Staten Island,NY 10306",
