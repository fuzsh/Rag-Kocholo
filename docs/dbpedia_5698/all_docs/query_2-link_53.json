        "text": "This chapter examines the production of Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters, perhaps the most important publishing event in mid-nineteenth-century Ireland. In an age in which there was no separate Irish-language publishing community, it was an edition in both the Gaelic original and English translation of Annála Ríoghachta Éireann, by the Gaelic scholar John O’Donovan (1806–61). Today, the Annals continues to be a highly regarded primary source of reference for Irish historians. It remains a model of excellence among those who appreciate the more classical approach to typography and book production."
