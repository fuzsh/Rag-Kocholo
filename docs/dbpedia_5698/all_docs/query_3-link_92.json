Manuscripts will be considered on the understanding that they report original work and are not under consideration for publication by any other journal. The journal publishes original articles reporting experimental results of basic or clinical research, case reports, and reviews.  The journal uses a single blind peer review system and each manuscript, based on the results presented in its original submission, will be evaluated by two student reviewers and one faculty reviewer.  This process will provide an opportunity for medical students, graduate students, residents, fellows and faculty to publish research observation in a timely manner.",

        "text": "Abstract\n\nPsychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD), represent a significant global public health concern. Sex differences in the prevalence and presentation of psychiatric disorders, and the association of a psychiatric diagnosis with increased risk of suicide, are well-established. However, the neurobiology underlying these features of disease are not well understood. Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region responsible for decision-making and sensory processing, has been implicated in psychiatric disorders but remains understudied compared to other frontocortical brain regions.\n\nIn this study we investigated sexual dimorphism in psychiatric illnesses and suicide by analyzing publicly available OFC transcriptional profiles (RNAseq data obtained from the Stanley Neuropathology Consortium) from individuals with SCZ, BPD, MDD, and non-psychiatric controls (n=15/group).\n\nGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant differences in immune-related processes in male and female comparisons and in psychiatric disorders relative to controls. Analysis of top differentially expressed genes found changes in P2RY12 in males and females who died by suicide. Additionally, downregulation of protein folding processes was observed in female suicide subjects, suggesting an association between dysregulated protein metabolism and suicide. Our results further our understanding of the shared and unique molecular pathways underlying psychiatric disorders and suicide."
