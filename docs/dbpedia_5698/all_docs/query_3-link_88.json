Of these transcripts several copies have been taken by the anastatic process. Afber the transcription of such of the Law-tracts as the Commissioners deemed it necessary to publish, a preliminary translation of almost all the transcripts was made by either Dr. ODonovan or Professor OCurry, and some few portions were translated by them both. They did not however, live to revise and complete their translations. / The preliminary translation executed by Dr. ODonovan is contained in twelve volumes, and the preliminary translation executed by Professor OCurry is contained in thirteen volumes. / When the translation had so farr progressed, the Commissioners employed W. Neilson Hancock, LL.D., formerly Professor of Jurisprudence in Queens College, Belfast, to prepare the first part of the Senchus Mor for publication, in conjunction with Dr. ODonovan. The steps taken by Dr. Hancock' in carrying out the directions of the Commissioners, first with Dr. ODonovan, and after his death, with the assistance of the Rev. Thaddeus OMahony, Professor of Irish in the University of Dublin, are fully detailed in the preface to this volume. (Unsigned; Trinity College, 30 Jan. 1865.)\n\nPreface [Vol I]: The Senchus Mor has been selected by the Commissioners for early publication, as being one of the oldest and one of the most important portions of the ancient laws of Ireland which have been preserved. It exhibits the remarkable modification which these laws of Pagan origin underwent, in the fifth century, on the conversion of the Irish to Christianity. / This modifícation was ascribed so entirely to the ÍAfluence of St. Patrick that the Senchus Mor is described as having been called in after-times Cain Patraic, or Patricks Law. / The Senchus Mor was so much revered that the Irish Judges, called Brehons, were not authorized to abrogate anything contained in it. / The oríginal text, of high antiquity, has been made the subject of glosses and commentaríes of more recent date; and the Senchus Mor wouldappear to have maintained its authoríty amongst the native Irish until the beginning of the seventeenth century, or for a períod of twelve hundred years. / The English law, introduced by King Henry the Second in the twelfth century, for many years scarcely prevailed beyond the narrow limits of the English Pale (comprísing the &c, the present counties of Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Eildare, Dublin, and Wicklow).* Throughout the rest of Ireland the Brehons still administered their ancient laws amongst the native Irish, who were practically excluded from the [vi] privileges of English law. The Anglo-Irish, too, adopted the Irish laws to such an extent that efforts were made to prevent their doing so by enactments that passed at the Parliament of Kilkenny in the fortieth year of King Edward III, (1367), and subsequently renewed by Stat. Henry VII., c. 8, in 1495. So late as the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth years of the reign of King Henry VIII (1534), George Cromer, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, obtained a formal pardon for having used the Brehon laws. [*Patent and Close Rolls of Chancery in Ireland, 24 & 25 Hen. VIII]. In the reign of Queen Mary (1554), the Earl of Kildare obtained an eric of 340 cows for the death of his foster brother, Robert Nugent, under the Brehon law. The authority of the Brehon laws continued until the power of the Irish chieftains was finally broken in the reign of Queen Elizabeth [...]. *Ftn. Stat. 18 Hen. VIII, c. 8. (1522) recites that at that time the English laws were obeyed and executed in four shires only. — Vide Sir John Davies, Discovery, &c., in Thoms Reprint of Irish Tracts, Vo. i, p.693. But Meath then included Westmeath, and Dublin indnded Wicklow. (p.vi.)

The whole of it (with the exception of a few short and comparatively unimportant passages) has been taken from Dr. ODonovans transcripts. [xlxix] It has been carefully collateJ with the origiBal MSS. in every instance. The interpolations are all such as that distinguished scholar recammended, and are placed where according to the best of his judgement they ought to be introduced. The lengthening out of the contractions which occur in the original MSS. has been given everywhere on his authority and that of Professor OCurry, who were perhaps of all men that have lived within the last two centuries, the best authorities on all matters connected with our Irish MSS. preserved in this country. / With respect to the translation of the present volume, it is to be understood that the preliminary translation made by Dr, ODonovan for the Brehon Law Commissioners has been made, throughout, the basis of that now published. The translation of the first tract, the Corus Bescna, or customary law, he did not live to revise. It has however been carefully revised throughout; some words and phrases left untranslated have been rendered into English after mature consideration, and a diligent examination of all available glossaries, as well as of passages elsewhere occuiring in the Irish laws wherein the words and phrases in question were to be found.

P. Graves, Irish Literary & Musical Studies, p. 87. [Cited as The Banquet of Dun na n-Ged and The Battle of Magh Rath in Oxford Companion to Irish Literature, ed. Robert Welch, 1996.]\n\nJames Godkin, Ireland and Her Churches (London: Chapman & Hall 1867), quotes ODonovans edition of the Four Masters: Nothing is clearer,&; says Dr. ODonovan, than that Patrick engrafted Christianity on the Pagan superstitions with so much skill that he won the people over to the Christian religion before they understood the exact difference between the two systems of belief; and much of this half-Pagan, half-Christian religion, will be found not only in the Irish stories of the Middle Ages, but in the superstitions of the peasantry to the present day.&; (Godkin, op. cit., p.26; citing Four Masters, p.121.)\n\nFault-finders: Let those who find fault with it remember that no human production under the sun is without mistakes, and that frequently good workmanship is unjustly blamed through envy and hatred of enemies, and also through their ignorance (Note in Irish at the end of the Uí Fiachrach volume, 1844; quoted in Paul Walsh, 1947, p.168.)\n\nReview of Zeuss: ODonovans review of Zeusss Grammatica Celtica (1853), in Ulster Journal of Archaeology (Belfast 1859), is quoted in Alfred Webb, Compendium of Irish Biography (1878): It contains proofs of the purely Japetic origin of the Celts. It demonstrates the following facts: (1) That the Irish and Welsh languages are one in their origin; that their divergence, so far from being primeval, began only a few centuries before the Roman period; that the difference between them was very small when Caesar landed in Britain  so small, that an old Hibernian most likely was still understood there; and that both nations, Irish and British, were identical with the Celtae of the Continent - namely, those of Gaul, Spain, Lombardy, and the Alpine countries. This is, in fact, asserting the internal unity of the Celtic family. (2) That this Celtic tongue is, in the full and complete sense of the term, one of the great Indo-European branches of human speech ... There must now be an end to all attempts at assimilating either Hebrew, Phenician, Egyptian, Basque, or any other language which is not Indo-European, with any dialect of the Celtic. The consequence further is, that, as far as language gives evidence, we must consider the inhabitants of these islands strictly as brethren of those other five European families constituting that vast and ancient pastoral race who spread themselves in their nomadic migrations, till in the west they occupied Gaul, and crossed over to Britain, and to Ireland, the last boundary of the old world... The Irish nation has had no nobler gift bestowed upon them by any Continental author for centuries back than the work which he has written on their language. (For longer version, see under Zeuss, q.v., [espec. Webb, attached].)\n\n[ top ]\n\nNeglected: I have been lying here these nine days without a single visit from any of these literary men who pretend to be so much my friends; and George Petrie, who lives within a musket shot of me, has neither come to see me or even enquired after the state of my health since I left him. This is true antiquarian friendship. (Letter to Hardiman, Feb. 1840; cited R. B. Walsh, John ODonovan, The Man and the Scholar, in Cyril J. Byrne & Margaret Harry, eds., Talamh an Eisc: Canadian and Irish Essays, Halifax (Canada): Nimbus Publ. Co. 1986), pp.119-39 [note that this article includes confirmation of the birthdate date 1806, the other being due to an error in the parish record].\n\nScribblers: Our Irish writers of the last century have been a set of ignorant and dishonest scribblers without one manly or vigorous idea in their heads. Vallancy, Beauford, Ledwich, Roger OConor, &c., were all either fools or rogues who were by no means fit to demonstrate the truth of ancient or modern history. (Ordnance Survey Letters, typescript, Meath, pp.191-92; cited in R. B. Walsh, John ODonovan, The Man and the Scholar, Cyril J. Byrne and Margaret Harry, eds., Talamh an Eisc: Canadian and Irish Essays, Halifax (Can.: Nimbus Publ. Co. 1986, pp.119-39.)\n\nLamented: When my grandfather died in Leinster, in 1798, Cleena came all the way from Tonn Cleena, at Glandore, to lament him; but she has not been heard ever since lamenting any of our race, though I believe she still weeps in the mountains of Drumaleaque in her own country, where so many of the race of Eoghan More are dying of starvation. (ODonovan, letter to a friend, quoted in Dublin University Magazine, and cited by Yeats in Irish Fairies, Ghosts, Witches, &c., article in Lucifer [Theosophical Magazine], 15 Jan. 1889; rep. in John P. Frayne, ed., Uncollected Prose of W. B. Yeats, 1970, p.130ff; p.136.\n\nName-change: In a letter written to Larcom, ODonovan outlined the damage done to the Irish language by generations of English soldiers, administrators and planters. It was not only place names that had been affected, ODonovan discovered, but the surnames of the Irish themselves. People frequently took great licence when changing names, writes Doherty … (Eileen Battersby, review of Gillian Doherty, The Irish Ordnance Survey: History, Culture and Memory, Dublin: Four Courts, in The Irish Times, 6 Nov. 2004.)\n\n[ top ]\n\nReferences\n\nPatrick Rafroidi, Irish Literature in English, The Romantic Period, 1789-1850 (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe 1980), Vol. 2; notes Correspondence, ed.

Carroll, Mangans Age Complex, Irish Book Lover, [Vol. XXXII], Sept. 1957, writes (p.134): On the 8th of December 1843 John ODonovan addressed a leter to the Rev. Dr. J. H. Todd which commenced as follows: I was born on the townland of Attatimore (Áit an Tighe Móir) n 3rd of August 1809 (Journal of the Royal Soc. of Antiquaries of Ireland, July 1884, p.348.) The exact date of ODonovans birth does not appear to be know, but he was baptised on the 26th July 1806. (Bibl., Entries, relating to John ODonovan and his immediate relatives, JRSAI, Sept. 1915.)\n\nPortraits: There is a monument of ODonovan in OConnell circle, Glasnevin, records b. 9 July [copied in DIB], and by his own accounts he was born on 26 July, or 3 August, 1809; but his brothers baptism entry shows b. 10 Feb 1810, which renders these dates impossible [see Henry Dixon, in Leabharlann, Apr. 1906, and Fr. Sweeney in A Group of Nation-builders (CTS 1913), p.5; both noted in Fr. Paul Walsh, Irish Men of Learning, as below.\n\nHardimans hope: In Ancient Irish Deeds and Writings (1835), Hardiman adds a footnote at the end of the prefixed lecture-cum-introduction expressing the hope that the translation of both the Annals and the Brehon laws will be undertaken by one James Scurry - a project which, in the event, fell to John ODonovan and Eugene Curry: It is anxiously hoped by many of Mr: Scurrys friends, that his capabilities may be called forth, in the national task of translating the Brehon laws, the greatest desideratum, next to the publication of the Annals, in Irish literature.'
