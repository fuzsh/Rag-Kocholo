        "text": "The theatre director Desmond O'Donovan, who has died aged 77, played an important role in the early history of the English Stage Company (ESC) at the Royal Court theatre in London and of the National Theatre company, originally in Chichester and then at the Old Vic in London. With the ESC, he staged the British premiere of Frank Wedekind's 1891 adolescent sexual drama Spring Awakening in 1963; with the National, he co-directed the 1964 premiere of Peter Shaffer's memorable The Royal Hunt of the Sun, with Robert Stephens as the Inca god Atahualpa.\n\nO'Donovan's contemporaries were enchanted by his larger-than-life personality (he was a huge, intelligent and rather beautiful man) and his talent. But things came to a sorry end in 1966 when Laurence Olivier, who had always valued his contribution, banned him from the Old Vic after O'Donovan burst into drunken Irish song with Colin Blakely during a performance of Juno and the Paycock; O'Donovan was sitting in the dress circle at the time.\n\nHe did make one more appearance on the Old Vic stage. It was unscheduled, and came in the middle of Eileen Atkins's final speech as Joan of Arc in 1977. He distributed daffodils to the actors and went off again, while the redoubtable Atkins, one of his best friends, continued unabashed with her monologue.\n\nThe theatre had been his passion from an early age. His younger sister, Geraldine, recalls him entertaining the family with puppet plays at the age of five. The Catholic O'Donovans hailed from west Cork but had settled in the Midlands town of Hinckley, Leicestershire, where O'Donovan's father, Charles, was a GP for 40 years.\n\nDesmond was educated at Stony- hurst, in Lancashire, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he fell under the spell of his tutor, Nevill Coghill, and his lifelong friend, Ned Sherrin. On graduating, he studied for holy orders at Blackfriars in Oxford for six years, but he suffered a nervous breakdown before he was ordained, and promptly decided to go into the theatre.\n\nHis eventful 10-year career began in 1961 when he directed Robert Bolt's The Tiger and the Horse, a domestic tragedy about pacifism, at the Salisbury Playhouse. He then directed Edna O'Brien's A Cheap Bunch of Nice Flowers at the Arts theatre in London, before joining the Royal Court.\n\nWhen the Court's directors William Gaskill (for a time O'Donovan's lover) and John Dexter joined Olivier at the National, they took with them, respectively, Piers Haggard and O'Dono- van as their co-directors, placing them a good notch above \"assistant\" status. \"His timeless, dreamy, obsessive manner did not make him an ideal director,\" said Gaskill in his book about the Royal Court, A Sense of Direction, \"but he could sometimes project this quality into his work, notably Peter Gill's first play, The Sleeper's Den [with Atkins in the cast], and in his work in The Royal Hunt of the Sun.\"\n\nHe directed a near-perfect National Theatre revival of Arthur Wing Pinero's Trelawny of the Wells in 1965, with a heart-rending performance by Stephens as a budding playwright. When Gaskill returned to the ESC as artistic director in the mid-60s, following the death of its founder, George Devine, he took O'Donovan with him as his associate. O'Donovan successfully restaged Spring Awakening on the Court's main stage, reinstating all the cuts made in 1963.\n\nIn 1966 he was responsible for a revival of Ann Jellicoe's brilliant The Knack and David Cregan's Three Men for Colverton. But his work became increasingly erratic. He contracted hepatitis while rehearsing Wole Soyinka's The Lion and the Jewel that year. He began to experience bouts of manic depression which, said Gaskill, seemed to be aggravated by taking LSD.\n\nHe produced little more beyond Hamlet and The Tempest, in London in 1970, and the odd social irruption, such as taking the pulpit, uninvited, in Westminster Cathedral to preach a sermon. He became a regular patient at the Maudsley hospital, south London, and was befriended by the theatre and radio producer Bruce Hyman, who acted as his guardian.\n\nMore in hope than expectation, he took an advertisement in the Observer announcing a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream featuring a cast of ever-loyal friends: Sherrin, Edward Fox, Maggie Smith and Princess Margaret. These friends, rallied by Hyman, tried to make it happen in a private garden, but the project failed. He is survived by Geraldine."
