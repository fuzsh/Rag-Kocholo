I worked on this tree here in 2015, so this is largely an update.\n\nSaturday 15th July 2017\n\nWilliam Henry Retallick 1 was born 28 Jun 1847 in Luxulyan to Luke & Mary Ann née Pascoe and christened there at the Bible Christian church on 25 Aug 1847. He can be seen in censuses of 1851 & 1861 at Livrean, St Austell with parents & brother, in the latter listed as 13-year-old CCL (china clay labourer). In 1869 he emigrated to USA and on 14 Apr 1870 in Randolph, Morris, New Jersey he married Isabella Lecher, also from England. They had a son William John 3 months later, then a daughter Mary Jane in Pennsylvania the following year, but returned to the UK with them in the mid-1870s, as their fourth (& final) child Frederick was born back in Cornwall. This kind of thing is often associated with the illness and subsequent death of parents \"back home\", but I don't know the death dates of her parents, John Lecher & Jane née Tangye. Anyway, they can be seen in 1881 census at \"Hamlet of Rose-in-Valley\", Luxulyan - a nice-sounding place that I can find no trace of! William was trying his hand at being a mason, and this continued when they moved back to USA in about 1890 (his mother died in 1888, so maybe this was the reason they went home). In 1900 census they can be seen in East Market Street, Dauphin, Williamstown, Pennsylvania, with son Frederick, aged 9, and William John and his family (including 16-year-old boarder Homer Pontius, a relative of his wife Kate) next door. On 10 Feb 1907 William died, then in 1926 Isabella followed. Meanwhile 1916 & 1920 church records showed William John, Kate and Frederick devotedly attending the same Lutheran church in the same area until they ended up in Fairview Cemetery in 1940 & 1948.\n\nWilliam Henry Retallick 2 - see 28th Jan 2013 (and 21st Oct 2012) - nothing new\n\nHis son born Jul 1868 at Gilly's, Luxulyan was christened Willie Courtney Retallick on 31 Jul 1870 in Luxulyan (and had been registered as such at birth). His father being William and his mother's maiden-name Courtney may be enough to explain this, but there was also a Willie Courtney Retallick who appeared in the official Roster of Soldiers of Ohio in the War of Rebellion 1861-65, which may of course be a complete coincidence! He can be seen on 1871 census aged 4 at Gillys with parents & sibs, then 1881 at Innisvath with them and his grandmother. A fellow genealogist tells me he emigrated to New Zealand in 1888 with his cousin Thomas Tremewan Retallick and that he died there 22 Aug 1945 aged 77. I can see a trip he took in 1894 between Southampton & New York, in which he is described as a chemist, single, aged 26, but nothing in Australasia.\n\nWoodman Retallick was born 15 Apr 1874 in Luxulyan to Adam & Ann, although I cannot find a baptism. On 21 Feb 1881 he was admitted to Lockingate Infant School, aged almost seven, the address given as Savath. That April the census said Innisvath, and he was there with parents & sibs in that and the next census. On 2 dec 1899 in Roche church he married Emmeline Jane Collins, whose parents were Cornish, although she had been born in Sussex. they settled in Lanivet and had eight children, although two died in infancy. In 1901 census they can be seen in Lanivet Village with one son, then in 1911 at Stenalees with 5 children. Woodman was a CCL, as was his son Raymond. Emmeline died in 1938, so 1939 Register shows him newly widowed, living at Hazelmere, Lower Stenalees with son Hugh & his wife Muriel (Hugh worked on Road building, Muriel UDD), son Raymond and daughter Emmeline Verna, Telephone Exchange Operator. There are 2 closed files, maybe Hugh's children. Woodman died 16 Mar 1956 at Hazelmere, leaving effects worth £8256 to Barclays Bank, son Francis (a local government officer) and son Ernest (clay works manager).\n\nYvonne Retallick ends this where it began! She was born 25 Nov 1939 in Deptford, London to Agar Alexander & Kathleen née Nicholls when they were living in Greenwich. The only records I can find are passenger lists between New York & Southampton in the mid 1950s, and she doesn't appear on 1939 Register as she is probably still alive. The address she gave in 1955 & 56 was The Glade, Ditton Hill, Surbiton (an unmade road I cannot access on Google Maps) and she was a shorthand typist.\n\nAs I have now completed this round of study, as I mentioned earlier in the year, I wish to change tack completely an dedicate my blog to another subject entirely. I shall be following the route taken in the past by a very famous canal writer, comparing his account with the situation now and relating this to our own canal holidays in the past.\n\nPlease bear with me for a while as I prepare the ground. It won't take long\n\nFriday 14th July 2017\n\nWilliam Retallick 5 - see 28th Jan 2013 - please do, there's lots of interesting detail and stories.\n\nWilliam Retallick 6 was born Feb 1794 in Roche to Christopher & Mary Soby and christened there on 4 Mar 1794. He was Jessie's 3xgreat-uncle, as her branch came from his brother Francis. I can see in the records a William Retallick who married Lydia Bessant, emigrated to Canada and had a couple of daughters at least. However, as the marriage took place in her home county of Hampshire and his age was a few years out, I have my doubts... If it is him he died May 1842 in Ontario aged 53 and was buried at Columbus Bible Christian Cemetery. Daughter Harriet married William Hayes and daughter Lydia Zacharias Mark. (There is a record of an 18-year-old by his name attesting to the Canada British Regiment in Truro on 9 Apr 1816, which may provide the link and why the age is wrong - but he lied about his age in the wrong direction!)\n\nWilliam Retallick 7 was born Mar 1784 in St Wenn to William 9 & Elizabeth and was christened there on 18 Apr 1794, the youngest of their eleven children. The trouble here is that there are either too many records or none. There is a census record of 1851 that nearly fits, listing him at the Union Workhouse in St Columb Major, a 64-year-old widowed farm labourer born in St Wenn. But I cannot find him in 1841 and there are lots of suitable marriages, both in St Columb and St Wenn.\n\nWilliam Retallick 8 was born Apr 1774 at St Wenn to Henry & Elizabeth née Brenton and christened there on 8 May 1774. Similarly to the above, nothing else really fits.\n\nJessie's 4xgreat-uncle, William Retallick 9 was born Mar 1731 in St Wenn to Richard & Grace née Brenton and christened there on 12 Apr 1731, seventh of their nine. On 6 Oct 1755 in St Wenn he married Elizabeth, who always spelled her surname Retallack and I cannot see that they were related. She was the daughter of James Retallack and Jane Basely, born in St Wenn in Mar 1736. William & Elizabeth had eleven children, all baptised in St Wenn (with the spelling Retallack, just to confuse me) between 1757 & 1784. I have seen his Will document, coming into effect on 29th Apr 1808, stating that he died on 28th April in St Wenn, was aged 67 and a yeoman. As his wife had died the previous year, his eldest daughter Grace aged 10 forty years previously, and next daughter Jane died on the same day as her father (can't find a story here, although there may well be one!), he left items/sums to 5 daughters, 3 sons and a grandson. (I was pleased to be able to check the married names of the girls and they were all correct!)\n\nWilliam Drew Retallick - see 28th Jan 2013. I have since found a newspaper mention of the three brothers Elison, Fred and Drew, stopping off at the Cornish Arms, New York (441-3 West 23rd Street) on the way from Bugle to Houghton, Michigan in Jul 1915. The Cornish Arms is now an apartment block called Broadmoor (no, not THAT one!) but is still the same building. I must have passed it earlier this year, as it is near Penn Station. As I said in 2013, the brothers returned to Cornwall after WW1 and Drew married Millicent Blamey Oct 1921 and son Maurice followed the following June. In 1939 Register he (Maurice) is shown as \"Incapacitated\", but evidently this was not too serious, as he married and lived to the age of 69. In the same road can be seen Drew's brothers Arthur (Reginald, see below) and Frederick and their households. He was listed as China Clay Merchant (his brother ran the mine) and Millicent as UDD. I don't think they had any other children.\n\nOh, if you are at all interested in Cornishmen in New York, or the Cornish Arms Hotel take a look at this wonderful website:\n\nhttp://members.tripod.com/cornish_letters/index.htm\n\nTuesday 11th July 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nHenry Charles Gamble was born in 1845 and\n\nJessie's grandmother Tahpenes née Knight had the stroke in 1910 that killed her 17 days later\n\nThomas Sobey Retallick was born Jul 1841 in Bugle to Christopher & Ann formerly Thomas née Hoare and was christened there on 1 Aug 1841. I'm not certain when his father took on the pub licence, as 1841 census in June states his occupation as \"retail (illegible, possibly backer, meaning baker, he was listed among other things as a flour-dealer)\" and Thomas' baptism record as Farmer. I told the story on 8th May below (and 28th Oct 2012). By 1851 census Thomas can be seen aged 10 in the household at the New Inn, Carnsmerry - later renamed The Bugle and the village named after it. Christopher was Innkeeper, Ann Innkeeper's Wife. Also in the household were Ann's two children by her first marriage. Thomas was only 16 when he died here and was buried at Roche on 8 Apr 1858\n\nAs his mother Ann had died the previous year, the stone above commemorates them both.\n\nVictoria Regina Retallick - see 19th Jan 2013 - nothing new\n\nViole Glanville Retallick - see 20th Jan 2013. 1939 Register shows both Viole and Hilda at Trenisson, Portloe, Truro, farming. There are two closed files, probably children. I have since seen his probate document, leaving effects worth £7338 to his two children Charles Freeman Retallick, farmer, and Margaret Hilda Beard, wife of Henry Marshall Beard. Also this gives his address at time of death as Trenisson, Portloe.\n\nOK, on the home straight now. Tackling the Williams:\n\nWilliam Retallick 1 - see 26th Jan 2013. I have now seen the baptism record (it was mistranscribed as Retellick and his mother as Cathn) dated 27 Dec 1780. As I stated before, he died aged 34, Ann remarried 3 years later and died aged 71.\n\nWilliam Retallick 2 - see 26th Jan 2013. His children are a pain! The first, Richard, seems to have been born on the day of his parents' wedding - that must have been dramatic! - but then he wasn't registered, which had been mandatory for ten years by then. 1871 census names children not mentioned elsewhere (eg Jemmima - sic - the only one I can find was registered with mother's maiden-name of Seymour), and I suspect the youngest, Sarah, was always called Louie... Although both signed at the marriage, the ages & names given to census evaluators weren't consistent, which suggests they were illiterate/innumerate/both. William's burial record says his residence at the time was the County Lunatic Asylum, Bodmin. He died there on 14 Apr 1886 and was buried the next day in Roche. However, I cannot find any more details.\n\nWilliam Retallick 3 - see 28th Jan 2013 (the one I had to straighten out). Nothing new.\n\nWilliam Retallick 4 was born Apr 1851 in Roche to William & Elizabeth (Betsy) née Hancock (see William 5 following), just missing the census, taken on 31 March, and when he was four years old sailed with the family on board the SS Hooghly from Plymouth to Adelaide (3 Jan-19 Apr 1855). In electoral roll records we can see in 1903 William as labourer, alongside Alice, Charlotte, Jane & Janet performing Home Duties, also John farmer and John contractor. By 1916 also listed were George farmer and Mary Home Duties. This was in Lexton, Victoria, where William lived when he died 8 May 1918 aged 66 and was buried.\n\nMonday 10th July 2017\n\nNothing new on either Simon Retallick, although I have found a marriage and daughter for Simon junior. However, if his age at enlistment is to be believed, this marriage is unlikely as he would be 13. I have found a death at Fort McHenry aged 39, 5 years after enlistment on 18 Mar 1824.\n\nTerence Retallick was born Jan 1941 in St Austell to Hugh & Muriel née Rundle. In Jan 1961 in St Austell he married Valerie J Bonney and they had two daughters, Deborah & Karen. Electoral Roll records show Terence & Valerie from 1980 to 1984 at Dekaru, 24 Trethosa Road, St Stephens, then from 1999 to present (2014) at 9 Trevone Crescent, St Austell - both lovely bungalows.\n\nThomas Retallick 1 was born Jul 1858 in St Wenn to Richard & Hannah and can be seen in censuses of 1861-1881 with parents, sibs & uncle, in the latter as Ag Lab. In 1891 he can be seen at Princepark, Rosenannon, St Wenn (next to the vicarage), working as a gardener, servant to Joseph & Catherine Hicks. By 1901 he was back with his parents, but still working as a gardener, in St Wenn Village. Looking for these landmarks was frustrating as there doesn't appear to be a vicarage in Rosenannon or a Methodist Chapel in St Wenn nowadays to help me out. In the latter he was with his parents, sister Mary and nephew. On 19 Oct 1905 at St Stephen by Launceston church he married Jane Chubb from Devon and they had a son Roy the following year. They only had the one child, presumably because they were mid-40s on marriage. In 1911 they can be seen at Hill House, Roche with Roy, Thomas' father Richard (listed as \"boarder\", but he died later that year so they were no doubt caring for him) as well as 2 visitors, one of whom was Jane's mother. Richard, Thomas and Jane all died before 1939 Register, so Roy is shown then alone at Hill House, keeping the farm going. Thomas died on 28 Jul 1933 at Hill House, leaving £147 to Jane, then she followed in 1937.\n\nThomas Retallick 2 was born Feb 1769 in St Wenn to Henry & Elizabeth née Brenton and christened there on 29 Mar 1769. On 2 Jun 1806 at the same church he married Polly Merrifield and they had 7 children (although the first one died aged 8). 1841 census shows them at Carpet, St Wenn with five children (aged 15-30) and a servant. Thomas died there aged 77 and was buried 29 Nov 1846 in St Wenn churchyard (above). In 1851 Polly was living with son James at Carpet, acting as his Housekeeper. She died there aged 76 and was buried 28 Mar 1852.\n\nThomas Retallick 3 was Jessie's 5xgreat-uncle, born Sep 1726 in St Wenn to Richard & Grace née Brenton and christened there on 15 Oct 1726 (or 3rd Oct or 31st Oct by other sources), 4th of their nine children. I have sought high & low for further details, but the only really feasible record is a marriage in St Wenn 20 Jun 1754 with an Elizabeth White, however I have no proof this is him, and that marriage took place in Padstow according to some sources... I cannot pin down a death for obvious reasons.\n\nThomas Henry Retallick was born Dec 1860 in Luxulyan to William & Ann née Courtney and can be seen with them in 1861 census aged 4 months at Trescoll Cottage. Unfortunately he died aged 3 \"of fever\" and was buried 24 Feb 1864. They went on to have fifteen further children, and they re-used the name, as was the way at the time, firstly in 1865, not long after the first one died, but he perished in infancy too, then for their final child. So this Thomas Henry was born 2 Mar 1880 in Luxulyan to the same parents and christened 17 Apr 1881. Of their fifteen, seven died, including Augusta Courtney aged 24 in 1891 when Thomas was 10 years old (see 7th May below). He can be seen in censuses of 1881-1901 with the family at Innisvath, in the latter a Clay Labourer. In Oct 1904 he married Amelia Matilda Morris (aka Minnie) and they had one daughter Hazel (who travelled out to New York in 1929 to marry a Henry Bray immediately in Manhattan. She was a shop assistant). Thomas can be seen in 1911 census to have moved to Higher Bore Street, Bodmin and had changed his job. He now worked for the Council as an Asylum Attendant. I would think this was related to his sister Augusta, as this was where she worked too. The Asylum was just down the road. On 10 Dec 1915 he enlisted in the Army (described as Asylum Attendant aged 35 yrs 7m) for a short service or the duration of war, but on 8 Aug 1918 he attested to the Royal Regiment of Artillery for further service. I don't know what happened to him then until we pick them up again in 1939 Register. They were still at the same address, but Thomas was a \"Mental Nurse Retired\" and Minnie UDD. He still made himself useful, though, as he was still only 59, listed as \"Auxiliary Fire Service Telephonist\". Minnie died there in 1967 and Thomas in Jan 1970, aged 84 & 89 respectively.\n\nTuesday 4th July 2017 (Happy Independence Day to those Across the Pond)\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nAnthony Knight was christened in 1819, as were\n\nJulia Manhire in 1869\n\nJohn Manhire 2 in 1729 and\n\nLily Wooldridge in 1901.\n\nFrank Hennig was buried in 1901\n\nReuben Retallick was born Dec 1839 at Tremoderet, Roche to John & Jenifer née Rowse and christened at Roche on 6 Jan 1840. See 5th May below for his brother Charles & sister Charlotte, censuses 1841-1861 the same, in the latter he was listed as Miner, but he died aged 29 and was buried in Roche churchyard on 13 Apr 1870.\n\nLets tackle the 10 Richards: See 12th & 13th Jan 2013\n\nRichard Retallick 1 - brother of Reuben above and father of Polly (Sunday, below) - no new records\n\nRichard Retallick 2 - son of Richard 5 - again nothing new\n\nRichard Retallick 3 - father of Richard 5 - in 2013 I suggested that his father was John, based on his witnessing the marriage, but when I re-examined this on 12th May, below (\"Elizabeth Retallick 3\"), I saw that his father was Francis & mother Mary née Thomas. He (Francis) may have been one of the many children of Francis & Ursula baptised in Ladock through the 1730s & 1740s. Richard had 3 brothers that I am aware of, as well as another attempt at a Richard, born and buried in 1769, aged 4 months. I have checked all the births of children and discounted several, belonging to the other Richard & Elizabeth, so have returned to Richard's death occurring in 1803, burial 6 Aug at St Wenn. They had two sons and a possible daughter (suggested by other genealogists but I cannot find any evidence). Elizabeth died in Jan 1851, but I cannot find the 1841 census for her.\n\nRichard Retallick 4 - was born Jan 1775 & christened 18 Feb 1775 in Roche as stated, but I know a lot more now. He had six siblings, although one died aged seven and one aged three. On 5 Mar 1799 at North Hill, near Launceston, 25 miles northeast of Roche, he married Susanna Burnberry and they had 3 children there, baptised by the Launceston Wesleyan Circuit at Liskeard Methodist Chapel. Again I cannot locate 1841 census, but Susanna died before it was taken (she was 7 years older than her husband), and in 1851 he can be seen living at Barn Street, Liskeard, with daughter Ann, Richard a Retired Watchmaker, which ties in with the Apprenticeships I have seen, in 1795 he was apprenticed to Thomas Reynolds, clockmaker in Egloshayle, 10 miles north of Roche. By 1802 he was a Master Clockmaker himself and had an apprentice William Tapson. Those of you who know my interest in canals will appreciate the pleasure with which I read the following about this ancestor:\n\nRichard Retallick of Liskeard, a watchmaker and ironmonger, prospered with early 19th century canal building. He was on the original committee of management of the Liskeard-Looe Canal, subscribed and authorised by an act of Parliament in 1825 and opened in 1828. The canal had 24 locks in 6 miles, each lock rising 6 feet. The engineer was J. Green of Exeter, but the work was completed by R. Coad. Richard Retallick was Clerk of the Canal until the 1850's, administering freight charges and upkeep. In 1829, Richard Retallick issued a prospectus for another canal from Saint Columb Bridge to Mawgan Porth, and other works to make Mawgan Porth a secure summer harbour. This project however, did not come to fruition (Retallack Surname by Greg Retallack of the Dept of Geological Science, University of Oregon).\n\nHe died 18 Dec 1854 in Liskeard, aged 79, and was buried at Lezant on 22 Dec. This may be the house in Barn Street, it seems to still be a jewellery/watch repair shop, but this business only dates from 1966.\n\nRichard Retallick 5 - nothing new\n\nRichard Retallick 6 - nothing new except his burial date 25 Nov 1746 in St Wenn.\n\nRichard Retallick 7 - nothing\n\nRichard Retallick 8 - nothing new except exact baptism dates of 8 of his 9 children\n\nRichard Retallick 9 - nothing new\n\nRichard Retallick 10 - trying to fill in the details here, I found a son Richard Hicks Retallick born 1745 in St Wenn, a possible sibling for Simon, but the name would suggest Elizabeth's surname was Hicks, which I cannot trace. (He died in infancy, so was no further help). I have found scraps of information on 2 others, an R Retallick who worked as an Engine Cleaner in St Blazey in 1918 and an illustrious Royal Navy officer also Richard Retallick (1754-1813) who I was anxious to discover links to, but have not, I'm afraid.\n\nBad news on Sarah Retallick. She was born 12 Apr 1800 in Devonport to John & Sarah née Bellitha but I knew no more. I have now found a Stoke Damerel burial dated 1 Nov 1802 for a child of this name aged 2 years 6 months.\n\nMonday 3rd July 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nGeorge Thomas Wooldridge was born in 1925\n\nWilliam Wooldridge married Ann Martin in 1804\n\n\"Elizabeth Retallick 1\" married Gregory Tabb in 1746\n\nGeorge Matthews died in 1886 and\n\nJames Matthews in 1889\n\nRalph Clifton Retallick was born Oct 1905 at Stenalees, St Austell to Woodman & Emmeline née Collins and christened on 16 Aug 1905 at Beam, Bugle by the Bodmin Bible Christian Circuit. He can be seen in 1911 census aged 5 with parents and his 4 brothers (2 sisters had died in infancy). Unfortunately, Ralph himself didn't make it to the next record, the 1939 Register, as he died in Oct 1937 aged 32. He was buried in Roche churchyard and later joined by his parents.\n\nHis brother Raymond Retallick was born 12 Jun 1906 at Stenalees and christened 5 Sep 1906 at Treverbyn. He can be seen aged 4 in 1911 census at Stenalees as above. 1939 Register shows him at Hazelmere, Stenalees, the household now under brother Hugh - see 20th May below. In Apr 1948 in St Austell Raymond married Gwendoline Annie Gibbs, 15 years his junior, from Camelford. Raymond diied in Jan 1972 in Truro (probably in hospital there), aged 65, but being a lot younger, Gwen lived on until 1995. When she died she was living in a bungalow in St Stephen-in-Brannel, aged 73, and left £145,388 - probably mostly the house.\n\nReginald Arthur Retallick was born 17 Dec 1880 (and registered Jan 1881) at Livrean, St Austell to Luke & Ellen née Vercoe and can be seen there on 1881 census aged 3 months, with parents & brothers, then again in 1891. Bt 1901 census he was 20, an Overlooker at a Clay Mine, living at Bugle with parents & sibs. In Oct 1905 at St Austell he married Henrietta Carter, daughter of a Police Sergeant in Pelynt, near Liskeard. They had six children, although one died in infancy. In 1911 census they can be seen at Jubilee Terrace, Bugle with four of these, and they remained at this address [I cannot track it down now as everyone just used the address \"Bugle\"]. In 1939 Register they are still there [shown on the map as at Carnsmerry, changed beyond recognition since then by mining and then the removal of the railway], Reginald known as Arthur and a Captain at China Clay Works (by which they were surrounded!) and Henrietta UDD. She died there in 1968 and Reginald on 14 May 1957, leaving £1902 to son Gordon, male nurse and was buried in Roche churchyard.\n\nSunday 2nd July 2017\n\nPercival Retallick was another sibling of Olive & Norman, born on 12 Jan 1902 at Kingsteignton, Devon. He can be seen in 1911 census at Wisteria House - see below - aged 9. Again I cannot locate him in 1939 Register - the fact that the entire family is missing worries me, but suggests they were all together, spelled badly. 4 years later he married in the Newton Abbot area, probably Kingsteignton, Annie Walling, who I think may have been born in 1910 in Worcester. I think they only had one child, Suzette in 1946, and Annie died in 1985 in Torbay, followed by Percival on 9 Aug 1986 at home in Kingsteignton, leaving £44,568.\n\nPhilip Retallick was born Jan 1804 in Veryan to John & Sarah née Bellitha and christened there on 12 Feb 1804. I expected a stoy, but discovered he died the following year and was buried in the Plymouth area.\n\nPhoebe Retallick - see 7 Jan 2013 - nothing new.\n\nPhyllis Retallick was born Oct 1923 in St Austell to Elison & Louisa née Sweet. As I outlined in brother Gordon's section below, 1939 Register shows the family at Fairview House, Bugle and Phyllis is one of the closed records, so she is probably still alive. In Jan 1945 in St Austell she married Oswald Venton.\n\nPolly Jane Retallick was born Jul 1856 in St Wenn and registered in St Columb, to Richard & Hannah. She can be seen on censuses of 1861 at Tregurtha, St Wenn, with parents, sibs & Uncle John (a retired farmer), then in 1871 at a farm that seems to be called \"Carpet\" although I can find no trace other than this, still with uncle John boarding. In 1881 she was 24 and her father had relinquished the farm, they lived at Churchtown and he worked as Ag Lab. In Jan 1888 at St Columb she married her second-cousin Joseph Lobb Retallick (I didn't list this family as they are only 4th-cousins to my tree) at the same time as Emily Jane Lobb married Charles Skinner - she was probably Joseph's 1st cousin. I suspect Polly and Joseph had already had a child Claud, born and died in 1886, as she stated in 1911 that she had lost two children and I only have dates for one: Thomas born and died in 1891. They had three who survived. In 1891 they can be seen at Burney House, Roche (son Richard should be there as he was only 2 years old. He did live at Burney House after his marriage in 1916) with Mary Jane, Joseph's sister and a 12-year-old servant. By 1901 they had moved to Harrows, Lanivet and can be seen still there in 1911, each with 3 children, in the latter both boys working on the farm. Both Joseph and Polly died in Dec 1912, aged 56, leaving £1450 to the manager of a clay works and Polly's brother Thomas.\n\nSaturday 1st July 2017\n\nOlive Millicent Retallick was born Jan 1893 in Cockfield, Durham (reg. Teesdale) to Hart & Jane née Millar, sister of Norman (see below). She can be seen in 1901 census at Fore Street, Kingsteignton with parents, sister & aunt Ellen. Her father was stationary engine-driver and mother ran a confectionary/bakery from home, assisted by boarder Edwin Godfrey. By 1911 they had moved to Wisteria House, away from the high street, and Jane had given up the bakery. I searched the 1939 Register for an Olive Millicent and found a suitable candidate with surname Goody, but listed as single, working as Tea-Room Proprietor with what I took to be her widowed mother-in-law. However, I cannot find a marriage to prove this. Another puzzle...\n\nOlive May Retallick was born 12 Jun 1897 in Luxulyan to John & Mary née Toms. She can be seen in 1901 census aged 3 at Trenower, Roche with parents & sibs, then in 1911 at Stenalees. In Jul 1921 in St Austell, she married Joseph Henry Snell, who was in 1911 an errand boy but by 1939 Register was employed as a Stevedore at Fowey Docks. They can be seen at 14 Polvillion Road, Fowey and Joseph also worked as \"ARP Warden, Rescue & Decontamination\", which sounds useful but dangerous! They had two daughters, who on the Register are still closed files, so they may still be alive. Olive died aged 70 on 24 Jan 1968 in St Austell and was buried in Fowey Cemetery, Joseph joining her in Jan 1972 aged 76.\n\nPeggy Retallick - see 5th Jan 2013. I have found 2 more children for her, using the \"new\" GRO search method, but Emily died in infancy, so the name was used again. John got mixed up with William in the censuses but lived until he was 78. When Nicholas died on 21 Aug 1888, at home at Ruthern, he left £298 16s to John (farmer & butcher, like his father) and Richard, farmer.\n\nMonday 26th June 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nHannah Woodford was christened in 1831 as was\n\nWilliam Retallick in 1815\n\nCheveletia Knight died in 1941\n\nMyrtle Avanda Retallick was born 26 Feb 1901 at Mount Pleasant, Roche to Frederick & Annie née Lobb and christened at home on 17 Mar 1902 by the Bodmin Bible Christian Circuit. (See sister Augusta Ruth below for her early years.) On 8 May 1905 she was admitted to Lockingate Infant School, giving address of Savath. The 1939 Register shows her at home with her parents at Innisvath and husband-to-be Nugent is there with them. He was by then a Dairy Farmer, Heavy Worker (in 1911 census his father had called himself a \"rabbit-trapper\" by occupation!). I don't know if they had any children - I can't see any in birth records. Myrtle died on 9 Mar 1986 and was buried at Innis Chapel. Nugent (apparently known as Charlie, for some reason) was 6 years younger than her, and died on Christmas Day 1992. He was then buried with her at Innis.\n\nNorman Kenneth Retallick was born 4 May 1904 at Kingsteignton, Devon to Hart & Jane née Millar. He can be seen aged 6 in 1911 census at Wisteria House, Kingsteignton with parents and sibs, also his auntie Ellen Millar as Housekeeper. Oddly, he married Olive Binding from Taunton twice - once in Jul 1932 in Clutton, Somerset and then in Apr 1936 in Taunton. I'm not sure why, maybe they were renewing their vows, but you don't normally do that after only 4 years, do you? Again this was quite recent, so I cannot see any children. (The GRO birth Register search only extends to 1912). They certainly had no children in 1939 Register, where they can be seen at 63 Cedar Grove, Yeovil, Somerset. Norman was an Aircraft Fitter (an occupation I worked with a lot for some years!) and Olive UDD. She died in June 1987 aged 87 and Norman on 10 Sep 1989 at a 13 Park Lodge, Yeovil, a care home, leaving £100k.\n\nOlive Emily Retallick was born on 4 Jan 1901 at Fort Logan, Meagher, Montana (see Miriam yesterday for early years). On 27 Jan 1920 the census found them at North Main/Third Street, White Sulphur Springs, where Allivyan was working as a rancher. On 22 Jul 1920 in that town Olive married local lad Everet Harry. He had served in WW1 along with his twin Earl, who had been injured (a finger) & dismissed from the services, now both lived back with their parents, a few households away from the Retallicks in White Sulphur Springs and worked as ranch labourers. Witnesses at the marriage were her sister Miriam & husband Roy, (see yesterday) who lived 700 miles away, across the State. Everet & Olive moved nearer to them, as all four of their boys were born in Clark County, Washington and they can be seen there from census of 1930 (In 1924 Everet worked as a labourer for the Water Dept in Long Beach, California but the following year they can be seen in Vancouver and in 1928 he was a millworker at the Columbia Paper Mills, giving home address as 2912 Fairmount Ave). In 1930 census their home was in Minnehaha Precinct, Vancouver (a mile or two away), in Cameron Road [since vanished] and Everet was still in the same job. They had two sons then, but by 1940 census they had two more. They were then living at Farm Market, Clark, Vancouver, with Everet working as a butcher and eldest son Russell Everet as a labourer, both in a packing plant, stating they had lived in Rural Clark in 1935. Ironically for me, Russell fought in WW2 and was Killed In Action in England and is buried in the American Cemetery in Cambridge, England - this is only 40 miles from here! Everet was in his late 40s at wartime, so probably didn't see action, although he did have a registration card. He died aged 83 on 27 June 1978 and was buried at Evergreen Memorial Gardens, joined 13 years later by Olive\n\nSunday 25th June 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nPriscilla Woodford was christened in 1837 as was\n\nEli Woodford in 1843 and\n\nJohn Knight in 1701\n\nHorace Matthews married Elizabeth Munns in 1914 and\n\nJames Knight married Philippa Hooper in 1788\n\nMiriam Olivia Retallick was born 15 Feb 1894 in Roche to Alivyan & Alice Kate née Cock and christened there on 22 Apr 1894. As you know, Alivyan took his family to Montana in 1897, so in 1900 census Miriam can be seen aged 6 with her parents in Belt Township, Meagher, Montana. In 1910 she was aged 16 in \"school district 14\", Meagher, with parents and sisters. I have seen an application she made for a job on 20 June 1913 to US Northern Pacific Co. as a dining-car waitress. If she got the job she didn't do it for long, but met her future husband there, as on 30 Dec 1914 in Pierce, Washington she married Roy William Stambaugh, steam locomotive engineer. They settled in Tacoma, Washington and had two sons, Robert and Elmer. Unfortunately Elmer died in 1917 aged just two months. They lived at the time at 3607 McKinley Avenue, Tacoma, a mile and a half from where Roy's parents Martin Bloom Stambaugh and Laura E née Campbell had a feed store, supplying \"Hay, Flour & Feed, Lilly's Seeds & Supplies\" at 2324 Pacific Avenue. In 1920 census they can be seen at 6112 South Thompson Avenue. They did move around Tacoma a lot, as at each sighting they have a different address! In 1930 census they were at 1010 South 39th Street [numbering has changed so no pic] but from 1940 they settled at 924 South Grant Street, Tacoma and son Robert was also a loco engineer. As Roy died in 1948 aged 62, by 1953 Miriam was at the same address, widowed, then in 1955 at \"Box 192, Everett, Washington\". I cannot locate her death record, so she may have remarried, but I can't find that either. Robert died in Tacoma in 1992.\n\nFriday 23rd June 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nSusan Evangeline Knight was born in 1879\n\nSelina Lockton née Hatton married Thomas Clarke in 1862\n\nMilicent Retallick - see 14th Dec 2012 - nothing new except that I found another child, born Oct 1885 and died 6 months later.\n\nHer sister, Miriam Retallick was born May 1854 in Luxulyan to John & Mary Ann née Matthews and christened there on 21 Jun 1854. She can be seen on 1861 census aged 7 at Bilberry with parents & sibs, but has left home by 1871, probably in service somewhere but I cannot find her. She may well be in the Liverpool area because on 21 Dec 1880 at St Jude, West Derby, Liverpool she married William Henry Jones, local plasterer and the following year they had a son William Manford Jones. In 1881 census they can be seen at 35 Dove Street, Toxteth, Liverpool. By 1891she had returned to Cornwall and was working at Trewollack, Rosenannon, St Wenn as Cook in the household of widow Frances Harvey (1 of 5 servants), listed as widow. You will appreciate how difficult the surname Jones is, and I am not surprised that I cannot find a death for William or where she was in 1901 census. Apparently she travelled to Canada and/or USA to visit her brother Charles in June 1893, then on 24 Aug 1915 visited sister Bessie, now married to Francis Hockaday and with 13 children and living in Vancouver. She was a nurse by then and may well have helped with the babies. Certainly, her youngest niece was named after her. She had married a John I Renier, but I cannot find a record and she was again a widow by 1925, when sister Bessie died and Miriam settled in Montana with her brother Charles. It appears that he co-ran the Montana Meat Market as Retallick & Baumgart with a partner Fred Baumgart at 112 South Main Street, Livingston, Montana and lived at 301 S 6th Street. She died on 8 Nov 1932 at Gig Harbor, Washington but returned to Montana to be buried at White Sulphur Springs, Meagher, Montana. Her son William Manford Jones married his first cousin Eveline Hockaday on 15 May 1907 and he died of cardiac failure and TB in 1949. He was buried in Silver Bow.\n\nTuesday 20th June 2017\n\nSorry, the hiatus was a little longer than I expected, but I have a \"family\" excuse. Daughter Vickie (a Retallick) came over from Norway, and has only just gone back. Family time is excusable, yes?\n\nMary Ann Retallick - see 12 Dec 2012 - nothing new\n\nMary Anne Retallick was born Mar 1816 in Luxulyan to Henry & Mary née Thomas and christened there on 9 Apr 1816. From there, however, her story becomes vague. There is a servant of that name aged 25 in 1841 census, one of six in the service of merchant Alfred Fox & family in Falmouth - and a death aged 27 two years later to go with it. There is also a marriage in 1844 in Bodmin, but no spouse given to follow through.\n\nThe other Mary Anne Retallick I covered in 2012 (13th Dec) and there is nothing new.\n\nMary Jane Retallick was also covered on 13th Dec 2012. I have now seen her detailed Death Record, stating her cause of death was due to \"infection caused by dead foetus\", quite graphic! But at least I know why her child wasn't baptised/christened. If a baby never breathed they were deemed to have never existed, so had no need to be baptised.\n\nThere was another Mary Jane Retallick, born Jul 1836 in Roche to James & Mary Ann née Stephens. She can be seen in censuses of 1841 & 1851 at Polskeys, Roche with parents & latterly sister. On 13 Nov in Roche she married \"John Retallick 10\" (both signed, bride was stated to be under-age as she was 20 and majority was 21, one witness was John's brother Reuben) - see 30th Sep 2012 for the rest of the story.\n\nMelinda Retallick was born Sep 1846 in Luxulyan to John & Ann née Chapman and christened there on 20 Sep 1846 by the Bible Christians. She can be seen in census of 1851 aged 5 at Lower Ennisvath with parents & sibs. In 1861 she was a general servant aged 14 in Bowdens, Roche and on 29 Jan 1870 in Bodmin she married John Nankivell, both fathers John, labourers. They settled at St Breock and can be seen there in censuses of 1871 & 1881, had three children, all registered in St Columb Major area, and in 1881 had John Mortimer, professional actor and family boarding with them [not the one who played Rumpole of the Bailey etc, as he was born 80 years later!] in Back Lane. In 1891 the house was called Treguddick, but may have been the same. By 1901 they had moved to Trevanion Road, Wadebridge and can be seen there with all three children, daughter Mary now married, in 1911 the same. John died there in 1916 and Melinda on 17 Feb 1921. She was buried 21 Feb 1921 at St Breock churchyard\n\nTuesday 13th June 2017\n\nMary Retallick 1 was born 25 Apr 1898 in Darlington, County Durham and unfortunately this resulted in the death of her mother, who she was then named after. She can be seen in census of 1901 aged 2 at Hannaford Estate, Widdecombe-on-the-Moor, Devon with grandparents, father, sibs & servant, then in 1911 with same at Higher Putsham, Buckland. She never married and presumably nursed her grandparents, father & brother at home. I have told of 1939 Register - see \"Charles 1\" & \"John 12\" below, at 11 Sandygate, Newton Abbot. She died aged 72 alone in Newton Abbot (possibly the same house) in Apr 1970.\n\nMary Retallick 2 was born Apr 1770 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth and christened there on 19 May 1770. On 14 Oct 1792 at the same church she married blacksmith Thomas Mill from St Columb Major and they lived at St Columb Bridge [a lovely road at the north side of the village, all old houses but I cannot track one down as a forge]. He died aged 56 & was buried at St Columb Major on 10 Dec 1823, Mary followed nine years later and was buried with him on 18 Jan 1832.\n\nMary Retallick 3 was born late in 1831 at Savath, Luxulyan to John & Ann née Chapman, (after a previous incarnation had died in 1829 aged 4) and was christened there on 8 Jan 1832. She can be seen in 1841 census aged 9 at Savath with parents & sibs, then in 1851 at Lamorick, Lanivet aged 19, working as a house servant to farmer Elizabeth Marshall & family. It seems the families were close, as when she, on 23 Aug 1851 in Lanivet, got married to John Miners from Probus, one of the witnesses was William Marshall (the other was her father John). They went on to have 17 children, but by 1911 twelve had died - at between ages 0 & 30 - and four had emigrated to California, USA. Only the eldest (William Henry, registered as Thomas) and Mary Hannah (child 11) lived to adulthood in UK. These photos show some members of the family at the wedding of James, 15th child, in Jul 1899 in Cumberland. Unfortunately neither Mary nor John is there. In census records they can be seen with an assortment of children & grandchildren (Lydia's children - child 9 - as she died when they were small) in Camborne, from 1871 onwards at Penponds, where Mary died in Sep 1911 and John the following year and were buried in the churchyard there. [I did note on their marriage record that they both \"made their mark\" because they were illiterate. This did not help me in my epic trawl through all these births; for example they didn't notice that they registered their eldest as Thomas then proceeded to call him William Henry all his life. Also, Mary Hannah was almost always entered on censuses etc as Mary Ann and Allivyan (x2) was spelled in a variety of different ways!]\n\nMonday 12th June 2017\n\nTwo Lukes are next. Luke Retallick Senior was born May 1820 at Higher Menadew, Luxulyan to Henry & Mary née Thomas and christened on 25 Jun 1820 at Luxulyan. He worked for 40+ years as a tinner and can be seen in censuses of 1841-71 at Livrean Moor, St Austell in 1841 with parents & sibs, then on 13 Aug 1846 in St Austell he married Mary Ann Pascoe, farmer's daughter from Luxulyan. They moved in next door to his parents at Livrean and had two sons. In 1881 census they had moved to Lockingate and Luke was working as Ag Lab until he died and was buried on 18 Mar 1894 in Treverbyn. Mary Ann had died on 14 Oct 1888.\n\nHis two sons: William Henry emigrated to USA and Luke Retallick Junior stayed in Cornwall. Junior was born Dec 1849 at Livrean and christened by the Bible Christians on 11 Sep 1850. In Nov 2012 when reporting on his grave I said: Luke Retallick Junior was born in December 1849 at Livrean to Luke and Mary Ann nee Pascoe, and lived with them and brother William until he married in 1874. He worked as a China Clay Labourer, as did most people in the area, but after his marriage, Luke turned to working as a Packer on the railway, then an Agricultural Labourer in order to support his growing family. There were 14 children born, but only 7 survived childhood. By 1901 they can be seen living at Bugle, Luke listed as a Clay Merchant, Employer, working from home, with a servant. In 1911 they are living in Fair View, Bugle (a large house with 10 rooms, excluding bathroom - there are several terraced tenements on the site today) with 5 children, and when he died in 1929 he left effects worth £7400 to sons Reginald & Elison, clay merchants, and this handsome headstone. In 1935 Ellen died, and her inscription was added to the side.\n\nI can add today that on 14 Aug 1871 he went out to America to visit brother William and his two children. I see that William & Isabella had been in England, visiting her family in the April, so Luke probably made arrangements then for a return trip. He married 3 years later and produced the dynasty I mentioned above.\n\nMargery Honor Retallick was one of his grandchildren, born Apr 1913 at St Austell to Reginald & Henrietta née Carter. In Mar 1937 in St Austell she married farmer William Joseph Wherry and they had two children. 1939 Register shows them before they started their family, at Higher Penquite, St Austell, which I hadn't heard of but turns out to be 9 miles south east of Bugle, at Golant. Margery died aged 70 in Dec 1983 and William aged 79 on 11 Sep 1990 at Roselea, Indian Queens, St Columb Major, leaving \"not exceeding £115k\".\n\nMaria Retallick - see 9th Dec 2012. The servant in their household in 1861 was Melinda Retallick, and I have tracked her down to the daughter of John & Ann née Chapman (see later)\n\nMarina Retallick was born Jul 1862 at Trescoll, Luxulyan to William & Ann née Courtney and christened on 29 Mar 1863 in Luxulyan, sister of \"Louisa 3\" I mentioned yesterday. In 1871 she was aged 8 at Gillys with parents & sibs and in 1881 aged 18 in household of Richard Vercoe (maybe a relative of Luke Junior's wife Ellen, although I cannot find a link), Silk Mercer & Draper, in Fore Street, Bodmin, working as a general servant, her sister Alma also. In Dec 1890 in Bodmin she married Robert Bray, a carpenter apprenticed to his father, who interestingly was also an attendant at the Bodmin Mental Asylum (although he was retired by the time Lavina was there). They had 5 children over nine years and can be seen with them in 1891-1911 at this house in St Leonards, Bodmin, aka Town End. By 1939 Register, there were only 3 remaining in the household and Robert was long retired, so they had downsized by moving across the road into a much smaller cottage, number 22. Mabel remained with them, looking after her parents (in their late 70s) and taking in dressmaking. Marina died aged 87 & was buried on 29 Mar 1950 in Bodmin Old Cemetery, followed two years later by Robert, leaving £980 to daughters Mabel & Lucy.\n\nMartin Drew Retallick was born Mar 1875 at Livrean to Luke & Ellen née Vercoe. He can be seen in censuses of 1881 & 1891 at Livrean with parents & sibs, in the latter aged 16 & working on the land. Unfortunately he died aged 18 and was buried at Treverbyn on 26 Jun 1892.\n\nI shall tackle the various Marys tomorrow.\n\nSunday 11th June 2017\n\nLilian Retallick was born Jan 1890 in Withiel to Christopher & Mary née Lutey and can be seen there in 1891 census aged 1 at Bridgemans House with grandmother, parents, uncles & cousin. 7 weeks later they set sail for Australia, arriving in Brisbane on 20 Jul 1891 and remaining there for some years. I cannot track down the return journey, but the family were back on English soil for the birth of her brother Harry in 1903. 1911 census shows them settled in Millom, at 46/48 Queen Street, the fish & chip shop, and Lilian can be seen aged 21 with parents, brother & two servants. In Oct 1916 in the Bootle area (probably Millom) she married James Henry Edwards from Whitehaven, Cumbria. He was originally an iron miner and set off in 1923 to investigate America while Lilian brought a third daughter into the world. In 1929 she had a fourth child, this time a boy and almost immediately set off to Michigan, where James had a job as an \"auto worker at auto factory\". The following year 1930 census found them at 504 Begole Street, Flint, Michigan. However, I suspect Lilian was unhappy there, or unwell, as she returned to Millom in the 1930s and died there on 26 Jun 1937 at 75 Wellington Street, leaving £654 to brothers Wilfred & Thomas Kantenwein (don't know them). James remarried in 1939 - to a Mary Campbell but I don't know where they settled so cannot trace them in 1939 Register 3 months later, or at his death.\n\nLilian Maud Retallick was born Dec 1888 at Levrean Bridge, St Austell to Luke & Ellen née Vercoe and christened on 22 Apr 1889 at Treverbyn (brother Frederick had been buried aged one year on 9 Apr). She can be seen in censuses of 1891 at Livrean, 1901 & 1911 in Bugle, with parents & sibs. In Oct 1935 in Devonport, Devon she married Francis P Couch, a State-Registered Mental Nurse, and can be seen with him on 1939 Register at 33 Forest Avenue, Plymouth. As she was 47 at marriage it is no surprise that they had no children. She died there aged 57 in Oct 1945 and Francis followed 12 years later. At that time he still lived at the house above, but died at Freedom Fields Hospital, Plymouth, leaving effects worth £1293 to his brother Harry, house decorator.\n\nLouisa Retallick 1 was born Oct 1875 in Roche to Allivyan & Mary née Liddicoat after a previous incarnation of the same name was buried on 4 Nov 1870 aged 1 year 8 months. She can be seen on censuses of 1881 & 1891 at Rosemelling Moor, Roche with parents & sister (Liddicoats next door). In Oct 1897 at Roche church she married Joseph Hosking, CCL from St Columb and moved in next door to her parents, where they can be seen in 1901 census. They had no children and by 1911 were living at Penstraze Villa, Victoria, Roche with Joseph's uncle, a retired tinner, and a servant. In 1939 Register they were at West End, Roche, Joseph now retired (he was 70) and he died in 1946 aged 77, Louisa following on 3 May 1960 aged 84 at Providence House, Carthew, leaving £427 to a solicitor.\n\nLouisa Retallick 2 was born Jan 1843 in Luxulyan to John & Ann née Chapman and christened by the local Bible Christians on 7 Apr 1843. She can be seen in 1851 census aged 8 at Lower Ennisvath with parents & sibs and in 1861 at Savath with parents, brother & son Thomas Tremewan Retallick, which suggests his father was Mr Tremewan. She never married him, but that may be because she died in Oct 1865 aged only 22. (Thomas went on to emigrate to New Zealand in 1881, married in 1889, had a daughter and was almost immediately widowed. He died in 1927 aged 66.)\n\nLouisa Retallick 3 was born 14 Mar 1870 at Gillys, Luxulyan to William & Ann née Courtney and christened at Luxulyan on 31 Jul 1870. She can be seen in censuses of 1871 at Gillys, 1881 & 1891 at Innisvath with parents & sibs. I have seen her admission document to Lockingate Infant School dated 3 Jul 1882. In Apr 1893 at the same church she married Richard Hicks, CCL, and settled with him at Netley (after the first child Lily was born in Luxulyan), which is I understand, the southern end of Bugle. They had 8 children, but two girls died in infancy. By 1939 Register they had moved half a mile up the road and can be seen at 3 New Street, Bugle with son Percy (also a CCL) & his wife. I must admit I was surprised to see them there, as I had her dying in 1937, and he was listed as \"Dick Hicks\", so led me astray for a while. I now see she died in Sep 1949 aged 79, and now I know to look for Dick Hicks, I found he died at New Street on 14 May 1951, leaving effects worth £785 to son Leonard Courtney Hicks, transport manager.\n\nSaturday 10th June 2017\n\nJoseph Nicholls Retallick was born 28 Apr 1854 in St Austell to Harriet - see 17th May below - illegitimate child of (probably) a man called Nicholls, going by the middle name, who didn't/couldn't marry his mother and she ended up in an asylum. Joseph, as I stated, worked as a Navvy, digging tunnels in Wales, met Henrietta Davies and married her in Apr 1878 in Merthyr Tydfil. However, after the 1881 census in Caldicot, Wales I cannot find either of them. They may have emigrated, listed as Mr & Mrs, there are a few of those, but I cannot prove anything.\n\nKitty Retallick was born Jul 1829 in Luxulyan to Henry & Mary née Thomas and christened there on 9 Aug 1829. She can be seen in census of 1841 at Livrean Moor aged 13 with parents & sibs, and the same in 1851, when she was listed as CCL. On 12 Sep 1852 at Treverbyn she married John Martyn/Martin, son of Clay Agent also John. Both bride & groom were staying at The Bugle. They went on to have five children (although in 1861 a \"mystery\" daughter born Jun 1860 appears on census, with a corrected name of Eden Ann, but no such child was registered) and can be seen with them in 1861 at Livrean, then 1871-91 in Roche. 1871 at Paradise with 5 children, 1881 at Lower Woon with four, then 1891 at Hallew \"living on own means\" ie retired. Kitty died later that year, buried in Treverbyn 17 Oct, and in 1901 census John was lodging with George Manhire in Roche - one of those lovely links you find occasionally. He died there in 1904 and was buried in Treverbyn with Kitty on 9 Aug 1904.\n\nJessie's great grandmother Lavinia Ann Retallick is the link-ancestor on this branch. She was born Feb 1834 at Rina Park, Lanivet to Francis & Kitty née Besetherick and christened on 16 Mar 1834. In 1841 census she can be seen aged 5 at Savath, Luxulyan with parents & sibs then in 1851 at Chollow, Luxulyan, working as a house servant for her Uncle William Beswetherick, master carpenter, and family. On 7 Jun 1853 at Roche church she married Robert Knight and I told the rest of this story on 4th Feb - please see below. A little more detail has emerged regarding her time in the Asylum; she was first admitted there on 26 Jul 1900, aged 66, but no mention of her condition. On 26 November, 4 months later, she was discharged and stated to be Recovered. However, two years later on 18 Oct 1902 she was re-admitted and died there on 3 Nov 1905. Robert died on 24 Jul 1909 aged 78.\n\nFriday 9th June 2017\n\nWell, I am back! I have spent the last week or so with the next generation in Brooklyn, having a good time and meeting our new granddaughter Amanda. Now I shall pick up where I left off.\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nJames Woodford was christened in 1811, as were\n\nMary Ann Knight in 1806 and\n\nHenry Herbert Smith in 1895\n\nPercy John Wooldridge married Ethel Maria White in 1924\n\nJames Knight married Blanche Robins in 1766\n\nAlice Emily Cox married Philip F T Smith in 1908\n\nAlice Kate Matthews died in 1923\n\nJohn Retallick 3 was born Feb 1767 in St Wenn to Henry & Elizabeth née Brenton and christened there on 2 Mar 1767. On 13 Aug 1797 at St Thomas', Portsmouth, Hampshire (aka Portsmouth Cathedral) he married Sarah Bellitha, who had been born in Ladock, Cornwall 10 years after him. They had two children; Sarah in 1800 and Philip in 1804, both christened in 1804, then Philip died the following year. Sarah & John can be seen in 1841 census at College Court, St Columb Major, John a 75-year-old maltster. He died and was buried there 29 Mar 1842 and Sarah moved back to her home town of Ladock. She can be seen there in census of 1851 with sister (?in-law) Elizabeth and in 1861 aged 84 at Higher Trelassick, Ladock (farm of 80 acres) with nephew John H and family. She died there in May 1866 aged 89.\n\nJohn Retallick 4 was born Jul 1772 in Roche to John & Catherine née Martin and christened there on 22 Aug 1772. On 18 Jan 1806 at the same church he married Elizabeth Bray, who had been born there in 1780 but was living in St Stephen-in-Brannel (I suspect she was illegitimate, as no father is mentioned). They had 4 children but John died 14 Aug 1817 aged 45 and Elizabeth the following year aged 38.\n\nJohn Retallick 5 - see 11th & 30th Sep 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 6 - see 11th Sep 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 7 - see 22nd Sep 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 8 - see 6th Oct 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 9 - see 2nd Oct 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 10 - see 30th Sep 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 11 - see 25th Sep 2012 - nothing new\n\nJohn Retallick 12 was born 13 Jan 1892 in Marrick, Yorkshire to Charles & Mary née Hodgson. He can be seen in 1901 census & 1911 - see Isabella below - with father, grandparents & 2 sisters in Devon, in 1911 working on the farm for grandfather. As I stated in his father's section on 5th May below, in 1939 Register he is listed as \"invalid incapacitated\". If he was the John Percival Retallick in WW1 1915-17 he lived in High Street Totnes, Devon, but I have no proof. If so, he may have been wounded. He died in Dec 1944 aged 53.\n\nJohn Courtney Retallick - see 6th Oct 2012. He can be seen on 1939 Register (see son Agar below on 28th April), at 1 Wesley Terrace, St Austell with wife Mary E and son Agar L, listed as CCL Retired (he was 67)\n\nJohn Robert Smith Retallick - see 3rd Dec 2012. 1939 Register shows him at 3 Beaumont Terrace, Lancaster with Edith & Muriel. He was listed as Stone Mason, as expected, Edith UDD & Muriel at school. There are 2 files still closed, probably relating to Robert & Ronald, as Muriel died in 2008 and I cannot see that they have yet. Also in the household were Charles & Susan Jessop (Edith's parents) and son Frank. Charles was a dentist and Frank a Silk Sizer. John died 10 Jan 1987, while living at The Chestnuts, Bolton-le-Sands, leaving £53,959.\n\nWednesday 24th May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nStephen James Hodd was born in 1890\n\nWilliam May was christened in 1812\n\nHenry Cox died in 1861 and\n\n\"Anthony Knight 1\" was buried in 1772\n\nTuesday 23rd May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nHelena Hennig was born in 1902\n\nMary Woodford was christened in 1803\n\nJames Thomas Gamble married Annie Dorrington in 1915\n\nEllen Knight married William Trethewey in 1881\n\nJohn Haines (who married Cordelia Woodford) died in 1883 and\n\nPhilip Frank Turner Smith (who married Alice Cox) in 1961\n\nJenifer Retallick (aka Jane), Jessie's 3xgreat aunt, was born Dec 1797 in Luxulyan to Christopher & Mary née Soby and christened there on 21 Jan 1798. In the same church on 25 Oct 1818 she married Richard James (groom signed, bride marked, witnesses included Christopher Retallick, her father). They had eleven children - possibly twelve - and 1841 census shows them at Horros, Luxulyan with nine of them. The eldest married in England, but some of the family emigrated in the late 1840s to Canada - I cannot be more specific as the passenger lists don't go back that far. I have seen a record dated 1851 where Richard is listed, but not names of members of his family, at Bosanquet Township, Lambton County, Ontario. In 1861 census they can be seen there, the household consisting of Richard, Jane, Martha & Joseph (the two youngest). By 1871 census Richard was 80, Jane 74, and they were living in the household of Joseph, married with 2 children, along with Martha (listed as \"of unsound mind\"), Joseph working as \"farmer and lumber man\". Richard died in 1878 aged 88 and was buried at Lake Valley Grove Cemetery, Jane joining him 4 years later at the same age.\n\nJennifer Retallick was born Dec 1774 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth and christened there 15 Jan 1775 with her twin sister Frances - see 14th May below. On 14 Aug 1798 in Roche she married Joseph Stick and they had 5 children in 7 years. Then she had a very bad year, her mother, father, husband & sister all died between Apr 1807 & May 1808. 1841 census appears to be missing for her, but in 1851 she can be seen aged 76 widowed, alone, at Tremodret, listed as Annuitant (ie pensioner). She died Jan 1853 in New Town, Roche & was buried in Roche churchyard with Joseph on 20 Feb 1853.\n\nI shall make a start on the Johns, but as there are 12 \"plain\" Johns alone, I'm not sure how far I will get...\n\nJohn Retallick 1, Jessie's 5xgreat uncle, was born May 1719 in St Wenn to Richard & Grace née Brenton, eldest of their nine, and christened there on 1 Jun 1719. On 27 Mar 1743 also at St Wenn he married Elizabeth Docken and they had five children, three in Roche then two in St Wenn in the 1750s. Elizabeth died in Mar 1788 and was buried in Roche churchyard on 30 Mar 1788, followed 11 years later by John on 13 Jun 1799.\n\nHis eldest son John Retallick 2 (known as Junior) was born Nov 1743 in Roche and christened there 27 Dec 1743. As I said, they were living in St Wenn by the 1750s, so when he married on 12 Nov 1769 it was there. His bride was Catherine Martin who was also born in Roche & currently living in St Wenn (groom signed, bride marked, witnesses were his father & uncle Gregory Tabb). They had seven children, but Grace died aged three and Catherine aged seven. Catherine died aged 52 and was buried in Roche on 7 Jun 1796, John lived on at Trenoweth, Roche until he was 82 and was buried with her on 21 Sep 1826.\n\nMonday 22nd May 2017\n\nJames Retallick 1 - see 8th Sep 2012. The only new record for me is his Australian will, where he left £20 to his friend John Henry Jessup and authorised him to sell up his estate and divide it equally amongst James' nine children and himself.\n\nJames Retallick 2 - also see 8th Sep 2012. Nothing new.\n\nJames Retallick 3 was born Jan 1788 in Roche to John & Catherine née Martin and christened there on 13 Feb 1788. Unfortunately I cannot match him up with anything else.\n\nJames Retallick 4 was born May 1813 at Bilberry, Roche to William & Ann née Williams and christened there on 27 Jun 1813. On 23 Jan 1836, also at Roche church he married Mary Ann Stephens & they had two daughters. 1841 census shows him at Polskeys, Roche with one daughter, working as a tinner, then 1851 same with 2 daughters, tinstreamer. I cannot find them in 1861 but there should be three of them as elder daughter Mary Jane was married (both girls married Retallicks). Younger daughter Ann married in 1864 so James & Mary Ann set off for Australia on the SS Florence Irving, arriving 13 Sep 1869 in Sydney, to join his brother William & family. The trip (this ship was ostensibly a cargo vessel) and the life out there weren't easy and Mary Ann died the following year. James can be seen in 1877 Directory at 5 O'Connell Street, Melbourne and died there in 1882, as did his brother William.\n\nJames Retallick 5 was born late 1761 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth and christened there on 13 Feb 1762. On 26 May 1786 at the same church he married Hester Blake and they had six children before she died in 1812 aged 50. James didn't quite make it to the first census, as he died in Apr 1840 aged 79.\n\nJames John Retallick - see 8th Sep 2012. No new records for him, but 1939 Register shows his widow Jane at Eleric House (could be Electric going by Frederick's job), Gestridge Road, Newton Abbot with son Frederick and his wife Vera. Frederick worked as \"District Rep Electricity Supply\" and there was also a closed file, probably their daughter Iris, who was 6 years old. Jane died there in 1954 aged 84.\n\nJane Retallick 1 was born Dec 1757 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth, elder sister of James 5 above, and christened there on 29 Jan 1758. On 18 Oct 1779 also at St Wenn she married Christopher Merrifeld (groom signed, bride marked, witnesses William Merrifield and William Pope). She gave birth ten times, but at least four died in infancy. One of these (7th child) was Betsy Merrifield, who married Joseph Knight Junior, and thus served to link up the branches again. Christopher died in Dec 1824 in Tregonetha, St Wenn and was buried there on 23 Dec that year. I cannot confirm Jane's death, as I have found one whose husband was Joseph and three where the age was decades out.\n\nJane Retallick 2 was born Dec 1865 in Roche to Allivyan and Mary née Liddicoat and christened there on 16 Jan 1865. She can be seen in census of 1871 and 1881 at Rosemelling Moor with parents & sister, with maternal grandparents next door. However, she died on 25 Mar 1886 aged only 20 and was buried 28 Mar 1886:\n\nSunday 21st May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nEdward Dance Cox married Harriet Annie Taylor in 1893\n\nAmelia Roberts née Knight died in 1914 (in Australia)\n\nMary Knight née Hore was buried in 1803\n\nSaturday 20th May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nWalter Woodford was born in 1892\n\nMargaret Edith Matthews in 1907 and\n\nLily Rose Woodford in 1881\n\nGrace Knight née Bennett died in 1883\n\nHugh Retallick was born 10 May 1910 in Roche to Woodman & Emmeline née Collins, and in 1911 census was 10 months old living at Stenalees with parents & sibs. In Apr 1936 he married Muriel Eva Rundle (aka Mo) and they had 2 children. 1939 Register shows them at Hazelmere, Lower Stenalees. Hugh built roads for the Council, Muriel UDD. They also had with them Hugh's father Woodman, his brother Raymond (both of these CCLs) and his sister Emmeline, a Telephone Exchange Operator for the Post Office. There are two closed files - one is presumably baby Marlene but as Terence was not born until 1941 the other cannot be him. Hugh died in Jul 1950 but Mo didn't follow until 2006 - hence the very new gravestone I photographed in 2012. Marlene, incidentally, followed her aunt into the post of Telephonist for the Post Office.\n\nIsabella Retallick was born Jan 1891 in Hurst, Marrick, Yorkshire to Charles & Mary née Hodgson and can be seen on census of 1891 aged 3 months at Hill Top House, Marrick with her parents. Her mother died when she was 7, so in 1901 census aged 10 she can be seen living at Hannaford Estate, Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon with gradparents, father, sibs & a servant. In 1911 the same household at Backland, Ashburton, Devon, listed as Domestic General Assistant. In Apr 1918 in Newton Abbot she married William Henry Rundle Giles, local gardener. However, it seems she was not a well woman and she died aged 42 on 12 Sep 1933 in Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital after a long illness and no children. William remarried the following year and can be seen in 1939 Register with wife Gladys Evelyn née Baldwin at Glentor, Newton Abbot. He died in 1981 in Torbay and she in 2001.\n\nFriday 19th May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nRebecca Sophia May was christened in 1861 as was\n\nJane Knight in 1799\n\nFrances Annie Gamble married Colin Spencer Lyddon Pring in 1903 and\n\nThomas David Roffey married Martha Owen in 1834\n\nHart Retallick - see 28th Aug 2012. Using the search method on the GRO site, I have confirmed all eight births of their children, the first Olive in Teesdale, then the other seven in Newton Abbot, Devon. So evidently Jane had her firstborn at her parents' home although the family were already in Devon the year before for the census. In 1939 Register the family can be seen at 82 Chudleigh Road, Kingsteignton, Newton Abbot, (which is the address at which they both died) Hart listed as Engine Fitter, Jane UDD, Percival Petrol Salesman, Roy (Cedric) \"Balar Salesman\" (I don't know what this was/is and Google can only suggest a kind of Indian jewellery) and Eunice Incapacitated. I have found Olive, living in Newton Abbot with her future in-laws and I have found Jane's funeral in the local paper 6 years later. Hart died there on 5 Feb 1956.\n\nHenry Retallick 1 was born Feb 1728 in St Wenn to Richard & Grace née Brenton and christened there 17 Mar 1728 along with brother Alvon. On 3 Nov 1753 at the same church he married his first cousin Elizabeth Brenton and they had seven children. Elizabeth died Apr 1803 aged 72, then Henry Mar 1810 aged 82. Both were buried in St Wenn above.\n\nHis son Henry Retallick 2 was born at St Wenn in Sep 1756 and christened there 24 Oct 1756. The only other record I can be confident is his is the burial record dated 30 Mar 1824, which stated he was 68 years old and lived in Roche.\n\nHenry Retallick 3 was born towards the end of 1795 in Lanivet to Christopher & Mary née Soby and christened there on 3 Jan 1796. On 16 Oct 1815 in Luxulyan he married Mary Thomas, who had been born there. They had 8 children, all in Luxulyan, but by the 1841 census had settled at Levrean Moor, St Austell, Henry working as an iron miner. In 1851 he was listed as Farm Labourer still at Livrean with 2 daughters at home and son Luke & his family 2 doors away. In 1861 daughter Harriet only was at home as she had a son Joseph - see Wednesday below. Same in 1871 but when Mary died in the summer of 1873, Henry was not capable of looking after her, so Harriett was committed and Henry died the following summer.\n\nHester Retallick was his daughter, born Jun 1818 at Higher Mendew, Luxulyan and christened on 26 Jul 1818, second of their eight. There is an Esther Retallick of about the right age who married Thomas Rundell on 25 Feb 1837, but no fathers' names given, so I have no idea if this is her. She would be only 18, so he would have to be there... I have seen another Esther Retallick who emigrated to America and married a William May, but seems to have the wrong parents, so I shall leave this here.\n\nThursday 18th May 2017\n\nHarry Retallick was born 4 Feb 1903 in Millom, Cumberland to \"Christopher 5\" & Mary née Lutey and grew up in the Fish & Chip shop. He can be seen there in 1911 census with parents, sister & 2 servants. In Jul 1927, when his father died and left him a portion of £2470 he was an ironmonger and his premises was listed in 1936 as 14 Station Road, Portslade-on-sea, Sussex [now a chicken takeaway] and remained until at least 1954. In Jul 1930 in Bootle, Lancs he married Mary Amelia Leila Olds (known as Leila as her mother was Mary Amelia too) and they had 5 children. They originally lived in Penzance, Cornwall but soon moved to Sussex, where 1939 Register showed Harry & Leila with Eileen, 21 months old, but I don't know where Ian & Michael were, as they would have been 7 and 2 respectively. They had both been born in Penzance, and appeared to stay in the area, marrying local girls and raising families of their own, and the same applied to Geoffrey and Evelyn who followed. They retired in 1968, when Harry reached 65, to a bungalow at 43 Downsway, Southwick, where Leila died 17 Dec 1975 aged 68 and Harry followed on 7 Dec 1986 aged 83. He left £108, 909, presumably including the bungalow.\n\nWednesday 17th May 2017\n\nGuy Wallace Retallick was born Jun 1878 in St Austell to Luke & Ellen née Vercoe, second of their ten. He can be seen aged 3 in 1881 census at Livrean, St Austell with parents & brothers and the same in 1891 a 13-year-old Ag Lab. In 1901 they had moved to Bugle where he was an Overlooker at a Clay Mine. In Oct 1909 in St Austell he married local girl Louie May Tonkin, and had a daughter Constance, who can be seen with them at Bugle in 1911 census, then another called Eleanor in 1912. Guy was taken ill in 1916 and admitted to East Cornwall Hospital, Bodmin, where he had an operation but died 23 Jun 1916 aged only 38. His obituary fills in a lot of other detail.\n\nAnother mention of music, and he too was called Captain. It must again be a church rank. Guy was buried in Treverbyn and he left £173 to Louie. In Jan 1924 she married William Johns in St Austell\n\nHannah Retallick was born Jul 1827 at Levrean, St Austell to Henry & Mary née Thomas and christened in Luxulyan 26 Aug 1827. She can be seen in 1841 census at Hendra, Roche, working as a servant. On 24 Oct 1846 in St Austell she married stone-labourer Benjamin Julian and they had 8 children, although Betsy died aged just a few months in 1856. 1851 census showed Hannah at Levrean, St Austell, with 3 children, next door to her parents and 1861 at 4 Canna, Luxulyan with 6 children. Benjamin died aged 41 in Oct 1866, when youngest child Joseph was only a year old, so in 1871 census she can be seen (as Anna) a widow, back at Levrean, next to her parents, with 5 children. I cannot be sure about 1881-1901 as she seemed to favour Anna, and there are lots of those. A death in 1910 seems possible, in the St Austell area.\n\nHarriett Retallick was born Jul 1831 in Luxulyan to Henry & Mary née Thomas and christened there 10 Aug 1831. In censuses of 1841-1871 she can be seen at Livrean Moor, where her father Henry rented house & land, and she worked as a CCL with him and her brothers. In Apr 1854 she gave birth to an illegitimate son and in calling him Joseph Nicholls Retallick stated that she believed someone called Nicholls to be the father. I can't say who he is, she certainly didn't go on to marry him. She registered Josph in the St Austell area and her mother looked after him while she continued working at the Clay Works. She can still be seen there in 1871 census, but on 20 Oct 1873 she was admitted to Bodmin Lunatic Asylum as a \"pauper lunatic\" and was there for nearly 20 years before she died there on 20 Aug 1893 and buried there on 23 Aug. Meanwhile, Joseph got work as a Navvy, digging tunnels in Wales, where he met Henrietta Davies from the Channel Isles and married her in 1878 in Merthyr Tydfil.\n\nTuesday 16th May 2017\n\nFrederick Guy Retallick - see 21st Aug 2012. 1939 Register shows him and wife Annie living at Innisvath. Frederick was a Road Stone Quarrier (Heavy Work) and Annie UDD. Also in the household were daughter Myrtle UDD and a young man who became her husband, Nugent Bloomfield, Dairy Farmer, who I mentioned in 2012.\n\nFrederick Maunder Retallick - also see 21st Aug 2012. 1939 Register shows him at Fairview Terrace, Bugle with wife Ann and 3 school children, one his son Frank, one a Richard Green and one who I cannot place,as the file is still closed, but it looks like a female who married in 1943 (little red additions but no detail visible). I have searched, but cannot find a daughter.\n\nGordon Edmund Luke Retallick was born 5 Jun 1921 in the St Austell area to Elison & Louisa née Sweet. He was in 1939 living with his parents & maternal grandparents at Fairview House (see 12th May below), an apprentice carpenter, probably to his grandfather Edmund Sweet. In Oct 1941 he married Irene M Sandercock and they had two children. Phone book records show him at 3 Higher Bugle 1975-1984 and probably until his death 19 Sep 1995 (although his death was registered in the Truro area). He was buried in Treverbyn and I saw him in 2012:. If I am correct, Irene joined him the following year and the inscription may have been added to since (my doubt is that she was down as Gwendoline Irene Muriel)\n\nGordon Reginald Retallick - see 21st Aug 2012. 1939 Register was taken when they had been married 7 years and Pamela was 3 years old. They can be seen at 18a Lower Bore Street, Bodmin and he was working as a Male Mental Nurse, possibly in the prison. According to the 1950 Nursing Register, he qualiified in 1931 and now lived at 9 Vivian Road, Westheath, Bodmin. this is just arounnd the corner from Bodmin Hospital Treatment Centre, where he no doubt worked, as this has a strong mental health link, or did until recently, as it is about to close, due to a \"requires improvement\" decision during last year's inspection. He died in Jan 1980 and was buried in Bodmin, joined in 1990 by Dorothy.\n\nI don't know if you remember, but Grace was a favourite name in 18th Century Retallicks, but not many records are around to support it. Still, I'll report to you what I can:\n\nGrace Retallick 1 was born May 1733 in St Wenn to Richard & Grace née Brenton, christened 4 Jun 1733 but unfortunately died and was buried on 20 Jun 1733, less than 3 weeks later.\n\nGrace Retallick 2 was born May 1746 in Roche to John & Elizabeth née Docken and christened there on 8 Jun 1746. I cannot link her up with anything else.\n\nGrace Retallick 3 was born Jan 1757 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth and christened 24 Nov 1759 aged 2. Unfortunately she died aged 10 and was buried at St Wenn on 29 Jul 1767.\n\nGrace Retallick 4 was born 24 Jan 1759 in St Wenn to Henry & Elizabeth née Brenton and christened there 3 Nov 1759. On 1 Jan 1779 at St Merryn she married John Bennett, who had been born there. She died 10 years later, but by then had managed to produce 4 sons (although one died aged 6 the year after she did). John died Jan 1838 in St Ervan.\n\nGrace Retallick 5 was born Jan 1784 in Roche to John & Catherine née Martin and christened there 2 Feb 1784. Unfortunately she died aged 3 and was buried there on 1 Jan 1788.\n\nGrace Retallick 6 (Jessie's 3x great-aunt) was born Aug 1792 in Roche to Christopher & Mary née Soby and christened there 22 Sep 1792. On 25 Sep 1811 at Menheniot she married John Short and they had 5 children (they helped me by naming the third Christopher Retallick Short). In 1841 they can be seen in Liskeard - John has an \"N\" by whether he is from Cornwall, but we know from his marriage cert that he is illiterate, so would not have noticed. In 1851 Grace was missing, but she may have been in hospital etc as she died the following year, buried on 15 Dec 1852 in Liskeard. John had gone the January of that year, so by daughter Sarah's wedding in 1859 both parents had passed on and she had moved to Yorkshire.\n\nFinally, Grace Retallick 7 was born Aug 1815 in Roche to Richard & Elizabeth née Lamb and christened there 4 Sep 1815. In 1841 census she can be seen at Broad Street, Penryn, working as a servant to a physician. On 14 Mar 1846 in Roche she married William Hancock, tin miner and they had 5 children. In 1851 census they can be seen at Broad Lane, Roche with 3 of these, her father (pauper farm labourer) and brother William (also tin miner). By 1861 Grace had been widowed and was working at the China Clay Works herself, and the two oldest boys were tin miners aged 14 & 11. In 1871 she called herself \"domestic\" and 4 children were still at home. In 1881 she was 65 years old, a \"sewing woman\" as she was no doubt by then not strong enough for the manual labour she had been doing. Daughter Elizabeth was still with her and granddaughter Nellie. Grace died aged 72 and was buried in Roche on 23 Oct 1887. Elizabeth moved in with brother William in Carbis and became his housekeeper (also with Nellie).\n\nMonday 15th May 2017\n\nFrancis Retallick was born Feb 1762 in St Wenn to Henry & Elizabeth née Brenton and christened there 27 Mar 1762. On 4 Apr 1783 at St Newlyn-in-Pydar he married Ann Cock (where bride came from) and they had 3 children in St Enoder (where he was living). I cannot track down deaths for them.\n\nJessie's great great grandfather Francis Retallick was born Mar 1801 at Savath, Luxulyan to Christopher & Mary née Soby and christened there 25 Apr 1801. He lived at Savath all his life but it was at Lanivet that on 29 Apr 1833 he married Catherine \"Kitty\" Beswetherick (bride signed, groom marked, witnesses included William Beswetherick, her brother). She had given birth 5 years earlier to a daughter Asenath. I don't know if Francis was her father but he evidently adopted her, as 1841 census showed all the family as Retallick, including Asenath (although her age was rounded down to 10, but they did that in 1841). Unfortunately, I cannot find any further records for her. Francis' brother John was next door in 1841 and both Kitty & Francis' ages were rounded down to 30. By 1851 this was corrected and they can be seen at Savath with two sons & her mother, also Catherine. They had 9 children in all (including Asenath), but 5 died as infants or young children. 1861 census shows 2 sons at home and granddaughter Zerua Knight (Jessie's first cousin). Francis died 21 Mar 1865 at Savath aged 63, leaving £100 to Kitty and was buried 24 Mar 1865 at Luxulyan. Kitty remained at Savath and can be seen there in 1871 census, but son Adam was Head of Household. She died there Jul 1880 aged 78. I have found an intriguing snippet on the Ancestry site, from the Bodmin Gaol records. It states that a Catherine Retallick born 1804, occupation Housekeeper, was admitted to the gaol in Mar 1869 (ie 4 years after Francis died) and kept there for a month. The only details it gives are: \"W+4 lost all front teeth but 1. Crippled l hand\". This could be \"widow for 4 years\", but I don't know why she would be sent to gaol for being injured! I can't locate any newspaper reference or any other info at all. Most frustrating!\n\nFrancis Arthur Retallick was born 25 Aug 1900 in Lanivet to Woodman & Emmeline née Collins and can be seen on census of 1901 in Lanivet Village aged 7 months with his parents & in 1911 aged 10 at Stenalees with parents & sibs. In Jul 1927 at St Andrew's, Stratton, near Bude (her home town) he married Ethel Routley Jones, midwife and they had a daughter Dorothy there 5 months later. They soon relocated to Stenalees, St Austell, and can be seen there in records for the next 50 years (1929 & 1930 at 2 Moorland Terrace, 1931 at Chapel Terrace). Ethel soon went back to work, practising as a midwife/district nurse 1931-1955, including 1939, when the Register listed her as such at Morwenna, Stenalees with Francis, \"District Secretary of Approved Society (*) and Timekeeper Clerk for Cornwall City Council\", Dorothy at school and a single lady Phyllis Stephens as domestic (she became Jones in later years so may have married into Ethel's family). Ethel died aged 58 in Jan 1960 and Francis on 18 Nov 1977 at Morwenna aged 77, leaving £10,055, presumably to Dorothy, who was still single.\n\n(*) Approved Societies were pre-NHS health insurance schemes, similar to Friendly Societies.\n\nSunday 14th May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nElizabeth Wooldridge was christened in 1848\n\nWilliam Woodford 6 died in 1911 and\n\nReginald Arthur Retallick in 1957\n\nMary Woodford née Harris was buried in 1862\n\nErnest Retallick - see 20th Aug 2012. Searching for his return to UK has not come up with anything, nor 1940 census in USA. I have located a marriage in St Austell in 1935 to a Phyllis Kent and a death in 1974 also in St Austell aged 67, but cannot be sure it is him.\n\nEulalia Ellen Retallick - see 20th Aug 2012 - nothing new\n\nEwart Balthazar Walter Retallick - see 20th Aug 2012. In 2012 I mentioned the return trip from Chile in 1923, but have now seen the trip out from Liverpool to Antofagasta, Chile, departing on 22 Dec 1921. He was again listed as accountant, and gave his home address as 79 Reginald Terrace, Leeds. He had his own business at 30 Cheapside, Preston (1921 Directory) [now Nando's] 1939 Register shows him as one of four \"households\" at 233 Hyde Park Road, Leeds, working as a Local Government Officer, still single\n\nFrances (Fanny) Retallick was born Dec 1774 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth and christened there on 15 Jan 1775. On 15 Aug 1807 at St Wenn she married farmer Andrew Pearse from Roche and they went on to have 5 children. They can be seen in census of 1841 at Woon, with 3 sons & a servant. Frances died aged 71 and was buried 26 Dec 1845 in Roche. The only death I can find for Andrew is 1856 but the age is wrong and there is no 1851 census for him.\n\nSaturday 13th May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nMy mother Kathleen Matthews née Gamble was born in 1932 and also engaged in 1950. Happy 85th birthday Mum, and many more!\n\nAugust Rudolph Hennig was born in 1850 and\n\nHenry Albert Catchesides in 1854\n\nJob Woodford was christened 1838\n\nRobert Knight married Betsy Udy in 1799\n\nEmily Ann Retallick - see 20th Aug 2012. Trying to track down the children who died, using the new (to me) search facility on the GRO site led me to nothing. Emily stated she had lost 3 children before 1911, and others researching this tree suggested 3 boys Horace, John & Robert. But they were all registered in Stratton, near Bude, all with different mother's maiden names. This leads me to conclude the children she referred to were miscarriages/stillbirths, unregistered because they didn't breathe. Sad, but no help to me. Reginald was registered in St Austell Jul 1904, married a girl from Truro & settled there. There was a daughter Thora born in 1913, she married a clayworks carpenter William Endean and they can be seen in St Austell in 1939 Register. Emily Ann evidently used her experience with childbirth, as in the Register she is described as a widowed Midwife, living at Chytane Farm, St Austell. She died Jul 1973 aged 90.\n\nFriday 12th May 2017\n\nEden Retallick - see 7th Aug 2012 and her death announcement can now be added:\n\nEdgar Retallick b1842 - see 7th Aug 2012\n\nEdgar Retallick b1893 - see 7th Aug 2012. He lived in Ulverston all his life, so it is with no surprise that we meet him in 1939 Register at 3 Ainslie Street, Ulverston with wife Mystic and another couple, working for the Local Authority as a Market Inspector. Both Edgar and Mystic died here, Mystic on 15 Jul 1976, leaving £12,488.\n\nEdmund Thomas Retallick - see 13th Aug 2012 The only \"new\" document was sight of the real marriage record. (I think it's a shame mother's name is never included, as Eliza's mother was called Noah Boswarthick)\n\nEleanor Ruth Retallick was born at Bugle on 29 Jul 1912 to Guy & Louie May née Tonkyn, sister of Constance. In Jul 1932 she married Alfred Martyn and they had one daughter, also Eleanor. In 1939 Register they were at Ashes Park, Stenalees, St Austell, Alfred working as a Fitter/Labourer (but I cannot read for whom), Eleanor Senior UDD and a closed file, presumably Eleanor Junior. Alfred died in 1974 aged 68 and Eleanor on 13 Sep 1984, living at 1 Kerrow Moor, Bugle, leaving £40k\n\nElfrida Retallick - see 14th Aug 2012 - nothing new\n\nElison Gordon Retallick - see 13th Aug 2012. 1939 Register found him at Fairview House, Bugle, working as Merchandise Manager & Clerk of China Clay Works. Louisa was UDD and also in the house were her parents and 18-year-old son Gordon, an apprenticed Carpenter, maybe to his grandfather, who was a carpenter and two closed files, no doubt Phyllis and Elison Junior.\n\nElizabeth Retallick 1 was born May 1721 in St Wenn to Richard & Grace née Benton and christened there 26 Jun 1721. On 13 Jul 1746 also in this church she married Gregory Tabb and they had 5 children, although the last Honour died in infancy. Gregory died in 1773 aged 53 and Elizabeth died in 1801 and was buried on 13 Jan 1801 in St Wenn aged almost 80.\n\nElizabeth Retallick 2 was born Aug 1749 in Roche to John & Elizabeth née Docken and christened 25 Sep 1749 also at Roche. On 15 Apr 1768 at St Wenn she married John Merryfield. They had two \"attempts\" at a daughter Elizabeth, both late in their marriage so either they struggled or the records are lacking. Elizabeth died 35 in 1785 and was buried in Roche (I thought I had a photo of her grave, but cannot find one) 26 May 1785, then John joined her 21 years later.\n\nElizabeth Retallick 3 - her story was an odd one in that her parents were both Retallicks and she married one. This makes things a little more confusing... She was born Jan 1765 in St Wenn to William & Elizabeth and christened there 10 March 1765. On 16 Feb 1791 in Roche she married Richard Retallick. He was 7 years younger than she was - in fact they were married by licence because the groom was 19 and thus under age, but their son John arrived later that year so may be the reason. Witnesses were two John Retallicks, possibly her uncle and cousin. Elizabeth & Richard had 4 children, I believe. There are various records involving a Richard Retallick, but as it is evidently a common name locally, I cannot prove any is him. There are various leasing arrangements for properties in the area and he is listed as Gamekeeper for the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, deputed by him in 1797, in which he is stated as living at \"Tremoddrett\". By the first census in 1841 he was 69, although the enumerator rounded down to 60, as they did for that census, living at Broad Lane, Roche, listed as Ag Lab, with son William. Elizabeth died in Jan 1851 aged 86 and Richard and William can be seen living there with Grace and family (her baptism in 1815 also gives Tremoderat as home). Richard died the year after his wife and was buried with her in Roche cemetery.\n\nElizabeth Retallick 4 was born May 1770 in Roche to John & Catherine née Martin and christened there 8 May 1770. On 4 Oct 1790 also in Roche she married chair-maker Richard Hawke, her father John one of the witnesses. They had three sons and Richard died Feb 1846 aged 80 and she followed in 1852.\n\nElizabeth Retallick 5 was the lady I discussed on 18th Aug 2012 who went to Australia with her family and married Yorkshireman Smith William Giles. They had 6 children and now I have a photo of their gravestone.\n\nElizabeth Ann Retallick - see 20th Aug 2012. I did think she had stayed behind when the family emigrated, but I see from the passenger list that they were all there. I did wonder why I couldn't find her. The record is clear, but the surname spelled Retallack, which doesn't help in searches! It seems she returned to England in the early 1860s, and settled down with Woodman Pascoe, who was living with his family at Woon in 1861. Elizabeth & Woodman had 10 children, although they didn't help me by baptising them en masse at various ages. Woodman Junior was ostensibly born 16 Dec 1864 but he was not registered then - or as far as I can see in any other quarter! After this they were registered but she appeared to think her maiden-name was Stanlick rather than Retallick! This is understandable in a way as she was illiterate (made mark on marriage record) and her family was on the other side of the world! This makes the mind boggle nowadays, but as long as you could scratch a cross it sufficed for many centuries!\n\nThere was another Elizabeth Ann Retallick, who we have met already - Catherine's sister, who married Edwin Knight and thus double-linked the families (actually, Woodman Pascoe Junior above also did this, but then there were thousands of Knights in Cornwall!) She was christened on 24 Nov 1842 in Bodmin and can be seen in census of 1851 aged 9 at Broad Lane, Roche with parents, sister & 3 lodgers. In 1851 she was 18 and can be seen at 87 Union Street, Plymouth, Devon, house servant to a Linen & Wool Draper (her sister Catherine was dressmaker there too). On 25 Jan 1866 in Roche she married Edwin Knight, tin mine agent. Over then next few decades they can be seen at various addresses in Roche with their 2 children until 1911, when Catherine, now widowed, can be seen visiting. Edwin died a few weeks later and was no doubt buried in Roche, Elizabeth joining him there 14 years later.\n\nTuesday 9th May 2017\n\nConstance Beryl Retallick was born Sep 1910 in Bugle to Guy & Louie May née Tonkin and can be seen in 1911 census with them there, aged 7 months. 1939 Register shows her living in Fore Street, Bugle with her mother, who was now remarried and Constance was a Shop Assistant. In Apr 1940 she married Leslie Rosevear, local bus conductor, but died 3 years later, with no children. In Jan 1945 Leslie remarried.\n\nCyrus Retallick was born 14 Nov 1871 in Luxulyan to Adam & Ann and can be seen at Innisvath, Luxulyan in censuses of 1881-1911 with parents & sibs, in the latter two listed as China Clay Labourer (CCL). In 1939 Register he was lodging at 2 Moorland Terrace, Bugle, very close to Constance above (on the same page!), and he died on 2 Jul 1946 aged 74 at The Bungalow, Stenalees, leaving £560 to Alfred Bunt, Secretary.\n\nHis brother Daniel Retallick was born 21 Jan 1887 at Innisvath and can be seen there in 1891 census aged 3, 1901 aged 13 (Ag Lab) & 1911 aged 23 (CCL) He never married, but died Jul 1933 aged 45. I have documents relating to him dated 22 May 1893, on his admission to Lockingate Infant School and in WW1 he attained medals as a Private in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.\n\nThere was a previous incarnation, born Daniel Edgar Retallick in Oct 1866 but he must have died in the mid-1880s and \"plain\" Daniel was born 1888. Daniel Edgar was in census of 1871 & 1881 at Savath with the family but disappears about the time his namesake appears. However, I cannot find a death anywhere.\n\nDavid Retallick - see 6th Aug 2012. I have since seen his baptism record of 24 Sep 1871 at Luxulyan and his death notice in 1914 and memorial in 1915. His death was evidently due to an accident in the Duchess mine, but more detail I couldn't track down. He was only 44.\n\nThe other David Retallick - also see 6th Aug 2012 - died aged 7 and was buried at Luxulyan.\n\nDonald Retallick - see 7th Aug 2012. 1939 Register was taken when they were living at Higher Stenalees with 2 sons, having been married for 9 years. When Donald died it was 23 Apr 1974 at 39 Trenovissick, St Blazey Gate, he was 64 and he left effects worth £1599.\n\nMonday 8th May 2017\n\nCharlotte Retallick 2 was born 14 Oct 1846 in Roche (probably Tremodrett) and can be seen there in census of 1851 aged 4 with parents & sibs. In 1855 she set off with the family aboard SS Hooghly for Adelaide, Australia. They evidently settled in well, as her siblings John & Mary Anne married in 1861, then on 18 Mar 1865 at Avoca, Victoria, NSW she married Isaac Morvell, brother of James, who had married her sister Mary Anne 4 years earlier. Charlotte had a joint wedding with her sister Elizabeth, who married Smith William Giles. Charlotte & Isaac had 10 children but 4 died in infancy. On 8 Apr 1901 Isaac died aged 63 in Lexton, Victoria and in electoral roll records of 1903, 1914, 1919 & 1924 Charlotte can be seen at Lexton with various children & in-laws, until she joined him in 1927:\n\nFor all five Christopher Retallicks see 4th Aug 2012. I'm afraid I still cannot find Christopher 2's mother's name, not for want of trying! I mentioned that \"Christopher 3\" ran The Bugle pub, then a drapery/grocery shop & Flour Dealership with his children, who died young so he had to leave his effects to his business partner. I have now seen the sales particulars posted in 1866, when son \"Christopher 4\" died, as his father retired, and indeed died aged 71 eight years later:.\n\nReading around this, it appears that the previous year, Christopher Senior had been sued by a wholesaler for an outstanding £97 and brought to bancruptcy due to debts run up by Christopher Junior, to whom he had transferred the business in 1862, but he was evidently not up to running it (in fact was called to appear in court but was too ill to do so). To be fair, he died on 5 Mar 1866 of Tuberculosis, aged only 29. He had sold everything he could but this outstanding bill pushed it all over the brink. In the account of the bancruptcy hearing Christopher Senior was described as \"Cattle Doctor... Grocer, Tea, Corn & Flour Dealer\". One detail on him was that he was buried at Treverbyn 9 Jun 1874, although I didn't see a stone for him. Ann & son Thomas I did find and wrote about on 28th Oct 2012. The fifth Christopher Retallick, unrelated to the dynasty above, I also dealt with in 2012 - the one with the fish & chip shop in Millom. There are no more details here though.\n\nClara Retallick was born Apr 1869 in Luxulyan to Adam & Ann and can be seen aged 1 in 1871 census at Savath with parents, brothers & grandmother, then in 1881 at Innisvath with parents & sibs. 1891 finds her at The Western Hotel, Cockington, Devon, working as a housemaid, one of a staff of 28. Unfortunately I lose her at this point, as I can find no marriage nor death, nor track her down in 1901 census.\n\nClaudia Ann Retallick was born Oct 1885 in Livrean nr St Austell to Luke & Ellen née Vercoe. She can be seen there in census of 1891 aged 5 with parents & sibs, then in 1901 aged 15 and 1911 aged 25 at Fairview, Bugle. Shortly after this she married Stephen Hancock and they had 4 children, although I suspect two died. If Claudia Ann was known in later years as Ann Claudia I may well have a death record for her in the St Austell area Jan 1959. Howeveer, my doubts remain as I cannot find her under either in 1939 Register.\n\nFriday 5th May 2017\n\nWhat happened on this day:\n\nVictoria Regina Retallick was christened in 1859 and\n\nRobert Matthews in 1810\n\nElizabeth Treverton Knight married Walter Williams in 1777\n\nSabina Knight née Chapman died in 1854 and\n\nJames Hugh Gamble was buried in 1890\n\nFor the two Catherine Retallicks b1777 see 1st Aug 2012. The one b1840 the same, except her death date. I have since discovered she did (as I suggested) return to Cornwall in her later years, and can be seen in 1911 census staying with her sister Elizabeth (who married Edwin Knight), then retiring to Plymouth, where she died 14 Dec 1922 aged 82, leaving £28 to daughter Emily, now Mewton. Another interesting detail was on her marriage certificate, one of the witnesses was Edwin Knight, her brother-in-law. The final Catherine b1812 died in Bodmin Asylum, a lunatic, again intriguing but I can find no detail.\n\nCharles Retallick 1 - see 3rd Aug 2012 - new record was 1939 Register, showing him widowed, living at 11 Sandygate, Newton Abbot, Devon, retired, with his two youngest children. Son John (who was last seen in 1911 assisting on his grandfather's farm) listed as \"invalid, incapacitated\" - but I cannot find details of his accident/condition - and daughter Mary UDD. Son John died 5 years later, aged 53.\n\nCharles Retallick 2 was the one who mined in USA after his wife died. I now have access to his baptism record (at the age of 4 with brother David) in Luxulyan on 24 Sep 1871 and his death. I now see that he didn't go to Arizona but died in Butte Silver Bow aged 61 (I was worried that his age was a little wrong in 1930 census anyway).\n\nCharles Rowse Retallick was born Aug 1828 at Bawdens, Roche to John & Jenefer née Rowse and christened there 21 Sep 1828. He can be seen in census of 1841 at Chill Brook, Roche, a 10-year-old working as servant in the household of William Trethewey (very close to home, which was on the same census page). In 1851 he was 20, living back at Bawdens, listed as Farmer's Son, with parents & sibs. On 17 Nov 1853 in Roche he married Mary Ann Lobb. [Using the new search method on GRO site to find births with a given mother's maiden-name doesn't work in this case, as at least 3 Retallicks married girls called Lobb and all the births are in the St Austell area, so only serves to confuse]. They can be seen in 1861 census at Fancy, Roche, Charles working as an iron-miner and they had 4 children. 5 months later, still at Fancy, Charles died aged 33 and was buried in Roche churchyard on 9 Oct 1861. I can't track down Mary Ann after that, maybe she remarried in another town or died (although I would expect to find a death record). John & Jane went to live with her parents, Kitty died, Ellen married.\n\nHis sister Charlotte Retallick 1 was born Feb 1826 in Roche and christened 5 Mar 1826. In 1841 she was at home with parents & other sibs at Tremoderett, Roche and on 10 Apr 1850 she married Reuben Searle, a tin miner, and they had 8 children in Roche. In Oct 1866 they registered a boy with no name who became Herbert, but when he was only 2 years old Reuben died aged 44 and Charlotte moved to Nanstallon, Lanivet, where she can be seen in 1871 census with 6 children. Poor Charlotte lost her husband and her father in a few weeks, and it isn't a surprise to find in the next census in 1881 her mother and she are living together in Nanstallon, Charlotte describing herself as \"Miner's Wife & Housekeeper\" and her mother as \"Outdoor Pauper\", with 5 children (aged 15-26 all working). Her mother Jenifer died in 1883 and in 1891 Charlotte can be seen still at Nanstallon with quarryman son Joseph at home, but next door to son Hart & his family. There was in her household also an 8-year-old granddaughter Ida Lily Nicholls, born in Plymouth, illegitimate daughter of Lily, who had been working in that town as a servant at that time. By 1901 Ida was 18 and a nurse - useful as her grandmother was now 75 and died in 1907 aged 81. Ida never married - nursing tended to preclude this - and has a grave in Canada, where she died in 1954 aged 71. When Charlotte died on 20 Sep 1907 she was buried in Nanstallon Cemetery (which is why I didn't see her in 2012 when I visited Lanivet and photographed several family members in the churchyard there)\n\nTuesday 2nd May 2017\n\nAugusta Courtney Retallick intrigues me. I have mentioned her before, she is the lady who I suspect worked at the Bodmin Asylum. I have searched, but suspect that any staff records would be among those held at the National Archives and they charge to look. In 2012, on seeing her gravestone, I said: Augusta Courtney Retallick is a name I mentioned, but not her story, as I didn't think it was interesting, as she was a Dairy Maid in Luxulyan at 14 and died at 24. However, the inscription on her headstone above says: \"Erected by the nurses and attendants of the Cornwall County Asylum in token of respect to the memory of Augusta Courtney Retallick who died March 23rd 1891 aged 24\". Intriguing - this suggests to me that she worked there, rather than as an inmate. I am not aware of the records being available, although there is a website where you can see the crumbling remains before it was demolished. The website shows a handsome building, but even these remains are now gone. With regard to Augusta, unless one day I pay to view staff records, I will never know more.\n\nAugusta Ruth Retallick was born 18 Sep 1899 in"
