WTF?\n\nMcFarlene wins by far. He created a sitcom all by himself. He's still the major driving force of Family Guy. Even though I've lost interest in the show, it's still bad ass.

Granted, he had help, but he was the driving force behind Family Guy, American Dad and Cleveland Show, and two of those were actually good.\n\nEven though I think Robot Chicken is the best thing on TV, I think MacFarlane has brought more entertainment overall. Honestly don't think I would care to meet any of them.\n\nHe created three sitcoms by himself.

Robot Chicken is actually good and he voiced Joker in ME."
