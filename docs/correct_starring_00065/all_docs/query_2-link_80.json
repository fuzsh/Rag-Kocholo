        "text": "Korean entertainment conglomerate CJ ENM appointed Moving producer Jang Kyung-Ik as CEO of Studio Dragon.\n\nJang was formerly the President of Dragon’s domestic rival Studio & NEW, which is part of Next Entertainment World (NEW). He has also served as the Head of the Film Business Division at NEW.\n\nCJ ENM’s said Jang was “a distinguished content producer with a stellar career,” with “exceptional planning skills and keen insight have led to the production of highly successful dramas and films.”\n\nJang is behind hit dramas like Disney+’s Moving, as well as Descendants of the Sun and Doctor Cha. Last year, Moving earned critical acclaim and swept major awards, including the Grand Prize in TV at the Baeksang Arts Awards, Best Series at the Grand Bell Awards, and multiple accolades at the Asia Contents Awards & Global OTT Awards. He also produced the 2018 film The Great Battle, which received 5.44 million box office admissions.\n\nIn June last year, Studio Dragon co-CEO Kim Young-kyu resigned for personal reasons, with local media reports suggesting he had chosen to take “moral responsibility” in an embezzlement case involving a staff member who has since left. That left Kim Jey-hyun as the sole CEO. He is still listed in the role on the company’s website, with a term running until May 2025.\n\nStudio Dragon currently produces about 25 series a year, including Sweet Home, which was the first Asian series to rank in the Netflix global top 10 chart, and Gyeongseong Creature.\n\nA CJ ENM representative said: “With the appointment of Jang, CJ ENM aims to strengthen Studio Dragon’s position as a leading content studio in the global market.”"
