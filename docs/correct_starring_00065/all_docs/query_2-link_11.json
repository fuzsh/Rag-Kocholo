        "text": "If you've gone to the movies or watched television in the last 25 years, you already know Seth Green's work. Green was named the \"Best TV Actor\" by Entertainment Weekly magazine and E! Entertainment Television's poll proclaimed him the hottest young actor in Hollywood. He and Matthew Senreich are co-executive producing, writing, directing and Green does multiple voices each week for the Emmy-nominated show, \"Robot Chicken,\" their series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Green won the 2008 Annie Award in Directing for the \"Robot Chicken: Star Wars\" special. Green and Senreich are currently producing a stop-motion animated holiday family feature, \"Naughty or Nice,\" with Green directing voiceovers and providing the voice of one of the main characters and producing a live action comedy feature, both films are for Dimension, the Weinstein's company.\n\nIn his \"free\" time, Green co-starred with Robin Williams and John Travolta in Disney's feature, \"Old Dogs.\" He's also working on \"Family Guy,\" the popular Fox animated series. Seth was the lead in Paramount's sleeper hit comedy, \"Without A Paddle\" and the indie film, \"Party Monster.\" He won rave reviews for these and for his starring turns in \"Knockaround Guys,\" \"Can't Hardly Wait,\" and his roles in \"The Italian Job,\" \"America's Sweethearts,\" \"Rat Race,\" all three \"Austin Powers\" films and his numerous television roles. He mocked his reputation as a great guy on a pair of popular \"Entourage\" guest spots last year. Aside from Green's other accolades, he's reached the pinnacle of showbiz success in a more tangible format â¦ multiple action figures have been made in his likeness by the industry's top toymakers.\n\nSeth Green has worked almost non-stop since he began in the business at age seven. Green was born on February 8, 1974 to an artist and a math teacher in West Philadelphia where he grew up with his older sister. He signed with a manager who had him working the next day on an RCA/John Denver promotion. Soon he was commuting regularly between Philly and locations across the country.\n\nAt eight, Green landed his first film assignment; a co-starring role in \"Hotel New Hampshire\" with Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe. At twelve, Green auditioned for Woody Allen and was given a date to report to work. Because of Allen's legendary penchant for secrecy on the set Seth had no idea he would be filming for eighteen weeks in New York and wind up with the leading role in \"Radio Days.\" \"He's a brilliant director, he lets you contribute but he still knows how to get exactly what he wants out of you,\" recalls Green.\n\nGreen was a cocky kid; it's a bit overwhelming to be the \"It\" boy at thirteen, trading quips with Carson on \"The Tonight Show,\" but he matured and is admired as the rare child actor who successfully transitioned to adult roles and success. Green had roles in several feature films including \"Big Business,\" \"My Stepmother is an Alien,\" \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and many others. Green was a series regular as the son in ABC's \"Good and Evil,\" ABC's \"The Byrds of Paradise,\" and CBS' \"Temporarily Yours.\"\n\nSo what are his memories of being a child actor now that he's an adult? \"Vague. I met a lot of people at the right time who pointed me in the right direction. It humbled me,\" admits Green. \"You get wrapped up in the money and having people tell you you're great. You forget that you are just pretending. It comes just as fast as it goes.\"\n\nHe starred in David Mamet's \"American Buffalo\" at the Old Globe in San Diego in â96. \"It spoiled me,\" marvels Green, \"I had the benefit of doing one of the best plays a young actor can do with three of the best people I've ever worked with.\" On his rave reviews, Green modestly replies, \"I've been incredibly fortunate. My forays into certain mediums have been of such high quality it makes me look better than I am.\" Hey Seth, ever heard the expression scene-stealer? Everyone says it behind your back.\n\n\"Mike Myers is a classy, classy guy,\" says Green of his on-screen father, off-screen producer in 1997's \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,\" 1999's \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" and 2002's \"Austin Powers in Goldmember.\" Myers' directive: \"Improvise and try not to laugh,\" reports Green, who did just that as Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's estranged son. Green described his character as \"an angry, rebellious youth torn between wanting to hate his father and wanting to have a relationship with him.\" The added bonus of the film's success was the creation of a Scott Evil action figure that Green, a self-confessed \"longtime fan of action figures,\" helped develop for McFarlane Toys. \"It's the coolest, I've come full circle,\" says Green, who admits that he and his likeness \"differ in size and articulation.\"\n\nIn Columbia's \"Can't Hardly Wait,\" Green played Kenny Fisher, whom he described as \"a wannabe black kid -- my whole goal was to lose my virginity.\" Along the way, Green says, \"I fell down a lot. It was my Jack Tripper homage.\"\n\nGreen began his role as Oz, a guitarist and sometime werewolf, on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" in late '97 while filming \"Can't Hardly Wait.\" \"Joss Whedon, the show's creator, told me that Oz would have the same reaction to spray cheese as to true love.\" Green left the show in 1999 explaining that \"the character was always better served in a recurring capacity and Joss and I both felt it was better to revert to that status.\" His \"Buffy\" schedule precluded a larger role in Touchstone's Will Smith starrer, \"Enemy of the State,\" but Green was thrilled to work with director Tony Scott.\n\nGreen says \"Knockaround Guys\" was \"a fantastic script with inventive and creative directors,\" who described his character, Johnny Marbles, as \"a delusional screw-up. He's willing to stand up to anybody but gets beaten nine times out of ten.\" Playing two-bit con, Duane Cody, in Jerry Zucker's \"Rat Race, Green explains, \"I wanted to do as many stunts as the insurance company would allow.\" He did and had the bruises to prove it. In \"America's Sweethearts,\" starring Julia Roberts and John Cusack, Green played Danny Wax, a rising studio publicity executive under the tutelage of Billy Crystal's veteran character at a film junket from hell.\n\nBetween film roles, Green and Senreich debuted their series, \"Sweet J Presents,\" on Sony's Screenblast. The duo created/executive produced twelve webisodes utilizing stop-motion photography and are working in the same capacity for \"Robot Chicken,\" which was developed later. \"Robot Chicken Season 1\" DVD debuted as the #1 selling TV DVD in April, 2006.\n\nGreen fell in love with the script for Fox's series, \"Greg the Bunny\" and he portrayed Jimmy Bender, the best friend, roommate and co-worker to the title character, a puppet, or as he will correct you, \"a fabricated American.\" Eugene Levy played Seth's estranged father and employer as the producer of the children's show where Greg and Jimmy worked.\n\nIn 2003, Green portrayed a technological genius in Paramount's hit, \"The Italian Job\" and Killer Films' indie flick \"Party Monster,\" the true story of New York club-kid-turned-murderer Michael Alig, played by Macaulay Culkin, and James St. James, with Green narrating and starring as St. James. Green earned critical praise for his accurate portrayal of St. James during the heroin addict, wildly excessive part of his life.\n\nGreen spent months in New Zealand in 2003 filming the lead in \"Without a Paddle.\" The role required endless stunts and spooning with a bear but it paid off when it was released in 2004 as a surprisingly strong summer hit that remained in the theatres for five months. That year, Green also played a mysterious museum curator in \"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed.\"\n\nIn Fox's animated primetime series, \"Family Guy,\" Green plays Chris Griffin, the teenage son in a very dysfunctional family. The series debuted in 1999, ran sporadically for three seasons, got cancelled and went back into production in 2004 and has become a top ten staple. He also starred in the NBC series, \"Four Kings.\"\n\n\"Robot Chicken\" began airing in February, 2005 to record ratings on Adult Swim and Green and Senreich are not just the executive producers and creators but also co-write, co-direct and Green performs 35-60 voices each week on the pop culture parody show.\n\nStarring in multiple film and television projects is fulfilling and he's enjoying his newer role as a media mogul. \"I read so many scripts that are being produced that are just awful and some of the most incredible scripts never get made.\" He seems to have already reached his original goal: \"Getting all my friends together to make a movie once a year.\" Known for his professionalism on and off the set, Green says, \"I don't take myself seriously but I take what I do seriously -- I always want to work hard and to appreciate what I am getting.\" He and he childhood friend, Hugh Sterbakov, created a new comic book for Top Cow, \"Freshmen,\" which debuted at the 2005 Comic-Con and sold out across the country the week of its debut.\n\nGreen admits that his current busy schedule does not allow him to indulge in one of his favorite activities, watching every single film that is released. Well in that case, we'll just have to watch Green instead. You'll have to work hard to miss him."
