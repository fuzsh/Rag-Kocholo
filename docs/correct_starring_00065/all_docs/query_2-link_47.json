        "text": "Greg the Bunny - Parodies Not as Funny as the Fox Show\n\nGreg the Bunny - Best of the Film Parodies, is, sad to say, not nearly as interesting, funny, arresting or attention-getting as the Fox TV series that it follows. While returning to his public-access TV roots on the New York cable series \"Junktape,\" Greg lost something that made him so amusing and diverting. Maybe it's that his fellow cast has been whittled down to his faceless human counterparts from \"Junktape,\" Warren the Ape, and a new character called \"The Wumpus.\" Frankly, Wumpus is a breakout character, deserving of his own show, but he is sadly underused here. He has a few wonderfully funny standout bits, but the focus seems to be on Warren and Greg. While they are great characters (check out the DVD for the Fox sitcom version to see just *how* great), the absence of Sarah Silverman, Eugene Levy and Seth Green is striking. What made the puppets so diverting is their interplay with the human cast. I will always prize my \"Greg the Bunny\" Fox series DVD's, but the \"Film Parodies\" set makes me long for the good ol' days, even if they were only five years ago. Seriously, between cancelling \"Greg the Bunny\" and \"Firefly,\" (for which I will never forgive them) could Fox keep ANYthing of quality on the air in 2002?Read full review\n\nExcellent\n\nLoved it~!!! For fans of Greg the Bunny.........this is a must see. Of course, The Greg the Bunny television series was cancelled from FOX without being able to complete it's first season. So I will quote a character from the G.T.B. cast, by saying, \"Oh, how I pity you, you must squash that which you do not understand.\" This quote has been used before, but again it is true.\n\nNothing like the original show...in the worst ways possible\n\nAs much as I loooove Greg the Bunny, this dvd was NOT GOOD. The people who made it were trying too hard. It had NONE of the charm of the show and WAY too much farting/sexual/on-the-toilet humor. I mean, I dont mind a crude joke or two, but this was just bad. even my 18-yr old son hated it. Im so sorry, but this was so very bad and I wish I hadnt wasted my money on it"
