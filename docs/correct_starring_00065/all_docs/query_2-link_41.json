        "text": "Most teen films are the sort of thing that you’ll watch over and over when you’re a teenager, but then once an adult you try watch it again and are horrified by how awful it actually was. But every so often a gem will be made that somehow remains fun to watch even in our old age. Here’s my list of the teen films that I loved as a kid, and still love now. Enjoy! 🙂\n\nNUMBER 15\n\nTitle: Just One of the Girls (also known as Anything for Love)\n\nStarring: Corey Haim, Nicole Eggert, Cameron Bancroft, Johannah Newmarch, Gabe Khouth, Rachel Hayward, Lochlyn Munro, Kevin McNulty, and Wendy Van Riesen\n\nReleased in: 1993\n\nDirected by: Michael Keusch\n\nWritten by: Raul Fernandez\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: To avoid bullies on his way to a new school, Chris dresses up as a girl. It works like a charm, until he’s caught in costume by one of his teachers and is forced to stay in disguise. Things get tricky when he meets the girl of his dreams, and the girl’s brother tries to get with him.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s a by-the-numbers gender-swap film, but it’s still fun to see Corey Haim in drag. He does a good job of pretending to be a girl, and is actually passable, unlike so many others in the genre.\n\nNUMBER 14\n\nTitle: Just One of the Guys\n\nStarring: Joyce Hyser, Clayton Rohner, Billy Jacoby, Toni Hudson, William Zabka, Leigh McCloskey, and Sherilyn Fenn\n\nReleased in: 1985\n\nDirected by: Lisa Gottlieb\n\nWritten by: Dennis Feldman, Jeff Franklin\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After having her article passed over for an internship for a boy’s, Terri decides to enroll in a new school as a boy to prove that her article was passed over just because she’s a girl.\n\nWhy I Love It: Another gender-swap, but this is one of the best ones I’ve seen, from teen or adult fare. Joyce Hyser is hilariously wonderful, and actually makes for a rather attractive boy. But I’ve always liked the girly-boys, so I might be biased, hehe.\n\nNUMBER 13\n\nTitle: Cry-Baby\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Amy Locane, Ricki Lake, Traci Lords, Susan Tyrrell, Polly Bergen, Iggy Pop, Kim McGuire, Darren E Burrows, Stephen Mailer, and Kim Webb\n\nReleased in: 1990\n\nDirected by: John Waters\n\nWritten by: John Waters\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A bad-boy (or Drape) with a heart of gold falls for a good girl (or Square), and while the Drapes are very accepting of the girl, the Squares are determined to keep them apart.\n\nWhy I Love It: By all accounts, this should be an awful movie. But I don’t know, I absolutely love it. It’s silly with some pretty shifty acting, and is nothing close to real life, but I dunno, it all just works.\n\nNUMBER 12\n\nTitle: Save the Last Dance\n\nStarring: Julia Stiles, Sean Patrick Thomas, Kerry Washington, Fredro Starr, Terry Kinney, Bianca Lawson, Vince Green, Garland Whitt, and Dorothy Martin\n\nReleased in: 2001\n\nDirected by: Thomas Carter\n\nWritten by: Duane Adler, Cheryl Edwards\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After her mother dies in an accident, a white teen moves to LA with her father. She attends a new school in a poor area of town where most of the students are black. There she meets a boy who rekindles her love of dance.\n\nWhy I Love It: I love dance movies, even ones where the lead character isn’t really that good at it (her final dance routine was less than impressive). And then pair the dancing with a schmoopy love story and some good dramatic scenes, and you’ve got yourself a winning formula for a successful teen film.\n\nNUMBER 11\n\nTitle: Juno\n\nStarring: Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, JK Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Daniel Clark, and Rainn Wilson\n\nReleased in: 2007\n\nDirected by: Jason Reitman\n\nWritten by: Diablo Cody\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After getting pregnant by her best friend, a quirky teen decides to go ahead and have the baby, finding a couple to adopt the child in a PennySaver magazine.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s fun, quirky, and witty, and has a good message. Most of the actors are surprisingly good (except Jennifer Garner, who plays a plank of wood, as usual), and the writing is awesome, despite the fact that no one on the planet talks like they do (not before the film came out, anyways).\n\nNUMBER 10\n\nTitle: Get Real\n\nStarring: Ben Silverstone, Brad Gorton, Charlotte Brittain, Stacy Hart, Kate McEnery, and Patrick Nielsen\n\nReleased in: 1998\n\nDirected by: Simon Shore\n\nWritten by: Patrick Wilde\n\nBased On: The play of the same name by Patrick Wilde\n\n5 Second Synopsis: This tenderly romantic film tells the story of Steve, a young man in a British prep school, as he struggles with coming out and falling in love with the class jock, John. Who, amazingly, falls in love with him as well. But their relationship starts to feel the strain as John constantly hides his sexuality, and refuses to acknowledge Steve in public.\n\nWhy I Love It: Such a poignant love story, and one that all too many teens go through at least once in their lives, gay or straight. Unfortunately, sometimes love just isn’t enough. This is a wonderful little film, with good acting and writing. Definitely one to see if you enjoy the genre.\n\nNUMBER 9\n\nTitle: Can’t Hardly Wait\n\nStarring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ethan Embry, Seth Green, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose, Peter Facinelli, Jaime Pressly, Jenna Elfman, Melissa Joan Hart, Breckin Meyer, and Jerry O’Connell\n\nReleased in: 1998\n\nDirected by: Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan\n\nWritten by: Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After being in love with the school hottie for years, a shy student decides to finally tell her how he feels about her at their class’ graduation party. Of course, shenanigans ensue.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s fun, silly, sort of pointless, but that’s all part of it’s appeal. The actors do a great job acting like teenagers (no small feat, since most of the actors in the film are in their 20’s or 30’s). Grab your popcorn and prepare to laugh, swoon, and just have a good time.\n\nNUMBER 8\n\nTitle: Cruel Intentions\n\nStarring: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Sean Patrick Thomas, Joshua Jackson, Christine Baranski, Eric Mabius, and Swoosie Kurtz\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nDirected by: Roger Kumble\n\nWritten by: Roger Kumble\n\nBased On: Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Kathryn makes a bet that her step-brother, Sebastian, won’t be able to bed Annette (a virgin, who wants to wait until love). If he loses, Kathryn gets his Jaguar. If he wins, he gets Kathryn.\n\nWhy I Love It: Stronger writing and acting than most teen films of the time, and I guess it’s in part because of the fact that the source material was definitely not intended for kids. This is a definite gem of the 90’s.\n\nNUMBER 7\n\nTitle: Dazed and Confused\n\nStarring: Jason London, Wiley Wiggins, Matthew McConaughey, Rory Cochrane, Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Shawn Andrews, Marissa Ribisi, Anthony Rapp, Adam Goldberg, Sasha Jenson, Milla Jovovich, and Jeremy Fox\n\nReleased in: 1993\n\nDirected by: Richard Linklater\n\nWritten by: Richard Linklater\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: It’s the last day of school at a high school in a small town in Texas in 1976. The upperclassmen are hazing the incoming freshmen, and everyone is trying to get stoned, drunk, or laid, even the football players that signed a pledge not to.\n\nWhy I Love It: They say if you remember the 70’s you weren’t there. I may not remember them (since I wasn’t born yet), but I got a good idea of things were like with this fun, sometimes crazy, film. It’s also fun to see a bunch of big name actors getting their starts here, including Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, and Milla Jovovich. A total riot to watch, start to finish.\n\nNUMBER 6\n\nTitle: 10 Things I Hate About You\n\nStarring: Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz, Andrew Keegan, Susan May Pratt, Gabrielle Union, Larry Miller, Daryl Mitchell, and Allison Janney\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nDirected by: Gil Junger\n\nWritten by: Karen McCullah, Kirsten Smith\n\nBased On: The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare (loosely based :-p )\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A popular teen can’t date until her tempermental older sister starts dating too, so her suitor decides to pay the school bad-boy to ask her out.\n\nWhy I Love It: Well written, well acted with lots and lots of eye candy, this is one of the very best teen films to come out of the 90’s. It was also my introduction to the hunky Heath Ledger, who’s career I followed after seeing him here.\n\nNUMBER 5\n\nTitle: The Goonies\n\nStarring: Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Jeff Cohen, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Ke Huy Quan, John Matuszak, Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey\n\nReleased in: 1985\n\nDirected by: Richard Donner\n\nWritten by: Chris Columbus\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After finding out that his family will loose their home to an unscrupulous developer who’s buying up the neighbourhood to tear everything down and build a golf course, a teen and his friends make a pact to find a hidden treasure of legend in a local cave.\n\nWhy I Love It: I might be skating along the lines of what’s a teen film and what’s a kid’s film here, but it’s so good that I decided to go ahead and put it in anyways. So much fun, a definite childhood classic. Everybody do the truffle shuffle!! hehe\n\nNUMBER 4\n\nTitle: Hackers\n\nStarring: Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Jesse Bradford, Matthew Lillard, Renoly Santiago, Fisher Stevens, Laurence Mason, Lorraine Bracco, Marc Anthony, Wendell Pierce, and Alberta Watson\n\nReleased in: 1995\n\nDirected by: Iain Softley\n\nWritten by: Rafael Moreu\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A group of teen hackers find out about a plot to capsize an oil tanker if millions of dollars aren’t sent to a specific bank account, and with the police hot on their trails, they have to find the hacker behind the crime before they’re the ones blamed for it.\n\nWhy I Love It: It was one of the first films to really get me interested in computers. And even though I was very disappointed to find out real hacking is nothing like what is shown in this film, I’ve always had my own computer ever since then. Plus, with the caliber of actors that they were able to attract and a good director, that means that this is one of the best made teen films out there. So much fun, so much eye candy, and to top it all off, a totally bitchin soundtrack.\n\nNUMBER 3\n\nTitle: Pretty in Pink\n\nStarring: Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer, Andrew McCarthy, Annie Potts, James Spader, Andrew Dice Clay, and Harry Dean Stanton\n\nReleased in: 1986\n\nDirected by: Howard Deutch\n\nWritten by: John Hughes\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: When a rich boy and poor girl start dating, friends on either side will do anything to make sure they separate.\n\nWhy I Love It: One of the all time classics, this little teen film is so romantic sometimes that it’ll make you choke, and so funny in other times that you’ll pee yourself (ie: any scenes with Duckie. Love him!) All the teen romance clichés are here, and that’s because this film (and others around the same time) ‘invented’ all of them. Its look is very very 80’s, a lot of the clothes is hideous (especially that god damned pink dress at the end… what the hell were they thinking??? But I digress…), but it does nothing to take the wonderfulness of the film away. Plus, young James Spader. Meow.\n\nNUMBER 2\n\nTitle: The Breakfast Club\n\nStarring: Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, John Kapelos, and Paul Gleason\n\nReleased in: 1985\n\nDirected by: John Hughes\n\nWritten by: John Hughes\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Five very different teens are in an all detention in the school library. As the day goes by, they open up to each other and realize that they’re not as different as they thought.\n\nWhy I Love It: One of the quintessential teen films, this is one of the movies that started it all, with a group of actors affectionately known as The Brat Pack. I’m pretty sure I don’t need to explain why I love this one. It hits the high-school-life-nail right on its head. Amazing. And Judd Nelson as Bender? Holy hot!\n\nAnd now for my number 1, well…. I’m going to cheat here, big time. There was no way that I was going to be able to choose one or the other as my very favourite, so I decided to make my number 1 a tie. And so, here’s my…\n\nNUMBERS 1\n\nTitle: Empire Records\n\nStarring: Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, Anthony LaPaglia, Robin Tunney, Renée Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Ethan Embry, Coyote Shivers, Brendan Sexton III, Maxwell Caulfield, and Debi Mazar\n\nReleased in: 1995\n\nDirected by: Allan Moyle\n\nWritten by: Carol Heikkinen\n\nBased On: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: The employees of an independent music store learn about each other as they try anything to stop the store from being absorbed by a large chain.\n\nWhy I Love It: I can’t even explain how much I love this film. I saw it when it first came out (I was 14), and I fell instantly in love with it, and have been ever since. Thankfully, it still holds up well today, and I give it a watch every once in a while, and it never fails to make me smile.\n\nTitle: Clueless\n\nStarring: Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Donald Faison, Elisa Donovan, Breckin Meyer, Jeremy Sisto, Justin Walker, Julie Brown, Twink Caplan, Wallace Shawn, and Dan Hedaya\n\nReleased in: 1995\n\nDirected by: Amy Heckerling\n\nWritten by: Amy Heckerling\n\nBased On: Emma by Jane Austen (loosely based :-p )\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Popular, rich girls Cher and Dionne decide to take a new, frumpy student under their wing and give her a makeover, while their love lives run amok.\n\nWhy I Love It: I don’t think I need to explain how awesome this film is. It’s over the top and ridiculous in so many ways, but the actors are all perfect in their roles, and the film comes off as completely sweet and charming instead of grating and self-indulgent (the way I imagine teens in that world actually are ;-p ). They could not have picked a better actress for the main role of Cher, Alicia Silverstone is absolutely perfect.\n\nAnd that’s my list!! What are your favourite teen films? Let me know in the comments, and stay tuned for more!! 😀\n\nM.\n\nI thought I was going to have trouble choosing only 10 films to put on this list, and actually, the opposite turned out to be true. Looks like I haven’t seen as many biopics as I thought, and liked even fewer of them. But, I guess you could say that’s a good thing, since I enjoyed so few of them, that this list will end up being just the very best. No mediocrity here! hehe\n\nI’m also going to try do a wee bit of research to see just how true the film really is. But I’m not a historian, or a time traveler, nor do I have an all-seeing eye, so please don’t be a jerk if I get something wrong. Google knows a lot, but what it doesn’t know is which articles are the actual truth, and with so much info out there, it’s almost impossible to separate the real truth from the rumours. But I’ll do my best.\n\nI also won’t be including any horror or supernatural “true stories”. Since I already did both top horror and top serial killer films lists, I won’t include any of those in this list, to avoid repetition. And on that note, we’re off!\n\nNUMBER 10\n\nTitle: The Runaways\n\nStarring: Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, Michael Shannon, Stella Maeve, Scout Taylor-Compton, Alia Shawkat, Riley Keough, Johnny Lewis, and Tatum O’Neal\n\nReleased in: 2010\n\nDirected by: Floria Sigismondi\n\nWritten by: Floria Sigismondi\n\nBased On a Book?: Yes; Neon Angel: The Cherie Currie Story by Cherie Currie\n\nWho is the Story About?: Cherie Currie, Joan Jett and their short-lived band The Runaways\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: What Joan has said about the friction between Cherie, Kim Fowley, and herself: “There was more friendship than was shown. I never really had a falling-out with him, even after the band broke up. Disharmony is natural in any band. But there were times when we were on the same page. Kim and Cherie and I still have an extremely intimate bond.” What Cherie has said about the film depicting them as always being miserable: “And that’s not true at all. How do you shove two-and-a-half years into an hour and a half? That was tough because we had a lot of fun.”\n\nWhy I Love It: Such a fun film with great music and really strong acting. Think Kristen Stewart is a bad actress? Then you’ve only seen her in Twilight. Joan Jett herself has said that she was absolutely blown away by her performance. She was recorded as saying “It was like looking in a mirror”.\n\nNUMBER 9\n\nTitle: The Basketball Diaries\n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, Patrick McGaw, Juliette Lewis, Bruno Kirby, and Ernie Hudson\n\nReleased in: 1995\n\nDirected by: Scott Kalvert\n\nWritten by: Bryan Goluboff\n\nBased On a Book?: Yes; The Basketball Diaries by Jim Carroll\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The drug-hazed teenage years of writer/musician Jim Carroll.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: What Jim Carroll has said about the film: “I thought it was well made. I thought the performances were fantastic. I thought Leonardo was wonderful; I couldn’t have asked for a better actor. I thought the whole cast was great. Unfortunately, the director had no idea what my book was about. And then the ending was much more ambiguous [originally]. They changed it and re-shot it in LA, so I didn’t know about that until I saw the final version of the film. And so I said, “You’re not gonna like make it fucked up and preachy and stuff??” and they said, “No, no!” But that’s what they did!”\n\nWhy I Love It: Despite the fact that it’s pretty far from the truth, it’s still a wonderful, albeit hard to watch, film. Leo turns his performance up to 11, and he really shines.\n\nNUMBER 8\n\nTitle: Cleopatra\n\nStarring: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Hume Cronyn, Martin Landau, Roddy McDowall, Robert Stephens, Francesca Annis, George Cole, and Kenneth Haigh\n\nReleased in: 1963\n\nDirected by: Joseph L Mankiewicz\n\nWritten by: Joseph L Mankiewicz, Ranald MacDougall, Sidney Buchman\n\nBased On a Book?: Yes; The Life and Times of Cleopatra by CM Franzero, plus historical texts by Plutarch, Appian, and Suetonius\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The life, rule and eventual death of Ancient Egypt’s last Pharaoh, Queen Cleopatra, and the two men in her life, Julius Caeser and Mark Antony.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: Wikipedia says: “On the whole, the film followed the history of the period fairly closely, and took fewer liberties with historical accuracy than several other epics. However, there are a few minor inaccuracies:” Click here for the list.\n\nWhy I Love It: I don’t think I need to explain. I love everything Ancient Egyptian, and this film is beautiful, lush, and actually quite historically accurate, which is sadly rare in Hollywood. Elizabeth Taylor is breath-taking in the lead role, oozing sexuality and power, much as I assume the real Cleopatra would have.\n\nNUMBER 7\n\nTitle: Braveheart\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Angus Macfadyen, Catherine McCormack, Brendan Gleeson, Brian Cox, Peter Hanly, Stephen Billington, Barry McGovern, and Tommy Flanagan\n\nReleased in: 1995\n\nDirected by: Mel Gibson\n\nWritten by: Randall Wallace\n\nBased On a Book?: Yes; The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace by “Blind Harry”\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The life and death of William Wallace, a 13th century Scot who led the First War of Scottish Independence against Edward I of England.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: This is one of the most famously inaccurate films in Hollywood history. I won’t even try to list it all. Click here to see what Wikipedia has to say on the subject. Give yourself some time, there’s a lot there :-p\n\nWhy I Love It: Despite it’s glaring inaccuracies, one can’t deny this is a beautiful, powerful film. Shows just what Mel Gibson could accomplish before he went bat-shit crazy.\n\nNUMBER 6\n\nTitle: Remember the Titans\n\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Donald Faison, Craig Kirkwood, Ryan Gosling, Hayden Panettiere, Kip Pardue, Ethan Suplee, Nicole Ari Parker, and Kate Bosworth\n\nReleased in: 2000\n\nDirected by: Boaz Yakin\n\nWritten by: Gregory Allen Howard\n\nBased On a Book?: No\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: Black football coach Herman Boone is assigned to TC Williams High School’s team the Titans, and the first inter-racial school in the United States.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: The core of the story (integration of the races, most of the players and games) seems to be all there, but a lot of the smaller details (or most of them, rather) are fictionalized. Click here to see what Chasing the Frog (a website devoted to uncovering the real truth behind Hollywood’s “true stories”) has to say about it.\n\nWhy I Love It: I’m not the biggest fan of sports films, or sports in general for that matter (except hockey, I am Canadian, after all 😉 ), but every so often one comes along that I really love. The story is good, the acting all on point, and it’s so fun to see a bunch of actors who are big now getting their start here, like hunky Ryan Gosling.\n\nNUMBER 5\n\nTitle: Immortal Beloved\n\nStarring: Gary Oldman, Jeroen Krabbé, Isabella Rossellini, Johanna ter Steege, Marco Hofschneider, Miriam Margolyes, Barry Humphries, and Valeria Golino\n\nReleased in: 1994\n\nDirected by: Bernard Rose\n\nWritten by: Bernard Rose\n\nBased On a Book?: No\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The life (and loves) of great composer Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: I actually didn’t know a whole lot (that means nothing) about Beethoven’s life before writing this except for what I’d seen in the film. Doing my Googling now, I can see that I may as well have been watching fiction. In the words of movie critic Lewis Butler: “About the only things they got right were that Beethoven wrote the 9th Symphony and that he died.” Ouch. You can read the rest of his review here.\n\nWhy I Love It: Having not known how historically inaccurate it was before now will be my excuse for loving this as much as I did. Bah, who am I kidding? I’d have loved it anyways. It’s beautiful, schmoopy, and Gary Oldman gives a tour de force performance, as usual.\n\nNUMBER 4\n\nTitle: Party Monster\n\nStarring: Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green, Chloë Sevigny, Dylan McDermott, Wilmer Valderrama, Wilson Cruz, Mia Kirshner, and Marilyn Manson\n\nReleased in: 2003\n\nDirected by: Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato\n\nWritten by: Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato\n\nBased On a Book?: Yes; Disco Bloodbath by James St James\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The rise and fall of legendary 90’s “club kid” Michael Alig.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: When asked if the film retained “the true vibe of it all”, James St James had this to say: “Well, was Cleopatra really like Elizabeth Taylor? Was Erin Brockovich anything like Julia Roberts? Movies are movies. They are meant to entertain. Was it a moment-by-moment depiction of our lives and our relationship? Oh my god no. But it captured the spirit of the times and that’s all you can hope for.” He has also expressed pure love for Seth Green and his performance.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s fun, colourful, with great music and great performances, especially, as James has said, Seth Green’s. He ate up every inch of the screen while he was on it, and it was wonderful.\n\nNUMBER 3\n\nTitle: Gladiator\n\nStarring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Spencer Treat Clark, Richard Harris, David Schofield, and John Shrapnel\n\nReleased in: 2000\n\nDirected by: Ridley Scott\n\nWritten by: David Franzoni, John Logan, William Nicholson\n\nBased On a Book?: No\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: An enslaved soldier determined to see the Emperor who murdered his family pay for his crimes.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: Well… Commodus was real, as were all the other members of his family. And that’s about it. Heroic Maximus is fiction. Commodus wasn’t the swellest dude around, but he was nowhere near as gross as he’s played on screen. Here’s a more detailed account of the historical untruths told by the film, on a cool blog called Historical Histrionics. Looks like he only did a few posts, though, which is a shame, because they’re well written.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s actually thanks to this film, historical inaccuracies and all, that I got so interested in ancient history. I mean, I’d always been interested, especially in ancient Egypt, but seeing this really made me want to know more about ancient Rome. I was a little disappointed to find out how inaccurate this film actually is, but it didn’t make me love it any less.\n\nNUMBER 2\n\nTitle: Chaplin\n\nStarring: Robert Downey Jr, Geraldine Chaplin, Paul Rhys, Moira Kelly, Anthony Hopkins, Dan Aykroyd, Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann Miller, Kevin Kline, Maria Pitillo, and Milla Jovovich\n\nReleased in: 1992\n\nDirected by: Richard Attenborough\n\nWritten by: William Boyd, Bryan Forbes, William Goldman\n\nBased On a Book?: Yes; My Autobiography by Charles Chaplin, and Chaplin His Life and Art by David Robinson\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The life and work of legendary comedian Charlie Chaplin.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: I’m actually having some trouble looking stuff up. There’s lots of reviews of the film, but even Wikipedia doesn’t have much on whether or not it’s very accurate. As far as I can tell, it seems to pretty accurate, although there’s a lot cut out (the man lived to 88, you couldn’t get all that into one film), and they seem to gloss over some rather important stuff, while focusing on some more minor things. Gotta highlight the dramatic, I guess. This movie review was the one I found with the most historical information.\n\nWhy I Love It: This is the film that made me fall in love with Robert Downey Jr. He was ridiculously perfect for the role, and the rest of the film just falls perfectly into place around him. He should have won the Oscar that year. I’ve no idea who won, but I can tell you that he wasn’t as good as Robert.\n\nNUMBER 1\n\nTitle: Amadeus\n\nStarring: Tom Hulce, F Murray Abraham, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy Dotrice, Simon Callow, Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, and Charles Kay\n\nReleased in: 1984\n\nDirected by: Milos Forman\n\nWritten by: Peter Shaffer\n\nBased On a Book?: No, a play :-p Amadeus by Peter Shaffer\n\nWho/What is the Story About?: The life, music, and death of musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nHow Close to the Truth Is It?: Well… not very actually. In the words of movie critic Alex von Tunzelmann: “A deadly rivalry that never was, a dried-up bachelor who was actually a father of eight, and flops that were hits in reality … even getting Mozart’s toilet humour right cannot redeem it.” She definitely didn’t like the film. You can read the rest of her scathing review here.\n\nWhy I Love It: I knew going into it that it wasn’t historically accurate. And do I care? Not a lick. I know a biopic is supposed to tell a true story, and I am sorry that so many people think that this is the way things actually went down, but I’ll be damned if I don’t just love this film to pieces. Fart jokes and all.\n\nWhat are your favourite biopics? Let me know in the comments, and stay tuned for more!\n\nM.\n\nSo, articles like the one you’re about to read are actually one of the biggest reasons that I decided to start blogging in the first place. I love reading Top 10 (or more) lists about all sorts of stuff, but I always get frustrated that a lot of the stuff that I enjoy the most either are low in the lists, or not there at all. And the top spots are often reserved for the same old “classics”, most of which I don’t like. After reading the millionth Top Horror Movies article with movies like The Shining, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria and others in the top spots, I decided that I’d make my own blog where I can show people that there are other movies than those in the world, and they’re just as good (or better, even) than those so-called classics.\n\nI also won’t be putting them in exact order, because I just don’t have the patience to sit there and sort them all. I also doubt that I could choose a definitive order to put them in. So what I’ll do is kind of make it a Top 5, each number having a 10-way tie. And those 10 won’t be in any order, either. So with that said, allons-y!! 😀\n\nNUMBERS 5\n\nTitle: Cube\n\nReleased in: 1997\n\nStarring: Maurice Dean Wint, Nicole de Boer, David Hewlett, Nicky Guadagni, Andrew Miller, and Julian Richings\n\nDirected by: Vincenzo Natali\n\nWritten by: André Bijelic, Vincenzo Natali, and Graeme Manson\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Seven strangers awaken to find themselves captive in what seems like an endless cubic maze, each door leading either to safety or a gruesome death.\n\nWhy I Love It: A brilliant, character driven film that doesn’t shy away from the atrocities that humanity is capable of in a survival of the fittest kind of environment. And while there are a few gruesome scenes when the prisoners accidentally enter a booby trapped room, the film never goes too far with it. Nothing like buckets of pointless gore to ruin a great film.\n\nTitle: Jeepers Creepers\n\nReleased in: 2001\n\nStarring: Gina Philips, Justin Long, Jonathan Breck, Patricia Belcher, Brandon Smith, and Eileen Brennan\n\nDirected by: Victor Salva\n\nWritten by: Victor Salva\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Siblings Darry and Trish are driving home together from school when they are followed and attacked by a humanoid creature driving a big, rusty truck who wants to eat them to regenerate its own body parts.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s a slightly ridiculous concept with sometimes shaky acting, but the visuals and effects are great, the villain is suitably creepy, and the whole film just gives off a vibe of great fun. It’s not very scary (to me anyways), but it’s always a good time.\n\nTitle: Re-Animator\n\nReleased in: 1985\n\nStarring: Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott, Barbara Crampton, David Gale, and Robert Sampson\n\nDirected by: Stuart Gordon\n\nWritten by: Dennis Paoli, William Norris, and Stuart Gordon\n\nBased On: Herbert West, Re-Animator by HP Lovecraft\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young medical student finds himself in over his head when new student Herbert West arrives with his experiments. Experiments to bring dead flesh back to life.\n\nWhy I Love It: This film is totally nuts, start to finish, but it’s got that 80’s horror charm, and Jeffrey Combs is electrifying, eating up the whole screen every time he’s on it. The film also boasts the most uncomfortable-to-watch “sex” scene in the history of film. You’ll spend most of the film not knowing whether to laugh or cringe, but that’s just part of the appeal of this classic gem.\n\nTitle: Saw\n\nReleased in: 2004\n\nStarring: Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung, Dina Meyer, Monica Potter, and Shawnee Smith\n\nDirected by: James Wan\n\nWritten by: Leigh Whannell\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Two men wake up in an almost empty room, each chained by the foot on opposite ends of the room, with a dead man sprawled on the ground between them. A cassette player informs them that to escape one must kill the other, or saw their own foot off with a provided jigsaw.\n\nWhy I Love It: When it first came out, Saw was unlike anything the horror genre had seen in a long time, a real breath of fresh air. It was a wonderful idea, and very well executed, with only a little shaky acting sometimes. Unfortunately, with all the sequels that came after, the Saw name became synonymous with “crap”, and the brilliance of the first film became lost in the sea of awful sequels.\n\nTitle: The Crazies\n\nReleased in: 2010\n\nStarring: Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Joe Anderson, Danielle Panabaker, Christie Lynn Smith, Brett Rickaby, and John Aylward\n\nDirected by: Breck Eisner\n\nWritten by: Scott Kosar & Ray Wright\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Remake of 1973’s The Crazies, directed by George A Romero and starring Lane Carroll\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After having their water contaminated, inhabitants of a small town become infected by a virus that makes them incredibly, mindlessly homicidal.\n\nWhy I Love It: Despite its rather silly name, this is a great film. I’m not much of a zombie movie fan, so I was reluctant to watch this one, but I was really glad I finally did. It may be classed as a zombie film, but besides a few similarities to the genre, it’s thankfully quite different. No dead people shambling around trying to eat flesh, this film is tense and sometimes scary, with great acting and awesome effects. This isn’t your grandfather’s zombie film :-p\n\nTitle: The Pit & the Pendulum\n\nReleased in: 1991\n\nStarring: Lance Henriksen, Rona de Ricci, Jonathan Fuller, Stephen Lee, Mark Margolis, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, Jeffrey Combs, and Frances Bay\n\nDirected by: Stuart Gordon\n\nWritten by: Dennis Paoli\n\nBased On: The Pit and the Pendulum by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No. While The Pit and the Pendulum has been made into several films, this one isn’t a remake of any particular film.\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: An innocent young woman is arrested for witchcraft and tortured, while the leader of the inquisition, the evil Torquemada, lusts after her.\n\nWhy I Love It: I love Poe’s stories and poems, so it’s no surprise that I’d love the films based on his works. The film screams 90’s camp, but that’s hardly a bad thing. Lance Henriksen is wonderfully evil, he really makes the film the little gem that it is.\n\nTitle: The Relic\n\nReleased in: 1997\n\nStarring: Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt, James Whitmore, Clayton Rohner, Chi Muoi Lo, Thomas Ryan, and Lewis van Bergen\n\nDirected by: Peter Hyams\n\nWritten by: Amy Jones, John Baffo, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver\n\nBased On: Relic by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A detective teams up with an anthropologist when strange murders are committed in a museum, bodies discovered with the hypothalamus of the brain missing. They discover a strange, monstrous creature living beneath the museum, and it seems to need to eat these missing brain pieces.\n\nWhy I Love It: Now, I saw this film before reading the book, which is a very, very good thing. If I’d have read the book first, I’d have been very upset, since the main protagonist of the book series (Special Agent Pendergast) isn’t even in the film! But since I saw the film first, I was able to just take it as it was, and I loved it. It was the best monster movie of its time, and still holds up well today. A real fun ride.\n\nTitle: Thirteen Ghosts\n\nReleased in: 2001\n\nStarring: Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davitz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, JR Bourne, Rah Digga, and F Murray Abraham\n\nDirected by: Steve Beck\n\nWritten by: Benjamin Carr & Richard D’Ovidio\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Remake of 1960’s 13 Ghosts, directed by William Castle and starring Donald Woods\n\n5 Second Synopsis: When his uncle dies, a man takes his two children and their nanny to visit the house that they inherited. While looking through the gorgeous glass house, they unwittingly release 12 very powerful, very homicidal ghosts.\n\nWhy I Love It: I’m not sure why I love this one so much, but I really do. I know it’s far from being a perfect film, but I don’t know, I just have so much fun watching it, and the ghosts are just so cool and well done that it doesn’t matter that half the film doesn’t really make sense, hehe.\n\nTitle: Underworld\n\nReleased in: 2003\n\nStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Bill Nighy, Sophia Myles, Erwin Leder, Robby Gee, and Wentworth Miller\n\nDirected by: Len Wiseman\n\nWritten by: Danny McBride\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A beautiful vampire warrior allies herself with a newly bitten werewolf when she begins to suspect that the war that has been raging for centuries between their two races is built on lies.\n\nWhy I Love It: A whole lot of style with a little substance, but it hardly matters. This film is so fun to watch, so visually pleasing that you can’t help but love it. And the story, while it’s the same old same old rehashed stuff, is just different enough to keep you entertained. And talk about eye candy, my goodness…\n\nTitle: Warlock\n\nReleased in: 1989\n\nStarring: Julian Sands, Richard E Grant, Lori Singer, Mary Woronov, and Kevin O’Brien\n\nDirected by: Steve Miner\n\nWritten by: David Twohy\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: An evil warlock opens a portal from his time, the 17th century, to the present day to escape execution. A righteous witch-hunter jumps into the portal after him just before it closes, and vows to stop the warlock’s evil for good.\n\nWhy I Love It: Julian Sands. Do I really need another reason? Oh, I do? Well, I guess it’s a good thing that the film is so much fun, then! Wonderfully campy and acted better than most movies in its genre, it’s definitely a gem of the 80’s.\n\nNUMBERS 4\n\nTitle: Event Horizon\n\nReleased in: 1997\n\nStarring: Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs, Jack Noseworthy, Richard T Jones, and Sean Pertwee\n\nDirected by: Paul WS Anderson\n\nWritten by: Philip Eisner\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A rescue crew is sent to investigate a ship that has been missing in deep space for years. Once on board, they realize that the abandoned vessel isn’t as empty as they first thought.\n\nWhy I Love It: Everything about the film is awesome. Great acting, great effects, great story, and just enough gore to slightly turn your stomach but not enough to just make it a gore-fest (which, you all may know by now, I’m not fond of). Almost 20 years later, it still gives me shivers while watching. A sign of a job well done!\n\nTitle: Frailty\n\nReleased in: 2001\n\nStarring: Bill Paxton, Matthew McConaughey, Matt O’Leary, Jeremy Sumpter, and Powers Boothe\n\nDirected by: Bill Paxton\n\nWritten by: Brent Hanley\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A man confesses to an FBI agent his family’s story of how his religious fanatic father’s visions lead to a series of murders to destroy supposed “demons.” (Taken from IMDB, I was having a hell of a time trying to make a small synopsis, hehe.)\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s absolutely brilliant. Well written, incredibly acted, a wonderfully creepy story with a killer twist, before twists were a dime a dozen. Just wonderful.\n\nTitle: Ginger Snaps\n\nReleased in: 2000\n\nStarring: Katharine Isabelle, Emily Perkins, Kris Lemche, Jesse Moss, Danielle Hampton, John Bourgeois, and Mimi Rogers\n\nDirected by: John Fawcett\n\nWritten by: Karen Walton\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After being attacked by a large, furry creature on the night of a full moon, teenager Ginger and her sister Brigitte are on the lookout for clues that she is turning into a werewolf.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s fun, it’s bloody, it’s smartly written, well acted and has cool practical effects. Werewolf films are hard to do without getting schlocky, but Ginger Snaps manages just fine. Also, Katharine Isabelle is a fox. And she loves making horror films, good news for us pervy horror fans! 😉\n\nTitle: Idle Hands\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Devon Sawa, Seth Green, Jessica Alba, Elden Henson, Vivica A Fox, Jack Noseworthy, Katie Wright, and Christopher Hart’s hand\n\nDirected by: Rodman Flender\n\nWritten by: Terri Hughes & Ron Milbauer\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A stoner’s hand becomes possessed by an evil spirit and it kills his two best friends. To try stop the killing, he chops his hand off but, much to his chagrin, it just keeps moving and escapes his house to go wreak havoc at a school Halloween dance.\n\nWhy I Love It: Despite its silly subject matter, this film is actually quite good. Laugh out loud funny with awesome special effects (that still hold up today), it’s a great popcorn movie. Plus, Devon Sawa. Total 90’s babe. Meow.\n\nTitle: Near Dark\n\nReleased in: 1987\n\nStarring: Adrian Pasdar, Jenny Wright, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, Joshua John Miller, and Tom Thomerson\n\nDirected by: Kathryn Bigelow\n\nWritten by: Kathryn Bigelow & Eric Red\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After being bit by a beautiful vampire, a young man is given an ultimatum by her “family”: make a kill within a week, or die. When he realizes he can’t kill, he and the girl run off, with her family in hot pursuit.\n\nWhy I Love It: I saw this for the first time as a teenager, and it had everything a teenage girl could possibly want. Romance, eye candy, and lots and lots of blood. Oh yeah 😀\n\nTitle: Repo! The Genetic Opera\n\nReleased in: 2008\n\nStarring: Alexa Vega, Anthony Stewart Head, Paul Sorvino, Terrance Zdunich, Sarah Brightman, Paris Hilton, Bill Moseley, and Nivek Ogre\n\nDirected by: Darren Lynn Bousman\n\nWritten by: Terrance Zdunich & Darren Smith\n\nBased On: Their play of the same name.\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Set in a future where surgery has become a fashion statement, a chronically ill teen longs for the outside world. When she finally gets her wish, she’s quick to notice that not everything in her life is as it seems.\n\nWhy I Love It: A goth musical? With Sarah Brightman, Ogre, and Giles? How the heck could I not love it?? Great songs, great performances (even Paris! *gasp!*), and killer costumes, this was an instant cult classic. So much fun.\n\nTitle: Signs\n\nReleased in: 2002\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones, and Patricia Kalember\n\nDirected by: M Night Shyamalan\n\nWritten by: M Night Shyamalan\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A preacher and his family find giant crop circles in their corn. Then they, and the rest of the world, come to realize that this time, it’s no hoax.\n\nWhy I Love It: A lot of people say that this was the beginning of the end for Shyamalan’s films, but I really liked this one. Yes, there’s a lot of self indulgent bullshit, but there’s a lot of great, tense moments, too, which more than make up for it.\n\nTitle: Sinister\n\nReleased in: 2012\n\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, James Ransone, Michael Hall D’Addario, Clare Foley, and Nick King\n\nDirected by: Scott Derrickson\n\nWritten by: Scott Derrickson & C Robert Cargill\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A true crime writer moves his family into a house where a horrific quadruple murder took place. He finds old reels of home video in the attic that leads him to believe that these murders were just one in a string of horrifying serial murders, taking place as far back as the 60’s.\n\nWhy I Love It: This is an excellent piece of film. Well acted, well written, awesomely atmospheric. Us horror fans are blessed that an actor of Ethan Hawke’s caliber loves doing horror films. But before you write this off as “just another ghost story”, think again. It’d probably have been higher on the list, but I’ve only seen it once, and so many others are higher simply for being loved longer, hehe.\n\nTitle: The Exorcism of Emily Rose\n\nReleased in: 2005\n\nStarring: Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Jennifer Carpenter, Campbell Scott, Colm Feore, Joshua Close, Kenneth Welsh, Duncan Fraser, and Mary Beth Hurt\n\nDirected by: Scott Derrickson\n\nWritten by: Paul Harris Boardman & Scott Derrickson\n\nBased On: A true story\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A tough lawyer takes on the case of a priest who is accused of negligent homicide after the death of a young woman on whom he had performed an exorcism.\n\nWhy I Love It: Exorcism movies, I find, are either amazing, or they’re crappy. There doesn’t seem to be a middle ground. This one is amazing. You wouldn’t think a courtroom drama and exorcism horror would mesh well together in the same film, but they really do. I don’t believe for a moment that this is actually a true story (not the possession part anyways, the exorcism and trial were real enough, though), but it’s captivating, and all the acting is wonderful, especially from Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter.\n\nTitle: The Exorcist III\n\nReleased in: 1990\n\nStarring: George C Scott, Ed Flanders, Brad Dourif, Jason Miller, Nicol Williamson, Scott Wilson, Nancy Fish, and George DiCenzo\n\nDirected by: William Peter Blatty\n\nWritten by: William Peter Blatty\n\nBased On: Legion by William Peter Blatty\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Sequel to 1973’s The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin and starring Linda Blair.\n\n5 Second Synopsis: As a police lieutenant mourns on the anniversary of his friend’s death (Father Karras, from the first film), a serial killer strikes whose MO is eerily similar to a killer’s who’s been dead for 15 years.\n\nWhy I Love It: This is the sequel that The Exorcist should of had, instead of the abomination that was made (seriously, what the hell was that??) It’s a great story, and has real scares, with none of the camp that 90’s horror was so famous for. A real, under-rated gem.\n\nNUMBERS 3\n\nTitle: Constantine\n\nReleased in: 2005\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Rachael Weisz, Shia LeBoeuf, Tilda Swinton, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Max Baker, and Peter Stormare\n\nDirected by: Francis Lawrence\n\nWritten by: Kevin Brodbin & Frank A Cappello\n\nBased On: Hellblazer by Jamie Delano & Garth Ennis\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A supernatural detective stumbles on a world-ending plot while ridding the world of demons.\n\nWhy I Love It: I won’t try give credit where none is due, Keanu Reeves is still a pretty bad actor. And yet this movie is awesome. The film doesn’t follow the books very closely (but that’s ok with me since I didn’t enjoy them all that much anyways). But the story is great, the effects are amazing, and the supporting cast is very strong, giving poor Keanu all the help he needs.\n\nTitle: Dracula 2000\n\nReleased in: 2000\n\nStarring: Gerard Butler, Justine Waddell, Jonny Lee Miller, Christopher Plummer, Colleen Fitzpatrick, Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, Jeri Ryan, and Nathan Fillion\n\nDirected by: Patrick Lussier\n\nWritten by: Joel Soisson\n\nBased On: Characters created by Bram Stoker\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No. The Dracula story has been told in countless films, but this film, while based on the same story as all the others, is its own film, not based on its predecessors.\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: In modern-day London, the long-entrapped Count Dracula is unwittingly released by thieves, and goes to New Orleans to find the one born of his blood, Mary Van Helsing.\n\nWhy I Love It: It’s fun, hip, relatively well acted, and has a neat new idea for the identity of everyone’s favourite Count. Gerard Butler turns in a mesmerizing performance, it remains one of my very favourite on-screen vampire portrayals of all time. And he’s so sexy in this. So very, very sexy…. mmmmmmm… *snaps out of it* Ok, I’m done, sorry :-p\n\nTitle: From Dusk Till Dawn\n\nReleased in: 1996\n\nStarring: George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, and Ted Williamson\n\nDirected by: Robert Rodriguez\n\nWritten by: Quentin Tarantino\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Two brothers on the run from the law take a father with his two kids hostage to sneak across the border into Mexico in their RV. Once there, they hole up in a brothel for the night to await a contact. Little do they know that this brothel is also a vampire nest, and they’re going to have to fight through the night if they want to survive.\n\nWhy I Love It: What not to love about this film? Badass characters, hyper-violence, buckets of blood, and lots of boobage, this movie is a ton and a half of fun, while still boasting a solid cast of good actors, and killer practical effects. Grab the popcorn and have a blast!\n\nTitle: Identity\n\nReleased in: 2003\n\nStarring: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, John C McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey, and Pruitt Taylor Vince\n\nDirected by: James Mangold\n\nWritten by: Michael Cooney\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A group of strangers gets trapped in a small motel while a storm floods the roads. Elsewhere, a doctor awaits the arrival of his patient, who is on death row and is to be executed the next day.\n\nWhy I Love It: Despite some rather shaky acting from some of the smaller cast members, this film is amazing. Good acting from the core actors, awesome story that’ll keep you guessing till the very end, and a killer twist that actually makes sense. I’d have preferred the last 2 minutes to be cut from the film, though, I find it kinda cheapens the whole thing, which is why I gave it 9 stars instead of 10.\n\nTitle: Queen of the Damned\n\nReleased in: 2002\n\nStarring: Stuart Townsend, Aaliyah, Marguerite Moreau, Vincent Perez, Paul McGann, Lena Olin, and Matthew Newton\n\nDirected by: Michael Rymer\n\nWritten by: Scott Abbott & Michael Patroni\n\nBased On: The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned by Anne Rice\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Sequel to 1994’s Interview with the Vampire, directed by Neil Jordan and starring Brad Pitt.\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A long-sleeping vampire wakes when a bold and arrogant younger vampire decides to start a rock band, and divulges “vampire secrets” in his lyrics.\n\nWhy I Love It: The acting is pretty shaky, the story is so far from Anne Rice’s original idea that it probably shouldn’t be allowed to claim to be based on her books, it’s full of clichés, and yet I love it. And nothing anyone can say will change my mind. Trust me, people have tried :-p\n\nTitle: Stir of Echoes\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Zachary David Cope, Kevin Dunn, Conor O’Farrell, and Jennifer Morrison\n\nDirected by: David Koepp\n\nWritten by: David Koepp\n\nBased On: A Stir of Echoes by Richard Matheson\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After being hypnotized, a family man starts to unravel after he starts seeing cryptic messages from a ghostly girl.\n\nWhy I Love It: Wonderfully acted, creepy and atmospheric, and well written, this is an almost perfect ghost story.\n\nTitle: The Exorcist\n\nReleased in: 1973\n\nStarring: Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J Cobb, William O’Malley, and Mercedes McCambridge\n\nDirected by: William Friedkin\n\nWritten by: William Peter Blatty\n\nBased On: The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty, a true story\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After playing with a Ouija board, a young girl is possessed by a malevolent demon. Her mother begs a priest to perform an exorcism to save her.\n\nWhy I Love It: Just the right amount of body horror with psychological terror, this is one of the original greats. Saw it for the first time when I was 16, and it still scares me today. A true classic.\n\nTitle: The Last Man on Earth\n\nReleased in: 1964\n\nStarring: Vincent Price, Franca Bettoia, and Giacomo Rossi-Stuart\n\nDirected by: Ubaldo Ragona\n\nWritten by: William F Leicester & Richard Matheson\n\nBased On: I Am Legend by Richard Matheson\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After an epidemic sweeps the globe and turns everyone into blood-sucking monsters, a lone survivor searches for a cure, while killing as many of the monsters as he can.\n\nWhy I Love It: Vincent Price, Richard Matheson, and vampires? Of course I love it! No other reason is necessary! 😀\n\nTitle: The Mummy\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin J O’Connor, Oded Fehr, Jonathan Hyde, and Patricia Velasquez\n\nDirected by: Stephen Sommers\n\nWritten by: Stephen Sommers\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Reimagining of 1932’s The Mummy, directed by Karl Freund and starring Boris Karloff\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Adventurers looking for treasure and artifacts on an ancient Egyptian site accidentally awaken an evil mummy that had been buried for thousands of years.\n\nWhy I Love It: I love anything to do with ancient Egypt, supernatural or otherwise, so it was a given that I’d love this one. Thankfully, it also happens to be great fun to watch.\n\nTitle: The Stand\n\nReleased in: 1994\n\nStarring: Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Jamey Sheridan, Adam Storke, Laura San Giacomo, Ruby Dee, Rob Lowe, Corin Nemec, Matt Frewer, Miguel Ferrer, and Ray Walston\n\nDirected by: Mick Garris\n\nWritten by: Stephen King\n\nBased On: The Stand by Stephen King\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After a man-made super flu kills 99% of the people on earth, the survivors band together into two groups, one drawn by dreams of a kind old lady, the others by an evil man.\n\nWhy I Love It: I saw this at 13 when it first aired on tv, and I hadn’t read the book yet, which was probably a good thing, since it allowed me to love the mini-series, and not continuously compare it to the book. When I read the book a few years later, I was amazed at how much extra stuff was in it, but my love of the show was already cemented, hehe. It’s hopelessly dated, but it’s still a fun watch.\n\nNUMBERS 2\n\nTitle: Aliens\n\nReleased in: 1986\n\nStarring: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, and William Hope\n\nDirected by: James Cameron\n\nWritten by: James Cameron\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Sequel to 1979’s Alien, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney Weaver.\n\n5 Second Synopsis: The sole survivor from the first film assists a tough group of space marines in containing the Xenomorph threat, while a malevolent company wants the alien offspring captured alive. Naturally, stuff goes very wrong.\n\nWhy I Love It: Do I really have to explain myself? A definite success in the merging of sci-fi and horror genres, it was, and remains, one of the best films of its genre. Everything was done so well that it’s easy to forget that the film wasn’t made recently, but rather almost 30 years ago. A sign of a job well done!\n\nTitle: Beetlejuice\n\nReleased in: 1988\n\nStarring: Michael Keeton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, Catherine O’Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Glenn Shadix\n\nDirected by: Tim Burton\n\nWritten by: Michael McDowell & Warren Skaaren\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After a young couple tragically dies in an accident, they’re told that they will have to “haunt” their house for quite a few number of years. When a new family moves in and start making changes to their beloved home, they contact a “bio-exorcist” to make them leave.\n\nWhy I Love It: This film almost didn’t make the list at all, since I wasn’t sure if I should include it in a horror list, but it’s so awesome that I decided to go ahead and add it. Wickedly funny with awesome practical effects, this has been one of my favourites since I was a kid.\n\nTitle: The Cabin in the Woods\n\nReleased in: 2012\n\nStarring: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Anna Hutchison, Bradley Whitford, Richard Jenkins, Amy Acker, Jodelle Ferland, and Sigourney Weaver\n\nDirected by: Drew Goddard\n\nWritten by: Joss Whedon & Drew Goddard\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: Five friends go to a remote cabin in the woods for some R&R. Meanwhile, a government office seems to be preparing for something that involves the group. And that’s pretty much all I can say without giving spoilers, just in case there are still a few horror fans who haven’t seen this.\n\nWhy I Love It: “Written by Joss Whedon” was all I needed to see to convince me to go see it. It was so much fun, so tongue-in-cheek, that’s impossible to not love it. There are so many winks to so many horror films and tropes that even after multiple viewings, there’s always something I didn’t notice ‘last time’. Just awesome.\n\nTitle: Dracula\n\nReleased in: 1992\n\nStarring: Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Sadie Frost, Cary Elwes, Richard E Grant, Tom Waits, and Monica Bellucci\n\nDirected by: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nWritten by: James V Hart\n\nBased On: Dracula by Bram Stoker\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No. The Dracula story has been told in countless films, but this film, while based on the same story as all the others, is its own film, not based on its predecessors, and is actually closer to the book than the rest.\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After seeing a photograph of a woman who resembles his long-dead wife, a centuries old vampire travels to England to find her.\n\nWhy I Love It: I don’t really think I need to explain why I love this film, hehe. The only thing that’s not perfect is Keanu Reeves’ acting :-p\n\nTitle: House on Haunted Hill\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, Ali Larter, Taye Diggs, Peter Gallagher, Chris Kattan, Bridgette Wilson, Max Perlich, and Jeffrey Combs\n\nDirected by: William Malone\n\nWritten by: Dick Beebe\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Remake of 1959’s House on Haunted Hill, directed by William Castle and starring Vincent Price.\n\n5 Second Synopsis: An eccentric millionaire offers a million dollars to one of four guests if they can survive the night in a supposedly haunted mansion, which used to be an asylum with a horrifying past.\n\nWhy I Love It: Such a fun film that doesn’t rely on jump scares to creep you out. I absolutely love this one. Strong acting, strong writing, and a superbly creepy setting make this film step ahead of a lot of others in its genre.\n\nTitle: It\n\nReleased in: 1990\n\nStarring: Tim Curry, Richard Thomas, Jonathan Brandis, Annette O’Toole, Emily Perkins, Harry Anderson, Seth Green, Dennis Christopher, and John Ritter\n\nDirected by: Tommy Lee Wallace\n\nWritten by: Tommy Lee Wallace & Stephen King\n\nBased On: It by Stephen King\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: In 1960, seven outcast kids known as ‘The Losers Club’ fight an evil child-eating demon who poses as a clown. 30 years later, they are called back to fight the same clown again. (from IMDB)\n\nWhy I Love It: I watched this when it came out,which meant I was 9 years old. Pennywise traumatized the crap out of me, and I’ve hated clowns ever since. But despite all this, I loved it, and still do. I’m not sure I’d have liked it so much had I seen it for the first time now, because it absolutely screams early 90’s, so I guess it’s a good thing I saw it way back then, hehe.\n\nTitle: Pitch Black\n\nReleased in: 2000\n\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Claudia Black, Rhiana Griffith, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, and Simon Burke\n\nDirected by: David Twohy\n\nWritten by: Jim Wheat, Ken Wheat, and David Twohy\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A cargo ship carrying a dangerous fugitive crashes on a planet that is always bright. When the sun finally goes down, though, the survivors realize that they are not alone.\n\nWhy I Love It: I can’t really explain why I love this one so much. It should have just been a generic crash-land-on-dangerous-planet thing, and yet just because all components were slightly better than usual, it made this film a total gem. At least to me, hehe.\n\nTitle: Stigmata\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Thomas Kopache, Rade Serbedzija, Enrico Colantoni, and Dick Latessa\n\nDirected by: Rupert Wainwright\n\nWritten by: Tom Lazarus & Rick Ramage\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young woman is plagued with vicious bouts of stigmata, the wounds of Jesus Christ while being crucified, after receiving a rosary from her mother from Brazil. A priest from the Vatican is sent to investigate.\n\nWhy I Love It: I’m usually not big on religious stories, but this one spends more time on the characters, and less time being preachy, and so I enjoyed it very much. The story is great, most of the acting is great, and Gabriel Byrne is a stone-cold fox. Three great reasons to love it, hehehe.\n\nTitle: Gin Gwai (The Eye)\n\nReleased in: 2002\n\nStarring: Lee Sin-Je, Lawrence Chou, Candy Lo, Yut Lai So, Edmund Chen, Chutcha Rujinanon, Sue Yuen Wang, Pierre Png, and Yin Ping Ko\n\nDirected by: The Pang Brothers\n\nWritten by: Oxide Pang, Danny Pang, and Yuet-Jan Hui\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young woman, blind from birth, gets cornea transplants, allowing her to finally see. But she soon realizes that her new eyes see much more than everyone else.\n\nWhy I Love It: Asian films are often too weird for me to enjoy, but when they get it right, they get it damn right. The acting, effects, and atmosphere are all stupendous. A definite gem, express from Hong Kong.\n\nTitle: The Woman in Black\n\nReleased in: 2012\n\nStarring: Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, Janet McTeer, Liz White, Shaun Dooley, Mary Stockley, Roger Allam, Jessica Raine, Sophie Stuckey, and Misha Handley\n\nDirected by: James Watkins\n\nWritten by: Jane Goldman\n\nBased On: The Woman in Black by Susan Hill\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Remake of 1989’s The Woman in Black, directed by Herbert Wise and starring Adrian Rawlins.\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young, widowed lawyer is sent to close the estate of an old woman who just passed away. While getting her affairs in order in her manor, he is plagued by an evil presence that brings a horrible end to some of the towns’ children.\n\nWhy I Love It: Superbly acted and creepily atmospheric, this film was a masterpiece. Young Daniel upped his game for this role, and he did a wonderful job. It’s hard to be in a film with so little dialogue and still be entertaining, but he, and the rest of the cast, managed beautifully. In my opinion, it’s one of the finest films to come out of the horror genre in the last 15 years. The only reason it’s not in the number ones is because all the films up there (save one) are long-time favourites.\n\nAnd now, for the best of the best, my very favourites, the top 10 horror films that I strongly suggest everyone see, even those people who don’t really care for horror. As usual, these aren’t in any order, it’s a 10-way tie for the number 1 slot, hehe. There’s only one recent film, one from 2002, two from 1999, and then the rest are 1994 and earlier. But, like I said in my intro, you won’t be seeing hardly any of the ‘usuals’ in this spot. My number one spot(s) is reserved for films that are actually good 😉 So, without any further ado, here are my-\n\nNUMBERS 1\n\nTitle: Fright Night\n\nReleased in: 1985\n\nStarring: Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse, Roddy McDowall, Stephen Geoffreys, Jonathan Stark, Dorothy Fielding, and Art Evans\n\nDirected by: Tom Holland\n\nWritten by: Tom Holland\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A teen becomes suspicious of his new neighbour when bodies of young women are found dumped in trash bags. He soon realizes the suave, handsome man is an evil vampire, and he tries to enlist the help of a tv vampire slayer to stop him.\n\nWhy I Love It: One of the original great horror-comedies, this film is fun, campy, and scary. The actors are perfect in their roles, especially Chris Sarandon as the evil yet seductive Jerry Dandridge. The remake, while nowhere near as good as this one, is still worth a gander.\n\nTitle: Interview with the Vampire\n\nReleased in: 1994\n\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater, Stephen Rea, Domiziana Giordano, Indra Ové, and Thandie Newton\n\nDirected by: Neil Jordan\n\nWritten by: Anne Rice\n\nBased On: Interview with a Vampire by Anne Rice\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young man who has lost his wife and baby in childbirth is offered immortality by a charming but ruthless vampire. We follow him through his centuries of life as he tells his story to a young writer.\n\nWhy I Love It: So beautiful and sumptuous. Incredibly acted and written, it follows the book quite closely (which is to be expected when it’s the author who writes the screenplay). A lot of the actors don’t look like their book counterparts, but the movie is so well done that I was able to forgive this.\n\nTitle: A Nightmare on Elm Street\n\nReleased in: 1984\n\nStarring: Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss, Nick Corri, Charles Fleischer, John Saxon, and Ronee Blakley\n\nDirected by: Wes Craven\n\nWritten by: Wes Craven\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: In the dreams of his victims, a spectral child murderer stalks the children of the members of the lynch mob that killed him. (From IMDB)\n\nWhy I Love It: This was the very first horror movie I ever saw, even before The Lost Boys, which means I was just a wee thing (only 3 or 4 years old) when I saw it. And it’s stuck with me ever since, still one of my top 10 favourites, even with the sometimes laughable acting and effects. When a movie is this good, lots of stuff can be over-looked! hehe\n\nTitle: Poltergeist\n\nReleased in: 1982\n\nStarring: Craig T Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Heather O’Rourke, Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, Martin Casella, and Zelda Rubinstein\n\nDirected by: Tobe Hooper\n\nWritten by: Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais, and Mark Victor\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young family are visited by ghosts in their home. At first the ghosts appear friendly, moving objects around the house to the amusement of everyone, then they turn nasty and start to terrorize the family before they kidnap the youngest daughter. (from IMDB)\n\nWhy I Love It: An absolute classic of the genre, it’s still one of the very best haunted house films ever made, even 32 years later.\n\nTitle: Sleepy Hollow\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Casper van Dien, Richard Griffiths, Michael Gough, Marc Pickering, Lisa Marie, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Walken\n\nDirected by: Tim Burton\n\nWritten by: Andrew Kevin Walker\n\nBased On: The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A slightly eccentric Constable is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate killings that the locals are sure were committed by a ghostly headless horseman.\n\nWhy I Love It: This is Burton and Depp at their very best, when the creative mojo was still mojoing, and they were still making terrific pictures together. The scenery is dark and brooding, the characters are all captivating, and Johnny Depp is, of course, absolutely gorgeous. Simply wonderful.\n\nTitle: The Conjuring\n\nReleased in: 2013\n\nStarring: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston, Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, Kyla Deaver, Shannon Kook, John Brotherton and Joseph Bishara\n\nDirected by: James Wan\n\nWritten by: Chad Hayes & Carey Hayes\n\nBased On: The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren by Gerald Brittle, a true story.\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: When the strange occurrences in their new home become more frequent and violent, a family of seven asks a husband and wife team of paranormal investigators to help them.\n\nWhy I Love It: The most recent film in my whole list, and yet it blew right to one of the top spots almost immediately. Everything in this film is perfect. All the actors are in excellent form, the writing and directing are phenomenal, and it’s more than just a little scary. Not many recent films have this kind of power and atmosphere. If you haven’t seen this yet, I highly reccomend that you drop everything and go watch it right now!! 😉\n\nTitle: The Lost Boys\n\nReleased in: 1987\n\nStarring: Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Keifer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Corey Feldman, Dianne Wiest, Barnard Hughes, Edward Herrmann, Jamison Newlander, Alex Winter, Billy Wirth, Brooke McCarter, Chance Michael Corbitt, Folsom the Dog, and Cody the Dog\n\nDirected by: Joel Schumacher\n\nWritten by: Jan Fischer, James Jeremias, and Jeffrey Boam\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: When brothers Sam and Michael move to a new town after their parents divorce, they quickly realize that the town is over-run by vampires. Sam gets help from self-appointed vampire slayers, but for Michael it may be too late…\n\nWhy I Love It: It was the first vampire movie I ever saw, and was the beginning of a life-long love affair with all things that go bump in the night. The story isn’t really anything new (I’m not even sure there’s any original ideas left anywhere), but the ride is so fun that it doesn’t matter. Their vampires are the ‘real’ deal; they’re strong, fast, sexy and oh so evil, just the way vamps aught to be, hehe.\n\nTitle: The Ring\n\nReleased in: 2002\n\nStarring: Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn, Shannon Cochran, and Daveigh Chase\n\nDirected by: Gore Verbinski\n\nWritten by: Ehren Kruger\n\nBased On: Ringu (Ring) by Kôji Suzuki\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: Yes\n\nOf what?: Remake of 1998’s Ringu, directed by Hideo Nakata and starring Nanako Matsushima.\n\n5 Second Synopsis: After her niece dies under mysterious circumstances, a journalist promises her sister she will investigate the death. What she finds is a cassette tape that kills you in seven days if you watch it. With the clock ticking, she must figure out what the spirit in the tape wants, or else die like everyone else who has seen it.\n\nWhy I Love It: It doesn’t happen very often that a remake is better than the original, but this happens to be one such instance. Despite the dated nature of some of the plot points (does anyone even own vhs anymore? lol), this film is still immensely watchable and creepy, even 12 years later. Everything is wonderful, acting, effects, writing, everything. Not just one of my favourite horror movies, it’s one of my favourite movies, period.\n\nTitle: The Silence of the Lambs\n\nReleased in: 1991\n\nStarring: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald, Frankie Faison, Brooke Smith, Lawrence T Wrentz, and Diane Baker\n\nDirected by: Jonathan Demme\n\nWritten by: Ted Tally\n\nBased On: The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A young FBI rookie is sent to ask the help of brilliant cannibalistic killer Dr Hannibal Lecter in catching another killer who kidnaps his victims, holds them for many days, then skins them to make a “woman suit”.\n\nWhy I Love It: I love serial killers. I’ve got this weird, morbid fascination with them. I watch a lot of true crime stuff, read true crime books, and of course, I love serial killer fiction as well. And this film, even after so much time, is still the best of the best. Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill are still two of the creepiest serial killers ever to be captured on film, and it’s still, to my knowledge, the only horror film not only to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, but to win it. And it was very much earned.\n\nTitle: The Sixth Sense\n\nReleased in: 1999\n\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams, Trevor Morgan, Mischa Barton, and Donnie Wahlberg\n\nDirected by: M Night Shyamalan\n\nWritten by: M Night Shyamalan\n\nBased On: N/A\n\nRemake/reimagining/sequel?: No\n\nOf what?: N/A\n\n5 Second Synopsis: A boy who communicates with spirits that don’t know they’re dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist. (from IMDB)\n\nWhy I Love It: I do love me a good old haunting. I remember when I saw this for the first time. I went to see it at the cinema with my cousin. And we were both so blown away by that ending, we went back to see it again right after, just to see if we could spot any mistakes that would have the twist make no sense. We couldn’t. And thankfully, unlike a lot of films with such twists, this film is so good that even knowing what’s going to happen doesn’t take any enjoyment away from the film.\n\nPHEW!! That’s it! I’m finally done!! I hope you guys really enjoy this article, it took me more than 3 weeks to complete! (Not working at it full time, obviously, but still!) I had loads of fun making it, and I hope you have as much fun reading it.\n\nThanks for coming by, and stay tuned for more! (I’ll try my best to return to a more regular posting schedule 🙂 ).\n\nM."
