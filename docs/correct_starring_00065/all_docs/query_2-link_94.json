        "text": "WWE Money in the Bank 2024 lived up to the hype and spectacle.\n\nTwo exhilarating MITB ladder matches. A failed cash-in that was wild and chaotic. Rivalries taken to another level. A WWE legend with a huge announcement. And a shocking pinfall.\n\nThe night kicked off with Drew McIntyre winning the Money in the Bank men's ladder match only to have his cash-in come crashing down on him later in the night thanks to his nemesis CM Punk; John Cena had a surprise appearance and outlined his retirement plans; a star was further established with Tiffany Stratton winning the women's Money in the Bank match; and The Bloodline showed their strength in numbers over Undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Kevin Owens.\n\nThe big winners were also the 19,858 fans at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, all of whom were treated to one of the most thrilling and consequential shows of the WWE calendar. It was the fourth straight premium live event held outside of the United States. WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus hosted the event in her hometown.\n\nThe storylines will heat up even more as WWE is full steam ahead to Summerslam in less than one month in Cleveland.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel provided live updates throughout Money in the Bank. Check out the action, including match highlights, analysis and results below:\n\nSixteen-time WWE champion John Cena made a surprise return at Money in the Bank and announced that 2025 would be his last year of wrestling.\n\nCena provided more clarity about his plans in the Money in the Bank post show.\n\nCena, who hasn't been a full-time wrestler for several years as he transitioned to TV and movies, said he worked with management to carve out a \"long list of dates\" for his farewell tour in 2025.\n\nCena said the list of shows totals around the mid-30s to 40s, which would be the most dates he's worked in WWE since at least 2019. He plans to compete for a final time at next year's Wrestlemania in Las Vegas and expects to continue wrestling select dates throughout the year.\n\n\"It’s not going to end at Wrestlemania,\" Cena said, referencing the company's biggest event in early April.\n\nCena said his business plan includes him \"remaining in the WWE family in some capacity for extended time to come\" after 2025.\n\n\"WWE is my home and I love it,\" Cena said. \"Just because I physically feel I’m at my end doesn't mean I need to distance myself from something I love. I have passion for this business. I still feel I have some wisdom locked up here that could be of some value.\"\n\nWe're all on Tiffany time now!\n\nShe has a future championship match whenever she wants one over the next year thanks to her Money in the Bank ladder match win on Saturday. But she also has her eyes on another match: a bout with WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus.\n\nStratus, the host of Money in the Bank, and Stratton had an interaction backstage near the end of the show.\n\nWas that a teaser for a future match where the future and present meets the past and one of the best of all time?\n\nCount Stratton in.\n\n\"She is one of my idols in professional wrestling,\" Stratton, 25, said. \"I am ready to get in the ring with the GOAT.\"\n\nWhile Stratus, 48, is retired from wrestling full time, it wouldn't be out of the question to see her in the ring again. Last year she returned for an extended stretch and even appeared in a match at Wrestlemania 39.\n\nDrew McIntyre has come unhinged.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Scottish Warrior's unsuccessful MITB contract cash-in of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship due to CM Punk's interference, McIntyre is taking his frustrations out on anybody in his path.\n\nHe crashed the post show outside the arena, striking a couple referees and then put his hands on RAW General Manager Adam Pearce. Former WWE superstar and current \"Smackdown\" color commentator Wade Barrett restrained McIntyre. Expect a \"fine\" and \"suspension\" coming McIntyre's way.\n\nThe WWE championship consumes McIntyre, but CM Punk is determined to get in his way every time. The bad blood that started between these two back at the Royal Rumble in January continues to escalate to new levels.\n\nDrew McIntyre wins the men's Money in the Bank ladder match\n\nSami Zayn defeats Bron Breakker to retain his Intercontinental championship\n\nDamian Priest retains his WWE World Heavyweight Championship in what became a triple threat match against Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre (McIntyre had a failed cash-in that saw CM Punk get involved).\n\nTiffany Stratton wins the women's Money in the Bank ladder match\n\nThe Bloodline (Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga and Jacob Fatu) defeats Undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Kevin Owens\n\nThe WWE's developmental brand concludes the weekend in Toronto with its big show (NXT Heatwave) on Sunday at Scotiabank Arena. NXT Heatwave begins at 6 p.m. Central time.\n\nMatch card:\n\nKarmen Petrovic and Arianna Grace vs. Jacy Jayne and Jazmyn Nyx\n\nNXT Tag Team Championship: Nathan Frazer and Axiom (champions) vs. Chase University (Andre Chase and Duke Hudson)\n\nNXT Women’s North American Championship: Kelani Jordan (champion) vs. Sol Ruca\n\nNXT North American Championship: Oba Femi (champion) vs. Wes Lee\n\nNXT Women’s Championship: Roxanne Perez (champion) vs. Lola Vice\n\nNXT Championship Fatal Four-Way: Trick Williams (champion) vs. Je’Von Evans vs. Ethan Page vs. Shawn Spears\n\nSolo Sikoa wants to be the Tribal Chief of The Bloodline in the place of Roman Reigns.\n\nSikoa just did something that Reigns didn't do a few months ago. He pinned Cody Rhodes.\n\nSiko, who has inserted himself as the leader of The Bloodline since Wrestlemania after Reigns lost to Rhodes, has vowed to bring the Undisputed WWE champion back to the family.\n\nAfter pinning the champion Rhodes in the six-man tag team match, he might just get that opportunity. Could Summerslam be that chance?\n\nSikoa delivered his Samoan Spike on Rhodes for the win. The referee being knocked out earlier in the match resulted in chaos ensuing around the ring.\n\nThe rivalry between Rhodes and the Bloodline is far from over and Sikoa's need for power will continue.\n\nIt's time for the main event!\n\nUndisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes teams with Randy Orton and Kevin Owens to take on The Bloodline, a faction that has long been a thorn in their side.\n\nSolo Sikoa, the newly self-proclaimed Tribal Chief, leads a team of Tama Tonga and Jacob Fatu, the nephew of Rikishi and the late Umaga, a newcomer in WWE.\n\nRoman Reigns, who held the WWE championship for over 3.5 years, led the Bloodline group until his loss at Wrestlemania a few months ago to Rhodes.\n\nWhile Reigns hasn't been seen since Wrestlemania, the Bloodline remains \"as dangerous as ever,\" WWE commentator Corey Graves noted during the broadcast. That's in part to the emergence of Sikoa and the additions of Tonga, Tonga Loa and Fatu to the group.\n\nExpect Reigns back in WWE later this summer. His father Sika Anoaʻi died last week. His funeral was today.\n\nIt's Tiffy Time!\n\nTiffany Stratton is the winner of the women's Money in the Bank, a match that longtime ringside commentator Michael Cole called \"one of the greatest Money in the Bank ladder matches I've witnessed.\"\n\n\"It was absolutely unbelievable,\" commentator Corey Graves added on the broadcast.\n\nStratton's meteoric rise continues as the Ms. Money in the Bank. She is the definition of a WWE superstar. And now a championship is likely in her near future.\n\nThe women have a 100% success rate on cash-ins.\n\nThis one stole the show!\n\nThe match highlighted all of the competitors' athleticism, aggression and fearlessness.\n\nAnd they did whatever it took to win the briefcase, with no regard for their bodies.\n\nEarly in the match, Tiffany Stratton delivered an Alabama Slam on Naomi onto the ladder. And that was only the beginning.\n\n\"This has been a damn car wreck,\" lead commentator Michael Cole said during the match. \"I feel sick that I’m actually enjoying this,\" Cole also said at one point.\n\nZoey Stark and Iyo Sky took it to another level with this move off the ladder onto another ladder.\n\n\"Somebody get the damn paramedics,\" Cole shouted.\n\nThe match also provided a moment of levity. And not surprisingly, the charismatic Chelsea Green was at the center of it. Her wit and humor is part of Green's charm and why the British Columbia native was a fan favorite tonight.\n\nTake a look:\n\nGreen, said to have a fear of heights, provided much more than laughs. She came for the win and would do anything to get that briefcase. She had the briefcase in her grasp atop the ladder until Stratton got ahold of her and pushed her off the ladder, sending her backwards through two tables outside the ring.\n\nIt was a crazy bump to end a match where carnage was everywhere.\n\nStratton was the last woman standing.\n\nA match of the year candidate. All the women involved gave it everything they had in a dangerous match and one for the MITB highlight reels.\n\nThe women's Money in the Bank ladder match is underway. The match features Iyo Sky, Tiffany Stratton, Chelsea Green, Naomi, Lyra Valkyria and Zoey Stark.\n\nSky is looking to become the first woman to win the MITB ladder match two years in a row. CM Punk is the only man to win the MITB briefcase in back-to-back years.\n\nWith Damian Priest retaining his title after a chaotic WWE World Championship match in Money in the Bank, the stage is now set for his next premium live event match.\n\nPriest will put his title on the line against Gunther at Summerslam next month. Gunther earned his championship opportunity after winning the King of the Ring tournament on May 25.\n\nWow.\n\nAfter a hard-hitting affair between Damian Priest and Seth Rollins in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match, Drew McIntyre entered the fray and cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase that he just won about an hour earlier.\n\nThat made it a triple threat match.\n\nIt was only the second time in WWE history that a cash-in has become a triple threat. The other was when Rollins successfully cashed in at Wrestlemania in 2015 to win his first WWE championship.\n\nMcIntyre would not have a successful cash-in. He can thank CM Punk for that.\n\nPunk, who cost McIntyre the championship last month at Clash of the Castle, did it again. Punk has been out of in-ring action since his return to WWE at the Royal Rumble in January when he injured his shoulder at the hands of McIntyre continues to be a thorn in McIntyre's side.\n\nPunk came out of nowhere as he entered the ring, taking out McIntyre in the process, getting some help from a steel chair. And for good measure, Punk hit McIntyre across the head with the world title belt.\n\nThat set up Priest to deliver his finishing move — the South of Heaven powerslam — on McIntyre for the victory.\n\nNot only did Punk cost McIntyre the championship but Rollins as well. Rollins, who is no fan of Punk's, was furious after the match that Punk got involved.\n\nAs the summer heats up the rivalry between McIntyre, Punk and now Rollins is scorching hot right now. Could we see a Triple Threat match between the three at Summerslam?\n\nSeth Rollins looks to regain the championship he lost at Wrestlemania XL on April 7, while Priest looks to continue his title reign on \"Monday Night Raw.\"\n\nHere are the stipulations for the match: If Priest loses he not only loses his title but also he must leave his faction The Judgment Day. If Rollins loses he can no longer challenge for the world title if Priest is the champion.\n\nThe matchup features the only two men in WWE history who have cashed in the MITB contract at Wrestlemania. Priest won his championship this year after he cashed in on Drew McIntyre, who defeated Rollins months earlier. Priest held the briefcase for 281 days, which is longer than any men's winner in WWE history.\n\nRollins, meanwhile, successfully cashed in his MITB contract at Wrestlemania 31 in 2015. He had the tables turned on him when Brock Lesnar cashed in his MITB briefcase on him in 2019 at Extreme Rules.\n\nJohn Cena just announced his retirement plans from the WWE. He last appeared at Wrestlemania XL in April when he made a run-in during the main event match between Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns.\n\nCena said next year's Wrestlemania from Las Vegas will be his last. He plans to compete in the 2025 Royal Rumble and Elimination Chamber in early 2025 before wrestling in Wrestlemania 41 next April.\n\nCena is 47.\n\nHe began his WWE career in 2000 and went on to have a Hall of Fame career. Cena is now a movie star as he transitioned to the entertainment world.\n\nWWE legend John Cena, whose wrestling appearances are few and far between these days, made a surprise appearance tonight at Money in the Bank.\n\nTrish Status introduced Cena to the crowd, who gave the 16-time WWE champion a thunderous ovation.\n\nBron Breakker looked like a star as he challenged for the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn.\n\nThe son of Rick Steiner and the nephew of Scott Steiner (the Steiner brothers) is clearly on an upward trajectory toward greatness with his hard-hitting style.\n\nBut that will come in due time.\n\nZayn's reign continued after he got the upper hand just as Breakker looked like he was in control and finished off Breakker with his helluva kick. Zayn, the ultimate underdog, had the biggest title defense to date.\n\nThe second match on the MITB card is the Intercontinental Championship match.\n\nZayn, who won the Intercontinental Championship over Gunther at Wrestlemania XL in early April, faces a huge challenge against Bron Breakker. Zayn's win ended Gunther's historic reign, which was the longest in WWE history.\n\nBreakker is a former NXT champion who is a newcomer to the main roster. And all Breakker has done since his arrival to RAW is break people, wreaking havoc on every opponent.\n\nHow long will Drew McIntyre hold onto his briefcase before cashing it in for a championship match? After CM Punk cost him the title at last month's Clash at the Castle premium live event in his home country it's likely McIntyre won't hold the briefcase for as long as the 2023 MITB winner did when he waited nine months.\n\nCould he cash-in tonight on either Priest or even Cody Rhodes later tonight? It's possible. Both are still in action.\n\nDrew McIntyre wins his first Money in the Bank ladder match of his future Hall of Fame career.\n\nMcIntyre climbed the ladder to win the match after throwing a ladder at Jey Uso who was inches away from grabbing the briefcase. That knocked Uso, a fan favorite, from the ladder and out of the picture and paved the way for McIntyre to climb the ladder and capture the victory.\n\nMcIntyre now can regain a championship after losing it minutes after winning the world title at Wrestlemania to Damian Priest, who used the MITB contract he won last year at the premium live event on McIntyre.\n\nAndrade provided one of the big moves of the match when he executed a sunset powerbomb flip on Carmelo Hayes onto a ladder. It removed both from the equation in the match and had fans on their feet. It was the second such high-risk move Andrade and Hayes did together involving a ladder.\n\nChad Gable also had a strong showing in the match. His suplex on LA Knight onto a ladder outside the ring prevented Knight from winning the match. That allowed Gable to climb the ladder in the ring, but Jey Uso smartly removed the ladder from below Gable. Gable then held on for dear life to the strap holding the briefcase before crashing to the mat.\n\nIt appeared Uso had the clear for the win until McIntyre entered the picture.\n\nThe men's Money in the Bank ladder match kicks things off from Scotiabank Arena. Six men are competing in the match with the goal of climbing up a ladder to retrieve a briefcase 20 feet above the ring. The briefcase gives the winner a future championship match.\n\nJey Uso comes out first and comes through the crowd with an electrifying entrance.\n\nAndrade, who returned to WWE earlier this year after spending time in rival company AEW, came out next.\n\n\"I believe this man is the dark horse in this match,\" lead commentator Michael Cole said as Andrade made his entrance.\n\nLA Knight came out to his usual big pop. He's as over as ever. Knight participated in last year's MITB match and then went on a great run over the last year, even earning a WWE championship match against Roman Reigns at WWE Crown Jewel in November 2023.\n\nChad Gable made his way to the ring next. The leader of Alpha Academy will compete in his first ladder match of his WWE career.\n\nAbout Carmelo Hayes, another participant in the match: \"I've never met a man more confident in his abilities than Carmelo Hayes.\"\n\nDrew McIntyre, the veteran in the match who will be competing in his sixth MITB match, came out focused to win his first MITB briefcase and get another opportunity at a championship. He has to be the favorite, but I have a feeling his rival CM Punk will play a role in him coming up short, possibly through a distraction.\n\nTrish Stratus, the host of Money in the Bank, welcomed the nearly 20,000 WWE fans to the premium live event at Scotiabank Arena.\n\n\"It is so good to be home and I’m so excited that I get to introduce you to the night that will change WWE forever,\" Stratus said. \"Welcome to Money in the Bank.\"\n\nShe then introduced ring announcer Samantha Irvin, who performed the Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nEdge (Wrestlemania 21)\n\nRob Van Dam (Wrestlemania 22)\n\nMr. Kennedy (Wrestlemania 23)\n\nCM Punk (Wrestlemania 24)\n\nCM Punk (Wrestlemania 25)\n\nJack Swagger (Wrestlemania 26)\n\nKane (MITB 2010)\n\nThe Miz (MITB 2010)\n\nDaniel Bryan (MITB 2011)\n\nAlberto Del Rio (MITB 2011)\n\nDolph Ziggler (MITB 2012)\n\nJohn Cena (MITB 2012)\n\nDamian Sandow (MITB 2013)\n\nRandy Orton (MITB 2013)\n\nSeth Rollins (MITB 2014)\n\nSheamus (MITB 2015)\n\nDean Ambrose (MITB 2016)\n\nCarmella (first women's MITB winner in 2017)\n\nBaron Corbin (MITB 2017)\n\nAlexa Bliss (MITB 2018)\n\nBraun Strowman (MITB 2018)\n\nBayley (MITB 2019)\n\nBrock Lesnar (MITB 2019)\n\nAsuka (MITB 2020)\n\nOtis (MITB 2020)\n\nNikki A.S.H (MITB 2021)\n\nBig E (MITB 2021)\n\nLiv Morgan (MITB 2022)\n\nAustin Theory (MITB 2022)\n\nDamian Priest (MITB 2023)\n\nIyo Sky (MITB 2023)\n\nIf you win the MITB briefcase you're guaranteed a championship match against the champion of your choosing. You have a year to \"cash it\" in.\n\nWinners of the MITB have cashed in the briefcase with an 80% success rate (19 of 24). Women have a 100% success rate (6 of 6).\n\nThe first Money in the Bank ladder match took place at Wrestlemania 21 in 2005. Edge won the inaugural match. The MITB ladder match was part of the Wrestlemania card until 2010.\n\nMoney in the Bank was introduced as its own standalone pay-per-view (now called premium live events) in July 2010 with two men's ladder matches for each of its brands (Raw and Smackdown).\n\nThe first women's Money in the Bank ladder match took place at the premium live event in 2017. Carmella won the first match.\n\nPaul Levesque, WWE's chief content officer, is in the house.\n\nHe tweeted on Saturday as he made his way to Scotiabank Arena that \"the entire landscape of WWE is about to change.\"\n\nSeth Rollins will compete in his first premium live event since he lost the WWE World Heavyweight championship to Drew McIntyre at Wrestlemania XL in early April.\n\nHe took a couple of months off and returned to Raw a few weeks ago looking to regain a title he held for nearly a year.\n\nDamian Priest, who cashed in his Money in the Bank contract that he held onto from last year's MITB on McIntyre at Wrestlemania, issued the challenge to Rollins.\n\nThe stakes are high for the match. If Priest loses he not only loses his championship, but he also then must leave The Judgment Day. If Rollins loses he can no longer challenge for the title if Priest is the champion.\n\nJey Uso will win the men's money in the bank ladder match\n\nTiffany Stratton will win the women's money in the bank ladder match\n\nBron Breakker will win the WWE Intercontinental championship over Sami Zayn\n\nDamian Priest will retain his WWE World Heavyweight championship (expect The Judgment Day to get involved)\n\nThe Bloodline will win the six-man tag team match over Undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Kevin Owens\n\nHow is Sami Zayn feeling about his WWE Intercontinental championship match against the powerhouse and seemingly unstoppable Bron Breakker?\n\nTonight is Money in the Bank!\n\nBut what will the fallout be from the event?\n\nFollowing Money in the Bank is Summerslam in less than a month.\n\nThe 37th annual Summerslam will be held on Saturday, Aug. 3, at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nGet ready for Money in the Bank with the official countdown show at 4 p.m. Central time. Hear from panelists for analysis and predictions ahead of the event.\n\nWatch it on WWE's YouTube channel or on Peacock.\n\nDate: Saturday, July 6\n\nTime: 6 p.m. Central time\n\nMoney in the Bank is a must-see event on WWE's calendar given the stakes at hand. The two MITB ladder matches headline the show with the winners earning themselves future championship opportunities. The winner is the first person to grab the MITB briefcase that is hanging high above the ring.\n\nWhile the ladder provides the means to the briefcase it also gives the wrestlers a weapon to use throughout the match that leaves competitors bruised and battered. It’s a spectacle.\n\nThe contract inside the briefcase gives the winner an automatic title match against the champion of their choosing any time, any place within a year.\n\nStream: Money in the Bank airs exclusively on Peacock in the United States and on the WWE Network everywhere else. A Peacock premium subscription is $5.99/month.\n\nWWE has taken over Toronto all weekend.\n\nBefore Money in the Bank, \"Smackdown\" took place inside Scotiabank Arena on Friday. Money in the Bank now takes center stage on Saturday before NXT's Heat Wave event closes out the weekend on Sunday at Scotiabank Arena.\n\nNXT is the WWE's development brand.\n\nToronto is in the Eastern Time Zone. The event starts at 7 p.m. EDT.\n\nWWE trending: Bayley gets a personalized Bucks jersey, has a blast on court with Bango mascot at game in Milwaukee\n\nAre tickets still available for Money in the Bank? Limited seats are available via Ticketmaster.\n\nMen’s Money in the Bank ladder match\n\nWomen's Money in the Bank ladder match\n\nWWE World Heavyweight Championship match: Damian Priest (champion) vs. Seth “Freakin” Rollins (if Priest loses he must leave The Judgment Day; if Seth Rollins loses he can no longer challenge Priest for the title.)\n\nSix-man tag team match: Undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Kevin Owens vs. The Bloodline (Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa)\n\nIntercontinental Championship match: Sami Zayn (champion) vs. Bron Breakker\n\nAndrade\n\nCarmelo Hayes\n\nChad Gable\n\nLA Knight\n\nDrew McIntyre\n\nJey Uso\n\nThe participants in the match all won qualifying matches in the weeks prior to earn their way into the ladder match at MITB. None of the six wrestlers have won the match before. Drew McIntyre has the most experience. This will be his sixth Money in the Bank ladder match. His first MITB ladder match came back in 2010 at Wrestlemania XXVI.\n\nLA Knight competed in the MITB ladder match last year.\n\nChelsea Green\n\nNaomi\n\nIyo Sky\n\nZoey Stark\n\nTiffany Stratton\n\nLyra Valkyria\n\nIyo Sky is the reigning Money in the Bank on the women's side. After winning the MITB match in 2023 she had a successful cash in a month later at WWE Summerslam to win her first women's championship.\n\nWWE legend and Hall of Famer Trish Stratus will host the show. Stratus is a Toronto native and appeared at the event's kickoff show on Friday."
