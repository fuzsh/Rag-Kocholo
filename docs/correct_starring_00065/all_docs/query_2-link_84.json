        "text": "During the summer months, you’re probably spending most of your time enjoying the lovely weather outside. Maybe you have a vacation or two planned. But there are still times when you’ll want to relax with a good TV show, like weekday nights after a long day at work or on the plane traveling to your destination. Or maybe it’s during your commutes to and from work, or while relaxing on the back deck with your outdoor TV.\n\nWherever and whenever you plan to watch, we have rounded up five great Netflix shows that are perfect to watch in the summer. Most of them are lighter, fluffier options that allow you to relax your mind while watching. But there are a couple intense options if you want something more thought-provoking to spark conversation while entertaining friends.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSupacell (2024)\n\nOne of the most talked-about shows right now, Supacell is a British superhero series created by British rapper, record producer, screenwriter, and film director Andrew Onwubolu, most commonly known by his stage name Rapman. The series flips the script on a devastating but common blood disorder, turning a group of people in South London who have a family history of sickle cell disease into superheroes. When they unexpectedly develop superpowers, they are drawn to one another with a common goal: stop a secret organization from gaining control over them.\n\nSupacell is just six episodes long, making it a quick and easy binge watch. The series has received overwhelmingly positive reviews since premiering in late June 2024. Radio Times’ Tilly Pearce calls the series “truly unique and intelligent” and praises its “cutting social commentary that simmers throughout.”\n\nStream Supacell on Netflix.\n\nThat ‘90s Show (2023-)\n\nIf you grew up in the ‘90s, you’ll appreciate That ‘90s Show, a sequel series to That ‘70s Show. It centers around Leia Forman (Callie Haverda), the teenage daughter of Eric (Topher Grace) and Donna (Laura Prepon) from the original series. When visiting her grandparents over the summer (Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp reprise their roles as Red and Kitty Forman, respectively), she meets a new group of eclectic friends who get up to their own hijinks. Yes, they spend plenty of time in the basement circled by clouds of smoke like their parents did.\n\nAlong with plenty of nostalgic ‘90s references and a long list of ‘90s guest stars (think everyone from Seth Green and Lisa Loeb to Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes), That ‘90s Show is fun for parents and teens alike. Like their parents did when watching That ‘70s Show, kids (it’s suitable for older teens) can get a glimpse into what it was like growing for their parents, pre-cell phones and social media.\n\nBack then, The Spice Girls and Blockbuster ruled the roost and flannel was all the rage. It’s a fun coming-of-age sitcom that doesn’t take itself too seriously, but is deeply entertaining, with Rupp and Smith getting just as much screentime (deservedly so) as the diverse group of kids.\n\nStream That ‘90s Show on Netflix.\n\nCobra Kai (2018-)\n\nThe story is finally coming to an end for Cobra Kai, the YouTube show that became a mega-hit once it moved to Netflix. In this 30-years-later sequel to The Karate Kid, martial arts rivals Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) find themselves at odds once again when Johnny decides to reopen his own version of Cobra Kai. Determined to prevent Johnny from sullying the art of karate for a new generation with his aggressive fighting style, Daniel opens a rival dojo and calls it Miyagi-do. The story goes from there as a new generation of kids learn how to fight while dealing with their own rivalries and coming-of-age challenges. The intense negative energy between Daniel and Johnny is a focus, too, as they handle their renewed competition and personal age crises.\n\nWith so many returning characters from the original, as well as The Karate Kid Part II, Cobra Kai is as much a nostalgic love letter to those movies as it is a fresh, new show. Flipping the script to paint Johnny as an endearing, not to mention hilarious character (was he truly the villain?), Cobra Kai is corny, but an absolute blast to watch. With the final season being released in three parts, and short episodes each season, you can easily watch up to season six, part one through the summer and be ready for part two this November.\n\nStream Cobra Kai on Netflix.\n\nSquid Game (2021-)\n\nYou have either been living under a rock for the last few years or couldn’t quite stomach Squid Game when it first came out. Either way, the South Korean series that became a massive phenomenon is worth watching for the first time or again, especially with the second season scheduled for release before the end of this year. The story centers around various individuals of lower socioeconomic class who are invited to play a deadly game for the chance to win the equivalent of about $38.6 million.\n\nThe stakes are high, but in the competitors’ eyes, they have nothing to lose. The games, played in elimination rounds, are paradoxically inspired by classic children’s playground games, from Red Light, Green Light to Marbles. Each one has a deadly twist whereby the losers are literally killed.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like light summer viewing, but Squid Game is the type of show you can leave on in the background to watch with a group while indulging on cold beers and cocktails. You can root for your favorites and analyze the show’s deeper social commentary, making for great dinner conversation. For something less devastating, check out the reality competition show based on the series, Squid Game: The Challenge, which invites real-life competitors to play some of the same and other games for a real-life cash prize (without the fatalaties).\n\nStream Squid Game on Netflix.\n\nWet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later (2017)\n\nThe 2001 film Wet Hot American Summer has become a cult classic, a satirical comedy media franchise that spawned a prequel miniseries, books, and even a role-playing game. Set in the 1980s, the original is about a fictional summer camp where the counselors and their adventures are the focus. Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later makes good on a promise from the original as the counsellors agree to meet again in a decade. Now it’s 1991, the counselors are in their 20s, and they have all taken very different paths in life.\n\nSeveral original cast members reprise their roles, including Elizabeth Banks, Janeane Garofalo, Ken Marino, Christopher Meloni, David Hyde Pierce, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon, and show creator Michael Showalter; along with many from the miniseries and some new cast members like Adam Scott (who replaces Bradley Cooper), Alyssa Milano, and Dax Shepard.\n\nAn equally ridiculous, retro follow-up to the cult classic movie, Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later is a totally goofy homage to both the 1990s and the original movie. It’s also an entertaining vehicle to show off the talents of the incredible ensemble cast, each of whom has gone on to achieve big things in the 23 years since the movie original debuted."
