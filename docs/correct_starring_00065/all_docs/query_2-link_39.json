        "text": "Well, he's STILL doing Family Guy, has done some guest spots on other shows like Bob's Burgers and American Dad and a few other things like that.\n\nI love him and think he's great. I wish he had an in-front-of-the-camera live sitcom or show he was in. Loved him in Buffy.\n\nHe's ok in a bonehead comedy setting, playing variations on himself in the same vein as Jack Black and others of that ilk. No-one is calling him a genius but he can do enough to elicit a chuckle or raise a brow. Maybe there's less call for that these days..\n\nHis lech Amish character in SEX DRIVE was the second funniest and most fucked-up element of the entire movie (behind James Marsden as the homophobe closet-case). Green is friends with Clark Duke seemingly and they have strong chemistry, not sure why they don't work together more.\n\nWhat weirds me out more than his career trajectory is that his face & voice don't age. And to those saying his voice is too distinctive; to me it sounds identical to another actor and I can't place whose...\n\nHe was on some show called \"Dads\" about two years ago. Forget which network it was on, but it was one of those shows that looked really good on paper, but fell apart in the execution. Forget who else was in it, but I do remember it was a good cast and being disappointed it was so bad.\n\nI've told this story on DL a thousand times but I'll do it again. Years ago, a married bi friend on the DL was in Orlando on business. He took out an ad on CL for a bottom. He gets an answer. They meet in the lobby. My friend says \"So, what is it you do for a living?\" and the guy says \"I'm an actor.\" And my friend says \"Oh! Would I have seen you in anything?\" And the guy gets PISSED and says \"YES!!\" It was Seth Green Anyway, they go upstairs. Seth's a total bottom and had a lot of red back hair."
