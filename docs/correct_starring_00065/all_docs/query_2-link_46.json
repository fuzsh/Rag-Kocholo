        "text": "We've been talking about this rumored project for quite a while, but as of today it's now officially confirmed. Sony Pictures announces via Entertainment Weekly that The Green Hornet has been greenlit for a summer 2010 release. Actor Seth Rogen is still writing the script with his writing partner Evan Goldberg (the two also wrote Superbad) and will also star as Britt Reid. A director still hasn't been chosen, but it looks like the project is good enough to actually become a summer blockbuster. Back in November, Rogen revealed that they hadn't settled on whether they preferred a more comedic version or not, but that \"it's not an origin story,\" instead \"it's more like a regular action movie.\"\n\nThe Green Hornet is currently set for release on June 25th, 2010, which puts it in the running against Marvel's Thor (as previously announced), which hits theaters on June 4th that year. Rogen will play Britt Reid, a millionaire publisher-turned-masked crime fighter. The Green Hornet started as a radio serial in the 1930's before being turned into a comic book, film and TV series by the 1960s. The TV show was notable for the presence of Bruce Lee as sidekick Kato, a kung fu expert with a killer car. The character was created by Fran Striker and George Trendle, who also created The Lone Ranger, another radio character that's being adaptation, too.\n\nAlthough this may not sound like the most exciting project at first glance, I encourage everyone to give it a chance! Seth Rogen won't be a bad Green Hornet and I've got a good feeling he's put together a screenplay that kicks some modern ass and delivers thrills for fans, too. You can't tell me that Superbad wasn't a great film and I think that proves that both Rogen and Goldberg are capable of bringing something very fresh and original to The Green Hornet, which is why I am actually in full support of this one. Would you rather have the same old action writers working on this or would you rather have the exhilaratingly out-of-the-ordinary Seth Rogen?"
