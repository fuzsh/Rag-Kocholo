        "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nComedy rock duo Tenacious D landed in hot water Sunday when actor-musician Jack Black led Sydney, Australia concertgoers in singing “Happy Birthday” for bandmate Kyle Gass — who blew out his candles onstage and made a wish: “Don’t miss Trump next time.”\n\nThe viral moment came mere hours after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump and captured the attention of Sen. Ralph Babet, the conservative leader of the United Australia Party in Victoria, who has since called for the rock band’s deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday,” Black wrote Tuesday on Instagram. “I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.”\n\nHe continued, “After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold. I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.”\n\nGass published an Instagram statement apologizing for making the joke.\n\n“The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake,” he wrote Tuesday. “I don’t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone.”\n\nHe continued, “What happened was a tragedy, and I’m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement. I profoundly apologize to those I’ve let down and truly regret any pain I’ve caused.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe global “Spicy Meatball Tour” kicked off in Atlanta last year and, after two legs in Europe, hit Australia on Saturday. Tenacious D, who formed in Los Angeles in 1994, had four more shows scheduled in Australia until Sunday’s joke spurred a backlash.\n\n“Tenacious D should be immediately removed from the country after wishing for the assassination of Donald Trump at their Sydney concert,” Babet wrote Monday in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“To advocate and or wish for the assassination of a President is egregious, disgusting, filthy, evil, and not acceptable in any way, shape or form,” he added. “This was not a joke, he was deadly serious when he wished for the death of the President.”\n\nBabet assumed office as the leader of his party earlier this year. The 41-year-old, who renounced his Mauritian citizenship in 2022 to remain in politics, wrote Trump a letter in 2018 wishing him the “ultimate success.” He also currently has Trump adorning the header of his X page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday afternoon when shots rang out from the roof of a nearby building. The Secret Service said in a statement shortly after that the shooter, who had yet to be identified at the time, had been “neutralized.”\n\nOne rally attendee was killed, while two others, as well as Trump’s right ear, were injured.\n\nFan footage captured Sunday showed Tenacious D fans laughing and applauding at Gass’ joke. Babet called on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles in his statement to “revoke their visas and deport them immediately.”\n\nWhile countless Trump supporters slammed the band for furthering the violent rhetoric they claim is responsible for the shooting. Fans are pointing out right-wing hypocrisy — as many joked about Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi after he was beaten in 2022.\n\n“Y’all never talk about Trump’s son mocking Pelosi’s husband when their house got attacked and he almost lost his life,” one user argued Monday on X. “I guess extremism is only allowed when it’s from the Republicans.”"
