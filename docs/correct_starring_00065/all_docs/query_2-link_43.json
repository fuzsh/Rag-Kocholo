        "text": "Mars Needs Moms is an animated film created by ImageMovers Digital and distributed by Disney. It was released on March 11th, 2011, and was the last film released by ImageMovers Digital before they closed down. It was based on a book written by Berkeley Breathed and is about a disobedient 9-year-old boy named Milo who learns the meaning of family after the Martians abduct his mother soon after he insults her and plans to kill her and use her for \"nannybots.\"\n\nThe film was a massive box office bomb (being considered the biggest animated bomb by some, and also listed as simply one of the biggest bombs in film history outright), grossing a mere $39 million against a $150 million budget,[1] and receiving negative reviews from critics.[2]\n\nThe Original Voice\n\nIn Mars Needs Moms, Milo is played by a child actor, Seth Dusky, but originally, his lines were recorded by Seth Green, who also did the motion capture for Milo in the film. His lines were originally intended to be used in the film. They were even included in one of the first trailers for the film, but, ultimately, the producers of the film thought that Green's voice was too deep and mature for Milo (who is 9 years old in the film), and cut his lines after the release of the first trailers and replaced Green's voice with Dusky's.[3] Green, however, was not upset by Disney's decision to cut his lines and said he \"hasn't been replaced.\" He even stated the film was always intended to have a child voice Milo, not Green. He commended Dusky's performance as Milo.[4]\n\nAvailability\n\nOnly a small amount of Seth Green's lines as Milo in the film, the lines included in the film's first trailer, were released during the lead up to its release. The DVD for the film does not include his lines as a special feature, and it was widely believed that all that survived of Green's lines are the ones heard in the first trailer.\n\nOn May 29th, 2020, Justin Wilton, known as Cinephile Studios, found the original Seth Green audio from the film. When ripping the film to use as clips for his 2018 review of the film using the Blu-ray release, he heard Seth Green's audio instead of Seth Dusky's. The audio was left in Wilton's files for two years until he shared the audio on Soundcloud.[5] He subsequently uploaded the full cut of the film onto the Internet Archive on May 30th, 2020.\n\nFurther research by Off The Cutting Room Floor Podcast[6] uncovered a Blu-ray.com review for the film, which mentioned the use of Green's audio in full as a part of the \"Life on Mars: The Full Motion-Capture Experience\" special feature. [7] Wilton confirmed the existence of the special feature, along with the inclusion of Green's performance.[8]\n\nGallery\n\nSee Also\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe Incredibles (found full version of McDonald's Happy Meal commercial for Pixar animated film;
