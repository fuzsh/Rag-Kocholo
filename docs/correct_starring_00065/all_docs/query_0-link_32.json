        "text": "I love performing and I love telling stories\n\nand I love making an audience feel something.\n\nAnd so whenever I pick roles, it's always in that pursuit.\n\nIf I read something that's particularly inspiring\n\nor compelling, I chase it.\n\nIf I get it, it just means that I was the right guy for it.\n\nAnd if I don't, then I just move on to the next one.\n\nHi, Vanity Fair.\n\nI'm Seth green and this is the timeline of my career.\n\n[melancholy instrumental music]\n\nWhat was the bear's name?\n\nState of Maine.\n\nMm-hmm, the bear was on his last legs.\n\n[Children] But they were the only legs he had.\n\nI got The Hotel New Hampshire by auditioning.\n\nI was eight years old and auditioned in New York City.\n\nI had been working for over a year living in Philadelphia\n\nand taking the trains back and forth\n\nto New York for auditions.\n\nThis was the first feature film that I got\n\nand I was thrilled, thrilled to get it.\n\nI actually don't remember the original audition,\n\nbut I remember the followup where my mom came into the room\n\nwith me and spoke with the director and the casting agent.\n\nAnd they told her that they wanted me to play this part.\n\nAnd when we left that room, we skipped down the stairs.\n\nIt was the most exciting thing ever.\n\nHey bro, I'm only kidding.\n\nI mean, who could beat a night of cards, chips, dips,\n\nand dorks. [laughs]\n\nI was maybe 13.\n\nI might've turned 14 while working on Can't Buy Me Love.\n\nThe reason that that particular project was so significant\n\nwas it marked a change in the way my mom tried\n\nto prepare me for auditions.\n\nWhen I went to audition for it,\n\nI had already memorized my lines and so in the waiting room,\n\nI was kinda playing around\n\nor hanging out with other kids that I knew.\n\nAnd my mom saw other kids sitting in chairs\n\ndutifully going over their sides with their parent,\n\nand she felt a little irresponsible and tried to say,\n\nWell, we should be going over our lines.\n\nAnd I was like, I'm fine.\n\nI've already done all my prep\n\nand I'm ready to go in the room.\n\nAnd so when I got that job,\n\nit changed the way my mom thought about it\n\nand she realized that we didn't have to do\n\nwhat everybody else was doing\n\njust because they were doing it.\n\nEach person's process was gonna be their own process.\n\nAnd from that point on, she kinda just let me approach\n\nthe work by my own design.\n\nSomething stinks in suburbia.\n\n[people chattering]\n\nHi.\n\nOh, that's what I was gonna say.\n\nWhatcha looking at?\n\nThis cheerleading trophy.\n\nIt's like its eyes follow you wherever you go.\n\nI like it.\n\nWell, I've really spent my whole career\n\nplaying guest stars or, you know,\n\ncoming in in a recurring way and that's a position I love.\n\nThat's something very comfortable for me.\n\nAnd so I didn't look at coming onto Buffy\n\nas something scary.\n\nIt was really exciting.\n\nIt was a great way to come into something\n\nthat was already well functioning and play a part\n\nthat seemed really organic to me.\n\nAnd to get to do things I hadn't gotten to do\n\non film very often, like play guitar or kiss a girl.\n\nBut I knew both Sarah Geller and Alyson Hannigan\n\nfrom having worked with them when we were much younger.\n\nAnd then when I got to audition for it,\n\nit was as Aly's potential boyfriend,\n\nand since we'd already worked together a bunch of times\n\nI thought, Oh, this would be great.\n\nShe's fantastic to work with and I'll bet we could play\n\na pretty convincing couple.\n\nBut actually getting to make that show\n\nover a couple of seasons\n\nand really develop that character into something,\n\nthat was a thrill.\n\nI love Oz and I'm so grateful for the chance\n\nto have got to play him.\n\nYou're trying to make your friend Xander jealous,\n\nor even the score or something,\n\nand that's on the empty side.\n\nIt seems to tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.\n\nNot really.\n\nKill the little bastard, see what I care.\n\nBut Dad, we just had a breakthrough in group.\n\nI had the group liquidated, you little shit.\n\nThey were insolent.\n\nI hate you, I hate you.\n\nI wish I was never artificially created in a lab.\n\nI was working on a play in San Diego\n\nand so I was very serious about acting\n\nwhen I got that comedy project.\n\nAnd my take on it was that Scott Evil is in a drama\n\nwhile everyone around him is in a ridiculous comedy.\n\n'Cause I'd been seeing so many angry, violent,\n\nor outrageous teenagers on things like Jerry Springer\n\nand they all seemed victim\n\nof the same kind of parental apathy.\n\nThat, to me, was very funny to explore\n\nwhen you have a character that is as bold and as silly\n\nas Dr. Evil, who is trying as sincerely as he can\n\nto form a relationship with his teenage son,\n\nthe notion of that teenage son being legitimately angry\n\nor hurt [laughs] by the lack of participation\n\nin his own upbringing,\n\nthat just struck me very funny.\n\nAnd so that was how I approached it.\n\nInstead of being a kid who's like, I hate my dad.\n\nMy dad's a dick.\n\nI just thought it was funny to come from a place\n\nof legitimate hurt or [laughs] deeply emotional pain\n\nof trying to grow up and even understand myself\n\nas a character with this malevolent dictator as a father.\n\nThe fun behind the scenes of that movie is incomparable.\n\nI have had so few experiences that are as inclusive\n\nand supportive and just fun as making Austin Powers.\n\nAnd what I found was the more serious and more committed\n\nI was to the genuine pain of Scott Evil,\n\nthe funnier any of those scenes became.\n\n'Cause none of those other characters care\n\nabout my character's feelings.\n\nThey are all just ridiculous\n\nand in pursuit of world domination through\n\nwhatever idiotic means they're enacting.\n\nAnd so from my perspective,\n\nthe more realistically I was hurt by [laughs],\n\nthe funnier any of those seeds became.\n\nWhy make trillions when we could make\n\n[dramatic instrumental music]\n\nbillions.\n\nA trillion is more than a million, numbnuts.\n\nAll right, zip it.\n\nYou can't even-\n\nZip it.\n\nZip.\n\nLook, all-\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit A.\n\nUgh.\n\n[upbeat instrumental music]\n\nYo Jana, you wanna dance?\n\nI'm allergic.\n\nAllergic?\n\nTo dancing?\n\nYeah.\n\nI grew up loving John Hughes movies,\n\nR-rated teen comedies, or PG-13 teen comedies,\n\nand when that script came up, I knew the writers personally.\n\nMy friend Breckin Meyer had originally been cast\n\nin the role that I played, Kenny Fisher.\n\nThe role was actually written for him,\n\nbut he got an opportunity to do a different movie,\n\na far more high profile drama and couldn't do it.\n\nSo I, just like everything else, had to audition\n\nfor this part.\n\nBut I wanted it so bad.\n\nI really loved this script.\n\nI loved this idea and I especially loved this character,\n\nthis incredibly insecure character who is full of bravado\n\nand outward demonstrations of his lack of fear\n\nwhile he is crippled by his worry\n\nof what other people will think of him.\n\nAnd so that's a great place to come from.\n\nAnd I just wanted to bring honesty to that.\n\nI wanted him to not just be a fool,\n\nbut a fool that you could sympathize with.\n\nAnd I wanted to justify all of his fashion choices\n\nor conversation choices, all of his intent,\n\nI wanted that to be justified under all of this deep sadness\n\nand insecurity that I think everyone feels\n\nwhen you're teenage.\n\nI liked playing underdogs\n\nand challenging the audience to like them.\n\nAnd then I love bringing a humanity to the character\n\nthat makes people feel empathy\n\nfor someone who is ridiculous.\n\nKenny Fisher gets a lot of love, and I appreciate that.\n\nWhy y'all gotta waste my flavor? Damn.\n\nI've never seen this man before in my life.\n\nPrincipal Shepherd, what are you doing here?\n\nGetting to make Can't Hardly Wait was a thrill\n\njust because I got to work with so many people\n\nwho I knew personally,\n\nand also getting to meet people who I had admired\n\nfor some time but never gotten to work with,\n\nlike Charlie Korsmo.\n\nAnd Charlie and I became a really good friends\n\nover the course of making that.\n\nHe came to L.A. to do the press junket for the movie.\n\nHe stayed with me in my apartment and we hung out all week\n\ngoing to KFC and reading all of our terrible reviews\n\nand highlighting the more severe comparisons\n\nbetween us and some kind of undesirable woodland creature.\n\nBut while Charlie and I were spending that week together,\n\nwe just got into this riff of impersonating Ted Levine's\n\ncharacter in The Silence of the Lambs, Buffalo Bill,\n\nthat character who has such a distinct voice\n\nand physical persona and such an uncomfortable presence,\n\nand we set about just applying it to comedy.\n\nLike where was Buffalo Bill working?\n\nHow did Buffalo Bill make money?\n\nIs he a telemarketer?\n\nLike, is he trying to sell you Amway?\n\nWhat is it that he does?\n\nAnd at one point we started imagining him working\n\nthe drive-through and you hearing on the squawk box,\n\n[clicks] What, what can I get you?\n\nCan I get a two-piece meal with mashed potatoes?\n\nAh, you want the two-piece, mashed potatoes.\n\nDo you want on a piece of corn for an extra 50 cents?\n\nAnd that just made us laugh all week.\n\nAnd so when I got the audition for Family Guy,\n\nI read that script and I just loved it.\n\nIt was so funny.\n\nI had never felt more seen than reading that script.\n\nAnd I just wanted that job so much.\n\nSo I went in and they showed me the character,\n\nand you know, if you look at Chris Griffin,\n\nhe's got that blonde hair and an earing and a hat\n\nand kind of looks like a surfer kid.\n\nAnd so that was the voice that I had even thought.\n\nHe was like, What's up, dad?\n\nFight, the machine, dad, meh.\n\nI did it like that and they were like,\n\nOkay, great, great, thanks.\n\nAnd I said, Hey, can I try something?\n\nAnd as an actor, I always advocate this.\n\nIf you have something, try it.\n\nIt's your audition.\n\nIf you say, Ah, I wanna start again,\n\ndo it, it's your audition.\n\nOwn that space.\n\nAnd so I took a really silly risk and said,\n\nMy buddy and I've been doing this voice all week,\n\nand I just feel like it's applicable somewhere.\n\nSo what if this kid sounded like this?\n\nAnd I did that deeply, bass-y, grotesquely,\n\ndisturbing performance but in this animated comedy dialogue.\n\nAnd they said, Oh, can you make it a little bit younger?\n\nAnd so I raised the pitch up just slightly\n\nbut kept all the same details to it.\n\nAnd then I wound up getting that job, which is bananas.\n\nThat's insane.\n\nBut they said the reason that I got it\n\nwas because I did something so different.\n\nAnd if you really think about it,\n\nthat's the same reason that I got Austin Powers.\n\nIt was just doing something that nobody else was doing\n\nthat felt sincere or appropriate.\n\nI always try and trust that instinct,\n\nand I always try and take risks\n\n'cause if you do something that they can't unsee,\n\nthen it was always meant to be you.\n\nCould you maybe talk to Marco\n\nabout him always doing my face?\n\nYou remember in the What? video I established the face.\n\nWell ever since then, every time you see Marco,\n\nhe's doing the face and it's mine.\n\nYou looked at him on TRL, Hi, Carson.\n\nYou look at them on the Kids Choice Awards,\n\nThis is ours, thanks.\n\nAnd then right here on the cover of Seventeen magazine,\n\nHi, little girl, beauty secrets.\n\nDeb and Harry who wrote and directed Can't Hardly Wait,\n\nwrote and directed Josie,\n\nand they, after the fact, approached me and Breckin\n\nand Donald Faison and Alex Martin about playing\n\nthe boy band in the movie.\n\nIt was just gonna be this cameo at the very beginning.\n\nAnd because I had spent the last, I don't know, 10 years,\n\n20 years like watching all of these boy bands evolve,\n\nyou know, New Kids on the Block or O-Town,\n\nthe archetypes were so clear that it was really funny\n\nto play this super exaggerated version\n\nof any of those characters.\n\nAnd whenever you look at those bands,\n\nwhether it's NSYNC or Backstreet Boys,\n\nin the height, in the absolute height of their absurdity,\n\nthe audience is as big as it's gonna get\n\nand they're doing things like arena tours\n\nand, you know, coming out of the rafters on cables,\n\nshooting streamer guns into an audience of 14 year olds.\n\nLike the scene that we were doing was us arriving\n\non a tarmac with like thousands of screaming fans.\n\nAnd they had gone through the effort of producing\n\nall of this physical merchandise with our faces on it\n\nin character, because that's the best way\n\nto make this seem real.\n\nThere's a thing about acting where everybody knows\n\nthat they're playing along, but when you're in the scene,\n\nyou have to really give it as if it's true\n\nor the audience doesn't receive it.\n\nI became obsessed with this idea of like laying hands\n\non people behind the barrier. [laughs]\n\nThey were walking down the row\n\nand just doing that thing that you see evangelicals do\n\nof like putting your hand on somebody forehead\n\nand then pushing 'em away like, You're healed.\n\nAnd I thought that was a really subtle way to demonstrate\n\nthe godlike certainty that my character\n\nhad come to understand. [laughs]\n\nBut I did have a moment during the filming of it.\n\nYou know, you got like 300 screaming kids\n\nthat are all extras that are wearing a shirt\n\nwith your face on it.\n\nWhen you walk down the row and like shake their hands\n\nor sign their shirt or their forehead,\n\nor whatever it is that you're doing,\n\nthere was only one guy that like, he was like, Ah,\n\nand I walked, put my hands on him.\n\nAnd I was like, You're loved, you're important.\n\nWe, in that moment, we just like connected\n\nin each other's eye\n\nand we both knew it wasn't real. [laughs]\n\nWe both just knew.\n\nMy God, this isn't real.\n\n[boy band yells]\n\nI'm gonna get an anti 770 digital decoder\n\nwith the 70 watt amps and Burr-Brown DACs.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's a big stereo.\n\nSpeakers so loud they blow women's clothes off.\n\nNow you're talking.\n\nItalian Job was far less challenging for me.\n\nI was a passenger through most of the thing.\n\nAside from having to get certified in scuba\n\nand learn how to ride a motorcycle\n\nand some basic stunt driving,\n\nI didn't have to do anything on film\n\nthat was all that new for me.\n\nI was able to speak tech jargon\n\nas if it was a natural sentence\n\n[laughs] and be a convincing guy in a van.\n\nHe's on your six.\n\nAnd so this guy was part of this elite, super cool crew.\n\nAnd yet it was me.\n\nSo what's funny about it is him getting zero respect.\n\nFrom every angle I was like, this guy should have the money\n\nto do cool stuff, but just not be able to do it well.\n\nLike he reads all the same magazines.\n\nHe can shop in the same high fashion stores\n\nwith the money that he's made from these heists,\n\nbut the jacket doesn't fit him right,\n\nor he bought this expensive bike\n\nand he doesn't know how to ride it well.\n\nAnd that to me is where the comedy comes\n\nsince you have this guy who can compete\n\nwith all of these awesome, incredibly cool people\n\nwho run with guns and spin out cars and punch a guy out.\n\nAnd the character rolls in that crew,\n\nbut is not cool like them.\n\nSo finding that balance for me was a blast.\n\nGary Gray let me run.\n\nHe wanted me to be funny anytime I could.\n\nThe best is where Jay Statham goes to get the key card\n\nfrom the cable girl,\n\nand I had just been imitating Jason\n\nand Gary thought it was really funny.\n\nHe was like, I'm just gonna film that.\n\nAnd so we shot three takes of me running their dialogue,\n\nand then they just edit them together\n\ninto whatever the most appealing bits were.\n\nSo any way to make that character more comedic,\n\nI was given an opportunity.\n\nNice to meet you, I'm Handsome Rob.\n\nAnd you are?\n\nOh, my name's Becky but it's written on my shirt.\n\nListen, I'm gonna need your shirt and your truck.\n\nPerfect, I'll give them both to you.\n\nWould you like my virginity as well?\n\nIf it's on the menu.\n\nOh, James.\n\nI'm so glad I ran into you.\n\nHere, come to my party.\n\nThe first annual King and Queen of Downtown Pageant.\n\nI'd rather suck on a urine cake.\n\nBut James, you have to come.\n\nYou're my best friend.\n\nHow could I be your best friend\n\nwhen I don't even like you?\n\nI had a meeting with Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey,\n\nwho had made the documentary about the club kids\n\nin the early '90s\n\nthat they were translating into a feature.\n\nThey told me they were interested in me playing\n\nJames St. James and sent me home with James' book,\n\nDisco Bloodbath, and with the documentary\n\nabout the club scene.\n\nAnd when I saw who James was,\n\nI was in shock that they would give me this opportunity,\n\nthat they looked at me and saw the potential\n\nto play this character.\n\nAnd I only wanted to make them never regret that choice.\n\nSo I put everything I had into giving an honest portrayal\n\nof James that was not a parody, that was not a novelty,\n\nthat was not some kind of sensationalized caricature.\n\nJames has such a unique voice and personality\n\nthat I wanted to do justice to it.\n\nHe's an incredibly impressive,\n\nincredibly talented individual.\n\nThe filmmakers had hundreds of hours\n\nof these actual people in those actual moments\n\nthat Mac and I attempted to recreate,\n\nbut we really didn't want to just imitate it,\n\nwe wanted to feel like we were being them.\n\nAnd so we watched hundreds of hours of footage\n\nand just practice letting the body movements,\n\nthe speech patterns, and the vocal tone feel organic.\n\nWe had about two years of developing the script\n\nand finding financing before we actually shot.\n\nAnd then we shot the whole thing in about 14 days.\n\nSo it was very fast,\n\nand one of the hardest things I've had to do,\n\nbut also one of the things I'm most proud of,\n\neven though so few people have seen it.\n\nYou know, Michael, if it really was self defense,\n\nthen you've got nothing to worry about.\n\nYou can...\n\nYou should just turn yourself in.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nHey, you here for that thing of Body English tonight?\n\nYeah.\n\nOh cool. Yeah, me too.\n\nIt should be fine, I brought my whole crew out.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nHey, you know know Ari Gold, my agent?\n\nNever met, big fan.\n\nHa, that's funny, dude.\n\nThat pinky bought me a house in Malibu.\n\nI had just done Italian Job with Mark Wahlberg\n\nand he was developing the show for HBO\n\nand was asking any celebrity friends that he had\n\nto come and do cameos on it.\n\nSo they brought me on for one little bit,\n\nlike pick a fight with Kevin on the roof of The Standard.\n\nAnd while I was there,\n\nDoug Ellin and I were talking about\n\nwhat was the funniest about this interaction\n\nand why Seth Green would have a problem with E?\n\nDoug was like, I'd love there to be this confusion\n\nabout whether or not you slept with E's girlfriend.\n\nI was like, Oh well, this is very funny.\n\nWe wrote this whole backstory that, to me, was very funny\n\nwhere I'd been on like youth group teen tours with Sloan,\n\nEmmanuelle Chriqui, loved her or had tried to date her,\n\nand maybe we even had some drunken something.\n\nBut now she's dating this guy who I have zero respect for.\n\nHe's dating the girl that I love deep in my heart.\n\nLike I'm gonna go out of my way to destroy this person.\n\nAnd then they just kept repeating it.\n\nLike I didn't...\n\nI don't think I realized how often,\n\neven when I didn't appear in an episode,\n\nthey were talking about Seth Green as the villain,\n\nas like the enemy of the good guys on the show.\n\nWhat I didn't anticipate was people being convinced\n\nthat this was the truth.\n\nAnd the mistake that I made was playing a character called\n\nSeth Green and not playing a character called\n\nlike Joe Smokeshow.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI think because that show was so popular,\n\nand I like to think\n\nbecause my performance was so convincing,\n\nit gave an entire generation bad information\n\nabout me behind the scenes.\n\nIt was so convincing that Matt Senreich's wife,\n\nwho had already known me for eight years, watched that show,\n\nand I'd been to their wedding,\n\nShe said, Gosh, is Seth really a jerk? [laughs]\n\nSo how's Sloan, man?\n\nShe's still good, Seth.\n\nYou're just letting him hit you, okay.\n\nYou wanna avoid that as much as possible, okay.\n\n'Cause he's hitting you really hard\n\nand there's only so much you can take\n\nbefore you actually die, all right.\n\nSo main take away?\n\nDon't get hit.\n\nOkay.\n\n[crowd chattering]\n\nHey, are we fighting like for real?\n\nI kill you.\n\nOh shit. [bell rings]\n\nBut when I set out to make Changeland,\n\nI knew a lot of things upfront.\n\nMaking a movie is incredibly complicated and very difficult,\n\nand that if I was taking it on as a director,\n\nas well as an actor, that I needed conditions to be optimal\n\nin every direction.\n\nAnd part of that is making sure\n\nthat you've got very strong producers,\n\nthat you can control as much of the environment as you can,\n\nor that you've done a ton of work in advance\n\nto make sure that your conditions are just so.\n\nAnd because of some of the places where I was choosing\n\nto shoot, on the edge of a cliff\n\nin the middle of the Indian Ocean,\n\nthat it was going to be challenging for the production\n\nto even get there, let alone shoot several takes.\n\nSo I needed actors that I could depend on\n\nwho would immediately be convincing to the audience,\n\nwould do all of their work in advance\n\nso that by the time...\n\nAnd also who had a comfort and a chemistry with me,\n\nthat we could just get it.\n\nAnd so that's what I did.\n\nI cast people that I knew were excellent,\n\ncompetent performers who were professional\n\nand did a tremendous amount of work in advance.\n\nAnd then also I know the Breckin and I\n\nhave great chemistry on camera,\n\nand so selfishly, as an actor, I wanted another actor\n\nthat I would be able to interact with\n\nbecause at the center of this movie is this friendship.\n\nAnd if you don't buy this friendship,\n\nif you don't care about these people,\n\nthen you won't care about any of the things\n\nthat they're trying to overcome.\n\nAnd I wanted to tell a real simple story about life\n\nand growing up and starting over and being scared,\n\nmaking a lot of bad decisions, but also, you know,\n\nespecially in a time where a culture of toxic masculinity\n\nis being observed and derided\n\nand hopefully addressed and improved,\n\nI wanted to show a healthy relationship between two men\n\nwho were not outward villains.\n\nI'm glad to be at a new school\n\nafter they turned my old one into a for-profit prison.\n\nHello, I'm looking for a surrogate father figure,\n\nbut I'll settle for textbooks.\n\nYeah, Robot Chicken is a strange one\n\nbecause it was not an intentional pursuit.\n\nI'd spent, you know, over 20 years as an on-camera performer\n\nand had gotten a little bored with doing chat shows.\n\nAnd so I knew that I was supposed to go on Conan\n\nand I wanted to make something.\n\nI had seen that Conan O'Brien had a action figure\n\nmade of him as a promotion.\n\nAnd I knew that I had a toy coming out from Austin Powers,\n\nand I thought, Well, maybe there's some kind of\n\nstop motion adventure that our toys could go on.\n\nAnd so I got my friend, Matt Senreich,\n\nwho at the time was the editorial director\n\nfor Wizard Publications, to help me figure out\n\nhow to make this short.\n\nAnd while we were trying to find an animation house\n\nthat would help us produce it,\n\nwe got approached by Sony, which was developing a precursor\n\nto YouTube called Screenblast.\n\nSo they got people like us and people like Fred Armisen\n\nto produce a series of shorts for the wild, wild West web.\n\nWe produced about 45 minutes\n\nand the whole thing spectacularly failed.\n\nBut I made a deal with one of the lawyers\n\nto shop the content around.\n\nWe were in the midst of making a deal with Comedy Central\n\nwhen September 11th happened, and it was about a year\n\nbefore anybody would consider making comedy.\n\nJust some coincidental timing.\n\nFamily Guy had been off the air on Fox\n\nfor a couple of years,\n\nand Seth MacFarlane called me and told me\n\nthat there was a new division of Cartoon Network,\n\nwhich I'd already pitched, called the Adult Swim,\n\nand that these guys might be worth pitching to.\n\nThey took a risk and gave us 20 quarter hours to produce.\n\nAnd at that point Matt Senreich and I had to figure out\n\nhow do we make television?\n\nWe set about just doing it,\n\nnot thinking that it was going to go more\n\nthan these 20 quarter hours,\n\nnever thinking that it was gonna go beyond that short\n\nthat I eventually brought on Conan O'Brien.\n\nWe didn't intend to make a program.\n\nWe were just kinda making something that made us laugh,\n\nsomething that was what, we thought,\n\nfor a very small audience 'cause at the time,\n\nComic-Con or pop at that level,\n\nespecially all this genre, superhero,\n\nreflective '80s nostalgia pop,\n\nlike none of that was mainstream.\n\nIt remains shocking to me that we've been doing this\n\nfor 15 years.\n\nThat's really weird.\n\nAnd the best way I can equate it to anybody is\n\nimagine you put on a play in your basement\n\nfor your grandparents, and then you won a Tony.\n\nI love making stuff.\n\nAnd so that's really what I'm gonna try and do\n\nfor the rest of my life.\n\nI intend to do this until I physically can't anymore.\n\nSo whether that's performing or directing\n\nor producing or writing,\n\nI am incredibly grateful to continue to have the opportunity\n\nto express myself and put it out there.\n\nWell thanks, Vanity Fair.\n\nThis was a lengthy journey.\n\nWe could probably all use a resoling of our shoes\n\nhaving walked through the timeline of my career\n\nup to this point.\n\nHopefully we'll be doing the same thing\n\nin another 10 or 20 years.\n\n[cheerful instrumental music]"
