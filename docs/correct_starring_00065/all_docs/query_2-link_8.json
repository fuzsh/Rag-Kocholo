        "text": "Seth Green made it cool to be a geek. Whether lending his voice to an animated character or flexing his goofball muscles on the big screen, Green was the consummate funny guy. The talented actor kept the laughs at a premium during his decades-long career, where he appeared in countless films and on several critically acclaimed television shows, where he created some of the small screen's most exciting and breakthrough sketch comedies. Teenage girls loved him as the mysterious one-time werewolf Oz in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (WB, 1997-2001; UPN, 2001-03). Adolescent boys could not get enough of the pop culture lampoons he created and often voiced in the stop-motion animated series \"Robot Chicken\" (Cartoon Network, 2005- ). And movie fans worldwide rooted for him as the bratty, whip-smart Scott Evil in Mike Myer's \"Austin Powers\" film franchise. Green was truly a prolific comedic actor who embraced his inner geek and parlayed it into a successful career in an industry that rarely took funny guys seriously."
