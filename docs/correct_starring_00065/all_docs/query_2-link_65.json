Cooper after his daring parachute escape in 1971. Films have been made, books have been written, and search parties have combed the woods of Washington State – all with little success. In fact, only $4,800 has ever been found of the original $200,000 that Cooper had when he bailed out of that plane.\n\nThis movie follows three buddies (Seth Green, Matthew Lillard, Dax Shepard) in search of the almost $200,000 that’s still missing. They had a friend named Billy who was obsessed with D.B. Cooper. I use the word “had” because Billy just died. As a tribute, the three friends decide to go canoeing in Washington to try and find the money.\n\nSince this is a comedy, things go terribly and hilariously awry. They encounter a rough part of the Columbia River and get in trouble. This situation leads to an encounter with a crazy mountain man (Burt Reynolds). Does anyone hear Dueling Banjos playing in the background? (Marty Doskins/BOP)"
