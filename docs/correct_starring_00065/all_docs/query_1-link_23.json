Take care of yourself and each other.\n\n-Jerry Springer\n\nThe much-anticipated sequel Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, starring Heather Graham with Myers, grossed a whopping $312 million worldwide. It did four times the business at the box office over the first film and was celebrated with numerous awards, including nominations for an Academy Award for Best Makeup, a Golden Globe for Best Original Song, an MTV Award for Best Movie and a Grammy for Best Soundtrack Album.\n\nBox Office: $312 Million"
