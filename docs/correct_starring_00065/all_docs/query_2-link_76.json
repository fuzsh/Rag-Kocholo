        "text": "The large collection of Yankees, Triplets and other local sports-related memorabilia that decorated the walls of Johnson City's iconic Red's Kettle Inn has been sold off.\n\nThe family-run business on CFJ Boulevard had been a fixture in the village for more than eight decades.\n\nThe place closed about a year ago after the owner - Anthony Sobiech III - was seriously injured in a vehicle crash.\n\nSobiech had hoped to resume operating the restaurant but that didn't happen. After a few weeks, he decided to sell the property.\n\nAn online auction of the Red's Kettle Inn memorabilia and collectibles was conducted recently. A representative of Manasse Auctioneers in Whitney Point said there was a strong interest in the items. The tables and restaurant equipment have not been sold and they remain inside the building.\n\nAn online post from the auction house indicated the Red's Kettle Inn property has been sold. It turns out, the site remains on the market.\n\nThe building - which housed the restaurant on the first floor and apartment on the second floor - now has an asking price of $275,000. That's been reduced from the original price of $425,000.\n\nSobiech could not be reached for comment on Monday.\n\nContact WNBF News reporter Bob Joseph: bob@wnbf.com.
