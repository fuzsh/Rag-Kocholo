        "text": "Celebrating Women's Day, try to remember at least a dozen female directors. It's probably not going to be an easy task for most of us – injustice still happening today. If you want to make a change, then a poignant but rousing feature First Cow (2019) by Kelly Reichardt might be the right start. Be...

His works like In Bruges (2008) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) were those exceptional films that I often reminisce about. When you watch hundreds of films per year, the ones that still stick in your mind always have some special...

Honestly, I was in because I've expected Nicolas Cage to follow the path of a vengeance-driven John Wick, but with a pig. Maybe some truffle pasta. However, it's a poetic and pensive...

He returns home, lies in his bed, utters \"Mother, I am stupid\", and lives the rest of his life being mute and demented. And that's the true... Continue Reading →\n\nEverything is silent. Suddenly, you hear a crescendo of drums. A scream. A whistle. One of the most memorable theme songs, created by a sound magician named Ennio Morricone, instantly makes you both on the edge of your seat and with bated breath. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il buono, il brutto, il...

According to Fritz Lang, the film was born from his first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924. Even though it was conceived as a futuristic dystopia, Metropolis... Continue Reading →\n\nYou know the story: James Stewart is George Bailey, a man who has given up everything in his life to help others, while Henry Travers is Clarence Odbody, his guardian angel, here to intervene and show him how different and sorrowful would everybody's life be if he had not been born. It became an instant... Continue Reading →\n\nThe country is ravaged by plague, and the only thing left to do is challenging Death to a chess match. What film is more appropriate in the times of a pandemic than the one depicting a strategy against death? And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space...

You are going to see people taunt a widow just because she did not remarry. You are going to see the awful reality of past times. But then you hear the first two notes. Ta-dam!... Continue Reading →"
