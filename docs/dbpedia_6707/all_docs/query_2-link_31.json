        "text": "That's a good question. I was just watching broadcast TV the other day here in LA, and was stunned when a commercial came on for a hot tub sales event at some area fairground or convention center or something... and the commercial was 4x3! No excuse for that for a modern-day event in 2020.\n\nGiven that the end of analog TV broadcasting happened in June of 2009, it's kind of amazing that 11 years later, we're still seeing any kind of new commercials done in 4x3 at all. That's an immediate turn-off to me. I don't have a problem with old shows and films being in 1.33 or 1.66, particularly if that's how they were made. But I know modern audiences (particularly those under 30) might look on images like this as being \"old-fashioned.\"\n\nNBC start having occasional color shows from 1954 on, but the switch to full-color prime time for all three networks only happened in September 1966. It was an enormous investment for TV stations, because they had to basically toss out their transmitters, all their monitors, their TV cameras, switchers, videotape recorders, and all the other technical equipment involved in telecasting and recording. A lot of stations couldn't afford it, and many continued to do local news in B&W for a year or two until they could budget for color. Some stations had no color equipment at all for making local TV shows and commercials, but could \"pass through\" color shows from their network.\n\nHistorically, several shows couldn't afford to go to color for a year; Dark Shadows was B&W on ABC until August 1967. I can remember seeing an occasional B&W commercial all the way through 1968 and even early 1969. If you watch documentary news retrospectives on CNN, it's interesting to note how for quite a few news events, only B&W footage survives from the 1966-1967 era. So it's fair to say it was a bumpy transition that didn't happen overnight. I'd say it took them three years to really go fully color from 1966-1969. And you could still buy portable B&W TVs well through the 1980s.\n\nDon't forget, it took producers and studios 3 or 4 years just to figure out how to mix all their TV shows for stereo. And that was a relatively-easy transition compared to color or HD.\n\nI read somewhere where Carl Reiner said they were prepared to do a sixth season of The Dick Van Dyke Show in color but chose to go out on a high note rather than incur the costs and problems of switching a B&W show that had been running on all cylinders for 5 years to color. Too bad as I'd like to have seen at least one season in real, living color and not the colorized eps they recently did.\n\nYeah, Rose Marie has said for years that she felt they could've gone on another 2-3 years if they had just switched to color, but Carl Reiner, Dick, and Mary all felt they needed to make the transition to feature films... which did not go too well for any of them. Rose Marie was still pretty bitter about it, decades later, but acknowledged that in 1966, not many sitcoms had gone 8-9-10 years.\n\nI heard something slightly different: that they could have gone to color in the fall of 1965 (as many other CBS sitcoms did), but Reiner knew he only wanted to one more season, so they stayed in B&W. Had it gone another season, he wouldn’t have had a choice.\n\nThat is one of those shows where I believe color would have really lengthened its syndication life, since it was a pretty sophisticated show compared to its contemporaries."
