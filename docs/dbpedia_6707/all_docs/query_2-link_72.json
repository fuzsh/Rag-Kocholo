        "text": "A mixture of 35mm prints and DCPs will be screened, with the foundation’s own expert, Foster Hirsch, on hand to introduce several films. These worthy selections show that the bitter little world of noir includes films from the UK, France, Japan, Argentina, and our own American backyard.\n\nLet’s have a look at these delectable tales of poor, unfortunate souls.\n\nNoiristas should immediately recognize the name of author Cornell Woolrich. The man whose work was the basis for Hitchcock’s “Rear Window” and Truffaut’s “The Bride Wore Black” has consistently provided source material for Noir City. There are enough Woolrich-based movies to fill an entire festival, but for now, all you’ll get is a twofer on opening night.\n\nThe Boston fest kicks off with the massively entertaining “Street of Chance” (1942), which plays like a cross between a soap opera and an episode of “The Twilight Zone.” Burgess Meredith — no stranger to Rod Serling’s classic sci-fi anthology — stars in this tale of amnesia, mistaken identity, and corruption. Meredith’s character, Frank Thompson, gets bopped over the head. When he comes to, he thinks he’s somebody else. The poor guy returns to his old apartment to find his wife had moved out years ago after he’d deserted her.\n\nHere’s where things get twisty in ways only a Woolrich work can: Turns out Frank had been previously busted upside the head, and the resulting amnesia allowed him to assume a different identity. He was a bad boy, too, falling in with some crooks who now expect him to reveal where he hid the money they scored in a robbery. The trouble is, Frank has no memories of his former life.\n\nConfused? Don’t worry. Costar Claire Trevor will help you figure it all out — on a 35mm print, no less!\n\nIf that doesn’t satiate your Woolrich jones, the second feature, “Never Open That Door,” serves up two of his stories — in Spanish! Argentine noir is always a must-see for me — it’s endlessly fascinating, beautiful, and dark. This 1952 film (original title: “No abras nunca esa puerta”) had the world-premiere of its new, FNF-backed restoration back at Noir City Oakland in January. That’s where I caught director C.H. Christensen’s suspense-filled adaptations, both of which I guarantee will stun you. The less you know, the better.\n\nPlus, this movie looks gorgeous — thanks to the cinematography of Pablo Tabernero.\n\nNext Saturday starts with 1957′s “Across the Bridge,” another tale of mistaken identity — or it is stolen identity? This adaptation of a Graham Greene story stars Oscar-winning Method actor Rod Steiger, my pick for king-of-the-studio-system scenery chewers. Steiger’s corrupt embezzler escapes to Mexico where, during a train ride, he switches identities with a man he flings off the train. Of course, this being Noir City, that new identity is nothing but trouble.\n\nThis British production is paired with a 1961 Japanese film, “Zero Focus,” a multilayered, crime-laced mystery directed by Yoshitaro Nomura. When a newlywed’s husband mysteriously disappears, she launches her own investigation after the police offer her little help. I’m sorry to say I missed this one at Noir City Oakland, so you’ll have to tell me how it is. (In Japanese, with subtitles.)\n\nFilm noir loves its day-of-the-week titles, because the movie’s disposition is all right there in the title. For example, there’s Lee Marvin’s brutal 1955 caper film “Violent Saturday,” a film the veteran tough-guy actor hated. For the top of this double bill, Noir City offers 1954′s day-of-the-week movie “Black Tuesday,” starring the equally tough Edward G. Robinson.\n\nAs gangster Canelli, Eddie G. turns in one of his meanest and most terrifying performances. He holds hostages, argues with partner Peter Graves, and gets bizzy with moll Jean Parker. Director Hugo Fregonese squeezes ample suspense and some shocking brutality into this taut, 80-minute must-see. One of Robinson’s best.\n\nFregonese also directed 1949′s “Hardly a Criminal,” an excellent Argentine noir about a bank employee who thinks he’s plotted the perfect crime. He’ll learn the hard way that perfect is often the enemy of good. (In Spanish, with subtitles.)\n\nNext Sunday kicks off with a double bill of shocking movies set in train stations. Up first is “Union Station,” one of two 1950 noir pairings of William Holden and Nancy Olson (the other is a little movie called “Sunset Boulevard.”). The Union Station in question is in Chicago, where police officers Holden and Barry Fitzgerald race to stop a kidnapping. Shot on location, with scenes in places most people would never see, like abandoned tunnels, and a streak of brutality years ahead of its time.\n\nThe villain in the 1958 Egyptian film “Cairo Station” was so controversial that director Youssef Chahine couldn’t find anyone to play him. So, he took the role himself, starring as a terrifying, murderous man who is obsessed with a lemonade vendor played by “the Arab Marilyn Monroe,” Hind Rustum. I was surprised by how nasty the film gets, considering it came out in 1958. Daring in its sexual honesty. (In Arabic with subtitles.)\n\nThe night begins with a sparkling new 35mm restoration of the 1962 Italian film “Smog.” The best way to describe it is: a cross between Scorsese’s “After Hours” and the Aussie Outback horror classic, “Wake in Fright.”\n\n“Smog” is paired with a 35mm print of director Irving Lerner’s 1959 film “City of Fear.” The city has reason to be scared: Criminal Vince Edwards (a.k.a. Dr. Ben Casey) thinks he’s stolen a massive score of heroin, but instead he’s toting around enough radioactive material to make the apocalyptic ending of “Kiss Me Deadly” look like a campfire by comparison.\n\nBy the way, if you have time on Monday, you should see “Elevator to the Gallows.” The French coined the term “film noir,” and Louis Malle shows you what a French filmmaker can do within the genre. He’s aided and abetted by the trumpet of Miles Davis, the unflappable cool of Maurice Ronet, and the fearlessness of Jeanne Moreau.\n\nFor more information, visit www.brattlefilm.org/film-series/noir-city-boston.\n\nOdie Henderson is the Boston Globe's film critic."
