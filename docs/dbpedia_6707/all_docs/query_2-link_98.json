        "text": "How Are Black and White Films Colorized?\n\nFilm colorization process explained\n\nHow do they colorize black and white movies? Well, film colorization is the process of adding color to a picture. The earliest colorization techniques were done by hand with watercolor, paint, dye, etc. By the turn of the 20th century, hand-colored photographs had become incredibly popular with the upper-class. Now that we’ve reviewed the basics behind colorization, let’s formally outline a colorization definition.\n\nCOLORIZATION DEFINITION\n\nWhat is colorization?\n\nColorization is the process through which color is added to a black-and-white or sepia photograph. Colorization began as a hand-drawn technique but slowly developed into a digital technique too. Today, photos and videos are colorized by colorization artists and historians attempting to recreate classical moments.\n\nAs the years went by, colorization became an important part of aesthetic and archival photography. This next video explores how colorization has given us a new perspective on some classic moments in history.\n\nHow Do You Colorize a Black and White Film or Photo? • Obsessive Artists Colorize Old Photos by Vox\n\nColorization artist Jordan Lloyd makes an important point in saying, “These things are not supposed to be substitutes for original documents. They sit alongside the original, but they’re not a substitute, they’re a supplement.”\n\nColorized photos make history more enveloping but they’re not original. The distinction between edited and original artifacts remains a predominant argument in the field of aesthetics.\n\nColorizing Black and White Film\n\nExplaining archival colorization\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of colorization lies in its impact on artifacts. As laymen, we sometimes feel disconnected from objects of the past; especially pictures that are scratched, stitched, or otherwise damaged. But through the process of restoration and colorization, pictures breathe with new life.\n\nFew artifacts are more impressively restored and colorized than the footage in director Peter Jackson’s film They Shall Not Grow Old. This next video looks at how Jackson and his team of colorization artists and historians renovated archival footage from World War I with stunning results.\n\nFilm Colorization Process • How Peter Jackson Brought Color to WWI\n\nI think it’s fair to say that Jackson’s work speaks for itself. They Shall Not Grow Old is one of the best supplementary pieces to a primary source in recent visual history. The colorization in the film draws us into the humanity and heartbreak of WWI like nothing we’ve seen before.\n\nTed Turner Colorized Movies\n\nColorization in Hollywood created war\n\nIn the 1970s, studios began toying with the idea of colorizing classic black-and-white films, such as Orson Welles’ best movie Citizen Kane and It’s a Wonderful Life. Why? Well, general audiences mostly loved the idea. The consensus was that black-and-white photography and cinematography were relics of the past. And that color would only increase the accessibility of old films. However, many in Hollywood disagreed.\n\nIt’s been rumored that on his deathbed, Orson Welles requested that Kane never be colorized. Welles lost that battle when Ted Turner commissioned a colorized cut of the film. The result was…unimpressive and eventually the project was scrapped. This video takes a look at a not-so-distant future where neural networks will be able to accurately colorize monochrome films.\n\nThe Future of Film Colorization by The Solomon Society\n\nThe tech needed to autonomously colorize monochrome films is nearly here. The question remains: why do we need it? Well, we certainly don’t need it. Some argue that we shouldn’t even want it. Let’s review this conversation from Siskel & Ebert from 1986 on why colorized movies can be \"vandalism.\"\n\nFilm Colorization Colorized Movies • Siskel & Ebert on Film Colorization\n\nMany critics argue that black-and-white cinematography wasn’t exclusively a matter of technical limitation. Rather it is a portal to historical context and aesthetics. The process of colorizing classic monochrome films was characterized by Siskel and Ebert as economic and artistic vandalism.\n\nColorized Movies\n\nThe death of cinematic colorization\n\nAdvocates of colorization were dealt a major blow in 1991. Anjelica Huston successfully defended her father John Huston’s film The Asphalt Jungle from being colorized by citing French copyright law. When combined with major institutional pushback for Ted Turner’s attempt at colorizing Citizen Kane, this led to the slow death of monochromatic colorization.\n\nBut today, it’s never been easier to colorize films. In the near-future, artificial intelligence will be able to colorize classic films in the public domain. Then release them on the internet, completely autonomously...which is just sad.\n\nFilms are forms of artistic expression. Classic films should be protected and restored by those who love and admire the artists who produced them. Here's how Criterion is doing such great work in restoring classic films.\n\nFilm Colorization Process • How Criterion Collection Brings Movies Back to Life\n\nThe silver lining of colorization is that nobody is forcing us to consume it. There are still great technicians, like those at Criterion, who are working to preserve our natural film history. And if you like the colorized version, that’s fine too! But please, let’s not erase the history of our beloved medium.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhat is Technicolor?\n\nTechnicolor is one area of colorization we didn’t talk about in this article. But don’t worry, we have a whole post where we discuss the technicolor process and history with examples from The Wizard of Oz, The Godfather, and more! Don’t miss our breakdown of Hollywood’s most revolutionary film colorization technique.\n\nUp Next: Technicolor Definition & History →"
