        "text": "Black-and-white films were regularly produced and released by the major Hollywood studios right up through 1966, which happened to be the last year that the Academy Award categories of Cinematography, Costume Design and Art Direction & Set Decoration had separate divisions for Color and Black-and-White. Interestingly, the 1966 winner in the black-and-white division of all three categories was the last black-and-white film nominated for Best Picture in the 1960s, WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, Mike Nichols’ film based on Edward Albee’s play and starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as a dysfunctional, bickering hard-drinking couple living on a college campus. The only other Hollywood studio releases in b&w to get Oscar nominations in any categories that year were THE FORTUNE COOKIE, SECONDS, and MISTER BUDDWING. Walter Matthau won Best Supporting Actor for THE FORTUNE COOKIE. Other b&w films nominated that year were all from Europe.\n\nIn 1967, only one Hollywood release in black-and-white, IN COLD BLOOD, was nominated for any Academy Awards, Screenplay (Adaptation) and Cinematography, in which it competed against four color films. (The winner in that category was BONNIE AND CLYDE.) I have not been able to identify any Hollywood studio productions in b&w released in 1967 except for IN COLD BLOOD (Columbia) and THE INCIDENT (20th Century Fox), making 1966 the last year Hollywood released a substantial number of black-and-white productions.\n\nForeign films and independents continued to be produced in black-and-white for a few years after 1966. Two big American indie hits in b&w in 1968 and 1969 were George Romero’s NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Robert Downey’s PUTNEY SWOPE (which had a few short color sequences). Black-and-white remained the choice of some filmmakers in England, Europe and other filmmaking countries around the world throughout the ‘60s. Japan was still making major features in b&w right up until at least 1970.\n\nInterestingly, in 1965, b&w seemed to still be going strong since three of the five Best Picture nominees were in b&w: DARLING, SHIP OF FOOLS and A THOUSAND CLOWNS. (DARLING was from England.)\n\nThis quick phase-out of black-and-white as a commonly used film stock paralleled what was going on in network television. The new TV season that began in the fall of 1966 was the first in which every network program was in color, whether they were new to the schedule, like “Star Trek” and “The Time Tunnel,” or returning favorites like “Bonanza,” “The Virginian,” “Daniel Boone,” and “The F.B.I.” Many series that were initially produced in black-and-white had switched to color by the fall of 1966, including “Gunsmoke,” “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” “Combat!,” “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,” and numerous long-running sitcoms like “Bewitched,” “Gilligan’s Island,” “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “My Three Sons.” Some long-running b&w series like “Perry Mason,” “Rawhide” and “Ben Casey” simply ended their runs in 1966 instead of switching to color.\n\nAt some point, Hollywood filmmakers returned to black-and-white as an artistic choice, depending on the subject matter or desired tone. Peter Bogdanovich made THE LAST PICTURE SHOW (1971) in black-and-white because, he asserted, the town of Archer City, Texas, where the film was shot, “looked pretty in color,” and he didn’t want the town in the film (renamed Anarene) to look pretty. Bob Fosse made LENNY (1974) in black-and-white, a film about the controversial stand-up comic Lenny Bruce whose heyday was in the 1950s and ‘60s and who had only been seen in news photos and film footage in b&w. Mel Brooks made YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1975) in black-and-white to evoke the Universal Frankenstein movies of the 1930s. This trend would continue off and on through Martin Scorsese’s RAGING BULL (1980), Steven Spielberg’s SCHINDLER’S LIST (1993) and David Fincher’s MANK (2021), among others.\n\nThe last black-and-white film to win the Best Picture Oscar during the years of Hollywood’s regular release of b&w films was Billy Wilder’s THE APARTMENT (1960). The very next Best Picture winner in b&w was Spielberg’s SCHINDLER’S LIST (1993), which happened to have a color epilogue showing the actual survivors depicted in the film visiting Schindler’s grave in Jerusalem.\n\nAfter THE APARTMENT, other black-and-white nominees for Best Picture in the 1960s, whether Hollywood-produced or not, were:\n\nSONS AND LOVERS (1960)\n\nTHE HUSTLER (1961)\n\nJUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG (1961)\n\nTHE LONGEST DAY (1962)\n\nTO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962)\n\nAMERICA, AMERICA (1963)\n\nLILIES OF THE FIELD (1963)\n\nDR. STRANGELOVE (1964)\n\nZORBA THE GREEK (1964)\n\nDARLING (1965)\n\nSHIP OF FOOLS (1965)\n\nA THOUSAND CLOWNS (1965)\n\nWHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966)\n\nThe next black-and-white nominees for Best Picture in the 20th century would be: THE LAST PICTURE SHOW (1971), LENNY (1974), ELEPHANT MAN (1980), RAGING BULL (1980), and SCHINDLER’S LIST (1993).\n\nI remember seeing b&w movies on the big screen at neighborhood theaters in my youth. Several of them were cheaply made B-movies, often from England, but I had the great good fortune to see such major releases as THE LONGEST DAY, LILIES OF THE FIELD, A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, DR. STRANGELOVE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY and HUSH…HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE in their original release, as well as reissues of 13 GHOSTS (1960), VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960), PSYCHO (1960), STALAG 17 (1953), and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962). I saw PSYCHO and STALAG 17 as a double bill when I was 11. What a great thrill it was for a budding film buff to see two major works by revered Hollywood directors, Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder, both of whom had had long careers and made many film classics and were both still actively working in Hollywood. In fact, the very last b&w feature I saw on a big screen before black-and-white was phased out by Hollywood was Wilder’s last b&w film, THE FORTUNE COOKIE (1966), starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, the very first film the two stars would make together. It was on a double bill with THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING. What a great afternoon at the movies that was.\n\nTHE FORTUNE COOKIE was the second Billy Wilder movie I’d seen in a theater after seeing STALAG 17. Also, at some point I saw THE APARTMENT on its network TV premiere but I don’t recall if that was before or after seeing THE FORTUNE COOKIE. Either way, Billy Wilder’s cynical attitude and caustic humor were a breath of fresh air in a culture of Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedies and sitcoms about witches, genies, Martians and hillbillies. In THE FORTUNE COOKIE, Walter Matthau plays a shyster lawyer who gets his brother-in-law, played by Jack Lemmon, to fake a spinal injury when he’s knocked over while performing his duties as a TV cameraman at a football game in Cleveland, all in order to launch a multi-million dollar lawsuit. The scene where Matthau “convinces” Lemmon he won’t be able to get out of his hospital bed begins one of the most suspenseful series of events I’ve ever seen in a comedy. (I’ve always felt that Wilder was an even greater master of suspense than Hitchcock.)\n\nDR. STRANGELOVE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY and HUSH…HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE were also by major Hollywood directors, all of whom I was aware of at the time, and each film expanded my cinematic horizons in exciting ways. Stanley Kubrick’s DR. STRANGELOVE (1964) satirized the Cold War and sought to mock the desperation of world leaders, mad scientists and crazed military officers facing (or encouraging) the threat of nuclear annihilation. At a time when I was also reading Mad Magazine, I began to see politics and the foibles of humanity as subjects ripe for humor. (The film’s full title is DR. STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB.)\n\nJohn Frankenheimer’s SEVEN DAYS IN MAY (1964) took a similar subject far more seriously and planted a seed of skepticism towards military and political institutions with its tale of a planned coup d’etat by army officers opposed to the president’s attempt to negotiate a disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. It raised the specter of high-level conspiracies only months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, whose death only gradually during this period began to arouse cries of “Cover-up!” by independent researchers taking issue with the government’s “lone nut” narrative and demanding an investigation into what seemed to many to have been a conspiracy by elements within the government, including the military and intelligence agencies.\n\nA year later, on a double bill with THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963), I would see a reissue of Frankenheimer’s earlier film, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962), another political thriller but one which posited a “lone nut” Korean War veteran, one Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who is activated by hypnotic suggestions planted by communist interrogators when he’d been a prisoner of the North Koreans. When he’s back home, we learn that politics and the military are not the only venerable institutions given critical scrutiny here, but an even more sacred institution is defiled when we learn the shocking identity of the handler who will trigger the “Manchurian Candidate”’s hypnotic state by uttering the words, “Why don’t you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?” The scene where Shaw, armed with a sniper’s rifle, targets a political candidate at a presidential nominating convention definitely foreshadowed the JFK assassination which occurred a year after this film was released.\n\nHUSH…HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE (1964) wasn’t the first film I’d seen by Robert Aldrich—that would be the western THE LAST SUNSET (1961), which I’d seen on a triple feature a couple of years earlier—but it was the first in which I was aware who the director was. He’d become famous for WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? (1962), which had been much talked about but I had been too young to see. For me, the big thrill of CHARLOTTE was seeing its star, Bette Davis, a Hollywood legend, on the big screen in a new movie. At that point she’d been a star for more than 30 years and it was the first chance I got to see her in anything. It also starred Olivia de Havilland from GONE WITH THE WIND and Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead from CITIZEN KANE, both of which I’d read about in film books at the library. CHARLOTTE was another dark tale, this time loaded with madness, greed, duplicity, historic guilt and family dysfunction, all set in a southern town that had never quite recovered from the Civil War. As an astute moviegoer of 11, I’d long passed the age where Disney fare would dominate my moviegoing. (I would later see Davis’s BABY JANE co-star, Joan Crawford, on the big screen in a circus thriller entitled BERSERK, 1967.)\n\nIn films like these, I could see for myself what great filmmakers could do with the medium and how black-and-white could enhance the moral themes and stylistic choices they made. Eventually, of course, in a few short years, I’d be going into Manhattan to revival theaters to see such black-and-white classics as CASABLANCA, THE MALTESE FALCON, CITIZEN KANE, THINGS TO COME, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, THE SEVEN SAMURAI and YOJIMBO, to name a few, all before I entered college.\n\nI was also grateful to see THE LONGEST DAY (1962) when it finally came to neighborhood theaters in the fall of 1963. This 20th Century Fox production by Darryl F. Zanuck offered a detailed three-hour account of the Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944, one of the most crucial and extensive campaigns of World War II, which had happened less than 20 years earlier. It had an all-star cast so I got to see John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Edmond O’Brien, Sean Connery, Richard Burton and other future favorites on the big screen. I’ve seen it many times since and have read many accounts of the battles on D-Day and THE LONGEST DAY remains my all-time favorite war movie.\n\nI was lucky to see this horror double bill when I was eleven: 13 GHOSTS and VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, both originally released in 1960. Here’s how the Deluxe Theater marketed this reissue. A week or two ahead of time, the theater gave out little handbills in different colors promising to let in free any moviegoer whose color matched the handbill posted in the cashier’s window on the day of the screening. Some “cool kids” got stacks of handbills in all the different colors and passed out one of each color to every eager young movie fan in the neighborhood. On the Saturday of the screening, the theater was mobbed—and the color of the handbill in the cashier’s window didn’t match a single handbill that any kid in the crowd had. We were all scammed! Those of us who were eager enough to see the movies and had brought 50 cents with them for the ticket price got in to see the bill. Despite being conned, we all had a good time anyway.\n\nThe theater gave out special colored cellophane glasses in cardboard frames, similar to 3-D glasses, to allow us to see the “ghosts” in 13 GHOSTS, which was directed by William Castle. An onscreen signal of some sort alerted audience members when to put the glasses on. Afterwards, we all took the glasses home and one of my sixth grade classmates later told me that she’d put them on and looked into a mirror at midnight and saw the Ringmaster ghost from the film cracking his whip. I put the glasses on late one night and looked out the window and thought the cloud formations looked rather dramatic that way, but I didn’t have the guts to look in the mirror.\n\nVILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, directed by Wolf Rilla, was a British film about a group of babies born under mysterious circumstances to all the women of child-bearing age in a remote English village who all grow up in record time to be preternaturally intelligent blond children with piercing eyes and intense psychic and telekinetic powers. It was based on a novel by John Wyndham and remains a scary and suspenseful film on repeat viewings and one of my favorite British science fiction films of the ’60s.\n\nOther black-and-white films I saw in theaters during my grade school years were these:\n\nIn the 1970s and after, I would visit revival theaters in Manhattan and catch up with even more notable American black-and-white films of the 1960s and see others for the first time on television. These included the following: Billy Wilder’s ONE, TWO, THREE (1961), Stanley Kubrick’s LOLITA (1962), John Ford’s THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962), Samuel Fuller’s SHOCK CORRIDOR (1963), Billy Wilder’s KISS ME, STUPID (1964), Sidney Lumet’s THE PAWNBROKER (1964), Sidney Lumet’s FAIL-SAFE (1964), Otto Preminger’s BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING (1965), Otto Preminger’s IN HARM’S WAY (1965), John Frankenheimer’s THE TRAIN (1965), John Frankenheimer’s SECONDS (1966) and Richard Brooks’s IN COLD BLOOD.\n\nLong live black-and-white!"
