        "text": "Bleeding during pregnancy is relatively common and does not always mean there's a problem – but it can be a dangerous sign.\n\nUrgent advice: Call your midwife or GP immediately if:\n\nyou have any bleeding from your vagina\n\nCauses of bleeding in early pregnancy\n\nImplantation bleeding\n\nIn early pregnancy, you might get some harmless light bleeding, called \"spotting\". This is when the developing embryo plants itself in the wall of your womb. This type of bleeding often happens around the time your period would have been due.\n\nCervical changes\n\nPregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, and this may sometimes cause bleeding – after sex, for example.\n\nMiscarriage or ectopic pregnancy\n\nDuring the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.\n\nIf you bleed at this stage of pregnancy and the pregnancy ends, there is no reason for you not to go on to have a successful pregnancy.\n\nTreating bleeding in early pregnancy\n\nYou may be offered a medicine called progesterone to stop bleeding in early pregnancy. This will only be recommended if you've had a scan to confirm you're pregnant and you've had a miscarriage before.\n\nYour doctor may recommend you take the medicine twice a day until you're 16 weeks pregnant.\n\nMiscarriage\n\nIf a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it's called a miscarriage. Around 1 in 5 pregnancies ends this way.\n\nMany early miscarriages (before 13 weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the baby. There can also be other causes of miscarriage, such as hormone or blood clotting problems.\n\nMost miscarriages occur during the first 12 weeks (3 months) of pregnancy and, sadly, most cannot be prevented. Other symptoms of miscarriage include:\n\ncramping and pain in your lower abdomen\n\na discharge or fluid from your vagina\n\na discharge of tissue from your vagina\n\nno longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as feeling sick\n\nIf you have bleeding or any of these symptoms, contact your midwife or GP straightaway.\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb – for example, in the fallopian tube.\n\nIt can cause bleeding and is dangerous because the fertilised egg cannot develop properly outside the womb. The egg has to be removed, which can be done through an operation or with medicines.\n\nSymptoms of an ectopic pregnancy tend to develop between 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy but can happen later.\n\nOther signs of ectopic pregnancy can include:\n\ntummy pain low down which may be on one side\n\nvaginal bleeding or a brown, watery discharge\n\npain in the tip of your shoulder\n\ndiscomfort when peeing or pooing\n\nCall 111 if you have symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nCauses of bleeding in later pregnancy\n\nCervical changes\n\nThese can lead to bleeding, particularly after sex.\n\nVaginal infections\n\nYour midwife or doctor can discuss tests and treatment with you.\n\nA 'show'\n\nThis is when the plug of mucus that has been in the cervix during pregnancy comes away, signalling that the cervix is getting ready for labour to start. It may happen a few days before contractions start or during labour itself.\n\nFind out about the signs of labour and what happens in labour and birth.\n\nPlacental abruption\n\nThis is a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the womb wall. Placental abruption usually causes stomach pain, and this may occur even if there is no bleeding.\n\nLow-lying placenta (placenta praevia)\n\nThis is when the placenta is attached in the lower part of the womb, near to or covering the cervix. Bleeding from a low-lying placenta can be very heavy, and put you and your baby at risk.\n\nYou may be advised to go into hospital for emergency treatment, and a caesarean section will usually be recommended. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website has more information on placenta praevia.\n\nVasa praevia\n\nThis is a rare condition where the baby's blood vessels run through the membranes covering the cervix.\n\nWhen your waters break, these vessels may be torn and cause vaginal bleeding. The baby can lose a life-threatening amount of blood.\n\nFinding out the cause of bleeding in pregnancy\n\nTo work out what is causing the bleeding, you may need to have a vaginal or pelvic examination, an ultrasound scan or blood tests to check your hormone levels.\n\nYour doctor will also ask you about other symptoms, such as cramp, pain and dizziness. Sometimes it might not be possible to find out what caused the bleeding.\n\nIf your symptoms are not severe and your baby is not due for a while, you'll be monitored and, in some cases, kept in hospital for observation.\n\nHow long you need to stay in hospital depends on the cause of the bleeding and how many weeks pregnant you are.\n\nBeing in hospital allows staff to keep an eye on you and your baby, so they can act quickly if there are further problems.\n\nFind out about common health problems in pregnancy"
