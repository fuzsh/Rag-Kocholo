        "text": "Shakespeare In Love depicts a fictional love affair involving playwright William Shakespeare played by Ralph Fiennes, and Viola de Lesseps played by Gwyneth Paltrow, while Shakespeare was writing Romeo and Juliet. Several characters are based on historical figures, and many of the characters allude to Shakespeare's plays.\n\nThe film ultimately won seven Oscars out of thirteen nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, including the Best Actress Award for Paltrow.\n\nWritten and directed by Jane Campion, The Piano tells the story of a mute Scottish woman Ada McGrath, played by Holly Hunter, who travels to a remote part of New Zealand with her young daughter Flora after her arranged marriage to a frontiersman Alisdair Stewart, played by Harvey Keitel.\n\nThe film won the Palme d'Or Award at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, making Campion the first female director to ever receive the accolade.\n\nWhen three former college friends are reunited by the suicide of their fourth friend, who was despondent upon learning of the marriage of her ex-husband and a much younger woman, a calling for revenge for their own ex-husbands arises when they realise how much they were taken for granted when married.\n\nWhilst filled with humour, this comedy also explores society's perception of middle-aged women's worth and desirability as they age.\n\nWATCH ON NETFLIX\n\nAfter a chance meeting on a train from Budapest, a young couple, Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke asks Céline, played by Julie Delpy, to disembark with him, saying that ten or twenty years down the road, she might not be happy with her significant other and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had ‘chosen’ another life.\n\nThe film follows the 24 hours that the couple share together and it ends the following day at the train station, as they decide not to exchange any contact information but to instead meet at the same place in six months.\n\nBefore Sunrise was the first in a trilogy — a sequel, Before Sunset, was released in 2004, and a third film, Before Midnight, was released in 2013 — and was inspired by its director Richard Linklater, who had a chance encounter with somebody called Amy Lehrhaupt in 1989. In 2013, Linklater revealed that Lehrhaupt had died in a motorcycle accident before the release of Before Sunrise.\n\nFour resilient Black inner-city women struggling financially feel forced to strategise a heist and take on the system that failed them. After deciding to rob banks, they rally together and learn to trust and rely on each other, but when things soon take a turn for the worst, it becomes a matter of life or death. At the core of the story is female companionship in the fight against racial injustice.\n\nAdapted from Terry McMillan's best-selling 1996 novel, this domestic classic sees a high-powered 40-something analyst and single mother fall for a charming man while on holiday in Jamaica. She must confront everything she knows about love, and more crucially, save her own life - through thick and thin.\n\nStarring Angela Bassett, Whoopi Goldberg and Regina King, it's a heartwarming take on one woman's commitment to reclaiming her life.\n\nWhen young LA S.W.A.T officer Jack Traven angers retired Atlanta police department bomb squad member Howard Payne, by subsiding his attempts of taking hostages stuck in a lift with a bomb, the latter arms a bus with a bomb that will explode if it drops below 50 mph.\n\nWill Jack, with the help of the passengers, be able to figure out a plan to stop the bomb going off before the bus runs out of gas? This classic 1990s thriller will have you at the edge of your seat, trust us.\n\nSpike Lee's film about Black rights activist Malcolm X (played by Denzel Washington) - who fought for racial equality and promoted Black empowerment until his assassination in 1965 - is educational, informative, heartbreaking and necessarily long. Lee examines Malcolm's life with nuance, taking us through various stages of his life including the racism he experienced as a child, the killing of his father by white supremacists, his time in prison, relationship with Martin Luther King, marriage, departure from the Nation Of Islam and how some of his views altered over time. A must watch.\n\nA recently post-NWA Ice Cube joined forces with Cuba Gooding Jnr, Laurence Fishburne, Regina King and Angela Bassett for a film as relevant now as it was when it burst onto the scene in the early 1990s.\n\nMade by a 22-year-old filmmaker about three Black teenagers growing up amongst gang violence in South Central, Los Angeles, the film brought a too often hidden story into the mainstream. John Singleton became the youngest ever, and the first Black man, to be nominated for a Best Director Oscar with this directorial debut."
