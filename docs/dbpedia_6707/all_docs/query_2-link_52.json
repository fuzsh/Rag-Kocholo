If you click on a link and make a purchase, Shoot It With Film may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.\n\nWritten by David Rose\n\nThe world is never black and white. Except when you’re shooting monochromatic film, then it very much is.\n\nI’ve been on a mission this year to shoot as many black and white film stocks as possible, with the ultimate goal of shooting every B&W film currently purchasable on the market…\n\nHowever, what I didn’t realize when starting this project is that there are over one hundred B&W films currently in production, so it’s safe to say that this has turned into a multi-year endeavor.\n\nIn the meantime, I wanted to share an overview of some of the Ilford films I’ve shot thus far, and compare and contrast them with example images so you are able to choose the best Ilford black and white film to match your specific shooting style and preferences.\n\nIn this Ilford film comparison, you’ll be able to how each of the Ilford films stack up against one another. Ilford FP4 vs HP5 vs XP2 and more.\n\nComparing Ilford Film Stocks\n\nHere are the B&W films we will be comparing in this article:\n\nIlford Delta (100, 400, 3200) (find on Amazon)\n\nIlford FP4 Plus (find on Amazon)\n\nIlford HP5 Plus (find on Amazon)\n\nIlford Pan F Plus (find on Amazon)\n\nIlford XP2 Super (find on Amazon)\n\nQuick rundown on Ilford black and white films, most of their current offerings are bisected into two distinct lines – PLUS and DELTA PROFESSIONAL.\n\nAccording to Ilford, the main difference between the two is that DELTA PROFESSIONAL films use a newer emulsion. This gives them the advantage of a lower grain-to-speed ratio (marginally cleaner, sharper look).\n\nWhereas the PLUS films use their classic emulsion technology, which has more exposure latitude than DELTA films (making them better for push and pull processing and less sensitive to over processing, which is ideal for learning film photography).\n\nTo sum this up:\n\nDELTA PROFESSIONAL = less grain at equivalent speeds, cleaner and sharper look\n\nPLUS = more grain, better for pushing/pulling, more forgiving for over-processing.\n\nNote: All example pictures are shown as originally scanned with no post-processing whatsoever for greater objectivity in comparison.\n\nFind me on Instagram if you’d like to see additional example shots or if you have comments or questions!\n\nAnd if you’re interested in an overview of color film stocks, check out my article: Guide To Choosing A Color Film.\n\nIlford Delta Professional (100, 400, 3200)\n\nThere are three different types of Delta films in the lineup from Ilford: Delta 100, Delta 400, and Delta 3200.\n\nAs with other films that offer the same base with varying ISO levels (Kodak Portra films are a good example), the higher the ISO number, the lower the contrast and the greater the film grain.\n\nIlford Delta 100:\n\nStarting with Ilford Delta 100, you’ll get amazingly clear images with almost no visible grain.\n\nI love the deep contrast and fine details this film provides, even if you must sacrifice some light sensitivity with it being a slower film…\n\nSpeaking of which, this is also a great film for shooting in bright daylight conditions since you can shoot wide open for some serious bokeh and subject isolation (i.e. the “3D pop”).\n\nIlford Delta 100 Examples:\n\nIlford Delta 400:\n\nIlford Delta 400 is an amazingly fine grain and versatile film.\n\nI’ve mainly shot this film at box speed (setting my light meter to ISO 400), but as you can see from the examples below, this results in a lot of mid tones, which may or may not be your thing.\n\nPersonally, I prefer more contrast and grain, so pushing this film a stop or two may be a good choice if you feel the same way.\n\nYou can read more about shooting and pushing Ilford Delta 400 here.\n\nIlford Delta 400 Examples:\n\nIlford Delta 3200:\n\nIlford Delta 3200 is a forgiving film that is both hungry for light and handles overexposure like a champ.\n\nAs the name implies, it can be shot rated at 3200 ISO (which is how I was able to capture an image of the NEOWISE Comet below without star trails). But most of the time, it’s better suited to be shot at ~1000 ISO.\n\nIt’s speed makes it ideal for low light photography or capturing fast moving subjects.\n\nIlford Delta 3200 Examples:\n\nIlford FP4 Plus\n\nIlford FP4 Plus is a good all-purpose film that performs best in good lighting conditions.\n\nThe original FP4 was launched in the 1960s, so it has definitely stood the test of time. It has since been updated in the 90s to the new and improved FP4 Plus.\n\nPersonally, I prefer using FP4 as a general purpose daily-shooter type of film.\n\nHere’s a more detailed review of Ilford FP4.\n\nIlford FP4 Examples:\n\nIlford HP5 Plus\n\nIf you’re looking for a film stock that takes a lickin’ but keeps on tickin’, then look no further…\n\nIlford HP5 Plus has been one of the most popular Ilford films for a while. And for good reason – it has medium contrast, a wide exposure latitude, and is perfectly suited for action or documentary style photography.\n\nHP5 was originally introduced in the 70s, and upgraded to HP5 plus in the late 80s. It is seen by many as Ilford’s response to Kodak’s legendary Tri-X 400.\n\nIt is also incredible versatile in how it can be shot and developed. Here are a few examples of the different ways you can rate, push, and develop Ilford HP5.\n\nIlford HP5 Examples:\n\nIlford Pan F Plus\n\nI’m seriously impressed with the results I’ve gotten from Ilford Pan F Plus so far.\n\nThis is a notably slower speed film (ISO 50), but the way it renders landscapes with exceptional tones and details is second to none.\n\nIt boasts exceptionally fine grain, outstanding resolution and sharpness, and is best suited for bright conditions and sunny days.\n\nRead more about Ilford Pan F here.\n\nIlford Pan F Plus Examples:\n\nIlford XP2 Super\n\nIlford XP2 is a rather unique B&W film since it doesn’t fall into either the PLUS or DELTA PROFESSIONAL camps.\n\nThis film is developed using C-41 chemistry, which is normally used for color films. Also, you can actually shoot it at any speed between ISO 50-800.\n\nIt’s one of my favorites since, not only are the tones and aesthetics great, but it’s also the cheaper option for shooting black and white since most labs can batch develop for color film chemistry, which cuts down on costs.\n\nIlford XP2 Examples:\n\nIlford Specialty Films\n\nThat about wraps things up for the comparison of the “standard” film offerings from Ilford, but there are also some additional specialty films such as Ilford SFX 200 and Ilford Ortho Plus 80.\n\nIlford SFX 200 has extended red sensitivity that can produce infra-red style images, and Ortho Plus 80 is an Orthochromatic film that’s blue and green sensitive but not red.\n\nYou can read a detailed review of Ortho Plus 80 here.\n\nThese are next on my list to try out!\n\nThank you so much, David!
