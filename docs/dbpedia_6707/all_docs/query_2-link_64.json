        "text": "My personal favorite black and white film for 120 is Delta 3200. That might sound like a weird selection, but I love it because I like shooting low-light and window-lit portraits which this film is ideal for it. It’s medium contrast and has beautiful grain, especially in 120. It’s a really versatile film if you like shooting in lower light.\n\nWhen it comes to my second favorite black and white film for 120, it’s a toss-up. There are a lot of film stocks that I like and I often shoot with HP5 and Tri-X, however, my favorite fine grain black and white film for 120, is easily the TMAX 100, which has the finest grain I have ever seen of any black and white.\n\nWe would love to hear what your favorites are.\n\nRelated:"
