        "text": "We could be here all day listing numerous films that cinephiles should see that were shot in black and white. In fact, they used to split the Oscar for Best Cinematography between black and white and color between the '30s and '60s. That's how distinct and important it was to chronicle and reward black and white photography — nothing quite beats the use of shadows in \"The Third Man,\" \"Double Indemnity,\" \"Sunset Boulevard\" or \"The Maltese Falcon.\"\n\nIn an effort to not make this list super obvious (\"Casablanca\") or too long (we could fit \"Raging Bull\" into a sports category), we'll try and keep it to actual hidden gems you may not have seen, unless you went to film school — or know someone who did. Give these movies a shot (pun intended), and let us know your favorites, or any we missed.\n\nNoir: 'Kiss Me Deadly' (1955)\n\nThis is the noir to end all noirs. The atomic age of the '50s built up a lot of tension and dread with the American public, and nothing manifests those fears quite like \"Kiss Me Deadly,\" a typical noir that includes a box that could destroy the world. Much like \"Godzilla\" was Japan's response to the end of WWII and the dropping of the A-Bomb, \"Kiss Me Deadly\" is the film that best exemplifies America's fumbling of human lives and the costs of greed.\n\nWatch on Roku.\n\nRomance: 'Brief Encounter' (1945)\n\nDirector David Lean's masterpiece is \"Brief Encounter\" — the story of a chance encounter that leads to a romance that can't ever exist. It might make you cry, if you ever cared about someone who had to leave you, or if you ever tried to jump in front of a train because you were so heartbroken. We've all been there.\n\nWatch on Amazon.\n\nCrime/Action: 'Sin City' (2005)\n\nSo, most of the greatest movies in the history of film are black and white. Most of those are not action movies, which makes it very hard to put a list like this together. So while Frank Miller's graphic novel adaptation of \"Sin City\" is something you've probably heard of, and maybe have seen, it does fulfill the requirements of this list — and is a good movie. So I could feel guilty including it, but I choose not to.\n\nWatch on Max.\n\nThriller/Horror: 'Shock Corridor' (1963)\n\nThis is one of the most audacious, outrageous and, yes, shocking movies ever made. Now imagine people in the sixties watching this. A journalist trying to win a Pulitzer enters himself into a psychiatric hospital to cover a story and things go very wrong for him, very quickly. He gets trapped in there, and has to get out at all costs. Director Sam Fuller is a genius.\n\nWatch on Criterion Channel.\n\nComedy: 'The Rules of the Game' (1939)\n\nThought we were going to go with \"Dr. Strangelove\" here, didn't you? No, we're opting for one of the other greatest film ever made, one that came out in 1939, but looks like it was made 20 years in the future. That's how ahead of everybody else director Jean Renoir was when he made \"The Rules of the Game,\" the French version of \"The Great Gatsby.\" This is a part of film history, and quite short if that helps you any.\n\nWatch on Roku/Kanopy.\n\nDrama: 'The Man Who Wasn't There' (2001)\n\nThe Coen Brothers are so well covered, and written about to death, it's seemingly impossible for any of their movies to fly under the radar. But that's exactly what this black-and-white dreamy drama does, as it doesn't stand out in any real way (besides the cinematography from the god himself, Roger Deakins). But it came out right after \"The Big Lebowski\" and \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" so most people just don't remember it. But this is a really good Coen brothers joint!\n\nRent it on Amazon.\n\nAnimated: 'Mary and Max' (2009)\n\nOkay, this isn't actually completely in black-and-white, but neither was \"Shock Corridor,\" so give us a pass on this one, there simply aren't many good examples of purely black and white animation out there. But it's close enough! So I'm going to count it — don't post in the comments.\n\nThis is a beautiful Australian film about two unlikely friends in New York City, and it's sad, touching and delightful. Claymation should only be used for the absolute most creative, weird and interesting (and in this case, Yiddish) stories.\n\nIt's on YouTube and Tubi for free.\n\nIf you enjoyed this list, we have more, like a pick of elevated horror films, or animated movies for adults you haven't seen."
