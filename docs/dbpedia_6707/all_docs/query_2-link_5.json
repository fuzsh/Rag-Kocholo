        "text": "If you include early hand colored scenes, then it might be 1916 Joan the Woman.\n\nBlack and white silent feature with colored scenes (burning at the stake)\n\nThis was the first film to use the Handschiegl Color Process (billed as the \"Wyckoff-DeMille Process\") for certain scenes. This process is especially noticeable in the scene of Joan burning at the stake, the use of red and yellow gave this a heightened dramatic effect.\n\nThe process was invented for this feature and was used for further features through into the 1920s.\n\n(With technicolor's second full-length color feature release in 1922, that color film process became very popular and the number of technicolor inserts or parts in black and white features increased dramatically after this, replacing the hand-colored processes)\n\nThe question is problematic because due to the laborious nature of early colourization processes and that of filming in color being in its infancy, filming in black and white, with colored parts or inserts, was actually incredibly common throughout the late teens, 1920s and 1930s. It's considered unusual today but at one point in early cinema, also coinciding with the introduction of other new technology like talkies, it was incredibly common.\n\nHave a look at these for example:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_color_feature_films\n\nWith this list, you might note the earliest (hand) colored scenes are listed for The Passion Play (Vie et Passion du Christ), released in 1903; but I had not included this as it was never released as a single feature, only as a series of shorts.\n\nhttps://moviessilently.com/2015/10/24/silent-movies-101-color-before-sound-and-why-colorization-is-not-always-a-bad-thing/\n\nIn his book Silent Cinema: An Introduction, Paolo Cherchi Usai writes that about 85% of silent films featured at least some color tinting and toning. Tinted footage could be achieved by either using a chemical process after the scene was shot or by using pre-dyed film stock.\n\nThe worlds longest narrative film at the time of its release, the Australian 1906 feature, The Story of the Kelly Gang, contains a red tinted sequence for a house fire scene. This was not listed as a feature with color, however.\n\nEven if one only counts scenes which were filmed in color, feature films which included a few color scenes but were otherwise filmed in black and white were common long before full-color feature films. Examples of such films from the mid 1920s include Phantom of the Opera, Ben Hur, King of Kings, all of which feature a few minutes of two-strip technicolor.\n\nTrying to date hand-colored films may be more difficult, since many films have been hand colored years or decades after they were shot, and many hand-colored prints of films have been lost to the ages. If the oldest hand-colored copies of a 1904 film that are known to exist date from the 1980s, and it's believed some copies of the film would have been colored in 1904 but there is no surviving record of what they looked like, should that be considered a hand-colored film from 1904, or from the 1980s?"
