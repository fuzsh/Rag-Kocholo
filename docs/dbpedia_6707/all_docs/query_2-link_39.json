        "text": "When Ben Wheatley was preparing to make A Field in England, his mind-altering foray into the English civil war, released 5 July , he took a lot of test shots to help him determine how the film should look. Some of the shots were in colour, others were in black and white, and Wheatley recalls being struck by the disparity between the two. With the colour shots, he says, \"it was all about the colour of a character's clothes and the grass and the sky. It was really distracting. Whereas in black and white, it was all about his face and his hair and the lace and the texture of the grass. That's what drew us to it.\"\n\nWheatley, who rose to prominence with Kill List and Sightseers, isn't the only high-profile director to be seduced by monochrome this year. A couple of weeks ago, Joss Whedon followed up his superhero extravaganza Avengers Assemble, the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, with a low-budget adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing, shot over 12 days with a cast of little-known actors at his home in Santa Monica. The film is in black and white, as are Noah Baumbach's delightful Frances Ha, out on 26 July, and Alexander Payne's Nebraska, which was warmly received at Cannes in May and is released later this year.\n\nIt's unusual to have so many new black-and-white films cropping up at the same time; according to Variety, moviegoers are having more exposure to the format in a two-year span than during any other comparable time-frame in recent history. The big success story here is clearly The Artist, though let's not forget about Miguel Gomes's Tabu, Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and Pablo Berger's Blancanieves (also out next month). In spite of this trend, however, making movies in black and white is still perceived as a commercial risk. When Alexander Payne, the Oscar-winning writer-director of Sideways and The Descendants, announced his intentions for Nebraska, the studio tried to change his mind. The trade-off, when he stood his ground, was a reduced budget.\n\nWhat is it about black and white that appeals to contemporary film-makers, in spite of the obstacles it throws up? \"It's such a beautiful form,\" enthused Payne at Cannes last month, \"and it left our cinema because of commercial, not artistic reasons.\" Speaking about Nebraska, in which a father and son go on a road trip together across the American midwest, he said: \"This modest, austere story seemed to lend itself to being shot in black and white – a visual style as austere as the lives of the people in the film.\"\n\nAccording to Geoff Andrew, head of film programme at the BFI, black and white is often used in contemporary cinema to deal with the past or to express nostalgia in some form. \"Nebraska isn't actually set in the past,\" he says, \"but it's very much about the past. As we come to know the Bruce Dern character in the film, we find out what he used to be like, and we glimpse an American way of life that has since vanished. It's a very nostalgic film.\"\n\nFrances Ha, by contrast, is about a young woman in modern-day New York puzzling over her future. Although its protagonist, played by Greta Gerwig, is struggling to move forward in life, the film is clearly looking back to French new wave directors, particularly François Truffaut, and to black-and-white classics such as Woody Allen's Manhattan, itself a homage to an earlier era of film-making. According to Baumbach, \"There was something about black and white that makes the movie almost immediately nostalgic\".\n\nJoss Whedon, meanwhile, used the format to enrich the tone of his Shakespeare adaptation, which he describes as a noir comedy. \"I wanted to give this movie some of that old Hollywood glamour,\" he said recently, \"and I think we would have had more of a challenge if it wasn't in black and white.\"\n\nThe venerable format also offers more practical advantages. All four films were shot in colour, digitally, and converted to black and white in post-production. When Ben Wheatley was making A Field in England, he took pains to ensure that they never saw any of the footage in colour, on set or during the edit. \"One thing we realised with black and white is that you have a lot more latitude for shooting outdoors and matching shots together than you have in colour. Obviously the English weather's terrible: the sun's in and out like nobody's business. If you have an overcast shot cut against a high-contrast shot in colour, you wouldn't get away with it at all, but black and white covers a lot of it up.\"\n\nAs well as giving Joss Whedon room to manoeuvre in outdoor scenes, the format saved him from having to repaint his house – he felt the walls at home were too bright to be filmed in colour. On a broader level, it's a relief that Much Ado About Nothing was made in black and white. With its glossy Californian location and handsome TV actors, it could have ended up looking less like a Shakespeare adaptation with echoes of classic Hollywood and more like a daytime soap.\n\nIt's hard to imagine any of these films working better in colour. Whatever the studio said to the contrary, the way Nebraska looks is a perfect match for the story it tells. What's striking about the extended hallucinatory episode towards the end of A Field in England is that the absence of colour seems to heighten its psychedelic effect rather than muting it. Sam Levy's luminous cinematography makes Frances Ha one of the most beautiful New York films in years, but the real surprise is how fresh it feels despite the supposedly antiquated format.\n\nWhile it would be premature to herald a major comeback for black and white, it's heartening to see more directors fighting to make it part of the contemporary palette. For critic and film-maker Mark Cousins, the format connects us with the most exalted days of the movies. \"Cinema became an art in black and white,\" he reminds me, \"and its gods were Orson Welles, Charlie Chaplin, Yasujiro Ozu, Carl Theodor Dreyer. To shoot in black and white, even today, still feels, for many film-makers, like being among the gods.\"\n\nLIFE IN MONOCHROME: New films in black and white\n\nReading this on mobile?

Set in modern-day New York and lit by cinematographer Sam Levy in shadowy monochrome, the comedy follows a 27-year-old dancer (Gerwig) as she apartment-hops between boroughs and struggles to adapt to upheavals in her life. Baumbach wrote it with Gerwig and, working on a lower-than-usual budget, he shot the film guerrilla-style on the streets of New York using an inconspicuous DSLR camera. \"Working in black and white allowed me to see the city with new eyes,\" Baumbach said.\n\nA FIELD IN ENGLAND\n\nDir: Ben Wheatley\n\nOver the past two years, with Kill List and Sightseers, Ben Wheatley has emerged as one of Britain's most promising young film-makers. Before he moved on to larger-scale projects, however, Wheatley decided to pare everything back and direct this freaky, hallucinatory movie, set during the English civil war, on a tiny budget with a cast of seven. Putting the resulting creative freedom to good use, Wheatley chose to shoot the film in black and white. \"If you're making Iron Man 3, the commercial considerations would be massive,\" he tells me, \"but when you're making a film about the English civil war, it doesn't really matter. Nobody was trying to talk me out of it.\" In the film, a group of battle-weary men, including Kill List star Michael Smiley and a cowardly alchemist's assistant played by Reece Shearsmith, search for treasure in a muddy English field. The action builds towards a crescendo that will leave heads spinning.\n\nReading this on mobile?

He shot this adaptation of the Shakespeare comedy in 12 days at his house in Los Angeles, using a cast of regulars from his TV shows (Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and paying for it out of his own pocket. Although the play is updated to the present, Whedon describes the film as a \"noir comedy\" and his decision to make it in black and white is, in part, a nod to the great screwball comedies of the 1930s and 40s. Currently on general release in the UK, the film was met with generally positive reviews when it came out earlier this month. In the Observer, Philip French \"warmed to [its] charm, intelligence and good humour, and ended up thinking the film something of a triumph\".\n\nReading this on mobile? Click here to watch video"
