        "text": "The land of Oz wasn’t the first time colour had appeared on cinema screens, but the moment when Dorothy opens the door of her sepia cabin and steps out into vivid primary colours is emblematic of the whole new world that opened up when technicians developed colour film. It’s also a moment that is unashamedly cinematic: the film calls attention to its fictive nature, and the thrill of the fantasy runs through you. Here are five thrilling moments where black-and-white film collides with colour to make cinematic magic.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nDorothy Gale’s world is a dusty brown before the storm hits. With Toto under her arm, and an eerie silence fallen over the house, she ventures to the back door. The camera moves delicately into the astonishing vibrant Technicolor world of Oz, soon leaving Dorothy behind so it can sweep upwards, the magical score employing refrains from all the classic songs to come as it shows off the multi-coloured wonders of this new world.\n\nA Matter of Life and Death\n\nIn this beautiful classic by Powell & Pressburger – a directing duo who are legendary for their lush use of colour – heaven and earth are differentiated by the soft, rosy colours of life on the ground, and the glowing black-and-white of heaven above. Peter (David Niven) was supposed to die, but he’s fallen in love and wants to stay alive, so his Conductor (Marius Goring) becomes a messenger between the two planes of existence. At the beginning of this clip, his rose marks that transition.\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nIn one of Steven Spielberg’s most memorable scenes, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) watches, transfixed, as a little girl in a bright red coat wanders through the chaos on the streets of Poland, an emblem of innocence as she walks against a march of prisoners and among a stream of people, before finally escaping into a house. That dash of red will appear again, later…\n\nThe Icicle Thief\n\nIn Maurizio Nichetti’s 1989 satirical comedy, a director is invited to introduce a TV screening of his neo-realist classic Ladri di saponette (‘Soap Thieves’; the pun of the English title is based on a peculiar subtitle translation), but is horrified to discover that his beautiful monochrome masterpiece is interrupted by garish colour adverts. When the two mediums start to merge together, the director has to break in to the film to set things right.\n\nPleasantville\n\nIn this modern satire of ‘50s values, the mixture of colour and black-and-white required the most digital effects shots of any film until The Phantom Menace. In this exquisite scene, Pleasantville mother Betty (Joan Allen) is in despair at having blossomed into colour – so her son David (Tobey Maguire), who’s actually from the 1990s, covers up her shame with her uncolourized make-up. It brings a poignant social commentary to the traditional cinematic use of black-and-white to depict the past, as Betty’s repression of her desires is quite literally made flesh."
