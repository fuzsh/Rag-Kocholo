With the premiere of Wizard of Oz in 1939 and the widespread proliferation of technicolor, Hollywood’s familiar monochrome was bathed in brilliant shades of electric yellow, icy blues, burning crimsons, and for the first time - cinema at large could be imagined in color. Despite the innovation of technicolor, much of film and television remained in black-and-white through the 1950s largely due to cost restraints, technological incompatibility, and limited mass accessibility. By the mid-1960s, much of film and television had been brought to life in full color, forgetting the conventional black-and-white schematic that typified the earlier half of the century. Despite the introduction of color, black-and-white films have remained a quiet constant in the world of cinema, morphing from cost effective pragmatism into conscious aesthetic choice as color films became less cost prohibitive. Regardless of the either visually or literally dated nature of the black-and-white film, these black-and-white productions have proven able to enrapture and excite audiences and critics alike.

Complemented by the enduring feud between stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is a 1962 psychological thriller based upon Henry Farrell’s 1960 novel of the same name. Following the lives of a washed up child star and her paraplegic sister rotting in a decaying Hollywood mansion, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is best described as if Grey Gardens and Psycho were fused in a fever dream. Despite their acrimonious relationship, both Crawford and Davis put forth incredible performances, helping in part to revitalize both of their careers. The film’s campy black comedy and impeccable casting helped solidify it as a cult classic in the decades following its release.
