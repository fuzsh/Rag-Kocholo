        "text": "June 16, 1977: Oracle Corporation was incorporated in Redwood Shores, California as Software Development Laboratories (SDL) by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates.\n\nJune 1979: SDL is renamed to Relational Software Inc. (RSI), and relocates to Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California. Oracle 2, the first version of the Oracle database software runs on PDP-11 and is sold to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The company decides to name the first version of its flagship product version 2 rather than version 1 because it believes companies may hesitate to buy the initial release of its product (and, or IBM would not divulge to render the original take).\n\nOctober 1979: RSI actively promotes Oracle on the VAX platform (the software runs on the VAX in PDP-11 emulator mode)\n\n1981 Umang Gupta joined Oracle Corporation where he wrote the first business plan for the company, and served as Vice President and General Manager of the Microcomputer Products.\n\nFebruary 1981: RSI begins developing tools for Oracle, including the Interactive Application Facility (IAF), a predecessor to Oracle*Forms.\n\nBruce Scott was one of the first employees at Oracle (then Software Development Laboratories). He co-founded Gupta Technologies (which later became Centura Software) in 1984 with Umang Gupta, and later became CEO and founder of PointBase, Inc. Bruce was co-author and co-architect of Oracle V1, V2 and V3. He created the sample schema “SCOTT” (containing tables like EMP and DEPT) with the password defaulted to TIGER (apparently named after his cat).\n\nMarch 1983: RSI rewrites Oracle in C for portability and Oracle version 3 is released.
