        "text": "On May 27, 2014 the AT Consulting company announced system implementation of resource management of multiservice networks on the Oracle Communications MetaSolv Solution platform in JSC Rostelecom.\n\nProject Tasks\n\nRapid growth of number of subscribers and expansion of a network architecture in 2011 caused acceptance by the management of Rostelecom of the decision on implementation of an effective industrial system for management of network infrastructure.\n\nPurpose of technology - support of key business processes of the operator:\n\nnetwork planning and accounting,\n\ndesign and optimization of network,\n\nactivation of services,\n\nexecution of requests, etc.\n\nThe products of the line of Oracle Communications MetaSolv Solution focused on work with a broad set of services and having high scalability are taken as a basis. The partner - AT Consulting company.\n\nProject Progress\n\nThe project is begun in December, 2011. During the first stage the implementation team automated resource management of IP/MPLS networks.

The single system is constructed on a modern technology platform, has a big resource of development and supports all types of services of IP networks for corporate clients, including dedicated access to the Internet, all types of IP VPN. It should be noted that a system was actively used in work of telecommunication infrastructure of the Olympic Games in Sochi which conformed to the high international standards of holding the international sporting events\", – Gennady Marashan, the head of department of automation and technological support of networks and the systems of JSC Rostelecom told.\n\n\"The solution brought a segment of OSS-applications of Rostelecom to new technology level. In addition to already achieved results within the first stage of implementation, we carry out works within the second stage covering other segment of company services. A number of integration projects and further development of functionality of a system is in the long term planned. Speaking about complexity of the project, I will especially select two factors. First, a system was started once in all divisions of the company that imposed additional difficulties, secondly, was launched within preparation and holding the Olympic Games that much increased the responsibility for result. Would like to thank all participants both from Rostelecom, and from AT Consulting which made efforts for implementation of this project\", – Igor Morshakov, the project manager of implementation from JSC Rostelecom told.\n\n\"In design process and system implementations it was necessary to consider specifics of work, functional requirements and wishes of all interested divisions. A system was started at the same time in all branches of operator, from Kaliningrad to the Far East that considerably complicated the patronage period: user support was performed in the big range of time zones. It demanded great attention to parts and laborious work together with representatives of Rostelecom and Oracle\", – Miroslav Vuksanovich, the project manager from AT Consulting noted.\n\nDelivery of licenses\n\nOn May 20, 2014 Rostelecom summed up the results of an open competition on providing licenses of programs of Oracle and technical support services[1].\n\nAccording to documentation to purchase, the telecommunication company needed 500 perpetual licenses on the Oracle Communications MetaSolv Solution software product and also technical support services of this solution within a year. The starting price of purchase was $1.468 million.\n\nApplications for tender were submitted by the companies \"Softline Trade\" and \"AT Service\". The last offered lower price of the agreement and faster delivering solutions therefore it was recognized by the winner of purchase. The total sum of the agreement made $1.445 million."
