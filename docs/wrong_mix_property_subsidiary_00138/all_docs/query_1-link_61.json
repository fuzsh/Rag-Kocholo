        "text": "5.1 <strong>Custom</strong> <strong>Attributes</strong> Technical Update MetaSolv Solution M/5.1 Technical Update This document explains how to use custom attributes (<strong>CAs</strong>) with release 5.1 of the MetaSolv Solution. This document pertains only to the 5.1 release. There are some differences in the <strong>CAs</strong> interface for the 5.1.2—5.1.x releases, and those changes are not addressed in this document. <strong>Custom</strong> <strong>Attributes</strong> (<strong>CAs</strong>) <strong>CAs</strong> are what you use to add an attribute, (or property, or value) to a building block. They are custom inasmuch as your use of them is dictated by your unique business processes and technological practices. Several <strong>CAs</strong> are included in the data that comes with the MetaSolv Solution, and those <strong>CAs</strong> are immediately available for you to associate to building blocks. You also have the ability to create new <strong>CAs</strong>. Building blocks are the only parts of the software with which <strong>CAs</strong> can be associated. Templates, elements, connections, and connection allocations are the four building block types from which you can select building blocks for association with a CA. Building block types are predefined and unchangeable. The processes below explain how to create a new CA, how to define valid values for a CA, and how to associate a CA to a building block. Configuration considerations When creating custom attributes, it’s important to understand that the cache build and refresh schedule, as set in the gateway.ini parameters, controls how quickly new <strong>CAs</strong> are available for processing. The gateway.ini parameters to configure the CA cache and refresh schedule are: CacheDisable=false (false is active, true is not active) CacheRefreshActive=true (true is active, false is not active) CacheRefreshMode=daily (refreshes can occur hourly, daily, weekly) CacheRefreshDayOfWeek=1 (Sunday=1, Monday=2, Saturday=7) CacheRefreshHourOfDay=23 (0=midnight, 8=8:00am, 24-hour clock) CacheRefreshHourlyInterval=1 (once every hour, starting with application server startup) Create a new CA Creating a CA assumes two things: 1) that you know why, how, and where you want to use the CA, and 2) that you know what building block type and building block to associate it to in order for it to work how and where you want it to work. The process of creating a CA, at the highest level, involves: ©1994-2002 MetaSolv Software, Inc. 1 MetaSolv confidential. All rights reserved. Information subject to change without notice."
