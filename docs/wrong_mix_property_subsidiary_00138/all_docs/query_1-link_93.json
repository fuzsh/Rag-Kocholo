SOSS was a computer-controlled system using OS/2 that NPR member stations used to receive programming feeds via satellite. SOSS was introduced in 1994 using OS/2 3.0, and was retired in 2007, when NPR switched over to its successor, the Public Radio Satellite System#ContentDepot|ContentDepot.\n\n15 Optical Internetworking Forum - Organization\n\nThe scope includes but is not limited to a) planning, engineering and provisioning of network resources; b) operations, maintenance or administration use cases and processes; and c) management functionality and interfaces for operations support systems and interoperable network equipment\n\n16 Service delivery platform - Relationship to SOA\n\nSOAs can be used as an application integration technology within an SDP but are best served when used in the lower performance functions such as connections between the transactional Operations support system|OSS and Business support system|BSS applications and the SDP. SOAs need careful consideration if they are to meet the real time demands placed on the SDP by the converged event type services.\n\n17 Microsoft Customer Care Framework - Agent Desktop\n\nThe primary user interface for CCF is the agent desktop. This is a desktop-based user interface (UI) that presents data aggregated from various Line of business (LOB) Operations support system|OSS/Business support system|BSS application front ends and presents them in a unified view. CCF does not include an Agent Desktop application, rather samples including source code are provided as part of the framework.\n\n18 Tuxedo (software) - History\n\nThe original development targeted the creation and administration of operations support systems for the US telephone company that required online transaction processing (OLTP) capabilities.\n\n19 Tech Mahindra - Tech Mahindra offices\n\nIts activities spread across a broad spectrum, including Business Support Systems (BSS), Operations Support Systems (OSS), Network Design Engineering, Next Generation Networks, Mobility Solutions, Security consulting and Testing\n\n20 List of software engineering topics - Software applications\n\n**Operations Support System\n\n21 Network resource planning - Next generation services\n\nFurthermore, the importance of coordinating infrastructure investment activities across organizations is addressed to ensure that network capacity is provided when and where it is needed, and that human and Operations Support Systems|operational support system resources are appropriately included in the planning process.\n\n22 *Operations support system used in the telecommunications industry\n\n23 Mobile virtual network enabler\n\nA mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE) [ Gartner Definition][ MVNO Dynamics][ MVNX Definitions] is a company that provides network infrastructure and related services, such as Network Sub systems, Business Support Systems, provisioning, administration and Operations Support Systems to MVNO\n\n24 Quality-of-service - Applications\n\n* Network operations support systems either for the network itself, or for customers' business critical needs\n\n25 TL1 TL1 is used in the input and output messages that pass between Operations_support_system|Operations Support Systems (OSSs) and Network Elements (NEs)\n\n26 AM/FM/GIS - Advantages\n\n* Integration with Operations Support Systems (OSS)\n\n27 Software defined networking - History\n\nATT wanted a soft switch that could reconfigure physical switches in the network and load them with new services from an Operations support system|OSS\n\n28 Self-organizing network - Centralized SON\n\nIn centralized SON (C-SON), function are more typically concentrated closer to higher-order network nodes or the network Operations support system|OSS, to allow a broader overview of more edge elements and coordination of e.g. load across a wide geographic area. Due to the need to inter-work with cells supplied by different equipment vendors, C-SON systems are more typically supplied by 3rd parties like Celcite, Gladiator-Innovations or Cisco.\n\n29 Operations support system\n\n'Operations Support Systems' (OSS), or 'operational support systems' in British usage,See Wikipedia article Operations research. are computer systems used by telecommunications service providers to manage their networks (e.g., telephone networks).

These manage modern telecom networks and provide the data that is needed in the day-to-day running of a telecom network. OSS software is also responsible for issuing commands to the network infrastructure to activate new service offerings, commence services for new customers, and detect and correct network faults.\n\n32 List of computing and IT abbreviations - O\n\n* Operations support system|OSS—Operations Support System\n\n33 STS-108 - Scientific experiments\n\nEndeavour's middeck carried home the results of several experiments completed during Expedition 3's stay on the station.
