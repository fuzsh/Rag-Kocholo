        "text": "John Galsworthy – The First And Last & Other Short Stories\n\nThe short story is often viewed as an inferior relation to the Novel. But it is an art in itself. To take a story and distil its essence into fewer pages while keeping character and plot rounded and driven is not an easy task. Many try and many fail.\n\nIn this series we look at short stories from many of our most accomplished writers. Miniature masterpieces with a lot to say. In this volume we examine some of the short stories of John Galsworthy.\n\nJohn Galsworthy was born at Kingston Upon Thames in Surrey, England, on August 14th 1867 to a wealthy and well established family. His schooling was at Harrow and New College, Oxford before training as a barrister and being called to the bar in 1890. However, Law was not attractive to him and he travelled abroad becoming great friends with the novelist Joseph Conrad, then a first mate on a sailing ship.\n\nIn 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper, the wife of his cousin Major Arthur Galsworthy. The affair was kept a secret for 10 years till she at last divorced and they married on 23 September 1905.\n\nGalsworthy first published in 1897 with a collection of short stories entitled The Four Winds. For the next 7 years he published these and all works under his pen name John Sinjohn. It was only upon the death of his father and the publication of The Island Pharisees in 1904 that he published as John Galsworthy.\n\nHis first play, The Silver Box in 1906 was a success and was followed by The Man of Property later that same year and was the first in the Forsyte trilogy. Whilst today he is far more well know as a Nobel Prize winning novelist then he was considered a playwright dealing with social issues and the class system.\n\nHe is now far better known for his novels, particularly The Forsyte Saga, his trilogy about the eponymous family of the same name. These books, as with many of his other works, deal with social class, upper-middle class lives in particular. Although always sympathetic to his characters, he reveals their insular, snobbish, and somewhat greedy attitudes and suffocating moral codes. He is now viewed as one of the first from the Edwardian era to challenge some of the ideals of society depicted in the literature of Victorian England.\n\nIn his writings he campaigns for a variety of causes, including prison reform, women's rights, animal welfare, and the opposition of censorship as well as a recurring theme of an unhappy marriage from the women’s side. During World War I he worked in a hospital in France as an orderly after being passed over for military service.\n\nHe was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1929, after earlier turning down a knighthood, and awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932 though he was too ill to attend.\n\nJohn Galsworthy died from a brain tumour at his London home, Grove Lodge, Hampstead on January 31st 1933. In accordance with his will he was cremated at Woking with his ashes then being scattered over the South Downs from an aeroplane.\n\nIndex Of Stories\n\nThe First And Last\n\nA Stopic\n\nA Bibliography Of John Galsworthy\n\nThe First And Last\n\nSo the last shall be first, and the first last. -~ Holy Writ\n\nI.\n\nIt was a dark room at that hour of six in the evening, when just the single oil reading-lamp under its green shade let fall a dapple of light over the Turkey carpet; over the covers of books taken out of the bookshelves, and the open pages of the one selected; over the deep blue and gold of the coffee service on the little old stool with its Oriental embroidery. Very dark in the winter, with drawn curtains, many rows of leather-bound volumes, oak-panelled walls and ceiling. So large, too, that the lighted spot before the fire where he sat was just an oasis. But that was what Keith Darrant liked, after his day's work, the hard early morning study of his cases, the fret and strain of the day in court; it was his rest, these two hours before dinner, with books, coffee, a pipe, and sometimes a nap. In red Turkish slippers and his old brown velvet coat, he was well suited to that framing of glow and darkness. A painter would have seized avidly on his clear-cut, yellowish face, with its black eyebrows twisting up over eyes, grey or brown, one could hardly tell, and its dark grizzling hair still plentiful, in spite of those daily hours of wig. He seldom thought of his work while he sat there, throwing off with practised ease the strain of that long attention to the multiple threads of argument and evidence to be disentangled, work profoundly interesting, as a rule, to his clear intellect, trained to almost instinctive rejection of all but the essential, to selection of what was legally vital out of the mass of confused tactical and human detail presented to his scrutiny; yet sometimes tedious and wearing. As for instance to-day, when he had suspected his client of perjury, and was almost convinced that he must throw up his brief. He had disliked the weak-looking, white-faced fellow from the first, and his nervous, shifty answers, his prominent startled eyes a type too common in these days of canting tolerations and weak humanitarianism; no good, no good!\n\nOf the three books he had taken down, a Volume of Voltaire - curious fascination that Frenchman had, for all his destructive irony! a volume of Burton's travels, and Stevenson's New Arabian Nights, he had pitched upon the last. He felt, that evening, the want of something sedative, a desire to rest from thought of any kind. The court had been crowded, stuffy; the air, as he walked home, soft, sou'-westerly, charged with coming moisture, no quality of vigour in it; he felt relaxed, tired, even nervy, and for once the loneliness of his house seemed strange and comfortless.\n\nLowering the lamp, he turned his face towards the fire. Perhaps he would get a sleep before that boring dinner at the Tellasson's. He wished it were vacation, and Maisie back from school. A widower for many years, he had lost the habit of a woman about him; yet to-night he had a positive yearning for the society of his young daughter, with her quick ways, and bright, dark eyes. Curious what perpetual need of a woman some men had! His brother Laurence – wasted - all through women - atrophy of willpower! A man on the edge of things; living from hand to mouth; his gifts all down at heel! One would have thought the Scottish strain might have saved him; and yet, when a Scotsman did begin to go downhill, who could go faster? Curious that their mother's blood should have worked so differently in her two sons. He himself had always felt he owed all his success to it.\n\nHis thoughts went off at a tangent to a certain issue troubling his legal conscience. He had not wavered in the usual assumption of omniscience, but he was by no means sure that he had given right advice. Well! Without that power to decide and hold to decision in spite of misgiving, one would never have been fit for one's position at the Bar, never have been fit for anything. The longer he lived, the more certain he became of the prime necessity of virile and decisive action in all the affairs of life. A word and a blow and the blow first! Doubts, hesitations, sentiment the muling and puking of this twilight age! And there welled up on his handsome face a smile that was almost devilish, the tricks of firelight are so many! It faded again in sheer drowsiness; he slept....\n\nHe woke with a start, having a feeling of something out beyond the light, and without turning his head said: What's that? There came a sound as if somebody had caught his breath. He turned up the lamp.\n\nWho's there?\n\nA voice over by the door answered:\n\nOnly I - Larry.\n\nSomething in the tone, or perhaps just being startled out of sleep like this, made him shiver. He said:\n\nI was asleep. Come in!\n\nIt was noticeable that he did not get up, or even turn his head, now that he knew who it was, but waited, his half-closed eyes fixed on the fire, for his brother to come forward. A visit from Laurence was not an unmixed blessing. He could hear him breathing, and became conscious of a scent of whisky. Why could not the fellow at least abstain when he was coming here! It was so childish, so lacking in any sense of proportion or of decency! And he said sharply:\n\nWell, Larry, what is it?\n\nIt was always something. He often wondered at the strength of that sense of trusteeship, which kept him still tolerant of the troubles, amenable to the petitions of this brother of his; or was it just blood feeling, a Highland sense of loyalty to kith and kin; an old-time quality which judgment and half his instincts told him was weakness but which, in spite of all, bound him to the distressful fellow? Was he drunk now, that he kept lurking out there by the door? And he said less sharply:\n\nWhy don't you come and sit down?\n\nHe was coming now, avoiding the light, skirting along the walls just beyond the radiance of the lamp, his feet and legs to the waist brightly lighted, but his face disintegrated in shadow, like the face of a dark ghost.\n\nAre you ill, man?\n\nStill no answer, save a shake of that head, and the passing up of a hand, out of the light, to the ghostly forehead under the dishevelled hair. The scent of whisky was stronger now; and Keith thought:\n\n'He really is drunk. Nice thing for the new butler to see! If he can't behave '\n\nThe figure against the wall heaved a sigh so truly from an overburdened heart that Keith was conscious with a certain dismay of not having yet fathomed the cause of this uncanny silence. He got up, and, back to the fire, said with a brutality born of nerves rather than design:\n\nWhat is it, man? Have you committed a murder, that you stand there dumb as a fish?\n\nFor a second no answer at all, not even of breathing; then, just the whisper:\n\nYes.\n\nThe sense of unreality which so helps one at moments of disaster enabled Keith to say vigorously:\n\nBy Jove! You have been drinking!\n\nBut it passed at once into deadly apprehension.\n\nWhat do you mean? Come here, where I can see you. What's the matter with you, Larry?\n\nWith a sudden lurch and dive, his brother left the shelter of the shadow, and sank into a chair in the circle of light. And another long, broken sigh escaped him.\n\nThere's nothing the matter with me, Keith! It's true!\n\nKeith stepped quickly forward, and stared down into his brother's face; and instantly he saw that it was true. No one could have simulated the look in those eyes of horrified wonder, as if they would never again get on terms with the face to which they belonged. To see them squeezed the heart-only real misery could look like that. Then that sudden pity became angry bewilderment.\n\nWhat in God's name is this nonsense?\n\nBut it was significant that he lowered his voice; went over to the door, too, to see if it were shut. Laurence had drawn his chair forward, huddling over the fire, a thin figure, a worn, high-cheekboned face with deep-sunk blue eyes, and wavy hair all ruffled, a face that still had a certain beauty. Putting a hand on that lean shoulder, Keith said:\n\nCome, Larry! Pull yourself together, and drop exaggeration.\n\nIt's true; I tell you; I've killed a man.\n\nThe noisy violence of that outburst acted like a douche. What was the fellow about, shouting out such words! But suddenly Laurence lifted his hands and wrung them. The gesture was so utterly painful that it drew a quiver from Keith's face.\n\nWhy did you come here, he said, and tell me this?\n\nLarry's face was really unearthly sometimes, such strange gleams passed up on to it!\n\nWhom else should I tell? I came to know what I'm to do, Keith? Give myself up, or what?\n\nAt that sudden introduction of the practical Keith felt his heart twitch. Was it then as real as all that? But he said, very quietly:\n\nJust tell me. How did it come about, this - affair?\n\nThat question linked the dark, gruesome, fantastic nightmare on to actuality.\n\nWhen did it happen?\n\nLast night.\n\nIn Larry's face there was - there had always been - something childishly truthful. He would never stand a chance in court! And Keith said:\n\nHow? Where? You'd better tell me quietly from the beginning. Drink this coffee; it'll clear your head.\n\nLaurence took the little blue cup and drained it.\n\nYes, he said. It's like this, Keith. There's a girl I've known for some months now\n\nWomen! And Keith said between his teeth: Well?\n\nHer father was a Pole who died over here when she was sixteen, and left her all alone. A man called Walenn, a mongrel American, living in the same house, married her, or pretended to, she's very pretty, Keith - he left her with a baby six months old, and another coming. That one died, and she did nearly. Then she starved till another fellow took her on. She lived with him two years; then Walenn turned up again, and made her go back to him. The brute used to beat her black and blue, all for nothing. Then he left her again. When I met her she'd lost her elder child, too, and was taking anybody who came along.\n\nHe suddenly looked up into Keith's face.\n\nBut I've never met a sweeter woman, nor a truer, that I swear. Woman! She's only twenty now! When I went to her last night, that brute - that Walenn - had found her out again; and when he came for me, swaggering and bullying - Look! he touched a dark mark on his forehead I took his throat in my hands, and when I let go\n\nYes?\n\nDead. I never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him behind.\n\nAgain he made that gesture-wringing his hands.\n\nIn a hard voice Keith said:"
