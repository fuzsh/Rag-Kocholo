It's 12 years since the events of A Man of Property and with his father's health declining, Soames is conscious of the need to produce an heir. He has a potential mother picked out, a young and pretty Frenchwoman, but there's a snag: he's still married to Irene.\n•\nSince her tragic affair with Bosinney, Irene has been living quietly on the legacy left to her by Old Jolyon Forsyte. When Soames visits her to ask for a divorce, his old feelings are rekindled and he once again seeks to possess her. His cousin, Young Jolyon who is Irene's trustee and Soames' polar opposite, tries to protect her and the two are thrown together.\n•\nIn Chancery is a novel about marital discord. Soames' sister, Winifred, also finds herself contemplating divorce after her feckless husband Montague Dartie sells her pearls and runs off to Argentina. It explores family tensions too with the antipathy between Soames and Young Jolyon manifesting itself in the younger generation between Jolly and Val.\n•\nWhile it's essentially a character study, In Chancery is set at a key moment in history. With the death of Queen Victoria and the Boer War, Galsworthy depicts society in the throes of great change. \n•\nIt took me a while to get into this but that was less to do with the quality of Galsworthy's writing and more to do with the fact it was so long since I'd read The Man of Property. In fact it was a more nuanced, satisfying read. \n\n#tribandtuesday #vintagepenguin #vintagepenguins #penguinmodernclassics #booksbooksbooks #bookstagram #bookreview #bookcollector #inchancery #theyforsytesaga #johngalsworthy\".",
