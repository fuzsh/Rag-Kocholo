        "text": "John Galsworthy’s THE MAN OF PROPERTY\n\nA Review\n\nMy earliest association to John Galsworthy is tied in with childhood\n\nmemories of my grandfather. For some reason, I’ve always remembered\n\nseeing a copy of JG’s play _Justice_ on his shelf. I wish I’d talked to\n\nhim about it, but I didn’t. All I had for many years was a kind of\n\nmusty feeling about Galsworthy … he was (as, unfortunately, my\n\ngrandfather was to me too in some ways) some relic sitting around from\n\nthe past.\n\nBut finally this year, I got around to reading JG (1867-1933) for myself.\n\nI don’t remember what triggered this; perhaps it was just a matter of\n\ntime till I got to this writer, who was certainly celebrated in his own\n\nera, if not in ours. If JG is known at all today to the general public,\n\nit’s probably mostly from “The Forsyte Saga”, the name for 3 TV\n\nadaptations: the 26-part BBC serial (1967), and 2 miniseries from the\n\nBritish outfit Granada Television (2002, 2003). [1]\n\nNot one to be seduced by the choices of TV producers, I checked with the\n\nonline Columbia Encyclopedia [2] and Wikipedia [3] … but indeed they\n\nconfirmed that JG’s Forsyte novels were a good place to start reading\n\nhim. The Forsytes, in the original written incarnation, are depicted in\n\nnot 1 … not 3 … but 9 books; in fact a trilogy of trilogies, with\n\nthe first trilogy actually called THE FORSYTE SAGA. (Just to make\n\nthings more complicated, the first 2 trilogies also incorporate extra\n\nworks called “interludes”.) Logically enough, I chose for my read _The\n\nMan of Property_ (1906), the first volume in trilogy one. I will admit\n\nthat the book didn’t “catch” for me till somewhere in the 4th chapter\n\n… but from then on the pleasure received definitely exceeded the\n\nmental work required for the reading.\n\nIf you want to pronounce JG’s last name in true British style, it seems\n\nthat the first syllable should rhyme with “all”. But I will grant that\n\nthis has kind of an affected sound, and I for one certainly don’t mind\n\nrhyming the first syllable with “pal”. He was a very prolific writer;\n\neven the usually complete Wikipedia only lists “Selected Works” … 88\n\nof them! Along with the Forsyte trilogy of trilogies, the listing\n\nincludes other novels, plays, non-fiction, short stories, and\n\ncorrespondence.\n\nI’ve started (tongue partly, but not completely, in cheek) using\n\nFacebook “fan pages” and groups as a rough indicator of popularity. [4]\n\nJG’s page has 167 fans (having a way to go to match Dickens, who has\n\n36,228). Many of the 167 names sound foreign (is JG more popular in\n\nother countries?), but intruigingly, several fans have a last or middle\n\nname of “Galsworthy”. I sent a message to one of them, inquiring as to\n\ntheir relationship with JG, but didn’t get a reply. I may try again in\n\nfuture, when curiosity trumps embarrassment….\n\nEDITION\n\nMy edition, or “e-dition”, was downloaded (for free of course) from the\n\nindispensable Project Gutenberg. [5] For reading, I placed the text\n\nfile on my trusty (and discontinued) Palm Z22 handheld. (Of course you\n\ncould do the same on your iPhone, iPad, Kindle….) There were,\n\nunfortunately, quite a few typographical errors. Even when — on advice\n\nof a PG contact I emailed [6] — I switched to an edition of theirs\n\nwhich was more recent, the error problem persisted. [7] Luckily there\n\nwere not so many typos that things reached a “tipping point” of\n\nincomprehensibilty and frustration! As a good literary citizen, I\n\ncompiled a list of these mistakes, which I sent in to PG when I was done\n\nreading. I had confirmed that these were errors by checking against an\n\nactual early edition. [8, 9]\n\nTMOP\n\n_The Forsyte Saga_, and the 2 succeeding trilogies, is a series of\n\nnovels about the (extended) Forsyte family. (Trollope was of course\n\nanother “serial novelist” … but does anyone know of any other\n\nnovelist, besides JG, who devoted a series to just one family?)\n\nHowever, there is a kind of downside to this, in that JG has decided to\n\nlay out a lot of characters in just TMOP’s first chapter. This did,\n\nadmittedly, seem a bit overwhelming to me at first. I dealt with this\n\nproblem, however, by printing out Chapter I, circling references to the\n\ncharacters, and from this creating a family-tree diagram (reproduced in\n\nAppendix A). Along with the familial relationships, I inserted\n\nin-a-nutshell descriptions of the characters, along with the names of\n\nsome of their residences (useful since sometimes this is how a character\n\nis referred to). As I continued reading, I referred to this diagram\n\noften, to see who was whose son or daughter, who was married to whom,\n\netc.\n\nThe actual occasion told about in Chapter I, is a gathering of all the\n\nForsytes, to mark the engagement of June Forsyte (granddaughter of\n\nfamily patriarch Jolyon Forsyte) to Philip Bosinney. Here we learn the\n\ntime the action is set: the year 1886. We see right away how the\n\nForsyte family, normally preoccupied with differences with each other,\n\nacts as a unit in the presence of a foreign element: this Bosinney, who\n\nis not only (being an architect) of an artistic and creative persuasion,\n\nbut who (even worse) is in the habit of flouting convention by wearing a\n\nold, floppy hat when making social calls! As JG most colorfully puts\n\nit:\n\n[The Forsytes] had taken arms against a common peril. Like\n\ncattle when a dog comes into the field, they stood head to\n\nhead and shoulder to shoulder, prepared to run upon and\n\ntrample the invader to death. [Part I, Chap. I]\n\nIn Britain, life is (or at least, was) of course more defined by\n\n“classes” than here in America. TMOP begins JG’s extended study of an\n\nupper-middle-class British family. Along the lines of “write what you\n\nknow”, JG himself came from an old and wealthy family; he even seems to\n\nhave, in a portrait, that “neat reticence” with which he characterizes\n\nthe Forsytes. Whereas Arnold Bennett’s _Anna of the Five Towns_\n\n(published in 1902, 4 years earlier than TMOP) depicts a raw capitalism,\n\nwith clear victims of same (e.g. the women being poisoned in the pottery\n\nworks), TMOP shows a more mature, a more genteel face of this economic\n\nsystem … and (Bosinney excepted) only the capitalists themselves are\n\nshown.\n\nA book about an extended family of capitalists could easily turn into a\n\ncollection of unsavory figures, with little redeeming value to engage\n\nthe reader’s interest. It is true that what generally counts for the\n\nForsytes is monetary value. But what makes TMOP a fascinating read, are\n\nthe shadings and nuances that JG puts into the narrative … creating\n\nsympathy for his characters. JG’s writing (specifically his plays) have\n\nbeen criticized because “their impartiality makes them less than\n\nexciting” [10]. But to this reviewer, this airing of all aspects of his\n\ncharacters creates a satisfying complexity; it is hard to make a snap\n\njudgement of anyone.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nWe will only look here at several of the multitude of characters in\n\nTMOP. It is natural to consider first Jolyon (“old Jolyon”) Forsyte,\n\nthe head of the Forsytes by virtue of being the eldest of the brothers.\n\nEighty years of age, with his fine, white hair, his dome-like\n\nforehead, his little, dark grey eyes, and an immense white\n\nmoustache, which drooped and spread below the level of his\n\nstrong jaw, he had a patriarchal look, and in spite of lean\n\ncheeks and hollows at his temples, seemed master of perennial\n\nyouth. He held himself extremely upright, and his shrewd,\n\nsteady eyes had lost none of their clear shining. Thus he\n\ngave an impression of superiority to the doubts and dislikes\n\nof smaller men. Having had his own way for innumerable\n\nyears, he had earned a prescriptive right to it. It would\n\nnever have occurred to old Jolyon that it was necessary to\n\nwear a look of doubt or of defiance. [I, I]\n\nHis darker side is (along with the general Forsyte attachment to money),\n\nthat he has disowned his son (“young Jolyon”) for leaving his marriage\n\nto run off with a “foreign governess” … being an example of the F’s\n\nintolerance for social deviation. On the other hand, he is soft-hearted\n\nenough to use his capacity as chairman of the board of a coal mining\n\ncompany, to have a 5000-pound donation made to the family of the company\n\nsuperintendent, who committed suicide. He also has great affection for\n\nhis granddaughter:\n\nThere was June, the atom with flaming hair, who had climbed\n\nall over him, twined and twisted herself about him–about his\n\nheart that was made to be the plaything and beloved resort of\n\ntiny, helpless things. [I, II]\n\nEven his hard line toward his son softens later. All in all, I would\n\ncall this a great portrait of a man of some age … to join the title\n\ncharacter of Trollope’s _The Warden_. (And let it be noted that neither\n\nauthor was by any means a senior citizen when penning these works.)\n\nSoames Forsyte, the son of Old Jolyon’s brother James, is probably the\n\npersonage that the title, “The Man of Property” mostly refers to. In\n\none (literal) sense of the phrase, we see him as, with the architect\n\nBosinney’s help, he builds a house for himself and his wife Irene. But\n\nmore generally, “property” could be said to dominate his life. He\n\nspeculates in art, lets his passion for property (money) dominate his\n\nrelationship with Bosinney to an unforgettable end, and sees his wife in\n\nsimilar terms:\n\nHer power of attraction, he regarded as part of her value as\n\nhis property; … [I, IV]\n\nOn the other hand, Soames definitely also has values that are cultural,\n\nnot monetary. He appreciates the art he speculates in, takes his wife\n\nto the theatre, [11] and is a “great novel reader”. He is even swayed\n\nenough by the beauties of Nature to opt for — yes! — a more expensive\n\nlocation for his new house. (More on Nature later.)\n\nIrene, Soames’ wife, unquestionably merits our sympathy for the way\n\nSoames treats her as his own possession. But Soames perhaps deserves a\n\nbit of sympathy too, since the marriage came about, at least partly,\n\nbecause of Irene’s stepmother’s desire to eliminate the expense of\n\ncaring for her, along with her (the stepmother’s) wish to be free so she\n\ncould herself find someone to marry. So, along with Irene being a\n\nvictim, Soames is himself a kind of victim as well.\n\nJG is enough of a traditional writer to indulge in some “physiognomy”:\n\nThe gods had given Irene dark brown eyes and golden hair,\n\nthat strange combination, provocative of men’s glances, which\n\nis said to be the mark of a weak character. [I, III]\n\nWhile we’re on the subject, JG describes James Forsyte’s son-in-law\n\nDartie as having\n\nthat incorrigible commencement of whisker which, eluding the\n\nstrictest attempts at shaving, seems the mark of something\n\ndeeply ingrained in the personality of the shaver, being\n\nespecially noticeable in men who speculate. [I, IX]\n\nCould there be a scientific explanation for this? [12]\n\nPhilip Bosinney, being artistic and a kind of Bohemian or free spirit,\n\ncertainly does naturally draw our sympathies toward him. But again\n\nthere is the “other hand”: He is quite inflexible in his demands for\n\ncomplete freedom regarding the design of Soames’ house. He does not\n\nseem to realize that, unlike a painter or a sculptor, an architect must\n\nwork hand-in-hand with his client. He also is not too careful about\n\nwhere his romantic affections are directed….\n\nFORSYTES IN GENERAL\n\nOn the one hand, the Forsytes, collectively, use monetary value as a\n\ngeneral yardstick for almost everything. They tend to live by a strict\n\nnotion of propriety, and lack “imagination” (a favorite word of JG’s).\n\nOn the other hand — to the F’s credit — there is a family cohesiveness\n\nand mutual support when required (as we have seen when Bosinney came on\n\nthe scene). And there is the very interesting argument (advanced in\n\nChapter X), that without a Forsyte class, the arts would not be viable.\n\nThe F’s themselves might well lack imagination; but — so goes this\n\nargument — they (i.e. their funds) are needed in order for imagination\n\nto survive. We are no longer in the world of Shakespeare or Mozart,\n\nwhere there were royal or noble patrons to provide support. (Can\n\ngovernment ever satisfactorily fill in the breach?)\n\nJG’s refusal to dismiss the Forsytes as simply greedy capitalists is\n\nalso seen in the epigraph to the book as a whole:\n\n… You will answer\n\n“The slaves are ours…”\n\n_Merchant of Venice_\n\nThere is a lot lurking in these few words (which incidentally inspired\n\nme to read this entire play of Shakespeare’s, which ashamedly I never\n\nhad before). This excerpt comes from a speech by Shylock, the Jewish\n\nmoney-lender, during a trial to decide if he is entitled (as his\n\ncontract indeed stipulates) to a (literal!) pound of flesh from Antonio,\n\nwho was not able to repay his debt. Here is the passage in its entirety\n\n(Act IV, Scene I):\n\nDUKE\n\nHow shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?\n\nSHYLOCK\n\nWhat judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\n\nYou have among you many a purchased slave,\n\nWhich, like your asses and your dogs and mules,\n\nYou use in abject and in slavish parts,\n\nBecause you bought them: shall I say to you,\n\nLet them be free, marry them to your heirs?\n\nWhy sweat they under burthens? let their beds\n\nBe made as soft as yours and let their palates\n\nBe season’d with such viands? You will answer\n\n‘The slaves are ours:’ so do I answer you:\n\nThe pound of flesh, which I demand of him,\n\nIs dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.\n\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\n\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\n\nI stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?\n\nIn other words, anyone criticizing the Forsytes for their\n\nacquisitiveness should be prepared to equally criticize _themselves_ for\n\nthe money and possessions they have themselves (perhaps not too nobly)\n\nacquired. This might make it just a bit harder to dismiss the Forsytes\n\nwith a knee-jerk reaction!\n\nNATURE\n\nTMOP approaches the idea of Nature very differently than Bennett’s _Anna\n\nof the Five Towns_, which appeared just 4 years earlier in 1902, and\n\nwhich I also read recently [13]. In the Bennett, Nature is an adversary\n\nthat Man must conquer; Nature spurs us on to survive and reproduce, but\n\nalso throws obstacles in our path. In the Galsworthy, Nature is a very\n\ndifferent kind of “enemy” (if one can call it that). It is an\n\nintoxicating element, distracting one from narrow life pursuits (such as\n\nthe acquisition of money), and rigid “principles”. We see this depicted\n\nin the London populace in general, as couples entwine themselves in the\n\nparks. Regarding the Forsytes, we’ve seen how Soames is enticed by the\n\nlandscape, to actually pay more for a choicer lot for his new home.\n\nJolyon’s softening toward his son comes when he sits with young Jolyon\n\nand his family, in the garden of their house. Here is where JG uses the\n\nstrange word “daverdy” (accent on 1st syllable), a dialect form meaning\n\n“dowdy, unkempt” … and a word “belonging” (in written form) to him\n\nalone (well, at least no other citations in the OED). Here are JG’s\n\nruminations on the term:\n\nWhat an expressive variant of the word ‘dowdy’..is the word\n\n‘daverdy’..! Dowdy suggests the flannel petticoat, the\n\nthick, the dusty appearance; daverdy a sea-green, trailing,\n\ndown-at-heeledness. [14]\n\nSo we have here Nature in all its greenness and messiness … enough to\n\nsoften the stiff chief of the Forsyte clan.\n\nTHE WRITING\n\nJG can describe in quite an original manner, as in this word-picture of\n\nOld Jolyon’s sister Aunt Juley (her married name being used below):\n\nMrs. Septimus Small was the tallest of the four sisters; her\n\ngood, round old face had gone a little sour; an innumerable\n\npout clung all over it, as if it had been encased in an iron\n\nwire mask up to that evening, which, being suddenly removed,\n\nleft little rolls of mutinous flesh all over her countenance.\n\n[I, III]\n\nI love the somewhat gross but oh-so-vivid “hairy” in the passage below.\n\nNot to mention the general evocation of comfort. (Eating without having\n\nto see your neighbors still seems like a fine idea to this writer.)\n\nOf all eating-places James [Forsyte] liked best to come here;\n\nthere was something unpretentious, well-flavoured, and\n\nfilling about it, and though he had been to a certain extent\n\ncorrupted by the necessity for being fashionable, and the\n\ntrend of habits keeping pace with an income that would\n\nincrease, he still hankered in quiet City moments after the\n\ntasty fleshpots of his earlier days. Here you were served by\n\nhairy English waiters in aprons; there was sawdust on the\n\nfloor, and three round gilt looking-glasses hung just above\n\nthe line of sight. They had only recently done away with the\n\ncubicles, too, in which you could have your chop, prime\n\nchump, with a floury-potato, without seeing your neighbours,\n\nlike a gentleman. [II, XIII]\n\nAnd then, I must admit, there is the “they did those things even then?”\n\ncategory. I thought that the word “literally” was corrupted only\n\nrecently to mean “taken in the strongest admissible sense”, but the OED\n\ndates it back to 1863, even earlier than this TMOP example:\n\nHer embonpoint had increased of late; she was in the full\n\nswing of autumn organization, her writing-table literally\n\nstrewn with the menus of charity functions. [III, III]\n\nThere is definitely humor to be had:\n\nHe [Dartie] told two or three stories verging on the\n\nimproper, a concession to the company, for his stories were\n\nnot used to verging. [II, IX]\n\nSometimes JG is being rather sly, and I don’t think should be taken\n\nliterally, as in the “properly” below, from the opening sentences of the\n\nnovel:\n\nThose privileged to be present at a family festival of the\n\nForsytes have seen that charming and instructive sight–an\n\nupper middle-class family in full plumage. But whosoever of\n\nthese favoured persons has possessed the gift of\n\npsychological analysis (a talent without monetary value and\n\nproperly ignored by the Forsytes), has witnessed a spectacle,\n\nnot only delightful in itself, but illustrative of an obscure\n\nhuman problem. [I, I]\n\nThe word “typical” below actually means the opposite of the usual\n\n“ordinary” … meaning more like “archetype” or “ideal” or “mother of\n\nall cars”:\n\nAn extra, if subdued, sparkle, an added touch of the best\n\ngloss or varnish characterized this vehicle, and seemed to\n\ndistinguish it from all the others, as though by some happy\n\nextravagance–like that which marks out the real ‘work of\n\nart’ from the ordinary ‘picture’–it were designated as the\n\ntypical car, the very throne of Forsytedom. [II, VI]\n\nAt a climactic moment in TMOP, there is the following speech:\n\n“Dry up” he said. “Don’t I tell you he’s taken the knock? [III, IV]\n\nThough this may sound quaint today, I suspect it was much more powerful\n\nthen. “Dry up” means “stop talking”; “taken the knock” means “sustained\n\na severe financial or emotional blow”. [15] Both kinds of “blow” apply\n\n— unforgettably — in the present case.\n\nCONCL\n\nJohn Galsworthy was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932.\n\nThough this is by no means an infallible barometer of stellar literary\n\nquality, it should at least inspire some serious interest. JG (like his\n\ncontemporary Arnold Bennett) fits neither into the comfortable Victorian\n\nage of Dickens and Trollope, nor the modern experimental era of Woolf\n\nand Joyce. Perhaps JG’s reputation (and Bennett’s) still suffers from\n\nthe scorn of the “Bloomsbury snobs”? (See Telegraph article, Appendix\n\nB.) Let me hasten to add that my inclusion of this article does NOT\n\nmean that I agree with all the views of the author. For example, I have\n\nnot read D. H. Lawrence, but based on _To The Lighthouse_, I do not\n\nconsider Virginia Woolf a “fraud”!] Let it be said for him, that he\n\ntakes on — and I think succeeds at — the tough task of presenting a\n\nclass of society that one would normally look askance at, with sympathy\n\nand fairness.\n\nIt may be true that Galsworthy, in refusing to blanketly condemn a class\n\nof quite-rich people, is (like Bennett, for different reasons) not\n\ntotally a “politically correct” writer for our times. But if this\n\nbothers you, you can reflect on his truly liberal stance on prison\n\nreform, women’s rights, animal welfare (see the zoo section in TMOP,\n\nchapter VI), and opposition to censorship. [16] Further, I recently saw\n\nin New York City a revival [17] of his play _Loyalties_, which probes\n\nthe anti-Semitic attitudes woven into the society of his era.\n\nAnd just think … if you do take a liking to _The Man of Property_, you\n\nwon’t run out of Forsyte books for a long time!\n\nNOTES\n\nOED = Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition\n\nWIKI = Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org )\n\n[1] The novels drawn from in each adaptation:\n\n(a) 1967 BBC: The first 2 trilogies: THE FORSYTE SAGA and A MODERN COMEDY\n\n(b) 2002 Granada: The first 2 novels (_The Man of Property_, _In\n\nChancery_), plus intervening “Interlude” (_Indian Summer of a Forsyte_),\n\nin the trilogy THE FORSYTE SAGA\n\n(c) 2003 Granada: The third novel, _To Let_, in the trilogy THE FORSYTE\n\nSAGA\n\n[2] Online Columbia Encyclopedia is at http://www.encyclopedia.com/\n\n[3] Wikipedia: see WIKI above\n\n[4] Beware of Facebook “fan pages” that are simply glorified Wikipedia\n\nentries.

As David Widger wrote in his\n\n24dec2009 email to me: “Yes, I know, the PG Catalog does not indicate\n\nthe more recently corrected and updated eBook of the list of several\n\neditions available for a single title. It is an item on our task list”.\n\n[8] Actual early edition of TMOP I used to check for Project Gutenberg\n\nerrors: Charles Scribner’s Sons, (c) 1918-1922 (via Google Books,\n\nhttp://books.google.com/ )\n\n[9] One might wonder why I didn’t download the actual early edition from\n\nGoogle Books, as ascii text, and use that for my e-reader.

However, as for Lawrence and Woolf, I never saw so\n\nmuch fuss for so little. Lawrence’s prose is tortured and, while his\n\ncharacterisation is often vivid, his carnal obsessions become rather\n\ntiresome and, unintentionally I am sure, comical. Woolf’s snobbery,\n\npreciousness and bonkersness come through on every page. She has\n\nbenefited immensely from a gang of sycophants in the literary trade and\n\nacademia talking her up for nearly a century, not so much for her own\n\nsake as for the sake of the cult of Bloomsbury that she incarnated so\n\nwell.\n\nShe has her moments: the depiction of a day in high summer in the\n\nopening pages of Mrs Dalloway is magnificent; and the conceit of To the\n\nLighthouse, with the solipsistic “I have had my vision” at the end,\n\nrather special. However, I feel more and more that she and David\n\n‘Erbert were a pair of self-obsessed frauds, put on Earth to create a\n\nsub-genre of literary criticism that would keep otherwise unemployable\n\nnerds in work for decades to come.\n\nThe Bloomsberries had another distressing effect, which was to help\n\nassert their own intellectual, cultural and creative superiority by\n\ntrashing the reputations of potential rivals. Three especially were\n\nkept in their sights: H G Wells, Arnold Bennett (now more famous for\n\nhaving an omelette named after him than for his considerable literary\n\nendeavours) and John Galsworthy.\n\nDuring the attempted period of brainwashing that I underwent during my\n\ndegree course, I, being young and impressionable, was for a time taken\n\nin by some of this. Yet I had cravings. I had read all nine of the\n\nForsyte novels (not just the six filmed by the BBC in the 1960s) and\n\nfound them rather good, not just for their characterisation (Soames\n\nForsyte is one of the great creations of our literature) but for\n\nGalsworthy’s vivid reconstruction of late-Victorian England. I sneaked\n\ninto Wells when I learned that part of the inspiration for Vaughan\n\nWilliams’s London Symphony was the stunning description of a destroyer\n\ngoing down the Thames and out to sea at the end of Tono-Bungay, read the\n\nwhole book and rather enjoyed it.\n\nThe final breach in my defences was caused by seeing the superb film of\n\nThe Card, starring Valerie Hobson and Alec Guinness, and going off to\n\nread Bennett’s uplifting novel afterwards, and rejoicing in its\n\nculmination, with the assertion of Denry Machin’s identification “with\n\nthe great cause of cheering us all up”. To say there are no\n\nprofundities in the writings of these novelists is rubbish, just as it\n\nwould be to say there are no shallows in Woolf or Lawrence; but perhaps\n\nwhat they all have in common with Joyce (and this explains his\n\ngreatness) is humour, and a keen observation of others that shuns\n\nself-obsession.\n\nThis has been on my mind this week because I have, while snowed in, had\n\nthe time to read Selina Hastings’s first-class biography of another\n\nwriter who knew Bennett, Wells and Galsworthy, Somerset Maugham.\n\nMaugham was never quite lumped in with the other three by the\n\nBloomsberries, something I am not sure he should have taken as a\n\ncompliment. I suspect this was because they regarded him as so\n\nineffably low-brow, with his novels outnumbered by his light comedies in\n\nthe West End, that he was never in their estimation going to threaten\n\ntheir hegemony.\n\nMaugham himself started off by being rather dismissive of Bennett, whom\n\nhe met in Paris when both were in the infancy of their careers, but came\n\nround to him in time. The two men had much in common in their writing,\n\nif not in their lives, in being concerned with that everyday world that\n\nWoolf noticed existed only when she had to talk to her cook or her\n\nunder-housemaid. Maugham has always been a lacuna for me and, like\n\nBennett, I came to him through film: the excellent Quartet and Trio,\n\nmade of his short stories in the late 1940s and early 1950s. While he\n\nhas rivals in France (notably Maupassant), nobody comes close to him as\n\na writer of short stories in English. He has an ability to establish\n\ncharacter, and interest in that character, immediately. Having read\n\nLady Selina’s book, I am going to fill two shocking gaps in my reading\n\nwithout delay: I have ordered Of Human Bondage and Cakes and Ale, which\n\nseem to be Maugham’s two greatest novels, to help me through any further\n\nblizzards this winter.\n\nIt is, I am sure, time that literary critics stopped being quite so\n\nsniffy about Maugham and his friends. They played an immensely\n\nsignificant part in our culture a century ago, in that period of 50 or\n\n60 years between universal education (and therefore, theoretically,\n\nliteracy) and the coming of wireless and television. That was the\n\nperiod when people devoured novels, when novelists were what we would\n\nnow call great celebrities, and when lending libraries were important\n\ninstitutions in the lives of millions. A small and often self-regarding\n\nknot of intellectuals would have buried themselves in Woolf and\n\nLawrence; the growing respectable classes would have gone to Maugham,\n\nWells, Galsworthy and Bennett in droves. Perhaps that very popularity\n\ncaused disgust among the Bloomsberries, on the principle that nothing\n\nthat seems not to be rare can possibly have much value: a sadly\n\nblinkered view if so.\n\nShould anyone wish to have an insight into life as most people lived it\n\na century ago, and into people as they probably really were, he will\n\nfind it better in the writings of these now-despised novelists than it\n\nwould ever be in the pages of Woolf, or the grinding, brooding and\n\nconcupiscent world of Lawrence. I know that alone is no reason to read,\n\nor esteem, a book. However, the writing is universally good, the plots\n\nare usually compelling, and the characters believable. Unlike the\n\nBloomsberries, I would not dream of saying that my team deserves to have\n\nthe field to itself: there should be room for all of them. But I would\n\nwarn the aficionados of To the Lighthouse, or Sons and Lovers, that, if\n\nthey were to start delving into something less introspective and\n\nrarefied, there is always the danger that they might never come back.\n\n—\n\nTom Frenkel\n\nemail: frethoa AT aol DOT com\n\n07 july 2010"
