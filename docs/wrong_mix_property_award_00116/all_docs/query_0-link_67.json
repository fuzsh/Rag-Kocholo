        "text": "He writes with humanity and immediacy; indeed, his own private life would be echoed by the tensions in his Forsyte novels. Galsworthy had a long affair, from his late 20s, with the wife of his cousin. They married after her divorce, rather as Irene Heron marries Young Jolyon Forsyte, after divorcing Soames. It is true that the less privileged tend only to have walk-on parts in the Forsyte novels, but they figure more prominently in the plays with which he made his reputation – such as The Silver Box and Justice, Edwardian dramas about the hypocrisies of the British class system. Class is also central to two of his better-known plays: Strife, of 1909, which presents with alarming prescience a vignette of the industrial warfare that blighted England in the years before the First World War, the period known as “The Great Unrest”; and The Skin Game of 1920, which depicts a landed class shattered by the war, clinging hopelessly to lost Victorian ideals and codes.\n\nIt is a mystery why Galsworthy’s plays are seldom revived or adapted for television, because in their insight, as well as their language, they are remarkable. No social or literary theory is needed to justify Galsworthy’s greatness. He tells compelling stories brilliantly in clear and simple language, develops vivid and credible characters, and shows a deep understanding both of the times in which his fiction is set and the forces at work during them.\n\nHe was writing about a declining breed, which is part of the reason he went out of fashion, but no one who wishes to understand the ruling class of late Victorian and Edwardian England can do so properly without reading Galsworthy. The Forsyte chronicles alone show how he deserved the greatness his contemporaries attributed to him. Now he merits a revaluation."
