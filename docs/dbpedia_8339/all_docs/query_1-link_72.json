Also, does anyone have experience with said axe? Thanks in advance.\n\nPK\n\nOscar Schmidt & Co. sold it to Harmony in 1938 so the guitars your'e lookin' for at least 70 years old ...GOOD LUCK\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with a 70 year old guitar, PK... you should probably make sure you're educated about the subject a little:\n\nhttp://fraulini.com\n\nhttp://stellaguitars.com\n\nThe Fraulini guitars site belongs to a luthier in Madison, WI who has done a lot of homework regarding the parlor guitars built in the early 20th century. There are a couple of links there that will be helpful.\n\nThe second site belongs to Neil Harpe in Annapolis, MD - he sells a lot of OS guitars, and other makers as well. He also published a small book on OS \"Stella\" guitars that's worth checking out.\n\nOnce you know the territory a bit more, remember that a lot of great guitars from that time period were neither OS built nor had a 'Stella' label - play a bunch, if possible, then pull the trigger on one you like, regardless of the name. My favorite parlor has no markings whatsoever and is about 85-90 years old, but is still a great guitar.\n\nYou could also check this site out as well:\n\nhttp://vintagebluesguitars.com\n\nHe's always on the hunt for ladder-braced parlor guitars...\n\nGood luck.\n\nOh yeah!\n\nI love OS made Stellas and have owned several in the past. You used to be able to pick them up for pocket change. Some of the best guitars to ever grace the planet. Biggest problem as someone has already mentioned, is that they can be real fussy do to age. My favorite literally exploded when the glue holding it together gave up the ghost. Kept the pieces in the case for years but when I talked to some folks about having it brought back was told it was time to let her go.\n\nThe word on these guitars has creeped out and finding one in good playing condition, especially a 12 string, ain't cheap anymore."
