        "text": "WD41S WD42S WD44S WD46S\n\nTo commemorate 120 years of making guitars, Washburn is planning several promotions and events during 2003, as well as the introduction of a Reserved Edition commemorative guitar series constructed of exotic hardwoods, the Rarewood Acoustics.\n\nOver 1.2 centuries, Washburn grew from a small guitar workshop in Chicago, Illinois, in November 1883. That's when Lyon & Healy -- a musical instrument retail house -- launched the Washburn brand name. Washburn's parent company became the largest music house in the world, helping to establish Chicago as a global center for musical instruments, and Washburn as one of the world's most respected guitars.\n\nIn the early 1900s Lyon & Healy sold the Washburn name, which was owned by several different companies before being bought by Fretted Industries, a Chicago-area music company, in the 1970s. Washburn created electric-acoustic guitars like the Festival Series cutaway in the 1980s. Innovations in the 80s also included thin semi-solid bodies, imaginative solid body electrics, solid body classical guitars, and electric-acoustic basses.\n\nIn 2002, Washburn became U.S. Music Corporation, a name that reflects the wide range of capabilities embodied in the top music gear companies that Washburn has acquired during recent decades, including Vinci Strings; amplifier manufacturers Randall and Eden; SoundTech Pro Audio and Autoharp originator Oscar Schmidt.\n\nWashburn officially kicked-off its 120th anniversary celebration with special events at the NAMM Summer Session in Nashville this July, and promotions will follow throughout the rest of the year. Washburn is also marking this special occasion with the introduction of a 120th Anniversary Rarewood Acoustics Reserved Edition.\n\nThese instruments feature hand-selected exotic hardwoods, including Macassar Ebony, Flamed Olive Ash, Hawaiian Koa and Rosewood. Due to the limited availability of the Rarewood Acoustics Reserve Edition, the value of this instrument as an addition to one's collection is immeasurable.\n\nFeatures\n\nExotic wood back and sides\n\nSolid spruce or Cedar tops\n\nAbalone soundhole rosettes\n\nBound Rosewood fingerboard with Mother of Pearl diamond inlays\n\nMahogany neck\n\nVintage crown headstock with abalone logo inlay\n\nRosewood butterfly bridge\n\nGrover tuners\n\nMolded hardshell case\n\nOne extra set of Vinci 807s XLP phosphor bronze strings\n\nCertificate of Authenticity\n\nLimited Lifetime warranty\n\nPrice"
