        "text": "GOD WAS IN HIS HEAVEN, AND all was right with the world He had\n\njust created. Almost.\n\n''Ah, Lordship,'' said one intrepid angel. ''About this Brazil.\n\nYou've given it gorgeous beaches and rivers, mountains and dales. The\n\nflowers! The land is bountiful, the vistas spectacular. The foliage,\n\nthe birds, the rocks, the fruit, the climate! But isn't this all too\n\nmuch for one place? There won't be ! enough good things left for\n\neverywhere else.''\n\n''Relax,'' God said. ''It will all balance out. Wait till you see\n\nthe people I put in this place.''\n\nThe joke is one that Brazilians tell on themselves. The sweet and\n\ncharmingly apathetic denizens of this vast, sprawling nation\n\nacknowledge its image as the Land of the Laid Back, rich in resources\n\nbut riddled with debt. When visiting French President Charles de\n\nGaulle said, in 1964, ''Brazil is not a serious country,'' the locals\n\nwere furious -- for about 10 seconds, or approximately the time it\n\ntook them to refocus their energies on having a good time. Blame it\n\non the bossa nova.\n\nAnd what more definitive example of the national style than that\n\nseemingly everybody in Brazil is known by a single name? To use\n\nanything more would be overly formal, superfluous, scarcely worth the\n\nextra breath, too . . . too . . . serious. And so, the wondrous\n\nmusician and composer, Jobim. The soccer legend, Pele. And the\n\ncurrent Brazilian national celebrity, Oscar.\n\nEven now, few people outside, or even inside, Brazil know Oscar's\n\nfull name -- Oscar Daniel Bezerra Schmidt -- including a fair number\n\nof aficionados of international basketball, a sport in which he has\n\nbeen a major star for the better part of a decade. Many of the good\n\nfolks of Caserta, a town near Naples in southern Italy, still don't\n\nknow his surname, even though Oscar and his wife, Cristina, have\n\nlived among them since 1982. While there he has played for teams\n\nunder three different sponsors and has won five consecutive scoring\n\nchampionships in the limb-and-life-endangering Italian league. He has\n\nbeen called the Gunboat of Molbigirgi -- after the name of the\n\nfurniture company that once sponsored the team -- but he has seldom\n\nbeen called Schmidt.\n\nAnd in the summer of '87, in Indianapolis, when the U.S. contested\n\nthe gold medal in the 10th Pan American Games against Brazil, Team\n\nU.S.A. certainly played as if it had never heard of Oscar, by last\n\nname or first. When the Americans jumped ahead by 20 points late in\n\nthe first half of that game, the boys red, white and blue didn't seem\n\nto care that this Oscar had scored 53 against Mexico only two days\n\nbefore.\n\nAs with most foreign-bred basketball players, the 6 ft. 8 1/2 in.,\n\n220-pound Oscar was better known by the U.S. team for what he\n\ncouldn't do. He couldn't pass, couldn't dribble for long, absolutely\n\ncouldn't play defense. O.K., fine. But how about what Oscar could do?\n\nOscar could do this: Bang, bang, bang, you're dead. And America\n\nwas. Oscar could shoot. Long . . . longer . . . longer still . . .\n\nforget about it. Streak shoot. Scatter shoot. Shoot from any and\n\nevery angle. Shoot with Ianquis flying at him and dangling from him\n\nlike tassels on a samba dancer. Shoot the very strings off the net.\n\nThus, to the everlasting sorrow of David Robinson (who was to foul\n\nout), Willie Anderson (who was a particularly burned victim) and U.S.\n\ncoach Denny Crum, Oscar started to shoot in the second half. And\n\nshoot. And he didn't stop until he had made six three-point baskets,\n\n35 points in the half and 46 for the game. After one scoring foray he\n\nroared unintelligibly, tore at his hair and slapped the sides of his\n\ntemples as if to make sure he wasn't hallucinating. (For months\n\nafterward the American side denigrated Oscar's effort by claiming\n\nnobody actually guarded him, but Oscar was fouled twice behind the\n\nthree-point parabola, and he made 13 of 15 free throws in the game.\n\nSomebody was trying to guard him.)\n\nWhen the visitors from Brazil won 120-115, it was as shocking and\n\nspectacular an upset as there had ever been in international play.\n\nThe Americans had the home-court advantage. The U.S. had never given\n\nup 100 points in a game. And Brazil? Heck, throw some occasional ball\n\ndenial and rough stuff out there and this fabulous shooter, this\n\nshuffle-stepping, insouciant, 30- year-old Oscar, would surely back\n\ndown, exhibiting his country's traditional indolence, and melt away.\n\n''The Americans are the best team every time,'' Oscar says. ''We\n\nhave no illusions about that. If we play 10 times, Brazil wins maybe\n\nonce, twice. But we always play hard. No matter how we look. And, who\n\nknows, when that one time comes, we have to snatch it. We always\n\nthink maybe, just maybe, it will be in the gold-medal game.''\n\nSnatch it they did at Indy. And as Oscar and Marcel (31 points)\n\nand Israel and Gerson and all the rest of the Brazilian one-names\n\nwere hugging and screeching and rolling around on the court in wild\n\ncelebration, the Market Square Arena crowd began to applaud, not out\n\nof courtesy so much as in recognition of a brilliant performance\n\nsustained to fruition. ''In the restaurant later the people stand up\n\nand clap when we come in,'' Oscar said. ''This was unbelievable. The\n\nwhole scene, how can I say it? This was what we dream. It was the\n\ntime for my life.''\n\nIt changed his life as well. And basquete in Brazil may never be\n\nthe same. Ari Vidal, the Brazilian coach, complains that his country\n\nis a sporting ''monoculture,'' with too much emphasis on soccer:\n\n''We're number 21 of sports. Soccer is number one, two, three, four,\n\nall the way down to 20.'' But the Pan Am basketball triumph happened\n\nto come at a time when King Soccer was struggling in Brazil: Violence\n\non and off the field, scandals, subpar performances and an absence of\n\nheroes had tarnished soccer's golden image.\n\nAs the Brazilian national basketball squad toured southern Brazil\n\nin recent months, it became clear what winning the Pan Am Games had\n\nmeant for the sport. The Brazilian club leagues have expanded by 20\n\nteams; attendance is at an alltime high, up 30% over last year. Every\n\none of the 13 men's and women's Olympic qualifying tournament games\n\nwas televised in Brazil, many by two or more networks. The women's\n\nteam has enjoyed huge popularity, thanks in large part to 5 ft. 8 in.\n\nHortencia, the much-publicized 28-year-old glamour queen who led last\n\nyear's distaff Pan Ams in scoring and who spread her quite unadorned\n\nnatural charms over the cover and 10 pages of a recent Brazilian\n\nedition of Playboy. Alas for Hortencia-oglers, Brazil's women's team\n\nwas eliminated in the pre-Olympic tournament and will not compete in\n\nSeoul. But for the men's team, the ride continues. Following the Pan\n\nAm success, Vidal landed a lucrative new coaching job in Spain (which\n\nhe will assume when the Olympics have concluded). And at home Oscar\n\ncopped an Ouro (gold) credit card commercial from the Bank of Brazil."
