        "text": "Guitars - Acoustic - Electric - Custom | Keyboards - Acoustic - Digital | Drums | Cymbals | Recording / Studio | Microphones | Amplifiers | Affiliates | Legendary Instruments\n\nThe guitar is a musical instrument with ancient roots that is used in a wide variety of musical styles. It typically has six strings, but four, seven, eight, ten, twelve and eighteen string guitars also exist.\n\nGuitars are recognized as one of the primary instruments in blues, country, flamenco, mariachi, rock music, and many forms of pop. They can also be a solo classical instrument. Guitars may be played acoustically, where the tone is produced by vibration of the strings and modulated by the hollow body, or they may rely on an amplifier that can electronically manipulate tone. Such electric guitars were introduced in the 20th century and continue to have a profound influence on popular culture.\n\nTraditionally guitars have usually been constructed of combinations of various woods and strung with animal gut, or more recently, with either nylon or steel strings. Guitars are made and repaired by luthiers. There are many brands of guitars, but some commonly known brands are PRS, Gibson, Dean, Gretsch, Ibanez, Kramer, Jackson, Schecter and Fender. The following list includes electric, acoustic, and custom guitar manufacturers. For an in depth history on the guitar see history link at bottom of page.\n\nAcoustic Guitars\n\nMartin | Gibson | Washburn | Guild | Alvarez | Taylor | Yamaha | Ovation\n\nMartin - The Martin Guitar Company in Nazareth, Pennsylvania has been producing acoustic guitars that are acknowledged to be the finest in the world for well over 150 years. The Martin Guitar Company has endured since C. F. Martin, Sr. produced Stauffer influenced creations in the 1830s to recent developments introduced by C. F. Martin IV. Continuously operating under family management is an amazing feat in today’s market place, reflecting six generations of family dedication to the guitar maker’s craft. Throughout its rich history, the company has adapted successfully to changes in design, distribution, and manufacturing methods. In spite of these changes, C. F. Martin has always maintained its commitment to quality. This commitment to excellence in instrument production born in 1833 is still alive and well today at Martin’s expanded facility in Nazareth, Pennsylvania.\n\nGibson - Orville Gibson began making mandolins in Kalamazoo, Michigan USA. In 1902, the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co, Ltd. was founded. In the 1920s the Gibson Company developed many innovations in guitar design, and became the leading manufacturer of arch-top guitars, particularly the Gibson L5 model. In 1936 they introduced an \"Electric Spanish\" model, the ES-150, recognized as the first commercially successful electric guitar. Between 1974 and 1984 production of Gibson guitars was shifted from Kalamazoo to Nashville, Tennessee.More recently new production plants have been opened in Southern and rural areas, such as Memphis, Tennessee as well as Bozeman, Montana. The Memphis facility is used for semi-hollow and custom shop instruments, while the Bozeman facility is dedicated to acoustic instruments.\n\nWashburn - Washburn Guitar’s 120-history began in Chicago in 1883. The original guitar factory was located a few blocks away from Maxwell Street. In the early 1920s, Maxwell Street itself was a center of the musical movement. Often considered the emigration point of thousands of African-Americans arriving from the Mississippi Delta, Maxwell Street was believed to be the birthplace of the Delta Blues. Musicians of all calibers would listen and jam in an atmosphere without the monetary influence so prevalent in today’s music industry. The Delta blues soon became the dominant blues style and greatly influenced the Rock & Roll scene. On Maxwell Street, as well as in small clubs around the country, Washburn guitars embodied the perfect mix of style, craftsmanship and sound that was the epitome of the hard working musician. From blues musicians, to rock musicians Washburn’s history is one of diversity.\n\nGuild - With a rather modest beginning the Guild Guitar Company began its rise from a small Manhattan guitar workshop to one of the world's premier makers of high-quality acoustic and electric guitars. Registered in October 1952, the fledgling Guild Guitar Company set up a 1,500-square-foot manufacturing facility on the second floor of a factory at 536 Pearl St.. Guild's genesis was simple. In 1952, Dronge's friend George Mann suggested that the two men start a new guitar company. Another friend of Dronge's, Gene Detgen, suggested the name “Guild”, and the Guild Guitar Company was in business, with Mann and Dronge as president vice president, respectively. Guild flourished in the '50s and '60s. Although they had started out producing mainly jazz guitars, Guild's popularity and reputation spread quickly, and over the years its instruments found their way into the hands of high-profile musicians.\n\nAlvarez - The Alvarez line stems from an exclusive relationship with Kazuo Yairi of Japan whose family represents more than 60 years of hand crafting fine acoustic guitars. Kazuo Yairi is the last luthier of his generation who continues to build guitars by hand. This attention to quality, detail and tradition separates Alvarez from other acoustic guitar manufacturers. The evolution of a new guitar begins in St. Louis, Missouri where production model ideas are conceived and designed by a development staff at St. Louis Music, Inc. The Yairi factory in Kani, Gifu-Japan then takes these designs and produces a limited number of instruments, each with its own individual characteristics. The absence of computer-based production and automation results in instruments that are completely and inherently unique: Different examples of the same model will exhibit sonic and cosmetic character particular to that individual instrument. The luthier's at the Yairi factory are master craftsman who build instruments from start to finish. As opposed to an assembly-line manufacturing facility, the Yairi factory produces limited-run, detailed guitars that feel and sound \"special\". Guitars that are hand-crafted for tone and playability.\n\nTaylor - Taylor Guitars is a leading maker of acoustic guitars for the mid-price and high-end market. The company produces over 40,000 instruments a year that range from the three-quarter size \"Baby Taylor,\" retailing for under $500, to more than 60 different full-size models that start at $1,200 and go up to $10,000 and beyond. The Taylor Guitar Company began in of 1973, when two young men Kurt Listug and Bob Taylor started out doing instrument repairs and then moved up to making guitars. In 1976, the company's guitars were sold to outside dealers for the first time when Kurt Listug visited music stores in Los Angeles with a selection of the firm's instruments. Among other features, the early Taylor guitars had bolt-on, low-profile necks, which allowed for easy repair, and were made in several different neck widths. After more than a quarter-century in business, Taylor Guitars had become one of the best-known makers of acoustic guitars in the world. Esteemed for their quality and technical innovation, the company's instruments were played by many famous musicians, as well as thousands of others who prized their clear tone and ease of use.\n\nYamaha - Yamaha was founded in 1887 by Torakusu Yamaha. It was named Nippon Gakki Company, Limited and produced pianos and reed organs. In October 1987, on the 100th anniversary, its name was changed to The Yamaha Corporation. Yamaha Corporation of America established in 1960 is located in Buena Park, California. Yamaha has become the world's largest manufacturer of musical instruments from pianos, to violins, to guitars, to woodwinds, and beyond. Yamaha isn't exactly the first company that you think of for guitars, and is never spoken of in the same sentence as Martin, Gibson, or Guild. Known more for keyboards, digital pianos and synthesizers, Yamaha, never the less, does make some excellent sounding guitars in a reasonable price range. Yamaha first began producing steel-strung acoustic guitars at the Hamamatsu Custom Shop in 1966, and the current “Compass” series boasts the thinnest neck possible in an acoustic guitar line, and indeed plays much like an electric guitar in this regard.\n\nOvation - The Ovation Guitar Company is based in Bloomfield, Connecticut, USA. Ovation primarily manufactures acoustic guitars and is a holding of Kaman Music Corporation. Ovation guitars are differentiated by their composite synthetic bowl, rather than the traditional wooden back and sides of the modern acoustic guitar as produced by luthier's starting in the late 18th century. Ovation has also produced solid body electric guitars and active basses. Developed starting in 1966 and introduced as the 'Balladeer' in February, 1967, Ovations reached the height of their popularity in the 1980s, where they were more often than not seen during live performances by touring artists if acoustic guitars were being played. Ovation guitars' synthetic bowl and early use (1971) of pre-amps, onboard equalization and piezo pickups were particularly attractive to live acoustic musicians who constantly battled feedback problems from the high volumes needed in live venues.\n\nElectric Guitars\n\nBC Rich - Brian Moore - Burns - Epiphone - Esp - Fender - G&L - Gibson - Gretsch - Hamer - Ibanez - Jackson - Parker - Washburn\n\nBC Rich - The B.C. Rich Company has its roots in a classical style guitar repair shop owned and operated by Bernardo Chavez Rico.

BC Rich started in the early 1970's. and by the 1990,s their guitars were widely used in heavy metal. The popularity of B.C. Rich instruments among metal musicians continues to the present.\n\nBrian Moore - Brian Moore was founded in 1992 as a manufacturer of high end, custom made ergonomic, electrics guitars, blending art with technology.

It provided custom replacement parts for guitars. In 1976, ESP gained a reputation as a provider of high-quality replacement parts.

His guitar, bass, and amplifier designs from the 1950s continue to dominate popular music more than half a century later. Fender and inventor Les Paul are often cited as the two most influential figures in the development of electric instruments in the 20th century.By introducing the first commercially viable solid body electric guitar, the first electric bass and countless classic amplifiers, Fender musical instruments have left their mark on jazz, blues, country, rock and many other styles of popular music.\n\nG&L - G&L is a guitar design and production company founded by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Dale Hyatt in the late 1970s.

Gretsch was founded in 1883 by Friedrich Gretsch, a young German immigrant. His Brooklyn shop was made for the manufacture of banjos, tambourines, and drums. In 1895, at the age of 39, Gretsch died, and the successful company was taken over by his son Fred.
