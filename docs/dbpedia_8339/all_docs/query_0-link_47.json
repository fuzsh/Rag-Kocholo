        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nFor those wishing to skip to the heart of the matter, just jump to the end of this article. However, as it took me quite a while to get there, you may find the provenance, and my eventual analysis worth reading first. What started out as just an interesting little blog - from something I unearthed in my harp guitar To Do folders - ended up as an extensive and pretty exhaustive 10,000 word research project, so I published it here on the more permanent site  even though it has less to do with actual harp guitars than standard guitars.\n\nAs this site is of course harp guitar-specific, I should note that I am going decidedly off topic and referring to what nearly everyone today considers the standard 12-String Guitar. In other words, the regular steel string guitar with 6 double courses (the 4 lowest strung in octaves, the top 2 in unison)  not a 12 string harp guitar such as a Dyer with 6 on the neck and 6 subs.\n\nSo what does the 12-string guitar, popularized by dozens of memorable players from Leadbelly to Leo Kottke, have to do with harp guitars in fact, two completely different families of harp guitars?\n\nI propose that the ubiquitous 12-string guitar may have partly evolved from and been inspired by two previously overlooked instruments: An early non-floating-strings instrument called the harp-guitar, and the true harp guitar with floating strings.\n\nAll the previous theories I could locate were that the 12-string was inspired by double-course guitars from south of the border, like the baja sexto, or developed in the workshop of some American factory like Oscar Schmidt. Michael Simmons has written a couple articles over the years on the 12-string which are worth noting. Probably the latest in 12-string circles is the increasing awareness by esoteric collectors and players of the little-known early (very early) Holzapfel 12-strings. Then there are the ongoing studies of obscure New York Italian makers.\n\nAugust 22, 1896: TMTR: A New Musical Novelty\n\nThis article announces that Browns patent (at left) has now been granted. The pear-shaped body is described as having the general form of guitars of ye olden time  (whatever thats supposed to mean)  which was probably intended to add to its novel aspect. It then repeats the details of the stringing and tuning.\n\nNext is the claim that this arrangement makes it much more simple than on the guitar, (due to) the air being picked with the thumb on the double strings, while the accompaniment is played with the fingers, and thumb when unoccupied, upon all the available strings. This verbiage is taken from Browns own patent, though the phrase must be looked at in context  for the amateur guitar style was then much as described; the thumb played a simple melody, with fingers playing a (generally higher) simple accompaniment. In other words, the point is not that Browns new instrument was the first to introduce this style, but that it was created to better take advantage of the basic style. As this somewhat confusing point occurs throughout several years of advertising (Grunewald still using it in 1904), and to confirm that this was indeed the playing practice of amateur guitarists at the time (I am no expert), I went to the source: Jeffrey Noonan, author of The Guitar in America. No one has studied the early literature and music more than Noonan. He summed it up for me thusly: The bass solo style was very common for amateur players - even as late as the 1920s The Cadenza (or maybe Crescendo) published some solo arrangements by Sophocles Papas (as close to Segovia as you could get) - and every one of his arrangements was in the bass solo style. Lots of the late 19th-century solos in the magazines were in this style and were clearly aimed at the amateur player.\n\nThough Brown did not pass up the opportunity to tout the increased tone and volume of nearly double that of the guitar (after all, every new builder and inventor did this routinely), the crux of his invention was the added octave strings on the 4 low courses. But again, this was not to create a novel means of introducing a strange new playing style  the thumb melody  but to expand the musical range of what was already a common amateur playing style (the bass solo style).\n\nThis is made clearer in the next sentence, when the writer explains that the fingering is much more simple than upon the guitar, for by means of the four extra treble strings, one is enabled to render almost any ordinary piece of music with the left hand in the first position, there being two and one-half octaves under the hand in this position (italics mine). Get it? Theyre describing the characteristic well known to 12-string players  that either the low or high octave of the 4 lowest courses can be accented (naturally occurring depending on whether a down-stroke or up-stroke is used on the pair of octave strings); or they can even be separately plucked. Browns idea then is to just leave the left hand in first position, period, and let the high octave string in those 4 low courses extend the melody upwards. This is assuming the amateur player can get the hang of this tricky transposition! Brown seems quite confident, as the article claims On the guitar there are eighteen frets, while only four or five are needed upon the harp-guitar. There you have it! It goes on for a couple more paragraphs about how much easier it will be to play all the popular airs and such.\n\nThe tone is given additional press (autoharp or mandolin plus guitar), with volume being nearly double that of the guitar. Strange that there is still no allusion to a harp tone, as that is the name of the new instrument, and the only term used by Brown in his patent. With nary a mention of mandolin or autoharp effects in Browns patent, I would propose that the TMTR writer perhaps saw and heard an actual instrument, and drew their own conclusion (and a more accurate one). Next, the double instrument feature is explained a bit more, describing how by throwing a small lever it can instantly be converted into an ordinary guitar, this being accomplished by silencing the extra treble strings. The patent clearly shows and explains this device: 4 hooks on a bar mounted across the soundhole are positioned over the high strings (the ones that make it sound mandolin-like or as Brown states, harp effect). The lever linkage pulls them down out of the way, leaving just the standard 6 strings accessible in theory.\n\nFinally, we learn that two prominent manufacturers will place the instrument on the market this coming fall.\n\nBefore continuing, note that were still talking about Browns 10-string.There are two simple reasons why Brown didnt include twelve. Just like todays 12-strings, the physics of string technology dont allow a 24-25-scale steel string that can be tuned to a high b  so the octave configuration must necessarilystop at the 3rd G string. Modern 12-strings of course double the E & B for balance and to better approximate the jangle of the octave courses.Brown was only interested in extending the range of pitchin first position  so he saw no point in just adding another unison string.\n\nBack to our story:\n\nFebruary 12, 1898: TMTR: The Grunewald Harp-Guitar\n\nWhats going on? Not a month later, the trade journal again highlights the new instrument, with the same woodcut and 2 columns of hype, claiming that it is attracting considerable attention in trade and musical circles. In fact, all who have examined it are unanimous in proclaiming it to be a radical and practical improvement upon the time-honored guitar. True? There doesnt seem to be reason to totally discount the report, yet where are all the surviving instruments? Perhaps all south of the border, as the companys activity there is again specifically mentioned?\n\nThis time, in the tone department, theyre having their cake and eating it too, describing the quality of tone (that) resembles that of the mandolin and guitar, or more particularly that of the harp  Personally, I consider a mandolin and harp very different (!) - the mandolin being steel strung, high and bright with short sustain, while available harps were all gut strung and meant to ring. Note that the autoharp or mandolin clues have informed us from the beginning that Browns original instrument and the two manufacturers were almost certainly all strung in steel (or silk & steel), which at the time was intended for amateurs and not serious guitar players.\n\nThis piece ends with another reminder that the ordinary guitar is an instrument upon which comparatively few can play. It sounds like the Grunewald harp-guitar may indeed soon supersede it!\n\nApril 16, 1898:TMTR: A short blurb tells of a Grunewald agents success in Mexico and soon South America with the harp-guitar.\n\nSeptember 10, 1898: TMTR: Rene Grunewald Forging Ahead\n\nNow things are getting serious. First, theyre already talking about the now famous harp-guitar. We then learn that Grunewald is planning to aggressively market the instrument (along with his mandolins) throughout the United States, but also in Cuba and Puerto Rico (Americas new possessions). Further acclaim of the still-10-string instrument and much name-dropping regarding Grunewald mandolin testimonials follows.\n\nOctober 15, 1898: TMTR: The Harp-Guitar\n\nA month later and TMTR is really taking this seriously, insisting that The new American harp-guitar is considered by experts, soloists and amateurs as the acme of perfection. For the first time, we are told exactly how the melody will be played in first position via the paired octave strings: The air will sound in a clear treble, bass, or plainly in octaves, with great volume, by simply engaging the treble of the parallel strings with the thumb and its larger companion with the first finger. Man, can you imagine a beginner doing that with a few days practice? Theyre telling me I can pluck just the skinny string of the pair and get a melody with great volume? How many modern 12-string players can do that?!\n\nDecember 3, 1898: The Houston Daily Post: Display Ad\n\nA separate C. Grunewald store in Houston, Texas at 310 Main St. lists Harp-Guitars among its inventory.\"C\" must be Clifford, brother of Rene.\n\nApril 8, 1899: TMTR: The Harp-o-chord the Latest\n\nThis tells of Carl Browns second invention, the Harp-o-chord. Clearly, the TMTR editor is a Brown fan!\n\nSeptember 10, 1899: The Sacramento Record-Union: News Announcement\n\nA short entry announces Browns new Harp-o-chord invention, and includes who made such a success of a ten-stringed harp guitar, which he brought out some two years ago \n\nDecember 23, 1899: TMTR: A New Guitar\n\nAn interesting little press release (with a typo of 1889 in the heading, so dont get confused) from Browns firm in Columbus, Ohio, that mentions the new 10-string guitar recently invented manufactured by the New Orleans branch of the Columbus Harpochord Co.\n\nCuriously, the address given (West Bond St.) is different than the Grunewalds factory (Conti St.), so the question is: Is this a new facility unrelated to Grunewald, or simply a department of, or new location of, Grunewalds original factory? Its curious that Grunewald  surely the bigger name  isnt mentioned, nor have we heard anything of him in TMTR for over a year.\n\nIf Grunewald was indeed still the manufacturer, this would indicate that at the very end of 1899, Grunewald still had not come up with the 12-string version. However, if Grunewald was out of the picture, could he have been now creating his 12-string? And if he broke off from Brown, could he still call his 12-string version the Harp-Guitar? Whats missing is a 12-string specimen showing the label, which would presumably be under the original Brown patent.Or would it?None of the next Grunewald ads mention a patent. December, 2015: A surviving 12-string finally appeared, but it only has the Grunewald stamps, no label.\n\nIrrespective of this puzzle, note the key sentence of this notice: the claim that The New Orleans house is sending them out by the hundreds, and the sales are enormous. Again, if true, where are the surviving instruments?!\n\nAugust 19, 1900: The Houston Daily Post: Display Ad\n\nThe Houston C. Grunewald store announces Have just received new lot Harp Guitars of $10.50. There is no way to know whether these were 10-strings or 12-strings.\n\n1901-1902: Here is where our trail grows cold, as nothing further on the 10- or 12-string Brown or Grunewald (to say nothing of Gordon) harp-guitar appears in The Music Trade Review (that I have found through searching. Someone next needs to carefully read all pages of all weekly issues).\n\nThere is an ad in the S. S. Stewart Journal issues of April and May, 1901 for Grunewalds new Special Guitar,\" but this is only a 6-string guitar with their \"new improved patent combined bridge and tailpiece\" (the patent does not appear to have granted). There is no mention of their 10- or 12-strings.\n\nThe Cadenza\n\nAfter the end of the Music Trade Review 10-string write-ups above and the 1901-1902 lost years, Grunewald came back blazing with full page ads in The Cadenza for a couple years running. These were seen by most every serious guitar player in America, and various levels of amateurs. While TMTR catered to the trade, The Cadenza catered to the customers  the players.\n\nNow to wrap up the Brown>Grunewald 10>12-string guitar provenance above:\n\nTo understand what impact the above may have actually had on the development of the 12-string guitar, one needs to have an understanding of the importance and role of both The Cadenza and Music Trade Review magazines, and also their audience (readers).\n\nFor The Cadenza, nothing beats reading through the actual journals. Barring that, Jeffrey Noonans indispensable book The Guitar in America provides a great socio-musical overview. Though it was geared towards amateurs, most of these men and women were nevertheless attempting to learn to read music and play serious parlor music. In fact, a battle would often heat up over whether they should be playing only gut-strung guitars. At least as far as the Cadenza editors were concerned, steel-string guitars were loud, crude folk instruments. Yet many of their advertisers (like Grunewald) were clearing offering steel-string instruments  so the editors and columnists stated or implied views were anything but consistent! Since everyone who advertised in the magazine was given equal treatment in the Trade Department monthly columns (a useless bit of news consisting of nothing more than the overly-flowery editor parroting what they read in the submitted ads for that month), it was left up to the reader what to believe or explore in their musical pursuits. Again, its interesting to observe that the Cadenza editors were totally unfamiliar with the concept of a 12-string guitar at the turn of the last century. Its also important to note that, even though steel-strung, the Brown/Grunewald 10-string (and later, 12-string) harp guitar was clearly geared toward the then-common thumb melody (bass solo) style of much of the Cadenzas readership. The fact that it did not appear to catch on (judging simply from the extremely small number of surviving instruments) doesnt mean that awareness and attributes of the new steel-string double-course guitar did not become widely known from this exposure.\n\nIn fact, the 10>12-string harp guitar got a potentially much bigger boost  and for a completely different audience  in The Music Trade Review. I dont know the circulation numbers for either Cadenza or TMTR, but they were the primary periodicals available to the rapidly growing population of fretted instrument aficionados, and must have had some impact. For TMTRs part, they were serving the retail side of things. Again, while the lack of specimens makes it appear that few of the small to large music stores across the U.S. fell for the bait and ordered the Grunewald instruments, its likely that the retailers, and more importantly, the other manufacturers, became familiar with the concept. How could any guitar maker or factory not notice such a heavily-marketed new guitar invention?\n\nBy a strange, if frustrating, coincidence, it was during the 1901-1902 lost Grunewald years  when no advertisements appeared and Grunewalds harp-guitar morphed from 10 to 12-string  that our new cast of characters appear to have entered the fray. Whether any of them saw the Grunewald hype in either the Cadenza or TMTR, well never know  but I doubt it unlikely.\n\nA final observation on the Brown and Grunewald 10-strings: Ironically, after doing everything they possibly can to distance their superior instrument from the lowly 6-string, they mention the patented device that hooks all 4 octave strings and lowers them out of the way, so that the player can just go back to playing their standard guitar (from harp to guitar). Apparently, they felt they could have their cake and eat it too! But it does illustrate that they truly considered the normal guitar and their 10-string harp-guitar two distinctly different instruments (as do many modern 6 & 12-string guitarists today  I know I do).\n\nTo re-cap:\n\nEvolution and Rise of the American 12-String Guitar\n\n(as postulated by Gregg Miner)\n\nFeb 8, 1896: Carl E. Brown, a musical instrument inventor, submits a patent for a new 10-string guitar he dubs the Harp-Guitar. It has a pear-shaped body; the 4 low courses are strung in octaves, while the 2 high strings are single. There is a lever to grab the 4 high extra strings and move them out of playing position. He already has a prototype hanging in a local music store.\n\nSep 22, 1896: The patent is granted.\n\nFall of 1896: He engages two different firms to build it  the Hamilton Gordon Company and the Rene Grunewald Company. Gordon will make theirs in the shape of the patent design; Grunewald will make the body with a traditional guitar shape. Each is called The Harp-Guitar, licensed and protected under Browns patent.\n\n1896-to-1899: In The Music Trade Review, Browns invention is mentioned 3 times, the Gordon version is shown once, and the Grunewald is featured at least 6 times.\n\nc.1900-1901:\n\nSometime between late 1898 and late 1902, Grunewald has doubled the two remaining high strings, creating a production 12-string guitar, still called The Harp-Guitar, and possibly still under the original Brown patent (this still remains unanswered).\n\nDuring this same period (by the end of December, 1900), Holzapfel & Beitel has begun building similar (though larger-bodied) 12-string guitars. They may have gotten the idea from first building double-course harp guitars.\n\nMeanwhile, C. Bruno & Sons has also introduced a 12-strings-on-the-neck harp guitar, though not a simple, single-neck 12-string.\n\nIn addition, Bohmann builds a custom 10-strings-on-the-neck harp guitar by c.1900, and possibly as early as c.1895. Bruno also built at least one 10-strings-on-the-neck harp guitar seemingly patterned after Grunewalds 10-string headstock design.\n\nThe 12-string Grunewald harp guitar continues to be advertised (in The Cadenza) and marketed through at least 1904. Meanwhile, Joseph Behee in Kansas introduces his 12-string lyre guitars.\n\nThis continual visibility of the Grunewald instrument (first 10-, then 12-string version), through both The Music Trade Review and The Cadenza (the main business and consumer periodicals, respectively) feeds the awareness and interest of both musicians/customers and other manufacturers.\n\nIndependent of the Brown/Grunewald double-course harp-guitars in name only, builders of true harp guitars incorporate doubled courses in their extravagant creations (and perhaps only later transitioning this stringing over to single-neck guitars).\n\nHolzapfels instruments and potential Italian one-offs inspire inspire the eventual Oscar Schmidt 12-strings, while Lyon & Healy (and others) make instruments like the parlor-size Grunewald but eschew the old harp-guitar naming gimmick, taking 10 and 12 strings on the neck into the mainstream.

Feb, 1896 Files patent for his 10-string \"harp guitar\" Somewhere in this timeframe, he built a harp guitar with 10 strings on the neck (in Brown/Grunewald configuration) Provenance to be determined\n\nv\n\nv\n\nv\n\nApr, 1896 An instrument is on display in a music store Aug, 1896 TMTR publishes an extensive explanation of the invention Sep, 1896 His patent is granted Jun, 1897 TMTR announces \"The Gordon Harp-Guitar\" (licensed from Brown's patent) Oct, 1897 TMTR announces the Grunewald harp guitar, licensed from Brown's patent Jan, 1898 TMTR pictures the instrument, seen to be figure-8-shaped Apr, 1898 TMTR reports that the harp guitar is successful in Mexico and South America Sep, 1898 TMTR reports that the harp guitar will be marketed in Cuba and Puerto Rico ?, 1900 Presumably still producing, and at some point in this timeframe, they switch from 10 strings to 12 TMTR article about a 24-string harp guitar (with a likely 12-string neck) c.1900 Built a 12-string (single neck, 6 course) guitar in 1900 and c.1900 built at least 2 harp guitars with 12 strings on the neck Built a 10-stringed neck harp guitar late 1901 The 1901-1902 catalog introduces the \"1901\" harp guitar with 12-string neck Feb, 1902 Rented a new or used 12-string guitar Continued to produce it until at least 1914 Dec, 1902 Cadenza ad now shows 12-string version 12-strings from this period are known Feb, 1904 Brochure postmark shows that the 12-string is still being marketed\n\nAdditional Observations:\n\nWhat about 12-strings south of the border? What about Italian and other European immigrant influences?\n\nI havent addressed the influence of Mexican or Latin American double-strung guitars of various types on the 12-string because, A) Im not familiar with much of the provenance on the subject, and B) have a gut feeling that they werent as a big part of the story as has sometimes been implied. But I really dont know. As I have mentioned a couple times above: from the provenance we have in hand  the editorial text of all the periodicals  it seems clear to me that even if some form of Mexican double-strung guitars were migrating back and forth along the southern border, general United States musical instrument wholesale/retail industry  and their customers  were all but completely ignorant about such Mexican or Latin American double-strung guitars; nor was anyone among them interested in, or familiar with, the history of double-strung Baroque, and other early, gut-strung guitars. A double-strung guitar was a completely new novelty in 1900. I do find it curious that Lyon & Healys first catalog 12-string was lumped in with an unusual 11-string, both as Mexican style guitars. I find it hard to believe that the firm was unfamiliar with the Grunewald instrument perhaps because they realized that it was silly to call it the harp-guitar and were initially unsure how to market it?\n\nI also hear occasional rumors of 12-strings by New York Italian makers, though have seen nothing dated. With the continuing discoveries on eBay and elsewhere of old catalogs, perhaps new surprises within dated catalogs will found.\n\nWere still left with two nagging questions, though important perhaps only to diehard American guitar historians or 12-string geeks:\n\nA) Who built Americas first true \"12-string guitar\"?\n\nB) Who/what popularized the instrument?\n\nUntil we find more date provenance on both Grunewald and H&B (not to mention Bruno, etc.), Id say the first question is a coin toss. For now, Id go with saying both of them built their slightly different versions c. 1900. As to the latter, I would argue that Grunewalds was far more visible to a wider audience, but that Holzapfels was (and instigated) a more modern instrument.In other words, both are key figures  with Brown>Grunewald getting points for the earlier invention and evolution, while Holzapfel can claim an instrument worthy of todays collectors and players.\n\nHowever, my personal pet theory is that the first true American 12-string guitar may not, in fact, have been our familiar single-neck 12-string guitar at all, but a Holzapfel & Beitel (or Bruno) harp guitar with doubled courses on the neck."
