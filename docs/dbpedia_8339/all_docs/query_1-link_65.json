        "text": "good luck Horax.. Washburn makes good guitars, the problem with them is the affordable series and higher end models use the same name... although they realized this over sight and now they use Lyon and Oscar Schmidt (Gibson = Epiphone, Fender = Squier) people already perceive them as not good quality import guitars.\n\nI have 4 Washburn's 2 bass and 2 electrics. they are hidden gems.\n\nthere is a HM WI64 red on ebay - www.ebay.com/itm/141048154062?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649 $100 + shipping\n\nI saw Delta king OE30 on ebay - www.ebay.com/itm/121100469961?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649 maybe you can get better price on used market.\n\nI saw one of those Oscar Schmidt Delta Kings on craigslist, and while I know it's not great, the guy was letting it go for $80. He had already sold it before I called. If I'm not mistaken, there is the OE30, and the OE30B, and I think the \"B\" stands for binding. This guy had the OE30B, and it was black, with binding, and immaculate. Even if it were crap, it was gorgeous, and at $80, upgrading was still within the range where it's not downright silly. There is another on Craigslist for $100 but without the binding, it was not nearly as attractive.\n\nI have two Washburn products, though, an accoustic 12 string and a WI64, and at least with those two, they are very high quality guitars.\n\nSince I've started my semi-hollow search, I've fallen in love with the youtube videos of the washburn HB-30 and HB-35. The Delta Kings sound very similar, but the one thing I was wary about was the bolt on neck.\n\nSomething about 335's with bolt on's just doesn't seem right.\n\nFOr those interested, ebay has a seller who has about 15 blue burst flame Delta Kings for $257 out the door with free shipping.\n\nA bit high...if it was a Washburn I would have grabbed it.\n\nIt's funny, I own a Rick 330, but I never really consider it a hollow body. It is, of course, but I think of it as its own entity, with its own unique sound. I think it would be fun to find something along the lines of a 335 as well, especially if I could find a bargain.\n\nOscar Schmidt OE-30s are decent guitars if you want a low priced semihollowbody and don't mind a bolt-on neck. They were quite popular on another website some years back when a big box retailer was blowing them out. It seemed like everyone that wanted a decent cheap guitar was buying them.\n\nThe bolt-on neck thing reminds me of late '60s to mid '70's Japanese imports. But the OE-30 has better pickups.\n\nMy personal experience with one in a music store a few years back was positive. Nice neck, adequate pickups and decent workmanship. If I didn't already own an DeArmond Starfire Special as well as an Epi Dot, Casino and Joe Pass I might have bought it.\n\nOther low buck semis (especially used) are Kona and Jay Turser. Some of the Tursers are nice. The Konas I've seen were very much hit or miss with some being surprisingly good. I think that the Konas are mainly sold out of pawn shops and hole-in-the-wall music stores where many are just pulled out of a box and hung on the wall whether they need setting up or not.\n\nImho, a semi-hollow body is mostly, first and foremost, an electric guitar. They sound terrible unamplified. That being said, I don't see a problem with a bolt on neck. If anything, it will make neck angle adjustments much easier than a full acoustic.\n\nSome of the Taylor (American made ones) acoustics are suppose to have a bolt-on neck. It apparently does not hurt the sound of tha acoustic. Lots of folks like the sound.\n\n(BTW,I'm told some of the Mexican made Taylors now have a glued on dovetailed neck, like most acoustics.)\n\nMy buddy has a OE30 in black, no binding. It's an okay guitar for the $ he got it -- $150 ish. It was barely used too. Good luck in your search... I had this semi-hollow/hollow itch (still will have it till I get a ES355) but also look at some Ibanez Artcores they are excellent guitars.\n\nA very good friend of mine has an Oscar Schmidt 335 copy that he has had for a few years and I'm sorry, I don't know the model name/number.\n\nI did the setup for him when he got it and it required quite a bit of work. The frets needed leveling badly and they had very ragged edges. Also the pickups and electronics were really bargain basement. I had to replace the nut as well as it was cut so poorly that it was unsalvageable. Surprisingly, we found the tuners to be quite good.\n\nI built a new Belden wiring harness for it with CTS pots, NOS oil and paper caps and Switchcraft toggle and input jack. That helped a lot but the pickups were still very lackluster.\n\nEventually, he popped for a pair of my favorite PAF style humbuckers, made by my good friend Tom Short out in LA and now I would put that guitar up against a genuine 335 without batting an eye.\n\nhttp://tomshortshandmadepickups.com/tombucker.html\n\nI've been trying to get another one of these. I had one for a while but gave it to my nephew and he loves it. Theres one on craigslist for $100 up in Kingston NY right now but the guy hasn't gotten back to me with a meeting place.
