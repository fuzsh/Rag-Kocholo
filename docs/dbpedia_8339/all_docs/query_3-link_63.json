        "text": "Can Reagan do Sound of Freedom Money?\n\nThe Reagan film is opening in theaters August 30th. There is zero chance the critics on Rotten Tomatoes will praise the film. It won't be considered for the Oscars; everyone knows that. There is a wall between the two Americas - a very thick, impenetrable wall. Yet, an industry, a counterculture, is growing outside of what Hollywood is now—an insular...\n\nRead more\n\nShorts Exclusive: HollyShorts Announces Nominees\n\nOver the last 9 days, HollyShorts has presented a bevy of new films at the 20th annual film festival.

So far, what is getting my attention are the director-led visionary films that might be good enough to dominate the race. If we just start with Denis Villeneuve's moving painting, Dune 2, which is unlike anything we've ever seen on the big screen. And yes, its...\n\nRead more\n\nAngelina Jolie in Telluride, Queer Guadagnino’s Best Film, Joker Surprising and Dark\n\nRebecca Ford gets the deets on all the Venice happenings from Alberto Barbera at the end of this month, starting with Joker Folie a Deux: Yes, I think so. If you expect just a second part of the previous one, exactly the same kind of narrative and situation and so on, you are wrong, because the theme is much darker....\n\nRead more\n\n“Gena Forever”\n\nIn July of 2023, I interviewed Aubrey Plaza for Emily the Criminal. What does this have to do with Gena Rowlands? I’m going to ask you to stick with me for a moment. While chatting about the film, we ventured off and spoke briefly about another film that she starred in, Black Bear. Black Bear is a strange and wondrous...\n\nRead more\n\nOscar Flashback: The Blacklists and the Hollywood Ten\n\nI promise to shelve the politics on this site from now on, but I did want to do a little deep dive into the Blacklists and the Communist scare of the 1940s and 1950s, in case some of you didn't know what that was or why it matters today. As John Nolte writes about in his column today, mentioning HUAC,...\n\nRead more\n\nHamptons International Film Festival to Close 32nd Edition with East Coast Premiere of Marielle Heller’s ‘Nightbitch’\n\nHamptonsFilm announced today the 32nd annual edition of the Hamptons International Film Festival presented by Artemis Rising Foundation will screen Marielle Heller’s NIGHTBITCH as its Closing Night film on Sunday, October 13, with festival programming continuing through Monday, October 14.

Yes, a story dropped about me in the Hollywood Reporter. No, I'm not going to read it. You can read my response here at my Substack if you're interested. Instead, I'd like to write about telling the truth and why it matters. I've heard that a publicist interviewed by THR spoke his or her own mind when asked...\n\nRead more\n\n2025 Oscar Predictions: The Best Actress Race is On [POLL]\n\nThe Oscar race will begin in just two weeks, when the Telluride and Venice Film Festivals get underway. Shortly thereafter will be Toronto, New York and others. We call this the \"film festival\" phase. Unfortunately, that's mostly what the Oscar race is now.
