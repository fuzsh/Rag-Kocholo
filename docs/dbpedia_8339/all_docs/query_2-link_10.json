        "text": "American manufacturer and importer of string instruments\n\nWashburn Guitars is an American brand and importer of guitars, mandolins, and other string instruments, originally established in 1883 in Chicago, Illinois. The Washburn name is controlled by U.S. Music Corp., a subsidiary of Canadian corporate group Exertis|JAM.[1]\n\nCorporate history\n\n[edit]\n\n1864-1940\n\n[edit]\n\nLyon & Healy began in 1864 as a partnership of businessmen George W. Lyon and Patrick J. Healy, acting as the Chicago outlet for Boston sheet music publisher Oliver Ditson and Company. By 1865, Lyon & Healy had expanded into reed organs and some small instruments. The company achieved independence by 1880, and around 1888 the company launched fully into fretted and plucked instruments (guitars, mandolins, banjos, ukuleles and zithers)[2] under the \"George Washburn\" brand, which was Lyon's first and middle name.[3] Lyon & Healy 1898 catalog listed 28 different styles of \"Washburn\" guitars, ranging from $15 to $145.[3]\n\nTracing the history of any particular instrument of this period presents many obstacles. Not only did the Lyon & Healy company often change designs to follow the rapidly evolving consumer demand, but the company also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services, including decorating instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. As well, they built instruments for other retailers and distributors under various house brands, and outsourced construction of some models.\n\nIn 1912, Washburn introduced the Lakeside Jumbo guitar, which some consider the first dreadnought-sized guitar.[4] It bridged the gap between smaller-bodied \"parlor\" guitars of the late 19th and early 20th century and modern-day dreadnought and jumbo acoustic guitars.\n\nGeorge Lyon retired from the company in 1889 (died 1894). Patrick Healy then led the company into a period of major expansion, beginning with a larger new factory and improved mass-production techniques, and soon dominated the domestic market.[5] Their 1892 catalog claimed to manufacture 100,000 instruments annually. Healy died 1905.\n\nBy the 1920s, Lyon & Healy faced growing competition from other instrument manufacturers as well as from the rise of other forms of entertainment, particularly film and the gramophone. Lyon & Healy gradually shifted manufacturing chores onto wholesaler Tonk Brothers, to whom they sold the guitar portion of the business in 1928, continuing to produce their own lines of harps, pianos, and organs.\n\nTonk Brothers turned to manufacturer J.R. Stewart Company to purchase and operate the massive factory, but this transition proved problematic and Stewart went bankrupt in 1930. Some of the Stewart assets were acquired by the Regal Musical Instrument Company, which had purchased the \"Regal\" brand name in 1908 from Lyon & Healy (who acquired it in 1905). Regal was chosen to reopen the Washburn factory (producing Regal instruments as well). Though the Washburn brand was preserved, it never regained its preeminence, and by the early 1940s had declined to nothing.\n\nRevival\n\n[edit]\n\nAn unbroken lineage is often alluded to by Washburn International, in press releases and advertising materials, and on the company website:\n\nWashburn has been building stringed instruments since 1883. â€¦ 130 years of history is at the root of our strong foundation building high quality instruments.[6]\n\nHowever, there is no direct connection between the original Washburn brand and the modern Washburn International.\n\nIn the early 1960s, retail store The Chicago Guitar Gallery hired Rudolf \"Rudy\" Schlacher, a young German violin builder, as a repair technician. A few years later, Schlacher opened The Sound Post[7][8] in Evanston, Illinois, to focus on guitars. He soon realized the sales potential for quality instruments of modest cost.\n\nTom Beckmen and his wife Judy Fink Beckmen in 1972 left careers as music salesman and teacher (respectively) to launch a wholesale music business in Los Angeles, Beckmen Musical Instruments. It was Beckmen Music that resurrected the Washburn name, and beginning in 1974 applied it to a series of quality imported acoustic guitars, made in Japan by Terada, as well as a selection of mandolins and banjos.\n\nFritz Tasch, Rudy Schlacher and Rick Johnstone, as Fretted Industries, Inc., acquired the Washburn name in 1977 (for $13,000) when the Beckmens took their business a different direction,[9] and so the Washburn name was returned to Chicago. With assistance from Ikutaro Kakehashi (founder of Roland Corporation), Schlacher was able to find instrument factories in Japan that could meet the desired standards.[10]\n\nFretted Industries acquired other lines as well, such as Oscar Schmidt autoharps.\n\nSchlacher bought out Johnstone in 1987, and changed the company name to Washburn International. A stateside manufacturing operation was opened in 1991 for higher-end, short-run, and one-off instruments, as well as development and prototyping. That year, a Chicago Tribune article[11] confidently places Washburn \"among the top three guitar manufacturers in the world,\" behind only Fender and Gibson.\n\nOn December 15, 2002, Washburn International announced that it had completed acquisition of U.S. Music Corporation,[12] and would be rolling its assets into that company in a reverse merger.[13] Schlacher remained as CFO, appointing Gary Gryczan to COO; Gryczan had been Washburn's CFO from 1995 through 1998. The new USM's headquarters were in Mundelein (440 E. Courtland Street), which also housed the stateside Washburn luthiery, \"the USA Custom Shop,\" previously located at Elston and Springfield avenues.\n\nSchlacher announced completion of selling USM to JAM Industries on August 24, 2009, and that he would be stepping away from his company after fully four decades.[14]\n\nWe are pleased to join forces with a strategic partner like Jam Industries, that has a long, successful history in the music industry and has been a long-term business partner with U.S. Music for more than 20 years. It has been a thrilling and rewarding 40-year ride that has allowed me to realize my dreams and goals.[15]\n\nAs R S Consulting he remained a consultant to the musical-instrument industry[16] and was an executive producer for a small-budget film[17]\n\nThe corporate offices of U.S. Music were relocated to Buffalo Grove, Illinois in 2012.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nVery few modern Washburn instruments have been built by the company itself. It has relied on outside factories and luthiers to fulfill their designs and meet public demand.\n\nThe first modern Washburn instruments were full-size acoustic guitars imported from Japan by Beckmen Music. The 1974 range included one folk-style guitar (W-200) and eight dreadnoughts of increasing quality and decoration: W-240-12, W-250, W-260, W-280, W-300, W-300-12, W-500, W-600.\n\nUnder Rudy Schlacher, most Washburn models were ordered in runs of 200 units, rather than ongoing production; if sales went well, further runs might be ordered. This application of just-in-time manufacturing (or lean manufacturing) kept the company from needing to warehouse and liquidate overproduction, improving profitability. As a result, Washburn models (acoustic or electric) sometimes became difficult to locate between production runs.\n\nThe first Washburn electric guitars were the Wing Series models, offered 1978â€“1984. These instruments featured innovative push-pull split humbuckers, brass hardware and inlays, and neck-through construction. Some early Wing Series were produced by Yamaki, one Japanese manufacturer of Washburn acoustic guitars.\n\nBy 1991, production of Washburn instruments had shifted almost entirely to Korea, built by Samick. When Samick opened their Cileungsi, Indonesia, facility in 1992, this factory also began to produce Washburn-branded instruments, generally identifiable by an \"SI-\" serial number prefix.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2000 Washburn housed the USA Custom Shop in a factory at Elston and Springfield avenues. Grover Jackson ran production for the first half of the 1990s and Larry English ran production for the second half of the 1990s.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2001, ten models of acoustic guitar were built for Washburn in the United States, five by Tacoma Guitars (Tacoma, Washington) and five by Bourgeois Guitars (Lewiston, Maine).\n\nWashburn brought out a line of four USA-made dreadnoughts, available from 2002 to 2008. These were the D-78, D-80, D-82, and D-84. (All had the \"-SW\" suffix, for \"solid wood,\" indicating that no laminate wood was employed.)\n\nIn 2012, when JAM Industries declined to renew the lease on the Mundelein facility, the Washburn luthiery closed. At the time, the Washburn facility was the ninth-largest employer in the village (the third-largest business), providing 180 jobs.[18] The stated intent was to reopen at a smaller building in Buffalo Grove (1000 Corporate Grove Drive)[19] but this did not materialize. A few Washburn models (particularly the N4) are produced in Cincinnati.\n\nAs of 2017, primary production has largely shifted from Korea to factories in Indonesia and China.\n\nInnovations\n\n[edit]\n\nMost widely known for its guitars (both electric and acoustic), Washburn also makes electric basses, acoustic basses, banjos, mandolins, travel guitars, ukuleles, and amplifiers, as well as accessories including guitar cases, clothing, tuners, and straps.[20]\n\nIn the 1980s, Washburn introduced the Festival Series of acoustic/electric guitars (the EA series, for \"electrified acoustic\"). They were thinner than standard acoustic guitars and less acoustically resonant by design, thereby reducing susceptibility to feedback, a significant problem using acoustic or electrified acoustic guitars in large-venue performances. The addition in later models of sound slots (rather than the traditional round soundhole), a patented innovation, further reduced the possibility of feedback, and the guitars quickly became the go-to stage acoustic for artists such as Jimmy Page, George Harrison, and Bob Dylan. In the early 1990s when MTV introduced their Unplugged series, hardly a show went by without seeing a Festival Series guitar. The design also lent itself well to acoustic basses, and Washburn's AB Series quickly became popular both for its look and its tone, whether amplified or unplugged.\n\nIn recent years, Washburn licensed several guitar construction features:\n\nthe Buzz Feiten Tuning System â€” a corrected temperation tuning formula, using a compensated nut and saddle to minimize the inherent intonation problems of the Western tuning formula. The BFTS was first used by Washburn in 1995 on a very few models, then increasingly with the introduction of the WI-64 (1999), and was entirely phased out after the 2010 production year. At its peak, this system came standard on U.S.-made Washburn guitars and basses and the better imports.[21]\n\nStephen's Extended Cutaway â€” a unique bolt-on neck joint invented by luthier Stephen Davies to allow greater unrestricted access for a guitarist's fretting hand. Used primarily with the Nuno Bettencourt signature models, the SEC has also been employed with acoustic guitars, and remains on some current (2017) models of the Parallaxe line.[22]\n\nVoice Contour Control (VCC) â€” a special potentiometer and wiring, intended to allow access to the entire range of tones \"between\" the one-coil (\"single-coil\" mode) and two-coil sounds of a humbucking pickup, rather than one or the other.[23]\n\nVCC is similar to coil splitting, in that it changes the tone of a humbucking pick-up to that of a single coil, but it does it by turning the tone knob â€¦ without the hum normally associated with single coils.\n\nDesigned by Trevor Wilkinson, the VCC is no longer in use by Washburn, but is available in various models of Vintage (UK) guitar as the \"Roll Control\" knob.\n\nModel number suffixes\n\n[edit]\n\nOver the past 40 years, Washburn has accreted a system of identifying some of the most pertinent features in many of its acoustic instruments and some of the electric. Additional letters may be used to indicate the instrument's finish. While imperfectly applied, and sometimes awkwardly long, this can often be useful in identifying a given guitar.\n\nsuffix â€”\n\nC - cutaway\n\nDL - deluxe (generally, a standard model with a few upgraded features)\n\nE - electric (i.e., built-in pickup)\n\nK - kit (i.e., includes case or gig bag)\n\nLH - left-handed\n\nM - mahogany top\n\nQ - quilt maple top\n\nR - rosewood\n\nS - solid-wood top (rather than laminate)\n\nSP - spalt maple top\n\nSW - solid wood used throughout\n\nV - vibrato (on electric guitars)\n\nThis often combines with the prefix to tell a guitar's story. For example, the WLG110SWCEK indicates that it's part of the Woodline series (WL-), likely top of the line (110), Grand Auditorium (G) size, all solid wood, cutaway, piezo pickup, and originally included a case.\n\nPast and present models\n\n[edit]\n\nAny given series may have as few as only one model.\n\nElectric guitars\n\n[edit]\n\nprefix Series a.k.a. type duration comments J Jazz hollowbody archtop 1989-date HB Hollow Body semihollow archtop 1981-date B Bantam headless bass 1984-1986 no connection to 1990s Bantams GB Bantam headless bass/guitar 1984-1986 no connection to 1990s Bantams G Bantam headless guitar 1984-1986 no connection to 1990s Bantams CT Centurian carved-top 1997-2002 P Centurian carved-top 1997-2002 E Centurian carved-top 2001-2002 CP Culprit 1998-2000 Dime Dimebag Darrell ML-style 1995-2004 signature line G Force 1983-1988 CS Hard Rock 2000-2002 NX Nextar 2002-2003 Stephen's Extended Cutaway PT Poptop 2000-2002 RS Hard Rock Rogue Star 2000-2002 WG Hard Rock 2000-2002 WR Hard Rock 2000-2002 HM 2008-2010 Series, not prefix WI Idol 1999-2010 WM HM 2008-2010 no connection to 1990s WM WV Wavepoint; Vee 2008-2010 WIN Idol 2010-2014 JB Jennifer Batten 2000-2004 signature line KC Chicago 1989-1991 LS Laredo Legacy; Silverado S copy 1992-1994 LT Laredo Legacy; Silverado T copy 1993-1994 MR Magnum 1997-2000 BT Maverick BillyT; Bantam 1995-2002 all 24.75\" scale WM Maverick 1997-2002 USA build; no connection to 2008 WM DD Maya Dan Donegan 2005-2010 signature line MG Mercury 1992-1996 NC Nick Catanese 2005-2009 signature line N Nuno Bettencourt 1990-date Stephen's Extended Cutaway PS Paul Stanley 1998-2016 signature line RX RX 2011-date SI Scott Ian 2005-2010 signature line A Stage 1980-1986 EC Extended Cutaway 1988-1991 Stephen's Extended Cutaway SS Steve Stevens 1993-1994 AF Tour Ace Frehley 1987-1988 signature line FV Tour Flying Vee 1984-1985 HM Tour 1985-1987 RR Tour 1985-1987 RS Tour 1987-1988 WP Tour Paul copy 1987-1991 WT Tour 1984-1994 Wing 1978-1985 SB Wing Reissue 1991-1995 X X 2002-2010 XM XM 2011-date S Sonamaster 2016-date PX Parallaxe 2013-date PXM Parallaxe 2013-date PXS Parallaxe 2013-date PXL Parallaxe LP shape 2013-date TB Tabu 2009 WB Lyon S copy 1994-1995\n\nBasses\n\n[edit]\n\nprefix Series a.k.a. type duration comments B 1983-1985 B 1992 Wing Scavenger 1980-1981 B Stage 1981-1984 B Stage 1981-1984 B Force P copy 1983-1986 B ABT 1987-1989 XS Axxess 1990-1991 BB Bantam 2006-2010 XB Bantam 1994-2006 MB Mercury 1992-1993 MB Mercury 2002-2006 RB RB 1999-2003 WP Shadow P copy 1997-1999 WJ Shadow J copy 1997-1999 S Status 1000 1988-1993 SHB Stu Hamm 2012-2016 signature T Taurus 2002-date AB 2004-2006 Bootsy Collins Space Bass 2002-2006 CB 2007-2010 DB 2000 Force 2002-2010 M 2002-2003 WB Idol 2007-2010 SB Sonamaster 2016-date AB Festival Acoustic 1988-date\n\nAcoustic guitars\n\n[edit]\n\nprefix Series shape duration type comments RW Roger Waters 2004 acoustic/electric RW300 signature (USA) D dreadnought 1978-2010 WD dreadnought 2011-date R 125th Anniversary parlor 2008-2009 WSJ 125th Anniversary southern jumbo 2008-2009 D southern jumbo 1985-2000 F folk 1978-2010 WF folk 2012-date WG grand auditorium 2011-date J jumbo 1991-2010 SJ southern jumbo 2004-2005 WB baby jumbo 2007-2010 WJ jumbo 2011-date PS Paul Stanley dreadnought 2007 PS Paul Stanley folk 2007 PR Prairie State 1920s 2002-2003 DC dreadnought 1987-1994 Stephen's Extended Cutaway\n\nEndorsers\n\n[edit]\n\nWashburn uses the mechanism of endorsements, where:\n\nManufacturer provides custom-shop instrument that suits the artist best, for free (or even paying artist).\n\nArtists promotes his or her usage of that instrument and advertises manufacturer company.\n\nThe current list of Washburn Signature endorsers.\n\nStandard Washburn Endorsers.\n\nProduct lineup\n\n[edit]\n\n2017 Signature Lines\n\n[edit]\n\nNuno Bettencourt models are flagshipped by the American hand-made N4. The N4 is a small reverse-headstock \"super-strat\" that features the Stephen's Extended Cutaway neck joint for easy access to the higher frets. It is outfitted with a Bill Lawrence and a Seymour Duncan pickup, and a licensed Floyd Rose-type tremolo. The N1 and N2 are production (budget) models of this line, factory-built in Korea, and feature standard bolt-on necks and lower-grade pickups and tremolo systems. The N3 (discontinued) was also produced in Korea and sported the Stephen's Extended Cutaway but used lower-grade pickups.\n\nBettencourt has endorsed several Washburn acoustic models as well. There is the N7 7-string model, and an acoustic/electric based on the Festival Series, the EA20SNB.\n\nOla Englund Solar (2013/2014): Signature model announced by Washburn in 2013 for Swedish guitarist Ola Englund of Six Feet Under, Feared, and The Haunted.[24]\n\nWarren Haynes - vocalist and guitarist, Gov't Mule, The Allman Brothers, and the Warren Haynes Band. The Washburn WSD5249 acoustic guitar is based on the original Washburn Solo Deluxe from 1937, which is similar in size to the popular OM shaped guitars on the market today. Adirondack Spruce top with period-correct vintage sunburst finish. Hand-shaped scalloped Adirondack Spruce bracing, solid rosewood sides, 2-piece back with vintage-inspired 1930s zipper-style inlaid herringbone stripe. The top has 3-ply ivoroid binding and the sound hole is finished by a ringed herringbone rosette.[25]\n\nPrevious signature instruments\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Dimebag Darrell\" Abbott Washburn's Dean-ML-style Dime 333 and radical Explorer-like Dime Culprit models were the most popular. The Dime 333 had a Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo; the 332 variant featured a stop-tail bridge.
