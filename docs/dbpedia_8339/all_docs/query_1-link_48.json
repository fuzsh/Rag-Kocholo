        "text": "My own renovated vintage ‘Lyra’ U.S.A. stamped parlour guitar with its distinctive deco style painted on pennant fret markers and finger plate, a descendant of the Oscar Schmidt family of parlour & acoustic guitars which were played by so many blues pioneers.\n\nThe ‘Lyra’ guitar & musical instrument brand made by the Oscar Schmidt company of Jersey City, New Jersey stretches back over a hundred years and was distributed throughout North America by wholesalers and marketing agents Charles Bruno & Sons of New York who also had a brief partnership with Christian F. Martin of Martin Guitars in 1838. The history of these guitars and their associated brands offers an intriguing insight into forging the crucible for early American music to be made on a loud small portable instrument that holds such a long lasting fascination, for both guitar players & music aficionados. Another interesting aspect in the evolution of the American parlour guitar is that its origins have a strong Germanic connection as most of the manufacturers, their associates & workers were 19th century German immigrants like Schmidt, Bruno & Martin who brought their considerable musical instrument expertise to bear upon a burgeoning U.S. market place where the demand for affordable instruments increased dramatically with the rapid population growth of North America.\n\nLyra headstock with nailed on tuners and stamped inside made in the U.S.A.\n\nMy own Lyra parlour guitar dates from the 1950s or 1960s and falls outside of the Oscar Schmidt production era which ceased at the end of the 1930s when the rights to that company name and its main brands which included Stella, Sovereign & Lyra were acquired by the Harmony Company in 1939. It appears that Harmony continued to use sporadic use the Lyra brand from 1940 onwards with Bruno & Sons still embedded as distributors. I have discovered several examples of Harmony made Lyras from the 1930s before the Oscar Schmidt factory ceased production in 1939 which leads me to conclude the Lyra brand may have been sub-licensed to Harmony prior to 1939. The Harmony Company was founded in Chicago in 1892 by William Schultz another German immigrant from Hamburg who had formerly worked for Lyon & Healy. Harmony became the largest musical instrument manufacturer in the early to the mid 20th century until they ceased production in 1975.\n\nEarly 1920s Lyra Oscar Schmidt headstock with logo and Harmony made Lyra 1940s top left. Top right is the standard 1920s-1930s distributors/agent Lighthouse label for Bruno & Sons with their brand logo “Bruno Means Security”\n\nThe identification of my own Lyra parlour guitar and the previous incarnations of this brand name is somewhat confusing as the original Oscar Schmidt brand name ‘Lyra’ was also used by Regal guitars of Indianapolis & Chicago and Kay guitars who also used the name Lyra on some of their instruments, therefore the name becomes more generic as a style of parlour guitar, as is the case to a lesser extent with Stella Oscar Schmidt’s guitar brand leader which were sometimes over labelled as Lyras. Stella guitars were also manufactured in large numbers by Harmony after 1940.\n\nThe earliest photo I can find with painted pennant fret markers is a Harmony 1940s parlour guitar (left) A 1960s ‘Galiano’ badged parlour guitar by United Guitars or Harmony (centre) Lyra by United Guitars/Harmony 1960s with the addition of dots next to the pennant fret markers.\n\nA Lyra guitar ebay purchase of seven years ago has posed more questions than answers for me as to who manufactured these guitars. As with all things from antiquity and vintage items does the clue lie within the design, which is certainly deco inspired with the painted pennant fret markers & painted finger plate design? The nailed on Waverly tuners indicates a budget priced instrument and quick turnaround production but the fret board painted markers were probably done by hand. From my own investigations I’m unable to find this style of painted pennant fret board markers on American parlour guitars prior to 1940. This certainly rules out the Oscar Schmidt factory as they ceased production in 1939. United Guitars of New Jersey seems to be the favoured maker of these guitars by others who have researched the possible origins of these instruments. The Lyra brand headstock label is the most common name found on these guitars, but other branded or badged names on these guitars are Galiano which was a Schmidt brand name as well as a myriad of other names which include Telleno, Encore, US Strad, Beltone, Superior, Sylvia, Stadium, Marwin, Leban, Elitone, Howard, Domino, Marathon,Royce, and Crusader amongst others.\n\nA 1950s ‘Beltone’ parlour guitar with slightly longer painted finger plate, many of these guitars were also unbranded and were more than likely mail order stock. This brand is also associated with Sorkin of New York who were prominent instrument wholesalers in the 1950s\n\nIn conclusion the makers of this birch ply ladder braced budget mail order type guitar may never be attributed definitively to one particular company and there is a strong possibility it was Harmony that produced these multi branded guitars in the 1950s-60s as they all have Waverly tuners also favoured by Harmony, plus the stock original hourglass shaped tailpieces on these guitars may be another Harmony indicator. These guitars also appear in the C.Bruno & Sons catalogue as late as the early 1970s and can be found in their 1971-2 catalogue American Lyra section as Model 6752, Bruno & Co were also one of the main distributors for Harmony guitars which may be yet another indication that Harmony may have been the maker. http://www.vintaxe.com/catalogs_pages/catalogs_american_lyra_1971.php\n\nA 1959 album cover “The Three Gay Guitars” by Mario Cortelli showing a Lyra centre\n\nCameron Avery the Australian musician performing here with his ‘Superior’ Lyra Parlour blues guitar in 2017. A gifted performer who has an appreciation of vintage guitars\n\nAlthough the origin of these more recent Lyra badged guitars may be in doubt, they are without doubt great little bluesy gems as they tap into the heritage of that seminal blues box tone we associate with the iconic pre war ‘Stella’ guitars of Oscar Schmidt who once said of his instruments “our samples will speak louder than words”!\n\nLucas Campbell\n\nAugust 2020\n\n15th July 2024 – U.S.A. Stamped Parlour Guitars Update\n\nThis is an important update courtesy of a Vintage Guitar Magazine article by Peter Stuart Kohman which was published in May 2021, the following year after my own article which was published in Word Press in August 2020. The two part article in Vintage Guitar Magazine now casts further light upon the origin of the “U.S.A.” stamped budget priced parlours (often badged with a multitude of different names). Thanks to the research of Mr Kohman who appears to have unearthed a music trade paper article from the 1950’s, which now confirms these small Stella like painted parlour guitars were made by The United Guitar Corporation of Jersey City, (founded in 1939 and ceased trading c1972) and were sold direct to instrument wholesalers including Buegeleisen and Jacobson (B & J) who were musical instrument distributors in New York who labelled many of these guitars under their own “B& J Serenader brand” as did The Sorkin Music Company of Manhattan with their own in house brands of “Beltone” & “Marvel”.\n\nThe United Guitar Corp. founded in 1939 (finished trading circa 1971) were in some ways the natural successors to Oscar Schmidt & Co who produced the iconic range of ‘Stella’ blues guitars, Schmidt’s main factory was also based in Jersey City, New Jersey and closed down at the end of the 1930’s. The fact that United supplied instruments mainly to wholesalers & middlemen accounts for the fact their history has been little documented within the history of guitar makers and stringed instrument manufacturers. Thank you once again Peter Stuart Kohman & Vintage Guitar Magazine for a definitive article on this company and the guitars they produced, and above all else finally identifying United as the makers of the small Stella style painted parlour guitars.\n\nLink to Vintage Guitar magazine ‘ The United Guitar Corporation’ article\n\nUnited Guitar Corporation | Vintage Guitar® magazine\n\nLucas Campbell July 2024"
