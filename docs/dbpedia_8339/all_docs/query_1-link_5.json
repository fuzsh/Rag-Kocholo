        "text": "U.S. Music Corp. announced on Aug. 24 the sale of U.S. Music to Jam Industries according to Rudy Schlacher, founder and CEO of U.S. Music Corp.\n\n“We are pleased to join forces with a strategic partner like Jam Industries, that has a long, successful history in the music industry and has been a long-term business partner with U.S. Music for more than 20 years,” said Schlacher. “It has been a thrilling and rewarding 40-year ride that has allowed me to realize my dreams and goals. That would not have been possible without the support of our customers and suppliers. It is now time to hand the reins over to a valued and trusted partner.”\n\nU.S. Music and its brands — including Washburn, Parker, Randall, Eden and Oscar Schmidt — will operate as an independent and wholly owned subsidiary of Jam Industries under the guidance of U.S. Music’s current president, Barry Ryan.\n\n“We are confident that we will be able to leverage our combined companies’ strengths and past successes to even greater results,” said Marty Golden, chairman of Jam Industries. “In addition, we will continue to tap into Rudy’s creative and intuitive instincts as well as his supplier knowledge as we make the transition to the next chapter in U.S. Music’s history.”"
