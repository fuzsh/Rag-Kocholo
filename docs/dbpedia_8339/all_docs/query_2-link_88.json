        "text": "'Washbu'rn (full name: Washburn Guitars) was established in 1883 in Chicago, Illinois. Washburn is known for many innovations in guitar building and marketing: for example, it was the first guitar manufacturer to use artist endorsements and build a large-bodied acoustic guitar. They are all hand built (some in Indonesia however) and run the gamut in price from very low to several thousand dollars. The budget lines are marketed as Lyon by Washburn and Oscar Schmidt by Washburn.\n\nWashburn is a part of U.S. Music Corporation.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Washburn guitar company started making guitars in 1883 in Chicago. The factory would later be involved and located near a musical movement in Chicago in the 1920s. The movement was a “Delta Blues” movement, which came as a result of an influx of African Americans to the area. This type of blues would change the way blues music was played, and would also change rock and roll. This blues movement helped in the success of Washburn guitars.Washburn guitars were very popular during the 1920s. The musicians played the guitars as well as making them by hand. The Washburn guitar and the blues movement that it was involved with are associated with Maxwell Street. This street is only a few blocks from the factory, and where Washburn guitars were first embraced. Today, Washburn guitars have embraced the image from its origins and the blues movement. Many famous and successful artists play Washburn instruments, and endorse Washburn instruments. Musicians like the guitar players for Matisyahu, Sum41, Avril Lavigne, CKY, and The Allman Brothers are all endorsed by Washburn.\n\nWashburn makes electric guitars, acoustic guitars, electric basses, acoustic basses, banjos, mandolins, travel guitars, and amplifiers. The company also makes accessories including guitar cases, clothing, and other parts lik\n\ne tuners, pick ups, and straps. Washburn is mostly known for its electric guitars and acoustic guitars. The company makes eight different styles or “Series” of both electric and acoustic guitars [1].\n\nGuitars[]\n\nElectric:\n\nHollowbodies – well suited for Jazz because of its lighter and more resonant sound.\n\nIan Series – very artistic guitars made of mahogany and maple wood.\n\nIdol Series – a newer addition to Washburn guitars.\n\nMaya Series – designed by Dan Donegan based on the Disturbed’s CD \"The Sickness\".\n\nPaul Stanley Series – guitars designed by Paul Stanley.\n\nN Series – guitars that make a pure rock sound.\n\nX Series – rock and roll guitars. mostly played by gelatin Head guitarist Thomas Elliott\n\nAnarchy Graphic Series – guitars featuring the anarchy symbol.\n\nLyon Series - named after George Washburn's family name, moderately-priced guitars and basses with classic features and styling borrowed from Fender's most traditional electric guitar designs, catering for mainstream tastes and affordable pricing.\n\n\"ML\",Stealth, or 333 designs made for Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Damageplan. Signatures are available today.\n\nHM series (discontinued) - Heavy Metal series, aimed at shredders and heavy metal guitarists. Featuring innovative fretboard materials such as phenolic and carbon glass epoxy. These guitars are of very high quality and very few were made; ergo they are highly sought after.\n\nAcoustic:\n\nUSA – guitars made in the Mudelein, IL factory.\n\nJumbos – better and louder projection.\n\nDreadnoughts – good value acoustic guitars.\n\nFolk Style – best quality for sound recording.\n\nClassical – mellower tone, as a result of nylon strings.\n\nAcoustic / Electric – acoustic guitars that can be plugged into amplifiers as well.\n\nTravel Acoustic – small, travel friendly guitars.\n\nPaul Stanley Series – guitars designed by Paul Stanley.\n\nNotable Washburn innovations[]\n\nOver the years, Washburn designed (patented and trademarked) several prominent guitar construction features:\n\nBuzz Feiten Tuning System — a corrected temperation tuning formula, which uses a compensated nut and saddle to correct the inherent intonation problems of the Western tuning formula. This system comes standard on all USA made Washburn guitars and basses and is featured on select imported models [2].\n\nStephen's Extended Cutaway — special modification of bolt-on neck joint, allowing very smooth and easy top fret access, which comes useful while playing fast leads.\n\nVoice Contour Control - a special coil structure that allows a blend between a humbucker mode and a single-coil mode on the same pickup [3]\n\nEndorsers[]\n\nWashburn was the first company to use the mechanism of endorsements: instrument manufacturer and famous artist secure a contract that states:\n\nManufacturer provides custom-shop instrument that suits the artist best, for free (or even paying artist).\n\nArtists promotes his usage of that instrument and advertises manufacturer company.\n\nThis process greatly promotes the whole industry. Beginning artists often try to copy the sound of their favourite artists and thus try to use the same equipment. Endorsements help both manufacturers and consumers: beginning artists get to know what kind of equipment their idol uses and can copy their sound easier, and companies raise sales.[citation needed]\n\nThe whole list of Washburn endorsers is very lengthy, most notable artists that have signature models are listed here:\n\nNuno Bettencourt (Extreme, Mourning Widows and solo) — N series\n\nPete Dee Davison (The Adicts)\n\nNick Catanese (Black Label Society)\n\nRoger Waters (Pink Floyd and solo) - RW 300\n\nJonathan Donais (Shadows Fall) — X81FE Face Eraser\n\nSteve Kaftal (Etoufee, San Diego blues guitarist)\n\nDan Donegan (Disturbed)\n\nScott Ian (Anthrax)\n\nJoey Plesh & Jordan Church (Creep)\n\nDimebag Darrell (Pantera) (Damageplan)\n\nDon Clark (Demon Hunter)\n\nBakithi Kumalo (bassist to Paul Simon's Graceland album)\n\nJohn Bell of Widespread Panic plays a HB35 electric and a NV100 acoustic\n\nBootsy Collins\n\nPatrick Fannin Bass (Litter)\n\nBen Champagne Rhythm (Narcism)\n\nThomas Elliott Lead (Gelatin Head)\n\nRick Savage Bass (Def Leppard)\n\nPaul Stanley Rhythm (Kiss)\n\nDaveit Ferris Pilsen Idol, Hb35 and Nv300 the mascara story\n\nSteve Stevens ([Billy Idol]) (Vince Neil Band and solo) SS80-SS100\n\nThe fictional character Wayne Campbell (played by Mike Myers) in the Saturday Night Live skit Wayne's World also played a Washburn.\n\nProduct lineup[]\n\nSignature models[]\n\nNuno Bettencourt models are flagshipped by the American hand-made N4.
