        "text": "Parker Guitars Announces General Availability of the Adrian Belew Signature Fly Guitar\n\nCutting Edge Construction and High-End Components Make This One of the Most Advanced Guitars Ever Built\n\nChicago, IL. - Parker Guitars, a leader in innovation and originality within the music world, announced today the addition of the Adrian Belew Signature Fly to their line of electric guitars. Designed from the ground up to the exacting standards of legendary guitarist Adrian Belew, the Adrian Belew Signature Fly is one of the most advanced and innovative guitars ever built.\n\nThe Adrian Belew Signature Fly features an exclusive Dimarzio bridge pickup along with a revolutionary Sustainiac Stealth PRO neck pickup which produces intense, predictable and infinite feedback sustain.
