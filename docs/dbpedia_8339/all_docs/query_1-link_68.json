        "text": "Just browsing over both books, they look fantastic! I'm a guitarist and uke player for over 25 years and was thinking about writing a ukulele book but you've already written what I think are the best, most comprehensive and thorough books I've ever seen for the instrument. I just might end up buying every book you've written and I'll be giving my highest recommendation for your books to my friends and students. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such great books! — Peter Rhee\n\nAloha, Curt, All I can say is WOW! What you have accomplished is simply incredible! All the best — Glen Hirabayashi, The Aloha Boys\n\nFolks, if you haven't stopped by Curt's site, do so right now! ..And get his books, they are fantastic. This guy knows his stuff and is able to pass it along too. — Alan Johnson Proprietor, The 4th Peg\n\nI can highly recommend Curt's Uke books — I have four of them and they are excellent. — fatveg — Portland\n\nWant to leave a nice comment for LearningUkulele.com & Learning Ukulele with Curt? We'd love to hear how we're doing and how you are too. We'll share your comments and quotes throughout the site, helping to spread the word.\n\nThanks for visiting and checking out the site!\n\nOriginal Curtie Animation from 1987 for my first web site on a Macintosh II, 37 years ago.
