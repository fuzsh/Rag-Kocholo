        "text": "Anderson was born in 1970. He was one of the first of the \"video store\" generation of film-makers. His father was the first man on his block to own a V.C.R., and from a very early age Anderson had an infinite number of titles available to him. While film-makers like Spielberg cut their teeth making 8 mm films, Anderson cut his teeth shooting films on video and editing them from V.C.R. to V.C.R.\n\nPart of Anderson's artistic D.N.A. comes from his father, who hosted a late night horror show in Cleveland. His father knew a number of oddball celebrities such as Robert Ridgely, an actor who often appeared in Mel Brooks' films and would later play \"The Colonel\" in Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997). Anderson was also very much shaped by growing up in \"The Valley\", specifically the suburban San Fernando Valley of greater Los Angeles. The Valley may have been immortalized in the 1980s for its mall-hopping \"Valley Girls\", but for Anderson it was a slightly seedy part of suburban America. You were close to Hollywood, yet you weren't there. Would-bes and burn-outs populated the area. Anderson's experiences growing up in \"The Valley\" have no doubt shaped his artistic self, especially since three of his four theatrical features are set in the Valley.\n\nAnderson got into film-making at a young age. His most significant amateur film was The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), a sort of mock-documentary a la Die Jungs von Spinal Tap (1984), about a once-great pornography star named Dirk Diggler. After enrolling in N.Y.U.'s film program for two days, Anderson got his tuition back and made his own short film, Cigarettes & Coffee (1993). He also worked as a production assistant on numerous commercials and music videos before he got the chance to make his first feature, something he liked to call Sydney, but would later become known to the public as Last Exit Reno (1996). The film was developed and financed through The Sundance Lab, not unlike Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs - Wilde Hunde (1992). Anderson cast three actors whom he would continue working with in the future: Altman veteran Philip Baker Hall, the husky and lovable John C. Reilly and, in a small part, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who so far has been featured in all four of Anderson's films. The film deals with a guardian angel type (played by Hall) who takes down-on-his-luck Reilly under his wing. The deliberately paced film featured a number of Anderson trademarks: wonderful use of source light, long takes and top-notch acting. Yet the film was reedited (and retitled) by Rysher Entertainment against Anderson's wishes. It was admired by critics, but didn't catch on at the box office. Still, it was enough for Anderson to eventually get his next movie financed. \"Boogie Nights\" was, in a sense, a remake of \"The Dirk Diggler Story\", but Anderson threw away the satirical approach and instead painted a broad canvas about a makeshift family of pornographers. The film was often joyous in its look at the 1970s and the days when pornography was still shot on film, still shown in theatres, and its actors could at least delude themselves into believing that they were movie stars. Yet \"Boogie Nights\" did not flinch at the dark side, showing a murder and suicide, literally in one (almost) uninterrupted shot, and also showing the lives of these people deteriorate, while also showing how their lives recovered.\n\nAnderson not only worked with Hall, Reilly and Hoffman again, he also worked with Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, William H. Macy and Luis Guzmán. Collectively, Anderson had something that was rare in U.S. cinema: a stock company of top-notch actors. Aside from the above mentioned, Anderson also drew terrific performances from Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg, two actors whose careers were not exactly going full-blast at the time of \"Boogie Nights\", but who found themselves to be that much more employable afterwards.\n\nThe success of \"Boogie Nights\" gave Anderson the chance to really go for broke in Magnolia (1999), a massive mosaic that could dwarf Altman's Nashville (1975) in its number of characters.\n\nAnderson was awarded a \"Best Director\" award at Cannes for Punch-Drunk Love (2002).\n\nAlbert Magnoli graduated from the Film School at the University of Southern California. While there he completed ten student films, culminating with his Thesis Film project Jazz (1979), which he wrote, produced, edited, and directed. Focusing on the lives of three Los Angeles jazz musicians, \"Jazz\" went on to win 15 filmmaking awards in this country and abroad, including a Student Academy Award. The 23-minute film is listed in the 1983 edition of \"The Encyclopedia Britannica\" as \"the most honored student film made in this country in the last twenty years.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Magnoli was asked to edit the MGM film Jung und rücksichtslos (1984), which was being directed by his former USC classmate, James Foley. While editing the film, rock star Prince and his manager, Robert Cavallo, came looking for a director to helm Prince's feature film debut. Foley passed on the project, but suggested Magnoli. Prince and Cavallo screened \"Jazz\" and offered the project to him. Magnoli went to Prince's hometown, Minneapolis, and sequestered himself in a hotel room for four weeks. There he researched and wrote the script for Purple Rain (1984).\n\nAs director, writer and editor, Magnoli delivered \"Purple Rain\" to the theaters eleven months later. The \"Hollywood Reporter\" described \"Purple Rain\" as \"sensational and highly visual -- an accomplished and sophisticated example of storytelling.\" Released by Warner Bros. in 900 theaters, \"Purple Rain\" topped the box office in its first weekend, knocking Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984) from the #1 position. To date, \"Purple Rain\" has grossed over $125 million worldwide.\n\nMagnoli followed with the Lorimar-Columbia feature American Anthem (1986) and directed the critically acclaimed concert film Prince - Sign O' the Times (1987) for Prince. Magnoli was then commissioned to develop the sequel to \"Purple Rain\" for Warner Bros., which began a four-year association with Prince, culminating with Magnoli becoming Prince's manager and handling his personal and creative affairs for two years. The soundtrack album for Batman (1989) was created during this union, and two #1 videos, \"Batdance\" and \"Partyman\", were written and directed by Magnoli to promote the \"Batman\" film and soundtrack.\n\nMark Canton and Jon Peters then asked Magnoli to take over the directing reins from Andrey Konchalovskiy on Tango und Cash (1989) starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. The $65-million film was behind schedule and over budget, and Magnoli was asked to begin shooting immediately. Four days later he arrived on the set, shot for 40 days and delivered the picture to the studio in time for a Christmas release just two months later. \"Tango & Cash\" was a commercial success, grossing over $150 million worldwide. Magnoli then directed Born to Run (1993) for Fox Television, starring Richard Grieco. Filmed in just 24 days, the $3.4-million film was critically acclaimed.\n\nMagnoli then completed Dark Planet (1997) a science-fiction film for producers John Eyres and Barnet Bain and the Sci-Fi cable channel. Starring Paul Mercurio, Harley Jane Kozak and Michael York, \"Dark Planet\" was shot in 8 days with a budget of $800,000.00. Magnoli then directed \"Deliverance\", an episode of Nash Bridges (1996) for CBS. He then wrote \"Captain Blood,\" \"World Without End,\" \"The Taken,\" \"Johnny Blackout\" and \"Primal Scream.\"\n\nBrett Ratner is one of Hollywood's most successful filmmakers. His diverse films resonate with audiences worldwide and, as director, his films have grossed over $2 billion at the global box office. Brett began his career directing music videos before making his feature directorial debut at 28 years old with the action comedy hit Money Talks. He followed with the blockbuster Rush Hour and its successful sequels. Brett also directed The Family Man, Red Dragon, After the Sunset, X-Men: The Last Stand, Tower Heist and Hercules.\n\nRatner has also enjoyed critical acclaim and box office success as a producer. He has served as an executive producer on the Golden Globe and Oscar winning The Revenant, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp; and as a producer on Truth, starring Robert Redford and Cate Blanchett; I Saw the Light, starring Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen; and the upcoming film Rules Don't Apply, written, directed and produced by Warren Beatty. His other produced films include the smash hit comedy Horrible Bosses and its sequel, and the re-imagined Snow White tale Mirror Mirror.\n\nHis additional producing credits include the documentaries Author: The JT LeRoy Story, Catfish, the Emmy-nominated Woody Allen - A Documentary, Helmut by June, I Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale, Chuck Norris vs. Communism, the 5-time Emmy nominated and Peabody Award winning Night Will Fall, Bright Lights and National Geographic's upcoming Untitled Leonardo DiCaprio Environmental Documentary, directed, produced by and starring Leonardo DiCaprio. He also executive produced and directed the Golden Globe-nominated FOX series Prison Break, and executive produced the television series Rush Hour, based on his hit films.\n\nBrett, along with his business partner James Packer, formed RatPac Entertainment, a film finance production and media company, in 2013. RatPac has a first-look deal with Warner Bros. and joined with Dune Capital to co-finance over 75 films including Gravity, The Lego Movie, American Sniper, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. RatPac Entertainment also co-financed The Revenant and Birdman with New Regency. Internationally, Warner Bros. and RatPac have formed a joint venture content fund with China's Shanghai Media Group to finance local Chinese content. In partnership with New Regency, RatPac also finances the development and production of Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment.\n\nSince inception, RatPac Entertainment has co-financed 52 theatrically released motion pictures exceeding $9.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts. RatPac's co-financed films have been nominated for 51 Academy Awards, 20 Golden Globes and 39 BAFTAs and have won 21 Academy Awards, 7 Golden Globes and 17 BAFTAs.\n\nBrett is a Board of Trustees member of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance. He sits on the boards of Chrysalis, Best Buddies and Do Something, while serving on the Dean's Council of the NYU Tisch School of the Arts and on the Board of Directors at Tel Aviv University's School of Film and Television. In 2017, he will receive a coveted star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nSteve Barron started in films as a camera assistant on epic productions such as Richard Donner's 'Superman', Richard Attenborough's 'A Bridge Too Far' and Ridley Scott's Die Duellisten (1977). He began directing music videos in the early eighties for The Jam, Human League, and Adam & the Ants, his work helping to inspire the formation of MTV. In 1982 he conceived and directed the award winning 'Billie-Jean' - the first single of Michael Jackson's incredible 'Thriller' album. More seminal videos followed. Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing' won Best Video at the 1986 MTV Awards and A-Ha's 'Take On Me' was awarded Best Director.\n\nSteve's debut feature film was the music-led romantic comedy 'Electric Dreams' starring Virginia Madsen, released worldwide in 1984.\n\nIn 1987 his foray into network television won an Emmy for 'Hans My Hedgehog' - the 'Jim Henson - Storyteller' pilot for NBC. His second show 'Fearnot' gained immense critical acclaim after broadcast in 1987, while a third, 'Sapsorrow', broadcast in 1988, was similarly revered. The Washington Post said of 'Fearnot' - \"This fantasy turns the television screen into Alice's looking glass, Snow White's magic mirror and The Thief of Baghdad's all-seeing eye. It is so seductively imaginative that you can almost feel it pulling you into a bottomless tube\".\n\nIn 1990 Steve's second movie stunned the movie industry by becoming the first independent feature to break the 100 million-dollar theatrical barrier in the U.S. 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' grossed over 350 million dollars worldwide. A Grammy nomination followed for Dire Straits' 'Calling Elvis' and the Billboard Best Director award for Natalie Cole's 'Unforgettable' duet with her father, which reached No.1 across the world, selling over 12 million albums on the way.\n\nIn the mid-nineties Steve directed the Dan Ackroyd feature 'Coneheads' for Paramount and he was Executive Producer on the Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone picture 'The Specialist', and the highly successful 'While You Were Sleeping' starring Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. He was also Executive Producer on 'ReBoot', the first fully computer animated network series.\n\nIn 1996 he directed 'The Adventures of Pinocchio', starring Oscar winner Martin Landau and Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Alexander Walker said in the London Evening Standard \"Director Steve Barron's blend of human stars with the eponymous animatronic wooden hero has produced an amazing movie rooted in timeless fairyland but incorporating state-of-the-art wizardry.... The inventiveness lasts through the fable: it really is something to goggle at, whatever your age.\" Responses across the Atlantic in the U.S. were equally warm. The Washington Post wrote of the film, \"The Adventures of Pinocchio evokes the look and language of traditional European picture book tales, and does so with so much charm that it offers a fresh new delight, not just a pale live-action imitation, of the Disney animated classic.\"\n\nIn autumn 1998, Steve directed 'Merlin', a $30 million television mega-series produced by Hallmark for NBC in America. Merlin attracted a stellar cast including Sam Neill, Helena Bonham-Carter, Miranda Richardson, Isabella Rossellini, Martin Short, Alan Bates, Sir John Geilguid and Rutger Hauer. In the US alone 58 million people tuned in to watch 'Merlin' and the critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive. Entertainment Weekly wrote... \"Merlin cast a new spell on history posting the highest ratings in adults 18-49 since 1984... the result is nothing less than an instant classic - a four -hour TV movie that deserves to be shown annually, the way it used to be a tradition to broadcast 'The Wizard of Oz' every year. It's that good - that scary, that rich, that much fun.\"- 'Merlin' was nominated for 15 Emmy's, 4 Golden Globes and a DGA nod for outstanding Directing.\n\nIn 1999 Steve completed 'Arabian Nights', this time for the ABC network in America. Photographed in Turkey and Morocco its stars include Alan Bates, Jason Scott Lee, John Leguizamo, Dougray Scott and Rufus Sewell. The show aired to rave notices on ABC TV in the USA and BBC1 in the UK simultaneously, earning 5 more Emmy and a US National Television Critics nomination.\n\nIn October 2000 the Universal movie 'Rat' had it's theatrical premiere in Dublin. This dark comedy, co-produced and directed by Steve Barron, is the bizarre story of a Dublin man who comes home from the pub one day 'not feeling very well' and turns into a rat. Starring Imelda Staunton and Pete Postlethwaite the Irish press greeted the film with an ecstatic response. Brian Reddin of the Dublin Evening Herald said - \"To miss this superb surreal comedy would be to miss one of the greatest Irish films ever made and perhaps the funniest.\"\n\nSteve's next comedy was 'Mike Bassett-England Manager' a spoof documentary feature film starring Ricky Tomlinson as the national soccer coach. The film had a wide UK theatrical release in November 2001, through the government funded Film Council and Entertainment distributors, taking $6m and charting at number three in it's first four weeks.\n\nNext was a $24m American Indian mini-series epic for ABC and Hallmark. 'Dreamkeeper' is the first big scale attempt to bring to life the myth's and legends of the Native American people. Tribes all across the United States were consulted and ninety-five speaking roles all cast with Native people. The production won Steve a Gold for Directorial Achievement at the Chicago International TV Festival and an Emmy for best visual effects.\n\nIn 2005 Steve wrote and directed the New York based independent feature film 'Choking Man' starring Mandy Patinkin and Aaron Paul. The contemporary feature follows the fortunes of an acutely shy Ecuadorian dishwasher.
