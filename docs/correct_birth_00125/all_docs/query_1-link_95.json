        "text": "There are few superstars who are super nice and super talented. Kelly Clarkson more than delivers on both. The Fort Worth-born, Burleson, Texas-raised singer not only won over the American public with her incredible voice on the first season of American Idol, she also managed to charm not-at-all-easy-to-impress Simon Cowell. In fact, Cowell told her at the auditions: “I remember not just your voice, but your personality. I’m gonna be honest here, I didn’t realize at that point honestly how good you were. I just liked you.” High praise, indeed—especially from The Sultan of Sarcasm!\n\nClarkson went on to win the competition in 2002, and she hasn’t had too many missteps since. Sure, there was the unfortunate rom-com From Justin to Kelly, which starred Clarkson and American Idol runner-up Justin Guarini, which Rotten Tomatoes calls “a notorious stinker.”\n\nBut don’t blame Clarkson—or Guarini for that matter! They were contractually obligated to do the film.\n\nMusic-wise, it’s been smooth sailing. Clarkson has been churning out hits since she got her record deal and released “A Moment Like This.” In the last two decades, she’s had more than 100 number ones on the Billboard charts, sold millions of albums, become one of the hottest performers to see live, and won three Grammys.\n\nBut Clarkson is more than an incredible singer-songwriter. Seriously, check out her Wikipedia page—it’s very, very long. She’s a total boss who writes children’s books, coaches other singers on The Voice, does ads for reasonably priced furniture, hosts her very own syndicated talk show, and more—all while raising kids. Sadly, she recently went through a very public and painful divorce, but, well, Clarkson said it best: “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, stand a little taller,” and make piles and piles of cash, apparently!\n\nSo what’s Kelly Clarkson’s net worth? To figure that out, we gotta look behind those hazel eyes…and into all of her various business ventures.\n\nHow much does Kelly Clarkson make from her music?\n\nAs mentioned, Clarkson has released a lot of music in the last 20 years—including 10 studio albums and 55 singles. Her latest album, Chemistry, was released in 2023 through Atlantic Records and is about the beginning, middle, and end of her relationship with Brandon Blackstock. “It was really important to me to have the full scope of a relationship and not just the negative,” she told NPR’s Juana Summers. “There were some beautiful moments like, how lucky am I to have felt that, to have been in love, to have that chemical reaction with someone?”\n\nThe album debuted at number 6 on the Billboard chart and went even further to extending Clarkson’s bottom line. According to Celebrity Net Worth, the singer has earned more than $100 million before taxes from all her album sales.\n\nHow much does Kelly Clarkson make from touring?\n\nA whole lot. Clarkson’s shows have been must-see starting with her very first tour, The Breakaway Tour, back in 2005. People can’t get enough of her for one simple reason: She can really sing. Unlike so many pop stars who need backup tracks—and backup singers—to make them sound decent, Clarkson’s got the pipes. Also, her shows are fun! She and her band delight in performing covers of popular songs—and they kill it every single time.\n\nRather than go out on tour for her latest release, Clarkson opted to perform \"Chemistry: An Intimate Evening with Kelly Clarkson\" as a 10-date residency at Las Vegas’ Planet Hollywood. She did songs from her newest album, along with old-school favorites. Like her other more traditional tours, it was a hit. In all, she’s managed to gross around $60 million over the last two decades just from touring.\n\nHow much does Kelly Clarkson make from television shows?\n\nAgain, Clarkson has been cleaning up since her first starring role on a television show: She won $1 million (plus a record deal) when she took the top spot on American Idol. The superstar returned to a regular television role during season 14 on The Voice as a coach alongside Blake Shelton, Alicia Keys, and Adam Levine. She stayed on through season 21, and then returned in 2023. The responsibility of coaching comes with some major perks—by the later seasons, she was making around $560,000 per episode, which works out to around a cool $14 million for a season.\n\nClarkson also launched her very own talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, in September of 2019. She quickly built a following with her sweet interviews with A-list talent and her amazing covers during Kellyoke segments—all filmed in front of a live studio audience in New York City. Not only has the show won 13 Emmys, but it’s also earned Clarkson more stacks of cold-hard cash. As Us Weekly reported during Clarkson and Blackstock’s divorce proceedings, between the talk show and The Voice, she was making $1.9 million a month. But that number has likely increased—the talk show host has the option to renegotiate her salary on her eponymous show every year.\n\nDoes Kelly Clarkson do other stuff?\n\nShe sure does! If you love television, you know she pops up all the time in time slots that don’t include The Voice or The Kelly Clarkson Show. As the brand ambassador for , she’s regularly shows up in fun commercials during primetime.\n\nAs if that’s not enough, Clarkson has made her return to the big screen. Sure, her first film didn’t kill it, but she’s had more success with Ugly Dolls and Trolls World Tour. She’s also written the children’s books, and .\n\nSo What’s Kelly Clarkson’s Net Worth?\n\nFans of Chelsea Devantez’s podcast “Glamorous Trash” are well-versed in just how common it is for female performers to have hus-managers (husbands who also act as managers). On the one one-hand, who could be better equipped for making sure that a star’s best interests are protected than her spouse? On the other hand, it’s a total mess when the marriage goes kaput.\n\nClarkson was married to Brandon Blackstock from 2013 to 2023. While the two had a pre-nup before they got married, Clarkson had to pay her ex $1.4 million, as well as more than $40,000 in child support every month.\n\nBut in a twist, Blackstock was Clarkson $2.3 million in November of 2023 for commissions he earned when he was her manager."
