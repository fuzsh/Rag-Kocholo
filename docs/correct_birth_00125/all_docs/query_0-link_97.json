        "text": "This is the story of the beginning of American Idol, how we met Texas native Kelly Clarkson and Georgia native Justin Guarini both compete on the first season of American Idol. The first winner and the first runner up of American Idol who later made a film debut until the film became a huge flop. After their flop film, Clarkson has recorded several songs that has made her a huge phenomenal star while Guarini made his way to the screen and stage.\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nKelly Brianne Clarkson was born on April 24, 1982 at Fort Worth, Texas. She is the youngest of three children and has two younger half brothers from her father's second marriage.Kelly's parents divorced when she was six years old. In the seventh grade, the school's choir teacher overheard Clarkson singing voice and asked her to audition for the school choir though Clarkson never had any vocal training. Throughout her time in school, she would perform in choirs, school musicals, and talent shows. She graduated in 2000 at Burleson High School. Clarkson hasn't stopped singing from there. She started working several jobs to make her demo. She sent her demo CD to unfortunately Clarkson turned them down and said that they wanted her to sing bubblegum pop which Clarkson wasn't really fondly interested.\n\nKelly's Audition\n\nKelly's friends encouraged her to audition for American Idol. The show was titled \"American Idol: The Search for a Superstar\" before it was changed in to \"American Idol\". Twenty year old Kelly sang \"At Last\"by Etta James and another song Madonna \"Express Yourself\" requested by the judges. All the judges say yes and gave her ticket to Hollywood.\n\nJustin Guarini\n\nJustin Guarini born as Justin Eldrin Bell was October 28, 1978, Columbus, Georgia. His father, Eldrin Bell, is African-American and his mother Kathy Pepino Guarini, is Italian American. At age four, he was accepted by the Atlanta Boy Choir. Throughout his school years Guarini sang in school choirs, and from 1996 to 2000 was the lead soloist in an award-winning a cappella group named The Midnight Voices. The group released an independent album in 1999 with proceeds benefiting a music scholarship fund at Guarini's alma mater, Central Bucks High School East in Buckingham, Pennsylvania. He was a director/performer at the Riverside Haunted Woods in Bridgeton Township, Pennsylvania, in 2001.\n\nJustin's Audition\n\nJustin had an early audition and sang The Jacksons \"Who's Lovin' You\" . He didn't know Simon and Randy (the judges) at the time. At the end of the song, Paula was impressed with Guarini and said \"yes\" . Simon was also impressed and praised his vocals. The judges say \"Yes\" and gave him the ticket to Hollywood.\n\nTheir Time on Idol\n\nDuring their time on Idol, Clarkson have said in a interview that the competition was \"ghetto\" and was pretty much like camp. Before Justin audition to Idol, he already audition for the Broadway production of The Lion King. He was offered the role but turned it down due to his commitment with American Idol.\n\nAmerican Idol Winner\n\nAfter pushing hard through the competition, Clarkson and Guarini were the two finalists for the American Idol competition. After Clarkson and Guarini sang their final three songs.\n\nIt was time to announce the first American Idol.\n\nBefore the hosts would critiques the contestants praising and thanking the contestants. Host Ryan Seacrest and co-host Brian Dunkleman announce the winner.\n\nAnd the winner is.....\n\n\"Kelly Clarkson\"\n\nClarkson won and was the first winner of American Idol.\n\n\"Before Your Love\" Music Video\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly : the WTF American Idol Film Nobody Ask For!!!\n\nAfter American Idol, Clarkson and Guarini were signed into a movie deal that would change their lives. The film was titled From Justin to Kelly, it was kind of inspired by them except with a musical comedy romantic twist. The film tells a story about two star crossed lovers, Texas native Kelly Taylor and Pennsylvanian college student Justin Bell (Clarkson and Guarini) on a spring break vacation with friends, when the two cross paths with each other, their friends tries their best to keep the two apart. With the help of several song-and-dance numbers, however, Justin and Kelly eventually connect and make sweet music together. The film made in about two-and-a-half months; three weeks was spent for actor readings of the script (of which revisions were still going on) and rehearsals for dances and singing before the six-week shooting schedule. It premiered on June 20, 2003. The film was bomb at the box office and received negative harsh reviews. The film was even nominated for nine Razzie's awards. However, Clarkson actually didn't want to be apart of the film. Clarkson has since stated that she has always disliked From Justin to Kelly film.In an interview, she admitted she joined the film only because she was contractually obligated.\n\nClarkson:\n\n\"I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.\"\n\nYikes!!!!!\n\nClarkson also expressed her concern for the film that it would tarnished her career. What made it worse??? Guarini self titled EP album was released on June 10, 2003, weeks before the From Justin to Kelly film. The album sold 146,000 copies. Guarini was dropped from RCA records.\n\nNow I didn't watch the film but hopefully I would find this film in because I'm curious about why everyone including critics hated this film.\n\nA New Beginning for Clarkson\n\nBefore the disastourus film was released, Clarkson was signed to RCA Records, 19 Recordings, and S Records. Her debut album Thankful was released on April 15, 2003. Thankful has sold 2,800,000 copies in the United States, receiving a 2Ã— platinum. Her songs Before You're Love and A Moment Like This were included on the album.\n\nHer first single \"Miss Independent\" became a sensational international hit. \"Miss Independent\" peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Pop Songs chart. It became a top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit and a number one top 40 smash.\n\nBreakaway\n\nAfter the success of Thankful and her song Miss Independent, Clarkson has reinvented a new image of herself instead of \"the girl from American Idol\" image. Her single \"Breakaway\" was released on July 19, 2004 by Walt Disney Records for The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement: Original Soundtrack.\n\nFun Fact: Breakaway was originally written by Arvil Lavgine for her debut album Let It Go. The song seemed unsuitable for Lavgine and was passed to Samantha Moore, other artists but never worked out until it passed and given to Clarkson.\n\nBreakaway peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became her third top ten song in the chart. It also topped the US Adult Contemporary for twenty-one non-consecutive weeks.\n\nHer next single \"Since U Been Gone\" has released on November 16, 2004 months after her single was Breakaway was released.\n\nSince U Been Gone has been a huge hit and huge radio play in every radio stations. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, behind 50 Cent and Olivia \"Candy Shop\". It topped the US Pop 100 for six consecutive weeks and the US Pop Songs for seven consecutive weeks respectively and certified platinum. Her next album, Breakaway was released on November 30, 2004.\n\nHer second album Breakaway has been released on November 30, 2004. The album was a success and received positive reviews from music critics and music listeners. It became Clarkson's best selling album than Thankful. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States with 250,000 copies sold.\n\nClarkson would later win a Grammy in 2006 at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and another for Best Pop Vocal Album. She became the first American Idol contestant ever to win a Grammy.\n\nPre-Broadway\n\nAfter Justin was dropped from RCA records, Guarini had a role in the 2004 pre-Broadway New York Stage and Film Powerhouse Theater workshop/presentation of the musical Good Vibrations at Vassar College. His performance (which included singing, dancing, acting, and playing guitar) landed Guarini an offer to continue the role in the original Broadway production but he decided not to take the role and move on ahead.\n\nStranger Things Have Happened & Revolve\n\nSince getting dropped from RCA, Guarini has independently co-produced his second album Stranger Things Have Happened in December 2005 through his own production company, Justice Entertainment. The album wasn't much successful as Clarkson's album Breakaway but has received a positive review from AllMusic calling Guarini\n\n\"a genuine, natural charisma as a supper club-styled singer, and that charisma when contrasted with his band's jazz chops has a nice, relaxed appeal.\"\n\nHe later released an ac EP titled Revolve in May 2008.\n\nHe co-written and co-produced with Shaun Ingram.\n\nWhat Happened to Kelly & Justin?\n\nClarkson hasn't stopped making music. So far, over the years, Clarkson has released nine albums,six extended plays, one compilation album, one remix album, and 50 singles (including six as a featured artist) after Thankful and Breakaway. Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide.\n\nClarkson was married to Brandon Blackstock until they divorced in 2021. In 2016, Clarkson collaborated with Janelle MonÃ¡e, Kelly Rowland, Lea Michele, Zendaya,Chloe and Halle, and Missy Elliott on Michelle Obamaâ€™s \"This Is for My Girls\" single to promote the first ladyâ€™s Let Girls Learn educational initiative.\n\nClarkson has her own talk show called The Kelly Clarkson Show and has won two Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host. She would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2021. As for Justin, he has been making some stage and screen time for himself. In 2015, Guarini has been starring as Lil' Sweet in Diet Dr Pepper television commercials, and web marketing. Guarini is married to Reina Capodici. They been married in 2009. In 2009 Oprahâ€™s next chapter interview, Guarini has opened on his battle with depression. His reason with depression due to RCA dropping him from the label and SNL alumni Tina Fey made a joke on him.\n\nNow I can't find the video clip of Tina Fey on SNL making that joke however I did find the link from starcasm.net that Tina mocked Guarini for being \"poor \" and \"skips his meals to feed his family.\n\nTo be honest, I don't find the joke to be funny, plus Guarini is very talented and he deserves better career. Now I am not dissing Kelly Clarkson I love Kelly. It's absolutely harsh how the industry mistreat Justin.\n\nHe became a part of Broadway in 2010 as Carlos in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Then continued on Broadway musicals and plays like Wicked, American Idiot, Romeo & Juliet, and etc. He hosted Idol after show and other television award show events.\n\nThe two haven't seen each other in years. Hopefully, they will reunite on the Kelly Clarkson show. Maybe Kelly should give him a call to be on her show.\n\nSource\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/musician/kelly-clarkson\n\nYouTube\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Justin_to_Kelly\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Guarini\n\nStarcasm.net"
