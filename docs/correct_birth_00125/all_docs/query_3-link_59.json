        "text": "It's Kevin James-approved, too.\n\nKelly Clarkson has been a New Yorker for nearly a year. The Emmy Award-winning talk show host relocated “The Kelly Clarkson Show” to Rockefeller Center in late 2023. Almost a year later, the Texas-born singer continues to ask her famous guests for New York City recommendations.\n\nRecently, Clarkson sat down with actor and Long Island native Kevin James to ask for NYC restaurant recommendations. As we know, the Grammy Award-winning singer has famously admitted to being bad in the kitchen, so Clarkson says she likes to try a new place every week.\n\nJames walked her through his favorite pizza joints around the city, but said, “You have to top it off with a malted at the Farmacy in Brooklyn. [It’s] pretty insane.”\n\nBrooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain opened in 2010 inside a space that was formerly used as a pharmacy in the 1920s. The ice cream shop is known for its old-timey feel and signature egg cream, but James says the vanilla malt is a must-have.\n\n“Do you like malteds?” he asked Clarkson.\n\n“I love a malt, I don’t even bother with a shake,” she responded.\n\nKevin James even brought two vanilla malts from Brooklyn Farmacy to the show for Clarkson to try.\n\n“How good is that,” he asked after Clarkson took a sip.\n\n“Oh my god, this is incredible,” she said.\n\n“I can’t even focus on what you’re talking about right now,” James joked as he slurped down his malt.\n\nWhat Is a Malt and How Do You Make One?\n\nTechnically, a malt is a shake, but it’s one that gets enhanced with malted milk powder. The powder adds a richer, almost nutty flavor to the shake, plus it thickens it up.\n\nWhile malts aren’t as popular as shakes nowadays, you can still get them at some restaurants and national chains. Dairy Queen, Shake Shack, and Culver’s all offer malts on their menus.\n\nAnd, even though Clarkson might not be whipping up desserts in her kitchen—hence why she swears by Patti LaBelle’s famous Walmart pies—you can also make malts at home. All you need is malted milk powder, which Carnation makes and is sold at most major retailers.\n\nJust mix up your favorite milkshake, then add a few tablespoons of the powder, or follow this Malted Chocolate Milkshake recipe and sub out chocolate for your ice cream flavor of choice. One sip of the easy dessert and you’ll wonder why more places aren’t serving the 1920s favorite."
