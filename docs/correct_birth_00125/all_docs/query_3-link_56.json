        "text": "She may hail from Texas and may have spent close to two decades living in California, but Kelly Clarkson is determined to stay in New York now.\n\nThe American Idol alum made the big cross country move last fall with her kids River Rose, nine, and Remington Alexander, seven — plus her eponymous NBC talk show — following her divorce from Brandon Blackstock.\n\nAnd as opportunities come up for her to go back to Los Angeles and be a part of either American Idol or The Voice again, she says she's sticking by her \"promise\" to her kids to stay on the East Coast.\n\nSpeaking with Entertainment Tonight about the potential of replacing Katy Perry on American Idol following her recent departure, she revealed that she \"can't do that,\" noting: \"Only because I promised my kids.\"\n\n\"I wanna be there as much as I possibly can,\" she recalled promising to her kids, and further explained: \"It would put me in L.A., and that's why I had to quit The Voice, which I love that team. And I miss them so much.\"\n\nThough Kelly has gushed about her family's life in New York, she also previously opened up about what a difficult decision it was to make, despite knowing it was the right one for her family.\n\nSpeaking with TalkShopLive last year about first telling her TV crew about the move, she recalled: \"I talked to my crew back in January through tears because I have built such an amazing group of people.\"\n\nMORE: Kelly Clarkson admits she used weight loss drugs after shedding over 42 pounds\n\nMORE: Kelly Clarkson recalls being a stepmom to teenagers during marriage to Brandon Blackstock: 'Real different'\n\nShe added: \"Obviously, we've been very successful and I love everybody I work with and we have such great relationships.\"\n\nStill, she further shared: \"I was like, 'Guys I need you to know what’s happening. It's either I'm not going to be able to continue with the show or I got to go the East Coast,'\" and emphasized: \"My family is East Coast. They're North Carolina-based. It was one of those things where I just had to.\"\n\nMORE: Hoda Kotb's daughters make surprise appearance on Kelly Clarkson's show featuring famous guest – watch\n\n\"There were a lot of personal things going on, too,\" Kelly also noted at the time, adding: \"I feel like our family, me and my kids, really needed a fresh start and I just could not get it here [in Los Angeles].\"\n\nMORE: Kelly Clarkson's ex Brandon Blackstock breaks silence on their messy $2.6m legal battle\n\nFinally, expressing her appreciation for NBC for their understanding through the moving process, she said: \"It was really cool that NBC backed me because I was, like, 'Y'all I love doing this show, I really do, I didn't even know I would but I got to make a change for me and my family so any chance we can maybe do this. I know we can't do this from my ranch, so, any chance we can do it in New York, which is at least closer to my family.'\""
