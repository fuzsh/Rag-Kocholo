        "text": "Biography\n\nKelly Brianne Clarkson (born April 24, 1982) is an American singer-songweriter and occasional actress. Clarkson made her debut under RCA Records after she won the first season of the television series American Idol in 2002.\n\nKelly has released four albums to date: her debut album Thankful (2003), her multi-platinum second album Breakaway (2004), My December (2007), and her latest album All I Ever Wanted (2009). Her first four albums have sold over 10.4 million copies in the United States.\n\nEleven of Kelly's singles became Top Twenty hits on the Billboard Hot 100. One of her more recent singles, \"My Life Would Suck Without You,\" advanced from #97 to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week of release, breaking the record for the largest leap to the top position in chart history.\n\nIn addition to her music, Kelly had the female lead in the movie From Justin to Kelly (2003) along with Justin Guarini. She played Brenda Lee in the television drama American Dreams and appeared in the sitcom Reba. She also participated in comedy skits on MADtv (2002) and Saturday Night Live (2005).\n\nKelly has toured extensively world-wide as a solo act. AFter her appearance on the CMT Crossroads and her duet version of her hit \"Because of You\" (2007) with Reba McEntire, they co-headlined the 2 Worlds, 2 Voices tour (2008).\n\nKelly had the highest-selling American Idol album in the United States until November 2009 when Carrie Underwood claimed that title by a narrow margin of 100,000 albums. Kelly, however, remains the highest-selling American Idol overall, with over 23 million albums sold world-wide to Carrie Underwood's 14 million.\n\nEarly Life\n\nKelly Clarkson was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and grew up in the small town of Burleson, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth. She is the third and youngest child of Jeanne Rose, a first-grade teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson. Kelly's siblings include her older brother and sister, Jason and Alyssa. When Kelly was six years old, her parents divorced after seventeen years of marriage. Kelly and her mother settled in Burleson, where her mother married her second husband, Jimmy Taylor.\n\nKelly's family struggled financially, and after her parents' divorce, music became her refuge. She attended Pauline G. Hughes Middle School and Burleson High School. She wanted to become a marine biologist, but changed her mind after her older brother, Jason, let her watch the movie Jaws. In seventh grade, the new choir teacher (Mrs. Cynthia Glenn) overheard Kelly singing in a hallway and asked her why she hadn't joined the school choir. Kelly told the teacher that it was because she couldn't sing.\n\nIn high school, Kelly performed in musicals such as Annie Get Your Gun, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Brigadoon. She sang at her high school talent show, after which an audience member shared some inspiring words with her: \"God has given you this gift. You've got to sing. You're destined to sing.\" Kelly continued singing and soon started classical training, hoping that music would be her ticket to a college scholarship.\n\nUpon high school graduation, Kelly was offered full scholarships to the University of Texas at Austin, the University of North Texas, and Berklee, but decided against college because she had \"already written so much music and wanted to try it on her own,\" and she figured that \"you're never too old to go to college.\"\n\nAmerican Idol\n\nKelly Clarkson then moved to L.A., but moved back to Texas quickly after her apartment burned down. A friend told her about an audition for American Idol, and Kelly joined the first Top 20 ever.\n\nKelly went on to win the first season of American Idol on September 4, 2002, earning 58% of the vote to Justin Guarini's 42%. Choking back tears, Kelly performed the ballad \"A Moment Like This,\" the song written for the winner of American Idol, which would subsequently appear on her debut album, Thankful. The music video for the song was filmed at Pantages Theater in Hollywood, and incorporated several scenes of Kelly performing on Idol. When released as a single in October 2002, \"A Moment Like This\" set a record on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart when it rose from #52 to #1. This achievement was largely due to the impact from American Idol; the CD single managed to sell 236,000 copies in its first week of sales in the U.S. It spent five weeks at #1 in Canada.\n\nFrom Justin to Kelly\n\nSoon after the first season of American Idol ended, Kelly starred with Idol runner-up Justin Guarini in the movie From Justin to Kelly (2003). The film was poorly received by critics and grossed only $5 million at the North American box office. Kelly has mentioned in interviews that she is shocked when people send her scripts after the movie, often citing contractual obligation as her sole reason for involvement in From Justin to Kelly. Kelly was quoted telling People, \"I knew when I read the script that it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper and I could not get out of it.\" The script was written by Kim Fuller (Simon Fuller's brother).\n\nSpring break in Miami is the scene. It's where surf-drenched guys cruise girls in bikinis and raucous parties rule day and night. It's the perfect time and place for three young women from Texas and a trio of college guys from Pennsylvania to find adventure and maybe even fall in love. In a Texas dive bar, Kelly is singing her heart out to a few local yokels when her best friends Kaya and Alexa try and tempt her away for some fun in the Florida sun. It's an easy sell -- even for the cautious Kelly -- and the three head for Miami. Making their way to the same destination is the \"Pennsylvania Posse\" -- college students Justin, Brandon, and Eddie. Justin and Brandon are smooth-talking party promoters, while Eddie's primed to meet Lizzie, the cyber-dream-girl he's been emailing for months. Miami Beach, beating with a rhythm all its own, is teeming with beautiful people. Kelly's friends are drawn into the beachside fun, while Kelly tentatively navigates a sea of strangers. When her eyes meet Justin's, everything changes -- in an instant. While Kaya and Alexa are content to survey the parade of eye candy, Kelly's now only interested in the guy with the irresistible smile. The feeling is mutual, and Justin's on fire. But as luck would have it, he loses Kelly's number -- and boy-crazy Alexa has already set her sights on Justin. She will stop at nothing -- even betraying a friend -- to nab Justin as her own. Will true love win out for the star-crossed Justin and Kelly?\n\nPost-Idol Career\n\nShortly following the completion of the first season of American Idol, Kelly was accused of working with a record company. American Idol's rules stated that a contestant was not allowed to compete on the program if they had been linked to a record company. However, she was cleared of all allegations, as she had only had a contract in order to conduct demonstration work.\n\nKelly is currently the only American Idol contestant to have reached number one in the UK. She claimed number one on March 1, 2009 when \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" debuted number one on downloads alone. She has sold over 10.2 million albums in the United States, and over 20 million albums worldwide, becoming the highest-selling Idol winner. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Kelly is also ranked on the Top 200 album sellers of the Nielsen SoundScan era at #187.\n\nThankful (2003)\n\nFollowing the release of \"A Moment Like This,\" Kelly's full-length debut album Thankful was released in North America by RCA Records on April 15, 2003. It debuted at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA for sales of two million copies on December 8, 2003, and platinum by the CRIA for sales of 100,000 copies on February 10, 2004. Reviews for the album were generally favourable. However, several critics noted that her early achievement was only due to her performance on American Idol. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its vocal ability: \"throughout this record, [Clarkson] makes it seem effortless and charming. She can croon, she can belt out a song, she can be sexy and sassy while still being graceful and as wholesome as thei girl next door.\" Rachel Kipp of JS Online criticized Kelly for not having the same personality on Thankful as she had on American Idol, and wrote: \"on American Idol, Clarkson showcased a great voice and an endearing, 'aw-shucks' personality. That personality is missing on Thankful, and there lies the album's greatest fault.\" Kipp blamed the producers behind the album for not allowing Kelly to be herself.\n\n\"Miss Independent\" was released as the second single from Thankful (after \"A Moment Like This\"). It reached the Top 10 of both the U.S. and Canadian singles charts, and earned Kelly a 2004 Grammy Award nominaton for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\" When the single was released in the United Kingdom and Australia, it reached the Top 10 of the charts there, as well; however, Thankful as a whole received less attention. It peaked at #41 on the U.K. albums chart, and #33 on the Australian albums chart.\n\n\"Low,\" the third single from Thankful, reached #2 in Canada, but was unable to make the Top 40 of the U.S. chart. The final single, \"The Trouble With Love Is,\" was not released in Canada, and peaked at #101 on the U.S. charts. Kelly attributed the under-performance of both releases to poor management and relieved her manager (Simon Fuller), who she felt was not completely focused on her career. Kelly also covered Danielle Brisebois' \"Just Missed The Train\" on the album.\n\nBreakaway (2004)\n\nDistancing herself from her American Idol image, Kelly took more creative control with her second album, Breakaway, and developed a more rock-oriented image. Breakaway was released by RCA Records on November 30, 2004. The album debuted within the U.S. Top 5 and the Canadian Top 10, but sales were initially low in comparison to Thankful. However, the single releases from Breakaway proved to be very successful, and allowed it to become the fourth album in history to stay on the Billboard 200 Top 20 for a consecutive year, as well as being certified six-times platinum in the U.S. in late 2007 and five-times platinum in Canada in May 2006. In Australia, the album reached #2 and spent 52 weeks in the Top 10, and was certified six-times platinum; however, Breakaway experienced a delayed release in the U.K.\n\nKelly co-wrote six of the twelve songs with several songwriters, such as former Evanescence band members Ben Moody, David Hodges and producer Max Martin; the title track was co-written by punk-pop singer Avril Lavigne.\n\nBreakaway received different responses from critics; Rolling Stone commented that \"on Kelly Clarkson's second album, she embraces her rock side rather than the pop pageantry that put her on top of the American Idol heap.\" TeenInk noted the strength of her vocals on Breakaway, and praised the change from pop music to contemporary rock: \"[Clarkson] retains the incredible power and beauty of her voice while switching to rock.\" Stylus magazine also enjoyed Kelly's foray into rock music, however, she was called out because of her American Idol image, which reviewer Charles Merwin believed she had yet to lose. He praised the non-singles and wrote that they \"maintain a quality high.\"\n\nKelly appeared on numerous television programs during the promotional tour for Breakaway, and she performed the first two singles \"Breakaway\" and \"Since U Been Gone\" on Saturday Night Live, which became her first major telecast appearance in order to support the album. \"Breakaway,\" co-written by Avril Lavigne, served as the original song for The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004) and achieved considerable success across the world; it became Kelly's third Top 10 single in the U.S. and fourth Top 10 single in Canada. It reached #10 in Australia, and #22 in the U.K.\n\nThe second single \"Since U Been Gone,\" which was produced by Max Martin, became the most successful release from the album. Its music video presented Kelly singing to an underground audience with a full band; cut scenes of Kelly destroying a former boyfriend's apartment were incorporated. The song's strong rock ambiance allowed it to reach #2 in the U.S. and the Top 5 across the world. It also earned Kelly her first Grammy Award for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. She won a second award for \"Best Pop Vocal Album.\"\n\nThe third and fourth single releases, \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" and \"Because of You,\" also followed with chart success. The video for \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" broke the record for days at #1 for a female artist with 33 out of 50 days at #1 on TRL. The video for \"Because of You\" won the 2006 MTV Music Video Award for Best Female Video, her second consecutive win in that category (the first being from \"Since U Been Gone\"). The fifth single from Breakaway was entitled \"Walk Away.\" Breakaway spent 103 weeks on the Billboard 200. It fell out of the Billboard 200 in late November and was moved to Billboard's Pop Catalog. Breakaway was the tenth best-selling album of 2006 in the US, adding nearly 2 million additional sales to the 2004 and 2005 sales. As a testament to Kelly's continuing popularity, she was the most-played artist of 2006 on American radio, despite releasing only one single in the entire year, \"Walk Away.\" On December 23, 2006, American Top 40 radio show host Ryan Seacrest announced during a countdown of 2006's most popular songs that Kelly had had a song in the American Top 40 for 111 weeks, making her \"the most successful female artist in AT40 history.\" She was also the most radio-broadcasted artist of 2006 in Australia, and \"Because Of You\" was the third most-broadcast song of the same year, despite being released in 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Kelly made a performance during the 2005 NBA All-Star Weekend as part of the festivities leading up to the All-Star Game. Later that year, she performed the Star-Spangled Banner at Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons. She also performed that spring as part of 2005 NCAA Final Four festivities in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Kelly lent Ford Motor Co. a song titled \"Go,\" written by Kelly and Rhett Lawrence (\"Miss Independent\"). The song was used in the company's advertising campaign in 2006, \"Bold Moves,\" and the song, along with its music video, was made available free at Ford's AddictedtoKelly.com website (website now defunct).\n\nMy December (2007)\n\nWhile on tour in Europe in 2006, Kelly began writing and composing songs for her third album, My December. During the Addicted Tour, Kelly debuted two of her new songs (\"Maybe\" and \"Yeah\"). The first single from My December was \"Never Again,\" which made its radio debut on April 13, 2007. The song was released on iTunes on April 20, 2007, but was taken down and replaced with a notice that said that the song was not available until April 23, 2007. The single peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at #8 and on the Pop 100 at #5. Following \"Never Again,\" Kelly released \"Sober\" as her next single from My December on June 6, 2007. The singles were promoted with appearances on Good Morning America and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Kelly also returned to American Idol on the May 23, 2007 Season 6 finale for the first time since its third season, performing \"Never Again\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry during a Beatles medley.\n\nKelly parted with her management on June 11, 2007, after the controversy surrounding My December. Kelly then signed with Starstruck Entertainment, run by Narvel Blackstock (the husband of Reba McEntire) on July 2, 2007.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Live Nation announced that Kelly's summer tour -- her first nationwide arena tour -- had been canceled due to underwhelming ticket sales, to be rescheduled after the release of My December at smaller, more intimate concert environments. Kelly reinstated plans to tour the U.S. during 2007, with a much smaller tour than the one that she canceled in June. Kelly began her My December Tour on October 10, 2007 in Verona, New York, in venues significantly smaller than those previously booked.\n\nMy December was officially released in the U.S. on June 26, 2007. On the date of the album's release, Kelly appeared on Good Morning America to promote her new album. Kelly performed songs from the album, including the single \"Never Again.\" Despite the controversy surrounding the album, it debuted at #2 in the U.S. with 291,000 albums sold (slightly higher debut than Breakaway, which debuted at #3).\n\nOn July 7, 2007, Kelly performed on the American leg of Live Earth. Her five-song performance set included \"Walk Away,\" \"How I Feel,\" \"Never Again,\" \"Sober,\" and \"Since U Been Gone.\"\n\nKelly was the celebrity coach for Canadian Idol during its Top 5 week of Season 5, and performed on the results show the next night. She was also awarded a Platinm Certification for shipments of more than 100,000 copies of My December in Canada. Kelly also performed at the 2007 NFL opening kickoff, where she sang the national anthem and performed songs from My December including \"Never Again,\" \"Maybe\" and \"Don't Waste Your Time.\" Kelly also performed in the halftime show for the Dallas Cowboys and New York Jets game on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nMy December was certified both gold and platinum on December 12, 2007, by the RIAA. It has sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide. Kelly also performed during the festivities of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. On April 25, 2007, Kelly appeared on Idol Gives Back and performed Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain.\" After the performance, the audience that watched her perform live gave her a standing ovation. American Idol judge Simon Cowell described her as \"incredible,\" saying, \"When you let her come back on the show it makes everybody else look like an amateur.\"\n\nIn addition to her roles as spokeswoman for the acne treatment Proactiv as well as Vitaminwater, Kelly partnered with NASCAR for the 2007 season. She appeared in televised advertising spots, performed at pre-race concerts, promoted NASCAR Day, and appeared at the Champions' Banquet in December. The August 2007 issue of Blender included a feature on Kelly and her new album, as well as her music label woes. Kelly also appeared at the NFL's opening night performance in Indanapolis for the kickoff of the new season.\n\nOn April 19, 2008, Kelly participated in a Papal Youth Rally at the campus of St Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie in Yonkers, New York, performing a mini-concert for those in attendance. This was the Papal Visit of Pope Benedict XVI. She performed Schubert's \"Ave Marie\" for the Pope later in the day following the Pope's speech. Kelly, raised a Baptist, was said to be honoured by the invitation and appreciative of the rosary given to her and her band by the Pope.\n\nCountry Music\n\nKelly performed \"What Hurts the Most\" with Rascal Flatts at ACM Awards in 2006 and returned again to sing a duet with Reba McEntire in 2007. This was her second performance on a country music award show, even though she is in the pop/rock genre. Along with her performance with Rascal Flatts, Kelly also performed \"Cigarettes\" with the country duo The Wreckers during one of their shows in Texas.\n\nBuilding on her country music status, Kelly and Reba McEntire recorded an hour-long CMT Crossroads special at Nashville's famed Ryman Auditorium on February 22, 2007. It aired on CMT and Palladia (then known as MHD) on June 24, 2007. Previously, Kelly was a performer on CMT's Giants: Reba McEntire, where she sang Reba's hit song \"Why Haven't I Heard From You,\" introduced Dolly Parton, and later also sang another of Reba's hits, \"Does He Love You,\" with Martina McBride. Kelly also appeared on an episode of Reba that aired January 14, 2007.\n\nAt the Academy of Country Music Awards on May 16, 2007, Kelly and Reba sang a duet of Kelly's 2005 single \"Because of You,\" which also became the lead single from Reba's album of all-star duets. The music video for this version of the song later debuted on June 20, 2007. This collaboration with Reba earned Kelly a CMA Award nomination for \"Musical Event of the Year\" in 2007 and a Grammy Award nomination for \"Best Country Collaboration With Vocal\" in 2008. Additionally, the song was featured on Now That's What I Call Country, which was released in August 2008.\n\nKelly was a surprise guest at the 2007 CMA Music Festival in Nashville on June 7, 2007, where she performed \"Does He Love You\" and \"Because of You\" with Reba McEntire during the internationally renowned annual event. The performance of \"Because of You\" was taped and aired as part of the CMA Music Festival: Country's Night to Rock television special that aired on ABC on July 23, 2007. On January 17, 2008, Kelly embarked on the 2 Worlds, 2 Voices Tour 2008, a co-headlining tour with Reba McEntire.\n\nOn May 18, 2008, Kelly performed on stage at the Academy of Country Music Awards All-Star Jam with Reba McEntire and Ronnie Dunn of Brooks and Dunn. The All-Star Jam is the final event of the week, taking place immediately after the awards show. Kelly was not announced ahead of time for an appearance.\n\nAll I Ever Wanted (2009)"
