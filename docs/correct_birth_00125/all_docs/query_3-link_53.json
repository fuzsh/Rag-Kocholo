        "text": "Singer-songwritier Kelly Clarkson could live anywhere in the United States, but since her \"American Idol\" win in 2002, her primary residence has been in Mansfield, TX, just 25 minutes outside Burleson, TX, where she grew up.\n\nHowever, it looks like Clarkson is ready to spread her wings; she has listed her Mansfield ranch for sale for $1.495 million. This is just her portion of the holdings she has in Mansfield â€” reports say she owns more than 50 acres; this listing is only for 14.\n\nWhile Clarkson did own another property in Nashville, she reportedly was only there part time and hoisted the home on the market in 2010.\n\nClarkson rocketed to fame after her win during the first season of \"American Idol.\" The two-time Grammy winner has a slew of hits under her belt and is currently a host on ABC's show \"Duets.\"\n\nClarkson's property for sale at 5986 Bennett Lawson Rd., Mansfield, TX 76063 is not only home to Clarkson but also her menagerie of rescue animals, which include several dogs, horses, miniature horses and a few pigs.\n\nBuilt in 1993, the home's grounds were largely customized by Clarkson and feature a man-made pond in the backyard, lap and diving pools, treehouse, dog runs and walking trails.\n\nInside, the 4-bedroom, 6-bath home has 6,880 square feet of living space, including dual master suites, theater room and gym.\n\nRelated:"
