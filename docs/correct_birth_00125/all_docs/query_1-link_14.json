        "text": "(born 1982). American singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson emerged as a pop-rock star after winning the first season of the popular television talent contest American Idol (2002–16). She used her voice, charisma, and humor to hook listeners and earn nationwide popularity.\n\nKelly Brianne Clarkson was born on April 24, 1982, in Fort Worth, Texas. She grew up in Burleson, a suburb of Fort Worth, where her seventh-grade choir teacher first recognized her vocal ability. After graduating from high school, Clarkson moved to Los Angeles, California, and unsuccessfully tried to break into show business. She returned to Texas, and in 2002 she became a contestant on the first season of American Idol, a singing competition that allowed viewers to vote for their favorite performer. Viewers supported Clarkson, and she won the competition, receiving $1 million and a recording contract with RCA.\n\nClarkson released her first single, “A Moment Like This,” just two weeks after her American Idol win. It quickly became a hit. Thankful, her debut album of pop songs, followed in 2003. With her second full-length album, Breakaway (2004), Clarkson moved beyond the pop sound into a rock environment. The album sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and featured the hit singles “Because of You,” “Behind These Hazel Eyes,” and “Since U Been Gone.” Breakaway and “Since U Been Gone” won Grammy Awards for best pop album and best pop vocal performance, respectively. Clarkson’s third album, My December (2007), was even more rock-oriented than her previous releases; she also cowrote each of the songs."
