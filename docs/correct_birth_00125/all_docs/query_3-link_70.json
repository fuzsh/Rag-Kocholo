We're always working constantly, so it's nice to just come out here and sit by the stream and hear the water flowing and be around all the trees.\"\n\n\"I just love the sound of just nature and not cars and people on top of each other,\" she adds. The video also shows the family riding horses and getting ready to roast s'mores outside by a fire.\n\n\"It's a really beautiful ranch, and it's a nice getaway for our family,\" Kelly says at the end of the clip. \"This is something Brandon and I have dreamed about since we were both kids. This is what we would call home.\""
