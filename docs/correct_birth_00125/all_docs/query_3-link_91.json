        "text": "Make a wish, take a chance, make a change – and move to New York.\n\nAppearing on Nancy O’Dell’s “TalkShopLive,” to promote her new album “Chemistry,” Kelly Clarkson, 42, revealed that the reason behind the talk show’s move to New York is that she and her family need a “fresh start.”\n\n“I was like ‘guys, I need you to know what’s happening,” said the “Since U Been Gone” singer. “‘Like it’s either. I’m not gonna be able to continue with the show or I gotta go like East Coast.’\n\nClarkson, who recently went through a very public divorce from Brandon Blackstock, said that she came to the decision to move the show during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Covid pointed out [that] being isolated and so far from your family… that’s not good for anyone,” said the “Breakaway” songstress. “And my family is East Coast, they’re North Carolina-based.”\n\n“So it was one of those things where I just had to… and also there was a lot of personal things going on, to where I feel like our family like me and my kids really needed a fresh start,” continued Clarkson. “It just could not get it here and there’s just hurdle after hurdle with things and I was like you know what, I was like I gotta go East Coast.”\n\nClarkson said the told the crew of her show about the impending move and how since she had a wonderful relationship with the crew “it kind of sucks to uproot it and move it.”\n\nAccording to the singer, the move was “100 percent my idea and it was really cool that NBC backed me.”\n\n“I was like, ‘Y’all, I love doing this show. I really do. I didn’t even know I would but I gotta make a change for me and my family. Any chance we could do this,'” said Clarkson. “I know we can’t do this from my ranch so any chance we could do it in New York [because] it’s at least closer to my family.’ That was really the main reason.”\n\nDuring the interview, the 42-year-old also said that being in New York would allow her to be closer to Broadway and teased that she was “in the works of writing something right now.”\n\n“I’m getting my show settled and we’re you know, establishing an amazing crew,” said Clarkson evading O’Dell’s question about writing something for the stage. “I’m focused wholly on the talk show for a minute. But I am also working on things in the background.”\n\nThe Post reached out to Clarkson for comment.\n\nClarkson’s move comes swiftly after a bombshell report from Rolling Stone said that several of the singer’s staffers were left “traumatized” after working with a certain producer on the show.\n\nThe singer responded to the allegations after she was slammed for posting a photo promoting her new music amid the “toxic work environment” claims.\n\n“In my 20 years in the entertainment industry, I’ve always led with my heart and what I believed to be right,” she wrote in a post shared on Instagram. “I love my team at ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show,’ and to find out that anyone is feeling unheard and or disrespected on this show is unacceptable.”\n\nThe singer concluded the post saying that always been and will continue to be” committed to creating “a safe and healthy environment” behind the scenes and will that will leadership training for all of the senior staff including herself."
