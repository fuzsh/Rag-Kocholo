Look no further than the Kokopelli ranch in Montana, a 400-acre property that recently hit the market for $6.75 million.\n\nThe custom log home overlooks the Rocky Mountains and the Anaconda Pintler Wilderness, located 20 minutes from the historic town of Philipsburg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current owners, Liz and Richard Willett, are originally from the UK and Kenya. They moved out to Montana full-time in 1997 after visiting the state frequently.\n\nBefore building the home, they camped out in various locations across the property to track down the best views of the sunrise and sunset, Liz told Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 5-bedroom home is constructed from logs salvaged from a wildfire in Oregon, she said, because they didn't want to cut down any living trees.\n\nThe home is perfect for \"somebody that really loves the mountains, loves the land, and likes to entertain,\" she told Insider. \"This is quite a decent-sized house.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext up is the luxury kitchen ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... complete with this cozy breakfast nook ...\n\n... and a formal dining area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interior was \"painstakingly\" designed to capture the views \"from virtually every location in the home,\" according to the real estate listing.\n\nHead upstairs to the library, where you'll find a sculpture of a bald eagle mid-flight made by Oregon artist Paul Stark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe house's wooden sculptures were also made from the logs salvaged from the wildfire, Liz told Insider.\n\nThe home has five bedrooms, starting with this master suite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe town of Philipsburg has roughly 900 residents and is a \"very welcoming and diverse community,\" Liz said.\n\nIt has \"really all the things you need,\" she continued, including a \"good grocery store and wonderful chocolate shop.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple has four children, now grown, who frequently stayed at the ranch. They also keep six horses in the two-stall horse barn outside.\n\nThe house also has 6.5 bathrooms and a three-car garage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the bathtub has expansive views of the outdoors.\n\nDespite the ranch's remote location, Liz says the small community is tight-knit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Particularly when I visit other towns, I realized how fortunate we are here,\" she said. \"It's just a very nice community, people help each other.\"\n\nRead next\n\nReal Estate\n\nAdvertisement"
