        "text": "Kelly Clarkson's Hometown Home!\n\nMust SeeTop 10 Florida Condos For Sale\n\nEveryone knows singer-songwriter-actress Kelly as being the very first winner of American Idol. Since that magic moment back in 2002, she has taken the world by storm, winning two Grammys among numerous other awards both here and abroad.\n\nKelly can’t seem to figure out where she wants to live - or, maybe she just hasn’t told anyone. First she sold her Nashville home and now she’s selling her totally stunning mini-ranch of 14.81 acres just 25 miles outside her hometown of Burleston, TX. It’s a beautiful farm for a gentleman hobby farmer who likes to keep a couple of horses or possibly the new livestock rage, a small herd of boer goats.\n\nThe 6,880sf home is filled with beautiful details and is a perfect mix of casual and elegant. The southern-style columned porches are wide and gracious and we particularly love that the bathrooms have wonderful bathtubs - just the type you want to spend hours in a bubble bath up to your neck! Every room is spacious and inviting and the master has a charming sitting area and dual baths. There are 4 bedrooms, six baths, a large media room and huge mirrored gym. Outside there is a lovely pool and spa as well as a pond that Kelly added. Large shade trees and shrubs dot the landscape and there is a six-car garage.\n\nKelly Clarkson’s stunning and very livable Texas estate. Priced at $1.495m"
