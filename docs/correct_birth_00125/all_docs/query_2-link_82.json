        "text": "After a series of disappointments in the industry, Clarkson auditioned for American Idol in 2002, and went on to win the very first season. She signed with RCA Records and released her debut studio album Thankful in 2003. Her second and third albums, Breakaway and My December followed in 2004 and 2007, respectively.\n\nIn 2007, Clarkson began exploring sounds outside of pop. She performed a country rendition of 'Because of You' with Reba McEntire, who included it on her album Reba: Duets. The song was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nIn 2010, Clarkson dueted with Jason Aldean on 'Don't You Wanna Stay'. It went to number one on Billboard's Hot Country charts, and was also nominated for a Grammy.\n\nBased off that shift, Clarkson's 2011 album Stronger featured a slightly more country sound. The CMAs nominated her for Female Vocalist of the Year in 2012.\n\nClarkson released her eighth studio album Meaning of Life in 2017.\n\nIn 2019, she began serving as a coach on The Voice. Clarkson also hosts her own daytime television show. She won a Daytime Emmy for hosting in 2021. The Kelly Clarkson Show is slated to take over Ellen DeGeneres' time slot when the long-running program Ellen ends in 2022."
