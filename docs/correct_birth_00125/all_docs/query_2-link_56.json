        "text": "Profession: Singer\n\nBiography: Kelly Clarkson is an American who came to fame in 2002 after winning the first season of American Idol. Her first single, 'A Moment Like This' (2002), topped the US Billboard Hit 100 and was the best-selling single of that year. She then released her debut album, Thankful (2003), which topped the Billboard 200.\n\nSince her artistic debut, Clarkson has progressively sought distance from her origins on American Idol and to assert her creative independence. She made a first step towards this with her second studio album, Breakaway (2004), which was more pop rock oriented.\n\nShe has subsequently released several further studio albums, with her fourth such, All I Ever Wanted (2009), reaching number one and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. This was her second time achieving each of these feats, after her second studio album, Breakaway.\n\nClarkson has since continued to remain a feature in the American music scene as well as globally, having sold over 28 million albums and 54 million singles worldwide. She has also had a television career, serving as a coach on The Voice for several seasons and since 2019 with her own talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\nBorn: April 24, 1982\n\nBirthplace: Fort Worth, Texas, USA\n\nAge: 42 years old"
