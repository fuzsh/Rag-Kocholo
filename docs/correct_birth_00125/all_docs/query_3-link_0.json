        "text": "From humble beginnings in a small town in Texas to hosting her own talk show and becoming a Coach on The Voice, Kelly Clarkson’s talent launched her to stardom — but where did the superstar grow up?\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch the Season 26 premiere of The Voice on Monday, September 23 at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nMany have noticed the three-time Grammy winner’s accent and use of the word “y’all” during The Voice, so it’s safe to assume she’s not originally from Los Angeles, which is where she films The Kelly Clarkson Show and The Voice.\n\nClarkson was actually born in Fort Worth, Texas, according to Women’s Health, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Burleson.\n\nShe even stayed close to home after winning American Idol in 2002, with Forbes reporting she listed her ranch for sale in Mansfield — just 25 minutes from Burleson — for $1.495 million in 2012.\n\nClarkson then sold her mega-mansion near Nashville, Tennessee as part of her move to Los Angeles to film her talk show and The Voice. Her Nashville home was on a wooded lakefront and had more than 20,000 square feet, with seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, and a built-in home theater. The four-acre property also included a sand volleyball court, pool, and a children’s playland in the backyard, according to Taste of Country.\n\nNow, Clarkson calls California home. She recently bought a 5,000-square foot home in Toluca Lake, California for $5.4 million to share with her children, according to Hello. It reportedly has five bedrooms, an outdoor pool, a tennis court, a guest house, and an outdoor playground.\n\nRELATED: This Audition Made Blake Accuse Kelly of Calling Niall a \"Liar\"\n\nClarkson also took fans on a tour of her $10 million Montana ranch, named Vintage Valley, in a segment for The Kelly Clarkson Show — the spot where she rode out the coronavirus pandemic in the early days of 2020. She described her love of wide, open spaces after growing up in the country, and noted how relaxing it is to get away from her busy life at times.\n\n“I just love being outdoors,” Clarkson said during the segment. “It’s nice to get into nature. As a society we don’t do it enough, we’re always working constantly, so it’s nice to just come out here and sit by the stream, and hear the water flowing, and be around all the trees. I just love the sound of nature, and not cars, and people all on top of each other.”\n\nClarkson’s tour included fire pits and horses running around outdoors. She also took us inside the one-room cabin where the family stayed. She then showed off a large king-size bed, and next to it, two bunks where her children sleep. The cozy cabin also has other seating, a kitchenette — and a framed picture of Dolly Parton.\n\n“This is just our little cabin that we hang out in,” Clarkson said, as she showed fans a fireplace. “And there’s games and puzzles, because my kids love puzzles.”"
