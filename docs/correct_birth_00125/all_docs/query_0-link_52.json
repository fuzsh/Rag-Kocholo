        "text": "What Famous Musicians are from Dallas?\n\nWhile Dallas may not get quite the notoriety Austin does in the music industry, it’s been the starting point for a few of the biggest names in the industry. And while many have moved on since hitting big, their Dallas roots often shine through in the music and beyond.\n\nErykiah Badu\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nDixie Chicks\n\nMeat Loaf\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nThe Old 97s\n\nPolyphonic Spree\n\nPost Malone\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but will give you a cue that Dallas is no slouch in producing not just singers, but entertainers as well.\n\nErykah Badu\n\nBorn Erica Abi Wright in Dallas, Erykah Badu graduated from Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and is known for her soulful music, distinctive style, and activism. She still makes her home in Dallas and has been an influential figure on the Dallas music scene. Badu is also an actress, earning acclaim for her role in The Cider House Rules.\n\nRecognized for her innovative blend of R&B, soul, funk, hip-hop, and jazz, creating a unique sound often referred to as neo-soul. Her debut album, “Baduizm,” released in 1997, brought her widespread acclaim and featured hit singles like “On & On” and “Next Lifetime.” She has won four Grammy Awards, several other awards, and her albums have sold more than seven million copies.\n\nBadu brought the Black Forest Theater in South Dallas back to life, where it serves as a community center that celebrates art and culture. The venue has hosted several charity events, headlined by some of the biggest names in the industry. Prince, Snoop Dogg, Talib Kweli, and Questlove to name a few.\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan was known for his mastery of blues music–many credit him with the revival of the genre–and his passionate playing style. Born in 1954 in Dallas, he began his meteoric rise to stardom by playing in clubs throughout Dallas and Texas as a whole. Vaughan’s musical style was a fusion of traditional blues with elements of rock, jazz, and R&B, and he’s viewed as one of the greatest guitarists in history.\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan’s breakthrough came with the release of his debut album “Texas Flood” in 1983, which showcased his incredible guitar playing and deep blues influences. His commercial success continued with albums like “Couldn’t Stand the Weather” (1984), “Soul to Soul” (1985), and “In Step” (1989).\n\nVaughan and his band Double Trouble have won multiple Grammy, Austin Music, and W.C. Handy awards. His impact on the blues genre was immense, and his influence extended beyond his lifetime. His technical skill, emotional depth in playing, and a revival of interest in blues music among younger generations continue to be felt.\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nBorn in 1982, in Fort Worth, Texas, Kelly Clarkson grew up in Burleson, a suburb of Fort Worth, and attended high school there. Clarkson gained widespread fame by winning the first season of the reality television singing competition “American Idol” in 2002. Her victory on the show served as the launchpad for her successful music career.\n\nClarkson’s debut single “A Moment Like This” became a hit and showcased her powerful voice and pop sensibilities. She went on to release successful albums, including “Thankful” (2003), “Breakaway” (2004), and “Stronger” (2011). Clarkson occasionally references her Texas roots and experiences in her music and public appearances.\n\nIn addition to her music career, Kelly Clarkson ventured into television as a coach on “The Voice” and later hosted “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” showcasing her charismatic personality and versatility beyond music. A three-time Grammy award winner, she has also won several daytime Emmy awards.\n\nDixie Chicks\n\nThe Dixie Chicks, an American country music band, originated in Dallas, Texas, in 1989. The group was initially formed with founding members Martie Erwin Maguire and her sister Emily Erwin Robison, along with Laura Lynch. They performed locally in the Dallas area but didn’t hit it big until the arrival of Natalie Maines.\n\nHer addition brought a new dynamic to the band and significantly impacted their sound and success. They gained popularity for their blend of country and bluegrass music, coupled with their vocal harmonies and compelling songwriting. Their breakthrough came with the release of their major-label debut, “Wide Open Spaces,” in 1998, which produced hit singles and earned critical acclaim.\n\nTheir albums “Fly” and “Home” solidified their position as one of the most successful country acts of their time. They’ve won 13 Grammy Awards, 10 Country Music Association Awards, 8 Academy of Country Music Awards, and scads of other awards across the world. The Dixie Chicks, now known simply as The Chicks, have sold more than 30 million albums, making them one of the best-selling female bands in the U.S. of all time.\n\nMeat Loaf\n\nFew artists had a bigger presence on the music scene than the iconic Meat Loaf. Born Marvin Lee Aday in 1947 in Dallas, he was an American singer, songwriter, and actor who made a significant impact in the music industry. While he first gained attention as an actor in musicals–most notably “Hair”–it was his 1977 album “Bat Out of Hell” that launched him into the stratosphere.\n\nSelling more than 43 million copies worldwide, the album featured epic rock ballads “Paradise by the Dashboard Light” and “Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad.” This puts this Dallas original firmly in the top 10 best-selling albums of all time, besting the top albums of Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, and Fleetwood Mac.\n\nIn addition to his music, Meat Loaf had a notable acting career, appearing in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975), “Fight Club” (1999) and other movies. Meat Loaf passed away in January 2022, leaving behind a rich musical legacy that continues to resonate with audiences.\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nAlthough she was born in New Mexico, Demi Lovato moved to Dallas at a young age and it was in the DFW where she began her entertainment career. Thanks to another Dallas product–”Barney and Friends”–she got her start in show business and in 2008 starred in Disney’s “Camp Rock.”\n\nBut now she’s a singer of the highest order. She has sold nearly 10 million albums and her music has been downloaded millions and millions of times. She has covered multiple genres, from pop to rock to R&B and continues to be seen on the big and small screens.\n\nShe has won multiple People’s Choice, Teen Choice, and ASCAP Pop Music awards while being twice nominated for a Grammy. Along with her entertainment bonafides, she has also been an ambassador for LGBT and mental health issues, being honored in both fields for her work.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nMuch like Lovata, Selena Gomez got her start alongside Barney the dinosaur before moving on to Disney channel stardom. She was born in 1992 in Grand Prairie, and pursued a music career that paralleled her acting. She formed the band Selena Gomez & the Scene, releasing albums like “Kiss & Tell” (2009), “A Year Without Rain” (2010), and “When the Sun Goes Down” (2011).\n\nTransitioning into a solo career, Selena Gomez released her solo album “Stars Dance” in 2013, featuring hits like “Come & Get It.” She continued to release successful albums, including “Revival” (2015) and “Rare” (2020), earning critical acclaim for her music’s evolution. She has won innumerable awards, for both her music as well as for her cosmetic line, Rare Beauty.\n\nThe Old 97s\n\nFormed in 1993, The Old 97’s is an American alternative country rock band that has been an influential part of the music scene for decades. The founding members include Rhett Miller (vocals/guitar), Ken Bethea (guitar), Murry Hammond (bass/vocals), and Philip Peeples (drums). They play a fusion of alt-country, rock, and punk, creating a sound that blends energetic rock rhythms with a classic country feel.\n\nOver the years, the band released numerous albums that received critical acclaim and added to their growing fan base. Albums like “Too Far to Care” (1997), “Fight Songs” (1999), and “Most Messed Up” (2014) are some of their well-known works. The Old 97’s are highly regarded for their influential contributions to the alt-country and rock music genres.\n\nPolyphonic Spree\n\nThe Polyphonic Spree is an American choral symphonic pop rock band known for their large ensemble and vibrant, theatrical live performances. Formed in 2000 by Tim DeLaughter, the band is renowned for its size, often consisting of around 20 to 30 members on stage, including a choir, strings, horns, percussion, and more, creating a visually and musically striking presence.\n\nTheir debut album, “The Beginning Stages of…” released in 2002, introduced their distinctive sound and garnered critical praise for its ambitious and joyous musicality. Their music found popularity with songs like “Light & Day/Reach for the Sun” and “Hold Me Now,” showcasing their uplifting, anthemic style. Other albums include “Together We’re Heavy” (2004), “The Fragile Army” (2007), and “Yes, It’s True” (2013).\n\nPost Malone\n\nPost Malone, whose real name is Austin Richard Post, was born in 1995 in Syracuse, New York, before moving to Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, where he developed an interest in music. He began creating music and gained attention for his unique blend of hip-hop, R&B, and rock influences.\n\nHis breakthrough hit came with the song “White Iverson,” which he recorded and released in 2015. Post Malone’s debut album, “Stoney,” released in 2016, solidified his position in the music world. The album included popular tracks like “Congratulations” and “Go Flex.” His music is known for its genre-blending style, combining elements of rap, rock, and pop. His unique voice, melodic hooks, and emotive lyrics have contributed to his widespread popularity."
