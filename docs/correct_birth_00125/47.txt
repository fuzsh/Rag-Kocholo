Kelly Clarkson announced she will have a residency in Las Vegas in 2020.

The Grammy Award-winner is excited for her "home away from home" in Sin City.

Kelly is originally from Fort Worth, Texas, but she resides in Los Angeles where she films The Kelly Clarkson Show.

Kelly Clarkson is stoked for her new home away from home. The singer is preparing for a residency in Las Vegas next year.

“I’m able to do things with this show that I’ve never been able to carry out on the road,” she told Billboard. “We get to stay for a bit, see and hang with fans, and then you’re not having to travel every night to a different city which can be exhausting. I’m stoked to have a home away from home [in Vegas].”

But where does Kelly actually live? She bought a home in Los Angeles recently, per Country Living, and films her talkshow, The Kelly Clarkson Show, in Universal City, California. If you've tuned in for a "weekday hang", you probably noticed her distinct drawl. The three-time Grammy Award-winner has a noticeable accent and often uses the word "y'all" when interviewing her guests, so it's pretty obvious she's not originally from Los Angeles either.

Kelly hails from the Lone Star State, per IMDB. She was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Burleson, Texas, and graduated from Burleson High School.
