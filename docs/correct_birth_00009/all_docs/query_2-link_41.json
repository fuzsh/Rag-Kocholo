        "text": "Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969) is one of only two American presidents of German extraction. (The other was Herbert Hoover.)\n\nAfter serving as Allied supreme commander in World War II, Eisenhower became the 34th president of the U.S. (1953-1961).\n\nOn Oct. 14, 1890 in Denison, Texas, Dwight David Eisenhower was born into a German-American family that goes back to Johann Nicolaus Eisenhauer (ca. 1691-ca. 1760) who came to America with his son Johann Peter in 1741 and settled in Pennsylvania.
