        "text": "DENISON, Texas (KXII) -- For those who are looking for an educational trip for their summer, families can learn about the life of former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower at his birthplace in Denison.\n\nEisenhower's birthplace was purchased by the Denison community in 1946. Visitors can learn about not only the former president himself, but can get a tour of his house to learn about what life was like in the 1800s.\n\nEisenhower was born in Denison Oct. 14, 1890 where he lived there until 1892 when his family moved to Kansas.\n\nYou can also see the Katy railroad that is located outside the home and see the Eisenhower statue also located outside his house.\n\nWhat makes this place unique from other destinations in Texoma is the connection that Eisenhower's birthplace has to history.\n\n\"Well it's a presidential birth site and so we're linked to presidential history here,\" educator Carolyn Villareal said. \"And so not only are we focusing on life in 1890, but because this is the birthplace of Dwight Eisenhower, then we can also look at his role as general, supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe in World War Two, and then of course as our 34th president.\"\n\nFamilies can check out the house from 9 a.m. -5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday from 1-5 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nAdults are $4, students are $3, and from Memorial Day to Labor Day, active duty service members and their families can enter for free."
