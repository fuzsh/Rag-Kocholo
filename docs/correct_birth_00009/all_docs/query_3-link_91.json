        "text": "Dwight Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890. His parents were David Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover Eisenhower. The Eisenhower family moved to Abilene, Kansas, in 1892, where Eisenhower lived until 1911. In 1916, Eisenhower married Mamie Geneva Doud, with whom he had two children, only one of whom, David, survived to reach adulthood.\n\nEisenhower graduated from Abilene High School in 1909. In 1911, he entered the United States Military Academy. Eisenhower graduated in 1915 and was commissioned a second lieutenant. In 1916, Eisenhower was promoted to first lieutenant; captain in 1917; major (temporary) and lieutenant colonel (temporary) in 1918. He was reverted to the permanent rank of captain and was promoted to major in 1920. He entered the Command and General Staff School, Ft. Leavenworth, KS, in 1925. In 1927, he attended the Army War College, Washington, DC. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1936. Following the start of World War II, Eisenhower received several promotions: in 1941, colonel (temporary), brigadier general (temporary); in 1942, major general (temporary), lieutenant general (temporary); in 1943, general (four stars) (temporary), brigadier general (permanent), and major general (permanent); in 1945, General of the Army (five stars). In 1948, Eisenhower was inaugurated as President, Columbia University in New York. He was named the Supreme Allied Commander, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1950. In 1952, under consideration by both major political parties for their nominations, he was so popular that his campaign slogan was I Like Ike. Eisenhower was elected as a Republican as the thirty-fourth president of the United States. He served as the president from 1953 to 1961. After serving as president, Eisenhower retired to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nEisenhower's literary career, while not nearly as well-known as his political or military careers, was very important. He wrote many books about World War II, his presidency, and his personal life: Eisenhower's Own Story of the War: The Complete Report by the Supreme Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, on the War in Europe from the Day of Invasion to the Day of Victory (1946); Crusade in Europe (1948); Sir Winston Churchill: Champion of Freedom (1965); The White House Years Vols I & II(1963-1965); In Review, Pictures I've Kept: A Concise Pictorial Autobiography (1969); The Eisenhower Diaries (1981); and others. His works were significant in that they gave the public some insight into the mind of a military and political genius. Eisenhower also contributed articles to Reader's Digest, Saturday Evening Post, and other magazines. He wrote speeches, addresses, government papers, and military reports published by the U.S. Government Printing Office and other government and public organizations. Eisenhower did not earn literary awards with his many publications, but his fame and popularity as a military officer and as president of the United States made his works popular nonetheless.\n\nAfter suffering heart attacks in 1965 and 1968, General Dwight D. Eisenhower died on March 28, 1969, at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, DC. He was buried in the Place of Meditation at the Eisenhower Center, Abilene, Kansas, on April 2, 1969."
