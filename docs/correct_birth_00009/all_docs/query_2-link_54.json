        "text": "About This Statue\n\nDwight David Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890. His family moved to Abilene, Kansas, when he was less than a year old. He was a star halfback at the Military Academy at West Point until a knee injury ended his football career.\n\nIn June 1942 Eisenhower was given command of all U.S. forces in the European Theater of Operations. He directed the invasions of Africa, Sicily, and Italy and then was called to take command of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, in preparation for the invasion of France. After the success of the D-Day landing, he continued to direct the Allied forces through the end of the war.\n\nEisenhower commanded the occupation forces for six months and then succeeded General George C. Marshall as Army chief of staff.\n\nHe was selected to command NATO military forces.\n\nIn 1952 he was elected the nation's thirty-fourth president; he was reelected in 1956.\n\nThe campaign slogan \"I Like Ike\" reflected widespread appreciation of Eisenhower's sincerity, generosity, and kindness.\n\nHis time in office saw the end of the Korean War, the continuation of the Cold War, and the beginning of school desegregation.\n\nHe died on March 28, 1969, and is buried in Abilene, Kansas"
