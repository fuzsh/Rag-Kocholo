        "text": "Only two American presidents were born in Texas, and the first was Dwight David “Ike” Eisenhower.\n\nU.S. Army Gen. Eisenhower’s role in winning World War II prompted Denison’s citizens to make the hero’s birthplace a memorial. Eisenhower’s first visit back to his birthplace was in 1946, as a war hero. Encouraged by friends to seek our nation’s highest office, Eisenhower hit the campaign trail and returned to Denison in 1952. In 1953, Eisenhower became the 34th President of the United States, increasing the historical importance of the little wood-frame house at the corner of Lamar and Day streets."
