        "text": "Eisenhower State Park, on the shores of Lake Texoma, opened to the public in 1958. The park was named for the 34th U.S. president, Dwight David Eisenhower, as he was born nearby. In the early 1830s, the area became increasingly important to Anglo settlers, particularly as a route to Texas and the American southwest. Some of the things which add to the history of the area are the Butterfield Overland stage routes; Chisholm and Shawnee cattle drive trails. Popular activities at the park include picnicking, hiking, biking, nature study, fishing, boating and boat rentals, water skiing, swimming, wildlife observation, ATV and mini bike use (OHV permit required), and camping.\n\nWatch our Life on the Trail video to learn more about the Chisholm Trail in Texas.
