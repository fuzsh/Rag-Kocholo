Born in Oxford in 1942, 300 years to the day after the death of Galileo, Hawking did not at first seem destined for greatness. (True, as a boy he added plumbing and lighting to his sister’s dollhouse, but this would seem to mark him out for nothing more than a career as a general contractor.)

An uncommonly bright but lazy undergrad, Hawking estimates he averaged an hour of work a day during his three years at Oxford. But diagnosed with motor neurone disease at age 21 and given two years to live, he shifted into high gear.

Marriage and a PhD followed. Then his work on black holes and the early universe brought fame, as did his discovery (sounds obvious but he assures us otherwise) that when two black holes collide they form a bigger one.

In the 1980s he wrote “the airport novel” of physics books, the bestselling A Brief History of Time. Since then, honours and accolades, famous fans (everyone from Jim Carrey to Buzz Aldrin) and continued delving into the mechanics of the universe.

“Sometimes I wonder if I am as famous for my … disabilities as I am for my discoveries,” Hawking, now 71, muses. But clearly his far-reaching intellect outshines anything so earthbound as a wheelchair.

Hawking opened at the Bell Lightbox in Toronto on Nov. 29.
