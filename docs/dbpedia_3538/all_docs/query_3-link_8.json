        "text": "The following is a non-exhaustive list of people who have declined a British honour, such as a knighthood or other grade of honour.\n\nIn most cases, the offer of an honour was rejected privately. Nowadays, potential recipients are contacted before any public announcement to confirm in writing that they wish to be put forward for an honour, thereby avoiding friction or controversy. However, some have let it be known that the offer was declined, and there have also been occasional leaks from official sources. A handful of people have accepted and later renounced an honour; these are listed at the end of the article.\n\nIn 2003, Sunday Times published a list of almost 300 people who had declined an honour between 1951 and 1999.[1] In 2020, The Guardian reported based on a Freedom of Information request, that the number of people refusing an honour in 2020 was 68 out of 2,504 offered, or 2.7%.[2] The number of people rejecting a British honour has doubled in the last decade.[3]\n\nReasons for rejection\n\n[edit]\n\nHonours are rejected for a variety of reasons. Some potential recipients have rejected one honour then accepted another (such as Sir Alfred Hitchcock[4]), or have initially refused an honour then accepted it,[who?] or have accepted one honour then declined another (such as actor Robert Morley[5]) or refused in the hope of another higher distinction (Roald Dahl refused being decorated as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire,[4] allegedly because he wanted a knighthood so that his wife Felicity would be entitled to be known as \"Lady Dahl\"; Felicity was herself appointed DBE in 2024).[6]\n\nSometimes, a potential recipient refuses a knighthood or peerage but accepts an honour that does not bestow a title (or precedence), such as the Order of Merit or the Order of the Companions of Honour. Examples are E. M. Forster, Paul Scofield, Doris Lessing, Harold Pinter (although Pinter's widow, Lady Antonia Fraser, was later appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire),[7] David Hockney, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Augustus John, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Francis Crick and Paul Dirac.\n\nSome may refuse an honour based on political reasons, relating to the British state or the Royal Family. Nationalists of the constituent countries may prefer awards from their respective nations, such as Welsh nationalists refusing British awards for Welsh awards such as from the Gorsedd or St David Awards.[8][9][10][11][12] In 2022, when Gareth Bale accepted appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire, some Welsh football supporters opposed and criticised his decision, describing him as \"no longer a Welsh legend\" because of his acceptance.[13] A columnist at The National, a Welsh-based newspaper, stated: \"There is a duty to refuse honours from the current British state as a way of rejecting the colonial connotations of the gongs themselves.\"[14]\n\nHonours declined\n\n[edit]\n\nKingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1657, Oliver Cromwell, already Head of State and Head of Government as Lord Protector, was offered the crown by Parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement; he had been \"instrumental\" in abolishing the monarchy after the English Civil War. Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. In a speech on 13 April 1657, he gave his opinion that the office of monarch, once abolished, should stay so: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build Jericho again.\"[15]\n\nDukedom\n\n[edit]\n\nSir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister, was twice offered a dukedom, once as Duke of Dover by George VI and another as Duke of London by Queen Elizabeth II, but declined both in order to remain in the House of Commons, and to allow his son Randolph a political career. Randolph died only three years after his father, so the dukedom would have had little time to affect his career as he had already been out of the Commons for ten years.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, Prime Minister (1880); had previously accepted the Earldom of Beaconsfield.[16]\n\nHenry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, politician (1857).\n\nRobert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, Prime Minister (1886,[17] and 1892 and possibly in 1901[18]) â€“ citing the prohibitive cost of the lifestyle that dukes were expected to maintain. According to Scribner's Magazine in 1900, \"It is true that the Marquis of Salisbury might have been a Duke if he had not regarded his marquisate as a prouder title than a new dukedom could furnish.\"[19]\n\nPrince Louis of Battenberg (1917) during the First World War, when he was forced to renounce his German title. Offered a dukedom by George V, but declined as he could not afford the lavish lifestyle expected of a duke; accepted the Marquessate of Milford Haven instead.[20]\n\nMaria Fitzherbert, mistress and wife (in a marriage never considered valid in England) of George IV; his brother William IV, hearing her story after George's death, asked her to accept a dukedom but she refused, asking only permission to wear widow's weeds, and to dress her servants in royal livery.[21]\n\nMarquessate\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Marquess\n\nSir Alexander Cambridge, formerly Prince Alexander of Teck (1917); accepted the Earldom of Athlone instead.\n\nHenry Lascelles, 5th Earl of Harewood (1922); he reportedly held the belief that marquessates tended to die out more quickly than earldoms.\n\nJohn Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer (1890s).\n\nEarldom\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Earl\n\nHenry Addington (on his retirement as Prime Minister declined the Earldom of Banbury in 1804 as he wished to remain in the Commons; later accepted the Viscountcy of Sidmouth).\n\nLeo Amery, politician (declined in 1945).\n\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (declined the Earldom of Belmont in 1905 when it was offered to him in a plot to elevate him to the House of Lords and make him an ineffective Prime Minister in the Relugas Compact).[22]\n\nArthur Balfour, former Prime Minister (in 1919,[23] accepted the Earldom of Balfour in 1922).\n\nR. A. Butler, politician (in 1964; accepted life peerage as Baron Butler of Saffron Walden in 1965).\n\nHenry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, declined the Earldom of Wiltshire on his death bed in 1596.\n\nNeville Chamberlain (on his retirement as Prime Minister in 1940, also declined appointment as KG).\n\nHenry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, , politician (in 1809).\n\nAnthony Eden (on his retirement as Prime Minister in 1957; later accepted the Earldom of Avon in 1961).\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, Prime Minister (in 1885).\n\nWilliam Legge, had also declined a knighthood; his son was created Baron Dartmouth instead.[24]\n\nHarold Macmillan (on his retirement as Prime Minister in 1963; later accepted the Earldom of Stockton in 1984).\n\nAngus Ogilvy (in 1963, upon his marriage to Princess Alexandra of Kent; later accepted a knighthood in 1988).\n\nMark Phillips (in 1973, upon his marriage to Princess Anne; accepted a CVO in 1974).\n\nR. H. Tawney (twice declined an earldom, in 1920s and 1940s. Replied to Ramsay MacDonald's offer by asking what harm he had ever done the Labour Party, and to the offer from Clement Attlee he averred that he was surprised that Labour was still interested in such baubles).[25]\n\nViscountcy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Viscount\n\nCharles Booth, disenchanted with politics, declined Gladstone's overtures; created a Privy Counsellor by Balfour in 1904.\n\nJohn Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham, writer, historian and politician.\n\nArthur Henderson, declined offer of peerage by Ramsay MacDonald in 1931.\n\nJohn Henry Whitley, retiring Speaker of the House of Commons (in 1928).\n\nBarony\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Baron\n\nGeorge Macaulay Booth, director of the Bank of England; declined Lloyd George's offer.\n\nLeonard Knight Elmhirst, philanthropist; declined Clement Attlee's offer in 1946, replying: \"My own work, however, as you know, has lain in the main among country people ... in India, the USA and in Devonshire ... acceptance would neither be easy for me to explain nor easy for my friends to comprehend.\"[26]\n\nSir Thomas Holderness, retiring Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India, refused in 1920 on financial grounds, although he accepted a baronetcy.[27]\n\nBilly Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia; declined Lloyd George's offer in 1916.[28]\n\nAdmiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. Offered in 1945 for his services as Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia Command; declined as both Field Marshals Harold Alexander and Bernard Montgomery had accepted viscountcies.[29] He received a viscountcy in the 1946 Birthday Honours, followed by an earldom for his service as the last Viceroy of India in August 1947.\n\nSir Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to the Sovereign; declined in 1953 as he felt titles to be a show of self-importance.[30]\n\nT. P. O'Connor, journalist and Irish Nationalist MP 1880â€“1929, declined the offer from Lloyd George.\n\nFrank Pick, Chief Executive of London Transport in the 1930s.\n\nJoseph Strutt, soldier and MP, declined all honours, but suggested the offer (of the barony of Rayleigh) be transferred to his wife instead, which was done.\n\nLife peerage (barony)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Life peer\n\nFormer Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom\n\nLife peerages are customarily offered to all former British Prime Ministers when they step down as a Member of Parliament (MPs). The last former Prime Minister to accept a peerage was Theresa May in 2024 upon announcing her decision to step down from the House of Commons. Prior to May, the last former Prime Minister to accept a peerage upon leaving the Commons was Margaret Thatcher in 1992, and her husband, Denis, was created a baronet. Three of her successors â€“ John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown â€“ declined a peerage, whilst Rishi Sunak continues to serve as MP. Boris Johnson, who had resigned from the Commons after a Parliamentary Committee report found he had misled Parliament over the Partygate affair, was not offered a peerage. Liz Truss, who lost re-election in 2024, was not offered a peerage.\n\nSir Edward Heath, in 2001. Remaining in the House of Commons for over 25 years after his premiership, Heath personally disapproved of political honours while realising their usefulness as a source of political patronage.\n\nSir John Major, in 2001. Major thought a seat in the House of Lords was incompatible with retiring from politics; he later accepted appointment as Knight of the Garter.[31]\n\nSir Tony Blair, in 2007. Blair stated that the House of Lords was \"not my sort of thing\". In 1999, Blair's government had significantly reduced the size of the House of Lords.[32] Later, akin to John Major, Blair accepted a knighthood as a KG in the 2022 New Year Honours.\n\nGordon Brown, in 2015. Brown declined on principle, as an advocate for an elected upper house.\n\nOthers\n\nIsaiah Berlin, , philosopher (in 1980).[4]\n\nRodney Bickerstaffe, trade union leader and socialist; General Secretary of UNISON. Declined Blair's offer in 2000, reportedly saying that to accept would betray his socialist beliefs.[33][34]\n\nAlbert Booth, Labour MP and Cabinet Minister 1974-79\n\nJohn Cleese, film and television actor, comedian (in 1999; stated that he \"did not wish to spend winters in England\" and being a peer would be \"ridiculous\", had previously declined appointment as CBE in 1996).[4][35]\n\nConstance Cummings, actress in 1975[36]\n\nJean Floud, sociologist, Nuffield College Oxford. Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge, declined a peerage (in 1978).\n\nMichael Foot, former Labour Party Leader.[37]\n\nJohn Freeman, Labour MP, journalist, broadcaster, diplomat, and businessman.[38]\n\nJim (James) Griffiths Labour MP, first Welsh secretary.[39]\n\nGeoffrey Goodman, journalist.[40]\n\nRay Gunter Labour politician, President of TSSA union; MP for Southwark; Cabinet minister 1964â€“70, declined offer in 1972,[41]\n\nJoe Haines, Press Secretary Prime Minister Harold Wilson 1964-70 [42]\n\nMargaret Herbison, Labour politician (in 1976)[36]\n\nThomas Jackson, trade union leader, 1979.[43]\n\nJack Jones, trade union leader, on several occasions, as he advocated the abolition of the House of Lords.[44]\n\nBruce Millan, Labour MP; Secretary of State for Scotland 1976-9; EU Commissioner.\n\nCardinal Murphy-O'Connor, Roman Catholic Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster (in 2009; reportedly on advice from the Holy See due to concerns that it would compromise the Church's impartiality and a prohibition in canon law on priests holding political office).[45][46]\n\nStan Newens, Labour MP for Harlow; declined a proposed peerage from Michael Foot in 1983.\n\nEnoch Powell, Conservative and Ulster Unionist MP.[citation needed]\n\nJ. B. Priestley, novelist and playwright (in 1965).[47]\n\nSir Joseph Robinson, 1st Baronet, a South African mining magnate, declined a peerage in 1922 after controversy arose regarding his nomination, which was given in exchange for political contributions.\n\nNorman Willis, General-Secretary, TUC.\n\nGeorge Woodcock, General Secretary TUC, accepted a CBE.\n\nTony Woodley, former General Secretary of Unite, initially turned down two offers of a peerage in 2018 and August 2020, before accepting in November 2020.[48][49]\n\nAs a part of the House of Lords reform in 1999, members of the royal family who were peers of the first creation were offered life peerages as a pure formality, which would have given them the right to sit in the House of Lords, but nobody seriously expected them to accept, and all declined with the exception of the Earl of Snowdon.[50] These included:\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n\nCharles, Prince of Wales (later Charles III)\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward, Earl of Wessex\n\nBaronetcy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Baronetcy\n\nCharles Babbage, scientist, declined both a knighthood and baronetcy.[51]\n\nHall Caine, novelist and playwright (1917); accepted knighthood in 1918.[52]\n\nJohn Grubb Richardson,[53] declined, citing his religious beliefs.\n\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson, poet (1865 and 1868); accepted peerage in 1884 on William Ewart Gladstone's urging.\n\nGeorge Peabody, poet (1864); Queen Victoria sent an adoring letter of thanks, enclosing a miniature portrait of herself and offering him a baronetcy or knighthood; Peabody declined both titles.[54]\n\nIn addition to these, many offers of baronetcies have technically been declined, since this is a hereditary honour and was one way, until recent times, for the Crown to raise money from landed gentry. When a baronetcy becomes vacant on the death of a holder, the heir may choose not to register the proofs of succession, effectively declining the honour. The baronetcy can be revived at any time on provision of acceptable proofs of succession, by, say, the son of a son who has declined to register the proofs of succession.[55] As of December 2017 some 208 baronetcies are listed as awaiting proofs of succession.[56]\n\nKnight Companion of the Order of the Garter\n\n[edit]\n\nNeville Chamberlain was offered the Order shortly before his death in 1940, but felt too sick to accept.[57]\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone was offered the Order upon leaving office at the end of his first premiership in February 1874 but declined both the Garter and a peerage.[58]\n\nWilliam Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne declined the Order around 1847 because he feared the expense of an investiture. His last years were plagued by largely imaginary money worries that surfaced after his stroke.[59]\n\nHarold Macmillan declined the Order in March 1964, as he felt it should only be conferred for service during a national crisis, privately remarking that acceptance would have given him \"the substance without the shadow.\"[57]\n\nCharles Vincent Massey had to refuse the Garter due to the Government of Canada's policy on peerages and knighthoods. He accepted the Royal Victorian Chain in 1960.\n\nKnight of the Order of the Thistle\n\n[edit]\n\nRamsay MacDonald declined the Order in 1935 as he felt accepting would go against his principles as a member of the Labour Party.[57]\n\nKnighthood (Knight Bachelor)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Knight Bachelor\n\nT.

Any recipient can also request that the honour not be used officially, e.g. Donald Tsang, ex-Chief Executive of Hong Kong, was knighted in 1997 but has not used the title since the handover to China.[180]\n\nThose who have returned insignia include:\n\nYasmin Alibhai-Brown, journalist (returned MBE insignia in 2003 in her view of \"a growing spirit of republicanism and partly in protest at the Labour government, particularly its conduct of the war in Iraq\").\n\nRoy Bailey, folk singer (returned MBE insignia in August 2006 in protest at the British Government's foreign policy in Lebanon and Palestine).\n\nAlan Cumming, actor, appointed OBE in 2009, returned the insignia in 2023 because of what he had come to see as \"the toxicity of empire\".[181]\n\nCarla Lane, television writer (appointed OBE in 1989; returned insignia in 2002 in protest at the appointment of CBE of the managing director of Huntingdon Life Sciences due to the company's reputed animal testing).\n\nJohn Lennon, musician (returned MBE insignia in 1969)\n\nGareth Peirce, solicitor[182] (gazetted CBE in 1999, but later she returned its insignia, blaming herself and apologizing to then Prime Minister Tony Blair for the misunderstanding).\n\nNarindar Saroop, soldier and Tory politician. Returned CBE in 2016 in disgust at the \"Dishonours List\" of David Cameron \"showering peerages, knighthoods and other rewards on friends and party backers\".\n\nMichael Sheen, Welsh actor (appointed OBE in the 2009 New Year Honours list for his services to drama[183]). In 2020 Sheen returned the award after researching the relationship between Wales and the British state, saying \"I'd be a hypocrite if I said the things I was going to say in the lecture about the nature of the relationship between Wales and the British state.\"[184]\n\nSusan Wighton, AIDS worker (returned MBE insignia in 2006 in protest at the British Government's Middle East foreign policies).\n\nIn June 1965, a number of holders of honours and decorations, mainly awarded for military service, returned their insignia in protest at the nomination of the four members of The Beatles for the MBE.[185] They included Hector Dupuis, a member of the House of Commons of Canada, Paul Pearson, a former RAF squadron leader, and James Berg, all of whom returned their MBEs; David Evan Rees, a former sea captain, who returned his OBE; and Richard Pape, a wartime escapee and author, who returned his Military Medal.[186][187][188][189]\n\nPaula Vennells, the former CEO of Post Office Limited, announced on 9 January 2024 that she would return the CBE awarded to her in the 2019 New Year Honours in light of the Post Office scandal in which many subpostmasters were wrongly accused - and some convicted - of criminal acts such as fraud and theft.[190] In her case, the honour was officially revoked by His Majesty The King.\n\nKnights who have \"renounced\" their knighthoods include:\n\nMaharajkumar of Vizianagram, cricketer (knighted in 1936; renounced knighthood in 1947 upon India's independence).\n\nRabindranath Tagore, author and poet and Nobel Prize Winner in Literature (knighted in 1915; renounced knighthood in 1919 in protest over the Jallianwala Bagh massacre).\n\nC. P. Ramaswami Iyer, lawyer, parliamentarian and administrator (knighted in 1926 with the KCIE and again in 1939 with the KCSI; renounced both knighthoods in 1948 following Indian independence).\n\nKhwaja Nazimuddin, nobleman, administrator and politician who served as the Governor-General of Pakistan from 1948 to 1951 and as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1951 to 1953 (knighted in 1934 with the KCIE; renounced knighthood in 1946 due to his personal belief in independence from Britain).\n\nReplacement honours proposed\n\n[edit]\n\nThose objecting the British Honours system have proposed alternative honours.\n\nWales\n\n[edit]\n\nThere have been calls to introduce a Welsh honours system such as a \"Medal Cymru\" which was backed by a petition but the Senedd's Assembly Commission has said that it was not an appropriate time to introduce \"Medal Cymru\" due to the \"current economic climate\" in 2009. One particular option that was considered following a public consultation, was to award one \"Medal Cymru\" per year from the Senedd. Tanni Grey-Thompson has said that this proposal would be a \"lovely idea\".[191] In 2013, the St David Awards was launched alongside the existing British honours system, awarding Welsh people for \"inspiring and exceptional work\".[192] In 2021, a petition was launched to the Senedd titled \"The inauguration of an Honorary National System of Awards; The Cymru Knighthood Award\", proposing a Welsh honours system. The Welsh Government said that it did not have plans to introduce a Welsh honours system to replace the British honours system.[193] But Plaid Cymru still nominate members of the House of Lords at Westminster.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAbdication of Edward VIII\n\nCanadian titles debate â€“ Ongoing debate since 1919 over whether or not Canadians can accept British honours.\n\nBlack v ChrÃ©tien â€“ 2001 legal case that affirmed the power of the Canadian prime minister to block such appointments."
