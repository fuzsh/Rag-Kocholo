        "text": "Murray is in a race to recover from surgery on a spinal cyst ahead of what is likely his final Wimbledon appearance\n\nMatt Verri28 June 2024\n\nAll eyes in the tennis world and beyond turn to SW19 for the next fortnight as Wimbledon takes centre stage.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Marketa Vondrousova arrive as defending champions, and in the Spaniard’s case as the most recent Grand Slam winner in the men’s game after his French Open victory.\n\nWorld number one Jannik Sinner is likely to prove the toughest obstacle in Alcaraz’s bid to go back-to-back, with seven-time Novak Djokovic having plenty of questions to answer as he races to recover from surgery on a torn meniscus in his right knee suffered at Roland Garros.\n\nIga Swiatek now has five Grand Slams to her name but is yet to translate her dominance to the grass courts. Aryna Sabalenka is therefore the pre-tournament favourite, with Elena Rybakina, Coco Gauff and Ons Jabeur all expected to have strong fortnights too.\n\nThere is, as ever, plenty of British interest at Wimbledon, as Jack Draper and Katie Boulter both compete as seeds after picking up titles earlier in the grass-court season. Emma Raducanu is also back at SW19 amid signs of a return to her best, while Andy Murray is pushing to overcome injury issues and take to the Wimbledon courts for likely the final time.\n\nJack Draper beat Carlos Alcaraz at Queen’s with a sensational display\n\nAction Images via Reuters\n\nWhen is Wimbledon 2024?\n\nWimbledon gets underway on Monday, July 1, with the tournament running through until Sunday, July 14.\n\nAs has been the case in recent years, there will be play on Middle Sunday, meaning there are 14 consecutive days of action at SW19.\n\nMatches on outside courts get underway at 11am BST, with play starting later in the day on Court One (1pm) and Centre Court (1.30pm).\n\nWhere to watch Wimbledon\n\nYou can watch Wimbledon across all 14 days on BBC One, BBC Two and their digital platforms. Click here for full information on that.\n\nLive blog: You can also follow the action throughout the fortnight via Standard Sport’s LIVE blogs!\n\nWhat time does Wimbledon start on TV on Monday and is there a live stream?\n\nRead More\n\nRaducanu 'very confident' for Wimbledon as first-round opponent revealed\n\nAndy Murray learns first Wimbledon opponent amid SW19 fitness battle\n\nDigital bank tops list of 100 fastest-growing British businesses\n\nSponsored\n\nMotability Operations is driving an EV transition that works for all\n\nCoverage will begin on BBC Two at 10.30am BST on the first day of the Championships, with BBC One showing the action from 12:15pm.\n\nAll matches from across SW19 will also be available to watch on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website will also provide coverage. Today at Wimbledon, presented again by Qasa Alom, will round up the best of the action each night at 9pm on BBC Two.\n\nWimbledon 2024 schedule\n\nWill Andy Murray play at Wimbledon?\n\nAndy Murray’s participation remains in doubt, after he had surgery on a spinal cyst last Saturday.\n\nThat has left him in a race against time to recover and feature at Wimbledon for what is expected to be the final time, with Murray still intending to retire later this summer.\n\nThe 37-year-old was in Friday’s draw and will face Tomas Machac on Tuesday if he is fit enough to take to the court. A late decision will be made, with the Briton insisting he would not feel “guilty” about withdrawing from the tournament at short notice.\n\n“I’m going to wait until the last minute and I’ve earned that right to do that,” Murray said.\n\n“I would say it’s probably more likely that I’m not able to play singles right now. I’m also f***ing doing rehab 24/7 to try to give myself that opportunity to play there again.”\n\nMurray has also been awarded a wildcard for the men’s doubles alongside his brother Jamie, which could provide an alternative stage for a Wimbledon swansong if he is not fit enough to play singles.\n\nMurray said: “I spoke to my brother about that a couple of days ago in terms of the doubles and everything to see if he wants to find someone else to play with, and I was obviously absolutely fine with that. But he also wants the opportunity to try to play. We’ll see how the next few days go.”\n\nAndy Murray is yet to make a decision on whether he is ready to compete\n\nZac Goodwin/PA Wire\n\nWimbledon 2024 seeds\n\nMen’s singles\n\nJannik Sinner\n\nNovak Djokovic\n\nCarlos Alcaraz\n\nAlexander Zverev\n\nDaniil Medvedev\n\nAndrey Rublev\n\nHubert Hurkacz\n\nCasper Ruud\n\nAlex de Minaur\n\nGrigor Dimitrov\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas\n\nTommy Paul\n\nTaylor Fritz\n\nBen Shelton\n\nHolger Rune\n\nUgo Humbert\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime\n\nSebastian Baez\n\nNicolas Jarry\n\nSebastian Korda\n\nKaren Khachanov\n\nAdrian Mannarino\n\nAlexander Bublik\n\nAlejandro Tabilo\n\nLorenzo Musetti\n\nFrancisco Cerundolo\n\nTallon Griekspoor\n\nJack Draper\n\nFrances Tiafoe\n\nTomas Martin Etcheverry\n\nMariano Navone\n\nZhang Zhizhen\n\nWomen’s singles\n\nIga Swiatek\n\nCoco Gauff\n\nAryna Sabalenka\n\nElena Rybakina\n\nJessica Pegula\n\nMarketa Vondrousova\n\nJasmine Paolini\n\nZheng Qinwen\n\nMaria Sakkari\n\nOns Jabeur\n\nDanielle Collins\n\nMadison Keys\n\nJelena Ostapenko\n\nDaria Kasatkina\n\nLiudmila Samsonova\n\nVictoria Azarenka\n\nAnna Kalinskaya\n\nMarta Kostyuk\n\nEmma Navarro\n\nBeatriz Haddad Maia\n\nElina Svitolina\n\nEkaterina Alexandrova\n\nCaroline Garcia\n\nMirra Andreeva\n\nAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova\n\nLinda Noskova\n\nKaterina Siniakova\n\nDayana Yastremska\n\nSorana Cirstea\n\nLeylah Fernandez\n\nBarbora Krejcikova\n\nKatie Boulter\n\nKatie Boulter defended her crown in Nottingham\n\nGetty Images for LTA\n\nWimbledon 2024 latest odds\n\nMen’s singles\n\nJannik Sinner 7/4\n\nCarlos Alcaraz 23/10\n\nNovak Djokovic 7/2\n\nAlexander Zverev 17/1\n\nWomen’s singles\n\nAryna Sabalenka 11/4\n\nIga Swiatek 7/2\n\nElena Rybakina 11/2\n\nCoco Gauff 6/1\n\nOns Jabeur 10/1\n\nOdds via Betfair, subject to change\n\nCreate a FREE account to continue reading\n\nRegistration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.\n\nJoin our community where you can: comment on stories; sign up to newsletters; enter competitions and access content on our app.\n\n* FIRST NAME\n\n* LAST NAME\n\n* EMAIL\n\nYour email address\n\n* PASSWORD\n\nMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number\n\n* YEAR OF BIRTH\n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to create an account\n\n* Required fields\n\nI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from Evening Standard.
