All competition streams live on NBCOlympics.com and Peacock â€” visit the schedule page for more details. We will continue to update this recap throughout the day.\n\nOn a day that featured 16 medal events, illustrious U.S. gymnasts Simone Biles and Suni Lee aimed to make history in Thursday's individual all-around final at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nHere's what you should know from Day 6 of competition.\n\nAfter winning team gold on Tuesday, Simone Biles and Suni Lee represented the U.S. in the individual all-around final on Thursday.\n\nTeam USA has dominated the event in recent years with the last five gold medalists being American (Carly Patterson, 2004; Nastia Liukin, 2008; Gabby Douglas, 2012; Biles, 2016; Lee, 2020). Entering the event, both Biles and Lee had the opportunity to etch their names into the history books again if either repeated as a gold medalist. Only two women have ever have won two individual all-around gold medals: Larisa Latynina (1956 and 1960) and Vera Caslavska (1964 and 1968). Furthermore, only twice in Olympic history have two American women finished on the podium in the all-around event at the same Games.\n\nIn the end it was Biles (59.131) edging out Brazil's Rebeca Andrade (57.932), who replicated her silver medal from the Tokyo Games, and Lee (56.465), who will take home the bronze.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe that I did it,\" Biles said. \"I know that I did it, but I don't think it's hit me just yet. It will probably hit me whenever I go back to the village.\"\n\nAt 27 years old, Biles is also the oldest female gymnast to achieve the feat in 72 years â€” Maria Gorokhovskaya won the title at age 30 during the 1952 Games.\n\n\"I'm just ecstatic with my performances tonight,\" Biles said. \"We still have three finals left for me. Now it's time to have fun and the hard part is over.\"\n\nBiles will compete in the vault, balance beam and floor exercise, while Lee is set for the uneven bars and balance beam for individual honors.\n\nResults: Women's All-Around Final\n\nðŸ¥‡ Simone Biles (USA)\n\nðŸ¥ˆRebeca Andrade (BRA)\n\nðŸ¥‰ Suni Lee (USA)\n\nThe U.S. team of Liam Corrigan, Michael Grady, Justin Best and Nick Mead won gold in men's rowing, the first gold in men's four since 1960. The finish also gives the U.S. its first medal in a rowing event since 2016 and is the second medal in the men's four in the 21st century (the U.S. won bronze in 2012).\n\nThis victory is the first Olympic medal for Corrigan, Grady, Best and Mead in their second Olympic appearance. Grady is the only returner from the men's four in Tokyo, while Corrigan, Mead and Best competed in the men's eight in Tokyo.\n\nThis was the United States' 13th medal and third-ever gold in this event.\n\nResults: Rowing Men's Four\n\nðŸ¥‡ United States\n\nðŸ¥ˆ New Zealand\n\nðŸ¥‰ Great Britain"
