        "text": "©Colette Lewis 2005—\n\nSomewhere over Arkansas—\n\nAs I head back home, thoroughly impressed with the Austin airport, I’m ready to close the book on my first NCAA Division 1 experience. Short version--The facility: first-class; the tournament: well-run; the officiating: top-drawer, the tennis: simply outstanding. If they could just arrange to air condition all of Texas somehow, I’d be back for dual matches in Aggieland in a Texas heartbeat.\n\nNow for the long version:\n\nMy timing was certainly good –arriving in Austin ahead of schedule last Tuesday (thanks Delta) and making the less-than-two hour drive to College Station in time to see the singles matches of the team finals was just how I’d planned it.\n\nBEARS VS. BRUINS\n\nBeing a novice at the NCAAs, I had no right to expect one of the best team finals ever, with UCLA coming back from 3-1 down to win their first NCAA title in 21 years.\n\nAnd, despite the loss, a shoutout to the legion of Baylor tennis fans. By making the 90-mile drive from Waco, their presence raised the intensity Tuesday evening to a level that rivaled the humidity. All credit to UCLA for not succumbing to the hometown atmosphere that Bear Nation created. But when the unthinkable happened, the Baylor faithful had the class to stand and applaud, a demonstration of sportsmanship the French fans could certainly learn from.\n\nAnd speaking of Baylor, Matt Knoll has built a monster of a program in the Republic of Football. Heck, Baylor even had a bunch of tailgating RVers all week in the Mitchell Tennis Center’s parking lot. Asked if the 2005-6 season would be a rebuilding one, now that Dorsch and Becker, the last two NCAA singles champions have graduated, Knoll firmly refused to allow that option. But he is looking for a few good recruits. Not necessarily from Germany.\n\nIT’S NOT JUST ADIDAS THAT HAS LOGO PROBLEMS\n\nThe logo controversy has visibly infiltrated college tennis too. John Isner and Antonio Ruiz played the doubles finals match with black tape on their chests to cover up a Nike logo deemed too large. Sam Warburg came to a media interview with a hole in his Stanford Cardinal Dri-Fit where he had snipped off the offending 1/4 inch of swoosh.\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE\n\nTV crews bookended the tournament, with ESPN 2 covering the team championships--a special challenge because the deciding match can never be predicted beforehand--and the Tennis Channel appeared for the Men’s individual final day. Now, I’ve been know to watch a poker show now and then, but believe me when I say live NCAA tennis is better. Unfortunately, both networks aired their productions on tape-delay.\n\nYOU GOTTA HAVE FRIENDS\n\nBut somebody DID cover the event live-- Ken Thomas, founder, proprietor and production crew of RadioTennis.com, who adds a sense of fun to any event. A former collegiate player at Wisconsin, Ken provides streaming internet play by play broadcasts, and can be found at college dual matches, professional venues, juniors championships; anywhere top level is tennis is played, Ken has mic, will travel. (Full disclosure—Ken has always welcomed me as a guest color commentator, and is so laid back that he allows me to come and go as I please during broadcasts). Here’s hoping that after two years, he gets the recognition and remuneration his dedication to tennis deserves.\n\nA special thanks to local Eagle reporter Robert Premeaux and Texas A & M 12th Man Magazine editor Dallas Shipp, both of whom will have me looking back on College Station with fondness. Whether it was a restaurant tip or a perceptive media room question or a quote assist, they were never too busy, despite their deadlines, to help a fledgling reporter. Thanks guys, and I’ll see you in 2009, when both the women’s and men’s championships will descend upon Aggieland.\n\nBE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR:\n\nI had seen Old Dominion’s Izak van der Merwe play at the ITA Individual Indoor in Ann Arbor last November, where he lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Ryler DeHeart. From that performance alone, I knew he was good. He’s better than that. Though unseeded due to some puzzling losses this spring, at College Station, he took out Sam Warburg, the country’s top ranked player and Benjamin Becker, the 2004 NCAA champion, and still wasn’t finished, upending UCLA’s talented Benjamin Kohlloeffel too before losing to Pierrik Ysern of France in the semis. Ysern slowed the pace and kept van der Merwe’s backhand under pressure, and because the six-foot four-inch South African’s big league serve wasn’t at its best in that match, he fell in straight sets. But as a young college graduate (21 in January), he has options many others do not, and he can try his hand at pro tennis with an ace in the hole. So to speak.\n\nDitto Jonathan Chu. If he needs my encouragement to take a break from the pressures of academic and athletic juggling and devote himself fully to professional tennis for the next two or three years, he definitely has it. It's scary to think how good he could be if he focuses his time and energy completely on tennis. And I'm confident that if he doesn't thrive at tennis's next level, he'll do just fine with that Harvard degree, thank you.\n\nTexas A & M has developed a very strong program under coach Tim Cass and prospects are bright for next season. With Jerry Makowski, the only seeded freshman in the individual event, and top junior Conor Pollock, (spotted in College Station during the tournament,) committing to the Aggies, Cass has talent to work with. And more than once I saw a shirtless Makowski hitting with teammates and drilling with associate coach Steve Moore despite the oppressive heat, even though Makowski’s season was technically over when he lost in the round of 16.\n\nTHANKS, I NEEDED THAT\n\nSpeaking of the heat—a Corps of Cadets salute for air-conditioned press facilities. I know it’s a lazy way to watch a match, but the box is so well positioned that the only thing you miss is the sound. And the live match scoring and jumbotron screen was a fabulous way keep up with early round matches on the grandstand courts.\n\nWith school out there was not much happening in College Station, but I’m happy I found time on Memorial Day to attend the one major tourist attraction—the George Bush Library and Museum, which is so close to the courts that it is visible from the press box. It’s too easy to take for granted the sacrifices and heroism of leaders, and I’m delighted to have been reminded that political views are secondary to common decency. George Bush, a well-known tennis player and fan, by the way, certainly exemplifies that.\n\nAUSTIN CITY LIMITS\n\nI’ve got to think recruiting for the University of Texas has gotten easier since Andy Roddick moved back to Austin. On Tuesday, Roger Gubser, who plays three singles for the Longhorns, headed from a hit at Austin Tennis Academy with Blake Davis, one of the country’s top 14-year olds, to a workout session with Andy Roddick.\n\nDoug Davis, Blake’s father and director of high performance at Austin Tennis Academy gave me a brief tour and history lesson at the beautiful new facility in the rolling oak-dotted hlls 15 miles west of Austin. Emerging from the ashes of the St. Stephens Academy, the facility, less than two years old, is at capacity with an expansion underway. A fitness center/locker room building is under construction, and two more courts will join the ten already there. To build a juniors-only program from the ground up is nobody’s idea of easy, but director Eric Schmidhauser is obviously up to the task. The setting and the energy there-- the kids of all ages and sizes in their ATA t-shirts drilling or playing or working one on one with coaches—had me dreaming of a similar (but alas indoor) facility in Kalamazoo.\n\nWAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR\n\nI'm very excited about attending the first men's and women's combined NCAA Division 1 championships next year at Stanford. From what I've heard Dick Gould is determined to make this groundbreaking--and daunting--endeavor seem effortless. I'm expecting the ambiance to differ from that of College Station, if only because Stanford students will still be on campus, but I doubt it will be any more fun.\n\n©Colette Lewis 2005--\n\nCollege Station TX--\n\nBenedikt Dorsch of Baylor and John Isner of Georgia both made the most of their encore visits to the finals Monday at the NCAA Men’s Division 1 tennis championships on the campus of Texas A & M University.\n\nThe top-seeded Dorsch overcame a stubborn Patrick Ysern of San Diego, 6-2, 7-6 (6), to emerge as champion two years after losing to Illinois’ Amer Delic in the finals.\n\nAnd Georgia’s John Isner, a doubles finalist last year with Bo Hodge, this year teamed with Antonio Ruiz to capture the 2005 title, posting a 7-6 (4), 7-5 triumph over Louisiana State’s Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski.\n\nFor Dorsch, still stung by Baylor’s surprising loss to UCLA in the team finals, the individual championship helped ease the pain.\n\n“We were all smashed that we lost that match,” said Dorsch, echoing the comments teammate and defending NCAA champion Benjamin Becker made after his singles loss in the round of 16.\n\n“When you are up 3-1 and lose three matches in the third….it’s tough, but it’s not like we played badly, we just got outplayed. And you’ve got to accept that.”\n\nIt looked as if Ysern, a junior from Paris, France, would have to accept a straight set loss, when Dorsch bolted to a 4-0 lead in the first set, and despite dropping his own serve once, took it 6-2.\n\n“I was making errors that I don’t usually do,” said Ysern, a five-foot nine-inch lefthander. “You’ve got to adapt when you miss shots you don’t usually miss.”\n\nHis crosscourt forehand and backhand slice, so reliable in previous matches, were anything but in the first set and Ysern readily admitted that nerves played a role.\n\n“At the beginning I was really nervous, and after the first set, you know you’ve got to do something different. I kind of went a little more for my shots. I knew it was there, I just had to try and find it.”\n\nWhen Dorsch went up a break in the second, and stepped to the baseline to serve out the match at 5-4, Ysern found whatever it was he was looking for. Dorsch never got to match point, and three unforced errors later it was 5-5, demonstrating that Ysern wasn’t alone in feeling the tension of the occasion.\n\nBut when Dorsch ran out to a 6-1 lead in the ensuing tiebreaker, things got really interesting.\n\nYsern saved the first match point with a volley winner, the second with a drop shot winner, the third with a forehand winner, the fourth with a backhand down the line. And with each match point saved, the crowd,--evenly divided between Baylor supporters an underdog partisans-- either roared or gasped, depending on their allegiance.\n\nBut all that was prelude. At 5-6, Ysern, pushed far beyond baseline by Dorsch’s pace, hit a sharply angled forehand crosscourt that Dorsch, at net and expecting to put away an easy volley, could only gape at in disbelief.\n\nYsern, falling as he hit the shot, stayed down to celebrate, getting up only to change ends for point number 13.\n\n“The most ridiculous shot in tennis I’ve ever seen, honestly, “ said Dorsch afterward.\n\n“I don’t even know what I was thinking,” said Ysern when asked how he felt after that winner. “I was on a different planet. But I like going for those shots. I’m trying to have fun out there.”\n\nThe good times, and the match, ended two points later, when Dorsch finally coaxed two errors from Ysern, taking the tiebreaker 8-6. But Dorsch knew he had dodged a bullet.\n\n“The guy made some unbelievable shots,“ said the five-foot ten-inch senior from Weiden Germany. “I was fortunate to get through it in two sets. He was down a break when I was serving for it, he was down 6-1, and there’s not a whole lot of guys who would keep playing. He tried everything and as hard as he could on every point.”\n\nFor Dorsch, whose strength and conditioning are givens, it was a relief to finish it in two sets.\n\n“When you play twelve points at that level, with that intensity and with that much at stake, it gets to the point where it gets very physical. It’s very warm outside and humid. I’ve played a lot of tennis in the last ten or eleven days. It’s good to be finishing on a high note.”\n\nDorsch, who ends his collegiate career with an eye-popping 119-15 won/loss record, joins fellow Baylor Bear Zuzana Zemenova in the NCAA singles champion’s circle. Zemenova, a freshman from Slovakia, captured the women’s title in Athens, GA on Saturday.\n\nThe singles finalists had never faced one another before, but the doubles teams vying for the 2005 NCAA title have spent plenty of time across the net from each other.\n\nWhen Georgia’s John Isner and Antonio Ruiz, the nation’s top ranked doubles team, faced Louisiana State’s Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski, it was the fourth time this season the SEC rivals had met, and the second time this month.\n\nUnfortunately for Growcott and Skupski, the first LSU pair ever to play in an NCAA final, Monday’s result was the same as the previous three—a win for the Bulldogs, this time by a 7-6 (4), 7-5 score.\n\nNeither team could produce a break in the first set, but Growcott and Skupski, came close, returning well enough to earn two set points on Isner’s serve at 4-5. But the six-foot nine-inch sophomore cracked four aces, three of them in succession, to get out of that tight spot, and the British duo did not get another chance in the tiebreaker, as Growcott dropped both his serves at 1-2.\n\nIn the seventh game of the second set, Growcott and Skupski earned the first break of match on Ruiz’s serve, but Skupski immediately gave it back. Ruiz again struggled in his next service game, but held, and at 5-6, Skupski once again was broken, sailing a forehand long, and giving the University of Georgia its third NCAA doubles title.\n\nAssessing the challenge of facing a player of Isner’s size, Skupski admitted that sometimes gambling is necessary.\n\n“You’ve got to guess with him sometimes, if he’s serving well,” said the sophomore from Liverpool. “And he served well on the big points. The difference in a 7-6, 7-5 match, it one or two points, here or there.”\n\nIsner, a sophomore, began the season breaking in a new partner, Antonio Ruiz, a transfer from Texas, was born in Monterrey Mexico. Undoubtedly it was a coveted position, as Isner had already demonstrated his doubles skills when he reached the 2004 finals with senior Bo Hodge.\n\n“I was very disappointed last year,” said Isner, a native of Greensboro North Carolina. “My partner and I really didn’t play our best tennis, but we still almost came up with the win. To win it this year, makes me feel a lot better.”\n\nAnd though Skupski and Growcott, the nation's sixth ranked team, were once again on the losing side of the ledger, there was only a tinge of frustration in Skupski’s voice when he said, “These guys are good. They deserved to win today.”\n\nIsner, who won the USTA National Junior doubles title with Pramod Dabir in 2003, was magnanimous in victory.\n\n“We’ve gotten to know these guys pretty well through out the year, and they are better guys off the court than on the court,” said Isner. “We couldn’t ask for a better team to play against in the finals.”\n\n©Colette Lewis 2005\n\n--College Station TX--\n\nAs he sat in the media room, sweat dripping from his no-longer-banded forehead, Jonathan Chu of Harvard assessed his future after losing 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 to top seed Benedikt Dorsch of Baylor in the semifinals at the NCAA division 1 men’s championships in College Station Texas.\n\n“I’m starting to believe a little more in myself,” said the unseeded New Yorker, who graduates in less than two weeks. “Others have always believed in me, but I’m starting to listen now. I hope I’ll get a few chances after this tournament to really try to do something on the next level.”\n\nIn facing Dorsch, a senior who reached the NCAA finals as a sophomore, Chu had a yardstick to measure the state of his game. And after the third point, when Chu had run down an overhead and parried two more apparent winners, Dorsch smiled to himself and nodded to the crowd, as if to say, yes, Chu is a worthy opponent.\n\nAnd not just for a game or two.\n\nWhen Chu broke Dorsch in the fifth and ninth games, the second break giving the Ivy Leaguer the first set, Dorsch knew he was facing an uphill climb if he was to reach his second NCAA final.\n\n“He gets a short ball and really takes advantage of it. Most of the college guys don’t do that,” said Dorsch, who admitted that he struggled in the first set with both his game and some line calls.\n\n“I have to apologize to the umpires and referees today, because I had to scream a little at them to get me going. That was the only chance I had without getting a point penalty to get rid of some frustrations.”\n\nMany of which where caused by Chu’s serve, which Dorsch jokingly referred to as “220 miles per hour”. And until the seventh game of the second set, Chu protected it, frequently putting Dorsch on the defensive. It is not a position the powerfully built 24-year-old from Germany is accustomed to, as he came into the tournament with a 29-2 record and had not dropped a set while advancing to the semifinals.\n\n“I got a little more confident in the second set, hitting the ball and exposing his forehand at little more,” said Dorsch, “and that got me the edge.”\n\nOne break in the second set pulled him even in the match, but Dorsch squandered an early break in the third set, finding himself at 4-4. A break in the very next game however, gave him back the advantage, as a tiring Chu began to shorten the points to avoid prolonged rallies in the smothering humidity.\n\nDorsch, who earlier had mentioned his disappointment at losing the team championships on Tuesday to UCLA, is hoping that an individual title can help ease that pain. Chu will look back on the 2005 tournament a bit differently.\n\n“If you had asked me a week ago, a month ago, a year ago, whether or not I could ever dream of this, I probably would have said no, but I’ll give it a shot,” he said.\n\n“This has been an incredible tournament for me.”\n\nAs it was for the other unseeded semifinalist, Izak van de Merwe of Old Dominion, who was beaten by University of San Diego’s Pierrik Ysern 6-4, 6-4. Ysern, a junior from Paris, had lost to van de Merwe in their only previous meeting, but was eager for a rematch.\n\n“I was up a set and a break and I put pressure on myself, and couldn’t play anymore,” said the lefthander of that first loss. “Today, I worked on staying focused and not letting anything go. If I kept focus, I knew I could beat him.”\n\nYsern, an alphabetical seed in the tournament, upset fourth seed Catalin Gard of Ole Miss in the quarterfinals and seventh seeded Ryler DeHeart in the round of 16.\n\nAgainst van de Merwe, Ysern used his slices and speed to neutralize the power of the much larger South African.\n\n“The first break was important, as I knew he had a big serve and I was wondering if I could break him,” Ysern said. “But the real turning point was when I broke him early in the second set.”\n\n“I could have served better,” said van der Merwe, who eliminated the nation’s top ranked player, Sam Warburg of Stanford, in the first round, and Benjamin Becker, the defending NCAA champion, in the round of 16. “My serve let me down a little bit today.”\n\nBut he was quick to credit Ysern.\n\n“He played really well,” said van der Merwe. “He didn’t make a lot of unforced errors and was very, very solid from the baseline. He puts you in the corners and today his forehand was very solid.”\n\nYsern and Dorsch have never played, but Ysern pronounced the prospect “fun” and Dorsch predicted it would be “interesting.”\n\nIn doubles action, defending NCAA champions K.C. Corkery and Sam Warburg of Stanford saw their dream of back-to-back titles evaporate when they were overpowered by Louisana State’s Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski 7-6 (1), 6-4.\n\n“We served really well and we returned well,” said Skupski. “We volleyed well. We really didn’t do anything wrong.”\n\n“We both have big serves,” said Skupski, who, like Growcott, is a native of Great Britain. “It’s pretty tough to break us.”\n\nCorkery and Warburg, the second seeded team in the tournament, were not able to break the LSU pair, who are alphabetical seeds.\n\nThe loss was a difficult one for the Cardinal.\n\n“We had expectations of defending our title, and anything less than that is going to be disappointing,” said Warburg, a senior.\n\n“But I wouldn’t necessarily say we lost today. I’d say they beat us.”\n\nGrowcott and Skupski had the luxury of scouting their opponents, as their first straight set win of the tournament had them finished in time to watch the other semifinal.\n\nRest requirements for Harvard’s Chu, the only player in both singles and doubles, pushed back the start time, but as it turned out, Growcott and Skupski didn't need to gather information, as their opponents in the finals are the SEC pair of John Isner and Antonio Ruiz of Georgia, who defeated Chu and partner Ashwin Kumar 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4.\n\nWith an 0-3 record against the top-seeded team, the most recent loss in team play last week, Growcott and Skupski will need to find a way to derail the towering Bulldogs.\n\nIsner, at six-feet nine-inches and Ruiz, at six-feet four-inches, are an imposing pair, and though only a sophomore, Isner is now in his second NCAA doubles final, having teamed with Bo Hodge last year.\n\n“When you play against guys, where their average height is like, what? seven feet,” said Chu wryly, “you know you aren’t going to get a lot of chances to break.”\n\nThe only break that the scrappy Harvard pair managed was against Ruiz when he was serving for the match at 5-2. But Isner, who served exceptionally well all afternoon, stepped up at 5-4 and hammered one serve after another, with match point, appropriately enough, won via an ace.\n\nChu, who played more than four hours of tennis in the sultry afternoon and evening, began to show signs of fatigue, but buoyed by the energy of rested partner Kumar, the Crimson managed to eke out the first set. But unable to counter the sheer power of the Isner serve, they could find no way to duplicate that first set.\n\nAs for facing Growcott and Skupski again, Isner and Ruiz are ready.\n\n“We expect to have a war out there,“ Isner said. “They’re two big servers. And it looks good for our conference with two SEC teams in the finals.”\n\n©Colette Lewis 2005--\n\nCollege Station TX--\n\nUnseeded seniors Jonathan Chu of Harvard and Izak van der Merwe of Old Dominion overcame more highly regarded opponents Saturday to advance to the semifinals of the NCAA Men’s Championships. Chu dropped third seed Jesse Witten of Kentucky, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (6), while van der Merwe prevailed over UCLA’s Benjamin Kohlloeffel 6-3, 5-7, 6-3.\n\nBut it wasn’t easy.\n\nChu, who had not lost a set in his first three matches, was down 4-0 before he knew it.\n\n“Jesse came out and was hitting a heavy ball,\" said the righthander from New York City. \"I wasn’t adjusted to the intensity of it. I’m glad it wasn’t too late before I got adjusted.”\n\nWhatever groove Chu found, it was a productive one, as he ran off seven straight games before Witten was able to stem the tide. Forehand blazing, Witten damped Chu’s momentum, taking the second set and getting an early break in the third. But an incredible overhead retrieval by Chu in the eighth game caught Witten’s blue shoes flat-footed and he failed to put away an easy floater at the net, allowing Chu to level the match.\n\n“I never really lost faith.\" said Chu, the only player still in both singles and doubles. “I thought I could do it, given the opportunity.”\n\nIn the tiebreaker, Chu continued to return well, attacking Witten’s second serve whenever possible. At 5-6, Chu thought he had won when a Witten passing shot was signaled out by the line judge a beat or two late, perhaps influenced by Chu's premature celebration. But the chair umpire overruled the line judge and after a brief moment of confusion, the drama continued.\n\n“I called it out because I’ve been used to calling my own matches the entire year,“ said Chu, the Ivy League Player of the Year, who is ranked 32nd nationally. “You never know how many chances you’ll have to close out a match against a top player like Jesse.”\n\nBut after a few words of encouragement from his coach Dave Fish, Chu calmly stroked an ace to go up 7-6, and converted his second match point when Witten netted a volley.\n\nIn the media room after the match, Chu, who graduates next month, mentioned the difficulty that Harvard student-athletes face when competing in the spring NCAA championships.\n\n“I’ve never taken a final exam in spring semester at Harvard,” said Chu, who lost in the first round all three of his previous appearances. “I’ve always taken it at this tournament. I handed in my final paper last night at midnight. I needed it to graduate.”\n\nHis opponent on Sunday is top seed Benedikt Dorsch of Baylor, who continued his domination with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over unseeded freshman Greg Ouellette of Florida.\n\nDorsch was trying out a new racquet for this tournament, but after two double faults and a forehand that sailed long in a dropped service game in the first set, he returned to his old model and experienced no other difficulties.\n\nVan der Merwe continued his strong play, eliminating UCLA’s Benjamin Kohlloeffel, an alphabetical seed, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. For the second match in a row, van der Merwe served for the match in the second set and failed to convert, but seemed unfazed.\n\n“I played a decent game. I actually had a match point,” said the 6-foot 4-inch senior from South Africa, who put in seven straight first serves in the lengthy tenth game, and still was unable to put away the crafty lefthander from Germany.\n\n“He played a very good game there. He hit a great return on match point to my backhand, which I couldn’t pick up.”\n\nBut van der Merwe did visibly raise his game to open the third set, hitting winner upon winner from both sides, and quickly ran out to a 2-0 lead, a break he never gave back. He avoided having to serve out the match a second time when he broke Kohlloeffel at 3-5, earning his place in the semifinals against San Diego’s Pierrik Ysern. Ysern, a junior from France, staved off several set points at 5-6 against fourth seed Catalin Gard of Ole Miss, winning the first set in a tiebreaker and the second set going away, 6-0.\n\nThe doubles competition went more predictably, as the top two seeds advanced in straight sets. Georgia’s John Isner and Antonio Ruiz cruised past Marko Rejavac and David North, the surprise quarterfinalists from Georgia Tech, 6-3, 6-2. Stanford’s K.C. Corkery and Sam Warburg, the second seeds and defending NCAA champions, moved into the semifinals with their 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory over PAC 10 rivals Roger Matalonga and Colin O’Grady of Arizona.\n\nTheir opponents in the semifinals will be alphabetically seeded Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski of Louisiana State, who were 6-3, 6-7(2), 6-4 winners over Brown’s Phil Charm and Adil Shamasdin.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Chu will again play two matches, as he and partner Ashwin Kumar came from behind to dump Auburn’s Alex Schweizer and Gabor Zoltan in a battle of unseeded teams, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.\n\n©Colette Lewis 2005--\n\n--College Station TX--\n\nOld Dominion's Izak van der Merwe chalked up yet another big win Friday, as he used a powerful serve and baseline winners to eliminate 2004 NCAA singles champion Benjamin Becker of Baylor 6-4, 7-6(3) in the round of 16.\n\nVan der Merwe, who upset top ranked Stanford senior Sam Warburg in Wednesday's opening round, traded inside-out forehands with the alphabetically seeded Becker, and gave away nothing in the fitness department. In the heat of the day, when trainers often outnumbered players on changeovers and coaches served as umbrella caddies, van der Merwe displayed no signs of fatigue.\n\n\"I never really cramp,\" said the 21 year-old South African. \"I'm still waiting for that one. When it didn't happen on Wednesday (in his three set marathon with Warburg), it may not.\"\n\nServing for the match after breaking Becker in the ninth game, van der Merwe was unable to slam the door, giving Baylor's number two singles player a glimmer of hope.\n\n\"I played kind of a sloppy game there,\" said the 37th ranked van der Merwe, \"but I played well in the tiebreaker.\"\n\nThe recently graduated van der Merwe took an early lead in the tiebreaker and when Becker's return sailed long on match point, the tournament was assured of a new champion.\n\n\"It definitely feels good to beat the defending champion,\" he said. \"He's a good player, a very good player.\"\n\nBecker, who lost his singles match in the finals of the team competition on Tuesday, when Baylor's 57 match winning streak was snapped by UCLA, still had that ending on his mind.\n\n\"Getting motivated for this individual competition was really tough,\" said the native of Orschotz Germany. \"The loss is still in our heads. We're still sitting in our room and talking about it at night. Our only focus was the team championship.\"\n\nHis teammate Benedikt Dorsch, the tournament's top seed, has yet to see his collegiate career end, as he rolled over Illinois freshman Kevin Anderson 6-2, 6-1.\n\nOf the five freshmen who advanced to the round of 16, only one made in through, with Florida's Greg Ouellette taking out another seed, last year's semifinalist Franticek Babej of South Alabama 6-4, 2-6, 7-5.\n\nIn the most dramatic conclusion of a match on Friday, Babej was visited by trainers often during the changeovers and lost the last three games of the match, as well as his composure. Ouellette called Babej's shot long on match point, and though the umpire agreed, Babej did not, making an obscene gesture in Ouellette's direction and needing to be restrained by his coach in the moments following. The traditional handshake never was offered and several minutes later Babej was still distraught.\n\nOuellette takes on Dorsch on Saturday, while third seed Jesse Witten of Kentucky meets unseeded Jonathan Chu of Harvard in the top half's other match.\n\nIn the bottom half, fourth seed Catalin Gard of Ole Miss faces Pierrik Ysern of San Diego, and UCLA's Ben Kohlloeffel will try to stop van der Merwe.\n\nThe major doubles upset saw third seeds Dorsch and Matija Zgaga of Baylor go out to Auburn's Alex Schweizer and Gabor Zoltan 6-1, 6-2. But the doubles match and story of the day was Georgia Tech's team of David North and Marko Rajevac, who were fifth alternates when the tournament draw was made and now find themselves in the quarterfinals after a hard-fought 2-6, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (5)victory over Tulane's Dmitriy Koch and Alberto Sottocorno.\n\n\"We were second alternates by the time we flew out here,\" said Georgia Tech coach Kenny Thorne. \"I told the guys we might as get you out there, and see what happens.\"\n\nNorth and Rajevac will face the top-seeded Georgia team of John Isner and Antonio Ruiz on Saturday.\n\n2theadvocate.com: News - Visa status sidelines BR sisters 05/08/05--\n\nNot the feel-good Mother's Day story I was hoping to come across, but certainly an interesting one. I don't think the family has any hope of winning this lawsuit, because there isn't a civil right to compete in a USTA tournament. The NBA wouldn't be contemplating instituting an age limit like the NFL's if they didn't feel the legal ground for establishing who can compete in their league was firmly tilted toward the organizing body.\n\nAll that said, I think American tennis would benefit from a change in this rule. The USTA argument, as presented here by Chris Widmaier, is like protectionists everywhere, and whether it's trade or tennis, I don't buy it. They say we need to protect our steel industry or our automobile industry, or whatever it is, from those \"foreigners\", because those countries have their own tariffs and quotas and blah, blah, blah. When the Big Three here in Michigan were afforded this protection, we got poorly designed and engineered gas guzzlers with little innovation or reliability. The competition from the Japanese automakers was unquestionably good for the consumer. In sports--the ultimate marketplace based on merit--more competition equals a better game. And, returning for a moment to the NBA, how do you think a ban or quota on foreign players in that league would go over now?\n\nTennis is more global than basketball, and yet, if you are not 18, your nationality matters in tennis. Yes, the two spots these Dutch girls earn will deprive two American girls who might otherwise not qualify. A draw is a very zero sum game. The same can be said of college athletic scholarships. What U.S. citizen is not going to Baylor this year, because the Bears have recruited three Germans for their tennis team? But the college game is better for having an international component, and junior tennis would ultimately benefit too.\n\nWill this happen? No. And I have a reason for being so emphatic. A few selected foreign players were once invited to compete annually in the Nationals here in Kalamazoo, which is how Rod Laver (1956) and Raul Ramirez (1971) came to grace our list of champions. But when Ramesh Krishnan won the 16s title in 1977, a rule was passed limiting the competitors to U.S. citizens, and, to my mind, the tournament instantly lost the prestige that had put it on par with the Grand Slams and the Orange Bowl--tournaments that are open to anyone who qualifies, regardless of nationality.\n\nThe Dutch girls can play ITF events if they qualify (and are age 13),(and I doubt Chris Widmaier referred to the International Tennis Association; perhaps the reporter misheard the first two syllables of Federation), and high school tennis, at least in Louisiana. Hard to view them as victims, really. But the sport is the ultimate loser when nationality becomes criteria, and you need look no further than the wild cards awarded at Grand Slams to see that."
