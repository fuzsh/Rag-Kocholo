        "text": "The French Open is just days away and Iga Swiatek will head into the women’s draw as an overwhelming favourite after a stunning clay court season.\n\nBack-to-back WTA 1000 triumphs in Madrid and Rome have cemented the Pole as the woman to beat at Roland Garros, where she is a two-time defending champion searching for a fourth title overall.\n\nSwiatek is comfortably world No 1 and will be the top seed, though there have been some interesting moves in terms of the seedings this clay season.\n\nTop four remains unchanged\n\nThough Swiatek was already ahead at the top, world No 2 Aryna Sabalenka was at risk of being overtaken by Coco Gauff and Elena Rybakina in the WTA Rankings.\n\nBut a strong clay court season has helped the Australian Open winner remain second in the world, with finals in Madrid and Rome providing a timely boost after a post-Melbourne slump.\n\nRybakina could have potentially overtaken Gauff as world No 3, though her withdrawal from Rome – where she was defending champion – means the American remains third, and the Kazakh fourth.\n\nWTA Rankings Winners and Losers Rome: Aryna Sabalenka stays at No 2, Danielle Collins +3, Naomi Osaka +120\n\nPegula Out\n\nJessica Pegula has now confirmed she will not be playing at the event.\n\nThe world No 5 has not played in Europe this clay season and looked a doubt for the second major of 2024, and confirmed on Thursday she was making the “super safe” decision not to play.\n\nHe withdrawal means that Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova is seeded fifth, Maria Sakkari sixth, and Australian Open runner-up Zheng Qinwen seventh.\n\nOns Jabeur will now be eighth seed, following Pegula’s withdrawal.\n\nRead More: How Jessica Pegula’s French Open withdrawal impacts women’s seedings at Roland Garros\n\nCollins surge boosts seeding\n\nA stunning run of form in recent months has sent Danielle Collins flying back up the rankings, and the US No 2 will be the 11th seed at Roland Garros.\n\nThat means she cannot face an opponent ranked higher than her until at least the fourth round, potentially opening the door for a deep run.\n\nFellow American Madison Keys will also have a better seeding after her recent form on the dirt, with the former French Open semi-finalist set to be the 14th seed as it stands.\n\nFrench No 1 Caroline Garcia has held on to be the 22nd seed and will avoid playing the likes of Swiatek or Sabalenka in the third round – with former champion Barbora Krejcikova the 24th seed.\n\nTop 32 seeds as it stands (as of w/c May 23rd 2024)"
