This pronouncement by Dr. Miller was preceded after the close of business on Thursday. There has been no increase in the rates of the Bank of England by an even more emphatic and perhaps more widely or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. During heralded statement by Colonel Leonard P. Ayers, of the week up to Wednesday night the stock market the Cleveland Trust Co., who, in an annual printed was weak, or hesitant, awaiting the action of the forecast issued by his bank, pointed out that alNew York bank. On Thursday and Friday it showed though the business situation in the country was recovery, but displayed weakness again at the final never better and is still improving, there were four close on Friday, when Radio Corporation stock points of danger which indicated the near approach dropped to the lowest figure of the year. of the culmination of the present bull market in The week has been an interesting one in the secu- stocks.

He foresees the contraction of these credit facilities because many of the new financing companies are manned by promoters who are not practical bankers and because money rates are likely to be higher. (4) The security markets themselves. After pointing out that there has been an over-speculation in stocks, he stated that previous bull markets had been brought to an end through three kinds of causes; namely (a) rising interest rates, (b) doubt as to business prospects, and (c) the driving of stocks by speculation to levels higher than their values. He believes that this market is coming to an end through the third cause. Colonel Ayers was also very definite in regard to the signal which would announce the end of the current market; namely, the next raising of the New York discount rate.. This prediction, coming after the traders of the country had been trained to expect dire calamity with the raising of this rate, and when for several weeks the market had been on the qui-vive each Thursday as to whether the rate would be raised or not, and backed up as he has been by several similar warnings from eminent bankers, has been widely proclaimed throughout the country, and has evidently had a very material effect. It is never well, however, to be dogmatic in conclusions of this kind. The warnings are certainly timely, but trade at large remains sound, and if the warnings are heeded the evils feared may yet be averted. The future depends upon the extent to which the warnings meet with proper and adequate response. Merchandise imports into the United States in October for the fourth consecutive month show a considerable expansion and are larger than in any October during the preceding five years. Exports also show some increase for each of the four months beginning with June, but, as in September, October merchandise exports are substantially lower than they were in the corresponding months of 1924. The movement of cotton to foreign ports from the United States in October this year was exceptionally heavy, and if allowance is made for the value of this movement, the foreign trade of the United States for October this year on the export side, does not make quite as satisfactory a showing as in some of the preceding months, although in part this is due to the very much smaller wheat exports last month than in October 1924. Merchandise imports in October were valued at $375,000,000, and compare with $350005,000 for September and $310,751,608 for October 1924. With the exception of March, they exceed any preceding month this year, and omitting only two months, are in excess of every other month back to August 1920. Merchandise exports last month were valued at $492,000,000, these figures contrasting with $420,319,000 for September, but with $527,171,781 for Oetober 1924. There have been only two months (October and November 1924), since January 1921, in which the value of merchandise exports has exceeded that of October this year. The excess of merchandise exports over imports last month was $117,000,000, while for October 1924 it was $216,420,173. Cotton exports in October this year were 1,421,482 bales, in contrast with 752,324 bales in September and 946,506 bales in October 1924, the value for October -this year, as set forth in the [voL 121. Government report being $176,183,900, in contrast with $97,439,995 for September and $123,303,475 for October 1924. Omitting cotton, other exports in October this year were valued at $316,000,000 in contrast with $322,880,000 for September and $403,838,000 in October 1924. To a considerable degree the decline this year of nearly 22% in these figures, as compared with a year ago, is attributable to a very much smaller movement of wheat in October 1925 than in the corresponding month of 1924, a total of approximately 5,400,000 bushels of wheat exported last month, as indicated by the statement of weekly exports in October, valued at perhaps $8,000,000, contrasting with exports of 45,112,358 bushels in October 1924, valued at $68,276,503. Cotton exports for this year to date exceed those for the ten months of 1924 by more than 43%, while values increased in amount of not quite 25%. The heavy increase in cotton exports and the marked decline in shipments of wheat to foreign ports, covering a period of two years, are perhaps unusual. Yet a loss in other exports, particularly at this time seems surprising, especially in view of the fact that for the nine months to Sept. 30 this year, exports other than cotton show a considerable increase, a part of which, covering the period back of the new grain season of 1925-26 is due to larger wheat exports. For ten months of the present calendar year merchandise imports are valued at$3,454,656,039 and exports $3,995,167,727, an excess of exports of $540,511,688; these figures contrast with $2,980,622,522, the latter the imports of merchandise for the first ten months of 1924, and $3,651,662,531, the exports for the same time, an excess of exports of $671,040,009. The increase in imports for the ten months this year over last is $474,033,517 and in exports $343,505,196. Both exports and imports of gold last month took quite a jump, exports being $28,039,190, the highest since February last, and contrasting with only $6,784,201 in September, and imports, $50,740,649, the highest since November 1921, and contrasting with only $4,097,771 in the preceding month. For ten months of this year gold exports amount to $232,311,992 and imports to $110,601,053, the excess of exports being $121,710,939; during the corresponding period in 1924, gold exports were $15,284,478 and imports $289,584,485, the excess of imports being $274,300,007. Not since 1919 until this year have gold exports exceeded imports. Silver exports last month were $8,783,376 and imports $5,601,851. The policy of the United States Government of not cancelling European war debts, but of requiring their payment on terms commensurate with the capacity of the respective debtor Powers, appears to be meeting with general favor in the United States. To be sure, there have been some enthusiastic champions of cancellation, but there is every reason to believe that they constitute only a small minority among our citizens. Because of her unsettled financial situation and a natural desire to pay as little as possible, it was not surprising that the very easy terms granted the Italian Government should have caused France to look for, and perhaps expect, a more favorable plan of settlement than the tentative one for five years that was reached in Washington some weeks since, but which was not accepted by the French Government. In some Paris cable dispatches it has been claimed that the French were even hoping that their war debt to the United States would be Nov.211925.1 THE CHRONICLE 2443 learned in official circles here to-day. If he remains in office, Premier Painleve is expected to give first consideration to the British debt, and to that end will go to London next month, and only,following a thorough 'preparation' via diplomatic channels will Senator Henry Berenger go to Washington, with the assurance of satisfactory prospects being held out for a Franco-American arrangement.\" He added that \"it now appears that M. Berenger will not arrive in the American. capital as a special envoy or ambassador, but in the capacity of representative of the French Treasury.\" The Italian war debt agreement was signed in Washington last Saturday. In his account of the event, the Washington correspondent of the New York \"Times\" said: \"The Italian-American debt settlement agreement was signed at 11 o'clock this morning by Finance Minister Volpi of Italy and Secretary Mellon for the United States, and then Count Volpi sprung a surprise by turning over to the Treasury Department a check for $5,000,000 in payment of the first installment in liquidation of the war-time debt, although this payment is not due President Coolidge was represented in Washing- until June 15 1926.\" He declared that \"the Ameriton dispatches as believing that the terms granted to can officials found themselves in the unusual and Italy were fair, both to that country and to the unexpected position of seeking a satisfactory excuse United States. The Washington correspondent of to refuse payment of money by one of the debtor nathe New York \"Herald Tribune\" stated this in a dis- tions, but finally agreed to the transaction, after patch to his paper on Nov. 13. He said that \"Presi- Count Volpi explained that Italy was anxious to dent Coolidge thinks that the $2,400,000,000 debt make the payment seven months in advance in order settlement reached yesterday with the Government to add finality to the accomplishment of the Debt of Italy is a fair one, not only for Italy, but also for Funding Commissions and as an 'earnest' of his the United States. Admitting that the terms to Italy country's determination to make good on the conwere lenient in comparison with terms accorded some tract.\" It was made known, likewise, that \"Count other European debtors, the President holds that the Volpi also read to Secretary Mellon a message which leniency in interest charges and in the matter of he had received from Premier Mussolini, expressing small payments for the immediately ensuing years his gratitude to the American Debt Commissioners was justified by Italy's depleted resources and her for their fairness in recognizing the necessity for consequent low capacity as compared with other extreme leniency in the settlement of Italy's debt, European debtors.\" He added that \"in making and Secretary Mellon asked the Italian Finance Minknown the President's gratification over the agree- ister to send a congratulatory message to Signor ment on what may be regarded as a fair basis for Mussolini in reply.\" both Governments, the White House spokesman toIn an interview later the Italian Finance Minister day said the President sought to emphasize Italy's made it known that the advance payment of $5,000,position by recalling that the war debt which Italy 000 is \"effective only when the agreement is ratified owes the United States and the debt which Italy by the legislative bodies of both Governments.\" Apowes to Great Britain almost equal the huge amount parently in explanation of this condition he was of Great Britain's war debt to the United States, quoted as saying that \"Italy does not want to exert which at the time of the British funding agreement any pressure, but does want it realized that the neaggregated more than four and half billion dollars.\" gotiations have come to an end.\" As to loans that Continuing he said: \"Considering this vast obliga- might be sought in the United States by Italians, it tion and also the great difference in the resources was reported by the New York \"Times\" correspondof the British Empire and Italy, the President thinks ent in Washington that \"he emphasized the fact that it will be apparent to the world that Italy could the Italian Government intended to supervise all renot meet the obligations upon terms which adhered quests made for loans by Italian industries; that strictly to those of the British funding agreement. none would be asked for except for the development That, in the President's opinion, is the most signifi- )f new productions, and then only ill limited amounts cant comparison that could be made.

The Italian expected for some weeks, the 'Herald Tribune' Government was not interested in loans which might \"forgiven.\" There is no reason why it should be. It would not be a wise policy for France to ask.for it or the United States to grant it. That easier terms will be sought is taken for granted. This was clearly indicated in a special Paris cable dispatch to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 13. The correspondent said that \"the French appear to take it for granted that the favorable debt terms accorded Italy will mean easier terms for them in the coming negotiations than were offered to the Caillaux mission by Washington. The attitude of French capital seems to be summed up by the 'Temps' to-night, which says: 'France has a right to hope that her American friends, taking account of her present capacity for payments, will not treat her with less generosity.' Some editorial writers think that the easy terms given Italy represent a change of attitude on the part of Americans; others see the effect of the large Italian vote in the United States, which has no French counterpart; but all agree that the Italian settlement means that France will look for similar,terms.\" 2444 THE CHRONICLE be sought by Italian private interests except to see that no loans were obtained which could not be met in full. Any loans sought, he added, would be for the development of new production, and there would be no requests for large amounts because the capacity of Italy to transfer funds out of that country was limited and because the Italian Government was determined that any promises to pay would be kept. The Italian Government, like the American Government, Count Volpi stated, regulated foreign loans, although the use of the money obtained was, of course, left in the hands of the private industries.\" Count Volpi and his associates were entertained at luncheon at the Recess Club in this city on Wednesday by Thomas W.Lamont, of J. P. Morgan & Co. Official announcement was made yesterday of the offering in this country of a $100,000,000 loan to the Italian Government by a powerful banking syndicate beaded by J. P. Morgan & Co. The loan is in the form of sinking fund gold bonds bearing 7% interest and maturing Dec. 1 1951. Subscription books were closed at noon, the loan having been oversubscribed. It was stated that, \"with the proceeds of the loan the Italian Government will take up the $50,000,000 banking credit obtained from J.P. Morgan & Co.last June to create a gold reserve available for currency stabilization purposes, leading to the final steps in a financial policy of which a definitely stabilized currency is a vital part. Bankers said that the Italian Government's budget is balanced, actual revenues in the fiscal year ended last June having resulted in a surplus of 209,006,000 lire. Receipts for the first three months of the current fiscal year, according to provisional returns, show an excess of about 168,000,000 lire over expenditures.\" Already a novel way of raising a part of the money the Italian Commission has agreed to pay the United States on account of its war debt to this country has been suggested. In a special wireless dispatch from Rome to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 16 it was stated that \"a proposal to cover the first five yearly war debt payments to America by voluntary subscriptions has been made by the Coal Exchange in Genoa, which has issued an appeal to all patriotic well-to-do Italians to contribute $1 yearly for this purpose. It is hoped in this way to induce 5,000,000 citizens to bind themselves to pay to the Italian Treasury for five years the sum necessary to cover the yearly payments. The sum which each person would contribute is quite small, working out at about two lire monthly, or the average price of two cigarettes, but many doubt whether 5,000,000 citizens can be found voluntarily to contribute even such a small amount in a country like Italy, where the peasants constitute about half of the population. The appeal therefore is specially addressed to large manufacturing concerns, which are asked on the one hand to carry on propaganda among their workmen and on the other to contribute a yearly sum equal to the amount raised by the workers. The first announcement of the appeal by the Genoa Coal Exchange has been everywhere received with enthusiasm, which augurs well for the success of the scheme.\" According to an Associated Press cable message from the Italian capital two days later, \"the Government gave official recognition to the movement to raise by popular subscriptions of $1 each a sum of $5,000,000 annually for the payment [Voir. 121. of the American debt by an authorization issued to all post offices in Italy to-day to accept individual and group contributions. This movement, which had its inception with Genoa commercial bodies, aims to pay all the earlier installments of the Italian debt to the United States by such popular subscriptions.\" Premier Painleve of France has not made special progress with his financial plan, which, he submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on Nov. 17. It is now in the period of discussion by that body. The New York \"Herald Tribune\" correspondent in the French capital stated on Nov.16 that \"the discussion will certainly last a week, probably two, and if the propcised measures are accepted by the Chamber an equal period of debate is probable in the Senate, where the opposition to the heavy taxes imposed by the Premier is especially strong.\" An encouraging development was that two days later the Socialists decided at party meetings that they \"would not introduce counter-proposals instituting a drastic capital levy. Nevertheless, the Socialists, while voting for the Government bills, will make it clear wherein they have sacrificed their principles to the cartel discipline and probably in the course of the debate will introduce critical amendments.\" In an Associated Press dispatch from Paris on Nov. 17 it was predicted that \"there will be a deficit of at least 5,000,000,000 francs in the budget during the current year. Revenue returns for the first ten months show total receipts of 22,800,000,000, while the revenue is budgeted for just above 33,000,000,000, leaving some 10,000,000,000 to be made up in the last two months of the year. This to some observers appears impossible. Detailed returns show that the revenue for October actually was less than for October 1924, in spite of the altered value of the franc, in spite of increased taxation and in spite of former Minister of Finance Caillaux's efforts to speed up the collection of taxes. The fact of this deficit, as revealed by the returns, seems to have attracted little or no attention, everybody being absorbed by Premier Painleve's financial program, although the efficacy of this would appear necessarily to be based on the assumption that the budget would balance.\" In describing the first day of debate on the bill in the Chamber of Deputies, the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" said: \"Somewhat academically and without its almost customary display of political heat, the French Chamber began this afternoon to discuss the Government's bill for provision of a sinking fund to take care of the country's large floating debt. During its preparation the political aspects of the Government's plan had been all-important. But to-day it was the financial provisions of the bill, its capacity to meet the situation and the right and wrong from the financial aspect of the methods of raising the requisite funds which occupied and held the serious attention of the Chamber. Curiously, even those speakers who declared they would vote for the measure were critical of its provisions in many cases, and there became apparent an attitude of hesitancy about taking the step the Government proposes.\" It was suggested that, \"except for the Government's difficulty in meeting maturities on Dec. 8, there is no urgent reason for rushing this bill through, and one Deputy of the Govern- Nov.21 1925.1 THE CHRONICLE ment's own party asked pertinently whether in the effort to meet the maturities of Dec. 8, which will now probably be covered by a small inflation, insufficient attention was not being given to the main problem. Half a dozen alternative courses and possible amendments were developed during this general debate. Three or four times orators of all parties came back to the thesis that the creation of stable money was the first requisite of all reform and to the argument that taxation of rents proposed among other measures was far from likely to create public confidence and facilitate stabilization. In.Government circles it is hoped the measure will be passed through the Chamber by the beginning of next week and then sent to the Senate Finance Commission.\" It was suggested that \"as soon as this debate is over the Chamber will discuss the Locarno treaties, which will be rushed through both houses as quickly as possible.\" In a special Paris dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" on Nov. 18 it was said that \"the Painleve Government, both on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies and in an official communique, announced to-day that measures would be taken at the earliest possible moment to stabilize the franc. Deputy Charles Lamoureux, general reporter of the Ministry's finance bill, said that these measures would guaranty a balanced budget and pave the way for the rehabilitation of French exchange, for which legislative proposals would soon be introduced.\" The correspondent added that \"at the same time, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement which declared that everything was being subordinated to the passage of the new taxation measures which are considered essential as the basis of stabilization. The budget for 1926, says the statement, reckons on a revenue of 36,000,000,000 francs, of Which 33,000,000,000 is assured, leaving a defict of 3,000,000,000 francs. Of the revenues contemplated under the present bill, 5,500,000,000 francs will go into the sinking fund for the retirement of the floating debt; 3,000,000,000 francs will cover the interest of the National Defense bonds and 2,500,000,000 francs will go toward their retirement from circulation.\" It was further asserted in the statement that \"thus the budget is on a solid basis and it is the most rigorous budgetary equilibrium which exists in any country that has planned financial rehabilitation.\" Dispatches from Paris yesterday stated that \"before the Chamber this [Thursday] afternoon Premier Painleve defended his finance bill as the first real effort to deal with a situation which for more than three years has been weighing on the country without an attempt at a remedy. His bill, he admitted, was not perfect, but he argued that it had this to be said for it, that it was a positive measure and had survived the difficulty of seeing the light amid a multitude of counsels as to what the Government must not do.\" In an Associated Press dispatch from Paris last evening it was stated that \"Leon Blum, leader of the Socialists in the Chamber of Deputies, delivered an ultimatum to the Government from the Tribune of the Chamber demanding that it give assurances that the billion and a half of new bank notes, the issue of which is contemplated in Premier Painleve's financial proposals, would be the final limit of currency inflation. The Premier replied that it would be impossible to give such assurances. It is expected 2445 that a test vote will come to-night upon the Government's demand for ending the general discussion of its financial measures. After the Premier had refused to give the assurances asked, M. Blum made it clear that the Socialists probably would abandon the Government and make it impossible for M. Painleve to obtain a majority for his bill providing for a sinking fund.\" The result of the voting was not received before going to press. Are the Fascisti to seize control of the French Government, as they did that of Italy, and is France to have a virtual dictator, as Italy has in the person of Premier Mussolini? It seems that in France this group are characterized by their blue shirts, whereas Mussolini and his followers, when they marched into Rome, were known as \"Black Shirts.\" The French Fascisti contingent had its first meeting toward real organization on Armistice Day. The Paris correspondent of the New York \"Times\" said in a dispatch on Nov. 14 that it was \"merely a preliminary canter.\" They met again on Nov. 15 and \"laid down their program.\" Deputy Pierre Taittinger, President of the League of Young Patriots, \"out of which the Fascisti organization has grown,\" was quoted as outlining the program in part as follows: \"What we want is authority in Government. We want authority because we want order and justice. Within the Republican form of Government we want a chief who will be a real chief—who will govern. We do not want at the Elysee a rubber stamp President. We want one who can choose his Ministers when he wishes and where he wishes, even outside of Parliament. These Ministers will be responsible to him. His Cabinet will have the power of the purse, which Parliament now abuses.\" The correspondent suggested that \"This program entirely reverses the present political order. M. Taittinger wants the President and Cabinet to have all the initiative in legislation, and Parliament to be a rubber stamp.\" It is very similar to what Mussolini's bill, outlined in another paragraph of this article, provides. In cable advices to the \"Times\" the following day it was stated that \"from all over France blue-shirted Fascisti poured into Paris last night to take part to-day in the inauguration of the movement which in the minds of its originators is destined to save France by substituting an authoritative President of the Republic for the present Parliamentary Government. Four thousand of these young men gathered at Luna Park to obtain from the hands of Pierre Taittinger, President of their league, their banners and hear enunciated the program which they are sworn to carry out. All over the city during the afternoon bands of these young men and bands of opposing Communist forces wandered sing. ing. The Government, with an air of impartiality toward both extremes, forbade all regular processions and in particular a procession to the Arc de Triomphe which the Young Patriots planned. But everybody marched just the same, only they didn't do it officially.\" It was suggested that,\"for the upholders of parliamentary government it was not an auspicious day. Communists at their meetings and in their processions were demanding the substitution of dictatorial Soviets for a Parliament elected by universal suffrage. The Patriots at their meetings were demanding much the same thing, only they want their own kind of dictator instead of the Moscow Soviet.\" 2446 Trtm CilitOlstletE Practically all the European cable advices relative to the Locarno treaties have been encouraging. On Nov. 13 the Berlin representative of the New York \"Times\" cabled that,\"for the first time since the inception of the security negotiations President von Hindenburg has publicly proclaimed the virtues of the Locarno settlement.\" He asserted that \"from • the German standpoint this is the most important tribute paid to the labors of Allied and German statecraft on Lago Maggiore last month. It parried assurance, moreover, that the Locarno treaties and their 'logical consequences' will come into effect without further hitch,since were their realization still in doubt the Chief Magistrate of the German republic would avoid official reference to them and certainly would not extol the benefits they contain.\" Continuing his account of the event he said: \"President von Hindenburg's pronouncement was made in the course of an address delivered at Darmstadt this morning in response to a formal speech of welcome with which he was greeted there by the President of the Hesse. Free State, Dr. Ulrich, who himself stressed the Hessians' faith in the outcome of Locarno ameliorating the position of their compatriots in the occupied part of Hesse. Voicing his appreciation of and sympathy with the 'troubles and distress burdening the Hessian homeland,' the Field Marshal declared: 'We may hope that the worst times have been surmounted and that negotiations initiated at Locarno will lead to the liberation of the occupied territory, including the Hessian zone, from its heaviest burdens and the recovery of that possibility of action necessary to its existence.\" He stated, furthermore, that \"the speeches made on this occasion were drawn up and approved by the German Cabinet before the President left Berlin on his official visit to Southwestern Germany, so that von lindenburg's optimistic utterance was in no sense spontaneous but rather a carefully considered verdict.\" In view of the foregoing, it should not have been surprising that \"the German Envoy at Paris was notified on Nov. 14 by the Conference of Ambassadors on behalf of the Allied Powers that evacuation of the Cologne zone would begin Dec. 1. He was further notified that forthwith the character of the occupation of the Coblenz and Mayence zones would be radically changed and in the future there would be only strictly military occupation by a reduced number of troops.\" The Paris correspondent of the New York \"Times\" explained that \"this action, primarily the fruit of the Locarno treaties, followed a meeting of the Conference of Ambassadors held that evening from 5 to 8 o'clock, and came at the instance of the British Government as the result of a message sent by Dr. Stresemann last night to both Mr. Chamberlain and M.Briand, saying the German Royalists were planning a big Sunday demonstration against the treaties, and that it would be an immense help to the German Government if it could announce at the same time the Allied decision on the evacuation of Cologne.\" Additional incidents relative to these highly important developments were related in part as follows by the \"Times\" correspondent: \"Mr. Chamberlain had previously made a compromise proposal to the French which calmed their fears that the Germans would not keep their promises made this week to fulfill the remaining defaults in the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Under the compromise the evacuation will begin Dec. 1 and take place in stages, being completed in [vol. 121. about two months if the Germans carry out their pledges. If the Germans do not, the British promise to delay the completion of evacuation. Marshal Foch attended the meeting of the Ambassadors and gave his approval of the decision to begin Cologne evacuation the first of next month. It will be recalled that Cologne was due to be evacuated last January under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, saying the three bridgeheads were to be evacuated five, ten and fifteen years after the coming into effect of the treaty, but that evacuation was held up by the Allies on the ground that Germany was in. default on the military clauses of the treaty.\" Commenting upon the action of the Allies, the same correspondent said: \"Back of the Allied generosity there is a desire to convince the Germans that they really mean to inaugurate a new regime of Europe. A mutual guarantee treaty has been signed by Germany and France which will be of value only if reposing on mutual good-will and trust. The Allied policy now is to cease the policy which has been characterized as a policy of pinpricks and give Germany plenty of room to show good faith. In other words, having achieved what they can toward the material disarmament of Germany, the Allies now turn to hopes of her moral disarmament, at the same time recognizing that if Germany does not disarm morally it is not'within the power of the Allies to keep her disarmed materially. Of course in joining in this policy France is thinking of the guarantee England and Italy have given to come to her assistance if Germany attacks her again. To-night's action by the Allies opens the way for the German signing the Locarno treaties in London on Dec. 1, 'and in Allied quarters, at least, there is BO longer any doubt that the ceremony will take place on the scheduled date and that King George will be able to give his State banquet to Foreign Ministers at Buckingham Palace on the evening of the signing of the Locarno treaties.\" A notable banquet was given by the London Press Club on the evening of Nov. 14. The same spirit of conciliation which made possible the Locarno treaty appears to have been much in evidence. The representative at that centre of the New York \"Times\" said: \"To-night was Locarno night at the London Press Club. The occasion was the presence there of Ambassadors of the European nations and other distinguished foreigners, together with some of the most prominent men in Great Britain. The guests included the French, Italian and Belgian Ambassadors, the Polish and Czechoslovakian Ministers, Viscount Cecil, better known as Lord Robert Cecil, so often in the limelight as the foremost British chainpion of the League of Nations, and Sir William Tyrrell. The German Ambassador was prevented at the last moment from attending by illness, and was represented by Herr Dufour-Forenca, Counselor of the German Embassy.\" He declared also that \"a noteworthy point about the banquet was that on the list of the guests of honor the name of the German Ambassador preceded that of the French Ambassador, seniority being the only guide followed in printing the names. 'It certainly looks as if the war was over,' remarked one guest as he noticed that.\" Continuing, the \"Times\" correspondent said: \"All the speakers, whether British or Continental, joined in extolling the spirit of Locarno, until their words. blended into an international symphony of praise, Nov 21 1925.] THE CHRONICLE with peace as its keynote and no discords to mar its harmony. And through it all, too, ran an American strain. Allusions to America, serious and facetious, kept cropping up as if the great republic overseas was never far from the speakers' thoughts. It remained for Lord Cecil to fuse all this harmony into a stirring finale. Speaking earnestly and simply, as if his words were drawn from his heart, the veteran champion of the League called the Locarno pact 'not an agreement to enforce peace, but an agreement to prevent war.'\" Special emphasis was laid by the same correspondent on the fact that \"there was a noticeable stir among those present, and an outbreak of applause when the German envoy declared: 'Our Government really wants peace, and hopes that the Locarno pact will lead to peace.'\" Events in which the so-called Locarno spirit of conciliation has been much in evidence have followed one another in rapid succession. Several have been outlined in preceding paragraphs. Here is another: On Nov.16 the Paris correspondent of the New York \"Times\" cabled that \"the 'Allied Powers' which since the World War have dominated Europe will in all probability soon cease to exist as such. The British . Government has suggested to the French Government that in conformity with the spirit of Locarno, which restores Germany to a position of equality among the European Powers, this grouping of the victorious European nations should be technically dissolved as a final sign that the war is over and peace restored.\" He explained that \"the important move advocated by London is adding the German Ambassador at Paris to the Conference of Ambassadors, the body charged with execution of the Treaty of Versailles. The Ambassadors' body would then cease to be strictly an Allied body forcing execution of the treaty of peace, but a European body for general co-operation in liquidating the great conflict.\" Continuing, the \"Times\" representative said that \"it is understood the French Foreign Mission is favorably inclined toward this measure, and it may be expected that if Germany carries out her disarmament promises she will be admitted to the Conference of Ambassadors the first part of the year, about the same time she joins the League of Nations and becomes a member of the Council of that body.\" He likewise suggested that 'another step, suggested by Austen Chamberlain, is said to be abolition of the Allied Military Mission headed by Marshal Foch and charged with supervision of the execution of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. It is considered likely M. Briand will not accept this move, but will suggest that a German General be admitted to the Military Committee, which would thus lose its strictly Allied character. The technical reason back of Briand's attitude is said to be that the military mission is the only body charged with supervision of the occupation of the Rhineland, and that • even with Cologne evacuated the mission is needed to watch over the occupation of the Coblenz and Mayence bridgeheads.\" The correspondent did not fail to point out that \"of course, the obvious motives of the Allies in moving in this direction are to restore European unity, and, coming after the decision to begin the evacuation of Cologne even before the Reich had fulfilled completely its disarmament obligations, these plans certainly show the Allies are ready to give the Locarno system every chance to succeed.\" 2447 The very next day announcement was made in another special Paris cable message to the New York \"Times\" that \"publication of the Allies' note to Germany informing Berlin that the evacuation of Cologne will begin Dec. 1, reveals that the Allies have agreed to abolish the Allied Commission of Military Control in Germany on Feb. 1, if Germany shall have by that time fulfilled the conditions justifying completion of evacuation of the Cologne zone.\" It was added that \"military control of Germany, or rather observation of her observance of the military conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, will then be taken over by a League of Nations committee on which Germany will be represented.\" The New York \"Times\" correspondent declared that \"this marks an important development with large political significance. Whereas the Allied Military Control Commission reported to the Allies, and the Allies alone were able to take sanctions and other measures in accord, the League commission will not report to the Allies but to Geneva,and consideration of alleged German defaults will thereafter not be in the hands of the Allies alone, but will be judged by the League Council, of which Germany will be a member.\" He likewise maintained that \"this has a big bearing on Rhineland occupancy. The period of oecupation by the Allies of the Coblenz and Mayence bridgeheads was fixed at ten and fifteen years from the coming into effect of the Treaty of Versailles, that is 1920. TheAllies have the right to prolong their occupation of these two bridgeheads, as they did of the Cologne bridgehead, but now the Council of the League and not the Allies alone would have to decide whether Germany was in default. This is regarded as one more step in bringing into operation the new system of equality among the European nations; in other words, the ending of the war and its political aftermath.\" The German Government acted promptly with respect to the Locarno treaty. It became known here through a special Berlin cable message to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 17 that, \"although not altogether content with the 'logical consequences' as interpreted in the note of the Conference of Ambassadors, the German Government to-day determined to carry the program.of Locarno to its completion. Formal decisions were deferred, however, until after the Premiers of the German Federated States have assembled on Thursday and passed on the Parliamentary bills for the enactment of the security accords which Foreign Minister Stresemann has been authorized to draw up meanwhile.\" It was suggested also that \"by to-day's action President von Hindenburg and his Ministers in principle stamped with their approval the concessions the Allies propose to apply in the administration of the occupied Rhineland as well as the period fixed for the evacuation of Cologne.\" The Berlin representative of the New York \"Evening Post\" asserted in a dispatch the next day (Nov. 18) that \"the Cabinet has fully accepted the Locarno treaties and the concessions which the Allies have promised to make, especially in the Rhineland occupation. Chancellor Luther will go before the Reichstag Monday to fight for ratification.\" He claimed that \"the prospects for ratifi-day than since the Locarno concation are better to ference ended.

In addition, 'get-togethers' of authors and editors will be arranged to prove to each of the opposing camps that members of the other are not such bad chaps after all. The Fascist program for the solution of the problem of 'class struggle,' embodied in the law drawn up by Alfredo Rocco, Minister of Justice, has been approved by the Cabinet. The new system provides for the institution of special courts to handle disputes between capital and labor, makes compulsory the arbitration of labor conflicts, recognizes as legal Fascist labor unions and employers' organizations, and legalizes agreements made between them.\" The Paris representative of the \"Times\" cabled on Nov. 16 that \"a dispatch to the 'Malin' from Rome states that Secretary General Farinacci of the Fascist Party, next to Mussolini the most popular figure in Fascism, has announced a rigorous program for the defense of Fascism at home and abroad. The first on the list of the 'defensive laws' against the enemies of the Italian State is one which will reach out to the far corners of the world and, in extreme cases, serve to deprive of their citizenship those Italians who are now carrying on what the Fascist leader calls 'anti-Italian propaganda.' This loss of citizenship will be followed by confiscation of property. At home laws are to be adopted making all but the Fascisti unions illegal, but certain unions, which are of an unmistakably national character, will be permitted to exist as 'private associations.' Another reform upon which Fascism will insist is the election of a certain number of Senators by popular vote,' continues Signor Farinacci. 'Under the present system Senators are appointed by the King. We want to have representatives of the Fascist unions in the Senate, just as the Senate is now thoroughly representative of Italian commerce and industry. So far as the Chamber of Deputies is concerned, nothing will be altered and all of the members will be elected by popular universal suffrage. After these reforms, Fascism will quickly encompass the whole of Italy.'\" It was made plain in an Associated Press dispatch from Rorge on Nov. 18 that steps already taken by Mussolini and his political supporters were largely preliminary to the introduction of a concrete measure that would still further increase the Premier's powers as a dictator and make him responsible only to the King. The dispatch stated that the measure had been approved by the Cabinet,\"and is shortly to be presented for Parliamentary enactment.\" The bill also \"specifies that no question can be included in the agenda of either the Senate or the Chamber of Deputies without his approval.\" Perhaps Article II is the most important and comprehen sive of all the six sections of the document. It reads as follows: \"Article IL—The Premier is nominated and recalled by the King, and is responsible to the Bing in the general political direction of the Government. The decree for nomination of the Premier is confirmed by him, and that recalling him by his successor. The Ministers are nominated and recalled by the King on the proposal of the Premier. They are responsible to the King and the Premier for all acts and measures by their Ministries. The Under Secretaries are nominated and recalled by the King on the proposal of the Premier in agreement with the Ministers concerned.\" 2449 It developed in subsequent cable advices from Rome that at the same session \"another bill was introduced providing less of citizenship and possible confiscation of property for Italians abroad offending the Fascist Government.\" Cable advices from Beirut, Damascus and London the present week have not been encouraging to the French notwithstanding the recall of General Sarrail. For instance, on Nov. 17, according to a cable message to the New York \"Times\" from London, \"special dispatches to the 'Daily Mail' from various parts of Syria state the rebellion against the French has assumed grave proportions. Strong rebel forces are stated to be trying to unite to seize the important seaport and base of Beirut and to cut the Beirut-Damascus Railroad. If such a juncture is effected, says the paper's Damascus correspondent, the combined rebel forces would number several thousand; they could easily seize Beirut, which is defended by only a few guns. The correspondent understands in such event French would not hesitate to bombard the city.\" The \"Daily Mail\" correspondent described the situation still further as follows: • \"Every outgoing train to Bierut is crowded with Damascenes, who are aggravating the refugee situation at the capital of Lebanon, where already 20,000 Armenian refugees from Turkey are living,. mostly in the most primitive homes made of oil tins. Damascus has a thousand Armenians rendered homeless and destitute aud 1,590 refugees from the Hauran districts to the south, whose plight is even worse. Moslem Arabs, who lost approximately 500 homes in the bombardment, are being cared for by the more fortunate Arabs; who are soliciting funds on their behalf.\" That the French realized the seriousness. of the situation was indicated by the following from, London on Nov. 17: \"A dispatch from Beirut to the 'Evening News'says that all automobiles in the cityhave been commandeered for conveying several thousand French troops to South Lebanon, the region southwest of Damascus, where an important situation is developing.\" Even the French were willing to admit the seriousness of the Syrian affair, as will be seen from the following special Paris dispatch to the New York \"Evening Post,\" also on Nov. 17: \"Albert Londres, special correspondent of the 'Petit Parisien,' cables from Damascus: 'The situation in Syria remains very grave. Damascus can only be reached by a light train preceded by an armed escort and followed by a tank, while no one is able to leave Damascus without encountering within a half mile Druses and bandits ready to pillage and massacre. Indeed, security resides only where our strength is shown.\" Rumors of peace moves were received the same day. A special Damascus correspondent of the New York \"Herald Tribune\" cabled that, \"with Beirut in peril of capture by insurgent bands, it became known to-day that the French are secretly negotiating for peace with Sultan Altrash Pasha, leader of the rebel Druses, at Deraa. These negotiations are being conducted by Colonel Andrea for the French. Fifteen thousand rebels are surrounding this city and reports are current that the French forces have decided to evacuate it.\" He asserted also that \"the only hope of relief for the French lies in their ability to induce the Druses to lay down their arms, and in order to accomplish this the French will offer the, 2450 THE CHRONICLE Druses easy terms. In French circles here it is held that they can do this without loss of prestige owing to the change in High Commissions and the end of General Sarrail's 'brutal' regime.\" It would seem from the following dispatch that the French Government had decided that it could not handle the situation in Syria alone. The Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" cabled on Nov. 18 that \"Senator Henry de Jouvenel, the new French High Commissioner to Syria, goes to London to-morrow to confer with Foreign Minister Austen Chamberlain on a program for Franco-British co-operation in the mandated territories of Asia Minor, where Britain holds the mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia.\" He added that \"it is expected here that Paris and London will pledge each other their political and moral, if not military, support in handling difficulties which may arise in these mandates, with particuLa reference to the present French troubles in Syria.\" The correspondent also suggested that \"it is significant that M. de Jouvenel goes to London as a result of suggestion made by Mr. Chamberlain to M. Briand.\" Word came from London the next day that \"Henry de Jouvenel, newly appointed French High Commissioner to Syria, arrived in London to-day to confer with Foreign Secretary Chamberlain in regard to the situation in the Near East. 'My policy is to work with the League of Nations and to bring to Syria full independence at the soonest possible moment,' M. de Jouvenel said in a public statement.\" It was added that \"General Duport, acting French High Commissioner in Syria, hopes to break the Druse rebellion within three weeks, according to the Beirut correspondent of the 'Evening News.'\" The British Parliament resumed its sessions on Monday, Nov. 16, after a four months' recess. The present session is characterized as a \"short one,\" as it is expected to last only five or six weeks. The London correspondent of \"The Sun\" observed,, however, in a dispatch on the opening day, that \"there should be plenty of fireworks.\" As noted in an earlier paragraph, the principal action taken so far has been the adoption of the Treaty of Locarno by a vote of 375 to 13. Official Bank rates at leading European centres continue to be quoted at 9% in Berlin; 7% in Italy; 2 1 / 2 1 / 6 % in Belgium; 6% in Paris; 5 % in Denmark; 2 1 / Norway;4 % in Sweden;4% in 5% in Madrid and 2 1 / London and 3 in Holland and Switzerland.

The exact amount of the decline in note circulation was 118,815,000 marks. As against this, other maturing obligations increased 134,745,000 marks and other liabilities 33,689,000 marks. On the assets side, the Bank reported a shrinkage in bills of exchange and checks of 31,334,000 marks. Advances, however, increased 49,000 marks, reserve in foreign currencies 14,191,000 marks and silver and other coins 924,000 marks. Increases were likewie in notes on other banks,6,413,000 marks; investments 420,000 marks and other assets 58,894,000 marks. Gold and bullion holdings increased 62,000 marks, to 1,206,959,000 marks, as against 694,626,000 marks a year ago and 467,025,000 marks in 1923. Note circulation outstanding aggregates 2,558,829,000 marks. No particularly striking changes were noted in the Federal Reserve banks statements that were issued at the close of business on Thursday. Moderate gains in gold holdings are shown to have occurred both locally and nationally. Rediscounting, however, as well as open market operations, were larger for the System, but declined at New York. For the banks as a group, gold increased $3,100,000. Rediscounts of paper secured by Government obligations expanded $4,300,000. In \"other\" bills there was a contraction of $2,600,000, so that total bills discounted increased $1,700,000. Holdings of bills bought in the open market expanded $2,200,000. Total bills and securities (earning assets) were only moderately changed—expanding $3,600,000, but deposits were augmented $33,100,000. The report of. the New York Bank revealed a gain in gold of $10,800,000. Rediscounting of all classes of bills fell approximately $5,100,000. Bills bought in the open market were reduced $6,000,000. A falling off of $9,700,000 occurred in total bills and securities, but deposits rose $5,600,000. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation was increased $2,700,000 at New York and decreased $3,200,000 for the System. Member bank reserve accounts were increased $28,600,000 in the combined report, and $7,300,000 at New York. As these changes so largely offset one another, reserve ratios remained practically unaltered. The local institution reported an increase of 0.4%, to 82.8%, while for the System as a whole there was a decline of 0.2%, to 72.1%. Last Saturday's statement of the New York Clearing House banks and trust companies was featured by contraction in both loans and deposits and the restoration of a substantial surplus reserve, all of which was brought about, mainly, by reduction in loans, possibly because of Stock Exchange liquidation. In detail the figures show that loans fell $24,637,000, while net demand deposits decreased $14,990,000, to $4,501,102,000, which total is exclusive of Government deposits to the amount of $17,200,000. Time deposits, on the other hand, expanded $8,680,000, to $558,758,000. Among the less important changes noted were a reduction of $2,746,000 in cash in own vaults of members of the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing the total to $47,035,000; this total, however, is not counted as reserve. State banks and trust company reserves in own vaults fell $475,000, while reserves kept by these institutions in other 2451 THE CHRONICLE depositories gained nominally, $2,000. Member banks added to their reserves at the Reserve institution the sum of $51,512,000, and this in conjunction with smaller deposits was sufficient to bring about an addition to surplus of $52,626,690, thereby eliminating last week's deficiency in reserve of $7,943,220 and rolling up an excess reserve of $14,683,470. The above figures for surplus reserves are based on legal reserve requirements of 13% against demand deposits by member banks of the Federal Reserve, but not including $47,035,000 cash in vault held by these member banks on Saturday last. Inasmuch as the member banks of the local Clearing House showed a substantial surplus last Saturday, against a deficit of over $7,000,000 a week earlier, it was assumed over the week-end that loans would not be called at the beginning of this week and that rates for call money would not be advanced. Just the opposite happened. Loans were called in a single day to the extent of $15,000,000, according to estimates in the financial district, and the rate on demand loans rose to 5%. From that time on, however, the trend was downward, as it was last week. It was reported at about mid-week that during a single session $30,000,000 was available in the loaning department of the Stock Exchange, with only a moderate demand. Yesterday, although it was Friday, and in spite of the flurry caused by the advance in the rediscount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank at Cleveland and Philadelphia to 4%,following that at Boston the previous week, call money ruled at 4 % all day on the Stock Exchange. In the so/ 1 2 called outside market it was•quoted at 43 4%. Of course, these quotations did not indicate any stringency. Collateral loans in Wall Street must have been reduced somewhat by the further liquidation in stocks. Numerous extra cash and stock dividends have been announced, also plans for \"splitting up\" share capital. They bear witness to prosperity. Many favorable earnings statements have been published. Car loadings for the 16th consecutive week were in excess of 1,000,000 cars. The promptness with which the $100,000,000 Italian Government loan was taken yesterday spoke well for the investment market. Other foreign loans are likely to follow in the near future. Domestic'financing is not on a specially large scale at the moment. It would be reasonable to expect a somewhat firmer money market. 1=7•••=46•0' Referring to money rates inrdetail, loans on call have covered a range of 4320,5%, the same as a week ago. On Monday the high was 5%, the low 43/2% with 06% for renewals. Tuesday there was a slight flurry that sent ca 1 rates to 5% as a basis for renewals, and, in fact, the on'y rate named for the-day. Call funds again renewed on Wednesday at 5%, and this was the high, but before the close there was a decline to 43..%. Further relaxation made itself evident on Thursday and no loans were made above 43 %, which was also the ruling rate; 4 the low was 43/2%. On Fr day there was no range, all loansronrcall being negotiated at 4 this beingithe high, the low and renewal basis. For fixed date maturities the market was quiet and a trifle firmer. The longer periods, from ninety days to six months, are now quoted at 47 @5%, as against 4 438% (the trading rate) last week. Sixty-day money remains at 43/%, unchanged. Offerings THE CHRONICLE 2452 were usually adequate and the demand light. No large individual trades were reported. Mercantile paper rates have not been changed from 4y 4.@43,r for four to six months' names of choice 70 character, with names not so well known still reqiiiring 432%. New England mill paper and the shorter choice names are still passing at 43%. Most of the business passing was with interior banks, but the market was only moderately active with offerings scarce. Banks' and bankers' acceptances were quiet and the market featureless. Firmness in the call division precluded any general expansion in dealings in acceptances. Consequently, the week's turnover was limited. The undertone was steady and quotations unchanged. For call loans against bankers' acceptances the posted rate of the American Acceptance Council is back again to 4%, the same as on Friday last, after haying been up to 43.% early in the week.. The Acceptance Council makes the discount rate on prime bankers' acceptances eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve banks 33 % A bid and 33.% asked for bills running 30 days, 332% bid and 3%% asked for 60 days, 3%% bid and .33/2% asked for 90 days, 3%% bid and 3%% asked for 120 days, 3 8 % bid and 3% asked for 150 days, and 4% bid and 378 asked for 180 days. % Open market quotations are as follows: SPOT DELIVERY. tIlt Days 90 Days Prime eligible Mils FOR DELIVERY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS Eligible member banks Eligible non-member banks asogssi axeasi Ito Das tot oau IH bi 394 b9 Following the action of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston last week, both the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia have the present week advanced their rediscount rates from 332% to 4% on all classes of paper. The Cleveland institution made the announcement after the close of business on Monday (Nov. 16) and the Philadelphia bank followed with like action after the close of business on Thursday (Nov. 19). Only the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco are continuing the 332% rate.

At the opening, prices were held at the levels prevailing on Friday last, namely, 4 84%. Later on freer offerings of commercial bills {yob 121 induced a slightly easier tone and quotations sagged off %c.to 4 841 s. In the main, however, the under/ tone was steady and sufficient buying was forthcoming to prevent serious losses. With the approach of Thursday the question of an increase in the Bank of England discount rate revived and imparted a general feeling of uneasiness, since the belief prevails that the advance would at once be followed by similar action on the part of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. No such change was made and thereafter demand rates turned weak and touched a new low on the present movement, bringing the rate to a very small fraction above the point at which it would be profitable to import gold. The result was to cause renewed talk of gold shipments to this centre. Some bankers were of the opinion that sterling would decline to a point whereby gold would again flow in this direction. Furthermore, it is noted that bankers' bills in London are advancing and only a trifle under the Bank rate; all of which tends to confirm last week's predictions of firmer monetary conditions in London. Much of this is of course the natural result of removal of the embargo on foreign loans in London, which has had the joint effect of depressing sterling and stiffening money rates. Nevertheless, as the British Bank has been able to withstand all pressure and adhere to its 4% rate in spite of continued and increasing demands incidental to commercial offerings, it is thought possible the 4% rate may be maintained for some little time to come. The lowering of the Bank rate to its present level is said to have been very helpful to business in England, and bankers are naturally in no hurry to bring about a setback through higher money rates. Should gold be forced this way to any material extent, the probability is that a higher Bank rate would be obligatory; that is, if Great Britain desires to keep her $300,000,000 credit intact. Referring to the day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday last was dull but steady; demand ruled at 4 843 (one rate), cable transfers at 4 84X and % sixty days at 4 811 8.

Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4 84. No gold engagements were reported this week, although as sterling displayed a declining tendency, Nov.21 1925.] THE CHROiNICLE quotations at times were so close to the gold import point as to arouse expectations of another movement of the precious metal this way. The Bank of England is still shipping gold to the Straits and elsewhere. A consignment of £120,000 was announced for export to Spain by the Bank of England. 2453 again came to the front as a result of renewed violent fluctuations. After opening at 16.15, there was an advance to 16.70, then a spectacular slump to 15.20, a new low, on heavy selling, based on the recent resignation of the Polish Cabinet which was brought about by reason of opposition to its stabilization policies. Although the Bank of Poland is said to Irregular weakness predominated in the Ccintinen- have followed an extremely conservative course of tal exchanges and trading continued sporadic in action in its efforts to reduce note circulation and character and at times considerably confused. build up credit, business interests are said to be in Rate variations, however, were less drastic than has favor of easier methods to be achieved by introbeen the case of late and the volume of business duction of inflationary measures.

THE CHRONICLE As to South American exchange, mixed movements occurred, and Argentine pesos made further progress and advanced to 41.79 for checks and to 41.84 for cable transfers, then closed at 41.65 and 41.71, as against 41.67 and 41.72 last week. Brazilian milreis, on the other hand, slumped heavily, losing 78 points and dropping to 14.20 for checks and to 14.24 for cable transfers, though rallying partly and closing at 14.33 and 14.38, which compares with 14.98 and 15.03 a week ago. The break was attributed to a falling off in the volume of foreign buying of coffee in Brazil. Conversely, the latter has been due it is claimed to the high exchange values having affected the coffee movement unfavorably. Chilean exchange was a shade easier and finished at 12.26, against 12.32. Peru continued to be quoted at 3.98, the same as last week. . Far Eastern rates were without very great change, with the possible exception of Japanese yen which advanced to 433 on news of additional shipments of gold from Japan.

The large volume of checks on institutions located outside of ew York are not accounted for in arriving at these balances as such checks do not pass through the Clearing House but are deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank for collection for the account of the local Clearing House banks.

The Chinese Customs Conktence. The announcement on Thursday that the Chinese Customs Conference, which has been in session at Peking since Oct. 30, had agreed to grant complete tariff autonomy to China, while China in return had agreed to abolish the likin, ends the first stage of a discussion which, if it shall be carried to a successful conclusion, seems likely to open the way to farreaching changes in the commercial relations of China with the rest of the world, and at the same time contribute to the establishment of the internal peace which China has long needed. The proceedings of the Conference have attracted less attention in this country than the importance of the subject deserves, and a summary view of the background of the Conference, and of the steps which led up to the action taken on Thursday, seems appropriate at this time. The Conference, in which China and all the foreign Powers having diplomatic representatives in China, except Germany and Russia, have been taking part, was called in pursuanoe of the Nine-Power Treaty signed at Washington on Feb. 6 1922. The immediate occasion for a conference was the decline in Chinese customs receipts due to rising prices, and the inability of the Chinese Government, because of treaty obligations, to raise the tariff duties without the consent of the Powers. Ever since the conclusion of the Nanking Treaty with Great Britain, in 1842, the Powers which have maintained diplomatic relations with China have exercised control, severally or jointly, over the Chinese customs service, and a considerable part of the customs receipts have been Nov.21 1925.] THE CHRONICLE pledged as security for the repayment of foreign loans. It was with this situation that the Nine-Power Treaty undertook to deal. In December 1918 an International Commission at Shanghai had established an ad valorem rate of 5% on all imports, but by 1922 the rise in prices had operated to reduce the rate in practice to about 3 %. Article I of the / 1 2 Washington Treaty provided for a. comthission, sitting at Shanghai, which should so adjust the duties as to make the rate an actual 5%. In treaties concluded in 1902 and 1903, China had promised to abolish the likin (internal taxes levied on goods passing from province to province),in return for which, with other reforms, it was empowered to levy a surtax of 2 %. The likin were not abolished, however, and / 1 2 Article II of the Washington Treaty provided for a commission which should arrange for such abolition within three months. Article III of the WaShing-. ton Treaty further modified the surtax by authorizing a rate of 5% on luxuries, the rate of 2 % con/ 1 2 tinuing for imports not so classed. A protracted controversy between France and China, over the demand of France for payment of the Boxer indemnity in gold francs, caused delay in putting the Washington Treaty into effect, and it was not until Aug. 5 of the present year, following the settlement of the Boxer indemnity controversy and the ratification of the treaty by France, that the treaty became operative and the necessary steps were taken to give it effect. The demands of the Chinese Government, as presented to the Washington Conference, did not extend to complete tariff autonorny, nor to the abolition of existing arrangements by which the Chinese revenue from customs is pledged as security for certain foreign loans. What was asked was the right on the part of China to increase its customs duties to such a point as it should deem necessary to meet changing prices and the need of additional revenue, without first obtaining the approval of the Powers. The rapid growth of a nationalist movement in China, however, accompanied by manifestations of anti-foreign fee"
