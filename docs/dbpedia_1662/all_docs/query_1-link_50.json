        "text": "From the Aggies to the Rams to the Golden Stallions, athletics have always played a role in the history of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. When the Second District Agricultural and Mechanical School opened in 1908, students at the area high school participated in several sports programs.\n\nSecond District A&M fielded a football team that played against teams from Tifton High School and other area schools. Leo Jones was a member of the 1910 Aggies’ football team. He remembers it this way.\n\n“In 1910, football was introduced to the school,” Jones said. “Only one boy here at that time had ever seen a football game. Despite the good coaching received under Professor (Joseph) Thrash, the team lost a majority of its games. The next year was a successful one for football. With the exception of the team of 1915, all of the teams have been among the strongest in the state.”\n\nWhen the area high school became a college and changed its name to the South Georgia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1924 and then to the Georgia State College for Men (GSCM) in 1929, the athletics’ program continued.\n\n1930-32\n\nThe Georgia State College for Men football team had its most successful season to date in the fall of 1930 with a 5-0-1 record, marred only by a 0-0 tie with the Clemson “B” Team. Coach Orion Mitchell’s Rams defeated Fort Benning 31-0, Middle Georgia 19-0, Southern 19-13, the Florida “B” team 13-6, and Norman 6-0. In the win over Fort Benning, the campus yearbook, The Rambler, stated, “The Rams could have probably run up a larger score, but Coach Mitchell put in some of his new men to see how they would look in action.”\n\nThe Rams continued their winning ways in the 1931 season. On Oct. 16, 1931, GSCM defeated the University of Miami 13-12. An Associated Press story about the game ran in the October 17th edition of The Tifton Gazette. According to that account, Miami went in front on a touchdown run in the second quarter. Down 6-0, the Rams took the lead when Mike Donehon intercepted a pass and ran 70 yards for a touchdown.\n\nStill in the second quarter, the Rams expanded the lead when Sherman England blocked a punt on the Hurricanes' two-yard line and recovered it in the end zone for another touchdown. Miami had a 13-yard TD run in the third period but GSCM held on for the victory.\n\nBesides the win over Miami, the 1931 Rams defeated Fort Benning (Artillery) 38-0, Alabama State Teachers 28-0, Fort Benning (Tank) 20-0, Oglethorpe “B” 21-0, and Florida “B” 20-0. GSCM lost to Howard 31-0, Parris Island Marines 25-12, and Stetson 28-0.\n\nThe 1932 edition of GSCM football ran roughshod over its opponents, rolling up a 7-1 record behind the antics of halfbacks Smitty Smithwick from Quitman, Gene Nix from Colquitt, Jimmy Cliett from Bainbridge, and Pee Wee Holt from Commerce. Nix was described by The Rambler as “the hardest running back on the squad who could use the stiff arm.” Smithwick was called “one of the fastest to ever wear a Rams’ uniform.” Jo Jo Caudill from Ashland, Ky., was a tackle and captain of the team. He was described as “big and powerful, a relentless tackler always tearing opposing lines to shreds.”\n\nThe Rams defeated Miami for the second year in a row in 1932 by a score of 19-6. They also thumped Fort Benning 40-0, Alabama Teachers 19-0, Stetson 33-6, Parris Island Marines 20-13, Statesboro Teachers 27-0, and Appalachian Teachers College 32-0. GSCM’s only loss was to the University of Florida freshmen by a 20-15 score. Coach Mitchell's football players won for themselves the title of \"Fighting Rams\" as they accumulated a score of 205 points to opponents' 45 in 1932. The basketball team came out with a respectable 75 percent win average.\n\nMitchell coached football, basketball, and baseball at GSCM and at ABAC from 1931-45. His 1937 and 1943 ABAC basketball teams were the Georgia junior college champions. Mitchell was an inaugural member of the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2008. Mitchell Hall, a former residence hall on the campus, was named in his honor.\n\n1933-44\n\nFootball survived the 1933 name change from the Georgia State College for Men to Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College through the 1936 season. The 1935 Golden Stallions’ football team went 4-4, winning over Bowdon 20-0, University of Tampa freshmen 26-13, Norman 13-0, and Homerville CCC 40-13. ABAC lost to South Georgia Teachers 13-0, Georgia Military 14-12, South Georgia State 38-6, and Gordon 7-0.\n\nFootball might have continued at ABAC after 1936 but the uniforms and equipment were destroyed when the gymnasium burned down after the season. ABAC never had football again.\n\nOne ABAC athlete went on to become a World War II hero. Henry Will Jones, a Marine Captain from Lakeland, received the Silver Star posthumously for his bravery against the Japanese forces at Peleliu in the Palau Islands in the south Pacific in World War II.\n\nAt ABAC, he played the guard position for the basketball team on Coach Mitchell’s 1937 state junior college champions. He also played on the 1937 ABAC baseball team and was a member of the 1936 football team. He received the prestigious “B” for football and basketball. Captain Jones was selected posthumously to the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nIn 1937, Coach Mitchell led the ABAC basketball team to a 25-24 victory over Gordon for the state championship. Under Mitchell’s direction, ABAC also won the state basketball title in 1943.\n\n1945-55\n\nCoach Bruce Gressette joined the ABAC faculty in 1945. For the next 18 years, he achieved greatness not only in the classroom, where he was an excellent mathematics instructor, but on the basketball court and the track as well. His teams won Georgia junior college basketball titles in 1946, 1947, and 1949. The 1949 and 1952 teams won National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) region championships. Gressette’s track and field teams won state championships in 1961 and 1962. His cross-country team won the state title in 1961. Gressette was an inaugural member of the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2008. Gressette Gym is named in his honor.\n\nIn 1952, Tom Cheney, a right hander from Morgan, Ga., pitched the ABAC baseball team to the state championship. Cheney later pitched in the major leagues for the Cardinals, Pirates, and Senators. He pitched in two games in the 1960 World Series which the Pirates won on Bill Mazeroski’s walk-off home run. Cheney’s greatest day as a major leaguer took place on September 12, 1962 when he set the major league record for striking out the most batters in a single game. He struck out 21 members of the Baltimore Orioles in a 16-inning 2-1 win for the Senators. Cheney pitched all 16 innings. Cheney was an inaugural member of the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nCoach Gressette’s ABAC men’s basketball team won the regional championship in 1952. The Stallions didn’t play in the regional tournament again until Coach Benny Dees’ team lost in the first round of regional play in 1964.\n\nThe Tifton Gazette reported that Ann McMillan scored 66 points while playing for the ABAC women’s basketball team in a game against Norman College in 1955. The ABAC women’s team was called the Deers at that time. ABAC won the game 87-56 under the direction of Coach Charles A. Milford.\n\n1956-61\n\nAfter graduating from Dixie High School in Brooks County, Tom Moody and his high school buddy, Philip Simpson, began classes at ABAC in 1956 where Simpson became a standout basketball player, and Moody played basketball and baseball. Simpson was inducted into the first ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame class in 2008, and Moody joined his friend in the Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nSimpson took the college basketball world by storm both at ABAC and at the University of Georgia. Nicknamed “Goose” in honor of former Harlem Globetrotter Reece “Goose” Tatum, Simpson averaged 26 points per game as a freshman at ABAC when he was named to the Georgia Junior College All-State team. During his sophomore season, he averaged 24 points a game for the Stallions and was recognized for being the ninth highest scoring player in the nation. Simpson was selected for All-America status and was chosen as the most valuable player in the state tournament where ABAC finished second in 1958. ABAC retired his jersey on the night of his last game as a Stallion.\n\nSimpson finished his college career as a two-year starter for the University of Georgia where legendary Kentucky Coach Adolph Rupp called him “the best rebounder in the SEC” in 1960. Simpson played for Georgia Coach Red Lawson and was named Most Valuable Player for the Bulldogs during his junior season when he led UGA in total field goals, total free throws, rebounds, total points and a 14.1 scoring average. Simpson was named captain of the UGA team during his senior season. He was a second team All-SEC selection for the 1960-61 season. He received the Joe Jordan Memorial Trophy for his outstanding play that year.\n\nThe Stallions made the state baseball tournament both years that Moody played second base for ABAC. After hitting .286 his sophomore year at ABAC, Moody attended Georgia Southern on a baseball scholarship where he led the Eagles with a .377 batting average during his senior season and helped catapult the team to a berth in the national championship game where they lost to Whitworth College and future St. Louis Cardinals’ ace Ray Washburn. Moody returned to ABAC in 1967 where he became the baseball coach for 24 years and the golf coach for four years.\n\n1962\n\nBenny Dees was hired as the ABAC basketball coach in the summer of 1962. He spent the summer trying to convince the father of ABAC freshman David Owens that his son needed to return to school for his sophomore year. Owens was earning some money cropping tobacco in Canada just prior to the start of the fall quarter. “I spent the whole summer talking to his daddy to make sure David was going to come back,” Dees said in a telephone interview in 2016. “I knew we needed him. He was one of the best players I ever had.”\n\nDees worked his magic, and Owens did return to ABAC where he led the Stallions to a fourth- place finish in the 1963 state junior college basketball tournament. The Pavo native and Central High of Thomasville graduate was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. For his expertise on the basketball floor, Owens was named as a member of the 2016 class of the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\n“David could score, and he was quick,” Dees said. “He could dunk two basketballs at one time. He was the best player by far on that team.” Owens chuckled as he remembered the hard charging Dees. “He could make you feel like you could jump out of the gym,” Owens said in a 2016 interview. “He was a great coach. I was just a country boy from Pavo. I had gotten a couple of calls from Florida State and Valdosta State but I wasn’t playing basketball for the scholarship. I just loved the game.”\n\nOwens played for ABAC Coach Lamar DuBose during his freshman year in 1961-62 when the Stallions wound up with a losing record. Owens also ran on the ABAC track team and won the state title in the high hurdles. Coach Gressette’s ABAC track and field team won its second straight state title in 1962.\n\n1963\n\nIn the first round of the 1963 state basketball tournament at the Georgia Southern gym in Statesboro, ABAC knocked off Georgia Southwestern 71-63 behind 23 points by Tommy Dial\n\nand 12 by David Owens. In the second round, the Stallions thumped Young Harris 86-51. Owens led the way with 20 points. Top-rated South Georgia beat the Stallions 80-63 in the semifinal game despite 22 points by Owens. Norman College then surged past ABAC 88-73 in the third-place game when Owens tossed in 19 points.\n\nOwens said he was quite shocked when he was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament by the Georgia Southern coaching staff. “I had gotten tonsillitis just prior to the tournament, and I lost about 27 pounds,” Owens said in a 2016 interview. “I had to have vitamin shots so I could play. I got most of my shots off rebounds.”\n\nOwens averaged 17.3 points and 12.1 rebounds in the four tournament games. He also captured the eye of Georgia Southern Coach J.B. Scearce who recruited him to play for the Eagles. Owens started every game at Georgia Southern and helped to lead the team to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) national tournament in his junior year and to a number one national ranking in his senior season.\n\nOwens was captain of the Georgia Southern basketball team, and his future wife, Marsha, was the captain of the cheerleaders. “ABAC was an awesome place to play,” Owens said. “They were hanging from the balcony in that little gym. It was a great experience for me.”\n\nABAC student Cook Holliday from Rochelle also made a name for himself and for ABAC. During his freshman year in 1963, he set the state junior college pole vault record. Holliday also became the first ABAC track athlete to qualify for the National Junior College track meet in Big Springs, Tex. On the train to Texas, his steel pole was misplaced, and he used a borrowed pole to finish fifth in the nation. Holliday also played on the ABAC basketball team, earning the nickname, “The Baldwin Blaster,” for his shooting skills. He helped to lead the Stallions to the state basketball championship during his sophomore year in 1964. The University of Wyoming awarded Holliday a track scholarship. Holliday was selected for the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame Class of 2009.\n\n1964\n\nThe Golden Stallions of Coach Benny Dees won the state basketball championship in 1964. The Stallions entered the 14-team tournament at Georgia Southern in Statesboro as the number three seed after going 14-3 in the league and 15-5 overall during the regular season. ABAC beat Armstrong 64-43 in the first round behind 13 points by Gwendell McSwain, 12 points by Cook Holliday, and 10 points by Jimmy Scearce. In the second round, the Stallions knocked off Augusta 80-72. McSwain scored 25 to lead an ABAC scoring parade which included 14 points apiece by Tommy Dial, Jake Popham and Holliday, and 13 points by Scearce.\n\n“Jimmy Scearce was the guts of that team,” Dees said in a 2017 interview. Dees had recruited Jake Popham and his brother, Russell, to ABAC from Manor High School, where Dees was the head coach before coming to ABAC.\n\nIn the semifinal game, ABAC slipped by second-seeded Young Harris 71-65 as Dial scorched the cords for 28 points. McSwain had 16, and Scearce added 12. The Stallions thumped top-seeded Columbus 76-58 in the title game on February 29 when Dial hit 11 of 16 shots and added five free throws for 27 points. Scearce chipped in 14 points. Dial was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player, and McSwain and Scearce made the all-tournament team.\n\nThe victory marked the first men’s basketball state title for ABAC since Coach Gressette’s team won the 1949 crown. The Golden Stallions won only one other state men’s basketball title in 1982 when Coach Donnie Veal’s team beat Gainesville 67-66 in Gressette Gym. Both men’s basketball and women’s basketball were discontinued at ABAC after the 2008 season.\n\n“Tifton just fell in love with us,” Dial said in a 2015 interview. “Benny Dees was Bobby Knight before there was a Bobby Knight. We were just a bunch of old country boys with a crazy coach.”\n\nDial played at Waycross High School where he was selected for All-State and All-America honors where he lettered three years in baseball. He played in the North vs. South All-Star game and got scholarship offers from Florida State and North Carolina State. But he had a girlfriend in Waycross. Plus, who could resist the country boy charm of Benny Dees?\n\n“Benny had a persuasive way about him,” Dial said with a laugh. “He promised me a full ride scholarship to ABAC. Well, my full ride was that I had to get up every morning at 5 o’clock and go to the lunchroom to work. That was my scholarship. Seven of us stayed in a garage apartment. It was so cold in the winter we had to use electric blankets. ABAC built a new dorm before my sophomore year, and I was glad to live in it.”\n\nNicknamed “Rail” because he stretched 150 pounds over his 6-foot-3 frame, Dial carried over his stellar high school play into the college realm. He was named All-State in his freshman and sophomore seasons at ABAC as well as claiming All-District and All-America honors during his sophomore year.\n\n“It was quite a run,” Dial said. “The ABAC students went to the Army Surplus Store and bought a bunch of old helmets. Then they lined up like a platoon and marched in that old gym. It was crazy. They had metal trash cans with Coke bottles inside. You can’t imagine the noise in that place. We just won the town over. Benny was a coach that made you better than you were.”\n\nThe Stallions lost to Gulf Coast 85-82 in Tallahassee, Fla., in the first round of the 1964 regional tournament. Dial said Gulf Coast hit 41 of 52 free throws while the Stallions connected on 21 of 31 free throws. Dial had 12 points in that game. Dees was selected for the Hall of Fame in 2011, and Dial was a member of the Hall of Fame Class of 2015. The entire 1964 team was selected for the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. Team members present for the ceremony were Tommy Dial, Gwendell McSwain, Cook Holliday, Jake Popham, Russell Popham, Neal Joseph Tippens, Peter Dees, Tyron Spearman, Bill Mathis, and Jimmy Fountain. Jimmy Scearce and Ronnie Archer had passed away. J.E. Griffis and Maury Long were unable to attend the event.\n\n1967\n\nOn February 18, 1967, Coach Benny Dees’ Golden Stallions defeated the Oglethorpe University freshmen 73-72 in the first game ever in Gressette Gymnasium. The Stallions rolled up a season record of 29-5 record and a ranking of 13th in the nation in the 1966-67 campaign. The team set the ABAC record for most wins in a season. The losses included a 104-92 decision to the University of Georgia freshmen team and an 87-84 loss to the University of Florida freshmen team. ABAC was undefeated in league play during the regular season.\n\nABAC’s Dave Westerfield was named the top player in the Southern Division, barely edging his teammate, Keith Lawson, for the honor. In the quarterfinal round of the state tournament on February 23 in Statesboro, ABAC defeated Southern Tech 66-58 behind 19 points by Westerfield. The Golden Stallions then lost a 79-78 heartbreaker to South Georgia in the semifinal game of the tournament, despite 20 points by Lawson, 13 by John Norman and 10 by Westerfield. Dees resigned from ABAC later in 1967 to become the first basketball coach in the history of Virginia Commonwealth University. He was replaced as the ABAC coach by his assistant, Vann Brackin.\n\nUnder the direction of new head coach Norman “Red” Hill, ABAC fielded its first tennis team in 1967. The Golden Stallions finished third in the state tournament.\n\nTom Moody (Class of ’58) returned to ABAC as the head baseball coach in the summer of 1967. He replaced David Patton as the ABAC baseball coach. Moody played for the Stallions from 1956-58. “We practiced on a field where the big parking lot is now,” Moody said in a 2016 interview. “We played our games at Eve Park.” ABAC recruited the National Guard to help build a baseball field and tennis courts during Moody’s tenure.\n\n1968\n\nOdell Pack scored 29 points to lead the Golden Stallions to a 120-101 victory over North Florida Junior College in the 1968 Homecoming game. Harold Adkins scored 36 for the Stallions in a 126-122 loss to North Florida earlier in the year. He was named Georgia Junior College Player of the Week.\n\nThe 1968 basketball Stallions of Coach Vann Brackin wound up 12-14 overall after losing in the first round of the state tournament. Coach Tom Moody guided the ABAC baseball team to a 10-6 league record and 11-13 overall record in his first year as the head coach. Jerry Marshall from Dawson hit .312 to lead the way for ABAC.\n\nThe Golden Stallions’ 1968 tennis team of Coach Norman “Red” Hill won the state championship in its second year of existence. ABAC was ranked 10th in the nation. In an editorial, Danny Carter, sports editor of The Stallion, called for the college to construct new tennis courts since ABAC had a great program but played on the two concrete courts located west of Thrash Gymnasium. Tommy McDougal won 29 straight regular season tennis matches for the Stallions before losing on May 10 against Southern Tech. Coach Vann Brackin and the first organized ABAC golf team finished fourth in the state tournament.\n\n1969\n\nCoach Vann Brackin’s 1968-69 Golden Stallions rolled up a league record of 12-0 and an overall record of 25-5 on the basketball floor. ABAC lost only one home game all year, a 93-77 decision to Gardner Webb, led by its 7-foot-2 center Artis Gilmore. Odell Pack, Carlos McSwain, and Ashley Deloach were key players for the Stallions.\n\nDr. Raymond Busbee took over as coach in the ABAC golf team in 1969 and guided the Stallions to a state title and a finish of seventh in the nation. The ABAC tennis team of Coach Norman “Red” Hill won the 1969 state title and ranked sixth nationally. Coach Tom Moody’s 1969 baseball team won the southern division of the Georgia Junior College Conference with a 13-3 record. In the state tournament, ABAC lost a 20-inning game to the South Georgia Tigers, who finished third in the nation. The two best hitters on the ABAC team, Jerry Marshall and Buddy Whitley, both signed professional contracts with the Minnesota Twins organization.\n\n1970\n\nAfter the resignation of Vann Brackin, Lowell Mulkey was hired as the new ABAC basketball coach for the 1969-70 season. He was the athletics director, baseball coach, and basketball coach at Norman College for eight years prior to coming to ABAC.\n\nCoach Lowell Mulkey led the 1969-70 ABAC basketball team to a record of 19-11 and the Southern Division Championship. In the state tournament at Statesboro, the Stallions beat Southern Tech 78-73 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinal game, Mark Hall scored in the final second of overtime for a 77-75 ABAC win. The Stallions lost to Dalton in the championship game, 85-78. Tim Dominey from ABAC was named the Most Valuable Player of the state tournament, and Harley Stewart was named to the All-Tournament Team. Mark Hall set an all-time record during the regular season when he scored 64 points for ABAC in a 129-119 overtime victory for the Stallions over DeKalb Junior College.\n\nIn an 84-80 win over Brunswick in the regular season, Harley Stewart had 20 points and 27 rebounds for the Stallions. Stewart received the ABAC Athlete of the Year award and was named as Most Valuable Player for ABAC basketball. He was selected as part of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Region 17 All-Tournament First Team, the Georgia Junior College Athletic Association (GJCAA) First Team All-Tournament, and the GJCAA All-State Team.\n\n“On game nights, the local people would pack the gym,” Stewart said in a 2011 interview. “It was such a good atmosphere to play in. ABAC really embraced me and made me feel at home.” After completing his ABAC career, Stewart was recruited to West Georgia College, where he played in two national tournament games and averaged 24 points and 15 rebounds per game. During his time at West Georgia, the Braves won the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) District 25 Tournament and earned the college’s first trip to the NAIA national tournament. Stewart was inducted into the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 201l.\n\n1971\n\nThe ABAC golf team finished in eighth place in 1971 state tournament. The tennis team finished second in the state and second in the Alabama-Georgia regionals. The Stallions wound up 7-9 in conference play on the baseball field.\n\n1973\n\nThe Army Reserve and the Georgia National Guard used the ABAC campus in 1973 as a teaching station on large earth-moving equipment while saving ABAC over $100,000 in the development of the new athletic fields. Bids are now being accepted on the construction of the new ABAC tennis courts.\n\nFreshman Worth Hartry wound up the 1972-73 basketball season with an average of 23.1 points per game to go along with an average of 18.6 rebounds per contest. The 6-foot-5 player from Milledgeville was named All-State and All-Region for Coach Lowell Mulkey’s Golden Stallions. Hartry was named to the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. ABAC wound up 18-14 on the year and lost to Alexander City 78-74 in the first round of the NJCAA Region 17 tournament in Birmingham, Ala., on March 1.\n\nCoach Wayne Cooper’s golf team won the 1973 state title, finished second in the southeastern region, and wound up 11th in the nation. Cooper was named Coach of the Year in the state after his team compiled a 13-0 conference record. ABAC golfer Paul Staples was named to the All-America team, and Joe Corry was named to the All-State team. Coach Norman “Red” Hill’s men’s tennis team won the state title and finished fifth in the nation. Steve Pierre from Panama was named the top player in Georgia for the second straight year after compiling a record of 34-0. Edwardo Marulanda was an All-America selection for the Stallions at the national tennis tournament.\n\nCoach Ron Evans’ ABAC men’s soccer team ended its 1973 season with 2-5-1 record after a 4-0 loss to Dekalb in the first round of the state tournament. Baseball Coach Tom Moody said the Stallions have been hampered in preseason practice in 1973 because the baseball field has yet to be completed. Athletics Director Norman “Red” Hill said the new 12-court tennis complex at ABAC will open sometime in November as soon as the Board of Regents approve the finished product.\n\n1974\n\nABAC Basketball Coach Lowell Mulkey was named headmaster at Tiftarea Academy on January 23, 1974. He will continue to work for ABAC part-time until May 15. Athletics Director Norman Hill has announced that all intercollegiate sporting events between ABAC and Middle Georgia are suspended because of the actions of students from both colleges at the ABAC-Middle Georgia basketball game on the ABAC campus on January 23. Middle Georgia won the game 93-85 to leave the two teams in a tie for first place in the Southern Division of the Georgia Association of Junior Colleges.\n\nABAC President Clyde Driggers and Middle Georgia President Louis Alderman signed an agreement on February 7, 1974 to continue the athletic tradition between the two colleges, urging\n\ntrue sportsmanship on both sides for the game on February 14 in Cochran. Middle Georgia won the game 74-72. The Stallions ended their season in the first round of the state tournament in a 79-61 loss to Truett McConnell. Worth Hartry had 10 points for the Stallions in the final game of Coach Lowell Mulkey’s coaching career at ABAC.\n\nPeter Dees (Class of ’65) took over as head coach of the Stallions basketball team on March 25 upon the resignation of Lowell Mulkey.

ABAC piled up six runs in the top of the ninth inning in the championship game to take a 9-8 lead only to see number one-ranked Middle Georgia hit a pinch-hit home run with one man on base in the bottom of the ninth. In his excitement, the pinch hitter passed his teammate on the base paths and touched home plate before him. That move constituted the final out of the game and negated the two runs. Stallions win! “He was so excited that between third base and home plate, he passed the base runner,” Moody said. “I didn’t see it because I had gone to the mound to console my pitcher. Fortunately, the umpires had the courage to call it, and they did. It’s hard to describe how I felt. I couldn’t believe it.

Coach Tom Moody retired after the spring quarter.\n\n1997\n\nThe ABAC Rodeo Club hosted the fourth annual Peach State Stampede Rodeo on April 3-5. The ABAC intercollegiate rodeo team, coached by Jerry Lanier, is ranked fifth in the Ozark Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. The ABAC team is in its fifth year of competition.\n\nCoach Donna Campbell guided the Fillies to the state championship in their first year of fast-pitch softball. She was named Coach of the Year in Region XVII. ABAC lost in Eastern Regional tournament action in North Carolina.

Buddy Johnson is in his first year as the coach of the team.\n\nCoach Norman “Red” Hill coached in his 1,000th tennis match at ABAC on April 28 when the Stallions defeated Georgia Southwestern. In his 33 years at ABAC, Hill’s teams have won a national championship, 25 state titles, and more than 800 matches. This year’s team finished second in the state and third in the nation. Women’s tennis coach Alan Kramer became the youngest coach ever to receive the Wilson Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Coach of the Year award. Kramer’s Fillies have won five consecutive state titles and finished sixth in this year’s national tournament. He has a record of 77-32 at ABAC.\n\nThe Golden Fillies women’s volleyball team of Coach Alton Hudgins won the 1998 NJCAA Region XVII title over Middle Georgia on November 3 in Gressette Gym. Marty Moats was named Player of the Year. Katie Hudgins, Ali Martin, and Moats were named to the all-region team. Casey Long, Elaine Crawford, and Catherine Daniels were named to the all-region tournament team. The Fillies lost to Brevard in the District 10 tournament. ABAC dropped volleyball as an intercollegiate sport after this fourth and final season because only two teams in Georgia competed, ABAC and Middle Georgia. Women’s basketball will replace volleyball in the fall of 2000.\n\nRodeo Club President Chris Groskreutz has led the intercollegiate rodeo team to a third place ranking in the Ozark Region. He competes in steer wrestling and bull riding. Buddy Johnson is the rodeo team coach.\n\n1999\n\nCoach Donnie Veal was named Co-Coach of the Year in NJCAA Region XVII after leading the basketball Stallions to a 20-12 season and a third-place finish in the region tournament. He shared the honors with Georgia Perimeter’s Alfred Barney (Class of ’77).\n\nABAC intercollegiate rodeo team member Matthew Loignon attracts lots of attention when he saddles up Big Red and rides the 1,100-pound bull around the ABAC campus. Big Red was a huge hit in the Cattle Drive through downtown Tifton on March 13 which preceded this year’s Peach State Stampede Intercollegiate Rodeo on March 18-20.\n\nState Representative Jay Shaw (Class of ’68) presented a Georgia House of Representatives resolution to Norman “Red” Hill at a dinner on April 10 in honor of his many accomplishments as the ABAC tennis coach since 1965. A color rendering of the proposed Red Hill Athletic Complex was unveiled at the end of the evening.\n\nCoach Norman “Red” Hill won another national championship in men’s tennis for ABAC when his team captured the 1999 national crown on Hill’s last day at ABAC before retirement. Members of the team were Richard Crabtree from England, Gildardo Lobo from Venezuela, Nathan Lundy from England, Eric Von Hellens from Australia, Glenn Allsop from Australia,\n\nRajeev Rajapakse from Sri Lanka, and Richard Evans from England. The team was selected for the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nHill announced at the start of the 1998-99 academic year that he was retiring after the season. His players were well aware of that fact and wanted him to step into retirement in a grand style. “I knew we had a chance to win it but I knew playing Tyler in Tyler, Texas was going to be hard,” Hill said. “It was just one of the most fantastic things that ever happened to me. To go out that way, the kids really played hard for the school and for me.”\n\nHill said the regular season leading up to the national tournament was not a smooth ride. In fact, Evans, playing at number one singles, decided to give up on the Stallions and return to England during the spring break. “Then he called me and asked me if he could come back,” Hill said. “I told him he had to start at number seven and play his way back up the ladder. Eric played really well at number one after Richard left.”\n\nEvans did return and in a storybook ending, captured the most valuable player trophy at the national tournament. Hill remembers the volume of the Tyler crowd. “Sarge (Newell Dorsey) and I started rubbing empty tennis cans across the chain link fence every time we got a point to try to make some noise of our own,” Hill said.\n\nGood strategy. The Stallions won the championship, lifted Hill on their shoulders, and they all went to Outback Steakhouse to celebrate. When they got back to Tifton, members of the faculty, staff, and student body celebrated with the champions when their van pulled up in front of Tift Hall on May 21. Hill carried the Stallions to the national tournament for 34 consecutive years, an all-time record. He wound up with an overall record of 848 wins and 183 losses. He retired as the winningest men’s college tennis coach in America.\n\nCoach Alan Kramer led the 1999 ABAC women’s tennis team to a sixth straight NJCAA Region XVII title and a second place finish in the national tournament. Kramer called the team “the most talented women’s tennis team in the history of ABAC” when the team members were inducted into the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2015. The second place finish was the highest ever for a women’s tennis team at ABAC. Leading the way was Milena Stanoytcheva from Bulgaria. She won the national championship at number one singles, won Region XVII Tournament MVP honors, and was named first team All-America. Other team members were Annamaria Hodi from Hungary, Luciana Tamburini from Brazil, Nicola Sharp from Zimbabwe, Louise Holmvik from Sweden, and Georgians Amy Hopkins, Sabrina Harper, Casie Hodges, and Jodie Rayl.\n\nABAC retirees at the end of the spring term in 1999 included Coach Wayne Cooper (30 years) and Coach Norman Hill (34 years).\n\n2000\n\nCoach Donnie Veal led the basketball Stallions to a runner-up finish in the state tournament in Cochran on March 4 in his final season as coach before his retirement. Robert Moore, formerly an assistant at Columbus State, was named the new head men’s basketball coach.\n\nCoach Donna Campbell’s Fillies won the 2000 state softball title. The Fillies compiled a 16-3 conference record. During her five years as head coach, Campbell has won a slow pitch national championship and three state fast pitch titles. Coach Steve Janousek’s baseball team compiled a 31-20 record and finished fourth in the state tournament.\n\nMilena Stanoycheva from Bulgaria became the first female tennis player in the history of ABAC to win back-to-back national championships at number one singles at the NJCAA women’s national tennis tournament. She has signed a scholarship offer from Clemson University.\n\nStanoycheva was selected for posthumous induction into the inaugural ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame class in 2008. The Fillies of Coach Alan Kramer won their seventh consecutive state title and wound up fourth in the national tournament. Men’s tennis coach Jeff Kutac led the Stallions to a runner-up finish in the state tournament and a sixth-place finish in the national tournament. After the season, Kramer was selected to replace Kutac as the men’s coach, and Margaret Treadway was named the new women’s tennis coach. Treadway played for the Fillies in 1995, earning All-America honors.\n\nABAC brought back its women’s basketball program after a 15-year absence in August. Tifton native Julie Conner was named head coach.\n\n2001\n\nLuiza Biktyakova, a freshman physical education major from Uzbekistan, won the national championship at #2 singles for the 2001 ABAC women’s tennis team. She finished the year 24-0 and was named to the NJCAA All-America team. Biktyakova teamed with Natalie Drabova for a 24-1 record playing doubles. They won the national title at #1 doubles. Coach Margaret Treadway’s Fillies finished fifth in the nation in the team competition. Biktyakova was named to the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nCoach Donna Campbell’s Fillies won the 2001 state softball title and finished fifth in the national tournament. The Fillies were 33-21 overall and 18-1 in conference play. Freshman pitcher Jackie Moore from Columbus rolled up a 21-9 record with 142 strikeouts and an earned run average of 1.63.\n\n“Jackie was one of those players who was totally selfless to the core,” Campbell said. “She was a hard worker on and off the field, and she loved ABAC softball. What made Jackie so special was her ability to keep her emotions under control. Her physical attributes and her work ethic made her a great college pitcher but what separated her from the rest was her tenacious competitiveness, her humbleness, and her cool demeanor.”\n\nCoach Alan Kramer’s Stallions finished second in the state tennis tournament and seventh in the national tournament. The baseball Stallions of Coach Steve Janousek finished third in the state tournament.\n\n2002\n\nThe ABAC Foundation received the $1 million Forest Lakes Golf Club as a gift from Tifton ophthalmologist Larry Moorman and his wife, Debra, in January. The college operates the golf course as a public course but also uses it as a teaching laboratory for students in a variety of majors.\n\nOn March 2, the Fillies’ basketball team won the NJCAA Region XVII title for only the second women’s state basketball championship in the history of ABAC. The first came in 1984. In the tournament at Atlanta Metropolitan College, Coach Julie Conner’s Fillies defeated Georgia Perimeter 61-59, Middle Georgia 48-44, and then beat Atlanta Metro 76-72 in the title game. Chelsie Miller was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player, and Jasmin Lee was named to the All-Tournament team. The Fillies lost the national tournament playoff game on March 9 to Louisburg (N.C.) in Gressette Gym to end their season with a 16-16 record. It is the only women’s national tournament basketball game involving the Fillies ever played on the ABAC campus. Coach Robert Moore’s men’s basketball team compiled a record of 21-9 and lost in the first round of the state tournament. Rashad Williams and Eric Williams were named to the all-region first team.\n\nCoach Alan Kramer’s men’s tennis team won the state championship and finished second in the national tournament.

Luiza Bitzyakova was the state tournament MVP, and Hudgins was named Coach of the Year.\n\nThe women’s softball team of Coach Donna Campbell won the state championship for the third straight year and wound up ninth in the nation with a record of 31-25. Sophomore pitcher Jackie Moore was the MVP of the state tournament. Moore struck out 219 batters on the way to a 20-12 record and a microscopic 0.67 earned run average.\n\n“When I went to the mound, I never had a particular routine or process,” Moore said in a 2016 interview. “I have always been one to take life moment by moment, pitch by pitch. I try to live in the moment and make adjustments when necessary.”\n\nAt the 2002 national tournament, Moore pitched a perfect game, the only one of her storied career that began when she rolled up a 43-24 record at Jordan High School in Columbus. “That was a very cool experience to pitch a perfect game, particularly since I had never had one before,” Moore said. “My grandfather was there to see me.”\n\nAfter becoming the winningest pitcher in ABAC history, Moore signed with the University of West Florida. She dazzled the NCAA Division II Gulf South Conference foes with a record of 20-4 as a junior and again with a 20-13 mark as a senior for the Argonauts. “I will never forget the camaraderie and all the friends I made at ABAC,” Moore said. “Most importantly, I’m so blessed to have had a chance to play for and be coached by Donna Campbell. She is an amazing person who I respect and appreciate so much. She coached selflessly and knew how to balance athletics and academics.” Moore was selected as a member of the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nCoach Steve Janousek’s baseball team had a record of 27-26 and lost in the first round of the 2002 state tournament. Lorrie Morgan was the featured entertainer at Dollars for ABAC Scholars on May 31.\n\nOn August 27, ABAC held a ceremony to announce the opening of the $1 million Red Hill Athletic Center in honor of legendary tennis coach Norman “Red” Hill.\n\n2003\n\nOn April 19, Coach Alton Hudgins’ Fillies’ tennis team won its 10th straight state title. Ingrid Ebensperger was the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. The Fillies finished fifth in the national tournament. Coach Donna Campbell’s softball team wound up 29-23 overall and finished second in the state tournament. The baseball team of Coach Steve Janousek finished 20-25.\n\nFormer Valdosta State assistant coach Todd Sheppard was named the men’s basketball coach at ABAC in July. He replaced Robert Moore, who became the head coach at Tift County High School.\n\nPresident Mike Vollmer was on the floor for the faculty team at the Moonlight Mania basketball event on September 29 in Gressette Gym.\n\n2004\n\nLaVeasey Carter from Tifton became the first All-America selection in Coach Steve Janousek’s tenure as the ABAC baseball coach.

He was named NJCAA Second Team All-America.\n\n2005\n\nIn her first pageant ever, Melissa Maher, an animal science major from Snellville, was selected as Ms. ABAC 2006 on November 8. She is president of the ABAC Rodeo Club and a barrel racer on the ABAC intercollegiate rodeo team.\n\n2006\n\nThe ABAC women’s tennis team finished in a tie for 12th place at the NJCAA national tournament in Tucson.

Hamilton Complex on August 26 to signal the opening of the first ever women’s intercollegiate soccer season at ABAC. Under the direction of Coach Jimmy Ballenger, the Fillies recorded a record of 9-5-1.\n\nThere’s no question that two-time International Tennis Association Player of the Year Paul Fitzgerald left his mark on the tennis program at ABAC. The gregarious Irishman from Cork also left fragments from his two front teeth on a certain light pole in Fort Myers, Fla., on Friday, October 13th.\n\n“While playing doubles late that Friday afternoon, Paul chased an overhead and ran face first into a light pole off the court,” Coach Alan Kramer remembered. “He was out for a minute, and you couldn’t hear a sound across that whole tennis complex. The ambulance came, and we got him to the hospital. All the time we were there in the hospital he was begging the nurse to release him so he could play for the ITA singles’ championship on Saturday. Her boyfriend was a hockey player so she told Paul she would see what she could do. The doctor did release him but told Paul he wouldn’t feel like playing. Boy, was he wrong.”\n\nWithout even warming up, Fitzgerald played in the 8 a.m. match on October 14th and upset the top seed in a three-hour and seven-minute match to win the title. “I have never seen anything like it,” Kramer said. “He had a bloody towel that he used after every point. He said his dad was a boxer in Ireland so he was used to the blood. I guess it was as close to a UFC cage match as you could get in tennis.”\n\n“At first I didn’t think there would be any way that I could play,” Fitzgerald told a newspaper reporter later that day. “I started to feel better a couple of hours after getting to the hospital. When he said I was okay to play, I thought I might as well give it a shot.”\n\n“Paul inspired others that day in Fort Myers,” Kramer said. “From then on, he was a legend as the word traveled fast about the unbelievable situation. You would not believe how many followers he had at random tennis matches the next couple of years.”\n\nOn November 30, the groundbreaking ceremony for the soccer field/intramural fields’ project was held. A helicopter loaded with soccer balls flew over the ABAC intramural field and Public Relations Administrative Associate Pam Leonard pushed out the balls to signal the beginning of the groundbreaking on the $1 million first phase of the project.\n\n2007\n\nUnder the direction of Coach Todd Sheppard, the men’s basketball team at ABAC rolled up a magnificent 27-5 record during the 2006-2007 season. Led by first team all-conference performers Leon Buchanan and Brandon Shingles, the team was ranked as high as ninth in the national poll during the season. The Stallions lost in the state title game to Georgia Perimeter 103-85, after losing to the Jaguars twice during the regular season. Sheppard was named Coach of the Year in the league and was also named the coach for a group of two-year college all-stars as a part of the NCAA Final Four event in Atlanta on April 1.\n\nA group of ABAC students called “The Rowdies” supported the team throughout the year by painting their faces green and gold and turning out in force for the home games and the road game at Cochran against Middle Georgia. Their favorite entrance was to beat loudly on the north doors of Gressette Gym while the Stallions were warming up. Then they entered the arena with two students cracking their bullwhips. It was quite a sight, especially for the opposing team.\n\nCoach Julie Conner’s basketball Fillies wound up with a 20-8 overall record and lost in the semifinal round of the state tournament to Darton 64-52. Turrelle Jones was named first team all-conference. The Fillies have accumulated 103 victories in Conner’s seven years as the head coach. Bob Gressette (Class of ’57), son of legendary ABAC Coach Bruce Gressette, presented copies of his new book, A History of ABAC Stallion Basketball: 1933-1956, to the college in February.\n\nABAC alumnus Thomas “Boo” Weekley (Class of ’93) won the Verizon Heritage golf tournament at Hilton Head Island on April 16 for his first PGA victory. He won $972,000. He played for Coach Tom Moody at ABAC.\n\n“Boo was a good golfer and had a lot of athletic ability,” Moody said. “I knew he had the potential to do well but sometimes it takes more than ability to play professionally. I’m very happy for him. He was a country boy and his parents were hard working people who supported their son.”\n\nCoach Alan Kramer’s women’s tennis team won its 14th straight state title on the way to an 11th place finish in the national tournament. Kramer was named Coach of the Year in the state and then was selected NJCAA National Women’s Coach of the Year for the second time in his 14-year career at ABAC. He also received the honor in 1998. Kedi Magakgala from ABAC was the Region XVII tournament’s Most Valuable Player.\n\nKramer’s men’s tennis team wound up sixth in the national tournament after winning the NJCAA Region XVII tournament behind the heroics of Most Valuable Player Paul Fitzgerald, who was later named NJCAA National Rookie of the Year. Fitzgerald and Derick Danziger were named to the All-America team.\n\nABAC baseball player Ty Wright was named to the 2007 NJCAA first team All-America squad. He was also named Player of the Year in NJCAA Region XVII. Wright hit .407 with 49 runs scored. He also had 83 hits, 19 doubles, eight home runs and 48 runs batted in. The sophomore biology major from Montrose hit .314 in his freshman campaign. Wright hit two grand slams in a 16-12 ABAC win over George Wallace Community College. Coach Steve Janousek’s Stallions wound up 24-34. “I was seeing the ball really good that year,” Wright said in a 2016 interview. “I felt a lot more comfortable at the plate, and Coach J had more confidence in me as one of the leaders of that team.”\n\nWright was planning to play college football after graduating from West Laurens High School where he was a two-time all-region football pick and was selected all-state his senior year. But after clobbering 10 home runs and recording a .522 batting average to set all-time records his senior year on the diamond, Wright decided baseball would be his ticket to a college education. He was all-region on two occasions and all-state in baseball as well.\n\n“ABAC was the last place I tried out, and I decided to go there,” Wright said. “Academically it was a lot tougher than some schools. I was a biology major, and my science classes were more difficult there than anywhere else I went.” Janousek lauded Wright for making a name for himself in the classroom as well with a 3.33 grade point average.\n\nAfter his ABAC career was over, Wright walked on at Georgia Southern where he earned “Faces in the Crowd” recognition from Sports Illustrated for hitting for the cycle in four consecutive innings against Wofford. He singled in the first inning, slammed a two-run home run off the scoreboard in the second inning, belted a triple in the third inning, and slapped a two-run double in the fourth inning. Wright spent two years at Georgia Southern and was a second team All-America selection. He earned a spot in the San Diego Padres organization for two years before a knee injury ended his playing days. Wright was named to the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nCoach Herb Hendrix’s golf team finished second in the 2007 state tournament. The ABAC golfers were ranked seventh in the nation.\n\nThe dedication ceremony for the new soccer field was held on August 28 when the Fillies cut the ribbon on a gorgeous new field on the ABAC campus. The team then defeated Georgia Military College 3-0 in the first home game ever for women’s soccer at ABAC. ABAC finished the year with a record of 9-6-1.\n\nMen’s basketball coach Todd Sheppard was the fall commencement speaker on December 13.\n\n2008\n\nSix legends from the ABAC athletics program were recognized and presented crystal stallions between games of the ABAC-South Georgia Tech basketball matchups in Gressette Gym on February 21. Named to the first Hall of Fame were Orion Mitchell, Bruce Gressette, Thomas Cheney, Phillip Simpson, Norman “Red” Hill, and Milena Stanoytcheva. Mitchell, Gressette, Cheney, and Stanoytcheva were named to the Hall posthumously. The state runner-up team from 1958 was also recognized at halftime of the men’s game that evening.\n\nSam Goodman was named first team All-Conference for the basketball Stallions who finished with a record of 17-14. In his five years as the coach, Coach Todd Sheppard’s Stallions are 93-64. Coach Julie Conner’s Fillies slid to a record of 11-19 this season. Both teams lost in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament.\n\nCoach Alan Kramer and the Fillies’ tennis team won their 15th consecutive state title behind the outstanding play of Monika Lalewicz, who went on to win the national championship at #1 singles. The Fillies finished fourth in the national tournament. Lalewicz, a freshman from Mississaugh, Canada, was named the NJCAA Player of the Year. She was selected for the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nThe Stallions’ Paul Fitzgerald was named men’s NJCAA Player of the Year. Fitzgerald, a native of Cork, Ireland, led the Stallions to a third-place finish in the national tournament. Fitzgerald was named the Most Valuable Player of the Region XVII tournament for the second straight year when he led the Stallions to back to back state championships. He finished third in singles in the national tournament and earned a scholarship to Armstrong State University where he was a member of the 2009 NCAA Division II national championship team. Fitzgerald was selected as a member of the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nThe 2008 ABAC baseball team wound up 28-28, and the 2008 softball team was 27-22.\n\nABAC began the 2008-09 academic year on July 1 with the news of a statewide five per cent budget cut, amounting to almost $900,000 for the College. ABAC’s first response to the cut was leaving vacant positions unfilled. Two of those unfilled spots belonged to the two basketball coaches since Todd Sheppard has resigned to go into the business world, and Julie Conner has resigned to take the head girls’ basketball job at Tift County High School. Sheppard was the men’s coach for five years, and Conner was the women’s coach for eight years. President David Bridges announced on July 14 that ABAC was dropping both its men’s and women’s basketball programs.\n\n“The final decision and its timing were made because of three reasons,” Bridges said. “Eliminating two of the eight intercollegiate athletic programs provided much needed financial relief for the remaining programs, without coaches we couldn’t run a program, and by not filling the two positions we could maintain the flexibility to fill higher priority academic positions and meet forthcoming budget cuts.”\n\nThat left ABAC with six intercollegiate sports including soccer, softball and tennis for women, and baseball, golf, and tennis for the men.\n\nAlumnus Thomas “Boo” Weekley (Class of ’93), a professional golfer on the PGA Tour, helped lead the United States to victory in the Ryder Cup matches. He later donated $30,000 to the college through the Play Golf America University.\n\nKatrina Duncan-Marshalleck scored an all-time record of 26 goals for the Fillies’ soccer team, which finished with a best ever record of 13-6 in the 2008 season. Duncan-Marshalleck was selected for the ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\n2009\n\nThe second annual ABAC Athletics Hall of Fame event was held on February 13 when Ellen Vickers, Newell “Sarge” Dorsey, Cook Holliday, P.W. Bryan, Jr., Dorsey Brooks, and the national championship men’s tennis team of 1984 were inducted in an impressive ceremony in the Grand Lobby of ABAC Lakeside. The inductees were then recognized on the tennis court during an ABAC tennis match.\n\nTifton ophthalmologist Larry Moorman and his wife, Debra, donated the clubhouse at Forest Lakes Golf Club to the ABAC Foundation in March to complete the gift they started in 2002 with the donation of the nine-hole Forest Lakes Golf Club.\n\nCoach Alan Kramer’s Fillies won their 16th consecutive NJCAA Region XVII women’s tennis title at the Red Hill Athletic Center on April 25. The Stallions also captured the Region XVII crown behind the play of MVP Rasid Winklaar. ABAC’s Monika Lalewicz from Mississaugh, Canada was the MVP for the women for the second year in a row. Lalewicz finished second in the national tournament at #1 singles and received National Player of the Year honors for the second consecutive year. She was trying to become the first women’s player at ABAC\n\nback-to-back national titles since Milena Stanoytcheva in 1999-2000. Matt Holland from Cochran won the national championship at #6 singles for the Stallions. The Stallions finished third in the team standings.

She was perhaps best known as the director for the Fabulous Golddusters precision dance team for 26 years. The Golddusters performed all over Georgia, Florida, and Alabama on behalf of the college. They got their start by performing at halftime of ABAC basketball games. Under the leadership of Willis, the Golddusters danced annually at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition, at high school student recruitment shows, and at community festivals.
