        "text": "I’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. Hope I didn’t forget anybody…\n\n* * *\n\nChris Evert [USA]\n\nBorn: 21 December 1954\n\nCareer: 1970-89\n\nPlays: Right-handed (two-handed backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1975)\n\nPeak Elo rating: 2,451 (1st place, 1976)\n\nMajor singles titles: 18\n\nTotal singles titles: 157\n\n* * *\n\nChris Evert always had a game plan. More than perhaps any player before or since, she stuck with it.\n\nIn the 1986 French Open final, she met Martina Navratilova for the 69th time. Navratilova had taken the upper hand in the rivalry, winning 19 of 21 meetings in a span of three-and-a-half years. At least Evert still had an edge on clay. She was the defending champion in Paris. Navratilova had won the French title in 1984, but that was the outlier. Neither woman would ever forget a 1981 match on Florida dirt that Chrissie won 6-0, 6-0.\n\nThe trick was to pin Martina to the baseline and force her to hit backhands. It was no secret: Navratilova’s one-hander had improved enormously, but it was still her more fragile side. No one could expose a weakness like Evert. She would spend all day searching for cracks in her opponent’s backhand, if that’s what it took.\n\n“Chris played points like a siege war during the Middle Ages,” said long-time tour player Julie Heldman.\n\nThat day in Paris, Evert slowly battered her rival into submission. On one point, she hit 15 consecutive shots to the Navratilova backhand. Over the entire match, she hit 77% of her forehands cross-court. Not simply in the general direction of Martina’s left-handed backhand–into the corner to force a backhand reply.\n\nChrissie so nullified Navratilova’s game that the final winner tally was in her favor. Evert, the conservative baseliner, hit 31 winners. Martina, the frenetic serve-and-volleyer, managed only 29.\n\nThe 31-year-old American won the match, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. With it, she secured her 18th and final career major title.\n\nEvert played three more years after that. Even in her declining years, only a handful of women survived the siege. She reached eight semi-finals in her final eleven majors. In her last seven matches as a pro, she defeated three members of the Tennis 128: Conchita Martínez, Jana Novotná, and a young Monica Seles. Nearly two decades after she first rocked Forest Hills as a 16-year-old sensation, the game plan still worked.\n\n* * *\n\nEvert’s legacy will forever be tied up with Navratilova. The two women are roughly the same age, and they towered over the first 15 years of the WTA tour like no other duo. They played each other 80 times, 14 of them in major finals.\n\nChrissie does well by the comparison. Martina is unquestionably one of the very best of all time, and they roughly split their record-setting number of encounters. Both women collected 18 major singles titles. The netrushing lefty posted more than her share of winning streaks and near-undefeated seasons, but it was Chris who went nearly six years without a loss on clay, a stretch of 125 matches.\n\nViewing Evert through the prism of the rivalry, though, misses the point. Martina was an outstanding player by 1975, the year she defected from Czechoslovakia. The two women met eleven times that year, five of them in finals. But Navratilova didn’t draw even with the American until the summer of 1978, and it took another year for her to pull ahead.\n\nChrissie reigned over a crowded field. Between 1971 and 1979, she also grappled with Billie Jean King, Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong, and–at the end of that span–a young Tracy Austin. She struggled against Nancy Richey, a veteran baseliner who did everything the youngster did, only a bit better.\n\nEvert held off those rivals, and in the process, she came to define the sport. She arrived at the 1971 US Open as an unknown in pigtails, a 16-year-old clay-courter getting her first taste of the big time. She saved six match points in the second round to upset Mary Ann Eisel, then advanced to the semis on the back of wins against Françoise Dürr and Lesley Hunt. Billie Jean stopped her there, but it took an inspired performance and all the veteran wiles King had accumulated in more than a decade on the circuit.\n\nThe fans fell in love immediately. She was “Little Miss Sunshine,” “Cinderella in Sneakers.” Fellow players weren’t so sure. Chrissie seemed standoffish, and she had a bad habit of beating her elders.\n\nOne star had no doubts at all. Billie Jean knew that she couldn’t lose to the newcomer–it would make her entire fledgling Virginia Slims tour look bad. But she also recognized that the unsmiling girl from Florida held the future in the palm of her hand. “That kid is our next superstar!” King said. “She’s the one! She is it!”\n\n* * *\n\nThe Evert game was based on rock-solid groundstrokes, including a two-handed backhand that launched a million imitations.\n\nChrissie wasn’t the first player on tour with a double-hander; Peaches Bartkowicz and Australian standout Jan Lehane O’Neill got there first. But Evert was the woman who proved it could be a devastating weapon, more than just a stopgap for little girls who weren’t strong enough to hold the racket with one hand. It didn’t hurt that Björn Borg and Jimmy Connors came along at the same time to drive the message home.\n\nEvert’s groundstrokes, in turn, were based on unshakeable fundamentals. Chris’s father Jimmy was a national-level competitor turned coach. He began teaching Chrissie when she was six years old. He believed in the basics: feet set, racket back, follow through. There was more to it than that, but when things went off course, he always went back to square one.\n\nYou can see the legacy of Jimmy Evert in any match video or highlight reel from Chrissie’s career. She’s always in position. She’s always ready. We often hear players talk about the game slowing down for them; with Evert, you can watch as she plays a more relaxed brand of tennis than the woman on the other side of the net. Only Navratilova could consistently rush her, and that was far in the future.\n\nThe result of that impeccable preparation is that Chris could do whatever she wanted with the ball. Herbert Warren Wind wrote in a 1986 profile:\n\nShe reminds one of a frontiersman sighting down the barrel of his rifle at a distant object when she fastens her eye on the approaching ball for what seems like several full seconds before hitting it in the center of her racquet and drilling it back over the net.\n\nShe picked a spot, and she rarely missed. Against a netrusher, she painted the lines. One journalist wrote in 1975, “It seems that Evert’s ground strokes land only within a two-foot-wide strip on either side of the court.” Facing a fellow baseliner, she nudged her opponent out of position, an inch at a time if necessary.\n\nEvert’s precision was so ingrained that she didn’t understand it when other players couldn’t do the same. No one wanted to practice with her–they were “petrified,” to use Billie Jean’s word. She would ask a sparring partner to feed her balls in some particular spot. When the human inevitably proved inferior to a ball machine, Chrissie would just glare.\n\nNo one could glare like Chris Evert.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen the public got to know Chrissie a little better, the love affair cooled. The other thing Jimmy Evert taught his daughter was to keep her emotions in check. She didn’t throw tantrums or even berate herself aloud. A bad line call elicited a raised eyebrow, at most.\n\nChris’s imperturbability kept fans at a distance. It also led to a new set of nicknames: “Little Miss Poker Face,” “Ice Maiden,” and “Little Miss Metronome.”\n\nIf you haven’t noticed already, there’s more than a passing resemblance between Evert and the player right behind her on my list, Helen Wills. A half-century earlier, Wills was the original Poker Face; others called her the Ice Queen. Opponents said that facing her was like playing a machine. Both women set fashion trends and graced the covers of national magazines.\n\nEvert, like her predecessor, was as strong between the ears as she was in the right arm. “Concentrating was just something I always had,” Chrissie told biographer Johnette Howard. “On every point.”\n\nVirginia Wade faced Evert more often than anyone else save Navratilova. She won just 6 of 46 meetings. “Her mind is what made her great,” said Wade.\n\nFans can learn to admire a strong mind, but they only fall in love when an idol shows a glimpse of underlying humanity, some sign of weakness. Starting in 1973, there wasn’t much of that. Evert won ten titles as a 19-year-old and handed Margaret Court her only defeat that year at a major. From 1974 to 1978, she was even better. She won at least 93% of her matches in each of those five campaigns, including two French Opens, two Wimbledons, and four straight US Opens.\n\nEvert, understandably, got sick of having the crowd against her for every match. Abroad, fans backed their own. At home, well, Americans love an underdog. Between 1972 and 1980, she played 24 finals against Evonne Goolagong, whose unpredictability charmed the fans that Evert left cold.\n\nWhile it wasn’t ideal, Chrissie could always play for herself. In 1976, perhaps her best season of all, Sports Illustrated asked her what appealed to her so much about tennis. “The winning,” she said. “I always liked the winning.”\n\n* * *\n\nEvert never stopped the winning. She picked up at least one grand slam singles title every year from 1974 to 1986, an unbelievable 13 straight seasons. But the victories did slow down a bit.\n\nTed Tinling, the dress designer who spent six decades around women’s tennis, said in 1981, “A woman champion is hard-pressed to survive more than six years.” He even pointed to Wills as an example of a superstar who faded. Chrissie would charge through that barrier, but in the late 1970s, right around that six-year mark, she hit some bumps.\n\nStruggling after a loss to Wade at Wimbledon in 1977, Evert took a four-month sabbatical before rejoining the tour in March 1978. She took another break in early 1980, dealing with both a new crop of contenders and the challenge of mixing a full-time tennis career with her recent marriage to British player John Lloyd.\n\nThe main problem, on court, was Tracy Austin. Evert faced her teenage clone five times in 1979 and beat her only once. One of those losses ended the 125-match clay court winning streak. Another prevented her from picking up her fifth straight US Open title. Austin’s steadiness tested even Chrissie’s patience. One reporter claimed that the two women slogged through 28 strokes per point for an entire match. I’m pretty sure that’s wrong, but the Match Charting Project has documented that the average rally length of the 1979 US Open final exceeded nine shots. That’s long enough to make most people question their career choices.\n\nAt the same time, Navratilova was getting better. Martina lost weight, put the stress of defection and statelessness behind her, and developed an increasingly sturdy backhand. Evert lost the Wimbledon final to the lefty in both 1978 and 1979.\n\nEarly in her career, Evert often said that she imagined herself playing for only a few years before settling down and having a family. The more titles she won, the murkier that timetable became. But when Chris left the tour in 1980, it wasn’t entirely clear she’d be coming back.\n\n* * *\n\nWe know now that Evert’s career was only half over. Not only did she return, she lost only three matches between May and November. She won the 1980 French Open–her fourth–and beat Austin en route to a US Open crown as well.\n\nShe didn’t lose on clay all year. Her 125-match win streak between 1973 and 1979 is the headline number, but even more impressive to me is what came next. After losing to Austin at the 1979 Italian, Chrissie won another 64 in a row.\n\nAustin got hurt, and her career was essentially finished. Andrea Jaeger briefly arose as a challenger–she beat Chris at Roland Garros in 1982–but her body didn’t hold up, either. A new crop of starlets was only a few years away, but in the meantime, it was the Chrissie and Martina show. In 1984, Navratilova went 78-2. Evert’s more modest mark of 75-8 was deceptive: six of her eight losses were to Martina.\n\nChris eventually got her rival back in her sights. She regained the number one position on the WTA computer in mid-1985, though my Elo ratings insist that Martina never gave up the prime spot between 1982 and early 1987. Evert picked up her last two French Open titles against Navratilova in 1985 and 1986 and added four more victories against the lefty in the two years after that. When Chrissie retired in mid-1989, she remained among the top four on the official ranking list.\n\nGradually, through bumpy years on and off the court–not to mention an unfathomable ten runner-up finishes to Navratilova at majors–the tennis world learned to look past the ice. Fellow players had long known that the champion had a wicked sense of humor. That side of her finally–if only occasionally–popped out in public.\n\nMost of all, after nearly two decades in the spotlight, Evert’s strongest qualities were recognized for what they had always been. Emotionlessness sounds bad, if you put it like that. Call it implacability, and you start to understand how she won so many matches, for so many years.\n\nThere’s another near-synonym for the quality that her father drummed into her: dignity. Ted Tinling called Chris “the most gracious world champion I’ve ever seen.”\n\nIn 1976, named Sportswoman of the Year by Sports Illustrated, Evert admitted her game wasn’t yet perfect. But: “Mentally I don’t think I could get much tougher. I’d just crack.” While she might not have ever gotten any tougher, the nerves of steel kept her going for twelve more years. There were a couple of ripples, but she never did crack.\n\n* * *\n\nPrevious: No. 10, Helen Wills\n\nNext: No. 8, Rafael Nadal\n\nSubscribe to the blog to receive each new post by email:\n\nI’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. Hope I didn’t forget anybody…\n\n* * *\n\nHelen Wills [USA]\n\nBorn: 6 October 1905\n\nDied: 1 January 1998\n\nCareer: 1920-38\n\nPlayed: Right-handed (one-handed backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1927)\n\nMajor singles titles: 19\n\nTotal singles titles: 56\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Helen Wills lost the Match of the Century to Suzanne Lenglen in February 1926, she was not the best player in the world. Her supporters had clamored for a Wills-Lenglen showdown for years, back to 1924, when Helen traveled to Europe for Wimbledon and the Olympics. Lenglen pulled out of both events, leading some fans to believe that the French champion was afraid of her American challenger.\n\nThere was plenty for fear in Wills’s game. Even in 1924, when Helen was 18 years old, she probably hit harder than any other woman alive. While it’s possible that Molla Mallory had a stronger forehand, Wills wielded weapons on both wings. Helen finished runner-up in her first Wimbledon, to Kitty McKane, but she won the Olympic gold with ease. She dropped only sixteen games in four matches, including a routine defeat of Mallory.\n\nWhen Lenglen and Wills finally met at Cannes, the veteran triumphed. Suzanne was steadier, and she was much the better mover. Helen’s edge in power, on its own, wasn’t enough. Years later, Lenglen said that no opponent could hurry her enough to miss into the net–“except Helen Wills a little.” The 6-3, 8-6 result revealed that Suzanne was the superior competitor, even as the gap between the two was shrinking.\n\nWills, for her part, was ready for another crack at the champion right away. “I am sorry Miss Lenglen has gone off to Italy,” she let slip to a reporter. “Don’t you feel she should have given me a return match here?”\n\nThe two women never played each other again. Wills withdrew from both Roland Garros and Wimbledon with appendicitis, and Lenglen turned professional later that year.\n\nWe’ll never know how the Frenchwoman would have handled the steadily improving Helen. Suzanne desperately wanted a chance to prove she remained the best, but Wills had no desire to turn pro, despite offers that reportedly reached $100,000–about $1.6 million in today’s dollars. The American amateur tennis authorities jealously guarded their turf; they weren’t about to sanction a match against a professional.\n\nWills had her weaknesses, some of which she never overcame. We’ll get to those in a minute. But there’s no doubt she became a better player than the version that lost to Lenglen. One of her practice partners said she was “50% better” in 1928 than she had been the year before.\n\nWithout Lenglen, the ever-stronger American had no competition. She won 16 of the 17 majors she entered between 1927 and the end of her career. She won 180 matches in a row in the first six years of that span, going much of the streak without dropping a set. She grabbed the number one ranking the moment Suzanne departed, and she never let go.\n\n* * *\n\nSuperficially, the keys to the Wills game were her groundstrokes, particularly her forehand. Opponent weren’t accustomed to the pace, and few of them could keep up.\n\nAnna Harper was the runner-up for the 1930 US national title, and she lost all five of her career meetings to her fellow Californian. “Those shots of hers, coming one after another after another without relief,” she said, “well, after a game or two when you found out how hard this was going to be, she either broke your confidence or she broke your arm.”\n\nIn 1927, the New Yorker described the Wills forehand as “plain ruination, so utterly drastic as to reduce her opponent’s assignment to the mere task of signalling hits and misses.”\n\nHelen herself had no problem with pace. Like Lenglen, she preferred to practice with men. She prepared for her 1924 European trip by sparring with some of the best, including two-time national champion Bill Johnston. They peppered her with the hardest shots they could muster. She usually got them back, and she occasionally won practice sets, as well.\n\nOnly one woman in the 1920s could withstand the onslaught: Spanish star Lilí de Álvarez. Their 1927 Wimbledon final was a non-stop fireworks display. Bill Tilden thought he’d never seen women hit the ball so hard. Álvarez reached 4-all in the second set, when the contenders gutted out a 40-stroke rally. Both women doubled over, leaning on their rackets for support. Only Wills recovered. Álvarez didn’t win another point.\n\nMost women never dreamed of making it to 4-all. Lenglen didn’t hit as hard, and she would sometimes toy with opponents to give the crowd a better show. Wills was all business. At the 1927 Wimbledon warm-up in Beckenham, she beat the South African Billie Tapscott in 18 minutes. She then disposed of Mallory in 23.\n\nAt a North American tournament the same year, she needed only 34 minutes to win the final against Helen Jacobs. It helped that she won the first 20 points in a row. I ran across one match report of a landslide that Wills polished off in 14 minutes.\n\nJohn Tunis called Wills “a mechanical marvel reducing her adversaries to sawdust in as short a time as possible, asking no quarter and giving none.”\n\n“To play Helen Wills,” wrote Jacobs, “was to play a machine.”\n\n* * *\n\nJacobs knew that mechanics weren’t the whole story. In her chapter-length review of Wills’s career, she used the word “concentration” five times:\n\nHelen Wills fought on the court much as Gene Tunney fought in the ring–with implacable concentration and undeniable skill, but without the color or imagination of a Dempsey or a Lenglen.\n\nHer mantra on court was “every stroke, every stroke, every stroke.” After a bit of sociability early in her career, she rarely spoke to opponents. She smiled even less often.\n\n“When she steps on a tennis court,” said her childhood coach William “Pop” Fuller, “all but the game ceases to exist.”\n\nEd Sullivan (yes, that Ed Sullivan) gave her a nickname in 1922: “Little Poker Face.”* It was later expanded to “Little Miss Poker Face.” She also gained another, less charitable moniker: “The Ice Queen.” Wills didn’t object. “I considered it a compliment because composure is the greatest asset you can have in sports,” she said in 1952. “If I hadn’t naturally possessed such intense concentration I would have tried to cultivate it.”\n\n* The coinage is sometimes credited to Grantland Rice. I think Sullivan got there first. But Rice made all the same observations. 16-year-old Helen was “intensely serious, unemotional, stoical–not only for a girl of her age, but for a human being of any age.”\n\nOn the rare occasions that the forehand failed her, Wills’s concentration saw her through. In the 1930 Wightman Cup, she fell behind 5-0 to Phoebe Watson and came within two points of losing the set. She finally switched up her tactics, broke the Brit’s momentum, and won the match, 7-5, 6-1.\n\nMany sportswriters pointed to the match as evidence that Helen was beatable. The players came to the opposite conclusion. No matter what you did, or how well you were playing, the Ice Queen had the answer.\n\n* * *\n\nWills hadn’t always been so resilient. Her weakness, especially as a young player, was her movement. Danzig described the teenage Helen as a “statuesque, slow-moving base-liner.” He didn’t mean she looked like a statue–the point was that she moved like one.\n\nIt wasn’t usually a problem. Women’s tennis was almost entirely played from the baseline. Wills came forward twice in the 1924 Olympic final and was passed both times. Still, she won 6-2, 6-2.\n\nOne of the few women who could expose Helen’s subpar mobility was veteran doubles champion Elizabeth Ryan. Ryan’s game was built around chops–sliced balls that served as the perfect disguise for drop shots. In 1925, Wills arrived at the Forest Hills warmup in Seabright on an undefeated streak that stretched back more than a year. The 33-year-old Ryan took advantage of a soggy grass court and chopped her way to a 6-3, 6-3 upset.\n\nIn 1926, Helen came to Seabright on another winning streak, this one dating back to her loss to Lenglen in February. Ryan beat her again, this time allowing the national champion five games instead of six.\n\nLittle Miss Poker Face made some progress: Danzig called her a “pulsating antagonist of mobility” in 1927. But the real problem for Wills’s opponents was that she didn’t give them an opportunity to mix things up, whether that meant forcing Helen to cover the forecourt or attacking the net themselves.\n\nAl Laney found Helen most interesting when she was not in top form. She could control a match despite barely moving from the middle of the baseline. “One often wondered why the silly girl did not make Miss Wills run,” he wrote, “until one realized that the silly girl had more than she could do merely knocking the ball down the center.”\n\n* * *\n\nOne class of opponents could force her out of position and sometimes even defeat the queen: men.\n\nThis is the part of the Helen Wills story I find most compelling. It’s irrelevant to her status among the greats of women’s tennis. But a half-century before the Battle of the Sexes, Helen was practicing against men, playing exhibitions against them, and sometimes winning.\n\nLenglen had played practice matches with men in front of spectators as a teenager, but she increasingly shied away from the practice as she got older. She had an aura to protect. When a professional promoter suggested she play doubles on court with three men, she violently objected.\n\nIn the fall of 1926, Wills entered the men’s doubles tournament at her home club in Berkeley. She and Ward Dawson reached the final and served for the match before losing narrowly to Bud Chandler and Tom Stow.* The newspapers blamed the loss on Dawson.\n\n* A future mentor and coach, respectively, of Don Budge.\n\nOne anonymous contemporary told Helen’s biographer, Larry Engelmann, that “the only men Helen Wills ever beat in a tennis match were real gentlemen.”\n\nPhil Neer, an NCAA champion and frequent exhibition partner, insisted he played at full strength against Helen. Sometimes he won; often he lost.\n\nThe most tantalizing results are those from a pair of practice matches between Wills and Fritz Mercur in 1929. Mercur was good enough to have beaten Bill Tilden the year before. The first time they played, Helen won two sets. After word got around, they played again, and presumably the reputational stakes were a bit higher for Fritz this time. He took two sets from Wills. They played a third, in which Mercur wasn’t allowed to come to net. Helen won that one.\n\n* * *\n\nWills was able to play those matches against men thanks to a no-nonsense attitude that couldn’t have differed more from Lenglen’s. She wasn’t worried about losing the public’s affection just because an exhibition match went sideways.\n\nThat isn’t to say Helen wasn’t famous. At first, she gained from Suzanne’s global reputation: Wills was the home-grown contender for the world crown, the Girl From the Golden West. Her simplicity and her shyness worked in her favor. Stories comparing the two wrote themselves: Lenglen was a leading member of the demi-monde; Helen was in bed every night by ten.\n\nWhen Suzanne left the scene and Wills won at Wimbledon–and then again, and again–Helen was promoted even further. She became the American Girl.\n\nThe public marveled at her beauty. Female athletes were usually–at least in the conventional view–women who didn’t have what it took for other pursuits. The educated, classically beautiful Wills busted the stereotype. Her picture appeared in every newspaper, and sportswriters pointed out that she was even more striking in person. Her workaday tennis visor sparked a fashion trend. Artists from Alexander Calder to Diego Rivera found her an inspiration.\n\n“All the males of America from six to sixty,” wrote one editorialist in 1927, “are a little in love with her.”\n\nThe American Girl was compelling enough that no one minded her ruthless domination of the game. After Ryan beat her in 1926, she dropped a decision to Mallory the following week. And that was it. She didn’t lose again for seven years.\n\n* * *\n\nSeven undefeated years. Even that doesn’t quite cover it. She lost a set in her opening match at the All-England Club in 1927. She didn’t lose another until the Wimbledon final in 1933.\n\nQueen Helen took the “triple crown”–titles at the French, Wimbledon, and Forest Hills–in both 1928 and 1929. Had she been coaxed to play in Australia, she surely would’ve won there as well.\n\nShe had no rivals. There was only Helen Jacobs, the number two American. It was almost as good a story as Wills and Lenglen: The two women grew up on the same street and went to the same schools. But the results between Helen I and Helen II fell flat. When Wills–she became Mrs. Frederick Moody in 1929–won the 1932 Wimbledon title, 6-3, 6-1, she improved her career record against her townswoman to 9-0.\n\nOnly age and injury slowed her down. Dorothy Round gave Mrs. Moody her hardest fight in years at Wimbledon in 1933, successfully moving her around as women had so long tried and failed to do. Back in the States, she skipped the Wightman Cup with leg pain. She retired from the US national final with back troubles.\n\nThe 1933 Forest Hills title match was an enormous controversy at the time. You can still rile up your neighborhood tennis historian if you pick the wrong side. Wills Moody quit down 0-3 in the third set, showing no sign of physical illness. Did she do it just to deprive Jacobs of a proper victory? The Helens didn’t like each other, though the diplomatic Jacobs called it “incompatibility,” not a “feud.”\n\n* I go into more detail in my Jacobs essay. It was a feud, at least in one direction.\n\nWhatever was going through the Ice Queen’s head that day, her dominance of Helen II was over. Two astonishing winning streaks–180 matches, 45 at Forest Hills–were at an end.\n\n* * *\n\nHelen Wills Moody had always played down tennis’s role in her life. She skipped major events to attend classes, or just because she wearied of the travel. She would tell friends she went an entire winter without picking up a racket.\n\nIn reality, she maintained a rigorous practice schedule. She kept to a simple, steady diet. She didn’t go to parties until after she retired. She might not have smiled much, but she loved the game, and her position at the pinnacle of the sport was important to her.\n\nShe missed the entire 1934 season as she recovered from the injuries that compromised her play the previous year. In 1935, she went to England and lost in Beckenham to the British left-hander, Kay Stammers.\n\n“She is not as great as she once was,” wrote the New York Times. “She is not as quick getting to the ball and shows signs of tiring more easily.”\n\nHelen’s groundstrokes, however, remained fearsome. Her mind was as strong as ever. She held off a match point to defeat Jacobs in the Wimbledon final for her seventh singles title at the Championships.\n\nWills came back once more in 1938. (She divorced in 1937 and reverted to her maiden name.) The field finally believed she was beatable. Alice Marble even went so far as to say that the Ice Queen was no longer the best player in the world, though she didn’t specify who replaced her. Mary Hardwick and Hilde Sperling both scored upsets in the weeks before Wimbledon.\n\nBut once again, the American Girl proved equal to everything Wimbledon could throw at her. Sperling pushed her to 12-10, 6-4 in the semis, and she met Jacobs in the final. It was another hard-fought battle, but only for eight games. Jacobs hurt her ankle, and Wills ran out a 6-4, 6-0 victory.\n\nShe left the gallery at the All-England Club with a familiar impression: the eight-time champion holding the winner’s trophy. But for me, the emblematic image of Wills’s career came seven years earlier, in 1931. She coasted to her seventh and last US national title with a 34-minute defeat of British star Eileen Bennett Whittingstall. Helen won 6-4, 6-1.\n\nNear the end of the match, a courtside spectator noticed two drops of sweat on her forehead. Little Miss Poker Face could’ve worked harder; occasionally she did. But on a day like that, against yet another inferior opponent–why bother?\n\n* * *\n\nPrevious: No. 11, Monica Seles\n\nNext: No. 9, Chris Evert\n\nSubscribe to the blog to receive each new post by email:\n\nI’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. Hope I didn’t forget anybody…\n\n* * *\n\nMonica Seles [YUG/USA]\n\nBorn: 2 December 1973\n\nCareer: 1989-2003\n\nPlays: Left-handed (two-handed forehand and backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1991)\n\nPeak Elo rating: 2,563 (1st place, 1993)\n\nMajor singles titles: 9\n\nTotal singles titles: 53\n\n* * *\n\nYou know the story. You also know it’s where I have to start.\n\nBy the time Monica Seles turned 19 years old, she had cemented her status as the best player in the world. She won the 1993 Australian Open, her seventh title of the last eight majors she entered. At the 1992 season-ending Virginia Slims Championships, she straight-setted Martina Navratilova in the final.\n\n“At her best,” said Martina, “she’s as good as anybody I’ve played in twenty years.”\n\nThree tournaments into her 1993 season, Seles was laid low by a viral infection. She missed two months, spending much of that time in bed. She returned to the tour at the Citizen Cup in Hamburg. She showed little sign of any lingering illness, smiling and cruising through the early rounds as usual.\n\nThen, during a changeover in her quarter-final against Magdalena Maleeva, Seles was attacked by a knife-wielding fan. The physical wounds proved to be minor; the mental toll was enormous. The attacker was an unstable Steffi Graf supporter who wanted the German to return to the top of the rankings. By terrorizing Monica into isolation, he got his wish.\n\nSeles didn’t return to the tour for 27 months. She had her share of success when she did, reaching the final of the 1995 US Open and picking up the Australian title–her ninth career slam–in 1996. But she was never fully the same. Struggling with her weight, coping with injuries, haunted by the nightmare in Hamburg, she was unable to recapture the single-minded fearlessness that defined her teen years.\n\nAlong with Maureen Connolly, another all-timer whose career was stunted at 19, Seles is one of the game’s great what-ifs. We can only imagine how long she would’ve remained number one, how many slams she would’ve amassed.\n\nBut because Monica went to play eight post-comeback seasons, many fans think of her career as just a missed opportunity. Let me be absolutely clear about this: She’s the eleventh greatest tennis player of the last hundred years entirely because of what she did accomplish on court. There’s no adjustment for her time on the sidelines, however much she might deserve it.\n\nEven before the attack, much of Seles’s press coverage centered on things other than her knack for blasting winners past helpless opponents. When reporters weren’t mocking the teen-inflected English she picked up as her third language, they wrote at great length about her grunt. Maybe the media would’ve moved on even without a brutal assault to change the narrative; we’ll never know.\n\nMonica said later, “I don’t wish to be remembered as the ‘grunter’ or ‘giggler’ or even as the girl who got stabbed.” Those wishes will always be denied her, but we could at least do her the service of putting the spotlight back on the early 1990s, when she played some of the greatest tennis the world had ever seen.\n\n* * *\n\nSeles defied comparison. If you insisted on explaining her in terms of her contemporaries on the WTA tour, you’d fail.\n\nHer on-court grittiness was pure Jimmy Connors. Her regular-person physique evoked the unexpected athletic exploits of John McEnroe. Her hit-or-miss attempts at glamour and mystery made her the sport’s equivalent of Madonna.\n\nThe devastating double-handed groundstrokes were entirely original. You could point to Pancho Segura’s two-handed forehand bludgeon, but even Segura paired his primary weapon with a standard one-handed backhand. Monica didn’t change her grip at all. That was an unorthodox choice for a reason: It gave her less reach. She had to run that much more. The overall effect was that of a hyperactive squirrel occasionally stopping to hurl a grenade.\n\nA typically unrestrained Seles forehand, at Wimbledon in 1990\n\nSeles had her detractors. Many fans were put off by her grunting. Graf was an established champion with a substantial following; anyone who came along to dethrone her was bound to face an uphill battle to win the public’s affection. The tennis world is always clamoring for fresh new stars, but it has a tendency to harshly judge teenagers who don’t fit a narrow vision of how an up-and-comer ought to look and act.\n\nOne of the few tennis lifers who understood Monica from the get-go was Ted Tinling. The bald, six-foot, four-inch Tinling had been the unlikely face of women’s tennis for decades, most notably as a dress designer to the stars.\n\nTinling got his start in the 1920s as a teenager on the French Riviera, where he became Suzanne Lenglen’s personal umpire. He spent the rest of his life looking for–and trying to help bring about–an icon to equal La belle Suzanne. Three days before his death, he wrote to journalist John Feinstein:\n\nShe’s Doris Day. My God, she’s a normal person, the first one we’ve had in years. We’ve had the awkwardness of [Margaret] Court; the bitchiness of Billie Jean; the brown sugar of Chrissie; the butchness of Martina and the manic shyness of Graf. Now we shall have Seles and she will be wonderful.\n\nOn another occasion, he said simply, “Monica is the one.”\n\n* * *\n\nMany of Seles’s opponents did not find her wonderful. At Wimbledon in 1990, she beat 98th-ranked Ann Henricksson, 6-1, 6-0, in 39 minutes.\n\n“I think I can play a lot better,” said Seles. “What I would like to do is beat everybody in 30 minutes. Then I would be satisfied, I think.”\n\nHer confidence was well-deserved. Henricksson marked Monica’s 36th straight victory, a streak that spanned seven tournaments, five countries, and three surfaces. She won the first 26 matches of the streak without dropping a single set. She dropped a bagel on Conchita Martínez. On clay. Twice.\n\nPlaying for the title in Rome, Seles beat Navratilova, 6-1, 6-1. “It was like being run over by a truck,” said Martina.\n\nThe streak included a title at Roland Garros, making Seles the youngest major champion since Lottie Dod in 1887. After she upset Graf in the final, the deposed champion said, “Seles isn’t a nightmare yet. I hope she isn’t going to become one.”\n\nBut she was already in Steffi’s head. After Monica beat her in Berlin, Graf could be seen on the French Open practice courts tinkering with a two-handed backhand. In the Roland Garros final, Graf took a 5-0 lead in the first set tiebreak, then earned four set points at 6-2. Seles won the next six points to steal the set. It was tough to say what best exemplified the new state of affairs: Steffi’s double fault on her fourth set point, or Monica’s down-the-line winner on her first.\n\nWhen she wasn’t giggling through a post-match interview, Seles made it easy to forget just how young she was. She won the 1990 French Open six months after her 16th birthday. In less than two years, she had sprouted up five inches. Suddenly the racket felt lighter and the net looked lower.\n\nMonica finished her season with a victory at the Virginia Slims Championships. The final was best-of-five, and she and Gabriela Sabatini went the distance. Sabatini led two sets to one when Seles ratcheted her game to an unimaginable level. Monica hit 28 winners against only six unforced errors in the final two sets to roar back to victory.\n\nSabatini hadn’t faced her in more than two years, since before the growth spurt. “I was surprised at the way she hit the ball,” the veteran said. “She hits the ball very, very hard.”\n\n* * *\n\nIn 1991, Seles won ten tournaments, including three of the four majors. (She skipped Wimbledon with shin splints.) She lost only six matches, all of them finals. Her prize money haul reached $2.45 million, a single-season record.\n\nIn March, she grabbed the number one ranking from Graf. Except for four weeks in August and September, she wouldn’t give it back for two years. Her Elo rating at the end of the season–2,459–was the third-highest mark in women’s tennis history to that point, behind only the peaks of Navratilova and Graf.\n\nGraf had held the top spot on the WTA computer for a record 186 consecutive weeks, largely on the strength of a single shot that earned her the nickname Fräulein Forehand. Seles’s ground game was better.\n\n“It’s Steffi’s forehand off both sides,” said Chris Evert. Players debated which side was weaker, then tried exploiting one or the other. Then they lost.\n\n“About the only things Seles didn’t win,” according to Sports Illustrated, “were many hearts or minds.” Monica had gone incommunicado for weeks when she missed Wimbledon, then returned to action only to play an exhibition. She still grunted, and a typical teenage identity crisis left plenty to criticize. For months, it seemed as though she showed up for every match with a new haircut.\n\nVeteran players, on the other hand, saw what Seles was doing right. Pam Shriver and Zina Garrison noticed that she was everything a tour could expect its leading light to be. “She’s not only outgoing, she’s approachable,” said Shriver. “Seles is exactly what we’ve been missing on the tour,” Garrison added.\n\nAnd thanks to her few encounters with Tinling, Monica maintained a particularly un-teen-like interest in the game’s history. She read the complete works of Billie Jean King, and she spoke often of Lenglen as an inspiration.\n\nA decade later, scribes would attribute Seles’s popularity to her resilience. Her struggles–the stabbing, her father’s death in 1998, her weight–made her unusually relatable for an elite athlete. But Tinling was right: Even as a sometimes kooky teen, she was a normal person. The public would have come around soon, even without the kick-start of tragedy.\n\n* * *\n\n1992: Another 70 match wins, another three majors. Ho-hum.\n\nSeles won her third straight French Open, the first time a woman took three straight since Hilde Sperling did it in the 1930s. This one wasn’t easy: Graf pushed her to 6-2, 3-6, 10-8 and saved five match points.\n\nAll those 6-1, 6-0 victories made it easy to forget Monica’s resolve when things got tight. Journalist Christopher Clarey once said, “The two greatest competitors I’ve ever seen in any sport: Michael Jordan and Monica Seles.”\n\nThe one blot on Seles’s 1992 season was the Wimbledon final, where she managed only three games against Steffi. The fracas over her grunting reached a new level: One London tabloid set up a “gruntometer” at her matches. In the semi-finals, Navratilova complained to the umpire, “She sounds like a stuck pig!”\n\nMonica, like nearly all grunters before and since, didn’t do it on purpose. “I hate it,” she said. “I can’t help it.” After decades of petty, often sexist blather, we now know that grunting helps players hit harder. These days, more players grunt on every ball, and few of them would ever think to apologize for it.\n\nBut Seles reached her limit. She tried to stop on the sport’s biggest stage. “Without grunting,” wrote Curry Kirkpatrick, “she had no bounce, no pace on her shots. Without grunting, she was Rapunzel without the hair, Streisand without the nose.”\n\nSeles and Graf met only one more time before Seles was attacked. In their final-round rematch at the 1993 Australian Open, Monica re-engaged her vocal cords and won in three.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Seles returned to the tour after 27 months away, she immediately gave a glimpse of what the tour had missed. At her first tournament back, in Toronto, she lost only 14 games in five matches.\n\nWhen she won the Australian Open a few months later, her fellow champion Boris Becker said, “What she’s achieving right now is one of the amazing comebacks of all time.” She’d reach four major finals and another four semis in her second act. She remained in the top ten almost continuously until 2003.\n\nMore impressive than anything she achieved on court, she overcame the demons of that day in Hamburg. There was more than a little reclusiveness in the Seles family DNA. Her grandfather, Jakab, was tormented as a conscientious objector during World War I. Her father never forgot watching countrymen deported during the second continental conflagration. In Florida, the family chose to live at the end of a dead-end road in a gated community. Seles made hardly any public appearances in the two years after Hamburg.\n\nYet Monica, finally, went a different way. “As an athlete you have a choice to be as open or closed as you want,” she said in 2009. “I made a choice to be open.”\n\nIt is tempting to speculate just what Seles would have accomplished had her career gone on uninterrupted. She could have won 15 majors, perhaps 20, maybe even a record-setting 25. In that scenario, it’s hard to imagine her failing to win Wimbledon–the one trophy, she said in 1991, “missing from my collection.”\n\nThe hypothetical I find more thought-provoking is this: Ten majors or thirty, how long would it have taken before Seles became a truly beloved number one? Every year, more fans recognized in her what Ted Tinling saw so readily. At least we got a sort of answer to that question. Post-comeback, her popularity soared even as she struggled to remain in the top five.\n\nWe certainly can’t reach any conclusions by making comparisons with other players. Monica was one of a kind. Tinling had to wait sixty years for another Lenglen. We’d be lucky to get another Seles so soon.\n\nI’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. Hope I didn’t forget anybody…\n\n* * *\n\nBjörn Borg [SWE]\n\nBorn: 6 June 1956\n\nCareer: 1972-81\n\nPlays: Right-handed (two-handed backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1977)\n\nPeak Elo rating: 2,473 (1st place, 1980)\n\nMajor singles titles: 11\n\nTotal singles titles: 66\n\n* * *\n\nThe tennis boom of the 1970s had many origins. Open tennis revitalized the sport, pitting amateur stars like Arthur Ashe against living legends such as Rod Laver and Richard González. Television discovered tennis in a big way, putting high-profile matches in prime time slots. Billie Jean King made the sport as popular among women as it was among men.\n\nAlso: Björn Borg was really, ridiculously good looking.\n\nTennis has always had its leading men. Even before the freewheeling 1960s, those men rarely had to look far to find adoring female fans. Borg took things to a new level. When his blue eyes and long blond hair touched down at Wimbledon, it was the athletic equivalent of the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show. Before he was the Viking God, he was the Teen Angel.\n\nWithin a few years, the Swede transcended tennis entirely. “He was bigger than the game,” said Ashe. “He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.”\n\nIronically, the ultimate celebrity product of the Open era–a man who could win Wimbledon every year while still earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money–still found a way to butt heads with the establishment. The World Championship Tennis (WCT) circuit, like the modern-day ATP, tried to prevent its stars from playing lucrative exhibitions that conflicted with its own events. Borg, as much as any other player in those superagent-driven years, chased the money, lawsuits be damned. In 1976, he sprinkled his season with a whopping 28 exhibition matches.\n\nWhile Borg was never going to last into his thirties, his differences with the powers that be hastened his departure from the game. “Every tournament I was playing in 1981,” he later said, “I didn’t care.” He still considered taking on a limited schedule in 1982. But a new rule stipulated that he needed to commit to at least ten events. Unwilling to cave, the reigning French Open champion was forced into the odd course of playing qualifying rounds at his home tournament in Monte Carlo.\n\nThat was his last sanctioned event of the season. Instead of Roland Garros and Wimbledon, the Swede played more than 30 exhibition matches around the globe in 1982. The results didn’t matter–Vitas Gerulaitis finally beat him, something the American had rarely managed even in practice–but he was no longer playing for glory.\n\nBack in 1974, Laver got his first good look at the intensity that Borg brought to every point of every match that the 17-year-old played. “If you play this hard,” warned the Rocket, “your mind will be drained, you’ll burn out in seven years.”\n\nLaver was right. But oh, what a seven years it was!\n\n* * *\n\nSweden didn’t need Björn Borg to put it on the international tennis map. Sven Davidson won the French Championships in 1957, and a group led by the stylish Jan-Erik Lundqvist went deep in the European Davis Cup competition throughout the early 1960s. The country even had a “Little Wimbledon” in the resort town of Båstad.\n\nNonetheless, it would always seem that Borg had come out of nowhere. His two-handed backhand didn’t owe a thing to Davidson or Lundqvist. His first coach, Percy Rosberg, was skeptical of a game built on topspin.\n\n“Snow will stick to the ball up there,” Rosberg would say as he chased down yet another looping forehand.\n\nThe young man hit hard, and Rosberg wasn’t the only one who spotted something fearsome in his eyes. He would practice until he was ordered off the court. It never occurred to him to balance tennis with other pursuits; he ignored his schoolwork until his athletic schedule finally demanded that he drop out entirely.\n\nBorg with coach, manager, and Davis Cup captain Lennart Bergelin after securing the 1975 Davis Cup for Sweden\n\nIn 1972, the 15-year-old played his first Davis Cup rubber, defeating Onny Parun of New Zealand in five sets. A year later, he made the final at Monte Carlo and reached the quarter-finals at boycott-weakened Wimbledon, where he took Roger Taylor to five sets. In Stockholm that November, he beat both Ilie Năstase and Jimmy Connors to reach another final. American Tom Gorman needed a third-set tiebreak to finally stop him.\n\nBorg signed with the WCT circuit in 1974. In four months, he won two titles, beat Laver and Ashe, and reached the title match of the WCT Finals in May. British player Mark Cox, one of his many victims, summarized the early Borg game:\n\n[I]t’s very difficult to get on him because he keeps coming at you, putting on the pressure, and you can’t get any rhythm. Of course, he still doesn’t think; he is smacking, smacking the ball always. He plays with a total lack of inhibition, strictly on talent and inspiration, and it’s enough.\n\nThe Swede didn’t need to be a tactical genius to win matches. Still, Cox was not the last opponent to underestimate Borg’s savvy. Some men had a sense of when it was time to switch to Plan B. Björn’s Plan A was so strong that he needed only to recognize he ought to stick with it. In the 1974 French Open final, he dropped the first two sets to Spanish veteran Manuel Orantes. Other tyros would have changed things up–or simply accepted their fate. Borg noticed that Orantes looked exhausted, and stuck with the game that put him the 0-2 hole. He won the remaining three sets, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1.\n\n* * *\n\nBorg didn’t need much in the way of tactics to win on clay. His topspin overwhelmed everyone except for Guillermo Vilas, and in a long match, Vilas wasn’t strong enough to hang with the hyper-fit champion.\n\nOnly one man, Adriano Panatta, would ever beat Björn at Roland Garros. Borg ultimately picked up six French titles, one of his many records that would appear untouchable until Rafael Nadal knocked them down. In 1978 and 1980, Borg didn’t lose a single set in Paris. In those fourteen matches, only the big-serving Roscoe Tanner even took him to a tiebreak.\n\nAfter losing to Connors at the 1976 US Open, the Swede won 99 consecutive completed matches on clay. He didn’t lose again on dirt for nearly four years.\n\nOn grass, the game seemed almost as simple. It just took Borg a bit more time to learn it. He showed up for Wimbledon in 1976 with a new and improved attacking game. “I volley big and tough now,” he said. He didn’t lose a set at the All-England Club that year. He destroyed Vilas in the quarters, out-blasted Tanner in the semis, and brushed past Năstase in the final. Against the Romanian, he came in behind every one of his first serves. He won more than 70% of them.\n\n“They should send Borg away to another planet,” said Năstase. “We play tennis. He plays something else.”\n\nBorg never mastered the Wimbledon grass to the degree he conquered clay. But that’s a bit like saying Rembrandt painted better than he drew. Björn didn’t lose another match at the Championships until 1981, when John McEnroe beat him in the final.\n\nIn the interim, he played a stunning pair of five-setters to win the 1977 title. Before outlasting Connors in the final, he was pushed to 8-6 in the fifth by Gerulaitis in the semis. Commentator Dan Maskell considered the semi-final to be the best match he’d seen in fifty years at Wimbledon. That judgment lasted all of three years, until Borg came out on top of another epic.\n\nIn the 1980 final, McEnroe saved seven match points and won a fourth-set tiebreak, 18-16, that stands alone as the sport’s greatest ever. The Swede withstood the American at his explosive best, holding off still more break points for a fifth-set advantage. After three hours and 53 minutes, he took another 8-6 deciding set, his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title, and his third straight French-Wimbledon double.\n\n* * *\n\nYou might have noticed a thread running through these highlights. When Borg wasn’t plowing through the field, dropping a handful of games per match, he played his share of fifth sets. Even though there’s some selection bias in the ones I’ve mentioned, he was stunning at the end of marathon matches.\n\nThe Swedish ironman won five-set finals to secure the 1974 French title, as well as Wimbledon in 1977, 1979, and 1980. He endured another against Ivan Lendl to win at Roland Garros in 1981, then went five to hold off Connors in the Wimbledon semis. And that was the year he didn’t care.\n\nAll told, Borg won 26 of his 32 career five-set matches. He somehow arrived on tour with the mental equipment to go the distance: He won 11 of his first 12, all before his 19th birthday. Losing two in a row didn’t faze him, either. He bounced back to beat his idol, Laver, in a crucial match at the 1975 WCT finals. He reeled off another 12 in a row*–a streak that spanned more than four years–before McEnroe finally stopped him in the 1980 US Open final.\n\n* One contemporary report claims that he won 13 straight five-setters. It’s possible I’m missing one.\n\nThe US Open was the only tournament where Borg dropped more than one fifth set. Giant-killer Vijay Amritraj ousted him in 1974, and McEnroe beat him for the title in 1980. The Swede never did win the title in Flushing. When he lost to Amritraj, he could blame the surface–the Open was still held on grass. From 1978, he could once again point to the conditions: speedy new DecoTurf hard courts.\n\nBut for three years in between, the US Open was played on clay. Ersatz Har-Tru dirt, yes, but Björn had won plenty on that, too. Instead of cleaning up, he lost to Connors in 1975 and 1976, then exited with an injury in 1977. By 1980, when Borg finally won a high-profile event at Madison Square Garden, his struggles in the Big Apple had long looked like a jinx.\n\nIt’s important to keep some perspective here. The Swede did reach four finals in six years. For the man who won 11 of the 18 majors he entered outside the United States, though, it is a conspicuous oh-fer. Some of the blame goes to Connors and McEnroe, who played great tennis at their home event. Also, by September each year, Borg had usually picked up an injury or two. Borg and McEnroe had entered the 1980 edition with so many health complaints that Connors described the final as “two gimps battling it out.”\n\nBjörn’s main problem with the US Open, I suspect, was the same thing that had handicapped nervy players in New York for decades. It has always been the in-your-face slam, the event where it’s impossible to hide from the press, the crowds, the big city. Borg, the prime idol of them all, knew how to hide in Europe. Before Wimbledon each year, he went through a carefully choreographed fortnight of preparation, rarely stepping out of his hotel room for anything other than a practice session. In New York, he couldn’t control his surroundings to the same extent.\n\nHe would have figured it out eventually, just as his finicky rival Lendl did. But as he would increasingly ask himself: Why bother?\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s no wonder that by 1981, Borg didn’t care. His near-decade of top-level tennis was as intense as anything a player had ever sustained for such a long period of time. The pre-Open era pros might have worked harder for a year or two at a time, but aside from Laver, González, and Ken Rosewall, they remained at the top for only a short time.\n\nBy the standards of the all-time greats, the Swede’s career was indeed short. Bill Tilden played competitively for his entire life. Most of the handful of champions who piled up more slams than Borg did–the Big Three, Navratilova, Serena, and so on–spent twice as long on tour.\n\nBut we need to keep “short” in perspective. Borg was both a global heartthrob and a single athletic focal point in his native Sweden. Every move he made was tracked, speculated upon, and blown wildly out of proportion by tabloids all across Europe.\n\nWhen Borg first announced his retirement, he had been on tour for about nine years. The Beatles–perhaps a better measuring stick than any mere sporting idol–lasted only eight.\n\nThough Björn faded from view–sort of, as he attempted various comebacks and played a steady stream of exhibitions–his playing style did not. When he was a teenager, his two-handed backhand was barely more than a novelty. A decade later, he, Connors, and Chris Evert had made it the standard option for baseliners.\n\nBorg arrived on tour as one of the fittest guys around, the player willing to practice more than anyone else. By the time he quit, Vilas was suffering through even more brutal sessions, and Lendl was organizing his life around tennis with a single-mindedness that surpassed the Swede’s.\n\nThat level of intensity, on and off the court, would eventually come to define men’s tennis. As late as the Pete Sampras era, top players would talk about coasting on some points to save energy for others. You don’t hear that much anymore. No one presaged the first-ball-to-last-ball pressure of Rafael Nadal–or David Ferrer for that matter–more than Borg.\n\nIn 1983, Vitas Gerulaitis lamented the increasing homogeneity of the tour. “In five years tennis is going to be very boring,” he told journalist Michael Mewshaw. “We’ll have a draw with 128 Borgs.”\n\nI’m not sure what Vitas would think of the game in 2022. There is certainly less variety than there was back when he was challenging the original Big Three of Borg, McEnroe, and Connors. The preferred tactics these days are absolutely more Björn than Johnny Mac. The standard of play–especially among the rank and file–has risen enormously as well. Even the men who skimp on topspin or cling to a one-handed backhand have, in their match preparation and their on-court demeanor, become more like the Swede.\n\nA draw of 128 Borgs? We’re not quite there yet, but Björn, more than any player of his era, offered a glimpse of the future.\n\nI’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. It’s like an advent calendar, only I keep the chocolate.\n\n* * *\n\nJohn McEnroe [USA]\n\nBorn: 16 February 1959\n\nCareer: 1977-92\n\nPlays: Left-handed (one-handed backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1980)\n\nPeak Elo rating: 2,442 (1st place, 1985)\n\nMajor singles titles: 7\n\nTotal singles titles: 77\n\n* * *\n\nAfter the initial tennis boom of the 1970s subsided, Americans slid into the more sedate pastime of psychoanalyzing John McEnroe. Jimmy Connors and Ilie Năstase were easy enough to understand. To varying degrees, they were crude, showboating clowns with hair-trigger tempers.\n\nMcEnroe was something different.\n\nThe slim, pasty left-hander hardly looked like a world-class athlete, but he was undeniably gifted. He qualified and reached the semi-final at Wimbledon on his first try, in 1977. Just as quickly, he alienated stiff-upper-lip Brits along with tennis traditionalists worldwide. No mistake escaped his notice. He permitted himself no margin for error, and he treated others the same way. He never stopped to think before giving line judges–and chair umpires, and referees, and photographers, and reporters, and the occasional spectator–an often-profane piece of his mind.\n\nLondon tabloids dubbed him “SuperBrat” and “McNasty.” The public leaned toward disapproval, but they didn’t dare look away.\n\nIon Țiriac, the coach and manager who handled Năstase, Guillermo Vilas, and Boris Becker, explained his appeal a decade later: “Half come to see him win. Half come to see him lose. Half come to see what happens.”\n\nEveryone had a theory. McEnroe was spoiled. He was a typical New Yorker. He was standard-issue Irish. He didn’t care enough about tennis. He cared too much about winning. He got so bored that he manufactured controversy. He was the master gamesman. His outbursts were completely beyond his control.\n\nArthur Ashe knew the youngster as both opponent and Davis Cup captain. He took a stab at it: “He’s not that hard to understand. He’s just like any other twenty-three-year-old millionaire college dropout.”\n\nRichard Evans took the opposite tack. Evans, a British journalist, ultimately wrote not one but two McEnroe biographies. The subtitle of the first, A Rage For Perfection, gives you an idea of how he assessed the champion in 1982. Eight years later, Evans came to this conclusion:\n\nMcEnroe is, above all, a complicated man–complicated to a degree far in excess of the public’s comprehension of just how complicated a human being can be.\n\nDear me. I’ll defer to Evans on that one.\n\nFortunately, McEnroe’s exploits between the white lines weren’t quite so inscrutable. He did things with a tennis racket that other men could barely imagine. His emotional instability was tied up with a belief–an expectation, even–that he could play perfect tennis. More than almost anyone before or since, he very nearly did.\n\n* * *\n\nIt would be years before McEnroe could sustain a months-long stretch of perfection. But even in his teens, it was clear what he was capable of.\n\nIn 1978, while he lost early at Wimbledon, he reached the US Open semi-finals, where he lost to Connors. Then McEnroe went on a 38-3 tear, picking up titles in Hartford, San Francisco, Stockholm, and Wembley, then securing the Davis Cup final for the Americans.\n\nThe won-loss record made an impression, but what really woke up the tennis establishment was the way he played on his best days. The young man they called “Junior”–his father, also called John, frequently traveled with him–deferred to no one.\n\nIn Stockholm, McEnroe dealt Björn Borg his first-ever loss to a younger player. He barely broke a sweat. Borg lost 6-3, 6-4, and managed just seven points on McEnroe’s serve. The newcomer wielded an unreadable array of serves, acrobatic reach at the net, and tactical savvy beyond his years. When he wasn’t rushing the net, he neutralized Borg with easy “nothing” balls that negated the champion’s own ability to attack.\n\nIn the Davis Cup final, Junior conceded just ten games in six sets against Brits John Lloyd and Buster Mottram. “I have never played anybody, including Borg and Connors, who has been as tough and made me play so many shots,” said Lloyd. “No one has ever made me look like that much of an idiot.”\n\nMcEnroe thought he could’ve played better.\n\nHe finished the year ranked fourth on the ATP computer. Connors, whose lefty forehand erased some of the advantage of Junior’s slice serve, still had his number. Borg, no matter the result in Stockholm, held two of the four majors.\n\nBut the writing was on the wall. “Right now,” Ashe said after the Davis Cup final, “McEnroe is the best player in the world.”\n\n* * *\n\nA few months into the 1979 campaign, Borg was almost ready to concede as much. At the World Championship Tennis (WCT) finals in May, Junior beat Connors in straight sets, then upset Borg in four.\n\n“I felt slow and always too late,” Borg said after the match. “When you play John you have to be absolutely on top of your game, or you lose immediately.”\n\nConnors was no longer able to meet that standard. Jimbo won six of the first seven meetings between the two explosive Americans, but beginning with the 1979 WCT encounter, McEnroe won 19 of 27. Connors would always have it in him to deliver a memorable performance, as he did to take the 1982 Wimbledon title. But Mac was now the man.\n\nAt the US Open, Borg lost early, and McEnroe claimed his first major championship. He defeated Connors in the semis and Vitas Gerulaitis in the final, dropping only one set–to Năstase in the second round–the whole tournament.\n\nIt was his eighth tournament victory of the season, but his public image remained more bad-boy than champion. Gerulaitis summed up how the New York crowd viewed its two native sons: “Popularity-wise, I’m a notch above John, and John is a notch above Son of Sam.”\n\nHad a couple of linesmen turned up dead, the authorities probably would have questioned McEnroe first.\n\nJunior would take a major step toward salvaging his reputation with a heroic performance at Wimbledon the next year. At the site of his 1977 breakthrough, he met Connors again in the 1980 semi-finals. This time, the younger man won in four sets and advanced to a final-round meeting with Borg.\n\nThe result was one of the most captivating matches in tennis history. Junior was on his best behavior–he never did act out when he shared the court with the stoic Swede–but the contrast remained striking. The steady game of the champion and the electric shotmaking of the challenger had never been so evenly matched.\n\nBorg had a chance to finish the job in the fourth set–seven match points, in fact. But it was not that the Swede failed at the critical moment, it was McEnroe who rose to the occasion. The American took the fourth set in a 34-point tiebreak so thrilling that dozens of fans back in Sweden died of heart failure.* Borg regrouped to win the match, 8-6 in the fifth, but if ever two men walked off Centre Court as co-champions, it was on that day.\n\n* This feels like it must be apocryphal. I hope it’s apocryphal. But I tracked down a newspaper mention of the statistic as far back as 1982. So, um, be careful out there.\n\nJohnny Mac’s home crowd still wasn’t quite persuaded to back the American. He heard his usual share of jeers as he turned the tables on Borg to win a five-set final at Flushing Meadow. He said, “I figure I’m about ten Wimbledon finals exactly like the last one away from getting those people on my side.”\n\n* * *\n\nMcEnroe first claimed the number one ranking in March of 1980, four months before the Wimbledon final and more than a year after Ashe first proclaimed him the best in the world. He wouldn’t hold on: He’d swap places with Borg six times in a year and ultimately gain and lose the top spot on 14 separate occasions.\n\nBut in 1981, Junior left little doubt he was the king of men’s tennis. He beat Borg for both the Wimbledon and US Open titles. The 1980 Wimbledon final may have felt like a turning point, but I don’t think anyone walked away from that match believing it heralded the Swede’s almost immediate demise. In the event, McEnroe grabbed the reins, and Borg tumbled into a premature retirement.\n\nSports Illustrated offered a new reason for US fans to root against their champion: “McEnroe is getting so good he’s taking all the fun out of things.”\n\n(J-Mac: “Fun? I enjoy the competition. But I was brought up to be very serious on the court, and I just can’t be what you call a crowd-pleaser.”)\n\nEven more fun left the building in 1982, something of an off-year for the American. Ivan Lendl took Borg’s place as the top European, and he offered an even more dramatic contrast with McEnroe. His strokes were as robotic as Mac’s were natural, and he practiced more in a day than Junior did most weeks. The Czech beat McEnroe four times in four meetings, including a straight-set US Open semi-final.\n\nYet John, once again, proved himself capable of perfection. He won his last 24 matches of the season, running off four titles and finishing a perfect eight-for-eight Davis Cup singles campaign. Back in July, he had outlasted Mats Wilander in a record-setting six-hour duel just to reach the Davis Cup semis.\n\nIf there was anything that would earn McEnroe the adulation of fickle tennis fans, it was his undisguised passion for team play. One friend called him the best team player never to pursue a team sport. He was always available for Davis Cup, and with rare exceptions, he seemed to play even better with USA on his shirt.\n\nEven apart from international competition, Junior was one hell of a teammate. Peter Fleming often said that the best doubles team of his era was “McEnroe and anyone.” Fleming, standing six-feet, five-inches with a serve to match, was being modest. The best team was McEnroe and Fleming. The pair won seven majors together along with dozens more titles between 1978 and 1986.\n\nMuch of the time, a doubles match for McEnroe was a lark, an ideal substitute for a boring practice session. But what fans rarely saw–and journalists even more rarely publicized–was that Mac was most dangerous on the doubles court after he had lost in singles. Unlike many of his peers and most of the superstars who followed him, he didn’t default to get an early start on the next event. He got serious.\n\nMcEnroe detractors lumped him in with everything they disliked about the modern game–money-grubbing primadonnas, you know the story. But while the volatile lefty could be a “maniac”–his word!–he didn’t share the other flaws. At Basel in 1978, he lost a tiring singles final to Vilas, injuring his elbow in the process. He took two aspirin, laid down for 20 minutes, and came back out to win the doubles title.\n\n“The kid would have made a helluva player on the old pro tour,” said Jack Kramer, who generally reserved his praise for men no younger than Don Budge. “He’s got pride, he’s consistent, he plays hurt and he dislikes losing in front of anybody. I tell you what he is: The kid’s a throwback.”\n\n* * *\n\nIn 1983, McEnroe pulled ahead of Lendl. In 1984, he gained the upper hand on everybody.\n\nJunior delivered his most convincing defeat of Lendl to date in the 1983 Wimbledon semi-finals, then waltzed through the final against 91st-ranked Chris Lewis. In three sets, he lost only nine points on serve.\n\nHe went through the usual dramatics in the early rounds, throwing a racket, insulting an umpire, and prompting many of his fellow players to call for stricter enforcement against the champion. But no one could deny the quality of his play. Sports Illustrated put him on the cover–tagline, “Never Better”–and proposed that the only way Wimbledon could keep things interesting would be to create a new unisex bracket so that McEnroe could face the equally imperious women’s champ, Martina Navratilova.\n\nIn 1984, the entire tour was Chris Lewis. McEnroe posted one of the greatest seasons of all time. He went 82-3, winning Wimbledon, the US Open, and twelve more titles besides. At the All-England Club, he polished off Connors, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2. He committed only two unforced errors.\n\nTwo.\n\nAs staggering as the 82-3 mark sounds, even that doesn’t quite capture the duration of his peak form. First off, one of the three losses was a five-setter in the Roland Garros final. Any other season, and that would’ve counted as a shocking triumph for the fast-court specialist, even if the circumstances–he let the match slip away after he took the first two sets and picked a fight with a cameraman–hardly covered McEnroe in glory.\n\nSecond, he recovered from a painful finale to sustain his streak into 1985. For such a historic campaign, 1984 ended with a thud. McEnroe was kept out of the Wembley indoor event in November because he had drawn too many fines for bad behavior. (Ya think anybody would’ve beaten him there?) Then he took part in America’s embarrassing defeat to Sweden in the Davis Cup final. If Junior was typically a great man to have on the squad, he was hobbled in Gothenberg by the worst teammate of all: Connors. Neither man would’ve chosen the indoor clay surface of the tie. Jimbo lost badly, then McEnroe dropped the second rubber to Henrik Sundström–his third loss of the year. Mac and Fleming lost the doubles to Stefan Edberg and Anders Järryd to hand the Cup to the hosts.\n\nNo matter. McEnroe returned to action less than a month later, beating Järryd, Wilander, and Lendl for the Masters title. He won 22 in a row to start the season, good for a 15-month record of 104-3.\n\nAfter defeating Connors in Chicago for his fifth title of 1985, McEnroe’s Elo rating–per my retrospective calculations–reached 2,442. That’s the third-highest mark of any Open era man, trailing only the very best form of Borg and Novak Djokovic.\n\nVic Braden analyzed John’s strokes and concluded, “[B]iomechanically he’s so perfect it looks like magic.”\n\nMcEnroe said in 1984, “I still think I can play better.”\n\n* * *\n\nBorg retired at the age of 26. McEnroe didn’t understand it at the time. Deprived of his greatest rival, he never quite forgave him for it.\n\nBut at the same age, similar pressures–family, celebrity, at least a touch of burnout–struck down the American. The 1984 US Open title would prove to be his last major championship. In 1985, he fell in the quarters at Wimbledon, then lost the Flushing final in straights to Lendl. He couldn’t derive the usual enjoyment from Davis Cup, since he wouldn’t sign a code of conduct that sponsors forced on the squad after the shambolic performance in Gothenburg.\n\nAt the Australian Open, McEnroe spent more energy arguing than attacking the net, and after a quarter-final loss to Slobodan Živojinović, his accumulated offenses triggered a 21-day suspension. The absence turned into seven months, as he stayed home with his bride-to-be, actress Tatum O’Neal, and the couple’s young son. He took another extended break after the 1987 US Open.\n\nWith seven majors and 170 weeks at number one, Junior had little to prove. Instead, he sought a healthier relationship with the game. “I don’t want to be like I used to be any more,” he told Richard Evans. “I have to learn to enjoy myself more and if that means I cannot be number one again, I am just going to have to accept that.”\n\nThose of us who remember watching McEnroe in his final years can attest to fact that he never quite accepted it. But he did live with it. On any given day, he could summon the wizardry that conquered Borg, Connors, and the rest. A series of battles with Boris Becker were particularly memorable, even if they usually resulted in a victory for the German.\n\nAs it turned out, McEnroe the maniac couldn’t be separated from McEnroe the genius. Some players find they can’t sustain the demands of practice and preparation needed to stay at the top. Johnny Mac never bothered with that, so the fervor of an all-time great was channeled into mental and emotional turmoil.\n\nTennis fans still get glimpses of that intensity. McEnroe is ever-present, as a commentator, an exhibition star, a still-valuable brand endorser. He has given more thought to his psychological makeup than anyone else has, and he rarely gives a boring interview. As a result, we get a steady stream of documentaries and profiles of the former champ that, oddly enough, tend to focus on his failings.\n\nThere were plenty of those, to be sure. But it’s impossible to watch an early-1980s McEnroe match without recognizing that he was one of the most talented men ever to play the game. You can’t look at his career record and deny that he achieved as much as all but a handful of players in the game’s history. It’s illogical to cancel out the positives just because it was so easy to imagine him winning even more.\n\nIn 2002, McEnroe brought up an old saw: “As they say in sports, the older you get, the better you used to be.” It’s true of Borg, and Connors has done even better–the older he’s gotten, the nicer he used to be. Johnny Mac breaks the mold in the other direction, making sure every new generation of fans learns what was wrong with him.\n\nEase up, John. You cannot be serious.\n\nI’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. It’s like an advent calendar, only I keep the chocolate.\n\n* * *\n\nSuzanne Lenglen [FRA]\n\nBorn: 24 May 1899\n\nDied: 4 July 1938\n\nCareer: 1912-27\n\nPlayed: Right-handed (one-handed backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1921)\n\nMajor singles titles: 8 (4 World Hard Court titles)\n\nTotal singles titles: 83\n\n* * *\n\nNow we enter the realm of myth.\n\nBack at the beginning of the Tennis 128 project, a friend encouraged me to mix in an April Fool’s essay. I immediately thought of the famous George Plimpton prank, “The Curious Case of Sidd Finch,” published by Sports Illustrated in 1985.\n\nFinch was a Buddhist, french horn-playing baseball pitcher who could throw a fastball 168 miles per hour. The New York Mets brought him to Spring Training, where he fretted over his destiny and the potential injuries that his fireball might cause. There was no doubt he would succeed on the diamond. No one could see his pitches, let alone hit them. Of course, Sidd Finch was nothing more than a figment of Plimpton’s imagination.\n\nWhat is the tennis equivalent? Perhaps a player who simply never missed a ball, one who could place any shot on a handkerchief laid within inches of the opposite baseline? A force of nature who seemed to be playing a different sport than the rest of the circuit, one who could enter tournament after tournament for years on end without losing a single match?\n\nIt would be possible–just–for a youngster to arrive out of nowhere, capable of smacking a serve harder than Sam Groth, looping a forehand with more RPMs than Rafael Nadal, and chasing down a drop shot faster than Lauren Davis. Those tools would, indeed, amount to an unthinkably perfect tennis player. But nothing really worked. It took me a couple of weeks, and a few pages full of fruitless notes, to figure out why the joke of a racket-wielding Finch would inevitably fall flat.\n\nIt wouldn’t be satire. We got our flawless champion one hundred years ago. Someone with a style that seemed to come from a future generation, with the skills to match. Someone who so comprehensively outplayed the field that hapless foes counted their triumphs in mere points. Games, if they were lucky.\n\nHer name was Suzanne Lenglen.\n\n* * *\n\nHelen Jacobs saw one of the last public matches Lenglen ever played. “There seemed to be no chink in her armor,” she wrote, “no position on the court in which she was not the master.”\n\n“When you saw her play you did not know how good she was because it looked so easy,” wrote Helen Wills Moody. “It was only from the other side of the net that you realized how really good she was. Her control and delicacy of placement will probably never be equaled.”\n\n“She never made a mistake, in stroking or tactics,” said five-time Wimbledon champion Charlotte Cooper Sterry. “She was like a cat playing with a mouse.”\n\nElizabeth Ryan told a reporter in 1941: “I had the best drop shot anybody ever had. But she could not only get up to it but was so fast that often she could score a placement off of it. She had a stride a foot and a half longer than any known woman who ever ran.”\n\n“At first, I was disappointed, as were most of those who saw her for the first time after having heard so much about her,” wrote René Lacoste. “She played with marvelous ease the simplest strokes in the world. It was only after several games that I understood what harmony was concealed by her simplicity, what wonderful mental and physical balance was hidden by the facility of her play.”\n\n“Suzanne could beat any woman any day by any score she wanted,” said Bill Johnston. “She was by far the best woman player ever.”\n\n* * *\n\nIt is impossible, from our 21st century vantage point, to fully grasp Lenglen’s greatness. She won her first Wimbledon in 1919, when most other women players wore whalebone corsets, and venturing to the net was almost as audacious as exposing an ankle.\n\nSuzanne’s father, Charles, was the original overbearing tennis dad. Like Richard Williams, he noticed that tennis prowess and wealth seemed to go hand in hand. Never mind that, in the 1910s, champions earned no prize money–that would work itself out. Suzanne had a surfeit of athletic gifts–she was the French high jump champion in 1919, to name just one–and Charles channeled them into her tennis.\n\nCharles’s key insight was that his fleet-footed daughter didn’t have to play like a stodgy middle-aged lady. The Lenglens spent part of each year in Nice, where they could watch the strong British and Continental players who gathered on the Riviera every winter. Charles ignored the ladies and studied dashing men players like Max Decugis and Tony Wilding. They played the net; they attacked.\n\nUnder her father’s careful eye, Suzanne mastered every stroke in the arsenal. When the rudiments were in place, Suzanne practiced almost exclusively with men. In 1918, the 18-year-old Lenglen beat 1911 French champion André Gobert in a casual match, 6-1, 6-1. Even though Gobert was out of form, convalescing after a wartime air crash, it was a remarkable feat for a young woman. A year later, journalist Al Laney saw her play doubles with three men. “She was the equal of the men in everything but severity,” he later wrote, “and their superior in mobility and accuracy.”\n\nBy then, other women didn’t stand a chance. Suzanne won her first adult title in 1913. She picked up her first trophy on the Riviera in 1914. She lost only to the strongest players on the circuit: Ryan, seven-time Wimbledon winner Dorothea Lambert Chambers, and French titlist Marguerite Broquedis. Her defeat at the hands of Broquedis in the Challenge Round of the 1914 French Championships was the last time she lost a completed singles match.\n\nWe’ll never know what Lenglen would’ve achieved between 1915 and 1918. The Great War wiped out tennis across Europe. But it wasn’t a complete loss. While Suzanne sometimes said she spent her time rolling bandages for the troops and hardly picked up a racket, plenty of eyewitnesses attested to daily practice sessions in Nice.\n\nThe Riviera circuit was back in full swing in 1919. I have results for 16 matches Lenglen played as she won six tournaments in France that spring. Here are the scores:\n\n6-1 6-1\n\n6-1 6-1\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-1\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-1\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-1\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-0\n\n6-0 6-1\n\n6-0 6-1\n\nLaney wrote of Suzanne’s later years as a global celebrity: “Just to see her crush some unfortunate girl 6-0, 6-0 was an event.”\n\nThere would be a lot of events like that.\n\n* * *\n\nMost of Lenglen’s post-war matches were little more than exhibitions of Suzanne’s otherworldly skill. It didn’t matter. She quickly became perhaps the most famous sporting figure up to that point in history, her every move tracked by reporters and fans.\n\nShe was invariably compared to a dancer. No one had ever seen such acrobatics on a tennis court, especially from a woman. She made sure that people noticed, lunging and pirouetting when it wasn’t necessary. “[A]ll those crazy leaps she used to take were done after she hit the ball,” said Ryan. “Sure, she was a poser, a ham in the theatrical sense.”\n\nThe press treated her like a prima ballerina. They dubbed her “La belle Suzanne,” or simply, “La Divine”–the goddess. Charles, and later Suzanne herself, carefully avoided overexposure, limiting her tournament entries on the Riviera. Annual will-she-or-won’t-she chatter drove up demand and ensured that the Lenglens collected substantial under-the-table payments for her presence.\n\nNo woman’s appearance was more hotly debated. US champion Hazel Wightman said, “She was so homely–you can’t imagine a homelier face.” No one really disagreed, and cartoonists could do a particularly nasty job on her nose.\n\nBut when Suzanne came to life, no one could look away. Her charisma was such, Laney wrote, that she could “[take] the attention away from dozens of women far prettier.” Couturiers lined up to dress her. When she started wearing headbands, she kicked off a global rage.\n\nFans flocked to her matches in such numbers that architects had to rethink stadium design. When Lenglen first appeared at Wimbledon, the tournament made the mistake of putting her on Court 4. Admirers “trampled the shrubbery” in their quest to see her. If she so much as practiced, spectators would abandon a match in progress just to spot La Divine in the flesh.\n\nIronically, Suzanne’s name is now on the secondary stadium at Roland Garros. No sensible tournament director would’ve dared to schedule her for the second-biggest anything. When Wimbledon moved to Church Road in 1922, it finally had a show court worthy of Lenglen and her tribe. Fans lined up a mile deep to see her on the new Centre Court.\n\n* * *\n\nThat first year at Church Road, Lenglen won her fourth consecutive Wimbledon singles title. She beat Molla Mallory 6-2, 6-0 in less than half an hour. One newspaper said that the Norwegian-American “played shrewdly, courageously and probably as well as she ever played.” For 26 minutes.\n\nMost of Suzanne’s match reports go something like that. She came, she saw, she obliterated.\n\nThree post-war matches stand out. Between them, they tell us as much about La Divine as all those double-bagel victories combined.\n\nFirst, the 1919 Wimbledon Challenge Round. The Lenglens elected to skip Wimbledon in 1914, fearing that Suzanne wasn’t quite ready to handle grass courts. The next four editions were canceled, so anticipation had reached its shrubbery-trampling level by 1919. The young Frenchwoman delivered as promised, winning her first match 6-0, 6-1, and taking the all-comer’s final against Phyllis Satterthwaite with the loss of just two games.\n\nIn those days, the previous year’s champion–the “holder”–advanced directly to the final, known as the Challenge Round. The woman who advanced through the all-comer’s draw would take on the holder for the title. 40-year-old Dorothea Lambert Chambers had won Wimbledon seven times, and she waited in the 1919 Challenge Round on the strength of her 1914 title.\n\nLambert Chambers represented the corsetted, baselining old guard with aplomb. The “solid magnificence of her driving”–according to the London Times–was enough to keep her even with Lenglen for most of a marathon battle. Lenglen fought off a set point to win the opener, 10-8. In the second set, Suzanne approached the net a bit too recklessly and committed a few uncharacteristic double faults. Lambert Chambers took the second, 6-4.\n\nLenglen recovered in the third after her parents tossed a small vial of cognac and she borrowed a linesman’s chair for a brief rest. The “scientific accuracy” of the ladies continued. Lambert Chambers aimed to break down Suzanne’s strength, peppering her forehand. The Frenchwoman attacked her opponent’s backhand, always looking for an opening to move forward. The challenger’s only weakness was a bit of overexcitement. While Lambert Chambers gave her groundstrokes a margin of safety, Lenglen often saw her own drives land a few inches beyond the baseline.\n\nThe defending champion earned two match points. Suzanne saved both, the first with a lunging volley off the frame of her racket. The youngster finally pulled ahead in the 16th game, winning the final set and the championship, 10-8, 4-6, 9-7.\n\nNot bad for Suzanne’s first-ever tournament on grass.\n\nAny lingering doubts about Lenglen’s stature–or, let’s be honest, her divinity–were put to rest a year later. In the 1920 Challenge Round, she faced Lambert Chambers again. It wasn’t so complicated this time. Suzanne defended her title, 6-3, 6-0.\n\n* * *\n\nThe second critical match was her one post-war loss. La Divine made her first trip to the United States in 1921, nominally to stage some exhibition matches for the benefit of French war victims.\n\nNothing went right. She was ill, and her trip was delayed. Her father didn’t make the trip at all. Instead of arriving in America with time play a few matches and get a feel for the different turf and balls in use across the Atlantic, she docked just a few days before the US National Championships began.\n\nSome players would’ve been unaffected. Suzanne was not one of them. Her defining characteristic–perhaps even more than her impeccable play–was her nervous fragility. Jackie Smyth, in his biography of Jean Borotra, wrote that she was “very highly strung and lived on her nerves–and sometimes on a little drop of cognac at times of crisis.”\n\n(As fans discovered during the 1919 Challenge Round, a sip of cognac could work wonders. In 1921, prohibition was in force: Alcohol sales were illegal in the United States. Suzanne wasn’t about to forego a daily glass of wine, much less a necessary on-court fortification. Her visit was so important that the USLTA made arrangements for the authorities to look the other way.)\n\nDraws were not yet seeded in 1921. Lenglen pulled US top-tenner Eleanor Goss in the first round and–the worst luck of all–five-time American champion Molla Mallory in the second. Goss withdrew, possibly as part of a coordinated strategy to ratchet up the pressure on Lenglen. The Forest Hills committee scheduled the Lenglen-Mallory match as early as possible.\n\nMolla came out swinging, and Lenglen was unusually passive. Midway through the first set, Suzanne began coughing. After Mallory won the first set, 6-2, the visitor looked even weaker. Lenglen appeared fit enough to play, just not well. Certainly not to her usual standard. She elected to retire from the match without completing a game in the second set.\n\nIt was Suzanne’s one post-war loss as an amateur. The ensuing war of words lasted far longer than the single set the two champions contested. Lenglen was seen on the East Coast social circuit, often dancing the night away as long as she remained in the country. But her health seemed to betray her whenever a match beckoned. She never did play the promised exhibitions.\n\nThe papers dubbed her “cough-and-quit.” Americans celebrated their adopted champion Mallory, who went on to win her sixth Forest Hills title. The French, for their part, commissioned a report from a friendly physician to attest to Suzanne’s infirmity.\n\nThe Forest Hills episode illustrated the one weakness of La Divine. Lambert Chambers later said that the outcome of the 1919 Challenge Round was doubly tragic. For her, it meant the end of her reign as champion. For Lenglen, it meant impossibly high standards, expectations of invincibility that no human could meet. When things occasionally did go wrong, she withdrew from tournaments–though never again, for the remainder of her amateur career, in the middle of a match.\n\nAs much as those no-shows garnered headlines, they remained few and far between. And Suzanne never forgot Molla’s abbreviated win. The next year, when she dispatched Mallory at Wimbledon in 26 minutes, I can only imagine her shots carried a little extra sting.\n\n* * *\n\nSuzanne, like any great performer, saved the best for last. The third defining clash of her career was more than just that, it was the Match of the Century.\n\nLenglen spent most of her amateur career as the undisputed queen of tennis. How could she be anything else, when she won every match she played? Women like Kitty McKane Godfree, Elizabeth Ryan, and Phyllis Satterthwaite piled up victories against the field, then struggled to win more than a game or two against Suzanne. Godfree lost to La Divine in the 1925 Wimbledon semi-finals, 6-0, 6-0. Leslie Godfree said that his wife had never played better.\n\nHelen Wills was the one woman with the potential to knock Suzanne off her perch. The slugging Californian won the US title every year from 1923 to 1925. When Lenglen skipped the 1924 Paris Olympics, Wills waltzed to the singles gold medal.\n\nA clash between the two was inevitable, but neither woman was in a rush. Lenglen’s withdrawals from Wimbledon and the Olympics in 1924 raised eyebrows. Wills didn’t go to Europe in 1925.\n\nHelen made the trip to the French Riviera in 1926. Suzanne remained cagey, opting to play only doubles in some early events. At last, at the Cannes Carlton Club tournament in February, both women progressed to the final. Lenglen lost just two games in four matches to get there; Wills dropped only five.\n\nThe anticipation–even before it was clear that the ladies would face off in Cannes–was intense. Reporters from around the world descended on the Riviera. They hounded the 20-year-old Wills, who had the good sense to remain silent. It was as much a cultural and political event as a sporting one. France felt hard done by in their post-war economic slump, and to some, America was the prime bully. La belle Suzanne was the pride of their nation, the artist who would prove the country’s superiority over the upstart Americans.\n\nWhen the match finally took place, the sleepy coastal resort was overrun. A half-built grandstand was mobbed. The demand for news–anything–was unceasing. Sitting in the crowd waiting for the match to begin, Tom Topping of the Associated Press dispatched messengers with updates as fast as he could write them, aiming to get the latest developments in American papers before morning editions were put to bed.\n\nThe contest did not disappoint. Lenglen took the first set, 6-3. It was evident that Wills was the harder hitter of the two, though she didn’t quite possess Suzanne’s variety. The Frenchwoman discovered that Wills was hesitant to hit her backhand down the line and that she wasn’t fast enough to chase down the best drop shots.\n\nStill, things were tight enough to merit a sip of cognac during the interval.\n\nHelen raced to a 3-1 lead in the second, but she gave back the break when she opted to play more conservatively. Lenglen finally broke again at 5-all, and she earned two match points on her own serve. On the first, a long rally ended when a Wills forehand was called out. Both women ran to the net to shake hands, but it was only another twist. The linesman clarified that the ball was in; a spectator had made the out call.\n\n(How exhaustively was this match covered? We know the names of all the line umpires. The man who made the critical correction was Lord Charles Hope, one of only three linesmen who doesn’t merit a Wikipedia page. When he wasn’t officiating monumental tennis matches, Lord Hope was an amateur golf champion.)\n\nIf ever there were a moment for La Divine’s nerves to collapse entirely, it was now. She hung on, but barely. Wills won the next three points to reach 6-all. Lenglen recovered to win a ten-point game for 7-6, then allowed Wills two chances to break back, one of them by double-faulting at deuce. Finally, on her third match point, another drop shot won the day. Suzanne squeaked it out, 6-3, 8-6.\n\nA couple of hours later, the two women faced off again in the doubles final. Armed with a stronger partner, Lenglen won again, 6-4, 8-6.\n\nThe two women never again met on a tennis court.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Match of the Century was the beginning of the end for Suzanne. She didn’t play another singles match on the Riviera. In April she went to Rome, where she won a title without the loss of a single game. In Paris, she won her sixth French championship. She dropped only four games in five matches.\n\nAt Wimbledon, though, it all came apart. She was nervous, she was ill, she was peeved that the French federation insisted she play with a countrywoman instead of her usual sidekick Elizabeth Ryan. Due to a scheduling mix-up, Lenglen didn’t appear on court when expected, and she gave the impression that she snubbed the Queen. She withdrew after two rounds, and she would never play an amateur match again.\n\nInstead, Suzanne accepted an offer to turn pro. American promoter C.C. Pyle didn’t know anything about tennis, but he knew how to sell a superstar. Pyle signed up a troupe of standout players, including Vinnie Richards, to tour North America. Facing Lenglen would be Mary Browne, the former national champion who Suzanne discarded in the French final a few months earlier.\n\nLa Divine’s return to the States was a sensation. Opening night in New York City was a gala event, with everyone from politicians to Broadway stars to Bill Tilden in attendance. Lenglen allowed the challenger just three games, an indication of what was to come.\n\nLike the professional tours that would follow for the next four decades, it was considerably different from what Suzanne was used to. They made 25 appearances in two months. Pyle had promised Lenglen that she’d never be asked to play on consecutive nights. That lasted about seven weeks, until it was suddenly crucial to perform in Wichita the night after an exhibition in Kansas City. By December, Suzanne was sufficiently worn out to walk away from a match in Portland, Oregon after winning the first set, 11-9.\n\nShe ultimately played about 40 professional singles matches, collected a sizeable sum for her efforts, and faded–as much as a divinity could–into obscurity.\n\n* * *\n\nSo, uh, 14th?\n\nI get it. It’s unimaginable to consider Suzanne Lenglen the 14th greatest anything. Detractors might call her ugly, they might call her a showboat, they might even call her a quitter. But it never would’ve occured to her worst enemy to call her number fourteen.\n\nIt’s like calling Albert Einstein history’s 14th best physicist. Maybe it’s true. I have no idea. But it sure doesn’t sound right.\n\nThe Tennis 128 lives by the algorithm, and alas, we die by the algorithm. Suzanne’s competition was generally weak, and her career was short. None of this is her fault, but the fact remains that she rarely proved herself against top-level competition.\n\nI did make some allowances. Elo will never capture the dominance of a player who wins literally every match. After she went 179-0, the formula could give us a lower bound of her abilities, but no more. I devised a method a few years ago to estimate Elo ratings for this sort of undefeated stretch. At the time, I was thinking about Rafael Nadal on clay. Lenglen’s case is similar. This alternative approach gives her a rating around 2,500 in 1923–one of the highest peaks of all time, if not quite on par with the very best of the Open era. She was in the neighborhood of 2,400 for much of the 1920s. Still, an algorithm’s output is only as good as its input, and Suzanne was hardly challenged for much of her reign. There was no Evert to her Navratilova.\n\nThe legend, however, never dimmed. It still hasn’t, even if fewer aficionados stop to give her a thought. After La Divine’s professional debut, Ring Lardner wrote, “It is obvious to everyone, even the experts, that Miss Wills would never beat Miss Lenglen if they were ever to meet in years to come.”\n\nPhyllis Satterthwaite once noticed that Suzanne, unlike most of her victims, never looked like she was exerting herself. Her whole body was as relaxed as her arm, and she avoided “that dreaded ‘tennis face'” that revealed the strain of competition.\n\nHow did she make it all look so easy? “I try to hit the ball with all my force,” she said, “and send it where my opponent is not.”\n\nI’m counting down the 128 best players of the last century. It’s like an advent calendar, only I keep the chocolate.\n\n* * *\n\nKen Rosewall [AUS]\n\nBorn: 2 November 1934\n\nCareer: 1950-80\n\nPlays: Right-handed (one-handed backhand)\n\nPeak rank: 1 (1961)\n\nMajor singles titles: 8 (15 pro majors)\n\nTotal singles titles: 147\n\n* * *\n\nKen Rosewall was always defined by his backhand. For much of his career, you’d hear experts proclaim it was the best shot off that wing since Don Budge. By the 1970s, fans started to whisper the unthinkable–maybe Rosewall’s was even better.\n\nNot all backhands serve the same purpose. Rosewall, a 142-pounder standing a mere five-feet, seven-inches tall, lacked the physical tools to deliver the sledgehammer that came naturally to Budge. The Aussie’s famous one-hander wasn’t a notably heavy ball; he even struck it with a bit of underspin.\n\nNo, Rosewall’s backhand wouldn’t knock you down. Despite spending three decades holding his own against heavyweights like Lew Hoad, Richard González, and John Newcombe, he didn’t have a single offensive weapon that could compare with the body blows those men took for granted. His serve was a merely functional delivery, and his forehand paled next to those of his hard-hitting peers. If he was beating you–and he probably was–the backhand was the obvious explanation.\n\nRod Laver knew his game as well as anyone. The two undersized Australians faced off at least 164 times. “His backhand was readable,” Laver wrote, “but it was always so deep and accurate that unless you got to it and returned it solidly you were in trouble.” Fred Stolle, for his part, didn’t point to any particular weapon. He considered Rosewall’s strongest weapon to be his focus. “The pressure was on you every second,” Stolle said, “because you knew that when you hit a bad shot he would make you pay without fail.”\n\nThe more you hear what rivals said about the Rosewall game, the less the backhand–uncannily precise as it was–seems like the determining factor in his greatness. González thought that Ken’s forehand, taken on the rise, was similarly effective. Stolle said he would trade any one of his shots for the Rosewall forehand.\n\nRosewall’s serve was his apparent weakness. But like his backhand, it was unerringly accurate. During one critical match in 1971, he earned a few cheap points when his"
