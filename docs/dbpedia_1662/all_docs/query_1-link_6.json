        "text": "This is my eighth (and likely final) installment of the COVID-19 sports reflection lists that have become so popular on this blog. To read the previous three articles in this anthology, you can click on the following links: the greatest college football regular season games by year, the greatest college football postseason games by year, the greatest Wake Forest games by year, NCAA tournament upset analysis, ranking every NCAA tournament, the greatest NCAA tournament games by year, and greatest men’s tennis match by year. I just finished with my list of greatest men’s matches of all-time so it is only right that I also do the same for the ladies, especially since women’s tennis reigns supreme in popularity amongst all female sports relative to their male counterparts.\n\nI have scoured the internet, as well as other sources, and have not find anyone that has compiled a thorough list of the best tennis match of every year from the first grand slam in 1884 to today. There have been many rankings of the greatest matches of all-time (Bleacher Report, Tennis Predict, The Top Tens, Sports Retriever, Steve Flink’s well-written book, and USA Today) which I have utilized in my analysis, but no one to my knowledge, has actually selected the best match for every year women’s mainstream tennis has been played, like you will see below.\n\nI established a few ground rules going into this, and the biggest one is that grand slam matches are so much more meaningful that other tour matches that the list is almost entirely composed of matches played in the four majors. I also took into account several factors when determining which match was truly the best for a particular year, including the match’s significance in determining the ultimate tournament champion (finals inherently mean more), the improbability of the final outcome, and the overall excitement of the match. Without further ado, here is my selection for the match of the year for every year women’s tennis has been played. The matches in bold I have listed are my selections for the best of that particular decade, and as always feel free to comment or debate.\n\nAn epic battle of sisters decides the inaugural Wimbledon title (portrait of match pictured above). These two were the most dominant tennis sisters until the Williams came along over 100 years later.\n\nWatson gets knocked off in the first round a year after losing to her sister in the final.\n\nWatson clearly had a pension for losing tight matches as she loses the match of the tournament for the third straight year at Wimbledon, this time to the eventual champion Hillyard (pictured above).\n\nThe first US women’s national championships were won by Hansell (pictured at her hall of fame induction ceremony years later) who had to overcome this one set to love deficit to just make the final.\n\nTownsend (pictured above) becomes the second US women’s national champion by surviving this semifinal scare.\n\nHillyard wins her second of six Wimbledon singles titles by saving three match points while down 3-5 in the second set.\n\nRice (pictured above), the previous year’s runner-up, won this one in a run away fashion, but even though it wasn’t close, the match was historic as Rice is credited with inventing the overhead smash by using it effectively on championship point.\n\nThe Brit Cahill becomes the first foreign champion of this tournament with an impressive win over the tourney’s defending champion and FDR’s first cousin.\n\nCahill successfully defends her title with this dramatic five set victory (yes, the women played best of five sets in this tournament at this time) over the 17 year old American.\n\nThese two superstars of earlier women’s tennis square off in a tight three set war.\n\nHellwig (pictured above), who later became president of the Daughters of the American Revoluation, won her only grand slam singles crown with this triumphant five set victory over Terry.\n\nCooper (pictured above) survives two tight sets to win the first of her five Wimbledon titles.\n\nEven though Pickering (pictured above) would eventually lose the final to the defending champ Cooper, this come from behind victory was undoubtedly the match of the tournament.\n\nThese five set women’s finals, which the US Open had for several years, had to have been quite entertaining to watch. This was Atkinson’s second of three US Open singles crowns.\n\nAtkinson (pictured above) survived five match points in the fifth set to win her third and final US National Championship title.\n\nHillyard survives two tight sets en route to her fifth Wimbledon title.\n\nPowerhouse matchup between two women who won a total of 11 Wimbledon titles. Hillyard edges Cooper in this one giving her the 6-5 edge in all-time Wimbledon singles titles. However, Cooper would get revenge on Hillyard and beat her in the Wimbledon Ladies Final the following year (pictured above).\n\nMoore had to win back-to-back five setters to clinch this title. This was the first and the most impressive of those victories since she had to come back from two sets to love down.\n\nThe Irish Open was considered as big as Wimbledon in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s. Martin (pictured above) won this edition of the event by outlasting Durlacher, who was runner-up in this event four different times.\n\nDouglass (pictured above) wins the first of her seven Wimbledon singles titles with this three set win over Thomson.\n\nThomson loses the match of the tournament for the second consecutive year as Morton wins two 8-6 sets en route to a trip to the All Comers’ Final.\n\nThe legendary Hillyard, who won her first Wimbledon 19 years prior to this match, drops a three set heartbreaker to Wilson .\n\nEven though Dorothea Douglas got the best of her in the final, Cooper won the match of the tourney with this come from behind victory over future World War I hero Toupie Lowther.\n\nNeely (pictured above) survives a rough first set to come back and win this three setter en route to her first and only US Open singles finals appearance.\n\nFuture hall of famer Wagner (pictured above) gets the best of Neely in this tight 3 setter.\n\nGarfit (pictured above) completes an Irish Open three-peat with this epic two set victory.\n\nLamplough (pictured above), the 1908 Olympic gold medalist, beat Denmark’s first female Olympian in a tight three setter.\n\nHotchkiss founded the Wightman Cup a few years later as a tennis administrator, but as a player in 1911, she won her third straight US Open in dramatic fashion.\n\nThis was by far Browne’s (pictured above) toughest test en route to the first of three straight US Open titles.\n\nMcNair (pictured above), overcomes a goose egg in the first set, to take out the five-time singles champion en route to her only Wimbledon finals appearance.\n\nBrowne wins her third straight US Open final despite getting blown out in the second set.\n\nBjurstedt (pictured above) wins her second consecutive three set match to win the first of her four straight US Open titles.\n\nThese two women combined for a total of three runner-up finishes at the US Open without winning a title. Raymond (pictured above) won this duel but was then blasted by Bjurstedt in the final.\n\nThis was the only tight 3 set match on the entire grand slam calendar that year as all other major tournaments were cancelled due to the World War.\n\nThe Norwegian wins her fourth consecutive US Open final with this victory over the doubles specialist Goss.\n\nAmazingly, Lenglen never lost a match at Wimbledon in her entire career. This was her biggest scare as she has to fight off two match points to come out victorious.\n\nThe four-time champ Bjurdstedt survives a three set quarterfinal scare from the woman who would later become the first female player to turn professional. Bjurdstedt (pictured above) would go on to win her 5th of 8 US Open singles crowns a few days later.\n\nBjurdstedt overcomes a set deficit to claim her sixth title US national championship in seven years.\n\nSeventeen years after becoming the first American to win Wimbledon in 1905, Sutton (pictured above) turns back the clock in this epic quarterfinal performance.\n\nMolesworth (pictured above) won the first two Aussie Open women’s crowns in ’22 and ’23 and this was by far her toughest test in either tourney.\n\nThe 19 year old Willis would go on to dominate the next decade of tennis, but the Brit McKane (pictured above) denied her her very first grand slam title with this come from behind three set victory.\n\nAkhurst (pictured above) wins the first of her five straight Aussie Open women’s titles with this come from behind victory in which she lost more games than she won.\n\nThe match of the century, as it has been called, featured a meeting between two of the world’s all-time great players that had been hyped up for over three years. Pre-match photo is pictured above.\n\nThe South African Peacock (pictured above) never won a grand slam time, but she reached the French Open Final in 1927 thanks to this epic three set victory.\n\nThe Brit Bennett (pictured above) plays in the match of the year for the second consecutive French Open. This time she comes out victorious en route to a surprise run to the title match as an 8 seed.\n\nMcIlquan (pictued above), the hometown Brit, stuns the two seed here to open the door for Helen Willis to roll to her third straight Wimbledon title.\n\nAkhurst wins her fifth Aussie Open crown in six years with this narrow three set victory.\n\nButtsworth (pictured above) upsets the 2 seed in the semis and then the top seed Crawford in the final to win the first of her back to back Aussie Open crowns.\n\nBabcock would lose her only grand slam finals appearance to the dominant Helen Jacobs, but this epic comeback win got her there.\n\nWillis (pictured above) takes home her sixth Wimbledon crown in this surprisingly tight match against the up and coming Brit that would soon win three grand slam titles of her own.\n\nWillis takes home her sixth Wimbledon crown in this surprisingly tight match against the up and coming Brit that would soon won three grand slam titles of her own.\n\nRound overcomes her loss to the legend Willis the year prior and beats another legend in Jacobs to win her first grand slam title.\n\nNearly a decade after losing the match of the century, Willis plays another all-time epic and this time she comes out on top despite facing a match point at 5-3 in the third set. Post match photo pictured above.\n\nSperling came two games away from pulling off this incredible upset and becoming the first Dane to win Wimbledon. Instead, the country is still searching for its first title at the All England Club.\n\nThis was the fifth straight Ladies Wimbledon final to be decided in a tight third set. Post-match handshake is posted above.\n\nThe always controversial Marble (pictured above) won tight three setters in both the quarters and semis en route to her second US Open crown.\n\nMarble comes out victorious in this marathon by winning a final game that featured seven deuces.\n\nThis 18-16 second set will stand as the longest set in Aussie Open ladies history thanks to the advent of the new third set tiebreaker rules. The winner Hardcastle is pictured above.\n\nAn aging Jacobs still shows she has the game and the stamina to survive win an 11-9 second set in this matchup between two top five seeds.\n\nBetz (pictured above) wins the first of her five grand slam singles crowns by winning back to back three setters in the semifinals and final.\n\nA rematch of the previous year’s US Open final produces the same narrow three set victory for Betz.\n\nBetz survives an epic quarterfinal scare en route to her third straight US Open crown.\n\nPalfrey (pictured above) comes from behind to win the second of her two grand slam titles. Both championships were U.S. Open titles accomplished by beating Pauline Betz in the finals and this victory ended Betz’s three year reign of terror in this tournament.\n\nOsborne (pictured above) wins the first French Open held in seven years due to World War II thanks to this narrow victory over fellow American and world # 1 Pauline Betz.\n\nThe Women’s French Championships returned from World War II with a bang as the final featured a tight three setter for the second consecutive year. The winner Todd is pictured above.\n\nOsborne upsets the top seed to win the first of her three straight US Open titles. The 15-13 third set was and still is the longest set in a US Open Final.\n\nBrough gets revenge for her heartbreaking US Open loss to Osborne in ’48 with this thrilling three set win. The post-match photo is pictured above.\n\nBrough (pictured above) wins her sixth grand slam title and only Aussie Open crown with this narrow victory over her fellow American Hart. This was truly the glory period for US women’s tennis as Americans won ten straight majors from mid-1948 to the end of 1950.\n\n“Little Mo”, as Connolly (pictured above) was called, wins her first of nine grand slam singles championships with this win in which she had to overcome a 6-1 beatdown in the second set.\n\nLittle Mo barely avoids what would have been one of the greatest upsets in women’s tennis history en route to her first of three straight Wimbledon titles.\n\nThis was the most compelling matchup in this great 1950’s tennis rivalry. Post-match photo pictured above.\n\nHart (pictured above) completes the career grand slam by exacting revenge on Brough who beat her in the Aussie Open final and match of the year in 1950.\n\nThe Brit Mortimer (pictured above) drops the first set 6-2 before coming back and winning two tight sets to claim her first of three grand slam titles.\n\nCarter knocks off the two time Aussie Open champ to claim her first grand slam title in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe Brim Bloomer, who is still alive and is pictured above in 2017, wins her only grand slam title by surviving this three set war in the semis.\n\nGibson wins her fifth and final grand slam title with a come from behind victory over her doubles partner and up and coming star Darlene Hard. Both women are pictured above with the Wimbledon doubles championship trophy from the year prior.\n\nThe Brit Truman (pictured above) comes from behind en route to her only grand slam title.\n\nThe American Hard had to play second fiddle to Althea Gibson for much of the late 50’s but here she breaks through to win her first US Open title by knocking off the top seed in three close sets. Post-match photo pictured above.\n\nMortimer comes from behind to win her final grand slam title in what was the last all-Brit singles final on either the men or women’s side at Wimbledon. Post-match photo pictured above.\n\nCourt (pictured above) wins her first slam outside her home country of Australia with this three set win. Turner, who entered the tourney as a 13 seed, almost knocked off the top two seeds in the tourney back to back as she beat the # 1 seed Ann Hayden in the semis.\n\nTurner (pictured above) avenges her heartbreaking loss in the previous year’s French Open final by winning this equally tight 3 setter and claiming her first of two French Open crowns.\n\nThe Brazilian Bueno knocks off the defending champ to win the last of her three Wimbledon titles.\n\nCourt holds off King in this battle of tennis legends who didn’t like each other much. This was the first closely contested final between the two.\n\nBueno wins her fourth and final US Open crown in ’66 thanks to this nail-biting semifinal win over rising star Rosie Casals.\n\nDurr secures her only grand slam title in her home country with her third 3 set win in the final. Post-match photo pictured above.\n\nThe seven seeded Tegart comes up just short in her best chance to win a grand slam by losing two narrowly decided sets against the two-time defending champion King.\n\nThe Aussie Court knocks off the defending champ Richey en route to her third French Open title.\n\nIn the world before tiebreakers, each set could potentially go on forever. Court squeaked out both of these tight, long sets en route to the first woman to win a Grand Slam in the open era.\n\nCourt wins her tenth Aussie Open title by surviving this battle with fellow countrywoman Goolagong.\n\nIn a battle of future icons in the sport, Goolagong outlasts Evert in a tight three setter before dropping the final to Billie Jean King. Both women are pictured above.\n\nCourt wins her fifth and final French Open title over future superstar Chris Evert.\n\nKing denies Goolagong a career gland slam with this come from behind victory, which would end up being King’s final U.S. Open triumph.\n\nBoth of these women were involved in so many classic grand slam matches in the 1970’s that it is only fitting they played another epic match against each other in this US Open Final.\n\nThe first meeting between these two superstars at the All-England Club.\n\nWade earns her place in tennis history by coming from a set down to become the last British woman to win Wimbledon, and to make it even sweeter the Queen of England was in attendance.\n\nThe first and closest of five Wimbledon finals played between these two archrivals. Navritalova would go on to win all five of those meetings.\n\nRichards (pictured above) becomes the first and only transgender athlete to win a match at a grand slam singles event with this tight victory over the legendary Mary Carillo.\n\nChrissy cruised to her fourth French Open crown by dominating all her competition, except for this shockingly close third round scare.\n\nThis epic match marked the first time these two rivals had ever met in the Aussie Open.\n\nEvert simultaneously completes the career grand slam and exacts revenge from last year’s title match with this three set victory over her arch rival.\n\nMartina didn’t drop a single set en route to her second Aussie Open crown except during this scare from the upset-minded eight seed (pictured above).\n\nMartina wins her sixth straight major title by overcoming a one set deficit to beat her arch rival Evert.\n\nThis was the last of Evert’s truly epic wins over her arch rival.\n\nIn a rare matchup of two of the greatest women’s tennis players of all-time, the up and coming star Graf falls just short of beating the eventual champion Navritalova. Martina became the first woman in the open era to win the US Open after saving a match point with this narrow victory.\n\nGraf gets revenge for her loss in the 1986 match of the year by beating Navritalova in another three set war between the two.\n\nThe last grand slam meeting played between these two bitter rivals ended up being one of their best matches ever at the All-England Club.\n\nVicario ends Graf’s run of five straight major titles by overcoming a 3-5 third set deficit.\n\nGarrison picks up the win of her career in this stunning upset of Graf, ending Steffi’s record run of 13 straight grand slam finals appearances. This upset enabled Navritalova to win one final major title two days later when she took care of the upstart Garrison in the final.\n\nYoung Capriati’s best chance at winning a slam is dashed in a 3rd set tiebreak. It would be nine long years before J-Cap would reach the semis of a slam again.\n\nThis was Seles’ biggest career win over her arch rival.\n\nOne of the most legendary Wimbledon finals ever, as Novotna blows a 4-1 third set lead and ends up crying on the Duchess of Kent’s shoulder (pictured above) during the trophy presentation. The story has a happy ending though because the Duchess told her that day that she would win Wimbledon one day, and her words proved prophetic when Novotna won this title in 1998.\n\nOne of the greatest upsets in tennis history, as the unseeded McNeil stuns the top seed and defending champ Graf, marking the only time in the open era that a defending Wimbledon singles champ (man or woman) lost in the first round of the following Wimbledon.\n\nGraf wins riveting final by breaking Vicario’s serve at 5-5 in the 3rd set in a game featuring 13 deuces.\n\nGraf surpasses Evert and Navritalova for the most women’s grand slam singles titles with this thrilling victory over rival Vicario.\n\nThis was the official coming out party for the Williams’ sisters, as Venus became the first unseeded player to advance to the US Open Final with this narrow win in which Spirlea controversially bumped Venus during a change over.\n\nIn this battle between heroes of different generations, the veterar Vicario beats the rookie Serena en route to Vicario’s last grand slam title.\n\nUp a set and a break, a controversial call and subsequent code violation lead to Hingis’ collapse.\n\nThese two generational superstars hooked up for an epic three set match en route to Venus’ first US Open title.\n\nCapriati wins her second consecutive grand slam title by outlasting the Belgian Clijsters who was playing in her first grand slam final.\n\nCapriati wins her third and final slam of her career with one of the greatest comebacks in women’s tennis history as she trailed Hingis by a set and faced an 0-4 deficit in the second and then came back to win despite facing four match points.\n\nHenin denied the Capriati her best shot at reaching a US Open final with this come from behind victory.\n\nAn incredible upset full of incredible controversy as the chair umpire, Ted Watts, loses track of the score in the second set tiebreaker giving Sprem the extra point needed to eventually win the match.\n\nSerena avenges her 2004 Wimbledon final loss to Maria with this comeback victory en route to her second of sevenAussie Open titles. Maria would never beat Serena again in her entire career, losing the next 17 matchups between the two.\n\nMauresmo becomes the first French female to win Wimbledon since Suzanne Lenglen in 1925 with this come from behind victory that denied Henin a career grand slam.\n\nSerena wins this marathon over the 16 seeded Israeli en route to her eighth grand slam title. Interestingly, Serena came into the tournament unseeded as she was returning from a long layoff after an injury.\n\nIvanovic outlasts fellow countrywoman Jankovic in this all-Serbian semi en route to Ivanovic’s only grand slam title. Sadly, Jankovic never won a grand slam and many consider this tourney to have been her best chance.\n\nThe biggest win in Oudin’s spectacular Cinderella US Open run in 2009. Unfortunately, Melanie was never really heard from again after this tourney.\n\nClijsters comes back from a set down on rival Venus to win her second consecutive US Open.\n\nThis four hour and forty-four minute marathon was and still is the longest grand slam match in women’s tennis history.\n\nSerena overcome a 5-3 third set deficit to win the first three set US Open women’s final in 17 years.\n\nThe 23rd seeded Lisicki stuns the top seed and defending champion en route to a Cinderella run to the finals in Sabine’s final Wimbledon.\n\nMaria wins the fifth and final slam of her career with this narrow victory over future star Halep.\n\nSerena’s bid at a calendar year grand slam came to a crashing halt with this incredible upset.\n\nKerber wins her first grand slam by ending Serena’s spectacular run of eight straight major finals victories. She also became the first player to win a slam in the open era after saving a match point in her first round match.\n\nThe Latvian concludes her Cinderella run at Roland Garros with a narrow three set victory, becoming the first unseeded player to win a women’s French Open title since 1933.\n\nWozniacki wins the only grand slam of her lengthy career with a nail-biting upset of the tourney’s top seed.\n\nOsaka blows three championship points in the second set but then regroups to take the title in the third and also lay claim to the title of world’s # 1 player.\n\nRogers continues a Cinderella US Open run with this stunning 4th Round victory in which she saved four match points.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nLike I did for the men a few weeks ago, I have conducted some additional analysis to see which tournaments have held the most matches of the year/decade. The charts below depict those results. On the men’s side, Wimbledon dominated the field by hosting almost twice as many matches of the year as any other tournament. The same could not be said for the ladies, however, as the United States Open lays claim to the most matches of the year all-time. Interestingly, though, Wimbledon still had a firm grasp on the most matches of the decade as they have hosted nine of these fourteen matches.\n\nThe final analysis I conducted was the match of the year by player. This is an important analysis because I feel like my results accurately reflect tennis’ most iconic players. It is one thing to roll over competition to win several grand slams like the Williams’ sisters did in the early 2000’s, but the most memorable and iconic players are the ones who won a multitude of classic matches like the ones featured on this list. You will see that atop this list stands one of America’s most recognizable women’s tennis players, Chris Evert.\n\nI have decided that I am going to do one more additional Covid-19 reflection list and that is going to be the best golf tournament by year. Be on the look out for that article, in the coming months!"
