Douglas, a first - term Democratic senator from Illinois, was designed to solve the controversy over the status of slavery in the vast new territories acquired from Mexico. Many pro - slavery Southerners opposed it, and Calhoun helped organize preparations for the Nashville Convention, which would meet that summer to discuss the possibility of Southern secession. The nearly 68 - year old Calhoun had suffered periodic bouts of tuberculosis throughout his life. In March 1850, the disease reached a critical stage. Weeks from death and too feeble to speak, Calhoun wrote a blistering attack on the compromise that would become likely his most famous speech. On March 4, a friend, Senator James Mason of Virginia, read the remarks. Calhoun affirmed the right of the South to leave the Union in response to Northern subjugation. He warned that the day \" the balance between the two sections \" was destroyed would be a day not far removed from disunion, anarchy, and civil war. Calhoun queried how the Union might be preserved in light of subjugation by the \" stronger \" party against the \" weaker \" one. He maintained that the responsibility of solving the question lay entirely on the North â as the stronger section, to allow the Southern minority an equal share in governance and to cease the agitation. He added : Calhoun died soon afterwards, and although the compromise measures did eventually pass, Calhoun's ideas about states'rights attracted increasing attention across the South. Historian William Barney argues that Calhoun's ideas proved \" appealing to Southerners concerned with preserving slavery... Southern radicals known as'Fire - Eaters'pushed the doctrine of states rights to its logical extreme by upholding the constitutional right of the state to secede. \"\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nAnkylosaurus , with its very low center of gravity and inability to knock down trees like modern elephants do, would not have been able to chew bark, so it was unlikely to have practiced bark stripping. As an adult, Ankylosaurus does not appear to have congregated in groups--though some ankylosaurs do appear to have congregated when young. So although Ankylosaurus was a very large herbivore with similar energetic requirements, it is improbable that it was able to modify the landscape of its ecosystem in the way elephants do. Hadrosaurids may instead have had such an \"ecosystem engineer\" role.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nLater Arab sources dwell extensively on the events of Yazid's 669 expedition and supposed attack on Constantinople, including various mythical anecdotes, which are taken by modern scholarship to refer to the events of the 674 â 678 siege. Several important personalities of early Islam are mentioned as taking part, such as Ibn Abbas, Ibn Umar and Ibn al - Zubayr. The most prominent among them in later tradition is Abu Ayyub al - Ansari, one of the early companions ( \" Aná¹£Är \" ) and standard - bearer of Muhammad, who died of illness before the city walls during the siege and was buried there. According to Muslim tradition, Constantine IV threatened to destroy his tomb, but the Caliph warned that if he did so, the Christians under Muslim rule would suffer. Thus the tomb was left in peace, and even became a site of veneration by the Byzantines, who prayed there in times of drought. The tomb was \" rediscovered \" after the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 by the dervish Sheikh Ak Shams al - Din, and Sultan Mehmed II ( ) ordered the construction of a marble tomb and a mosque adjacent to it. It became a tradition that Ottoman sultans were girt with the Sword of Osman at the EyÃ¼p mosque upon their accession. Today it remains one of the holiest Muslim shrines in Istanbul.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nAs only two fragments of a vertebra are known, little anatomical details can be observed. The right transverse process and prezygapophysis are preserved. The vertebra is possibly a middle dorsal, based on the angle of the transverse process and the orientation of the prezygapophysis. Similar to \" Stegosaurus \" and \" Chungkingosaurus \" mid - dorsals, the transverse process is angled about 60Âº dorsally. Unlike in all other stegosaurs except \" Stegosaurus \", the prezygapophysis faces dorsally.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\n\" Hessen \" was thereafter used as a depot ship in BrunsbÃ¼ttel for I Submarine Flotilla, along with the old coastal defense ship. While in reserve at BrunsbÃ¼ttel, \" Hessen \" was jokingly referred to as SMS \" Kleinste Fahrt \" ( SMS \" Shortest Voyage \" ) because of a warning that had been painted on the ship's hull. The ship's four 28 cm guns were re - mounted as railroad guns and employed on the Western Front. The Australian Army captured one of the guns on 8 August 1918 ; it is preserved as the Amiens Gun at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Australia.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nAfter Dumbledore's sexuality was revealed, my first response was Thank you Lord because this helps us show others that these books should not be used in the churches to illustrate Christianity Because of this, it helps me communicate my message. It helps Christians who are concerned about the use of Harry Potter books in churches because it makes it very clear that these books are not intended to be Christian. Rowling is not speaking as a Christian and has introduced values that are opposed to the Biblical message. Laura Mallory responded to Rowling's statement by telling U.S network ABC: My prayer is that parents would wake up and see the subtle way this is presented as harmless fantasy and realize that it is actually a subtle indoctrination into anti-Christian values. A homosexual lifestyle is a harmful one that is proven medically.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nReviews for \" Entertainment Weekly \", the \" Chicago Tribune \", and \" Time \" were mixed or contained qualified praise. Robert Christgau from \" The Village Voice \" said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in \" enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month \" and to compensate for how soulless the songs are, resulting in \" arid \" art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for \" The Independent : \" \" For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, \" OK Computer \" is not, finally, as impressive as \" The Bends \", which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency. \"\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nIt begins its journey in the Adirondack Park in Ticonderoga and winds its way north through rock cuts and narrow isthmus between Lakes Champlain and George. It crosses the Essex County line into the county, reaching the first settlement along its length within the Park. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars. NY 74 comes in from the ferry to the east, overlapping for almost the entire length of the concurrency before NY 74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with NY 9N. NY 22 turns right to join NY 9N, the longest suffixed route in the state. Finally, at the northern end of the concurrency, NY 74 rejoins its northerly orientation for the longest of its concurrencies.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nTrist was willing to allow Mexico to keep Baja California, as his instructions allowed, but successfully haggled for the inclusion of the important harbor of San Diego in a cession of Alta California. On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican delegation signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\n\n1\n\nt5\n\nIo's tidal heating is generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. The Laplace orbital resonance between Io and Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity, preventing tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The eccentricity leads to vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge of up to 16% of Jupiter's gravitational pull, which causes friction in Io's interior and generates enough heat to cause significant tidal heating and melting. Unlike Earth, which releases most of its internal heat by conduction through the crust, Io releases its internal heat via volcanic activity and generates the high heat flow of satellites. The observed release of heat from Io is greater than estimates for the amount presently generated from tidal heating, meaning that Io is cooling after a period of greater flexing.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nSimilar to other Naturalist works, \" The Open Boat \" scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. The struggle between man and the natural world is the most apparent theme in the work, and while the characters at first believe the turbulent sea to be a hostile force set against them, they come to believe that nature is instead ambivalent. At the beginning of the last section, the correspondent rethinks his view of nature's hostility : \" the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the individual â nature in the wind, and nature in the vision of men. She did not seem cruel to him, nor beneficent, nor treacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent. \" The correspondent regularly refers to the sea with feminine pronouns, pitting the four men in the boat against an intangible, yet effeminate, threat ; critic Leedice Kissane further pointed to the story's seeming denigration of women, noting the castaways'personification of Fate as \" an old ninny - woman \" and \" an old hen \". That nature is ultimately disinterested is an idea that appears in other works by Crane ; a poem from Crane's 1899 collection \" War is Kind and Other Lines \" also echoes Crane's common theme of universal indifference :\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nOn 19 December, French Prime Minister Ãdouard Daladier introduced his plan to the General Staff and the War Cabinet. In his plan, Daladier created linkage between the war in Finland and the iron ore in Sweden. There was a danger of Finland's possible fall under Soviet hegemony. In turn, Nazi Germany could occupy both Norway and Sweden. These two dictatorships could divide Scandinavia between them, as they had already done with Poland. The main motivation of the French and the British were to reduce the German war - making ability.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nDouglas was now faced with a situation similar to that which the English had faced before the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\n1\n\nt5\n\nOf Waugh's early books, Decline and Fall was praised by Arnold Bennett in the Evening Standard as an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire. The critical reception of Vile Bodies two years later was even more enthusiastic with Rebecca West predicting that Waugh was destined to be the dazzling figure of his age. However, A Handful of Dust later widely regarded as a masterpiece received a more muted welcome from critics despite the author's own high estimation of the work. The books ending with Tony Last condemned forever to read Dickens to his mad jungle captor was thought by the critic Henry Yorke to reduce an otherwise believable book to fantasy. Cyril Connolly's first reaction to the book was that Waughs powers were failing, but he later revised his opinion.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nSamples used on the album were taken from artists as diverse as the electronic duo Suicide and gospel choir the Alabama Sacred Harp Singers. \" Internet Connection \", one of four bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of the album, was recorded in collaboration with a group of Filipino Verizon workers. M. I. A. described the sound and imagery of the album as capturing a \" digital ruckus \", adding that \" so many of us have become typists and voyeurs \". We need a digital moshpit like we've never seen, harder than how people were doing it in the punk era. We need that energy, but digitally \". M. I. A. herself picked out \" Steppin Up \", \" Space \" and \" Teqkilla \" as her favourite tracks on the album. She said that she contemplated using only the sound of drills as the backing for \" Steppin Up \", but concluded that this was \" too experimental \" an approach.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nGibbes handed over command of No. 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19 April 1943. With his rank of squadron leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, until October. While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No. 464 Squadron RAAF, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, he gave a series of morale - building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students : \" So I, you know, went round and lied like hell. I said that it was all a piece of cake. \" In January 1944, he joined No. 2 Operational Training Unit ( OTU ) at Mildura, Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March. He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top - scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No. 2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 July. In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No. 80 Wing. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, \" a little dark - haired popsy \" named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23 January 1945.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nOn 22 June 1970, the Spanish Ministry of Defense signed an agreement of military cooperation with France, which outlined plans for the future acquisition of around 200 tanks for the Spanish Army. Of these, 180 were to be manufactured under license in Spain and 20 were to be manufactured by France. Ultimately, GIAT was contracted to manufacture 19 tanks. These were delivered to the Spanish Legion's \" Bakali \" company, deployed in the Spanish Sahara. The first six AMX - 30s were delivered by rail to the Spanish border city of IrÃºn, in the Basque Country, and then transferred to Bilbao. Finally, they were shipped by the Spanish Navy, on the transport \" Almirante Lobo \", to El AaiÃºn in the Spanish Sahara. This unit existed until 1975, when it was disbanded and its tanks transferred to the \" Uad - Ras \" Mechanized Infantry Regiment.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nAlex Paterson began his music career in the early 1980s as a roadie for the post - punk rock band Killing Joke, for whom his childhood friend Martin \" Youth \" Glover played bass. After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future KLF member Jimmy Cauty and the duo began DJ - ing and producing music together under the name \" The Orb \". Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track, \" Tripping on Sunshine \", released on the German record compilation \" Eternity Project One \". The following year, the Orb released the \" Kiss EP \", a four - track EP based on samples from New York City's KISS FM. It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label WAU! Mr. Modo Records, which they created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as \" really shit drum sounds \", the duo decided to abandon beat - heavy music and instead work on music for after - hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJ - ing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the chill out room at London nightclub Heaven. Resident DJ Paul Oakenfold brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his \" The Land of Oz \" event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill - out room act grew popular over the course of their six - month stay to the point that the room was often packed with around 100 people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and a mixer. The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as \" SueÃ±o Latino \". Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played dub and other chill - out music, which it described as ambient house for the E generation.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nA document from 1200 AD mentions a walled garden owned by the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter, Westminster.

At the time it was the custom to have geographic balance on the Supreme Court, and Baldwin had been from Pennsylvania. efforts to fill Baldwins seat became embroiled in Pennsylvania politics and the efforts of factional leaders to secure the lucrative post of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia. Because Story's death had occurred while the Senate was not in session, Tyler was able to make a recess appointment choosing Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire. When the Senate reconvened in December 1845 Woodbury was confirmed. Tyler's initial nominee for Baldwins seat, George W Woodward, was rejected by the Senate in January 1846 in large part due to the opposition of Buchanan and Pennsylvania Senator Simon Cameron.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nIn early May the PAVN launched a new offensive known as the May Offensive or'mini - Tet '.

Whether Moore wrote to Montgomery is unclear but he wrote to Spencer on May 26 advising the senator that the designs had been preliminarily approved. Commission members had suggested several changes, but these were implemented and on June 9 the Fine Arts Commission approved the design a decision communicated by letter that day to the Director of the Mint Raymond T Baker. To speed production the Medallic Art Company produced hubs from which working dies to produce the coins could be made. These hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 29 1921.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nGrant's early efforts to be recommissioned failed, rejected by Major General George B.

He was not accepted at first, but his application was forwarded to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland. There, Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1 1955. Armstrong was only at the Cleveland laboratory for a couple of months before a position became available at the High Speed Flight Station. On July 11 1955 he reported to work there. Armstrong's stint at the Cleveland laboratory lasted only a couple of months before a position became available at the High Speed Flight Station and Armstrong took it. His first day there, Armstrong was tasked with piloting chase planes during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers. On March 22 1956, Armstrong was in a Boeing B 29 Superfortress which was to air-drop a Douglas D 558 2 Skyrocket. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the left-hand seat commander Stan Butchart flew the B 29.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nBrudvig praised the campaign for avoiding the \" repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots \" of past \" Halo \" titles. GameSpot's Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non - player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for \" The Guardian \" that \" Reach \" s story made previous entries feel \" amateurish \" ; Nguyen felt that whereas previous \" Halo \" titles had become mired in inconsistencies and \" Star Trek \" - like technobabble, \" Reach \" told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time : \" I almost forgot that Noble Four ( Emile ) even existed for a big chunk of the campaign, as I rarely saw him. \" \" Wired \" s Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of \" Aliens \", writing that most of the characters were unmemorable and one - dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as \" minor quibbles \" compared to the improvements. In contrast, GamesRadar's Charlie Baratt opined that \" Reach \" s campaign was better than \" ODST \" s, but lacked the \" franchise - changing potential \" it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, \" [ \" Reach \" ] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene \".\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nAll of the Scottish captives were ordered to London, to the disgust of their captors who had a legal right to ransom them.

He campaigned for the retiring Cooper's seat in 1972, losing to Democrat Walter \" Dee \" Huddleston, a state senator who had managed Ford's campaign. His loss came despite a landslide victory for Richard Nixon in the state and was generally blamed on his advocacy of raising the sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in 1968. Democrats called him \" Nickel Nunn. \" He continued working on behalf of Republican candidates, and backed Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to incumbent Gerald Ford in 1975. His last run for office came in 1979 when he was again the Republican nominee for governor against Democrat John Y. Brown, Jr. He decried the excessive spending, expanding government, and increased state employment that had occurred under Democratic administrations. He also attacked Brown for his playboy image ( he was married to former Miss America Phyllis George ) and his refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his inexperience in government. Despite these attacks, Nunn lost by a vote of 558, 008 to 381, 278 and returned to his legal practice.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nThe federal government was unable to provide much military assistance to the settlers in Texas who were frequently raided by native tribes in 1824. Hoping that an influx of settlers could control the raids, the government appointed empresarios in 1824. However, as the number of settlers from the US and other non-Spanish-speaking areas increased in Texas, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the US might wish to annex the area. On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the US into Texas. The laws also cancelled all unfilled empresario contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties. The new laws angered both Tejanos and recent immigrants Texans. Stephen F Austin, a well-respected empresario, who had brought the first group of American settlers to Texas, warned Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante that the laws seemed designed to destroy the colonies. Texass two delegates to the state legislature both were so vocal in their opposition that one of them was expelled from the legislature. Austin was elected to fill his seat and in December 1830 he left for Saltillo.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nThe 2002 second quarter results don't include figures from our friends at Compaq.

Austin noted cuts on each side of the bow, which he thought had been caused by a sharp instrument. He found possible traces of blood on the captains sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather; citing a vial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the vial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunatos report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austins opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ships rails that might have been blood together with a deep mark, possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Floods suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery.

These windows are : \" Christ in the Temple \" in the east transept, based upon a painting by William Holman Hunt ; \" The Annunciation \" in the east nave, inspired by a work by Frederic Shields ; \" The Nativity \" in the chancel, based upon a painting by Edward Fellowes - Prynne ; and \" The Good Shepherd \" in the west transept, inspired by a painting by Sibyl C. Parker, the only female artist represented in the artwork of the church. None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required replacement after the 1906 quake, except for \" the famous rose window of the original structure \" in the organ loft which was replaced by the current large, central arch window. This window, entitled \" Lilies of the Field \", is the only window in the church that cannot be viewed from the inside because it is blocked off by the central organ. There is a cross in the center of this window made of \" faceted pieces of glass that are inset like gems \", which sparkle when light strikes it.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nThe line had labor difficulties and financial difficulties throughout its existence. Rumors of a mutiny during \" President Arthur \" s first trip were reported in \" The New York Times \", and several crew members got into an altercation with members of the Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group, when the liner made an intermediary stop in Naples. On her second voyage, the ship's master - at - arms was killed by a fellow crew member. Financial difficulties included unpaid bills and resultant court actions, and accusations of fraud against company officers that were leveled in the press. In late 1925 the company was placed in the hands of a receiver, \" President Arthur \" â after a two - alarm fire in her forward cargo hold â ended up back in the hands of the USSB, and the company's office furniture and fixtures were sold at auction in early 1926.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nOn 17 November 1906, the Daily Mail newspaper offered a 10,000 prize for the first person to fly between London and Manchester using only two stops. The challenge also specified that take-off and landing must be at locations no more than five miles from the newspapers offices in those cities. Powered flight was a relatively new invention, and the newspapers' proprietors were eager to stimulate the industry's growth. In 1908, they offered 1,000 for the first flight across the English channel - won by the French aviator Louis Blriot - and 1,000 for the first circular one mile flight made by a British aviator in a British aeroplane - won by the English aviator John Moore. In 1910, two men accepted the newspapers' 1906 challenge: an Englishman, Claude Grahame White, and a Frenchman, Louis Paulhan.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nIn 1999, after a 12 - year hiatus from touring and a seven - year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US ; though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones. The tour eventually stretched across the world and spanned three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, \" In the Flesh â Live \". During the tour, Waters played two new songs \" Flickering Flame \" and \" Each Small Candle \" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70, 000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nTo placate the Yankees'concerns about his durability, Rivera followed a strength and conditioning program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre said that he would try to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16 games in 17 opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped early in the second half ; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA ( 1. 66 ), along with 40 saves in 46 opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch - rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had one of the most memorable postseason performances of his career ; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5 â 5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh - inning walk - off home run that clinched the Yankees'series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins ; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16 innings pitched that postseason.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\n\" Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine \" published a favourable review in July 1818 ; the reviewer was impressed with the journal section : \" the perusal of it rather produces the same effect as a smart walk before breakfast, in company with a lively friend who hates long stories \".\n\n1\n\nt5\n\nRaonic is frequently described as having one of the best serves among his contemporaries.

While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Church became a consulting psychologist for the State Charities Aid Association of New York City for one year.

In this posting, he gained experience with both laboratory and practical methods of experimentation, including analyzing bronze, steel, and cast iron to determine the best materials to use in manufacturing cannons and other weapons. In addition, he gained firsthand experience with the uses and applications of several foundry machines, including forges, steam hammers, lathes, planing machines, and boring machines. His business college background in statistical analysis and engineering ( including technical drawing ) helped make him successful at testing and experimentation ; as a result of his experience at Watertown, for the rest of his career the Army frequently relied on him to oversee boards that developed and tested weapons and other equipment, and made recommendations on which items were most suitable for procurement and fielding. He was promoted to temporary first lieutenant in July 1905, and permanent first lieutenant in January 1907. In May 1907, McNair was promoted to temporary captain.

Fellow writer and producer Frank Spotnitz concurred, although he was more uncomfortable with Gilligan's idea of using videotape instead of film ; the show's production crew liked to use film to create \" effective scares \", and Spotnitz worried that shooting exclusively on videotape would be too challenging as the series would be unable to cut and edit the final product. During the show's seventh season, Carter relented. Many critics and fans believed, erroneously, that the seventh season of \" The X - Files \" would be the show's last. Similarly, Carter felt that the show had nearly run its course, and seeing the potential in Gilligan's idea, he decided to green - light the episode. Gilligan noted that \" the longer we've been on the air, the more chances we've taken. We try to keep the show fresh... I think [ Carter ] appreciates that \". \" X - Cops \" was not Gilligan's first attempt at writing a cross - over. Almost three years before, he had developed a script that would have taken the form of an \" Unsolved Mysteries \" episode, with unknown actors playing Mulder and Scully and Robert Stack appearing in his role as narrator. This script was later aborted, and re - written as the fifth - season episode \" Bad Blood \".\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\n\"The United States welcomes a greater NATO role in Iraq's stabilization,\" said Secretary of State Powell today. \"The Kearsarge class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense, and they had a displacement of an overall length of a beam of and a draft of .

Kearsarge was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men a total of 554 crew. Kearsarge had two double turrets with two 35 caliber guns and two 40 caliber guns each stacked in two levels. The guns and turret armor were designed by the Bureau of Ordnance while the turret itself was designed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair. This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret making the ports very large. Admiral William Sims claimed that as a result a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below disabling the guns. In addition to these guns, Kearsarge carried fourteen 40 caliber guns, twenty 6 pounder guns, eight 1 pounder guns, four machine guns and\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nIn August 1942, during the Partisan Long March west through the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav Partisans captured a group of eight Germans from the civil and military engineering group Organisation Todt near Livno. the leader of the captured group was Hans Ott, who was also an officer of the Abwehr, the Wehrmacht's intelligence organisation.

In 1877, the estate of nearly 2,000 acres was sold to the Manchester Freeholders Company, a property company formed expressly for the purpose of exploiting the estates potential for residential building development. The Hall and a residual park of over 50 acres were sold on by the Freeholders, though not the lordship of the manor, to the Nevill family of successful industrialists. In 1925 it was purchased by John Henry Davies and then in 1935 acquired by the local government authority for the area Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council.

She was laid down at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow - in - Furness on 6 December 1911 with yard number 425, but construction was suspended in late 1912 during the Balkan Wars and resumed in May 1913. The ship was launched on 3 September and completed in August 1914. After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June, the British postponed delivery of \" ReÅadiye \" on 21 July, despite the completion of payments and the arrival of the Ottoman delegation to collect \" ReÅadiye \" and another dreadnought battleship, \" Sultan Osman I \", after their sea trials. The First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them ; two days later, British sailors formally seized them and \" ReÅadiye \" was renamed \" Erin \", a poetical name for Ireland.

This preference varies by the bird 's location in its range; in the southernmost part of its range, it never breeds below mean sea level, but in the northernmost part of its range it often breeds near the sea. In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow prefers lighter woodland, but is sometimes found in towns and agricultural areas. In Sakhalin, it breeds mostly in riparian forest, and in Hokkaid it has greater reproductive success when found in more remote forests.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nRestored free - roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005.

As of April 2007, after another large - scale release, there were 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana Recovery Program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nCape sparrows are mainly Seed Eaters and also eat Soft Plant Parts and InSECTS. They typically breed in colonies and when not breeding, they gather in large nomadic flocks to move around in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, bush, cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch of Cape Sparrows contains 3-4 eggs and both parents are involved in breeding from nest building to feeding young. The Cape Sparrow is common in most of its range, and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the southern grey-headed Sparrow and the house Sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape Sparrows population has not been recorded decreasing significantly and it is not seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nLike salmon, steelhead return to their original hatching grounds to spawn. Similar to Atlantic salmon, but unlike their Pacific \" Oncorhynchus \" salmonid kin, steelhead are iteroparous ( able to spawn several times, each time separated by months ) and make several spawning trips between fresh and salt water, although fewer than 10 percent of native spawning adults survive from one spawning to another. The survival rate for introduced populations in the Great Lakes is as high as 70 percent. As young steelhead transition from freshwater to saltwater, a process called \" smoltification \" occurs where the trout undergoes physiological changes to allow it to survive in sea water. There are genetic differences between freshwater and steelhead populations that may account for the smoltification in steelheads.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nThe King's tomb became a popular pilgrimage site, probably encouraged by the local monks, who lacked an existing pilgrimage attraction.

He had two older brothers and a sister. Sister Gladys was 12 when Miller was born, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven respectively. Miller was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers Keith and Ross Smith, who were half - way through their historic flight from England to Australia at the time of his birth. Miller's two Christian names reflected his Scottish heritage ; his father's family originated from the dock area of Edinburgh and Dundee, and his paternal grandfather arrived in Australia in April 1849. The family lived in a one - level terrace house in Sunshine, which at the time was a separate town of 900 people, west of Melbourne's city centre. The area was and remains a working - class area. The town's lifeblood was the farm machinery maker H. V. McKay, which employed a large proportion of the population. Miller's father started as a teacher in Warracknabeal in rural Victoria, before working as an engineer for McKay in Ballarat until a transfer brought him to Sunshine.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nConstruction began on May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931 ; Arthur Bialucha, a German architect living in Qingdao who had already completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell - shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nShout enlisted in the newly formed Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 18 August 1914.

When Bottin joined the project in mid-1981 pre-production was in progress but no design had been settled on for the alien, so Ploog was hired to sketches designs. As part of the Things design, it was agreed that anyone assimilated by it would be a perfect imitation and would not know they were the Thing. The actors spent hours during rehearsals discussing whether they would know they were the Thing when taken over. Clennon said that it did not matter because everyone acted looked and smelled exactly the same before being taken over. At its peak Bottin had a 35-person crew of artists and technicians, but he found it difficult to work with so many people. To help manage the team, he hired Erik Jensen, a special effects line producer who he had worked with on The Howling . Jensen was in charge of the special make-up effects unit. Bottins crew also included mechanical aspect supervisor Dave Kelsey, make-up aspect coordinator Ken Diaz, moldmaker Gunnar Ferdinansen, and\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nInnocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed. the rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented, at least unofficially.\n\n1\n\nt5\n\nIn 1853 Bennett made his last public appearance as a soloist with orchestra in his own Fourth Piano Concerto. In the same year he declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.\n\n1\n\nt5\n\nThe 2002 second quarter results don't include figures from our friends at Compaq.

The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non - military vessels after the start of the First World War, and work had been resumed only to make her slipway available for warships. She remained at anchor for the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier. The price of Â£138, 118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her propelling machinery was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nHigh-altitude clouds, like cirrus, vary considerably with latitude. In the polar regions they are at their lowest with a minimum altitude of only to a maximum of. In tropical regions they are at their highest ranging in altitude from about to around. In temperate regions they range in altitude from to a variation in contrast to low-altitude clouds which dont appreciably change altitude with latitude.\n\n1\n\ngpt3\n\nRhodes then arrived in Cape Town to talk again with Maund. His mood was markedly different : after looking over Lobengula's message to Queen Victoria, he said that he believed the Matabele expedition to England could actually buttress the concession and associated development plans if the London syndicate would agree to merge its interests with his own and form an amalgamated company alongside him. He told Maund to wire this pitch to his employers. Maund presumed that Rhodes's shift in attitude had come about because of his own influence, coupled with the threat to Rhodes's concession posed by the Matabele mission, but in fact the idea for uniting the two rival bids had come from Knutsford, who the previous month had suggested to Cawston and Gifford that they were likelier to gain a royal charter covering south - central Africa if they joined forces with Rhodes. They had wired Rhodes, who had in turn come back to Maund. The unification, which extricated Rhodes and his London rivals from their long - standing stalemate, was happily received by both sides ; Cawston and Gifford could now tap Rhodes's considerable financial and political resources, and Rhodes's Rudd Concession had greater value now the London consortium no longer challenged it.\n\n0\n\noriginal\n\nOnce Russell had completed his speech for the defendants, Clarke gave his reply, which the \" Daily Chronicle \" considered to be \" a very brilliant, powerful, wily and courageous effort \". Clarke pointed to the many inaccuracies in both the written statement prepared by Coventry and Williams, and in the memories of all concerned. He went on to outline that there had been celebrations at the races â the prince's horse had won on the first day, and the St Leger had been run on the second â combined with the full hospitality of the Wilsons to consider : according to the court reporter for \" The Times \", Clarke \" alluded to the profuse hospitalities of Tranby Croft, not with any idea of suggesting drunkenness, but as indicating that the guests might not be in a state for accurate observation \". He also drew the jury's attention to the gaps in the defendants'memories, where they were so precise about some of their observations, but could not remember other, key, details. Clarke lampooned some of the involved parties, referring to Lycett Green as \" a Master of Hounds who hunts four days a week \", while Stanley Wilson was a spoiled wastrel from a rich family who lacked initiative and drive. Above all, Clarke indicated, the defendants â with the exception of Stanley Wilson â saw what they had been told to expect : \" the eye saw what it expected or sought to see... there was only one witness who saw Sir William Gordon - Cumming cheat without expecting it â young Mr. [ Stanley ] Wilson. The others were all told there had been cheating, and expected to see it \". At the end of his reply, Clarke's speech was greeted by applause amongst those in the galleries. The British lawyer Heber Hart later wrote that Clarke's speech was \" probably the most conspicuous example of the moral courage and independence of the Bar that has occurred in modern times \", while Clarke considered it to be \" one of the best speeches I ever made. \" The following day, 9 June, Coleridge began his four - hour summing up. His summary was a response to Clarke's, and he went through on a point - by - point basis to discredit the solicitor general's speech, although in places his description \" was directly contrary to the evidence \". Tomes relates that \" many opined that the judge's summing - up had been unacceptably biased \"\n\n0\n\noriginal"
