        "text": "This is my seventh installment of the COVID-19 sports reflection lists that have become so popular on this blog. To read the previous three articles in this anthology, you can click on the following links: the greatest college football regular season games by year, the greatest college football postseason games by year, the greatest Wake Forest games by year, NCAA tournament upset analysis, ranking every NCAA tournament, and the greatest NCAA tournament games by year. As you can see, I have already done a lot with college sports in the past few months, so I thought I would branch out and look at the pro sports. I considered doing a ranking of the greatest NFL game in every season, but I came to find out that list already exists, and I am in the business of creating analyses that have either never been done before or publicized online. That is why I turned to my favorite sport outside of college basketball and college football, tennis, for my next two articles. I have scoured the internet, as well as other sources, and have not find anyone that has compiled a thorough list of the best tennis match of every year from the first grand slam in 1877 to today. There have been many rankings of the greatest matches of all-time (Bleacher Report, Tennis Predict, The Top Tens, Sports Retriever, Steve Flink’s well-written book, and USA Today) which I have utilized in my analysis, but no one to my knowledge, has actually selected the best match for every year mainstream tennis has been played like you will see below.\n\nI established a few ground rules going into this and the biggest one is that grand slam matches are so much more meaningful that other tour matches that the list is almost entirely composed of matches played in the four majors. There have been a few epic battles in the Davis Cup, Olympic Games, and other events which are featured on here, but all but nine matches on the list are from either the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, or US Open. As a result, every match on this list is played under a best of five set format instead of the best of three that you typically see in regular tournaments.\n\nI took into account several factors when determining which match was truly the best for a particular year, including the match’s significance in determining the ultimate tournament champion (finals inherently mean more), the improbability of the final outcome, and the overall excitement of the match. Without further ado, here is my selection for the match of the year for every year tennis has been played. The matches in bold I have listed are my selections for the best of that particular decade, and as always feel free to comment or debate.\n\n1877 Spencer Gore defeats Francis Langham 6-3, 6-2, 5-6, 6-1 (Wimbledon QF)\n\nThe first ever grand slam tourney (see bracket above) was won by Spencer Gore who had to hold off a stiff four set challenge from Francis Langham to get past the quarterfinal round.\n\n1878 Robert Erskine defeats Charles Hamilton 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-5 (Wimbledon QF)\n\nErskine (pictured above after his retirement) survives this nail-biter en route to a runner-up finish.\n\n1879 John Hartley defeats Robert Erskine 6-4, 6-5, 5-6, 0-6, 6-5 (Wimbledon 2nd Round)\n\nHartley (pictured above) wins tourney after surviving this early round battle with the previous year’s runner-up.\n\n1880 Otway Woodhouse defeats George Montgomery 6-4, 2-6, 6-3, 5-6, 6-1 (Wimbledon Semifinal)\n\nThe first five set Wimbledon semifinal.\n\n1881 William Renshaw defeats Herbert Lawford 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 5-6, 6-3 (Wimbledon Semifinal)\n\nRenshaw (pictured above) pulls out this five set war en route to his first of seven Wimbledon titles.\n\n1882 William Renshaw defeats Ernest Renshaw 6-1, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 (Wimbledon Final)\n\nThe first-ever five set Wimbledon final featured an epic battle between brothers (pictured above).
