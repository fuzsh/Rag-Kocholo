        "text": "Suzanne Lenglen v Mary Browne, 1926 final\n\nSuzanne Lenglen's triumph at the French championships of 1926 was her crowning achievement. “Divine” as she was dubbed, completed a 6-1 6-0 final victory over American Mary Browne in just 27 minutes.\n\nLenglen broke down in tears after just four games, and then sipped brandy between sets before taking the acclaim of a bewildered public.\n\nRoland Garros\n\nKaratantcheva denies all\n\n21/12/2005 at 10:19\n\nThe victory was her sixth and final triumph at the French championships, following victories in 1920-1923 and 1925.\n\nFred Perry v Baron Gottfried von Cramm, 1935 final\n\nIn 1934, defeat at Roland Garros had prevented Perry from becoming the first player to capture a Grand Slam.\n\nBut his 6-3 3-6 6-1 6-3 win over Baron Gottfried von Cramm made Perry the first man ever to have won all four championships.\n\nHe was hailed as \"the complete master\" after excelling on the clay.\n\nAlthea Gibson v Angela Mortimer, 1956 final\n\nAlthea Gibson was the first black player to compete at the United States grass-court championships in 1950, but the 1956 French championships proved her major breakthrough.\n\nBenefactors including boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson funded her trip to Europe.\n\nGibson liked to attack and had an awesome serve, but eventually developed consistency from the baseline to win the Italian championship.\n\nThree weeks later, the American defeated Briton Angela Mortimer 6-0 12-10 in front of a hostile French crowd. She also won the doubles title with Angela Buxton.\n\nJohn McEnroe v Ivan Lendl, 1984 final\n\nJohn McEnroe won through to the tournament by swearing, arguing, driving balls at the photographers' pit, claiming he was on an ice cream diet and requesting on-court repairs mid-match.\n\nLendl held serve and then saved three break points later in the third set when McEnroe berated photographers.\n\nMcEnroe, who succumbed 5-7 in the fifth to Lendl, never had a better chance of winning the French Open than that year.\n\nMichael Chang v Ivan Lendl, 1989 fourth round\n\nMichael Chang became the youngest winner of a major men's singles title at 17 years and three months, beating Boris Becker's Wimbledon feat of 1985.\n\nChang toiled for a total of 21 hours, 18 minutes to triumph on the Paris clay. He beat Stefan Edberg in the final, but the defining moment came in his epic fourth round win over Ivan Lendl.\n\nChang trailed two sets to love against the top seed, but battled back for a remarkable five-set that saw him overcome cramp.\n\nAt the start of the fifth seed Chang delivered an underarm serve that startled Lendl. Then, by receiving serve inches outside the service box, psyched the former champion into producing a double fault on match point.\n\nJana Novotna v Chanda Rubin, 1995 third round\n\nAt the 1995 French Open, Jana Novotna had a genuine chance to play through the draw to the final.\n\nIn the third round Novotna faced American Chanda Rubin.\n\nThe Czech struggled to establish a 6-7 (8-10) 6-4 5-0 lead in an already-intriguing match. With Rubin serving at 0-5, Novtona then secured three match points at 0-40 on Rubin's serve.\n\nRubin saved the match points, then saved another six before emerging victorious 8-6. Novotna cried out in anguish and shed tears of desperation.\n\nAndre Agassi v Andrei Medvedev, 1999 final\n\nAndre Agassi had been beaten by Andres Gomez and Jim Courier in the 1990 and 1991 French Open finals respectively.\n\nLosing 1-6 2-6 and down a break in the third set to Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev in the 1999 final, Agassi's career looked over.\n\nHis desperation to complete the Grand Slam set sparked an unlikely, but thrilling, comeback.\n\nSteffi Graf v Martina Hingis, 1999 final\n\nSteffi Graf had not won a major title since 1996 and she wanted to win one more before retiring. Martina Hingis wanted the title after losing to Iva Majoli in the final two years previously.\n\nHingis took a one set lead but Graf secured a dramatic second set 7-5.\n\nHingis tried all she could, even copying Chang's underarm serve of 1989, but the German closed out a fraught match 6-2 in the decider.\n\nThe Swiss star broke down in tears and stormed off court at the end, only to be hauled back on by her mother for the presentation ceremony.\n\nRoland Garros\n\nSigning off from Roland Garros...\n\n06/06/2005 at 17:33"
