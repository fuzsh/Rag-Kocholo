        "text": "Iga Swiatek accomplished the rare feat of winning her third consecutive French Open women's title with a decisive and dominant victory over Italy's 12th seed, Jasmine Paolini.\n\nPoland’s Swiatek maintained her dominance on the Roland Garros clay with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over first-time major finalist Jasmine Paolini. Despite an early break, the world number one quickly responded, winning 11 of the next 12 games to clinch the title, requiring just 68 minutes overall to secure the triumph.\n\nThis victory marks the 23-year-old Swiatek's fourth French Open title and her fifth Grand Slam triumph overall, following her win at the 2022 US Open. \"I love this place, I wait every year to play here,\" said the Pole, who has now won 21 matches in a row at the French Open - the fourth longest streak in women's singles in the Open era.\n\n\"I got broken at the beginning, so it wasn't maybe perfect, but I think the level was pretty high,\" added Swiatek, who Swiatek joins Monica Seles and Justine Henin in the record books as the only players to achieve a 'three-peat' in women’s singles since the Open era began in 1968.\n\nShe is also the youngest player in the Open era, which introduced professionalism, to win four titles at Roland Garros. After securing her victory in just over an hour, Swiatek celebrated by sinking to her knees before dancing around the court.\n\nThe victory means she has now won 35 of her 37 career matches at Roland Garros. At 23, she has won four Roland Garros titles, matching the number that Rafael Nadal, the record 14-time men's champion, had achieved by the same age.\n\nAlthough world number 15 Paolini did not replicate compatriot Francesca Schiavone's 2010 French Open victory, she still has a chance to end on a high note, as she and her doubles partner Sara Errani have advanced to Sunday's final. In her runner-up speech, Paolini congratulated Swiatek.\n\n\"I have to say congratulations to you, Iga,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I think to play you here is the toughest challenge in this sport. It's been an intense 15 days, and today was tough, but I'm really proud of myself. It was tough, but it was lots of fun. To play you here is the toughest challenge in this sport.\""
