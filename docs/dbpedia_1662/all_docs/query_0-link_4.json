        "text": "FM Paul Whitehead column: Friendly Rivalries, Part 16.\n\n1980’s wrap-up.\n\nBy FM Paul Whitehead\n\nContinuing from here: https://www.milibrary.org/chess-newsletters/890#Friendly\n\nThe mid-eighties were my last years of playing in tournaments with any frequency. I was working as a nursery school teacher, had taken up photography in a serious fashion, and I was making many friends outside of the chess world.\n\nBut chess wasn’t done with me yet…\n\nIn 1983 I played in a whopping (for me) 9 tournaments, winning 7 of them outright (those played in Ireland – see newsletters 869 and 870).\n\nIn 1984 I played in only a few events. My results were so-so, but I did win the 9th Northern California (Bagby Memorial) Championship held at the Mechanics’, ahead of GM Biyiasis, Mar, Winslow and others.\n\n1985 was my last big year in chess: I won the 10th Northern California Championship, tying for 1st with Biyiasis this time, and also played in the New York Open and the 1st Miz Brown’s International.\n\nIn 1986 I played in but one tournament, the 11th Northern California Championship, and in 1987 I again played in only one tournament: the 12th Northern California Championship!\n\nIn the years 1988 and 1989 I played not a single tournament game…\n\nI had finally found a rhythm: one tournament a year! And then zero tournaments a year!\n\nWas this the end of my chess career? Tune in later and find out!\n\nI played some good chess in the 1980’s, as well as some bad, and you can find some of those games in previous newsletters.\n\nHere’s a few more games, and of course the stories that tag along with them – for me just as interesting as the games themselves!\n\n(1) Whitehead,Paul A (2320) - Kopec,Danny [B40]\n\nLloyds Bank op 07th London, 1983\n\nDuring my stay in Ireland I hopped on the boat-train from Dublin to London to play in the Lloyd Banks Open. My result was a reasonable 4-3 score against strong opposition. I shared a hotel room with noted Seattle chess maverick James Harley McCormick, six-time Washington State Champion, and if you'd like I could tell you a story or two... 1.e4 My opponent was a well known author and computer scientist, who even has an opening named after him, the \"Kopec System\" of 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bd3!? Unfortunately for Danny, he was playing the originator of the \"Whitehead System\" for which he had no defense. 1...c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d3 Nc6 4.g3 d5 5.Nbd2 Nge7\n\n6.Bg2 b6 7.0-0 Bb7 8.Re1 d4 9.a4 e5 10.Nc4 Qc7 Black's moves are reasonable, but he should have considered fianchettoing his King's Bishop and castling. 11.c3 f6 12.cxd4 cxd4 13.Bd2 Ng6 14.Qb3 Bc5 15.a5 Ke7 Black has managed to misplace almost every piece and is in serious trouble. 16.Bh3 Rab8 17.axb6 axb6 18.Qb5 Bc8 19.Bxc8 Rhxc8 20.b4 Bd6 White plays simple moves, and Black is simply lost. 21.Rec1 Qb7 22.Nxd6 Kxd6 23.Qd5+ Ke7 24.b5 If the Knight moves, then 25.Bb4+ and it's over. 1-0\n\n(2) Baja,Victor - Whitehead,Paul [B44]\n\nGolden Bear Open, 1984\n\nVictor Baja is a strong master just a year older than I, and a frequent rival in tournaments at the Mechanics' Institute and in the Bay Area. He hasn't played for a long time. Victor was also a fine problemist, and Pal Benko published quite a few of his compositions in Chess Life. 1.e4 c5 This game is a long, tough fight, finally decided when White chooses activity over maintaining the status quo. 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 e6 5.Nb5 d6 6.c4 Nf6 7.N1c3 a6 8.Nd4 Bd7 9.Be2 Be7 10.0-0 0-0\n\nBoth sides hunker down in a familiar Maroczy Bind / Hedgehog formation. 11.b3 Qb8 12.Nc2 Rc8 13.Bb2 Na7 14.Bf3 h6 15.g3 Nc6 16.Bg2 b5 17.Ne3 Ra7 18.Kh1 Na5 19.cxb5 axb5 20.Ne2 Bc6 Both players spar and jab. 21.f3 b4 22.Nd4 Be8 23.Qd2 Rc5 24.Nec2 d5 25.e5 Qxe5 26.Nxb4 Qb8 27.Nd3 Rc8 28.Rac1 Rxc1 29.Rxc1 Bd6 30.Rc2 Nb7 31.Nc1 Nc5 32.Nde2 Nfd7 33.Bd4 Ra8 34.Bg1 Qb7 35.Nc3 Qb4 36.f4 Rd8 37.f5 Be5 38.Nb1 Qxd2 39.Nxd2 Na6 40.Nd3 Bd6 The position is unbalanced, but equal. However, White now goes down a rabbit-hole with his next 2 moves and ultimately loses a pawn. 41.Rc6 Ndb8 42.Rb6?! Bc6 43.b4 Bc7 44.b5 Bxb6 45.Bxb6 Bxb5 46.Bxd8 Bxd3 47.fxe6 fxe6 48.Kg1 Nc6 49.Bb6 Kf7 50.Kf2 Ke7 White now puts up a great fight, but Black is patient and accurate to the end. 51.Ke3 Bb5 52.a3 Kd6 53.Bf3 Nab8 54.Kf4 Nd7 55.Bg1 e5+ 56.Ke3 Nc5 57.Bd1 e4 58.Kf4 Ne6+ 59.Kg4 Ke5 60.Bb6 d4 61.a4 Bd3 62.a5 e3 63.Nf3+ Ke4 64.Ba4 Ne7 65.Ne1 Be2+ 66.Kh3 Bf1+ 67.Kg4 g6 68.Bc2+ d3 69.Bxd3+ Bxd3 70.Nxd3 Kxd3 71.a6 e2 72.Ba5 Nc6 73.Be1 Ne5+ 74.Kh3 Nf3 75.a7 Nc7 76.Ba5 e1Q 77.Bxe1 Nxe1 78.Kg4 Ke4 79.h4 Nd3 80.a8Q+ Nxa8 Not the most flashy game, but I always enjoyed these long technical struggles - as long as I was victorious at the end! 0-1\n\n(3) Maser,Thomas F - Whitehead,Paul A (2370) [B49]\n\nNew York op New York (1), 1985\n\nTom Maser is a wonderful man and a great friend to the chess community. I think it's funny that the only time we crossed swords was 3,000 miles away from the Bay Area, in New York City. 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.Nc3 a6\n\n6.Be2 Qc7 7.Be3 Nf6 8.0-0 Bb4 9.Na4 Be7 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Qd4 11.Nb6 is far and away the 1st choice of most in this position. 11...0-0 12.c4 c5 13.Qd3 Bb7 14.Nc3 Rfd8 15.Bf3 Bd6 Black is perhaps a bit more than equal here. 16.h3 Be5 17.Rfe1 Rab8 18.Bg5?! This exchange is not helpful for White. 18...h6 19.Bxf6 Bxf6 20.Rad1 Bc6 21.b3 Be5 22.Ne2 a5 23.Qe3 d6 24.Bh5 a4 25.f4 Bf6 Now White decides to force the issue, but the complications will favor Black. 26.e5?! dxe5 27.Qxc5 Rxd1 28.Rxd1 axb3 29.axb3 Rxb3 30.Bf3 Qb6 The tactics are working in Black's favor... 31.Qxb6 Rxb6 32.c5 Ra6 33.Rd6? Going way too far. White had to keep it simple with 33.fxe5 Bxe5, although Black is much better. 33...e4! Wins a piece. 34.Bxe4 Ra1+ 35.Kf2 Bxe4 36.c6 Ra8 37.c7 Rc8 38.Nc3 Bb7 39.Nb5 Be7 0-1\n\n(4) Whitehead,Paul A (2370) - Edelman,Daniel (2200) [B07]\n\nNew York op New York (8), 1985\n\nDanny Edelman is an International Master (1993) who lives in Connecticut. This was our only game, the final round of the New York Open, with almost nothing at stake. 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Bg5 Bg7 5.f3 Nbd7\n\n6.Qd2 h6 7.Be3 c6 8.a4 Qa5 9.Bd3 b5? Actually a strange kind of blunder which should lose a pawn... 10.b4! Qxb4?? ...or a Queen. Black decides to call White's bluff, but White is not kidding. 11.axb5! c5 Black tries to wriggle out, but Her Majesty is losing Her Head. 12.Ra4 Qb2 13.Nd1 Qb1 14.c4 Qb3 15.Bc2 Qxa4 Black has lost his Queen for a Rook after only 15 moves! Evidently it's not time to resign yet... 16.Bxa4 a6 17.dxc5 dxc5 18.Ne2 0-0 19.0-0 Ne5 20.Bxc5 Nxc4 21.Qc1 Ne5 22.Bxe7 Re8 23.Bxf6\n\n1-0.\n\nTony's Teasers\n\nThis weeks problem is mate in 2 by Victor Baja originally published in George Koltinowski's Chess column in the San Francisco Chronicle on 10/27/1978.

In the lower section Stanley shined with 3.5/4 to grab the sole first place, while Hudson took clear second with 3.0/4.

She follows in the tradition of the first great women’s champion from China, Xie Jun. Xie Jun came to play in our Mechanics Institute’s 3rd Pan Pacific International Tournament in 1995, cementing the West Coast – China connection in chess and culture. Hoi Yifan however reached an elite level many talented men would be proud to have done. She is a true chess prodigy and achieved a level far above all other women players of her generation. Her peak ELO rating is 2686, making her borderline super grandmaster in the men’s world. She won the women’s world championship 3 times starting in 2010. Then she seems to have gotten bored with women’s chess and FIDE politics so played only in men’s tournaments.\n\nMany of our club players will remember the fascinating talk Yifan gave here at the Mechanics’ Institute in May last year (2018). She recounted her developing years in China and her current interests. She is a Rhodes’ Scholar! - so studying at Oxford. While in the Bay Area she was doing an internship down on the Peninsula in one of our tech companies (which remains anonymous). She has a delightful aggressive style. I expect our readers will thoroughly enjoy her games below.\n\n(1) Anish Giri (2720) - Yifan Hou (2603) [B70]\n\nTata Steel Group A Wijk aan Zee NED, 18.01.2013\n\n1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6\n\nYifan chooses the aggressive Dragon Variation. She is playing against the super solid Anish Giri, who hardly ever loses a game. 6.g3 A solid, if less aggressive choice. 6...Nc6 7.Nde2 Bd7 8.Bg2 Qc8! 9.h3 Bg7 Yifan has played the opening well. ...Qc8 makes it difficult for White to castle and avoid the trade of the fianchettoed bishop.
