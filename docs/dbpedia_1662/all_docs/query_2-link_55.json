        "text": "The beauty of the Olympics, in the first week at least, is that every day seems to be chock full of must-see events, unmissable competitions and enough drama to keep a Netflix executive happy.\n\nDay three was no different, and if you’re from Hong Kong it held the prospect of not one, but two gold medals. An achievement that would be simply unprecedented in the annals of the city’s sporting history.\n\nCheung Ka-long and Siobhan Haughey knew the weight of expectation that weighed on them, and boy did they deliver.\n\nHistory was made in Paris, with a second fencing gold for Cheung Ka-long, making him the only Hong Kong athlete to have ever achieved that feat. Bronze for Haughey in the 200m freestyle took her personally tally of Olympic medals to three, more than any other Hongkonger.\n\nShe may yet add a fourth in the 100m freestyle, for which the heats start on Tuesday in Paris. We’ll be here again covering it all live, so remember to join us as Hong Kong’s athletes chase more glory in France.\n\nMore from our coverage:\n\nReporting by Mike Chan and Paul McNamara in Paris, and Josh Ball, Angeline Jiang, Sylvia Ma, Lars Hamer, Ira Gorawara, Meredith Chen, Alice Kong, Tom Shuai and Tom Bell in Hong Kong"
