Durant, who missed all of exhibition play leading up to Paris, looked dominant coming off the bench.\n\nLeBron James, playing in the Olympics for the first time since 2012, recorded 21 points, eight rebounds and nine assists, picking up where he left off in London 12 years ago.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHighlights: U.S. women’s soccer team leads group after 4-1 victory over Germany\n\nThe U.S. women’s soccer team pulled out to lead its group at the Olympics today with a 4-1 win against Germany, allowing a decent cushion as it heads into its next game against Australia later this week.\n\nGoing into their game against Germany, the American women were tied for first, but their gap in the standings this morning was quickly closed after Australia scored six goals against Zambia in the afternoon.\n\nBut the Americans played beautifully under pressure, forcing Germany’s defense to spend the majority of the game in its own box as they kept possession of the ball. Sophia Smith, who made her World Cup debut only last year, scored two goals and showed pure offensive drive.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAt Olympic swimming heat, ‘Bob the Cap Catcher’ saves the day\n\nThe crowd whistled and cheered as he walked past the towering athletes on the pool deck at Paris’ La Defense Arena.\n\nIn a floral Speedo, there he was, not an Olympian but still a hero: “Bob the Cap Catcher.”\n\nThe world has become fixated after the Speedo-clad mystery man saved the day when the one of the women’s 100-meter breaststroke heats faced a hiccup.\n\nThe race’s starter called for the swimmers to step down from their diving platform, spotting an obstacle in the pool: one of U.S. swimmer Emma Weber’s caps.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFrench President Macron calls Léon Marchand after swimming gold medal\n\nAt a news conference following French swimmer Léon Marchand's 400-meter individual medley gold medal win, Marchand said French President Emmanuel Macron called to congratulate him.\n\n\"That was the first time for me. He called me. He told me that he was watching the final with his whole family,\" Marchand said. \"Everyone was kind of, like, screaming on the phone. It was kind of funny. I was very grateful for that phone call.”\n\nThe medal ceremony then became extraordinary, he said, because the glow from speaking to his country's president was still warm.\n\n“I had goosebumps on the podium,\" Marchand said. \"I felt really proud to be myself and to be also French tonight.”\n\nHighlights: Marchand wins Olympic gold and the admiration of France as Huske and Walsh go 1-2\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nFrench swimmer Léon Marchand electrified a partisan crowd today with an Olympic record time in the 400-meter individual medley before American Torri Huske and Italian Nicolo Martinenghi also won their first gold medals.\n\nA capacity crowd filled Paris La Défense Arena, with thousands of fans decked out in bleu, blanc et rouge in hope of crowning a new national hero. Marchand did not disappoint.\n\nHis time of 4:02.95 broke the Olympic record of all-time great Michael Phelps and fell just short of the world record held by Marchand himself.\n\n“I think it’s a dream for every one of us,” he told NBC, wearing the gold around his neck. “I got the chance to do it today. That was amazing. I don’t know how to describe it.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nKiefer and Scruggs take Olympic gold and silver in all-American foil fencing final\n\nand\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nPARIS — Two American women squared up for a sword fight in the palace at dusk. Both emerged with Olympic medals.\n\nThis, the Grand Palais in the center of the French capital, was the stage for the women’s foil fencing match-up between Lee Kiefer, 30, and Lauren Scruggs, 21, the first all-American fencing final since Beijing 2008.\n\nKiefer — the defending champion and pre-tournament favorite — won 15-6 to retain the gold medal.\n\n“There’s a million different obstacles that happened to make it to this point,” she told reporters afterward. “So getting through all these things that you can’t even predict is just freaking cool and fun.”\n\nScruggs’ silver makes her the first Black American woman to win an individual fencing medal and the second out LGBTQ athlete to get on the podium at these Games.\n\n“In certain communities, fencing is just not a sport you do,” she told NBC News after her bout. “So I would say to those people who are in those communities and who are interested in fencing: Do what you want to do … and follow your passion.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nConvicted Dutch rapist booed on Olympics beach volleyball debut\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThere were boos and mixed feelings among the crowd as Netherlands beach volleyball player Steven van de Velde, a convicted rapist, made his Paris 2024 debut today.\n\nHis team, however, was unapologetic about van de Velde's taking part in the Olympics, saying that “the past is in the past” and that the matter should not be brought up at the Games.\n\nVan de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison in Britain in 2016 following the rape of a 12-year-old girl two years earlier when he was 19.\n\nHe spent 13 months in prison — one year in Britain and one month in the Netherlands — before being freed there after what he did was reclassified under Dutch law as a lesser offense of “committing indecent acts” and his sentence was reduced.\n\nVan de Velde, now 29, has been competing in beach volleyball again since 2017.\n\nHe was booed several times during today’s match, though there was also applause from other members of the crowd.\n\nVan de Velde’s teammate Matthew Immers brushed away the criticism over his taking part in the Olympics.\n\n“What’s in the past is in the past. He had his punishment, and now he is really kind. For me it is an example that [he] grew and learnt a lot from it,” Immers told reporters.\n\nJohn van Vliet, a press officer for the Netherlands team, said: “It’s something that shouldn’t be brought up through sports in a tournament that he qualified for.\n\n“The general matter of sex convictions or sex-related crime is a much bigger issue than sport, but in his case we have a person who has been convicted, who did his sentence and did everything afterwards that he can do to compete again.”\n\nVan de Velde and Immers lost 22-20 19-21 15-13 to Italy’s Alex Ranghieri and Adrian Ignacio Carambula Raurich in their men’s Pool B match.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said yesterday it was satisfied with explanations the Netherlands Olympic team gave about van de Velde's participation.\n\nIOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that the committee was not totally comfortable with the situation but that “a crime occurred 10 years ago, a great deal of rehabilitation has taken place, and strong safeguarding is in place.”\n\nThe Netherlands team has taken steps to mitigate the impact of van de Velde’s participation by moving him to alternative accommodations in Paris, not the athletes’ village, and asking him not to speak to the media.\n\nThe case has resonated in France and more widely, including in Britain and the U.S., with some women’s rights groups having campaigned against hos participation in the Games.\n\n“What is the message to victims? That sporting talent has more value than their dignity,” Alienor Laurent, a co-president of the French feminist collective “Osez le feminisme!” (Dare to be Feminist), told Reuters last week.\n\n“And what is the message to aggressors? Assaulting [a young girl] will have no impact on your life or your career; you will be celebrated and may have medals.”\n\nSurfing's second day of competition runs in conditions that challenge some riders\n\nOlympics surfing organizers called the day of competition \"on\" this morning, setting the stage for Round 2 and its two-person heats that resulted in advancement or elimination.\n\nAfter yesterday's fairly clean, mostly overhead waves, today's version of Teahupo'o served up unpredictable waves that sometimes lost their signature barrels and folded as winds shifted and sometimes hit waves sideways and foiled the break's organized power.\n\nThe softer, weirder, head-high waves, however, may not have given less-recognizable names any advantage, because favored names in surfing advanced.\n\nSome of the surfers who advanced to Round 3 were Brazil's Tatiana Weston-Webb, who still managed to find a juicy barrel; France's Johanne Defay, who dispatched Australia's Molly Picklum as she enlisted deft takeoffs and deep tube rides; and Japan's Matsuda Shino, who used her goofy foot stance to face the wave and step into voluminous barrels against Portugal’s Teresa Bonvalot.\n\nChina's Yang Siqi wisely ripped as if this wasn't big, cavernous Teahupo'o, hitting the lip, a rare move at the break, and free-falling successfully to the bottom. Peru's Sol Aguirre was on the same page, switching to a small-wave shredder of a board mid-heat, but it wasn't enough to overcome Siqi.\n\nTune in to prime-time coverage\n\nFull prime-time coverage begins tonight on NBC and Peacock at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nMedal counter: U.S. leads with 12, ties with France with 3 gold\n\nBeach volleyball favorites Cheng and Hughes win in straight sets in first match\n\nCalifornia duo Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes delivered an impressive first showing, with dominant back-to-back sets against the Czech Republic's Barbora Hermannová and Marie-Sara Stochlova.\n\nCheng and Hughes' partnership goes back to 2016 and 2017, when the pair won the first two NCAA beach volleyball titles ever.\n\nAfter playing with different partners for several years, the pair reunited to win the 2023 world championship and now pursue the gold medal in Paris. Their next match in the preliminary rounds will be Wednesday against France.\n\nSoccer: U.S. women lead group after 4-1 win over Germany\n\nThe second half of the U.S. game against Germany may have been less aggressive than the first, but it certainly was not disappointing.\n\nGoing in with a 3-1 lead, the American women managed to keep control over the pace of the game and secure possession against the Germans. Midfielder Rose Lavelle shined through as she appeared just about everywhere on the field.\n\nGermany had small pushes in which it appeared it was changing the momentum of the game, but none of its shots could make it past goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. Ultimately, it failed to capitalize on their opportunities.\n\nThe U.S. win has most likely advanced it to the knockouts in the Olympic quarterfinals.\n\nSoccer: U.S. scores again for a 4-1 lead in the final minutes\n\nMallory Swanson and Lynn Williams exemplified teamwork in the final moments of the game against Germany to score once again just before the 90-minute mark.\n\nSwanson made a pass to Williams just ahead of the German goal, allowing Williams to sink the ball quickly into the back of the net.\n\nSimone Biles out of bars finals\n\nBiles' score held up for most of the qualifying round, but in the final routine of the day, she was knocked out of the uneven bars apparatus final by reigning Olympic bars champion Nina Derwael.\n\nShe qualified for every other possible final: team, all-around, vault, beam and floor.\n\nTeam USA shuttlers Vinson Chiu and Jennie Gai dropped their mixed doubles badminton match to Malaysia’s Tang Jie Chen and Ee Wei Toh.\n\nGymnastics: Rebeca Andrade will join Simone Biles in five finals\n\nSimone Biles' Brazilian rival Rebeca Andrade had a fantastic qualifying round in the fifth and final subdivision. She will face off against Biles in the team, all-around, beam, floor and vault finals.\n\nAndrade is the reigning Olympic all-around silver medalist and vault champion, two events in which she'll aim to return to the podium.\n\nSara Hughes going for gold in beach volleyball with idol cheering her on\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nSouthern California native Sara Hughes was nearly too shy as a little girl to say hello to her idol, beach volleyball great Misty May, one day on the sands of Huntington Beach.\n\n“I was so nervous. My mom was like, ‘Go run up to her, wish her luck with the Olympics and just shake her hand,’” Hughes, 24, recalled to NBC’s “The Podium.” “And I don’t know, I think I blacked out. I ran up to her and said, ‘Misty, my name is Sara. I want you to win gold in the Olympics. Good luck,’ and I ran straight back to my mom.”\n\nMay, who paired with Kerri Walsh to win gold in 2004, 2008 and 2012, called that little girl back and gave her a wristband — which had the name of a sponsor that now backs Hughes.\n\nAnd to make the circle complete, May-Treanor will be in the press box for NBC when Hughes and teammate Kelly Cheng hit the sands for Team USA in Paris.\n\nSoccer: U.S. opens second half by maintaining possession\n\nThe second half of the U.S. matchup against Germany is underway, and the Americans continue to dominate possession of the ball.\n\nWith a 3-1 lead going into the back half of the game, the American women are showing force by trying to keep back the German team.\n\nGermany is doing its best to play the game in the U.S. half of the field but has not been able to make significant headway as two back-to-back attempts at a goal failed.\n\nU.S. water polo star Maggie Steffens' sister-in-law dies after traveling to Paris to cheer her on\n\nU.S. water polo captain Maggie Steffens is playing with a heavy heart at the Paris Olympics after her sister-in-law died a couple days before the Games began.\n\nLulu Conner, 26, died Tuesday after traveling to Paris to cheer on Steffens as she goes for a fourth consecutive gold medal with the U.S. team. The family is still piecing together what happened, but Steffens described the situation as “a medical emergency.”\n\n“She was so excited for the Olympic Games,” a teary Steffens told The Associated Press. “We’re really close. She’s the light of the world. She just brings so much joy to everyone. She always brings people together.”\n\nSteffens scored two goals while playing 21 1/2 minutes as the U.S. beat Greece 15-6 on the first day of the women’s tournament yesterday. She is the highest-scoring woman in Olympic history, with 58 goals.\n\n“It definitely helps to play,” Steffens said. “I’m, like, so out of body in a way right now. And I just keep trying to remind myself what Lulu would want and how she would be, you know, how can I embody her spirit the best. And Lulu was somebody that she gave 150% to everything she did.”\n\nSteffens, 31, married Bobby Conner in Puerto Rico in November. Lulu was an artist — she made her own version of Flavor Flav’s USA Water Polo clock for the Olympics — a UC Davis grad and one of three siblings.\n\nWhile she was on the American boat for the opening ceremony Friday night, Steffens dropped a small bouquet of flowers into the Seine River in remembrance.\n\n“It’s going to be a really hard couple weeks for all of us,” she said. “My team has been a really big support system for me. I’ve been obviously really struggling, and my husband, as well, and his entire family. I mean, it’s a nightmare, and it’s completely shocking. But I think just feeling her spirit here is, like I said, it’s amazing. And I hope that we can make her proud every single day.”\n\nThe death right before the Olympics was reminiscent of the 2016 Games, when coach Adam Krikorian lost his brother, Blake, and went home to be with his family before returning in time for the team’s first game in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIt was all too familiar for Krikorian.\n\n“You know when it happens, it’s like all the emotions come pouring back to you,” he said. “You might not feel these emotions that often, but then they just come rushing back.”\n\n“You just show her love and support,” he continued. “You know it’s important that she’s there for Bobby and his family, as well. This is a difficult time for them, and give her some freedom to be able to spend some time with them I think is enormously important.”\n\nFencing: Kiefer defends gold, Scruggs makes history\n\nand\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe USA’s Lee Kiefer has defended her title, taking gold in women’s individual foil, 15-6, at the Grand Palais.\n\nThe three-time Olympian was fencing against fellow American Lauren Scruggs, a first-time Olympian who took silver. Scruggs has made history, becoming the first Black fencer from the U.S. to win an individual medal in the women's event.\n\nAs for Kiefer, only two women have successfully defended their fencing titles previously, in 1936 and 1940.\n\nScruggs took a few early points, but once Kiefer, the defending gold medalist and world No. 1, pulled away, there looked like only one winner. When Kiefer got the final point, the pair embraced, and both swaddled themselves in American flags.\n\nTorri Huske's growing list of accomplishemnts\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nTorri Huske, the 100-meter butterfly gold medalist, is leaving her mark on U.S. swimming history.\n\nShe's now a two-time medalist, adding to a silver she won three years ago in Tokyo in the 4x100 freestyle relay.\n\nHer triumph in this event was the first by an American since the legendary Dana Vollmer's gold medal win in 2012.\n\nBefore tonight, American women had gone 1-2 in the 100 butterfly twice. Huske and Gretchen Walsh followed in the strokes of Shelley Mann and Nancy Ramey in 1956 and Mary T. Meagher and Jenna Johnson in 1984.\n\nSilver for Nic Fink\n\nThe USA's Nic Fink ties for silver in the men's 100-meter breaststroke with Great Britain's Adam Peaty. Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi won gold.\n\nSoccer: U.S. leads 3-1 in first half against well-matched German team\n\nThe American women's team has played an impressive first half against Germany, leading 3-1 at the end of the first half.\n\nSophia Smith scored two goals, showcasing that impressive offensive drive that makes her a crowd favorite. There's also been impressive ball handling from the U.S. team, particularly as Rose Lavelle, Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman keep pressure on their German opponents.\n\nGermany has played a commendable game, as well, taking just two fewer shots than the Americans. The Germans must take back the momentum and fight for possession in the second half if they want a chance at winning against the persistent pressure on their end of the field.\n\nMurphy on to 100-meter backstroke finals\n\nThe USA's Ryan Murphy has advanced to the men's 100-meter backstroke finals.\n\nLéon Marchand: Thank you, people of France\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nPeople of France, Léon Marchand heard your cheers, loud and clear.\n\nThe 400 IM gold medalist, while focused like a laser in winning the grueling race, said he couldn't help but to be inspired by fans cheering rhythmically each time his head popped out of the water during the breaststroke.\n\n\"The breaststroke was insane, because I could hear whole stadium, so that was amazing to do,\" he told NBC, wearing the gold around his neck.\n\nThe race was a dream come true for the 22-year-old.\n\n\"I think it’s a dream for every one of us,\" he said. \"I got the chance to do it today. That was amazing. I don’t know how to describe it.\"\n\nSoccer: Sophia Smith scores again; U.S. leads 3-1\n\nThe U.S. is widening its lead as the first half nears an end as Sophia Smith hits the ball in a lucky goal.\n\nShe shot relatively far from the goal, but the ball hit the goal post and spun right passed the German goalkeeper into the back of the net.\n\nOn the podium they were both No. 1\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nBefore \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" played and the American flag raised, 100-meter butterfly gold medalist Torri Huske made sure she wasn't alone on top of the podium.\n\nSilver medalist and fellow American Gretchen Walsh joined her on the top step for the celebration.\n\nThey joyously clasped and raised hands moments after \"home of the brave.\"\n\nZambia played in the highest-scoring women's soccer games in Olympic history\n\nToday's match between Zambia and Australia, which the Matildas won 6-5, was the second-highest-scoring women's game in Olympic history.\n\nZambia played in the highest-scoring game at the Tokyo Games just a few years ago, losing 10-3 to the Netherlands. Unlike last time, Zambia put in quite the fight and forced Australia to recover in the second half.\n\nThe third-ranked game was also during the 2020 Olympics, when the Netherlands beat China 8-2.\n\nWomen's soccer made its Olympics debut just shy of 30 years ago at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nHow a sibling rivalry led swimmer Ryan Murphy toward Olympic glory\n\nAfter a young Ryan Murphy moved from Palos Heights, Illinois, to Florida, his parents suggested that the family go to their local community pool to make friends — an idea they never knew would lead their youngest child to six Olympic medals and counting.\n\nAs the youngest of the three children, Murphy was the last to touch the pool.\n\nHe watched as his oldest sister, who already knew how to swim, immediately got into the water. The following summer, Murphy said, his older brother was also proficient enough to join in.\n\n“I was just the young kid running around with my life vest on, chomping at the bit so I could play with my older siblings,” Murphy told reporter Alex Maragos.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFrench celebrate with 400 IM gold medalist Léon Marchand\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nThe capacity crowd at Paris La Défense Arena belted out a joyous “La Marseillaise” as Léon Marchand stood at attention with a gold medal wrapped around his neck.\n\nThe 400 IM champ and new national hero then walked about two-thirds of the arena's perimeter exchanging high-fives and occasional hugs with fans along the lower rows of the arena.\n\nThe French fans were totally behind Marchand in his winning race, especially in the third leg, as they rhythmically cheered each time the 22-year-old's head popped out from the water in the breaststroke.\n\nSteph Curry can only dance as Anthony Edwards stirs the pot after a crazy floater helps stretch the U.S. lead late over Serbia.\n\nHero-turned-fan Fraser-Pryce cheers on New Zealand women's rugby\n\nAfter meeting her hero, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, in a viral moment captured on video, New Zealand rugby star Michaela Blyde received an even bigger treat: Fraser-Pryce went on to cheer for her as she and her team defeated China in their seeding round opener.\n\nFraser-Pryce tagged Blyde in an Instagram story about watching the game from the sidelines. Afterward, the track legend met the entire team, posing for a photo posted by the New Zealand sevens account.\n\nLilly King advances to 100-meter breaststroke final\n\nThe USA's Lilly King will be moving on to the women's 100-meter breaststroke final after finishing third in her heat.\n\nKing took bronze in the event in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and won gold for it in Rio.\n\nSoccer: Swanson charges goal to retake the lead 2-1\n\nMallory Swanson charged ahead to rebound a blocked shot by Sophia Smith and retake the lead against Germany 2-1.\n\nIt appears the German goalkeeper may have been injured, as she may have slid into Swanson as she tried to make a save.\n\nSoccer: Germany fights back with equalizer\n\nGermany is not going down without a fight, tying the game 1-1 in the 22nd minute.\n\nGiulia Gwinn scored with a kick that just escaped U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. There was also a yellow card against U.S. Samantha Coffey.\n\nAll-American fencing final\n\nToday's fencing final in foil between the USA's Lauren Scruggs and Lee Kiefer has assured the U.S. a silver and a gold medal. The only question is which athlete will take each color home.\n\nAfter winning gold in the same discipline three years ago, Kiefer will be looking to defend her title against first-time Olympian Scruggs.\n\nRugby sevens: USA dominates Brazil for second group win\n\nThe U.S. women’s rugby sevens team is off to a scorching hot start in Paris.\n\nAfter a 36-7 win over Japan to start the day, USA picked up its second win in dominant fashion again, toppling Brazil 24-5. The U.S. joined France as the other unbeaten team in Pool C, though the host country is ahead by virtue of goal differential.\n\nAlex Sedrick, Ilona Maher, Alev Kelter and Sammy Sullivan handled the scoring for the U.S. vs. Brazil. Sedrick, Maher and Sullivan also scored vs. Japan earlier in the day and were joined by Kristi Kershe, Kayla Canett and Sarah Levy.\n\nPool play will continue tomorrow, as the U.S. and France will square to determine the winner of their pool. The match will determine seeding headed into the quarterfinals, which also begin later tomorrow.\n\nSoccer: U.S. scores to lead Germany 1-0\n\nSophia Smith led the American team to its first goal in the game against Germany, pushing it ahead in Group B at the 10-minute mark.\n\nShe was assisted by Trinity Rodman.\n\nSoccer: Australia wins 6-5; Zambian players in tears\n\nAustralia's beloved Matildas fought tooth and nail to rally from behind in the second half with a 6-5 win against Zambia, putting the African team in last place of the women's Group B.\n\nThe high-scoring game has also closed what was a sizable gap between the U.S., Australia and Germany. The team's six goals have brought it out of the negative — as its loss by three against Germany last week were points against them — and has it tied for first. Though with the U.S. and German match-up just beginning, that may be a short-lived first-place tie.\n\nThis high-scoring game is unquestionably difficult for both the U.S. and Germany, who had nice cushions as top contenders in Group B.\n\nOnly the top two of each group will move on to the quarterfinals. The Zambian team appeared devastated after its loss, as it has almost no hope in making up the deficit after two successive losses.\n\nSwimming: Gold at the end of 'long road' for Torri Huske\n\nReporting from Nanterre, france\n\nTorri Huske won gold in the 100-meter butterfly, three years after falling short of bronze by a hundredth of a second.\n\n\"Like you said, I just missed the podium last time by a hundredth, so I’m so thankful to be here, and to do it with Gretchen is just amazing,\" Huske said moments after going 1-2 with fellow American Gretchen Walsh. \"I’ve had a long road, but I have a lot of support, and I’m so thankful for all of it.”\n\nThe significance of her accomplishment might take a moment to process.\n\n“I feel like I’m in shock right now,\" she said, \"like I don’t even know how to process it, like I feel like I’m going to cry but like I’m also smiling. It’s really surreal.\"\n\nBasketball highlights: Durant with nearly impeccable shooting in USA win\n\nIn USA's 110-84 win over Serbia in the men's basketball opener, Kevin Durant was a key offensive weapon. Making his first appearance after dealing with a calf injury, Durant scored 21 points and made eight of his nine shots from the field.\n\nSoccer: Australia squeaks ahead 6-5 in final minutes\n\nMichelle Heyman may have just secured Australia's win against Zambia with a shot into the open net past the Zambian goalkeeper in the 90th minute of the game.\n\nHeyman sank the ball back for her second goal of the game with an assist from Steph Catley. Eight minutes of stoppage time were added to the end of the match, which Zambia must capitalize on if it wants to make its way out of last place in the group.\n\nAmericans to watch: Men's 100m breaststroke final\n\nNic Fink will be the only swimmer representing Team USA in the men's 100-meter breaststroke final today.\n\nHe finished fourth in the semifinal yesterday with a time of 59.16.\n\nCharlie Swanson also competed in the semifinal but did not advance to today's contest.\n\nTorri Huske takes gold, Gretchen Walsh silver in 100 butterfly\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nAmerican women went 1-2 in the 100-meter butterfly with Torri Huske taking the gold and Gretchen Walsh the silver.\n\nZhang Yufei took bronze for China.\n\nSoccer: U.S. and Germany may need high-scoring game following Zambia and Australia match-up\n\nAn absolutely astounding game between Australia and Zambia has put both Germany and the U.S., who were leading the group and face off at 3 p.m. ET, on much less secure ground going into their game.\n\nThe teams went into today tied for first in Group B with three goals each after winning 3-0 in their first games a few days ago. Zambia and Australia were tied for last, but a high-scoring game between the two teams has closed what was a large gap in the standings just a few hours ago.\n\nOnly the top two teams in each group will proceed into the knockout part of the tournament, and each goal in every game will matter.\n\nAmericans to watch: Women's 100-meter butterfly final\n\nGretchen Walsh and Torri Huske are going into the women's 100-meter butterfly finals with the best two times after semifinals yesterday.\n\nWalsh clocked an Olympic record with a time of 55.38, finishing over a second before the next-best competitor. She's also the world record holder in the event, with a time of 55.18.\n\nHuske followed suit in the second semifinal, also finishing in first place and joining Walsh high up on the roster for today. She finished her race in 56.00 seconds flat.\n\nSoccer: Australia capitalizes on penalty to equalize the game 5-5\n\nThe Matildas have made an astonishing comeback to tie the game 5-5 against Zambia.\n\nSteph Catley sank the ball into Zambia's goal after a foul offered her a chance at a penalty kick.\n\nFrance's Léon Marchand wins 400-meter individual medley\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nFrance has a new national hero.\n\nLéon Marchand won the 400-meter individual medley before a roaring French crowd at Paris La Defense Arena.\n\nMarchand set a Olympic record with a time of 4:02.95 — besting Michael Phelps' record, which had stood since 2008.\n\nAmerican Carson Foster finished third behind Tomoyuki Matsushita.\n\nMarchand is also expected to swim in the 200 IM, 200 butterfly and 200 breaststroke.\n\nNic Fink is balancing swimming dreams with a 9-to-5\n\nOlympic athletes often juggle competing demands on their time and attention. But few competitors vying for glory at this summer’s Paris Games have mastered the art of multitasking quite like Nic Fink, a swimmer on the U.S. national team.\n\nIn recent years, Fink has established himself as a decorated competitive swimmer. He’s a six-time World Championship gold medalist, and he placed fifth in the men’s 200-meter breaststroke event at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, impressing spectators with his laser-focused intensity.\n\nFink has done this all while holding down a 9-to-5 job. He has a master’s in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech — a degree he earned after competing in Tokyo — and now works for Quanta Utility Engineering Services, clocking in remotely from the home in Dallas he shares with his wife, Melanie Margalis Fink, herself an Olympian swimmer who won gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSoccer: Australia scores again; Zambia leads 5-4\n\nWith enthusiasm building Australia capitalizes on the momentum within just minutes to score another goal.\n\nThe Matildas, as they're affectionately called, are now only one goal behind Zambia. Fans in the stands cheered them on with a famous Australian chant, \"Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi.\"\n\nWatch USA's Vincent Chiu spin for a crazy shot in badminton mixed doubles\n\nChiu showed off an impressive spin move earlier in the badminton mixed doubles group play.\n\nAlongside teammate Jennie Gai, the American duo unfortunately lost to their Malaysian opponents, placing them at the bottom of their group with two losses.\n\nDefending gold medalist in 52kg judo, Uta Abe was overcome with emotion after being eliminated.\n\nSoccer: Back-to-back goals bring Zambia and Australia 5-3\n\nFans who blink risk missing incredible plays as Zambia and Australia continue to be relentless in their match today, scoring goals within minutes of each other.\n\nThe stars are aligning for Zambia today as a header from Rachael Kundananji made its way passed the Australian goalkeeper in minute 56 of the match. Her goal was assisted by Barbra Banda.\n\nAbout two minutes later Australia returned fire with a great goal by Michelle Heyman. Caitlin Foord built on that momentum just minutes later, scoring off of a rebound in front of Zambia's net.\n\nFoord's goal is being reviewed for a possible foul and was nullified, keeping the game at 5-3 with Zambia in the lead.\n\nFrance waiting to explode with Tricolore joy\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nParis La Défense Arena filled with bleu, blanc and rouge in hopes of celebrating a new national hero.\n\nThe weight of a nation has fallen on the wide shoulders of former Arizona State swimmer Léon Marchand, going for gold in the 400-meter individual medley.\n\nApproximately 13 minute before the race the crowd broke into “La Marseillaise” without any prompting and chants of “Leon, Leon!\n\nThe race will unfold at 8:30 p.m. local time, 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nTennis: Gauff wins Olympic debut match in straight sets\n\nCoco Gauff wins the first match of her Olympic debut in straight sets, beating Australia's Ajla Tomljanović without ceding a single game.\n\nGauff, 20, will advance onto the next round, furthering her quest to add an Olympic gold medal to her arsenal of trophies.\n\nGymnastics: Japan advances to final after team captain sent home for smoking\n\nThe Japanese team qualified for the women's gymnastics team final after their best gymnast and team captain, Shoko Miyata, was removed from the Olympic team for underage smoking.\n\nMiyata, 19 was a few months shy of the legal smoking age in Japan, which is 20.\n\nThe women’s squad competed with just four athletes instead of five after the Japanese Olympic Committee denied Japan Gymnastics Association's request to replace Miyata with an alternate.\n\nFans share emotional reactions to Céline Dion’s comeback at Paris Olympics\n\nCéline Dion promised herself she would return to the stage. On Friday, her first live performance in more than four years drew an outpouring of emotional support in Paris and around the world.\n\nClosing out the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, Dion belted her powerful rendition of French singer Édith Piaf’s “Hymne à l’amour” from a sparkling Eiffel Tower.\n\nDion has been open about her battle with stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder causing muscle rigidity and spasms that sometimes affect Dion’s control over her vocal chords.\n\nBut the singer’s performance Friday left the audience in awe as fans rushed to share their adulation.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSoccer: Zambia is winning in fight for survival out of the group stage\n\nThe first half of Zambia and Australia's women's soccer game in Nice today has been a thrilling display of offensive power as both teams attempt to claw their way out of last place in Group B.\n\nZambia's star forward Barbra Banda and Rachael Kundananji have led the African team to its 4-2 lead. Though Australia has held the game in ball possession, Zambia's precision and accuracy in the box has pushed them ahead.\n\nThe two teams went into the game tied for last in the group as they each lost 3-0 in their first matches earlier this week. Zambia now leads Group B in goals, but that might be short lived as Germany and the U.S. play later today.\n\nAustralia has to rally in the second half if they want to have any hope of making it out of the first round of the tournament and advancing into the knockout stage of the Olympic games.\n\nTennis: Gauff wins first set\n\nCoco Gauff has won the first set of her tennis match against Australia's Ajla Tomljanović.\n\nThe second set is underway — one more won set will put Gauff through to the next round.\n\nSkateboarding: Japan's teens top the podium in women's street\n\nIn the women's street final that consisted entirely of teenagers, Japan dominated once again, with 14-year-old Coco Yoshizawa taking gold and 15-year-old Liz Akama taking silver. Both made their Olympic debuts.\n\nThe bronze medal went to Brazil's Rayssa Leal, who won the silver in Tokyo. After struggling in the preliminary rounds, she showed grit in the final, earning her a second Olympic medal at just 16 years old.\n\nSince skateboarding made its Olympic debut in Tokyo, Japan and Brazil have been the only countries to win medals in women's street.\n\nAmerican Poe Pinson, 19, made her Olympic debut and finished fifth. American Paige Hyen, 16 also made her Olympic debut and finished sixth, though she earned additional points by skating switch, meaning she can ride the board with either foot forward.\n\nSoccer: Zambia player scores hat trick to lead 4-2\n\nZambia's Barbra Banda shot the ball into the top right corner of the Australian goal just before half time, getting herself a hat trick at the Olympic level.\n\nIt's Banda's seventh hat trick on the international stage, a remarkable feat for the 24-year-old forward.

The forward became the most expensive female player in the sport earlier this year with the trade that landed her in California.\n\nWater polo: Italy defeats U.S. in men's opener\n\nOn the first day of men's water polo in Paris, Italy won 12-8 against the U.S. team. The pool of competitors in this sport runs deep, as five of the 12 nations have won a world championship medal since Tokyo.

Durant was especially impressive. Playing with the team for the first time after missing exhibition play with a calf injury, Durant missed only one shot, connecting on 8-of-9 from the field.\n\nThree-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokić recorded 20 points, eight assists and five rebounds for Serbia, which was overwhelmed by the U.S.’s NBA talent. Serbia began the game on a 10-2 run in what was a back and forth first quarter. But after taking the lead late in the first, USA never relinquished it the rest of the game.\n\nUSA’s next game is vs. South Sudan on Wednesday. Serbia will face Puerto Rico on the same day.\n\nSoccer: Zambia and Australia game tied 1-1 with early goals\n\nZambia and Australia are fighting to get out of a last place tie in Nice, France, today, both scoring early goals to make the game 1-1 only seven minutes into the match.\n\nZambia and Australia both lost 3-0 earlier this week in their matches: Australia falling to Germany and Zambia losing to the U.S. Because the scores were the same, that means the group's first and last positions were tied going into today's matches. Germany and the U.S. are tied for first, with Australia and Zambia both in last place.\n\nBut a goal in the first minute of the game from Zambia showed the African team was going in with an aggressive offensive. Australia equalized moments later, marking an already fast paced game.\n\nTeam USA takes on Germany later today and will play Australia on Wednesday.\n\nGymnastics: Watch the highlights from women's subdivision 3\n\nHighlights from the third subdivision of the women's gymnastics qualifications include Filipa Martins, Luisa Blanco, Aleah Finnegan, Rina Kishi and Sanne Wevers.\n\nJapan's Kishi led the cycle in her all-around qualifying score but did not surpass Simone Biles. Biles also remains at the top of vault and floor scores. Team USA still leads in its qualifying score for the team all-around.\n\nDurant chasing history\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nKevin Durant is closing in on the USA Basketball career Olympic points record. Lisa Leslie had 488. Durant went into Paris with 435 and is on pace to break it in the next game.\n\nBasketball: USA leading by 15 late in fourth\n\nUSA is up 91-76 with four minutes and 19 seconds to go. The finish is important here—Serbia will need to keep it close to help itself in the Group C standings, as point differential could be a factor moving forward.\n\nSoccer: Japan wins it after late comeback\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nIn a stunning turn during stoppage time, Japan won 2-1 over Brazil after Momoko Tanikawa bombed one from beyond the penalty box following a turnover.\n\nJapan's shocking comeback in the sixth minute of stoppage time was desperately needed after they lost 2-1 to Spain and likely could not afford to drop another one to survive group stage.\n\nBatten's silver is best U.S. showing in Olympic mountain biking\n\nHaley Batten’s silver medal in mountain biking is the best the U.S. has done in the discipline in the Games.\n\nIn a sport often dominated by Swiss and French riders — Switzerland’s Jolanda Neff, Sina Frei and Linda Indergand swept the podium in Tokyo — Batten’s second-place finish stands out.\n\nThe last time the U.S. medaled was the 2012 London Olympics, where Georgia Gould won bronze. That Games was also the best showing for the men with a 10th place finish for Todd Wells.\n\nBefore that, an American hadn’t been on the podium since the 1996 Atlanta Games, when Susan Demattei won the bronze in the sport’s Olympic debut.\n\nEyes are now on Team USA’s Christopher Blevins, who finished in 14th in Tokyo, and Olympic newcomer Riley Amos (first coached by Wells) as they are expected to compete in the men’s race tomorrow.\n\nSoccer: Japan ties it with penalty in stoppage time\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nJapan's Saki Kumagai blew one past Brazilian goalie Laurie's lefthand side after the stopper guessed wrong and went the other way.\n\nThe spot kick at 90'+1 tied the score at 1-1.\n\nBasketball: USA leading after three quarters, Jayson Tatum absent\n\nUSA leads Serbia 84-65 after three quarters.\n\nLeBron James and Kevin Durant have been dominant for the States, combining for 41 points on 16-17 shooting. They’ve been the most impressive players for USA so far, which is overwhelming Serbia with its depth. Nikola Jokić has been great for his country, recording 16 points, five assists and three rebounds, but it hasn’t been enough against the U.S.’s stacked roster.\n\nUSA’s roster is so stacked in fact. Jayson Tatum has yet to enter the game. The Boston Celtics star and 2024 NBA champ hasn’t seen any action through three quarters. The team hasn’t announced any injury for Tatum, so it seems to be a coach’s decision for right now. With Durant back after missing tune-up play with a calf injury, coach Steve Kerr has opted for more defensive options in the backcourt, with Jrue Holiday and Derrick White each getting run.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Kerr manipulates the roster moving forward. He has great options, and it makes sense to play less ball-dominant players than Tatum with Durant back on the wing.\n\nFrench gymnasts struggle in front of a home crowd\n\nThe French women's gymnastics team is off to a rough start at their home Olympics. It's only the second rotation of their subdivision and the reigning world team bronze medalists have already suffered several falls.\n\nMélanie de Jesus dos Santos, who trains alongside Simone Biles at her family's Texas gym, is the team's leader and is aiming to helm France to their first Olympic team medal.\n\nWomen's beach volleyball highlights: Brazil takes straight sets from Japan\n\nIn preliminary play, Brazilian duo Carolina Solberg and Bárbara Seixas defeated Japan’s Hasegawa Akiko and Miki Ishii, with a toss just inside the line from Barbara securing the win.\n\nThe Brazil duo, widely known as Carol and Bárbara, are the country's second team. Duda Lisboa and Ana Patrícia Ramos are ranked no. 1 in the world.\n\nThe U.S. is the other powerhouse in this event, tied with Brazil for the most (seven) women's beach volleyball medals. America's top threat for gold is Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes, who play their first preliminary game at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nBasketball: USA builds lead to double digits to start second half\n\nUSA has pushed its lead from nine to 12 to start the second half. Kevin Durant has been the hottest player on the States, but LeBron James has been impressive himself. He’s up to 14 points, five assists and three rebounds on 6-of-7 shooting from the field. USA is up 63-51.\n\nSoccer: Brazil goes up 1-0 over Japan\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nBrazilian forward Jheniffer scored the match's opening goal in the 56th minute with a strike from the top of the penalty box.\n\nShe was set up with an assist by Ludmila.\n\nCanada faces more allegations of drone use as team attempts appeal sanctions\n\nMarseille, France\n\nA complaint against the Canadian women’s national team for filming an opponent’s training session was made at the 2022 CONCACAF W Championship, which served as a qualification tournament for last summer’s Women’s World Cup.\n\nThe revelation is part of the fallout of an alleged drone spying scandal at the Olympics that has rocked Canada, the defending champions.\n\nFIFA banned coach Bev Priestman — who had already been sent home from France — for a year and imposed a hefty $226,000 fine on Canada Soccer. Soccer’s world governing body also docked Canada six points in the Olympics women’s soccer tournament.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the practices of its men’s and women’s soccer teams and how widespread the issue could be. Canadian officials said they suspected a “systemic ethical shortcoming.”\n\nA CONCACAF official confirmed a complaint at the 2022 W Championship but offered little details.\n\nCanada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said this week he learned of a possible drone incident involving the men’s national team at the recent Copa America.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada’s sanctions are likely heading for the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s special Olympic court in Paris.\n\nCanada Soccer and the Canadian Olympic Committee said late Saturday that they planned to appeal the points deduction, which make it difficult, but not impossible for Canada’s women to advance to the knockout round.\n\nIOC says it 'welcomes' organization committee clarification on opening ceremony\n\nThe International Olympic Committee published a statement following controversy surrounding an opening ceremony performance that upset some religious conservatives.\n\nIn a statement posted on X, the IOC said it has \"taken note of and welcomes the clarification\" given by the organizing committee earlier today about a sketch involving drag performers that resembled the Last Supper.\n\n\"In the daily press briefing, the Organising Committee said that there was never any intention to show disrespect towards any religious group or belief,\" the IOC said. \"The Organising Committee also said that if anyone was offended by certain scenes, this was completely unintentional and they were sorry.\"\n\nThe artistic director of the opening ceremony, Thomas Jolly, told BFM-TV today that his inspiration was “a pagan feast linked” to the gods of Olympus.\n\nBasketball: USA leads Serbia 58-49 at halftime\n\nReally exciting battle between USA and Serbia in the first half.\n\nThe first quarter was a seesaw affair as both sides traded runs for much of the action. The United States took control in the second, mostly because of Kevin Durant, who has 21 points on 8-of-8 shooting, hitting all five of his threes. After missing all of exhibition play with a calf injury, Durant — the leading scorer in Olympics history — hasn’t missed a beat since stepping on the floor. He’s been aided by LeBron James and Steph Curry, who have 12 and 6 points, respectively.\n\nUSA’s depth is definitely an issue for Serbia, which struggled mightily when Nikola Jokić went to the bench. The Joker is keeping his country close, though. He has 12 points and 4 assists, and is dominating his individual matchups vs. the U.S. bigs. He even got the better of Joel Embiid on multiple occasions, as the Philadelphia 76ers center hasn’t looked his best in the first half.\n\nNotably, with Durant back, Jayson Tatum seems to be out of the United States rotation for now.\n\nChinese duo wins fierce table tennis battle\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nWang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha of China avoided table tennis disaster on Sunday, rallying to beat Lin Yun-ju and Chen Szu-yu of Chinese Taipei in a quarterfinal mixed doubles contest tinged by equal parts sport and political intrigue.\n\nTop-seeded Wang and Sun trailed, 2-1, before winning the final three games at South Paris Arena to put away the courageous, upset-minded Chinese Taipei pair.\n\nThe world’s current No. 1 mixed-double team, Wang and Sun, represent a country that's long claimed sovereignty over the self-governing democratic island of Taiwan.\n\nThe nation of 1.4 billion people, China, has been the world's most dominant table tennis program for decades, having won four of five table tennis medals in Tokyo. China fell short in just one event, mixed doubles, and the program made this event a priority in hopes of capturing that five-gold sweep in Paris.\n\nTennis: Nadal wins third set 6-4\n\nNadal is moving forward in the Olympic tournament after defeating Fucsovics 6-4 in the final set of their match today.\n\nThe Spaniard's record 14 French Open wins certainly helped him on the red clay of Roland Garros as Fucsovics fought hard in the second and third sets of the game. Nadal started off strong in the first round, but Fucsovics increasingly challenged him in the second and third rounds culminating an exciting back-and-forth.\n\nFans erupted in joy at the end of the match as Nadal hit the final game point. He signed a few of the match balls to send into the crowd following his win.\n\nSoccer: Penalty save by Brazil keeps it scoreless at halftime\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nJapan's Mina Tanaka's penalty kick was saved by Brazilian goalie Lorena, who made a diving stop to her left in stoppage time before the first-half whistle.\n\nThe penalty was awarded after Brazilian defender Rafaelle Souza committed a handball in the box.\n\nThe score is 0-0 at halftime.\n\nBasketball: Nikola Jokić is an MVP too\n\nNikola Jokić has Serbia’s last nine points, including a 1-and-1 against rival Joel Embiid in the post and a three over Embiid from the right wing. Serbia is hanging around despite a big run from the U.S. to start the third quarter. It’s 43-36 USA with just under four minutes to go.\n\nSouth Korea's unequivocal archery dominance continues with 10th women's gold\n\nJust moments ago, South Korea continued its undefeated streak in women's archery by winning the gold medal for the 10th time, beating China in a nail-biting finale that came down to the final arrow in a tiebreaker shootout.\n\nThe triumphant South Korean trio of Jeon Hunyoung, Lim Sihyeon and Nam Suhyeon did not include any members from the winning team in Tokyo.\n\nIf any sport in the Olympics is dominated by one country like no other, it's women's archery. Since the South Korean women's team made its Olympic debut in the 1988 Seoul Games, no other team has won the gold medal. Even the U.S. men's basketball team had a bronze hiccup in 2004. By the next Games in Los Angeles, South Korea will have dominated for 40 years.\n\nArchery requires immense concentration and precision, at a level of perfection that casual viewers cannot fully grasp. The need for consistent execution is perhaps what makes the art so mesmerizing, and South Korea certainly makes it more exciting to watch.\n\nThe country had already made history Thursday, when 21-year-old Lim Si-hyeon shot a world record 694 in the women's individual ranking round, breaking the previous record held by fellow Korean Kang Chae-young.\n\nMeanwhile, America will send its best in Casey Kaufhold, who is ranked No. 1 in the world and hopes to become the first American female individual gold medalist in the sport since 1976.\n\nBasketball: Kevin Durant is cooking\n\nKevin Durant missed every exhibition game leading up to Paris and it has not mattered. The USA leads 32-23 two minutes and two seconds into the second quarter, in large part thanks to Durant. KD hasn’t missed a shot since entering the game — he’s 4 of 4 from the field with a game-high 11 points.\n\nBasketball: USA leads 25-20 after first quarter\n\nA game of runs in the first quarter between the United States and Serbia! We went from 10-2 Serbia to 12-2 USA to 8-0 Serbia back to 11-0 USA. Fun stuff.\n\nThe United States’ depth is definitely going to be an issue for all countries moving forward. Bringing Kevin Durant off the bench seems a little unfair. Serbia’s offense predictably took a dip when Nikola Jokić came off the floor, and USA capitalized in his absence.\n\nIt’s been an entertaining battle so far, and the refs are letting both teams be pretty physical. Notably, Jayson Tatum hasn’t entered yet for the U.S. as Steve Kerr figures out his rotation.\n\nBasketball: Serbia responds to USA run, Kevin Durant back\n\nIncredible back-and-forth action between the U.S. and Serbia. The game started with a 10-2 run from Serbia. The U.S. stormed back with a 12-2 run to take the lead. But Serbia just scored eight straight points to lead 20-14.\n\nAnd then Kevin Durant checked in for the first time as a member of this team and promptly drilled a three.\n\nBasketball: USA finding its footing vs. Serbia\n\nTwo Devin Booker threes, a LeBron and-1 and the U.S. is right back in it against Serbia. After a 10-2 start by the Serbians, the States stormed back with a 12-2 run to take a 14-12 lead. It turns out LeBron James in transition is an international problem.\n\nTable Tennis: Nail-biting mixed doubles quarterfinal between China and Taiwan underway\n\nThe mixed doubles table tennis quarterfinals are unfolding dramatically, as China lost its first game to Taiwan. It came back strong to win the second game, and is now tied 1-1.\n\nThis is the only gold medal China missed out on in Tokyo, so a lot is riding on this match.\n\nBasketball: USA starts slow vs. Serbia\n\nSerbia is off to a hot start!\n\nThe Serbians have taken a 10-2 lead vs. USA less than three minutes into the first quarter of their Group C showdown. The U.S. looks uncomfortable offensively, its only score coming off a LeBron James steal and fast-break dunk.\n\nSerbia is playing physical and taking advantages of mismatches on offense. Anthony Davis just checked in for Joel Embiid after a U.S. timeout.\n\nSoccer: Early fouls in match between Brazil and Japan\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe opening minutes of the match between Brazil and Japan in women's soccer saw multiple fouls and the game's first yellow card.\n\nLauren from Brazil was booked in the game's third minute for tackling Japan's Mina Tanaka near midfield.\n\nTennis: Fucsovics rallies against Nadal in thrilling second set\n\nMárton Fucsovics offered a rousing rally at the beginning of the second set, ultimately winning against Rafael Nadal 6-4.\n\nThe Hungarian started off strong after losing in the first round of the match and forced Nadal to push back hard. And he did. Nadal came back to give fans a rousing display from both players.\n\nSpectators began to chant the Spaniards name as he forced his way back in the ninth game of the set.\n\nBut Fucsovics fought tooth and nail to secure the set, equalizing against Nadal as they go into their third set of the match.\n\nParis 2024 organizers say Opening Ceremony's 'Last Supper' sketch was never meant to cause offense\n\nA spokesperson for the Paris 2024 organizing committee has apologized after a sketch in Friday's Opening Ceremony caused fury among the Christian community.\n\nThe segment, intended as a parody of Leonardo Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper', saw drag performers portray a 21st-century re-creation of the scene, with one performer, singer Philippe Katerine, painted blue and practically naked with little more than a bunch of flowers covering his modesty.\n\n“Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group. (The opening ceremony) tried to celebrate community tolerance,” Paris 2024 communications director Anne Descamps told a press conference Sunday.\n\n“We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense we are really sorry.”\n\n32-year-old twins lead Dutch gymnastics team\n\nSanne and Lieke Wevers, 32, have been an integral part of Olympic gymnastics since 2016. In addition to transcending age barriers in the sport, the Wevers sisters have had their fair share of accolades.\n\nSanne won a gold medal on beam at the 2016 Rio Olympics and Lieke was the first Dutch woman to win a European title in gymnastics.\n\nBasketball: USA set to face Serbia to begin gold medal defense\n\nThe U.S. men’s basketball team tips off its gold medal defense Sunday against Nikola Jokić and Serbia.\n\nUSA’s roster is headlined by LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, who are teaming up in the Olympics for the first time. Durant is expected to make his return to the lineup Sunday after missing every exhibition game in the lead-up to Paris with a calf injury. The United States went 5-0 during warmup play, surviving close matchups against South Sudan and Germany.\n\nUSA and Serbia faced off earlier this month on July 17, with the U.S. winning 105-79. Curry was the leading scorer in that game, pacing both sides with 24 points. Jokić, a three-time NBA MVP, had 16 points and 11 rebounds in that game.\n\nUSA is a heavy favorite to win another gold medal, which they’ve done at every Olympics since 2008. The roster is stacked with all-time NBA superstars—James, Curry, Durant—as well an up-and-coming generation of potential greats, such as Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards and Devin Booker, to name a few.\n\nBoth USA and Serbia are opening their group play Sunday. South Sudan currently leads Group C after a win over Puerto Rico.\n\nBasketball: Canada holds off Greece despite Giannis' monster haul\n\nLast night marked 'Greek Freak' Giannis Antetokounmpo's Olympic debut and he was in monstrous form, putting up 34 points. But it wasn't quite enough as a Canadian side laden with NBA stars including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander held on to claim an opening win.\n\nTeam USA, featuring LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, get their Olympic campaign underway at 11:15 a.m. ET.\n\nRugby star brought to tears meeting sprint legend Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\n\n\"I saw royalty,\" New Zealand sevens star Michaela Blyde said on Instagram, brought to tears after spotting Jamaican track legend Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in the Olympic village. Later, the two met in an emotional embrace, a heartwarming moment captured on video.\n\nBlyde was the first female player to win back-to-back World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year titles, in 2017 and 2018. At the Tokyo Games in 2021, she helped lead New Zealand to a gold medal victory. Her hero, Fraser-Pryce, is known as one of the greatest sprinters of all time, with eight Olympic medals, including two golds in the 100m.\n\nNCAA gymnasts represent an array of countries\n\nLevi Jung-Ruivivar is a former U.S. national team member and incoming freshman at Stanford University, where she will compete in NCAA gymnastics. Her lifelong Olympic dreams became a reality after training at WOGA Gymnastics in Texas, but she won't be wearing stars and stripes on her leotard.\n\nShe is representing the Philippines in gymnastics after obtaining citizenship through her ancestral heritage — a route to the Olympics that is growing increasingly common as a deep field of American gymnasts competes for just five Olympic spots.\n\nNCAA Champion from LSU, Aleah Finnegan, and UCLA standout, Emma Malabuyo, also switched their delegations from the U.S. to the Philippines and are competing in the third subdivision. Malabuyo was an alternate for the U.S. Olympic team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAlabama's Luisa Blanco and Denver's Lynnzee Brown are competing for Colombia and Haiti, respectively.\n\nTeenagers set to star in women's street skateboarding final\n\nWhen skateboarding made its debut at the Tokyo Olympics, the medalists in the women's street competition were all aged 16 or younger, setting a new record for the youngest average age of a podium in Olympic history.\n\nThat podium was topped by Japan's Momiji Nishiya, then 13 years old. Another 13-year-old, Brazil's Rayssa Leal, took silver and bronze was won by Japan's Funa Nakayama.\n\nNishiya failed to qualify for these Games amid a stacked Japanese squad, but Leal and Nakayama are back and both finished in the top eight of qualifying to progress to the final.\n\nThe street event has been dominated by Japan in recent years with six Japanese women ranked in the top 10 of the event's world rankings. Fellow teenagers Coco Yoshizawa, aged 14, and Liz Akama, 15, qualified first and second, while Australia's Chloe Covell, 14, will also challenge for a medal.\n\nTeam USA will have two skaters in the eight-strong field for the final. Paige Heyn, aged 16, qualified in 6th and will be joined by 19-year-old Poe Pinson, who will be one of the eldest in the field at 19. The women's street final takes place at 11 a.m. ET (5 p.m. local) .\n\nThe new dream team? U.S. men’s basketball team face a much tougher path than their 1992 peers\n\nThe 1992 U.S. men’s basketball team is considered one of the best sports teams ever assembled. Led by Michael Jordan alongside Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, the U.S. were dominant in Barcelona as they went undefeated on their way to gold.\n\nThe Team USA of these Games is also stacked, drawing comparisons to the legendary 1992 squad. LeBron James will appear at his first Olympics since 2012. With him are a host of other NBA superstars, such as Kevin Durant, who could win a record fourth gold medal in Paris, and Steph Curry, who will make his long-awaited Olympic debut.\n\nThe rest of the world will be chasing down the Americans who are once again the favorites for gold, but with basketball going increasingly global, there are many more international NBA stars competing against Team USA than there were in 1992.\n\nFrance took silver in Tokyo and will be able to call upon last year’s first overall draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, and NBA veterans Rudy Gibert and Evan Fournier. Serbia’s Nikola Jokic and Greece’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, who between them have won the NBA MVP award in five of the last six seasons, are also at the Games — Team USA’s opener is against Jokic’s Serbia today.\n\n“Our game is global now, man. So all these guys are huge stars in their own ways,” Durant said ahead of the Games. “They’re all the best of the best in the world.”\n\nIndeed if Team USA are to win a fifth straight gold medal at these Olympics, they are going to have to be at the top of their game. The team are fresh from two exhibition games in London, and they were far from perfect.\n\nThey narrowly escaped a huge upset against South Sudan before coming from behind at the end of the third quarter to beat Germany in their final warm-up game. Those games proved a timely reminder that gold in Paris is not a given and that the rest of the world is snapping at the U.S.’s heels.\n\nBasketball: LeBron, Steph, K.D. to tip off soon against Serbia's Jokić\n\nThe American men’s basketball team tips off its Olympic tournament in an hour and will be 13.5-point favorites over Nikola Jokić’s Serbia.\n\nThe three-time MVP will be joined by Atlanta Hawks guard Bogdan Bogdanovic in what could be a competitive game against the United States which has won the last four men’s basketball golds.\n\nThe Americans, led by LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, narrowly beat South Sudan and Germany in their final tuneups before this opener in Lille. Tip is at 5:15 p.m. local time and Americans back home can watch the game on NBC at 11:15 a.m. ET/8:15 a.m. PDT.\n\nTennis: Nadal takes first set 6-1\n\nRafael Nadal won his first set against Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, 6-1, with relatively few errors.\n\nThough Nadal had a few forehand errors in Game 6, the Spanish champion took the final game in just a matter of a few minutes to secure the first set of the match.\n\nAmerica's Kanak Jha advances to Round of 32 in table tennis\n\nJha defeated Korea’s Cho Daeseong 4-2 in the Round of 64 in men’s table tennis singles. He will compete in the Round of 32 on Wednesday.\n\nIn his first Olympics in Rio, Jha was the youngest member of the entire U.S. delegation at 16. Now 24, he makes his third Olympic appearance as the only male table tennis player representing the U.S. in Paris. The U.S. has yet to win a medal in the sport.\n\nEarlier this year, Jha set up a Gofundme to support his path to Paris, citing the financial burdens of maintaining his training and competitions. He has raised over $12,000, though it is short of his $100,000 goal.\n\nWatch Simone Biles' explosive floor routine in qualification round\n\nThe gymnastics GOAT pushed through calf pain this morning to lead Team USA to the top of the leaderboard after the second subdivision. Her individual qualifying score was also the highest of the cycle.\n\nCycling: American Haley Batten takes home silver\n\nReporting from Élancourt, France\n\nTeam USA’s Haley Batten clinches silver in the women’s cross-country cycling after narrowly winning an epic battle with Sweden’s Jenny Rissveds for second place.\n\nThe gold medal never seemed in doubt for France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who never looked like surrendering her wide lead on the undulating course at Élancourt Hill west of Paris.\n\nBatten and Rissveds spent much of the seven-lap race glued to each others’ wheels, frequently swapping places as they battled it out.\n\nBatten pulled away at the end of the last lap and pointed to the sky as she crossed the line. After the brutal contest, she shared a long embrace with the Swede while still on their bikes.\n\nStill breathless from her silver medal victory, Batten spoke to NBC News about the brutal race-long battle with Rissveds.\n\n“We’ve had just the most epic and most exciting battles all year,” said Batten, 25, from Park City, Utah. “I know Jenny really well, and we support each other; I’ve actually looked up to her for a long time. I knew what her strengths and weaknesses are. But more than anything, I just wanted it really bad. I focused on myself today, and I fought so hard.”\n\nShe thought her medal chance had gone when she busted her wheel on an earlier lap. But thanks to a swift wheel change from “the best mechanic in the world,” as she put it, she soon climbed back up the positions.\n\nAsked how she finally bested Rissveds, Batten said that the Swede “did one pretty big attack and I was able to hold on. I knew that might be one of her last attacks.” She added, “My strength is to be really strong in the in the end of the race. And so I waited for that and I chose my moment.”\n\nRafael Nadal on court at Roland Garros, would set up Djokovic meeting with a win\n\nRafael Nadal has taken to the court at Roland Garros, opening his men's singles campaign against Hungary's Marton Fucsovics.\n\nVictory for the Spaniard would set up a mouthwatering 2nd round match against Novak Djokovic.\n\nRatings for opening ceremony best since 2012\n\nThe watery spectacle of Friday’s opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Games delivered 28.6 million viewers for NBCUniversal platforms, making it the most-watched kick-off for a summer Olympics since London in 2012.\n\n“Last night’s Opening Ceremony, one of the most ambitious and complex in Olympic history, was a spectacle for those in attendance in Paris, delivered a huge audience across our NBCU platforms, and set records for Peacock,” said NBC Sports President Rick Cordella. “Thanks to the tireless effort of our production and engineering teams, and extensive promotion, we are off to a strong start that is in line with the expectations of our NBC stations, and distribution and advertising partners. We are in great position as we look forward to the next two weeks of competition.”\n\nJade Carey: 'I haven't been feeling the best'\n\nAfter an uncharacteristic mistake on floor prevented her from defending her Olympic title, Carey said she has been feeling unwell in Paris.\n\n\"i haven’t been feeling the best the past few days but i gave it everything i had today. thank you for all the support i have received. i’m so grateful,\" Carey said in a post on X.\n\nCarey’s coach and father, Brian, was absent from Thursday's podium training after USA Gymnastics said he was not feeling well. He returned for today's qualification round.\n\nFencing: Lee Kiefer on course as she looks to defend women's individual foil gold\n\nTeam USA's Lee Kiefer is into the quarterfinals of the women's individual foil as she looks to make history and become only the second American to win two fencing golds.\n\nKiefer, seeded second in this competition, comfortably beat China's Qianqian 15-9 in the last 16 at the magnificent Grand Palais and will face Hungary's 23rd seed Flora Pasztor at 9:55 a.m. ET.\n\nTeammate Lauren Scruggs is also through to the last eight where she faces top seed Arianna Errigo of Italy.\n\nGymnastics: Jade Carey vaults back\n\nAfter a surprising mistake on floor earlier, Jade Carey lost her chance to defend her gold medal from Tokyo on the event. Carey shone on vault right after, however, rallying and securing a spot in the final for that event.\n\n'Bob the Cap Catcher' dives to the rescue in swimming pool\n\nPicture the scene, you've lost your swimming cap in the Olympic pool. Who is going to come to your rescue? There's only one man for the job - meet Bob the Cap Catcher!\n\nTeam USA impress in surfing qualifiers in stunning Tahiti\n\nThe surfing events got underway yesterday in the stunning surroundings of Teahupo'o in Tahiti, one of the world's most famous surfing spots, and the Team USA surfers certainly impressed.\n\nAll three of Team USA's female surfers advanced directly to round 3 with Caroline Marks getting the biggest score of the day. She will be joined by defending gold medalist Carissa Moore and Caitlin Summers.\n\nThe U.S. men were equally as impressive with John John Florence and Griffin Colapinto getting the day's two biggest scores.\n\nCycling fans enjoy some sunshine ahead of the women's cross-country event\n\nÉlancourt, France\n\nA beautiful day in the countryside just outside Paris sees thousands of people descend on a hill overlooking the city for the women’s cross-country cycling.\n\nAmerican fans will be hoping Haley Batten and Savilia Blunk can place among the medals.\n\nWith the weather switching from pouring rain to baking sun, it’s like a mini-festival at the 15,000 capacity Éleancourt Hill. Your reporter has climbed the 231-metre summit, the highest point in the Ile-de-France, for a view of the action which is about to start.\n\nU.S. gymnastics technical lead: Simone Biles' perseverance is 'remarkable'\n\nand\n\nBeijing 2008 silver medalist and U.S. women's technical lead, Chellsie Memmel, said that she is satisfied with Team USA's performance, but hopes for some improvements ahead of Tuesday's team final.\n\nTheir struggles came primarily on floor, where reigning Olympic champion Jade Carey had an uncharacteristic stumble.\n\n\"I think they rallied together,\" Memmel said. \"I think that says the strength of their team bond, just that they came together, they turned the page after floor and rallied around each other.\" She added, \"if you would have asked me like 20 minutes ago, I might have felt like I was going to puke, but overall they did a good job.\"\n\nMemmel had yet to speak with Simone Biles and the team's medical staff, but said that “What [Biles] was able to do, with looking like she had some soreness or something in her lower leg, is remarkable.\"\n\nBiles' coach: 'She felt a little pain in her calf'\n\nand\n\nCecile Landi, Simone Biles' personal coach and the Olympic team coach, said after the qualification round that Biles \"felt a little pain in her calf\" during her floor exercise warmup.\n\nShe said that, despite experiencing pain, Biles \"never in her mind\" considered pulling out of the competition. The apparent injury was also bothering Biles in training a couple of weeks ago, according to Landi, but had improved until today's flare-up.\n\nBy the time Biles competed on bars, her final event, Landi said Biles felt better. When asked if Biles' ability to compete this week was in question, Landi said, \"No, not at the moment.\"\n\nLeon Marchand sends crowd wild, eases through 400m Individual Medley heats\n\nFrench poster boy Leon Marchand thrilled the crowds at the La Defense Arena as he convincingly qualified for the final of the men's 400m Individual Medley this morning.\n\nMarchand wasn't near his world-record pace, but with the crowd at fever pitch, the 22-year-old — he's coached by Michael Phelps's long-time coach Bob Bowman at Arizona State — still comfortably qualified fastest for tonight's final.\n\nFrance hasn't won gold in the pool since 2012, but the dominant Marchand, one of the biggest French stars at these Games, looks set to end that drought in Paris. The swimmer has been tearing up the record books over the last few years and is a gold medal favorite in four events.\n\nThe 400m medley sees swimmers swim 100m in each of the four recognized Olympic swimming strokes: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. Team USA's Chase Kalisz, the defending gold medalist in this event, missed out on making the final, though America will be represented by Carson Foster, who qualified fourth fastest.\n\nEight years ago Kristen Faulkner didn’t know how to clip into a bike — now she’s an Olympic cyclist\n\nU.S. Olympian Kristen Faulkner didn’t seriously start riding a bike until 2017 when she needed an outdoor hobby. Shortly after she moved to New York City for a venture capital job, she developed a passion for cycling in her spare time.\n\n“It was kind of my outlet every day to get into Central Park and ride for two hours away from the bustle of the city,” Faulkner told NBC News.\n\nBut it didn’t come without some initial growing pains.\n\n“I couldn’t clip in” to the bike, she said. “And I was like, ‘Why is this not working?’ I was starting to get really embarrassed. Finally, we realized I just had incompatible cleats and pedals.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nNadal, Wozniacki, Wawrinka and Monfils all on court today\n\nParis\n\nSome of the biggest, veteran names of tennis will be on the Roland-Garros clay today in hopes of rekindling past magic.\n\nParis 2024 has attracted some of the sport’s biggest contemporary names, such as Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff. But this tournament isn’t a top priority for many players because it’s not a Grand Slam. That opens the door to some high-profile players in the twilight of their career.\n\nAction began at noon local time 7:00 a.m. ET with 22-time major winner Rafael Nadal, 38, playing the second match at center court against Hungarian Márton Fucsovics.\n\nStan Wawrinka, 39, and Caroline Wozniacki, 34, are slated to play in the fourth and fifth matches slated for Court Simonne-Mathieu, while French favorite Gaël Monfils, 37, is set for the day’s fourth match on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.\n\nUSA Gymnastics coach concerned about Biles' ankle\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nChellsie Memmel, the technincal lead coach on the gymnastics squad, spoke after Team USA raced to the top of rankings. But the joyous mood was tempered by apprehension over Simone Biles' taped left ankle.\n\n\"I haven't even got to speak to Simone. I need to speak with our team, our medical team, but I don't have an answer about that. I just first and foremost, I just want to make sure she's physically okay,\" Memmel said, saying she was concerned.\n\nThat's it for U.S. women's gymnastics\n\nAt the Bercy Arena, Team USA’s day is done. Simone Biles' biggest rival in the all-around, Rebeca Andrade, will compete later today.\n\nTeam USA's expected finalists\n\nThere are still three more subdivisions in this qualification round, but the U.S. women are on track to have representatives in each event final.\n\nSimone Biles is currently in eighth on bars, so her place there isn't guaranteed, but it's unlikely that anyone bumps Suni Lee out of the final. The all-around, vault, beam and floor finalists are in secure positions.\n\nAll-Around: Simone Biles and Suni Lee\n\nVault: Simone Biles and Jade Carey\n\nBars: Suni Lee and Simone Biles\n\nBeam: Simone Biles and Suni Lee\n\nFloor: Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles\n\nTeam USA cruises to first\n\nAs expected, the U.S. women dominated the qualification round. After the second of five subdivisions, they scored a 172.296, which is more than five points over Italy, China and Great Britain.\n\nNo other teams have the difficulty required to match that, so Team USA is expected to enter Tuesday's team final in first.\n\nTwo all-around champs to face off\n\nFor the first time, two Olympic all-around champions will go head-to-head in the all-around final – and they're both from the same country.\n\nSimone Biles (2016) and Sunisa Lee (2020) will make history regardless of where they finish in Thursday's final.\n\nLee does it by a tenth!\n\nBy less than a tenth, Sunisa Lee will overtake Jordan Chiles in the all-around standings.\n\nDue to the two-per-country rule, Simone Biles and Lee will be the U.S. representatives in the all-around final. Both are Olympic all-around champions.\n\nLee did a slightly more conservative routine, taking out one difficult connection and earning a 14.866. That will put her on track to make the bars final as well.\n\nBiles tops the all-around standings\n\nShe did not debut her new skill on bars today, but Biles did a stellar routine, earning a 14.433.\n\nThat will bring her to a 59.566 in the all-around and she is now in first place in the current standings. It is likely to stay that way.\n\nBiles' all-around score is best in this cycle\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nSimone Biles scored 59.566 in qualifying, a score that would have won the last two world championships.\n\nAccording to the Gymternet website, it is the world’s best all-around score in international competition in this Olympic cycle. Biles has scored higher domestically.\n\nChiles makes it tough for Lee\n\nA hit uneven bars routine from Jordan Chiles means that Sunisa Lee will have to fight for her chance to defend her medal. She will need a 14.800 to beat Chiles.\n\nBut first, Simone Biles on bars.\n\nRivera does her job on bars\n\nHer beam routine left a little to be desired, but Hezly Rivera will be much happier with a 13.900 on bars. Rivera's day is now done and the 16-year-old's Olympic debut is off to a great start.\n\nA Lee and Chiles showdown brewing\n\nThe U.S. women are well on their way to qualifying for every gymnastics event final, including the team final. As they prepare to close out this qualification round on bars, a tight race is emerging between Sunisa Lee and Jordan Chiles.\n\nThe two are currently within a point of each other and their performances on bars will determine who advances to the all-around final. Simone Biles is the overwhelming favorite to qualify in first place, but Lee and Chiles will battle it out for the second U.S. spot.\n\nLee, who has a higher starting value on bars, has the edge to defend her all-around title, but she must stay on.\n\nBiles nails the 'Biles II'\n\nHer warmup was a nail-biter, but Biles turned it on when it mattered. A 15.800 for her eponymous vault will almost certainly be the highest score we see all day.\n\nBiles is displaying incredible fortitude here; performing that vault on an ankle that may be bothering her is no easy feat.\n\nHer first vault score will count toward her all-around total. Her second vault, a Cheng, scored a 14.800. A 15.300 average will easily put her on track to make the vault final, along with her teammate, Jade Carey.\n\nCarey redeems herself on vault\n\nAlthough Jade Carey's devastating floor score will prevent her from defending her gold medal, she is on pace to contend for a vault medal.\n\nShe earned a 14.433 average with a Cheng and a double-twisting Yurchenko. Carey is capable of adding a half twist to the second vault, which we may see in the final\n\nThat will outscore Jordan Chiles. Simone Biles, who is arguably the best vaulter in the world along with Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, is up next.\n\nChiles makes her case for vault final\n\nTo qualify for a vault final, gymnasts must perform two vaults from two different \"families,\" which means they must do contrasting skills onto the table. Jordan Chiles did a double-twisting Yurchenko and a Lopez, averaging a 14.216.\n\nChiles is one of three U.S. gymnasts who will attempt two vaults, along with Jade Carey and Simone Biles. They are all capable of making the final, but again, only the top two Americans will qualify.\n\nThe best is yet to come for Lee\n\nVault is not Sunisa Lee's strongest event, but she cruised though it with a clean double-twisting Yurchenko. A 14.133 is a great score for Lee.\n\nShe'll wrap up her competition on her best event, the uneven bars.\n\nBiles in good spirits despite some limping\n\nWhile preparing to compete on vault, Simone Biles began to limp and hop on one foot down the runway. She landed short on a warmup of her \"Biles II\" vault, but appears to be all smiles despite the difficulties.\n\nBecause her eponymous vault is quite dangerous and short landings can put stress on her ankle, she will prefer to over-rotate rather than under-rotate it.\n\nThat's why Biles is the GOAT\n\nSimone Biles has the most difficult floor routine in the floor and she executed it with unmatched finesse.\n\nDespite getting her ankle taped after her one-touch warm up, she earned a 14.600. She and her training mate, Jordan Chiles, are on track to make the floor final.\n\nLuckily, Team USA will be able to drop Jade Carey's 10.633.\n\nBig miss for Carey\n\nThe reigning Olympic floor champion will not defend her title.\n\nDespite a strong start to her routine, Jade Carey's last tumbling pass ended in heartbreak. She appeared to get lost in the air on her double tuck, doing only a full tuck and rolling back out of bounds.\n\nA 10.633 will take her out of contention, but she still has vault ahead.\n\nChiles dances to her 'hype-woman' Beyoncé\n\nChiles delivered on floor and earned a 13.866. That's higher than Lee's score, but we'll see what reigning floor champion Carey can do.\n\nBiles gets her ankle taped\n\nWhile her teammates got the second rotation started, Biles got her left ankle wrapped. She will go last on floor, so she has some down time.\n\nLee maintains momentum on floor\n\nShe went out of bounds on her last pass, a double tuck, but Lee will take that.\n\nA score of 13.100 will keep the reigning all-around champ in the all-around race.\n\nBiles being looked at by a trainer\n\nAfter her beam routine, Biles consulted the team's athletic trainer. The next event is floor, which is the most physically taxing of the four.\n\nBiles flirts with perfection in Olympic return\n\nSimone Biles anchored the U.S. beam effort with a near-flawless routine and not a wobble in sight. She earned a huge 14.733 and will expect to join Sunisa Lee in the beam finals.\n\nThat's one of the best routines she has ever done in competition.\n\nLee stuns on beam\n\nDespite a rough podium training on the event, Sunisa Lee delivers a stunning beam routine when it counts. She opted for an easier mount, doing only a straddle mount instead of her risky layout, step-out.\n\nLee is in an excellent position to make beam finals with a 14.033.\n\nHezly Rivera is officially an Olympian\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but Rivera stayed on the beam in her first Olympic routine. A 12.633 isn't likely to get her into the final, but the U.S. can drop that score.\n\nTheir best beam workers, Lee and Biles, are up next.\n\nSolid start from Jordan Chiles\n\nChiles was a steady lead-off for the U.S., earning a 13.600 on beam despite a few balance checks.\n\nStars come out for women's gymnasts\n\nThe U.S. women's gymnastic team has drawn a galaxy of stars who've come to watch from the bleachers. Tom Cruise stopped to take selfies with fans, while Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande were also spotted elsewhere in the crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna Wintour has swapped sitting runway-side for the Bercy Arena. She's joined by director Baz Luhrmann and movie star Jessica Chastain."
