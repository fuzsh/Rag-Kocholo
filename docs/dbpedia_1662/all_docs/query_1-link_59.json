Harvard wins the two-mile contest and sets into motion a rivalry that thrives to this day. The Harvard and Yale heavyweight crews now hold an annual four mile contest on the Thames River in New London, CT, the longest race of its kind in the country.\n\nJune 19, 1858 - Red Bandanas\n\nHarvard distinguishes itself from its competition when Charles W. Eliot '53 purchases six red Chinese silk bandanas for his crew members to wear for that day's regatta. It is believed to be the first time a sports team features an identifying mark. Eliot later serves as Harvard's President from 1869 until 1909.\n\nFall 1859 - Shell Game\n\nThe first college racing \"shell\" built in America was the Harvard, a 40-foot, six-oared pine shell with iron outriggers, but without coxswain or rudder. Built for Harvard in the fall of 1857 it is first used against Yale in 1859.\n\nDecember 1862 - Freshmen Form Baseball Club\n\nHarvard's first baseball team, the '66 Baseball Club, is formed by freshmen George A. Flagg and Frank Wright. The team begins practice the following spring on Cambridge Common, the site where General George Washington had taken command of the Continental Army some 80 years earlier. The squad plays its first game on June 27, 1863, and scores a 27-17 victory over Brown in Providence. The game inaugurated intercollegiate baseball at Harvard, although only by class nines.\n\nJuly 15, 1865 - New England's Best Baseball Team\n\nHaving brought together the best of the class nines to form the Harvard University Base Ball Club, Harvard defeats a highly-touted amateur team from Lowell, 28-17, to win the Silver Ball, symbolic of New England supremacy. Four days later, Harvard plays its first official intercollegiate game and defeats Williams College, 35-30.\n\nAugust 27, 1869 - International Waters\n\nHarvard's first international competition takes place. A four-oar crew from Oxford edges Harvard in a four-and-a-quarter mile race on the Thames River in England.\n\nMay 14, 1874 - First Football Game\n\nFootball makes its Cambridge debut when Harvard accepts a proposal from McGill University for a two-game series at Jarvis Field, now the site of the Harvard Law School.

The contests lead directly to the present intercollegiate game of football.\n\nJuly 1874 - Track Gets Its Start\n\nIntercollegiate track is initiated at Harvard. Four undergraduates compete in a meet at Saratoga, NY, an event held in conjunction with the Intercollegiate Rowing Association championships.\n\nOctober 7, 1874 - Athletic Association Formed\n\nThe first Harvard Athletic Association is formed. Comprised entirely of undergraduates, this body takes general charge of track sports and gymnasium meetings for the next two decades. Benjamin R. Curtis '75 is chosen the HAA's first president.\n\nMay 6, 1875 - Crimson Pride\n\nHarvard students hold a plebiscite and overwhelmingly select Crimson as the school color and nickname. It defeats Magenta, a more purplish shade of red.\n\nJune 4, 1875 - Sharp-Dressed Men\n\nHarvard plays its first intercollegiate football game, hosting Tufts at Jarvis Field. Just as historic is that Harvard is outfitted in formal uniforms, believed to be the first time a team has been so identified. The squad is adorned in the newly-chosen school colors, with a uniform of white shirts and pants, with crimson trimming and crimson hose.\n\nNovember 13, 1875 - Let \"The Game\" Begin\n\nThe first Harvard-Yale football game is played. The Crimson wins this initial meeting, held at Hamilton Park in New Haven, with four goals and four touchdowns to no goals and no touchdowns for the Elis. Modified rugby rules are used with 15 men on each team. One year later the Intercollegiate Football Association is organized with Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia as members.\n\nNovember 1875 - Presidential Prowess\n\nA. Lawrence Lowell '77, who will go on to serve as Harvard's President from 1909 until 1933, sets school records in the 880 and the mile on the dirt track at Jarvis Field.\n\nApril 12, 1877 - First Catcher's Mask\n\nThe first baseball catcher's mask is used when inventor Fred Thayer '78 takes the concept of a fencing mask and adapts it for J. Alexander Tyng '76, Harvard's starting catcher. Tyng makes only two errors in his first game with the mask, an exceptionally low number for even a professional in that era.\n\nFall 1878 - Men's Lacrosse Debuts\n\nThe Harvard Lacrosse Association is established and the team begins play the following spring. Harvard wins national championships in 1881 and 1882 by defeating Yale and Princeton.\n\nSpring 1880 - Track's \"Golden Age\" Begins\n\nHarvard track enters its first \"Golden Age\" by winning the first of seven straight Intercollegiate titles. Evert Wendell '82 is the catalyst for the first championship, with his victories in the 100, 220, and 440 yard dashes. In 1886, Wendell Baker '86 sets a world's record for the 440 with a time of 47.75 seconds. He runs from a standing start on a straight-away dirt track and sets the mark despite losing his shoe 50 yards from the finish.\n\nFall 1880 - Tennis Association Formed\n\nThe Harvard Lawn Tennis Association is formed, a full year ahead of the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association.\n\nOctober 31, 1881 - East Meets West\n\nHarvard plays in the first East-West Intersectional football game when it hosts the University of Michigan at the South End Grounds in Boston. The Crimson wins this historic battle, 4-0, as part of its 6-1-1 season.\n\nFall 1881 - Courting Early Success\n\nRichard Sears '83 wins his first of seven straight national singles tennis titles, a feat that has never been equaled. He also wins the national doubles title five times with partner and coach Dr. James Dwight '74. Sears later becomes the first player elected to the International Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame; Dwight will serve as president of the USLTA for 20 years, and is regarded as the \"Father of American Tennis.\"\n\nJune 5, 1882 - Regulations Adopted\n\nThe Committee on the Regulation of Athletic Sports meets for the first time. The Committee is appointed by Harvard President Charles W. Eliot '53 after the Faculty complains of the baseball team's lengthy season (28 games). They adopt a set of regulations basic to all collegiate programs even today: 1-College teams and athletic clubs are to compete only with amateurs; 2-No trainers or coaches are to be employed without authority from the Committee; 3-Nobody is to take part in contests except after an examination by the Physical Director; 4-All oarsmen are to pass a swimming test before going on the river.\n\nSpring 1883 - Tennis Titles\n\nIn Hartford, CT, at the inaugural intercollegiate tennis championships, Harvard's Joseph S. Clark '83 wins the singles title and then teams with H.A. Taylor '86 for the doubles crown. By 1921, Harvard players have claimed 16 singles championships and 17 doubles titles.\n\nNovember 22, 1884 - Little Red Flag\n\n\"Little Red Flag,\" which is waved each time Harvard football scores against Yale, is believed to make its debut. The original small red flag is still carried to every Harvard-Yale game by the alumnus of the College who has seen the most consecutive games between the rivals.\n\nDecember 13, 1888 - First Collegiate Fencing Club\n\nThe Harvard Fencing Club held its first meeting with 35 of the 40 young men present signing up as charter members. The following spring, the Club crowned its first champion when J.M. Morton, Jr. '91 defeated J.T. Lincoln '92 in the finals, held at the old Hemenway Gymnasium.\n\nMarch 14, 1889 - Spring Practice\n\nHarvard holds what is believed to be the first spring football practice when captain Arthur J. Cumnock '91 leads the team in drills on Jarvis Field.\n\nSummer 1890 - Soldiers Field Donated\n\nHenry Lee Higginson '55 donates 31 acres to the University for \"Soldiers Field,\" in memory of six of his Harvard comrades lost while fighting for the Union. The University then purchases nine adjoining acres, to connect with 30 acres of marshy land given by Professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1870. By 1894, all of Harvard's outdoor athletics teams are playing at Soldiers Field, with the exception of track.\n\nNovember 22, 1890 - National Champions\n\nHarvard captures its first of seven national football championships. The Crimson defeats Yale, 12-6, on the season's final day, and finishes with an 11-0 record.\n\nNovember 19, 1892 - The Flying Wedge\n\nIn the second half of its game vs. Yale, Harvard introduces the infamous \"Flying Wedge,\" a momentum play conceived by chess expert Lorin F. Deland. The play is outlawed one year later because of its brutality.\n\nSpring 1893 - New HAA Formed\n\nThe Committee on the Regulation of Harvard Sports organizes the second Harvard Athletic Association for the operation and management of all sports engaged in by Harvard students. It remains in operation until 1951 when it becomes the Department of Athletics.\n\nNovember 30, 1893 - First African-American Captain\n\nWilliam H. Lewis L.S. becomes Harvard's first African-American captain when he is elected to the post prior to the Pennsylvania football game. The Harvard law student, who is later appointed an Assistant U.S. Attorney General by President Taft, had captained the Amherst football team in 1891. The first football scoreboard is used in the same game, a 26-4 win over the visiting Quakers.\n\nJanuary 1894 - New Sport Sets Sail\n\nThe Harvard Yacht Club, the forerunner of the Crimson's intercollegiate sailing program, is formed. Over the next half-century, the Club's honor roll will grow to include U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 and John F. Kennedy '40 and several Olympians, including gold medal winners Paul H. Smart '14, Hilary H. Smart '47, and George D. O'Day '45.\n\nMay 5, 1894 - A Fencing First\n\nHarvard fencing wins the first IFA Championship, and goes on to capture six of the first seven titles while producing three individual champions in the same span.\n\nJuly 1895 - The Oxford-Cambridge Meet\n\nA combined Harvard-Yale track team meets one from Oxford-Cambridge at the Queens Club in London.

Connolly '99 captures the hop, step, and jump at the Athens Games to earn his place in history. To make the trip, Connolly is forced to resign from the college, but is honored in 1949 when he receives a major H for his Olympic feats. By that time, he is a celebrated author of sea stories such as The Seiners and The Gloucestermen. Also at the 1896 Olympics, Ellery H. Clark '96 earns two gold medals by winning the high jump and long jump, Thomas E. Burke '01 takes the 100 and 400 meter dashes, and William W. Hoyt '98 is the gold medalist in the pole vault. In addition, John B. Paine '92 captures gold in the military pistol, and brother Sumner Paine '90 wins the gold in free pistol.\n\nJanuary 19, 1898 - Hockey Hits The Ice\n\nHarvard plays its first college hockey game when Brown defeats the Crimson on Boston's Franklin Field. The rivalry is the oldest continuing hockey series in the country.\n\nSpring 1898 - Radcliffe Takes Up Tennis...\n\nRadcliffe plays its first intercollegiate tennis match, defeating Wellesley College.\n\nDecember 12, 1898 - ...And Basketball Soon Follows\n\nThe original Hemenway Gymnasium, built on the Radcliffe campus, opens and a women's basketball team is fielded.

The sport gains popularity and, over the next decade, a strong rivalry develops with Smith College.\n\nFebruary 26, 1900 - Black-Tie Affair\n\nHarvard's hockey team meets Yale for the first time. The Elis win the black-tie affair, 5-4, at the St. Nicholas Rink in New York, but the Crimson answers back in the rematch the following winter, 4-0.\n\nDecember 7, 1900 - Men's Basketball Begins\n\nAt the urging of John Kirkland Clark, a Yale graduate attending Harvard Law School, the Athletic Committee officially recognizes the sport of men's basketball at Harvard. Clark becomes the Crimson's first captain and coach. Harvard's first intercollegiate game is a victory, 20-10 over Holy Cross.\n\nSpring 1900 - Harvard Man Starts The Davis Cup\n\nDwight Davis '00 funds an international tennis competition that becomes known as the Davis Cup.

The game is the final one on the old Soldiers Field gridiron, where the baseball team now plays.\n\nNovember 14, 1903 - Harvard Stadium Opens\n\nHarvard Stadium, America's oldest football stadium and arguably still its best because of fans' proximity to the action, opens with a game against Dartmouth College. The Stadium's construction will lead to one of the most revolutionary changes in the sport. In 1905, when football rule changes are discussed, one idea put forth is to widen the field by as much as 40 yards. But the Stadium's stands, which were built with reinforced concrete, could not be moved back to accommodate a wider field. Instead, the forward pass is adopted in time for the 1906 season.\n\nApril 1, 1905 - First College Soccer Match\n\nHarvard plays in the first intercollegiate soccer match against Haverford.

A house on Holyoke Street is leased and used by the school's four major teams-football, baseball, track, and crew-and also by the hockey team and the four freshman teams of the major sports.\n\nNovember 20, 1909 - Fish Finishes At Harvard\n\nHamilton Fish '10, a two-time football All-American in an era when only 11 players earn the distinction, completes his Harvard career. The rugged 6-4, 200-pound tackle graduates cum laude in 1910 and rises to the rank of Major in the Fourth Division Infantry during World War I. From 1920 until 1946, he serves in the United States Congress as a representative from New York. He will attend Harvard football games for the next 81 years before passing away in 1991.\n\nSpring 1910 - Gardner Garners 11 Letters\n\nGeorge Peabody Gardner '10 becomes the first Harvard man to be awarded 11 varsity letters.

Harvard wins the 1912 and 1913 national championships and defeats Yale four straight times during the streak.\n\nApril 9, 1912 - First At Fenway\n\nHarvard plays in the first baseball game held at Fenway Park. The Crimson takes on the Boston Red Sox in an exhibition contest, and drops a 2-0 decision. Four years later, Harvard defeats the Red Sox, 1-0.\n\nFall 1912 - Cross Country Title\n\nJust four years after the intercollegiate cross country championships begin, Harvard captures the national title.\n\nSpring 1913 - Soccer Champions\n\nHarvard wins the Intercollegiate Association Football [Soccer] League championship and four Crimson players make the All-American team. Harvard repeats as IAFL champs in the spring of 1914.\n\nSpring 1914 - A Titanic Recovery\n\nJust two years after surviving the tragedy on the Titanic, Richard N. Williams II '16 wins the U.S. collegiate and U.S. national singles championships. He later goes on to capture the 1920 doubles title at Wimbledon. Williams, who jumped off the sinking ship just before it capsized and then survived the night in the icy north Atlantic waters, had originally been told by doctors that his frozen legs needed to be amputated, but declared, \"I'd rather die than not be able to play tennis again.\"\n\nJuly 1914 - A Grand Performance\n\nHarvard's junior varsity crew becomes the first American entry to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, defeating Boston's Union Boat Club in what is called a \"Yankee Grand Final.\" Future Massachusetts governor and U.S. Senator Leverett Saltonstall '14 is the Crimson's stroke.

Goldthwait '24, who drowned following his sophomore year at Harvard.\n\nSpring 1921 - Tennis Takes Another Step\n\nA combined Harvard/Yale tennis team defeats one from Oxford/Cambridge at Newport Casino. Four years later, the biennial international event is named the Prentice Cup, in honor of Bernon Prentice '05.\n\nSpring 1921 - World Record Set\n\nEdward O. \"Ned\" Gourdin '21 sets a world record with his long-jump of 25-feet, 3-inches in the Harvard/Yale vs. Oxford/Cambridge track meet. More than 75 years later, the mark still stands as a Harvard record.\n\nWinter 1922 - Squash Makes A Racquet\n\nMen's squash, arguably the most successful of all of Harvard's sports, makes its debut. Harry Cowles coaches the team for its first 16 seasons and leads the Crimson to five national titles while mentoring 13 individual champions.\n\nWinter 1923 - First Women's Swimming Meet\n\nRadcliffe College meets Sargent College in the first women's intercollegiate swim meet.\n\nMarch 3, 1923 - The Night Hockey Changed Forever\n\nHarvard head coach William H.
