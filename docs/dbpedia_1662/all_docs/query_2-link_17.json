        "text": "Track cycling: Ellesse Andrews wins women's sprint gold\n\nAfter the first race in the women's sprint finals, Ellesse Andrews (NZL) leads the gold medal race against Lea Friedrich (GER), while Great Britain's Emma Finucane (GBR) has the lead for bronze.\n\nAnd Finucane easily wins the second race for the bronze medal to confirm her spot on the podium.\n\nHere's the second race for the gold. Can Andrews seal this 2-0?\n\nFriedrich moves first. Andrews comes around the outside with half a lap to go! And she pulls clear!\n\nEllesse Andrews wins her second gold of the Games and wins gold for New Zealand, adding to her keirin title!\n\nBasketball: Australia win women's bronze!\n\nIt came right down to the final 30 seconds, but a key block from Steph Talbot was followed up by a strong defensive effort from Australia to force a Belgian shot clock violation.\n\nBelgium were then forced to foul to stop the clock, but Australia knocked down all of their free throws to win 85-81 and claim the bronze!\n\nThe Opals celebrate wildly on the court, and now make their way to the stands to embrace family, friends, and the fans who presumably made the long trip from down under to be here.\n\nTrack cycling: Valente wins omnium elimination race to extend lead\n\nThe favourites have all stayed out of trouble in this women's omnium elimination race so far.\n\nThere was an earlier error from the race commisaires eliminating Poland's Daria Pikulik, but it was corrected and the race yellow flagged to let her chase back to the pack. She is finally eliminated in 10th place.\n\nFourth overall after the tempo race, Denmark's Amalie Dideriksen is eliminated in eighth â€“ that will drop her down the rankings quite a bit.\n\nWe're now down to four riders. Can Belgium's Lotte Kopecky do herself a big favour in the overall standings with a strong finish?\n\nShe's joined by the overall top three: Valente, Baker, and Maggie Coles-Lyster of Canada. And it is Kopecky who gets called.\n\nIt means our top three overall are also the last three in this race, and they will stay in the medal positions.\n\nColes-Lyster goes in third, meaning we're down to one final sprint for the lineâ€¦ and Jennifer Valente wins the race!\n\nThe Olympic champion extends her overall lead to 10 full points.\n\nModern pentathlon: Michelle Gulyas wins women's gold with new world record score\n\nClouvel has struggled on the laser range â€“ needing 14 shots to get her five green lights on her first visit â€“ and the Frenchwoman's dropped back to second, just barely keeping ahead of Republic of Korea's Seong Seungmin.\n\nHungary's Michelle Gulyas is clear at the front after some strong laser shooting.\n\nUp they come to the range for the final time. Gulyas is in the lead, and she is in and out in no time at all!\n\nFinally Clouvel gets a good visit to the range and she is going to be on her heels for the last 600m lap.\n\nGulyas, arms outstretched, celebrates as she comes home for gold! Clouvel celebrates too as she wins silver on home soil, her second silver adding to Rio 2016! And Seong comes home for bronze!\n\nThe crowd go wild for Clouvel.\n\nThat is a new overall score world record for Gulyas! 1461 points, breaking Alice Sotero's 1443.\n\nDid you know Paris 2024 is hosting a Pride House?\n\nSo, everyone has heard about country and NOC \"houses\" in Paris by now, where fans get to learn about different cultures and celebrate each NOC's athletes.\n\nBut did you know that there is also a Pride House in Paris celebrating LGBTQ+ athletes?\n\nAthletes including Olympic medallists Gus Kenworthy (freestyle skiing), Guillaume Cizeron (figure skating), Kate Richardson-Walsh (hockey), Matt Mitcham (diving), and Charline van Snick (judo) have been sharing their experiences about being LGBTQ+ in sport at the Pride House.\n\nTake a look.ðŸ‘‡\n\nAthletics: Kinzang Lhamo completes the marathon!\n\nShe's done it!\n\nThere are incredible scenes here in the centre of Paris as Lhamo, the only female member of the Bhutan team and her nation's flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony, is roared over the finish line by the crowd.\n\nAt certain points she was reduced to a walk, but the 26-year-old never gave up, and she does complete the women's marathon in a time of of 3:52:59. A full hour-and-a-half after Hassan's win, but a new PB for Lhamo!\n\nWhat a moment in Olympic history we have just witnessed.\n\nWater polo: USA win men's bronze!\n\nThe USA keep their nerve in the penalty shootout, scoring with all three of their shots while goalkeeper Adrian Weinberg held strong to deny Vince Pal Vigvari. Hungary are desperately unlucky though - two of their penalty shots hit the post, but these are the fine margins that can mean the difference between an Olympic medal and finishing outside of the podium.\n\nThe USA celebrate wildly in the pool - they are the bronze medallists!\n\nAthletics: Kinzang Lhamo (BHU) still battling to complete the marathon!\n\nIn an amazing example of human perseverance and Olympic spirit, Lhamo - Bhutan's first ever Olympic marathon runner - is still running the women's race more than one hour after Hassan won gold and has just passed the 38km mark!\n\nShe continues to be cheered on by the remaining spectators who are willing her on to the finish line. She only has a few kilometres to go!\n\nAthletics: Sifan Hassan (NED) wins the women's marathon!\n\nWhat an incredible climax to this race!\n\nAs the finish line edges closer, that group of five dwindles to four, then to three, until Hassan and Assefa hit the afterburners and engage in a sprint battle to the end.\n\nAnd a battle it was, for as Hassan attempted to get around Assefa, the two athletes briefly make contact as they fight for position. But Hassan's kick is stronger, and the Dutchwoman pulls away in the last 100m or so to win gold in a new Olympic record time of 2:22:55!\n\nIt's Hassan's third Olympic medal of Paris 2024, the sixth Olympic medal of her career, and the first ever Olympic gold in the marathon for the Netherlands.\n\nAssefa is just three seconds behind to win silver, while bronze goes to Hellen Obiri, her third Olympic medal after winning two silvers at Rio 2016 on the track.\n\nðŸ¥‡Sifan Hassan (NED): 2:22:55 OR\n\nðŸ¥ˆTigst Assefa (ETH): 2:22:58\n\nðŸ¥‰Hellen Obiri (KEN): 2:23:10\n\nAthletics: Marathon runners prepare for sharp climb\n\nThe athletes are about to tackle the steepest hill of the marathon, and this is where a winner could step to the fore - just as Tamirat Tola (KEN) did yesterday in the men's race.\n\nJust before they start their climb the runners take on water and energy drinks - vitally important as the Parisian sun blazes down on them.\n\nWe even have some brave spectators who are running alongside them on the other side of the barriers!\n\nI wonder if they can keep pace..."
