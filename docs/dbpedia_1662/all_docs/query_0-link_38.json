Here area few highlights. The full interview can be found at http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20040103closeuplocal3p3.asp.\n\n\"It has been a very good year,\" Shabalov said yesterday from hishome. By December, newspapers were referring to him as the \"American Playerof the Year\" and he was featured in several international chess magazines.Shabalov said he won about $80,000 in prize money in 2003. With his gamein place, Shabalov plans to take a break in the spring and try to writeabout some of his experiences on the road. \"I want to write something entertainingabout modern tournament life, the life of a tournament player. I thinkI have a lot of funny stories. I got so many offers,\" Shabalov said.\n\nWho knows where it could lead? Could Alexander Shabalov build a reputationthat makes him a household name in chess, like Bobby Fischer did so manyyears ago? When Shabalov sits down at the computer to write, he is certainthat he won't be working on an autobiography -- not at age 36.\"It's a bitearly for that,\" he said. Shabalov, who has been playing chess since hewas 7, was trained according to the precepts of the Soviet School of Chess.He discovered the game by watching his father play with his friends inhis homeland. He became a professional chess player in 1988 and a Grandmasterin 1991. With the Soviet Union beginning to crumble, Shabalov and his wifeleft Riga, Latvia, in 1992 and settled in Pittsburgh, where his wife'ssister was already living. His wife, Olga, is a cardiologist at UPMC ShadysideHospital. They have two daughters, Anna, 15, and Kathy, 11.\n\n4) Games of IM William Martz\n\nDuane Catania recently donated a number of books and magazinesto the Mechanics' Institute. One of the items was a booklet produced bythe late IM Bill Martz (1945-1983) for a class he taught in hishometown of Milwaukee in 1976. The following three games are not givenin ChessBase Mega 2004.

Now he has his own websiteat http://www.chessninja.com .A recent article by Mig at this site featured former MI Chess DirectorJim Eade, author of the best-selling Chess for Dummies.\n\nSpeaking of Books. Through insider sources I've been keepingtabs on the best-selling chess books at one of America's largest onlineand offline booksellers. (No, not just checking their popularity rankingsonline, which vary dramatically due to complex and rigged formulas.) \"Chessfor Dummies\" outsells the rest, with the classic \"Bobby Fischer TeachesChess\" close behind. Both of these outsold the new Kasparov \"MyGreat Predecessors\" book if you take the average of its first few monthsof availability. Of course the massive \"Predecessors\" hardback costs twoto four times as much as the others. There has been a great deal of conjectureover which chess book is the best selling of all time, with most plumpingfor \"Fischer Teaches...\" That would certainly seem to be fair claim basedon how well it still sells. Chess historian Edward Winter has discussedthe various claims in his Chess Notes column (ChessCafe.com) and compilations.The top chess books far outsell the top bridge books. On the other hand,the top-selling nonfiction book, \"The South Beach Diet,\" sells 250 timesthe top chess book, \"Dummies.\" The good news is that the Dummies book,by Jim Eade, is an excellent primer. Even better is GM Patrick Wolff'sbook\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess\". Put decorative paper dust-jacketson them if you're embarrassed to read them on the bus.\n\nFM Eric Schiller writes:\n\nHead over to www.chessbrain.net.Sign up the club, download the software, turn on the machines Friday morning,January 30th, and the club will earn part of a Guinness Record for Manvs. Machines event. All the information is up at their site. I'm workingwith them on the event. No cost, just a fun event which should get somedecent media coverage. Members can participate from their home/office/school,too. Each participant gets a certificate as part of the official Guinnessrecord. The game will be between GM Peter Nielsen and the Chessbraindistributed computing project. We expect over 1000 computers from aroundthe world to gang up on the GM.\n\nSteinitz mistranslated? A recent exchange in GM AlexanderBaburin's Chess Toda (http://www.chesstoday.net)suggests that a well-known axiom attributed to Steinitz might bemisunderstood.\n\n\"Mr. Barsky misquoted Steinitz, who said only that failing toattack in a superior position would lose the advantage - not transfer itto the opponent writes IM\n\nAnthony Saidy.\n\nTo which GM Baburin replies: I agree. More interesting, however, isthe (relatively) recent dispute between Mark Dvoretsky and GMIosif Dorfman on whether the stronger side has to attack in the superiorposition and whether this is what Steinitz claimed. As I understand, Dorfmanbelieves that Steinitz was misquoted when translated to Russian and Englishand that he never declared this necessity to attack – a good squeeze woulddo just fine!\n\nCongratulations to MI Member Hugo Kitano for his third placefinish in the K-3 National Championships last December in Chicago.\n\nIM Jay Whitehead of Berkeley is offering chess lessons. Contacthim at [email protected] or (510) 204-9278 .\n\nNewsletter #175, 01/21/2004\n\n\"In American opens you have the first three, four prizes and therest is peanuts. You have to play very aggressively.\"\n\nAlex Shabalov\n\n1) Bill Goichberg named USCF Executive Director\n\nBill Goichberg, who has been involved in United States ChessFederation affairs for over forty years, was recently named ExecutiveDirector of the organization.\n\nBest known as the founder of the Continental Chess Association whichruns tournaments from coast to coast, Goichberg brings a wide variety ofchess experience to the job. Back in the 1960s he worked in the USCF officeunder the late Ed Edmondson, serving as Ratings Director. Soon afterthis he founded the CCA and started organizing some of the first scholastictournaments in the United States. A strong master he served as Captainof the gold-medal winning US Olympiad team in Haifa, Israel, in 1976. Goichbergfounded and ran the successful National Chess League in the late 1970sand has been instrumental in supporting both the Professional Chess PlayersHealth and Benefit Program and the yearly Grand Prix. Each year he faithfullyattends USCF annual meetings and serves on many committees. It's hard tothink of anyone in US chess who had more involvement in such a wide varietyof chess activities in the United States.\n\nNay sayers will point to the apparent conflict of interest in havingthe largest tournament organizer in the country running the day to dayoperations of the USCF ignoring that Goichberg has not bid on a USCF nationalevent since the US Open in 1997. The fact that he is taking this positionwithout pay speaks volumes about his motivations. We wish him well in hisefforts to turn things around in New Windsor.\n\n2) Andranik Matikozian and Haluk Akol win at Western Class Championship\n\nAgoura Hills in Southern California was the scene of the firstmajor tournament of the year on the West Coast and IM Andranik Matikozianof Glendale was the surprise winner finishing ahead of several GMs. Matikozian,former Armenian junior champion, had a strange first half of the tournament.Playing in a short schedule he found himself in such a small section thathe was forced to play the same player, Tatev Abrahamiyan, twice! Four players in a four player group gave organizer Bill Goichberg no choice.Merging into the main schedule with a 4-0 score Matikozian escaped fromdifficult positions against GMs Jaan Ehlvest and Alex Yermolinskyto enter the last round with 5 1/2 points. He then drew with GM DashevegSharavdorj to take first at 6-1. Sharavdorj, who had an excellent event,was second at 5 1/2 followed by MI Grandmaster-in-Residence Alex Yermolinsky(undefeated) and GM-elect Varuzhan Akobian.\n\nThe big news for MI members was the sensational result of Tuesday NightMarathon regular Haluk Akol. Mr. Akol, who is 80, showed severalyoung whippersnappers their place, tying for first in his section. Well-doneHaluk!\n\n3) Ricardo DeGuzman tops at Bob Burger Open\n\nRicardo DeGuzman continued his domination of the MI's monthlyG/45 tournaments winning the Bob Burger Open on January 17 witha score of 5-0. Among his victories was a last round win over fellow IMJay Whitehead who was making a welcome return to the arena after abreak of many years. NM Batsaikhan Tserendorj was second at 4.5followed by George Sanguinetti, Clarence Lehmann and ErinHarrington at 4. Anthony Corrales directed the 56 player eventfor the Mechanics'.\n\n4) Children's Wednesday Afternoon Class Returns\n\nThe popular Children's Wednesday Afternoon Class, which temporarilystopped when corporate sponsorship dried up, has been jump-started thanksto generous donations by Dee Karnad and Haluk Akol.The Class, which runs each Wednesday from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM and is taughtby MI Scholastic Chess Director Anthony Corrales, is free to allchildren. If you like the idea of this sort of program consider offeringsupport. Donations to the Mechanics' are tax deductible due to the M.I.'s501(c) (3) nonprofit status.\n\n5) Four-way tie in Winter Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nIM Walter Shipman and NMs Igor Margulis, Egle Morkunaiteand Andy Lee are the only perfect scores left after three roundsof the MI Tuesday Night Marathon. Five rounds remain to be played in the80-player tournament. It is still possible to enter with half point byesfor the first three rounds.\n\n6) Here and There\n\nThe Berkeley Chess Club has moved back to its old location atthe beautiful Berkeley City Club at 2315 Durant Avenue. The location isonly a block from the UC Berkeley campus and is a 5 minute walk from thedowntown Berkeley BART station. The club, which meets Fridays, offers weeklyUSCF rated play.

I should like to suggest that the inclusionof a few chess books would help to make the distinction unmistakable.\"\n\nEdward Lasker, 'The Adventure of Chess', 1949\n\n1) Shipman leads Winter Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nInternational Master Walter Shipman jumped into the lead in theWinter Tuesday Night Marathon by defeating National Master Andy Leein a tense game. Shipman leads the 80-player field with 4 points with FMFrankThornally, NMs Igor Margulis and Egle Morkunaite andExpert Igor Traub tied for second at 3 1/2.

Yes, the exact sameamount as the regular yearly dues! Thousands paid their $100 over ten yearsand the USCF has been servicing these memberships for decades.\n\nNewsletter #177, 02/04/2004\n\n\"Strategy requires thought, tactics require observation.\"\n\nMax Euwe\n\nThe 4th Annual Henry Gross Memorial (5 rounds, G/45) will beheld this Saturday at the MI starting at 10 am.\n\n1) Thornally and Shipman lead Winter Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nTop seeds FM Frank Thornally and IM Walter Shipman sharethe lead at 4.5 from 5 and will face off in round six of the Mechanics'Institute's Winter Tuesday Night Marathon.

Last week in the Newsletter it was reported that TeresaHaun won the Western Region Women's Chess Championship in Menlo Parkthe weekend of January 24-25. In fact it was 15-year-old JamieBrett. Jamie is ranked #80 among all women in the United States at1729 and we expect it won't be long before she finds herself a Class Aplayer.\n\n3) Bonin-Shabalov - 2003 Marshall Chess Club Championship\n\n2003 will go down in American Chess as the Year of Alex Shabalov.The Pittsburgh base GM won the US Championship as well as practically everyother significant event held in the country. One of the few titles to escapehis grasp was that of Marshall Chess Club Champion. This rare slip forShaba can be partly attributed to the following loss to the indomitableJayBonin. The veteran New York IM is well-known for his love of the gameand annually ranks among the most active players in the nation.\n\nIn the following game Jay tries an interesting novelty in the Semi-Slavvariation of the Queen's Gambit in which he sacrifices a pawn for pressure.Does he more than enough compensation for the pawn? Did Shaba over estimatehis chances? I'm not certain what the answer is in this fascinating game.\n\nNOTE - Just before sending out this Newsletter I went out to themailbox and found the Winter 2004 issue of Chess Life waiting for me. InsideI found that GM Michael Rohde had beat me to the punch and already annotatedthe game! I encourage you to check out his excellent annotations on page37 . I have added a few of his comments to my annotations in critical positions.withattribution in bold and a larger font size.\n\nBonin,J - Shabalov,A [D46]\n\nMarshall Club Championship 2003\n\n1.d4 Nf6\n\nIt's interesting that Shaba uses 1...Nf6 as a way to reach the Slav.One reason might be that he wants White to commit a Knight to c3 or f3in the event of an Exchange Slav - 1...d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5 4.Bf4 (4.Nc3e5!?) 4...Nc6 5.e3 Nf6 6.Bd3 e6 7.Nc3 circumventing Botvinnik's old favorite1...d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bf4 e6 7.e3 Nh5 . Anotherpossibility - and more likely - is he wants to avoid something like 1.d4d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4 or 3.Bg5.\n\n2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 e6 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Qc2\n\nAs we will soon see the game continuation could also arise from Zvaginsev'sline of the Meran: 6.Bd3 dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 8.Bd3 Bb7 9.0-0 Bd6 10.Qc2. Inthis line White would not necessarily choose to play Qc2, but if Jay'snovelty proves to be of long-term worth he will have killed two birds withone stone.\n\n6...Bd6 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 dxc4 9.Bxc4 b5 10.Bd3\n\nThe text is well-known but 10.Be2 is more popular here.\n\n10...Bb7 11.e4 e5 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3\n\nWhite would like to grab space and get the Kingside pawns rolling butthe text is necessary preparation. In Tuzan-Mukhametov, Moscow 1990, Blackgot excellent play after 14.f4 with 14...Bd4+ 15.Kh1 Ng4 16.g3 Qc7 17.Nd1f5 18.h3 Nf6 19.e5 c5+ 20.Kh2 Nd5 21.Qd2 c4 22.Bb1 Rad8.\n\n14...b4\n\nThe theoretical move that has been responsible for putting 10.Bd3 outof favor. Earlier continuations did not fare so well and ilustrate Bonin'sgreat experience in this variation:\n\n(A) 14...Qe7 15.Be3 Rfe8 16.Rae1 a6 17.Ne2 Bd6 (17...c5! 18.Bxc5 Qc719.Bd4 ½-½ Portisch-Tukmakov, Reggio Emilia 1987 wascorrect) 18.Nd4 g6 19.Nb3 Nd7 20.Na5 Ne5 21.Nxb7 Qxb7 22.Be2 Rac8 23.f4Nd7 24.Bg4 Rc7 25.e5 Bb4 26.Rd1 Nf8 27.Bf3 Rcc8 28.Rc1 Re6 29.Bd5 and Whitewent on to victory in Bonin-Shabalov, New York 1992.\n\n(B) 14...Re8 15.Be3 Qe7 16.Ne2 Bc7 17.Rad1 Bb6 (why not 17...Nxe4 18.Bxe4Qxe4 19.Qxe4 Rxe4 20.Rd7 Rc8 ?) 18.Nd4 and White had a clear advantage, Bonin-Alexopolous, New York 1994.\n\n(C) Rohde suggest 14..Rc8! as Black's best meeting 15.Be3 with 15...c5!and 15.f4 with 15...Bd4+ 16.Kh1 c5! 17.e5 Ng4 18.Bxh7+ with a messy position.I'm not sure I totally agree with this. After 14...Rc8 (played by Portischagainst Z. Varga in the 1993 Hungarian Team Championship) 15.Be3 c5 (Portischplayed 15...b4 16.Na4 c5 and lost) I thing White came claim some advantagewith 16.Bxb5 and now:\n\n(C1) 16...Bxc3 17.Qxc3 Nxe4 18.Qc2;\n\n(C2) 16...Qa5 17.Bc4 Bxc3 18.Qxc3 Qxc3 19.bxc3 Nxe4 20.Rab1 Bc6 21.Rb3. In both cases White's Bishops should give him some pull.\n\n15.Na4\n\nHere 15.Ne2 c5 16.f3 c4! (16...Rc8 17.Bc4) 17.Qxc4 Qb6+ 18.Kh1 Rfd8is Illescas's great idea which gives Black good play.\n\n15...Bd4\n\nBlack intends ...c5, ...Qe7 and ...Rfe8 with strong counterplay.\n\n16.Be3!?\n\nThis is Jay's very interesting new idea in which he cripples his pawnstructure in return for activity. Odds are strong that he will lose thefront e-pawn but compensation will come in the form of more active pieces.Previously seen was 16.Rd1 Qe7 17.Bf4 c5 18.e5 Nh5 19.Bh2 f5 20.Be2 Qg521.Bf3 Bxf3 22.Qb3+ Kh8 23.Qxf3 f4 ½-½ Gutman-Goloshchapov, Alushta 1999. Note that 16.e5?! fails to 16...Bxe5 17.Nc5 Bc8 and Black'sposition is superior to the game continuation as he has no weakness one6.\n\n16...Bxe3 17.fxe3 Nd7 18.e5 h6 19.e6\n\nAnother possibility was 19.Rad1 Qe7 20.Bh7+ Kh8 21.Bf5 Nxe5 22.Nc5,but I prefer Jay's choice.\n\n19...fxe6 20.Bc4 Qe7 21.Qg6 Rf6 22.Rxf6 Nxf6 23.Rc1 Rd8\n\nThis certainly looks natural. An alternative was 23...Kh8 trying tokeep White's Knight from coming to c5. Rohde then suggests 24.Rf1! intendingto play Bc4-d3.\n\n24.Nc5 Bc8 25.Nd3 Rf8 26.Nf4 Bd7\n\nWhite definitely has compensation for the pawn, but probably no more.One could easily imagine Shaba playing White in such a position!\n\n27.Qd3 Rf7 28.Ng6 Qc5 29.Qd4 Qg5\n\nNo doubt Shaba was playing for a win here, but I wonder if the textoverreaches. Maybe it was time to consider trying to bail out with 29...Qxd430.exd4 Nd5 31.Bxd5 exd5 32.Ne5 Re7 33.Nxd7 Rxd7 34.Rxc6 Re7. GM Rohdegives 29...Qxd4 30.exd4 Nd5 31.Ne4 as the way for White to play. He continues31...Re7 32.Bb3 Be8 and White can keep improving with Rc1-c5, Bb3-a4, Kg1-f2,etc. while Black watches.\n\n30.Ne5 Re7 31.h4 Qg3 32.Rf1\n\nWhite could reach an attractive ending after 32.Qf4 Qxf4 33.exf4 butJay, sensing blood, correctly keeps the Queens on.\n\n32...Nd5 33.Rf3 Qe1+ 34.Kh2 Be8 35.Rg3 h5\n\nIt's difficult to suggest an improvement here. Trying to anticipateQd4-c5-d6 with 35...Rb7 runs into 36.Nd3 Qd2 37.e4.\n\n36.Qc5 Rb7 37.Qd6 Nf6 38.Bxe6+ Kh7 39.Bf5+ Kg8 40.Nd3 1-0\n\n4) US Women's Olympic Team Challenge\n\nPresident's Day Weekend is known in the Bay Area as time for the PeoplesOpen and elsewhere in the country for the regional Amateur Team Championshipsbut the Heartland will have also a major event this year.

The cause was lung cancer. Palos, who sufferedfrom diabetes for many years, had been in poor health for some time. Heleaves behind his sons Robert and Davor.\n\nOsman Palos was born October 29, 1949, in Gracanica, Yugoslavia.He legally changed his name to Osmand after becoming a U.S. citizenin 2002.\n\nOsmand was the strongest player in Tuzla, the second largest city inBosnia, for many years until he left in the late 1980s. His best yearsas a chess player were in the mid-1980s. During this time he received theIM title in 1985 and achieved his peak FIDE rating of 2440 in 1987. Hisbest ever result was winning the Pula Open in 1986 with a GM norm performancescore of 10 from 11. Two other good results were 8.5 from 13 in a Category4 (2328) round robin in Tuzla in 1991 and =2nd with GM Ikonnikovbehind GM Klinger at the 138 player Werfen Open in 1992. Palos wasa regular participant in Yugoslav Team Championships in the 1980s , winningthe gold medal on board 5 in 1982 with a score of 6 from 9.\n\nOsmand played often in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in the late1980s and early 1990s, collecting many GM scalps including those of Ikonnikov,Kudrin,Vukic, Kupreichik and Khenkin among others. Palos was a bigfighter when healthy and not one to respect reputations. To get an ideaof his persistence play over his 107 move draw with GM Eingorn fromGraz 1987.\n\nPalos loved to play blitz and could often be found between rounds indulgingin his favorite pastime. He was an inconsistent but dangerous opponentwho could pose a danger to anyone. One example: his 2-0 score versus GMKrasenkovin the 1997 New York City Blitz Championship.\n\nMuch of his life Osman worked as a businessman, only becoming a full-timechess professional when things started to deteriorate in Yugoslavia. Oneof his last important duties in his old town was directing the Women'sInterzonal in Tuzla in 1987. Fleeing the Balkans he spent several yearsplaying in Western Europe before talking a position as a chess trainerin the United Arab Emirates in 1993.\n\nPalos first arrived in Chicago in late 1996, quickly establishing himselfnot only as one of the top players in the city but also one of the bestchess coaches. Neil Gleason of Madison, Wisconsin, remembers: \"Inearly 1999, I spent an evening arguing politics with him. The nextmorning, he gave me a 10 minute lesson in the exchange Caro Kann (\"playsimple chess\") over breakfast, whereupon I proceeded to use it with whiteto notch 2 convincing victories that same day in a quick tournament. He was a skillful instructor who would readily demonstrate that chess isa very simple game.\"\n\nPalos was already in poor health by the time he arrived in the UnitedStates but he still managed to hold a USCF rating over 2400 until the lastfew years of his life, peaking at 2477. He was especially proud of histwo wins over GM Goldin, one of the best players in the US. Hislast major event was the Lindsborg Rotary Open in December of 2002 wherehe scored a respectable fifty percent against a field averaging 2442 FIDE.\n\nOsman Palos will be remembered as a warm, modest and intelligent manwho gave his life to chess.\n\nUnfortunately only 329 of Osmand's games are available in Mega 2004,representing probably less than 10 percent of those he played during hiscareer.

You probably didn't know, but he has special meaning to mebecause of one game we played in the summer of 2000 at the old ChicagoChess Club. I was visiting my dad in the Windy City, and on the spur ofthe moment, decided to play in a one-day G/90 tournament. As luck wouldhave it, I was paired up on board 1 in the first round. Of course, my opponentwas an institution of Chicago area chess, although I didn't know it atthe time. I'm sure that Palos wanted to quickly forget our game (he blundereda piece), but I will never forget it. Not only was this my first victoryagainst an International Master, but it was also the game that took meover 2200 USCF. I won the other two games in that tournament, withPalos watching me like a hawk. In the end, I took the first place prizethat he probably had hoped to win, but he was gracious in congratulatingme.\"\n\nA photo of Osmand, taken by Tony Boren, can be found at http://www.kevinspraggett.com/osmanpalos.jpg.\n\n5) Bay Area Chess History\n\nPeter Dahl did a booklet on the life and games of Henry Grossalmost fifteen years ago Now he has a second edition, with many analyticalimprovements, available on CD for the bargain price of $1 (to cover thecost of the CD, packaging and postage).

The winner willget one hundred thousand dollars. Regarding the problem with the Israeliplayers: Ilyumzhinov asked Khaddafi to allow them to visit the countryand hopes for a positive answer. There is also an idea originating fromKhaddafi's son - that of dividing the Championship into two groups. Oneof the groups will play in Malta, and Libya will pay foreverything.\n\nOne final interesting point from the interview - FIDE will send contractsto all 128 World Championship participants. Included in the contract isa clause making it obligatory for KO Championship winner to participatein the match against Garry Kasparov. Ilyumzhinov is sure that Anandwill play in Libya.\n\nThe official FIDE site has published an interesting statistic:The top chess countries by average rating of their 10 top players:\n\n1.

About half the article was devoted to observations by Dennis Waterman, one of the best Bay Area players in the mid-1970s, with a USCF rating over 2400.\n\nRubenstein wrote: \"Waterman, who is also a World ranked chess player, says he does not play poker on Saturday night with the boys, a six-pack and a bowl of barbecue potato chips. \"Poker is a job,\" he said. \"You don't do your job for fun. This is work.\"\n\nMany strong Bay Area chess players like to play poker, and some quite well. Six-time US Champion Walter Browne is a house player for the Oaks Club n Emeryville while IM Elliott Winslow supports himself these days playing poker on the Internet. FM Ralph Dubisch of Sunnyvale played professionally for many years.\n\nWhile a certain type of chess player can be a good poker player, you never see the reverse, which can probably be explained by the differences in psychology of the games. Many chess players only play chess, lacking any sort of gambling/gaming interest. Conversely poker players are not likely to be attracted to a game like chess where the gambling element is limited.\"\n\n3) Here and There\n\nThe first Berkeley Chess Club Friday Night Marathon got off to a very respectable start last week, attracting a field of 34 players to the Berkeley City Club near the UC campus.

Certainly the campus of the University of Baltimore at Maryland County, with GMs Alex Onischuk and Pavel Blehm and IMs Eugene Perelshteyn and Pascal Charbonneau not to mention nearby residents GMs Jaan Ehlvest, Alex Wojtkiewicz and Alex Sherzer, is a pretty impressive concentration of strength. Removing special cases like this and the University of Texas at Dallas, where scholarships have brought in the talent, the winner might be Berkeley. Certainly New York City has many more strong players, but one GM (Walter Browne) and four IMs (Jay Whitehead, John Grefe, Vinay Bhat and John Donaldson) is not bad for a city of 110,000.\n\n4) Bobby Fischer Goes To War\n\nThe authors of Bobby Fischer Goes To War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time, David Edmonds & John Eidinow, will be giving a talk at the Mechanic's Institute, on Friday, April 2, at 12:30 PM.

Go to\n\nhttp://www.burlingamechessclub.com/bccPAIR/2004tmts/deguzman/deguzman_simul.htm for more information.\n\nGM Alex Baburin in the excellent online daily Chess Today (http://www.chesstoday.net) recently shared some information about some strange incidents involving Kasparov at Linares.\n\nDmitry Komarov in the Ukrainian newspaper Facty told a story about a little known aspect of the recent Linares tournament. Below is our translation of\n\nhis text (in Russian):\n\n\"A real detective story happened in the last rounds of the Super tournament in Linares. According to Silvio Danailov, manager of RuslanPonomariov, when playing against Vallejo, Kasparov before making his move suddenly stood up and left the playing hall. He did the same the day before when he played against Topalov. In accordance with the rules such behavior is strictly prohibited because of the possible computer assistance and is punished with a defeat. The arbiters noticed Kasparov's strange maneuver and asked the girl who was working in the press center to follow him. Garry went to his hotel room and stayed there for about fifteen minutes. Coming back he explained to the arbiters that he had had to take some medicine urgently. The arbiters gave Kasparov just a warning, while at the last European Team Championship Ponomariov lost a full point for a lesser offense – an accidental mobile phone call.\"\n\nIt's not at all clear that Kasparov was cheating, but can you imagine what his reaction would be if one of his opponents left the board for an extended period of time without consulting an arbiter? Though unquestionably one of the greatest, if not the greatest player of all time, Kasparov is not likely to be remembered as having great board manners. One only has to recall his actively utilized repertoire of facial grimaces and the incident with Judit Polgar where he violated the touch move rule. - J.D.\n\nNewsletter #184, 03/24/2004\n\n\"I like to coax my opponents into attacking, to let them taste the joy of the initiative, so that they may get carried away, become careless, and sacrifice material\"\n\nViktor Kortchnoi\n\nThe next issue of the Newsletter will include coverage of the recently concluded Northern California Scholastic Championships and a review of the new book on Pal Benko by Benko, Jeremy Silman and John Watson.

The event is free for members and $5 for the public. Go to http://www.milibrary.org/events.html for more information.\n\nDavid Edmonds will be appearing at Kepler's books in Menlo Park (1010 El Camino Real on Friday night at 7pm : 650.324.4321) while John Eidinow will be at Cody's in Berkeley (2454 Telegraph Avenue at Haste: 510-845-7852) at 7:30pm the same evening.\n\n4) Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nUpsets continue in the Spring Tuesday Night Marathon. 1800-rated Harry Plotkin defeated his second Master in a row, downing Igor Margulis. Joining Plotkin with 3-0 scores are Larry Snyder, Steven Krasnov and Victor Todortsev. The seventy player event has six rounds to go.\n\n5) Here and There\n\nPal Benko: My Life, Games and Compositions by Pal Benko and Jeremy Silman is receiving some excellent reviews including one at ChessCafe that called it one of the best game collections of all time. Benko was one of the top American players for close to two decades. He is not the only chessplayer in the family. Go to http://www.math.tamu.edu/~benko/chess.htm and you will find the website of his son David, who is an Expert strength player and a member of the Math department at Texas A&M. He has a great picture of his father playing Tal at Curacao on the site.\n\nLooking for a chess camp and live near Wisconsin?

I know of at least four individuals that will be running. They include the Bay Area's own Elizabeth Shaughnessy who divides her time between the Berkeley Chess School and serving as President of the Northern California Chess Federation, National Master Randy Bauer of Iowa who is an accountant and Mikhail Korenman of Kansas who organized the Lindsborg Chess Festivals and Karpov Chess School and is in charge of the College Final Four this weekend where the University of Maryland at Baltimore County and UTD will be renewing their rivalry. The fourth Candidate is chess gadfly Sam Sloan who is rapidly becoming the Harold Stassen of USCF politics.\n\nNewsletter #186, 04/05/2004\n\n\"Games are usually lost, not through the taking of chances, but through the failure to apprehend certainties.\"\n\nGerald Abrahams\n\nThis shortened edition of the MI Newsletter is coming out early due to the Foxwoods Open. The regular Wednesday schedule will return on April 14.\n\n1) Nakamura and Ibragimov tie in 5th Millennium Open\n\nGMs Hikaru Nakamura and Ildar Ibragimov tied for first in the 5th Millennium Open held April 2-4 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The two winners, who scored 4.5 from 5, each received $1850. Tying for third through seventh at 4-1 in the 67 player open section were GMs Alex Wojtkiewicz and John Fedorowicz, IM John Donaldson and NMs Alex Stamnov and Boris Zisman. Among those on 3 1/2 were GMs Jaan Ehlvest and Julio Becerra This years edition of the Millennium Open, organized by Tom Braunlich and directed by Ernie Schlich and Michael Atkins, attracted 270 players and maintained its reputation as one of the best run tournaments in the United States.\n\nDonaldson - Reichstein English A34\n\n5th Millennium Open (2) 2004\n\n1.Nf3 c5 2.c4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6 4.g3 Nc6 5.Bg2 d5 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.0–0 Nxc3 8.bxc3 e5?! 9.d3 Be7 10.Nd2 0–0 11.Rb1 Be6 12.Qa4 Qc7 13.Nc4 Bd7 14.Ne3 Qc8 15.Nd5 Bd6 16.Qh4 Qd8?\n\nBlack had to play 16...f6 or 16...Re8.

This 87-page book contains biographical data on Dr. Vukcevich, articles written by and about him, 232 lightly annotated games (with diagrams), and a small selection of his problems. Since only 10 copies were printed, this book is not available to the general public.\n\nHowever, IM Donaldson has authorized the distrubution of his book on CD. This CD contains: (1) a printable Word document containing all 87 scanned pages (in *.jpg file format); (2) games database files (ChessBaseLight required; download it for free at: www.chessbase.com); and (3) a Word document containing all 232 games (without diagrams). For a copy of this CD, send $5(US) to: Dan Meinking / P.O. Box 389183 / Cincinnati, OH 45238-9183 (USA). All proceeds go to the Vukcevich Super Cup tournament (for students) in Cleveland (May 22, 2004); www.vivacityinc.com for more details.

What I learned in an hour then now takes me a week of study.\"\n\nAlex Shabalov - during a recent talk at the Mechanics' Institute Chess Club\n\n1) Northern Californians dominate Far West Open\n\nMI Newsletter reader NM Michael Aigner, who is profiled in the most recent issue of Chess Life, reports on last weekends Far West Open.\n\n\"The 4th Far West Open was held over Easter weekend in Reno, Nevada. Intended to be a sister tournament of the annual Western States Open in October, this tournament was also hosted by the Sands Regency Hotel & Casino. 198 people came to Reno to gamble at the chess board, which ensures that this event will happen again next year! The kudos for organizing a fine tournament once again go out to Jerry Weikel and his family.\n\nThe Open section was headed by GMs Alex Yermolinsky, Gregory Serper, Sergey Kudrin, and Walter Browne, plus GM-elect Melikset Khachiyan and a number of strong IMs. Each of these GMs ended up tied for first at 4.5 out of 6. They were joined by two local masters: Vladimir Mezentsev and Tigran Ishkhanov. After an entertaining blitz playoff that ended early on Monday morning, GM Serper emerged with the trophy.\n\nOther local players joined Yermolinsky, Browne, Mezentsev, and Ishkhanov at the cashier's cage. They included Ricardo DeGuzman and Dmitry Zilberstein, who each scored 4.0 in the Open section. Tied for second under 2300 at 3.5 were Victor Ossipov and Michael Aigner. Also at 3.5 but sharing the top expert prize was Alexander Setzepfandt. Many of the prize winners in the class sections were also from Northern California, including A section champion Yefim Bukh.\n\nI expect that complete standings will be posted later this week at http://www.renochess.org/fwo/index.html\n\nMichael Aigner\n\n2) Ildar Ibragimov wins Foxwoods Open on tiebreak\n\nGrandmaster Ildar Ibragimov, formally of Kazan, Russia, and now representing the United States, was the winner of the 2004 Foxwoods Open on tiebreak. Ibragimov, whose 7-2 score was matched by fellow GMs Julio Becerra, Jan Ehlvest and, I believe, Giorgi Kacheishvili (the CCI report on Foxwoods is down as I write). Ibragimov was a deserving winner as he played the top seeds facing by far the strongest opposition, but even he needed a little luck in round 3 as Berkeley's David Pruess had him completely beat with an extra piece and a big time advantage to boot, before letting things get out of hand. It would have been a fantastic double-header for Pruess had he converted because in the previous round he beat GM Yury Shulman. Another Bay Area player, Alan Stein, was in the running for an IM norm right up until the end. I'm not sure whether he made it or not. I will have a full report on Foxwoods next week.\n\n3) Walter Shipman tops Lovegrove Senior Open\n\nInternational Master Walter Shipman won the 4th Annual Walter Lovegrove Memorial Senior Championship held at the Mechanics' on April 3rd-4th. Shipman, who came into the event as the second seed, defeated National Master Victor Ossipov in the penultimate round and then drew with Expert Larry Snyder to score 3.5 from 4 to take home the $200 first prize. Tying for second at 3 - 1 were Ossipov, Snyder, Oleg Shakhnazarov and Peter McKone. The latter, rated 1770, defeated top-rated NM Igor Margulis in the last round. MI Grandmaster-in-Residence Alex Yermolinsky directed the 20-player event.\n\n4) Larry Snyder leads Spring Tuesday Night Marathon\n\nLarry Snyder defeated Victor Todortsev in round 5 to merge as the only perfect score left in the nine round event. A point behind the Berkeley Expert are FM Frank Thornally, NMs Russell Wong and Nicolas Yap, and Experts Alex Setzepfandt and Peter Grey.\n\nSnyder, a retired anesthesiologist who teaches chess in the Berkeley Chess School program, is threatening to regain the Master's title he held briefly in 1997. Currently ranked 2085, he has a good number of points coming to him from strong performances in the last TNM, the Lovegrove, and an event in Southern California.\n\n5) Banawa and Andrianov tops in Burbank\n\nSouthern California newcomer Jouaquin Banawa of the Philippines and IM Nikolay Andrianov of Phoenix shared first place with 4.5 out of 5 in the 2nd Western Pacific Open held April 2-4 in Burbank. Tying for third in the 54-player top section, which featured one GM and 11 IMs, were Melikset Khachiyan, Andranik Matikozian, Enrico Sevillano and Kong Deng. Bay Area IM Ricardo DeGuzman won the blitz tournament with a perfect score. John Hillery organized and directed for the Southern California Chess Association.\n\n6) Weekly blitz returns to the MI\n\nWeekly blitz tournaments will be returning to the Mechanics' Institute every Wednesday evening starting April 21st. The events will be held starting at 7 PM immediately after GM Alex Yermolinsky's weekly lecture (starting time 5:15). Entry fee for the events is $5 with all money collected returned in prizes. The format for the events will be round robin or Swiss depending on entries. The tournaments will run approximately 1 1/2 hours.\n\n7) Internet Chess Cheating\n\nGM Alex Baburin's Internet chess daily, Chess Today, is getting better and better. Recently, it featured two interesting articles on the topics of Internet chess cheating and upcoming FIDE championship. It is definitely one of the best sources of chess content on the Internet. I concur with the sentiments offered below by Peter Tamburro:\n\n\"You guys ought to advertise in Chess Life similar to the way I describe on my website your site: If you look at Chess Today as a monthly chess magazine, you get 30 deeply annotated games by either an IM or GM, you get a database of hundreds of games, you get up to the minute chess news, great interviews, a whole bunch of chess problems and people with a sense of humor. Take 30 days of Chess Today, print them out, staple them and try to compare any monthly magazine in the world with that result. Chess Today wins every time! Pete Tamburro, USA\"\n\nThe following piece written by Martin Fischer, tournament director for www.playchess.com, is especially timely in view of what happened at the recent Dos Hermanas Internet Tournament where the two winners, rightly or wrongly, were both disqualified.\n\n\"Indeed, I believe, if we allow enginehelp, Internet-Chess would simply die very soon and we will have no more interesting Internet-Tournaments.\n\nIt is possible to see if a human played alone or with the help of an engine: In my opinion most players, especially grandmasters, overestimate their\n\nabilities in comparison to an engine, at least in Blitz-Chess (which is mostly played in the Internet). And, as a consequent follow up, they underestimate the chance to see if a human has played a tournament or an engine or a human with engine help. Let me explain my point of view: Almost any game of blitz-chess will be decided by tactics. If any player makes a tactical mistake in a game against an engine, he is lost. And even the strongest grandmasters are not able to play to play a higher number of blitzgames against equal, or almost equal, opponents without committing a tactical mistake (enough, to lose against an engine). If anyone does not believe me, he may have a look at several Big Databases and go over the blitz games with an engine. No one even reaches ten games in a row in a blitz tournament without serious tactical mistakes (if he/she plays worthy opponents). The reasons for these are quite simple: Chess is so rich that humans are not able to see anything relevant in a chess game in five minutes. They simply have to trust their intuition and have to take a chance (or they will overstep the time-limit). Sooner or later they take the wrong chance. In addition, humans get tired, engines do not. Humans are open to emotions, engines do not. Humans are vulnerable to psychological influences, engines do not. Therefore humans can't play like an engine during a tournament. They may do it in a single game, even two or three. However, after several games the 'fingerprint' of an engine can't be hid. Of course, the same applies to the human 'fingerprint'.\n\nIt is possible to detect the 'engine fingerprint' and to see who is cheating:On www.playchess.com we have developed software able to analyze\n\nany blitz game and look for the above mentioned 'engine-fingerprints'. The software uses games from GMs like Adams, Seirawan, Dr. Hübner, just to mention a few, and – of course – Fritz 8 and other engines - as the basicsample. The software is updated in short intervals. The software compares the game in questions with the data from the sample and realizes indicators for 'engine-play'. A 'fingerprint' is defined when the software sees several serious indicators for an engine (ab)use. As these fingerprints may be a coincidence you need, like in real-live forensic, more than one hint (in our case: game). Just to mention some numbers: The recent 2nd German Internet championship (with €2,600 in prizes) is a good example. Levon Aronian won that tournament. The software indicated an engine fingerprint in one of his games (21 games were played in total). As he recently won a very strong OTB blitz-tournament in Reykjavik ahead of Kasparov, Short and Karpov, he is for sure one of the strongest blitz-players around and need no engine help to win the German Championship. The same number of 'engine-fingerprints' we had in the games of Dr. Hübner, who played in our office in Hamburg. On the other hand: We disqualified a player, who later on confessed that he was using an engine for advice, as we found 12 'engine-fingerprints' in 21 games of his. So, we have a clear difference between players who played honestly and a player who cheated. Of course, for blitz-games only. In addition, before we will take any action against any player we will crosscheck the games with experts and only when we have surpassed the level 'beyond any reasonable doubt' a player will be disqualified and banned from the server.\n\nFinal remarks: Internet Chess Tournaments are possible and interesting. An efficient cheating control is possible, if the tournament is a blitz-tournament and has an endurance-factor (higher number of games). If using an engine is prohibited and money is at stake the (ab)use of an engine is not a peccadillo or some kind of a joke, it is simply a criminal act. Any player, who is thinking about engine help, may keep these in his/her mind.\"\n\nMartin Fischer, Tournament director\n\nwww.playchess.com\"\n\nFor more information on Chess Today, please refer to http://www.chesstoday.net\n\n8) FIDE World Championship\n\nThe following extract, from the new player's association headed by French GM Joel Lautier, was recently published in Chess Today and illustrates how FIDE continues to act in a very unsa"
