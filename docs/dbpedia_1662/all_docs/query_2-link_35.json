        "text": "On May 26, 1956, Althea Gibson became the first black player to win a major singles title when she defeated Angela Mortimer of Britain in the women’s singles final of the French Championships. Gibson’s win was her first in her fifth meeting with Mortimer and as the Associated Press reported that day, “Miss Gibson was so happy at beating Miss Mortimer for the first time that she leaped over the net to put her arms around her erstwhile jinx.”\n\nIt was a memorable time in Paris for Gibson, as she describes in this short excerpt from her newly republished autobiography “I Always Wanted To Be Somebody” (for sale and download here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937559971/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_6K9RRQYSN380EYNJ454A)\n\nAs far as Paris itself was concerned, the main feeling I have about it is that if you don’t know anybody there, it’s just like living alone. I enjoyed being there because I’d read so much about it for so many years, about how exotic it was and how beautiful. And also because when I was in England in 1951, and Sugar Ray was touring Europe and I met him and his boys in London, all they talked about was how wonderful Paris was. They raved about it. I remembered that they had said they stayed in a hotel on the Champs-Elysees, so when I got to Paris, and was put up at the Hotel Miami just off the Etoile, I headed for the Champs-Elysees right away. I couldn’t wait to see it.\n\nIt didn’t strike me as such a big deal, although there is something colorful about it with the interesting shops on the avenue, the little restaurants, the night clubs and the theaters. Actually, it reminded me of 42nd Street, except that the Champs-Elysees is wider.\n\nThe most excitement I had in Paris was right on the tennis court in Roland Garros Stadium. I was playing my friend Angela Buxton in the semifinals, and all of a sudden one of the straps on my brassiere broke. Angela came over to help me, but there wasn’t much we could do about it out there in front of all those people, so I rushed off to the dressing room to repair the damage. When I got back on the court, I found myself involved in a federal case. They were having a big meeting at the umpire’s chair and they told me that I’d had no right to leave the court like that without permission, and that if Angela requested it, they would default me right then and there. Angela protested that that was the last thing she wanted, so all the little men went away at last and we finished the match. I won it and went into the finals against England’s other Angela, my jinx opponent, Angela Mortimer.\n\nThe final-round match was largely uneventful except for one time when I lost my temper for a second. This is what the London Sunday Express said about the match, which I won 6-3, 11-9.\n\n“As always, Angela Mortimer began nervously, groping for a length, forced into wide errors by the heavy pressure, and serving double faults. She made a real fight of the fourth game but lost it after seven deuces and four advantage points. In the remaining five games of the set, she won only seven points against the American’s twenty.\n\n“Though the American, at 10-9 in the second set, nervously lost her service and angrily slammed a ball far into the crowd after a double fault, she made no mistake the next time and fittingly finished a love game with an unanswerable ace down the center line.”\n\nI had become the first Negro ever to win the championship of France; in fact, the first Negro ever to win any of the world’s major singles tennis championships. That night Angela Buxton’s father took Angela and me out to dinner, to celebrate. I was back at my hotel, and in bed, a little after ten.\n\nOriginally published in 1960, “I Always Wanted To Be Somebody” had fallen out of circulation and was only available for exorbitant prices by book resellers. However, New Chapter Press, a leading publisher of tennis books, worked with the Althea Gibson family, estate and the newly formed Althea Gibson Community Tennis Association to republish the book and make it available for the masses at a reasonable $19.95 price ($9.95 via Amazon Kindle) A portion of sales for the book will benefit the Althea Gibson Community Tennis Association.\n\n“I Always Wanted To Be Somebody” is the intimate and candid story of a girl who grew up in the asphalt environs of Harlem, skipping school, drinking hard liquor, stealing and fist-fighting, but went on to break the color barrier in tennis and achieving the pinnacle of the sport by winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships and becoming an inspiration for many future champions.\n\nHall of Fame tennis legend and pioneer Billie Jean King, who said she used to sleep with “I Always Wanted To Be Somebody” under her pillow as a girl, contributed the foreword to the new edition, writing, “Althea was our Jackie Robinson of tennis, and the barriers show broke down and the doors she opened have paved the way for generations of tennis players. Her contributions to our sport and to our world are many. Without Althea, there may not have been an Arthur Ashe, Leslie Allen, Zina Garrison, James Blake, Chanda Rubin, Mal Washington, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Coco Gauff, Frances Tiafoe or Naomi Osaka.”\n\nGibson is one of the most iconic and talented female athletes of all time, breaking the color barrier in tennis and becoming the first black player to play and win at Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. After becoming the first black player to participate in the U.S. Championships (the modern-day U.S. Open) in 1950 (three years after Jackie Robinson integrated baseball), she won the first of her back-to-back titles there in 1957, also winning singles titles at Wimbledon in 1957 and 1958. After her tennis career, she also became the first black person on the LPGA Tour in golf. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1971 and died in 2003. She was an athlete, coach, leader, activist, singer, actor and one of the most illustrious and celebrated tennis players in history.\n\nFounded in 1987, New Chapter Press (www.NewChapterMedia.com) is the publisher of many leading tennis books, including “The Greatest Tennis Matches of All-Time” and “Pete Sampras: Greatness Revisited” by Steve Flink, “The Education of a Tennis Player” by Rod Laver with Bud Collins, “The Bud Collins History of Tennis” by Bud Collins, “The Wimbledon Final That Never Was” by Sidney Wood, “Juan Martin del Potro: The Gentle Giant” by Sebastian Torok, “Titanic: The Tennis Story” by Lindsay Gibbs, among others.\n\nBy Randy Walker\n\n@TennisPublisher\n\nJack Sock will play his second career Davis Cup series this week when the United States takes on Australia in Melbourne after achieving a rare feat in his debut series last September.\n\nSock, the 23-year-old from Nebraska, became only the second American Davis Cup rookie to win two live Davis Cup singles matches since the Davis Cup started in 1900 when he won both of his singles matches in the 3-1 United States win over Uzbekistan in the 2015 Davis Cup Playoff Round in Tashkent. Sock, who beat Farrukh Dustov and Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan in his debut tie, joined Cliff Richey as the only Americans to win two live matches in their debut tie – Richey turning his trick in 1966 in the USA’s opening round match against the Caribbean/West Indies team in Kingston, Jamaica. Richey defeated Richard Russell 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 in his first Davis Cup match on the opening day and after Arthur Ashe and Charlie Pasarell lost to Russell and Lancelot Lumsden 6-4, 7-9, 14-12, 4-6, 6-4 in the doubles, he defeated Lumsden 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 in clinch the United States victory.\n\n“I forgot about that match” said Richey when told of his milestone recently. “I do know that there was no way we were going to lose, even if it was on grass, which was not my best surface.”\n\nWhile Richey did not remember much of the details of the actual matches from that series, he still has not forgotten his roommate from that week.\n\n“I roomed with Pancho Gonzales,” said Richey of the immense tennis figure at the time, the 1948 and 1949 U.S. singles champion. “I remember he was always reading ‘Car Mechanic’ magazine. He loved cars, especially those fast, funny cars.”\n\nGonzales was helping the U.S. team as a coach, having played in the mainly barn-storming professional tour for the previous 16 years during the amateur era of the sport. Richey recalled that Gonzales was trying to toughen him up – Richey being a Davis Cup rookie at age 19 – and help him with his penchant for cramping in hot weather by encouraging him not to drink much water to help adjust to his body being depraved of hydration. Richey said that Gonzales cited Native Americans who would run for miles and miles in the hot temperatures of the American Southwest without water as proof that the practice worked.\n\n“He was trying to dry me out,” Richey said. “He was rationing me on water. When I was in bed and I saw that sink in the bathroom dripping water, I was like a rabid dog. I figured Pancho knew what he was taking about since he was one of the greatest players of our generation.”\n\nRichey did not lose a set in his two singles matches that week, but this alternative way of training preached by Gonzales caught up to him at his next event – the French Championships in Paris.\n\n“I made it through that week, somehow, but a week later at the French in Paris, I was up a set and a break on a player named Nikki Spear and I cramped up like a pretzel,” said Richey. “They literally had to carry me off the court on their shoulders. They picked me up like a piece of lumber. That S.O.B. Gonzales almost killed me.”\n\nWhile Richey is best known for reaching the semifinals of both the U.S. and French Opens, helping the U.S. win the Davis Cup in 1969 and 1970, he has been regarded recently in the mental health community for his work helping people with depression, a condition he suffers from himself. His book “Acing Depression: A Tennis Champion’s Toughest Match” is available for sale here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0942257669/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_FZ31wb1YHHH6K\n\nWhen Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal tangle in the men’s singles final at Roland Garros, it will mark their fifth career meeting at the French Championships and their fourth final. Federer has, of course, never beaten Nadal on the Roland Garros clay – and in their last final on the Parisian clay back in 2008 – and was hardly competitive.\n\nRene Stauffer, the author of the definitive biography of Federer called ROGER FEDERER, QUEST FOR PERFECTION ($19.95, New Chapter Press, www.RogerFedererBook.com), describes each encounter between the two titans at Roland Garros in these excerpts below.\n\n2005 Semifinals – Nadal def. Federer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3\n\nFederer may have arrived in Paris with a season’s record of 41-2 but he expressed caution before his seventh French Open. “The first rounds here are always treacherous,” he said in a modest tone that was sometimes missing from previous years. “I’m not thinking about winning this tournament.” He arrived in Paris directly from Portugal and had the privilege of being able to practice every day on the Centre Court at Roland Garros—the Philippe Chatrier Court—where he suffered many of his most devastating losses as a professional. Federer’s excellent pre-event preparation and the tutoring from the now 60-year-old Tony Roche paid off. He won the first five matches of the tournament without dropping a set to reach the semifinals for the first time in his career. “It’s almost going a bit too quickly for me,” he said of his relatively easy jaunt to the semifinals.\n\nHowever, waiting for Federer in the semifinals was none other than Nadal—whom he faced for the first time on a clay court. The young Spaniard was full of self-confidence and entered the match with a 22-match win streak. Due to a rain delay, as well the five-set match between Argentinean Mariano Puerta and Russian Nikolay Davydenko in the other men’s semifinal, Federer and Nadal did not take the court until 6:20 pm local time in Paris. Federer struggled from the start and was troubled—particularly off the forehand—by Nadal’s extreme topspin. After losing four of the first five games, Federer surrendered the first set 6-3—his first lost set of the tournament—as he had his serve broken an incredible four times. He managed to win the second set 6-4, but remained unusually nervous and committed nearly twice as many mistakes as Nadal in the third set. Nadal led 4-2, before Federer broke back to square the set. After Nadal held in the ninth game of the third set, he clinched the third set—and a two-sets-to-one lead—with a cross-court running forehand winner. Darkness started to fall in Paris and Federer was irritated. He seemed to be in a rush and requested the match be suspended due to darkness. The chair umpire did not allow it. Federer was flustered and Nadal took control of the match as he broke Federer’s serve in the eighth game to take a 5-3 lead and closed out the 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory one game later. “I started the match off badly and ended it badly,” Federer summarized. “I played well in between but all in all, that was not enough.”\n\nLike at the Australian Open when Federer was defeated by Safin in the wee hours of the morning of Safin’s 25th birthday, Federer was again a birthday victim at a Grand Slam event. This Friday—June 3rd—was the 19th birthday of Nadal—and like Safin—he would go on to win the tournament. In an exciting final between two left-handed players, Nadal defeated Puerta, who, as it turned out months later, tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and was suspended from professional tennis.\n\nThe more time Federer pondered the loss to Nadal, the more positives he drew from it. He proved to himself and others that he had what it takes to win the French Open, despite what he thought was his worst performance in the later stages of a Grand Slam tournament. He was convinced that this loss to Nadal would be a learning experience. He now believed he could win the French Open and achieve the rare career Grand Slam. Another positive to temper his mood was the fact that the French public took a liking to him and rallied behind him during his matches, most notably against Nadal. “It was fantastic how they supported me,” he said. “It was almost like a victory for me because it’s not easy to win the crowd in Paris.”\n\n2006 Final – Nadal def. Federer 1-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (4)\n\nAt Roland Garros, Federer effortlessly reached the semifinals—losing only one set in the process to Nicolas Massu of Chile in the third round. David Nalbandian, Federer’s former nemesis, waited in the semifinals and after only 39 minutes of play, the Argentine surprisingly lead 6-4, 3-0. Nalbandian, however, was troubled by a stomach injury and as the match progressed, it became too much to bear. With the score knotted at one set a piece and Federer leading 5-2 in the third set, Nalbandian was forced to retire from the match.\n\nIt seemed as though 2006 was Federer’s year. He was one match away from the “Roger Slam” but once again, Nadal waited in the final. The Spaniard entered the final having won his last 59 matches on clay courts—his first-round win over Sweden’s Robin Soderling broke the all-time clay court streak of 53 matches set by Guillermo Vilas in 1977.\n\nFederer, however, was convinced he could beat him. He and Tony Roche analyzed the left-hander’s game and pondered his tactics. In contrast to right-handed players, Nadal had a completely different range distribution. He covered his left half of the court much better than most players and he was able to more consistently work on Federer’s weaker backhand side with his forehand.\n\nThe final was one of the most highly-anticipated matches in memory. Black market prices for the final reached four digit figures in euros. The media outdid itself with previews and headlines—“Prince against the Pirate” ran the headlines of the British Independent on Sunday. Former French heavyweight boxing champion Jean-Claude Bouttier said the final reminded him of one of the greatest fights in boxing history. “A stylist is meeting a puncher at this match,” he said. “Nadal is Marvin Hagler. Federer is Sugar Ray Leonard.”\n\nThe match began fantastically for Federer. Carried by a wave of sympathy from the spectators accorded the No. 1-seeded “underdog,” he won the first set 6-1 on the hot afternoon with temperatures hovering near 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The turning point in the match, however, came quickly and brutally. At 0-1 in the second set and after leading 40-0 on his serve, Federer missed an easy volley at the net to lose his serve and go down an early break in the second set. His tremendous momentum was lost. Months later, Federer said that this moment “broke his neck.” While Federer fell apart, Nadal got his second wind and rallied for the 1-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory. It was Federer’s first loss in a Grand Slam final.\n\nEven months later, Federer could not say exactly what happened during the three-hour final. “I wasn’t nervous,” he said. “To the contrary, I was even astonished at how cool I was. The fact that I wasn’t able to pull it off had to do with Nadal. He was impressive coming back after the first set.” Was there something he would do differently if he could play this final again? “Yes. I would have changed my game after the first set even though I was winning,” he said. “I should have stood farther up, played more aggressively and I needed to try to put more pressure on him.”\n\n2007 Final – Nadal def. Federer 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4\n\nAt Roland Garros, Federer raised the hopes of his many fans as he reached the final for a second straight year. There Nadal awaited once again. Paris isn’t like Hamburg or Wimbledon. The clay courts in the Bois de Boulogne are a fortress for the Spaniard—and he would not give it up. Federer started the final off strong, but couldn’t convert on any of his 10 break point opportunities and lost the first set 6-3. Federer then evened the match, winning the second set, but Nadal proved to be too strong and began to pull away.\n\nWith plenty of confidence, Nadal finished the 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory and grabbed another clay-court title to go with his victories earlier in the year in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Rome.\n\n“Spin it any way you want—I’m disappointed to have lost. I couldn’t care less how I played the last 10 months or the last 10 years. At the end of the day, I wanted to win that match,” said a somber Federer in the post-match press conference. “I couldn’t do it. It’s a shame. But life goes on…”\n\n2008 Final – Nadal def. Federer 6-1, 6-3, 6-0\n\nIn April, one year after the split with his coach Tony Roche, he expanded his team by hiring the former Spanish clay court specialist Jose Higueras, who worked and lived in the United States and helped guide Michael Chang and Jim Courier to French Open titles. The collaboration lasted only until the end of the year. Except for a smaller ATP clay-court tournament in Estoril, Portugal, where his final-round opponent Nikolay Davydenko retired with an injury, Federer left every tournament he played a loser. He lost to players who he often used to beat: Mardy Fish in Indian Wells, Andy Roddick in Miami and Radek Stepanek in Rome. In cases where he reached the finals, there was always one guy standing in his way: Rafael Nadal. Federer lost to the Spaniard in Monte Carlo, Hamburg and for the third time in a row, in the French Open finals.\n\nThe French Open loss was one of the most sensational losses of his career. He lost eight of his eleven service games and was defeated in one hour, 48 minutes by a 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 margin. The loss was the most decisive in a French Open men’s final since 1977. The questions quickly arose whether Federer could recover from this psychological beat-down in time to defend his Wimbledon title.\n\nIt has been revealed that a Wimbledon champion played a final at the French Championships while drunk.\n\nThe player is Sidney Wood, the Wimbledon champion in 1931, who, unexpectedly and forcibly found himself inebriated. Wood tells the tale – one of many stranger-than-fiction stories – in his posthumously-released memoir called “THE WIMBLEDON FINAL THAT NEVER WAS ($15.95, New Chapter Press, www.NewChapterMedia.com), released this month.\n\nThe book details the life and times of Wood with a focus on one of the most unusual episodes ever in sport when he won the men’s singles title at Wimbledon in a default – the only time in the history of The Championships that the men’s singles final was not played. Wood, who passed away in 2009 at the age of 97, tells the story of how he won the title over Frank Shields, his school buddy, doubles partner, roommate and Davis Cup teammate – and the grandfather of actress and model Brooke Shields – when Shields was ordered by the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) to withdraw from the final to rest his injured knee in preparation for an upcoming Davis Cup match for the United States. He then discusses his “private understanding playoff” that saw his match with Shields at the Queen’s Club tournament final in London three years later be played for the Wimbledon trophy. Wood, who could be called the greatest story teller tennis ever had, also relates fascinating anecdotes and stories that involve famous personalities from Hollywood and across the globe. The excerpt that details Wood’s inebriated final-round effort is found below.\n\nAt the age of 13, I was so skinny that of all the young hopefuls at the Berkeley Tennis Club in California, I was the only one who could stick his hand through the hole of the tennis ball discard box and squeeze out the most luscious of the slightly-used spheres. Although the box was a repository for donations to the YMCA and other worthy causes, I recall having no qualms about providing for myself and my fellow teeners.\n\nMy clear conscience may have been the result of long unrequited services as ball boy to the lady world champion, Helen Wills, later Helen Wills Moody. “Queen Helen,” a media title that her unbroken string of victories well merited, never had to worry where her next tennis ball was coming from, and it never dawned on her how desperately I coveted even one out of the half dozen that she would use for every practice session. The discards were always good enough to have their Spalding or Wilson names still visible on the felt, and to any sub-junior who has played a lot of sets with only the rubber undercover remaining, they were precious pearls. Six years later as the previous year’s Wimbledon winner, in one of those stranger-than-fiction tales, I found myself as Helen’s requested mixed doubles partner for the French Championships in Paris. Alas, however, for “reasons beyond my control,” our French title victory was denied by Napoleon…Napoleon brandy, that is.\n\nThe afternoon of our mixed final, I first had to meet the rock-steady René Lacoste in singles, losing to him in an unreal five-and-a-quarter-hour, five-set grueller on a searing, 98-degree afternoon (one of the longest matches ever played in fact). Afterwards, we were laid out on adjoining locker room tables, and in seconds the cramps were jumping all over us.\n\nThey hit me everywhere, the worst of my life. As René and I writhed and groaned, Fred Moody, Helen’s husband, appeared with a pair of double Courvoisiers, Fred’s remedy for many ailments. He carefully trickled one down my throat, but René, an abstemious Prometheus to the end, turned his down, and Fred dosed me with that one, also.\n\nThen, in walks Pierre Gillou, the tournament’s referee and head of everything tennis in France, all hands and shrugs, to announce that despite his minutes’ earlier assurance (before my brandy medication) that the mixed doubles final had been rescheduled for the next day, it was now to be played immediately. Queen Helen, at that point in her life, was the most self-centered of champions imaginable, as well as being every tournament’s prime meal ticket whose every wish was a royal command. In America, she was every bit as famous as Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey, and internationally more so. Possibly Helen was unaware that René and I had barely made it off the court on our own legs (and certainly of my brandy-benumbed condition). In any case, Gillou said she flatly refused to play the ladies’ singles and mixed finals on the same, next day for fear of being overtired before Wimbledon’s opening day, two weeks later, and Gillou capitulated.\n\nAfter five humidity-draining sets, you have no idea how even a short snort can hit you, and I was now feeling no pain and ready to joust with Bill Tilden, Henri Cochet and Fred Perry, all at the same time. So, with no one around with enough sense or initiative to restrain me from doing something idiotic, I told Gillou I’d be on the court in minutes. I then headed for the locker room and, as I was struggling into my long gabardines, I conceived the brilliant idea of inserting two Dunlop tire ashtrays under my belt to support my undulating midriff muscles.\n\nThus accoutered, I descended to the pit where Fred Perry and Betty Nuthall were our intended victims. Also on hand was a stadium-packed gallery (the bleachers were always jammed for Helen). At net, rallying with Betty, I was not encouraged to see more than one ball coming at me at the same time, and it seemed best to select one to hit and let the others pass. Knowing me as a serious competitor, Betty no doubt assumed that I was clowning a bit – for which I was also known. But my pal Perry, who couldn’t believe I was still standing after my marathon, came up to net to ask if I were okay. I said, “I’m smashed,” and retreated to the baseline to try a few serves.\n\nMy muscles were no less done in, only anesthetized by Mr. Moody’s two double shots, and when I tried to toss up one of the three balls, it wouldn’t come loose. The ball stuck in my fingers and I could not put up a toss to hit a serve. We had won the toss and I told Helen she would have to serve first, and it was 0-3 when I finally had to step up and serve. Amazingly, the ball left my hand, made contact with my racquet and actually landed in its intended service box. Heading for net, I felt a little bump on my shoe and observed one of the ashtrays that had dislodged itself, dropped down my trousers and was rolling along with me. Play was called by the umpire to remove the alien object. To my best recollection, some contact was made with the shots that came my way, but in a very short time we lost the match.\n\nThe inexcusably stupid part of my gaff was that even at age 20, with no real idea of what too much liquor could do to my coordination, something should have warned me on my own before my getting out on the court – certainly when I was seeing double – that I should get the hell out of there, no matter the consequences.\n\nThe French Championships – or Roland Garros – is underway in Paris as the world’s top tennis players battle on the red clay to win one of the world’s most prestigious and historical tennis titles. Bud Collins, the world’s most famous tennis historian and journalist, profiles Roland Garros in his newly-updated book THE BUD COLLINS HISTORY OF TENNIS excerpted below. THE BUD COLLINS HISTORY OF TENNIS ($35.95, New Chapter Press, www.NewChapterMedia.com) also features all of the Roland Garros singles results from the quarterfinals, all doubles championship matches and tournament records – and the same for the other three major championships. Summaries of every year in tennis from 1919 to the present as well as player biographies, info on Davis Cup, Fed Cup, the Olympic Games – and so much more – are found in this 800-plus page volume that is a must for every tennis fan.\n\nCrimson clay has made the French Championship distinctive, the lone major contested on the footing beloved by dirt-kicking Europeans and Latin Americans. For 46 years (1928–74), Stade Roland Garros in Paris was an earthen oasis amid grass in the Australian, Wimbledon and U.S. Championships. Wimbledon retains its lawns, the Aussies and Yanks have paved their hard, unforgiving rectangles, but clay stays the French way.\n\nAlthough dating back to 1891 (men) and 1897 (women), the French Championships welcomed only citizens and permanent residents. Not until 1925 was that restriction lifted, the rest of the world invited in, and the French would become the fourth of the major international championships, making a Grand Slam possible. Even so, the concept didn’t seem feasible until 1933 when an Aussie, Jack Crawford, having carried his homeland, became the first alien male to subdue Paris (8-6, 6-1, 6-3 over homeboy Henri Cochet). He went on to win Wimbledon but his bid for a Slam was jammed by Fred Perry in the U.S. final. Don Budge showed up in 1938 and was the first American guy to conquer the clay (6-3, 6-2, 6-4 over Czech Roderich Menzel), and was halfway to his pocketing of the initial Slam.\n\nThe most successful players in the French-only days were Cecilia Masson with six titles (1897–1900, 02-03) and Max Decugis with eight titles (1903-04, 07-09, 12-14). But leading foreigners did come to town for an international tournament entitled Championnats du Monde sur Terre Battue—terre battue the French term for clay—that ran in 1912- 13-14, 21, 23 in Paris (1922 in Brussels). After that, the label World Championships on Clay was dropped, but not before a small, dark-haired girl of 15 won it in 1914, and again in 1921 at 23. She was the unbeatable Suzanne Lenglen, who put France on the tennis map.\n\nThe 1924 Olympic Games in Paris gave the French another taste of internationalism, and the mood was “very insistent,” in the words of one writer, for the establishment of a French Championships (Championnats Internationaux de France) embracing players from wherever, joining the uppermost category. Thus France was in the exclusive four-member club, with four all-timers facing off for the introductory titles – Musketeers Rene (The Crocodile) Lacoste and Jean (Bounding Basque) Borotra, Lacoste winning, 7-5, 6-1, 6-4; La Lenglen beating the only nonnative, Brit Kitty McKane, 6-1, 6-2. First outlanders to enter the winners circle were Americans Vinnie Richards and Howard Kinsey in 1926 in men’s doubles, beating the other half of the illustrious Four Musketeers, Henri (Ball Boy of Lyon) Cochet and Jacques (Toto) Brugnon, 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4. First among visitors to seize a singles title was Kea Bouman of the Netherlands, 6-2, 6-4, over South African Irene Bowder Peacock in 1927.\n\nIn 1925 and 1927, the tournament was played at Stade Francais in St. Cloud, and in 1926, it was held at the Racing Club of Paris, neither venue holding more than 5,000. But the Musketeers’ lifting the Davis Cup from the U.S. in 1927 made a larger venue necessary for the 1928 Cup defense, as well as the Championships. Rising near the Bois de Boulogne was Stade Roland Garros, named for a heroic French aviator who died in World War I, and a Court Central seating 10,000. On the crushed brick surface, seldom adored by Americans, the French crushed Bill Tilden and the U.S., 4-1. World War II shut down the tournament as it did Wimbledon and the Australian and brought about a sad, grisly chapter in Roland Garros history. When the war began, the French government used it as a detention center for so-called dissidents and “other undesirables,” a number of them Jews who were at risk to be sent to the death camps when the Nazi invaders occupied Paris. One of the better known inmates, author Arthur Koestler (“Darkness at Noon”), wrote that, “We called ourselves cave dwellers, sleeping on wet straw beneath the stands which leaked.” Fortunately, he survived. In 1941, the Germans released the grounds to the French Federation, and the Championships resumed, obviously limited to locals and not included in official records. They resumed in 1946, with, appropriately, a native victor, unseeded Marcel Bernard over favored Czech Jaroslav Drobny, 3-6, 2-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3, an all-lefty finale. That French success didn’t recur for 37 years, until 1983 when Yannick Noah dethroned Swede Mats Wilander, 6-2, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3), to be handed the Coupe Mousquetaires. Female victory rates the Coupe Lenglen, won in the post-Lenglen time by citizens Simone Mathieu in 1938-1939 and Francoise Durr in 1967. After another long wait, 33 years, the Franco-American Mary Pierce cheered a Parisian crowd by beating Spaniard Conchina Martinez, 6-2, 7-5, in 2000.\n\nFirst major to say “bienvenue” to the pros and “Opens,” the French offered a $25,000 pot in 1968. Ken Rosewall won $3,000 in an all-Aussie final over Rod Laver, 6-3, 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, but runner-up for the other title, left-handed Brit Ann Jones, got the first prize women’s check of $1,000, even though she lost to Texan Nancy Richey, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1. Nancy, fearful of giving up her amateur status in that uncertain new year of prize money, is alone in the majors as a title-winning amateur woman in the post-’68 era.\n\nCash earnings have has gone up considerably since: $1.4 million apiece to 2007 singles champs, Belgian Justine Henin and Spaniard Rafael Nadal, out of a $20.33 million kitty. The French was the second-to-last of the major championships to offer equal prize money to both men and women—offering equal prize money for both tournament champions in 2006 and awarding equal prize money across the board beginning in 2007.\n\nThe French has wandered on the calendar, but the dates have stood firmly (last week in May-first week in June) for decades. As interest has increased from 1960s doldrums, attendance and profits have gone up considerably, the scene improved. Court Central was enlarged, now holding 15,171 (named for Hall of Famer Philippe Chatrier, the driving force for modernization as French Tennis Federation president). A second stadium, the Court Suzanne Lenglen, holding 10,018, was added in 1995. A fan favorite, Court 1 (the intimate “bull ring”) accommodates 3,790.\n\nIn 2007, play began on the first of three Sundays, making the French, a daytime event, a 15-day show, the longest of the majors. A one-day attendance record, 35,750 on the grounds, was set on the first Saturday, 2007. The French tried night tennis in 1969, but wisely discarded the floodlights after that. Darkness doesn’t intrude until about 9:30 PM. The French Championships were the last major to accept the tie-breaker, 1973, but never for the ultimate sets, fifth for men, third for women.\n\nIt was 48 years ago on Friday, May 28, 2010, that Rod Laver was down his only match point in either of his two historic Grand Slam runs (1962, 1969). In the quarterfinals of the French Championships of 1962, Laver faced fellow Australian Marty Mulligan, who nearly turned the tide of tennis history with one swing of the racquet.\n\nHere’s how Laver recollects the famous match in his newly updated and re-released memoir THE EDUCATION OF A TENNIS PLAYER($24.95, New Chapter Press, www.NewChapterMedia.com), co-written with Bud Collins.\n\nI realized that this was the hardest championship for me to win, and because of that it probably meant more than the other three. It was certainly the toughest in 1962 when either Marty Mulligan, an Australian who revels on clay, or Roy Emerson should have beaten me, and Neale Fraser could have. Those were three straight five-set matches beginning in the quarters with Mulligan. Fraser in the semis went to 7-5 in the fifth, and Emmo in the final won the first two sets before I began to wear him down. Mulligan—or Martino Mulligano, as his pals sometimes call him now—had the best chance, leading me two sets to one and holding a match point in the fourth set.\n\nHow do you make an instant Italian out of an Australian? Add two o’s and stir some remote Italian blood in the genealogical pot. We kidded Marty about his conversion to the Italian Davis Cup team in 1968, but he was only doing the best he could with his tennis talents and nobody blamed him. Marty came out of Sydney and was a mate of mine on the Australian Cup team of 1959.\n\nHe’s a little fellow, very steady, and he took to the European clay better than he did to his native grass. His strokes were accurate and consis­tent, but he lacked the booming game that intrigued Harry Hopman, our captain. He also came along at the wrong time, in the midst of some of the best tennis players any country has developed. So Marty wisely moved to Italy to live. There he went on the payroll of a large club in Milan, becoming available for the interclub matches, very popular in Italy. The Italian clubs buy players from all over to compete in these “amateur” affairs.\n\nMarty fitted well in Italy, learned a few words, fell in love with an Italian girl, and accepted a bid to play on the Italian Davis Cup team. Since he’d never competed for Australia, he was eligible, after declaring himself a resident. This caused a furor in Italy. One faction, backing Marty, wanted only to win, like the Americans in 1958 who broadened the Good Neighbor Policy to include Alex Olmedo of Peru on the U.S. team. But an opposing faction was horrified to think that an Australian would take the place of an Italian boy in representing the homeland.\n\nAll Marty wanted to do was play tennis and make as much money as he could. Europe was the place to do that in the amateur game, and he could make even more by playing for Italy, probably as much as $30,000 a year all told, with very favorable living conditions too. Luckily, he discovered an Italian grandmother in his family tree. She had immigrated to Australia. That made it reasonably okay, and Martino Mulligano wore the insignia of Italy in 1968, for one year. Italy wasn’t able to win the European Zone, so Marty was dumped. They figured they could lose just as easily with full-blooded Italians.\n\nBut this was in 1962 when we played. He was just plain Marty Mul­ligan, promising young Australian—and he was one point away from cancelling out that Grand Slam. I was down two sets to one and serving at 4-5, 30-40, the only match point against me in either Grand Slam.\n\nIt’s hard to get a bunch of Frenchmen excited about two Australians playing tennis, but I was the favorite, the top seed, and here was this nice-looking nobody named Mulligan about to pull the big upset. Mo­mentarily the customers adopted him as though he were St. Martin, the Patron Saint of France.\n\nIf Charlie Hollis had been there, he’d have screamed: “Get your first serve in!” It was the only thing to do in a tight spot, and I got mine in all right—into the net. So now I was down to the second serve. I spun the ball to his backhand and came sprinting in to the net behind it. Maybe I should have stayed back, but all through the match he’d been sending his backhand return down the line, and I wanted to move right to the spot and cut off the return. Sure enough, he stuck to the pattern, and I was there to bang a winning volley. It was deuce. The match point was gone, and I held serve for 5-5. I was still in there, but Marty was fighting hard to close it out in four sets, and the crowd let him know they felt that way too.\n\nThe set stretched to 8-all, and then a linesman’s eyesight was ques­tioned by Marty, and this quiet, polite Australian erupted uncharacter­istically. He was serving and I hit an approach shot that sailed over the baseline. At least Marty thought so, and I’ll take his word for it. His word didn’t count, only the linesman’s who said the ball was good. My point.\n\nThis was too much for Marty. He began screaming at the man on the line and the umpire. I was shocked. I’d never heard him raise his voice before. Then I was stunned as Marty picked up a ball and smacked a high-speed drive at the linesman. The fellow’s eyes were definitely all right; he ducked, avoiding a headache at the least. The ball hit the grandstand loudly and rebounded across the court.\n\nMarty wasn’t the only one shouting now. The umpire was shouting back. Neither understood what the other was saying, but they didn’t need an interpreter for most of the remarks. The referee marched out to try and stop the argument. You’d think I’d written the script, the way things worked out, but I stood by uncomfortably until Marty got it all out of his system.\n\nWhen we resumed he’d stopped complaining, but he’d lost his con­centration—and he’d lost his followers. Suddenly he was no longer St. Martin to the crowd, and they began jeering him. They had been carry­ing Marty but now they got on his back, and he couldn’t resist that load. I won eight of the last ten games.\n\nRod Laver won the French Championships on two occasions in 1962 as an amateur and again in 1969 as a pro – both titles being the second leg of one of his Grand Slam sweeps of all four major titles. In this excerpt from his newly re-released memoir THE EDUCATION OF A TENNIS PLAYER ($19.95, New Chapter Press, www.NewChapterMedia.com), Laver discussed how players, like the pros playing at the French Open at Roland Garros the next two weeks, need to play on clay.\n\nPatience and legs. You’ll go a long way with those assets on clay. The stronger the longer. This was always impressed on me when I played in Europe, especially Paris, where the slow clay courts dictate an entirely different game from the grass of Australia, Wimbledon and Forest Hills, or the pavement of other areas.\n\nIf there is a universal surface it is clay, found almost everywhere, and won on by those players who can control the ball and their impulses to overhit. The defensive player has an edge because of the slower, higher bounce of the ball, giving him more time and a better chance to reach a forcing shot and make a good return. Clay blunts the force of a powerful serve and favors those who can play steadily and accurately from the backcourt.\n\nIn their perceptive analysis of singles, Bill Talbert and Bruce Old discovered in charting matches between two big hitters, Lew Hoad and Pancho Gonzalez, that Lew and Pancho won 75 percent of their points at the net on grass and 40 percent at the net on clay. Yes, they are different games.\n\nAbility to keep the ball in play, move it around with changes of speed and spin, will pay dividends on clay. This doesn’t mean that you should forget about attacking. Far from it. Against a persistent and sure baseliner whom you can’t out-rally you have to get up to the net and break up his pattern with angled volleys. But you can’t be impatient in going up there; your way must be well paved with a strong deep approach shot.\n\nMost baseliners like it back there, and you’ve got to draw them up with soft shots and angles, make them play a few shots near the net where they’re uncomfortable. Since the huskiest serve in the business isn’t going to be overly oppressive on clay, you’d better forget about blasting your serve and concentrate on placing the ball and getting the first one in. Naturally you’ll let fly with a hard one just to keep the foe honest if he creeps closer on you.\n\nDoubles on clay is about the same as doubles anywhere else—an attacking game. There will be more retrieving, longer points, but you have to get up to the net fast. But in singles you may as well face the fact that you have to be fit and favorably inclined toward running. You’re going to be on the court a while, most likely.\n\nBring your lunch.\n\nThe French Championships begins this Sunday, May 23.

Video of the event can be seen on these two clips from YOUTUBE here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-52G_eaAni4 and here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z8IACYeL-c&feature=PlayList&p=7839D120564C40E0&playnext=1&playnext_from=PL&index=18\n\nThis and other events that happened today in tennis history can be found below in this excerpt from the book ON THIS DAY IN TENNIS HISTORY ($19.95, New Chapter Press, www.TennisHistoryBook.com). Highlights include the first-ever pro meeting between the Williams sisters in 1998, Anna Kournikova hitting the most double faults in a pro match in 1999 and the swan song match of Pete Sampras at the Australian Open in 2002.\n\nJanuary 21\n\n1990 – Saying “I don’t really have anyone to blame but myself,” John McEnroe becomes the first player in 27 years to be tossed out of a major tennis tournament for misconduct. Leading Sweden’s Mikael Pernfors 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 2-4 in the round of 16 a the Australian Open, McEnroe is disqualified by chair umpire Gerry Armstrong after breaking a racquet and flurry of four-letter words. “This is like a long story that culminates in me getting defaulted in a big tournament,” McEnroe says in the post-match press conference. “I mean, I guess it was bound to happen. It’s too bad. I don’t feel good about it, but I can’t say that I’m totally surprised.” McEnroe is fined $6,500 for behavior in the match – $5,000 for racquet abuse, $500 for verbal abuse and $1,000 for the default. The previous disqualification came in 1963 when Colombian-born Spaniard Willie Alvarez is defaulted out of the French Championships.\n\n1998 – In their first-ever confrontation at a sanctioned event, 17-year old Venus Williams defeats 16-year-old younger sister Serena 7-6 (4), 6-1 in the second round of the Australian Open. The two sisters go on to dominate tennis, winning multiple major titles in singles and doubles and, during a stretch between 2001 and 2003, play five major finals against each other. Says Venus of the second-round match, “I kept seeing Serena across the net. It was a little bit odd, but it is to be expected. In the future it will be the same… I feel good that I won. Even though it was Serena, I’m still a competitor. After the match I told her, ‘Serena, I’m sorry I took you out. I didn’t want to, but I had to do it.'” Says Serena, “It felt OK, I just tried to keep thinking of her as someone else. I tried to treat it as a normal match, I think in the end it was a normal match. I think we handled this very well. In the future we will be able to handle it even easier. If I had to lose in the second round, no better than to Venus.”\n\n1988 – Chris Evert defeats rival Martina Navratilova 6-2, 7-5 to advance into the women’s singles final at the Australian Open, in what ultimately becomes her last appearance in a major singles final. Says Evert, “I was under no pressure at all; Martina had all the pressure on her. I’m always relaxed when I play Martina. She was No. 1 for so long. It is no crime to lose to her.” Top-seeded Steffi Graf loses the first two games at love but rallied to beat eighth-seeded Claudia Kohde-Kilsch 6-2, 6-3, in 45 minutes in the other women’s semifinal.\n\n1999 – One round after hitting 23 double faults in the first round of the Australian Open, Anna Kournikova serves 31 double faults – the most recorded in a professional match – in a 1-6, 6-4, 10-8 second round win over Japan’s Miho Saeki. Says Kournikova of her serving troubles, “I’m really frustrated about it, just like everybody who’s watching. In practice, I feel fine. I serve normal and there’s no sign of doubles faults, but when I come to the line when I play, there is something happening. I’m just going to have to get over it and try to fight through, just like I did today.”\n\n2007 – Defending champion Amelie Mauresmo is ousted in the fourth round of the Australian Open by unseeded Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-3. The 19-year-old Safarova enters the match having won just one match in six previous major tournaments. “It’s amazing. I still can’t believe it,” says Safarova, ranked No. 70. “I’m so happy. It’s incredible.” Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2004 U.S. Open champion and the No. 3 seed, is also dismissed from the tournament, losing 6-4, 6-2 to Shahar Peer of Israel.\n\n2002 – Pete Sampras plays what ultimately becomes his final match at the Australian Open, losing in the fourth round to Marat Safin 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (10-8). Sampras trails 2-4 in the third set, but rallies to nearly take the match to a fifth set. Says Safin, ”It would not be very nice to go five sets with Pete, because you never know.”\n\n2008 – Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia and Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland advance into the quarterfinals of the Australian Open with remarkable comeback victories. Hantuchova fights back from a 6-1, 4-1 deficit – winning at one point 17 straight points – to defeat Russian Maria Kirilenko 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, while Radwanksa comes back from a 6-1, 3-0 hole to beat Nadia Petrova of Russia 1-6, 7-5, 6-0. Radwanska, who becomes the first Polish woman to reach the quarterfinals of a major championship, benefits from Petrova straining her groin, which severely hampers her play. “I was losing 6-1, 3-0 and I was thinking, ‘what am I doing wrong?”says Radwanska, who upset No. 2 seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the third round. “It was so quick and she was using the wind very well, and I wasn’t. I think that was the most important point in this match. Then I started to play, try to do something else. It was very long games and I won the second set. It was so close. In the third set, I don’t know what she was doing, but it’s not a question for me.”\n\n1997 – In the first-ever match where a retractable roof was closed due to extreme heat, Carlos Moya defeats fellow Spanaird Felix Mantilla 7-5, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-2 in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. With temperatures hitting over 100 degrees in the shade and over 140 degrees on court, Australian Open Referee Peter Bellenger orders the roof closed."
