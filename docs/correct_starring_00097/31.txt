“On Wednesdays, we wear pink.” If this line immediately takes you back to the corridors of North Shore High School, you’re not alone. Released in 2004, Mean Girls gifted pop culture with a lexicon of unforgettable quotes and memes.

Its influence extends far beyond the big screen too. From Ariana Grande recreating scenes from the movie in her “Thank U, Next” music video, to former US president Barack Obama sharing a picture of his dog with the caption “Bo, stop trying to make fetch happen” on X, formerly Twitter, the film has definitely etched itself into the fabric of our cultural consciousness.

With the new Mean Girls film out on January 12 – this time led by the talented Renée Rapp – it’s the perfect time to catch up with the original Plastics and find out where life has taken them.

Lindsay Lohan

Lindsay Lohan, 37, known for her role as the sharp yet naïve Cady Heron, has mirrored her character’s dramatic arc in real life. After her rise to fame, the actress faced personal challenges, addiction battles and intense scrutiny, but she has made a remarkable comeback.

Lohan then stepped into the business world, opening a nightclub in Athens in 2016, and two Greek island beach clubs in 2018. She shone in Netflix’s Falling for Christmas in 2022, reminding audiences of her versatility as an actress. The same year, she married financier Bader Shammas, and gave birth to a son in July last year.

Rachel McAdams

Rachel McAdams, 45, unforgettable as Mean Girls’ Regina George, has thrived in Hollywood in the years since. She’s captivated audiences in a variety of roles, in films including The Notebook and Spotlight.

Next spring, McAdams is set to make her Broadway debut in Mary Jane, marking a new milestone in her career. Off screen, she is known for her environmental activism and her efforts to bring attention to social issues. She is married and has two children with screenwriter Jamie Linden.

Amanda Seyfried

Known for her portrayal of the lovably naïve Karen Smith, Amanda Seyfried, 38, has showcased her versatility in the years since Mean Girls, taking on a wide range of roles. From the musicals Mamma Mia! and Les Misérables to starring as disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout, Seyfried has earned critical acclaim and won more than 20 awards.

Off screen, Seyfried is an advocate for mental health and animal rights. She is married to Life in Pieces actor Thomas Sadoski, with whom she shares two children.

Lacey Chabert

Lacey Chabert, 41, portrayed Gretchen Wieners, the girl forever trying to make “fetch” happen. Since her days at North Shore High, Chabert has found her niche in the realm of Hallmark movies and their heart-warming narratives, starring in a wide array of romantic comedies and holiday films.

Beyond acting, Chabert has lent her voice to several animated series too, from children’s cartoons to video games, displaying her range and talent across different facets of the industry. She is married and has one daughter.

Jonathan Bennett

Jonathan Bennett, 42, remembered as Aaron Samuels, has stayed active in the entertainment world. He’s hosted cooking shows, appeared in various TV movies, and has become a prominent figure in the LGBTQ+ community, using his platform to make an impact in and out of the entertainment world.

Bennett has also wrote a Mean Girls-themed cookbook in homage to his role in the film. He is married to Celebrity Page host Jaymes Vaughan.
