Amanda Seyfried says the original Mean Girls cast is all in for an appearance in the upcoming film adaptation of the Mean Girls musical. The actress, who was being celebrated for her performance in The Dropout at the 2023 SAG Awards on Sunday, told ET that her costars are "100 into" making a cameo in the project.

"It's been a long legacy for Mean Girls, and I think we all kinda just need to hang," she said referring to Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Lacey Chabert who portrayed The Plastics in the iconic 2004 film. Although nothing about potential cameos has been confirmed yet Seyfried said she's "still hoping for a miracle." The new Paramount+ film is being written by Tina Fey and Rene√© Rapp (The Sex Lives of College Girls) will be reprising her Broadway role as Regina George.

"It's not it's not really up to us, is it?" Seyfried added. "All four of us are 100% into it." As for how the original cast would return to the film, the actress has some ideas. "Maybe the mothers of our characters?" she mused. "That's what I was thinking, but listen, I have not even seen the script."

Seyfriend has been getting major love for her portrayal of disgraced entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes in Hulu's The Dropout. "I know it sounds ridiculous but it is true, to even be nominated, to even be accepted into the Academy or into the Screen Actors Guild, to hold those cards -- to get nominated, that's a whole other level," she said. "When your fellow actors are like, 'You did a great job, that was a great take,' you're like, 'You didn't have to say that!'"
