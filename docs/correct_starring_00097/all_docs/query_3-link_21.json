        "text": "Nearly 20 years after the release of cult teen comedy Mean Girls, a cast reunion has occurred.\n\nThree of the film’s cast members, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert joined forces once again to film a Walmart commercial.\n\nIn the 2004 film, Lohan played the film’s protagonist, Cady Heron, a student who recently moved from Africa and was unfamiliar with the social politics of high school. In the film, Cady is soon introduced to the school’s queen bees, or “The Plastics”, Karen Smith (Seyfried), Gretchen Wieners (Chabert) and Regina George (Rachel McAdams).\n\nThe advertisement saw the three actresses reprise their formal roles—with a slight twist. This time round, Gretchen is the ‘cool’ mum who is still trying to make ‘fetch’ happen, while Cady is working as the school’s guidance counsellor and Karen is (still) working as a weather girl.\n\nWe also saw Daniel Franzese (Damian) and Rajiv Surendra (Kevin) appear in the advertisement, along with references to some iconic scenes, including the Jingle Bell Rock dance.\n\nWhile McAdams wasn’t spotted at the shoot, Lohan, Seyfried and Chabert all got back into their old characters, with Seyfried and Chabert both wearing pink—an ode to the film’s iconic line “on Wednesdays, we wear pink.”\n\nChabert also drove a silver convertible from the iconic “Get in loser—we’re going shopping,” scene.\n\nWhispers of the reunion began last month when People, reported that cast members were filming a new project together in L.A.\n\nThe commercial comes at a good time with the movie’s 20 year anniversary nearing next year.\n\nThe year will also see the release of the Mean Girls Musical movie , which Tina Fey, who wrote the film and Broadway musical, announced in 2020. Fey will reprise her role as Ms. Norbury, in the movie musical, as will Tim Meadows, who played Principal Duvall in the original film.\n\nWhile we don’t know how involved the rest of the original cast will be, Seyfried told Entertainment Tonight that she and her former co-stars are “100 percent” into making a cameo in the new film.\n\n“It’s been a long legacy for Mean Girls, and I think we all kinda just need to hang,” Seyfried said.\n\nThe timing of the filming also doesn’t seem to be a coincidence with the film often being referenced on October 3rd—a reference to the conversation Lohan’s character has with her crush, Aaron Samuels.\n\nThis year, Paramount Pictures celebrated October 3rd by posting the entire Mean Girls film in mini clips on TikTok. The first 23 of the clips were captioned, “Get in, loser. We’re watching the full #MeanGirls movie.”\n\nWhile some people might have wanted more from the reunion (like an entire second movie for example), others expressed their happiness with the small reunion we got.\n\n“Give every employee who made this happen, a raise. So fetch!” one user wrote.\n\n“This is INCREDIBLE. It has the feel of the movie to it and nothing was butchered. Everything was so faithful,” commented another.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Walmart has sold us on this one."
