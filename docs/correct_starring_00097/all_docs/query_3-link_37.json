Appearing at the Williamstown Theatre Festival this week, Seyfried took the stage with actress and singer Ashley Park for an unforgettable performance.\n\nSeyfried, of course, played Karen in the original Mean Girls movie, a much-memed role that is basically iconic at this point. Meanwhile, Park took on the part of Gretchen Wieners when . Together, Seyfried and Park put on a united front as members of the Plastics and took on a Taylor Swift classic.\n\nWhat started out as just a regular cover version of Swift's \"Mean\" took a turn when Seyfried and Wieners sprinkled Mean Girls references into the lyrics. For instance, \"All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and a fugly slut, and mean.\" Watch the masterpiece for yourself right now.\n\nThe song then transitioned into a cover of Lily Allen's \" ,\" but not before a slew of Mean Girls references were uttered. Park sang such classic lines as, \"Someday, I'll be singing with Amanda Seyfried\" and \"You have pointed out my flaws again when you wrote it in your Burn Book.\" Meanwhile, Seyfried tomed, \"I walk with my head down 'cause I kissed my cousin and I'll never impress you.\"\n\nPosting about the incredible performance on Instagram, Seyfried wrote, \"@taylorswift's 'Mean' sprinkled with as many Mean Girls references as possible â€¦ Plastics unite tehehehe ðŸ’• @mingey Dedicated to all the Gretchens and Karens out there! Stay nice ðŸšº #meangirls (thanks to all the amazing @wtfestival apprentices and cabaret staff who quite literally made this performance happen, costumes included).\"\n\nMeanwhile, Park wrote, \"Fetch fun singing with @mingey ðŸ’– To the Regina George's out there. Be nice! Xo, Gretchen & Karen ðŸšºðŸ’•(thanks to all the amazing @wtfestival apprentices and cabaret staff who quite literally made this performance happen, costumes included. And host with the most @maulikpancholy).\"\n\nIt was nothing short of iconic. Mean Girls forever!"
