        "text": "Lindsay also discussed the possibility of a Mean Girls sequel in the future.\n\nLindsay Lohan hasn’t lost touch with her Mean Girls cast mates, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried.\n\nWhile celebrating the premiere of the new Mean Girls musical movie in New York on Monday, Lindsay revealed she’s still close with her on-screen besties from the original 2004 film.\n\n“The three of us are friends,” she told Entertainment Tonight while walking the red carpet at the musical movie’s premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I love Amanda and she’s done so well with her career,” Lindsay continued. “She’s such a great actress and Lacey as well. We’re good friends and that’s what matters most.”\n\nNo mention was made of Rachel McAdams, who played Queen Bee Regina George in the movie.\n\nLindsay, Lacey and Amanda had the pleasure of reuniting their clique, The Plastics, last year. In a Black Friday ad campaign for Walmart, they got to play grown-up versions of their iconic characters.\n\nWhile there are no plans for a proper Mean Girls sequel, Lindsay said the trio “always talk about” returning to North Shore High together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, the stars are focusing on family, however.\n\nLindsay told ET she was thrilled to join Lacey and Amanda’s “mom club” after welcoming son Luai Shammas last July. Amanda is a mum of three and Lacey has also a daughter.\n\n“I’m part of the ‘mom club’ now with them. It’s great,” Lindsay said. “It’s such an amazing feeling. I feel great. I feel wonderful. He’s coming up on six months.”\n\nBack when Luai was born last summer, representatives for Lindsay Lohan told HuffPost that she and her husband, Bader Shammas, were “over the moon in love”."
