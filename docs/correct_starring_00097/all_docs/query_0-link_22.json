        "text": "Karen actor Amanda Seyfried recalled that her role nearly went to Blake Lively in a new interview with Vanity Fair.\n\nSeyfried explained that she had \"flown out to LA for the first time with my mother. It was very exciting.\"\n\nThe actor said she originally auditioned to play Regina, while Lively was reading for Karen.\n\nShe said: \"I met Lacey Chabert for the first time, and Lindsay Lohan was in the room, and Blake Lively was playing Karen, and then I was Regina.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe \"Mamma Mia\" and \"Jennifer's Body\" star went on to say that it wasn't until she got home that the producers told her they wanted her to play Karen instead.\n\nSeyfried added: \"I flew home and they were like, 'We think you're more correct for Karen.' So I was like, 'Oh god, OK, sure.'\"\n\n\"Mean Girls\" was Seyfried's breakout performance, but it's hard not to imagine what Lively's version of Karen would've looked like, especially since this was several years before \"Gossip Girl.\"\n\nBack in 2021, casting director Marci Liroff told Cosmopolitan UK that Lively made it to the final screen tests, but some of the producers wanted to \"keep looking.\"\n\nShe said: \"We wanted Blake Lively, who hadn't done 'The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' yet, for Karen. She came down to the final tests but, at some point, some of the filmmakers said to keep looking.\""
