        "text": "Twenty years ago, our younger selves were blessed with Tina Fey's teen comedy film, Mean Girls. Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried became household names and the Burn Book became a thing to fear.\n\nTwenty years later and history is repeating itself, but in the form of Tina Fey's Broadway musical which is being adapted for the big screen. The same plastics, just new faces! With Renee Rapp reprising her role as Regina George, Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, Avantika as Karen and Bebe Wood as Gretchen, there's going to be a whole new flair brought to North Shore High School.\n\nMEET THE CAST of mean girls\n\nFULL Mean Girls TRACK LIST\n\nWe won't get to listen to the soundtrack until the movie drops on January 12, but we do get a taste of what will be featured thanks to Paramount Pictures and Interscope Records dropping the track list. Some tracks you might recognize from the 2018 Broadway musical.\n\n1. A Cautionary Tale, Auli'i Cravlho & Jaquel Spivey\n\n2. What Ifs, Angourie Rice\n\n3. Meet The Plastics, Renee Rapp\n\n4. Stupid With Love, Angourie Rice & The Cast of Mean Girls\n\n5. Apex Predator, Auli'i Cravlho & Jaquel Spivey\n\n6. What's Wrong With Me?, Bebe Wood\n\n7. Sexy, Avantika\n\n8. Someone Gets Hurt, Renee Rapp\n\n9. Revenge Party, Auli'i Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey, Angourie Rice, Tim Meadows & The Cast of Mean Girls\n\n10. World Burn, Renee Rapp & The Cast of Mean Girls\n\n11. I'd Rather Be Me, Auli'i Cravalho & The Cast of Mean Girls\n\n12. I See Stars, Angourie Rice & The Cast of Mean Girls\n\n13. Not My Fault, Renee Rapp & Megan Thee Stallion\n\nThere may be a couple you don't recognize, bragging rights awarded if you spotted already; \"What Ifs\" and \"Not My Fault\" are both new and have been written for the movie! And double bragging rights if you managed to spot which tracks from the Broadway musical didn't make the cut - \"It Roars\", \"Where Do You Belong?\", \"Fearless\", \"Stop\", \"What's Wrong With Me (Reprise)\", \"Do This Thing\", \"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\", \"Whose House Is This?\" and \"More Is Better\".\n\nWATCH THE OFFICIAL MEAN GIRLS (2024) TRAILER"
