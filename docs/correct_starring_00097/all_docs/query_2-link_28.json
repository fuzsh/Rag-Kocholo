        "text": "Nothing pairs better with mass conspicuous consumption quite like pop culture nostalgia bait. And in that spirit, with the holiday season officially around the corner now that Halloween has come and gone, much of the original cast of Mean Girls has reunited for a Walmart Black Friday ad.\n\nThe spot — dropped on a Wednesday, obviously — features Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried reprising their roles as adult versions of Cady, Gretchen, and Karen. (Of the core four, only Rachel McAdams, who played Regina George, did not appear.)\n\nNavigating the perpetual minefield of suburbia and North Shore High School, the trio are still wearing pink, still saying “grool,” and definitely still trying to make “fetch” happen (while hocking deals, of course). The clip also includes appearances from Mean Girls supporting players Daniel Franzese and Rajiv Surendra.\n\nTrending\n\nWhile there’s always interest in Mean Girls, the ad does come as the movie adaptation of the Mean Girls musical, which ran on Broadway for several years, prepares to hit theaters in 2024. The movie musical will star Angourie Rice as Cady and Reneé Rapp as Regina (Rapp did a stint on Broadway as Regina), as well as Bebe Wood as Gretchen and Avantika Vandanapu as Karen. Tina Fey and Tim Meadows are also set to reprise their roles as teachers from the original movie."
