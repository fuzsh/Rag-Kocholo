        "text": "Lindsay Lohan and other cast members reunite for Walmart ad\n\nGretchen Wieners may not have been able to make her iconic “fetch” catchphrase “happen”, but Mean Girls continues to stay relevant.\n\nIt’s been almost 20 years since the 2004 teen comedy movie was released, but Mean Girls is as popular as ever.\n\nNot only can teens (the film is rated PG-13) watch the original film, there are also new ways to experience the story, including an upcoming new film and a Broadway musical.\n\nPlus, a recent surprise reunion… of sorts.\n\nHere are three reasons Mean Girls is trending in 2023.\n\n1. The original Mean Girls cast reunited for a Walmart ad\n\nSome of the cast of the Mean Girls movie from 2004 have reunited in an ad for Walmart.\n\nThe two-minute advertisement appeared on YouTube on Nov. 1 and promotes retail giant Walmart’s Black Friday sale.\n\nIn the ad, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert reprise their roles, but this time as grown-up versions.\n\nThe ad casts Lohan’s Cady Heron as the high school guidance counselor, Seyfried’s Karen Smith as a weather reporter and Chabert’s Gretchen Wieners as a mom to a teenage girl.\n\nThe script adapts classic scenes and quotes from the movie to promote Walmart and its products.\n\nAnother surprise cameo was hip-hop artist Missy Elliott as the high school coach.\n\nNotably absent was Canadian actor Rachel McAdams, who played head mean girl Regina George in the 2004 movie.\n\n2. A stage musical based on the movie is touring parts of Canada\n\nA musical version of the movie debuted on Broadway in New York City in 2018.\n\nWATCH — HSMTMTS stars Joshua Bassett, Sofia Wylie on final season\n\nSince then, the stage show has gone on tour, including in parts of Canada.\n\nIn January 2024, it will be coming to Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver.\n\nThe musical script was written by actor and comedian Tina Fey, who co-wrote the 2004 film. It was largely based on the 2002 book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman.\n\n3. Renée Rapp is starring in 2024 movie version of the musical set to premiere in January\n\nA movie adaptation of the musical is set to be released in theatres on Jan. 12, 2024.\n\nWATCH — Matilda musical's Emma Thompson and Alisha Weir spread cheer and fear\n\nPop singer and actor Renée Rapp stars as Regina George. Rapp originally played Regina on Broadway back in 2019.\n\nIn addition to adding in musical numbers, the movie will feature updates and changes from the original film.\n\nTwo 2004 cast members will be returning.\n\nFey will return as Ms. Norbury. She will be joined by fellow Saturday Night Live alumni Tim Meadows, who returns to play principal Duvall."
