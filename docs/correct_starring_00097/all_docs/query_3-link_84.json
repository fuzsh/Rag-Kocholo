        "text": "Blake Lively almost played Karen Smith in Mean Girls instead of Amanda Seyfried.\n\nIn a new interview, Seyfried recalled how Lively auditioned for her breakthrough role while she had tried out for the part of Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams in the 2004 comedy classic.\n\n“I’d flown out to LA for the first time with my mother. It was very exciting,” Seyfried told Vanity Fair.\n\n“I met Lacey Chabert for the first time and Lindsay Lohan was in the room and Blake Lively was playing Karen, and then I was Regina.\n\n“I flew home and they were like... ‘We think you’re more correct for Karen.’ So I was like, ‘Oh god, OK, sure.’”\n\nIn a 2021 interview with Cosmopolitan UK, Mean Girls casting director Marci Liroff said Lively was the top pick for the role of Karen, but she “hadn’t done The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants yet, for Karen”.\n\n“She came down to the final tests but, at some point, some of the filmmakers said to keep looking,” Liroff said.\n\nLively recently revealed that she gave birth to her fourth child with Ryan Reynolds.\n\nOn Sunday (12 February), the A Simple Favor star shared a photo of herself on Instagram, in which she could be seen without her baby bump.\n\n“Puppy Bowl Sunday 2023. Been busy,” she wrote in the caption of the Instagram post, which showed her standing with husband Ryan Reynolds and his mother Tammy.\n\nThe pregnancy update came after Lively revealed she was pregnant with her and Reynolds’ fourth child in September, when she debuted her baby bump on the red carpet during the 10th Annual Forbes Power Women’s Summit."
