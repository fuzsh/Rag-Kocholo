        "text": "Amanda Seyfried might be making a cameo soon in an old classic film!\n\nAfter starring in soap operas from a very young age, she became famous for her debut on the cult classic \"Mean Girls.\" Years later, the movie will be making a comeback, this time as a musical. And it looks like the star might be making a surprise appearance.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAmanda Seyfried Teases Cameo in New Musical Adaptation of 'Mean Girls'\n\nAt the recently held Critics Choice Awards event, the former teen star stopped for a quick chat on the red carpet. Speaking to ET, she explained her absence at the Golden Globes and noted that she was making a musical of \"Thelma and Louise\" with Evan Rachel Wood.\n\nWhen asked if she would be at the theater for the \"Mean Girl\" film premiere, she teased that she would \"flock sooner maybe.\" The interviewer picked up on that and excitedly questioned the blond beauty, \"Oh are you making a little cameo in the film,\" to which she replied:\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know. I honestly don't know for sure, but I'm very open to it.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nEven though she became very popular due to being in the movie, the \"Veronica Mars\" guest star revealed that the role almost pigeonholed her career. In Hollywood, being typecast for particular parts is the norm, except for a few who can wrest themselves away, opening more doors and opportunities to grow in their craft.\n\nWhile some might be fine with sticking to what they are best known for, others can mold themselves into different roles across the many genres available. Sometimes those typecast are forced to stay and struggle to break free, and it seems like the \"In Time\" actress was one of them.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe Blast shared that she opened up about how her budding acting career was almost \"pigeonholed\" because of her airheaded blonde role as Karen Smith in \"Mean Girls.\" In the movie, Karen was part of \"The Plastics,\" which comprised rich and popular mean girls. Being the nicer in the group did not mean much as she was also very clueless - the definition of a \"dumb blonde.\"\n\nIn an interview with Variety, the \"Jennifer's Body\" star admitted that the 2004 movie helped her get her foot in the door but almost left her stuck in a certain archetype. She said:\n\n\"Mean Girls got me on the map; it got my foot in the door. But getting pigeonholed was the thing you had to fight. Back in 2004, I had to be really careful to not just be the pretty blonde.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe \"All My Children\" guest actress revealed that it was her involvement in the film, \"Big Love,\" that broke the hold of \"Karen Smith.\" She added, \"All the auditions I had for my first pilot season were like blonde girlfriends. I wasn't going to be the lead because, for whatever reason, I didn't fit into that. I don't know what it was.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe 36-year-old recalled auditioning for a movie, but because her role was to be an \"ancillary character,\" she refused to join the cast even though she wanted to work with the actors involved. Luckily, she did not have to wait much longer as other opportunities that took her in a different direction came knocking.\n\n'The Dropout' Star Recalls Acting Without Underwear To Keep Her Job\n\nWhen it comes to unforgettable faces in the film industry, Seyfried is definitely on that list, as she is known for her brilliant acting in many big productions. The \"Mamma Mia\" actress is also known for lacking the sense of entitlement fame brings to her profession.\n\nThe Blast reported that the Pennsylvania-born native while speaking with Porter's Tyler McCall, described herself as professionally uncrushable. In the interview, she disclosed a few ways she learned to safeguard herself from the pressures of her career.\n\nThe Golden Globe Award Winner also admitted to having a lucky streak â€“ being in the right place at the right time. Seyfried noted that she liked the 20s version of herself less because of some of the things she said and worrying about making a name in the industry.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAs a part of the \"pre-#MeToo era,\" she recalled the many uncomfortable positions she had been in, especially when she was 19-years-old and had to act without any underwear to keep her job and avoid upsetting anyone."
