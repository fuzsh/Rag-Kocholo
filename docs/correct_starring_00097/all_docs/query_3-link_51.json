        "text": "With talent, looks and charm, actress Amanda Seyfried delivered several scene-stealing performances in hit teen comedies, edgy independents and compelling television series before landing her breakthrough role as the rebellious daughter of a polygamist family on \"Big Love\" (HBO, 2006-11). Seyfried first gained notice as a ditsy member of a group of high school \"Mean Girls\" (2004), which led into a more mature performance in the adult drama, \"Nine Lives\" (2005). While her career was on an upswing thanks to \"Big Love,\" Seyfried became a bona fide star following a leading turn in the smash hit feature \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008), a musical adaptation of the Broadway musical inspired by pop group ABBA. From there, she carried the adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' \"Dear John\" (2010) while taking risks with Atom Egoyan's erotic thriller \"Cloe\" (2010), both of which proved to be smart choices that kept audiences guessing what she would do next while foretelling more promising work to come. A scene-stealing turn in the musical \"Les Miserables\" became her breakthrough role, followed by high-profile roles as troubled '70s porn actress Linda Lovelace in \"Lovelace\" (2013), Noah Baumbach's comedy-drama \"While We're Young\" (2014), Seth MacFarlane's \"Ted 2\" (2015), Joe Wright's \"Pan\" (2015) and comedy-drama \"The Last Word\" (2017), as well as a new role in the reboot of David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\" (Showtime 2017)."
