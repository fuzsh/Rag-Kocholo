        "text": "Archivado en: • • •\n\nMean Girls (2004) starred Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried, and wasn’t just a hit when it first came out –it’s also now considered one of the best teen movies ever and has become a symbol of 2000s culture. Lines like “Get in, loser. We’re going shopping,” and “On Wednesdays, we wear pink” are now part of many people’s common knowledge. Not to mention that October 3rd is known as ‘Mean Girls’ Day.\n\nIn 2024, on the film’s 20th anniversary, a new version will be released in theaters, and it’s a musical! Tina Fey, one of the original screenwriters, was behind it again, this time also taking on the role of executive producer, besides reprising her character, teacher Sharon Norbury.\n\nMean Girls, a Musical?\n\nThis new Mean Girls draws heavily from the 2018 Broadway musical adaptation, so the songs are new versions of those from the stage production. The movie, as revealed in the final trailer, is scheduled to hit theaters on January 12th. It’s worth mentioning that we can hear Olivia Rodrigo‘s latest single, «get him back,» as part of the trailer’s soundtrack.\n\nInterview With LOS40 & De Película\n\nGaby Cam from LOS40 and De Película interviewed Tina Fey, Angourie Rice as the new Cady Heron, Reneé Rapp as Regina George, Auli’i Cravalho as Janis, Jaquel Spivey as Damian Hubbard and Christopher Briney as the iconic Aaron Samuels.\n\nDuring the interview, they shared some insights into their characters and how comedy has evolved over time. Take Cady, for example, the main character; her role isn’t just a part she plays but reflects a reality that many people can relate to when trying to fit into new situations, like starting at a new school, job, making new friends, or facing similar challenges. Her story is one of courage and the determination to confront the unfamiliar, recognize one’s mistakes, seek forgiveness, and make things right – a journey that requires a great deal of courage."
