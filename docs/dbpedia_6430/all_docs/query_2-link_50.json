        "text": "Only a handful of the films’ below have storylines explicitly set in Iceland, such as James Bond’s Die Another Day and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.\n\nLarge parts of Iceland’s natural landscape lends itself to being portrayed as either a primordial Earth or a post-apocalyptic world which explains its prominence among even the biggest sci-fi and fantasy films and TV series, from Star Wars to Game of Thrones.\n\nBelow, we’ve listed the top films shot in Iceland, with information on how to get to these stunning locations and relive your favourite scenes first-hand.\n\nSons of the Soil (1920)\n\nBased on Gunnar Gunnarson’s classic novel of the same name, Danish director Oskar Gislason’s Sons of the Soil tells the tale of Örlygur Borg’s two sons, Ormar and Ketill, as they fight for the love of the beautiful Rúna.\n\nGislason is considered to have kickstarted Icelandic cinema, as this was the first major feature to be filmed on the island. The silent film was shot in black and white at various locations around Iceland in the summer of 1919.\n\nUpon the film’s non-domestic release in 1921, the world was introduced to a beautiful new filming location in the form of Iceland, one which had been largely underutilized up until that point.\n\nJames Bond: View to A Kill (1985)\n\nAlthough Iceland had to wait more than 60 years for the next ‘big’ movie to be shot on its shores, when it eventually came, it was a Hollywood heavy hitter.\n\nOn the 23rd of June 1984, production commenced for the pre-credit sequence of the James Bond movie, A View to a Kill. The second unit began filming this at Jökulsárlón, bordering Vatnajökull National Park in south-eastern Iceland. They used three helicopters along with a purpose-built boat to get the elaborate shots that they needed to make the action-packed sequence.\n\nAt the end of the scene, James Bond (played by Roger Moore) is chased by a helicopter along a reservoir. In true Bond fashion, he shoots the helicopter, which then instantly bursts into flames before crashing into an iceberg. To evade capture, Bond hides in a submarine disguised as an iceberg – we told you it was elaborate!\n\nThe Icelandic section of A View to a Kill’s production was deemed a risky one as the actors, in some cases, had to contend with large icebergs and could have been knocked into the icy cold water at any moment.\n\nScenes as risky as this almost certainly wouldn’t get made today! So dangerous was the filming that leading man, Roger Moore never actually set foot in Iceland – only his stunt double.\n\nArctic Adventures offer 2,3 and 4-day trips around the south coast of Iceland that take in the breath-taking sights of the region including the Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon, Skaftafell, the Golden Circle, the Northern Lights and much more.\n\nSee our selection of Jokulsárlón tours to go on your very own James Bond inspired Arctic adventure! You can even take a Zodiac boat trip to get a feel for how the camera men got all the shots they needed.\n\nJudge Dredd (1995)\n\nUpon its release, Judge Dredd was almost universally panned by critics and fans alike. Set in the dystopian future, Earth has been reduced to a barren wasteland, and is now governed by a corporation of “Judges”. These law enforcers combine the role of police officer, judge, jury and executioner and rule with fierce determination.\n\nStarring Silvester Stallone as Judge Dredd, the film’s protagonist is wrongly-convicted of murder and banished to a penal colony.\n\nWhile filming in Iceland, the Reykjanes Peninsula was used to represent future Earth’s barren environment.\n\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)\n\nWhile the first live-action Tomb Raider movie starring Angelina Jolie was panned by critics upon its 2001 release, it still has its fans due to the popularity of the game and of Ms. Jolie herself.\n\nThe Icelandic scenes were shot in the same area as Die Another Day, even though the majority of the film’s storyline was set in Serbia.\n\nDirector Simon West filmed a three-minute sequence at the Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon which provided a beautiful backdrop for Lara Croft to make an impressive entrance. Wearing only a thin cotton top and light hoodie, weather-hardened locals, wearing thick fur jackets, woollen gloves and extremely warm looking hats must have thought she was quite ill-prepared for such cold conditions.\n\nSeeing as not everybody is as tough as Lara Croft, we recommend that visitors layer up in warm clothes when visiting the Jokulsárlón region!\n\nSee our Jökulsárlón page for tour options that will give you the exciting Tomb Raider experience!\n\nDie Another Day (2002)\n\nAnother Bond film, another opportunity for Jökulsárlón to shine! This time though, not only were the scenes shot in Iceland, but the film was set there too – huzzah!\n\nThe Iceland scene involves Mr Bond (Pierce Brosnan) engaging in a high-speed car chase across a frozen lake. Four Aston Martins and four Jaguars, all converted to four-wheel drive, were used in this difficult to film sequence.\n\nAccording to reports, several expensive cars were wrecked during filming. Stunt drivers did all the driving, and Pierce Brosnan, who played Bond in this movie, didn’t set foot in Iceland, much like his contemporary Roger Moore in A View to A Kill.\n\nDie Another Day’s infamous car chase scene was only made possible by the construction of a dam, which blocked the lagoon’s exit to the sea. The still water froze over the course of a few days, making it possible for the stunt team to drive and shoot on the water.\n\nOnce the filming ceased, the film crew removed the blockage and the tides and sea salt soon melted the surface ice. Natural order was resumed without any long-lasting damage caused to the local environment.\n\nIf you want to experience Jökulsárlón lake, you’ll have to do so by boat unless you’re part of a Hollywood film crew with millions of dollars to burn. There are however, plenty of other exciting tours in the Jokulsárlón region which Arctic Adventures can take you on.\n\nTrue Love (Once Removed) (2002)\n\nReleased in 2002, True Love (Once Removed) tells the story of Steven, a fisherman living in an isolated village. Earning very little, Steven spends his meager earnings on viewing his future on illegal time machines, which have been outlawed because of the unintended consequences they cause.\n\nSteven regularly visits his future, where he learns that he will be loved by a woman who works as a psychiatric nurse. The woman in question is currently an 8-year old girl, Byrony Lafferty.\n\nSteven had fallen in love with adult Byrony and must wait until she comes of age to pursue any romantic feelings. Determined to make sure his predicted future comes true, Steven makes choices in the present which he believes will ensure his future comes true.\n\nPrimary filming for the movie was done across a number of locations in Iceland, which helped create the movie’s often wild and rugged atmosphere.\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\n\nBatman begins filmed in Iceland\n\nBatman Begins is Christopher Nolan’s epic reimagining of the origins of The Dark Knight. In the film we see the caped crusader’s journey in Tibet, and subsequent training with the League of Shadows. One of the most famous scenes in the film is the training scene, which shows Christian Bale and Liam Neeson engaged in a sword fight.\n\nMeant to be a reflection of Tibet’s cold and mountainous landscape, this scene was actually shot on the Svinafellsjokull Glacier in Vatnajokull National Park. The stars later revealed that while filming the scene, they could hear ice cracking beneath their feet – a job not for the faint-hearted!\n\nBeowulf & Grendel (2005)\n\nBeowulf and Grendel is set in Denmark during the 6th Century and is a story of revenge. After the death of his father by Danish King Hrothgar and his warriors, Grendel plots his revenge.\n\nReleased in 2005, the movie was filmed in numerous locations throughout Iceland. The harsh weather conditions lent an authentic atmosphere to the production. As scenes were filmed in severe weather conditions, which couldn’t have been recreated by special effects, actors gave genuine reactions and responses when faced with the weather.\n\nA Canadian and Icelandic co-production, the film was directed and produced by Sturla Gunnarsson, whose works include the Oscar-nominated documentary After the Axe.\n\nFlags of our Fathers (2006)\n\n‘Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima’, is an iconic photograph captured by Joe Rosenthal, which depicts the US flag being raised after the Battle of Iwo Jima. Initially published in the Sunday papers, the photo quickly earned a legendary status and was reprinted countless times over.\n\nThe novel Flags of our Fathers, which is based on the historic event, is the basis for Hollywood blockbuster. Directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, the film details the battle of Iwo Jima and the story of the six servicemen who raised the American flag after the island’s capture.\n\nIceland played a pivotal role in the production, as its black volcanic sand beaches stood in for the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. The Reykjanes Peninsula was one of the major filming locations, with Sandvik beach being used to shoot many of the battle scenes.\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima (2006)\n\nBilled as a sister film to Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima tells the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima, but from the Japanese point of view.\n\nShowing what life was like for Japanese soldiers, much of the scenes detail the caves and tunnels, which imperial soldiers fought and lived in.\n\nLike Flags of our Fathers, Sandvik beach was used as a stand in for Iwo Jima island. The black volcanic sand is a close replica of the volcanic sand found on Pacific islands.\n\nHostel Part II (2007)\n\nIt’s not often a sequel surpasses or equals its predecessor but Hostel Part ll is one of the few films to achieve this.\n\nDirected by Eli Roth, the plot follows three female American students, living in Rome, as they travel to Slovakia. It’s only after they’ve checked into their hostel that they rrealizethey’ve inadvertently checked into a house of horrors.\n\nThe majority of Hostel Part II was shot in Prague, but one scene was filmed in one special Icelandic location – The Blue Lagoon. Did you know that Hostel Part II was actually the first non-Icelandic film to be given permission to film at the Blue Lagoon? The scene shows one of the students going for a swim, before being chased by a group of men into a forest –creepy!\n\nStardust (2007)\n\nA magical fantasy film with a hint of romance, Stardust is a guilty pleasure and feel-good film all wrapped into one.\n\nThe fictional English village of Wall borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A magical stone wall keeps the two worlds apart but a tryst between a princess and village results in a love-child named Dunston. Left in the care of his mortal father, and now an adult, Dunston sees a star fall from the sky and lands beyond the wall.\n\nOur hero vows to retrieve the star for his love Victoria and uses a magical candle to transport him to the world, where adventure awaits. While principal photography took place in Pinewood Studios, some scenes were shot in Iceland, most notably on location in Stokksnes, south-east Iceland.\n\nThe peninsula is home to some of Iceland’s most breath-taking mountains, which can be seen in the background of some scenes.\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth (2008)\n\nFilmed in Iceland\n\nBased on the science fiction book of the same name, Journey to the Center of the Earth tells the story of a man determined to find out what happened to his missing brother. This leads him, along with his nephew and mountain guide, to discover a lost world in the center of the earth.\n\nStarring Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem, the film received mixed reviews upon its, release but is a great light-hearted action film – perfect for family movie nights.\n\nSnæfellsjökull Peninsula was immortalized in both the novel and film versions of the story and can be easily visited with Arctic Adventures.\n\nThe Tree of Life (2011)\n\nPart of Iceland’s great appeal to filmmakers is that much of the island remains relatively untouched by humans, so it looks as natural as anywhere you will find in the world.\n\nThat’s why Terence Mallick chose to film the “young Earth” scenes of his philosophical drama The Tree of Life at the lava fields of Krafla. These scenes showed the creation of the planet Earth, as well as the birth and evolution of life on our planet, right up to the emergence of the dinosaurs.\n\nUsing Icelandic regions to film recreations of a primordial Earth is very appropriate as the island itself is no more than 18 million years old. Geologically speaking, this makes Iceland a very young land mass.\n\nIronically though, because the island is so new, dinosaur fossils will never be found in Iceland as they are much older, dating back to more than 60 million years.\n\nWhile you won’t find dinosaur fossils in Iceland, there is still plenty to do on Arctic Adventures’ North Iceland Volcano Tour which explores the region near Krafla.\n\nNova Zembla (2011)\n\nReleased in 2011, Nova Zembla is a Dutch historical drama and has the prestige of being the first ever Dutch film to be presented in 3D.\n\nTwo explorers, on a quest to discover the Northeast Passage to the Indies, travel through ice seas before becoming stranded on Novaya Zemlya – an Arctic Archipelago. Using Iceland as a filming location allowed the film’s directors to easily mimic the arctic conditions of Russia.\n\nThe production team, filmed on a remote glacier and had to spend a week opening the roads before the 14-day shoot could begin\n\nPrometheus (2012)\n\nFilmed in Iceland\n\nMuch like The Tree of Life, Ridley Scott’s Prometheus also used Iceland to depict an ancient Earth. In the film’s visually-impressive opening, we are taken back in time to the seeding of life on Earth.\n\nA beautiful waterfall sets the scene as a mysterious figure sets the events of the film in motion. And what better waterfall to choose than the mighty Dettifoss, Europe’s most powerful waterfall?\n\nOblivion (2013)\n\nStarring none other than Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, Oblivion is a post-apocalyptic science-fiction film with major star-credit. Released in 2011 but set in 2077, Oblivion details Earth’s demise at the hands of extra-terrestrials. Ongoing wars have led humans to abandon Earth and move to Saturn’s moon, Titan.\n\nCast and crew spent 10 days filming in Iceland, where the country’s rugged terrain was used as a substitute for a post-apocalyptic east coast of America. Filmed during the summer months, when Iceland boasts 24-hour sunlight, the director sought to take advantage of the waning light at night time.\n\nKnown as the ‘magic hour’, this dim light gives off an eerie feel, making it a perfect addition to any sci-fi film. Reportedly the most difficult scene to shoot throughout the production was one where Harper pauses to admire the view and water a flower – a simple concept that actually required Cruise to sit next to an 800-foot (250 meters) drop at the top of Iceland’s Jarlhettur mountain.\n\nFans of the film can visit Dettifoss Waterfall, which was used as a filming location during production.\n\nStar Trek: Into Darkness (2013)\n\nThe twelfth instalment of the Star Trek franchise, Star Trek: Into Darkness sees the crew of the USS Enterprise return to earth after an act of terrorism destroys most of Starfleet’s command. Determined to capture the perpetrator and settle an old score, Captain Kirk leads his team on a dangerous mission to apprehend a one-man weapon of mass destruction.\n\nReynisfjara Beach was used a filming location for the movie. The area’s otherworldly appearance and volcanic black sand, made it an ideal stand-in for planets light years away.\n\nThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)\n\nFilmed in Iceland\n\nIceland has long been used as a stand in for post-apocalyptic worlds and a land before time, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of the few films that celebrates Iceland for being Iceland.\n\nDirected by and starring Ben Stiller, the filmmaker lets the viewer fall in love with Iceland and its beautiful scenery at the same time as the main character.\n\nScenes were shot in a multitude of locations around Iceland, with each corner of the island being represented. Seyðisfjörður, in the east fjords, was used as part of a thrilling and beautiful-shot skateboarding sequence and was also the scene of a volcanic eruption.\n\nThe Reykjanes peninsula also features in the film and is part of the coastline sequence where Mitty jumps into the North Atlantic Ocean. Stykkishólmur was used to represent Nuuk, Greenland and is where Walter meets a karaoke-loving helicopter pilot played by famed Icelandic actor, Olafur Darri.\n\nAs well as doubling as Greenland, Iceland was also used to represent Afghanistan. Vatnajökull National Park and the Falljökull glacier, were used to film the scene where Walter finds photo-journalist Sean O’Connell in remote Afghanistan.\n\nThor: The Dark World (2013)\n\nNo discussion of Iceland’s history would be complete without discussing ancient Norse mythology, and no discussion of Norse mythology would be complete without mentioning Thor, Iceland’s favourite hero.\n\nThe first Thor film (released in 2011) was a surprise hit for Marvel’s movie studio, so they released a sequel, The Dark World, in 2013. The Dark World brought Thor back to his roots, somewhat literally, with scenes shot around both Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik and the visually stunning Skógafoss Waterfall.\n\nOne particularly striking sequence depicts Thor and his brother Loki – another well-known God of Norse mythology – battling the sinister Dark Elves, including their champion, the mighty Kurse, in an epic showdown in an ash-ridden plane surrounded by volcanic smoke.\n\nWhile much of the smoke was added in with special effects, it gives us a great impression of what certain areas of Iceland are like during intense volcanic activity.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing the sights that inspired the stories of Thor and following in the Thunder God’s footsteps, be sure to take Arctic Adventures’ 2-Day Skógarfoss to Thorsmork Valley Trekking Tour.

These significant scenes were shot in the Strandir region of Northern Iceland’s Westfjords and show Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) attempting to recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa) into his world-saving super squad.\n\nAs a fellow volcanic islander – he’s from Hawaii – Jason Mamoa made himself at home and took a bath in one of the local geothermal pools.

During a Nordic scouting trip, the filmmakers were amazed by the “stark beauty” of the landscapes.\n\n“Iceland really felt mythical. It felt like nature was so awesome and powerful,” said Marc Smith, Director of Story, to Oh My Disney. Even before the film was released, the Disney Frozen 2 trailer provided some pretty obvious clues that it was inspired by Iceland. Audiences can see Elsa standing on a black sand beach, an iconic Icelandic highlight. In an interview director, Chris Buck confirmed that the coal-colored beach was in fact, inspired by Djúpalónssandur Beach.\n\nThe scenery wasn’t the only role Iceland played in the film. Founded by Scandinavian settlers, their folklore inspired the characters. In one scene, Elsa must battle a Nokk, or Nykur in Icelandic, a water spirit that takes the shape of a horse.

The film follows aspiring Icelandic singers Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) who are given the opportunity to represent their country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The musical duo, who goes by the name Fire Saga, are proud Icelanders who hail from the fishing village of Húsavík. The small town, with just a population of above 2,000, was historically a fishing village and then became a popular tourist stop on self-drive tours for its whale-watching opportunities and geothermal baths.\n\nHúsavík was excited to welcome the film crews and the Icelandic government even paid close to a million dollars, as a part of the country's movie production incentives. Most of the film shots took place in the charming Húsavík Harbor, however as the son of a fisherman Ferrell's character did take to the sea. The crew filmed in Skjálfandi Bay and Ferrell said the boat was tossed around in the rough waves. There are many cultural references in the movie that delighted Icelanders. In many scenes you see Sigrit ask the elves or “hidden people” (huldufólk) of Icelandic folklore to help them win the contest, and locals now plan to build a replica of the elf house. Fans who visit the town can also visit Jaja Ding Dong-bar, an outdoor pop-up bar inspired by the local pub in the film.\n\nKatla (2021)\n\nKatla series follows the people of a small town Vik in the vicinity of a dormant volcano that suddenly erupts and unleashes an unseen terror. We visit Vik, a small town near volcano Katla, a year after its last eruption. Since the eruption, the heat from the volcano has melted the ice caps. Vik's people are disturbed by the events and begin evacuating the town in anticipation of a bigger disaster.\n\nVík has a population of just 300 people and there are no towns or settlements for at least 50km in each direction. The settlement dates back to the ninth century, but it wasn’t until 1890 that traders settled permanently in the region.\n\nThe town is bordered by the real-life Katla volcano to the north, while the picturesque Víkurkirkja Church is the assembly point in case of a sudden eruption or flood. Enjoy the ultimate volcano experience with our incredible Katla Ice Cave tour.\n\nFilming also took place at Kormákur’s own RVK Studios production facilities on the outskirts of Reykjavík.\n\nCheck out Arctic Adventures’ tours and combine adventure activities with some of your favourite film locations."
