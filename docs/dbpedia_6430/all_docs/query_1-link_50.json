        "text": "Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\n2024 Emmy Predictions:\n\nOutstanding Drama Series\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated Aug. 5, 2024): The Japanese epic “Shōgun” garnered the most nominations of the year and is the undisputed frontrunner to win the first drama series statuette for FX Networks. However, it’s not necessarily a done deal.\n\nIn its final season, Netflix’s monarchy drama “The Crown” has won this category before and could garner many sympathy votes for its overall achievements. While many assume the mixed reviews for the last season will hold it back (and they’re right to a certain extent), it’s worth considering the precedent set by Season 8 of “Game of Thrones.” Despite being universally panned for its quality and unsatisfying conclusion, it managed to beat universally beloved fellow nominees such as “Ozark,” “Pose,” and “Succession.” Don’t underestimate the power of “prestige” and an international voting body that might be inclined to show it some love. However, that support could manifest in other categories, such as supporting drama actor for Jonathan Pryce or even writing or directing.\n\n“Shōgun” remains the frontrunner for the moment, but the outcome is far from certain.\n\nThe Creative Arts and Governors Gala ceremonies will occur over two nights on Sept. 7-8. The 76th Primetime Emmy Awards will air on ABC on Sunday, Sept. 15."
