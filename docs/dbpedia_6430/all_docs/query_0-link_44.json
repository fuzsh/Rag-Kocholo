        "text": "Starring: Shunsuke Michieda, Riko Fukomoto, Ren Meguro\n\nGenre: Based on a manga, romance, comedy\n\nWhat It’s About: For longer than he'd care to admit, Sota Aoki (Shunsuke Michieda) has had a crush on his classmate Mio Hashimoto (Riko Fukumoto). Sitting next to her in class every day, Aoki wishes he could find a way to tell her how he feels but something keeps holding him back. Despite being unable to confess his feelings, he’s at least able to talk to her about other, simpler things. He’s even occasionally borrowed school supplies from her, which is why he didn’t think twice about asking to borrow an eraser from her when he found himself needing one during class one day.\n\nSota Aoki (Shunsuke Michieda) has had a crush on his classmate Mio Hashimoto (Riko Fukumoto) for as long as he can remember, but confessing has never seemed possible. Still, he sits next to her in class every day, so he didn’t think much of asking to borrow an eraser from her during class one day. Little did Aoki know that one simple eraser would change his life forever.\n\nAoki is devastated to find that Hashimoto had written the name \"Ida-kun\" on the eraser he’d borrowed. Realizing she’s interested in someone else, Aoki is so flustered that he drops the eraser. In a shocking twist, the very same Kousuke Ida (Ren Meguro) picks up the eraser and hands it back to Aoki, but not without first noticing his name on the eraser.\n\nNow Ida is convinced that Aoki has a crush on him and Aoki is convinced that Hashimoto just wants to be friends, Aoki has no idea what to do next. Can he clear up the misunderstanding with Ida, or will fate take the wheel?\n\nAdapted from the manga of the same name written by Wataru Hinekure, My Love Mix-Up! is a 2021 romantic comedy drama directed by Shogo Kusano and Tadaaki Horai.\n\nStarring: Park Bo Young, Seo In Guk, Lee Soo Hyuk\n\nGenre: Romance, supernatural, fantasy\n\nWhat It’s About: Tak Dong Kyung (Park Bo Young) has seen better days. Her days are long and consumed by her job as a webcomic editor. She lost her parents a few years ago in an accident, and she finds out that her boyfriend is cheating. But that’s not all–she’s also suffering from a terminal brain tumor. Determined to put an end to her misery, one night, she drunkenly shouts to the heavens wishing for the world to be doomed.\n\nHer call summons Myeol Mang (Seo In Guk), a mysterious entity whose name means \"Doom\". He offers to make her wish come true if she is willing to pay the ultimate price and Dong Kyung agrees. Now, she has 100 days to live her life to the fullest before the grim reaper comes to take her soul. However, things are never as simple as they seem. Myeol Mang slowly finds himself growing fonder of this perplexing human woman and the boundaries between the mortal and immortal realms become increasingly unclear.\n\nStarring: Han Hyo Joo, Park Hyung Sik\n\nGenre: Idol Drama, fantasy, action\n\nWhat it’s about: Officer Yoon Sae Bom (Han Hyo Joo) has been dreaming of the day that she could finally settle into her brand new high rise apartment, so when construction is finalized, she’s thrilled. Even better, her long-time friend and fellow officer, Detective Jung Yi Hyun (Park Hyung Sik) is moving into the building as well. Sae Bom is sure that life in this new home will make her happier than ever. Unfortunately, that happiness doesn’t last long.\n\nA new infectious disease (eek) slowly begins to spread throughout the building while the new residents find themselves the object of terror and a source of city-wide panic. With no other way of containing the disease, the building and everyone who lives there is sealed off from the outside world. As the world around them struggles to make sense of what is quickly morphing into a full-on apocalypse, the uninfected residents' only chance of survival rests solely in their own hands.\n\nConfused, isolated, and terrified, the residents have no choice but to find a way to overcome their distrust of each other, as it’s their only hope of surviving this living nightmare. But how can they do that when it seems at least one of them holds the secrets that could either save or destroy them all?\n\nStarring: Gong Yoo, Kim Go-eun, Lee Dong-wook, Yoo In-na, and Yook Sung-jae\n\nGenre: Fantasy, romance, drama, historical\n\nWhat it's about: There's a good chance that if you're a K-drama fan, then you've watched (or at least heard of) Guardian before, but if you haven't yet, then this is your chance to do so. Also known as Goblin, the show centers on Kim Shin (Gong Yoo), a Goryeo dynasty general who is wrongfully killed and sentenced to live forever as a Goblin. The only way he can truly be freed from his immortal coil is to have the sword in the center of his chest removed, but the only person who can remove it from his chest is his bride. Enter Ji Eun-tak (Kim Go-eun), a sweet-as-can-be high schooler who has some special powers of her own. Then toss in a socially awkward grim reaper (Lee Dong-wook); a cuddly, rich heir as the Goblin's assistant (Yook Sung-jae); and a cheeky restaurant owner (Yoo In-na), and the result is a charming, emotional drama you'll find yourself rewatching over and over again."
