Rani is an intelligent A-Level student who had secured a full scholarship to study at Oxford University when she was caught shoplifting and sentenced with a community service order. That's where she met Ben and fell in love, helping him out of a dangerous situation involving some stolen drug money.\n\nHowever, when it came time for them to start a new life in Weston-super-Mare, she ran out on him, having acquired a taste for a thrill-seeking life of crime.\n\nWhat else has Rhianne Barreto been in? Barreto appeared opposite Keeley Hawes in ITV's hard-hitting factual drama Honour in 2020. She has also appeared in Amazon Prime Video's Hanna and early lockdown experiment Isolation Stories. More recently, she co-starred in Paramount Plus thriller No Escape, which was a very good show – but alas, has since been pulled from the service.\n\nJessica Gunning plays Diane\n\nWho is Diane? Diane initially met the so-called 'outlaws' as their probation officer, who supervised the group as they put in their community service hours and attempted (unsuccessfully) to enforce some very strict rules. Since then, she has become a police community support officer and remains determined to become an ace detective.\n\nHowever, she does have a tendency to miss important things that are going on right under her nose.\n\nWhat else has Jessica Gunning been in? The actor gained international recognition for her recent performance as Martha in Richard Gadd's hard-hitting comedy-drama Baby Reindeer. Prior to that, she was known for roles in David Mitchell and Robert Webb's sitcom Back, Prime Suspect 1973, Fortitude, Inside No. 9 and Law & Order: UK.\n\nGamba Cole plays Ben\n\nWho is Ben? Ben is a member of the community service group. For much of season 1, he goes by the name of Christian, as he is secretly completing hours on behalf of an associate. When this scheme is discovered, he is slapped with his own sentence for impersonating someone.\n\nThe experience is made a little more tolerable by his feelings for Rani, with whom he strikes up a friendship that soon blossoms into romance. However, her appetite for dangerous situations troubles him.\n\nWhat else has Gamba Cole been in? Cole's previous projects include Amazon Prime Video's streaming remake of Hanna, Netflix's acclaimed horror flick His House, and Sky fantasy series A Discovery of Witches. Most recently, he played Ty in BBC One's Death in Paradise and Gregory in Lenny Henry's Three Little Birds.\n\nStephen Merchant plays Greg\n\nWho is Greg? Greg is a lawyer who is part of Rani's group of outlaws. He is not very respected or accomplished at his law firm, frequently being the subject of ridicule by his unkind colleagues. However, he does gain some clout after wealthy socialite (and fellow community service worker) Lady Gabby becomes his client.\n\nIn season 3, he has gone independent and is representing her in a legal case against her cold, calculating father.\n\nWhat else has Stephen Merchant been in? Merchant rose to fame for his collaborations with former writing partner Ricky Gervais, with whom he co-created The Office, Extras and Life's Too Short. Since they went their separate ways, he has had starring roles in HBO's Hello Ladies, Marvel's Logan and awards contender Jojo Rabbit.\n\nDarren Boyd plays John\n\nWho is John? John is an irritable man who once ran a business in partnership with his nasty father, but has become an Uber driver since that relationship thoroughly soured. He is known for his generally right-wing, socially conservative views and a temper that can occasionally flare up, but nevertheless has struck up an unlikely friendship with left-wing activist Myrna.\n\nWhat else has Darren Boyd been in? Boyd is a familiar face on British television, having previously starred in several projects for Sky, including Spy, Fortitude and Stan Lee's Lucky Man. More recently, he has appeared in Killing Eve and The Salisbury Poisonings, while his big screen work includes Bridget Jones's Baby and The Personal History of David Copperfield.\n\nHe currently stars in Apple TV+ comedy-drama Trying.\n\nClare Perkins plays Myrna\n\nWho is Myrna? Myrna is another member of the community service group. She has left-wing political values and often clashes with John, whose own beliefs tend to be the opposite, but they maintain a form of camaraderie anyway. Myrna is haunted by an act of protest she carried out in the 1980s, which inadvertently caused the death of a policeman.\n\nWhat else has Clare Perkins been in? Perkins is known for her soap opera work, having played Denise Boulter in Channel 5's Family Affairs and Ava Hartman in BBC One's EastEnders. She was recently seen in Prime Video's fantasy drama The Wheel of Time and Apple TV+ thriller Suspicion, while she has also voiced Denise Metcalf in BBC Radio 4's The Archers.\n\nEleanor Tomlinson plays Gabby\n\nWho is Gabby? Gabby is the wild daughter of a British earl, who has become a tabloid sensation for her appearances on reality television shows and frequent scandals, the latest of which has landed her in this community service programme.\n\nFortunately, by the time of season 3, she is recovering from various addictions and looking to make a fresh start, but to do so she needs to secure a promised inheritance from her father.\n\nWhat else has Eleanor Tomlinson been in? Tomlinson is best known for playing Demelza in BBC One's recent Poldark adaptation, where she starred opposite Aidan Turner. Since then, she appeared in short-lived HBO drama The Nevers and sci-fi series Intergalactic, as well as period drama A Small Light, erotic thriller The Couple Next Door and emotional romance One Day.\n\nChristopher Walken plays Frank\n\nWho is Frank? Frank is a veteran criminal who has been in and out of the prison system for much of his life, which has led to estrangement from his daughter, Margaret, and grandson, Tom. He was on a path to redemption in their eyes, but sadly, due to a misunderstanding, was asked to leave them alone in season 2. Frank has respected their wishes and returned to the USA.\n\nWhat else has Christopher Walken been in?

Christian was formerly a drug dealer working for The Dean. He coerced Ben into taking on his community service hours in season 1, threatening to recruit his younger sister if he refused to do so. Suffice to say, the two are now rivals.\n\nWhat else has Charles Babalola been in? Babalola's previous projects include BBC One's Silent Witness and ITV's Bancroft and Broadchurch.\n\nClaes Bang plays The Dean\n\nWho is The Dean? Dean is a dangerous and powerful London crime boss, who the group had the misfortune of crossing paths with in season 1. They stole a huge amount of money owed to him, which put them firmly on his radar. But in season 2, they managed to get him arrested by planting drugs in his car. Now, he's on trial and their deception is under intense scrutiny.\n\nWhat else has Claes Bang been in? The Danish actor will be best known to British viewers for playing the eponymous role of Dracula in Steven Moffat's three-part adaptation.

The Earl is Gabby's emotionally unavailable, cold-hearted father. He became her sole guardian after her mother died at a young age, but showed little sympathy for her struggles with addiction and has seemingly spent much of her inheritance.\n\nWhat else has Richard E Grant been in? Grant's debut film performance in Withnail and I proved a star-making turn. Recently, he joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Tom Hiddleston's mega-hit Disney Plus series Loki, playing an older version of the title character.\n\nOn the big screen, he is known for Logan, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Can You Ever Forgive Me, the last of which earned him an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIan McElhinney plays John Snr\n\nWho is John Snr?
