        "text": "Kim Kardashian has been teasing that she’ll be practicing law, and while everybody thought her new career would be shown on a TV show, it’s a bit surprising to learn that it will be on a fictional one. Ryan Murphy, executive producer of American Horror Story, is creating a new show for Hulu featuring Kardashian as a lawyer, per Deadline. Here’s everything we know about All’s Fair, including a major influx of Ryan Murphy regulars to the cast.\n\nSingle female lawyer, fighting for her clients\n\nAll’s Fair will be Murphy’s first show since leaving Netflix for 20th Television, which is owned by Disney. The show, written by Jon Robin Baitz (Feud: Capote vs. the Swans), will star Kardashian as a successful L.A. divorce attorney in an all-female practice. The Hollywood Reporter describes it as a “sexy procedural.” Probably the sexiest procedural since Murphy’s Nip/Tuck, with a Kim as lawyer wearing sexy miniskirts and being self-reliant. So, basically the Futurama parody of Ally McBeal. With both American Horror Story: Delicate and the recently announced film The Fifth Wheel, Kardashian’s hard pivot into acting is moving right along. And if All’s Fair doesn’t hit the way Hulu wants it to, we have a few alts:\n\n— Blonde Ambition\n\n— Nobody (But This One Lawyer) Wants to Work Anymore\n\n— Brand Expansion: The Series\n\n— Run Right Back to Me\n\nWho are Kim K.’s partners-in-law?\n\nPer THR, Glenn Close will play a partner in Kardashian’s all-women LA law firm. Kardashian will be the law firm’s owner, and thus technically this diva’s boss. Only in LA. It’s a return to legal drama for Damages star Close. Remember Damages? Great show. Both women serve as executive producers, alongside Murphy, Jon Robin Baitz, and Joe Baken.\n\nHalle Berry was originally slated to play another partner in Kim’s law firm, but has since left the project (per Deadline). This news came only a week after her spot on the show was announced.\n\nAny Ryan Murphy regulars coming along?"
