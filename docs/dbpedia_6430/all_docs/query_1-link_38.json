        "text": "The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Pt. 1\n\nRachel and Ross arrive at the hospital; she's upset to get a semi-private room. Monica and Chandler decide to have a baby and right away. Mrs. Geller turns up to give Ross her mother's engagement ring; she wants Ross to marry Rachel. Joey can't understand why somebody wouldn't want to be married to Rachel. Phoebe meets a handsome stranger, but can't quite get his room number, so she gets Dr. Drake Ramoray to get it. She also gets him to find out some personal info from the guy. As Rachel waits for her own baby, various other pregnant women come and go, until Janice shows up.\n\nTalk Show\n\nAfter meeting a talk-show host at a boxing after-party in L.A., Vince agrees to appear on his show--despite a long-standing rift between the host and Drama. Eric and Kristen share a long goodbye; Ari puts the full-court press on a famous comic; and Luke Wilson tells Turtle how to score a free home-theater system for Vince.\n\nAquamansion\n\nWhen Vince falls for a house outside his price range, he suddenly sees the value of doing a franchise film. Meanwhile, the boys get psyched for a slumber party at the Mansion--but Drama's been 'banned for life' by Hef; Eric pressures Ari to prove himself as a deal-maker; and Turtle puts his faith in big-ticket sleepwear.\n\nBoys Are Back in Town\n\nThe boys are back in town...and Ari, eager for a commercial project, pushes 'Aquaman'--but Vince isn't buying; Eric has an official title now, but his status is questioned when he has to make a 'sex date' with Kristen; Drama's agent may be moving up, but his head shots are stuck in the past; and Turtle, cranky about his new job, takes multi-tasking to a chaotic level.\n\nMy Maserati Does 185\n\nVince agrees to a starlet's pet project; Eric reluctantly lets a Perfect Ten model 'take care of him' at a beach party, where Turtle misrepresents his position to get a girl; Drama develops calf envy; and Ari gets steamed up convincing the boys to read the 'Aquaman' script."
