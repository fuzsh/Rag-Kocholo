        "text": "The 100-mile White Rim Road loops around and below the Island in the Sky mesa top and provides expansive views of the surrounding area. Four-wheel-drive trips usually take two to three days, and mountain bike trips usually take three to four days.\n\nUnder favorable weather conditions, the White Rim Road is moderately difficult for high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles. The steep, exposed sections of the Shafer Trail, Lathrop Canyon Road, Murphy Hogback, Hardscrabble Hill, and the Mineral Bottom switchbacks make the White Rim loop a challenging mountain bike ride, and require extreme caution for both vehicles and bikes during periods of inclement weather. During high water conditions on the Green River, sections of road on the west side can flood, making a complete loop impossible. Check current road conditions.\n\nThings to Know\n\nFour-wheel-drive vehicles, motorbikes, and bicycles (including e-bikes) are allowed on the White Rim Road.\n\nATVs, UTVs, and OHVs are not permitted.\n\nGenerators are not allowed.\n\nAll vehicles and bikes must remain on designated roads.\n\nYour vehicle must have high-clearance, four-wheel drive (low range) on the White Rim Road.\n\nMaximum recommended vehicle dimensions are 8 feet wide and 9.5 feet tall for the White Rim Road.\n\nAll vehicles and motorbikes must be registered and operated by a licensed driver. Motorbikes must be equipped and licensed for interstate travel.\n\nPets are not permitted, even in vehicles.\n\nFires are not permitted.\n\nPlease ensure all riders possess adequate levels of physical fitness prior to all trips, and are experienced enough to mitigate potential challenges and safety issues should they arise.\n\nPermits\n\nAll trips along the White Rim require a permit.\n\nOvernight Permits\n\nAn overnight permit is required for all overnight trips along the White Rim.\n\nIn spring and fall, demand for overnight permits frequently exceeds the number available. If you plan to visit Canyonlands during these seasons, you should make reservations well in advance.\n\nDay-Use Permits\n\nAll vehicles, motorbikes, and bicyclists must have a day-use permit for single day trips on the White Rim. Overnight trips do not need an additional day-use permit.\n\nIf your trip plan does not pass by a visitor center or requires an early start (before normal business hours), you must obtain a day-use permit online the day before.\n\nProtect Your Park, Protect Yourself\n\nDrive Carefully!\n\nA high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicle (low range) is required for the White Rim Road. Towing charges are very expensive. People caught in the backcountry with disabled vehicles can expect towing fees in excess of $1,000.\n\nCome Prepared.\n\nThe White Rim Road has long rocky stretches, deep sand, and little shade. Bring at least 1 gallon (4 L) of water per person, per day â€” more if you'll be active. Plan for a minimum of 10-12 hours of driving or cycling.\n\nKeep off the Arches.\n\nTo promote visitor safety and the opportunity to view natural features undisturbed, climbing, scrambling, walking or standing upon, or rappelling off any arch is prohibited in the park."
