        "text": "If you would have told me all the way back in 2012 that Kim Kardashian would be starring in her own Ryan Murphy series, I would have taken a long beat and then said, “Yeah, that tracks.” After making a splash with her (actually good) performance as publicist Siobhan in American Horror Story: Delicate, Kim Kardashian is now set to helm a series of her own — and she'll be playing a role that hits pretty close to home.\n\nAs noted by Variety, Kardashian and Murphy had so much fun together on AHS that they're coming back for more. In the new drama series, which was picked up by Hulu, Kardashian will play “a successful divorce lawyer who leads an all-female law firm in Los Angeles\" — a perfect fit for the reality star and entrepreneur, who is currently studying to take the bar exam in her real life.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the series will be “a high-end, glossy and sexy adult procedural.” It's the first project for Murphy under his new deal with Disney; Murphy, Kardashian, and Kris Jenner are all on board to produce the show together.\n\nThose acting lessons must have paid off, because the upcoming legal drama series isn't the only project the endlessly busy Kardashian has in the works. She's also set to star in an upcoming Netflix comedy called Fifth Wheel, which Deadline reports will have an all-female ensemble cast.\n\n“It’s really fun to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new and grow. I’m so excited for the experience,\" Kardashian previously shared of her decision to venture into the acting world. \"It’s a challenge. I like to challenge myself.”"
