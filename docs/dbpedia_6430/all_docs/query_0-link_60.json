        "text": "Alongside plenty of returning stars from season 1, the second season of The Wheel of Time also welcomes a number of new faces, including Maja Simonsen, Ragga Ragnars, Jay Duffy and Rima Te Wiata.\n\nThere has also been one notable change to The Wheel of Time season 2 cast, with Mat Cauthon actor Barney Harris being swapped out for Dónal Finn – no official reason has been given for the decision.\n\nIf you're looking for a refresher before the latest episodes drop, read on for an introduction to the cast and characters of The Wheel of Time on Prime Video.\n\nMore like this\n\nWho's in the cast of The Wheel of Time season 2?\n\nRosamund Pike plays Moiraine\n\nWho is Moiraine? Moiraine is a member of the Aes Sedai, an organisation comprised of women capable of wielding magic. She is tasked with seeking out the reincarnation of the Dragon, an individual who will either save or destroy the world – her influence could be the factor that sways it one way or the other. No pressure. Things are particularly tough for Moiraine in season 2, as she has been cut off from her magical powers.\n\nWhat else has Rosamund Pike been in? Pike received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in David Fincher's Gone Girl adaptation. More recently, she drew further acclaim for her lead roles in biopic A Private War and thriller I Care A Lot.\n\nDaniel Henney plays al'Lan Mandragoran\n\nWho is al'Lan Mandragoran?

I think it’s a testament to this character and how great the character of Mat is that it really feels seamless between the two actors.”\n\nFinn's past credits include Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore and BBC One's SAS: Rogue Heroes.\n\nSophie Okonedo plays Siuan Sanche\n\nWho is Siuan Sanche?

This is the first English-language screen role for the Dutch actor.\n\nMadeleine Madden plays Egwene al'Vere\n\nWho is Egwene al'Vere?
