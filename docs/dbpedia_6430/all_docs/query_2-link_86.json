        "text": "Window Tint Laws By State\n\nAnyone who has looked into automotive window tint laws knows it’s a complicated affair. Tint laws vary by state and can be significantly different from one state to the next. These laws are also updated from time to time, and the wording can sometimes leave things open for interpretation. As you can guess, here at Rvinyl, we’re big fans of tinted automotive windows. Automotive tinting is our business, after all! We love the look of a car with the right tint accenting the design and finish.\n\nTo help you wade through the rules and find the window tint laws for your state, we’ve put together this article. You’ll see that with our help, you can easily determine the allowable tint level for your vehicle and avoid a hassle with law enforcement or registration officials in the future.\n\n51 Different States, 51 Different Tint Laws\n\nIt probably comes as no surprise to you that, when it comes to laws on window tinting, state governments make things as complicated as possible! Not known for their logic or simplicity, each state applies their own rules to automotive window tints. While this isn’t a major problem when you stay put in your home state, those who travel a lot, purchase out-of-state vehicles or move around the country can find the various tint laws by state confusing.\n\nThankfully there are a few states that apply the same rules. But there are many different points to consider with respect to window tint laws:\n\nVLT% is the measurement used to assess automotive window tints, which stands for visible light transmission. This is the percent of visible light that gets through either the film — film VLT% — or window — glass plus film net VLT%.\n\nFront side window tint level: This is the amount of tint (VLT%) you’re allowed on your driver and front passenger windows. This is frequently a higher value than for the rear, which allows the driver of the vehicle to be seen from outside.\n\nRear side window tint level: This is the amount of tint (VLT%) you’re allowed on your rear side windows. This value is sometimes different for passenger cars and multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs).\n\nRear window tint level: This is the amount of tint (VLT%) you’re allowed on your rear window. This value is typically the same as for the rear side windows, but some states are more restrictive.\n\nWindshield: Your windshield cannot be tinted in any state, but some states allow you to add a sticker to the top of the windshield, usually in the area of the manufacturer’s sun shield.\n\nColor: The state laws on tint color vary from no restrictions at all to restrictions on the use of certain colors or reflective/mirrored finishes.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of things to consider. But we don’t want to take all the fun out of tinting your windows. Adding a custom tint is a great way to enhance the look, comfort and security of your vehicle. It’s just important to be aware of all of the rules before you start to make sure that once you install your automotive tint, no one’s going to be bothering you to remove it.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nWith all the criteria we mentioned above, it’s not easy to rank the different window tint laws by state. It all depends on the amount of tint and the windows you want to apply it to. We’ve put together a general list of those states that offer what we consider to be the laxest tint laws, the slightly more restrictive laws and the ones that are the tightest.\n\nOnce you see where your state lies, you can look at the specific details and find the perfect Rvinyl tint solution for your ride. Don’t worry: We have all different colors and grades of tint, so no matter where you live, you can find a legal tint.\n\nThe Good\n\nSome of the more forgiving states when it comes to window tint laws include Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming. This is especially true for the front driver and passenger windows, where you’re allowed a low VLT% — around 30%. Depending on the rear side, rear and color/reflectiveness requirements, the ranking of these “good” tint states gets a bit jumbled, but Montana really stands out with low VLT% requirements for all windows and few other restrictions on films. If you’re in Montana, you can stop reading now and head on through to our online catalog and place your order! The rest of you might want to keep reading, however.\n\nThankfully, the bulk of the states fall more or less into this category. We would also include: Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.\n\nAs we said before, it’s possible to find your automotive tint even if you’re in some of the “bad” states, but you’ll want to pay close attention to the details for the individual windows — front side, rear side and rear — because the following states have slightly stricter window tint laws.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIt’s not really fair to call these states “bad.” States have put restrictions on window tints in place for a reason. The ultimate goal is to ensure that law enforcement officials can see the driver and occupants of a car in traffic situations. While that can seem like a pain, we all know the rules are in place for the common good, so here at Rvinyl, we offer many different tints so every vehicle owner in every state can find a film that looks good, provides the privacy and protection you want and is allowed by the law. Some of the “pickier” states — especially in terms of front and rear VLT% — are:\n\nAlabama: Despite all the sun Alabama receives, all of your windows have to allow at least 32% light transmission.\n\nHawaii: Another sunny state that requires around 1/3 of light to get through, Hawaii is a bit less restrictive when it comes to MPVs.\n\nKansas: At least Kansas makes it easy: 35% VLT across the board, sides and back, for passenger cars and MPVs.\n\nVirginia: With a 50% VLT rating for the front side windows, car owners in Virginia have to be careful to resist the urge to go for our darker tints.\n\nWisconsin: Wisconsin is as restrictive as Virginia for passenger cars and even more restrictive for MPVs.\n\nA few other states that you need to pay close attention to as you’re choosing your tint film are Alaska, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Utah. They’re not all “bad” on all points, but they are fairly restrictive when it comes to the VLT% on the front side windows, which for many drivers is the most important window to tint.\n\nIt is important to remind you that these states’ laws with respect to automotive window tint only apply to on-road vehicles. If your vehicle isn’t registered for use on public roads — such as a race or hobby car — these rules likely don’t apply. Some states will have other rules that apply to these vehicles, but they’re generally much less restrictive.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nNow to the tricky tint law states. We put California on this list because of the high 70% VLT number required for the front side windows. There may not be any VLT% requirements for the other windows, which is nice, but it means you will need to apply different tints front and back. Thankfully, our Rvinyl window tint is available in different roll sizes, so even if you’re a California vehicle owner, you can do a custom DIY tint job at a great price. Delaware has virtually the same restrictions as California, but with some slight differences when it comes to reflectivity.\n\nNew York and Rhode Island have much the same tint laws, with a VLT% of 70 front and back. These states may not see as much sun as some of the southern states, but when you’re looking for a cool style and a bit of privacy, you will still want to get the maximum tint allowable. Thankfully, New York has no banned colors of tint, and Rhode Island is not very particular about either color or reflective coatings, so you can still be creative and get an awesome custom look in your car, truck, van or SUV.\n\nPerhaps the most confusing — or specific — states are Illinois and Texas. Not content to follow the standard listings of VLT% for the front side, rear side and rear windows that all of the other states apply, both states went to the effort of creating specific addendums that outline their unique take on auto tint laws. Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, D.C. all offer fairly strict rules on at least one of the window tint criteria, and therefore they also rank on our automotive tint “naughty list!” If you live in these states, it’s worth looking up and reading the wording to make sure the tint you’re choosing meets the requirements. You’ll still be able to tint your windows, but you’ll have to pay attention to the type of vehicle you have and the different windows you’re tinting.\n\nWindow Tint Law Exceptions\n\nOf course, as with most laws, there are exceptions. Most states make provisions for medical reasons. Certain illnesses and conditions make people sensitive to light, and the laws have made provisions for these cases. You usually need to carry a doctor’s note with you in your car, but this allows you to apply a darker tint than the state normally allows. If you have light sensitivity issues, contact your doctor and see how they can help you with the necessary diagnosis and documentation.\n\nTint Law Interpretation\n\nEven if most of the rules for state window tint seem straightforward, with VLT% and size in inches for front windshield stickers, some states use slightly ambiguous terms that leave some room for law enforcement and licencing agencies to interpret. For example, terms like “non-reflective” or “non-excessive” are impossible to measure and won’t have the same meaning for every person. Will a bright red sports car with a certain tint be treated the same as a family minivan with the same tint? It’s important to choose the tint you want, but when possible, staying on the safe side and picking a slightly lighter tint can save you headaches in the future.\n\nOne important note is that most vehicles have a certain amount of light transmission blockage straight from the factory, which measures between 70-80%. This needs to be considered when you’re adding custom tint, so that you stay within the legal limits.\n\nFor example, if you were to check the percentage of VLT on a 2005 Honda Accord it would be around 75% from the factory. Adding tint would increase this further, so you need to assess the final result (original + added VLT %) to determine if you are within the legal limits.\n\nIf you’re the owner of an SUV or minivan, know that these often have a 20-35% VLT on the side rear windows, but nothing on the front. Many customers opt for our 20-35% VLT for the front windows to create a clean, homogenous look for their whole vehicle.\n\nWhy Care About Tint Laws?\n\nYou might say “I don’t care,” and install the tint you want. As much as we like the look of an extremely dark tint, we want to make sure you’re aware of the risks. It is useful for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians to be able to see the driver of a car, to make eye contact and see which way they are looking. It is also the law that law enforcement be able to identify at minimum the driver in a vehicle. We didn’t invent the rules, and we aren’t responsible for enforcing them, but we want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the right decision.\n\nWant to learn more about the specific tint laws and regulations for your state?
