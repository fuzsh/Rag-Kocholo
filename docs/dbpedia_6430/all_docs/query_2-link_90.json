A commitment to freedom of mobility and public safety has guided AAA in its involvement in all issues relate to transportation.\n\nThis timeline, prepared by the AAA Research Library, is an ongoing enterprise that reflects milestones in American history and AAA contributions.\n\nEntries on the timeline have been authenticated. If this information is used in publications, we ask that careful attention is paid to wording to avoid any misinterpretations."
