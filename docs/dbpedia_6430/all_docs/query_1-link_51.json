        "text": "I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and spent much of my high school years as a professional actor. I then attended Vassar College (Go Brewers) and NYU School of Law (Go Violets) for law school. I have practiced in Texas, California and New York, primarily handling litigation matters, but also handling transactional, intellectual property and bankruptcy matters.\n\nI love spending time with my amazing daughter and when I can, enjoy mysteries and dry British comedy, solving puzzles, cooking and swimming. I have even been known to play a hand or two of poker.\n\n“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\n\n—George Santanya;\n\n“Those who understand history are condemned to watch other idiots repeat it.”\n\n—Peter Lamborn Wilson"
