        "text": "Jonathan (Romesh Ranganathan) is back and heâs reinvented himself. He may have a new body, a new hobby, and a lot of lycra, but heâs still stuck avoiding conflict and all the mess that causes. Jonathan is determined to win back his ex-partner Claire (Jessica Knappett) and rebuild his family and make son, Spencer (Kieran Logendra) happy. However, any chance of their love rekindling is complicated by new love interests Brett (Matthew Lewis) and Megan (Aisling Bea). Meanwhile, Jonathanâs sister, Dan (Mandeep Dhillon) and her wife Courtney (Lisa McGrillis) are expecting a baby and feel anything but ready.\n\nAvoidance (6 x 30) is a Ranga Bee production for BBC One and BBC iPlayer. It was commissioned by Jon Petrie, Director of BBC Comedy. It was created by Romesh Ranganathan and Benjamin Green, who also directs. The series is written by Romesh Ranganathan, Benjamin Green and Jessica Knappett. The producer is Andrew Harvey and the Executive Producers are Michelle Farr-Scott, Romesh Ranganathan, Benjamin Green. The BBC Commissioning Editor is Tanya Qureshi. Series one and two of Avoidance are distributed internationally by BBC Studios.\n\nEpisode 1 will air on Friday 5 April at 9.30pm on BBC One, all six episodes will be available as a boxset on BBC iPlayer.\n\nGC2\n\nInterviews with the cast\n\nRomesh Ranganathan\n\nCo-creator, writer, and Executive Producer plays Jonathan\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Avoidance?\n\nThe new series of Avoidance takes place a year after the end of the first series. At the end of the last series Jonathan told Claire he didnât want to get back together and we find him a year later regretting his decision. He has made some changes to his life, heâs tried to improve himself so I guess you could say heâs had a glow up! The other big thing thatâs happened is that Courtney and Dan are expecting a baby â so those are the two big things to expect. Spencer is very much, in keeping with Avoidance, the most settled and stable character in the whole thing.\n\nI think with series 2 the big change, apart from the pregnancy, is that Jonathan thinks he has made improvements â he is still the avoidant character that he always was but heâs tried to make changes and improve himself. Whether those improvements have made any real difference remains a source of debate between Jonathan and the other characters in the show!\n\nHow was filming with the cast for series 2? How was it working with the new cast members?\n\nIt was an amazing experience being back with the cast for series 2. In some way itâs easier to write series 2, because you know the characters so well, but in some ways itâs trickier because you want to push the series on a bit as youâre not writing introductions for the characters and setting them up, youâre pushing them to new places and you want to give them new challenges in life that see them under different pressures. Reuniting with the cast was amazing, we are very lucky to have such a brilliant cast of actors. I constantly, in playing Jonathan, spend my time being intimidated by the acting abilities of everybody else...which is a tricky one!\n\nDo you relate to your character at all in this new series?\n\nI relate to my character less this series, not because of his personality â his personality is very similar to mine in that heâs conflict avoidant and a bit of a beta-male. The thing thatâs the biggest difference between me and Jonathan is that heâs really into cycling... and Iâm not! I thought it would be funny to have him in lycra for large parts of the series, but when youâre writing it you forget that youâve actually got to put that stuff on. Actor Romesh found himself very angry with writer Romesh in terms of what heâd made him do... I would love, if we do another series of this, for Jonathan to have moved beyond the lycra stage because but because I look so ridiculous in it I imagine it might make a comeback.\n\nThe similarities between myself and my character are that he is somebody who is a bit of a people pleaser, heâs worried about upsetting anybody and so inadvertently upsets everybody by not being decisive enough. I definitely do share that, there are lots of occasions where I havenât cancelled something and I need to be somewhere else - so two places in one night. My wife refers to them as âRomesh situationsâ and I feel like Romesh situations and Jonathan situations have a lot in common.\n\nWhat was your highlight from filming?\n\nOne of my highlights from filming is in Episode 3 where Claire and I go to another couplesâ house and they are arguing. Itâs basically us trying to stop Spencer from having a sleepover there as we donât think itâs age appropriate, but that episode with the arguing and the back and forth is one of the funniest scenes Iâve ever been involved in. Another highlight is having to sing Nellyâs âHot In Hereâ about 37 times for Episode 1.\n\nDo you have any funny moments from filming?\n\nThe truth is there were lots and lots of moments where we were just corpsing at stuff, we did a lot of improv of lines in this series and it made for a lot of corpsing and ruining of takes, but it was a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nJessica Knappett\n\nWriter and plays Claire\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Avoidance?\n\nWhat I can tell you is that it is even funnier than the first series, itâs Romesh Ranganathan at his finest! We've got new characters, weâve got more actors, thereâs a lot more love, romance and complication. This series is truly a Rom-Com (pun absolutely intended!).\n\nWeâre a year on in this series, so we left it that Jonathan and Claire tried to get back together, Jonathan was still living out of the house with his sister. We are still in that place, except I guess that Jonathanâs less sad about the break-up and he has managed to piece himself back together a bit, but heâs still very much in crisis and thatâs why thereâs so much lycra. We are moving the story on and basically weâre seeing now a kind of love square (not triangle) and the two new characters, a love interest for Claire (Brett played by Matthew Lewis) and a love interest for Jonathan (Megan played by Aisling Bea) - these two actors are amazing and very funny.\n\nHow was filming with the cast for series 2?\n\nFilming for series 2 has been really fun, I think having the excitement of new faces joining us and some brilliant guests, people like Colin Holt. I think we all just enjoyed the confidence of having a series under our belts meant that weâd found our feet a bit with it which meant that we then got to carry on the story with new people.\n\nItâs just fun really isnât it!\n\nDo you relate to your character at all in this new series?\n\nThe biggest thing for me is that my character Claire gets together with a man who is better looking than her, and unfortunately that is my lived experience! I am married to a man who is just very handsome, and people say to me all the time âis that your husband?!â and I say âyeah!â. I think possibly I might have told Romesh that story so I think thatâs why he put it in the script.\n\nIn terms of similarities between myself and Claire, yeah I basically based my entire performance on me and the frustration I have when dealing with avoidant, yet endearing men!\n\nWhat was your highlight from filming with Romesh again as well as the rest of the cast?\n\nI really enjoyed working with Luke McQueen, I think heâs such a talent, such a funny actor and it was really, really fun seeing him and Louise Ford (who is also absolutely hilarious) have more than just a moment to shine, they get an entire episode.\n\nDo you have any funny moments from filming?\n\nA highlight for me was probably the first time I saw Romesh in lycra! Also we have a really nice way of working because Benjamin Green is the writer and the director and Romesh is the writer and theyâre all on set, so you know you can mess around and change things and improvise and just explore stuff and just really have fun. So thatâs why it was such a great show to make and I think you can feel that energy on the screen, most of my scenes are with either Romesh or Matt and theyâre just very funny actors so my main responsibility was trying not to laugh. I hope you enjoy the series...over and out!\n\nLisa McGrillis\n\nPlays Courtney\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Avoidance?\n\nWe meet them all about a year later and Jonathan is still separated from Claire and the big news is that Courtneyâs pregnant. Iâm going to say itâs the most important news but the other cast might think that their stories are more important (laughs).Courtneyâs pregnant and she is REALLY pregnant, sheâs about eight months pregnant, about to drop. Sheâs in full denial about having a baby, she thinks itâs going to be a piece of cake, but the reality is she has not read a single book, she refuses to engage in NCT and is just sort of going to wing it. Dan is the complete opposite, sheâs read every single book she is completely all over the situation. Their storyline this season is great as itâs just about then navigating what kind of parents they think theyâre going to be and how actually the reality of it is very different.\n\nI got to act with a lovely baby bump, which meant I just ate bacon sandwiches every day and then a massive meal at lunch and it was fine because I had a bump and it was actually really quite nice. I think Iâd subconsciously thought âIâm eating for twoâ, so I really enjoyed that element!\n\nHow was filming with the cast for series 2?\n\nI always feel like if you get an opportunity to do a second series of anything, you should do it because you know what youâre doing, you know who your character is, youâve made friends with everyone. You donât really have the first day of school vibes, itâs just like a little reunion and fortunately everyone is very nice. We had a really brilliant time shooting it, we had some really excellent additions as well â Aisling Bea (plays Megan), being one who I was personally really excited to work with because Iâm a huge fan, so I was thrilled when I heard she was joining the cast.\n\nIt was just brilliant, every single member of that cast is funny and it doesnât really feel like youâre going to work when youâre filming Avoidance, itâs the most lovely, relaxed atmosphere. Benjamin Green our director is just wonderful, Rom is just so brilliant and obviously being reunited with my on screen wife, Mandeep Dhillon (plays Dan), was a thrill. Itâs such a lovely job, Iâm so happy that Iâm part of this ensemble of actors, they are all amazing.\n\nDo you relate to your character at all in this new series?\n\nIâve had two babies myself, so obviously I know what it is to be pregnant! Playing Courtney is just like an alterâego, I love playing her because she has no filter, zero filter. She gets irritated by everyone and everything and thereâs something just so refreshing about playing someone like that, somebody who says exactly what they think all the time! She doesnât try and filter anything, but even more so now sheâs pregnant. She goes to NCT classes and she just thinks this group of people are ridiculous, she has no time for any of them, or how earnest they are. I loved playing the scenes where she was doing the NCT stuff because it was brilliantly written.\n\nSimilarities wise, I think I was probably a bit angry when I was pregnant too...especially towards the end, Iâd say I was furious with everyone! I think Iâve just got more of a filter than Courtney, but it was so much fun to play. I loved the scene where sheâs going into labour, she didnât even try and do any breathing, she just screams her way through it. I have to say I was in slight denial myself about what labour was going to be, but I think when it came to it I hadnât really got my head around what I was supposed to do. So Iâd say there was a bit of similarity there too! I loved playing those labour scenes because actually I was quite shocked about how emotional it was when I was acting giving birth and then them putting a tiny baby on me, I burst into tears... so that was good!\n\nWhat was your highlight from filming with Romesh again?\n\nThere were so many highlights from filming, but I have to say there is a very funny scene that takes place on a rowing boat (without giving too much away)...but it was very funny and it involved Mandeep!\n\nDo you have any funny moments from filming?\n\nI suppose one of the funniest moments was experiencing Romesh dressed in full cycling lycra, in person. It brought me so much joy, the audience are in the for a treat I have to say!\n\nMandeep Dhillon\n\nPlays Dan\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Avoidance?\n\nItâs funny! Jonathan is still being an avoidant, obviously, but heâs had a glow up which is going to delight audience members. Claireâs hair is blonde and, as they say, blondes do have more fun (wink wink nudge nudge!). The biggest news for my character is that Dan and Courtney are expecting a baby, which is very exciting times.\n\nHow was filming with the cast for series 2?\n\nSo much fun, I love them with all my heart. Jessica Knappet, Lisa McGrillis, Romesh Ranganathan and Ben Green are actually my friends, so it was such a joy to get to be back on set with them. Obviously Kieran Logendra (Spencer) is incredible and was so much fun to work with, heâs such a beautiful kid!\n\nI really enjoyed working with the new cast members, I loved working with Aisling Bea (Megan), sheâs really cool and funny and working with Matthew Lewis (Brett) was really fun. Everyone just sort of got on with each other really well, it was like I just ended the year on set with my friends, it didnât feel like work at all!\n\nDo you relate to your character at all in this new series?\n\nThe only thing that I sort of relate to is that I can sometimes be a bit of a control freak, but Iâm getting way better at that. Iâm so organised and Iâll plan everything and I feel like thatâs the similarity we have. The way that Dan can be a bit nerdy too, thereâs an episode in this where she meets this professor who she loves and she is fan girling all over her, I definitely have that aspect in me.\n\nWhat was your highlight from filming with Romesh again as well as the rest of the cast?\n\nRom is literally like my brother from another mother, it was just nice to be able to hang out with him every day and mess about! Although we have jokes and we laugh around, make up songs and we all have our little catchphrases, he is just a wonderful person and was really there for me during this show â and life in general! Love Rom.\n\nDo you have any funny moments from filming?\n\nThe only day I did not like, was the day we had to film in a lake...itâs a well-known fact that I have a phobia of wet mud. I hate wet grass and wet mud, it makes me feel sick! There were a few moments where I had to act surrounded by mud, and I didnât enjoy that. But the cast being there and laughing with me make it ok. The scene with me and Lisa when we find out whether our baby is a boy or a girl...we just couldnât keep it together. I think Iâm probably one of the most unprofessional when it comes to this cast, because I corpse in near enough every scene!\n\nAisling Bea\n\nPlays Megan\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Avoidance?\n\nI donât want to give too much away, but I can say that my character has a sling! She didnât originally have one, but I got shoulder surgery the day before we started filming so we have worked a sling into the character! It sort of worked naturally actually quite well given the storyline.\n\nWhat made you want to join Avoidance for series 2?\n\nRomesh Ranganathan! I love Rom and this is our third thing we've done together, we did a little comedy short for iPlayer about eight years ago now â I think that was one of the first things Romesh was making, and then we were briefly together in the first iteration of Jo Brandâs show âThe Damnedâ and that then went off to be replaced as Romesh went on to be a superstar.\n\nWorking with Rom has in all honesty surpassed my expectations in terms of him as an actor and what incredible range he has which has been really lovely to see. The other big revelation has been the rest of the cast obviously, but also Benjamin Green our brilliant director who is so incredibly kind and lovely and this job has done my heart the world of good. Jessica Knappett is also a very close pal, she is stunning and an amazing writer on this as well, so itâs been great to pop in with all these guys.\n\nHow was filming with the cast for the show? Have you worked with any of them previously?\n\nMy first day on set was a bit of a surreal experience, everyone was really funny on set. Mandeep Dhillon (Dan) and Lisa McGrillis (Courtney) are the kindest, most brilliant, funny, great people. Itâs just been a really warm, happy experience to be honest doing the show and I feel very lucky to have been part of it.\n\nWhat was your highlight from filming with Romesh and the rest of the cast?\n\nI think the smaller scenes with myself and Romesh were really lovely, because weâve been pals and worked together for so long but we havenât had a lot of one on one and when youâre on a set filming, thereâs lots of down time in between takes. So it was just nice to get a bit closer as pals really on this, so thatâs been a lovely part of it which I didnât expect!\n\nDo you have any funny moments from filming?\n\nI hope I helped create some of the funny moments on set! Life for me is a drama so I never really experience anything funny. Thereâs a scene where Romesh does a bit of musical singing and dancing and it was pretty intensely funny, but I will say that Romesh probably made me laugh every single day. We probably couldnât/shouldnât repeat most of our jokes it was definitely a lot of fun all the same.\n\nMatthew Lewis\n\nPlays Brett\n\nWhat can you tell us about the new series of Avoidance?\n\nWell, I play a character Iâve absolutely never played before - the third wheel in a love triangle that audiences will root against on behalf of the main character. Basically, as Jonathan decides heâs going to get Claire back he discovers, cruelly, that she has a new boyfriend, played by me! And heâs got no chance. Brett, my character, is sort of the antithesis to Jonathan, heâs the anti-Jonathan. Heâs a proactive, do it yourself, no nonsense guy and avoidance isnât really in his vocabulary. Unlike me also actually, who put off doing these answers for as long as I possibly could!\n\nWhat made you want to join Avoidance for series 2?\n\nThey asked me to and said they would pay me to do it so already I was interested. I hadnât seen the first series when they sent the script for series two. Being in the US you can miss out on some BBC gold now and then. Fortunately, my old friend Michelle Farr who produced Bluestone 42 (the best job I ever had) also produced this. She gave me a call and once I knew Michelle was doing it, I knew itâd be good. So she sent me a link to the first series which I really really enjoyed. Having watched that, I was able to read series two with Romeshâs and Jessâs voices in my head and it made the whole thing funnier.\n\nHow was filming with the cast for the show? Have you worked with any of them previously?\n\nI know all of them from their work but had never met them. Which is odd, because Jess and I grew up in the same area. But theyâre all brilliant and absurdly talented. I basically got to come in to work every day and for ten hours we all just made each other laugh, which is a great way to spend your day job. Weâve just got to hope the audiences find it as funny as we all did. Our senses of humour are all the same I think. Weâre all sarcastic and acerbic and I think we all gelled really well almost immediately. Comedy is scary - I actually hate it. Drama is drama and people react in myriad ways, thereâs safety in that. But comedy is either funny or itâs not and itâs terrifying. These guys created a safe environment to fail - which I did, many times. But you felt comfortable doing it and so you try and try again and hopefully amongst a lot of me being unfunny, thereâs also a few nuggets of gold for them to cut around and make something out of. Romesh would always do a very believable fake laugh at my jokes so thatâs nice of him.\n\nDo you relate to your character at all? Any similarities between yourself and your character?\n\nNo, absolutely not. I mean, we have the same accent, sort of. His is maybe a bit thicker than mine. I hate using my own accent, I always try and do something different if I can get away with it, makes it easier. So heâs got a sort of heightened Yorkshire accent, I guess? Denser? His entire persona is a man of action, no procrastination just get it done. Rip off the band aid. Heâs a manâs man who likes working with his hands. None of this is me. Iâm very much a Jonathan. Avoidance is the name of the game. I like the gym, sure, but even then, Iâm there because society places burdens upon me. I feel like I *should* be there. Iâd really rather be on the sofa with my dog, playing PlayStation, honestly. I like football. Thatâs a traditionally manly thing isnât it? I donât know if Brett likes football. Probably likes rugby. Yes, heâs a rugby union fan, loves the six nations, definitely. I should have thought about that.\n\nWhat was your highlight from filming with Romesh and the rest of the cast?\n\nThere was a real collaborative atmosphere on set and the creative team all very graciously included me in a lot of it. Myself, Rom, Jess and our director Ben would often break down a scene together, try and come up with jokes, make each other laugh and ultimately just make each scene as tight and as good as we could before we rolled cameras. Between us, thereâs a wealth of experience making TV and between them, a wealth of experience making people laugh. To be welcomed in to that creative process and encouraged to be a part of it was a real highlight for me but if the show is rubbish then I really had nothing to do with any of it and it was all them three.\n\nDo you have any funny moments from filming?\n\nThe whole series is funny! Genuinely, the whole experience was a laugh. Rom wearing Lycra for an awful lot of the shoot was a good choice. Iâve had to do that before, so I didnât envy him. I reckon he pulled it off better than I did to be honest. Itâs all about committing and owning it, and he did, arse pads and all."
