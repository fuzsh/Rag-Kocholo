        "text": "(This article has been updated consistently since its publication in 2021 to reflect the latest records and information available. We will continue to stay on top of all things Cannonball.)\n\nThe Cannonball Run is an unparalleled street race with one goal: Drive from New York to California in the shortest amount of time. Let’s dive into all things Cannonball and look into the Cannonball Run record books.\n\nCannonball Run Record: 25 hours and 39 minutes by Arne Toman and Doug Tabutt in a 2016 Audi S6 in May 2020\n\nCoast-to-Coast-to-Coast Cannonball Run Record: 65 hours and 19 minutes by Bennett Wilson, Chris Ruppman, and Grady Leno in a 2012 Mercedes S500 in April 2022\n\nSolo Cannonball Run Record: 25 hours and 55 minutes* by Fred Ashmore in a 2019 Ford Mustang GT on May 7, 2020 (disputed)\n\nMotorcycle Cannonball Run Record: 32 hours and 32 minutes by Ross “Beau” Earnest aboard a 2008 Yamaha FJR1300 on April 21, 2024\n\nEV Cannonball Run Record: 42 hours and 17 minutes by Ryan Levenson and Josh Allan in a rented Tesla Model S Long Range in October 2021\n\nCannonball Run\n\nWhen you first hear of an illegal and unsanctioned race across the entire United States, perhaps chaos and carelessness come to mind. Maybe you’ve even seen the 1981 film, “The Cannonball Run” which fictionally showcases the drive with the “All-American” glitz and recklessness of street racing. Although the race is illegal, it is anything but chaotic or careless.\n\nThe reality is that the racers of the Cannonball Run are usually methodical, attentive, and diligent, which is perhaps even more baffling. Brock Yates, who created the race in the 1970s, wanted to prove that you could “drive quickly across the country in normal traffic without disrupting anyone or being unsafe.”\n\nThe run traditionally begins at the Red Ball Garage in Manhattan, New York, and ends at the Portofino Hotel & Marina in Redondo Beach, Calif. To this day, there are only a few people both crazy and determined enough to attempt the coast-to-coast run, especially with the goal of a new Cannonball record.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2019 documentary, “APEX: The Secret Race Across America” which covers the true story of how the Cannonball Run record was broken in 2006, the audience is posed with three questions: “What could be more pointless? What could be more dangerous? What were these people thinking?”\n\nThe end of “APEX” doesn’t provide any answers, but, instead, leaves the audience with even more questions: “Why did Cannonball Baker do it? Why did Alex [Roy] and David [Maher] do it? Were they chasing something?”\n\nIn the end, the documentary doesn’t attempt to untangle the complexities of the 110 years of the Cannonball Run, simply stating, “Those questions can’t be answered.”\n\nCoast-to-Coast Racing\n\nIn this Cannonball Run article, you will find a complete history and rundown of all the records, and a list of movies and books about the run.\n\nHistory of the Cannonball Run\n\nLet’s talk about the history of this race that spans from 1903 to now — how this race came to be and how it withstood the test of time, scrutiny, and well, the law. In an interesting twist, in order to avoid legal ramifications, all information of the individuals who set the new records are often not released until at least a year after the fact, once the statute of limitations has expired.\n\nPaving the Road for the Cannonball Run\n\nThe first cross-country drive, from San Francisco to New York City, was completed in 1903 by George Adams Wyman on a 1902 California Motor Company motor bicycle. The trip, which covered 3,800 miles and took 51 days, concluded on July 6, 1903.\n\nAt the exact same time, H. Nelson Jackson and his mechanic Sewall Crocker, were the first to cross the continent by automobile, in a 1903 Winton touring car. They started their trip earlier than Wyman, but completed it after him, taking 64 days to complete the journey.\n\nIn 1909, 22-year-old Alice Ramsey drove a 30-horsepower Maxwell DA touring car from Manhattan to San Francisco in 59 days. She is the first woman to drive an automobile across the U.S. coast to coast. She was accompanied by three other women, none of whom could drive. Of the 3,600-mile route, only 152 miles were paved. That means it included changing 11 tires, a broken brake pedal, cleaning fouled spark plugs, and sleeping in the car when it got stuck in the mud.\n\nThose inaugural trips proved it could be done and inspired rival teams of motorists to turn the journey into a race.\n\nThings really got moving about a decade later when transcontinental highway plans were devised. It would then take many years to see those plans come to fruition, but cross-country trips pretty quickly got much easier and faster.\n\nErwin George “Cannon Ball” Baker\n\nA man named Erwin George Baker, whom everyone knew as “Cannon Ball” Baker, set the coast-to-coast record for driving a car across the country from New York to Los Angeles in 1933. Baker spent the majority of his career prepping for it by riding transcontinentally on a motorcycle. At the time, the roads he drove were entirely unpaved.\n\nIn May 1914, he set out on his Indian motorcycle to break the transcontinental record, starting in San Diego. The newspaper accounts from the time revealed that he meticulously prepped for this ride — he “laid out his routes ahead of time, planning what roads and towns to travel through and even planting tanks of gas ahead of him in remote areas to avoid fuel trouble.”\n\nBaker successfully set the record and arrived in New York after 11.5 days of riding. The endurance Baker needed to complete this feat is the endurance that has carried through all of the Cannonball Run attempts that followed.\n\n53:30 — A Record That Stood for 38 Years\n\nIn 1933, Baker attempted his last coast-to-coast drive across the United States, completing the trip in 53 hours and 30 minutes. To understand how impressive this time was, remember that just 19 years earlier, it took him nearly 12 days to do the same thing.\n\nBehind the wheel of a Graham Automobile, Cannon Ball Baker made history. Of course, at the time, this drive was not called the Cannonball Run. It wasn’t even a race. It was a singular, momentous drive that inspired the Cannonball Run as we know it.\n\nAfter his death, Baker was inducted into numerous motorsports halls of fame. The Motorsports Hall of Fame of America remembers Baker’s unmatched impact: “In the American lore of Roaring Twenties bravado, mud-splattered determination over horse tracks and country roads and the relentless quest for new records, none will ever compare to the one and only Cannon Ball.”\n\nAlthough the 1933 record has been beaten many times over, it remains true that Cannon Ball Baker’s influence will never be forgotten.\n\nThe First ‘Official’ Unsanctioned Races: Brock Yates & the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash\n\nIn 1971, 38 years after Baker’s record, Brock Yates made the race a household name. He called it the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. Yates — the senior editor for Car and Driver Magazine at the time — Brock Yates Jr., Steve Smith, and Jim Williams set out from New York City in a 1971 Dodge Custom Sportsman van, known as “Moon Trash II.”\n\nJust like when Cannon Ball Baker made the trip, this drive was not yet a race, but it became the blueprint for the inaugural race that Yates would put together later that year.\n\nThis unsanctioned street race was held in 1971, 1972, 1975, and 1979. It began in New York City — and Darien, Conn., once — and ended at the Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach, Calif. In the perplexing spirit of the Cannonball Run, this race was both framed as a celebration of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and a protest against strict traffic laws, specifically the 55mph speed limit enforced on major highways.\n\nThe rules were that you made your own rules. In a March 1972 Car and Driver feature, Yates said that the parameters of the Cannonball Run were as follows: “All competitors will drive any vehicle of their choosing, over any route, at any speed they judge practical, between the starting point and destination. The competitor finishing with the lowest elapsed time is the winner.”\n\nA Day to Remember: November 15, 1971\n\nThe first race took place on November 15, 1971. A feature from the March 1972 issue of Car and Driver Magazine, written by Brock Yates himself, sums it up: “Those damn fools, they went and did it.”\n\nThe fools in question? Well, that would be Dan Gurney and … Brock Yates. Six cars left the Red Ball Garage in New York City, all headed west toward the Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach. A few hours in, two more vehicles joined in, making for a fleet of eight cars filled with “23 lunatics.”\n\nOn November 15, 1971, Dan Gurney and Brock Yates co-drove a Kirk F. White Ferrari Daytona coup to the finish in 35 hours and 54 minutes — notably, only 53 minutes faster than the second-place team. In this race, Gurney and Yates beat seven other teams who were all attempting to win. Of the eight teams, half of them got speeding tickets.\n\nFunnily enough, a large motor van participated in this race. Bill Broderick, alongside Pal Parker, drove a 27-foot Travico motor home. Unsurprisingly, they finished last at 57 hours and 25 minutes.\n\nYates decided to both host and participate in such an event as a “whimsical gesture of defiance of the regimen of contemporary traffic laws.” At the end of Yates’ own 1972 feature, he wrote, “No one who ran, not Gurney, not Adamowicz, not anybody, got a dime for the race, making it some kind of milestone in modern automotive annals.”\n\n1972 & 1975 Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash\n\nOn November 13, 1972, Steve “Yogi” Behr, Bill Canfield, and Fred Olds won the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash with a time of 37 hours and 16 minutes. While this team beat the other racers, they did not beat Gurney and Yates’ 1971 record. They raced in a Cadillac Coupe DeVille — the first American car to win the Cannonball Run.\n\nHowever, the record didn’t stand for long. In 1975, Jack May and Rick Cline drove a Ferrari Dino in 35 hours and 53 minutes, at an average speed of 81 mph, to claim the new record.\n\n‘Final’ Cannonball Run in 1979\n\nIn the 1979 Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, Dave Heinz and Dave Yarborough beat the record by 3 hours and 2 minutes. Driving in a Jaguar XJS, the team achieved a time of 32 hours and 51 minutes with an average speed of 86 mph. Notably, unlike any of the other attempts, this run began in Darien, Conn.\n\nCar and Driver contributing editor Fred M.H. Gregory gave an account of The Last Cannonball in a 2002 article. He revealed that in this race, there were a whopping 46 teams involved, all taking off at 10-minute intervals.\n\nInterestingly, Yates’ vehicle for this run was a Dodge ambulance with a Magnum 440 engine. Within moments of departure, the ambulance broke down and needed repairs that took more than an hour. Nonetheless, Yates still completed the race but was nowhere near beating the record.\n\nAnd while Yates used the guise of an ambulance, another team (Lou Sellyei and Gary Arentz) simply put a cooler inside their Jaguar XJ-S. When pulled over for speeding, they said, “We’re rushing to save a child’s sight, officer.” They were both physicians, but the contents of the cooler, well, were pig’s eyes.\n\nBrock Yates, the organizer of the original Cannonball Run, does not officially acknowledge any records after 1979. Yates commented, “I stopped the race because I knew sooner or later that somebody was going to get killed.” But Yates left the Cannonball floodgates open. “If people want to try it, the roads are open,” he said.\n\nCannonball Run Under a New Name: The U.S. Express\n\nThe U.S. Express was held from 1980 to 1983. While the race was attempted for 4 years, the record was not beaten until Doug Turner and David Diem beat it in 1983.\n\nIn the documentary “APEX,” one of the interviewees noted, “By the time you got to the U.S. Express, it was only the most hardcore people.”\n\nInaugural 1980 U.S. Express\n\nJust as it did in the past, the race began in New York and ended in California. In the case of the 1980 U.S. Express, it began in Brooklyn and ended in Santa Monica. The winners of the 1980 race were Rick Doherty and Will Wright coming in at 33 hours and 9 minutes. That time, as impressive as it was, did not beat the 1979 record of 32 hours and 51 minutes held by Heinz and Yarborough.\n\nInterestingly enough, the co-driver, Will Wright, was a famous game designer. Wright’s expertise in technology translated well to the preparation needed for a Cannonball record attempt.\n\n1981 U.S. Express\n\nIn 1981, though they did not beat the record, David Morse and Steve Clausman drove a Porsche 928 on a route that was mostly on I-80 to take home the win. This race began in Long Island, N.Y., and finished in Emeryville, Calif. The car was equipped with a massive fuel tank. Clausman was a professional driver and Morris was a businessman.\n\nWhen reflecting on their experiences in the documentary “APEX,” they spoke of how important it was for the driver and co-driver to complement one another. Clausman, both seriously and jokingly, said, “It is probably the stupidest thing I’ve done in my life.”\n\n1982 U.S. Express\n\nInformation regarding the 1982 U.S. Express seems to be nearly nonexistent. With that, we were unable to find who was involved, much less who won the race.\n\nIn a video interview, David Morse, the 1981 winner of the U.S. Express, said, regarding the 1982 race, “Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. The highway patrol of various states had been notified not only about the race but about our car specifically. The officer would know me by name.”\n\nHe recounted what the police said to him, “We’ve been told there is an illegal car race going down, and we are here to slow you down, or, arrest you.” Morse gathered that someone had alerted the authorities about his car specifically as revenge for his winning the 1981 race.\n\n1983 U.S. Express\n\nIn what would become the final U.S. Express, Doug Turner and David Diem beat the Cannonball Run record, taking the win in 32 hours and 7 minutes. Their record stood for over 20 years until 2006.\n\nTurner and Diem were the first people to use a plane as a scouting tool during their drive. Because of that, their attempt was met with some scrutiny as many people saw the use of a plane as cheating. But while many people were uncertain if a small plane or even a helicopter could make it across the United States in 32 hours, Turner and Diem managed to get a car across the United States in that time.\n\nInterestingly, a documentary titled “32 Hours 7 Minutes” was created but never released. You can view an unofficial trailer. There were and are many lawsuits and disagreements surrounding the release of this documentary, and it was ultimately never released to the public. It is technically available on DVD but goes for upward of $100 on Amazon.\n\nThe End of the U.S. Express\n\nThe 1983 U.S. Express ran into a bit of a roadblock — a literal police roadblock. When the “Cannonball Run” movie was released in 1981, the police were suddenly very aware of the underground race. Any time a car would be speeding, according to the documentary, “APEX,” police would think, “Wow, it could be Cannonball coming through!”\n\nSo, why did the race end just as a team finally broke the record? As the race became publicized, liability increased. Thus, the Cannonball Run under the name the U.S. Express ended for good, and the record of 32 hours and 7 minutes stood for over 20 years.\n\nMore Cannonball: Different Names\n\nAfter the U.S. Express ended, the legacy of organized transcontinental races continued. In the spirit of Cannonball, drivers continued with transcontinental events including One Lap of America, The 2904, and the C2C Express.\n\nThe 2904\n\nAlso known as the Transcontinental Motorized Vehicular Tournament of Efficiency and Endurance, The 2904 is an unofficial race that goes from, you guessed it, New York City to California that was started by John Ficarra.\n\nThe catch? You have to do the race in a vehicle that costs no more than $2,904. This includes the vehicle, fuel, food, tolls, repairs, and tickets. If you purchase additional safety equipment, that does not count against you in the budget.\n\nThe 2904 began in 2007 and has occurred eight times since then, up until 2017. In 2015, the record for The 2904 was set at 32 hours and 5 minutes in a 2002 Mercedes S55. Of course, Ed Bolian was behind the wheel and he cataloged his entire experience. You can check out the full list of The 2904 event winners here.\n\nC2C Express\n\nThe C2C Express is a Cannonball Run specifically for classic cars that started in 2016. Ed Bolian participated in the inaugural race in a “Bluemobile.” In January 2020, Ed Bolian posted a video titled New Year’s Special: The Final Running of The C2C Express.\n\nThe Washington Post describes the C2C Express as, “Five cars, 13 guys, countless energy drinks and 2,900 miles of asphalt: Welcome to the C2C Express.”\n\nNew Era of Individual Cannonball Runs\n\nWith the end of the U.S. Express, the Cannonball Run became an individual endeavor with single teams making the run to try to break the overall record. And while many attempts have gone unpublicized over the years, the teams that have broken the record have mostly been extremely vocal about it — after the statute of limitations is up, of course.\n\n2006 Cannonball Run Record of Alex Roy & David Maher\n\nIn 2006, Alex Roy and David Maher beat the Cannonball Run Record with a time of 31 hours and 4 minutes in a BMW M5. The details of their feat were not released until Roy released his memoir, “The Driver,” in 2007.\n\nIn 2019, the documentary “APEX” was released with real footage and interviews surrounding both the 2006 run and the 1983 U.S. Express race.\n\nUsing an immense amount of technology, Roy and Maher decided they would masquerade as weather watchers if they were pulled over.\n\nThis win did not come without its struggles. Alex Roy’s first attempt in April 2006 was cut short when his M5’s fuel pump failed in Oklahoma. But that did not stop him from attempting the run again, resulting in his 2006 record.\n\n2013 Cannonball Run Record of Ed Bolian, Dave Black, and Dan Huang\n\nEd Bolian, along with Alex Roy, is perhaps the most outspoken participant of the Cannonball Run. If there were to be an honorary expert in this matter, it would likely be Bolian.\n\nIn 2013, Bolian, Dave Black, and Dan Huang drove a 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG across the country in 28 hours and 50 minutes, an astonishing feat to break the 30-hour mark. Bolian chose this car because of its understated looks, making it more likely to go unnoticed, which is exactly what a Cannonballer wants. Their average speed was 98 mph, and the car had 67 gallons of fuel capacity. In total, the team only stopped for 46 minutes.\n\nBolian reflected on the preparation of the 28:50 drive and what the drive meant to him personally in his video, 5 years ago we set the Cannonball record. He talked about how, as a high schooler, he was given the opportunity to interview Brock Yates for a project in automotive journalism.\n\nBolian told Yates, “One day, I’m going to beat the Cannonball Run record.” When he said that, Yates admitted that he did not think that it could be done. Since that moment, Bolian had set out to discover what it would take to beat this record.\n\nWhen speaking about the experience of the drive itself, Bolian said, “Everything went as well as it could.” Bolian also commented that he “hopes that he shattered Roy’s record by such a stark margin that it discourages would-be Cannonballers from attempting to break his record, and it’s not just a matter of his own legacy.”\n\n2019 Cannonball Run Record of Arne Toman, Doug Tabutt, and Berkeley Chadwick\n\nDespite Bolian’s hope, it wasn’t long before the record was lowered again. On November 10, 2019, Arne Toman, Doug Tabutt, and Berkeley Chadwick drove a 2015 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG sedan across the country in 27 hours and 25 minutes. This new record was just a little over 1 hour faster than the 2013 record.\n\nIn the video We Broke the Cannonball Record, Arne Toman says, “To me, Cannonballing is the ultimate expression of freedom. As a kid, I saw the movie, I read the articles, and it was something that was forever on my mind. In 2006, we had done the One Lap of America, which is the event Brock Yates turned Cannonball into once he stopped doing the cross-country runs.”\n\nToman said that when he heard of Bolian’s 2013 record, he was “both excited and gutted.” He saw Bolian’s time as unbeatable. But Arne didn’t get discouraged, instead deciding to prepare for his attempt. Much of Toman’s time went into researching the best possible fuel transfer system to minimize time.\n\nDoug Tabutt remarked, “Don’t just meet your heroes, beat your heroes.” And, Arne and Doug did just that. The co-drivers actually met through Bolian. The rest is history.\n\nYou can read more about their journey in the Road & Track article, These Guys Just Drove an E63 AMG Across America in a Record 27 Hours 25 Minutes.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Cannonball Run Era\n\nMany people hunkered down and stayed home during the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the U.S. in March 2020. But, others took to the road. Is that a smart or fair idea? Well, one might ask, has any of this ever been a “smart” or “fair” idea?\n\nThe Cannonball Run’s record-breaking attempts have never ended. Cannonball records were broken at an incredible rate during the peak of the pandemic.\n\nThe sentiments behind this race have always been that of immense preparation, innovation, and endurance. What, then, does it mean when drivers are taking advantage of an unprecedented time? Does that match the spirit of the Cannonball Run?\n\nThe first confirmed new Cannonball record during the pandemic occurred in April 2020. Then, the record was broken again in May. Then, the solo record was set later in May — and, at the time, thought to be the overall record.\n\nDuring the 5 weeks from April to May 2020, Cannonballers took advantage of open roads due to the global pandemic. Is it fair? A hard question to answer, as the “fairness” of an unsanctioned street race is probably questionable to begin with.\n\nApril 9, 2020 Cannonball Run Record of Team “Captain Chaos”\n\nEd Bolian announced a new Cannonball record on April 9, 2020. When Bolian discussed whether or not the rumors were true of this initial record being broken amid COVID-19, he said, “Yes, it is true … sort of.” He then went on to say, “I am saying right now that it wouldn’t be me. And I’m saying right now, it was not me.”\n\nBolian spoke of the team that held the new Cannonball Run record in April. He recounted, “A team had gone from the Red Ball Garage to the Portofino Hotel and Marina in a 2019 Audi A8 with a time of 26 hours and 38 minutes, an UNBELIEVABLE time that beat the November 2019 time of Arnie and Doug in their E63.”\n\nWhen speaking about the team, Bolian noted, “They didn’t want to be known as the key violators of all of these shelter-in-place regulations. Nobody wanted to be out there putting anyone’s lives in danger.”\n\nThe anonymous team, dubbed “Captain Chaos” by the Cannonball community, set a new outright record of 26 hours and 38 minutes on April 4, 2020, in a 2019 Audi A8L. The team kept their identities and details of the run under wraps for over 3 years, in order for the statute of limitations on their traffic violations to elapse.\n\nThe team and details of the Cannonball Run were exposed on the SwitchCast Podcast, with host Arne Toman. The three-person team consisted of Chris Allen, James Allen, and Kale Odhner. Team captain Allen is an accomplished endurance racer and the car used was his father’s leased Audi. The team did use spotters, stabilized binoculars, a radar detector, Waze, and some trunk-mounted marine fuel cells to accomplish their record run. You can listen to all the details here.\n\nThe record run was one of the least expensive ever and also a record that was held for the shortest amount of time in history — about 40 days.\n\nEarly May 2020 Cannonball Run Record of Arne Toman & Doug Tabutt\n\nFast-forward to May 2020. The April 2020 Cannonball Run record was once again beaten. According to Bolian, the new record was under 26 hours, the car averaged over 120 mph for most of the drive, and the team had over 30 spotters. Bolian believed this record was the end of the “COVID-19 Cannonball Era.”\n\nIt was later revealed that this was Arne Toman and Doug Tabutt’s new 25-hour and 39-minute outright record.\n\nOn Bolian’s well-known YouTube Channel, VINwiki Car Stories, it was announced on May 14 that there had been another New Cannonball Record. Ed said, “Consider that it took six years and dozens of extremely well-prepared events for anyone to beat 28 hours, 50 minutes. In the span of five weeks, it was just beaten seven times.”\n\nMay 6-7, 2020 (Solo & Rental) Cannonball Run Record of Fred Ashmore*\n\nWhile the premise of the Cannonball Run in general is unfathomable for most people, doing the drive completely alone is even more unbelievable.\n\nIn a mind-boggling feat, Ashmore rented a 2019 Ford Mustang GT from Avis for 17 days for $700. He then loaded it up with numerous fuel tanks — 127 gallons onboard in total. “If I could take those two other people out and replace them with fuel,” Ashmore said, “I could do it.” (As quoted in an October 2020 GQ article.)\n\nHe only stopped one time for gas, in Kellyville, Okla., traveling the traditional southern Cannonball Run route, over 2,806.2 miles. He averaged 12.3 mpg and about 109 mph. The run only cost him about $3,000 in total.\n\nAshmore thought his run was done when he sat at a California agriculture checkpoint for 20-plus minutes, but in the end got waved through without issue. He also had a run-in with a police officer near Gardenia, Calif., where he escaped arrest by exiting quickly and looping around a few times before getting back on track. The entire run was overseen from afar by Ashmore’s brother, who helped with calculations, weather, traffic, etc.\n\nFirst reported by Angelo Melluso of Road & Track, Fred Ashmore made this solo attempt on May 6-7, 2020, in a record time of 25 hours and 55 minutes. That story has since been updated, to align with Benjamin Preston’s story on Road & Track that puts Ashmore’s run into question — mostly based on this detailed report.\n\nA VINwiki video of Ashmore sharing the tale of his run was also released, taken down, and then put back up with a disclaimer. A number of other YouTube interviews with Ashmore talking about his run have also been published.\n\nYou read that right — a rental car with a single occupant just set the fastest known Cannonball Run time (publicly known at the time). In the end, it was actually the solo and rental car records that Ashmore had set, as the early May 2020 Toman/Tabutt run was eventually revealed as the overall record.\n\nAshmore bought the car a few months later from a dealership, after tracking it down, and owns it today. He named the car “Kilroy.” You can follow Ashmore’s automotive adventures on Instagram here.\n\nBut, there is lots of drama, egos, and distrust amongst the Cannonball community surrounding Ashmore and his run. A core group of the “fraternity of lunatics” that make up the Cannonball community have discredited Ashmore’s run, others in the community have not found a substantive reason not to believe him.\n\nI, Bryon Dorr, have talked to Ashmore directly — where I got the details you see here — as well as others in the “fraternity of lunatics” and heard both sides of this tale. There are compelling reasons to believe and to not believe Ashmore’s run to be legitimate. But, in the end, Ashmore has not been able to produce any solid proof of his run to me or anyone else.\n\nThis is an ongoing saga and one that I’ll continue to follow up on to ensure that this Cannonball record story is as accurate as possible. At least, as much as reporting on a secretive and illegal street race can be.\n\n2023 U.S. Express Rebirth\n\nForty years after it was last run, the U.S. Express was reborn. On October 27, 2023, 15 teams left the Red Ball Garage in New York, with 13 finishing at the Portofino in California. A new competitive event record was set with a time of 30:56, and the worst time of the event was 39:13. The organized event was put on by Taylor Hull, with the permission of the original event organizer’s (R.I.P. Rick Doherty) family.\n\nThe event was invite-only, with Hull hand-picking the participants. Only 1983 or older vehicles, with period-correct engines, were permitted. Teams could leave the Red Ball anytime they wanted between 6 p.m. and midnight on October 27. A few teams with newer vehicles also made noncompetitive runs while running sweep for the event, to help out any teams that had issues along the way.\n\nJay Roberts was the official timekeeper, with teams each getting a paper time card that was manually punched — with a battery-powered classic time clock — and signed at each end of the route. Jay flew between New York and California with the time clock.\n\nThe pristine safety record of competitive coast-to-coast events remains intact. But yes, a few vehicles were stopped with mechanical issues, and a few were slowed down by getting “spirited driving awards” (better known as speeding tickets).\n\nNew (Short-Lived) Competitive Event Record: 31:36\n\nTaylor Hull’s 1970 Dodge Charger team, including Hunter Robinson and Andrew Rodgers, was the first car to arrive at the Portofino during the 2023 U.S. Express, setting a new competitive event record time of 31 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nThis new record would also be the shortest-lived competitive event record as well, as exactly 1 hour later it was bested.\n\nCompetitive Event Record: 30:56 by Team Operation 69\n\nWith a new competitive event record of 30 hours and 56 minutes, Team Operation 69 — Cameron Davis and Aaron Tulin — rolled into the Portofino in a 1979 Mercedes 450 SEL 6.9, averaging about 92 mph across the country. The old Merc hit 69,000 miles on the odometer on the 2023 U.S. Express, hence the team name.\n\nThe car is a U.S.-spec version with Euro headlights, bumpers, and period-correct wheels. The big modification is a change from the three-speed auto without overdrive to a six-speed manual transmission with two overdrive gears. This offered better fuel economy (10-11 mpg, compared to 8). It also allowed the car to cruise happily at 130 mph at 3,000 rpm in sixth gear. Electric cooling fans replaced the clutch fan under the hood, which increased power.\n\nModifications didn’t stop there, however. To greatly improve range, two 19-gallon fuel cells, pumping into the main tank, provided 64 gallons total of onboard capacity, equating to around 650 miles of range per fill-up.\n\nOff the front bumper hung four driving lights. Out back, there was the ability to switch between two different lighting patterns and a flipper plate that switches between vintage and current tags. Inside there were two phones running Waze and Highway Radar apps, a Garmin GPS for tracking time and speed, an accessory switch panel, a switch for a valved muffler, additional systems monitoring gauges, and a radar detector.\n\nFactoid: The route of the early ’80s U.S. Express, and earlier Cannonball Runs, was 150 or so miles shorter than modern routes. Two-lane roads like old Route 66 had to be used; today, highways like Route 10 and 44 are used. The old route was well over 2,900 miles, whereas the new routes are just over 2,800. Keep that in mind when comparing old times and average speeds to modern ones.\n\nWhere Does the Cannonball Run Go From Here?\n\nMost of these new overall Cannonball Run records have arisen during a time when, quite literally, the entire world was shut down. Does this mean the new Cannonball Run records will be unbeatable? Does that mean it is the end of an era? ”It could destroy the pursuit,” Bolian said.\n\nAgain, Bolian acknowledged that, at the end of the day, “There aren’t real rules” when it comes to the Cannonball Run. How could there be?\n\nThis is also the difficulty with speculating about the future of the Cannonball Run — as its history has shown, the event is complicated and incredible. How it evolves from here is anyone’s guess. It’s also up to individuals to shape, versus any governing body.\n\nThe Place That First Popularized the Cannonball Run Now Thinks … It’s Not Cool Anymore\n\nEric Tingwall described the Cannonball Run as a “feat of nothingness” in the Car and Driver article, Cross-Country Cannonball Speed Records Are Dumb. In the headline, he acknowledged that Car and Driver originally popularized this race, as Brock Yates was the senior editor for the magazine when he created the race in 1971.\n\nBut Tingwall says, “We’re older and wiser today — no longer that same magazine that once campaigned against making cars safer. Driving across the country is different now, too.” And he does have a point. The ’70s and ’80s were a different animal when it came to driving than the present day.\n\nAt the end of the article, Tingwall asked a difficult question: “If right now is not a good time to jeopardize innocent lives by indulging in a selfish and hollow pursuit of notoriety, what makes that acceptable in better times?”\n\nNotably, this opinion, so staunchly against the Cannonball Run, came directly as a result of the many attempts made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though Tingwall speaks of the race, regardless of COVID-19, as a “selfish” and “hollow pursuit,” perhaps his feelings would not have been as intense if these attempts were not made during this unprecedented time.\n\nHow Do You Decide the Rules When There Are No Rules?\n\nEd Bolian discussed the pros and cons of attempting the Cannonball during a pandemic in a video posted on March 24, 2020. For example, Waze, a navigation tool commonly used by the teams, is not working as well because fewer people are on the road. With that, an obvious pro is that there is less car traffic on the road.\n\n“Teams have decided now is the perfect time to chase their hopes and dreams,” Bolian said. He acknowledged the advantage of attempting the Cannonball Run during this time but expressed mixed feelings on the “okayness” of it.\n\nWith all this being said, Bolian acknowledged that it would make no sense for him to condemn any of these drivers. “That would be like a cocaine dealer telling a heroin dealer that he is just a terrible, terrible person,” he said.\n\n‘Don’t Break the Law While Breaking the Law’ — Molly’s Game\n\nBolian went on to break down the complexities surrounding the record-breaking attempts and success during this unprecedented time of COVID-19. He said, “The idea of driving fast across the country is somewhat redeemed by the nod to historical precedent — the fact that this is a thing that really happened. There were some entertaining movies about it, and it is part of American car culture.\n\n“The fact that we get away with something deviant and law-breaking hinges upon the principle that people think it is okay because these people are adding their names to the history of Cannonball. I don’t think the public appetite is ready to conceive that indulgence.”\n\nThe confusing nature of qualifying these new times for the Cannonball Run boils down to the idea that records are both objective and subjective, Bolian concluded. The circumstances surrounding driving during COVID-19 will probably — hopefully — never be the same circumstances for anyone in the future.\n\nEd outlined all the controversy in his videos regarding the recent records. Then, he ended on a positive note: “The most important thing to me is to recognize that the biggest and most critical part of the pursuit’s history is that in the past fifty years, there have been no accidents involving other cars and no significant injuries.”\n\nHe continued, “And that has not happened in any of these recent drives.” Bolian finished by saying two words regarding the recent records: “They count.”\n\nYou can find all of Ed Bolian’s videos on VINwiki regarding the Cannonball Run on the video playlist, Cannonball Run Related Car Stories.\n\nThe Unofficial Cannonball Run Record Book\n\nWhile there are no rules, there are a few parameters. All of the drivers began in New York and ended in Los Angeles. Typically, the race begins sometime after midnight.\n\nIn this section, you will find a full list of the Cannonball record holders. Within the list, you will find their times, their names, and the vehicles they drove. If the information was available, we have also outlined how each car was set up, any unique techniques that were used, and any major issues with the runs.\n\nThe only other unofficial Cannonball Run record list is a spreadsheet published by Ed Bolian of VINwiki fame. You can find his list here.\n\nThe Drive That Started Everything (1933)\n\n53:30 Erwin George ‘Cannon Ball’ Baker\n\nBetter known as Cannon Ball Baker, Baker is, you guessed it, the man behind all of this. In 1933, Baker drove a Graham-Paige model 57 Blue Streak 8 from New York to Los Angeles. He completed the drive in 53 hours and 30 minutes. This became the record time for driving across the United States. Baker’s time held for nearly 4 decades.\n\nCannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash (1971-1979)\n\n35:54 Dan Gurney & Brock Yates\n\nOn November 15, 1971, Dan Gurney and Brock Yates co-drove a White Ferrari Daytona coupe in 35 hours and 54 minutes. In this race, Gurney and Yates beat seven other teams. Notably, Gurney and Yates never exceeded 175 mph and had an average speed of 80 mph.\n\nOn March 1, 1972, Car and Driver Magazine released a feature on the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. The article described in detail the car that won the race: “This team left at 12:32. Their Ferrari was entered by exotic-car impresario Kirk F. White of Philadelphia. It was utterly stock (what could be modified?), and no extra equipment was carried.\n\n“A dazzling blue paint job, complete with exquisite pinstriping plus a patchwork of sponsor decals, made the car about as inconspicuous as Hugh Hefner’s DC-9. Virtually everybody was convinced the car would be a wide favorite with law enforcement officers.”\n\nWhile the seven other cars racing all took a similar route, Dan and Brock took a different one.\n\nYates wrote, “Rather than run Interstate 78 from northern New Jersey to the intersection of the Pennsy Turnpike at Harrisburg, its crew cut northward across New Jersey’s Route 46, through Netcong and Hackettstown, to Interstate 80 due west across Pennsylvania. From there, they cut southwest across Ohio from Akron to Columbus, intersecting with the conventional route.”\n\n35:53 Jack May & Rick Cline\n\nIn the 1975 Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, Jack May, and Rick Cline beat the record held by Dan Gurney and Brock Yates by one single minute. They drove across the United States in a Ferrari Dino 246 GTS in 35 hours and 53 minutes.\n\n32:51 Dave Heinz & Dave Yarborough\n\nIn the 1979 Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, Dave Heinz, and Dave Yarborough beat the record by 3 hours and 2 minutes. Driving in a Jaguar XJS, the team achieved a time of 32 hours and 51 minutes with an average speed of 87 mph.\n\nNotably, unlike any of the other attempts, this run began in Darien, Conn.\n\nThe U.S. Express (1980-1983)\n\n32:07 Doug Turner & David Diem\n\nIn a Ferrari 308, Doug Turner and David Diem finished the run at 32 hours and 7 minutes, 44 minutes faster than the fastest Cannonball Run at the time. This was the “official” cross-country record until 2006.\n\nThe Ferrari 308 was designed to be refueled quickly and had installed kill switches for brake lights. Turner and Diem spent months strategizing the best possible route. Their average speed was 89.89 mph, but they often drove over 125 mph.\n\nThe Cannonball Run Record Holders (2006-Present)\n\n31:04 Alex Roy & David Maher\n\nIn 2006, after 23 years, Alex Roy and David Maher set out in a 2000 BMW M5 and beat the record, running 31 hours and 4 minutes. The BMW M5 had a top speed of 155 mph but could be pushed to 190 mph with a software upgrade. While at times they exceeded 150 mph, the average speed of the run was 90.1 mph.\n\nThe car was armed with three large antennas, GPS navigation units, police scanners, night vision so they could drive without headlights, multiple cameras, and a 16-gallon fuel cell. They also had a small airplane following them the entire time with a radio communication system to keep an eye out for police and other obstacles. Nobody slept, and they made six fuel stops throughout the entire run.\n\n28:50 Ed Bolian, Dave Black, and Dan Huang\n\nIn 2013, Ed Bolian and Dave Block drove a 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG across the country at an incredible time of 28 hours and 50 minutes. Their average speed was 98 mph and the car had 67 gallons of fuel capacity. In total, the team only stopped for 46 minutes.\n\n27:25 Arne Toman, Doug Tabutt, and Berkeley Chadwick\n\nOn November 10, 2019, Arne Toman, Doug Tabutt, and Berkeley Chadwick drove a 2015 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG sedan across the country in 27 hours and 25 minutes, just a little over one hour faster than the 2013 record. The car was detuned to 700 wheel horsepower.\n\nThey had many gadgets to assist them including radar detectors, a police scanner, a plane crash avoidance system, and brake/tail light kill switches. Along with that, they used a thermal scope mounted on a gimbal on the roof which, according to the team, proved to be rather unhelpful.\n\n26:38 Chris Allen, James Allen, and Kale Odhner\n\nIn April 2020, Chris Allen, James Allen, and Kale Odhner drove a 2019 Audi A8 sedan across the U.S. in 26 hours and 38 minutes. Notably, their car was equipped with a pair of red plastic marine fuel tanks ratchet-strapped in the rear storage. The run’s average speed was 106 mph.\n\n25:39 Arne Toman, Doug Tabutt, and Dunadel Daryoush\n\nIn May 2020, the team of Arne Toman, Doug Tabutt, and Dunadel Daryoush drove a 2016 Audi S6, disguised as a Ford Taurus Police Interceptor, to a new record of 25 hours and 39 minutes. A 110 mph average speed for the entire run was achieved, with maximum speeds reaching just shy of 175 mph. Over 30 spotters were used to achieve this run. The team left Manhattan at 6 p.m.\n\nThe car was modified to put out about 600 horsepower through modified turbos, an upgraded heat exchanger, and a custom tune. A trunk-mounted 45-gallon fuel cell, plus the car’s 22-gallon stock tank, helped provide the needed range and reduced fuel stops.\n\nA host of police-evasion modifications were also installed on the car. These included radar detectors, laser diffusers, a CB radio, and a brake light kill switch. To top it off, a roof-mounted thermal camera was used to spot wildlife and police on the sides of the road ahead.\n\nFor Tabutt’s first-hand detailed account of this record run, check out this story.\n\nOther Cannonball Run Records\n\nAlong with the traditional Cannonball Run overall record, there have also been numerous other specific Cannonball Run records. While the main rule of the Cannonball Run is that there are no rules, these category records have a few self-imposed rules to conform to the categories.\n\nCannonball Run Solo Record\n\nThe solo Cannonball Run record is held by Carl “Yumi” Dietz with a time of 27 hours and 54 minutes. It was set in a 2016 Cadillac ATS on April 4-5, 2020.\n\nIf Fred Ashmore can prove his claimed time of 25 hours and 55 minutes from June 2020 in a rented 2020 Ford Mustang GT, he will get this record.\n\nSolo Nonstop Cannonball Run Record\n\nJay Roberts set the new Solo Nonstop Cannonball Record at 33 hours and 45 minutes in September 2022, in a 2017 Toyota Prius. He was inspired by the VINwiki videos, online resources, and many books on the Cannonball and just had to have a go himself.\n\nHis first attempt was during the 2021 Musketball, but that attempt was much slower than was acceptable to him — mostly due to a semi-truck crash in Colorado that created traffic.\n\nRoberts’ Prius was outfitted with the stock 11-gallon and three 32-gallon fuel tanks, for a total of 107 gallons. He didn’t stop for fuel on the entire cross-country run and still had about 17 gallons left when he arrived at the Portofino.\n\nWhile he did have a radar detector and the JBV1 app running on an Android phone, he mostly relied on a virtual group of spotters in a private radar detector online group to help him stay out of trouble and on track. He did get pulled over once — for about 5 minutes — for speeding but wasn’t issued a ticket, somehow.\n\nHe used a funnel and a small hole in the floorboards to relieve himself on the run, so as not to make any bathroom stops. He did make one stop where he exited the vehicle on the run — which he called a safety stop — in order to clean the bugs off the windshield.\n\nRoberts says he averaged 84 mph on the run and got 32 mpg. He drove 100-105 mph most of the run, to balance speed with fuel economy, as well as to beat his target time of a sub-34-hour Cannonball Run.\n\nCoast-to-Coast-to-Coast Cannonball Record\n\nThe first known C2C2C record was set in 1971 with a time of 90 hours by Ed Bruerton and Tom Bruerton in an AMC AMX.\n\nIn May 2020, on the same weekend as the Toman/Tabutt overall record, Chris Clemens and Mark Spence drove a 1999 Mercedes SL500 over 5,600 miles round trip from New York to Los Angeles to New York to set the new Double Cannonball record at 74 hours and 5 minutes.\n\nOn the drive west, the team was able to use many of the same spotters that helped Toman and Tabutt to an overall Cannonball Record. The team did, however, get pulled over once for speeding, and issued a ticket, on the drive west.\n\nThere have been lots of attempts of C2C2C records since, especially in 2022. The current record stands at 65 hours and 19 minutes and was set on April 22-24, 2022, by Bennett Wison, Chris Ruppmann, and Grady Leno in a 2012 Mercedes S500. Only a week prior to that record, and only 9 minutes slower, the record had been set in a 2008 Saab 9-5 Aero by Nik Krueger, Wesley James, and Mark Spence.\n\nCannonball Run Motorcycle Record\n\nThe Cannonball Run motorcycle record is where it all began all the way back in 1914 with Erwin George “Cannon Ball” Baker’s 11.5-day transcontinental run.\n\nAlan “the stalwart Californian” T. Bedell rode a Henderson motorcycle from Los Angeles to New York in 7 days, 16 hours, and 16 minutes in 1917 to impressively beat Cannonball’s record.\n\nThe record is rumored to have changed hands at least seven times over the years.\n\nOn April 20, 2019, Calvin Cote set a new motorcycle cannonball record with a time of 35 hours and 6 minutes. He was riding a 2012 BMW K1600 GTL, with a custom 15-gallon auxiliary fuel tank. You can watch a GoPro video of his entire run here.\n\nAlex Jones set another Cannonball Run motorcycle record on Oct. 17-18, 2021, aboard a 2014 Yamaha FJR1300 at a time of 32 hours and 52 minutes. It is chronicled in a 2021 Road & Track story.\n\nRoss “Beau” Earnest set the current Cannonball Motorcycle record on April 21, 2024, aboard a 2008 Yamaha FJR1300, with a time of 32 hours and 32 minutes. Beau averaged 86.5 mph on his over 2,800-mile trip, which started April 19 at the Red Ball Garage. He took the southern route through Texas and Arizona to avoid storms in Colorado.\n\nHe only stopped for fuel five times, as he was running a 13-gallon fuel cell. The bike was outfitted with an Adaptiv laser jammer, a Valentine V1G2 radar detector, a seat by Russell Day Long, a couple of cellphones, and a Nite Ride thermal camera.\n\nBeau’s riding jacket pockets were filled with beef jerky and a few 40-ounce water bottles to keep him fueled and hydrated. A few GPS tracking apps, including Joiner, which was running live and monitored by some of the Fraternity of Lunatics, helped validate Beau’s record run.\n\nWith a number of friends riding their own motorcycles ahead of Beau on various sections of the record run, he was able to avoid any major weather, traffic, or law enforcement issues. However, his Bluetooth helmet comms failed near Oaks, Missouri, and he had to ride the rest of the run to the Portofino without audio comms. He received texts but couldn’t respond very well at those speeds.\n\nCannonball Run Diesel Record\n\nThe current Cannonball Run diesel record was set on April 4, 2020, by Sean G. Petr, Jason Adkins, and Mark Spence. The team drove a 2014 Volkswagen Passat TDI across the country in an impressively fast 28 hours and 30 minutes. A truly impressive average of 25.5 mpg was achieved over the 2,852-mile trip, with an equally impressive 100.07 mph average.\n\nCannonball Run 3-Wheeled Vehicle Record\n\nThe three-wheeled vehicle record is held by Alex Roy and Zach Bowman is 41 hours and 49 minutes. They set the three-wheeled Cannonball Run record in a Morgan 3 Wheeler in 2015.\n\nCannonball Run EV Record\n\nThe electric vehicle record began in 1968 with the Great Transcontinental Electric Car Race that was planned by students at MIT and Caltech. In 1986, the Caltech team won with 210 hours and 3 minutes spanning from August 26 to September 4.\n\nThe current record holders are Ryan Levenson and Josh Allan in a rented (off Turo) Tesla Model S Long Range in a time of 42 hours and 17 minutes, which was set on October 22, 2021. The only vehicle “modifications” were overinflated 19-inch Tesla Tempest wheels, and the team only used Waze for traffic and law enforcement detection.\n\nThis latest record beat the previous record by over 2 hours — Kyle Conner, Drew Peterson, and Tijmen Schreur driving a Porsche Taycan 4S (press loaner) in January 2021 in a time of 44 hours and 25 minutes. This record will continue to fall quickly as new EV tech is changing. Longer range, faster charging, and faster EV vehicles are all on the near horizon.\n\nCannonball Run Semi-Autonomous Vehicle Record\n\nThe semi-autonomous vehicle record began in 2015 when a Delphi self-driving car went coast-to-coast from San Francisco to New York over the span of 9 days.\n\nLater that year, Alex Roy, Carl Reese, and Deena Mastracci set the actual semi-autonomous and electric Cannonball records in 57 hours and 48 minutes driving a Tesla Model S P85d electric sedan. Roy said the 2,995-mile run was done 96.1% using autopilot.\n\nThe following year, on August 24, 2016, Alex Roy, Warren Ahner, and Franz Aliquio reset the semi-autonomous Cannonball Run record of just 55 hours, in a 2016 Tesla Model S90d.\n\nA full 8 years later, the record has been once again reset, but with an unlikely vehicle. On April 13, 2024, Jay and Gypsy Roberts set the semi-autonomous Cannonball Run record at 43 hours and 18 minutes in a 2017 Toyota Prius equipped with a Comma.ai driver assistance system. This run is the first to have a verifiable hands-free driving time, with a 98.416% hands-free run.\n\nCannonball Run Solar Record\n\nThe Cannonball Sun team designed and built the ‘Sun Strider’ solar car specifically to make a Cannonball run. It took two attempts in the span of three years, but the 5 person team set the Cannonball run solar-powered record on July 21, 2024, at 4:42 p.m. PT. The record now stands at 13 days, 15 hours and 19 minutes.\n\nThe previous record, and the only other known Cannonball solar attempt, took 57 days. It was accomplished in a Tesla Y with a trunk full of portable solar panels in 2023. You can check out the Solar Cannonball Run YouTube channel to see all the details of the run.\n\nOverall Coast-to-Coast Records\n\nBesides the Cannonball Run, which is from the Red Ball in New York City to the Portofino in California, there is also an outright coast-to-coast, or transcontinental, record that is hotly contested. This route is shorter — at about 2,565 miles. It is usually from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Diego. It is called the “Southern Route,” “Southern Run,” or “Old Spanish Trail.”\n\nCoast-to-Coast Overall Record\n\nIn a Christmas miracle, Arne Toman, Doug Tabbutt, and David Simpson in a 2015 Mercedes E63s AMG — on December 25-26, 2018 — set a mind-boggling cross-country driving time of 24 hours flat. They managed this incredible time even after spending well over a half-hour total on the side of roads in three states getting pulled over for speeding, and receiving two substantial tickets.\n\nCoast-to-Coast Solo Record\n\nBronson Justice set the solo outright record at 25 hours and 35 minutes in a Dodge Charger on October 4, 2020.\n\nCoast-to-Coast Nonstop Record\n\nThe nonstop record is currently at 27 hours and 13 minutes by Steve Brown in a 2014 GMC Sierra on March 21, 2020.\n\nCoast-to-Coast Semi-Autonomous Record\n\nIn April 2024, Jay Roberts and Mason Dibley established a semi-autonomous Spanish Trail/coast-to-coast record of 32 hours 56 minutes, with 97.432% hands-free driving in a 2017 Toyota Prius with Comma.ai driver assistance system.\n\nCoast-to-Coast Motorcycle Record\n\nA coast-to-coast motorcycle record was set by Axe Dekruif in a time of 33 hours and 10 minutes. It was done on a BMW S1000RR with an extra fuel tank while drinking a Red Bull/Gatorade mixture in a CamelBak, and using a Flir thermal imaging camera for night driving. Axe averaged 72.6 mph on his cross-country run and produced a documentary (No Limits — No Regrets) on his adventure.\n\nIn June 2022, a new coast-to-coast motorcycle record was set at 28 hours and 42 minutes by Andrew Pieper on a 1999 Honda Blackbird 1100xx.\n\nThe current coast-to-coast motorcycle record was set on August 26-27, 2023, at 28 hours and 28 minutes by Jacob Scroggs on a Harley-Davidson. Scroggs’s route from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Diego covered 2,375 miles, at an average of 83.3 mph.\n\nCannonball Run Movies & Books\n\nFilms\n\nThe Gumball Rally (1976)\n\nThis movie is inspired by the 1975 Cannonball Run record by Jack May and Rick Cline that broke Yates’ and Gurney’s record by a mere 60 seconds. While “The Gumball Rally” is entirely fictional, the film is hilarious, speedy, and a wonderful watch.\n\nThe Cannonball Run (1981) & Cannonball Run II (1984)\n\nWhile both of these films are completely fictional, the fictitious nature contributes to the magnificence of the race itself. Watching these movies will not provide you with any historical context, but they are a fun watch with famous actors and actresses including Burt Reynolds and Farrah Fawcett. “The Cannonball Run” and “Cannonball Run II” are sold as a box set on Amazon.\n\nAPEX: The Secret Race Across America (2019)\n\nShifting back and forth between the perspectives and experiences of those involved in the 1983 U.S. Express and the 2006 unsanctioned Cannonball Run, this film transports the viewer into a front-row seat for the infamous race. Beginning with a brief history of the Cannonball Run, the film then shifts into first-person recounts of the races.\n\nMore than anything, this film reveals the preparation and determination it took for the 2006 team of Alex Roy and David Maher to successfully beat a record held by Doug Turner and David Diem that stood for nearly 20 years.\n\nYou will see the lengths and methods that Roy and Maher used. They would hide behind 18-wheelers, turn off their headlights to avoid being seen, and stay in constant contact with a small airplane hovering over them.\n\nDuring the run, at one point, the radio completely stopped working. At the same time, you see the humanity of both Roy and Maher, like the moment when they stop off at a Burger King drive-thru to get food while on the Cannonball Run. Of course, you may wonder, “Why didn’t they just pack food?” But who knows, when you want chicken fries, you want chicken fries.\n\nYou can purchase the film, “APEX: The Secret Race Across America” to stream via Prime Video or iTunes. The APEX website notes, “APEX shatters the myths surrounding the transcontinental record and shows never-before-seen footage from the Cannonball, U.S. Express, and modern runs.”\n\nBooks\n\nCannonball! World’s Greatest Outlaw Road Race by Brock Yates\n\nPublished in 2003, “Cannonball!” was the first book written about the Cannonball Run.\n\nIn the 1970s, Brock Yates was the senior editor of Car and Driver Magazine. But, that was not the only thing he was up to — Yates created the Cannonball Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash.\n\nNot only is this book full of incredible stories of the Cannonball Run, but it also contains photographs from many legendary moments. Written by one of the most well-known car journalists whose impact is still reaching car enthusiasts today, “Cannonball!” is sure to impress.\n\nThe Driver: My Dangerous Pursuit of Speed and Truth in the Outlaw Racing World by Alexander Roy\n\nAlexander Roy beat the Cannonball Run Record in 2006 after the record stood for nearly 20 years. “The Driver” is Roy’s memoir, reflecting on all of his daring races across the world.\n\nAll of the races in his life prepared him to beat the Cannonball record, driving from New York to Los Angeles in 32 hours and 7 minutes. This book provides a compelling and deeply interesting look at the story behind Roy’s motivations and experiences.\n\nFOR THE RECORD: 28:50 A Journey Toward Self-Discovery and the Cannonball Run Record by Ed Bolian\n\nPublished in 2017, Ed Bolian, a natural-born storyteller and racer, writes a memoir that speaks about more than the logistics surrounding beating the Cannonball Run record. This book intertwines fascinating car stories and Bolian’s grappling with his faith, and it explores what led him to have the desire to become the next record-holder for the Cannonball Run.\n\nReality Is More Interesting Than Fiction\n\nTo most, the prospect of participating in this race might as well be a fairytale … or a nightmare. The Cannonball Run is a very real race that has stood the test of time because of some crazy, driven people who keep wanting to beat the record.\n\nAfter reading this article, perhaps you want to go on a Cannonball Run bender and read every book and watch every movie you can find. Or, perhaps you want to scratch that racing itch of yours, one way or another. If you love the thrill but hate the actual danger, we suggest refining your driving skills at a performance driving school, at a track day, or on the computer or simulator. Quenching your need for speed in these outlets won’t put the crosshairs of the law on you, like a Cannonball Run will.\n\nWhen asked what defined the Cannonball Run, Alex Roy answered, “Politics. Defiance. Endurance. Speed. Struggle. No stopping except for fuel and repairs. A route from coast-to-coast. An icepick in the face of convention.”\n\nThe Cannonball Run is an example of when the realities of life end up being more fascinating than fiction."
