        "text": "Prime Video carries over 26,000 TV shows and movies—so where do you start? We have some recommendations.\n\nGet Amazon Prime Video now\n\nBy Bill Frost and Olivia Bono\n\nAug 1, 2024 | Share\n\nNew on Amazon Prime Video in August 2024\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader (August 1)\n\nInfluenced (August 1)\n\nJudy Justice (August 5)\n\nThe Mallorca Files (August 8)\n\nOne Fast Move (August 8)\n\nThe Shakedown (August 8)\n\nNadie Nos Va a Extrañar (August 9)\n\nJackpot (August 15)\n\nClassified (August 22)\n\nNo Gain, No Love (August 26)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (August 29)\n\nAmazon Prime Video, one of the biggest on-demand streaming services in both reach and quantity of content, is slowly establishing itself as a competitor for original TV shows and movies. It’s no threat to Netflix or Hulu in terms of sheer numbers, but Prime Video is slowly catching up.\n\nFor every hit like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Boys, there are several Prime Video originals you probably haven’t heard of—like Electric Dreams, Prime Video’s solid-but-little-seen answer to Netflix’s Black Mirror. With the exception of Thursday Night Football and the streamer’s $465 million Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power series, most Prime Video content is under the pop-culture radar.\n\nBut we know what’s prime on Prime: Here are some of our favorite TV shows and movies currently on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nJump to:\n\nRecommended TV shows on Prime Video\n\nRecommended movies on Prime Video\n\nMore recommended shows on Prime Video (by genre)\n\nBest shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel | Comedy, drama\n\nPrime Video’s most recognizable original, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is a charming, fast-talking slice of 1950s/’60s Americana that’s won countless awards over five seasons. New York housewife Miriam “Midge” Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) stumbles into a standup comedy career, much to the dismay of her upper-middle-class Jewish family and, well, everyone. If nothing else, check it out for Midge’s dazzling array of period-perfect outfits.\n\nThe Boys | Action, drama\n\nAfter a decade of blockbuster superhero movies featuring (mostly) infallible good guys, a dark backlash was inevitable—but we didn’t expect it would be this dark. The Boys presents a world wherein superheroes are narcissistic, unstable pawns of corporate interests, with one vigilante group (the titular Boys) bent on taking them down. The Boys evenly balances ultra-violence and dark comedy, and Antony Starr’s anti-Superman Homelander is terrifying. Also check out The Boys‘ spinoff series, Gen V.\n\nDead Ringers | Drama, thriller\n\nThis gender-flipped miniseries take on David Cronenberg’s 1988 classic Dead Ringers might be even better than the original. Rachel Weisz inhabits the Jeremy Irons role(s) as Beverly and Elliot Mantle, twin OBGYNs who share everything (drugs, lovers, etc.), including a (somewhat warped) mission to push the boundaries of fertility science. Dead Ringers is Weisz at her actorly best, which is saying something\n\nWilderness | Drama, thriller\n\nBritish couple Liv (Jenna Coleman) and Will (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) are happily married New Yorkers—but then Will has an affair. To help make up for it, Will proposes a romantic cross-country trip through America’s national parks, but Liv has an agenda: Revenge (so many ways to “accidentally” perish in the Wilderness). The scenery is gorgeous, the tension burns, and you won’t guess what comes next.\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six | Drama\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six is essentially The Fleetwood Mac Story, but it takes the usual rise-and-fall story of a 1970s rock band (fronted by Riley Keough and Sam Claflin) to glittering and sometimes surprising new heights. The cast even sings and plays instruments themselves, performing original songs by Phoebe Bridgers, Jackson Browne, and other artists who aren’t Stevie Nicks or Lindsay Buckingham.\n\nThe English | Drama, Western\n\nLady Cornelia Locke (Emily Blunt, the titular English) is out for revenge for her murdered son in 1890s Wyoming, with the help of a Pawnee scout (Chaske Spencer). The English is a beautifully-filmed-but-violent vengeance thriller, filmed in Spain (not Wyoming) and written/directed by a Brit (Hugo Blick). It’s a classic Western, right down to the opening credits and dusty soundtrack, and Blunt’s performance in The English is a career-best.\n\nThe Expanse | Drama, sci-fi\n\nThe Expanse was too sci-fi for even the Syfy channel, which canceled it after three seasons, leading Prime Video to pick it up for three more. Even after humanity has colonized the entire solar system (aka the Expanse), class struggles and cold war tensions still prevail—the utopian future of Star Trek, this isn’t. The Expanse has been called “Game of Thrones in space,” and the dense writing and stunning cinematography back it up.\n\nGoliath | Drama, thriller\n\nAfter 40 years in the film business, Billy Bob Thornton finally landed a TV character to rival Sling Blade and Bad Santa: Billy McBride, a scrappy Los Angeles lawyer who litigates truth to power from his hotel home/office on the Santa Monica Pier. Show creator David E. Kelley knows legal drama, and Goliath’s supporting cast (including Tony-winner Nina Arianda and Lost’s Tanya Raymonde) is as compelling as its villains (like William Hurt, Mark Duplass, and Dennis Quaid).\n\nView Amazon Prime Video plans\n\nMore of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nCarnival Row\n\nElectric Dreams\n\nGood Omens\n\nHomecoming\n\nInvincible\n\nJack Ryan\n\nReacher\n\nThe Rig\n\nThem\n\nUpload\n\nShows and movies stuck buffering? Could be your internet connection.\n\nEnter your zip code to find a better internet plan in your area.\n\nPlease enter a valid zip code.\n\nBest movies on Amazon Prime Video\n\nCandy Cane Lane | Comedy, fantasy\n\nA good Christmas movie can be enjoyed any time of the year, and Candy Cane Lane certainly qualifies. In this fantastical riff on The 12 Days of Christmas, Chris (Eddie Murphy) strikes a deal with a devilish rogue elf (Jillian Bell) to win a holiday home decorating contest, with spectacularly disastrous results. The Christmas comedy also stars Tracee Ellis Ross, Nick Offerman, and David Alan Greer as Santa himself.\n\nTotally Killer | Comedy, horror\n\nGood Halloween flicks also never go out of season. In the hilarious Totally Killer, teen Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) encounters the “Sweet 16 Killer,” a knife-wielding psycho who carved up three kids decades ago. One weird science moment later, Jamie is transported back to 1987. She deduces that if she can stop the serial killer before he ever strikes, she can make her way back to the present (sounds legit).\n\nJolt | Action, comedy\n\nLindy (Kate Beckinsale) suffers from murderous rage episodes that can only be controlled by electrical shocks to her system—hence, the title Jolt (Crank was taken). When her boyfriend turns up dead, she’s the prime suspect, which only slightly hinders her revenge mission to get the real killers. If the idea of Beckinsale pummeling thugs twice her size sounds ludicrous, you’ve obviously forgotten Underworld.\n\nThe Kids in the Hall: Comedy Punks | Documentary, comedy\n\nGen-Xers (and newbie fans), rejoice! The Kids are back with new shows and an amazing new documentary. With celebrity-comedian talking heads, archival footage, and exclusive interviews, we highly recommend “crushing” Amazon Prime Video’s documentary revival of our favorite comedy punks from the late ’80s and early ’90s.\n\nSound of Metal | Drama\n\nFilm festival favorite Sound of Metal follows the downward aural spiral of noise-rock drummer Ruben (Riz Ahmed), a recovering drug addict who begins to lose his hearing while on tour. Sound of Metal, which makes pointed use of stark silence, has been nominated for over 40 film awards since its 2019 release, and it won two Oscars in 2021.\n\nI’m Your Woman | Drama, thriller\n\nIn a critically praised departure from her Marvelous Mrs. Maisel character, Rachel Brosnahan plays a 1970s wife and mother on the run thanks to the criminal activities of her husband in I’m Your Woman. The tense neo-noir thriller rounds one unpredictable turn after another, culminating in the closest thing to a happy ending possible here.\n\nThe Vast of Night | Sci-fi, thriller\n\nAndrew Patterson’s directorial debut The Vast of Night was filmed for just $700,000, but it has the technical and emotional ambitions of a mega-budget blockbuster. Small-town teens in 1950s New Mexico discover an alien invasion through radio frequencies, as well as a conspiracy to downplay the existence of UFOs. The Vast of Night is worth experiencing for the cinematography alone.\n\nSomebody I Used to Know | Comedy, romance\n\nAfter the cancelation of her show, L.A. TV producer Ally (Allison Brie) returns to her quaint hometown to get herself together but then runs into her ex-boyfriend (Jay Ellis). The sparks are still there, but Ally finds out that Jay is engaged to Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons), a free-spirited woman who reminds her of when she was “cool.” Brie co-wrote Somebody I Used to Know with her husband, Dave Franco, and it’s not the predictable rom-com it looks like on the surface.\n\nGimme Danger | Documentary, music\n\nGimme Danger, about the rise and fall of ’60s/’70s proto-punk cult band The Stooges, isn’t your typical rock documentary—because singer Iggy Pop isn’t your typical rock star. Director Jim Jarmusch blends archival footage, interviews, and cutout animation into an appropriately ragged ransom note of a storyline. Gimme Danger is a punk-perfect portrait of The Stooges.\n\nView Amazon Prime Video plans\n\nMore of the best movies on Amazon Prime Video\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nBrittany Runs a Marathon\n\nComing 2 America\n\nThe Goldfinch\n\nHalston\n\nMy Spy\n\nSaltburn\n\nSylvie’s Love\n\nTom Clancy’s Without Remorse\n\nUncle Frank\n\nWant more TV recommendations?\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay tuned for the latest recommendations plus deals, contests, and more.\n\nEmail*\n\nZip code*\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy & Terms and Conditions.\n\nBest Amazon Prime Video original series\n\nThe Boys\n\nThe Expanse\n\nFortitude\n\nInvincible\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nGoliath\n\nGood Omens\n\nHunters\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nThe Wheel of Time\n\nBest food and travel shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nChasing Zephyr: Iconic Islands\n\nDiscovering the World\n\nFluffy’s Food Adventures\n\nFood Safari\n\nThe Foodie\n\nMy Greatest Dishes\n\nRick Steves’ Europe\n\nA Taste of Travel\n\nThe Travel Detective\n\nTruly Texas Mexican\n\nBest true crime shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nBecoming Evil: Serial Killers\n\nBuzzfeed Unsolved: True Crime\n\nThe Devil You Know\n\nForensic Files\n\nI Don’t Like Mondays\n\nKiller Mysteries\n\nLorena\n\nLove Fraud\n\nMurdertown\n\nThere Are No Fakes\n\nBest reality TV shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Amazing Race\n\nChanging Rooms\n\nGown and Out in Beverly Hills\n\nMaking the Cut\n\nMarried at First Sight\n\nNext Big Thing NYC\n\nThe Pack\n\nSavage X Fenty Show\n\nStorage Wars\n\nThe Ultimate Mixologist\n\nView Amazon Prime Video plans\n\nBest sci-fi shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nCounterpart\n\nDominion\n\nThe Expanse\n\nFalling Water\n\nFringe\n\nHeroes\n\nHumans\n\nInvincible\n\nStar Trek\n\nWarehouse 13\n\nBest documentaries on Amazon Prime Video\n\nAmerican Playboy\n\nThe Booksellers\n\nGeneration Wealth\n\nGimme Danger\n\nHalston\n\nAmerican Tragedy\n\nThe Last Narc\n\nLong Strange Trip\n\nPink: All I Know\n\nStop Making Sense\n\nBest LGBTQ+ shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nArizona Sky\n\nBe Mine\n\nEating Out\n\nGay USA\n\nGays in Prison\n\nIntersexion\n\nA Luv Tale\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nTrans\n\nTransparent\n\nView Amazon Prime Video plans\n\nBest kids’ shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nBookaboo\n\nBubble Guppies\n\nClifford the Big Red Dog\n\nDanger & Eggs\n\nDora the Explorer\n\nKung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny\n\nPeppa Pig\n\nPete the Cat\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants\n\nThe Stinky & Dirty Show\n\nBest anime shows on Amazon Prime Video\n\nBlue Submarine No. 6\n\nElfin Lied\n\nGirls’ Last Tour\n\nLights of the Clione\n\nLove and Lies\n\nRWBY\n\nSamurai Pizza Cats\n\nSamurai Troopers\n\nVinland Saga\n\nYu-Gi-Oh!\n\nView Amazon Prime Video plans\n\nWhat to Watch on Amazon Prime Video FAQ\n\nAre there any good series on Amazon Prime Video?\n\nAmazon Prime Video features an always-growing slate of excellent and award-winning original series, including The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Boys, The Wheel of Time, The Expanse, Good Omens, Reacher, and over 50 more.\n\nIs Game of Thrones on Amazon Prime Video?\n\nGame of Thrones episodes and full seasons are available to purchase through Prime Video but aren’t included with a Prime Video subscription. Episodes start at $2.99 each, and full seasons range from $19.99 to $24.99. It would be less expensive to subscribe to HBO Max ($9.99–$14.99 a month) to watch all eight seasons of Game of Thrones.\n\nWhat is the most-watched show on Amazon Prime Video?\n\nIn early 2022, the most-watched show on Prime Video is action-drama Reacher, based on the Jack Reacher book series. Prior to that, The Wheel of Time fantasy series was the most popular Prime Video series. In fall 2022, Prime Video’s biggest series is The Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power, with a reported 25 million+ viewers.\n\nHow can I watch Amazon Prime Video for free?\n\nAmazon Prime Video offers new customers a 30-day free trial, then reverts to its typical price of $8.99–$14.99/mo. or $139.00/yr.. If you want to immediately watch some Amazon Prime favorites at no cost, check out Freevee. Freevee is a free, ad-supported streaming service that serves up previously-released TV shows and movies for free (but with ads)."
