        "text": "Kim Kardashian is already reality TV royalty and now the Hulu star is set to take on yet another scripted role. Netflix announced on November 26, ​2023, that the Skims founder is set to star and produce in the upcoming film The Fifth Wheel, and Kim gave some insight into how she got the film off the ground on The Kardashians.\n\nWhat Is Kim Kardashian’s Role in ‘The Fifth Wheel’?\n\n“Kim Kardashian is about to be The Fifth Wheel,” Netflix tweeted at the time. “Kim will co-produce and star in an all-new comedy from producer and writer Paula Pell (SNL, Sisters) and writer Janine Brito (Girls5eva) — coming soon to Netflix!”\n\nDeadline reported the project before Netflix‘s confirmation on November 19, noting that Kim “has been very hands-on in the pitch for the female-driven comedy.”\n\nOn the June 20, 2024, episode of The Kardashians, Kim told her friends, “I just feel like I wasn’t planning on this career and I’m just, like, not going to get ahead of myself here. We sold a movie, it was amazing. So I’m doing that. I’m starring in it, producing it, and we sold it.”\n\nWhat Is Kim Kardashian’s ‘The Fifth Wheel’ About?\n\n“It’s a full comedy called The Fifth Wheel,” Kim explained on The Kardashians. “It’s four girls [going] on a trip. It’s, like, The Hangover, Bridesmaids, First Wives’ Club-ish. I was like, ‘I love the idea.’ We went to all the studios and everyone called within 20 minutes with offers.”\n\nWho Is in ‘The Fifth Wheel’ Cast?\n\nAside from Kim, no other cast members have been revealed yet. However, the SKKN founder teased that she hopes to have recognizable faces appear alongside her in the movie.\n\n“[The studios] just loved all the characters,” Kim told her agent on The Kardashians. “They were, like, laughing out loud. They were like, ‘What I love about this is the heart.’ And at the end, I was like, ‘Listen guys, we have so much going on here, so unless we’re going to be the biggest commercial movie and break the internet and have the best f–king cast ever, I don’t have time.’”\n\nNetflix teased new information about the upcoming film in their 2023 press release and ​told fans to keep their “eyes peeled for more information on The Fifth Wheel as it gears up to enter production.”\n\n“Just think, soon we’ll be able to tell you who the other four wheels are,” the statement read, in reference of the remaining unknown leads. “And catch the new comedy coming soon, only to Netflix.\n\nWhat TV Shows and Films Has Kim Kardashian Starred In?\n\nThe beauty mogul’s most recent acting gig was her role as Siobhan Walsh in American Horror Story: Delicate. The FX horror series premiered on September 20, 2023, and Kim pleasantly surprised viewers with her acting skills as she portrayed the wicked celebrity publicist who works for Anna (played by Emma Roberts).\n\nThe former E! star grabbed fans’ attention in her opening scene on the show. ​Kim was captured on the phone while juggling Anna’s climb to stardom, saying, “Then tell the Daniels to suck my c–t, she’s not missing a press day for a f–king commercial shoot.” After starting off strong, fans praised Kim for her improved acting skills throughout the season of American Horror Story.\n\nThe billionaire businesswoman, for her part, couldn’t contain her excitement about filming. “It’s really fun to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new and grow. I’m so excited for the experience,” she gushed ​while attending the 2023 Met Gala. “We start shooting my stuff at the end of this month. But production has already started, and I’m so excited.”\n\nIt was this role that helped propel Kim’s acting career. After working with Ryan Murphy on AHS, he pitched her an idea for another television show where she would play a successful divorce lawyer who runs an all-female law firm. The legal drama is in the works at Hulu.\n\nPlus, she already has more movies on the brain. “I can do a movie a year,” she said in June 2024. “I’ve got about 10 years where I still look good, so that’s all I’ve got in me. And then I’ll take some time off. That’s my 10-year plan.”\n\nKim isn’t the only movie star in the family. In fact, the aspiring lawyer was joined by eldest kids North West and Saint West for their roles in the animated film Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie. North and Saint joined the pup crew as characters Mini and Meteor Man while their A-list mother reprised her role as chic poodle Delores."
