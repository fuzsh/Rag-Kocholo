Especially in these times, when catching a movie at the cinema or meeting with our friends for a beer or coffee is not as simple as it used to be, we need as much entertainment at home as possible. Whether you’re more into comedy, drama or thrillers, there will certainly be something for you in the list below. Enjoy!\n\nThe Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\n\nPortrayed by Leslie Nielsen, Frank Drebin is a rather incompetent police detective who, already dealing with a complex heroin trafficking case, must come up with a plan to kill Queen Elizabeth II during her upcoming visit to Los Angeles. In a twist of fate, Norberg (O.J. Simpson), his partner, is shot, and Frank goes after the culprit, meeting tycoon Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban) and falling in love with his assistant Jane (Priscilla Presley) in the process. If you’re looking for a classical comedy, this one’s for you.\n\nThe French Connection\n\nSet in New York, this action thriller directed by William Friedkin tells the story of police detectives Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy “Cloudy” Russo (Roy Scheider), who are trying to intercept a massive heroin shipment coming from France. Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a rather gentle and likeable man who (spoiler alert!) turns out to be one of the largest suppliers of heroin to North America, is the mastermind behind the operation. This movie is remembered for having included one of the most fascinating car chase sequences in the history of American filmmaking.\n\nSeven\n\nRight before retiring, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) works on a final case with the help of recently transferred Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together, they go after a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world’s ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. In the process, Somerset befriends Mill’s wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is pregnant and nervous about the prospect of raising a child in such a violent environment.\n\nIn The Heat Of The Night\n\nCaught in the heat of the racial tension in the American South, Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is mistakenly arrested while waiting for his train at a station in Sparta, Mississippi. He was thought to be the architect of a high-profile businessman’s murder. Once the confusion was resolved, it emerged that he is actually Philadelphia’s most prominent homicide expert. Reluctantly, Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger), who heads the local police, asks for his assistance. Tibbs agrees and takes a case that could put his life in great danger.\n\nLethal Weapon\n\nFaced with the sudden death of his wife in an accident, LAPD detective Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) becomes suicidal. Upon reassignment, he is partnered with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), an aging family man and veteran police officer whose only goal is to make it through the day unharmed. The duo is tasked with solving the recent murder of a banker’s daughter, but end up uncovering a dangerous ring of drug smugglers in which ex-military mercenaries are involved. The increasingly difficult situation forces these two antagonistic investigators to trust one another.\n\nDirty Harry\n\nDirected by John Siegel, this action thriller is based on the real life case of the Zodiac Killer, an American serial killer active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. Clint Eastwood portrays cop Harry Callahan, the main character, who attempts to go after a psychopathic rooftop killer before his next female victim is murdered. Due to the civil rights abuses perpetrated by Harry on the murderer, he is released. But once free, he continues to look for more victims, which leads Harry to realise that the only way to stop this ruthless killer is in cold blood.\n\nFargo\n\nSet in 1987, Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) investigates a series of roadside homicides that lead her to car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy). It then emerges that, as a desperate attempt to pay off his crippling debts, he plotted to kidnap his own wife with the help of two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare). The goal was to collect the ransom money from his wealthy father-in-law, but his plan ultimately collapses when the thugs shoot a state trooper.\n\nPatriots Day\n\nBased on the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, this film depicts Sargent Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) directing standard security operations during the annual event, when Dzokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev detonate two pressure cooker bombs. Chaos ensued and, while those injured are taken away to get medical attention, Saunders and his comrades join forces with the FBI to go after the Tsarnaev brothers. A city-wide manhunt is carried out and the perpetrators are captured while attempting to flee from Boston.\n\nSerpico\n\nLead character Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) is an idealistic NYPD officer who, unlike all of his colleagues, refuses a share of the money that is routinely extorted from local criminals by his colleagues. Because of this, no one wants to work with him and he is often placed in dangerous positions by the other officers. So once his accusations of corruption get ignored by his superiors, he decides to go public. An investigation into his claims is carried out, but Frank has a target placed on his back.\n\nHot Pursuit\n\nAfter an incident which involved San Antonio’s mayor being set on fire with a taser, Rose Cooper is reassigned to minor tasks. A chance to redeem herself comes when she is tasked with protecting a federal witness, Daniella Riva, the lively and outgoing widow of a drug boss. Initially, the pair fail to get along as a result of Cooper’s strict work ethic and Riva’s failure to understand the delicate situation they’re in. They ultimately find themselves fleeing from corrupt police officers and dangerous gunmen.\n\nWe hope you enjoy whichever movie you choose!
