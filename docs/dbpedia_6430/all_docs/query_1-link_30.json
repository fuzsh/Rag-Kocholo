        "text": "When it comes to heist movies, nobody does it better than Pierce Brosnan.\n\nThe super-suave former James Bond pilfered a priceless Monet from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1999's \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" and even hosts History Channel's \"Greatest Heists With Pierce Brosnan.\" So it's no surprise that producer and star Adam Devine got a little verklempt after receiving the call that Brosnan, 70, had signed on to play his father-in-law in Netflix's new comedy heist flick \"The Out-Laws\" (streaming now).\n\n\"I was at a baseball game with my family and I literally got misty-eyed,\" says Devine, 39. \"My dad was like, 'Are you crying?' I was like, 'You have no idea who's doing the movie: James Bond himself.\"\n\nHere's what the Brosnan hype is all about in \"The Out-Laws.\"\n\nPierce Brosnan can throw down the Adam Devine insults\n\nWe're a long way from \"Thomas Crown\" in \"Out-Laws,\" which features Devine as vault-obsessed, big-talking bank manager Owen Browning. Owen's surprised when his mysterious and intimidating future in-laws (Brosnan and Ellen Barkin) drop in for the first time just before his wedding, and more shocked when the couple turn out to be infamous bank robbers.\n\n\"Mrs. Doubtfire\" star Brosnan knows his comedy and came ready for improvisation. He had no problem coming up with the plethora of put-downs required for the blowhard Browning, who joins the thieves.\n\n'The Out-Lawsâ€™: How Netflix's movie demolished a cemetery without disturbing real graves\n\n\"Oh, there were turd jokes, shorty jokes. There were many, many insults thrown at the pasty little goober,\" he says. \"That was my (cutdown), by the way.\"\n\nThat made it in the movie. Another invective suggesting an unhealthy and unpublishable appreciation of sheep emerged from the Irish actor's mouth and astounded Devine.\n\n\"I've never heard anything like that expression in my entire life,\" Devine says. \"But that rolled off the tongue for old Pierce.\"\n\nPierce Brosnan and Adam Devine got close on 'The Out-Laws,' even sharing a screen kiss\n\nBrosnan was game for laughs, agreeing to smooch his future screen son-in-law right on the kisser as an awkward introduction when the two first meet.\n\n\"I tried to get out of the movie when I saw that part in the script,\" Brosnan jokes. \"Nah, I thought it was funny kissing his chubby little mush.\"\n\nDevine states the obvious about Brosnan: \"For all those wondering, great kisser.\" He adds that the scene \"is just as funny as we thought it would be in the movie.\"\n\nAnother memorable moment involved Devine diving into the driver's car window with Brosnan at the wheel of the getaway vehicle.\n\n\"The stunt guys didn't trust me with much, except for jumping in a car and hanging on,\" Devine says. \"They were like, it's way more funny and awkward when you do it. \"\n\nDevine was a little too energetic in the dive execution during some takes.\n\n\"Of course, you see him dive in, you see his legs sticking out the window, and his head lands right into my (lap),\" Brosnan says. \"They decided not to put that part in the movie.\"\n\nJames Bond definitely shows up in 'The Out-Laws'\n\nThere is a Bond joke in \"Out-Laws,\" which Devine encouraged by goofily posing with a squirt gun, 007-style. Barkin eventually took the bait and compared the dorky bank manager to James Bond.\n\n\"Which one?\" Brosnan asks in the scene.\n\n\"Five,\" says Barkin, which just happens to be Brosnan's turn at playing the superspy in the official Bond movies.\n\n\"Oh, that was a good one,\" Brosnan responds in the meta moment.\n\n\"I knew as soon as that was out of my mouth, that was in the picture.\"\n\nThe actor showed he can still throw punches in the required \"Out-Law\" fight scenes, and believably break into a safe. But Brosnan is at his best just bringing his 007 aura to a broad comedy - like a vegan bakery shootout that featured ridiculously exploding cakes.\n\n'Black Adam': Why Pierce Brosnan wore his own wedding ring as Dr. Fate 'which I never do'\n\nDirector Tyler Spindel tried to give Brosnan pointers for his character's gun-blasting bakery exit that would happen amid the cake carnage.\n\n\"I'm with the stunt guys trying to show Pierce the choreography and he just goes, 'Don't worry, I'll make it look cool,' \" Spindel says. \"And then Pierce just goes and does it and looked really cool. It was like, that's why he's a movie star.' \"\n\nPierce Brosnan honors 'GoldenEye' singer Tina Turner\n\nBrosnan recalls working with \"icon\" Tina Turner, who died at 83 in May. The pioneering rock 'n' soul star sang the theme \"GoldenEye\" (written by U2's Bono and The Edge) for Brosnan's 1995 turn as Bond.\n\n\"She did a remarkable job, it's a beautiful song,\" says Brosnan, who paid tribute to Turner on Instagram with a throwback photo of the two side by side, meeting then-Prince Charles at the movie's premiere in London. \"I remember it as a joyful celebration. We were in a Bond movie.\""
