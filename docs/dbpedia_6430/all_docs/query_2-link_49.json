Permits, fees, and dates can be obtained from Fish & Wildlife Department: P.O. Box 1480, Window Rock, AZ 86515 or call (928) 871-6451.\n\nRespect the privacy and customs of the Navajo people.

Unless accompanied by a permit.\n\nOff-road Vehicles are Prohibited within the Navajo Tribal Park areas: Dune buggies, Jeeps, 4-wheel drive vehicles and modified Motorcycles are strictly Prohibited. Unnecessary trails or roads result in erosion to the fragile environment. All disturbance will be fined to the utmost extent. Per NN Law.\n\nHiking & Camping Rules\n\nThe Navajo Nation is composed of more than 25,000 square miles and offers hikers numerous isolated trails and routes. For the safety of hikers who enter the reservation and for the protection of natural and cultural resources, the Parks and Recreation Department has implemented guidelines for backcountry use, you must have a permit at all times while on the nation.\n\nThe trails are not improved or maintained, and are usually marked with rock claims. To reach the trailheads, topographic maps and drives over rough roads are required. Roads can become impassible in wet weather, and conditions can change quickly. Travelers are cautioned to be prepared. To ensure having an enjoyable experience, plan your trip carefully. Most trails are rated strenuous to moderately strenuous, and good physical conditioning is important. Many Navajo families still live on the reservation annually. Please be respectful of homesites and animals in these areas. The terrain is rough, water is scarce and the weather is often extreme in most areas. Let someone know where you are at all times, sign in or contact your local park office.\n\nIn summer, the trails are hot and dry; in winter, elevations make them subject to severe cold and high winds. Due to the quick changes in the weather, be aware of the dangers of flash floods. While this danger is greatest during the summer monsoon season (July through September), flash floods can occur at any time of the year. You use the trails and backcountry at your own risk. Navajo Parks and Recreation is not liable for any injuries, accidents, or theft while on the Navajo Nation. Please be safe and knowledgeable of area before departure. Make sure you camp-in, camp-out all material. Leave No Trace.\n\nGeneral Areas of Trails and Routes\n\nThere are a number of trails and routes being used by hikers from the Little Colorado Gorge: from Cameron to the confluence within the Colorado River, Marble Canyon bordering the Navajo Nation from Lee’s Ferry to the confluence of the Little Colorado River, side canyons of the San Juan River bordering the Navajo Reservation from Sand Island to Paiute Farms Wash, and the Rainbow Bridge trails around Navajo Mountain. Navajos consider Navajo Mountain a sacred area, and ascending it is forbidden. All Navajo Tribal Park scenic areas are considered sacred sites and are protected by NN Law.\n\nPlease be advised that Grand Falls is currently Closed to Public due to debris build up in the area. Please call Leupp Chapter for more information (928) 686-3227.\n\nHiking is allowed in the following areas only and requires a Backcountry Hiking & Camping Permit from the Navajo Tribal Park:\n\nRainbow Bridge Trail\n\nLittle Colorado River\n\nBowl Canyon Recreation Area\n\nSan Juan River\n\nMonument Valley (primitive campsite)\n\nAreas Closed to Hiking/Backcountry: Recently, the Kaibeto Chapter community has prohibited hiking and camping in the entire area of Upper Kaibeto, Navajo Canyon, Choal Canyon, Kaibeto Creek, Peach Wash, and Butterfly Canyon. Also, the area around the Inscription House community and Tsegi Canyon (Dowozhiebeto and Long Canyons) are Closed. These closures are due to trespassing across residential areas.\n\nTRESPASSING, ABSENCE OF PERMITS, DISTURBING LIVESTOCK, LITTERING, AND THE POSSIBLE DISTURBANCE OF FRAGILE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RUINS WILL RESULT IN LEGAL ACTION FROM NAVAJO AUTHORITIES. NN Laws will be strictly enforced.\n\nEmergency Contact\n\nDue to the isolation of these trails, rescue operations are not readily available. Remember that the majority of hiker fatalities occur with lone hikers. If a hiker is injured, this leaves no one to go for help if you encounter trouble. Beware of potential problems and be prepared to do something about them. Never hike alone, if you are going to hike on Navajo Tribal Park areas please inform someone of your whereabouts and stay informed of inclement weather.\n\nCoconino County Sheriff’s Office: 1-800-338-7888\n\nArizona State Patrol: 1-800-525-5555\n\nWahweap-Glen Canyon Recreation Area: (928) 608-6200\n\nNavajo Nation Ranger Headquarters: (928) 871-6701\n\nNavajo Nation Law Enforcement Offices:\n\nWindow Rock District: (928) 871-7544\n\nTuba City District: (928) 283-3111\n\nKayenta District: (928) 697-5600\n\nChinle District: (928) 674-2111\n\nGuided Tours\n\nA permit is required by the Navajo Nation from any person conducting or providing guided tour services of any kind within the Navajo Tribal Parks.
