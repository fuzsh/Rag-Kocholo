It is found on the walls of Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries in the Indo-Tibetan region, to help both Buddhists and non Buddhists understand the core Buddhist teachings. The image consists of four concentric circles, held by Yama, the lord of Death, with an image of the Buddha pointing to the moon metaphysically representing the possibility for liberation from the suffering of reincarnation.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nBhavachakra, \"wheel of life,\"[a] consists of the words bhava and chakra.\n\nbhava (‡§≠‡§µ) means \"being, worldly existence, becoming, birth, being, production, origin\".[web 1]\n\nIn Buddhism, bhava denotes the continuity of becoming (reincarnating) in one of the realms of existence, in the samsaric context of rebirth, life and the maturation arising therefrom.[2] It is the tenth of the Twelve Nidanas, in its Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda doctrine.[3]\n\nThe word Chakra (‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞) derives from the Sanskrit word meaning \"wheel,\" as well as \"circle\" and \"cycle\".[4]\n\nThe term chakra is also used to denote yantras (mystic diagrams), variously known as triko·πáa-cakra, a·π£·π≠ako·πáa-cakra, etc.\n\nChakras are also part of the subtle body as taught by Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nLegend has it that the historical Buddha himself created the first depiction of the bhavachakra, and the story of how he gave the illustration to King RudrƒÅya·πáa appears in the anthology of Buddhist narratives called the DivyƒÅvadƒÅna. Sahasodgata-avadƒÅna, in the opening paragraphs of the work, describes the Buddha's instructions for creating the bhavachakra.[5]\n\nExplanation of the diagram\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bhavachakra is painted on the outside walls of nearly every Tibetan Buddhist temple in Tibet and India, to instruct non-monastic audience about the Buddhist teachings.[6][7]\n\nElements of the bhavachakra\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bhavachakra consists of the following elements:\n\nThe pig, rooster and snake in the hub of the wheel represent the three poisons of ignorance, attachment and aversion.\n\nThe second layer represents karma.\n\nThe third layer represents samsara and its Six Paths.\n\nThe fourth layer represents the twelve links of dependent origination.\n\nThe fierce figure holding the wheel represents impermanence. It is also Yama, the god of death.[8]\n\nThe moon above the wheel represents liberation from samsara or cyclic existence.\n\nThe Buddha pointing to the white circle indicates that liberation is possible.\n\nSymbolically, the three inner circles, moving from the center outward, show that the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion give rise to positive and negative actions; these actions and their results are called karma. Karma in turn gives rise to the six realms, which represent the different types of suffering within samsara.\n\nThe fourth and outer layer of the wheel symbolizes the twelve links of dependent origination; these links indicate how the sources of suffering that the three poisons and karma produce live within cyclic existence.\n\nThe fierce being holding the wheel represents impermanence; this symbolizes that the entire process of samsara or cyclic existence is impermanent, transient, constantly changing. The moon above the wheel indicates liberation. The Buddha is pointing to the moon, indicating that liberation from samsara is possible.[9][10]\n\nHub: the three poisons\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the hub of the wheel are three animals: a pig, a snake, and a bird. They represent the three poisons of ignorance, aversion, and attachment, respectively. The pig stands for ignorance; this comparison is based on the Indian concept of a pig being the most foolish of animals, since it sleeps in the dirtiest places and eats whatever comes to its mouth. The snake represents aversion or anger; this is because it will be aroused and strike at the slightest touch. The bird represents attachment (also translated as desire or clinging). The particular bird used in this diagram represents an Indian bird that is very attached to its partner. These three animals represent the three poisons, which are the core of the bhavachakra. From these three poisons, the whole cycle of existence evolves.[11][12]\n\nIn many drawings of the wheel, the snake and bird are shown as coming out of the mouth of the pig, indicating that aversion and attachment arise from ignorance. The snake and bird are also shown grasping the tail of the pig, indicating that they in turn promote greater ignorance.[12]\n\nUnder the influence of the three poisons, beings create karma, as shown in the next layer of the circle.\n\nSecond layer: karma\n\n[edit]\n\nThe second layer of the wheel shows two-half circles:\n\nOne half-circle (usually light) shows contented people moving upwards to higher states, possibly to the higher realms.\n\nThe other half-circle (usually dark) shows people in a miserable state being led downwards to lower states, possibly to the lower realms.\n\nThese images represent karma, the law of cause and effect. The light half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of positive actions. The dark half-circle indicates people experiencing the results of negative actions.[12]\n\nRingu Tulku states:\n\nWe create karma in three different ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord with the quality of our actions.[13]\n\nPropelled by their karma, beings take rebirth in the six realms of samsara, as shown in the next layer of the circle.\n\nThird layer: the six realms of samsara\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Six Paths\n\nThe third layer of the wheel is divided into six sections that represent the six realms of samsara, or cyclic existence, the process of cycling through one rebirth after another. These six realms are divided into three higher realms and three lower realms. The wheel can also be represented as having five realms, combining the God realm and the Demi-god realm into a single realm.\n\nThe three higher realms are shown in the top half of the circle:\n\nGod realm (Deva): the gods lead long and enjoyable lives full of pleasure and abundance, but they spend their lives pursuing meaningless distractions and never think to practice the dharma. When death comes to them, they are completely unprepared; without realizing it, they have completely exhausted their good karma (which was the cause for being reborn in the god realm) and they suffer through being reborn in the lower realms.\n\nDemi-god realm (Asura): the demi-gods have pleasure and abundance almost as much as the gods, but they spend their time fighting among themselves or making war on the gods. When they make war on the gods, they always lose, since the gods are much more powerful. The demi-gods suffer from constant fighting and jealousy, and from being killed and wounded in their wars with each other and with the gods.\n\nHuman realm (Manu·π£ya): humans suffer from hunger, thirst, heat, cold, separation from friends, being attacked by enemies, not getting what they want, and getting what they do not want. They also suffer from the general sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death. Yet the human realm is considered to be the most suitable realm for practicing the dharma, because humans are not completely distracted by pleasure (like the gods or demi-gods) or by pain and suffering (like the beings in the lower realms).\n\nThe three lower realms are shown in the bottom half of the circle:\n\nAnimal realm (Tiryagyoni): wild animals suffer from being attacked and eaten by other animals; they generally lead lives of constant fear. Domestic animals suffer from being exploited by humans; for example, they are slaughtered for food, overworked, and so on.\n\nHungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts suffer from extreme hunger and thirst. They wander constantly in search of food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but by the time they get there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.\n\nHell realm (Naraka): hell beings endure unimaginable suffering for eons of time. In Buddhist cosmology there are eighteen different types of hells, each inflicting a different kind of torment. In the hot hells, beings suffer from unbearable heat and continual torments of various kinds. In the cold hells, beings suffer from unbearable cold and other torments.[14][15][16][17][18][19]\n\nAmong the six realms, the human realm is considered to offer the best opportunity to practice the dharma.[17] In some representations of the wheel, there is a buddha or bodhisattva depicted within each realm, trying to help sentient beings find their way to nirvana.\n\nThe outer rim of the wheel is divided into twelve sections that represent the Twelve NidƒÅnas. As previously stated, the three inner layers of the wheel show that the three poisons lead to karma, which leads to the suffering of the six realms. The twelve links of the outer rim show how this happens‚Äîby presenting the process of cause and effect in detail.[20][21]\n\nThese twelve links can be understood to operate on an outer or inner level.[22]\n\nOn the outer level, the twelve links can be seen to operate over several lifetimes; in this case, these links show how our past lives influence our current lifetime, and how our actions in this lifetime influence our future lifetimes.[22]\n\nOn the inner level, the twelve links can be understood to operate in every moment of existence in an interdependent manner.[23] On this level, the twelve links can be applied to show the effects of one particular action.[22]\n\nBy contemplating on the twelve links, one gains greater insight into the workings of karma; this insight enables us to begin to unravel our habitual way of thinking and reacting.[22][24][25]\n\nThe twelve causal links, paired with their corresponding symbols, are:\n\nAvidyƒÅ lack of knowledge ‚Äì a blind person, often walking, or a person peering out\n\nSa·πÉskƒÅra constructive volitional activity ‚Äì a potter shaping a vessel or vessels\n\nVij√±ƒÅna consciousness ‚Äì a man or a monkey grasping a fruit\n\nNƒÅmar≈´pa name and form (constituent elements of mental and physical existence) ‚Äì two men afloat in a boat\n\n·π¢a·∏çƒÅyatana six senses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind) ‚Äì a dwelling with six windows\n\nSpar≈õa contact (of objects with the senses) ‚Äì lovers consorting, kissing, or entwined\n\nVedanƒÅ feeling ‚Äì an arrow to the eye\n\nT·πõ·π£·πáa craving or thirst ‚Äì a drinker receiving drink\n\nUpƒÅdƒÅna grasping or attachment ‚Äì a man or a monkey picking fruit\n\nBhava coming to be ‚Äì a couple engaged in intercourse, a standing, leaping, or reflective person\n\nJƒÅti being born ‚Äì woman giving birth\n\nJarƒÅmara·πáa old age and death ‚Äì corpse being carried\n\nThe figure holding the wheel: impermanence\n\n[edit]\n\nThe wheel is being held by a fearsome figure who represents impermanence.[8]\n\nThis figure is often interpreted as being Mara, the demon who tried to tempt the Buddha, or as Yama, the lord of death. Regardless of the figure depicted, the inner meaning remains the same‚Äìthat the entire process of cyclic existence (samsara) is transient; everything within this wheel is constantly changing.[27]\n\nYama has the following attributes:\n\nHe wears a crown of five skulls that symbolize the impermanence of the five aggregates.[28] (The skulls are also said to symbolize the five poisons.)\n\nHe has a third eye that symbolizes the wisdom of understanding impermanence.[28]\n\nHe is sometimes shown adorned with a tiger skin, which symbolizes fearfulness.[28] (The tiger skin is typically seen hanging beneath the wheel.)\n\nHis four limbs (that are clutching the wheel) symbolize the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death.[29]\n\nThe moon: liberation\n\n[edit]\n\nAbove the wheel is an image of the moon; the moon represents liberation from the sufferings of samsara.[21][30][31] Some drawings may show an image of a \"pure land\" to indicate liberation, rather than a moon.\n\nThe Buddha pointing to the white circle: the path to liberation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe upper part of the drawing also shows an image of the Buddha pointing toward the moon; this represents the path to liberation.[21][30][31] While in Theravada Buddhism this is the Noble Eightfold Path, in Mahayana Buddhism this is the Bodhisattva path, striving to liberation for all sentient beings. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is Lamrim, which details all the stages on the path, while Zen has its own complicated history of the entanglement of meditation practice and direct insight.\n\nInscription\n\n[edit]\n\nDrawings of the Bhavachakra usually contain an inscription consisting of a few lines of text that explain the process that keeps people in samsara and how to reverse that process.[21]\n\nAlternative interpretations\n\n[edit]\n\nTheravada\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Theravada-tradition does not have a graphical representation of the round of rebirths, but cakra-symbolism is an elementary component of Buddhism, and Buddhaghosa's Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga) contains such imagery:\n\nIt is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the 'Wheel of the round of rebirths' (sa·πÉsƒÅracakka). Ignorance (avijjƒÅ) is its hub (or nave) because it is its root. Ageing-and-death (jarƒÅ-mara·πáa) is its rim (or felly) because it terminates it. The remaining ten links (of the Dependent Origination) are its spokes (i.e. karma formations [sa·πÖkhƒÅra] up to process of becoming [bhava]).[32]\n\nWestern psychological interpretation\n\n[edit]\n\nSome western interpreters take a psychological point of view, explaining that different karmic actions contribute to one's metaphorical existence in different realms, or rather, different actions reinforce personal characteristics described by the realms. According to Mark Epstein, \"each realm becomes not so much a specific place but rather a metaphor for a different psychological state, with the entire wheel becoming a representation of neurotic suffering.\"[33]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nA painting of the bhavachakra from Bhutan.\n\nA painting of the bhavachakra that depicts an emanation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara in each realm.\n\nA painting of the bhavachakra in Thikse Monastery, Ladakh.\n\nA traditional Tibetan thangka showing the bhavachakra.
