        "text": "Which one would you read first? I dont really care that First Law is much much shorter, and I know that Wheel of Time becomes somewhat slower around book 6-7, so which one?\n\nAlso, Would you recommend reading Wheel of Time at all?\n\nI'd say go with Wheel of Time, since it's doubtful that you'll go through it all in a row. So when you get tired, pick something else (First Law?) until you get the itch again to continue.\n\nAnd yes, it's recommended to be read.\n\nNeither of the offered choices appeal to me.\n\nIn truth, many of the 'classics' of the modern epic fantasy genre don't appeal to me. (Dune perhaps being the exception) I'm not even sure how a series can be a 'classic' if it's not finished.\n\nI think Wheel of Time is something that should be read BEFORE a lot of other authors (e.g. Martin, Hobb, Erikson, Bakker, Abercrombie, etc.)... so yeah, I recommend Wheel of Time.\n\nBesides, you have at least 5,000 pages before it starts to get bad.\n\nDon't read Wheel of Time at all, I say. Wheel of Time is glorified for being the complete opposite to what a story should be. However, there is a slight exception to the sentiment above: if ever you have trouble falling asleep one night, pull out Book 10 of WOT \"The Crossroads of Twilight\" and start reading. It's guaranteed that you'll be asleep in mere minutes.\n\nI've heard that expression before, but don't recall what it means. 'Twee'?\n\nQuaint, naff, cutesy, etc.\n\nI recently read a review of one of the WoT books which spoke of \"medievalised Bond villains, through which the lord of wickedness floats like a hydrogen-inflated mardi-gras person-shaped balloon\". It certainly accords with my impression of the villains I encountered in my valiant struggle through all of book one and most of book two of WoT. My own opinion is don't read WoT at all and dive straight into The First Law and then immediately onto Best Served Cold. But I've got no idea what Pajak's preferences are. To be fair to Jordan, based on my limited reading of WoT, if the OP enjoys intricate world building, traditional romantic adventure stories, and comfortable, warm prose then he or she should go with that.\n\nWheel of time has many faults, but it's still readable.\n\nWizards first law is horrible on so many level, it's not funny. It's like a 12 thousand pages long essay on how the author is great and anyone who disagree should be killed.\n\nHave you read any other fantasy by now?\n\nIf so, I would really recommend going straight to The First Law. Arkeus' post before me is somewhat confused, as he is mentioning some other book with completely mistaken name. Joe Abercrombie is JUST DAMN GREAT!!\n\nWheel of time, IMO, is good for starters. I started with it, but after book 6 or 7 it gets horrible. However, I am thankful for the parts that were interesting, as it made me a fantasy fan.\n\nHave you read any other fantasy by now?\n\nIf so, I would really recommend going straight to The First Law.

It's like a 12 thousand pages long essay on how the author is great and anyone who disagree should be killed.\n\nYou are mistaking Wizard's First Rule (written by the much-hated Terry Goodkind) with the First Law Trilogy (a well-received new series by a new author, Joe Abercrombie)."
