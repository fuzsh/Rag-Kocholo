        "text": "Ji-hong makes a run for it when he returns home and, after being chased by Joong-sik, falls over and dies. Confronted with his dire circumstances, Joong-sik slips the case into the boot of his car before calling in the death.\n\nThe police soon learn what prompted the strange ear-slicing crime. A mystery masked man with a muffled voice – a common K-drama trope these days – appears online, offering large sums of money to people if they commit specific violent crimes as dictated by his customised roulette wheel.\n\nAfter proving that he is good for the money by raining down a billion won from the sky, he spins the wheel again. This time the target is the notorious rapist and killer Kim Guk-ho (Yoo), who is about to be released from jail.\n\nThe prize is now 20 billion won (US$14.7 million), which he promises to anyone who manages to kill Kim.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Joong-sik is assigned to the police detail that must protect the vile Guk-ho from the many people hoping to score a fabulous payday, a scenario which calls to mind Takashi Miike’s Shield of Straw.\n\nMeanwhile, Chang-jae is on the hunt for the case filled with cash, which he believes is rightfully his.\n\nRoulette is a game of chance in which you bet on where a small ball will land on a spinning board of different numbers and colours.\n\nHowever, as its title hints, No Way Out: The Roulette suggests that the game of chance that drives the story may be rigged, and designed as a reaction to another stacked deck, the social ladder, which only provides the illusion of chance and opportunity.\n\nParticipants in this dangerous game whether they like it or not, Joong-sik, Guk-ho and Chang-jae do what they feel they must to come out ahead.\n\nHowever, there is a grunginess and narrative fluidity to the series that differentiates it from those glossy streaming originals while also recalling some of the greats of Korean cinema.\n\nAmong the latter is Kim Jee-woon’s brutal serial-killer thriller I Saw the Devil, with Guk-ho’s garish sweaters echoing the costumes of Choi Min-sik’s deranged killer in that film.\n\nAnother is A Hard Day, which also features a police officer doing bad things when he gets into a spot of financial bother, and things quickly spiralling out of control after that.\n\nKim is slated to feature in upcoming episodes as Lee Sang-bong, a lawyer retained by Guk-ho, while Yum will play Ahn Myung-ja, the mayor of Hosan, the fictional setting of the series.\n\nNo Way Out: The Roulette is streaming on Disney+."
