        "text": "Joan Chen has been a fixture on movie and TV screens around the world for decades.\n\n“I'm doing this for almost half a century. My professional life is 49 years,” the 63-year-old Shanghai native, who began acting in China as a teenager, tells PEOPLE.\n\nAfter coming to the U.S. as a college student, Chen quickly found work in films like 1987’s The Last Emperor, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and David Lynch’s groundbreaking 1990-91 series ABC Twin Peaks.\n\nShe starred alongside Tommy Lee Jones in director Oliver Stone’s Heaven & Earth in 1993 and Sylvester Stallone in Judge Dredd two years later.\n\nChen was hailed by critics who called her “exquisite” and other superlatives, but despite her many talents, the roles she was offered in Hollywood were lacking in substance. So for many years, she has been primarily making movies in her homeland.\n\nChen explains it in more blunt terms: “Parts dried up for me a long time ago, and that's why I went back to China to work.”\n\nBut while she was working overseas, a change happened in America. In the past decade, movies like Crazy Rich Asians and Everything Everywhere All at Once and series like Fresh Off the Boat and Beef have highlighted an array of AAPI stories in ways they had never been told before.\n\nChen took notice. “I have witnessed how Asian-American portrayal has progressed and made great strides from the time I was in my twenties, thirties, to now,” she says.\n\n“It's to a point that we don't have to be exotic — you could just be human and tell a great story,” she adds.\n\nFilmmakers and show runners want Chen to tell those stories. “All of a sudden, I’m awfully busy,” says the actress and director, who almost seems surprised that she’s in demand. “I suppose the times are different.”\n\nLast year, she had a role on the Hulu series A Murder at the End of the World and this year she has Dìdi, a bittersweet coming of age story about Chris (Izaac Wang) the 13-year-old son of Chinese immigrants trying to find his way in the world the summer before he starts high school.\n\nWriter-director Sean Wang based the story on his own experience growing up in Fresno, California. The film debuted to great acclaim — and Oscar buzz, particularly for Chen's performance as Chris's mom — at the Sundance Film Festival in January.\n\n“I'm so happy that Sean could tell a story that is so deeply humanized and it's nothing exotic,” she says. “It's just a kid that happens to be a Taiwanese-American kid, and the storyteller happens to be Sean, a Taiwanese-American young man. Other than that, it's just a coming of age story with a mother-daughter, a mother-son relationship. So I think any race could relate to that.”\n\nChen plays Chungsing, a Chinese immigrant whose husband is often away on business. (He is mentioned, but never actually seen in the film.) At home with her son Chris, her teen daughter Vivian (Shirley Chen) and her mother-in-law (Zhang Li Hua, who is Sean Wang’s grandmother), Chungsing, who once dreamed of being a famous artist, still hopes to be recognized as a painter.\n\nShe struggles to connect with her changing son, who lies and tells some new friends he is only half Asian, gets into fights and bickers horribly with sister Vivian.\n\n“That part of the script really resonated with me very deeply. Being an immigrant mother myself, raising two American kids and the drama we experienced,” says Chen, who shares daughters Angela, 25, and Audrey, 22, with her husband of 32 years, cardiologist Peter Hui. “So I understood.”\n\nFor Chen, Dìdi is not a one-off return to U.S. screens. She recently wrapped on a remake of Ang Lee’s 1993 comedy The Wedding Banquet (which costars Saturday Night Live’s Bowen Yang and Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone) and also filmed an upcoming Christmas comedy with Michelle Pfeiffer called Oh. What. Fun.\n\nShe’s learning to speak French for an upcoming role in a movie about a married Chinese woman who moves to Canada and raises her kids there. “Where she grew up and where she raised her family, that environment, she just simply couldn't be herself,” says Chen. “And this story is a family drama when the mother falls in love with another woman.”\n\n“I haven't done a lead part, other than in China, for a long while,” she adds. “And so it just all just happening now.”\n\nAsked if this is the beginning of the Joan Chen-assiance, the actress laughs.\n\n“It’s so funny, because after my younger daughter went with me to Sundance to see [Dìdi], she wasn't looking at me, just elbowed me and said, ‘Good job, Joan.’ And it was so good to be validated,” says Chen.\n\nSeeing her name pop up on short lists of potential supporting actress nominees for the Academy Awards is \"surprising to me,” Chen says.\n\n“I didn't pay a lot of attention until one day my older daughter and my younger daughter were talking about me,” she continues. “And then they said, ‘Oh, it's your Renaissance. Go get some media training.’”\n\nDìdi is in theaters on Friday, Aug. 2."
