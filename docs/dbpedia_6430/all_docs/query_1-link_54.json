        "text": "Scooby-Doo Christmas\n\nWhen the Scooby and the gang stumble upon the quaint town of WinterHollow, they quickly discover that strangers are not welcome and Christmas is not discussed. It seems that every year a ghostly headless snowman appears at yuletide and destroys peoples houses, along with their holiday joy. To Shaggy and Scoobys dismay, Fred, Daphne and Velma decide to spend a chilling Christmas Eve at the local inn to try to solve the mystery of the Headless Snowman and bring Christmas back to WinterHollow.\n\nPiece of Mind\n\nAn overbearing father (James Belushi) is guilt-ridden after injuring his son in a car accident. But the accident is a result of the father's undetected heart condition, and he undergoes heart bypass surgery. In New York City, Corday comforts Greene as a brain specialist removes the tumor. Although Greene experiences a minor seizure, the operation is a success. The gang members who killed Benton's nephew receive a 10-year sentence."
