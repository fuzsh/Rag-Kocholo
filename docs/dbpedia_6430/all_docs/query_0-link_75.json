        "text": "He’s back on the grind.\n\nFormer New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani launched a coffee brand on Monday as he attempts to climb out from a mountain of debt and fight multiple criminal indictments.\n\nFor $29.99, two pounds of the “finest beans imaginable” can be yours, according to Giuliani.\n\n“If I put my name on something, I truly believe in it,” the 79-year-old said in a promotional video touting his three different blends of “Rudy Coffee.”\n\nThe coffee, made from “100% Arabica” beans, comes in three blends: Bold, decaf and morning.\n\nGiuliani’s face is on every bag, with the bold blend featuring images of the young-looking former prosecutor, three men who resemble New York mobsters and the Statue of Liberty.\n\n“Fighting for Justice,” reads the slogan on the bag.\n\n“Believe me when I say it’s the best coffee you’ll ever try,” Giuliani said in the one-minute ad. “It’s smooth, rich, chocolatey and gentle on your stomach.”\n\n“It’s so good I even recommend drinking it black,” he added.\n\nOn his “America’s Mayor Live” podcast, Giuliani said the coffee was the “invention of mine and Dr. Maria” – Dr. Maria being his business partner and former WABC co-host, Dr. Maria Ryan, who is also a former New Hampshire hospital administrator.\n\nGiuliani was recently suspended from his $15,000-per-month radio gig at WABC by station owner John Catsimatidis over his refusal to stop promoting 2020 election conspiracy theories on “The Rudy Giuliani Show.”\n\nThe show was one of Giuliani’s last remaining sources of income, according to his lawyers, with the other being his Social Security benefits.\n\nThe former mayor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last December, a week after a jury ordered him to pay a $148 million civil judgment to two former Georgia election workers.\n\nGiuliani was found liable for defaming mother and daughter Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss by accusing them of committing voter fraud while counting ballots in Fulton County in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAside from the civil judgment, his debts also include $1.4 million in unpaid legal bills, a $700,000 IRS tab and another $260,000 owed to the New York State tax authorities, according to court filings.\n\nHe promised a New York bankruptcy court in January that he’d limit his spending to $43,000 per-month amid the proceeding but reportedly blew through nearly $120,000 that same month, according to the New York Times.\n\n“America’s Mayor” also alleged to the bankruptcy court that the Trump 2020 campaign and the Republican National Committee still owe him $2 million in legal fees for challenging the former president’s election loss.\n\nGiuliani has been indicted in both Georgia and Arizona in connection with an alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nGiuliani, who turns 80 on May 28, was served in the Arizona case during his Palm Beach, Fla., birthday party over the weekend.\n\nMichael Ragusa, Giuliani’s head of security, said in a statement that “a process server waited until he came out of the party around midnight, walked up to him, gave him the subpoena, and the mayor said ‘thank you’ like a gentleman.”"
