        "text": "There is a great wheel that turns and turns, and history turns with it. When it completes its circuit, the departed souls from the previous age return in new forms.\n\nThis is the cosmology of Amazon Prime Video’s new fantasy spectacle, “The Wheel of Time,” hence the title. It’s also a philosophy of TV programming, in which the old inexorably becomes new again. “Game of Thrones” left this mortal plane in 2019, and it is not far-fetched to assume that Amazon hopes “Wheel,” whose first three episodes debut Friday, is its second coming.\n\nHere is where I need to pre-empt readers of the fantasy novels the series is based on. (Review a fantasy-saga adaptation and you will inevitably need to deal with the readers.) Robert Jordan’s cycle of 14 novels (plus supplemental reading) began years before the George R.R. Martin books that were the basis of “Game of Thrones.” And both Jordan and Martin were following, or responding to, the likes of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.” (To complete the circle, or re-spin the wheel, Amazon will also have a “Rings” series next year.)\n\nBut as a TV adaptation, “The Wheel of Time” sure looks as if it wouldn’t mind your confusing it with “Thrones,” right down to the opening credits with their circular Ouroboros-like logo, not unlike the emblem in the “Thrones” credits.\n\nThe good news for fantasy-hungry viewers is that this lush and ambitious series quickly approaches “Thrones,” and even Peter Jackson’s Tolkien films, in grandeur and polish. It’s in the verve of life and depth of character that “Wheel” is a few revolutions behind.\n\nVast series like Jordan’s (which was completed by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan’s death in 2007) can be quagmires to adapt; an abortive pilot aired like a thief in the night on FXX in 2015. This new attempt, developed by Rafe Judkins, hints at a mammoth world and mythology to be built out, based on a mix-match of eastern and western philosophies and aesthetics.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
