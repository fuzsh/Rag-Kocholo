Select “Contestant Application Update” and provide your new information. Include both your new and old contact information, including the email address you used on your application.\n\nA:\n\nWe love players who are at ease, fun, and good game players. It's important that the game moves along quickly and that the players are decisive in calling out their letters with a strong, confident voice and in choosing their game strategy (whether to spin, buy a vowel or solve the puzzle). We want contestants to call logical letters; good game players strike a good balance between calling consonants and buying vowels. Why buy vowels? It may help to fill in the gaps in the puzzles, allowing the contestant to call better consonants and to solve the puzzle with more confidence. It's been our general observation through the years that contestants who play with energy, poise, focus and a sense of humor (without forgetting to call smart letters) tend to do better on the show. Most contestants, at the end of a show, say that it was more difficult than they expected, and that it was the quickest, most exhilarating time of their lives. The final ingredient of a great contestant is a positive attitude. We want every contestant to win, but there's always luck involved — that's why it's called Wheel of Fortune! We want people to come to the taping with the mindset that they're going to have a good time, win or lose. Hey, you're on America’s Game — so you're already a winner!\n\nA:\n\nOnce you’re selected to be a contestant, you will enter our contestant pool, and it may take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of years. We try our best to get contestants on the show within 18 months.\n\nA:\n\nYes. The cash and prizes are considered income by the IRS, so the contestant is responsible for paying state and federal taxes on them.\n\nA:\n\nThey’re looking at the \"used letter board\" to see which letters have already been called. Having an awareness of this board is an important part of being a successful contestant!\n\nMy$tery Wedge $10K Giveaway\n\nA:\n\nAll potential winning SPIN IDs can now be verified on our website for a full 24 hours.
