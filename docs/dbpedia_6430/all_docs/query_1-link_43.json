        "text": "The first trailer for Woody Allen’s 1950s-set drama Wonder Wheel has been revealed.\n\nSet in New York’s Coney Island amusement park, the film stars Kate Winslet as Ginny, a former actor whose life is upturned by the appearance of her carousel operator husband Humpty’s estranged daughter (Juno Temple), who is on the run from the mob. Jim Belushi plays Humpty, while Justin Timberlake appears as Mickey, a young lifeguard who Ginny falls for.\n\nWonder Wheel continues Allen’s recent trend for period film, following the likes of 2011’s time-travel comedy Moonlight in Paris and last year’s Café Society, which was set in 1930s Hollywood. In addition there was Crisis in Six Scenes, a 60s-set comedy-drama that marked Allen’s first foray into streaming television. The series, which like Wonder Wheel was distributed by Amazon, attracted scathing reviews, with the Guardian’s Sam Wollaston describing it as “insignificant, lazy [and] lame”. Amazon will also produce Allen’s next project, an as-yet untitled drama starring Selina Gomez Elle Fanning and Jude Law.\n\nWonder Wheel will premiere as the closing night film at this year’s New York Film Festival on 14 October before being given a limited US release on 1 December. The film’s UK release date is still unknown."
