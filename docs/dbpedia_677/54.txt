Event Description

Rambod Javan’s ‘No Entry for Men’ met with huge success at the box office in Iran. A charming romantic comedy, it takes place in an all-girls’ school where, for the first time ever, a man is brought onto the teaching staff – and a hilarious battle of the sexes ensues. The film marks Javan’s second film as a director; prior to his film work, he directed television series. He is also a noted actor, known in his native Iran for his stage, film and television work.

In an extended post-screening Q&A session, Javan will discuss ‘No Entry for Men’ and field questions from the audience
