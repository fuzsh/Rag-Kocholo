His stage debut was in the same year.

Having graduated with a bachelor's degree from Tehran University's Faculty of Fine Arts in painting in 1997, he performed in \"The Lady Aoi\" by Yukio Mishima, directed by Bahram Beyzaie, and played the role of Hikaru. This was his second official appearance on the stage of the theatre. Parsa Pirouzfar officially started working on his own personal projects for stage in 2001 and he made his directional debut in theater with 'Art', a play by Yasmina Reza. He gave acting courses as a theater teacher at Karnameh Institute of Arts and Culture as well as in extracurricular acting classes of Allameh Tabatabaie University in 2004 and 2005 and also at Hilaj Film School in 2007, 2010 and 2011.

Parsa Pirouzfar is a founder member of Iranian Theater Actors Association, member of Khaneh Cinema (Iranian Alliance of Motion Picture Guilds), member of Iranian Film Actors Association (I.F.A.A.) and The Theater Forum.\n\nShahab Hosseini was born on February 3, 1974 in Tehran, Iran. He grew up in a family of six and was the oldest child. He earned his high school diploma in Biology. Once a psychology student at the University of Tehran, he dropped out with the intent of emigrating to Canada. Instead, he ended up as a radio host in Iran. This was followed by hosting \"Oxygen,\" a TV show for the youth audience, and some small acting roles in a few TV series of which \"After Rain\" (Pas Az Baran) was the first. His debut in cinema was in Rokhsareh (2002), performing alongside Mitra Hajjar. His acting career took off with his performance in movies such as Tahmineh Milani's Die fünfte Reaktion (2003) (Vakonesh-e-Panjom) and Superstar (2009). He won the Crystal Simorgh from Tehran's 27th Fajr International Film Festival for his performance as Kourosh in \"Superstar\". Two years later, he received the Diploma of Honor from Fajr Film Festival and the Silver Bear Award from the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival for his memorable role as the hot-tempered Hodjat in Asghar Farhadi's internationally critically acclaimed film, Nader und Simin - eine Trennung (2011). He has also received several nominations and awards from Iran's House of Cinema including Best Actor in a Lead Role for his performance in Asghar Fardadi's previous film, Alles über Elly (2009).\n\nBorn on January 12th 1984 in Tehran. Her father is a former national team football player, Hamid Alidoosti. She started her career as an actress visiting Amin Tarokh's acting school in 2000. Soon she was chosen for her first role in Taraneh, 15 Jahre alt (2002) (I'm Taraneh, 15), which has so far remained her main success. Her first steps in acting brought her the silver Leopard on the 55th Locarno film festival, and the Cristal Simorgh on Iranian's biggest film festival, Fajr. Being extremely selective her next appearance was 3 years later, Shahr-e ziba (2004) (Beautiful city) by Asghar Farhadi. Feuerzauber (2006) (Fireworks Wednesday) and Alles über Elly (2009) (About Elly) are her next movies with Asghar Farhadi. She has also played in Canaan (2008) by 'Mani Haghighi' which is going to be released in October 2008. Tardid (2009) (by Varuzh Karim-Masihi) is her latest movie which is being shot now in Tehran. She has also appeared in two theater plays, both written and directed by Mohammad Rahmanian.\n\nBahram Beizai started skipping school from around the age of 17 in order to go to movies which were becoming popular in Iran at a rapid pace. This only fed his hunger to learn more about cinema and the visual arts. By 1961 he had already spent a lot of time studying-and researching- ancient persian and pre-Islamic culture and literature. This led him to studying Eastern Theatre and traditional Iranian theatre & arts which would help him formulate a new non-western identity for Iranian theatre. By 1961 he had already published numerous articles in various Arts and Literary Journals. In 1962 he made his first short film (4 minutes) in 8mm format. In the next two years he wrote several plays and published \"Theatre in Japan\". In 1971 he made his first feature film Ragbar ( Downpour ) which to this day remains one of the best Iranian films ever made."
