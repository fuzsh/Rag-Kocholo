Her commitment to her craft and skill in portraying characters with depth and authenticity serve as an inspiration to aspiring actors in the country.\n\nPhilanthropic and social engagement\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to her acting endeavors, Moghaddami actively engages in social and philanthropic activities. She is among the artists who have utilized the medium of Staged readings to support underprivileged women, children with cancer, and earthquake survivors. As a member of the Barakat Charity Foundation, she contributes to the organization's efforts to provide Staged readings for those in need.[32]\n\nShe also has delivered a TED Talk (TEDx), where she openly shares her personal and challenging experiences, offering guidance to others facing similar obstacles. Her speeches aim to inspire hope and assist in finding a meaningful path in life.[33]\n\nFurthermore, she leverages her platform to raise awareness about significant social issues, utilizing her voice to inform the public. For instance, she is among the artists and cineastes who expressed their sympathy over the tragic deaths of passengers aboard a Ukrainian jetliner in posts published on social networks.[34]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nMoghaddami has faced controversies throughout her career. For instance, in 2021, during an appearance on the program \"Hamrafigh,\" her spontaneous proposal to collaborate with the music group \"Bomrani\" and sing with them generated a significant reaction. Consequently, her appearance was unexpectedly removed from the Naava platform without explanation.[35]\n\nAdditionally, in 2022, fifteen Iranian female actresses, including Shabnam Moghaddami, were the subject of a complaint filed by seminarians in Qom. The actresses were accused of violating public decency due to their attire in public spaces, gatherings, and personal Instagram pages.
