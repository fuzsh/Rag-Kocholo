Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip; movie review\n\nALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: THE ROAD CHIP\n\nCert U\n\n92 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains mild comic violence, very mild bad language\n\nI have said it before and I will say it again - Mrs W deserves a medal.\n\nWe have been together 30 years but even that doesn't explain her unswerving loyalty to join me at a screening of Alvin And The Chipmunks: Road Chip.\n\nMore amazing still is that she revealed AFTER the movie that she wasn't feeling very well and had to go home before the second film of the evening.\n\nJust to clarify - she said it wasn't Walt Becker's movie which made her sick although I would have understood if she'd said it had been.\n\nThis is the fourth installment of the series which stars three singing chipmunk brothers and their guardian, Dave (Jason Lee) who is now famous for shouting \"AAAAAALVIN!\" at the top of his voice.\n\nInevitably, this is because the cheeky chipmunks (voiced by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney) have pushed him to his limits and probably beyond.\n\nFor example, the film starts with what was meant to be a quiet celebration for his birthday but, in his absence, turned into rave with dozens of people invited.\n\nBut every time Dave seems brassed off with his furry friends, he is soon won around again by an act of kindness or a song.\n\nIn this episode, Dave has gone to Miami with his girlfriend (Kimberley Williams-Paisley) and left the chipmunks with the impression that he is going to propose marriage.\n\nThey are distressed because they fear having to move in with her bullying son (Josh Green), so they embark upon their 'road chip' to stop Dave becoming engaged.\n\nMeanwhile, their nemesis soon becomes their pal and they join forces against a panto-style villain in the shape of an air marshal (Tony Hale).\n\nAnd so, they cause chaos through America, singing as they go.\n\nThe children, who all looked under six, among the audience at Nottingham Cineworld lapped it up and laughed merrily. Sadly, there was nothing here for adults and the shrill singing nearly burst our eardrums, so we did not.\n\nReasons to watch: if you are a small child without a discerning sense of humour\n\nReasons to avoid: it is soooooo predictable\n\nLaughs: none for us but the kids were giggling\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 3/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nIn a galaxy far, far away, three rodents roamed the land. I'm kind of the Darth Vader in this one. #Alvin\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n79. Fitoor; movie review\n\nFITOOR\n\nCert 12A\n\n129 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains moderate bad language, sex, violence\n\nMrs W had gone home poorly, so I nipped off alone to screen 13 of Nottingham Cineworld for Abishek Kapoor's Bollywood version of Great Expectations.\n\nHowever, it never occurred to me during Fitoor that it was an adaptation of the Dickens classic - I only found out afterwards.\n\nWith hindsight it makes some sense with Tabu playing a rich Miss Haversham-type who tempts a peasant-boy, Noor, to fall in love with her beautiful young charge, Firdaus.\n\nAs children, the pair play nicely and become best pals but when they grow up, it is clear that naive Noor's love is not returned.\n\nKatrina Kaif plays the older Firdaus, a flighty lass who oozes exotic confidence but is not quite so sure about her future as she seems.\n\nAditya Roy Kapoor stars as the melodramatic, lovelorn but conflicted Noor who irritates more and more the longer the film goes on because of his childish outbursts when he doesn't get what he wants.\n\nIn this version of Great Expectations, Delhi replaces London as the place in which the hero is set up to make his fortune. But it is not a city in which Noor, a lad from Kashmir, ever seems at home.\n\nBy contrast, Firdaus is the toast of society and heading for a high-powered marriage to a Pakistani politician (Rahul Bhat).\n\nOn the plus side, Tabu, Kaif and Kapoor give their hearts to Fitoor, there are some dramatic moments and the cinematography in Kashmir is impressive.\n\nOn the down side, it jumps around so much from past to present that, at times, I was left wondering what was going on.\n\nIt had high expectations but it clearly has not resonated with audiences in the UK because it has already disappeared from most screens here.\n\nReasons to watch: Passionate performances by Aditya Roy Kapur and Katrina Kaif\n\nReasons to avoid: Its attempt to bring Great Expectations into the modern day fails\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: one\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 5/10\n\nStar Tweet\n\n#Fitoor a story about love..

Zoolander 2; movie review\n\nZOOLANDER 2\n\nCert 12A\n\n102 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains moderate violence, sex references, infrequent strong language\n\nI am in a happy place today because I have just managed to fix a speaker up to my new record player.\n\nI add this context because my mood is in direct contrast to the one which I had on Wednesday evening when Mrs W and I watched Zoolander 2 at Nottingham Cineworld.\n\nBen Stiller's film only had one saving grace - it enabled me to catch up on 20 minutes sleep!\n\nI had dropped off after its lamentable opening but it became clear that I had missed absolutely nothing.\n\nZoolander 2 posed so many questions. Top of the list was 'why bother?' but I presume that the simple answer to that was that it was made for the money.\n\nMore difficult to understand was why so many top-line celebs agreed to have anything to do with it (I wondered whether its makers were trying for a Guinness record for the number of cameos).\n\nZoolander 2 is the height of self-indulgence. I presume those taking part had a jolly good laugh. A pity they forgot they were making it for a paying audience.\n\nStiller hasn't been funny since Meet The Parents in 2000, the year before the original Zoolander mocked the fashion world.\n\nWe have to delve even further into the past to find his most hilarious moments during There's Something About Mary.\n\nHe cannot duck responsibility for this latest in a long line of duds because he directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in Zoolander 2.\n\nHe plays Derek Zoolander, the world's most famous model whose pose/stare was charismatic enough in the first movie to fend off a deadly weapon.\n\nThis sequel begins with him brought out of retirement to join his old pal Hansel (Owen Wilson) on the catwalk.\n\nThis is a precursor for him being signed up by the fashion police (!) to track down the killer of stars such as Justin Bieber.\n\nDerek and Hansel team up with Penelope Cruz and her unfeasibly large breasts and come up against his nemesis, played by Will Ferrell.\n\nAlong the way there are scores of in-jokes which I am sure tickled cast and crew but left Mrs W and me stony-faced.\n\nZoolander 2 was worse than poor. It was boring.\n\nReasons to watch: if you are a Ben Stiller fan\n\nReasons to avoid: the remarkable lack of funny moments\n\nLaughs: two chuckles\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 2/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nThe Derek Zoolander Center For People Who Don’t Age Good turned me back into a spring chicken.\n\n↧\n\n81. A Bigger Splash; movie review\n\nA BIGGER SPLASH\n\nCert 15\n\n124 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains strong language, sex, sex references, nudity, drug use\n\nWe needed a fast antidote to Zoolander 2, so we darted off to screen 2 of Nottingham Cineworld for Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash.\n\nIt struck me as a sign of the times that there were only three of us watching a superb cast acting their socks off (almost literally) yet Ben Stiller's stupid stare could attract so many more.\n\nA Bigger Splash combines Ralph Fiennes as an exuberant record producer alongside Tilda Swinton as a famous singer.\n\nThe pair have romantic history but she is now with a much lower profile and younger other half (Matthias Schoenaerts) who was, years before, introduced to her by Fiennes' character.\n\nThe latter visits the couple at their holiday home in remote Italy, outwardly friendly to both but with the subtext of winning his former love back.\n\nMeanwhile, he shocks by bringing a newly found daughter (Dakota Johnson) with him and she adds another layer of flirtation.\n\nOh, and they all spend a percentage of the movie with their clothes off.\n\nI add this because, around the time of The English Patient, Mrs W was rather keen on Fiennes. I can confirm that her lustre has worn off with age even though he is three months younger than her.\n\nThe good news is that his acting is just as good as it was then and he excels as a complex but loud man who is carefree on the surface but is tortured by jealousy.\n\nSwinton is as good as ever, despite only being able to whisper through the whole film because her character has undergone an operation on her vocal chords.\n\nMeanwhile, Shoenaerts has perfected the role of straight man in recent pictures and Johnson is becoming the sex kitten of the decade.\n\nThere is no doubt that there is more style to A Bigger Splash than substance. Pretty people look their best, with or without clothes, and their surroundings are gorgeous,\n\nBut it is worth waiting for the movie to bite because, when it does, sharp teeth are exposed.\n\nReasons to watch: stylish, top quality cast in fine form\n\nReasons to avoid: for a long period the storyline lacks focus\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: yes\n\nOverall rating 7/10\n\n↧\n\n82. Orthodox; movie review\n\nORTHODOX\n\nCert 18\n\n96 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains very strong language\n\nWhen Stephen Graham broke onto the scene, I thought his films pigeon-holed him as an angry Liverpudlian. Orthodox is an example of why I should never have never doubted his range.\n\nGraham gives one of his most impressive performances to date as Benjamin Levy - a conflicted Jewish man who finds a chasm between his faith and the real world.\n\nDavid Leon's film moves between Benjamin's childhood when, much to his father's dismay, he turned to his fists when bullied over his religion.\n\nHe then takes up boxing seriously and, in later life, fights for cash to supplement his meagre income as a butcher.\n\nMichael Smiley is thoroughly unpleasant as Ben's fixer and the man who offers him more money carry out enforcement jobs. What naive Ben does not realise is that a Jewish elder (Christopher Fairbank) is also tied up in flouting the law.\n\nGraham, who ditches his Scouse brogue for a southern accent here, is surprisingly low key, trying to please everyone, including Ben's fretful wife (Rebecca Callard) and a young lad (Giacomo Mancini) who sees him as a mentor.\n\nBut the longer Orthodox goes on, the more there is a growing feeling that he will have a tipping point.\n\nOrthodox builds tension slowly so that the audience can invest in its characters. By its conclusion I was silently egging Ben on.\n\nIt is smartly directed and gives Graham the chance to give his best. Meanwhile, he is complemented with quality performances by Smiley and Fairbank.\n\nOverall, it is convincingly raw.\n\nReasons to watch: Stephen Graham at his best\n\nReasons to avoid: takes too long to reach its climax\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nExtremely proud being part of @Orthodox_Film released tonight @CurzonCinemas, tickets available @ Bloomsbury if that's your neighbourhood.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n83. Chronic; movie review\n\nCHRONIC\n\nCert 15\n\n93 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains brief strong sex references, infrequent strong language\n\nThe first few minutes of Michel Franco's Chronic is so harrowing it could well prompt some audience members to leave the room.\n\nI can report that although the rest is far from an easy watch, it is worth perseverance if only for the remarkable performance by Tim Roth.\n\nRoth plays a nurse who is brought in for palliative care when patients are nearing the end of their lives.\n\nFranco spares no sensitivities, so Roth has to wash each of his character's charges all over, sometimes after they have soiled themselves.\n\nBut while Chronic is raw it is also realistic. Anyone who has seen a relative or friend in the final days of life will have seen how dignity is stripped away.\n\nRoth's character, David, cares deeply that his clients should be as comfortable as possible but becomes too involved, creating imaginary scenarios in which he is more important to them than he is.\n\nAudiences should be warned that Chronic could well prompt personal memories which they would have wanted to be erased. But that is why it is so powerful.\n\nI have often wondered whether those in palliative care are in danger of being mentally scarred and Franco's movie suggests that could be the case.\n\nOnly those who work in the field can answer that but Roth did spend time observing some before shooting of the movie began.\n\nHe is utterly convincing as are Rachel Pickup, Michael Christofer and Robin Bartlett who literally allow themselves to be stripped naked to make the film work.\n\nBut where does a movie such as Chronic take us? To a conclusion which was truly shocking, that's where.\n\nReasons to watch: Tim Roth's performance is riveting\n\nReasons to avoid: a bit too near the grisly reality of end of life care\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: one\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: yes\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\n\nStar Tweet\n\nTrailer for Chronic, a film I did with Tim Roth that won Best Screenplay at Cannes this year https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XUYrOBFCmyU …\n\n↧\n\n84. Today (Emrouz); movie review\n\nTODAY (EMROUZ)\n\nCert TBA\n\n88 mins\n\nBBFC advice: TBA\n\nAt the beginning of every year I have high ambition for the everyfilm challenge and 2016 is no exception.\n\nTherefore, I am watching some movies which are appearing less than the three screenings which is what it usually takes to qualify for my agenda,\n\nFor example, through a subscription website called Festivalscope, I have immersed myself in the movies which are showing this weekend at the Edinburgh Iranian Festival.\n\nThe first of the trio was Reza Mirkarimi's Today which was Iran's official entry to the 2015 Academy Awards.\n\nIn the past, I have found Iranian movies engaging and have been impressed by their quality given that film-makers had often been under pressure by government.\n\nThe shackles appear to have been loosened of the past couple of years. Nevertheless, every Iranian movie I have seen majors on social comment and Today is no exception, while at the same time being a tense and unusual drama.\n\nIt stars Parviz Parastui as a taxi driver who picks up a pregnant young woman (Soheila Golestani) who looks as if she has been beaten.\n\nThe driver makes no comment as she tries to engage him in conversation between yelps of pain and sharp intakes of breath.\n\nEventually, they arrive at a hospital and she pleads with him to accompany her, fearing the shame of being an expectant mother without support.\n\nAs a consequence, the staff jump to the presumption that he is her husband and, most likely, has been responsible for her injuries. However, to preserve her honour he does not contradict them.\n\nToday shows how false impressions can lead to substantial consequences unless they are disproved but it is also a commentary on how Iranian society views women.\n\nParastui is pitch-perfect as the taxi driver even though he rarely speaks during the movie. He complements Golestani whose character is loud and desperate.\n\nReasons to watch: an intriguing insight into Iran\n\nReasons to avoid: not one for action film fans\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\n\n↧\n\n85. Remember; movie review\n\nREMEMBER\n\nCert TBA\n\n95 mins\n\nBBFC advice: TBA\n\nQuite often I watch movies which have caused barely a ripple among audiences and wonder why the distributors have not given them more of a push.\n\nAtom Egoyan's Remember is only showing at one screen in Glasgow and went straight to on demand services in the United States and yet Mrs W and I were both rapt by its story and performances.\n\nI can only presume that the reason for the lack of wide promotion is that distributors and cinema chains believe old people don't sell.\n\nRemember is overflowing with elderly actors, spearheaded by 86-year-old Christopher Plummer who plays a Jewish survivor of Auschwitz.\n\nAlongside him is 87-year-old Martin Landau who devises a plan for his fellow nursing home resident to bump off a death camp officer who it is believed is living in America.\n\nThe problem is that Plummer's character suffers from dementia so the plan has to be written in great detail in a letter which he has to read every day. He also needs reminders to do this.\n\nPlummer is excellent, combining confusion with his commitment to do what he believes is his duty.\n\nIt is ironic that the actor who made his name trying to escape Nazi officers in The Sound Of Music is hunting them down 50 years later.\n\nMeanwhile, Landau is just as convincing as a frail, wheelchair-bound old man who needs a constant supply of oxygen.\n\nI have seen a few reviews which question the credibility of a dementia patient winding his way across the United States to carry out an assassination. However implausible it may seem, Remember had us engrossed.\n\nReasons to watch: An unusual, beautifully acted thriller\n\nReasons to avoid: If you don't want 90 mins dominated by very old people\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 8.5/10\n\n↧\n\n86. Atomic Heart (Madar-e ghalb atomi); movie review\n\nATOMIC HEART\n\nCert TBA\n\n97 mins\n\nBBFC advice: TBA\n\nI watch a heck of a lot of foreign movies but they do not always resonate because the cultural gap is too wide.\n\nSuch was the case with Atomic Heart - the second picture from the Edinburgh Iranian Festival.\n\nAli Ahmadzade's film begins straightforwardly enough with two drunken young women (Taraneh Alidoosti and Pegah Ahangarani) cruising the streets of Tehran having been to a party.\n\nThey meet a funky male pal and the chatter is about his plans to emigrate to Australia. But then they crash their car and the whole tone of the film swings to the surreal and absurd.\n\nIt is at this point they are accosted by a handsome stranger (Mohammad Reza Golzar) who claims mafia links and then even convinces them he is from another world.\n\nOh, I nearly forgot the sudden a brief appearance of a Saddam Hussein lookalike who is completely out of context with the tangent-strewn storyline.\n\nFor a while, Atomic Heart even becomes a chase movie with the two women trying to elude the stranger who has become progressively more crazed.\n\nSo, what I had thought had been a light-hearted commentary on young people in Iran having desires for Western values becomes an unfathomable mess.\n\nI would love to be alerted to the opinions of others who have seen Atomic Heart so they can explain it but I am afraid it went over my head\n\nReasons to watch: a fresh view of inside Tehran\n\nReasons to avoid: drifts from the self-indulgent into the surreal\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 3.5/10\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n87.

Rajabi's film offers none.\n\nReasons to watch: another insight into the Iranian psyche\n\nReasons to avoid: relentlessly depressing\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 4/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nA MinorLeapDown is such a rare gem on women and depression.

Deadpool; movie review\n\nDEADPOOL\n\nCert 15\n\n105 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains strong bloody violence, strong language, sex references\n\nThe hype surrounding Deadpool had me high on anticipation as Mrs Wand I took our seats for the early IMAX screening at Nottingham Cineworld on Sunday.\n\nThe unusually humorous opening credits only served to add to the expectancy but, sadly, I have to report that Tim Miller's movie left us disappointed.\n\nSure, it is sharply written and Ryan Reynolds is suitably brash and self-mocking but I couldn't help thinking that the same gag was being told over and over.\n\nThis is where age might be relevant. When we returned home, Miss W's fella said how much he had loved Deadpool. He is 22.\n\nAnd that is probably why the profanity-strewn gags, topless women and endless shootings appealed to him more than me. I am nearly 53,\n\nDeadpool is more Viz than Marvel. Don't try to smuggle in kids who are X-Men fans because you will need to cover their ears and eyes.\n\nI would think the film might resonate with many with lads, aged between 16 and 30 but that doesn't explain why a 26-year-old lass at my work's office is planning to see it for a second time.\n\nPerhaps, she is taken with Reynolds whose quipping is as fast as his gun-work (no double entendre intended).\n\nReynolds plays Wade Wilson, a mercenary who is offered a cure for aggressive cancer but along with his new-found indestructibility comes a price - a terribly scarred face and body which he covers up in a Spiderman-like costume.\n\nThe movie flicks between his past when he was ensconced in a torrid love affair with a beautiful girlfriend (Morena Baccarin) and the present when he is seeking revenge on stereotypical British villain (Ed Skrein) who gave him the face of a monster.\n\nThroughout there are parodies of moments from the Marvel pictures and other movies (Skrein's character is called Francis - probably a link to his 'Frank' role in Transporter Refueled).\n\nBut the more it tries to please, the less I wanted to laugh,\n\nDeadpool wasn't bad and it certainly made others in the audience giggle. It just wasn't as compelling, funny or memorable as I thought it would be.\n\nReasons to watch: Sharp-writing, stunning effects\n\nReasons to avoid: Not as funny as it thinks it is.\n\nLaughs: one plus two chuckles\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: yes\n\nOverall rating: 6.5/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nBelieve the hype people! #Deadpool is as good as they come!

Triple 9; movie review\n\nTRIPLE 9\n\nCert 15\n\n116 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains strong bloody violence, very strong language, drug use, sexualised nudity\n\nUndaunted after the moderate disappointment of Deadpool, Mrs W and I headed for screen 2 of Nottingham Cineworld for John Hillcoat's Triple 9.\n\nAgain, I was hoping for great things having been so impressed by Hillcoat's previous feature, Lawless.\n\nTriple 9 is not quite in the same league but boasts a similar quality cast and number of violent deaths. It is also tightly scripted by first time feature writer Matt Cook.\n\nThe picture focuses on bent cops (Anthony Mackie and Clifton Collins Jr) who are part of gang of bank robbers stealing to order for the Russian mafia.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor is the leader of the quartet but is beholden to the Russians because his son's mother is one of them. Thus, he is exploited by her hard-nosed sister (Kate Winslet).\n\nThankfully, among the detritus of Atlanta, where the film is set, are good cops Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson (actually Harrelson's character is also deeply flawed).\n\nTriple 9 reaches right into the lawless underbelly of life in a major American city. If it bears any relation to reality, it must be very frightening stateside.\n\nLife is cheap on the streets and even teenagers are walking around with guns. Consequently, bodies litter this movie.\n\nSome of my favourite actors (Affleck, Ejiofor, Harrelson and Winslet) are on view but their talents are secondary to the high-intensity action of Triple 9 which builds into a shattering crescendo.\n\nI presume it was released in Oscar season with the hope of picking up some rewards. It wasn't quite good enough to contend but it is worth a cinema ticket.\n\nReasons to watch: tight story with a great deal of suspense\n\nReasons to avoid: big on violence with a high body count\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: yes\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nStar Tweet\n\nDear UK, Check out Triple 9 right now!!!

Tashi & The Monk; movie review\n\nTASHI AND THE MONK\n\nCert TBA\n\n39 mins\n\nBBFC advice: TBA\n\nAfter not even making it to 550 movies in 2015, I am showing greater intent in 2016 and try to waste even less time than I have in the past.\n\nTo that end, we now travel by tram into Nottingham city centre and en route I watch films I have downloaded on itunes.\n\nOn Sunday, it was the turn of Johnny Burke and Andrew Hinton's film about Buddhist monk Lobsang Phuntsok who left the tutorship of the Dalai Lama in America to create a community in the foothills of the Himalayas where he and his team care for and educate scores of children whose parents have died or cannot look after them.\n\nThe movie alights upon one little girl, Tashi, who is the youngest and naughtiest in the community and follows her as she eventually finds her feet and new friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Lobsang wrestles with his conscience as there are far more applications from desperate families for him to take their children but not enough beds.\n\nTashi And The Monk is a story of selflessness and a demonstration of how love can change children's lives.\n\nBut I wish it had been longer. I wanted to know how Lopsang organised his funding and how sustainable his community is going to be.\n\nHowever, what did resonate with me was that this is where religion can be used to its greatest effect. It starts from a point of peace and love, highlighting the similarities between people as opposed to marking the differences which, sadly, happens far too often in the world.\n\nReasons to watch: Shows how a full heart can conquer hurdles\n\nReasons to avoid: Too short - background needed further exploration\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n91. Beauty And The Bestie; movie review\n\nBEAUTY AND THE BESTIE\n\nCert 12A\n\n119 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains moderate violence\n\nThe fact that Beauty And The Bestie is the highest grossing Filipino movie of all time on domestic earnings should at least prevent the country being tarred by the brush of boxer Manny Pacquiao.\n\nThe latter is arguably the most famous Filipino since Imelda Marcos and, therefore, could have created much damage with his repulsive comments about the gay community last week.\n\nIt caused reverberations with the likes of Vice Ganda who is a Filipino TV star as well as the lead in Wenn V. Deramas' hugely popular film.\n\nBeauty And The Bestie came as something of a surprise because it is a rare mainstream movie which embraces gay and transgender characters.\n\nGanda plays Erika who is roped into helping a secret service mission at a Miss Universe-style pageant by his best friend (Coco Martin).\n\nHowever, as much as my liberal tendencies prompted me to want to enjoy the movie, I can't say that I did because I just didn't find it funny.\n\nGanda's character has something of the Mrs Brown about her and not because she is a man dressed as a woman.\n\nShe is also big on family and friends and also has a habit of breaking away from the obvious script and acknowledging she is in a movie.\n\nThe problem for me was that I didn't like this style with Mrs Brown's Boys and I didn't think much of it here either. I just don't see what is amusing in ugly fellas dressing in skirts going off piste.\n\nIn addition, there is a bizarrely high body count in a movie which appears to set itself up as a family comedy. The good news is that the victims are all bad guys.\n\nBeauty And The Bestie is wildly over-the-top in both costumes and actions and it has proven its audience but it just didn't grab me.\n\nReasons to watch: if you enjoy cross-gender comedies\n\nReasons to avoid: its over-acting\n\nLaughs: none for me\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 4/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nThe LGBT is a group of people.

Hopefully, that is the end of the catalogue of fart jokes until the Easter Holidays.\n\nYes, half-term has meant a welter of kids' movies at the cinema and the latest up was Taedong Park and Mauricio De la Orta's Jungle Shuffle.\n\nThis is the latest in what seems to be a neverending list of children's films with a conservation theme and during which the animals are good and humans are bad.\n\nIt is as if George Orwell were still with us.\n\nAnyway, the star of this particular show is a coati called Manu, voiced by Drake Bell.\n\n\"Hold on\", I hear you cry, \"What is a coati?\"\n\nIt turns out that it is a raccoon although I am not too sure they come in orange, pink and blue varieties which are represented in Jungle Shuffle.\n\nAnyway, Manu is an adventurous type and has the eye for the coati king's daughter (Jessica DiCicco).\n\nSadly, he is a bit clumsy and one of his particularly oafish moments result in him being banned from the coati community.\n\nHowever, despite his exile, his belle still loves and believes in our misunderstood hero and she is rewarded when he leads the rescue attempt when she is kidnapped by humans.\n\nJungle Shuffle is low on plot ambition, nodding in the direction of many other films (spot the King Louis Jungle Book reference).\n\nIts dialogue is as predictable as its conclusion (with the exception of the bizarre hybrid dinosaur) and its graphics are below the standard of much of the animation around nowadays.\n\nWith so many children's pictures around I can't see why the youngsters would be opting for this one.\n\nReasons to watch: reasonably breezy animation\n\nReasons to avoid: goes over the same ground as so many other cartoons\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 4.5/10\n\nStar tweet\n\n#Manu trying to make sense of what's happening to the #jungle in #JungleShuffle, a film I had the pleasure 2 coDirect\n\n↧\n\n93.

He used to be omnipresent but it seems like an age since we saw him on the big screen.\n\nDuring Peter Landesman's superb Concussion, he reminds us why he has twice previously been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nHere, he excels as pathologist Bennet Omalu who draws a frightening link between brain injuries and professional American football.\n\nHis journey starts with an examination of the corpse of celebrated Pittsburgh player Mike Webster (David Morse).\n\nBefore his death Webster has been living in the back of a van having suffered a horrendous mental breakdown.\n\nThe real reason for his death is only discovered because Omalu is such a pedant, insisting on a methodical and expensive full autopsy.\n\nConcussion explores how many barriers were put in his way as he strove for the truth about Webster and many of his colleagues.\n\nHowever, he did have allies - his boss in the coroner's office, played by Albert Brooks, a former Pittsburgh medic (Alec Baldwin) and the new woman in his life (Gugu Mbatha-Raw).\n\nSmith's Omalu grows as the film progresses. He begins by being quiet, unassuming but determined but he develops a righteous indignation.\n\nHe faces overwhelming odds and opponents whose multi-billion dollar industry is being threatened by research which shows its players are prone to extensive brain injury.\n\nSmith is terrific in the lead role. I hope we see much more of him at the movies in the near future.\n\nLandesman managed to keep us riveted even though neither Mrs W nor I know very much about American Football.\n\nHis film is a simple battle of good against bad and, even when the dice are loaded, we know the former can come out on top.\n\nReasons to watch: brilliant performance by Will Smith and an important subject\n\nReasons to avoid: bloody scenes in the morgue\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nTook my boys to #Concussion last night, important movie 4 all those involved in game!

The couple prove to be not quite what they seemed.\n\nOne of the band then go on into the next scene in which she is knocked down by an innocent driver who goes to incredible lengths to save her life.\n\nAnd then vampire-like creatures are introduced and, finally, a family's home is invaded by psychopaths wearing masks.\n\nSouthbound's body count is high and the different ways in which folk are eliminated is quite imaginative.\n\nBut, ultimately, as I have confessed, vats of blood and gore really don't do it for me.\n\nReasons to watch: more offbeat than usual gore fests\n\nReasons to avoid: the cascade of blood and wooden acting\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 4/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nBuying my own @SouthboundMovie right now.

Grimsby; movie review\n\nGRIMSBY\n\nCert 15\n\n83 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains strong sex references, violence, drug use, strong language\n\nIt is lowest common denominator humour but I have to admit that Grimsby made me laugh more than any comedy in the past few months.\n\nNot so, Mrs W. She left Cineworld, Nottingham stony faced, claiming it was \"not her bag\".\n\nActually, she went further than that and said she felt a couple of the gags (about leukaemia and a child sex pervert) were offensive.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen sets out to shock in all of his movies and Louis Leterrier's Grimsby is no exception.\n\nAnyone averse to the most base jokes about sex and other bodily functions should avoid it.\n\nBut most of the audience which attended the Unlimited screening on Wednesday lapped it up.\n\nThe following evening Miss W gave it lukewarm approval but admitted her fella was falling about laughing.\n\nIt doesn't surprise me that Grimsby has already elicited polar views. Cohen never has been everyone's cup of tea.\n\nHere he plays a benefit scrounger with an army of kids and a sex-mad wife (Rebel Wilson).\n\nIn his eyes he has the perfect life with the exception of not knowing the whereabouts of his long-lost brother (Mark Strong).\n\nIt turns out that the latter is a secret agent and has the task of protecting a world famous philanthropist (Penelope Cruz) from assassination.\n\nHowever, his steely focus is broken when his brother suddenly appears in his life for the first time in nearly 30 years.\n\nInevitably, no matter how unlikely it seems, the two team up to see off bad guys who appear from every direction.\n\nGrimsby's plot is ludicrous and full of holes but that is not where its makers have been concentrating, They are just content to go for the big laughs regardless of whether they make sense or not.\n\nCohen is typically brash throughout and Strong makes a decent, if slightly uncomfortable, straight man.\n\nMeanwhile, there are cameos for the likes of Ricky Tomlinson, Johnny Vegas, Clive Tyldesley and... Andy Townsend (yes, much of the storyline surrounds England at the World Cup).\n\nActually, one of my bugbears with the film was its slapdash football references (there is no Grimsby United or a World Cup in 2016).\n\nAnyway, I could spend hundreds of words describing why it could be so much better but the truth is Grimsby has enough laughs to ensure it will be a box office hit.\n\nReasons to watch: there are some funny moments\n\nReasons: some scenes could offend\n\nLaughs: five for me - many more for others in the audience\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: yes\n\nNudity: yes\n\nOverall rating: 6.5/10\n\nStar Tweet\n\nWhirlwind visit to Cape Town this week - additional filming for #GRIMSBY#lekker#sweats x\n\n↧\n\n96. The Propaganda Game; movie review\n\nTHE PROPAGANDA GAME\n\nCert 15\n\n96 mins\n\nBBFC advice: Contains strong references to violence and torture\n\nIt is fair to say that North Korea is the most mysterious country on earth and because of that it has become the subject of hundreds of fantasies, made up by its detractors.\n\nSome of them, surrounding its military arsenal, have a frightening ring of truth - some, such as it being the law to have a haircut similar to its leader, stretch credibility.\n\nDirector Alvaro Longoria says that he has always had a fascination with the communist state and was desperate to explore the real North Korea.\n\nThe Propaganda Game is the result of a successful, if long-winded, application to be allowed into the country.\n\nHowever, even though he was promised free reign to film whatever he wanted, he concedes that it was done under the constant observation of two guides.\n\nThe Propaganda Game does delve deeper into North Korea than any other movie I have seen and it has some surprises - for example, the flamboyant dresses of the women and the tourist attraction that the border with South Korea has become.\n\nAnd then there is the Spaniard, Alejandro Cao de Benos, who has immersed himself so much in the culture than he now has a place in government.\n\nBizarrely, he does not appear to speak Korean and yet he is the official spokesman, bathing in the righteousness of North Korean communism.\n\nLongoria's film includes contributions from many inside North Korea and some key speakers from outside, including defectors.\n\nBut those hoping to cut through propaganda will be disappointed - the more the film progresses the more distant the truth seems to become.\n\nAs said, it gives a small but approved insight and discounts some of the more outlandish claims about the country and the contributions from its citizens are interesting.\n\nBut one movie-maker was never going to be able to resolve a 62-year mystery in the space of a few weeks' filming.\n\nReasons to watch: unusual new footage inside North Korea\n\nReasons to avoid: doesn't come to any conclusions over the propaganda game\n\nLaughs: none\n\nJumps: none\n\nVomit: none\n\nNudity: none\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nStar tweet\n\nJust finished my q+a on The Propaganda Game in the fantastic London Picturehouse Central.
