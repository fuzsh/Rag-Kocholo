        "text": "Cebrennus rambodjavani View in CoL sp. nov.\n\nFigs 1 View FIGURE 1 B, 2A–F\n\nType material: Holotype: male, IRAN: Qom Province: Dasht-e-Kavir, Qom-Garmsar Freeway, surroundings of Deyr-e-Gachin Caravansary, 35°03'29.6\"N, 51°25'12.5\"E, 23 October 2014, P. Beyhaghi leg. ( SMF).\n\nEtymology. This species is named after Mr Rambod Javan, an Iranian actor, director and comedian in recognition of his invaluable movements seeking to improve and protect natural environments and wildlife of Iran, especially via his most popular TV-program, \"Khandevaneh\". Noun in genitive case.\n\nDiagnosis. This new species is unique in having a distad embolus kink and short proximad DE. Male palp of this new species is similar to that of C. logunovi Jäger, 2000 and C. kochi (cf. Jäger 2000: figs 7–9, 17, 18) in having a relatively short embolus and a retrolaterad RTA with hump. It can be distinguished from both by the RTA hump situated proximally and the embolus with broad well developed proximal part ( Figs 2 View FIGURE 2 A–D); in C. logunovi and C. kochi RTA hump is situated medially and embolus without well-developed proximal part.\n\nDescription. Male: Habitus as in Fig. 1 View FIGURE 1 B.\n\nMeasurements. Small-sized Sparassidae ; total length 8.8, carapace length 4.1, width 3.6, anterior width 2.3, opisthosoma length 4.7, width 3.0. Anterior and posterior eye row slightly recurved, AME largest, PLE smallest ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 E).\n\nChelicerae. With 2 anterior and 3 posterior basally fused teeth, the right chelicerae with an additional small bump (might be relict of fourth teeth), subequal posterior teeth, cheliceral furrow without denticles; retromargin with three bristles at base of fang ( Fig. 2 View FIGURE 2 F).\n\nLegs. Leg formula: II I IV III. Palp 6.1 [1.8, 0.7, 1.0, 1.7], I 24.8 [7.5, 2.5, 6.1, 7.0, 1.7], II 26.6 [8.0, 2.4, 6.8, 7.6, 1.8], III 20.3 [6.3, 2.0, 5.1, 5.3, 1.6], IV 23.6 [7.6, 2.4, 6.4, 6.5, 1.7].\n\nSpination. Palp 131, 0 0 1, 100 (one spine and the rest stiff setae); Legs: Femur I 323/423, II 333/423, III 323, IV 322/323 (left/right); Patella I 0 0 1, II–IV 000; Tibia I–IV 2024; Metatarsus I–III 2024, IV 3036.\n\nPalp. As in diagnosis, with cymbium two times longer than tibia, distal half of cymbium with dorsal scopula. RTA shorter than tegulum, barely extending beyond distal margin of tibia, distally pointed with its tip distoventrad, RTA with distinct hump proximally. Embolus with swollen proximal part, kink situated at distal margin of alveolus, distal part of embolus relatively short, proximo-retrolaterad, proximal part of embolus partially embedded in distal alveolus. Conductor hyaline and reduced in size. Sperm duct retrolaterally slightly S-shaped ( Figs 2 View FIGURE 2 A–C).\n\nFemale: Unknown."
