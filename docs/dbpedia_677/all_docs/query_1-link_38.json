        "text": "The Sustainability Energy and Engineering Design Curriculum Design Course Subject leading to AIU Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering where addresses the activities planned for either construction or maintenance of the building study with a 3.78 (A) GPA. The green building revolution is sweeping across the whole world for global warming impact, which inspired individuals in preventing it. However, the revolution fuelled by the knowledge that the world has little time to respond to the growing dangers of climate change especially global warming whereas the buildings play a huge role in causing carbon dioxide emissions that drive global climate change. Accordingly and based from the researchers and studies through measures with a zero or negative net life-cycle cost, green building saves carbon emissions and money at the same time with the effective insulation, glazing, water heating, air conditioning, lighting and other energy efficiency measures that applies into the building and environment as a part of a paradigm shift towards sustainability.\n\nEngineering graduates must be prepared to support our worldâ€™s need for a clean and sustainable energy future. Complex problems related to energy and sustainability require engineers to consider the broad spectrum of interrelated consequences including human and environmental health, sociopolitical, and economic factors. Teaching engineering students about energy within a societal context, simultaneous with developing technical knowledge and skills, will better prepare them to solve real-world problems. Yet few energy courses that approach energy topics from a human-centered perspective exist within engineering programs. Engineering students enrolled in energy programs often take such courses as supplemental to their course of study. This paper presents an engineering course that approaches energy education from a socio-technical perspective, emphasizing the complex interactions of energy technologies with sustainability dimensions. Course content and learning activities are structur..."
