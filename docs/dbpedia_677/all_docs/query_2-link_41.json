The second work of inseparable directors Bijan Birang and Masood Rasam after Ali and the Jungle Monster and a strange turn in directing.\n\nThis is a complex fantasy that will keep many with special taste satisfied. The plot is so strange that it makes it impossible to describe in a couple of lines. Enough to say that if you're going to the theatres for fun choose another movie. Cinderella is a movie for those who like to watch an odd film and have a lot to think about afterwards.\n\nCredits\n\nProduction: Bijan Birang, Masoud Rasam"
