        "text": "In Conversation: Robert De Niro\n\nRobert De Niro is one of the greatest film actors of any generation, and has also secured great respect in his roles as director, producer and co-founder of New York City’s annual Tribeca Film Festival. The films in which he has given memorable and often iconic performances over the course of his lauded career include some of the most significant works in the history of cinema. Most recently, De Niro delivered an outstanding performance in David O. Russell’s ‘Silver Linings Playbook’, which met with huge success at its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, winning the coveted People’s Choice Award. In an intimate conversation with Tribeca Enterprises’ Chief Creative Officer Geoff Gilmore, De Niro will discuss some of the unique moments of his illustrious career.\n\nSun, Nov 18, 07:00 PM\n\nEmerging Cinema of Change hosted by Northwestern University In Qatar\n\nWith the events of the past two years in the Arab world in mind, this panel examines the role of films and filmmakers during times of social change. As both witnesses and participants, Arab filmmakers have recorded, interpreted and inspired change. While there is an established tradition in Arab cinema of addressing social change, a new movement with a focus on youth and gender issues has recently emerged. What are the characteristics of this nascent movement? What role do these filmmakers play? What are their experiences? What types of social change are they advocating? To address these questions, this panel brings together a group of regionally known Arab filmmakers and artists from different generations and backgrounds. Their films represent at once the continuity of socially conscious films, and an evolving cinematic language and form. NB: This panel will be conducted in Arabic with simultaneous English translation\n\nThu, Nov 22, 04:00 PM\n\nTransmedia Storytelling in the Digital Age\n\nAs technology develops, it affects the way we tell, understand and enjoy stories. Reading novels, watching movies or telling an amusing tale over dinner with friends now compete with online communication and device interaction. What happens when the traditional ways we tell and consume stories converge with new technologies? From immersive games to interactive websites, multi-platform storytelling is becoming the new standard of audience engagement. DTFF presents a look at how filmmakers and media creators are choosing to tell their stories in the new age of social media and technology. Join a panel of industry experts who are pushing the boundaries of how we experience stories and what the future holds for gaming, film and storytelling in the 21st century.\n\nMon, Nov 19, 04:30 PM\n\nThe Global Landscape: Making ‘The Reluctant Fundamentalist’\n\n‘An Indian director making a film about a Pakistani man. That’s not an easy thing to do,’ says co-screenwriter Mohsin Hamid of Mira Nair’s film based on his novel. ‘The Reluctant Fundamentalist’ is the second major international production to receive financing from Doha Film Institute and screens at DTFF in the prestigious opening night spot. Nair’s most ambitious project to date, the film depicts two very different worlds coming together through the central character’s journey. It was shot in five cities on three continents with a truly international crew and a cast of Hollywood, Pakistani and Indian stars, led by Riz Ahmed, Kate Hudson, Om Puri, Shabana Azmi, Liev Schreiber and Kiefer Sutherland. Documentarian Marian Lacombe was on set to capture the process. DTFF is pleased to present her exclusive behind-the-scenes documentary followed by a discussion with Mira Nair. Join us for a unique insight into the filmmaking process, and an exploration of the practical and creative elements of the production.\n\nSun, Nov 18, 04:00 PM\n\nGoing Global: Can Bollywood Films Really Crossover?\n\nBollywood has witnessed some dramatic transformations over the last decade. The progress of technology and new models of film production, distribution and exhibition have given rise to a variety of innovative business models – and a growing audience base. This panel will trace the journey of commercial Hindi films into the global arena, and address some key issues: Why has Bollywood so far been unable to appeal to a broad global audience while smaller, independent Indian films continue to find international acclaim? How can Bollywood take its product to viewers outside and beyond the Indian diaspora? How can commercial Hindi cinema reach the next level of audience saturation? And just as importantly, does it even need to?\n\nWed, Nov 21, 04:00 PM\n\nValentino's Ghost: Extended Q&A with Michael Singh\n\nBrought up in India, director Michael Singh lives in Los Angeles. He has written and produced documentaries, films and television series, and directed several short documentaries. In ‘Valentino’s Ghost’, Singh explores the links between the images of Arabs and Muslims provided by American mass media over the course of the past century, and American foreign policy in the Middle East. To do so, he exploits a wealth of archival material, including images from classic films, news broadcasts and historical footage; interviewing journalists, media experts and leading intellectuals as he tries to uncover the truth of the representation of Arabs in media and film. The film was an official selection of the Venice Film Festival in September, where it generated a great deal of interest and dialogue. An extended Q&A session will be held after the film’s screening at DTFF allowing Singh and the audience can discuss the themes and issues raised in the film.\n\nThu, Nov 22, 06:30 PM\n\nNo Entry for Men: Extended Q&A with Rambod Javan\n\nRambod Javan’s ‘No Entry for Men’ met with huge success at the box office in Iran. A charming romantic comedy, it takes place in an all-girls’ school where, for the first time ever, a man is brought onto the teaching staff – and a hilarious battle of the sexes ensues. The film marks Javan’s second film as a director; prior to his film work, he directed television series. He is also a noted actor, known in his native Iran for his stage, film and television work. In an extended post-screening Q&A session, Javan will discuss ‘No Entry for Men’ and field questions from the audience\n\nMon, Nov 19, 06:00 PM\n\nKhaleeji Films: Overcoming Stereotypes\n\nTraditionally, storytelling has always played a central role in Arab culture. Do Khaleeji films rely on stereotypes, or are we at a turning point, looking to follow tradition and find new ways of creative expression? Four film professionals from the Gulf region will discuss contemporary Khaleeji storytelling and new regional and international influences on it. NB: This panel will be conducted in Arabic with simultaneous English translation\n\nWed, Nov 21, 02:00 PM\n\nExpress Yourself- Family Day Panel\n\nExpress Yourself! Families and youth are invited to explore how artists express themselves in film. Through demonstrations and hands-on participation, this family panel will explore the use of animation, dance, music and art in the movies and encourage everyone to find the artist within themselves.\n\nSat, Nov 24, 02:00 PM"
