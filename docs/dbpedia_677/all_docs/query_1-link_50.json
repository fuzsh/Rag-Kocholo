        "text": "Well, the Cannes Film Festival celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. But I remember when I first attended the festival – back in 1958!\n\nIt’s been a while…\n\nIt’s been a life…\n\nBack then, the festival had been running for nine years – and that already felt like an achievement!\n\nI was a budding and penniless film critic who had spent all his money on a train ride to the Croisette, feeling like somehow, and for some reason, I had to be there. Indeed, it would turn out to be one of the most important experiences of my life.\n\nIt was there I met François Truffaut.\n\nBack then, he was the talk of the town, especially among film critics, because of the vicious attacks he had directed at the festival for years through his articles in Arts. In them, he called Cannes “a failure dominated by compromises, schemes, and faux pas,” and predicted quite a different future for cinema: “The film of the future will be shot by adventurers… The film of tomorrow will be an act of love.”\n\nOn account of these articles, the festival had refused to grant Truffaut a press accreditation in 1958 – but he attended anyway (“I’ve been sneaking into movies for free all my life!” he would later tell me).\n\nTo be honest, I didn’t see what the big deal was. To me, Truffaut looked like a scrawny kid, little older than I was, with a belligerent look on his face – the look of an idealist, or an overprotective boyfriend, perhaps.\n\nWe met one night, on the beach. I’m not exactly sure about what time it was. It was probably a time late enough for actresses to take off their shoes and start dancing on tables full of empty glasses and champagne bottles.\n\nWe immediately got along great, François and I. His face lit up when I mentioned Jean Vigo, Alfred Hitchcock, Jean Renoir…\n\nWe lost track of time.\n\n“Have you seen THE CRANES ARE FLYING?” he asked me. “It’s fantastic!” I agreed.\n\nHow exciting!\n\n“Why do you hate the festival, when so many great films are screened here every year?” I asked him.\n\n“But so many horrible films are screened here also. So many horrible films are made every year. Besides, I feel like films are treated as the least important thing in a festival that is meant to celebrate them. This is no celebration! All the politics, administration, parties… It’s all bullshit.” Then he suddenly got up, shook the sand off his pants, and announced: “Things are going to change. And real soon too.”\n\n“Haven’t you ever read Émile Zola?” I replied. “Things are more than likely going to get worse. C'est la vie. And anyways, who’s going to change things?”\n\n“I’ll change things,” he said. “Or I’ll give it a shot… In any case, I want to make a feature. And I want to do it real soon too. I have to do it before I explode.”\n\nI rolled my eyes and didn’t think much of it. A movie to me was something that people made somewhere, somehow, and with a lot of money. I was happy (addicted) to watch them, talk about them, write about them… but to make a movie? How exactly does one do that?\n\nWe kept talking a while longer and decided to call it a night. He asked for my address so that we could write each other letters. I told him I didn’t have a permanent one at the moment. He gave me his and asked me to write him when I had settled down somewhere.\n\nBut I never did settle down anywhere… and I never did write to him. I regret that now.\n\nHe went back to his hotel. I stayed in my hotel (the beach).\n\nI didn’t see much of him for the rest of the festival. When we weren’t watching movies, a girl named Madeleine kept him busy. We exchanged a few words, talking about the films we had seen. But I mostly didn’t want to intrude. They seemed very fond of each other.\n\nAlthough I didn’t write much that year, I watched some incredible movies. Jacques Tati’s MY UNCLE, Ingmar Bergman’s BRINK OF LIFE, Satyajit Ray’s PARASH PATHAR…\n\nAnd then, the festival ended. THE CRANES ARE FLYING won the top prize! I was delighted.\n\nAs I hitch-hiked my way out of the Côte d'Azur, I kept thinking of the movies I had seen and wondered whether I’d come back next year. I also often thought of my friend François, and whether he would ever make a movie.\n\n*Intermission*\n\nA year later, I made the trip to Cannes once again, this time as a journalist sent by a prestigious publication, for which I was to write an overview of the festival. As I looked through the Official Selection, I was surprised to find among such names as Mario Soldati, Michael Powell, and Luis Buñuel that of my pal François.\n\nHe was to present a movie named THE 400 BLOWS.\n\nOn Monday, May 4, 1959, I was there, at a packed Palais des Festivals, for the film’s official premiere. François walked in the room, looking just as he had a year earlier when we spent the whole night talking about our love of cinema. This time, however, he was pale and tense, walking with Madeleine and a cheeky-looking kid by his side.\n\nSuddenly, I had a thought: what if this was a joke set up by the Cannes Film Festival at the expense of the critic who had attacked it so viciously for years! I imagined suits standing around a long table, laughing and saying: “Let him have a taste of his own medicine! That’ll teach him!” And I also briefly thought of Zola’s words, “The past was but the cemetery of our illusions.”\n\nHowever, when the lights came down, and the first images appeared on the screen, I knew that history was being made. It was nothing like I had ever seen before. It was personal, real, poetic, funny, sad… It was everything. It was a revolution! (The first battle-cry of the French New Wave. We all heard it!) We all knew it and began to applaud, even before the end of the movie, unable to contain our excitement.\n\nHell had been raised! A star was born! We all stood up and turned to look at cinema’s new enfant prodige. He smiled, relieved, overjoyed, triumphant. And in the midst of the commotion (the likes of which have rarely been seen since), I could swear I saw him looking at me. Yes, our eyes met briefly. And I could see that he no longer was a scruffy kid. He had evolved into an auteur – TRUFFAUT! – the adventurer making works of love.\n\nBut perhaps it didn’t happen. Perhaps our eyes never did meet that night. Perhaps, I wasn’t even there. Maybe everything I wrote never actually happened.\n\nAnd yet… I remember it so vividly. (I’m reliving it as I’m writing this.) I relive these memories every time I watch the movie. For it was, surely, a moment that changed my life.\n\nTo commemorate it, many years later…\n\nA life later…\n\nI tattooed the name TRUFFAUT on my arm, in the same font as the opening credits of his magnificent debut – a name that burnt the screen of the Cannes Film Festival like a lightning in 1959.\n\nWhat a time to be alive… then as now!"
