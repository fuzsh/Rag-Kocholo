Remove traces of your submission\n\nIf you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.\n\nIn particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.\n\nIf you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.\n\n4.

Mor eover,\n\napprehensions have been voiced in the United States that the \"resetting\"\n\nof relations with Russia results in the Washington's loss of influence in\n\nthe whole post-Soviet space.Moscow undoubtedly is satisfied with the\n\nchanges in Kiev's foreign policy that happened after President Viktor\n\nYanukovich took office, while the Ukrainian opposition speaks about the\n\n\"loss of sovereignty.\" Actually, experts say, Yanukovich had not much\n\nchoice.On US Independence Day - July 4 - US Secretary of State Hillary\n\nClinton will arrive in Ukraine on a two-day visit. In the view of the\n\nNezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, the significant date for the Americans is\n\nlinked with Washington's intention to return Ukraine into its influence\n\nzone.Apparently, Washington has grounds for concern. Ukrainian media have\n\nrecently published information that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)\n\nwill reorient the counterintelligence service from Russian to American\n\nsecret services. According to unnamed SBU officers cited by the newspaper,\n\nhead of the service Valery Khoroshkovsky is making reorganisation changing\n\npriorities in the work of secret services. Thus, starting from June the\n\nSBU counterintelligence department has allegedly stopped operations\n\nagainst FSB (Russian Federal Security Service) activity in Ukraine.On May\n\n19, the leadership of SBU and FSB signed a new agreement on the joint\n\nactivity according to which officers of the Russian security service got\n\nthe right to return to facilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Before\n\nlast December FSB representatives had worked in the Crimea, but had to\n\nleave the facilities under the SBU pressure.A number of Western media have\n\nmade publications expressing concern over the rapprochement between the\n\nUkrainian and Russian security services. The more so that the developments\n\nare observed against the background of a new foreign policy course not\n\nenvisaging admission to NATO proclaimed by the Ukrainian leadership.Head o\n\nf the parliamentary committee on international affairs Oleg Bilorus notes\n\nthat the West has started to fear Ukraine's involvement in the CSTO\n\n(Collective Security Treaty Organisation) system. The West, earlier\n\ninterested in normalisation of Ukraine-Russia relations, now is trying,\n\naccording to the official, to create the balance of interests, \"so that to\n\nprevent Ukraine's final dragging into Russia's field of influence.\"On the\n\neve of his 100th day in office, June 3, Ukrainian President Viktor\n\nYanukovich made an address to the citizens and the most important aspects\n\nof his speech were the words about the country's foreign policy.\"Over a\n\nshort period of time we have managed to stabilise relations with the key\n\npartners of Ukraine - the EU, United States and Russia, to reach a\n\nqualitatively new level of dialogue and cooperation with international\n\norganisations and institutions,\" Yanukovich said. \"We will prepare a new\n\n10-year programme of socio-economic cooperation that will allow us to\n\nfulfil our framework friendship agreement. It is our firm position to have\n\nrelations with Russia developing on the rise,\" he stated.Political\n\nanalysts noted that the last phrase was one of the key ones, and 100 days\n\nfor Yanukovich were enough to radically change not only the internal, but\n\nalso the foreign policy of the country.Not long before his address to the\n\nnation the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) approved in the first reading the\n\nlaw \"On the principles of the internal and external policy of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe document not just corrects the foreign political orientation of Kiev,\n\nbut in essence, cancels the course towards the country's accession to NATO\n\nthat had been proclaimed by ex-President Viktor Yushchenko. It contains\n\nnot a single word that the strategic trend of the foreign policy is\n\nEuro-Atlantic integration. Instead the law says that the \"main principle\n\nof the country's foreign policy is the observance by Ukraine of the\n\nnon-aligned policy, which means having no membership in military-political\n\nunions.\"Thus, the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO, so much feared by\n\nMoscow, is no longer on the agenda.\"Yanukovich has ironed out all former\n\ndifferences in relations with Moscow,\" the Kommersant daily writes. \"He\n\nleft the Russian Black Sea Fleet in the Crimea until 2042. He closed the\n\nHolodomor issue stating that it is not genocide of Ukrainians at all, but\n\nthe common tragedy of the peoples of the former USSR. He also contributed\n\nto the cancellation of the decrees of Viktor Yushchenko on awarding the\n\nHero of Ukraine title to Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevich. He promised\n\nto protect the rights of Russians and ensure for them the possibility to\n\nuse their native language.\"\"Ukraine has restored the interrupted five\n\nyears ago dialogue with Russia and resumed the strategic partnership\n\nformula. The interstate commission at the level of the heads of state has\n\nat last started to work. Both countries are getting down to the business\n\nof historical importance - demarcation of the ground border,\" Yanukovich\n\nsummarised the results of the work with Russia.Russia took with\n\nsatisfaction Kiev's statements that Ukraine no longer seeks NATO\n\nmembership.Editor-in-chief of the \"Russia in Global Politics\" magazine\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, cited by the er.ru Internet portal, regards the\n\nimprovement of Kiev-Moscow relations as Yanukovich's merit. \"The main\n\nachievement of Yanukovich, undoubtedly, is the settlement of relations\n\nwith Russia that have qualitatively changed over these 100 days. One can\n\nbe certain that there will be no more gas wars similar to the developments\n\n1.5 years ago, the same as there will be no aggravation of relations in\n\nconnection with the future of the fleet and the potential NATO\n\nmembership,\" Lukyanov said.He also noted that as a matter of fact, the new\n\nUkrainian president simply had no other options. \"Now Uk raine is not a\n\npriority for anybody except Russia, and so it should not count on special\n\nattention from other countries - either the United States or EU. They at\n\npresent cannot do anything for objective reasons - they all have their\n\ninternal problems. So Yanukovich is doing what he actually can at\n\npresent,\" the official said.According to a study of the Sociology\n\nInstitute of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences conducted in 2009,\n\nthe idea of Ukraine's joining the Russia-Belarus Union was taken \"rather\n\npositively\" by 59.3 percent of those polled, \"rather negatively\" - by\n\nalmost three times less - 20.8 percent.Nevertheless, the Ukrainian\n\nopposition has again accused the power of pursuing a pro-Russian course\n\nthat, in their opinion, undermines the Ukrainian sovereignty and\n\nindependence. However, experts in Kiev say that Yanukovich has already\n\nmanaged to build such a system of mutual relationship inside the country\n\nand with the foreign partners, th at the new power can so far not be\n\nconcerned over a wide protest wave.\"The new president's tough grip has\n\nbeen on its merits evaluated both in Ukraine and abroad, as over a couple\n\nof months he has managed to stop the many-year political crisis in\n\nUkraine. He has secured the formation in the Rada of a viable and obedient\n\nmajority, snap election of a new government, reformatting of the whole\n\nsystem of local self-government bodies,\" writes the Nezavisimaya\n\nGazeta.(Description of Source: Moscow ITAR-TASS in English -- Main\n\ngovernment information agency)\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

The\n\ncenter-s founder,Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, has said that one purpose of the\n\nCordoba House is to'bridge and heal the divide between Muslims and other\n\nAmericans.'The resistance to building the Cordoba House has demonstrated\n\nthe need for sucha center, which can educate and inform Americans about\n\nIslam and show thatMuslims are partners in building a prosperous and\n\npeaceful America. Theprotesters, however, were concerned that the center\n\nwill be disrespectful tothe lives lost on 9/11 and will fuel terrorism, a\n\nclaim that not only incitestensions between the local Muslim and\n\nnon-Muslim community, but distorts theimage of Muslim Americans.Today,\n\nMuslims are struggling to communicate that Islam is indeed a\n\npeacefulreligion and that people of all faiths can build a better world\n\ntogether. Twoleaders from the Muslim American community, Rauf and Daisy\n\nKhan, have tried todo just that through years of dedicated service - since\n\n1983. Theyconceived of the Cordoba House project as a vehicle for Muslim\n\nAmericanadvancement and a home where all Americans - regardless of their\n\nbeliefs- can engage in dialogue and discover similar values and\n\naspirations.Rauf, who chairs the multi-faith, multi-national Cordoba\n\nInitiative, whosemission is to improve Muslim-Western relations, and Khan,\n\nwho leads theAmerican Society for Muslim Advancement (ASMA), a New\n\nYork-based non-profitworking to elevate the discourse on Islam, envision\n\nthe Cordoba House as acultural center, comprising a prayer space, library,\n\nart studio, theater,meditation room, auditorium and swimming pool. The\n\ncenter would also provideeducational programs and childcare services, a\n\nrestaurant, culinary preparationprograms and art exhibitions.Once open,\n\nthe center will create over 150 full-time and 500 part-time jobs,and be\n\nhoused in a building which was vacant and shuttered for nine yearsbefore\n\nthe pair purchased it. The space, Rauf and Khan hope, will not\n\nbespecifically for Muslims but will serve as a community space for all\n\nNewYorkers, similar to Ne w York-s 92nd Street Y, which was founded by\n\naJewish community organization, but serves people of all\n\nbackgrounds.Building this cultural and community center is symbolic in\n\nmany ways, anddemonstrates that New York - and by extension the United\n\nStates -is a place that respects Islam and acknowledges the presence of\n\nMuslimAmericans, including those who died in 9/11 and those serving in the\n\nUSmilitary in Iraq and Afghanistan.The House has the support of many of\n\nNew York-s most prominent Christianand Jewish clergy, including the\n\nReverend Canon Anne Mallonee of Trinity Churchin lower Manhattan; elected\n\nofficials such as Manhattan Borough President ScottStringer and\n\nCongressman Jerry Nadler; local foundations including the New\n\nYorkCommunity Trust, which is the largest private funder of\n\nnon-profitorganizations in New York City; and a range of Muslim\n\nleaders.Rauf, who has a tremendous record in scholarship and is the imam\n\nof a New YorkCity mosque, is being portrayed as a radical in disguise\n\nwhose goal is to bringIslamic law to America.

This is a deep and\n\nserious issue formainstream Muslims, who see this as out-and-out racism\n\nwhen they are trying tochange the negative image of Islam.While Rauf\n\nstated the Cordoba House serves to 'bridge' allAmericans - Muslim and\n\nnon-Muslim alike, this is also the sort of projectthat Americans have been\n\nyearning for when they ask: 'Where are the--moderate- Muslims?'

It will\n\nfocus on stepping up the fight against drug trafficking from Afghanistan,\n\nwhich has grown dramatically in the recent years.The forum will be\n\nattended by heads of anti-drug authorities and law enforcement agencies\n\nfrom various countries, Russian and foreign experts, representatives from\n\nsuch international organizations as the United Nations, the Collective\n\nSecurity Treaty Organization, NATO and the Shanghai Cooperation\n\nOrganization.The situation around drug production in Afghanistan has\n\ngained a catastrophic character. Some 100,000 people died globally from\n\nAfghan drugs in 2009 alone. In all, Afghan-made opiates have claimed one\n\nmillion human lives in the past decade, and 16 million more ruined their\n\nhealth.As compared to 2001, when the United States and NATO brought their\n\ntroops to Afghanist an, opiates production there has increased by 44\n\ntimes. According to the United Nations information, more than thousand ton\n\nof pure heroin, i.e. a trillion of fixes, is now kept at warehouses.\n\nAfghanistan is currently producing 100 percent of the world's heroin.The\n\ncurrent efforts are obviously not enough to stop drug trafficking from\n\nAfghanistan. Russia's anti-drug authority has repeatedly criticized the\n\nposition of the United Nations and NATO over their unwillingness to solve\n\nthis problem. \"The aims of the UN anti-drug declaration have failed, NATO\n\nhas failed to exterminate drugs and is unlikely to do so,\" said head of\n\nthe Russian Federal Service for Control over Drugs Viktor Ivanov. \"The\n\nUnited Nations has, to a larger extent, withdrawn from programs in this\n\nsphere delegating relevant functions to NATO, while the latter has further\n\ndelegated the fight against drug production in Afghanistan to national and\n\neven to provincial authorities.\"While heroin pr oduction in Afghanistan is\n\non the rise, the number of arrested drug dealers is on the decrease. Thus,\n\nthe number of arrested drug dealers dropped by 13 times and the number of\n\neliminated drug laboratories dropped 10-fold from 248 in 2007 to 25 in\n\n2009.Russia has come to be faced with a \"heroine epidemics.\" According to\n\nofficial statistics, the number of drug addicts in Russia has gone up\n\n20-fold in the past 20 years to reach two to two and a half million\n\npeople, with 90 percent of them being heroine addicts.From 30,000 to\n\n40,000 Russians die from drugs annually. Their average age is 28 years\n\nold. According to the anti-drug authority, up to 7 billion heroin fixes\n\nreach the country annually.Last year, according to the Russian anti-drug\n\nauthority, 46 tons of drugs were seized and heroine and hashish of the\n\nAfghan origin accounted for 90 percent.The Afghan drug threat is looming\n\nover other countries as well. Thus, in terms of opiates consumption the\n\nEuropean Union (711 tons) has outstripped Russia (549 tons). Moreover,\n\nheroin overdosing claims 50 times as much lives in the NATO countries as\n\nNATO casualties in Afghanistan.However, Afghan drug production has never\n\nbeen the subject of a separate consideration by the UN Security Council.\n\nRussia has proposed target anti-drug measures, including chemical\n\nextermination of drug crops, raising the problem's status to the \"level of\n\na threat to global peace and security,\" forming an international anti-drug\n\ncoalition, and UN sanctions against landlords providing their land for\n\npoppy growing.(Description of Source: Moscow ITAR-TASS in English -- Main\n\ngovernment information agency)\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

We are jointly\n\nworking for the political settlement, strengthening the national army and\n\npolice,\" he said.However, he noted, the international anti-drug laws\n\nneeded to be tuned to take into account the changing situation in the\n\nworld, particularly, in Afghanistan and Latin America. \"Priority should be\n\ngiven to efficient methods, joint operations and measures to improve the\n\ninternational anti-drug laws,\" he stressed.The situation around drug\n\nproduction in Afghanistan has gained a catastrophic character.

These operations backfired on his country,\n\nand his wars increased terrorism in the world as the United States fought\n\nagainst it.\n\nHas the situation changed with Barack Obama? Many people said that the\n\nnational defense strategy was devoid of any talk about the war on\n\nterrorism. Nevertheless, the other principles of the strategy do not\n\nappear to be new. They call for defeating Al-Qa'ida and the extremists who\n\nsupport it in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the entire world, preventing the\n\nproliferation of nuclear and biological weapons (the focus is on Iran and\n\nNorth Korea, rather than Israel), consolidating peace and security in the\n\ngreater Middle East, and spreading democracy and freedom around the world.\n\nI believe that the aforementioned policy was also the policy of the Bush\n\nadministration and that it does not differ much from Bush's defense\n\nstrategy or his speech in Sharm al-Shaykh during the annual conference of\n\nthe World Economic Forum.\n\nIf there is any difference between Presidents Bush and Obama it is that\n\nthe former is a \"cowboy\" who challenged Al-Qa'ida to a showdown and that\n\nthe latter puts on a pair of silk gloves and speaks in accordance with\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's advice.\n\nThe US defense budget reache d a record number, $708 billion, and my\n\nmodest experience of this budget says that many defense appropriations are\n\nregistered under other spending items of departments other than the\n\nPentagon and that the aforementioned number means that the budget with its\n\nappendixes and other provisions will reach $1 trillion in a bankrupt\n\ncountry.\n\nIn fact, when the Obama administration presented next year's budget, it\n\nasked for an additional $30 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nPersonally, I do not remember that a year passed since 2001 without the\n\nadministration asking for additional spending on its wars.\n\nIt is known that there are 737 US military bases all over the world in\n\nwhich 200,000 of the original 1.8 million US soldiers are deployed,\n\ntogether with half a million other employees of the US Defense Department.\n\nThe spending in these bases is also in the hundreds of billions.\n\nAll of the above coincided with a large increase in the number and\n\narmament of the Special Forces. Early this year, these forces operated in\n\n60 states and now operate in 77 states from the Far East, the Middle East,\n\nand Africa to Latin America and everywhere. The declared goal is to resist\n\nAl-Qa'ida and terrorist groups, and the chosen weapon for this purpose is\n\npilotless planes. The United Nations called for stopping the use of this\n\nweapon because it kills civilians.\n\nDescribing the job of these forces, the Washington Post said it is a\n\n\"secret war\". The paper added that these forces operate unilaterally or in\n\ncooperation with some other states' forces.\n\nWhen colleague Ghassan Sharbil and I were in Yemen two months ago, we saw\n\nUS soldiers take over from other soldiers who had ended their term of\n\nservice. I remember the scene because I saw two of the leaving soldiers\n\ncarry two sacks of kat attached to their waists. One of them laughingly\n\nspoke to me about his pleasure at chewing kat.\n\nThe Special Forces carry out joint or unilateral operations and train\n\nlocal forces on fighting terrorism. Under the Obama administration, their\n\nbudget increased by 5. 7% to reach $6.3 billion, in addition to emergency\n\nappropriations amounting to $3.5 billion.\n\nDescribing the work of these forces, John Brennan, antiterrorism director\n\nat the White House, said: \"We will not be contented with a response after\n\nthe event (meaning after a terrorist attack). Rather, we will fight\n\nAl-Qa'ida and the extremist groups that are associated with it where they\n\nmake plans and receive training in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia,\n\nand other countries.\" This statement is exactly of the kind of the\n\nstatement that was made by the administration of Bush Junior. It said: \"We\n\nfight them there so that we will not have to fight them here (in the\n\nstreets of US cities).\"\n\nI see no large difference between the strategies of the former and current\n\nadministrations, except the fact that Obama speaks softly a nd does not\n\nappear to be enthusiastic about waging preemptive wars for which his\n\npredecessor looked.\n\nI say this and then defend Obama. He is not weak or hesitant, as some of\n\nhis Republican opponents say. Rather, I find him practical, flexible, and\n\ncautious. He avoids confrontation as much as he can. Perhaps, he will have\n\nmore freedom to work after the midterm elections. He has not yet fulfilled\n\nhis promises to the Islamic world, to which we listened in his speech in\n\nCairo one year ago.\n\nAlso, he has not confronted Binyamin Netanyahu on the peace issue or the\n\nsettlement activity in Jerusalem itself, has not closed the Guantanamo\n\nDetention Camp, and has not reached a solution with Iran. Instead, he\n\npursued the previous policy of sanctions.\n\nIn spite of all the aforementioned and other facts, Barack Obama is a\n\nthousand times better than George Bush, and what remains for him to do is\n\nachieve the hopes that are pinned on his presidency.\n\n(Description of S ource: London Al-Hayah Online in Arabic -- Website of\n\ninfluential Saudi-owned London pan-Arab daily.
