        "text": "Influence of southern oscillation on autumn rainfall in Iran (1951-2011)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoghani, Rabbaneh; Soltani, Saeid; Bashari, Hossein\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the relationships between southern oscillation and autumn (October-December) rainfall in Iran. It also sought to identify the possible physical mechanisms involved in the mentioned relationships by analyzing observational atmospheric data. Analyses were based on monthly rainfall data from 50 synoptic stations with at least 35 years of records up to the end of 2011. Autumn rainfall time series were grouped by the average Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and SOI phase methods. Significant differences between rainfall groups in each method were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric tests. Their relationships were also validated using the linear error in probability space (LEPS) test. The results showed that average SOI and SOI phases during July-September were related with autumn rainfall in some regions located in the west and northwest of Iran, west coasts of the Caspian Sea and southern Alborz Mountains. The El NiÃ±o (negative) and La NiÃ±a (positive) phases were associated with increased and decreased autumn rainfall, respectively. Our findings also demonstrated the persistence of Southern Pacific Ocean's pressure signals on autumn rainfall in Iran. Geopotential height patterns were totally different in the selected El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a years over Iran. During the El NiÃ±o years, a cyclone was formed over the north of Iran and an anticyclone existed over the Mediterranean Sea. During La NiÃ±a years, the cyclone shifted towards the Mediterranean Sea and an anticyclone developed over Iran. While these El NiÃ±o conditions increased autumn rainfall in Iran, the opposite conditions during the La NiÃ±a phase decreased rainfall in the country. In conclusion, development of rainfall prediction models based on the SOI can facilitate agricultural and water resources management in Iran.\n\nHospital Mortality Associated with Stroke in Southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBorhani-Haghighi, Afshin; Safari, Rasool; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Soleimani, Faroq; Sharifian, Maryam; Yektaparast Kashkuli, Sara; Nayebi Khayatghuchani, Mahsa; Azadi, Mahbube; Shariat, Abdolhamid; Safari, Anahid; Bagheri Lankarani, Kamran; Alshekhlee, Amer; Cruz-Flores, Salvador\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground: Unlike the western hemisphere, information about stroke epidemiology in southern Iran is scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the main epidemiological characteristics of patients with stroke and its mortality rate in southern Iran. Methods: AÂ retrospective, single-center, hospital-based longitudinal study was performed at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz, Southern Iran. Patients with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th editions, for the period between 2001 and 2010. Demographics including age, sex, area of residence, socioeconomic status, length of hospital stay, and discharge destinations were analyzed in association with mortality. Results: 16351 patients with a mean age of 63.4 years (95% CI: 63.1, 63.6) were included in this analysis. Men were slightly predominant (53.6% vs. 46.4%). Forty-seven percent of the total sample was older than 65,17% were younger than 45, and 2.6% were children younger than 18. The mean hospital stay was 6.3 days (95% CI: 6.2, 6.4). Among all types of strokes, the overall hospital mortality was 20.5%. Multiple logistic regression revealed significantly higher in-hospital mortality in women and children (P<0.001) but not in patients with low socioeconomic status or from rural areas. During the study period, the mortality proportions increased from 17.8% to 22.2%. Conclusion: In comparison to western countries, a larger proportion of our patients were young adults and the mortality rate was higher.

Common apoE alleles are in association with an increase in risk for central nervous and cardiovascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, hyperlipoproteinemia and stroke. ApoE3 is known as the most frequent allele in all populations, while association of apoE gene polymorphism with reported diseases have mostly been related to other two major alleles especially apoE4. To determine of apoE alleles frequencies in Southern Iran and comparison of those frequencies with other populations. DNA was extracted from the whole blood of 198 healthy unrelated candidates from population of Fars Province, Southern Iran, for apoE genotyping who were checked up by a physician. The frequencies of apoE alleles were compared with other populations by chi(2) test. The frequencies of E2, E3 and E4 were 0.063, 0.886 and 0.051 respectively. These values were similar to those reported from populations of Kuwait, Oman, Lebanon, India, Turkey, Greece, Spain, Sardinia Islands of Italy and two Iranian populations but were different from South of Italy and Caucasians in other Europe regions, American, American-Indian, African, East Asian and Saudi populations (P < 0.05). The frequency of E4 allele as a genetic risk factor for some multifactorial diseases in the population of Southern Iran is in the lowest reported amounts in the world. Iranian population has Caucasoid origin but differs from some Caucasian populations in Europe and America. The results of present study are in agreement with the historical evidences which show admixture of Iranian population with other populations and some studies based on genetic polymorphisms in the population of Southern Iran.\n\nRelapsing fever causative agent in Southern Iran is a closely related species to East African borreliae.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaddaf, Saied Reza; Ghazinezhad, Behnaz; Kazemirad, Elham; Cutler, Sally Jane\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe obtained two blood samples from relapsing fever patients residing in Jask County, Hormozgan Province, southern Iran in 2013. Sequencing of a partial fragment of glpQ from two samples, and further characterization of one of them by analyzing flaB gene, and 16S-23S spacer (IGS) revealed the greatest sequence identity with East African borreliae, Borrelia recurrentis, and Borrelia duttonii, and Borrelia microti from Iran. Phylogenetic analyses of glpQ, flaB, and concatenated sequences (glpQ, flab, and IGS) clustered these sequences amongst East African Relapsing fever borreliae and B. microti from Iran. However, the more discriminatory IGS disclosed a unique 8-bp signature (CAGCCTAA) separating these from B. microti and indeed other relapsing fever borreliae. In southern Iran, relapsing fever cases are mostly from localities in which O. erraticus ticks, the notorious vector of B. microti, prevail. There are chances that this argasid tick serves as a host and vector of several closely related species or ecotypes including the one we identified in the present study. The distribution of this Borrelia species remains to be elucidated, but it is assumed to be endemic to lowland areas of the Hormozgan Province, as well as Sistan va Baluchistan in the southeast and South Khorasan (in Persian: Khorasan-e Jonobi) in the east of Iran.

This study investigated the incidence and the preventive measures in self-burn in Fars Province, southern Iran. METHODS This study was a longitudinal prospective design on trend of self-inflicted burn injuries in Fars province after setting up a regional multidisciplinary preventive plan (2009-2012). RESULTS From 18862 admitted patients, 388 (2%) committed self-burning. While the incidence showed a constant decrease in proportion of suicidal cases among all admitted patients (2.5% to 1.6%). The mean age of self-burning victims ranged from 28.3Â±10.8 to 30.3Â±11.7 years. The female victims comprised 67.4% of all suicidal burn patients (Female to male ratio: 2.18). The leading causes of suicide commitment were familial conflicts (75.6%) and psychological problems (16.7%) CONCLUSION It is crucial to continue the regional preventive programs and pave the way to set up national, and even international collaborations to alleviate relevant financial, social, cultural and infrastructural difficulties in order to have lower incidence for this dramatic issue.

Although it is well described in African and some Arabic countries, data from Iran are scarce. To describe the epidemiology, regional characteristics, knowledge, and attitude toward FGM/C in Southern Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted during a 36-month period from 2010 to 2013 in Hormozgan, a southern province of Iran near the Persian Gulf. We included 780 women in six major rural areas of the province who referred to healthcare centers for vaccination, midwifery, or family planning services. All participants underwent complete pelvic examination to determine the type of FGM. The questionnaire consisted of several sections such as demographic and baseline characteristics, and two self-report sections addressing the knowledge and attitude toward FGM/C and its complications. Baseline sociodemographic characteristics including age, educational level, marital status, religion, and nationality were the independent variables. Among the participants, 535 (68.5%) had undergone FGM/C. FGM/C was associated with higher age (Pâ=â0.002), Afghan nationality (Pâ=â0.003), Sunni Islam as religion (Pâ=â0.019), illiteracy (Pâ<â0.001), and family history of FGM/C in mother (Pâ<â0.001), sister (Pâ<â0.001), and grandmother (Pâ<â0.001). Ancient traditions in the area (57.1%) were mentioned as the most important factor leading to FMG/C. Urinary tract infection was the most common reported complication (60.4%). FGM/C is a common practice in rural areas of Southern Iran. It is associated with increased age, illiteracy, Sunni Islam religion, Afghan nationality, and positive family history. Lack of knowledge toward FGM/C is the main cause of its high prevalence and continuation in the area.

Methods: The data were collected from 24000 newborn babies from Fars Province, southern Iran. The enzymatic calorimetric test was done on their blood and Red questions from the childrenâs parents. For treatment, free lactose milk or soya milk have been used for the feeding of the newborns. Results: The prevalence of galactosemia in Fars Province was 5:24000 in neonates, being more than those reported among the white race are and Asians are. The maximum clinical symptoms before diet in 10 days after birth were vomiting and jaundice and those after using diet were sepsis, full fontanels, and hepatic failure. Conclusion: Consanguineous marriage is a major cause of inheritance of the disease in Iran. The number of familial marriage in childrenâs parents was very high. Screening should be executed for all of the families with a history of Galactosemia in Iran. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large study report on the prevalence of Galactosemia in Iran.

It was originally described in the genus PseudophoxinusÂ as (Pseudophoxinus persidis) and then Petroleuciscus (as Petroleuciscus persidis). In this study, we examined phylogenetic relationships of the Iranian Persian chub with other relatives in the family Cyprinidae based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to estimate the phylogenetic (and taxonomic) position of the species. Our molecular phylogenies show that new fish sequences from the drainages in southern Iran are clustered with sequences of the genus Acanthobrama from GenBank while the sequences from two other genera (PseudophoxinusÂ and Petroleuciscus) are in distinct clade. Therefore, we conclude that the populations of Persian Chub in drainages of southern Iran (i.e., Kol, Kor, Maharlu and Persis) belong to the genus Acanthobrama and species Acanthobrama persidis. The predicted geographic distributions for the species showed a large area of suitable climate for A. persidis across south and west of Iran especially in the Kor River basin. Some other parts in the Persis and Tigris are also might have been suitable habitats for this cyprinid species showing possible dispersal route of Acanthobrama from Tigris to the Persis, Kor and Kol basins.

This study was designed to examine the behaviors of adolescent pedestrians in southern Iran. This is a descriptive analytical cross-sectional study. The study population consisted of high school students in Shiraz, capital city of Fars Province, Iran. Five hundred and sixteen students were selected by multi-stage sampling. Data were collected by the use of three questionnaires, which included Persian copies of adolescent road user behavior questionnaire (ARBQ), Duke University Religious Index (DUREL), as well as the context and independent variables questionnaire. The results showed that a decrease in dangerous behaviors on the road resulted in an increase in respondents' intrinsic religiosity. Also, engagement in unsafe crossing behavior in the road decreased with increasing respondents' intrinsic religiosity. Another finding showed that female students were less involved in dangerous play and planned protective behaviors on the road. Findings clearly indicate that intrinsic religiosity has a significant role in reducing the risky road behaviors of students. Hence, religion may improve road safety in school students' road behavior in Iran. Copyright Â© 2017 Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.

Methods Wild live An. stephensi samples were collected from different malarious areas in southern Iran. The biological forms were identified based on number of egg-ridges. Molecular characterization of biological forms was verified by analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and II (mtDNA-COI/COII). The Plasmodium infection was examined in the wild female specimens by species-specific nestedâPCR method. Results Results showed that all three biological forms including mysorensis, intermediate and type are present in the study areas. Molecular investigations revealed no genetic variation between mtDNA COI/COII sequences of the biological forms and no Plasmodium parasites was detected in the collected mosquito samples. Conclusions Presence of three biological forms with identical sequences showed that the known biological forms belong to a single taxon and the various vectorial capacities reported for these forms are more likely corresponded to other epidemiological factors than to the morphotype of the populations. Lack of malaria parasite infection in An. stephensi, the most important vector of malaria, may be partly due to the success and achievement of ongoing active malaria control program in the region. PMID:24144130\n\nA survey of Euphorinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) of southern Iran, with description of a new species.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmeri, Ali; Talebi, Ali Asghar; Rakhshani, Ehsan; Beyarslan, Ahmet; Kamali, Karim\n\n2014-12-23\n\nA faunistic survey of Euphorinae (Hym., Braconidae) in southern Iran, as well as an updated checklist of the genera and species in Iran, are presented. Sampling was performed using Malaise traps at different locations of Hormozgan province and Qeshm Island in Persian Gulf during 2011-2013. In total, 38 species belonging to 10 genera are listed from Iran. The recorded species belong to the following genera: Allurus Forster, 1862 (two species), Chrysopophthorus Goidanich 1948 (one species), Dinocampus Forster, 1862 (one species), Ecclitura Kokujev, 1902 (one species), Leiophron Nees von Esenbeck, 1819 (10 species), Meteorus Haliday, 1835 (12 species), Perilitus Nees von Esenbeck, 1819 (five species), Syntretus Forster 1862 (three species), Wesmaelia Foerster, 1862 (one species) and Zele Curtis, 1832 (two species). Allurus lituratus (Haliday 1835), Dinocampus coccinellae (Schrank, 1802), Leiophron (Peristenus) grandiceps (Thomson 1892), Meteorus rubens (Nees, 1811) and Wesmaelia petiolata (Wollaston, 1858) are new records for Hormozgan province and Leiophron (Peristenus) grandiceps (Thomson 1892) is recorded for the first time from Iran. In addition, Meteorus breviterebratus Ameri, Talebi & Beyarslan sp. n. is newly described and illustrated.Â\n\nA new species of Acanthodactylus Fitzinger 1834 (Sauria: Lacertidae) from southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nNastaran, Heidari; Nasrullah Rastegar, Pouyani; Eskandar, Rastegar-Pouyani; Mehdi, Rajabizadeh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA new and distinctive species of lacertid genus Acanthodactylus Fitzinger, 1834 is described from 7 km east of Khamir Port, Hormozgan Province, southern Iran at an elevation of 30-40m above sea level (asl). Analyses of morphological characters and the comparison with other formerly known species of this genus have proven the status of this taxon as a new, distinct species. Combinations of scalation characters and distinct morphology, coloration and habitat peculiarities in calcareous mountains distinguish Acanthodactylus khamirensis sp.nov from all remaining species of the genus in the area. In order to show the validity of the new species, we carried out a comparative statistical analysis using 13 metric and six meristic morphological characters on all of the neighboring congeners of the new species using descriptive (one-way ANOVA) as well as multivariate analyses (PCA and DFA). The results confirm the specific status of the new taxon. Detailed information and an updated identification key for the genus A canthodactylus in Iran are presented.\n\nMOLECULAR SURVEILLANCE OF Plasmodium vivax AND Plasmodium falciparum DHFR MUTATIONS IN ISOLATES FROM SOUTHERN IRAN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSHARIFI-SARASIABI, Khojasteh; HAGHIGHI, Ali; KAZEMI, Bahram; TAGHIPOUR, Niloofar; MOJARAD, Ehsan Nazemalhosseini; GACHKAR, Latif\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn Iran, both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum malaria have been detected, but P. vivax is the predominant species. Point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene in both Plasmodia are the major mechanisms of pyrimethamine resistance. From April 2007 to June 2009, a total of 134 blood samples in two endemic areas of southern Iran were collected from patients infected with P. vivax and P. falciparum. The isolates were analyzed for P. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) point mutations using various PCR-based methods. The majority of the isolates (72.9%) had wild type amino acids at five codons of pvdhfr. Amongst mutant isolates, the most common pvdhfr alleles were double mutant in 58 and 117 amino acids (58R-117N). Triple mutation in 57, 58, and 117 amino acids (57L/58R/117N) was identified for the first time in the pvdhfr gene of Iranian P. vivax isolates. All the P. falciparumsamples analyzed (n = 16) possessed a double mutant pfdhfrallele (59R/108N) and retained a wild-type mutation at position 51. This may be attributed to the fact that the falciparum malaria patients were treated using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Iran. The presence of mutant haplotypes in P. vivax is worrying, but has not yet reached an alarming threshold regarding drugs such as SP. The results of this study reinforce the importance of performing a molecular surveillance by means of a continuous chemoresistance assessment. PMID:27007559\n\nSix-fold difference in the stomach cancer mortality rate between northern and southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nZendehdel, Kazem; Marzban, Maryam; Nahvijou, Azin; Jafari, Nahid\n\n2012-12-01\n\nStomach cancer is the most common cancer in Iran. A multi-ethnic population and wide variation in the environmental risk factors may lead to variations in cancer risk within this country. We have designed an ecological study and evaluated geographical variation regarding mortality from stomach cancer and its established risk factors in Iran.Â We used the Iranian National Causes of Death Registry and estimated the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) of stomach cancer in 29 Iranian provinces, stratified by sex and area of residence (rural/urban).Â The average ASMR of stomach cancer among Iranian males was 15 per 100,000 and for females it was 8.1 per 100,000. The highest and lowest mortality rates were observed in Kurdistan with an ASMR of 29.1 per 100,000 in northwestern Iran and Hormozgan that had an ASMR of 5.0 per 100,000 in southern Iran. Males had approximately a two-fold higher ASMR compared to females, as did rural residents when compared with urban residents. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was about 90% in the province of Ardabil (a high-risk area) and 27% in the province of Sistan-Baluchistan (a low-risk area).Â The wide geographical variation and high mortality rate of stomach cancer in Iran is likely due to differences in the exposure to the environmental risk factors among people living in the high- and low-risk areas, particularly H. pylori infection, a well-established risk factor of stomach cancer.\n\nThe effects of water-pipe smoking on birth weight: a population-based prospective cohort study in southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nNematollahi, Shahrzad; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Foroushani, Abbas Rahimi; Mahmoodi, Mahmood; Alavi, Azin; Shekari, Mohammad; Holakouie-Naieni, Kourosh\n\n2018-01-01\n\nConsecutive community health assessments revealed that water-pipe smoking in women and impaired growth in children were among the main health concerns in suburban communities in southern Iran. The aim of the present study was to identify the effects of water-pipe smoking during pregnancy on birth weight. Data from a population-based prospective cohort study of 714 singleton live pregnancies in the suburbs of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran in 2016-2018 were used in this study. Data about water-pipe smoking patterns and birth weight were collected by questionnaires during and after the pregnancy. Low birth weight (LBW) was defined as a birth weight below 2,500 g. Statistical analyses were performed using generalized linear models, and the results were presented in terms of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fifty (8.2%) of the study subjects smoked water-pipe. The adjusted risk of LBW increased 2-fold in water-pipe smokers (adjusted RR [aRR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.71), and by 2.0% for each 1-year increase in the duration of water-pipe smoking (aRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.05). Our results showed that water-pipe smoking during pregnancy was an important risk factor for LBW in this population sample from southern Iran. The introduction of regulations onto prevent water-pipe smoking and the implementation of community health action plans aiming at empowering women and increasing women's knowledge and awareness regarding the health consequences of water-pipe smoking are proposed.\n\nThe prevalence of dyspepsia symptoms and its correlation with the quality of life among Qashqai Turkish migrating nomads in Fars Province, Southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMasoumi, Seyed Jalil; Mehrabani, Davood; Moradi, Fariba; Zare, Najaf; Saberi-Firouzi, Mehdi; Mazloom, Zohreh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives: To determine the prevalence of dyspepsia and its correlation with quality of life in Fars Qashqai Turkish migrating nomads from Southern Iran. Methods: During 2010 we enrolled 397 Qashqai migrating nomads from Southern Iran who were 25 years of age or older. Participants completed a questionnaire that consisted of demographic factors, lifestyle data, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Results: There was a 48% prevalence of dyspepsia symptoms among participants. The prevalence was higher among females, those less than 35 years of age, married participants, and those with a low body mass index (BMI). The correlation between dyspepsia and quality of life was significant. Dyspeptic patients were classified into ulcer-like (27.9%), dysmotility-like (26.2%), and unspecified (45.9%) groups. A significant correlation existed between dyspepsia symptoms and consumption of dairy products, drinking water and tea before and after meals, smoking, dysphagia, reflux, heartburn, and use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Conclusion: The high prevalence of dyspepsia in Qashqai nomads necessitates educational health programs for the migrating tribes in order to decrease prevalence of this disease. PMID:26101484\n\nA critical ethnography of doctor-patient interaction in southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSadati, Ahmad Kalateh; Iman, Mohammad Taghi; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri; Derakhshan, Soghra\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDoctor-patient interaction is a subject with ethical ramifications, besides being an important issue in medical sociology. The main goal of this critical study is to explore the interactional experience of hospital admitted patients. For this reason, the study, carried out in an educational hospital in southern Iran, entailed 156 recorded clinical consultations, 920 hours of participant observation, and six focus groups consisting of patients and their families. The research method used is Critical Ethnography, which was introduced by PF Carspecken. The results showed that negative interactional experience was common among the participants. Six related themes were: doctors' inattentiveness; weak interaction; violation of patients' privacy; unjustified pain; long waiting period and ambiguity; and faceless physicians. According to the participants' observations, poor interaction with doctors has led to these negative experiences. The findings showed that doctors were inconsiderate about patients' concerns and due to this, patients were dissatisfied. Theoretically, this form of fragmented collaboration has deep roots in the framework of modern medicine, but in the context of this study, the intensity of the fragmentation between doctors and patients was observed to be intolerable. To solve this problem, models of patient-centredness and narrative medicine are recommended. In addition, the health system should monitor and evaluate the observance of ethics by physicians.\n\nFirst microscopical and molecular-based characterization of Leishmania major within naturally infected Phlebotomus salehi (Diptera; Psychodidae) in Fars province, southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDAVAMI, M H; MOTAZEDIAN, M H; KALANTARI, M; ASGARI, Q; BADZOHRE, A; MOHAMMADPOUR, I\n\n2011-01-01\n\nZoonotoc cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in several parts of Iran. Jahrom district is one of the most important endemic foci of leishmaniasis located in Fars province, southern Iran. To identify the vectors of leishmaniasis in this area, a total of 349 sandflies were collected during May to August 2009. They were caught from outdoors in five regions of Jahrom district including villages of Mousavieh, Ghotb-Abad, Heydar-Abad, Fath-Abad and Jahrom County. Eleven species of Phlebotomine (three Phlebotomus spp. and eight Sergentomyia spp.) were detected. To determine the sandflies naturally infected by Leishmania spp., 122 female sandflies were dissected and evaluated microscopically using Giemsa-stained slides. Natural infection of 2 out of 38 (5.26%) P. papatasi and 1 out of 8 (12.5%) P. salehi to Leishmania major was confirmed in the region. Sequencing and nested polymerase chain reaction-based detection of Leishmania were carried out to confirm the microscopic findings. Five (13.16%) P. papatasi and two (25%) P. salehi were positive in nested polymerase chain reaction assay. All positive samples were shown 72â76% similarity with L. major Friedlin. On the basis of our knowledge, this is the first molecular detection of L. major within naturally infected P. salehi in this region in southern Iran.

The viral etiology and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of aseptic meningitis among children aged 2 months to 15 years in Shiraz, southern Iran were determined. From May 2007 to April 2008, 65 patients were admitted to the hospital with aseptic meningitis. Seven viruses, non-polio human enteroviruses, mumps virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Viruses were detected in 30 (46.2%) patients in whom non-polio human enterovirus and mumps virus were detected in 13 (43.3%) and 11 (36.7%), respectively. The remaining 6 (20%) of the cases were caused by HSV, VZV, HCMV, and HHV-6. Haemophilus influenzae and non-polio human enterovirus were detected in one patient simultaneously. Viral meningitis was found to be more frequent during spring and summer. The majority (66.6%) of the patients were treated in the hospital for 10 days and had received antibiotics in the case of bacterial meningitis. Rapid diagnosis of viral meningitis using PCR testing of CSF can help shorten hospitalization, and avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics.

This study aimed to monitor malaria from asymptomatic parasitaemia and clinical cases from about one year of active case surveillance and potential vectors of malaria in the newly emerged focus of Mamasani and Rostam, southern Iran during 2014â2015. Samples were collected and their DNAs were extracted for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay using specific primers for detection of Plasmodium species. The Annual Parasite Incidence rate (API) was three cases per 1,000 population from 2,000 individuals in three villages. Parasites species were detected in 9 out of the 4,000 blood smear samples among which, 6 cases were indigenous and had no history of travels to endemic areas of malaria. Also, the prevalence rate of asymptomatic parasites was about 0.3%. Overall, 1073 Anopheles spp. were caught from 9 villages. Totally, 512 female samples were checked by PCR, which indicated that none of them was infected with Plasmodium. Despite new malaria local transmission in humans in Mamasani and Rostam districts, no infection with Plasmodium was observed in Anopheles species. Because of neighboring of the studied area to the re-emerged focus in Fars province (Kazerun) and important endemic foci of malaria in other southern provinces, such as Hormozgan and Kerman, monitoring of the vectors and reservoir hosts of Plasmodium species would be unavoidable. Application of molecular methods, such as PCR, can simplify access to the highest level of accuracy in malaria researches.

Blood samples were taken from 617 asymptomatic healthy children and serum samples along with buffy coat were separated from the blood. The serum samples were assessed for antibodies against Leishmania infantum by an indirect ELISA and the buffy coats were tested for the presence of L. infantum DNA by molecular method. Of the 617 recruited children, 297 (48.1%) were female and 317 (51.4%) were male. Anti- Leishmania antibodies were detected in 17 (2.8%) of the children. From those 17 seropositive cases, 5 (29.4%) were male and 12 (70.6%) cases were female. Children aged 5-8 years had the highest seroprevalence rate; however, no associations were found between seropositivity to Leishmania and gender or age of the children. Moreover, L. infantum DNA was detected in buffy coat of 8 (1.3%) of 617 children. Three of the PCR-positive cases were seropositive whereas 14 of seropositive subjects (82.3%) were PCR-negative. Findings of the current study revealed a considerable subclinical leishmanial infection in children in the studied rural area in the south of Iran. Results of the current study could be used for surveillance, prevention, and control of VL in the area.\n\nA remote sensing study of active folding and faulting in southern Kerman province, S.E. Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalker, Richard Thomas\n\n2006-04-01\n\nGeomorphological observations reveal a major oblique fold-and-thrust belt in Kerman province, S.E. Iran. The active faults appear to link the Sabzevaran right-lateral strike-slip fault in southeast Iran to other strike-slip faults within the interior of the country and may provide the means of distributing right-lateral shear between the Zagros and Makran mountains over a wider region of central Iran. The Rafsanjan fault is manifest at the Earth's surface as right-lateral strike-slip fault scarps and folding in alluvial sediments. Height changes across the anticlines, and widespread incision of rivers, are likely to result from hanging-wall uplift above thrust faults at depth. Scarps in recent alluvium along the northern margins of the folds suggest that the thrusts reach the surface and are active at the present-day. The observations from Rafsanjan are used to identify similar late Quaternary faulting elsewhere in Kerman province near the towns of Mahan and Rayen. No instrumentally recorded destructive earthquakes have occurred in the study region and only one historical earthquake (Lalehzar, 1923) is recorded. In addition GPS studies show that present-day rates of deformation are low. However, fault structures in southern Kerman province do appear to be active in the late Quaternary and may be capable of producing destructive earthquakes in the future. This study shows how widely available remote sensing data can be used to provide information on the distribution of active faulting across large areas of deformation.\n\nPatulin contamination in apple products marketed in Shiraz, Southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoostforoushfard, Ali; Pishgar, Ahmad R; Berizi, Enayat; Nouraei, Hasti; Sobhani, Zahra; Mirzaie, Rohallah; Zomorodian, Kamiar\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPatulin is one of the important mycotoxins, produced by a wide range of molds, including Penicillium , Aspergillus, and Bysochlamys. Patulin is mainly found in the rotten parts of fruits and vegetables, such as apples, pears, peach, apricots, and grapes. Currently, the Codex Alimentarius and Food and Drug Administration have recommended a maximum level of 50 Âµg/L patulin for apple products. The purpose of this study was to investigate patulin contamination of apple juice and cans in 75 samples collected from 15 manufacturers in Shiraz, southern Iran. The detection of patulin was accomplished using a high-performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector. A total of 38 apple juice samples (53%) and 17 apple cans (45%) were contaminated with patulin. Overall 50% and 3% of the apple juice and apple cans samples had a patulin level of > 3 Âµg/L. Although the maximum level of patulin in our samples was considerably lower than the permitted level established by the European Union (i.e., 50 Âµg/L), the high incidence of this mycotoxin in our samples should be lessen by improving their good manufacturing practice.\n\nCompleteness and underestimation of cancer mortality rate in Iran: a report from Fars Province in southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarzban, Maryam; Haghdoost, Ali-Akbar; Dortaj, Eshagh; Bahrampour, Abbas; Zendehdel, Kazem\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe incidence and mortality rates of cancer are increasing worldwide, particularly in the developing countries. Valid data are needed for measuring the cancer burden and making appropriate decisions toward cancer control. We evaluated the completeness of death registry with regard to cancer death in Fars Province, I. R. of Iran. We used data from three sources in Fars Province, including the national death registry (source 1), the follow-up data from the pathology-based cancer registry (source 2) and hospital based records (source 3) during 2004 - 2006. We used the capture-recapture method and estimated underestimation and the true age standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for cancer. We used log-linear (LL) modeling for statistical analysis. We observed 1941, 480, and 355 cancer deaths in sources 1, 2 and 3, respectively. After data linkage, we estimated that mortality registry had about 40% underestimation for cancer death. After adjustment for this underestimation rate, the ASMR of cancer in the Fars Province for all cancer types increased from 44.8 per 100,000 (95% CI: 42.8 - 46.7) to 76.3 per 100,000 (95% CI: 73.3 - 78.9), accounting for 3309 (95% CI: 3151 - 3293) cancer deaths annually. The mortality rate of cancer is considerably higher than the rates reported by the routine registry in Iran. Improvement in the validity and completeness of the mortality registry is needed to estimate the true mortality rate caused by cancer in Iran.\n\nEconomic Burden of Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Different Stages of Disease: A Report From Southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZare, Fatemeh; Fattahi, Mohammad Reza; Sepehrimanesh, Masood; Safarpour, Ali Reza\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major blood-borne infection which imposes high economic cost on the patients. Objectives The current study aimed to evaluate the total annual cost due to chronic HCV related diseases imposed on each patient and their family in Southern Iran. Patients and Methods Economic burden of chronic hepatitis C-related liver diseases (chronic hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) were examined. The current retrospective study evaluated 200 Iranian patients for their socioeconomic status, utilization (direct and indirect costs) and treatment costs and work days lost due to illness by a structured questionnaire in 2015. Costs of hospital admissions were extracted from databases of Nemazee hospital, Shiraz, Iran. The outpatient expenditure per patient was measured through the rate of outpatient visits and average cost per visit reported by the patients; while the inpatient costs were calculated through annual rate of hospital admissions and average expenditure. Self-medication and direct non-medical costs were also reported. The human capital approach was used to measure the work loss cost. Results The total annual cost per patient for chronic hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on purchasing power parity (PPP) were USD 1625.50, USD 6117.2, and USD 11047.2 in 2015, respectively. Conclusions Chronic hepatitis C-related liver diseases impose a substantial economic burden on patients, families and the society. The current study provides useful information on cost of treatment and work loss for different disease states, which can be further used in cost-effectiveness evaluations.

The aim of the present study was to find out the prevalence of acanthocephalan infection in Babolsar district, southern coastal of Caspian Sea, Northern Iran. Materials and Methods: Between September 2012 and August 2014, a total of 360 G. aculeatus fishes were randomly collected by drift nets from coastal regions in Babolsar and then examined the intestine and body cavity for worm infections. Results: A total of 360 G. aculeatus fishes, 109 (30.3%) were found infected with at least one Corynosoma capsicum, and there was no significant association between genders and the prevalence infection of acanthocephalan. Moreover, there was a significant difference in infected rate between summer (79%, 86/109) and spring (21%, 23/109) (p<0.05). Conclusion: The high occurrence of Corynosoma infection in G. aculeatus indicates the enzootic constancy status of the infection in the southern coastal of Caspian Sea, Northern Iran.

The southern part of central Alborz Mountains, in the north of Iran, represents complex tectonics because it is located at the border of two developing continental sedimentary basins between southern central Alborz and Central Iran. An arid and semi-arid climate, a large extent of Quaternary sediments, rugged topography, salt domes and faults with historical seismicity influence the Habble-Rud River catchment. In the present research, a number of tectonic geomorphologic indices were extracted from satellite imagery and 10 m DEM (digital elevation model) data in order to identify relative tectonic activity within the basin. The indices include: stream length-gradient index (Sl), drainage basin asymmetry (Af), index of mountain front sinuosity (Smf), hypsometric integral (Hi), index of drainage basin shape (Bs), ratio of valley-floor width to valley height (Vf), and fault density (Fd). Due to the presence of heterogeneous indices for all sections of the catchment causing large extension of Habble-Rud (3260 km2), all of the variables such as extremely erodible formations, faults and folds and salt tectonics on the Southern part; were put into a matrix table. As a new approach, the variables were put into the SAW (simple additive model) model as one of MADM (multi-attribute decision-making models) techniques. The study area was divided into four regions according to the values of SAW. These classes include very high (%11), high (48.3%), moderate (34.7%), and low activity (3.4%). The result of the model suggests that the study area is located on a changing tectonic trend in central Alborz from NW-SE to NE-SW. The regions with high relative tectonic activity in HR catchment correspond to the active Garmsar and Sorkhe-Kalout faults and diapirs.\n\nSatisfaction and Dissatisfaction Toward Urban Family Physician Program: A Population Based Study in Shiraz, Southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHonarvar, Behnam; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri; Ghahramani, Sulmaz; Akbari, Maryam; Tabrizi, Reza; Bagheri, Zahra; Poostforoushfard, Sima\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: A national project of extending a family physician program to urban areas has been started since May 2013 in Iran. The present study aimed to detect correlates of people's satisfaction and dissatisfaction about urban family physician program. Methods: This cross-sectional and population-based study was conducted in Shiraz, Southern Iran. Multistage and proportional to size random sampling were used. Different items about satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward urban family physician program were queried. Single variable and then multiple variable analyses of data were done using SPSS software (Chicago, IL. USA). Results: Mean age of 1257 participants in the study was 38.1 Â± 13.2 years. Respondents included men (634; 50.4%), married (882; 70.2%), those who were educated at universities (529; 42%) and self-employed groups (405; 32.2%). One thousand fifty-eight (84.1%) were covered by the family physician program. Mean of referral times to a family physician was 2.2 Â± 2.9 during the year before the study. Satisfaction toward urban family physician program was high in 198 (15.8%), moderate in 394 (31.3%), and low in 391 (31.1%). Dissatisfaction about this program was more among younger than 51-year-old groups (for 31â50 years odds ratio [OR] =2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.4â3.7, P < 0.001 and for 18â30 years OR = 2, 95% CI = 1.2â3.4, P = 0.005), less knowledgeable ones (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.3â3.6, P = 0.001), singles (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2â3.4, P = 0.003), and those with more than 4 of family members (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1â1.7, P = 0.05). Conclusions: Overall, the majority of the people are not very satisfied with the urban family physician program. This shows the need for a multi-disciplinary approach including training, improvement of infrastructures and referral system, continuous supervision, and frequent monitoring of user's and provider's feedback about this program. According the results, the family physician program should be\n\nRisk factors of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Shiraz, southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaberi-Firoozi, Mehdi; Khademolhosseini, Farnaz; Yousefi, Maryam; Mehrabani, Davood; Zare, Najaf; Heydari, Seyed Taghi\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAIM: To determine the prevalence and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in a healthy general population in relation to demographic, lifestyle and health-seeking behaviors in Shiraz, southern Iran. METHODS: A total of 1978 subjects aged > 35 years who referred to Gastroenterohepatology Research Center and who completed a questionnaire consisting of 27 questions for GERD in relation to demographic, lifestyle and health-seeking behaviors were included in this study for a period of five months. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were determined. RESULTS: The prevalence of GERD was 15.4%, which was higher in females (17.3%), in rural areas (19.8%), and in illiterate subjects (21.5%) and those with a mean age of 50.25 years. The prevalence was significantly lower in subjects having fried food (14.8%), and fruit and vegetables (14.6%). More symptoms were noticed in subjects consuming pickles (22.1%), taking aspirin (21%) and in subjects with psychological distresses (27.2%) and headaches (22%). The correlation was statistically significant between GERD and halitosis (18.3%), dyspepsia (30.6%), anxiety (19.5%), nightmares (23.9%) and restlessness (18.5%). Their health seeking behavior showed that there was a significant restriction of diet (20%), consumption of herbal medicine (19%), using over-the-counter drugs (29.9%) and consulting with physicians (24.8%). Presence of GERD symptoms was also significantly related to a previous family history of the disease (22.3%). CONCLUSION: GERD is more common in females, rural and illiterate subjects and correlated with consumption of pickles, occurrence of headache, psychological distress, dyspepsia, halitosis, anxiety, nightmare and restlessness, and a family history of GERD and aspirin intake, but the correlation was negative with consumption of fat and fiber intake.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening methods is highly necessary due to increased prevalence, decreased age at onset and the limited budget in Iran. Methods of screening currently available in Iran were selected. A systematic search revealed the sensitivity and specificity of each method. For this study, a model for a 20 year screening period of a population of 100,000 apparently healthy persons of ages 45-65 years in Isfahan Province was used. The cost-effectiveness of each method and the ratio of cost-effectiveness were calculated based on this model. The most and the least effective methods were CT colonography and fecal occult blood test, respectively. The highest and lowest expenditures in the governmental sector were related to fecal occult blood test and flexible sigmoidoscopy and in the private sector, to CT colonography and fecal occult blood test, respectively. The cost per cancer detected in 20 years of screening in the governmental sector was 0.28, 0.22 and 0.42 billion Rials, respectively for screening by colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood test. In the private sector, these were 1.54 (colonoscopy), 1.68 (flexible sigmoidoscopy), and 1.60 (fecal occult blood test) billion and 2.58 billion Rials for CT colonography, respectively. Although CT colonography is the most effective method, it needs a budget of 2.58 billion Rials for each screened patient. If costs in the governmental sector are considered, flexible sigmoidoscopy would be the most cost-effective method for screening the 45 - 65-year-old population in Iran.\n\nRemote sensing of land use/cover changes and its effect on wind erosion potential in southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSameni, Abdolmajid; Fallah Shamsi, Seyed Rashid; Bartholomeus, Harm\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWind erosion is a complex process influenced by different factors. Most of these factors are stable over time, but land use/cover and land management practices are changing gradually. Therefore, this research investigates the impact of changing land use/cover and land management on wind erosion potential in southern Iran. We used remote sensing data (Landsat ETM+ and Landsat 8 imagery of 2004 and 2013) for land use/cover mapping and employed the Iran Research Institute of Forest and Rangeland (IRIFR) method to estimate changes in wind erosion potential. For an optimal mapping, the performance of different classification algorithms and input layers was tested. The amount of changes in wind erosion and land use/cover were quantified using cross-tabulation between the two years. To discriminate land use/cover related to wind erosion, the best results were obtained by combining the original spectral bands with synthetic bands and using Maximum Likelihood classification algorithm (Kappa Coefficient of 0.8 and 0.9 for Landsat ETM+ and Landsat 8, respectively). The IRIFR modelling results indicate that the wind erosion potential has increased over the last decade. The areas with a very high sediment yield potential have increased, whereas the areas with a low, medium, and high sediment yield potential decreased. The area with a very low sediment yield potential have remained constant. When comparing the change in erosion potential with land use/cover change, it is evident that soil erosion potential has increased mostly in accordance with the increase of the area of agricultural practices. The conversion of rangeland to agricultural land was a major land-use change which lead to more agricultural practices and associated soil loss. Moreover, results indicate an increase in sandification in the study area which is also a clear evidence of increasing in soil erosion.

Historical evidence suggests the close similarity in the origin of Iranian, European and north Indian population. However, there are few anthropological and genetic evidences on this subject. This study, which is the first report from Iran, was performed to investigate the genetic origin of Iranian population using a polymorphism in Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene known as 844INS68bp in this respect, genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood of 480 healthy normal blood donors referred to Fars Blood Transfusion Center, using a salting out method. The fragment containing 844INS68bp was amplified, the normal fragment was 174 bp and the fragment containing the insertion was 242 bp in length. Results indicated that 418 (87.08%) out of 480 individuals had a normal (N/N) genotype, 59 (12.29%) individuals were heterozygote (N/I) and 3 (0.63%) had homozygote a mutated genotype (I/I). The total frequency of 844INS68bp allele was found 6.8% which is similar to with the reported in White Caucasians. Comparison of the genotype of this study with the polymorphism in other populations revealed that Southern Iranian population has a great similarity with other Caucasians populations' especially South Italy and North America while differed from East Asian and African populations. These results are in agreement with the result of other studied polymorphisms. Therefore, despite the great admixture of Iranian population with the neighboring non-Caucasian populations during the time, Iranian population still share a genetic background with other Caucasian populations.\n\nPrevalence and risk factors of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Qashqai migrating nomads, southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMostaghni, Ahmad; Mehrabani, Davood; Khademolhosseini, Farnaz; Masoumi, Seyed Jalil; Moradi, Fariba; Zare, Najaf; Saberi-Firoozi, Mehdi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAIM: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in Qashqai migrating nomads with a different life style in Fars province, southern Iran. METHODS: In summer 2006, 748 Qashqai migrating nomads aged 25 years or more were enrolled using a multiple-stage stratified cluster random sampling method. A questionnaire consisting of demographic characteristics, lifestyle and GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, dysphagia, hoarseness and cough) as completed for each subject. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed in 717 subjects. The prevalence rate of GERD, defined as reflux occurring at least one time per week in the preceding year, was 33% (237 subjects). The prevalence was higher in older individuals (36.0% vs 28.9%, P < 0.05) and in those with other gastrointestinal complaints (51.0% vs 27.8%, P < 0.001), but not different in obese and non-obese subjects. It was also higher in those consuming fruits and vegetables more than once a week (36.2% vs 17.3%, P < 0.001). GERD had a positive correlation with smoking (42.1% vs 27.8%, P < 0.001), but a negative relation with non-alcoholic beverages. The association between GERD and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumption was also significant (40.2% vs 25.4%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of GERD (33%) is very high in Qashqai migrating nomads which may be due to a lower socioeconomic and educational level of these people and difference in the life style. Older age, frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables, smoking and NSAIDs are risk factors for GERD in this population.

Therefore, we investigated the epidemiological relationship between clinical isolates of A. baumannii obtained from patients in a university hospital in Bandar Abbas in southern Iran. Sixty-four consecutive non-duplicate clinical isolates collected during 2014-2015 were subjected to susceptibility testing, clonal relationship analysis using PFGE, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and examined for the presence of carbapenemases and integrons. Almost all A. baumannii isolates were extensively drug-resistant (XDR; 98â%) and carried an OXA carbapenemase gene (blaOXA-23-like; 98â%) and class 1 integrons (48â%). PFGE and MLST analysis identified three major genotypes, all belonging to clonal complex 92 (CC92): sequence type 848 (ST848) (n=23), ST451 (n=16) and ST195 (n=8). CC92 has previously been documented in the hospital setting in northern Iran, and ST195 has been reported in Arab States of the Persian Gulf. These data suggest national and global transmission of A. baumannii CC92. This report demonstrates the occurrence and potential spread of closely related XDR genotypes of A. baumannii CC92 within a university hospital in southern Iran. These genotypes were found in the majority of the investigated isolates, showed high prevalence of blaOXA-23 and integron class 1, and were associated with stay in the intensive care unit. Very few treatment options remain for healthcare-adapted XDR A. baumannii, and hence effective measures are desperately needed to reduce the spread of these strains and resultant infections in the healthcare setting.\n\nNational survey of availability of physical rehabilitation services in Iran: A mixed methods study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShirazikhah, Marzieh; Mirabzadeh, Arash; Sajadi, Homeira; Joghataei, Mohammad Taghi; Biglarian, Akbar; Mousavi, Tahmineh; Shahboulaghi, Farahnaz Mohammadi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground The prevalence of disability in Iran has increased due to ageing of the population and the presence of chronic diseases. However, little is known about the availability of rehabilitation services in Iran. Objective To study the availability of physical rehabilitation services in Iran. Methods This was a mixed method study. In the first phase, a qualitative design was conducted for designing an instrument with focus groups based on Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) instrument (developed by World Health Organization). Content analysis was used for data analysis. Then, in the second phase, a cross-sectional study was performed to collect the data with census method in Iran. This study was formed from June to October 2015, and samples consisted of all governmental, public non-governmental and private facilities established for rehabilitation centers affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Ministry of Labor, Cooperative and Social Welfare and the Iranian Red Crescent Society. Data analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 16). Descriptive statistical analysis (percentage and frequency) were calculated for quantitative data. Results In the first phase, the content analysis of qualitative data identified a Master Facilities List (MFL) of rehabilitation services and service providers in Iran. Results of the second phase showed that the rate of inpatient, outpatient, community-based and long-term care centers per 1,000,000 populations in Iran were 1.68, 89.24, 66.21 and 3.6, respectively. Also, that the rate of rehabilitation professionals including physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and audiologists were 3.90, 64.65, 22.09, 22.83 and 24.18 per 1,000,000 populations, respectively. Conclusion There is a need to increase the availability of rehabilitation services and to promote rehabilitation referrals by using an interdisciplinary team\n\nPopulation size estimation of female sex workers in Iran: Synthesis of methods and results.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharifi, Hamid; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Baneshi, Mohammad Reza; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Haghdoost, AliAkbar; McFarland, Willi; Mirzazadeh, Ali\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEstimating the number of key populations at risk of HIV is essential for planning, monitoring, and evaluating prevention, care, and treatment programmes. We conducted this study to estimate the number of female sex workers (FSW) in major cities of Iran. We used three population size estimation methods (i.e., wisdom of the crowds, multiplier method, and network scale-up) to calculate the number of FSW in 13 cities in Iran. The wisdom of the crowds and multiplier methods were integrated into a nationwide bio-behavioural surveillance survey in 2015, and the network scale-up method was included in a national survey of the general population in 2014. The median of the three methods was used to calculate the proportion of the adult female population who practice sex work in the 13 cities. These figures were then extrapolated to provide a national population size estimation of FSW across urban areas. The population size of FSW was 91,500 (95% Uncertainty Intervals [UIs] 61,400-117,700), corresponding to 1.43% (95% UIs 0.96-1.84) of the adult (i.e., 15-49 year-old) female population living in these 13 cities. The projected numbers of FSW for all 31 provincial capital cities were 130,800 (95% UIs 87,800-168,200) and 228,700 (95% UIs 153,500-294,300) for all urban settings in Iran. Using methods of comparable rigor, our study provided a data-driven national estimate of the population size of FSW in urban areas of Iran. Our findings provide vital information for enhancing HIV programme planning and lay a foundation for assessing the impact of harm reduction efforts within this marginalized population.\n\nPrevalence of cystic echinococcosis in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhalkhali, H R; Foroutan, M; Khademvatan, S; Majidiani, H; Aryamand, S; Khezri, P; Aminpour, A\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAs a significant zoonosis, cystic echinococcosis (CE) is endemic in some parts of the world, such as the Middle East. There are studies on the prevalence of this infection in animal and human reservoirs in Iran; hence, we conducted this meta-analysis to elucidate the prevalence of CE in Iran. English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar) and Persian (Magiran, Iran Medex, Iran Doc and SID) databases were explored. In the case of definitive, animal and human intermediate hosts, 37, 90 and 33 studies, respectively, have been included in the current review from January 1990 to December 2015. According to outcomes of the heterogeneity test, either Der Simonian and Laird's random-effects method or Mantel-Haenszel's fixed-effects method were employed to pool the estimations. The pooled prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus infection in definitive hosts was calculated as 23.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 17.6-30.1%). The weighted prevalence of animal and human hydatidosis was calculated as 15.6% (95% CI = 14.2-17.1%) and 4.2% (95% CI = 3.0-5.5%), respectively. Meanwhile, most cases of human hydatidosis were in southern Iran, with a prevalence of 5.8% (3.2-9.2%). In terms of human hydatidosis, more infections were found in rural regions, and mostly in female individuals. Egger's regression test revealed publication bias, with a remarkable impact on total prevalence of the infection in animal intermediate hosts (P < 0.001), while it was not significant in human hosts (P = 0.4) and definitive hosts (P = 0.3). According to the weighted estimated prevalence of cystic echinococcosis and its financial burden, implementing appropriate control programmes should be compulsory to decrease the burden of the disease in Iran.\n\nPrevalence and risk factors of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Qashqai migrating nomads, southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMostaghni, Ahmad; Mehrabani, Davood; Khademolhosseini, Farnaz; Masoumi, Seyed Jalil; Moradi, Fariba; Zare, Najaf; Saberi-Firoozi, Mehdi\n\n2009-02-28\n\nTo investigate the prevalence and risk factors of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in Qashqai migrating nomads with a different life style in Fars province, southern Iran. In summer 2006, 748 Qashqai migrating nomads aged 25 years or more were enrolled using a multiple-stage stratified cluster random sampling method. A questionnaire consisting of demographic characteristics, lifestyle and GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, dysphagia, hoarseness and cough) as completed for each subject. The questionnaire was completed in 717 subjects. The prevalence rate of GERD, defined as reflux occurring at least one time per week in the preceding year, was 33% (237 subjects). The prevalence was higher in older individuals (36.0% vs 28.9%, P < 0.05) and in those with other gastrointestinal complaints (51.0% vs 27.8%, P < 0.001), but not different in obese and non-obese subjects. It was also higher in those consuming fruits and vegetables more than once a week (36.2% vs 17.3%, P < 0.001). GERD had a positive correlation with smoking (42.1% vs 27.8%, P < 0.001), but a negative relation with non-alcoholic beverages. The association between GERD and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumption was also significant (40.2% vs 25.4%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of GERD (33%) is very high in Qashqai migrating nomads which may be due to a lower socioeconomic and educational level of these people and difference in the life style. Older age, frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables, smoking and NSAIDs are risk factors for GERD in this population.\n\nGenetic Epidemiology, Hematological and Clinical Features of Hemoglobinopathies in Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRahimi, Zohreh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is large variation in the molecular genetics and clinical features of hemoglobinopathies in Iran. Studying structural variants of hemoglobin demonstrated that the Î²-chain variants of hemoglobin S and D-Punjab are more prevalent in the Fars (southwestern Iran) and Kermanshah (western Iran) provinces, respectively. Also, Î±-chain variants of Hb Q-Iran and Hb Setif are prevalent in western Iran. The molecular basis and clinical severity of thalassemias are extremely heterogenous among Iranians due to the presence of multiethnic groups in the country. Î²-Thalassemia is more prevalent in northern and southern Iran. Among 52 different Î²-thalassemia mutations that have been identified among Iranian populations, IVSII-1 G:A is the most frequent mutation in most parts of the country. The presence of IVS I-5 G:C mutation with high frequency in southeastern Iran might reflect gene flow from neighboring countries. A wide spectrum of Î±-thalassemia alleles has been detected among Iranians with âÎ± 3.7âkb as the most prevalent Î±-thalassemia mutation. The prevention program of thalassemia birth in Iran has reduced the birth rate of homozygous Î²-thalassemia since the implementation of the program in 1997. In this review genetic epidemiology, clinical and hematological aspects of hemoglobinopathies, and the prevention programs of Î²-thalassemia in Iran will be discussed.

The current study aimed to evaluate the total annual cost due to chronic HCV related diseases imposed on each patient and their family in Southern Iran. Economic burden of chronic hepatitis C-related liver diseases (chronic hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) were examined. The current retrospective study evaluated 200 Iranian patients for their socioeconomic status, utilization (direct and indirect costs) and treatment costs and work days lost due to illness by a structured questionnaire in 2015. Costs of hospital admissions were extracted from databases of Nemazee hospital, Shiraz, Iran. The outpatient expenditure per patient was measured through the rate of outpatient visits and average cost per visit reported by the patients; while the inpatient costs were calculated through annual rate of hospital admissions and average expenditure. Self-medication and direct non-medical costs were also reported. The human capital approach was used to measure the work loss cost. The total annual cost per patient for chronic hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on purchasing power parity (PPP) were USD 1625.50, USD 6117.2, and USD 11047.2 in 2015, respectively. Chronic hepatitis C-related liver diseases impose a substantial economic burden on patients, families and the society. The current study provides useful information on cost of treatment and work loss for different disease states, which can be further used in cost-effectiveness evaluations.\n\nPopulation size estimation of female sex workers in Iran: Synthesis of methods and results\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSharifi, Hamid; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Baneshi, Mohammad Reza; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Haghdoost, AliAkbar; McFarland, Willi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction Estimating the number of key populations at risk of HIV is essential for planning, monitoring, and evaluating prevention, care, and treatment programmes.

The rabies is the deadliest disease and if the symptoms break out in a person, one will certainly die. However, the deaths resulting from rabies can be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis. To do so, in Iran and most of the countries in the world, all the people who are exposed to animal bite receive Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) treatment. The present survey aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of PEP in southern Iran. The present study estimated the PEP costs from the government`s Perspective with step-down method for the people exposed to animal bite, estimated the number of DALYs prevented by PEP in the individuals using decision Tree model, and computed the Incremental cost-effectiveness Ratio. The information collected of all reported animal bite cases (n=7111) in Fars Province, who referred rabies registries in urban and rural health centers to receive active care. Performing the PEP program cost estimated 1,052,756.1 USD for oneÂ year and the estimated cost for the treatment of each animal bite case and each prevented death was 148.04 and 5945.42 USD, respectively. Likewise 4,509.82 DALYs were prevented in southern Iran in 2011 by PEP program. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each DALY was estimated to be 233.43 USD. In addition to its full effectiveness in prophylaxis from rabies, PEP program saves the financial resources of the society, as well. This study showed performing PEP to be more cost-effective.\n\nGeological sources of fluoride and acceptable intake of fluoride in an endemic fluorosis area, southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nBattaleb-Looie, Sedigheh; Moore, Farid; Jacks, Gunnar; Ketabdari, Mohammad Reza\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe present study is the first attempt to put forward possible source(s) of fluoride in the Dashtestan area, Bushehr Province, southern Iran. In response to reports on the high incidence of dental fluorosis, 35 surface and groundwater samples were collected and analysed for fluoride. The results indicate that dissolved fluoride in the study area is above the maximum permissible limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). An additional 35 soil and rock samples were also collected and analysed for fluoride, and rock samples were subjected to petrographic investigations and X-ray diffraction. The results of these analyses show that the most likely source for fluoride in the groundwater is from clay minerals (chlorite) and micas (muscovite, sericite, and biotite) in the soils and rocks in the area. We also note that due to the high average temperatures all year round and excessive water consumption in the area, the optimum fluoride dose level should be lower than that recommended by the WHO.\n\nMedical Errors and Barriers to Reporting in Ten Hospitals in Southern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhammarnia, Mohammad; Ravangard, Ramin; Barfar, Eshagh; Setoodehzadeh, Fatemeh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: International research shows that medical errors (MEs) are a major threat to patient safety. The present study aimed to describe MEs and barriers to reporting them in Shiraz public hospitals, Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study was conducted in 10 Shiraz public hospitals in the south of Iran, 2013. Using the standardised checklist of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (referred to the Clinical Governance Department and recorded documentations) and Uribe questionnaire, we gathered the data in the hospitals. Results: A total of 4379 MEs were recorded in 10 hospitals. The highest frequency (27.1%) was related to systematic errors. Besides, most of the errors had occurred in the largest hospital (54.9%), internal wards (36.3%), and morning shifts (55.0%). The results revealed a significant association between the MEs and wards and hospitals (p < 0.001). Moreover, individual and organisational factors were the barriers to reporting ME in the studied hospitals. Also, a significant correlation was observed between the ME reporting barriers and the participantsâ job experiences (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The medical errors were highly frequent in the studied hospitals especially in the larger hospitals, morning shift and in the nursing practice. Moreover, individual and organisational factors were considered as the barriers to reporting MEs.

We aimed to review the epidemiology and pattern of adult poisoning in Iran in order to facilitate the early diagnosis and management of poisoning. The pattern of poisoning is different in various parts of Iran. Pharmaceutical compounds were the most common cause of poisoning in most parts of Iran. Pesticide-related toxicities were more common in northern agricultural regions, whereas bites and stings were seen more commonly in southern Iran. Carbon monoxide poisoning was common in cities with many motor vehicles such as Tehran and in colder climates such as in northern and western regions due to inadequately vented gas appliances such as stoves and heaters. Majoon Birjandi (containing cannabis) is a unique substance used in eastern Iran. Poisoning by opioids, tramadol, and pesticides (organophosphate and aluminum phosphide) has remained a common hazard in Iran. Poisoning-associated morbidity and mortality rates vary by region and have changed over time due to the introduction of new drugs and chemicals. Early diagnosis and proper treatment may be lifesaving; thus, understanding the general pattern of poisoning in different regions is important.

The aim of the present study was to find out the prevalence of acanthocephalan infection in Babolsar district, southern coastal of Caspian Sea, Northern Iran. Between September 2012 and August 2014, a total of 360 G. aculeatus fishes were randomly collected by drift nets from coastal regions in Babolsar and then examined the intestine and body cavity for worm infections. A total of 360 G. aculeatus fishes, 109 (30.3%) were found infected with at least one Corynosoma capsicum , and there was no significant association between genders and the prevalence infection of acanthocephalan. Moreover, there was a significant difference in infected rate between summer (79%, 86/109) and spring (21%, 23/109) (p<0.05). The high occurrence of Corynosoma infection in G. aculeatus indicates the enzootic constancy status of the infection in the southern coastal of Caspian Sea, Northern Iran.\n\nToxocara nematodes in stray cats from shiraz, southern iran: intensity of infection and molecular identification of the isolates.\n\nPubMed\n\nMikaeili, Fattaneh; Mirhendi, Hossein; Hosseini, Mostafa; Asgari, Qasem; Kia, Eshrat Beigom\n\n2013-10-01\n\nToxocara is a common nematode of cats in different parts of Iran. Despite the close association of cats with human, no attempt has been done so far for molecular identification of this nematode in the country. Therefore, current study was performed on identification of some isolates of Toxocara from stray cats in Shiraz, Fars Province, Southern Iran, based on morphological and molecular approaches, and also determination of intensity of infection. This cross-sectional study was carried out on 30 stray cats trapped from different geographical areas of Shiraz in 2011. Adult male and female worms were recovered from digestive tract after dissection of cats. Morphological features using existing keys and PCR-sequencing of ITS-rDNA region and pcox1 mitochondrial l gene were applied for the delineating the species of the parasites. Eight out of 30 cats (26.7%) were found infected with Toxocara nematodes. All the isolates were confirmed as Toxocara cati based on morphological features and the sequence of ribosomal and mitochondrial targets. Intensity of infection ranged from one to a maximum of 39 worms per cat, with a mean of 10.25Â±12.36, and higher abundance of female nematodes. The most prevalent ascaridoid nematode of stray cats in the study area was T. cati and female nematodes were more abundant than that of males. This issue has important role in spreading of eggs in the environment and impact on human toxocariasis.\n\nSeroprevalence of human herpes simplex, hepatitis B and epstein-barr viruses in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in southern iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahjour, Seyed Babak; Ghaffarpasand, Fariborz; Fattahi, Mohammad Javad; Ghaderi, Abbas; Fotouhi Ghiam, Alireza; Karimi, Mehran\n\n2010-12-01\n\nTo investigate the seroprevalence of Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV1 and HSV2), Ebstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in southern Iran. 90 patients with ALL and 90 age-sex matched healthy participants were enrolled in this study. Antibodies (IgG) against HBsAg, HSV1, HSV2, EBV different antigens including Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen (EA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There were 54 (60%) male and 36 (40%) female in both study groups with mean age of 8.47 Â± 3.61 and 8.61 Â± 2.84 years in case and control group respectively (P = 0.812). The prevalence of antibodies against HBsAg (P = 0.002), HSV1 (P < 0.0001), VCA (P = 0.021) and EA (P < 0.0001) antigens of EBV were significantly higher in ALL patients. With the results of this study, we could not exclude a connection between these viral infections and later leukemogenesis in childhood ALL, although nor latent infection nor congenital infection cannot be excluded by this method.\n\nSequence diversity of the C-terminal region of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 in southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nZamani, Zahra; Razavi, Mohammad Reza; Sadeghi, Sedigheh; Naddaf, Saeed; Pourfallah, Fatemeh; Mirkhani, Fatemeh; Arjmand, Mohammad; Feizhaddad, Hossein; Rad, Mina Ebrahimi; Ebrahimi Rad, Mina; Tameemi, Marzieh; Assmar, Mehdi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe C-terminal region of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium falciparum is a strong vaccine candidate as it is associated with immunity to the parasite. This corresponds approximately to the conserved 17th block of the gene and is composed of two EGF- like domains. These domains exhibit only four single amino acid substitutions which show several potential variants in this region of the gene. As the variations might be important for a regional vaccine design, a study was carried out to determine the variations present in P. falciparum isolates from southern Iran. Besides the usual E-T-S-R-L and the Q-K-N-G-F types, we found Q-T-S-R-L, E-K-N-G-F, E-T-S-G-L, Z-T-S-G-L and Z-T-S-R-L types, where Z was E or Q signifying the presence of mixed clones in single isolates.\n\nDemand for long-acting and permanent contraceptive methods among Kurdish women in Mahabad, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nHosseini, Hatam; Torabi, Fatemeh; Bagi, Balal\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIt is anticipated that the demand for contraceptives in Iran will increase in the near future as the number of women of reproductive age increases and with women wanting smaller families. The aim of this paper was to study the demand for long-acting and permanent contraceptive methods (LAPCMs), and its determinants, among Kurdish women in Mahabad city, Iran. Data were taken from the Mahabad Fertility Survey (MFS) conducted on a sample of over 700 households in April 2012. The results show that the demand for LAPCMs was 71.35% at the time of survey, although only 27.7% of women were using these methods. Thus, the number of unintended pregnancies is likely to increase in the future if this gap is not reduced. The multivariate analysis showed significant impacts on the dependent variables of the number of children ever born, perceived contraceptive costs and childbearing intentions. Moreover, women at the end of their reproductive lives and those with higher education were more likely to desire LAPCMs. It is concluded that despite a growing use of contraceptive methods in Iran in recent decades, the development of reproductive health services and promotion of the quality of family planning services remains a necessity.\n\nAnalysis of heavy metals concentration in water and sediment in the Hara biosphere reserve, southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nNowrouzi, Mohsen; Mansouri, Borhan; Nabizadeh, Sahar; Pourkhabbaz, Alireza\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThis study determined the concentration of heavy metals (Al, Cr, Cu, and Zn) in water and sediments at nine sites in the Hara biosphere reserve of southern Iran during the summer and winter 2010. Determination of Al, Cr, Cu, and Zn in water was carried out by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (Shimadzu, AA 610s) and in sediment by flame atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, AA3030). Results showed that the heavy metal concentrations in the water samples decreased in the sequence of ZnÂ >Â AlÂ >Â CuÂ >Â Cr, while in sediment samples were CrÂ >Â ZnÂ >Â CuÂ >Â Al. Data analysis indicated that with the exception of Al, there was a Pearson's correlation coefficient between pH and Cu, Zn, and Cr at Î±Â =Â 0.01, 0.05, and 0.001 in sediment (in winter), respectively. There were also significant differences between heavy metals of Cr, Cu, and Zn during the two seasons (pÂ <Â 0.001) in the water and sediment.\n\nHeavy metals and arsenic content in water along the southern Caspian coasts in Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbadi, Mohammad; Zamani, Abbasali; Parizanganeh, Abdolhossein; Khosravi, Younes; Badiee, Hamid\n\n2018-06-06\n\nDue to the importance of pollution monitoring in marine ecosystems and lack of a coherent and systematic investigation of heavy metal ions along the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, in the present study, the amount of these metals and As ions in coastal waters along its 780-km-long coast in Iran have been studied. Heavy metals (cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury, lead) and a poisonous metalloid (arsenic) were selected in 59 sampling stations and determined using differential pulse polarography method. The multivariate statistical tools were applied to describe and interpret the experimental data. The overall mean concentrations of studied metals (in microgram per liter; Î¼gÂ L -1 ) in the samples were found in the order Zn (10.9) > Ni (7.4) > Cu (5.5) > Pb (1.9) > Hg (1.4) > As (1.3) > Co (1.1) > Cd (0.2). The results when compared with reported international standards confirmed that the sampled waters do contain some of these elements above the suggested maximum permissible limits. Hg and Cu were detected in 54.2 and 72.9% of the samples, almost all above the permissible limits. Ni, Zn, Pb, and Co were detected in 100, 96.6, 93.2, and 88.1%, respectively, while 8.5, 22.0, 3.4, and 1.7% were above the permissible limits. Cd and As were present in 61 and 93% of the samples, and their concentrations were higher than the rate presented by Russian System of Management Chemicals (RSMC). In addition, spatial distribution of heavy metal concentrations showed that Gorgan Bay is an ecosystem serving as a filter, trapping natural and anthropogenic materials that are brought from industrial, commercial, and urbanized areas. The multivariate data analysis reveals that Caspian Sea is contaminated by both anthropogenic as well as pedo-geochemical sources.\n\nCaspian Rapid Assessment Method: a localized procedure for assessment of wetlands at southern fringe of the Caspian Sea.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhorami Pour, Sanaz; Monavari, Seyed Masoud; Riazi, Borhan; Khorasani, Nematollah\n\n2015-07-01\n\nAlthough Iran is of founders of the Ramsar Convention, there is no comprehensive information available in the country on the status of wetlands in the past or at present. There is also no specific guideline for assessing the status of wetlands in the basin of the Caspian Sea as an ecosystem with unique ecological features. The main aim of this study was to develop a new procedure called \"Caspian Rapid Assessment Method\" (CRAM) for assessment of wetlands at southern fringe of the Caspian Sea. To this end, 16 rapid assessment methods analyzed by US EPA in 2003 were reviewed to provide an inventory of rapid assessment indices. Excluding less important indices, the inventory was short-listed based on Delphi panelists' consensus. The CRAM was developed with 6 main criteria and 12 sub-criteria. The modified method was used to assess three important wetlands of Anzali, Boojagh and Miyankaleh at the southern border of the Caspian Sea. According to the obtained results, the highest score of 60 was assigned to the Anzali Wetland. Obtaining the scores of 56 and 47, Miyankaleh and Boojagh wetlands were ranked in the next priorities, respectively. At final stage, the accuracy of CRAM prioritization values was confirmed using the Friedman test. All of the wetlands were classified into category II, which indicates destroyed wetlands with rehabilitation potentials. In recent years, serious threats have deteriorated the wetlands from class III (normal condition) to the class II.\n\nTraumatic myiasis agents in Iran with introducing of new dominant species, Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRafinejad, Javad; Akbarzadeh, Kamran; Rassi, Yavar; Nozari, Jamasp; Sedaghat, Mohammad Mehdi; Hosseini, Mostafa; Alipour, Hamzeh; Ranjbar, Abdolmajid; Zeinali, Danial\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective To study agents of animal wound myiasis in various geographical districts of Fars province. Methods This study has been done in Fars province, located in the southern part of Iran. Sums of 10â 358 domestic animals have been visited from April 2011 to March 2012. The infected wounds in any parts of animal body were sampled by means of forceps. Results About 61% of all animal wound myiasis were caused by larvae of Wohlfahrtia magnifica. The most wound myiasis cases due to this species occurred in central part of Fars province. There wasn't any significant difference between sheep and goat in infestation with myiasis (P>0.05). The infestation rate of myiasis in cattle community was 0.86%. Conclusions The infestation rate of livestock was lower than other works in Iran and some other countries like Saudi Arabia. Chrysomya bezziana has been mentioned as main myiasis agent in Iran. But in this study it cleared that similarly to some European countries, the common animal myiasis agent in Iran is Wohlfahrtia magnifica. Introducing new species as principal agent for myiasis can help public health and animal husbandry policy makers to prepare sufficient and effective control and/or preventive measures for this disease.

Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSinai, J.\n\n1993-05-28\n\nThis study examines the factors affecting Iran`s future by focusing on the demographic, economic, and military trends in Iran and their impact on the country`s national security objectives in the next decade. The paper also assesses the implications of an economic embargo on Iran and potential Iranian threats to regional and United States national interests.\n\nRole of Intracranial Pressure Monitoring in Management of Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Results of a Large Level I Trauma Center in Southern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhalili, Hosseinali; Sadraei, Nazanin; Niakan, Amin; Ghaffarpasand, Fariborz; Sadraei, Amin\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTo determine the role of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to a large level I trauma center in Southern Iran. This was a cohort study performed during a 2-year period in a level I trauma center in Southern Iran including all adult patients (>16 years) with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, 3-8) who underwent ICP monitoring through ventriculostomy. The management was based on the recorded ICP values with threshold of 20 mm Hg. Decompressive craniectomy was performed in patients with intractable intracranial hypertension (persistent ICP â¥25 mm Hg). In unresponsive patients, barbiturate coma was induced. Patients were followed for 6 months and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended was recorded. The determinants of favorable and unfavorable outcome were also determined. Overall, we included 248 patients with mean age of 34.6 Â± 16.6 years, among whom there were 216 men (87.1%) and 32 women (12.9%). Eighty-five patients (34.2%) had favorable and 163 (65.8%) unfavorable outcomes. Those with favorable outcome had significantly lower age (PÂ = 0.004), higher GCS score on admission (P < 0.001), lower Rotterdam score (PÂ = 0.035), fewer episodes of intracranial hypertension (P < 0.001), and lower maximum recorded ICP (PÂ = 0.041). These factors remained statistically significant after elimination of confounders by multivariate logistic regression model. Age, GCS score on admission, Rotterdam score, intracranial hypertension, and maximum recorded ICPÂ are important determinants of outcome in patients with severe TBI. ICP monitoring assisted us in targeted therapy and management of patients with severe TBI. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It was divided by Tirrul et al. (1983) in five main units: the Lut (1) and Afghan (2) continental blocks where basement is exposed; the Neh (3) and Ratuk (4) complexes which display ophiolitic rocks weakly and highly (HP-BT) metamorphosed, respectively, and the Sefidabeh basin lying over these complexes and interpreted as a fore-arc basin. Sistan is bordered by the Makran and Zagros (formed by the closure of the Neo-Tethys) to the south and by the Kopet Dagh (formed by the closure of Paleo-Tethys) to the North. The aim of this study is to fill the gap between preliminary studies about the overall structure of the Sistan Suture Zone and recent investigations of active tectonics in the region (e.g., Walker et al., 2004 and 2006 a and b). Questions herein addressed are: (1) how are stresses transfered throughout Iran from the Zagros to the Sistan belts? (2) Did the Zagros, Makran and Sistan belts evolve independently through time, or were they mechanically coupled? In order to answer these questions, we have determined paleostress evolution in the Sistan, using a direct inversion method for 42 microtectonic sites in almost all lithologies of the Neh complex and the Sefidabeh basin. We find three successive directions of compression: (1) 87Â°N for the oldest deformation stage dated of the Late Miocene, (2) 59Â°N for the intermediate stage probably dated of the Early Pliocene, and (3) 26Â°N for the youngest stage dated of the Plio-Quaternary. A counterclockwise rotation of about 60Â° of the main stress (Ï1) in less than 10 Ma is therefore documented in Sistan. These same three stages of deformation were also documented by several microtectonic studies in Iran, especially in Makran and Zagros. The direction of the youngest compression is very homogeneous indicating that the mountain belts and continental blocks of Iran\n\nThe Status of Human and Animal Fascioliasis in Iran: A Narrative Review Article\n\nPubMed Central\n\nASHRAFI, Keyhan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: The public health importance of human fascioliasis has increased during last few decades due to the appearance of new emerging and re-emerging foci in many countries. Iran, as the most important focus of human disease in Asia, has been included among six countries known to have a serious problem with fascioliasis by WHO. Various aspects of the disease in Iran are discussed in this review. Methods: This narrative review covers all information about human and animal fascioliasis in Iran, which has been published in local and international journals from 1960 to 2014 using various databases including PubMed, SID, Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct. Results: During the period of the study the infection rates of 0.1% to 91.4% was noted in various livestock. Despite the higher infection rates of livestock in southern areas in past decades, human disease has been mostly encountered in northern Provinces especially in Guilan. Recent studies indicate noticeable decrease in prevalence rates of veterinary fascioliasis in Iran, however the prevalence rates of fascioliasis in livestock in northern Provinces of Guilan and Mazandaran seem to remain at a higher level in comparison to other parts. New foci of the disease have also been reported recently. Conclusion: While the prevalence of animal fascioliasis has decreased during last decades, human fascioliasis emerged as a public health problem in the country. The validity of new foci of human fascioliasis needs complementary standard studies.
