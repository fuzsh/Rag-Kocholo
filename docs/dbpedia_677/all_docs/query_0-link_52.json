Many countries have achieved major developments in media accessibility, while others like Turkey are currently embarking on the journey. The following article discusses developments in media accessibility in Turkey with emphasis on disability and the implication of coaccessibility which may be defined broadly as appealing to audiences with differing accessibility needs, through the translation(s) inputted on a single product. The research so far seems to indicate that coaccessibility has potential political, social, educational and other implications. Turkish end-users embrace the current coaccessibility model, but the ultimate goal in accessibility for Turkey is to have optional sign language interpreting, audio description and subtitling for the D/deaf and hard of hearing and the actors need to strive to achieve this. Currently, it also falls to academics to research this phen...\n\nResearch on Turkish Sign Language has gained momentum since its official recognition as a full-fledged language in 2006, but sign language interpreting still remains as an under-researched field in Turkey.

ÖZET Türk İşaret Dili üzerine yapılan araştırmalar Türk İşaret Dilinin 2006 yılında resmen tanınması ile birlikte hız kazanmıştır, ancak Türkiye'de işaret dili çevirmenliği Çeviribilimin henüz yeterince araştırılmamış alanlarından biri olmaya devam etmektedir. Bu eksiklikten hareketle doğan bu çalışmanın amacı Türkiye'de Sağırların medyaya erişiminin mevcut durumunu ile Sağır Türk bireylerin televizyon içeriklerine erişimleri için kendilerine sunulan seçenekler ile ilgili düşünce ve değerlendirmelerini ortaya koymak ve Sağır toplumunun işaret dili çevirisi ve altyazı aracılığıyla televizyon içeriklerine erişiminin çeşitli sebeplerle hala çözülememiş olduğu hipotezini kanıtlamaktır. 1993 yılından beri Türk televizyonlarında işaret dilinin bulunmasına rağmen, işaret dili çevirisi üzerine Çeviribilim açısından Türkiye'de konuyla ilgili araştırmaya rastlanmaması sonucu\n\nThis thesis is a contribution towards the subtitling practice of audiovisual programmes for deaf children. It starts by offering an overview of relevant research on Subtitling for the Deaf and the Hard of Hearing (SDH), conducted both in the UK and abroad. A descriptive and comprehensive study on how children’s programmes broadcast in British television are subtitled for deaf children constitutes the starting point of the project. In an attempt to gain an understanding on how deaf children read subtitles, the linguistic difficulties encountered in the acquisition of a spoken language as well as their reading characteristics are examined. In doing so, contributions from both Deaf Studies and Audiovisual Translation are considered. Deaf children are placed in their social context and the different types of hearing loss, prelingual and postlingual deafness, and cochlear implantation are discussed. Education for the deaf is also tackled, encompassing the history, philosophies and current trends. The ultimate aim of the project is to contribute to the subtitling practice of deaf children by conducting empirical analysis. Hands-on research is conducted with a group of deaf children recruited from a mainstream school. Case studies are used in the piloting leading to the main experiment, which consists of exploring techniques to enhance word recognition and content comprehension. The findings of the main experiment, analysed using statistics, and the children's feedback, obtained orally at the end of the main activity and presented in a narrative form, are discussed as a contribution towards future research.\n\nToday, our society can be considered as an “information society”. In fact, the audiovisual media are ubiquitous in our lives and represent an essential tool for accessing information. Hence, the importance of equal opportunity and social integration of disabled people. Social pressure, as well as the legal framework, is increasing in order to remove the barriers that this target group faces when trying to get access to information through audiovisual media on an equal basis with non-disabled people. Deafness, both pre-locutive and acquired, can also be associated or derived from other disabling conditions which the project deals with. This work contributes to the training of translators interested in communicating with people with disabilities, and the research we carried out shed light on the communication gaps faced by disadvantaged groups. Our study focuses on people with hearing impairment and their access to audiovisual media just as the hearing people via SDH or subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing in Spain. This adapted system is, so far, the most efficient way for this group to access entertainment, culture and information, and, therefore, it represents substantial improvements in their quality of life. In 2003, the Spanish Association of Standardization and Certification (AENOR) published a standard with subtitling guidelines for deaf and hard of hearing people as a result of consultations with all interested parties (users, subtitlers, TV operators, etc.). In 2012 an upgrade was performed and is currently being applied in Spain (AENOR: 2012). The present work attempts to deepen in the knowledge of the profile of people who use Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH). It studies especially the perception of the quality of SDH by the Spanish hearing impaired public and tries to find out if there is a specific relationship between the user’s auditory profile and the level of satisfaction with SDH. In order to achieve this goal, a questionnaire for the hearing impaired was prepared and distributed through different institutions. Later, a descriptive analysis of the replies received was performed."
