        "text": "Whether you’re a new team or an existing group, creating an enjoyable workplace that practices transparent communication is key. Surprisingly enough, there is a big difference between leading a group vs. a team.\n\nWhile they may seem similar, there are many key differences between the two that can affect the way you work.\n\nIn order to improve your working relationships it’s important to understand the differences between a group vs. a team and how to encourage healthy communication styles in the workplace.\n\nGroup vs. team\n\nA group is a collection of individuals who coordinate their efforts, while a team is a group of people who share a common goal. While similar, the two are different when it comes to decision-making and teamwork.\n\nIn a work group, group members are independent from one another and have individual accountability. On the other hand, in a team, team members share a mutual accountability and work closely together to solve problems. These dynamics inform the way tasks are handled and overall collaboration.\n\nWhat is a group?\n\nIn short, a group is a number of people who work together. They have individual goals that they work toward collectively. While groups work toward separate goals, they have a related interest or identity that brings them together.\n\nThere are two types of groups: informal groups and formal groups. Informal groups are formed naturally around common interests, identities, or social goals. Formal groups are created by company leaders to perform a specific task for an organization.\n\nGroup advantages\n\nThere is some debate about whether groups or teams are better. The reality is, both have advantages and disadvantages, and it’s up to you to decide which one is best for your needs. Here are some advantages of groups:\n\nGroups build temporary relationships: Since groups focus on individual members working in parallel to one another, they build temporary working relationships such as short-term external projects or temporary internal consulting.\n\nGroups are great for efficiency: While teams work to create efficiency for the greater good, groups focus on individual efficiency. This can improve effectiveness when looking at individual work and larger group objectives.\n\nGroups focus on individual growth: Since groups support individual work, they also focus on individual growth. This can be seen in the form of individual experts rather than a team of experts.\n\nWhile working in a group environment has its advantages, it also has some disadvantages, too. Let’s look at some reasons why working in a group might not be right for you.\n\nRead: Efficiency vs. effectiveness in business: Why your team needs both\n\nGroup drawbacks\n\nWhile groups support individual work and career growth, they don’t share all of the advantages of working in a team setting.

This makes it difficult to connect work to organizational goals and objectives.\n\nThese disadvantages are why some organizations prefer working in teams. That’s why it’s important to also understand the advantages and disadvantages of teams.\n\nWhat is a team?\n\nA team is a number of people who work together to accomplish a shared purpose or goal. Each team is the sum of its parts, which means members of the team rely on one another to accomplish the outcome.\n\nTeams work together to solve problems, create new products, and other functions such as aligning passions and purpose. There are a few different types of teams, including cross-departmental teams, process teams, and self-managed teams. Each of these differs slightly but shares similar advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTeam advantages\n\nWorking in a team environment has many advantages that all come back to working toward the same goals and supporting members in a shared experience. Many organizations work in a team setting vs. a group setting as they prefer the advantages of collaboration. These include improved productivity and quicker problem solving.\n\nHere are some advantages of working in a team:\n\nTeams build on collaboration and synergy: Teamwork can increase collaboration and synergy. These help support the overall goal and can aid in communication and organizational transparency.\n\nTeams encourage group productivity: While groups aid in efficiency, teams have the advantage when it comes to productivity. This is because team members support each other’s work and help solve the overall problem, making the actual work more productive.\n\nTeams are better for problem solving: It’s true that the more people brainstorm together, the better.

This is because results are most commonly focused on the greater good than what’s best for each person.\n\nTeams may struggle with efficiency: Teams have the advantage of productivity, though they can struggle with efficiency if the right organizational processes are not put into place. This can cause work to take longer than expected and deadlines to be missed.\n\nWhile teams might struggle with these disadvantages, there are ways to minimize the effects with the right processes and leadership. The key is to facilitate organizational clarity that supports both teams and individuals.\n\nHow to lead groups vs. teams\n\nNow that you know the advantages and disadvantages of groups vs. teams, you may be wondering how each translates into an organization. This is an important question to consider when gauging how to lead a group or team in your current organization.\n\nGroup-focused organizations:\n\nWhen it comes to group organizational behavior, there is a lot to consider based on functionality and group dynamics. Group dynamics describe the interactions, attitudes, and behaviors between a set of people. These can negatively and positively affect teamwork depending on how they’re set up.\n\nHealthy group dynamics consist of fluid collaboration and transparency. Unhealthy group dynamics might consist of a lack of teamwork which results in individual isolation. To prevent unhealthy group dynamics, implement a team-focused strategy that focuses on breaking down communication barriers.\n\nGroup leadership tip: To prevent communication issues, organize team building games to encourage group collaboration and healthy dynamics.\n\nTeam-focused organizations:\n\nOrganizations that are focused around team dynamics tend to have more transparency and fewer communication issues. This is because teams work together toward a shared goal and focus on problem solving together.\n\nThis leads to a healthy organizational behavior and positive interdependent relationships. To take this one step further, keep collective goals in sight, and empower your team to rely on one another to meet those objectives.\n\nTeam leadership tip: Communicate both project goals and business goals to create transparency and align work with relevant objectives.\n\nSpark collaboration by transitioning from group to team\n\nThe dynamic that’s right for your team won’t be the same as everyone else. That said, team dynamics can help empower collaboration in the workplace and interdependent relationships.\n\nWhether you lead groups vs. teams, always remember to keep individual growth in sight and encourage communication to improve productivity.\n\nLooking for additional ways to increase productivity?
