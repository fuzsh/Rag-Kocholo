        "text": "Data Cloud is a data platform that unifies all of your company’s data on to Salesforce’s Einstein 1 Platform, giving every team a 360-degree view of the customer to drive automation and analytics, personalize engagement, and power trusted AI. Data Cloud creates this holistic customer view by turning volumes of disconnected data into a single, trusted model that’s easy to access and understand. This includes diverse data sets, like telemetry data, web engagement data and more across your organization or your external data lakes and warehouses. And this unified view helps your Sales, Service, and Marketing teams build personalized customer experiences, trigger data-driven actions and workflows, and safely drive AI across all of your Salesforce apps.\n\nRegardless of where your data comes from — internal apps, systems, channels, external data lakes, and even emails, images, or PDFs — Data Cloud can bring it all together, creating a unified customer profile that helps your team better understand what your customer needs today, and anticipate what they may need tomorrow. This helps teams across your organization use all of your company’s data to boost productivity and deliver deeper customer value.\n\nUsing Data Cloud, your business can consistently provide personalized customer experiences that lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and business growth. Data Cloud ensures that every employee has the right information at the right time to deliver what customers need, in near real-time, across the entire customer journey.\n\nYour company has already dedicated substantial resources to implement data solutions, such as data lakes or data warehouses. With Data Cloud, you can maximize the ROI on all of these investments. That’s because Data Cloud is designed with an open, extensible architecture that employs zero-copy integrations, allowing seamless connections to top platforms like Snowflake or Databricks — without the need to move or copy data. This approach provides unparalleled flexibility and control for managing data within Data Cloud, making it easier than ever to bring data in and send it out as needed.\n\nCompanies are collecting more data about their customers than ever before, yet that data sits in siloes and is disconnected from the customer experience. Data Cloud integrates information from various sources, which helps all teams provide a personalized customer experience at every touchpoint, leading to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business growth.\n\nBring it all together: Your data, your teams, and your customers. Learn how Salesforce Data Cloud can help you connect all of your data, and discover insights that lead to memorable customer experiences."
