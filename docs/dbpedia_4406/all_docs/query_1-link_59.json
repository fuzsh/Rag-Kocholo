        "text": "Project planning is critical in product development. Without a plan, it is just an idea. Demonstrating feasibility (an assessment on the likelihood of success) and viability (the ability to sustain success) in the early stages can garner buy-in from stakeholders and approval for development. One way to illustrate that a project meets customer requirements and makes business sense is by creating a proof of concept.\n\nThis article discusses proof of concept in product management, its value in project development, the steps to create a proof of concept, and more.\n\nWhat is proof of concept?\n\nA Proof of concept (POC) is the process of gathering evidence to support the feasibility of a project. Project managers perform a POC in the early stages of development before committing too much time and resources to a project.\n\nThe purpose of a proof of concept is to demonstrate project viability to product teams, clients, and other stakeholders. A POC may uncover flaws, leading the company to revise or abandon a project. In other cases, a POC can confirm the likelihood of project success, providing evidence of viability for development.\n\nHow to create a proof of concept\n\nCreating a document or presentation increases the likelihood of stakeholder and investor approval. Below are the steps to writing an effective proof of concept.\n\nStep 1: Define your project idea\n\nYou should first identify the project to test. A brainstorming template can help generate ideas, while a product launch template can help define the need and the market.\n\nIt’s important to ask the following questions: What problems will this project solve, and for whom? The product manager should have the required market knowledge to answer these questions.\n\nStep 2: Set your success criteria\n\nAfter defining the project, decide on the benchmarks to measure the success or failure of the project. If the project is for a client, consult them about how they define success. If not, conduct the necessary research to determine success criteria.\n\nStep 3: List the resources you will need\n\nBuild an exhaustive list of tangible and intangible resources the team will need to execute the project. Resources include material goods, technology, tools, and human capital.\n\nStep 4: Determine your timeline\n\nCreate a product roadmap that overviews the timeline for the proof of concept from ideation to development. For example, will there be a full launch from the beginning, or will it start small and then scale? If the latter, how quickly will it scale? These details provide an idea of the pace of the project.\n\nStep 5: Develop and test your prototype\n\nOnce you have decided on the project scope, you can develop and test your prototype with the target audience. Pay attention to how it addresses their pain points. It may help to bring in other teams and stakeholders to get a fresh perspective. Gather all feedback, both positive and negative.\n\nStep 6: Review and refine\n\nAfter gathering feedback, evaluate how the prototype performed against the predefined success criteria. Conduct a competitive analysis to evaluate its performance against similar solutions. Use the information from this step to improve on areas that fall short of success.\n\nStep 7: Present your POC\n\nPresent your idea to stakeholders for development approval. Provide a clear model of how the idea works—visuals and illustrations can be helpful. Emphasize how it addresses pain points and meets the audience's needs. If the proof of concept meets the success criteria, approval is likely."
