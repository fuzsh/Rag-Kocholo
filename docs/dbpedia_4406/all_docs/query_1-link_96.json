        "text": "Think of the introduction as a mental road map that must answer for the reader these four questions:\n\nWhat was I studying?\n\nWhy was this topic important to investigate?\n\nWhat did we know about this topic before I did this study?\n\nHow will this study advance new knowledge or new ways of understanding?\n\nAccording to Reyes, there are three overarching goals of a good introduction: 1) ensure that you summarize prior studies about the topic in a manner that lays a foundation for understanding the research problem; 2) explain how your study specifically addresses gaps in the literature, insufficient consideration of the topic, or other deficiency in the literature; and, 3) note the broader theoretical, empirical, and/or policy contributions and implications of your research.\n\nA well-written introduction is important because, quite simply, you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. The opening paragraphs of your paper will provide your readers with their initial impressions about the logic of your argument, your writing style, the overall quality of your research, and, ultimately, the validity of your findings and conclusions. A vague, disorganized, or error-filled introduction will create a negative impression, whereas, a concise, engaging, and well-written introduction will lead your readers to think highly of your analytical skills, your writing style, and your research approach. All introductions should conclude with a brief paragraph that describes the organization of the rest of the paper.\n\nHirano, Eliana. “Research Article Introductions in English for Specific Purposes: A Comparison between Brazilian, Portuguese, and English.” English for Specific Purposes 28 (October 2009): 240-250; Samraj, B. “Introductions in Research Articles: Variations Across Disciplines.” English for Specific Purposes 21 (2002): 1–17; Introductions.

Demystifying the Journal Article. Inside Higher Education.\n\nI. Structure and Approach\n\nThe introduction is the broad beginning of the paper that answers three important questions for the reader:\n\nWhat is this?\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\nWhat do you want me to think about / consider doing / react to?\n\nThink of the structure of the introduction as an inverted triangle of information that lays a foundation for understanding the research problem. Organize the information so as to present the more general aspects of the topic early in the introduction, then narrow your analysis to more specific topical information that provides context, finally arriving at your research problem and the rationale for studying it [often written as a series of key questions to be addressed or framed as a hypothesis or set of assumptions to be tested] and, whenever possible, a description of the potential outcomes your study can reveal.\n\nThese are general phases associated with writing an introduction:\n\n1. Establish an area to research by:\n\nHighlighting the importance of the topic, and/or\n\nMaking general statements about the topic, and/or\n\nPresenting an overview on current research on the subject.\n\n2. Identify a research niche by:\n\nOpposing an existing assumption, and/or\n\nRevealing a gap in existing research, and/or\n\nFormulating a research question or problem, and/or\n\nContinuing a disciplinary tradition.\n\n3. Place your research within the research niche by:\n\nStating the intent of your study,\n\nOutlining the key characteristics of your study,\n\nDescribing important results, and\n\nGiving a brief overview of the structure of the paper.\n\nNOTE: It is often useful to review the introduction late in the writing process. This is appropriate because outcomes are unknown until you've completed the study. After you complete writing the body of the paper, go back and review introductory descriptions of the structure of the paper, the method of data gathering, the reporting and analysis of results, and the conclusion. Reviewing and, if necessary, rewriting the introduction ensures that it correctly matches the overall structure of your final paper.\n\nII. Delimitations of the Study\n\nDelimitations refer to those characteristics that limit the scope and define the conceptual boundaries of your research. This is determined by the conscious exclusionary and inclusionary decisions you make about how to investigate the research problem. In other words, not only should you tell the reader what it is you are studying and why, but you must also acknowledge why you rejected alternative approaches that could have been used to examine the topic.\n\nObviously, the first limiting step was the choice of research problem itself. However, implicit are other, related problems that could have been chosen but were rejected. These should be noted in the conclusion of your introduction. For example, a delimitating statement could read, \"Although many factors can be understood to impact the likelihood young people will vote, this study will focus on socioeconomic factors related to the need to work full-time while in school.\" The point is not to document every possible delimiting factor, but to highlight why previously researched issues related to the topic were not addressed.\n\nExamples of delimitating choices would be:\n\nThe key aims and objectives of your study,\n\nThe research questions that you address,\n\nThe variables of interest [i.e., the various factors and features of the phenomenon being studied],\n\nThe method(s) of investigation,\n\nThe time period your study covers, and\n\nAny relevant alternative theoretical frameworks that could have been adopted.\n\nReview each of these decisions. Not only do you clearly establish what you intend to accomplish in your research, but you should also include a declaration of what the study does not intend to cover. In the latter case, your exclusionary decisions should be based upon criteria understood as, \"not interesting\"; \"not directly relevant\"; “too problematic because...\"; \"not feasible,\" and the like. Make this reasoning explicit!\n\nNOTE: Delimitations refer to the initial choices made about the broader, overall design of your study and should not be confused with documenting the limitations of your study discovered after the research has been completed.\n\nANOTHER NOTE: Do not view delimitating statements as admitting to an inherent failing or shortcoming in your research. They are an accepted element of academic writing intended to keep the reader focused on the research problem by explicitly defining the conceptual boundaries and scope of your study. It addresses any critical questions in the reader's mind of, \"Why the hell didn't the author examine this?\"\n\nIII. The Narrative Flow\n\nIssues to keep in mind that will help the narrative flow in your introduction:\n\nYour introduction should clearly identify the subject area of interest. A simple strategy to follow is to use key words from your title in the first few sentences of the introduction. This will help focus the introduction on the topic at the appropriate level and ensures that you get to the subject matter quickly without losing focus, or discussing information that is too general.\n\nEstablish context by providing a brief and balanced review of the pertinent published literature that is available on the subject. The key is to summarize for the reader what is known about the specific research problem before you did your analysis. This part of your introduction should not represent a comprehensive literature review--that comes next. It consists of a general review of the important, foundational research literature [with citations] that establishes a foundation for understanding key elements of the research problem. See the drop-down menu under this tab for \"Background Information\" regarding types of contexts.\n\nClearly state the hypothesis that you investigated. When you are first learning to write in this format it is okay, and actually preferable, to use a past statement like, \"The purpose of this study was to....\" or \"We investigated three possible mechanisms to explain the....\"\n\nWhy did you choose this kind of research study or design? Provide a clear statement of the rationale for your approach to the problem studied. This will usually follow your statement of purpose in the last paragraph of the introduction.\n\nIV. Engaging the Reader\n\nA research problem in the social sciences can come across as dry and uninteresting to anyone unfamiliar with the topic. Therefore, one of the goals of your introduction is to make readers want to read your paper. Here are several strategies you can use to grab the reader's attention:\n\nOpen with a compelling story. Almost all research problems in the social sciences, no matter how obscure or esoteric, are really about the lives of people. Telling a story that humanizes an issue can help illuminate the significance of the problem and help the reader empathize with those affected by the condition being studied.\n\nInclude a strong quotation or a vivid, perhaps unexpected, anecdote. During your review of the literature, make note of any quotes or anecdotes that grab your attention because they can used in your introduction to highlight the research problem in a captivating way.\n\nPose a provocative or thought-provoking question. Your research problem should be framed by a set of questions to be addressed or hypotheses to be tested. However, a provocative question can be presented in the beginning of your introduction that challenges an existing assumption or compels the reader to consider an alternative viewpoint that helps establish the significance of your study.\n\nDescribe a puzzling scenario or incongruity. This involves highlighting an interesting quandary concerning the research problem or describing contradictory findings from prior studies about a topic. Posing what is essentially an unresolved intellectual riddle about the problem can engage the reader's interest in the study.\n\nCite a stirring example or case study that illustrates why the research problem is important. Draw upon the findings of others to demonstrate the significance of the problem and to describe how your study builds upon or offers alternatives ways of investigating this prior research.\n\nNOTE: It is important that you choose only one of the suggested strategies for engaging your readers. This avoids giving an impression that your paper is more flash than substance and does not distract from the substance of your study.\n\nFreedman, Leora and Jerry Plotnick.
