Generally, this information is located on each state’s Department of Education page.\n\nOther U.S. Department of Education/Federal Partner Resources\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE)\n\nTitle I Assessment Final Regulations\n\nStandards, Assessments and Accountability\n\nLetter to Chief State School Officers on Assessments and Accountability (February 20, 2021)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions Impact of COVID-19 on Accountability Systems Required under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) (January 19, 2021)\n\nLetter from Education Secretary to Chief State School Officers Invitation to request a waiver, for the 2019-2020 school year of the assessment requirements (March 20, 2020)\n\nOptional Template for Requests of Waivers of Assessments (March 20, 2020)\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s OESE and OSEP\n\nAlternate Assessment Aligned to Alternate Academic Achievement Standards\n\nMemo to States Regarding Requirements to Request a Waiver/Waiver Extension for the 2023-24 School Year from the 1.0 Percent Cap on the Percentage of Students with the Most Significant Cognitive Disabilities Who May Be Assessed with an Alternate Assessment Aligned with Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AA-AAAS) (September 20, 2023)\n\nMemo to States Regarding the Requirements to Request a Waiver for the 2022-23 School Year (SY) from the One Percent Cap on the Percentage of Students With the Most Significant Cognitive Disabilities Who May Be Assessed with an Alternate Assessment Aligned with Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (September 20, 2022)\n\nPolicy Letter to State Directors: Additional Information Regarding the Requirements to Request a Waiver for the 2020-21 School Year (SY) from the One Percent Cap on the Percentage of Students With the Most Significant Cognitive Disabilities Who May Be Assessed with an Alternate Assessment Aligned with Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AA-AAAS) (June 9, 2020)\n\nMemo to States Regarding Consequences for States Not Meeting the Requirement to Assess Not More than 1.0 Percent of Students on the Alternate Assessment (March 28, 2019)\n\nMemo to States with Additional Information Regarding the Cap on the Percentage of Students Who May Be Assessed with an Alternate Assessment (August 27, 2018)\n\nMemo to States Regarding the Cap on the Percentage of Students who may be Assessed with an Alternate Assessment (May 16, 2017)\n\nFinal Regulations to No Longer Authorize Modified Academic Achievement Standards for Certain Students with Disabilities (August 21, 2015)\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nNational Center on Educational Outcomes\n\nCenter on Standards, Assessment and Accountability (CSAA)\n\nUnder the IDEA, states are required to submit outcome data to the Department annually on young children receiving services under IDEA Part C and Part B Preschool in order to access the impact of those programs.\n\nOther U.S. Department of Education/Federal Partner Resources\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Early Learning Initiatives\n\nScreening and Assessment\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nEarly Childhood Technical Assistance Center’s (ECTA) Outcomes Measurement\n\nBullying of any student by another student, for any reason, cannot be tolerated in our schools.\n\nChildren with disabilities are disproportionately affected by bullying. For example, children with learning disabilities, attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder, and autism are more likely to be bullied than their peers.\n\nDue to the characteristics of their disabilities, children with intellectual, communication, processing, or emotional disabilities may not understand the extent to which bullying behaviors are harmful, or may be unable to make the situation known to an adult who can help.\n\nWhether or not the bullying is related to the student’s disability, any bullying of a student with a disability that results in the student not receiving meaningful educational benefit constitutes a denial of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under the IDEA that must be remedied.\n\nThe Department has issued guidance including practices for use as part of any bullying prevention and intervention program to help ensure that school and classroom settings are positive, safe, and nurturing environments for all children and adults.\n\nOSEP

educational agencies (LEAs) have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that all children with disabilities residing in the state who need special education and related services are identified, located, and evaluated, regardless of the severity of the disability.\n\nThis requirement, known as Child Find, includes activities to determine whether a child is a child suspected of having a disability who should be referred for evaluation to determine eligibility for special education and related services under Part B.\n\nThis responsibility includes children who are homeless or wards of the state and highly mobile and migrant children with disabilities, as well as those suspected of having developmental delays.\n\nIt also includes children who have complex medical needs and who reside in nursing homes because of serious health problems and those that are in correctional facilities.\n\nUnder Part C of the IDEA, each state must have a comprehensive child find system that ensures all infants and toddlers with disabilities in the state who are eligible for early intervention services are identified, located, and evaluated.\n\nTo fully comply with this requirement, Part C must ensure the child find system is coordinated with all other major efforts to locate and identify children by other state agencies responsible for administering education, health, and social

This occurs through a review of all relevant information in the student’s file, including the IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents.\n\nThe group must determine if the child’s behavior was caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child’s disability, or if the behavior was the direct result of the LEA’s failure to implement the IEP.\n\nIf the behavior is determined to be a manifestation of the child’s disability, the IEP Team either must conduct a functional behavioral assessment unless one had already been conducted prior to the behavior that resulted in a change in placement, and implement a behavioral intervention plan for the child or review an existing behavioral intervention plan and modify it, if necessary, to address the behavior.\n\nAlso, unless the parent and the LEA agree to a change in placement, the child must be returned to the placement from which he or she was removed.\n\nOSEP Guidance and Resources\n\nGuidance to Help Schools Support Students with Disabilities and Avoid Disparities In the Use of Discipline:\n\nOSEP National Technical Assistance Call, Discipline Guidance Video and Powerpoint Presentation (PDF) (Oct. 13, 2022)\n\nOSEP Dear Colleague Letter on Implementation of IDEA Discipline Provisions.

For a child with a disability who is enrolled in a separate facility, the public agency responsible for the child’s education must ensure she or he receives appropriate physical education services in accordance with the requirements in 34 CFR 300.108.\n\nOSEP Guidance and Resources\n\nReport on Creating Equal Opportunities for Children And Youth with Disabilities to Participate in Physical Education and Extracurricular Athletics (August 2011)\n\nOther U.S. Department of Education/Federal Partner Resources\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights\n\nED Clarifies Schools’ Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics (Jan. 25, 2013)\n\nThe IDEA is designed to improve educational results for all children with disabilities.\n\nTherefore, it provides benefits and services to children with disabilities in public schools and requires school districts to make services and benefits available to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in nonpublic (private) schools.\n\nThe law includes language requiring state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) to ensure the equitable participation of parentally placed children with disabilities in programs assisted by or carried out under the equitable participation requirements that apply to them.\n\nOSEP Guidance and Resources\n\nPOLICY LETTER 22-06: November 16, 2022, to Flanigan\n\nTOPIC: Parentally-Placed Private School Children with Disabilities\n\nQ&A on Serving Children with Disabilities Placed by Their Parents in Private Schools\n\nOther U.S. Department of Education/Federal Partner Resources\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office of Innovation and Improvement\n\nOffice of Non-Public Education\n\nONPE’s IDEA Provision Related to Children with Disabilities Enrolled by Their Parents in Private Schools (March 2011)\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nCenter for Parent Information and Resources\n\nVideo: OSEP Q&A on Serving Children with Disabilities Placed by Their Parents in Private Schools\n\nModule 16—Children Enrolled by Their Parents in Private Schools\n\nFor those students who may need additional academic and behavioral supports to succeed in a general education environment, schools may choose to implement a multi-tiered system of supports (MTSS), such as response to intervention (RTI) or positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS).\n\nMTSS is a school-wide approach that addresses the needs of all students, including struggling learners and students with disabilities, and integrates assessment and intervention within a multi-level instructional and behavioral system to maximize student achievement and reduce problem behaviors.\n\nMTSS, which includes scientific, research-based interventions, also may be used to identify children suspected of having a specific learning disability.\n\nWith a multi-tiered instructional framework, schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes; monitor their progress; provide evidence-based interventions; and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a student’s responsiveness.\n\nChildren who do not, or minimally, respond to interventions must be referred for an evaluation to determine if they are eligible for special education and related services; and those children who simply need intense short-term interventions may continue to receive those interventions.\n\nOSEP Guidance and Resources\n\nOSEP Memo 11-07 on Response to Intervention (Jan. 21, 2011) MS Word | PDF\n\nOSEP Memo 16-07 on Response to Intervention (RTI) and Preschool Services (April 29, 2016)\n\nDear Colleague Letter on Dyslexia (Oct. 23, 2015)\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nCenter on Multi-Tiered System of Supports\n\nEarly Childhood Technical Assistance Center\n\nResponse to Intervention in Early Childhood\n\nIDEA 2004 Reauthorization Resources\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Documents\n\nResponse to Intervention (RTI) and Early Intervening Services (EIS): MS Word | PDF\n\nThe IDEA and its implementing regulations addresses transition services for children with disabilities.\n\nThe term “transition services” means a coordinated set of activities for a child with a disability that:\n\nis designed to be within a results-oriented process that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child’s movement from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, and community participation\n\nis based on the individual child’s needs, taking into account the child’s strengths, preferences, and interests\n\nincludes instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives, and, if appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocational evaluation\n\nTransition services may be special education, if provided as specially designed instruction, or a related service, if required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.\n\nOSERS Guidance and Resources\n\nA Transition Guide to Postsecondary Education and Employment for Students and Youth with Disabilities (August 2020)\n\nIncludes letter from RSA Commissioner and OSEP Director on the importance of collaboration between special education and vocational rehabilitation related to secondary transition\n\nExpect, Engage, and Empower: Successful Transitions for All!\n\nOSERS’ Successful Transition for All Blog Series (2023)\n\nOngoing blog series from OSERS’ OSEP and RSA to improve transition planning and transition services for students with disabilities\n\nSuccessful Transitions for All! resource page\n\nStay up to date with OSERS’ Successful Transitions for All! webinars, video messages, symposia registration and recordings, resources, and more.\n\nOther U.S. Department of Education/Federal Partner Resources\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights\n\nTransition of Students with Disabilities to Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nNational Deaf Center on Postsecondary Outcomes/National Postsecondary Education Programs Network (pn2)\n\nNational Technical Assistance Center on Transition (NTACT)\n\nCollege and Career Readiness and Success Center\n\nNational Clearinghouse of Rehabilitation Training Materials (NCRTM)\n\nIDEA 2004 Reauthorization Resources\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Documents\n\nSecondary Transition: MS Word | PDF\n\nIDEA requires states to collect and examine data to determine if significant disproportionality based on race and ethnicity is occurring in the state and the local educational agencies (LEAs) of the state with respect to:\n\nthe identification of children as children with disabilities, including the identification of children as children with disabilities in accordance with a particular impairment;\n\nthe placement in particular educational settings of such children; and\n\nthe incidence, duration, and type of disciplinary actions, including suspensions and expulsions.\n\nThe IDEA does not, however, define “significant disproportionality.”\n\nThe regulations do not explicitly define the term either. Instead, regulations require states to use a standard methodology for analysis of disproportionality, which includes states setting a threshold above which disproportionality in the identification, placement, or discipline of children with disabilities within an LEA is significant.\n\nOSEP Guidance and Resources\n\nSignificant Disproportionality Reporting Under IDEA Part B\n\nQuestion and Answers and Model State Timeline on Significant Disproportionality (Equity in IDEA) (March 31, 2017)\n\nThese resources are a follow-up to the Equity in IDEA final regulation, which was published in the Federal Register Dec. 19, 2016 and became effective on Jan. 18, 2017.\n\nOn May 6, 2019, the Department of Justice filed a Notice of Appeal in COPAA v. DeVos. The filing of this Notice of Appeal does not stay the district court order or alter the fact that the December 19, 2016 Equity in IDEA regulation on significant disproportionality is currently in effect.\n\nThe Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services posted the following to the department’s site May 20, 2019: “Pursuant to the plain language of the December 19, 2016 Equity in IDEA regulation on significant disproportionality, and in conjunction with the March 7, 2019 decision in COPAA v. Devos, the department expects states to calculate significant disproportionality for the 2018–2019 school year using the 2016 rule’s standard methodology, or to recalculate using the 2016 rule’s standard methodology if a different methodology has already been used for this school year.”\n\nNOTE: The department postponed the compliance date of this regulation from July 1, 2018 to July 1, 2020 through 83 FR 31306 published July 3, 2018. The regulation also postpones the compliance date for including children ages three through five in significant disproportionality analysis from July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2022.\n\nThe Q&A guidance document includes questions and answers on the rule, including the standard methodology; remedies; effective and compliance dates; and a glossary of terms. It is intended to be used as a resource for states as they begin engaging with stakeholders around the implementation of the final rule.\n\nThe Model State Timeline outlines the different streams of work and the timelines that states should consider as they implement the new rule.\n\nWebinar on Equity in IDEA 101: Contents of the Final Rule (Feb. 7, 2017)\n\nWebinar on Equity in IDEA 201: Implementing the Final Rule (March 30, 2017)\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nOSEP IDEAs That Work\n\nDisproportionality and Equity\n\nIDEA 2004 Reauthorization Resources\n\nModule 5—Disproportionality and Overrepresentation\n\nTeaching is one of the most important and challenging careers, and of all the school-related factors that impact student academic performance, great teachers matter most and that is especially true for children with disabilities.\n\nGreat teachers, related services providers and principals matter enormously to the learning and the lives of all children, especially children with disabilities.\n\nStates must establish and maintain qualifications to ensure the personnel necessary to implement the IDEA Part B requirements are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained. This includes making sure those personnel have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.\n\nIDEA authorizes and OSEP invests in personnel development for those who serve and support children with disabilities (birth through 21) and their families.\n\nOSEP Funded Technical Assistance Centers and Resources\n\nEarly Childhood Personnel Center (ECPC)\n\nCONNECT: The Center to Mobilize Early Childhood Knowledge\n\nCollaboration for Effective Educator Development, Accountability, and Reform (CEEDAR)\n\nThe IRIS Center\n\nCenter on Great Teachers and Leaders\n\nThe IDEA and its implementing regulations address the transportation needs of children with disabilities.\n\nTransportation is a related service as defined by 34 CFR §300.34(c)(16) of the IDEA regulations and can include travel to and from school and between schools; travel in and around school buildings; and specialized equipment such as special or adapted buses, lifts, and ramps.\n\nA child’s individualized education program (IEP) Team is responsible for determining both if transportation is required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education and related services and how the transportation services should be implemented.\n\nThe IDEA and the implementing regulations also include travel training in the definition of special education. Travel training is instruction that enables children with disabilities to develop an awareness of the environment in which they live, and to learn the skills necessary to move effectively and safely from place to place within that environment.\n\nBoth transportation and travel training are important services IEP Teams should continue to consider when they plan for a child’s postsecondary transition needs.\n\nIDEA 2004 Reauthorization Resources\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Documents\n\nServing Children with Disabilities Eligible for Transportation: MS Word | PDF\n\nDuring the last decade, there has been a proliferation of educational models involving varying degrees of in-person and online instruction and practice.\n\nMany state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs), including charter schools that operate as LEAs, provide a variety of Internet-based or online instruction to children, including children with disabilities under the IDEA.\n\nIn addition, some LEAs have begun, or are considering, offering children the opportunity to attend virtual schools.\n\nThe educational rights and protections afforded to children with disabilities and their parents under IDEA must not be diminished or compromised when children with disabilities attend virtual schools that are constituted as LEAs or are public schools of an LEA.\n\nOSEP Guidance and Resources\n\nDear Colleague Letter on Online and Virtual Schools (Aug. 5, 2016)\n\nSevere Discrepancy, Severe Discrepancy, Severe Discrepancy, Severe Discrepancy, Severe Discrepancy, District wide, District wide, District wide, District wide\n\nShare:\n\nEmail LinkedIn"
