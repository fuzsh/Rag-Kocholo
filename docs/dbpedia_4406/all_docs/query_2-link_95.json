        "text": "To get your team up and running in Microsoft Teams, you'll need to create the team, add people, and add channels. Here's how.\n\nTo create a team, click Join or create a team. This is where you create your own team, or discover existing ones. We'll create a new one here.\n\nGive the team a name and add a short description if you like. By default, your team is private, meaning you'll have to add the people or groups you want on the team. Make the team public if you want anyone in the org to be able to find and join the team.\n\nNext, invite people, groups, or even entire contact groups to join the team. If you need to add people from outside your org, use their email addresses to invite them as guests. Add a friendly display name for them, too.\n\nYou need to be a team owner to invite guests. In this case, you're creating the team, so you're automatically an owner.\n\nOnce you've added members to your team, you'll want to set up channels. By default, every team gets a General channel. This is a good one to use for information and announcements that the whole team needs.\n\nTo create a new channel, click More options (the three dots), then Add channel. You can build a channel around a topic, like presentations, a project, department name, or whatever you like. Give it a name and description, and then decide if the channel should automatically be visible in everyone's channel list. This can help people know which channels are the most important. Like adding guests, you'll need to be a team owner to do this.\n\nTeam owners have even more options for customizing and managing a team. Click More options next to a team you own to see them. Manage team is where you'll find these options and more in-depth settings, all in one place.\n\nFor the finishing touch, add a team picture to give your team some personality.\n\nWith a great name, a few members and channels, and a perfect team picture, your team is good to go."
