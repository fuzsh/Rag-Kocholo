        "text": "Story:\n\nAfter a head-on collision with a local felon that's infamous for his Valley Boy accent, family buffoon Homer Jay Simpson finds himself in a bit of a pickle. He has absolutely no car insurance or moneys to cover the damage, and the man he ran into is growing impatient. Fearing for his life and not to upset Mr. Jailbird (and Marge), Homer begins searching around town for a 'get rich quick' scheme.\n\nAs fate would have it, Homer runs into a dork testing a new virtual reality game based off of Springfield, with a sizeable bounty for anybody insane enough to head inside. Said virtual reality program is capable of generating a unique atmosphere per 'Level'. However, it's still very much an early beta, as there's no way to safely leave the game after entering it...Unless it's completed! Fortunately, the poindexter is 50% certain it's completable in it's current state. That's like...nearly half a chance of surviving!\n\nAll Homer has to do to clear the game is to find the delicious Golden Donut hidden in every Level. Figuring he has nothing to lose, Homer heads inside the virtual reality game to beta test it, find the donuts, and come out a hero to himself. Can he do it?\n\nAbout:\n\nThis mod is something I started creating in my free-time while looking into a potentially cleaner way to do 'subtitles' for mod dialog. Realizing I wasn't constrained to do a mod plot that relied on sentence mixing or looking for pre-existing dialog, I decided to create a Simpsons mod based on a plot/idea I had on the backburner for ages. The mod as a whole is really just an excuse to design completely custom missions in the vanilla game maps, but I tried to add some pizazz in order to better incentive the player to try it out. As such:\n\nThe mod really isn't focusing on nods towards the show.\n\nEach Level will make use of the vanilla game maps with some re-texturing shenanigans.\n\nThe Connected Map mod by Colou will likely not be used at all (at least for the Levels that have fairly finalized plans). It'd be far too much additional texture work for each Level and the missions were designed/written with the vanilla maps in mind.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBrand new Levels!...Erm, brand new re-skins of existing Levels! While you'll be exploring the same tired 'n' true maps, they've been reskinned to have a unique theme and atmosphere to it. Explore a cartoon Evergreen Terrace, a 16-bit-esque Downtown Springfield, and more!\n\nUnique car skins per Level! That's right! Your car's appearance will change in each Level to better suit the environment. That's certainly a good excuse to explore the maps and find some additional cars to purchase or win, right?\n\n5 Story Missions in each Level, with Bonus Challenges and a unique Bonus Mission in each! That's a whopping total of 9 Missions in each Level...which is almost 10!\n\nA gripping self-contained plot in each Level that's sure to hold your interest for...5 Story Missions.\n\nA built-in 'Free Roam' option as a reward for beating all Story Missions! If you warp back to a Level after clearing it, the two empty mission slots will change into a free roam option that allows you to explore the map at your own pace to find the remaining secrets. No HUD icons in sight!\n\nNew Data Cards with graphics shamelessly stolen from Sonic Battle...which also help towards 100% completion of each Level! Certain cards can be viewed and have different text each mission that give hints as to where the collectibles are. No more looping the Levels for ages trying to find that last Card or Wasp. Perfect for preserving your sanity!\n\n15 Wasps Frink Flies in each Level!\n\nText-based dialog that can be skipped at the player's leisure!...You've already seen this, but it's what primarily got this mod off the ground.\n\nScreenshots (Note: These areas are still a work in progress):\n\nYokel comin' through!\n\nClose Encounters of the Awkward Kind!\n\nHomer monkeys around near Lard Lads.\n\nRiveting dialog! Exposition! Exclamation points!!!\n\nDownload Link (Latest Release ~ 1.66):\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nDropbox\n\nMEGA\n\n(Fixes an issue I just now noticed with the Family Sedan phonebooth model being screwed up.)\n\n6,014 views Â· 22 likes\n\nSending vote...\n\nRetexture give me road rage vibez, last screenshot has wrong link btw\n\nWent ahead and fixed that a whole day later. Apologies about that! Not sure how I initially overlooked it while previewing the thread, but I assure you it isn't too much to look at. Probably a poor screenshot choice since the house still needs to be finished up, but pretty much all of Level 1 is in the bag.\n\nThe reason it probably gives you Road Rage vibes is due to several of the textures originating from the Road Rage E3 prototype, prior to art style direction shift. I wanted a more cartoony vibe for the first Level and initially started out using textures from Taz: Wanted as a base, but it looked extremely poopy and smelly so it was junked almost immediately. Tappie ended up suggesting a much better reference point that I fell in love with instantly, so I began crafting textures that matched the prototype's style. Really glad to see so many people like how this Level is turning out!\n\nThe mod also has some small nice quality of life features I neglected to mention in the original post that were achieved using Additional Script Functionality:\n\nCheckpoints are now a thing in every main story mission and Bonus Mission, complete with some .pag modifications to indicate when you've reached one! Nifty. Don't expect them to pull you out of a jam in a Street Race Challenge though. Those are short enough that you can do without them. You can probably use these checkpoints and some clever resetting to clear missions a wee bit quicker, but who's timing you?...Oh. That's right. The game.\n\nPayouts for every mission! Story Missions now pay out 200 Coins for completing them, with 150 for the Street Races and Bonus Missions. If you find yourself low on funds to buy a new ride later down the line, and exploring the Level doesn't interest you, you can return to missions to grind out some coins. Go ahead and replay the missions you liked with your own self-imposed challenges, such as using the Terrible Truck to complete them. Every mission in Level 1 has been tested to be beatable with it, but best of luck. A truck with the stats of the Monorail will test your driving skills.\n\nPrices will likely start out pretty fair and will only really require that you beat all the Story Missions in that Level to afford everything, but later on you're going to have to do some exploring and try out the other missions in order to get more coins. If that doesn't float your boat though or you get caught up in one too many Hit & Runs, you can always go back to these guys. No more Wager Race grinding. Huzzah!\n\n6 likes\n\nSending vote..."
