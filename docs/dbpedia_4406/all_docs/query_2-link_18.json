        "text": "For many, myself included, being part of a team and all that comes with it – collaboration, problem-solving, healthy conflict, help, learning, fun – influence how happy we are at work.\n\nImprove teamwork with your free copy of Collaborative Project Management\n\nModern work is increasingly more team-based with up to 75% of an employee’s spent communicating with colleagues. Successful organizations invest in teams, putting the optimal mix of people together in the right environment and creating support structures to help them excel.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to explore different types of teams, and the advantages and disadvantages of teamwork.\n\n6 Benefits of Teamwork\n\nProjects deliver the innovations organizations need to grow. Successful outcomes are more likely when your team is engaged and works well together. Below are some benefits associated with successful teamwork.\n\n1. Balanced Skillset\n\nA well-balanced team amplifies individual strengths, balances weaknesses, and taps into the expertise of each team member.\n\nIn short, the sum is greater than the parts, helping individuals achieve more collaboratively than they could alone.\n\n2. Agility\n\nBy focusing on common goals building on individual strengths, teams can improve organizational agility and efficiencies.\n\nTeam members can also be cross-trained in several roles, increasing workplace flexibility.\n\n3. Continuous Feedback and Improvement\n\nIndividuals who work alone receive less feedback and input from their co-workers, which limits opportunities for growth and improvement.\n\n4. Shared Workload\n\nUnexpected absences or departures from the team can quickly derail any project plan. Regular meetings, reports, documentation, and a collaborative project site help to keep everyone in the loop and ready to pick up extra work if needed.\n\n5. Engagement\n\nEmployee retention and engagement are a challenge for many organizations, which in turn, affects project delivery.\n\nTeam members, who are committed to a goal, understand their role in achieving that goal, and have a say in how the team works are more engaged and motivated.\n\n6. Different Perspectives\n\nWe all need help seeing the world differently from time to time. Teams benefit from healthy conflict and sharing diverse ideas.\n\n4 Pitfalls to Avoid When Working in a Team\n\nAs collaborative teams deliver more projects, organizations are encountering some challenges and obstacles. These include:\n\n1. Personality type\n\nFor some people, such as introverts, working in a team is quite challenging and draining. By contrast, extroverts gain more energy by interacting with others.\n\nIf personality types or working styles are not considered early on, project managers may find themselves in charge of a dysfunctional group, constantly at loggerheads.\n\n2. Impaired Decision-Making\n\nA cognitive bias is a mental shortcut that helps to save time and energy when making a decision.\n\nBoth individuals and teams are subject to numerous cognitive biases, which affect decision-making. Teams are particularity susceptible to:\n\nGroupthink, focusing on harmony and consensus instead of what is best for the team.\n\nSharedness bias, relying on the team for all information.\n\nPreference bias, privileging the opinions and solutions suggested by the team over other options)\n\n3. Time-constraints\n\nBuilding an effective team takes time and effort, which is not always available to project teams.\n\n4. Performance Management\n\nShared responsibility and collaboration make it difficult to evaluate individual contributions. This can lead to dissatisfaction amongst team members, who may feel they deserved more recognition for their work.\n\nRecent studies indicate collaboration can demotivate top-performers as they feel they are carrying the team and often have to settle for ‘mediocre’ work.\n\nCommon Team Types\n\nIf, like me, you are an accidental project manager, you will probably be part of a core team such as marketing or finance, and join temporary project teams as needed. To help you navigate these experiences, it’s useful to understand different types of teams and their purpose.\n\n4 Types of Project Teams\n\nA project team can take several forms, depending on the required deliverables and organizational structure.\n\n1. Cross-Functional Teams\n\nA cross-functional team comprises of individuals from different departments who are brought together to solve a particular problem in a set timeframe. The team can consist of full-time and part-time team members with different roles and responsibilities. Once the project is completed, the team is disbanded, freeing up resources for other projects.\n\n2. Matrix Teams\n\nIf an individual reports to a different manager for different aspects of their work, they are part of a matrix or ‘two-boss’ team. This structure is quite challenging for employees, often leading to conflicting decisions and confusion.\n\n3. Contract Teams\n\nIn certain instances, you may need to outsource part of the project work to external vendors. The project manager is responsible for ensuring external vendors deliver as expected.\n\n4. Virtual Teams\n\nGlobal Workplace Analytics estimates that around 3.7 million employees (2.8% of the workforce) work from home at least half the time, a number likely to rise as more companies introduce flexible working arrangements. Heavily reliant upon online collaboration tools, virtual teams are characterized by:\n\nWhen people work, for example, different shifts or time zones.\n\nWhere people work, including at home or shared working spaces.\n\nHow people work, which depends on cultural, political, social, and economic factors.\n\nOther Types of Teams\n\nFunctional/Cross Department Teams\n\nA functional team is a permanent team formed from individuals within the same work area or department. The team carries out routine work throughout the year, for example, human resource management, customer analysis, and continuous improvement, and typically report to one manager.\n\nThe work conducted by functional teams supports other teams within the organization; they also work with other departments on projects as needed.\n\nSelf-Managed Teams\n\nGrowing in popularity, self-managing teams have no manager or hierarchal structure. Instead, the team create their own norms and decide how to achieve agreed goals together. Whilst some research shows self-managing teams experience higher levels of engagement and job satisfaction, there is no evidence that they are more productive or effective.\n\nLeadership Teams\n\nConsisting of managers from differing departments, leadership teams play a key role in guiding strategic business decisions.\n\nInformal Teams\n\nThese teams are formed by employees with common interests such as implementing energy-saving initiatives."
