Our consistency and quality work are the basis for everything we do, and are what make us a leader in the home services space, as we constantly strive to \"be so remarkable, we become a beloved household name.\" Our team of dedicated associates and franchise owners, united by service to others, comprise the foundation for unleashing our elevated products, home repair services, and an elevated customer experience to the communities we serve. When combined with our Code of Values of Respect, Integrity, Customer Focus, and Having Fun in the Process, Neighborly sets the tone for our culture and business, and empowers the pursuit of entrepreneurship and a meaningful career.\n\nLike most companies, Neighborly has an official mission statement and vision; however, unlike other companies, we also have a Code of Values that each employee is urged to follow and know by heart and with heart. The Code of Values serves as a set of universal guidelines by which we strive to adhere, from the bottom of the organization all the way to the top. In fact, any meeting of three or more employees of Neighborly begins with a reciting the Code of Values."
