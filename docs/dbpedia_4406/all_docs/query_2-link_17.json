        "text": "Self-Managed Teams: Teams that are self-managed work without managers and are in charge of entire work processes or segments that provide goods or services to internal or external clients. Self-directed work teams (SDWTs) are made to make workers feel like they \"own\" their entire job. Teams are in charge of whole product lines at Tennessee Eastman, a division of Eastman Kodak Company, including processing, laboratory work, and packaging. Team members frequently have larger job assignments and cross-train to become proficient in other skills since they share team responsibilities for work outcomes. By cross-training, teams can be more flexible (Benowitz, 2001). Individuals in self-managed teams are typically coworkers who are also employed by the same company. They may have a diverse range of goals, but ultimately, they want to accomplish the same thing. They work independently and without bosses, sharing leadership and accountability. High-performing teams can frequently be categorized in this way. Small business owners and startup employees may also experience this kind of team dynamic. There will probably be some sort of transition phase because switching from working in other types of teams for the most of one's career might be challenging. Self-managed teams must be adept at providing feedback and handling difficult talks (Wilson, 2021).\n\nFunctional Teams: fulfill particular organizational tasks and comprise individuals from various levels of the hierarchy. In other terms, a functional team for a specific functional area is made up of a manager and his or her direct reports. Functional teams include, for instance, the accounting, human resources, and buying departments (Benowitz, 2001). Teams having various tasks from the same department's personnel make up functional teams, which are permanent. All employees report to the boss, who is accountable for everything. This is the standard top-down management style used by the majority of organizations. It's crucial to prioritize workplace culture across all organizational teams because communication and trust are its cornerstones (Wilson, 2021). Consider implementing an internal program to enhance communication by equipping your team with the skills to provide feedback without offending others in order to move your functional team to the next level. To increase efficiency and individual employee involvement, it may also be beneficial to clearly define the objectives, personality, and preferred support strategies of each team (Wilson, 2021).\n\nCross-functional Teams: are composed of professionals from different disciplines (or roles) who collaborate on a variety of organizational activities. Members of the team come from several disciplines, including marketing, distribution, design, and research and development. These teams frequently have the authority to make decisions without seeking management permission. For instance, when Nabisco's leaders came to the conclusion that the business needed to enhance customer relationships and better meet customer requirements, they established cross-functional teams whose mandate was to develop methods to achieve precisely that. Cross-functional teams are frequently temporary, lasting from a few months to many years, depending on the group tasks being carried out, in contrast to functional teams, which are typically permanent (Benowitz, 2001). Teams with cross-functional members come from a variety of departments. These teams work on specific projects that call for various contributions and specializations. This may occur when several teams must collaborate to complete a project successfully. If teams have been working in \"silos\" up to the moment of collaboration, this might be a challenging dynamic to negotiate. It is essential that the diverse personalities and viewpoints be welcomed and that each member of the cross-functional team utilizes their individual talents (Wilson, 2021).\n\nVirtual Teams: Virtual teams are made up of people who work remotely and use technology and teamwork tools to accomplish a common objective. Virtual teams will be more prevalent in the workplace as more workers opt for remote job alternatives. Even now, your company might have a few remote team members that must work together on functional or cross-functional teams. From a cultural standpoint inside of an organization, it's crucial for virtual team members to be involved. Making use of face-to-face video calls and providing your employees with the chance to interact personally will boost morale and rapport (Wilson, 2021)."
