        "text": "What is a project, exactly? We talk a lot about specific facets of project management, but it’s sometimes valuable to start at the root and dig into the basics.\n\nTo fully understand high-level project management concepts, it’s important to know the simple answers. When you can call on this knowledge, more complicated concepts are easier to master. Whether you’re the project manager or a stakeholder, give your next project definition with these project management tips in mind.\n\nProject Definition\n\nA project is a set of tasks that must be completed within a defined timeline to accomplish a specific set of goals. These tasks are completed by a group of people known as the project team, which is led by a project manager, who oversees the planning, scheduling, tracking and successful completion of projects.\n\nBesides the project team, projects require resources such as labor, materials and equipment. Organizations and individuals manage projects with a wide range of objectives. These can take many forms, from constructing a building to planning an event and even completing a certain duty. Retailers, for example, may pursue projects that improve the way they track order fulfillment. Construction teams complete projects any time they plan and build something—and so on!\n\nProject management software gives you the tools to manage all the parts of a project so it is delivered on time and within budget. ProjectManager is award-winning project management software with features to plan, manage and track your project in real time. Organize tasks on our robust Gantt, link all four types of task dependencies to avoid costly delays and save your project plan by setting a baseline. This allows you to track your actual progress against your planned progress to help you stay on track. Get started with ProjectManager today for free.\n\nWhat Are the Characteristics of a Project?\n\nThere are certain features or characteristics that are unique to projects and differentiate them from the daily operations or other types of activities of an organization. Here are the main characteristics of a project.\n\n1. Any Project Needs a Project Manager and a Project Team\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of a project is that it’s a team effort. While the structure of project teams might change from one organization to another, projects usually involve a project manager and a team of individuals with the necessary skills to execute the tasks that are needed.\n\n2. Every Project Needs a Project Plan\n\nProject team members need clear directions from the project manager and other project leaders so that they can execute the work that’s expected from them. These directions come in the form of a project plan. However, a project plan is more than just a set of instructions for the project team. It’s a comprehensive document that describes every aspect of a project, such as the project goals, project schedule and project budget among other important details.\n\n3. All Projects Go Through the Same Project Lifecycle\n\nThe project life cycle refers to the five phases all projects must progress through, from start to finish. The five phases of a project lifecycle serve as the most basic outline that gives a project definition. These five phases are initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and closure.\n\n4. All Projects Share the Same Project Constraints\n\nAll projects no matter their size or complexity are subject to three main constraints: time, scope and cost. This simply means that projects must be completed within a defined timeline, achieve a defined set of tasks and goals and be delivered under a certain budget.\n\nThese project constraints are known as the triple constraint or the project management triangle and are one of the most important project features to know about.\n\n5. Every Project Needs Resources\n\nA resource is anything necessary to complete a project, such as for example, labor, raw materials, machinery and equipment. For example, in construction, raw materials such as wood, glass or paint are essential project resources. That said, other resources — like time, labor and equipment — are just as important.\n\nA project manager must be able to identify all of the project resources in order to create a resource plan and manage the resources accordingly. When resources are left unaccounted for, it is easy to mismanage them.\n\nTypes of Projects\n\nProjects can take many shapes and forms, which makes classifying them into types a very difficult task that requires different approaches. Here are some of the types of projects grouped by funding source, industry and project management methodology.\n\nTypes of Projects By Funding Source\n\nOne simple way to categorize projects is to look at their source of capital.\n\nPrivate projects: Projects that are financed by businesses or private organizations.\n\nPublic projects: Projects which are funded by Government agencies.\n\nMixed projects: Projects that are financed by a public-private partnership.\n\nTypes of Projects By Industry\n\nProjects can be executed by large or small organizations from any industry. However, some industries are more project-intensive than others. Here are some of the most common types of projects by industry.\n\nConstruction projects: The main goal of any construction project is to make a building that can be used for different purposes such as infrastructure, residential or commercial use.\n\nManufacturing projects: Manufacturing projects consist of manufacturing physical products to generate profits for a company.\n\nIT projects: Information technology projects consist in establishing an IT framework for the processing of data at a company-wide scale.\n\nSoftware development projects: The main goal of a software development project is to create a software product for a client.\n\nBusiness projects: The term business project could refer to creating a new business, creating a new business unit for an existing company or simply launching a new business initiative.\n\nTypes of Projects By Project Management Methodology\n\nBesides the types of projects mentioned above, projects can also be classified by the project management methodology that’s used to plan, schedule and execute them.\n\nWaterfall projects: Waterfall is the most traditional project management methodology, where the project plan is defined before the project begins and each major project phase must be completed in sequence.\n\nAgile projects: Agile projects are planned and executed in short iterations known as sprints, where project teams plan their activities as they execute the project.\n\nProject Examples\n\nNow that we’ve reviewed the main characteristics of a project and the various project types that exist, let’s review some common project examples to better illustrate what a project is.\n\nConstruction Project Examples\n\nConstruction infrastructure projects: Building a bridge, a road, a mass transportation system or a water treatment facility.\n\nResidential construction projects: Building a house, a residential building or an apartment complex.\n\nCommercial construction projects: Building a shopping mall, a parking lot or a hotel.\n\nManufacturing Project Examples\n\nBuilding a factory from scratch\n\nManufacturing products for retail sale\n\nManufacturing products for a B2B purchase order\n\nImproving an existing production line by acquiring new machinery and training employees\n\nKey Project Terms to Know\n\nNo matter the project, there are universal project terms that are used regardless of project type, project size or any other factor. Know these seven terms like the back of your hand and you’ll be a step ahead before the project begins:\n\nProject Scope\n\nProject scope is a key aspect of the project planning stage. In many ways, it is the starting point. Determining project scope requires the project manager and their team to set goals and objectives, detail deliverables, create tasks, establish important dates and more. Project scope defines desired outcomes and all specific factors which will affect reaching them.\n\nProject Stakeholder\n\nA stakeholder refers to anyone and everyone involved in a project. A stakeholder can be involved at every stage of the project, or just in a certain way. Stakeholder analysis helps categorize how investors, team members, vendors, contractors and more can affect your project.\n\nProject Deliverables\n\nA deliverable refers to the specific outcome(s) a project creates. Deliverables can be “tangible” or “intangible,” meaning they can be a physical product or something conceptual. Typically, deliverables are the need that inspired the project in the first place. If someone contracts a builder to design and construct an office space, the office is a tangible deliverable.\n\nProject Milestones\n\nMilestones are predetermined achievements that help track project progress. Think of milestones as checkpoints. These checkpoints are decided on before a project begins, so the project manager and team know when they are on track to achieve deliverables. Without milestones, it’s difficult to know if the project is on the road to success or needs to reroute.\n\nProject Dependencies\n\nProject dependencies refer to how resources must be shared and allocated within a project. Many projects will use the same physical materials for different purposes and across different stages. Understanding this dependency is the only way to ensure there is enough resources to go around. Similarly, all projects are broken down into tasks. When one task cannot begin before another is completed, these tasks share a dependency.\n\nWhat It Means to Work on a Project\n\nWhether it’s the project manager, a team member or any other project stakeholder, they’re a member of the greater project team and their actions directly affect other team members. Like any team, you “win” or “lose” as a unit, so it’s incredibly important to communicate and listen to other team members in order to coordinate efforts and succeed. Most project mishaps and project failures are the direct results of poor communication or lack of collaboration.\n\nWhy does this matter as long as the work is getting done? Working on a project is about understanding the project as a whole just as much as it is about doing the work. The only way to see this big picture is by listening to the team and learning from one another.\n\nWhat Is Project Management?\n\nThe process of project management starts with the conception of the project and continues all the way through the project lifecycle. This requires detailed knowledge of company resources and how to assign them in order to complete tasks, duties, events and other projects.\n\nA wide range of industries relies on project management methods and tools to execute projects. A few examples of these industries are construction, IT, engineering, marketing and advertising. Any team working together to reach a shared objective is engaging in some form of project management.\n\nWhat Does a Project Manager Do?\n\nA project manager is more than just a manager, in the traditional sense. This individual is the leader of the project team and oversees every aspect of the project, from beginning to end. The project manager will typically write the project plan, run team meetings, assign tasks and do quality control tests to ensure everything is running smoothly. A project manager can’t carry the entire project on their back, though. One of their key duties, in fact, is knowing how to entrust various responsibilities to team members.\n\nWith the help of their team, project managers will create project schedules and budgets. They will also create project reports throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nAs you can see, their responsibilities are widespread, but that doesn’t mean spreading too thin. Ideally, a project manager creates the foundation of the project—like the foundation of a house. They then appoint other individuals to finish out each room.\n\nProject Definition: Best Practices for Project Management\n\nRegardless of the project, the size of the team, or anything else, there are practices that exponentially increase the chances of success. As vital as it is to hit goals and achieve deliverables, it’s just as important to create a positive culture within the project. These five tips may seem simple, but they make a big difference:\n\nSet Regular Team Check-ins\n\nIt’s easy to meet with the team “as needed,” but once a project begins it gets harder to find time in everyone’s schedule. Instead, schedule regular meetings before a project even starts. These meetings serve as check-ins where team members can give each other updates, voice concerns, ask questions, make adjustments and do anything else they may need. When these check-ins are already built into the schedule, no one is waiting to meet until there’s a mishap or issue.\n\nDelegate\n\nPart of what gives a project definition is knowing how to delegate. Whether it’s the project managers or a team member, they’ll more than likely need help with a task at some point. Now, this doesn’t mean just passing along the task to someone else. It means that every team member has equal responsibilities. Instead, the best project managers know how to relinquish some control and delegate to team members.\n\nKnow the Team\n\nEveryone on the project management team should be familiar with each other’s strengths, weaknesses and specialties. For example, if a team member needs information from a different department, they should know exactly who to ask. This familiarity cuts down on lost time. It is especially important for a project manager to know their team extremely well.\n\nWhen a project member knows these things, they can make decisions that play to their team members’ strengths, not around their weaknesses. Knowing the team is a huge aspect of creating a positive culture within a project, as it celebrates everyone’s abilities.\n\nCelebrate Milestones\n\nSpeaking of positive culture, never underestimate the power of taking a moment to mark meeting a milestone. Reaching one means the team has made significant progress and the project is still on track. At the very least, it’s important to announce reaching milestones during team check-ins. This keeps everyone on the same page and improves team efficacy.\n\nChoose Superior PM Tools\n\nProject management is an extremely complex job. Without the proper tools, it’s easy to make mistakes, become disorganized and even fail to complete the project. The best way to protect your project from these missteps is by choosing tools that simplify the entire process.\n\nThe best project management software does just that.
