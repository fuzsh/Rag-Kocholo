        "text": "What is a Team Role?\n\nDr Meredith Belbin defines a 'Team Role' as one of nine clusters of behavioural attributes identified by his research at Henley as being effective in order to facilitate team progress.\n\n\"The types of behaviour in which people engage are infinite. But the range of useful behaviours, which make an effective contribution to team performance, is finite. These behaviours are grouped into a set number of related clusters, to which the term Team Role is applied.\"\n\nMeredith Belbin | Team Roles at Work\n\nMeredith Belbin's research showed that the most successful teams were made up of a diverse mix of behaviours. To build high-performing teams, we need to represent each of the nine Belbin Team Role behaviours at the appropriate times.\n\nWhat are the nine Belbin Team Roles?\n\nThe nine Belbin Team Roles are: Resource Investigator, Teamworker and Co-ordinator (the Social roles); Plant, Monitor Evaluator and Specialist (the Thinking roles), and Shaper, Implementer and Completer Finisher (the Action or Task roles). You can find more detail about each Team Role below.\n\nHow do I find out my Belbin Team Role strengths and weaknesses?\n\nThe only sanctioned way of finding out your Belbin® Team Role strengths and weaknesses is by completing the official Belbin® Self-Perception Inventory online, and receiving a Belbin® Individual report. We then recommend that you ask for feedback from people you work with, using the Observer Assessment. This gives you an updated Belbin Individual report which gives you an insight in to which Team Role behaviors others see and value.\n\nOver 3 million Belbin® reports have been generated worldwide for individuals, managers, teams and organisations. Contact us to start your Belbin® journey, or purchase your own Belbin Individual report directly here.\n\nProvides the necessary drive to ensure that the team keeps moving and does not lose focus or momentum.\n\nStrengths: Challenging, dynamic, thrives on pressure. Has the drive and courage to overcome obstacles.\n\nAllowable weaknesses: Can be prone to provocation, and may sometimes offend people's feelings.\n\nDon't be surprised to find that: They could risk becoming aggressive and bad-humoured in their attempts to get things done.\n\nNeeded to plan a workable strategy and carry it out as efficiently as possible.\n\nStrengths: Practical, reliable, efficient. Turns ideas into actions and organises work that needs to be done.\n\nAllowable weaknesses: Can be a bit inflexible and slow to respond to new possibilities.\n\nDon't be surprised to find that: They might be slow to relinquish their plans in favour of positive changes."
