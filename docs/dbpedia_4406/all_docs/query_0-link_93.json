But when you’re only hearing the same perspectives and opinions over and over again, you may be in something called an echo chamber.\n\nCheck out the video below to learn more about echo chambers.\n\nAn echo chamber is an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. Echo chambers can create misinformation and distort a person’s perspective so they have difficulty considering opposing viewpoints and discussing complicated topics. They’re fueled in part by confirmation bias, which is the tendency to favor info that reinforces existing beliefs.\n\nOnline echo chambers\n\nEcho chambers can happen anywhere information is exchanged, whether it’s online or in real life. But on the Internet, almost anyone can quickly find like-minded people and perspectives via social media and countless news sources. This has made echo chambers far more numerous and easy to fall into.\n\nThe Internet also has a unique type of echo chamber called a filter bubble. Filter bubbles are created by algorithms that keep track of what you click on. Websites will then use those algorithms to primarily show you content that’s similar to what you’ve already expressed interest in. This can prevent you from finding new ideas and perspectives online.\n\nRecognizing echo chambers\n\nEcho chambers can also be tricky to recognize, especially if you’re in one. If you’re ever wondering if a social group or website may be an echo chamber, stop and think about a few questions:\n\nDo they tend to only give one perspective on an issue?\n\nIs that viewpoint mainly supported by rumor or incomplete evidence?\n\nAre facts ignored whenever they go against that viewpoint?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you may have found an echo chamber.\n\nAvoiding echo chambers\n\nThere’s no perfect way to avoid echo chambers, but here are a few tips that can help you stay on the right track.\n\nMake a habit of checking multiple news sources to ensure you’re getting complete, objective info.\n\nInteract with people of different perspectives, and take care to discuss new ideas with facts, patience, and respect.\n\nRemember that just because you want something to be true, doesn’t make it fact.\n\nNo matter where you go or who you meet, always take the time to stay informed, check your sources, and avoid echo chambers.\n\n/en/digital-media-literacy/how-filter-bubbles-isolate-you/content/"
