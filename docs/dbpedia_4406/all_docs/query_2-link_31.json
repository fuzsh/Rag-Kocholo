It connects them personally and discovers hidden traits. Outdoor activities need the teams to step out of the office, which is not feasible at all times. Indoor team-building games such as a Foosball tournament or a scavenger hunt are an excellent mood booster too!\n\n2. Communication-based Team-building Technique\n\nThe key to any social networking is communication.\n\nPerfect for a new team with all new members, a communication-based team-building approach can be a great ice breaker.

Some of them are:\n\nThe barter puzzle: Divide the members into smaller groups. Each group will be given a jigsaw puzzle with some missing pieces. The members will have to find the missing parts by negotiating with the other teams.\n\nTruths and lies: Every team member will write down two truths and a lie about themselves on a piece of paper. The rest of the team will have to identify the lie among the three. It is a great way to get to know the team members better.\n\n3. Skills-based Team-building Technique\n\nAre you thinking of a team bonding experience that can be fun and productive at the same time? A skill-based team-building activity can enhance the skills of the team members required for their respective jobs.\n\nEmployees acquire skills that are beneficial for their job, which will improve the team’s overall performance.

When a large number of people are involved, clashes are bound to occur within the group.\n\nAccording to this report, employees in the U.S spend approximately 2.8 hours each week involved in a conflict.\n\nProblem-solving activities can improve communication, interpersonal relationships and mend differences to reach a common goal. The team leader must identify and analyze the problem. Then they must determine the best course of action to take.\n\nYou can make this process enjoyable by introducing fun games or exercises for the team.

Value-based Team-building Technique\n\nMillennials and Gen Y employees belive in social welfare. They believe in giving back to society.\n\nA value-based team-building activity is a win-win situation for both the organization and the employees. Organizations can merge their CSR goals along with some outstanding team bonding experiences. It can give a meaningful experience to the employees by contributing to society and positively impacting the lives of those in need.\n\nThe activities can range from environmental, philanthropic, human rights, or economic responsibility. Events like charity cycling, cooking for a cause, and the welfare of the street dogs are some of the activities that your team must try. Such activities have also proven to boost employee engagement, employee morale, and job satisfaction. It can also act as a key factor in attracting young talent to the company.\n\nSumming it up\n\nAll in all, team-building exercises should not only be a “fun time” in the office. It must also act as building blocks for bringing businesses and people together. Now the question arises, how frequently should there be a team-building activity?\n\nIn reality, what worked for a company might not work for another. It all depends on your objective and purpose. Therefore, there is no hard and fast rule to the routine of carrying out a team activity.\n\nBut there might be a few good indicators on when to conduct a team bonding exercise, which are:\n\nWhen a new member or two has joined the team.\n\nWhen you are planning to merge two departments.\n\nWhen you are trying to focus on a specific team issue or trying to improve a certain team aspect.\n\nWhen you are trying to improve internal communication. It can be between a geographically dispersed workforce or building camaraderie between them.\n\nOn a final note, regardless of the type of team-building activity you choose, be open to suggestions and feedback from your team as well."
