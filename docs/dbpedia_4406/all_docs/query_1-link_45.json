Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.\n\nAdvantages to using focus groups\n\nQuick and cheap.\n\nRich data—obtain information in participants’ own language. The group dynamic allows for participants to build on one another’s responses and generate ideas that they might not have thought of in an individual interview.\n\nModerator can interact with the participants, which allows for follow-up questions.\n\nInformation is provided more quickly than if people were interviewed separately.\n\nDisadvantages to using focus groups\n\nRequires a trained moderator.\n\nQuality of the discussion and usefulness depends on the skill of the moderator.\n\nData is difficult to analyze (e.g., identifying an individual opinion from the group opinion).\n\nThe sample may not be representative of the population.\n\nLess control over the data collected.\n\nThe data collected lack confidentiality and anonymity.\n\nWhen to use focus groups\n\nWant to gain an understanding of the culture of a group.\n\nNeed to gain a large amount of information in a shorter period of time.\n\nWant to explore the degree of consensus on a topic.\n\nWhen group discussion or interaction among participants would bring out insights and understanding that would not be ascertained through questionnaire items or individual interviews.\n\nWhen assessing program effectiveness.\n\nDesire feedback regarding a product, website, program, etc.\n\nSuggestions for conducting a focus group\n\nOptimal size: 6–8 people per group.\n\nRecruit for and conduct several different groups for a projec; typical number is 3 to 5.\n\nTime: 1–2 hours per group.\n\nUsually need a trained moderator that the participants do not know.\n\nCreate a comfortable atmosphere (e.g., provide food and refreshments).\n\nBe conscious that some participants may not feel comfortable voicing their opinion in front of others. Additionally, some may feel pressure to conform to the group consensus."
