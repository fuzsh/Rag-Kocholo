You can not use concept players to play matches nor can you submit them in an sbc. They are granted for you to use so that you may find a suitable solution to building a squad, especially useful before deciding to enter the transfer market as the concept will show how the squad will link with regards to chemistry.\n\nIf you build squads with regular cards and then you submit some of those cards in an sbc then the cards you submitted will be replaced automatically with concept cards.\n\nTo remove the concept player hold square button PS or x button Xbox after moving the highlighting cursor over that player, there will be an option on the jog wheel that appears which states \"remove from squad\"\n\nIf you remove all your concept players out of the squad and then search your club for those players and they are not there then you will know they are gone. To get them back you must either buy them from the transfer market or acquire them from packs unless they were one-off editions such as objectives players or sbc players.\n\nIf you hold triangle PS or y Xbox to search your club, within a squad screen, then you can choose to search for concept players on/off in the Advanced Filters tile (see screenshot)\n\nAny and all players submitted into an sbc - after confirming that you want to submit them - are gone. There is no way to reverse this decision.."
