        "text": "Group and Team are often used interchangeably. A group is a collection of individuals who come together for a common purpose or shared interest, whereas A team is a more structured and cohesive form of a group. It is characterised by a higher degree of interdependence, coordination, and collaboration among its members.\n\nWhat is a Group?\n\nA group is a collection of individuals who come together for a common purpose or shared interest. The members of a group may share certain characteristics, such as being part of the same organisation, having a common hobby, or being connected through a specific context or goal. However, they may have individual goals and responsibilities that are not necessarily aligned with each other. Group members may interact with each other, but their level of coordination and collaboration may vary.\n\nFor example, a group of students working on a class project can be considered a group. While they have the common objective of completing the project, individual students may have different ideas, work independently, and contribute to the project in their way without significant interdependence.\n\nWhat is a Team?\n\nA team is a more structured and cohesive form of a group. It is characterised by a higher degree of interdependence, coordination, and collaboration among its members. Unlike a group, a team has a clear and defined purpose or mission, specific goals to achieve, and a collective responsibility for reaching those goals. Team members often have complementary skills, expertise, or roles that contribute to the overall performance and success of the team.\n\nFor example, a software development team working on building a new application can be considered a team. Each team member has a specific role, such as a programmer, designer, or tester, and they work together closely, relying on each other’s contributions to create the final product. The team members’ efforts are coordinated, and they actively collaborate, communicate, and share responsibilities to accomplish their shared goals.\n\nDifference between Group and Team\n\nBasis\n\nGroup\n\nTeam\n\nPurpose and Goals\n\nA group may have a common purpose or interest, but individual members may have different goals and objectives. A team has a shared purpose and specific goals that all members work together to achieve.\n\nInterdependence\n\nMembers may work independently, and their actions may not directly affect or rely on each other. Members are highly interdependent, and their actions and contributions directly impact the team’s performance and outcomes.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nMembers may have different roles and responsibilities, but these roles may not be specifically defined or coordinated. Members have clearly defined roles and responsibilities that are coordinated to ensure effective collaboration and goal attainment.\n\nCommunication and Collaboration\n\nCommunication and collaboration among members may vary and may not be a primary focus. Communication and collaboration are essential within a team, with regular interactions, information sharing, and collective decision-making.\n\nAccountability\n\nIndividual members are primarily accountable for their actions and results. Team members hold each other accountable for the team’s performance and outcomes, fostering a sense of collective responsibility.\n\nPerformance and Productivity\n\nGroup performance may be variable and dependent on individual efforts without a strong focus on overall productivity. Team performance is measured collectively, with a focus on achieving high levels of productivity and accomplishing shared goals.\n\nCohesion and Trust\n\nGroup cohesion and trust among members may vary and may not be a central aspect of group dynamics. Building cohesion and trust among team members is crucial to establish a positive team environment and enhancing collaboration.\n\nLeadership\n\nLeadership may not be formally assigned, and there may be no designated leader. A team typically has a designated leader who provides guidance, facilitates collaboration, and ensures effective team functioning."
