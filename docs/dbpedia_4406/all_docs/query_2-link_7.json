        "text": "When was the last time you worked as part of a team? Do you think every team you have been a part of follows a similar form? Indeed, there are various types of teams in today's modern business world. And a proper understanding of how different teams operate can benefit companies and organizations worldwide. Keep reading to learn more about the most common types of teams in an organization with examples and explanation of different types of team culture!\n\nGreat things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.\n\n- Steve Jobs 1\n\nTypes of Teams in Management\n\nPerhaps you are currently a part of a team. Whether it is a team at your university, a sports team in your local town, or a team working on your company's latest project, exploring different types of teams can help better understand your team's current type and characteristics. First, perhaps let's walk through a brief definition of a team.\n\nA team consists of individuals collaborating on specific tasks to achieve common goals and objectives.\n\nEveryone knows about the great importance and tremendous benefits of teamwork towards the success of any business, which ranges from better communication and united vision and mission to better cohesion and enhanced trust.\n\nEach individual has unique gifts, and talents and skills. When we bring them to the table and share them for a common purpose, it can give companies a real competitive advantage.\n\n- John J. Murphy 3\n\nAccordingly, not everyone knows how to work as a team. Thus, studying different types of teams, together with their unique characteristics and advantages and disadvantages, can assist individuals in improving their teamwork skills and understanding. So, how many types of teams are there nowadays?\n\nTypes of Teams in an Organization\n\nThere are various types of teams in an organization.\n\nYet, the five most popular types of teams in an organization include: problem-solving teams, self-managed teams, cross-functional teams, virtual teams, and the multiteam system (team of teams).2\n\nProblem-Solving Team\n\nOften, problem-solving teams are assembled temporarily. Usually, team members in problem-solving teams are gathered in case of a crisis or an unplanned matter at work. Thus, such teams try to address the issue and drive the organizations out of the ongoing crisis.\n\nA problem-solving team consists of 5-10 members from the same department. The team will have a number of weekly meetings to resolve specific business problems.\n\nIn fact, this type of team can alleviate possible risks associated with certain crises while developing thorough solutions that address multiple business segments.\n\nWhat are possible crises that concern problem-solving teams?\n\nProblem-solving teams can work to alleviate possible risks in crises such as the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, the currently increasing inflation rates across countries, and so on.\n\nSelf-Managed Work Team\n\nUnlike problem-solving teams, of which desirable outcomes focus on recommendations, self-managed work teams are more concerned about implementing and revising solutions.\n\nA self-managed work team consists of a small group of members who are fully responsible for delivering a product or a service through peer collaboration. In this type of team, a manager's guidance is often absent.\n\nNormally, around ten employees will take on supervisory responsibilities while performing interdependent tasks. Together, this type of team unites for long-term purposes.\n\nWhat are the responsibilities of a self-managed work team?\n\nIn this team, members often perform tasks ranging from work scheduling and operational planning to working with customers and assisting operational decision-making processes.\n\nCross-Functional Team\n\nNowadays, more and more organizations have embraced the use of cross-functional teams in their operations.\n\nA cross-functional team consists of members on the same hierarchical level but from various departments within an organization.\n\nDespite its growing importance, about 75 percent of global cross-functional teams face dysfunctional challenges.4 To illustrate, while cross-functional teams gather people from different areas of expertise to coordinate complex projects, such teams are tough to manage due to leadership ambiguity. Further, such diversity in team members also entails a high risk of workplace conflicts.\n\nWhat are the advantages of cross-functional teams?\n\nCross-functional teams entail various benefits for companies, among which the following three advantages are most prominent:\n\nCross-functional teams accelerate task completion.\n\nWith their skillful and diverse members, cross-functional teams can tackle various projects at hand.\n\nCross-functional teams are dynamic and creative in producing innovative ideas.\n\nVirtual Team\n\nVirtual teams have recently arisen as new global group dynamic trends. Also known as geographically dispersed or remote teams, virtual teams imply people working together without being physically present.\n\nA virtual team relies on digital technology to unite virtual members to work towards common goals.\n\nAccordingly, virtual teams' most significant advantage is that they can stay connected and informed anywhere and at any time, regardless of their physical locations.\n\n70 percent of professionals work remotely in some capacity at least once a week, with 53% doing so for half the week.\n\n- Ariel Lopez 5\n\nMore interestingly, virtual teams are often more engaged than physical ones.5 The reason is that working in the same office can decrease team satisfaction when individuals fear or worry about their leaders. Thus, the physical absence of leaders in virtual teams encourages members to connect more.\n\nMultiteam System\n\nIf you are wondering about a team that can unite different departments within your organization, not just the individuals, perhaps a multiteam system is ideal for you.\n\nA multiteam system is a team that consists of different teams working together to realize overarching goals.\n\nThe multiteam system is quite a new concept for organizations worldwide. While a multiteam system is larger than a team, it is still smaller than an organization. Organizations often need to form multiteam systems to resolve highly complex tasks requiring higher coordination and expertise.\n\nThe role of leadership in a multiteam system\n\nWhen it comes to a multiteam system, leadership is extremely challenging. Researchers have highlighted the importance of functional leadership theory in conceptualizing an appropriate role for team leaders in a multiteam system. Accordingly, this theory centers on the ability of leaders to build and maintain relationships on a broad level. Thus, leaders under this theory take the core responsibility \"to do, or get done, whatever is not being adequately handled for group needs.\" 8\n\nExamples of Teams Types\n\nWhat do different types of teams look like in real-life contexts? Let's then go through some real-life examples of the different types of teams.\n\nTable 1 - Types of Teams and Examples\n\nCommon Types of Formal Teams\n\nBesides common types of teams divided based on their functions and scale, teams in organizations can also be classified into two types of teams: formal and informal. However, within professional business contexts, formal types of teams are of greater importance within professional business contexts.\n\nA formal team is a group of individuals formed by the management team in an organizational structure to accomplish specific tasks and goals.6\n\nIn this explanation, we will introduce to you some popular types of formal teams at work:\n\nTable 2 - Common Types of Formal Teams\n\nTypes of Team Culture\n\nWhen it comes to group dynamics, there are also various types of team cultures that shape the unique characteristics and spirits of teams. Within business contexts, types of team culture are mainly defined by the extent to which leaders and team members value productivity, people, and relationships at work.\n\nIn general, there are six different types of team culture, which are most popular in workplaces.\n\nTable 3 - Types of Team Culture\n\nIndeed, people make regular use of team concepts and group dynamics in their daily life. Thus, a proper understanding of different types of teams can make the procedure of team development more approachable and comfortable.\n\nIf everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.\n\n- Henry Ford 7\n\nTypes of Teams - Key takeaways\n\nA team consists of individuals collaborating on specific tasks to achieve common goals and objectives.\n\nThe five most popular types of teams in an organization include problem-solving teams, self-managed work teams, cross-functional teams, virtual teams, and multiteam systems.\n\nA formal team is a group of individuals formed by the management team in an organizational structure to accomplish specific tasks and goals.\n\nThere are six popular types of team culture at work: corrosive culture, country club culture, comfortable culture, competitive culture, cut-throat culture, and championship culture.\n\nReferences\n\nSean Peek.
