Charles E. Seastrunk, Jr., as follows:\n\nOur thought for today is from Isaiah 30:18: \"For the Lord is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for Him.\"\n\nLet us pray. Mighty Lord, gracious Father, give these Representatives the spirit of perseverance as they make decisions for the good of our people. Inspire them to use their abilities and the blessings You have given to them. Keep each one safe as they travel and provide for them every needful thing. Bless our Nation, President, State, Governor, Speaker, staff, and all who work in support of this House. Protect our defenders of freedom at home and abroad as they protect us. Heal the wounds, those seen and those hidden, of those who suffer and sacrifice for our freedom. Lord of mercy, hear our prayers. Amen.\n\nPursuant to Rule 6.3, the House of Representatives was led in the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America by the SPEAKER.\n\nAfter corrections to the Journal of the proceedings of yesterday, the SPEAKER ordered it confirmed.\n\nMOTION ADOPTED\n\nRep. ERICKSON moved that when the House adjourns, it adjourn in memory of Mikel Swinton, which was agreed to.\n\nSILENT PRAYER\n\nThe House stood in silent prayer for officer Timothy Swinton of Lamar.\n\nSILENT PRAYER\n\nThe House stood in silent prayer for former Representative Roland Smith.\n\nREPORT RECEIVED\n\nThe following was received:\n\nJudicial Merit Selection Commission\n\nReport of Candidate Qualifications\n\nfor Spring 2016\n\nDate Draft Report Issued: Thursday, May 5, 2016\n\nDate and Time Final Report Issued: Noon, Wednesday, May 11, 2016\n\nJudicial candidates are not free to seek or accept commitments until Wednesday, May 11, 2016, at Noon.\n\nJudicial Merit Selection Commission\n\nMay 5, 2016\n\nDear Members of the General Assembly:\n\nEnclosed is the Judicial Merit Selection Commission's Report of Candidate Qualifications. This Report is designed to assist you in determining how to cast your vote. The Commission is charged by law with ascertaining whether judicial candidates are qualified for service on the bench. In accordance with this mandate, the Commission has thoroughly investigated all judicial candidates for their suitability for judicial service. The Commission found all candidates discussed in this Report to be qualified.\n\nThe Commission's finding that a candidate is qualified means that the candidate satisfies both the constitutional criteria for judicial office and the Commission's evaluative criteria. The attached Report details each candidate's qualifications as they relate to the Commission's evaluative criteria.\n\nJudicial candidates are prohibited from asking for your commitment until 12:00 Noon on Wednesday, May 11, 2016. Further, members of the General Assembly are not permitted to issue letters of introduction, announcements of candidacy, statements detailing a candidate's qualifications, or commitments to vote for a candidate until 12:00 Noon on Wednesday, May 11, 2016. In summary, no member of the General Assembly should, orally or in writing, communicate about a candidate's candidacy until this designated time after release of the Judicial Merit Selection Commission's Report of Candidate Qualifications. If you find a candidate violating the pledging prohibitions or if you have questions about this report, please contact Elizabeth H. Brogdon, Chief Counsel to the Commission, at (803) 212-6629.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSen. Larry A. Martin\n\nJudicial Merit Selection Commission\n\nMay 5, 2016\n\nDear Fellow Members of the General Assembly:\n\nThis letter is written to call your attention to issues raised during the December 2003 Judicial Merit Selection hearings concerning a judicial candidate's contact with members of the General Assembly, as well as third parties contacting members on a candidate's behalf. It is also to remind you of these issues for the Spring 2016 screening.\n\nSection 2-19-70(C) of the South Carolina Code contains strict prohibitions concerning candidates seeking or legislators giving their pledges of support or implied endorsement through an introduction prior to 48 hours after the release of the final report of the Judicial Merit Selection Commission (\"Commission\"). The purpose of this section was to ensure that members of the General Assembly had full access to the report prior to being asked by a candidate to pledge his or her support. The final sentence of Section 2-19-70(C) provides that \"the prohibitions of this section do not extend to an announcement of candidacy by the candidate and statements by the candidate detailing the candidate's qualifications\" (emphasis added). Candidates may not, however, contact members of the Commission regarding their candidacy. Please note that six members of the Commission are also legislators.\n\nIn April 2000, the Commission determined that Section 2-19-70(C) means no member of the General Assembly should engage in any form of communication, written or verbal, concerning a judicial candidate before the 48-hour period expires following the release of the Commission's report. The Commission would like to clarify and reiterate that until at least 48 hours have expired after the Commission has released its final report of candidate qualifications to the General Assembly, only candidates, and not members of the General Assembly, are permitted to issue letters of introduction, announcements of candidacy, or statements detailing the candidates' qualifications.\n\nThe Commission would again like to remind members of the General Assembly that a violation of the screening law is likely a disqualifying offense and must be considered when determining a candidate's fitness for judicial office. Further, the law requires the Commission to report any violations of the pledging rules by members of the General Assembly to the House or Senate Ethics Committee, as may be applicable.\n\nShould you have any questions regarding this letter or any other matter pertaining to the judicial screening process, please do not hesitate to call Elizabeth H. Brogdon, Chief Counsel to the Commission, at (803) 212-6629.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSenator Larry A. Martin Representative Bruce W. Bannister\n\nChairman Vice-Chairman\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Judicial Merit Selection Commission is charged by law to consider the qualifications of candidates for the judiciary. This report details the reasons for the Commission's findings, as well as each candidate's qualifications as they relate to the Commission's evaluative criteria. The Commission operates under the law that went into effect on July 1, 1997, and which dramatically changed the powers and duties of the Commission. One component of this law is that the Commission's finding of \"qualified\" or \"not qualified\" is binding on the General Assembly. The Commission is also cognizant of the need for members of the General Assembly to be able to differentiate between candidates and, therefore, has attempted to provide as detailed a report as possible.\n\nThe Judicial Merit Selection Commission is composed of ten members, four of whom are non-legislators. The Commission has continued the more in-depth screening format started in 1997. The Commission has asked candidates their views on issues peculiar to service on the court to which they seek election. These questions were posed in an effort to provide members of the General Assembly with more information about candidates and the candidates' thought processes on issues relevant to their candidacies. The Commission has also engaged in a more probing inquiry into the depth of a candidate's experience in areas of practice that are germane to the office he or she is seeking. The Commission feels that candidates should have familiarity with the subject matter of the courts for which they offer, and feels that candidates' responses should indicate their familiarity with most major areas of the law with which they will be confronted.\n\nThe Commission also used the Citizens Committees on Judicial Qualifications as an adjunct of the Commission. Since the decisions of our judiciary play such an important role in people's personal and professional lives, the Commission believes that all South Carolinians should have a voice in the selection of the state's judges. It was this desire for broad-based grassroots participation that led the Commission to create the Citizens Committees on Judicial Qualifications. These committees are composed of individuals who are both racially and gender diverse, and who also have a broad range of professional experiences (i.e., lawyers, teachers, businessmen, bankers, and advocates for various organizations). The committees were asked to advise the Commission on the judicial candidates in their regions. Each regional committee interviewed the candidates from its assigned area and also interviewed other individuals in that region who were familiar with the candidate either personally or professionally. Based on those interviews and its own investigation, each committee provided the Commission with a report on their assigned candidates based on the Commission's evaluative criteria. The Commission then used these reports as a tool for further investigation of the candidate if the committee's report so warranted. Summaries of these reports have also been included in the Commission's report for your review.\n\nThe Commission conducts a thorough investigation of each candidate's professional, personal, and financial affairs, and holds public hearings during which each candidate is questioned on a wide variety of issues. The Commission's investigation focuses on the following evaluative criteria: constitutional qualifications, ethical fitness, professional and academic ability, character, reputation, physical health, mental health, and judicial temperament. The Commission's investigation includes the following:\n\n(1) survey of the bench and bar through BallotBox online;\n\n(2) SLED and FBI investigation;\n\n(3) credit investigation;\n\n(4) grievance investigation;\n\n(5) study of application materials;\n\n(6) verification of ethics compliance;\n\n(7) search of newspaper articles;\n\n(8) conflict of interest investigation;\n\n(9) court schedule study;\n\n(10) study of appellate record;\n\n(11) court observation; and\n\n(12) investigation of complaints.\n\nWhile the law provides that the Commission must make findings as to qualifications, the Commission views its role as also including an obligation to consider candidates in the context of the judiciary on which they would serve and, to some degree, govern. To that end, the Commission inquires as to the quality of justice delivered in the courtrooms of South Carolina and seeks to impart, through its questioning, the view of the public as to matters of legal knowledge and ability, judicial temperament, and the absoluteness of the Judicial Canons of Conduct as to recusal for conflict of interest, prohibition of ex parte communication, and the disallowance of the acceptance of gifts. However, the Commission is not a forum for reviewing the individual decisions of the state's judicial system absent credible allegations of a candidate's violations of the Judicial Canons of Conduct, the Rules of Professional Conduct, or any of the Commission's nine evaluative criteria that would impact a candidate's fitness for judicial service.\n\nThe Commission expects each candidate to possess a basic level of legal knowledge and ability, to have experience that would be applicable to the office sought, and to exhibit a strong adherence to codes of ethical behavior. These expectations are all important, and excellence in one category does not make up for deficiencies in another.\n\nRoutine questions related to compliance with ethical Canons governing ethics and financial interests are now administered through a written questionnaire mailed to candidates and completed by them in advance of each candidate's staff interview. These issues are no longer automatically made a part of the public hearing process unless a concern or question was raised during the investigation of the candidate. The necessary public record of a candidate's pledge to uphold the Canons is his or her completed and sworn questionnaire.\n\nWritten examinations of the candidates' knowledge of judicial practice and procedure were given at the time of candidate interviews with staff and graded on a \"blind\" basis by a panel of four persons designated by the Chairman. In assessing each candidate's performance on these practice and procedure questions, the Commission has placed candidates in either the \"failed to meet expectations\" or \"met expectations\" category. The Commission feels that these categories should accurately impart the candidate's performance on the practice and procedure questions.\n\nThis report is the culmination of lengthy, detailed investigatory work and public hearings. The Commission takes its responsibilities seriously, believing that the quality of justice delivered in South Carolina's courtrooms is directly affected by the thoroughness of its screening process. Please carefully consider the contents of this report, which we believe will help you make a more informed decision. Please note that the candidates' responses included herein are restated verbatim from the documents that the candidates submitted as part of their application to the Judicial Merit Selection Commission. All candidates were informed that the Commission does not revise or alter the candidates' submissions, and thus, any errors or omissions in the information contained in this draft report existed in the original documents that the candidate(s) submitted to the Commission.\n\nThis report conveys the Commission's findings as to the qualifications of all candidates currently offering for election to the South Carolina Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Circuit Court and Family Court, and Administrative Law Court.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nQUALIFIED AND NOMINATED\n\nThe Honorable Donald Wayne Beatty\n\nSupreme Court, Chief Justice\n\nCommission's Findings: QUALIFIED AND NOMINATED\n\n(1) Constitutional Qualifications:\n\nBased on the Commission's investigation, Justice Beatty meets the qualifications prescribed by law for judicial service as Chief Justice on the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Beatty was born in 1952.

The Court of Appeals hears most appeals from the Circuit Court and the Family Court except when the appeal has been certified for determination by the Supreme Court or if the appeal falls within any of the seven classes directly appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n(c) May 1995 to April 2003, I served on the South Carolina Seventh Judicial Circuit Court after being elected by the South Carolina General Assembly. The Circuit Court is the State's court of general jurisdiction. As a circuit court judge, I presided over cases in civil court and criminal court. The Circuit Court also has limited appellate jurisdiction over appeals from the Probate Court, Magistrate's Court, and Municipal Court.\n\nJustice Beatty provided the following list of his most significant orders or opinions:\n\n(a) McHam v.

Unlike the majority of the Commission, I am concerned that, in response to legitimate questioning regarding Justice Beatty's comments at a solicitor's conference, he became combative when questioned about his remarks at the conference. While I certainly understand a person's natural reflex to be defensive when one's actions are questioned, Justice Beatty needs to understand that he is not just a person and the office to which he aspires is not just a job. The office of Chief Justice is the pinnacle of the judicial branch of government in South Carolina, and as such, he or she is the example of that branch to both those who practice in our courts and those who appear therein. Screening of judicial candidates is not an adversarial process, but one before the legislative branch on behalf of the general public. We are tasked by the Constitution to inquire on behalf of those we represent as to whether a candidate has, among other criteria, the requisite temperament to be entrusted with the power to pass judgment on his or her fellow citizens fairly and calmly. For me, Justice Beatty's temperament was called into question based on his combative nature during his hearing. I am concerned that during his screening for the Chief Justice seat, Justice Beatty knew his temperament was a criteria that would be evaluated, and yet, he still exercised poor self-control. I do note that given time to reflect, Justice Beatty apologized. Given Justice Beatty's apology during the hearing, I am hopeful that he understands the need for the leader of the court system to set the tone regarding judicial temperament, and that going forward, he will concentrate his efforts on serving as the appropriate role model for his fellow judges in this state.\"\n\n(12) Conclusion:\n\nThe Commission found Justice Beatty qualified and nominated him for election to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Honorable John Cannon Few\n\nSupreme Court, Seat 2\n\nCommission's Findings: QUALIFIED AND NOMINATED\n\n(1) Constitutional Qualifications:\n\nBased on the Commission's investigation, Justice Few meets the qualifications prescribed by law for judicial service as a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nJustice Few was born in 1963. He is 53 years old and a resident of Greenville, South Carolina. Justice Few provided in his application that he has been a resident of South Carolina for at least the immediate past five years and has been a licensed attorney in South Carolina since 1988.\n\n(2) Ethical Fitness:\n\nThe Commission's investigation did not reveal any evidence of unethical conduct by Justice Few.\n\nJustice Few demonstrated an understanding of the Canons of Judicial Conduct and other ethical considerations important to judges, particularly in the areas of ex parte communications, acceptance of gifts and ordinary hospitality, and recusal.\n\nJustice Few reported that he has not made any campaign expenditures.\n\nJustice Few testified he has not:\n\n(a) sought or received the pledge of any legislator prior to screening;\n\n(b) sought or been offered a conditional pledge of support by a legislator;\n\n(c) asked third persons to contact members of the General Assembly prior to screening.\n\nJustice Few testified that he is aware of the Commission's 48-hour rule regarding the formal and informal release of the Screening Report.\n\n(3) Professional and Academic Ability:\n\nThe Commission found Justice Few to be intelligent and knowledgeable.

The Commission's investigation of Justice Few did not indicate any evidence of a troubled financial status. Justice Few has handled his financial affairs responsibly.\n\nThe Commission also noted that Justice Few was punctual and attentive in his dealings with the Commission, and the Commission's investigation did not reveal any problems with his diligence and industry.\n\n(5) Reputation:\n\nJustice Few reported that his last available rating by a legal rating organization, Martindale-Hubbell, was AV.\n\n(6) Physical Health:\n\nJustice Few appears to be physically capable of performing the duties of the office he seeks.\n\n(7) Mental Stability:\n\nJustice Few appears to be mentally capable of performing the duties of the office he seeks.\n\n(8) Experience:\n\nJustice Few was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1988.\n\nHe gave the following account of his legal experience since graduation from law school\n\n1989-1997 Private Civil Practice with J. Kendall Few\n\n1997-2000 Private Civil Practice by myself\n\n2000-2010 Circuit Court Judge\n\n2010-2016 Chief Judge, SC Court of Appeals\n\n2016-Present Justice, Supreme Court of South Carolina\n\nJustice Few reported the frequency of his court appearances prior to his service on the bench as follows:\n\nn/a\n\nJustice Few reported the percentage of his practice involving civil, criminal, and domestic matters prior to his service on the bench as follows:\n\nn/a\n\nJustice Few reported the percentage of his practice in trial court prior to his service on the bench as follows:\n\nn/a\n\nJustice Few reported that he has held the following judicial office(s):\n\nYes. I served as a Circuit Judge from July 1, 2000 to February 3, 2010. I served as the Chief Judge of the South Carolina Court of Appeals from February 3, 2010 until February 9, 2016. Since February 9, 2016, I have served as a Justice on the Supreme Court of South Carolina.\n\nJustice Few provided the following list of his most significant orders or opinions:\n\nI published over 100 opinions at the Court of Appeals and wrote or joined over a thousand others. Each one is equally significant in that it decides an important issue in the lives of South Carolina citizens. I have not yet published any opinions at the Supreme Court. Here are five opinions from the Court of Appeals I deem the most significant for their precedential value:\n\nStoneledge at Lake Keowee Owners' Assn., Inc. v. Builders FirstSource-Se. Grp., 413 S.C. 630, 776 S.E.2d 434 (Ct. App. 2015); and Stoneledge at Lake Keowee Owners' Ass'n, Inc. v. Clear View Const., LLC, 413 S.C. 615, 776 S.E.2d 426 (Ct. App. 2015). These companion cases deal with equitable indemnity.\n\nState v. Gray, 408 S.C. 601, 759 S.E.2d 160 (Ct. App. 2014) and State v. Collins, 398 S.C. 197, 727 S.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 2012). I include these opinions together because their significance relates to the same issue--the admissibility of graphic autopsy photographs. A majority of the Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals' ruling in Collins, but the Supreme Court reversed the decision after finding the Circuit Court's error was harmless. See 409 S.C. 524, 763 S.E.2d 22 (2014). Gray was not appealed.\n\nPalms v. School District of Greenville County, 408 S.C. 576, 758 S.E.2d 919 (Ct. App. 2014). This opinion is significant because it addresses the limited role of the judiciary in the affairs of government.\n\nAnMed Health v. S.C. Department of Employment & Workforce, 404 S.C. 224, 743 S.E.2d 854 (Ct. App. 2013). This opinion is significant because it upholds the right of hospitals to make patient-safety decisions unencumbered by employment considerations, and yet also upholds a State agency's right and duty to follow its statutory mandate to provide unemployment benefits under law.\n\nState v. Dukes, 404 S.C. 553, 745 S.E.2d 137 (Ct. App. 2013).

I am simply a contact person for Duke alumni who live in this area, and from time to time I schedule events for Duke alumni in our area.\n\n(11) Commission Members' Comments:\n\nThe Commission appreciates Justice Few's service on the Supreme Court and knows that he will continue to serve the state's judiciary well.\n\n(12) Conclusion:\n\nThe Commission found Justice Few qualified and nominated him for re-election to the Supreme Court.\n\nCOURT OF APPEALS\n\nQUALIFIED AND NOMINATED\n\nThe Honorable James Edward Lockemy\n\nCourt of Appeals, Chief Judge, Seat 5\n\nCommission's Findings: QUALIFIED AND NOMINATED\n\n(1) Constitutional Qualifications:\n\nBased on the Commission's investigation, Judge Lockemy meets the qualifications prescribed by law for judicial service as a Court of Appeals judge.\n\nJudge Lockemy was born in 1949.

State v. James Cain (1980s)---Mr. Cain was a known criminal in Dillon County with almost all of his offenses involving some sort of theft or fights with others. In this case he was charged with the break-in and theft of a storage building as well as the attempted break-in of a vehicle. I was appointed as his attorney. We negotiated a plea that would result in probation in return for a guilty plea. The inexpensive items in the storage building had been recovered and there was only minor damage to the vehicle which an insurance company had covered after receiving the police report. Surprisingly, Mr. Cain refused to accept the offer because he would not admit to the attempted break-in of the vehicle. He stated that although they arrested him at the trunk of the vehicle where the scratches were, he was only there hiding from the police, not attempting to break-in to the vehicle and that the damage on the vehicle was already there. I explained to him that if convicted he would receive a substantial number of years in prison and that conviction was likely since he was admittedly guilty of the break-in of the storage building. He stated that although he was a thief, he was not a liar and would not lie to the court and had faith in the jury.\n\nWe tried the case. He admitted on the stand his guilt to the storage building crime but denied the car entry attempt. During the course of the case, we were able to enter evidence that the damage to the car was very old. I cross examined the purported victim and Mr. Cain testified. The jury acquitted him on the charge. The judge acknowledged that he had admitted his guilt to the other charge and expressed his admiration for the determination and truthfulness of Mr. Cain while facing a difficult situation. He sentenced him to very minimal probation. TO my knowledge, Mr. Cain changed his criminal activity after that experience. As a lawyer, my faith in our judicial system grew both for the jury and the judge roles in that system. The impression has never left me during my years as a trial judge and as an appellate judge. It also made me aware not to treat cases too hastily because we are dealing with individuals and every aspect of their case is important to them even though we may want to just get a case completed and off of a docket.\n\n2. Bethea v. a young Vietnam wife----since this case occurred over 25 years ago, I cannot find the specifics with name and date of case. It was a family court case involving child custody. I represented the Vietnam lady who was married to an American who had been assigned to her country during the war. Their marriage was breaking up and they had one small child that had been living with her for a long time while they were separated. The husband brought the action. She did not contest the action and did not ask for any property or alimony or even child support. All that she requested was custody of her young child. This was a hotly contested matter because it was clear that the family of the husband wanted the child maybe more than the father did. Moreover, they did not want the child to reside with a Vietnamese. In the end, the court granted my client custody although it was the unpopular thing to do in this rural county. In addition, my representation of the lady brought threats to me and promises of defeating me the next time I ran for reelection to the State House of Representatives. The results of this case though solidified my drive to do what is right under the law and to not let the personal consequences sway my pursuit of justice. In addition, I really appreciated the role of a judge to do justice in the face of clear popular protest against his actions. He also lived in that community. To this day, his example still lingers in my mind as I approach matters that may not be popular but are necessary to uphold justice.\n\n3. Turner v. United States---once again this case was over 25 years ago and I cannot find the specifics or a case number. It was a case involving Social Security. My client had been on disability for over a decade due to an accident while working for the Highway Department when a vehicle crashed into the trailer in which he was riding picking up orange cones from a road under repair. He had been in his early 40s at the time of the accident and very vibrant and active. The accident disabled him substantially. Although he regained the ability to walk eventually, his body was torn up badly inside. He could not control bodily functions and had no teeth. He weighed only around 100 pounds at the time I began to represent him. The Social Security Administration had begun reviewing cases and for some reason terminated his benefits. Without these benefits he had no source of income and could not work with his limited physical ability. In addition by this time he was in his middle 50s and could not read or write.\n\nWhen he came to see me, he was living in a car and taking handouts from family and friends. In fact, it was his family that asked me to help him because of their concern for his welfare. He was despondent and thought there was nothing he could do. We filed again to reinstate his disability but it was denied. We asked and received a hearing. I did the best I could do at the hearing and thought with the evidence presented and his personal appearance, he would certainly be reinstated. Surprisingly, we lost. By this time, he had been without benefits for over a year and I was fearful for his life. I was not familiar about the process to appeal a Social Security judge's decision and he told me to forget about it. I almost did but on the last day, I contacted a friend of mine who was familiar with the filing procedure and asked him to do it. This hero promptly filed the documents that day and we beat the deadline by a few minutes. Eventually, the federal court granted our petition and the case was won. Mr. Turner received a great deal of money in back benefits and although he has since passed away, he was able to live his last days in dignity and some comfort. This case taught me that even when your client wants to give up, you need to continue to encourage his/her pursuit for justice. This especially true where he has been so deprived of what is deserved. In addition, I appreciate fellow members of the bar that are willing to help on a moments notice when they realize that someone is in need of assistance. This hero had no idea he would ever receive compensation but knew the action he was doing was necessary in the interest of justice. Today, that hero is also a colleague of mind on the Court of Appeals and I am still impressed with Paul Short's pursuit of justice.\n\nAppellate Court:\n\n4. Ammons v. Hood, 288 S.C. 278 (1986)---This case involved a person who had lost their job and was due back wages. We received a judgment at the trial level and the defendant appealed. At the Court of Appeals, we succeeded in the action. The business was insolvent and the judgment was not very large. We still pursued collection efforts for a long time. The defendant's business was well connected to a lot of important people and my efforts did meet with some disfavor. In the end, we were never able to collect anything of substantial value. I felt that I had not provided any benefit to my client and yet endured criticism from former friends. At my lowest point of defeat, however, my client came to see me. He stated that he never thought he would ever get someone to represent him on the case due to the popularity of the business he sued. Although, all our efforts were unsuccessful, he wanted me to know how much he appreciated me and his renewed faith in the honesty of the legal profession. He stated his experience and to see the hard pursuit of his case was worth more than the money he sought. My spirits and determination to be a good lawyer and steward of justice rose from despair. It is with me today.\n\n5. Mohasco Corporation v. Rising, 289 S.C. 130 (1986)----This case involved to elderly ladies who had spent their life working at a factory. When they became disabled, they were denied workmen compensation. I was asked by their family to assist them as they had given up. I took the case and won at the single commissioner level. It was appealed to the full commission. I brought more experienced counsel, Kenneth Suggs, and we went to the full commission hearing. I argued a portion of the case. We won at the full commission level. This was the first case of brown/black lung in South Carolina. The company appealed to the Court of Appeals. We were reversed there. We then went on the state Supreme Court. For some reason, my name was left off of the case at the Supreme Court. We won at the Supreme Court and the ladies finally received their much deserved compensation. They have now passed away but their families still remind me of the happiness of these two ladies who were finally recognized for the injury they received while working hard for their employers for over 20 years.\n\nThe following is Judge Lockemy's account of two civil appeals he has personally handled:\n\nSee Ammons and Mohasco above.\n\nJudge Lockemy reported he has not personally handled any criminal appeals.\n\nJudge Lockemy reported that he has held the following judicial offices:\n\n(a) South Carolina Circuit Court, 1989 - 2008, elected by the General Assembly.\n\n(b) South Carolina Court of Appeals, 2009 - present, elected by the General Assembly.\n\nJudge Lockemy provided the following list of his most significant orders or opinions:\n\n(a) State v.

App. 2010).\n\n(e) State v. Hinson. I was involved as the trial judge in this case from 2007. In Hinson, the defendant was charged with kidnapping two teenaged girls, keeping them in a dungeon, and raping them. The jury found the State had not proven guilt by a reasonable doubt and acquitted the defendant. This case received national news coverage.\n\nJudge Lockemy reported the following regarding his employment while serving as a judge:\n\n(a) Adjunct Professor of American History and American Government, Horry-Georgetown Technical College, 2012 - present.\n\n(b) South Carolina National Guard, 1978 - 2004.\n\n(c) South Carolina Military Department, Commander of Joint Services Detachment, volunteer, 2005 - present.

Sharing with these amazing individuals illuminated a perspective of life that has been invaluable to me. In addition, the long periods between customers gave me an opportunity and desire to read book after book which led to my interest in history and the law. From these readings, I formed an appreciation of our country as well as the importance of justice and the rule of law in a democratic-republic such as ours. With this background, I have served my country, my state, and the interest of justice to the best of my ability.\n\n(11) Commission Members' Comments:\n\nJudge Lockemy is an asset to the South Carolina judiciary as he is a well-qualified, well-respected member of the Court.\n\n(12) Conclusion:\n\nThe Commission found Judge Lockemy qualified and nominated him for re-election to the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Honorable Paula H.
