        "text": "Unable to restructure its heavy debt load and hampered by increasingly reluctant suppliers, Revco D.S. Inc., one of the nation's largest drugstore chains, filed today for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThe filing came just 19 months after the 2,000-store chain was taken private in a $1.3 billion leveraged buyout and about three months after it stopped making interest payments on the high-yield, or ''junk bond,'' debt used to finance the buyout. Today's filing makes Revco the largest leveraged buyout to fail financially.\n\nIn a leveraged buyout, the management of a company borrows heavily to buy back its public shares, thus placing an extra debt burden on the company. A Growing Number of Buyouts\n\nThe buyout technique has been used aggressively in recent years as increasing numbers of leveraged buyout funds have formed to provide financing for the deals. In most cases, management of the company and the buyout-fund investors are able to take over the company by putting up only 10 percent or so of the purchase price as permanent equity capital.\n\nAnalysts said the Revco bankruptcy filing had been anticipated on Wall Street after news spread of a breakdown in the company's negotiations with the holders of its junk bonds. The bankruptcy of Revco is likely to produce jitters among other holders of high-risk bonds from buyouts in which the companies have heavy debt loads and weak or nonexistent earnings.\n\nBoake A. Sells, Revco's chairman, said the filing was essential to keep the stores operating. He also said that the best solution to Revco's problems was to contine to operate, rather than sell stores or other assets.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
