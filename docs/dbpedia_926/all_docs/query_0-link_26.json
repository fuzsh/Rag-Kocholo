        "text": "December 17, 2022\n\nBringing our heart to every moment of your health™.\n\nIn 1964, there were just 17 CVS retail stores in the United States, a far cry from today’s 9,633 retail locations. By 1969, there were 40 CVS stores. In that same year, CVS was acquired by the now-defunct Melville Corporation, boosting its growth.\n\nBy 1970, CVS operated 100 stores in New England and the Northeast.\n\nIn early 1972, being environmentally conscientious, CVS introduced America’s first refillable plastic bottle with its CVS private-label shampoo. It was a great deal for customers, CVS, and the environment! Customers paid 79¢ for a bottle of CVS private-label shampoo and when they returned the empty bottle and cap, could buy another bottle of the same shampoo for 69¢ (a 10¢ saving). So, why isn’t the whole world doing this, you ask?\n\nThe chain had more than 400 stores by 1981 and by 1985, sales reached $1 billion.\n\nIn 1990 CVS expanded into the mid-Atlantic markets when it acquired the 490-store Peoples Drug chain from Imasco.\n\nIn 1997, CVS nearly tripled its 1,400 stores after purchasing the 2,500-store Revco chain. Also in that year, CVS participated in a program in an initiative to reduce the pollution of Maine’s waterways by agreeing to accept drugs for disposal so that people would not discard of them in ways that would reach rivers and other bodies of water.\n\nCVS was definitely a rising star in the pharmacy business. As of December 2009, CVS Caremark had over 7,000 locations.\n\nOn September 3, 2014, CVS Caremark changed its name to CVS Health and announced that it would stop selling tobacco products.\n\nIn 2015, CVS Health acquired Target Corporation’s pharmacy and retail clinic businesses which included 1,660 pharmacies in 47 states.\n\nWith approval from the United States Department of Justice in 2018, CVS acquired Aetna, for $69 billion.\n\nCVS Health’s net worth as of December 06, 2022, is $132.96B."
