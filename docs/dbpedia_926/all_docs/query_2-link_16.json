        "text": "Two broad steps were taken yesterday to clean up the tattered trail left in the botched 1986 leveraged buyout of Revco D.S. The Rite Aid Corporation, a competing drugstore chain, offered to buy the bankrupt Revco, even as the architect of the buyout, Salomon Brothers, agreed to pay $29.7 million to settle a lawsuit from some of the investors in it.\n\nThe offer by Rite Aid, the nation's largest drugstore chain, intensifies a battle for control of Revco that has been waged since the Ohio-based drugstore chain filed for bankruptcy in 1988.\n\nUnder the Rite Aid plan, about $440 million in cash would be paid to Revco's senior creditors. In addition, the company would assume certain liabilities and distribute seven million shares of Rite Aid common stock to most of the junior creditors to settle other claims against Revco.\n\nThe plan, which was put together by Rite Aid and five holders of Revco securities, is the only one submitted to the bankruptcy court that provides for payment of cash and publicly traded securities to settle claims by Revco's creditors.\n\nIf accepted, the deal would greatly expand Rite Aid, which is based in Shiremanstown, Pa. The company operates 2,439 drugstores. Revco, which operated more than 2,000 drugstores in 30 states in 1986, has sold many of them during bankruptcy, and now owns 1,100 stores with about $2.5 billion in annual revenues.\n\n\"We think now is the best of times to come into this process, because all of the other plans that have been produced didn't have any cash or had very little cash,\" said Martin Grass, president of Rite Aid. \"We are hopeful that other creditors will be joining us over the next few weeks.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
