        "text": "Eckerd Corp. may continue operating its 113 drugstores in Virginia despite a tumultuous debut in the Hampton Roads, Richmond and Charlottesville areas two months ago, state regulators decided Tuesday.\n\nBut the Clearwater.-based chain will remain on probation for one year and must pay as much as $537,000 for fumbling its takeover of the stores from CVS Corp., which sold the former Revco stores to satisfy federal antitrust concerns over its takeover of Revco D.S. Inc.\n\nThe fine will be reduced if Eckerd meets a Sept. 18 deadline to install a computerized prescription data base. The absence of such a data base in Eckerd's first weeks in Virginia was responsible for numerous prescription errors and delays as well as a generally chaotic atmosphere at many Eckerd pharmacies, the Virginia Board of Pharmacy said.\n\nEckerd also must submit to 20 spot inspections over the next year _ and pay for them, at $400 apiece.\n\nBoard members offered no comment about their decision Tuesday, but Eckerd vice president Robert W. Hannan said he was grateful to be able to continue doing business in Virginia and for the chance to earn a new reputation there.\n\n\"We are very interested in being a major player in the Virginia market,\" Hannan said, adding that Eckerd now has stores in 25 states. \"We would have liked to have started differently, but this is behind us now.\"\n\nThe pharmacy board began investigating Eckerd's business practices almost immediately after its arrival in Virginia in June, when the first complaints from customers and pharmacists began filtering in.\n\nAt the root of the problem, Eckerd officials have said, is that CVS gave Eckerd only four months of prescription records _ instead of the required two years' worth _ and did so on microfiche rather than computer. Pharmacists had to pore through the cumbersome records to find refill information; the result, Eckerd officials said, was a tremendous backlog of work and a harried work environment that led to mistakes.\n\nCVS may be held accountable for the poor transition, too. Officials from that company, the nation's largest drugstore chain, will appear before a committee of the pharmacy board next month to explain why it did not give Eckerd the required records."
