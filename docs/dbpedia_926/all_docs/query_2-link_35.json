Hook purchased the “Deutsche Apotheke” at 1101 South East Street from Louis Mattill in October 1900, according to the Indiana Tribüne, Indianapolis city directories, a history of Hook Drugs from the Indianapolis Recorder,and a historic marker installed on the site in 1975. City directories also refer to the business simply by Hook’s name until 1919, when it is referred to as “Hook Drug Company.” The South East Street location was maintained by Hook until 1919, when James L. Simmons, an employee of Hook’s, assumed ownership. Simmons stayed at this location until 1941, when the building was torn down to make way for the widening of East Street. He relocated his store to 1026 South East Street until 1968, when it too was subject to demolition to provide space for the inner loop expressway, the Indianapolis Star reported. Baist maps and aerial photographs also confirm the two demolitions.\n\nOn October 3, 1975, Mayor Richard Luger, Hook Drugs President Norman P. Reeves, August F. “Bud” Hook, and others unveiled a historical marker commemorating the site of the original Hook’s pharmacy at 1101 South East Street. The Indianapolis Star, the Indianapolis News,and photographs from the University of Indianapolis confirm this marker dedication.\n\n[2] “August Hook,” 1880 United States Federal Census, Ancestry.com; “August Hook,” 1900 United States Federal Census, Ancestry.com; “John Hook,” 1910 United States Federal Census, Ancestry.com; “John A.

Shankle, “Hook’s Drug Stores,” Encyclopedia of Indianapolis, indyencyclopedia.org.\n\nJohn August Hook was born on December 17, 1880, in Cincinnati, Ohio to August J. Hook and Margaret Hook. His parents were both German immigrants who came to the United States in 1869, according to Census records. His father was a beer brewer who started in Cincinnati before moving to Indianapolis by 1891.\n\nThe Indianapolis News noted John A. Hook’s graduation from the Cincinnati College of Pharmacy on June 9, 1900. He earned three medals for his academic work, including “a gold medal for highest general average, a gold medal for highest materia medica, and silver medal for chemistry.”\n\nAlso in 1900, Hook purchased a “Deutsche Apotheke” at 1101 South East Street from Louis Mattill, according to the Indiana Tribüne and Indianapolis city directories. Mattill had established his apothecary with his brother John as early as 1890, according to city directories; the business was listed as “Mattill Bros.” and the address was 581 S. East, which is how 1101 South East Street was previously labeled. By 1899, the brothers had split their business and Louis Mattill occupied 1101 South East Street. As the IUPUI Polis Center elaborated, the development of St. Paul’s Lutheran School in 1889 and Henry W. Longfellow School 28 shortly thereafter created the conditions for the expansion of the German immigrant community.\n\nHe died on February 7, 1943 at the age of 62 of pneumonia, according to his death certificate.\n\n[3] “Hook Drugs, Inc.,” Indianapolis Times, March 11, 1930, 13, Hoosier State Chronicles; “50 Stores Operated by Hook Drugs Inc.,” Indianapolis Star, January 5, 1958, Section 7, page 13, Newspapers.com; William A. Chambers, “Sidelights: Business, Industry, and Labor,” Indianapolis Recorder, July 2, 1960, 8, Hoosier State Chronicles; “A. F. (Bud) Hook,” Indianapolis Recorder, August 27, 1960, 8, Hoosier State Chronicles; “100-Unit Drug Chain Among Biggest in Nation,” Indianapolis Star, January 14, 1968, Section 8, Page 20; “New Hook’s Opens Today,” Nappanee Advance-News, January 25, 1973, 1, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hook’s Establishes Sales Record,” Nappanee Advance-News, November 6, 1975, 8, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Since October 31. . . ,” Jewish Post, January 16, 1976, 15, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hook’s ’77 Sales Top $168 Million,” Nappanee Advance-News, January 19, 1978, 3, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hook’s Earnings,” Vincennes Sun-Commercial, March 8, 1981, 7, Newspapers.com.\n\nSome of the company’s growth in the 1920s was documented in an investment advertisement in the Indianapolis Times. From 1924 to 1929, Hook Drugs, Inc. grew from 18 stores to 41 stores and their stock price nearly doubled, from $1.34 to $2.62 a share.\n\nThe figures from 1958 were from the Indianapolis Star. The article also noted that Hook Drug, Inc. had “an annual advertising budget of $325,000.” The growth during this company’s history was attributed to the leadership of A. F. (Bud) Hook, company president, and Edward J. F. Roesch, company vice president. As the Star wrote, “under the joint leadership of the two men the chain grew from an Indianapolis operation to a state-wide chain of stores.”\n\nThe 1958 Star article noted that the company hoped to have 75 stores by 1960. Unfortunately, it did not reach this number. A July 6, 1960 Indianapolis Recorder article noted that the firm’s plans for stores by the end of the 1960 only amounted to 64. Over a decade later, in 1973, the company boasted stores in “80 communities,” according to the Nappanee Advance-News.\n\nThis growth was not without its controversies. The employees of the Hook’s store in Marwood ran an ad in the Jewish Post on January 16, 1976, criticizing the company’s labor practices and its attempts to block unionization efforts. 150 salesclerks of Hook’s “mann[ed] picket lines at many of the stores throughout Marion and Johnson Counties,” the ad noted. The ad alleges that workers voted to be represented by the Retail Clerk’s Union-Local 725, and despite this vote’s certification by the local labor board, Hook’s “ignored this vote and refused to bargain” with them. The ad also accused Hook’s of hiring replacement labor and a public relations campaign against them. “We ask that we be treated fairly,” the ad declares, “and with respect by the Hook’s Drug Company, and that negotiations in good faith begin at once.”\n\nThe figures from 1981 come of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial. Alongside the growth in stores and overall sales, their net earnings rose to a record level of $7.3 million.\n\n[4] “Hook’s Drug in Benton to hold grand opening,” Carbondale Southern Illinoisan, September 1, 1982, 59, Newspapers.com; “Hook, Kroger announce merger,” Nappanee Advance-News, March 6, 1985, 13, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hooks Offers Free Holiday Calendar,” Indianapolis Recorder, December 3, 1988, 16, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hooks Drugs Celebrates 90 Years in 1990,” Nappanee Advance-News, January 24, 1990, 9, Hoosier State Chronicles.\n\nThe figures from 1982 come from an article in the Carbondale Southern Illinoisan. The article also noted that 30% of the firm’s business comes from the prescription department, “nearly twice the national average.”\n\nIn 1985, Hook Drugs, Inc. merged with the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain Kroger, which was the “second largest supermarket chain,” according to the Nappanee Advance-News. Commenting on the merger, Lyle Everingham, chairman and CEO of Kroger, said, “our company has long admired Hook Drugs, both for its fine management and also for its record of outstanding performance in the retail drug business.” Hook’s maintained its brand name in Kroger stores. The merger would end in 1986, when Hook’s and the SupeRx drug store chain, both owned by Kroger, split off into their own firm, Hook-SupeRx, Inc., as mentioned by the Nappanee Advance-News.\n\nBy 1990, in its 90th year of business, Hook’s had 380 drugstores and 30 “Convalescent Aids Centers, which carry a complete line of durable medical equipment, the Nappanee Advance News reported.\n\n[5] “Food Service Jimcrow Lifted by Hook Drugs,” Indianapolis Recorder, February 15, 1947, 1, Hoosier State Chronicles; “New Job Chances Sought for Minority Groups by C. of C.,” Indianapolis Recorder, December 18, 1965, 16, Hoosier State Chronicles; “W. Howard Bell rises up quickly in Hook’s chain,” Indianapolis Recorder, December 20, 1969, Section 2, page 7, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Women’s Unit to Hold Forum,” Indianapolis News, April 1, 1972, 27, Newspapers.com; “Ray Crowe Appointed to Hook Drugs Post,” Indianapolis Recorder, December 8, 1973, 13, Hoosier State Chronicles.\n\nThe Indianapolis Recorder carried coverage of Hook Drugs’ desegregation of their lunch counters, which the Indianapolis Civil Rights Committee fought tirelessly to achieve. As the Recorder noted, “committee members will continue going into various Hook’s stores in order to make certain that the new policy is put into practice.”\n\nIn 1965, the Recorder wrote that August F. Hook of Hook Drugs, Inc. served on a committee modeled after California’s Chamber of Commerce for Employment Opportunity. The committee’s goals were to “secure maximum employer cooperation in the employment and advancement of minority groups in the community,” “establish a 2-way communication . . . to make known employment need and opportunities,” and “assist other organizations and individuals to improve their programs for enhancing the employment of minority group or disadvantaged workers.”\n\nIn 1969, Hook Drugs promoted W. Howard Bell to management, becoming one of the two black managers for Hook’s stores in Indianapolis and raising the company’s minority management in the city to 10% overall. His innovative “Santa Claus Comes to the Ghetto” sales initiative, accompanied by information for customers, elicited coverage in the local press. The program was “aimed at giving customers a chance to obtain some items at reduced cost without waiting for the after-Christmas discount,” the Indianapolis Recorder noted. By 1972, he would own four drugstores of his own, according to the Indianapolis News.\n\nAlongside management of their stores, Hook’s also promoted African Americans to corporate positions. In 1973, Hook’s appointed Ray Crowe, acclaimed/noted athlete, coach, and politician, to store employment supervisor in its personnel department, as noted by the Indianapolis Recorder.\n\n[6] “Drug Abuse is Hook Firm Crusade,” Indianapolis Star, January 10, 1971, 157, Newspapers.com; “Hook’ Drugs praised for drug abuse presentation,” Indianapolis Recorder, January 16, 1971, 2, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hook’s to Sponsor Poison Control,” Nappanee Advance-News, March 26, 1980, 19, Hoosier State Chronicles; “‘Drugs: It Takes Guts to Say No’ is Theme of Anti-Drug Campaign,” Indianapolis Recorder, September 5, 1981, 1, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Hook’s Offers Guide to Drug Abuse,” Knightstown Tri-County Banner, August 22, 1984, 2, Newspapers.com; “Hook’s Pharmacists prepare to fight against drug abuse,” Martinsville Reporter-Times, September 13, 1989, 12, Newspapers.com.\n\nAs the Indianapolis Star reported in its January 10, 1971 issue, “Many Hook’s pharmacists serving in stores and in administrative positions have given countless talks to schools, churches, and other social action groups” about drug abuse and its prevention.\n\nIn 1980, Hook’s sponsored a state-wide poison control initiative that “include[d] a $40,000 grant. . . to establish a statewide network of regional hospital emergency treatment centers to provide close at hand emergency treatment throughout the state,” as noted the Nappanee Advance-News. The next year, Hook’s co-sponsored a 10-week “anti-drug abuse public service campaign” entitled “It Takes Guts to Say No.” Hook’s Executive Vice President Newell Hall said of the initiative to the Indianapolis Recorder, “as a corporation we care committed to providing professional prescription service to our communities and feel it is our duty to inform the public about the hazards of substance abuse.”\n\nHook’s also provided literature to consumers. The Knightstown Tri-County Banner reported on August 22, 1984 that Hook’s “has published a new brochure about the symptoms of drug abuse and what parents can do if they suspect this problem exists in their families.” James M. Rogers, Hook’s vice president of public relations, told the Banner, “Our brochure offers facts and common sense information for parents and children alike. If prevention doesn’t work, early detection is critical.” Hook’s “Parent Guide to Drug Abuse” pamphlets were available for free in all their stores.\n\nHook’s pharmacists in 1989 attended a “Speakers Training Program for Drug abuse presented by the Pharmacists Against Drug Abuse (PADA) Foundation and the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy” to “assist in the fight against drug abuse by speaking to community organizations about this nationwide epidemic,” according to the Martinsville Reporter-Times. “Our objectives in presenting this program to our pharmacists were to define ‘gateway’ or ‘stepping stone’ drugs as these terms pertain to illicit drug use,” Thomas G. Dingledy, assistant vice president of public relations for Hook’s, said to the Reporter-Times. For those interested in scheduling a pharmacist to speak on these matters, they would contact the Hook’s Speaker Bureau and its coordinator, Jim Gerard.\n\n[7] Frank Salzarulo, “Drugstore of 100 Years Ago for Fair,” Indianapolis News, August 10, 1966, 42, Newspapers.com; Dick Greene, “Seen and Heard in Our Neighborhood,” Muncie Star Press, September 1, 1966, 5, Newspapers.com; Gertrude De Atley, “Hook’s Historical Drugstore to Remain Open to Public,” Indianapolis Star, September 8, 1966, 20, Newspapers.com; “Hook’s to Establish Old Fashioned Soda Pavilion,” Greencastle Banner Graphic, August 15, 1973, 1, Hoosier State Chronicles; Judy Keene, “Hook’s Historic Drug Store and Pharmacy Museum,” Indianapolis Magazine, 1982, Pamphlet Collection, Indiana State Library; Gail Whitchurch, “Hook’s Drug Store,” Discover Indiana, 2013 (updated 2019), publichistory.iupui.edu.\n\nAugust F. Hook, president of Hook Drugs, Inc., commissioned this project to coincide with the sesquicentennial of the state, and would initially be open year-round through the 1966 and 1967 seasons, according to the Indianapolis News. It was housed in the former State Board of Health building on the fairground’s campus and “given the antique treatment inside and out—from floor to ceiling—and gas lights have been installed out front.” The only modern inclusions were air conditioning and light bulbs.\n\nThe museum opened to great fanfare on August 25, 1966. Dick Greene, writing in the Muncie Star Press called the museum “among the best” at the fairgrounds. “This is an uncommon display and the Hook firm must have scoured the countryside near and far to put together such an assembly of articles,” he wrote.\n\nThe Greencastle Banner-Graphic reported in its August 15, 1973 issues that “Hook Drugs, Inc. will establish an old fashioned soda pavilion adjacent to their 1890 drug store at the 1973 Indiana State Fair.”\n\nThe museum remained on permanent display from 1966 until 1977, when a dispute between the fairgrounds and Hook Drugs relating to promotional materials kept it dark for three years. It reopened in 1980 and has been open ever since.\n\nReflecting on its success years later in Indianapolis Magazine, Judy Keene observed, “the Hook’s Historical Drugstore and Pharmacy Museum has become a national acclaimed tourist attraction. It has garnered many awards from both pharmaceutical and historical organizations, and millions of individuals have visited from every state and many foreign countries.”\n\n[8] “Revco Plans to Buy Hook-SupeRx,” Indianapolis Star, April 5, 1994, 37-38, Newspapers.com; “Hook-SupeRx Sale is Moving Ahead,” Indianapolis Star, July 7, 1994, 33, Newspapers.com; “Shareholders OK Hook-SupeRx Sale,” Indianapolis Star, July 9, 1994, 25, Newspapers.com; “April 4,” Indianapolis Star, July 14, 1994, 77, Newspapers.com; “Hook’s Stores to Continue Despite Sale,” Evansville Press, July 19, 1994, 15, Newspapers.com; “Hook-SupeRx Close Some Local Offices,” Indianapolis News, July 19, 1994, 25, Newspapers.com; “Drugstore Chain to Sell 272 Stores Recently Acquired,” Martinsville Reporter-Times, July 18, 1994, 9, Newspapers.com; “Buyout Leaves Workers Wondering,” Noblesville Ledger, July 20, 1994, 20, Newpapers.com; “Revco is Proud to Have Hook’s as Part of our Family,” Indianapolis Star, July 20, 1994, 56, Newspapers.com; “Who Hook-ed whom?

This would make them the second largest drug store chain in the country, the Indianapolis Star reported. Hook-SupeRx shareholders approved the sale in July of that year, finalizing the merger. With the consolidation came job cuts and selling off stores. The Evansville Press reported that 272 Hook’s stores would be sold by Revco and the Indianapolis News noted that “some of the regional offices will be closed.” The Indianapolis regional office was closed, which led to all its staff being laid off, and 50 Hook’s stores were closed.\n\nThe South Bend Tribune reported in its January 28, 1997 issue that a merger with Revco and CVS was imminent, “a combination [that] would create a drugstore giant with 4,000 stores and revenues of $11 billion.” Like with the Revco-Hook’s merger, this merger would have made CVS the second-largest drugstore chain the country, behind Walgreen’s. CVS finalized its purchase of Revco on February 7, 1997, at a cost at $2.8 billion to the Rhode-Island based retailer, according to the Indianapolis Star. To meet Federal Trade Commission (FTC) anti-trust requirements, Revco sold 120 stores in the spring of 1997, and once these stores were sold, the FTC approved the merger."
