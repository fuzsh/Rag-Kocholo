        "text": "A Florida-based retailing company said Friday that it may be willing to sweeten a takeover offer for the 1,100-store Revco D.S. Inc. drug chain.\n\nA spokesman at Jack Eckerd Corp. said Eckerd was reviewing Revco's bankruptcy reorganization plan and ``we may modify the offer and that modification may be more appealing to Revco.'Revco's board and creditors reviewed the original offer and decided it ``provided insufficient value to warrant further discussions at this time.' The terms of the proposal weren't disclosed.\n\nEckerd spokesman Gene Ormond said the original offer still stood. But Revco spokeswoman Diana Lueptow said that Revco didn't consider the initial offer as still being open.\n\nShe declined comment on the possibility of a sweetened offer from Eckerd.\n\nBased in Clearwater, Fla., Eckerd is a major retailer that operates 1,680 drugstores in 13 states. A merger with Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco would create the nation's largest drug chain with nearly 2,800 stores, eclipsing the 2,378-store Rite Aid Corp.\\\n\nWall Street\n\nStocks strengthened Friday after new government reports offered evidence that inflation was under control and the economy was escaping the recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 35.33 to 3,000.45.\n\nBig Board volume at 4 p.m. totaled 167.53 million shares, against 144.87 million at the same time in the previous session. Later, volume from the two after-hours sessions totaled 1.72 million shares.\n\nCyclical stocks include industrial issues such as General Motors, which gained 2 to 44 in active trading. Others in the category included International Paper, up 1 3/4 to 71; Ford Motor, up 1 3/4 to 36 7/8; and Mobil, up 1 to 65 3/4.\n\nOther actively traded issues included PepsiCo, up 7/8 to 30 7/8; Computer Associates International, gained 1/2 to 10; IBM, down to 100; and RJR Nabisco, up to 10 3/4.\\\n\nNation\n\nDelinquent consumer loans rose to the highest level in nearly two years during the first quarter, a trade association said. The report suggested the recession was squeezing borrowers.\n\nThe delinquency rate for seven types of closed-end installment loans rose to 2.67 percent from 2.57 percent in the fourth quarter, the American Bankers Association said Friday. That compares with 2.46 percent a year ago.\n\nLoans 30 or more days past due are considered delinquent.\n\nLionel Corp., the former model-train maker that now owns the Kiddie City toy-store chain, sought protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy laws.\n\nThe nation's third-largest toy retailer blamed a slow retail environment and tight credit conditions for Friday's filing, Lionel's second dive under the Chapter 11 umbrella in a decade.\n\nThe company also was hurt by competition. Its 97 stores in 15 states are grossly outnumbered by 700 Toys 'R' Us outlets, as well as by about 200 Child World stores.\n\nA federal judge Friday blocked Trans World Airlines' offer to buy a vast portion of its estimated $1.37 billion debt at a discount, a move that could push the troubled airline closer to bankruptcy.\n\nTWA's effort to buy its way out of debt at a fraction of the debt's value is a crucial element of its strategy to stay in business without landing in bankruptcy court.\n\nDividends\n\nKenan Transport Co., Chapel Hill: 5 1/2 cents, payable July 15 to holders of record June 28.\n\nPeople\n\nRichard W. Kauffeld Jr. has joined R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. as vice president of business planning.\\ Kauffeld and Scott\n\nLibby Hill Seafood Restaurants has named Joseph W. Scott chief financial officer for the chain.\\\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
