        "text": "Julie Goley\n\nDirector of the Augusta State University Career Center\n\nMy first paying job was as a cashier at a drugstore chain, Revco (which was bought by CVS), in 1986, and I was paid $3.35 an hour.\n\nI completed an application at the end of my junior year in high school and had to take a paper/pencil test where it asked me strange questions about my \"thoughts versus my actions\" on theft and other things.\n\nIt called to mind the dilemma of how to answer a yes/no test when you cannot elaborate on the situation. I had stolen before, out of my big sister's piggy bank when we were younger. I always returned the money when she realized I took it. The point was to annoy her, not really to take her money for good. I recall wondering if my responses to a yes/no questionnaire would yield an interview or if my efforts to be a pest to my sister at a younger age would end my opportunity before it began. They must have thought I was really honest or not too much of a thief because I was hired about two weeks later.\n\nOn my shift, I was the main cashier, handling all general purchases and pharmacy items. I quickly learned the primary profit of the store (at that time) came from the sale of beer, cigarettes and prescription drugs (in that order).\n\nThe position influenced me in many ways. As the youngest employee, I learned that just because a person is older it does not mean they are more mature. I learned how to balance respect for the position of authority, even if the person in the position does not demonstrate professionalism at times.\n\nThe job gave me compassion for people and a respect for confidentiality. HIV/AIDS was still a very misunderstood disease with the public, and I was often involved in helping customers get their medications. I witnessed a lot of public bias about the disease and to those individuals who came into the store with the disease.\n\nI learned I never wanted to work with actual money in my career, because it was terribly stressful to count the drawer at the end of the night to see if it balanced. At that time, you still had to make change in your head with the registers, and there were customers that would try to trick you in making change.\n\nThe job helped me in developing more patience with people. I discovered that angry and irrational customers sometimes use tempers in a public setting as a way of asserting power when they do not feel a sense of power anywhere else. I learned in management it is important to get out and experience the things your employees are asked to do. It helps build rapport and shows appreciation for the job at hand.\n\nI realized it is hard to have a lot of self esteem and pride in your work when you make minimum wage. I applied the same work ethic to the cashier job as I did to my next job doing shift work in a mill on the production line. Because the mill provided more money ($5.85) and incentives for the hours, I immediately felt more valued by the company ,and that would often sustain my dedication to the job more easily than when I worked minimum wage in retail.\n\nLark Jones\n\nMayor of North Augusta\n\nI washed cars at my father's automobile dealership. I tiddled at it for a few years, but it became a paying job. Probably I would say I was 15 years old. I did it every summer until I went to college. My father had the Dodge dealership, which was known as the Bill Jones Dodge City on the Gordon Highway, where the Augusta Dodge dealership is today. I would have started in the summer of 1965.\n\nIf they had a minimum wage in '65, I'm sure that's what I was paid.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about the job was I got to be around cars. I got to be around a lot of different cars. I was around mechanics and people who worked on cars, a blue-collar group of folks that I had not had a lot of exposure to before that time, as a 15-year-old.\n\nYou got real dirty. This wasn't just washing cars. This was what you would call detailing cars. It would start out with vacuuming them and washing them. After a year or two, with a little experience, you started using a Steam Jenny and cleaning the engines, then dying carpets and refurbishing them, really trying to spruce them up.\n\nKenneth Ward\n\nBusiness manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1579\n\nMy first paying job was at Overnight Trucking Terminal, working in the warehouse. The year was 1965. The terminal was in Clearwater, and I worked as summer help loading tractor-trailers.\n\nI rode my bike a mile and a half from my home and simply went in and asked for a job. After talking with a supervisor, he agreed to give me a job in the warehouse.\n\nMy pay was $1.50 an hour.\n\nWhat was so great was earning spending money and meeting the truck drivers coming in from other parts of the country that talked different than we do.\n\nWhat was not so great was some days I would have to load bails of cotton weighing over 700 pounds and I was only 135 pounds myself. As long as I kept the bail balanced, no problem, but sometimes I did get off balance and there I would go.\n\nMargaret Woodard\n\nExecutive director, Downtown Development Authority\n\nMy first paying job was a soda jerk at Ford-Musgrove Drugstore in Nashville, Tenn., in 1970.\n\nMy duties included dipping cones and making milk shakes. When I wasn't busy, I stocked shelves and delivered prescriptions on my bike.\n\nThough he won't admit it, I am sure my father got me the job. He was part of a men's group that met there every morning to discuss politics and gossip. When I wasn't in school, my dad would take me, and I loved it.\n\nI was paid $1.50 per hour plus tips.\n\nIt influenced me in several ways. One, I still support independent mom-and-pop shops when possible. I get my prescriptions filled at Maxwell House and pick up groceries at Hildebrandt's. In my 1 years here, I have only been to the mall twice out of sheer necessity.\n\nFinally, I rarely eat ice cream!\n\nClay Whittle\n\nColumbia County Sheriff\n\nWhen I was 14, I started raking yards and cutting grass to earn spending money. In the summer of my 15th birthday, I took a job with MCG (the Medical College of Georgia) in ground maintenance. That's right, cutting grass with a push mower and running a Weed Eater.\n\nMy baseball coach, Mickey Gunnels, worked there and helped me get the job. The pay was minimum wage, whatever that was in 1974 or '75. That job taught me responsibility - be at work on time, don't lay out, finish the job right the first time, don't wait for the boss to tell you what to do. That job also taught me how to deal with other workers."
