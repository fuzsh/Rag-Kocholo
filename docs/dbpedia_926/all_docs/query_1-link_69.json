        "text": "Man Ray has been a part of my entire adult life. I was 18 years old and four months old when I first went there, in 1990. I've been reading these memories and it's been making me think about it all probably a bit too much, but I've decided to try and write down every single thing I can remember from Man Ray.\n\nSaturday night was amazing. This whole week was fantastic. They say that the important parts in life are birth, love, sex, marriage, school, work and death, and I think I've experienced almost all of these at Man Ray, except maybe death. No funerals, but last night sure felt like the greates wake ever. Here's hoping we move on to birth soon.\n\n(I'm only keeping these MP3s up for a few days, so please don't sue me.)\n\nDJ Chris, already there when I first got there, 1990\n\nThe first time I went to Man Ray was mid-september 1990. I don't have the exact date, and it upsets me greatly, but I can pin it down to between September 2, 1990 (the day I first moved to Boston from Alaska), and September 26, 1990 (the day of the first show I went to Man Ray at, and I remember already being familiar with the club). I do remember the circumstances, though. I had met a girl named Jen Bose who lived in the same freshman dorm as I (Warren Towers, at BU). She got off the elevator and was wearing a Front Line Assembly T-Shirt. I exclaimed something goofy and nerdy about how awesome it was that she was wearing that shirt - because no one in my home town liked music like that. We became fast friends, and not two weeks later, we met a strange man named Josh, a few years older than us, worldly wise, blonde hair a la Dirk Benedict, but a dashing goth leather jacket and a love of Psychic TV. He introduced us to a girl named Jen Danzig and told us we should \"check out this cool club.\"\n\nCambridge was very far away from home for me, having spent exactly 2 weeks of my life living outside of northern Alaska at this point, but this wise man guided us to the club. It was a Wendesday, and there were maybe 20 people there, but I was immediately enthralled with the club, with my new friends, with Josh's glamorous friends. It wasn't goth that first night, I specifically remember being excited to hear \"I wanna be Adored,\" by the Stone Roses and \"April Skies,\" by the Jesus and Mary Chain. I liked it. We made it a habit to go all the time.\n\nAdi, Sherri, Jen, my Man Ray posse, Oct 1990.\n\nFrom that moment on, for basically fifteen years, Man Ray has been a massive part of my social life. Even the years where I went all emo and stopped going, or pooh poohed it, after this week, I can now see that a huge part of my life revolved around it. Even now, there are 63 people on my friends list that I associate with Man Ray somehow. It has touched on several of the great loves in my life. My company was started from people who were friends at that club.\n\nAfter leaving early on friday, just after Ooze (I knew I'd be back saturday), and looking at that line around the corner, and thinking of all the people I'd known through the years that COULDN'T make it the last week (mrsdiomedes, misslunarkitty, lizenthusiasm, humglum, spectrum03, Michael Stiska, Peter, so many more), it became clear to me just what a huge influence it's been on my life.\n\nTrent Reznor was NOT present.\n\nThe DJs. In the early years, I remember the funny DJs who were always competing for dominance with Chris - Linda Lawrence, Morning Guy Tai. Some of them have been around forever. It was interesting to see Tim Ryan djing @ Man Ray these last few weeks. He's been around forever. humglum and her then-boyfriend Thom DJd there a lot, sometimes in the front room and sometimes in the lounge. Did Redboy ever DJ or did he just work the door? There were all those front room DJs, I could never keep track.\n\nBut of course the DJ was Chris. Chris, to me, IS Man Ray. I remember when I first started being dimly aware of him, to first being introduced to him by humglum, to becoming friends and then better friends. I remember him officiating at humglum's wedding. It's been an honor to be his friend for nearly ten years, and to be a colleague as well (Chris put out a song on a compilation for our record company, and has done a lot of sound work for the Barbarians as well). It goes without saying that his wedding will be one of my most amazing, cherished, fondest memories of Man Ray. He's been so kind, as well, to so many people all these years. He's rigged a few contests through the years to get me a free New Order CD or a poster, but drekka and I won the Lilliput 2CD 4AD set fair and square. And when you walk in to the club, and he sees you from up there in his booth, it always feels like a song comes on just for you. He knew my favorites (Temptation, Swamp Thing, Haunted When the Minutes Drag, Romulus and Venus, Test Dept's Bang on It, Clan of Xymox's A Day, and for a long time, inexplicably, Pop Will Eat Itself. I sometimes think it was my incessant nagging for years that got him to eventually make Ich Bin Ein Auslander a staple).\n\nTrent is coming rumor # 2\n\nI remember being scared of the early fetish fridays - when I was 18, 19, 20 - the holdovers from the Ground Zero days, I thought, that were \"too many old people,\" for my 18 year old self. How funny, through the years, that friday became so much more central to me. Scary old people what? Those are us now.\n\nLaibach!\n\nI remember the great, long, 6 year flow from alternative, to industrial, to goth. I remember always wishing that the music would progress, for maybe 6 years. I remember thinking I knew more about music than Chris, and later, when we became friends, and I actually learned anything about music, I realized how preposterously precocious I was for even thinking that. I remember complaining about industrial, even though I liked it, wishing he would play goth. I remember it slowly transitioning over to goth, and thinking he should play - oh god, what? Probably indie rock or something.\n\nAnd then one day, somewhere in the late 90's, it all just gelled and clicked for me, and Man Ray was what it was. It was... a haven. A statement on what it liked. A provider of a specific service, a lifeline to something you couldn't get anywhere else in town. And then I just stopped caring what the music was - the goth nights went, musically, in a way I never really got, I never really got the synthpop goth, but Chris always still played the old standbyes for us, the chameleons, joy division, bauhaus, etc.\n\nSometimes I think I imagined this show.\n\nThere was a period where Man Ray was a pretty happin' live venue.\n\nAnd then there were the shows. Starting out from the first show I ever saw there - A Split Second with Dresden Dance opening (and I always forget to ask Chris this, but wasn't Dresden Dance one of his interim bands between Figures on a Beach and the early Magnetic Fields?). The Second show was Consolidated and MC 900 Foot Jesus, after which I met a kid named Craig Uram, who was a friend of mine to this day. Through the years we lived together, started bands together, rented a loft, built a darkroom and more. The third show I ever went to there was Alien Sex Fiend, October 1990, at their first of many Man Ray Halloween shows.\n\nAnd so many others through the years. The mythical, weird, surreal Dead or Alive show in... what? 1996? When cordeliaflyte, Lake and I stood in awe as Pete Burns lip-synched to his own record with 3 drag dancers and not even a sequencer on stage. At the time I was appalled, but I'll wager a young Fisher and Spooner were at the new york show, because 8 years later they did basically the same thing at a packed Avalon. Someone should really start a wikipedia list for all the shows @ Man Ray. There have been some strange ones. I remember the fear and excitement the first time Death In June played Man Ray in 1997 - their first show ever in america, apparently. I remember Ben and I meeting Marilyn Manson there in...1994? I remember everyone being excited when Blixa Bargeld was there, but being too scared to talk to him, myself. I remember Earth Defense Force playing there, of course. But its the early years that interest me. When they still did a few rock shows here and there - the Nirvana show of course, has been well documented, but there are other weird ones. Ed's Redeeming Qualities? Does anyone else remember if Dredd Foole and the Din played, or am I imagining that? The Legendary Pink Dots in 1991. The Jesus Lizard in 199? Die Krupps? RevCo? What else?\n\nDeath in June's first American show\n\nAnd friends bands, of course. I think sk0t23 is probably right. He and/or Mark or Elaine (I still have the foot long crescent wrench she gave me) have probably played there more than anyone else. I remember an infinite number of sleep chamber and you shriek and DDT shows. I loved it when Freezepop eventually played there, because I just love good shows @ Man Ray. Those early Pigface shows - when the swirling rumors that Trent Reznor would be joining Pigface were so fast it eclipsed the rest of the band and how completely awesome they were.\n\nMy friend Crissinda, dancing on stage, 1991. Note Lisa W in back.\n\nMy friend Hass (and is that Doug M on the left?) and the last picture I'd take in Man Ray for 7 years. Note Don looking annoyed at me not following the no-camera rule.\n\nMy college Man Ray posse was Jen B, Sherri and Adi, Molly, Dennis (aka Boy) and Deanna (aka Girl, and, later, Sticky) Jules and Guidi and Benny Blanco and Redboy and Crissinda and Hass and my roommates Mark K and Rick K (aka Waxy), drekka and Chris G. Wraithe and humglum. A mysteriously elusive girl named Jen Danzig, and spectrum03 and the girl who would eventually become my first great true love, Beth Young. Man, I'd pay $100 to find out what happened to her. Michael Stiska, the vampire wonder that EVERYONE was in love with. Kim and Stephanie. Pax Romana Dave. Ben Cunningham. The Cupcakes. _lambchop_ was keepin it real on the BU end of things, and so was Waxy. Batt and Box.\n\nI remember Terry selling me my first legal drink.\n\n\"Wish me a happy birthday! I'm 21!\" I told her.\n\n\"But I've been serving you for a year.\" she snarled in her lovable way.\n\n\"I had a fake ID.\"\n\nShe looked like she was going to slap me, shook her head, and said \"lemme give you your first free drink.\"\n\nI remember when they first had this night called \"Sin.\" They handed out these enigmatic flyers for them, and they just said \"SIN\" with a date. You'd ask the doormen and no one would tell you what it was. Nine Inch Nail's \"Sin\" had recently come out, and again, frenzied speculation that it would be something related to Nine Inch Nails. It turned out to be a new night, DJ'd by John Debo (who went by Lord Debo for the event). It was good, it was fun, but it wasn't Chris. Debo eventually moved over to Venus (now Karma Club) and did a Thursday night residency that for years was the other great club night in Boston. I remember at this time all the Landsowne people were friends with Man Ray, and it was a good time.\n\nI remember the first \"Hell\" night. Again, massive anticipation. I remember walking in and the sense of excitement.\n\nHow many times did this happen?\n\nI remember being really excited by the program, and the food, and the added touch of elegance to the whole thing. I remember meeting cusraque for the first time. I remember really enjoying the night, and I remember the first performance coming on. I remember hating it and groaning and walking into the other room. In hindsight, though, it was a profound moment, I think. There had been other performances here and there (most notably the Women of Sodom stuff), but that really set the trend. Soon the performance nights proliferated. But Cusraque, to my mind, at least, really changed things with that first Hell.\n\nThere was a Hell performance, a few years later, that struck me as the first truly amazingly artistic performance at Man Ray. I don't remember much about it, it dealt with time, in cycles, and repetition and surrealism. It had a coke dealer, and Tonya wandering around in a bikini. I remember telling Cusraque afterwards that I thought it was his best performance ever. For years afterward, as he'd give me a hell flyer, he'd tell me the performances would be as good as that one.\n\nWhen I graduated from college in late, I went back to alaska the next summer, and stayed there for a year. My journals from that period are littered with references about missing Man Ray, and what a great place it was. I came back to Boston for a quick visit in January of 1994, and this is what I wrote about Man Ray:\n\nDespite its efforts, it’s still pretty much the same. Chris is still Chris, the manager is still mean, and they have a metal cage now and better paintings, including one that sports the greatest slogan ever – Better Living through Cocktails. I love going there and trying to know who EVERYONE is. Everyone says they know everyone, but it’s obviously not true for any of them. They just know everyone in their group. I want to know who EVERYONE is – the punks, Goths, fetishists, college kids, ravers, industrials, urban outfitted: All. AND I want to pee.\n\nMe and Liz Enthusiasm Gothing it up, getting ready for Man Ray, 1994\n\nThat trip was monumental as well because it's where I first became friends with misslunarkitty and lizenthusiasm, both of which I had just met before I went away to Alaska. This worked out so that when I came back to Boston in late 1994, after a brief stint on Benny and Hass's couch, I ended up moving in with lizenthusiasm and my old friend Craig, and not long after dating misslunarkitty, who introduced me to the Palmers, Ben and Emily, and Cathy B, and then by association, a bit later wisheyeveiw. cordeliaflyte moved back from toronto and started joining us regularly, and my sister entered the Man Ray mix around then, too, being a freshman at Northeastern, and becoming friends with Jamison and Emily the P on her own (or did she introduce me?) humglum moved in with misslunarkitty. We'd all pile into Craig's car, every wednesday and some fridays and saturdays and we'd drive from allston to Man Ray. We had a song we'd sing, without fail, every single time. It was an amalgamation of the songs we'd have stuck in my head each week, and we'd pile them on until it was just long enough for the drive. Every one of us still knows it by heart, in all its dada nonsensical glory:\n\nIt would start out with Johnny Appleseed:\n\nOh the lord is good to me\n\nAnd so I thank the lord\n\nFor giving me the things I need\n\nThe Sun and the rain and the appleseed\n\nthe lord is good to me\n\nThen it would do an Amen chorus, because Amen choruses are funny, and since we didn't really know any, we sang ours to the tune to an old nursery song that my mother used to sing that went:\n\nto stop the train on emergency\n\njust pull on the chord\n\npull on the chord\n\npenalty for improper use\n\nfive pounds.\n\nAnd then after five amens we would sing that very nursery rhyme song.\n\nAnd then we'd sing one chorus of \"na na na na hey hey goodbye\" except I would sing the bass part, and I'd also change \"na na\" to \"nanooks,\" in honor of an old ad we had when I was growing up for the UAF Nanooks hockey team.\n\nand then we'd sing the theme to this ridiculously bad McDonald's ad, which was just\n\nbacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon\n\nThen we'd sing the \"duh duh duh duh\" part of \"eye of the tiger\" by Survivor\n\nThen we'd all scream at the top of our lungs because one time just coming on to River Street, we almost got in a wreck and screamed. the scream became part of the song.\n\nThen we'd degenerate into \"baby's got back.\" I never really figured that part out.\n\nMiss Lunarkitty, Liz Enthusiasm, theUram twins, Michael, Javier and I\n\nI got a job working the night shift at Copy Cop. It started at midnight, but every wednesday I'd get someone to cover for the first hour for me so I could go to Man Ray. Cusraque and I were pretty good friends that year. I'd print his flyers for him, and I remember the little thrill I had the first time I got in for free. After the \"winter in hell\" hell, Jussi and I kept 10 bags of fake snow in our basement for Cusraque, in hopes of maybe reusing it next year. It smelled like Man Ray.\n\nLater that year, me and my sister and misslunarkitty and drekka moved in together. Mike was all weirded out because Schmeg and I had started dating before we moved in. Then sis left and lizenthusiasm and gordonmerrick joined us (never a big Man Ray fan, Mr Merrick), Ben started dating Jenn, and Jenn and Ben would come join me and schmeg for weird double dates. I remember he liked to talk a lot. ;) Cathy B lived with escarey and Liza and they would have parties at their place and in the other room were people like John Adams and that branch of Man Ray society, that always seemed like I wasn't smart enough for. Then one day Cathy B introduced me to j_u_d_i. I remember the third time I ever saw her, dancing on the stage in Chris' room (she was always a stage dancer, I was always a floor dancer, seeking out the little air conditioning pockets in the summer) and thinking she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. It would be another six years before we started dating.\n\nIt was in this time we met pretty much everyone that had been there a while. We had a big enough posse that I could overcome my innate shyness. I met Nicole in this time, and Providence Matthew, and Mike from Spindle Shanks and Lisa Wood and Dorian and Percy and Javier and Adrienne and Cyrano, who we called \"New Hamprshire boy and girl.\" Fraggle russel. Suave Russel. Saron. Soren. The Opium Den/Mistle Thrush/Funeral Party/Twelve Tone Failure people. Amity. Erin Lynn and Kellianne and Christie and the gay trucker, who always wore leather hot pants, danced by the staircase by himself, and never seemed to talk to anyone. skot23. Cathy B. John O.\n\nSchmeg loved the goth, so she knew tons of people as well. She introduced me to Peter for the first time, and Michael Hseih and dawnamtrix and labellemargaux and tons more. Schmeg was sick a lot back then, and some people never really knew we were dating. People would introduce us to each other sometimes, and everyone thought she was dating Peter or Michael, or I was dating some one or other.\n\nAnd then Jussi started dating seandrinkwater and so all of the sudden he and his posse (mainly commodorevic) were part of our posse, and from then on we've been running the Man Ray gauntlet.\n\nThere was a girl who would stand in the middle of the dance floor and dance so slowly that she could barely move. We eventually became friends, and her name was Anne Marie. She was irish. I think she dated ultra5000 for a while. Or was it Christian?\n\nEarth Defense Force in the Basement, 2001\n\nSchmeg @ Ooze, 1999\n\nAnd then one day at the club, in 1995, at the end of the night, I was doing my customary standing against the wall just to the right of the front door, when a guy walked up to me and said \"I have a friend who would like to ask you out on a date.\" \"okay, I said,\" and he introduced me to mrsdiomedes, all red curly hair and little schoolgirl skirt and as trim and fit as could be. I was smitten then and there, and pretty much have been for the next decade.\n\nIt was around then that Man Ray was the complete and total hub of my social life. I loved it.\n\nI remember at this time the sound system kept going out, and Chris would have to run downstairs and flip some switches and reset some breakers to get it going again. It kept happening for months, and it was at this point it first ever crossed my mind that Man Ray could close (ie why don't they fix that? can't they afford it?). It was not a pleasant thought.\n\nPeter, Ooze, 2000\n\nDawn, Ooze, 2001\n\nIn 1996 I took a goth band on tour of America (again, Man Ray, in the form of Chris, was a huge help), and I had the occasion to go to almost every goth club in America. We hit clubs in New York, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, LA, San Francisco, Phoenix, Texas, New Orleans, Florida, Georgia, Washington DC. I met an amazing amount of cool people. It was a wonderful time. But one thing that I learned, on that trip, was that Man Ray wasn't just another goth club. I had never really realized this before - I had only ever lived in Alaska and Boston, and I thought that every city of a moderate size had an amazing goth club. But going to all of them, that's when I realized what a truly great club Man Ray was, and what a truly great DJ Chris was. The rest of the country was lost to Projekt bands and Sky Cries Mary and the proto synth goth, and yes, all of those were good, but we also got... an education. We got Japan, we got \"Terror Couple Kill Colonel\" when the rest of the country only ever got \"Bela Lugosi's Dead.\" We got Coil and Death in June and Neubauten and the Legendary Pink Dots and Yellow Magic Orchestra and Xmal Deutschland.\n\nI took a break from 1997 to 1999 with Man Ray. I can't remember why, now, exactly, but I was probably filled with all that too-cool-for-school attitude that so much of Boston has for places that are actually fun. I got way into live music and indie rock and we started the record company and Man Ray wasn't much for live shows then. There were the occasional new wave nights with augstone and lizenthusiasm, but no gothing it. I remember going one night in this period, just sylviebosch and I, and we danced to Wham together, and I felt like I was the luckiest guy in the world.\n\nActually I remember why I stopped now. It was the drugs. In hindsight, the worst was probably already past by the time I stopped going, because lord knows it was pretty fuckin' bad for a while there. We had some great times, but in hindsight I think this is the one thing I wish never hit Man Ray. Man Ray never needed heroin, and I'm so thanksful that most, though not all, of our friends survived.\n\nSchmeg @ Ooze, 1999\n\nPeter @ Ooze, 1999\n\nThen Ben moved to Allston, and introduced me to smapple and magneticwoman and I found Jamison again, and Ben started dating Nicole, and they were doing Ooze, and then all of the sudden one day I was helping and then boom, there I was going often again. Ben made me start focusing again. Made me work. Made me start a band. Made me make art again. I remember being amazed, the first random wednesday I went back, on a lark, and knowing so many people. And Nicole had gathered a really great group of people. Eva and Peter and Dawn and the Bull brothers. The twins introduced me to a whole new round and world of Man Ray people that I hadn't met yet - mandy_moon, the Fantasy Factory people, Trent, Shaun Kelly, jennever (which I am eternally grateful to them for introducing me), pat_man_ta and Aloni and mistresshellena and spitcurl and kharma. And the friends you meet over time, because they were as quiet as you were, or shy, or at the bar when you were on the dance floor, that only years and years of time in the same environment really let you get to meet finally like julishka and rojagato.\n\nBen , Ooze, 2003\n\nNicole, Ooze, 2001\n\nJamison, Ooze, 2002\n\nThen all the way up to now... almost 2 years ago, j_u_d_i and I moved in almost next door to Man Ray. It's been amazing having them as neighbors, and we've had people coming over after nights, and it's been such a joy to get to stop by and have chats with Chris and Terry and Daisy and the gang, as they hang out in the entry way starting around 8 PM, and I'm coming home from work.\n\nAnd the girls. the crushes of Man Ray, through the years. j_u_d_i remarked last night, on the last night at Man Ray, that I could fill my room with crushes. I have a bit of a crush problem, and through the years, Man Ray has been an ample provider of crush fodder. I remember one night, when I was maybe 20 years old, sitting over by the stairs (I was a stage left person until about 1996, when Terry's bar was still in the middle, than moving over to stage right along with Terry's bar). ANYWAY, I remember thinking one night, that I had never seen so many beautiful women in one place, and I would consider myself lucky to know just one of them. And lucky I have been, so many of them have become friends through the years: j_u_d_i, smapple, mrsdiomedes, humglum, dawnamtrix, glass_of_ether, jennever. Anne Marie. labellemargaux, Nicole, Eva... Deanna. Jamie V. Val F. I even met sylviebosch and thegroupie at Man Ray, during the Aug/New Wave night years. This girl named Sarah from MIT who moved off to LA and last I heard was dating a noted producer. Stephanie, who moved to Ecuador or something like that. Cathy. And the crushes through the years that I never really knew well: Lisa W. There was some girl named Tonya that I obsessed over for a year (not labellemargaux, but another one). That strange librarian-like girl a year or two ago.\n\nAnd the characters through the years and the funny names you'd make for them. Where's my horse boy. TOPY kid. Stilts guy (well, I guess that one's not so original). Girl with the dress that fits. Slow girl. The Pirate (I'm sure you couldn't guess who that is). Hot girl. That pink veronica. Guy with the stuff in his hair. Pre-rephaelite girl (there were actually two different ones of these). Nerdy girl. Lounge Girl. Busty Nymph. Flippy Stompy Boy. Squishy Craig. Fraggle Russel. Spikey Bobby.\n\nThe Man Ray stomp.\n\nShinobi.\n\nThe Jager Machine.\n\nThe bathrooms.\n\nThe videos.\n\nAnd The Smell. Oh, god, The Smell."
