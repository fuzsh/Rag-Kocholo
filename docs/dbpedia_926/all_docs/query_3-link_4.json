Supermarket chain Pantry Pride bought the company in 1984, and the brand disappeared a few years later.\n\nSource: The New York Times, Bryant University\n\nGeorge Omar Guy founded the G.O. Guy chain of drugstores in 1888.

But when JCPenney bought up the chain in 1998, the remaining Genovese stores ultimately rebranded as Eckerd pharmacies.\n\nSource: The New York Times, Newsday, Tribune Business News\n\nIn 1962, Happy Harry's opened up in Wilmington, Delaware. Over the decades, the chain expanded into New Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The drugstore acquired its name due to the friendly demeanor of its founder, Harry Levin.\n\nSource: WBOC, Delaware Today\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefunct grocer Bruno's launched a drugstore spinoff known as Big B Drugs in 1968 in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1982, Big B became an independent company. In 1996, Revco purchased Big B. CVS then acquired Revco and rebranded the remaining Big B stores as CVS pharmacies.\n\nSource: The Associated Press, The Pink Sheet, Funding Universe\n\nFounded in 1905, Peoples Drug built up a network of location in Washington, DC; Virginia; and Maryland; and it even spread up and down the East Coast.

In 2006, Rite Aid bought the company and retired the Brooks name.\n\nSource: Crunchbase, CBS, CNN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 1956, Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco grew to the point that its stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company went bankrupt in 1988 but was able to turn things around. Revco held on for another decade, and was ultimately purchased by CVS in 1997.\n\nSource: The Washington Post, The Washington Post\n\nKatz and Besthoff — known as K&B — first opened its doors in New Orleans in 1905.

Rite Aid bought the chain in 1997.\n\nSource: Nola.com, Baltimore Sun\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn A. Hook established his namesake Hook's Drug Stores in 1900 in Indianapolis. Kurt Vonnegut's father, an architect, helped to design a number of the stores. The company was acquired by CVS in 1997.\n\nSource: \"And So It Goes: Kurt Vonnegut: A Life,\" Hook's Museum\n\nFounded in 1898, Eckerd was a major national drugstore chain in the US for decades.

From there, Eckerd merged with Brooks Pharmacy, but Rite Aid ended up purchasing its stores in 2006. The following year, the Eckerd brand disappeared from stores.\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Orlando Sentinel, AOL\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
