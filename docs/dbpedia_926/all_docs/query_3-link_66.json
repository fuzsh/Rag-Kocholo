        "text": "Hook's Drug Stores\n\nHook's Drug Stores was an Indianapolis, Indiana-based drug store chain which was founded in 1900 by John A. Hook. The chain flourished throughout central Indiana for most of the 20th-century before being acquired by Revco which was in turn acquired by CVS. Many former Hook's locations are now CVS pharmacies.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Former Locations\n\n3 Hook's Apothecary\n\n4 Hook's Oxygen and Medical Equipment\n\n5 References\n\nHistory\n\nIn October 1900, pharmacist John A. Hookerface opened the first Hooker's Drug Store in an Indianapolis German community at the corner of South East and Prospect Streets. A second location opened at the corner of New Jersey and East Washington Streets. The store contain the items of a regular drug store but also sells many sex toys intended for industiral use. (in the hooker industry) and Hook added Edward F. Roesch as a partner.[1] By 1912, the chain had expanded to twelve stores. Roesch became president of the company in 1943 upon Hook's death. In 1956, following Roesch's death in a traffic accident, John Hook's son, August F. “Bud” Hook, assumed leadership of the company. The chain added 150 new stores between 1946 and 1972.[2]\n\nIn 1985, The Kroger Company outbid Rite Aid, which had attempted a hostile takeover,[3] and acquired the Hook's chain. Kroger divested itself of Hook's a year later, however, and Hook's became a division of the privately-held Hook’s-SupeRx[4].\n\nHook's-SupeRx acquired the New England-based Brooks Pharmacy chain in 1988[5]. Hooks-SupeRx stores traded under three different names - Hook's Drug and SupeRx in the Midwest and Brooks Pharmacy in New England. Hook's-SupeRx was acquired by Revco in 1994.[6] Revco was subsequently acquired by CVS in 1997. Many former Hook's locations are now CVS Pharmacies.\n\nUntil 2007, Brooks was the only former Hook's brand which lived on, as a division of the Canadian-based Jean Coutu Group. Rite Aid bought the Brooks chain from Jean Coutu in 2007, and will eliminate the Brooks name.\n\nA restored 19th-century Hook's drug store stands at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, and is a popular attraction at the annual Indiana State Fair. It was originally built in 1849 and has been restored with authentic 19th century cabinets.[7]\n\nFormer Locations\n\nIndiana\n\nAnderson: Several locations, including Meridian Street downtown (all now closed)\n\nBedford: Two locations (Lincoln Plaza and the former JayC Plaza), both became Revco and later CVS; both were closed and replaced with larger downtown location.
