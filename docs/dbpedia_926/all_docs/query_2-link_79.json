        "text": "AKRON, Ohio -- A federal bankruptcy judge has issued an Aug. 7 deadline for Revco D.S. Inc., once the nation's largest drugstore chain, to file a reorganization plan to end its three-year-old case.\n\n'I share the frustration and something has to be done to move this thing along,' Judge Harold F. White said Tuesday in issuing the deadline.\n\nWhite, however, denied a motion to issue an order that would send the Twinsburg company into liquidation if it failed to file a reorganization plan by Aug. 7.\n\nWhite said a written report must be received by June 7 to detail progress of negotiations between Revco and its creditors.\n\nRevco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in July 1888, unable to meet debt payments following a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout in 1986.\n\n'All parties agree it's time to get Revco out of bankruptcy,' Chairman Boake Sells said. 'Progress is being made on a confirmable plan of reorganization.'\n\nRevco, during bankruptcy protection, sold 700 stores in 17 states, choosing to keep 1,100 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and eastern Tennessee.\n\nThe company on Wednesday announced the signing of an agreement with CVS to purchase 29 Peoples Drug stores in Virginia and two in North Carolina, plus other assets in those states.\n\nThe agreement must be approved by the bankruptcy court. A hearing is scheduled for May 28.\n\nThe 31 stores, all to be operated under the Revco name, are primarily in the Tidewater region, including Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Va.\n\n'Our store-divestiture program completed last year positioned us to take advantage of our best markets,' Sells said. 'This acquisition supports that goal. These 31 stores will strengthen our already excellent position in this region.'\n\nRevco now has 263 stores in North Carolina and 147 in Virginia.\n\nCVS, the drug and health and beauty aid division of Melville Corp., operates 1,300 drug stores in 17 states under the names CVS-Pharmacy and Peoples Drug.\n\nSidney Dworkin, who founded the company with a single drugstore in Detroit 33 years ago, took the company private in the leveraged buyout Dec. 29, 1986.\n\nDespite optimistic sales and earnings forecasts, Revco plunged into the red, losing $59 million in fiscal 1987 and $150.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 1988 before filing for federal bankruptcy protection.\n\nDworkin was ousted in 1987.\n\nIn May 1989 eight men accused of insider trading in the leveraged buyout agreed to pay $1.8 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint involving the Insider Trading Act of 1984. They, however, did not admit or deny the allegations.\n\nThe SEC alleged the defendants violated anti-fraud provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act in connection with the sale of Revco.\n\nOne of the men involved was Glenn Golenberg, principal owner of Golenberg & Co., an investment banking company in Cleveland that served as adviser for leveraged buyout."
