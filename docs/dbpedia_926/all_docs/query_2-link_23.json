Overall, Trinity has some strengths and weaknesses within its financial debt portfolio in order, for Trinity to improve its debt rating it will need to improve its operating margins and revenues (Moody's, 2013).

Another initiative in 1999 was the launching of CVS ProCare, a chain of specialty pharmacies, serving patients with chronic diseases and conditions that require complex and expensive drug regimens. The market for specialty pharmaceuticals, estimated at about $16 billion in 1999, was a particularly fast-growing segment of the drug industry, but it was highly fragmented. CVS clearly saw the potential for being a consolidator in this segment of the market (Rundle,2000).

By the end of 2000, CVS's specialty pharmacy business consisted of mail-order operations and 46 CVS ProCare pharmacies located in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Overall, CVS saw its revenues surpass the $20 billion mark for the first time in 2000, while net income reached a record $746 million (Rundle, 2000).

Actually, they were able to keep a continual increase in sales and net income.\n\nHarvard Business Case Study Macy's\n\n856 Words | 2 Pages\n\nMacy’s is valued at twenty-eight billion dollars. Macy’s is not increasing their cash flow. This proposal is not an answer to Macy’s problems. Instead it will merely move around cash and real estate. Selling stores and then renting out some floors could be detrimental to Macy’s because they would no longer be in control. Rents can rise, increasing operating costs and harming profits.
