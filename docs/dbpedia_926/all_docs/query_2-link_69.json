        "text": "In a Nutshell\n\nRevco Solutions is a consumer debt collector and primarily collects past-due medical bills for its clients. In some cases, they also collect other types of consumer debt. If Revco Solutions contacts you, ask them to validate the debt before you do anything else. If they prove the debt is valid, you can decide how to proceed. You can dispute the debt, pay it in full, or negotiate the amount down.\n\nWritten by the Upsolve Team.Â\n\nUpdated February 23, 2024\n\nWhat Is Revco Solutions?\n\nRevco Solutions LLC is a debt collection agency that primarily helps companies like hospitals collect healthcare bills. They also collect debts for retail, utility, and finance companies as well as commercial businesses and government entities. Though they act as a sort of middle-man, you can pay them directly.Â\n\nIf you need to speak with a Revco representative, you can call 855-202-0113 or send an email to mail@revcosolutions.com. You can also get assistance by filling out an online form.\n\nRevco collects debts from consumers across the U.S. They have physical offices in Jacksonville, Florida; Columbus, Ohio; and Durham, North Carolina.Â\n\nRevco Solutions LLC is likely contacting you because a medical provider, utility company, or other company asked them to collect a past-due bill from you.Â\n\nIf youâre being contacted about a past-due medical bill that you thought your health insurer paid, you may need to contact your insurance company to see what they did and didnât cover. Upsolveâs Guide To Dispute or Reduce Expensive Medical Bills can help you understand what to ask.\n\nIs Revco Solutions Legit?\n\nYes, Revco Solutions is a legit debt collection company, but many consumers have filed complaints against them with two of the biggest consumer protection agencies â the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nUnlike many other debt collectors, Revco isnât accredited by the BBB but is still provided a grade and customer rating. The BBB rates Revco Solutions as a âB+,â but their customer rating is just 1.04 stars (out of 5). Further, in the last three years, there have been more than 110 complaints filed against Revco with the BBB, and the CFPB has fielded over 300 complaints for âRevco Management, LLCâ since December 2011.\n\nSeveral customer complaints* allege the following:\n\nThe company has made false or misleading statements to the consumer about the debt or the consequences of not paying the debt.\n\nThe company has tried to collect a debt the consumer doesnât owe.\n\nCompany representatives have used abusive language or harassment.\n\nThe company hasnât validated debts upon request.\n\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) prohibits third-party debt collectors from harassing or misleading consumers. This is a federal law that protects consumers across the U.S. If you believe Revco or any other debt collector has violated the FDCPA, you have the right to file a complaint or sue the debt collector for compensation.\n\n*Note to reader: These reviews and complaints highlight relevant issues, but they may not represent all consumersâ experiences.\n\nHow Do I Know if Iâm Being Scammed?\n\nRevco Solutions is a real company, but scammers may use their name or the name of another legitimate debt collector to try to trick you into giving them personal information.Â\n\nBe wary of anyone who asks for your full bank account information or Social Security number, or who asks you to send money but refuses to answer your questions about the account. You can avoid debt collection scams by learning about common red flags.\n\nDo I Have To Pay Revco Solutions?\n\nYou might have to pay Revco Solutions, but before you do, you need to validate the debt!\n\nDebt validation helps you double-check that the debt amount is accurate and that Revco Solutions has the authority to collect it from you. When debts are transferred between original creditors and debt collection agencies, mistakes can happen. This is why itâs important to exercise your right to have Revco validate the details of your debt. Hereâs how.\n\nUpsolve Member Experiences\n\n1,947 + Members Online\n\nKim Swiiggs\n\nâ â â â â 2 days ago\n\nupsolve is amazing, easy to use.\n\nRead more Google reviews â¾\n\nMaria Grullon\n\nâ â â â â 3 days ago\n\nThe best, easiest, most efficient process ever.

If you havenât received this letter, request one.Â\n\nThe debt validation letter should tell you the details of the debt account and inform you of your right to dispute the debt within 30 days. If you file a dispute, Revco must pause all debt collection efforts while the dispute is in process.Â\n\nIf Revco Solutions doesnât validate the debt within the 30-day window, you probably donât need to pay them. If Revco Solutions validates the debt, then you can decide what happens next.Â\n\nIf the validation notice doesnât include all the information you need, you can send a debt verification letter asking for further information. This is also the letter you can use to dispute the debt, if needed.\n\nStep 2: Decide What To Do Next\n\nOnce Revco has validated the debt, choose your next step. You can:\n\nDispute the debt if you disagree with it.\n\nPay the debt in full.\n\nNegotiate a debt settlement to pay less than you owe and close the account for good.\n\nIgnore the debt (but this isnât recommended because it comes with serious consequences).\n\nOption 1: Dispute the Debt\n\nIf Revco Solutions validates the debt but you disagree with any detail of the debt, itâs your right to dispute it. For example, you might agree you owe the debt but you disagree with the amount they say you owe. Or, maybe you donât owe the debt at all, and they got the account holder's information wrong.\n\nIf you file a debt dispute, itâs smart to check your credit report, too. If a debt collector has incorrect information, thereâs a good chance that they reported that information to the major credit bureaus. And if that happens, it can hurt your credit score.\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you the right to dispute credit report errors. To dispute a credit report error, send a 609 letter to any of the major credit report bureaus â Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.Â\n\nRegardless of what happens with your account with Revco, medical debts shouldnât appear on your credit report unless theyâre greater than $500 and older than one year.\n\nOption 2: Negotiate the Debt and Make a Settlement Offer\n\nPaying the debt in full is the simplest way to handle it and leave your debt in the past. But many people with big medical bills canât afford to do that. If this sounds like you, remember that you can try to negotiate a settlement offer. If youâre successful, you may end up paying just 40% to 60% of the original amount.\n\nWhy are debt collectors open to negotiations? They donât get paid unless you pay them. So they are motivated to figure out how to get paid and close the account. This often means that theyâre willing to accept less than the full amount.\n\nTo find out more on how to complete these negotiations, check out Upsolveâs Guide to Beating Revco Solutions.\n\nCan You Negotiate Every Past-Due Debt?\n\nYou canât negotiate all consumer debts, but itâs quite common to negotiate medical debt and healthcare bills. Additionally, past-due personal loans, utility bills, and credit card debt are also often negotiable. You can even negotiate past-due tax debt with the IRS.\n\nThat said, some debt isnât usually negotiable. Home mortgages and car loans are two common examples of non-negotiable debt. These debts are backed by property that the lender can take back if you donât pay the loan, which is why lenders arenât typically motivated to negotiate.\n\nAdditionally, federal student loan debt isnât usually negotiable. If youâre struggling to pay your student debt, check out student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nOption 3: Ignore the Debt (Not Recommended)\n\nIgnoring the debt is theoretically an option, but itâs not a good idea. It can lead to bigger problems and even more stress in the long run.\n\nWhat Happens if I Ignore Revco Solutions?\n\nDebt collectors like Revco donât give up easily. If you ignore a debt collection agency, your credit score will likely suffer and your debt may actually increase as interest and fees are added.Â\n\nWorst-case scenario: You could be sued and have your wages garnished. Debt collectors can sue you as long as the statute of limitations hasnât expired for the debt.Â\n\nThis may feel unnerving, but you have more power here than you might think! Many debt collection tactics rely on consumers not knowing or exercising their rights. By reading this article, youâve put yourself in a better position to identify improper debt collection efforts or negotiate a debt settlement agreement.Â\n\nYou can find out more about your options by reading Upsolveâs Guide to Beating Revco Solutions.\n\nCan Revco Solutions Sue Me?\n\nItâs possible for Revco Solutions to sue you. They probably wonât though, because most of the debts they try to collect belong to the original creditor. If you do get sued, the lawsuit will likely come from the original creditor, not Revco.Â\n\nWhen deciding whether to sue a consumer, debt collectors usually consider factors such as:\n\nHow expensive the lawsuit will be\n\nHow much you owe\n\nHow old the debt isÂ\n\nHow easy or difficult it will be for them to get a wage garnishment order\n\nIf you get sued, youâll probably get served with a copy of the complaint and summons by mail or in person. After you get these court documents, you have a limited amount of time to file a response. Itâs important to respond to the lawsuit or youâll probably lose since you didnât defend yourself.\n\nMany people can answer the summons without hiring a lawyer to help. If you want legal advice, you can use the Legal Serviceâs Corporation search tool to find low-cost or free help near you.\n\nLetâs Summarizeâ¦\n\nRevco Solutions LLC is a legit debt collection agency. If they contact you, theyâre probably trying to collect a past-due healthcare or utility bill from you on behalf of the utility company or healthcare provider. Before you pay anything, itâs good to ask Revco to validate the debt.Â\n\nIf theyâre able to verify the debt, you can decide whether to dispute it, pay it, or try to settle it for less than the original amount. If you ignore the debt collector, you risk lowering your credit score or facing a lawsuit."
