        "text": "Bankrupt Revco D.S. Inc.'s latest prescription for health calls for a $7.5 million payment to Jack Eckerd Corp. in exchange for Eckerd's pledge to shelve its rival reorganization plan indefinitely.\n\nRevco is scheduled to appear in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio, today for a hearing on its disclosure statement, a document similar to a prospectus, a Revco spokesman said yesterday. If judged complete, the disclosure statement and Revco's reorganization plan will be sent to creditors for a vote. The Twinsburg, Ohio-based drugstore chain filed its latest amended plan Wednesday.\n\nThe current schedule calls for creditors to return ballots by March 6 and a confirmation hearing on March 11, the spokesman said.\n\nIf all goes in Revco's favor, it could emerge from bankruptcy in mid-April, he said.\n\nRevco is cautiously optimistic that the court will approve the document, the spokesman said. Both the disclosure statement and the plan have been on file for creditors to review, and few objections have surfaced.\n\n\"At this point in time, everybody is optimistic, but in these situations you can never be confident,\" he said.\n\nThe spokesman noted, however, that because the latest plan was only filed Wednesday, a \"remote\" possibility exists that creditors could submit a last-minute objection and seek to delay the procedure.\n\n\"It's unlikely that anybody would do that,\" he said. \"It's a very remote possibility.\"\n\nThe spokesman also emphasized that Eckerd has postponed its plan, not withdrawn it. In the unlikely event that Eckerd reactivates its plan, it would forfeit the $7.5 million payment. The payment is to cover expenses Eckerd has incurred relating to its reorganization plan. Eckerd also would have to file a motion to reactivate the plan before Revco's plan is confirmed.\n\nEckerd's $7.5 million payment will be funded through the exercise of rights that Revco would issue to its subordinated debt holders. Each right would entitle the holder to purchase one share of new Revco common stock at $7.47 a share.\n\nZell-Chilmark Fund L.P., which has already pledged to buy for cash up to $250 million of common stock that would be issued to creditors under the reorganization plan, has also agreed to buy off common stock issued to fund the Eckerd payment that the subordinated debt holders decide not to purchase.\n\nThe more shares Zell buys, the greater its control over the company, the spokesman said.\n\n\"We believe this action -- which results in an uncontested Revoc plan -- will provide significant savings for Revco and present a realistic opportunity for the company to emerge from bankruptcy at an early date,\" Boake A. Sells, Revco chairman and chief executive officer, said in a release.\n\n\"Confirmation of the Eckerd plan would have resulted in significant additional costs to Eckerd and even further delays in this case,\" Stewart Turley, Eckerd's chairman, said in the release.\n\nRevco filed for Chapter 11 provisions on July 28, 1988, burdened by $1.5 billion of debt resulting from a failed leveraged buyout by former management and other investors.\n\nIn secondary trading the high-yield bonds proved \"surprisingly resilient,\" losing only 1/4 point in light of the equity and Treasury market's declines, a high-yield source said.
