        "text": "TWINSBURG, Ohio -- Revco D.S. Inc. announced an agreement Monday that will hasten its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy by ending litigation against former executives who engineered a leveraged buyout that plunged the drug store chain into bankruptcy.\n\nThe company said it expects the deal to allow it to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of next month.\n\nRevco, crushed by the $1.5 billion debt it took on in the 1986 buyout, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1988.\n\nRevco operates some 1,150 drug stores in nine Eastern states and has annual sales in excess of $1.9 billion.\n\nIts reorganization plan, approved by creditors and the bankruptcy court last month, assigned trade creditors the company's rights to recover damages in pending lawsuits against former Chairman Sidney Dworkin and former Chief Executive Officer William B. Edwards, architects of the LBO that took the company private.\n\nAs a result, Dworkin and Edwards appealed the court's approval of the reorganization plan -- a move that threatened to delay Revco's move out of bankruptcy.\n\nBut the company Monday announced an agreement under which the lawsuit against Dworkin and Edwards, who left Revco in 1987 when the were bought out by a new management group, will be dropped and the two former executives will withdraw their appeals of the order confirming Revco's reorganization plan.\n\nTrade creditors who were to receive any proceeds from the lawsuit will instead share $3.5 million in cash -- to be raised throught he sale of Revco common stock.\n\n'We are pleased that this agreement has been reached. It removes the last roadblock to Revco's emergence from Chapter 11,' said Revco Chairman Boake A. Sells.\n\nWith the withdrawal of appeals, Revco said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in late May, the end of its fiscal year.\n\nRevco filed papers with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio, Monday to modify its reorganization plan and implement the agreement that will end the litigation and the appeal.\n\nThe modification -- which requires only approval by the Bankruptcy Court -- would allow the sale of an additional 468,541 shares of New Common Stock of Revco at $7.47 a share to raise the $3.5 million to be paid to trade creditors.\n\nEighty percent of the new shares will be offered to the three classes of subordinated debt holders as an addition to the rights offering previously confirmed by the court. The remaining 20 percent -- as well as any shares represented by purchase rights not exercised by the subordinated debt holders -- will be purchased by Zell/Chilmark Fund L.P.\n\nA $250 million cash merger agreement signed with Zell/Chillmark in February is the central element of the Revco reorganization plan.\n\nAfter exercise of all purchase rights and the issuance of stock under the Revco Plan, about 36 million shares of common stock will be outstanding."
