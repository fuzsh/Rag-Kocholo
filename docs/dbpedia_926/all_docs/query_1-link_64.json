        "text": "Robin Smith, 62, is an Erie running legend. She started running in the late 1970s and hasn’t stopped since. To date, Robin has 68 – SIXTY EIGHT – marathons under her belt with the first being the Revco-Cleveland Marathon in1984, and the most recent being the Erie Marathon at Presque Isle this past September. She’s even WON the Erie marathon before…twice, actually (1999 and 2001).\n\nShe’s as sweet, kind and gracious as she is fast and has been among my regular Saturday running group/circle of running friends for several years, though we haven’t seen her as much since her retirement as the Board Secretary to the Board of Director of the School District of the City of Erie in June of last year. She and her significant other, Jim, are off on endless adventures – boating and traveling across the country and spending winters in the warmth of the Florida sunshine.\n\nI managed to get Robin to sit still long enough to answer a few questions so we can all learn from her attitude, longevity, and decades of running experience.\n\nWhen did you start running?\n\nIn the late 1970s, I was learning to jump on water skis and was having trouble with my landings because of weak legs. One of the guys in the water ski club, Grant Koehler, told me I needed to strengthen my legs and he suggested doing this by jumping off the picnic table in my backyard or running. Seeing that my neighbors already questioned by sanity, I chose to run. When I started, I could not even run the whole way around the block. I would only run two days a week for about a month before skiing season started and then quit once competitive skiing started.\n\nThen, in 1982, a co-worker and friend talked me into running the Hamot 10K. We met a couples times a week at the track outside of East High School where we both worked. We ran and finished the race together but I felt I could go faster. At that point, I was hooked.\n\nDo you remember your first run ever?\n\nYes! It was around the block in my Millcreek neighborhood. I couldn’t run the entire ½ mile around it.\n\nYou and your frequent running partner, Cyndie Zahner, are often mistaken for sisters. Heck, I knew you both for at least two years before I realized you two weren’t related. How did you meet Cyndie and how long have you been running together?\n\nI started running with a friend, Patty Hoffman, in 1985 when she lived in Waterford. In 1989, Patty moved into Cyndie’s neighborhood in Millcreek Township and met Cyndie. She introduced us and the three of us ran together for years. Cyndie and I have been running together for twenty-nine years now. We have shared a lot of stories, travels and life events together; it’s been a great run!\n\nWhat was your first marathon? Do you remember your time?\n\nMy first marathon was the Revco-Cleveland Marathon on May 20, 1984, and I finished in 3:38:41. I only know this because I saved my finisher’s certificate. Back then, there were no medals or electronic scoring. Finishers got a paper certificate mailed to them about a month after the race.\n\nWhat made you want to do it?\n\nPatty Hoffman inspired me to run the marathon. The first time I ever saw Patty was at the Gertrude Barber 10K race and Patty won overall in the women’s division and her husband, Bill, won the overall men’s division. I was so impressed that a husband and wife won. We became friends and started running/training together at Presque Isle. She encouraged me to run the marathon. She is not currently running but our friendship remains, even after all these years. Running friends are the best friends.\n\nWhat is your marathon P.R. and when (what year) and where did you set it?\n\nI’m a mom (Ashley, 35; Richard, 25; and Alex, 24) and I feel like I have two P.R.s that I celebrate for different reasons. My first P.R. was a 3:05:10 in 1990 at the Revco-Cleveland Marathon. My second P.R. was seven years later, in November of 1997, at the Columbus Marathon where I had a 3:05:58. The Columbus P.R. had significant meaning to me because it was after having my sons who were born in 1993 and 1994, and because I was 42 years old. I’d have never expected to run so close to my 1990 P.R.\n\nDid you think then that you would keep doing 26.2 for decades? Definitely not! I had no idea or plan to keep running them for this long.\n\nWhat makes you keep doing marathons? What do you like about them?\n\nI like the camaraderie, the marathon expos, the excuse/opportunity to travel with friends, the need to push myself, the feeling of accomplishment when you finish, and so much more.\n\nThings have SURE changed since you first started doing the marathon, right? I remember that we didn't even have Gu (or anything similar) 15 years ago. What do you think has been the best change?\n\nChip timing! Love that your toe doesn’t have to be right on the starting line to get your finish time especially in large races because it can take you a long time to get there.\n\nWhat's your most memorable marathon ever?\n\nI’ll never forget or enjoy a marathon so much as I did when I ran the Baltimore Marathon in October of 2013 with Jessie Zahner, her mom, Cyndie Zahner, LeAnn Parmenter, and you. It was Jessie’s first marathon and Cyndie had made me promise years before that if any one of her kids or my kids decided to run a marathon, she and I would run with them. I was so proud of Jessie for completing her first marathon. It was LeAnn’s first 26.2, too!\n\nWhat marathon offered the best scenery/course?\n\nI loved the course in New York City best because of the history of the race and running through the five boroughs. The enthusiasm of the people of New York is unbelievable. There’s just a ton of energy from the crowd watching the runners.\n\nWhat marathon would you recommend to anyone?\n\nI would recommend two – Boston, it is a classy race and one that is probably on every runner’s to-do-list, but because of the BQ qualifying requirements, not everyone can get into this race so I’d also reccommend the New York City Marathon. It was a very organized races for being the largest marathons in the world. I hope to run it a second time.\n\nDo you ever hit the wall? How do you get past it?\n\nYes! I’ve hit it several times. Usually I can make it to 20 miles and not feel too bad but on a bad day it can come as early as 15 miles. I then break the run in to segments—10 miles to go, a 10K, a 5K, 2 miles—I tell myself anyone can do 2 miles. I talk myself through it. You have to keep thinking positive thoughts.\n\nYou don't run with music...so what do you think about, i.e. how do you occupy your mind? Do you have any mantras you repeat?\n\nSometimes I will run with music but not very often. I like to experience the people around me and the scenery/course. I like to be aware of my surroundings. My mind kind of wanders sometimes about what I need to do that day, what I want to do that week, how many miles I have to go yet, what I’m going to cook for dinner…lol…random thoughts…pep talks – you got this, positive energy.\n\nHow much of marathoning is mental? How did you improve your mental game?\n\nI think the only way to improve your mental game is to keep your thoughts and self-talk positive. It’s all about your perspective and not losing sight of what you set out to accomplish.\n\nWhat is your favorite post-race treat?\n\nChocolate milk.\n\nAny marathon rituals? Any things you always do before a 26.2?\n\nNo real rituals except for eating carbs and drinking lots of water about two days before the marathon.\n\nYou've done 68 marathons so far. Do you have a number in mind for how many you want to do?\n\nNot really, I just hope to keep going until I can’t. One of these days I’m going to have to downsize to the half-marathon distance.\n\nWhat marathon is on your marathon bucket list? Boston and New York were at the top, and I already crossed those off. At this point, I don’t have a marathon bucket list, but I have always thought I’d love to run the Big Sur Marathon along Highway 1 in California. The problem is that I hate hills, so I don’t know how that is going to work out for me.\n\nWhat advice do you have for new marathoners?\n\nEnjoy your first marathon! Run it with your only goal being to finish it. Just completing a marathon is an accomplishment. You want your first experience to be a positive one. If you set a time goal and don’t make it in your first marathon, you may get discouraged and may never want to run another one. Have no expectations other than to finish and you will not be disappointed.\n\nWhat have you learned the hard way?\n\nDon’t run a marathon when you ran only one long run of 15 miles.\n\nWhat was your worst marathon experience? How did you get past that and do another one?\n\nMy worst marathon experience was at the Pittsburgh Marathon when the start of the race was 80 degrees and climbing. It was a race where you dared not to push yourself. It was difficult but I keep telling myself that everyone in this race was up against the same conditions. You just had to run easy. I was so glad when that race was over. It was easy to push myself past this bad experience because I wanted to run another one under better conditions!\n\nHave you had any significant injuries? To what do you attribute your relatively injury-free running life? (i.e. weight lifting, rest days, etc.?\n\nI have had little aches and pains over the years - plantar fasciitis, groin, knee issues. My chiropractor, Dr. Dan Young can attest to all of them. My most significant injuries were caused by accidents, mostly broken toes, but not from running, ironically. Most of my broken toes were from silly things like dropping a plate on my foot, running into toys in a dark room, slipping on a wet floor, falling off a step ladder….it’s safer for me to run. I will also say that never really had super high mileage, always take two days off a week, and I cross train — lifting weights and cycling. I attribute my mostly-injury-free running years to just being lucky.\n\nWhat would you do if you couldn't run anymore?\n\nCycle.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you're not running?\n\nBoating, baking (anything sweet) and cooking, shopping, downhill skiing, biking, paddle boarding, and spoiling my grandchildren.\n\nWhat is the best thing about running? What do you love most about it? It’s great exercise, mentally and physically. All you really need is a cute running skort and a good pair of sneakers. I love the way I feel after a morning run—that feeling of accomplishment is a great way to begin your day. No matter what happens the rest of the day, if I get my run in, I can conquer anything.\n\nHeather Cass is an Erie-area freelance writer, runner, and active member of the Erie Runners Club for 20-plus years.
