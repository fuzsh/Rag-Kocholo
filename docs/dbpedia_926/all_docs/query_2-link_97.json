Introduction In December 1986 the management of Revco D.S. and a group of investors took the company private in a leveraged buyout (LB0). Revco was the operator of the largest chain of discount drug stores in the United States. The buyers paid a 48 percent premium for the shares compared to the price in January 1986, before the announcement of plans for the buyout. In addition to the large acquisition premium, this buyout arrested tj1e attention of investors and analysts because of its unusual financing terms. Goldman Sachs advising the board of directors, had declared that the purchase · price was \"fair.\" Salomon Brothers, advising the buyout group, had designed the transaction and employed its considerable bond-trading muscle to promote it-indeed, this was Salomon's first major \"done deal\" acting simultaneously as buyout advisor, underwriter, and merchant banker. On the other hand, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agencies, declared Revco's LBO to have a \"negative outlook\" and downgraded their ratings of Revco's public bonds to \"speculative\" categories. Analysts noted that debt repayment in the first few years depended significantly on asset sales, an especially uncertain source of cash. More importantly, the operating performance of the firm had been declining over recent quarters. 1.1. The Company In 1986 Revco was the nation's largest discount drugstore chain, operating 2,049 stores in 30 states. Fiscal 1986 sales were $2.7 billion with after-tax profits of $56.9 million. Revco was formed in 1956 and utilized the marketing concept of \"every-day, low prices,\" a concept still in use in 1986. Strip centers in small cities were the primary location of Revco stores, with approximately 70 percent of the company's stores located in cities with a population of less than 25,000. Over the previous 5 years, the number of stores had grown at an annual compound rate of 6.24 percent, from 1,514 stores in 1981. The average cost of opening a new store was approximately $300,000, with inventory comprising approximately $200,000 of this tota1. 1.2. Competition Revco competed with health maintenance organizations, hospital pharmacies, mail-order organizations, discount drugstores, combination food-and-drug stores, mass .merchandisers, and the rapidly emerging \"deep discount\" drugstores. Deep discounters were large \"super\" drug stores relying on volume to compensate for the unusually low prices they charged. Consequently, deep discount drugstores were located primarily in cities with populations over 250,000 and were not seen as a major threat to Revco. The drugstore industry exhibited little cyclicality since most sales were necessity items and few substitute products existed. 1.3. Origin and Terms of the Buyout Since April 1984 chief executive officer and chairman of the board Sidney Dworkin had been concerned with' possible takeover threats following a series of highly publicized mishaps at Revco. Revco's common stock price had not recovered from the negative impact of these adversities. Rumours of an impending hostile takeover attempt on Revco had ebbed through the financial Page 1 of 44\n\n7. community in 1984, 1985, and 1986. On March 11, 1986, Dworkin struck first by submitting a buyout proposal to Revco's board of directors, He later raised the offer price to a cash payment of $38.50 per share. The board accepted tho offer on August 15. The buyout closed on December 29, 1986. The buyout would require nearly $1.5 billion, to be placed through the issuance of nine different classes of securities, the bulk of them being debt and preferred stock. Salomon Brothers, the buyout group's investment banker and a part-equity owner, had lined up the required financing from a variety of sources. 1.4. Management of New Revco Once the LBO was completed·, Sidney Dworkin became chairman of the board and Chief executive officer of the \"new\" Revco, the same positions he had held at Reyco D. S. As in the old entity, Dworkin did not control a majority ofthe outstanding shares ofsto.ck; he owned 'about 15.4 percent. However, these shares were subject to a voting trust of which he was a member. Apparently, Mr. Dworkin would have more control in the \"new\" Rcvco than he had had at Rcvco D. S., where his ownership percentage was only 2.32 percent. Dworkin received $29.6 million for the stock and stock options that he held in the old. Revco. He invested about $8 million in the \"new\" Revco. ' 1.5. Strategy and Restructuring Plans If the merger had occurred on June 2, 1985, earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest, and income taxes would have been $161 .8 million for the year ended May 31, 1986, just sufficient to cover pro-forma interest expense-of $155 million. Revco managers believed that the company's results since the beginning of fiscal 1985 were not indicative of future prospects and that Revco's performance in 1987 and beyond would be more in line with pre-1985 results. Nevertheless, because the interest-coverage ·ratio would be very low, management adopted a program to increase the margin of safety. Elements of the program included the following: Focus on drugstore business. Management planned to divest virtually Revco’s entire nondrugstore businesses plus 100 drugstores, thus permitting management to concentrate on expanding its drugstore operations and improving drugstore gross margins and profitability. Management had earmarked $230 million in assets for sale by the end of June 1987 and had, in principle, reached agreements to sell $89 million of those assets by the time the company went private. At least four months would be needed to consummate these agreements. First, management devised a divestiture program to dispose of all of the non-drugstore subsidiaries. The credit agreement with the major banks called for Revco to make principal payments in 1987, 1988, and 1989, that would reduce the term loan to $150 million from $455 million. Of the $305 million In payments, $255 million were expected to occur through the divestiture program. Duff & Phelps had been engaged to value Revco's seven subsidiaries, and an analysis dated October 17, 1986 estimated the aggregate market value of these subsidiaries at $224.5 million. Book value of these subsidiaries was $178 million. · Expand. Future expansion plans included opening or acquiring approximately 100 stores per year over the subsequent five years. This expansion would be financed by working capital from operations. Most of this expansion was to be in small communities. Management believed that Revco's presence Page 2 of 44\n\n8. in prime locations in these small markets discouraged entry by other large drugstore chains. In addition; the small size of the market tended to bar entry for deep discount stores, which generally required a larger population base to support profitable operations. Reduce capital expenditures. Because approximately 75 percent of all Revco drugstores either were new or had been remodeled since the beginning of fiscal I 981, management believed that Revco's program of remodeling its existing stores could be implemented each year within a modest budget. Reduce inventory and selling expense. As part of its efforts to increase Revco's profitability, management implemented an inventory-reduction program, which was to be substantially completed by the end offiscal1987. Assuming a ratio of inventory-to-sales consistent with past · experience, management anticipated that inventory levels would be reduced by approximately $129 million from the levels that would otherwise exist. In addition, management initiated a program designed to reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses by approximately $24 million during 1987 from the levels that would otherwise have existed. Maintain current marketing strategy. Management would continue to build on two of Revco's fundamental strengths: its many convenient locations and its \"everyday low prices\" pricing strategy. Dworkin believed that these two strengths would continue to frame consumers' perceptions of Revco as a convenience drugstore, selling quality products at low prices at all times. Increase sales of non-prescription items. Revco's merchandising and marketing strategy was to maintain its strong prescription sales as the company\" increased sales of and improved margins on non-prescription items. This would entail rearranging store layouts to draw the customer through aisles of non-prescription items as the customer proceeded to the drug counter. Non-prescription merchandise would include; lawn furniture, kitchen appliances, small consumer electronic items, etc. 1.6. Outlook Sales for the stub period (from the closing on December 26, 1986 to the next fiscal year end, May 31, 1987) were expected to be about $990 million, resulting in an operating profit of about $47 million. This would leave an operating profit of$147 million for the 1987 fiscal year ending May 31, modestly higher than for 1986's operating profit of $125 million. In making their assessments of the transaction, outside analysts considered historical financial performance (Exhibits 1 and 2), projected financial performance (Exhibits 3 and 4), information on comparable companies (Exhibit 5), and current capital market rates and indices (Exhibit 6). Analysts identified a number of key assumptions: Growth rate of sales per store: The forecast assumed 6 percent annual growth in sales per store, reflecting an anticipated 5 percent inflation rate and a 1 percent real growth rate. Analysts wondered about the appropriateness of the real-growth-rate assumption, especially given the very low (or even negative) population growth rates in small communities. Cost of goods sold (COGS)/sales: The forecast assumed Revco's 5-year historical average, 73 percent. Analysts compared Revco with other drug retailers, whose COGS/sales ratio averaged 71 percent (see Exhibit 5). Acknowledging the difficulty of achieving a 1 percentage point improvement in this ratio (especially with a policy of discount pricing, analysts wondered whether Dworkin could Page 3 of 44\n\n9. realize some economics following the buyout. Selling, general, and administrative expenses/sales: The forecast assumed Revco's 5 year historical average of 20.8 percent, as opposed to an industry average of23.6 percent. Analysts also wondered whether economies were possible in this area. Timing of asset sales: Consistent with Dworkin's plan (and bankers' expectations), the forecast assumed the sale of $230 million in assets in 1988. However any softening in the acquisitions market might delay the sale until 1989 or even 1990. Timing and volume of new store openings: The forecast assumed that Revco would open 100 new stores each year for the next five years and would then stop expanding as the target market became saturated. Some analysts questioned Dworkin's ambitious store-opening plans, especially in light of Revco's high leverage. Dworkin countered that the next few years offered a temporary window to gain dominance in certain markets, and that the cash-flow growth afforded by this expansion would assist in the amortization of debt and boost returns to the equity investors. 1.7. Comparative Analysis Analysts considered the experience of another major drug store retailer, Jack –Eckerd Corporation, which had been taken private in an LBO in April 1986. In most respects the two companies were quite similar: Eckerd had been taken private, however, at a multiple of only 21.3 times, compared with Revco's 24.8 times earnings. Eckerd was also financed at a debt-equity ratio of 11.5 times, compared with Revco's 37.6 times. Exhibit 7 presents a forecast of how well Revco and Eckcrd could cover their financial obligations in the next three years, the period over which analysts perceived the greatest possible risk of default. For each company, the financial obligations included interest expense, principal payments, and preferred stock dividend payments. The \"coverage'' of these obligations was estimated as a multiple compared with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); and \"cash flow,\" which consisted of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBlTDA) plus the receipts from any asset sales less capita expenditures. (Additions to net working capital are ignored in this calculation. Ordinarily they deserve to be included in an analysis like this. Exclusion of this item biases the estimated coverage rates upward. Analysts acknowledged; however that the comparative figure such as those in Exhibit 7 were point estimates and thus ignored the uncertainty surrounding key assumptions. Revco's financial obligations were well known at the .time of the buyout. Thus, the uncertainty about Revco's comparative standing versus Jack Eckerd and other firms devolved from forecast uncertainty about the following points: Interest rates: Revco's senior debt bore interest that floated at 1.75 percent above prime rate, currently at 7.50 percent Asset sales: Revco had to sell assets to .meet its principal payments. One could give Revco the benefit of the doubt and assume that all $230 million would actually be realized. But analysts were uncertain about the timing18 of that realization. By comparison, Jack Eckerd would try to sell $72 million in assets. Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures could be assumed to be driven by Revco's goal of Page 4 of 44\n\n10. opening 100 stores per year at an investment of$1 00,000 per store. Depreciation could be approximated as $20 million for 1987, and thereafter scaled according to the percentage net change of the difference between asset sales and capital expenditures. By contrast, Jack Eckerd envisioned opening no new stores in the foreseeable future. Eckerd's depreciation was forecasted to be $123 million, a much higher figure than Revco's because Eckerd tended to own, rather than lease, its 'stores. Growth: Salomon Brothers contemplated a sales-growth rate no lower than 8 percent; it presented forecasts to commercial bankers that assumed growth at 12 percent. Goldman Sachs, the advisor to Revco's outside directors, determined that a 12 percent growth rate assumption was \"too aggressive.\" Analysts assumed sales growth of mature stores to be equal to the rate of inflation. In addition, \"the net growth from opening new stores would yield an annual corporate growth rate of 9 percent. · EBIT margin: From 1974to 1986, Revco's mean EBIT margin was 6.62 percent (standard deviation was 1.32 percent). The mean and standard deviation for Jack Eckerd Corporation were 8.11 and 1.42 percent, respectively; a sample of peer companies over the same period indicated that the mean and standard deviation were 5.15 and 1.25 percent, respectively. Salomon Brothers assumed an EBIT margin of 8.0 percent. Goldman Sachs opined that this assumption was \"a bit aggressive.\" Only once over the past 13 years did Revco reach that level, in 1984; thereafter Revco's EBIT margin fell to 3.50 and 4.84 percent. Sales growth and EBIT margin depended in part on the rate at which Revco planned to open new stores analysts challenged the wisdom of this strategy, noting that 70 percent of Revco's stores that had been open for less than one year lost money; the figure dropped to 48 percent for stores Analysts were unable to decide whether to assume any covariance between growth and margins and generally assumed that each year was an independent draw: i.e., that there was no serial covariance in the forecast assumptions that had been open from one to two years. 1.8. Capital Adequacy Leveraged buyouts were very difficult to, evaluate. Typically the prospective return to creditors and investors were quite high, but were they high enough to compensate for the risk involved? Ultimately the decision of whether to invest or lend in these deals hinged on some Judgment about the likelihood that the buyout firm would survive a arduous financial demand. This judgment necessarily entailed some analysis of the adequacy of the firm's capitalization. The adequacy of Revco's capitalization after the LBO could be judged in several ways. First, one could test whether, at the time that Revco went private, the market value of Revco's assets was greater than the value of Revco's liabilities. This was the classic test of bankrupt firms. If assets were worth less than the face value of liabilities, the creditors would be handed ownership of the firm; but those who used this approach confronted a number of challenging valuations questions. Most importantly, this valuation approach said nothing about the adequacy of capitalization where assets were worth a little more than the face value of liabilities. The key question how much debt could or should the firm carry was poorly answered by the bankruptcy test. A second approach would be to compare Revco's capitalization ratios (e.g. debt/equity) with those of other firms that had gone private in leveraged buyouts and with peer firms. In response to this suggestion, one scholar wrote: ... widely used rules of thumb which evaluate debt capacity in terms of some percentage of balance Page 5 of 44\n\n11. sheet values or in terms of income statement ratios can be seriously misleading and even dangerous to corporate solvency .. debt policy in gene.ral and debt capacity in particular cannot be prescribed for individual company by outsiders or by generalized standards; rather, they can and should be determined by management in terms of individual corporate circumstances and objectives and on the basis of observed behavior of cash flows. To focus on \"the observed behavior of cash fows\" meant asking this question: under the existing capital structure, how likely was Revco to default on servicing its liabilities? If the probability of default were high, one might judge that Revco was too dependent on debt financing and should alter the mix away from debt and toward equity. If the probability of default were extremely low, this analysis would suggest that Revco could bear additional debt. 2. Business Analysis There are a number of generic business techniques that a Business Analyst will use when facilitating business change. 2.1. PESTEL This is used to perform an external environmental analysis by examining the many different external factors affecting an organization. It never ceases to amaze me why so many businesses fail to take the time to look at the macro and the micro environments when completing their business plans and strategies. These external forces will play a big part in shaping the final outcome of the ultimate corporate achievement. Yet, most managers’ focus only on internal factors and it is fair to say that sales growth and profits remain high on their agenda. The macro environment tends to have a long term impact and requires extensive research. Couple this with the fact that many managers are over worked and under resourced and we begin to see why the process is often not completed. There is no published evidence to confirm this hypothesis, just anecdotal hearsay. The remainder of this article will illustrate an example of a Macro or PESTLE analysis for the pharmaceutical industry. It is set at a very general level but it can be used as a template or adapted to be more specific if required: The six attributes of PESTLE: Political (Current and potential influences from political pressures) Economic (The local, national and world economy impact) Sociological (The ways in which a society can affect an organization) Technological (The effect of new and emerging technology) Legal (The effect of national and world legislation) Environmental (The local, national and world environmental issues) Page 6 of 44\n\n12. Political There is now growing political focus and pressure on healthcare authorities across the world. This means that governments will be looking for savings across the board. Some of the questions the industry should ask are: What pressures will be put on pricing? What services will be cut? Will the same selection of drugs be available to everyone? In addition to this, could there be more harmonization of healthcare systems across Europe or the USA? What impact will reforms have on insurance models? Economic The global economic crisis still exists yet government reports still show that the spend on healthcare per capital continues to grow. Will the current healthcare models exist tomorrow? The growth in homecare (as seen in the Nutrition sector) demonstrates how nursing services have moved to the private sector and have become a key business offering. The reduction in consumer disposable income will have an impact on those countries using health insurance models particularly where part payment is required. These economic pressures are seeing an increased growth in strategic buying groups who are forcing down prices. Increased pressure from shareholders has caused a consolidation of the industry: more mergers and acquisitions will take place over the coming years. Social / Culture The increasing aging population offers a range of opportunities and threats to the pharmaceutical industry. The trick will be to capitalize on the opportunities. There is also the problem of the increasing obesity amongst the population and its associated health risks. Patients and home carers are becoming more informed. Their expectations have changed and they have become more demanding. Public activism has also increased through the harnessing of new social networking technologies. How can pharmaceutical companies get closer to consumers without over stepping the regulatory boundaries? Technological Technological advancements will create new business prospects both in terms of new therapy systems and service provisions. The online opportunities will see the growth in: New info and Communications technologies. Social Media for Healthcare. Customized Treatments. Page 7 of 44\n\n13. Direct to Patient Advertising. Direct to patient communications. Legislation The pharmaceutical industry has many regulatory and legislative restrictions. There is also a growing culture of litigation in many countries. The evolution of the internet is also stretching the legislative boundaries with patient’s demanding more rights in their healthcare programmes. Environmental There is a growing environmental agenda and the key stake holders are now becoming more aware of the need for businesses to be more proactive in this field. Pharma companies need to see how their business and marketing plans link in with the environmental issues. There is also an opportunity to incorporate it within their Corporate Social Responsibility programmes. Marketing and new product development should identify eco opportunities to promote as well.

HEPTALYSIS Page 8 of 44\n\n14. This is used to perform an in-depth analysis of early stage businesses/ventures on seven important categories: Market opportunity In 1986 Revco was the nation's largest discount drugstore chain, operating 2,049 stores in 30 states. Fiscal 1986 sales were $2.7 billion with after-tax profits of $56.9 million. Revco was formed in 1956 and utilized the marketing concept of \"every-day, low prices,\" a concept still in use in 1986. Strip centers in small cities were the primary location of Revco stores, with approximately 70 percent of the company's stores located in cities with a population of less than 25,000. The company is still holding 6.25% growth rate per annum, which suggests that it has a good opportunity in the market to expand. Product/solution Revco competed with health maintenance organizations, hospital pharmacies, mail-order organizations, discount drugstores, combination food-and-drug stores, mass merchandisers, and the rapidly emerging \"deep discount\" drugstores. Execution plan Management would continue to build on two of Revco's fundamental strengths: its many convenient locations and its \"everyday low prices\" pricing strategy. It is believed by the authority of the company that these two strengths would continue to frame consumers' perceptions of Revco as a convenience drugstore, selling quality products at low prices at all times. Financial engine Future expansion plans included opening or acquiring approximately 100 stores per year over the subsequent five years. This expansion would be financed by working capital from operations. Most of this expansion was to be in small communities. Management believed that Revco's presence in prime locations in these small markets discouraged entry by other large drugstore chains. In addition; the small size of the market tended to bar entry for deep discount stores, which generally required a larger population base to support profitable operations. Human capital The forecast assumed Revco's 5 year historical average of 20.8 percent, as opposed to an industry average of23.6 percent. Analysts also wondered whether economies were possible in this area. Potential return Sales for the stub period (from the closing on December 26, 1986 to the next fiscal year end, May 31, 1987) were expected to be about $990 million, resulting in an operating profit of about $47 million. This would leave an operating profit of$147 million for the 1987 fiscal year ending May 31, modestly higher than for 1986's operating profit of $125 million. Page 9 of 44\n\n15.

SWOT This is used to help focus activities into areas of strength and where the greatest opportunities lie. This is used to identify the dangers that take the form of weaknesses and both internal and external threats. The four attributes of SWOT analysis: Strengths - What are the advantages? What is currently done well? (e.g. key area of best- performing activities of your company) Weaknesses - What could be improved? What is done badly? (e.g. key area where you are performing poorly) Opportunities - What good opportunities face the organization? (e.g. key area where your competitors are performing poorly) Threats - What obstacles does the organization face? (e.g. key area where your competitor will perform well) Page 10 of 44\n\n16. Strengths The strengths of the pharmaceutical industry’s SWOT analysis document the internal industry components that are providing value, quality goods and services and overall excellence. The internal industry components can include physical resources, human capital or features the industry can control. For example, the pharmaceutical industry’s strengths could include low operating overhead, firm fiscal management, low staff turnover, high return on investment (ROI), state-of-the-art laboratory equipment and an experienced research staff. Weaknesses The weaknesses of the pharmaceutical industry’s SWOT analysis document the internal industry components that are not providing significant added value or are in need of improvement. The internal industry components can include physical resources, human capital or features the industry can control. For example, the pharmaceutical industry’s weaknesses could include high-risk business modeling, disengaged Board of Directors, dated medical equipment, poor branding, low staff morale or diseconomies of scale. Opportunities The opportunities of the pharmaceutical industry’s SWOT analysis document the external industry components that provide a chance for the industry (or factions of the industry) to grow in some capacity or gain a competitive edge. The external industry components should be environmental factors or aspects outside the industry’s control, yet reflective of the business marketplace. For example, the pharmaceutical industry’s opportunities could include recently published research, an increase in health-conscious consumers, increased demand for pharmaceutical products, changes in Food and Drug Administration standards or decreases in employee health care costs. Threats The threats of the pharmaceutical industry’s SWOT analysis document the external industry components that could create an opportunity for the industry (or factions of the industry) to decline, atrophy or lose some competitive edge. The external industry components should be environmental factors or aspects outside the industry’s control, yet reflective of the business marketplace. For example, the pharmaceutical industry’s threats could include increased government regulation, a declining economy, increasing research and development (R&D) costs or a decrease in the global population.

Porter’s Five Forces Model Threats of entry posed by new or potential competitors – LOW High barriers to entry; the company needs to put a lot of capital into research and development, lengthy approval process, marketing before it is able to receive any returns. The ―big Pharma‖ companies that were able to build global operations are benefiting from economies of scale in terms of manufacturing. They are able to access low-cost supplies, as a result. Challenging regulatory conditions (hurdles to get FDA drug approvals for new products); industry is highly regulated which to some extend protects from new competition. The FDA approvals appear to have slowed during 2007. This could be one measure indicating that the FDA is taking a more cautious position on new drug approvals. In addition, legislative changes in the upcoming years may have a negative impact for the industry. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from continuation of U.S. employer-based health coverage. Customers buy medication that was prescribed by the doctors. Patent expirations may lead to an entry of new competitors (generic competitions), resulting in decreased revenues. High rates of patent expirations are approaching in 2010 through 2012. The ability of a pharmaceutical company to offset loss of revenue from patent expirations depends on growth in existing products as well as successful execution from the new product pipeline. Degree of rivalry among existing firms - HIGH Mature, consolidating, highly competitive industry (many large pharmaceutical acquisitions closed in Page 12 of 44\n\n18. 2007 including AstraZeneca’s $15.6Bn purchase of Medlmmune Inc. and Schering-Plough’s $15Bn acquisition of Organon BioSciences). Strong credit profiles: companies operate off of high margins (high 70%), healthy balance sheets, and good liquidity Industry benefits from strong demand from consumers. Weak, small companies usually go out of business (bankruptcy) if they have no potential ―blockbuster‖ in future pipeline. Others that have some significant research or valuable assets will be bought by big and strong pharmaceutical companies. Bargaining power of suppliers - LOW Suppliers generally have little room for negotiation. Large pharmaceutical companies generally enjoy significant buying power. They can dictate the price they want to buy or take their business elsewhere. Bargaining power of buyers - LOW Generally consumers have very little bargaining power. Most of the medication is prescribed by the doctors. Consumers will have to buy the drug at any given price if they need it. More educated consumers may buy a generic alternative (which have the same impact but less expensive) if available on the market. Pricing pressure – The U.S. remains one of the few developed markets where drug manufacturers have significant pricing flexibility, and this is in jeopardy due to increasing pressures from consumers and legislators to control health care costs. Governments in other markets are generally the primary customers, and therefore, enjoy substantial pricing leverage. Shareholders continue to pressure the companies for increases in the share repurchase programs. The companies looking for ways to increase shareholders returns partly because the industry is approaching maturity and is not growing as rapidly, and because many companies have a lot of cash on their balance sheet. Closeness of substitute products – MEDIUM Customers can find substitute medicine if the original product has an expired patent. However, if it is a new product the consumer generally will have no choice for an alternative. Over the few years generic drug manufacturers face excellent opportunities for utilization and volume trends. Generic companies are increasing focused on establishing global operations in order to achieve a lower-cost of supplies, thus posing even more threat to non-generic drug manufacturers. Summery Based on Porter’s model LOW to MEDIUM forces are present among the strong players in the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, the industry is attractive to investors largely due to the high-barriers to entry, purchasing and pricing power, and strong credit profiles of existing firms. Page 13 of 44\n\n19.

SCRS The SCRS approach in Business Analysis claims that the analysis should flow from the high level business strategy to the solution, through the current state and the requirements. The SCRS is standing for: Strategy If the merger had occurred on June 2, 1985, earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest, and income taxes would have been $161 .8 million for the year ended May 31, 1986, just sufficient to cover pro-forma interest expense-of $155 million. Revco managers believed that the company's results since the beginning of fiscal 1985 were not indicative of future prospects and that Revco's performance in 1987 and beyond would be more in line with pre-1985 results. Nevertheless, because the interest-coverage ratio would be very low, management adopted a program to increase the margin of safety. Current State In 1986 Revco was the nation's largest discount drugstore chain, operating 2,049 stores in 30 states. Fiscal 1986 sales were $2.7 billion with after-tax profits of $56.9 million. Revco was formed in 1956 and utilized the marketing concept of \"every-day, low prices,\" a concept still in use in 1986. Strip centers in small cities were the primary location of Revco stores, with approximately 70 percent of the company's stores located in cities with a population of less than 25,000. Over the previous 5 years, the number of stores had grown at an annual compound rate of 6.24 percent, from 1,514 stores in 1981. The average cost of opening a new store was approximately $300,000, with inventory comprising approximately $200,000 of this total. Page 14 of 44\n\n20. Requirements The company has to mandate the following requirements: Focus on drugstore business Expand Reduce capital expenditures Reduce inventory and selling expense Maintain current marketing strategy Increase sales of non-prescription items Solution Summary Strategy- increase the margin of safety Current State- High growth rate, expanded Solution SCR market, openin g new drugstores Requirements- Focus on drugstoer, expand, redu ce capital expenditure, maintain current market strategy etc. Page 15 of 44\n\n21. 3. Time Series Ratio Analysis of Revco D.S. Inc. The value of a firm is determined by its profitability and growth. Ratio analysis is used to evaluate relationships among financial statement items. The ratios are used to identify trends over time for one company or to compare two or more companies at one point in time. Financial statement ratio analysis focuses on three key aspects of a business: liquidity, profitability, and solvency. The objective of ratio analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the firm's policies in each of these areas. Time series analysis accounts for the fact that data points taken over time may have an internal structure (such as autocorrelation, trend or seasonal variation) that should be accounted for. In the time series ratio analysis of Revco, we have calculated the following ratios  Profitability ratio,  Liquidity ratio,  Debt Management ratio,  Efficiency ratio and some other ratios. 3.1. Profitability Ratio: Profitability ratios measure a company's operating efficiency, including its ability to generate income and therefore, cash flow. Cash flow affects the company's ability to obtain debt and equity financing. Ratios we have considered here are-  Profit margin. The profit margin ratio, also known as the operating performance ratio, measures the company's ability to turn its sales into net income. To evaluate the profit margin, it must be compared to competitors and industry statistics. It is calculated by dividing net income by net sales.  The return on assets ratio (ROA) is considered an overall measure of profitability. It measures how much net income was generated for each $1 of assets the company has. ROA is a combination of the profit margin ratio and the asset turnover ratio. It can be calculated separately by dividing net income by average total assets or by multiplying the profit margin ratio times the asset turnover ratio.  The return on common stockholders' equity (ROE) measures how much net income was earned relative to each dollar of common stockholders' equity. It is calculated by dividing net income by average common stockholders' equity. In a simple capital structure (only common stock outstanding), average common stockholders' equity is the average of the beginning and ending stockholders' equity. Profitability ratio of Revco: a) Net profit margin Page 16 of 44\n\n22. b) Return on asset ratio c) Return on equity We see- Revco's profit margin in the year 1986 has decreased and according to their projection the decreasing trend of profitability will continue upto 1991. 3.2. Liquidity Ratio: Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to repay its short-term debts and meet unexpected cash needs. Ratios we have considered here are- The current ratio is also called the working capital ratio, as working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. This ratio measures the ability of a company to pay Page 17 of 44\n\n23. its current obligations using current assets. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. This ratio indicates the company has more current assets than current liabilities. Different industries have different levels of expected liquidity. Whether the ratio is considered adequate coverage depends on the type of business, the components of its current assets, and the ability of the company to generate cash from its receivables and by selling inventory. Cash ratio which indicates cash adequacy in hand in terms of current liabilities. Liquidity ratio of Revco: The liquidity ratio of Revco also indicating the liquidity shortfall in the projected years though the company showed an increment of liquidity in the year1986. 1. Debt Management Ratio: Debt Management Ratios attempt to measure the firm's use of Financial Leverage and ability to avoid financial distress in the long run. These ratios are also known as Long-Term Solvency Ratios. Debt is called Financial Leverage because the use of debt can improve returns to stockholders in good years and increase their losses in bad years. Debt generally represents a fixed cost of financing to a firm. Thus, if the firm can earn more on assets which are financed with debt than the cost of servicing the debt then these additional earnings will flow through to the stockholders. Moreover, our tax law favors debt as a source of financing since interest expense is tax deductible. With the use of debt also comes the possibility of financial distress and bankruptcy. The amount of debt that a firm can utilize is dictated to a great extent by the characteristics of the firm's industry. Firms which are in industries with volatile sales and cash flows cannot utilize debt to the same extent as firms in industries with stable sales and cash flows. Thus, the optimal mix of debt for a firm involves a tradeoff between the benefits of leverage and possibility of financial distress. Ratios we have considered here are- Page 18 of 44\n\n24. Debt Management ratio of Revco: Here we find that the D/E ratio of Revco is indicating Negative D/E ratios in the projected years because we have seen the company's projection says that it will face Net loss from the year 1987 to 1989. 3.3. Efficiency Ratio We have calculated to estimate the company's efficiency by using the total asset turnover ratio. The efficiency ratios indicate that over the historical years, the company's efficiency has decreased, but according to their projection it is indicating that the company's efficiency will increase which may be because of their very high growth rate of projection. Other ratio: Page 19 of 44\n\n25. Sales growth rate shows the scenario of the Revco in this way that the average historical growth rate of Revco is .45% while the projected average growth rate is 10.99% which is very high than the expected growth rate. 4. Cross Sectional Ratio Analysis of Revco D.S. Inco. It is the analysis of a financial ratio of a company with the same ratio of different companies in the same industry. For example, one may conduct a cross-sectional ratio analysis of the debt ratios of multiple companies in the telecommunications industry. Quite simply, one does this by taking the debt ratios of each company and comparing them to one another. An analyst does this in order to find the company with healthiest financial status. Here we see the cross sectional ratio analysis of Revco- I. 1986 Average Sales Growth Rate Big B 17.5 Eckerd Fay's Drug 9.5 Long's Drug 12 Perry Drug 10 Rite Aid 18 Thrifty Walgreen 15.5 13.75 Revco (Historical) -0.449287 Revco (Projected) 10.98726 Revco (Assumed) 73 Here we see that the sales growth rate of Revco is very low than the average industry growth rate in the historical years. Projected years growth rate seems very much inconsistent with its past history. II. 1986 Average D/E Big B 0.22 Eckerd 0.18 Fay's Drug 0.96 Page 20 of 44\n\n26. Long's Drug Perry Drug 1.27 Rite Aid 0.35 Thrifty 1.13 Walgreen 0.12 0.604286 Revco (Historical) 0.853459 Revco (Projected) -27.02621 Here we find that though the past history says D/E ratio of Revco was more than the industry average, but it is expected that the D/E ratio will decrease largely by 270%. III. 1986 Average Beta Big B 1 Eckerd 1 Fay's Drug 1 Long's Drug 0.85 Perry Drug 1.1 Rite Aid 1.15 Thrifty 1.1 Walgreen 1.1 1.0375 Revco 6.68 The cross sectional beta also indicating that the company's Beta is high enough. 5. Bankruptcy Risk The risk that. an individual or especially a company may be unable to service its debts. Bankruptcy risk is greater when the individual or firm has little or no cash flow, or when it manages its assets poorly. Banks assess bankruptcy risk when considering whether to make a loan. It is also called insolvency risk. 5.1. Altman Z-score Page 21 of 44\n\n27. The Z-score formula may be used to predict the probability that a firm will go into bankruptcy within two years. Z-scores are used to predict corporate defaults and an easy-to-calculate control measure for the financial distress status of companies in academic studies. The Z-score uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the financial health of a company. 5.2. Estimation of the formula The Z-score is a linear combination of four or five common business ratios, weighted by coefficients. The coefficients were estimated by identifying a set of firms which had declared bankruptcy and then collecting a matched sample of firms which had survived, with matching by industry and approximate size (assets). Altman applied the statistical method of discriminant analysis to a dataset of publicly held manufacturers. The estimation was originally based on data from publicly held manufacturers, but has since been re-estimated based on other datasets for private manufacturing, non-manufacturing and service companies. The original data sample consisted of 66 firms, half of which had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. All businesses in the database were manufacturers, and small firms with assets of < $1 million were eliminated. 5.3. Accuracy and effectiveness In its initial test, the Altman Z-Score was found to be 72% accurate in predicting bankruptcy two years prior to the event, with a Type II error (false positives) of 6%. In a series of subsequent tests covering three different time periods over the next 31 years (up until 1999), the model was found to be approximately 80–90% accurate in predicting bankruptcy one year prior to the event, with a Type II error (classifying the firm as bankrupt when it does not go bankrupt) of approximately 15–20% (Altman, 2000). In this case, Revco D.S. is a private firm. To assess the bankruptcy risk of this firm we used Altman’s Z- score estimation for private firms. 5.4. Z-score estimated for private firms T1 = (Current Assets − Current Liabilities) / Total Assets T2 = Retained Earnings / Total Assets T3 = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets T4 = Book Value of Equity / Total Liabilities T5 = Sales/ Total Assets Page 22 of 44\n\n28. Z' Score Bankruptcy Model: Z' = 0.717T1 + 0.847T2 + 3.107T3 + 0.420T4 + 0.998T5 Zones of Discrimination: Z' > 2.9 -―Safe‖ Zone 1.23 < Z' < 2. 9 -―Grey‖ Zone Z' < 1.23 -―Distress‖ Zone Items 1986 1987 1988 1989 weights T1 = NWC / Total Assets 0.391 0.226 0.154 0.126 0.717 T2 = Retained Earnings / Total Assets 3.285 -0.265 -0.798 -1.186 0.847 T3 = Earnings Before Interest and 0.127 0.045 0.076 0.084 3.107 Taxes / Total Assets T4 = Book Value of Equity / Total 0.659 -0.006 -0.061 -0.104 0.42 Liabilities T5= Sales / Total Assets 2.779 1.228 1.452 1.580 0.998 Z'Score 6.508016103 1.299204 1.093753 0.879761 A low Z-score indicates a company that is likely to go bankrupt. Specifically, a Z-Score of lower than 1.8, indicates a high likelihood of bankruptcy. From our calculation, we can see that in 1986 Revco was in safe position as its z score was 6.508, which is much higher than 2.9. After that, gradually it was entering distress zone with the passes of years. 6. DuPont Analysis The Du Pont identity breaks down Return on Equity (that is, the returns that investors receive from the firm) into three distinct elements. This analysis enables the analyst to understand the source of superior (or inferior) return by comparison with companies in similar industries (or between industries). The Du Pont identity, however, is less useful for some industries, such as investment banking, that do not use certain concepts or for which the concepts are less meaningful. Variations may be used in certain industries, as long as they also respect the underlying structure of the Du Pont identity. Page 23 of 44\n\n29. High Turnover Industries Certain types of retail operations, particularly stores, may have very low profit margins on sales, and relatively moderate leverage. In contrast, though, groceries may have very high turnover, selling a significant multiple of their assets per year. The ROE of such firms may be particularly dependent on performance of this metric, and hence asset turnover may be studied extremely carefully for signs of under-, or, over-performance. High margin industries Other industries, such as fashion, may derive a substantial portion of their competitive advantage from selling at a higher margin, rather than higher sales. For high-end fashion brands, increasing sales without sacrificing margin may be critical. The Du Pont identity allows analysts to determine which of the elements is dominant in any change of ROE. High leverage industries Some sectors, such as the financial sector, rely on high leverage to generate acceptable ROE. In contrast, however, many other industries would see high levels of leverage as unacceptably risky. Du Pont analysis enables the third party (relying primarily on the financial statements) to compare leverage with other financial elements that determine ROE among similar companies. ROA and ROE ratio Page 24 of 44\n\n30. The return on assets (ROA) ratio developed by DuPont for its own use is now used by many firms to evaluate how effectively assets are used. It measures the combined effects of profit margins and asset turnover. The return on equity (ROE) ratio is a measure of the rate of return to stockholders.[2] Decomposing the ROE into various factors influencing company performance is often called the Du Pont system. ROE = Tax burden x Interest burden x Margin x Turnover x Leverage The DuPont Analysis is important determines what is driving a company's ROE; Profit margin shows the operating efficiency, asset turnover shows the asset use efficiency, and leverage factor shows how much leverage is being used. The method goes beyond profit margin to understand how efficiently a company's assets generate sales or cash and how well a company uses debt to produce incremental returns.

Case Analysis We consider three potential sources of problems for buyout investors. The first is the overall price paid to take the company private. Regardless of the details of the capital structure, or the extent to which there are costs of financial distress, it is clear that investors will earn lower returns as the prices paid increase relative to the fundamental value of company assets. A second potential source of problems is a capital structure that is poorly designed in terms of containing costs of financial distress. Even if the price paid to take a company private is a \"reasonable' multiple of cash flow, a high probability of costly distress will obviously lower the prospective returns to some classes of investors. In evaluating this possibility, it is important to analysis measure of leverage as total debt to capital and interest coverage or cash flow coverage. These measures can provide useful information about the likelihood that a company will be unable to meet its contractual obligations. Among them cash flow coverage ratio is the most appropriate to analyze the capital adequacy of the LBO firm so that it can payout its required cash obligations in the near years. The third and final source of potential problems concerns the incentives of buyout investors. One of the supposed spurs to improved performance in buyouts is the increased equity stake of management. Managers who invest a large portion of their wealth in and own a large percentage of post-buyout equity might be expected to manage better. Conversely, managers who \"cash out\" a large fraction of their pre-buyout equity investment at the time of the buyout may have more of an incentive to take part in overpriced or poorly structured deals. We examine whether these and other incentives changed over time. From the above analysis we can say that from the case and LBO transaction we can develop three problem statements, these are: 1. Was the price paid for the LBO correct? 2. What are the incentives of the buyout investors to enter into such a unusually high levered buyout? 3. Is the firm adequately capitalized after the buyout? 8. Valuation In this part we would like answer some questions. These are- Page 26 of 44\n\n32.  What the firm value of the company is.  Whether the buyout price 1.5 billion dollar is appropriate for this LBO.  Whether the cash offer to stockholder at price 38.5 is appropriate.  What is the probability o survival of the firm and what would be the firm value of Revco after considering distress cost.  Whether the company can generate enough FCFF to pay off its cash obligations.  What will be the return to the equity holder?  Whether the LBO will be successful To answer these questions at first we do valuation using Discounted Cash Flow Method. Following procedures have done to get the firm value. 8.1. Assumptions: For Base Case: cost of goods sold/sales 73% selling,general and administrative expenses/sales 20.80% inventories/sales 20% minimum cash balance $50,000 goodwill amortization $14,056 growth rate of store sales mature stores 6% new stores 6% interest, working capital debt 9.25% interest,cash balance 6% days trade payables 30 other payables (days) 5 depreciation/ gross FA 5% tax rate 36% cost of opening each new store $100,000 new store opening/year 100 year assets divested 1988 Page 27 of 44\n\n33. 8.2. Calculation WACC: To value Revco at first we need to calculate WACC. To do this we have taken cost of equity which is 40.72%, tax rate is 36% Cost of debt is 11.64%. And preferred stock rate is 14.41% and finally we get WACC is 11.40%. Firm Value: Based on the assumptions and WACC we calculate the firm value of the old Revco. Here we have taken two scenarios. The first is base case. Here he have taken the assumptions of the manager of the new revco. And we get the value is 3581079000 dollar. project ed pro forma FY 1987 1988 1989 1990 1993 1994 243614 27029 29929 38846 41176 sales 2317381 3 30 62 12 89 177838 19731 21848 28357 30059 cost of sales 1720525 5 39 62 67 13 72979 80810 10488 11117 gross profit 596856 657759 1 0 45 76 selling, general and administrative 56221 62253 80799 85647 expense 449931 506718 0 6 9 9 depreciation 62318 10530 11030 11530 12970 13352 amortization of leaseholds 8043 8043 8043 8043 8043 amortization of other assets 5048 5048 5048 5048 5048 14346 16094 21478 22885 EBIT 84607 127420 0 2 4 4 10300 13746 14646 EBIT*(1-T) 54148 81549 91814 3 2 7 11593 12762 16352 17291 Add Noncash Charges 116466 105170 5 4 3 0 Less: Net Inv in Fxd Cap 10125 10000 10000 10000 10000 7624 - - 19218 Less: Inv in Work Capital 102291 167961 -42671 -38047 -8382 5 14200 14641 14454 13390 Interest 152064 146000 0 0 4 2 24042 25867 29936 50393 FCFF 58199 344680 1 4 7 7 Discount rate 0.114042454 Terminal Value( Firm Value) 5465785.301 Discounting Factor Discounted FCFF Firm Value 3581079 Cash Out Flow 1500000 NPV 2081079 Page 28 of 44\n\n34. In this scenario we have seen that the LBO is quite good decision because the firm Value of old Revco is 3581079 thousands where the cost of LBO is 1.5 billion. Nad most importantly the NPV is positive. But NPV is not the final story of the game. We would like to relax some assumptions that are quite rational in the context of economy and industry The new Assumptions are- Terminal growth rate is 2% The growth rate is 5% and WCC is 15%. By this assumption we get the firm value is 1694159 thousands.

Calculate the Distressed Value of the Firm: As we have seen in the calculation of Z score the firm in distress zone so we have assumed the default probability is 55%. And we consider the distress cost is 30% of NPV. By considering these two issues we finally get the distressed value of the firm. Assumption Distress Cost is 30% of Firm Value Probability of Default 55% FCFF 1694159 Distress Cost 508248 FCFF less Distress Cost 1185911 Firm Value 1414623 Cash Out Flow -1500000 NPV aftr adj of Dist Cost -85377 Here distress cost is 508248 thousands. After deduction and multiplication with the probability we finally get the Farm Value which is 1.41 billion but certainly this figure is lower than the cash outflow. So after considering the distress cost it would not be wise decision to go for LBO.

In most respects the two companies were quite similar: Eckerd had been taken private, however, at a multiple of only 21.3 times, compared with Revco's 24.8 times earnings. Eckerd was also financed at a debt-equity ratio of 11.5 times, compared with Revco's 37.6 times. presents a forecast of how well Revco and Eckcrd could cover their financial obligations in the next three years, the period over which analysts perceived the greatest possible risk of default. For each company, the financial obligations included interest expense, principal payments, and preferred stock dividend payments. The \"coverage'' of these obligations was estimated as a multiple compared with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); and \"cash flow,\" which consisted of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBlTDA) plus the receipts from any asset sales less capita expenditures. (Additions to net working capital are ignored in this calculation. Ordinarily they deserve to be included in an analysis like this. Exclusion of this item biases the estimated coverage rates upward. Analysts acknowledged; however that the comparative figure such as those in Exhibit 7 were point estimates and thus ignored the uncertainty surrounding key assumptions. Revco's financial obligations were well known at the .time of the buyout. Thus, the uncertainty about Revco's comparative standing versus Jack Eckerd and other firms devolved from forecast uncertainty about the following points: Interest rates: Revco's senior debt bore interest that floated at 1.75 percent above prime rate, currently at 7.50 percent Asset sales: Revco had to sell assets to .meet its principal payments. One could give Revco the benefit of the doubt and assume that all $230 million would actually be realized. But analysts were uncertain about the timing18 of that realization. By comparison, Jack Eckerd would try to sell $72 million in assets. Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures could be assumed to be driven by Revco's goal of opening 100 stores per year at an investment of$1 00,000 per store. Depreciation could be approximated as $20 million for 1987, and thereafter scaled according to the percentage net change of Page 32 of 44\n\n38. the difference between asset sales and capital expenditures. By contrast, Jack Eckerd envisioned opening no new stores in the foreseeable future. Eckerd's depreciation was forecasted to be $123 million, a much higher figure than Revco's because Eckerd tended to own, rather than lease, its 'stores. Growth: Salomon Brothers contemplated a sales-growth rate no lower than 8 percent; it presented forecasts to commercial bankers that assumed growth at 12 percent. Goldman Sachs, the advisor to Revco's outside directors, determined that a 12 percent growth rate assumption was \"too aggressive.\" Analysts assumed sales growth of mature stores to be equal to the rate of inflation. In addition, \"the net growth from opening new stores would yield an annual corporate growth rate of 9 percent. · EBIT margin: From 1974to 1986, Revco's mean EBIT margin was 6.62 percent (standard deviation was 1.32 percent). The mean and standard deviation for Jack Eckerd Corporation were 8.11 and 1.42 percent, respectively; a sample of peer companies over the same period indicated that the mean and standard deviation were 5.15 and 1.25 percent, respectively. Salomon Brothers assumed an EBIT margin of 8.0 percent. Goldman Sachs opined that this assumption was \"a bit aggressive.\" Only once over the past 13 years did Revco reach that level, in 1984; thereafter Revco's EBIT margin fell to 3.50 and 4.84 percent. Sales growth and EBIT margin depended in part on the rate at which Revco planned to open new stores analysts challenged the wisdom of this strategy, noting that 70 percent of Revco's stores that had been open for less than one year lost money; the figure dropped to 48 percent for stores Analysts were unable to decide whether to assume any covariance between growth and margins and generally assumed that each year was an independent draw: i.e., that there was no serial covariance in the forecast assumptions that had been open from one to two years. 8.4. Possible Reasons for Going LBO: Management: Much of the controversy regarding LBOs has resulted from the concern that senior executives negotiating the sale of the company to themselves are engaged in self-dealing. On one hand, the managers have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to sell the company at the highest possible price. On the other hand, they have an incentive to minimize what they pay for the shares. Accordingly, it has been suggested that management takes advantage of superior information about a firm's intrinsic value. The evidence, however, indicates that the premiums paid in leveraged buyouts compare favorably with those in inter-firm mergers that are characterized by arm's-length negotiations between the buyer and seller. Once the LBO was completed·, Sidney Dworkin became chairman of the board and Chief executive officer of the \"new\" Revco, the same positions he had held at Reyco D. S. As in the old entity, Dworkin did not control a majority ofthe outstanding shares ofsto.ck; he owned 'about 15.4 percent. However, these shares were subject to a voting trust of which he was a member. Apparently, Mr. Dworkin would have more control in the \"new\" Rcvco than he had had at Rcvco D. S., where his ownership percentage was only 2.32 percent. Dworkin received $29.6 million for the stock and stock options that he held in the old. Revco. He invested about $8 million in the \"new\" Revco. ' Moreover manger assumes to enjoy tax savings. Existing Share Holder: Page 33 of 44\n\n39.

The stock holder gets price 38,5 dollar per share but its market price was 26.012$. Its book value were 12.055$ and P/E based price is 33.46$. In every respect shareholder becomes gainer. Debt holder: The debt holders bear the risk of default equated with higher leverage as well, but since they have the most senior claims on the assets of the company, they are likely to realize a partial, if not full, return on their investments, even in bankruptcy. In the case of Revco the debt holders gets 10-113% interest rate which are attractive, The bear default risk so they commensurate themselves by charging higher interest rate. Not all LBOs are successful, however, so there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. If the company's cash flow and the sale of assets are insufficient to meet the interest payments arising from its high levels of debt, the LBO is likely to fail and the company may go bankrupt. Another disadvantage is that paying high interest rates on LBO debt can damage a company's credit rating. Finally, it is possible that management may propose an LBO only for short-term personal profit. So in the case of Revco it has high probability of becoming default and high probability of being unsuccessful as well. 9. Capital Adequacy: We have used Monte Carlo simulation to test the ability of Revoc to meet its financial cash obligation, particularly we have done simulation to get probability of successfully covering the firm’s cash interest, debt principal and preferred dividend payments over the first three calendar years following the buyout. At issue is the sensitivity of the probability of survival based on variations in the operating assumptions by Revoc versus assumptions consistent with the historical performance or comparable companies and Revco.
