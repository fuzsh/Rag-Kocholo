        "text": "Consumer advocates and Eckerd Corp. executives agree that state regulators did the right thing by letting the drugstore chain stay open in Virginia despite the botched prescriptions and other troubles that characterized its debut here two months ago.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Eckerd can get past its rocky start by keeping the customers it inherited from Revco, making sure its prescription business runs more smoothly and avoiding further investigation or even litigation for its mistakes.\n\nThe next hurdle Eckerd must clear is a Sept. 18 deadline that the state Board of Pharmacy has imposed for computerizing two years of prescription records at the Clearwater-based chain's 113 Virginia stores.\n\nThe penalty if Eckerd doesn't make the deadline is a $437,000 fine _ on top of the $100,000 it already must pay. And the task is a daunting one: Eckerd vice president Robert W. Hannan told Board of Pharmacy members earlier this month that it would take at least three months to put such a computerized system in place.\n\nNot having that computer system during the past two months is largely to blame for the delays and prescription errors that have gotten Eckerd into so much trouble, state regulators say. Problems began when CVS Corp., which sold the stores to Eckerd to avoid antitrust litigation as it took over Revco D.S. Inc., left behind just four months of records _ on microfiche, not on computer.\n\nCVS has since provided a full two years of microfiche records to the former Revco stores, but Eckerd is still without computerized records. And much of the damage was done in Eckerd's first few weeks here, as pharmacists and technicians grappled with the cumbersome manual microfiche system to retrieve refill information.\n\nThere is always the possibility of more action ahead. The Board of Pharmacy's executive director, Elizabeth Scott Russell, said the board still could investigate many of the individual allegations that brought Eckerd's woes into the spotlight. That could lead to more punishment _ and more headlines _ for the chain and for its individual employees, some of whom are accused of filling prescriptions with the wrong medication, providing the wrong number of refills, or instructing patients to take the wrong dosage.\n\nThere are also the 20 spot inspections that Eckerd must submit to _ and pay for, at $400 apiece _ as part of the consent agreement it and the Board of Pharmacy signed Aug. 19.\n\nThe consent order also puts the chain on probation for at least a year.\n\nAny infractions discovered during that time could lead to further board action.\n\nRussell would not say whether any investigations are pending against Eckerd; such investigations are confidential, she said.\n\nThe prospect of civil liability as a result of any harm that has come to Eckerd's customers seems more removed, several officials say.\n\nFor one, state investigators say, prescription errors were corrected.\n\nAnd there have been no reports of any injury or illness resulting from Eckerd pharmacists' mistakes.\n\nFor another, when Eckerd's Hannan signed the consent agreement with the Board of Pharmacy last week, he did not admit to any wrongdoing.\n\nIf Eckerd isn't vulnerable to criminal or civil litigation, it may still be at risk of losing some of the customer base it inherited from powerhouse Revco.\n\nTo counter any potential distrust lingering among customers, Eckerd is in the midst of an effusive campaign to assure the public just how smoothly business is running now.\n\n\"We're anxious to build our relationship with the customers and with the community here,\" Hannan said.\n\nHe also assured the Board of Pharmacy that Eckerd has devised a plan to meet that Sept. 18 deadline for computerizing its records.\n\nAnd both executives and local pharmacists, as well as state investigators, say conditions have vastly improved behind the counter, where investigators found hectic, overcrowded and potentially dangerous conditions.\n\nWhat may also mitigate any harm done to Eckerd's reputation in Virginia is that another large corporation, CVS Corp., may also be held accountable for what has happened.\n\nCVS goes before a committee of Board of Pharmacy members on Sept. 11.\n\nIn a notice letter to CVS, pharmacy board executive director Russell refers to virtually all of the same problems that Eckerd was held accountable for."
