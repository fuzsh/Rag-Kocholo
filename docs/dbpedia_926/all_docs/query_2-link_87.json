        "text": "Hey, just wanted to first start off by saying this is a pretty extraordinary forum with an exceptional amount of excellent information, so thank you in advance.\n\nAttempting to rebuild credit based on poor decisions made a few years ago. Most frustrating part of this all is that USAA is my primary issue - very annoying considering that they're designed to support active duty and I've found them to be incredibly unresponsive.\n\nJan 2018 - began missing payments on a USAA Career Starter loan with a balance of $4753. Long story short, I was supposed to be on autopay for this loan and somehow it was removed (USAA app is miserable in my opinion). I asked repeatedly for them to reinstate my autopay on the phone and even got to the point where I asked them to record my conversations so that I could prove that I had authorized autopay but ultimately the responsibility is on the person, not the company. May 2018 my loan was charged off and closed, reporting the balance. It was never sent to collections based on my CRs.\n\nFoolishly, I attempted to dispute the account with Transunion based on active duty circumstances, and my TU score dropped from 685 (VantageScore 3.0) to 615 because the dispute \"reopened\" my closed account. I've asked USAA to report accurately, but after a month of phone calls and even attempting to pay in full, no change in status.\n\nI received a letter from Revco Solutions offering to settle for 50%, which terrifies me because I assume that this will\n\nnow be reported as a collection. It does not show as a CA account on any of my CRs so far, but I just got the letter. I heard on this forum that USAA no longer sells debt and just uses the collection agencies as a tool, but I'm not sure. And I'm very fearful that this will show as a collection in the near future.\n\nI attempted to pay the amount to USAA, but they informed me over the phone that Revco is handling the debt and I would need to work with them. Seems strange if they haven't actually sold the debt, which I am assuming they did.\n\nShould I work with the company to settle at 50% and hope for the best, knowing that my SOL timeline might be reset? Will USAA report as settled, or can I negotiate with Revco to state PIF and put in writing that they will not report the CA to the bureaus?\n\nI've been working to rebuild for some time now. Very strangely, even with my fair credit scores, I have been approved for several higher end cards (AMEX Plat and Chase Sapphire Reserve), have a CL of 28k with consistently less than 2% utilization, and an auto loan with about 23k left in good standing. So this USAA account (and a few missed payments in 2017 that have been current since 2018, and a CO from a utility company for $60 during a military move which I had no knowledge of) are tanking my scores.\n\nEXP Fico 8 - 650\n\nEXP Fico 9 - 675\n\nTU Fico 9 - 675\n\nTU VS 3.0 - 634\n\nEQ Fico 9 - 627 (have no idea why this is so much lower)\n\nEQ VS 3.0 - 692\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated - I can pay off the full CO amount, but USAA has been adamant that they will not PFD and that Revco is my only contact for the CO account.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n>I received a letter from Revco Solutions offering to settle for 50%, which terrifies me because I assume that this will\n\nnow be reported as a collection.

Seems strange if they haven't actually sold the debt, which I am assuming they did.\n\nAn original creditor doesn't have to sell the debt to involve a CA. USAA has probably hired Revco to collect the debt on their behalf. When this happens, the CA may or may not report the debt in collections to the CRAs. They can, but they don't always. If the original CO acct still shows a balance, USAA has most likely not sold the debt, but has given collection authority to Revco.\n\n>Should I work with the company to settle at 50% and hope for the best, knowing that my SOL timeline might be reset? Will USAA report as settled, or can I negotiate with Revco to state PIF and put in writing that they will not report the CA to the bureaus?\n\nIf you're financially able, I would take the 50% settlement. Revco is just collecting on USAA's behalf, and will turn the money (minus their fees) to USAA. If Revco will send you an email/letter stating they will accept 50% of the balance to consider the account 'settled in full', there's no possible SOL implications. You pay, the account is closed, end of story. USAA will then report the charged off account with a $0 balance and a remark 'legally settled for less than the full amount' or something similar. They're not going to mark it PIF if you settle it, and they're not going to PFD. Score wise, there is no difference whatsoever between PIF or settled for less. Settling this account will stop the balance from affecting your installment utilization %, and will allow it to begin to age until it dies a slow death 7 1/2 years from DoFD. You can attempt a sort of 'preemptive' PFD with Revco to make sure they don't report a paid collection tradeline on your reports in addition to the original charged off account. Not sure if Revco has any intention of ever reporting as a CA or not.\n\nFor the utility collection, call the electric company, and ask them to recall the debt in exchange for your payment. If they agree, the CA will disappear from your reports entirely. Don't put too much focus on VantageScore 3.0 scores. They're all but irrelevant to lenders. Track FICO scores through the various sites/apps available (myFICO.com, credit.com, experian.com, Discover Credit Scorecard, etc.).\n\nTeam Garden Club as of Oct 2021"
