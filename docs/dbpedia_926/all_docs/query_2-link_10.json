DATE: SATURDAY, March 18, 1995 TAG: 9503200038 SECTION: BUSINESS PAGE: A6 EDITION: METRO SOURCE: MAG POFF STAFF WRITER DATELINE: LENGTH: Medium\n\nREVCO PLANS MORE CLOSINGS\n\nIn a second round of closings in less than a year, Revco D.S. Inc. said Friday it will shut two of its Revco drugstores in Roanoke and Martinsville on April 1.\n\nThe Roanoke store is at Townside Festival at 3613 Franklin Road. It was formerly a SupeRx drugstore.\n\nTom Dingledy, spokesman for Revco D.S. in Twinsburg, Ohio, said the closings are part of the company's ongoing review of store operations. The stores, he said, \"did not meet our standards of profitability.\"\n\nRevco is closing six stores nationwide today and a third store, at Monroe, Ga., on April 1. Dingledy said there is no specific pattern or plan for closing stores. He said he did not know whether other stores in Western Virginia were slated to close.\n\nThe company closed five other area stores Aug. 13 after Revco's merger with Hook-SupeRx Inc. of Cincinnati. Those stores were at Valley View Mall, Orange Avenue and Oak Grove Plaza in Roanoke, Washington Avenue in Vinton and Northgate Village shopping center in Christiansburg. The company said then that those stores were chosen to close because they overlapped trading areas in the combined system.\n\nPrescriptions at the Townside Festival store will be transferred to the Revco drug store at Towers Mall. The company is notifying customers by mail of the transfer of their records.\n\nEdwin C. Hall of Hall & Associates, which manages Townside Festival, said the closing of Revco should have no negative impact on the shopping center in the long run. The drugstore is a major tenant in the 53,282-square-foot specialty center, which includes restaurants, apparel and home furnishings merchants and services on the ground level and offices on the second floor.\n\nRevco has a lease that extends for another 18 months, Hall said. That ensures rent during the time it will take to fill the space, he said.\n\nThe anchor at Townside Festival, he said, is Montano's International Gourmet restaurant, not Revco. He said in recent months Montano's has doubled its space in the center and Sound Decision has opened a store. Hall said Townside Festival is a 32-year-old neighborhood service center that has performed very well since it was renovated.\n\nby CNB"
