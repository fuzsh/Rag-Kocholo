        "text": "OCALA - CVS Pharmacy is poised to make its first foray into what is fast becoming a crowded market on State Road 200.\n\nBut it is a market that CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis said can certainly make room for one of the nation's leading retail drug stores.\n\nThe freestanding, 13,000-square-foot store will open for business on Sunday. While no formal ceremony is planned, DeAngelis said there will be \"grand opening\" specials going on throughout the week. The store is located between Steeplechase Plaza and AmSouth Bank at the intersection of SR 200 and Southwest 103rd Street Road.\n\nDeAngelis said it will offer many of the services that have become industry standards: a drive-through pickup window for prescriptions, one-hour photo and a large selection of merchandise and health products.\n\nThe \"CVS\" in the drug store's name stands for Consumer Value Stores. The Woonsocket, R.I.-based company was founded in 1963 and today has 4,100 stores and 110,000 employees in 32 states and the District of Columbia. It is the nation's largest retail provider of prescriptions, with annual revenues exceeding $24 billion. Its 1997 acquisition of RevCo was the largest acquisition in American history of the retail pharmacy industry.\n\nThree years ago, the company began its expansion into high growth areas in Central and South Florida. DeAngelis said CVS' strategy has been to \"build on its strong base by opening new stores annually in high potential and existing markets.\"\n\nCriteria for new stores is that locations must be highly visible, easily accessible and in high-traffic areas. That fits the bill for SR 200 where, just a few years ago, there was only one small Eckerds drug store. Now, in addition, there is a freestanding Walgreens store, a new Eckerds that opened last November and another Walgreens planned for the northeast end of the Corridor.\n\nDeAngelis said he's confident CVS can hold its own among the competition.\n\n\"The company's mission statement says we want to be the easiest pharmacy for customers to use,\" he said. \"Most of us sell the same products and services, but what's going to differentiate us is our layout, aesthetics, having things in stock, and our quick, friendly service.\"\n\nThe drug store chain also has a rapid-refill system; customers may refill prescriptions automatically by phone or online and elect to pick them up at the store of their choice or have the prescriptions mailed to their home. DeAngelis also said the store's \"Extra Care Card\" is the most comprehensive loyalty program in the country.\n\n\"When we entered the Florida market in late 2000, a lot of Northeast transplants wondered where we were,\" DeAngelis said. Since then, the company has opened three CVS Pharmacies in Orlando and one each in Altamonte, Apopka, Clermont and Mount Dora.\n\nCVS is also known nationally for its commitment to hiring mature workers. While DeAngelis could not say to what extent that has happened at the SR 200 store, he noted that as of press time the store was still in the process of hiring its staff.\n\nLast October, at an \"Employing Mature Workers in our Community\" conference at On Top of the World, CVS' director of government programs, Stephen Wing, sparked interest in his company among area retirees interested in getting back in the workforce. Wing, who keynoted the conference, pointed out that CVS expanded its \"mature workforce\" of employees from less than 7 percent in 1992 to more than 16 percent today - that's 16,280 workers, ranging in age from 50 to more than 90, who hold a variety of responsible positions, from lead pharmacy technicians to greeting card specialists and store managers.\n\n\"This is not a social program,\" Wing said at last fall's conference. \"It makes good business sense that we hire mature workers. Their loyalty and work ethic makes them great role models for our younger workers.\"\n\nWing, who has implemented a number of innovative programs designed to train mature employees for key roles in CVS stores, received the 2002 Dorothy Bauer Award from the National Older Workers Employment Services and serves on the board of directors for the National Conference on Aging and the Center for Workforce Preparations.\n\nLaura Byrnes covers the State Road 200 Corridor for The Leader.
