It seems as if one aspect of reproduction research or another is perpetually making headlines. In the most recent example, reports of cloned animals touched off a firestorm of debate on human cloning. Some researchers and ethicists contend that the field's notoriety comes from its connection with abortion-rights issues, an association that has st\n\nNew Products, Findings Breathe Life Into Asthma Market As Companies Expand Drug Development Opportunities\n\nNew Products, Findings Breathe Life Into Asthma Market As Companies Expand Drug Development Opportunities\n\nSidebar : Asthma Products - Delivering the Dosage Asthma Products - More Information CHEMICAL BLOCKER: Accolate was the first new asthma drug approved by FDA since the 1970s.

This effort translates into new opportunities for creative chemists and biologists.

Taking a puff of medication from an inhaler, patients can stifle an asthma attack. If they inhale medicine daily, they may even prevent asthma attacks entirely. But there's a problem. Studies suggest that many asthma patients use inhalers incorrectly and end up with less medicine than they need. They might inhale their medication too quickly, for example. In many cases, asthma patients end up swallow\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION\n\nAsthma - FOR FURTHER INFORMATION Date: March 17, 1997 Abbott Laboratories Inc. http://www.abbott.com Arris Pharmaceutical Corp. http://www.arris.com Boehringer Ingelheim http://199.79.148.67 Sequana Therapeutics http://www.sequana.com 3M Pharmaceuticals http://www.3M.com Zeneca Pharmaceuticals http://www.zeneca.com The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's recently released \"Guidelines for the Diagnoses and Management of Asthma\" can be accessed on the Intern\n\nThe Scientist - Crossword Puzzle - March 17, 1997\n\nThe Scientist - Crossword Puzzle - March 17, 1997\n\nBy Eric Albert Email: ealbert@world.std.com ACROSS 1 Phylum that contains radiolarlans and heliozoans 6 It's synthesized in the nucleolus: abbr. 9 Organism's capacity to withstand toxic substances. 10 Seasoning rated 2.5 on Mohs scale 12 It includes the upper but not the lower jaw 13 Interrelated community ofplants, animals, and bacteria 14 Type of chemical bond 16 American chemist who won a 1979 Nobel Prize 19 Orbit of equal-energy electrons 20 It's about 98% iron and 2% carbon 23 Noncyclic a\n\nWhy Some Retrieval Systems Are Used And Others Are Not\n\nWhy Some Retrieval Systems Are Used And Others Are Not\n\nEditor's Note: On the preceding page, Eugene Garfield pays tribute to information science pioneer Calvin N.

Brown, The Scientist, Jan. 20, 1997, page 16). The chastening of scientists as members of C.P. Snow's \"other culture\" is a popular pastime, but editors and publishers bear a share of the blame for substandard scientific writing. I have commented here (E.D.

It involved a probationary junior faculty member whose annual contract was not ren\n\nAn Editorial Comment\n\nAn Editorial Comment\n\nI heartily agreed with the opinions voiced in \"Scientific Journal Editors Say Polished Prose Clarifies Research\" (K.S. Brown, The Scientist, Jan. 20, 1997, page 16) that careful writing enhances understanding of an article's scientific content. However, missing from all the other useful advice was one tip: namely, to seek out the services of a medical editor. So-called author's editors (who assist authors by preparing manuscripts before submission to journals) work in many medical schools and c\n\nA Bold Statement\n\nA Bold Statement\n\nExcessive use of abbreviations is decried both in an article (K.S. Brown, The Scientist, Jan. 20, 1997, page 16) and in a subsequent letter to the editor (S.A. Lederman, The Scientist, Feb. 17, 1997, page 13). All the problems mentioned for abbreviations apply equally well to the use of names of people in articles. Generally, that is not an issue in research reports, but it is a major problem in news and commentary.
