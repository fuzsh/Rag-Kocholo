        "text": "Richard Hayden\n\n19:47 26 Jun 20\n\nWith Nogalis' technical leadership and project management expertise, we were able to successfully complete two huge... Lawson projects in 18 months:1 - Migrate to Lawson v10 from on-prem to Infor cloud2 - Split off a major segment of the company by setting up a duplicate Lawson on-prem environment and sending it off with a complete ERP of its ownNogalis brought the solutioning expertise and ability to execute over a long period that we did not have on our own team. Their ability to staff up and assign consultants based on specific expertise was critical and very effective.read more\n\nBrad Mercil\n\n16:33 30 May 19\n\nAdtalem (ATGE) has been working with Nogalis for over two years on Lawson related projects. Nogalis started working... with ATGE on a Lawson on-premise to Infor Cloud migration. ATGE attempted to work with two other partners that specialize in Lawson implementations, however, nothing seemed to be working and ATGE had to move on. Nogalis was originally brought in to update the Lawson process flows for the Cloud migration. Then they quickly rolled up their sleeves and dove into several other parts of the project. Nogalis now provides support and maintenance for the ATGE Lawson Cloud instance.ATGE would not have been able to complete the Cloud migration without Tan and the Nogalis team.During the Cloud migration project, Nogalis also began working on a company divestiture for ATGE. Again, this was a difficult project and Nogalis showed the deep view they have into the Lawson/Infor platform. Nogalis’ contributions were invaluable and directly contributed to the success of the project.Nogalis has been able to look into the core of a problem and recommend creative and realistic solutions. Their contributions helped ATGE successfully complete two very difficult and complex projects. I would highly recommend the Nogalis team for Lawson/Infor projects as they have shown themselves to be the one of the most adapt consulting and implementation partners in the marketplace.read more\n\nMichael J Rooney Jr.\n\n15:44 15 Jan 19\n\nWe had the pleasure of working with Nogalis for approximately 4 years. I can’t say enough about how helpful Nogalis was... to our company. Nogalis supported our upgrade to Lawson 10, and continued to support us on a monthly contract. With only a small internal staff supporting over 2,000 employees, Nogalis provided us support through countless critical business issues and always resolved them in a timely manner. I would give them my highest recommendation.read more\n\nNick Berg\n\n15:58 21 Nov 17\n\nWe use this software primarily because the software built into Lawson for reporting is not that great. Tan is on top of... everything if we have any issues and gets back to me real quick. The software itself can gather and group the data you grab from Lawson in about any way you can think of. If there is something special you are looking for, Tan and his group are always asking for things they can improve on. Love the software, love the team that supports it.read more\n\nBrian Beaver\n\n15:09 09 Nov 17\n\nWe are a 350 bed regional hospital with approximately 4000 employees. Our Lawson pre-upgrade environment included... LandmarkTalent Management/HR on v10, and Finance/Accounting/Payroll/Supply Chain/Materials on LSF v9. We partnered with Nogalisto upgrade our Lawson LSF v9 environments beginning in Sept 2015, and went live on LSF v10 in May 2016. Our experience with the Nogalis team could not have been any better. The combined years of Lawson experience and wide range of expertise from the Nogalis team is truly remarkable. However, the trait that *really* sets Nogalis apart from other consulting groups, is the incredible level of commitment and availability to the customer, along with the caring and fun personalities of Tan and his team.read more"
