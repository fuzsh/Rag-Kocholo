        "text": "<%=company1%>\n\nLawson Software recently introduced Lawson Smart Office, an intuitive, personalized user interface that allows users to directly access Lawson and Microsoft applications and update data pervasively and instantly across the applications. Lawson is bringing together Microsoft productivity, mobility and collaboration tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Groove, with Lawson enterprise applications and business intelligence capabilities.\n\nLawson Smart Office places the business software user at the center of the \"information workplace\" and the multiple processes they work with. Smart Office helps people access the information they need, when they want it, in the context required - combined with the analytic and Smart Notification capabilities of Lawson Business Intelligence. It also promotes greater collaboration and real-time information sharing across various business applications.\n\n\"Information combined with business intelligence drives today's business - and our customers need tools that are designed around people and how they actually interact with business software in their job,\" said Dean Hager, senior vice president of product management for Lawson. \"Smart Office can help make an organization's people more effective, their processes more efficient, their businesses stronger and their customers happier. Lawson Smart Office focuses on the user's needs, putting them in the middle of the technology and tools they know and trust. Simplicity and meaningful collaboration tools are key to helping facilitate greater user adoption and improved user and group productivity.\"\n\nJohn Lauer, manager of enterprise systems at Oglethorpe Power, an existing Lawson customer, said he sees tremendous value in the opportunity for teams to collaborate with Lawson information in a simplified technology environment. \"Most of our employees spend the bulk of their days working in Microsoft and Lawson applications,\" Lauer noted. \"But this new offering can advance our productivity by providing a dynamic interface that blends the Lawson and Microsoft worlds and fosters richer collaboration with a single version of the truth in terms of the data and business intelligence available to our people.\" Located in Tucker, Ga., Oglethorpe Power generates electricity for thirty-eight Electric Membership Corporations (EMCs). It is the nation's largest power supply cooperative in assets and annual kilowatt-hour sales.\n\nSince Lawson developed Smart Office around the Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation, the company can support virtually limitless business processes using Microsoft applications, as compared to competing approaches from other ERP vendors that only support a limited number of specific and prescriptive business scenarios.\n\n\"Lawson was one of the first to fully embrace the advantages of Windows Presentation Foundation and the result is striking. They've been able to create breakthrough experiences their customers are going to love and their competitors are going to have to follow,\" said Ian Ellison Taylor, general manager of Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation.\n\nAccording to Forrester Research, an information workplace \"is a next-generation digital work environment that leverages portal, collaboration, content management, office productivity, unified communications, business intelligence, learning, and other technologies to deliver a seamless work experience.\" (\"The Seven Tenets of the Information Workplace,\" Nov. 26, 2007)\n\n\"Smart Office is consistent with Lawson's ongoing commitment to make Lawson applications simpler and more effective - and, ultimately, to help make our customers stronger,\" said Hager. \"We're building on the proven Microsoft tools that our customers rely on to do their jobs, and helping deliver greater collaboration and productivity with a dynamic interface to Lawson enterprise solutions.\"\n\nAbout Lawson Software\n\nLawson Software provides software and service solutions to 4,000 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance and service sector industries across 40 countries.
