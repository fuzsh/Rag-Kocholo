        "text": "( BW)(MN-LAWSON-SOFTWARE)(LWSN)(LWSN.ST) Third-Largest Pennsylvania County Signs Multi-Suite Lawson Software Contract Bucks County Will Use the Lawson Applications to Enhance Operational Effectiveness by Eliminating Redundant Data Entry and Paper-Based Processes Business Editors/Technology Editors ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 6, 2007--Regulatory News: Lawson Software (Nasdaq:LWSN) today announced it signed a multi-suite contract with Bucks County, Pa., in Lawson's second quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended Nov. 30, 2006. Under the contract, the county licensed the Lawson Human Capital Management, Enterprise Financial Management and Supply Chain Management suites to help increase productivity and cross-departmental data sharing via business process automation. Bucks County, located northeast of Philadelphia, has approximately 2,600 employees and serves more than 620,000 residents. It is Pennsylvania's third-largest county and includes the boroughs/townships of Bensalem, Bristol, Doylestown and New Britain. \"Our existing business system had grown too costly to maintain as the manual tasks it required diverted staff time away from strategic initiatives,\" said Brian Hessenthaler, county finance director for Bucks County. \"The Lawson applications will help us cost-effectively manage our operations and greatly increase the efficiency with which we provide services to the public.\" The Lawson applications will replace Bucks County's legacy business system, which required data entry in multiple, disparate systems located across the county. That prevented county employees from easily accessing, sharing and reconciling key financial and other business information across departments. Lawson will help the county eliminate duplicate data entry and enhance operational efficiency by making timely, accurate information easily available to county personnel from one centralized system. Lawson Professional Services will provide implementation services for Bucks County's system roll out, which the county expects to complete in August 2008. \"Faced with demands for greater accountability and enhanced services, local governments need affordable business systems that will help them streamline administration,\" said Ken Munson, industry marketing director, Government & Education, Lawson Software. \"Our software and services help simplify the business of government so employees have more time to focus on serving constituents.\" Lawson serves more than 120 public services customers, including three of the top seven digital state governments and four of the 25 largest school districts in the United States. State governments, cities, counties, school districts, publicly owned utilities/authorities and special districts rely on Lawson's solutions to help meet the needs of a variety of stakeholders - constituents, employees, students, vendors and the community - while helping to maximize limited budgets.
