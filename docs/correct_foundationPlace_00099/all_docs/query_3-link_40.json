        "text": "Lawson Software (Nasdaq: LWSN) today announced that Skaggs Community Health Center licensed Lawson QuickStep Healthcare, which includes the Lawson S3 Human Capital Management, Enterprise Financial Management, Supply Chain Management and Business Intelligence Suites. The pre-configured software package with built-in best practices will help the hospital enhance its human resources capabilities and improve integration between its financial and supply chain processes. The contract was signed during Lawsonâ€™s third quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended Feb. 29, 2008.\n\nLocated in Branson, Mo., Skaggs Community Health Center is a 165-bed, not-for-profit, community-owned hospital and health center. It previously relied on disparate business systems to manage its administrative processes. As the hospital and surrounding community grew, Skaggs sought a modern IT infrastructure to support its expanding operations.\n\nâ€œOur legacy systems lacked self-service capabilities to empower our employees and were cumbersome to maintain,â€ said Crystal Stallings, chief information officer and vice president of Support Services, Skaggs Community Health Center. â€œLawsonâ€™s unified software platform and rapid deployment approach will help us simplify business processes so our staff can devote more time to patient care.â€\n\nSkaggs will use the Lawson system to automate financial, materials management and workforce management processes organization-wide. For example, the Lawson S3 Supply Chain Management Suite will help the hospital minimize costs and improve employee productivity by supporting more efficient tracking of supplies and packages using bar-coding and wireless technologies. Skaggs also plans to use Lawson Business Intelligence to support organization-wide reporting and analysis. Lawson Business Intelligence provides users with role-based dashboards to help foster timely decision-making.\n\nThe Lawson Human Capital Management Suiteâ€™s self-service functionality will enable Skaggs employees to directly access their personal information, such as vacation time and benefits status. This will give HR managers more time to focus on recruitment and workforce management activities.\n\nâ€œCommunity hospitals need a comprehensive business system thatâ€™s simple to deploy, use and maintain,â€ said Stacey Hicks, healthcare marketing director, Lawson Software. â€œLawson Quickstep Healthcare delivers our industry-leading software in a rapid implementation to help minimize risk and project costs so healthcare providers can accelerate overall time-to-value.â€\n\nLawson serves more than 500 healthcare industry customers representing more than 4,500 facilities, including eight of the top 10 integrated delivery networks. The company also serves managed care systems, academic medical centers, hospitals, clinics, physician group practices, home healthcare, long-term care and other health services enterprises. Lawson solutions help healthcare organizations manage their business so they can focus on their patients, automate and streamline materials management for a better bottom line, and overcome the challenges of the labor shortage.\n\nAbout Lawson Software\n\nLawson Software provides software and service solutions to 4,000 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance and service sector industries across 40 countries. Lawsonâ€™s solutions include Enterprise Performance Management, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, Manufacturing Resource Planning, Enterprise Asset Management and industry-tailored applications.
