        "text": "ST. PAUL, Minn., May 10, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Lawson Software (Nasdaq: LWSN) today announced that Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS) in Tampa, Fla., has selected Lawson for a multi-application deployment of its Lawson Talent Management suite. The implementation will include Global Human Resources, Talent Acquisition, Compensation Management, Performance and Goal Management, Learning and Development and Succession Management modules. The contract was signed during Lawson's third quarter of fiscal year 2010, which ended Feb. 28, 2010.\n\nHCPS is the eighth-largest school district in the United States, with more than 12,500 teachers educating more than 190,000 primary and secondary students in 248 schools and 60 learning centers. The district will use Lawson Talent Management to help support its seven-year Empowering Effective Teachers (EET) project, which aims to ensure that every classroom is supported by a highly effective teacher.\n\n\"We ultimately want to improve student achievement and teacher effectiveness across all grade levels with the help of technology,\" said David Steele, chief information and technology officer for HCPS. \"Our goal is to have 90 percent of our students graduate ready for college or a career. We believe that Lawson Talent Management will assist us in reaching this goal by helping establish measurable teacher performance indicators. It can also help us address high attrition among our newer teachers, and improve overall compensation, recruitment, professional development and HR administration processes.\" The Lawson Talent Management suite will bring together core applications, including: -- Lawson Global Human Resources, which will help reduce time required to manage and maintain core HR processes, helping free time for more focus on core talent management functions.\n\n-- Lawson Talent Acquisition to help identify, attract and engage high potential employees and find more talent like them.\n\n-- Lawson Compensation Management, which will help HCPS build upon its current teacher compensation system, based on tenure and credentials, to a more efficient and modern career ladder model.\n\n-- Lawson Performance Management, which will utilize data benchmarks and key performance indicators to help HCPS better assess teacher competency against job profiles, which can ultimately help identify, develop and retain top performers.\n\n-- Lawson Goal Management, which aligns employee goals with core business objectives.\n\n-- Lawson Learning and Development, which contains tools to design training plans to help ensure future career development opportunities.\n\n-- Lawson Succession Management, which will assist the district in addressing the high attrition rate prevalent among new teachers by helping to identify teachers at risk for leaving and to locate teacher candidates with competencies that could fulfill future vacant or successor roles.\n\nHCPS's adoption of Lawson Talent Management will be made possible by a $100 million education grant awarded to the district by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Lawson project is one of many initiatives made possible by the grant.\n\n\"The integrated Lawson Talent Management suite is just one example of how Lawson solutions can help an organization like HCPS achieve its goals by developing a strong and effective workforce,\" said Brian Murphy, general manager, Public Sector for Lawson. \"HCPS' program to use technology as a means to measure performance, recruit, train and retain the best teachers can serve as a great model for other school districts pursuing teacher quality initiatives, including through the White House's 'Race to the Top' funding. Lawson Talent Management provides the kind of data and information about employee performance to help support these types of initiatives.\" HCPS recently participated in a webinar during which the district discussed the role of technology in improving teacher effectiveness and student achievement.
