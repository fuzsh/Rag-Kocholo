        "text": "Enterprise applications from Lawson Software are helping Corpesca reduce IT costs and improve supply chain visibility by providing a unified business system that simplifies information access. The company recently completed implementation of the Lawson M3 Finance Management, Supply Chain Management and Enterprise Performance Management Suites, which help users more efficiently manage their core manufacturing, distribution and financial processes.\n\nLocated in northern Chile, Corpesca is the largest fishmeal and fish oil producer in the country, accounting for approximately 25 percent of all open sea catches in Chile. Corpesca has a fleet of 83 fishing vessels and maintains production plants in Arica, Iquique, Tocopilla and Mejillones in Chile. Through these facilities, Corpesca has capacity to process approximately 1,000 tons of raw material per hour.\n\n\"Lawson delivered on its promise of a simplified installation process â€“ a sharp contrast to other ERP providers,\" said Nicolas Vukasovic, chief information officer for Corpesca. \"While we've only been live on Lawson for a short time, we're starting to see reductions in IT costs and an improved ability to manage our business to help meet evolving regulations and global demand.\"\n\nCorpesca deployed the Lawson system simultaneously across all of its facilities. Lawson channel partner Sigma S.A., based in Chile, provided implementation services for the system rollout.\n\nUsing Lawson Business Intelligence, part of the Lawson M3 Enterprise Performance Management Suite, Corpesca can now provide its management team with intuitive, role-based reports to help drive timely decision-making. Managers also have an improved view into sales, production and cost data in a number of different ways.\n\nThe Lawson system is helping Corpesca support compliance with international regulations and enhance its procurement and fulfillment processes. Moreover, by linking Corpesca's supply chain and financial systems into a single, unified system, Lawson is helping the company simplify data sharing across departments and enhance system maintenance and support.\n\n\"Food manufacturers need business systems that provide greater visibility and flexibility to profitably manage their complex supply chains,\" said Vicki Griffith, marketing director, Food & Beverage, Lawson. \"We deliver proven applications with built-in food industry best practices that are simple to deploy, use and maintain.\"\n\nAbout Lawson Software\n\nLawson Software provides software and service solutions to 4,500 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance, healthcare and service sector industries across 40 countries.
