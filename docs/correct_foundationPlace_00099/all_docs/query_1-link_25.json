        "text": "Lawson Software recently announced that Holland Hospital licensed the Lawson Enterprise Financial Management, Supply Chain Management and Business Intelligence suites in Lawson's third quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended Feb. 28, 2007. The Lawson applications will help the hospital support its rapid growth by providing software to standardize financial and materials management processes, improve data access and increase operational efficiencies.\n\nLocated in Holland, Mich., Holland Hospital is a 205-bed, not-for-profit hospital with 1,600 employees. As the community hospital grew, its legacy business systems hindered productivity by requiring employees to follow time-consuming, manual processes, such as re-keying purchasing data. Additionally, department managers often spent considerable time searching for key information then manually transferring that data for reporting purposes.\n\n\"The Lawson system's expanded functionality will provide a strong foundation for our long-term business needs,\" said Terry Steele, vice president and chief financial officer for Holland Hospital. \"And Lawson's community hospital-specific implementation model will help us accelerate and simplify system rollout.\"\n\nOnce implemented, the Web-based Lawson system will provide a single user interface for Holland employees to quickly access and share financial and supply chain information. It also will enable Lawson Drill Around capabilities, which allow users to further analyze data and access the supporting transactions. With greater visibility into hospital-wide data, Holland managers will be able to better track critical information to enhance decision-making. The consolidated Lawson system also will help the hospital streamline the invoice approval processes, eliminate duplicate data entry, enhance reporting and create a scalable financial system, which is a key internal goal at Holland.\n\nBy increasing operational efficiencies through streamlined financial and supply chain processes, Holland will free staff time and financial resources to focus on more strategic initiatives, such as controlling supply costs and enhancing patient care. The hospital expects to complete its Lawson implementation in December 2007.\n\n\"Community hospitals need comprehensive business systems that are simple to deploy and use so staff can focus on patients, not administration,\" said Sara Van Kempen, healthcare marketing director, Lawson Software. \"Our rapid deployment model is designed to help community hospitals like Holland reduce implementation time and costs while providing the enhanced capabilities essential for their growing operations.\"\n\nLawson serves more than 500 healthcare industry customers representing more than 4,500 facilities, including eight of the top 10 integrated delivery networks. The company also serves managed care systems, academic medical centers, hospitals, clinics, physician group practices, home healthcare, long-term care and other health services enterprises. Lawson solutions help healthcare organizations manage their business so they can focus on their patients, automate and streamline materials management for a better bottom line, and overcome the challenges of the labor shortage.\n\nAbout Lawson Software\n\nLawson Software provides software and service solutions to approximately 4,000 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance and service sector industries across 40 countries. Lawson's solutions include Enterprise Performance Management, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, Manufacturing Resource Planning, Enterprise Asset Management and industry-tailored applications.
