        "text": "Lawson Software recently announced it has signed a contract with Sweden-based Milko to implement the Lawson M3 7.1 Application Suite and Lawson M3 Technology. The Lawson M3 enterprise software solutions are designed to meet the industry-specific needs of companies like dairy producers operating in the food and beverage industry. The Lawson M3 solutions will help Milko better manage its finance, procurement, planning and supply chain management processes and allow Milko to replace a number of disparate systems. The contract was signed during Lawson's third quarter of fiscal 2008, which ends Feb. 29, 2008.\n\nMilko, owned by more than 1,000 dairy farmers, is one of Sweden's largest dairy companies. The location of the dairies extends from Varmland in southern Sweden to Jamtland in the northern part of the country. The company has more than 900 employees.\n\nMilko's decision to invest in the Lawson M3 solution was based on a careful study of how the applications can help improve Milko's competitiveness, efficiency, planning and control over its operations. The new system includes advanced reporting functionality and can help facilitate web-based ordering for Milko's retail customers.\n\n\"Lawson's considerable experience in the dairy industry has been the decisive factor in our choice of supplier,\" says Eva Aronsson, project manager for Milko. \"The activities within a transaction-intensive company with fresh products require a highly automated, stable system. Lawson is a strong supplier with a proven solution.\"\n\n\"With this contract we've gained another important customer in the food industry,\" said Peter Hagstrom, managing director for Lawson in Sweden. \"Our relationship with Milko shows how important it is to use industry-specific enterprise software solutions to help support an organization's business objectives.\"\n\nThe Lawson M3 7.1 Application Suite includes the Lawson Smart Client user interface. Smart Client was first introduced in 2007 and is designed to improve the overall user experience and user adoption of Lawson M3 enterprise applications.\n\nAbout Lawson Software\n\nLawson Software provides software and service solutions to 4,000 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance and service sector industries across 40 countries.
