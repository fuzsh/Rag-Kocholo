The not-for-profit, integrated health care system will implement the Lawson Human Resource Management suite, including the Lawson Employee and Manager Self Service application. The contract was signed during Lawson's fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, which ended May 31, 2010.\n\nA long-standing Lawson customer, UNCHCS has been using Lawson Healthcare enterprise business management applications for financial and supply chain management. UNCHCS is based in Chapel Hill, N.C. It exists to deliver the highest quality health care available, while maintaining outstanding service as the foundation of everything it does. The Lawson applications help provide the management flexibility and competitiveness UNCHCS required to function in a rapidly changing healthcare business environment.\n\nLawson Human Resource Management helps HR departments achieve greater organizational excellence with solutions that support key business operations and activities. It's designed to help automate key HR administrative processes, which promotes increased efficiency and allows organizations like UNCHCS to focus more time and attention on patient care.\n\nUNCHCS will replace its existing HR management system with the Lawson system. It's seeking greater automation of key HR processes, particularly those relating to internal reporting and communication with employees. The Lawson Employee and Manager Self Service module will also help support a better employee experience with the HR software, giving UNCHCS more access and control over its individual HR-related activities.\n\n\"Lawson has a proven track record with us, given our experience using Lawson to help us manage financial and supply chain-related activities,\" said Jim Walsh, director of applications development for UNCHCS. \"The Lawson HR offering will help us achieve other key business objectives, in particular gaining greater efficiency and effectiveness in our HR processes and HR-related interactions with our employees.\"\n\n\"Healthcare providers like UNCHCS face increasing pressures to be more efficient and effective, both in how they manage their business and their people,\" said Jim Catalino, general manager, Lawson Healthcare. \"By moving to a modern HR system, UNCHCS will have tools that will help improve the HR experience for employees and managers, while delivering greater flexibility and agility to the human resources organization.\"\n\nLawson Healthcare is the information technology partner that helps manage and connect the clinical, financial and operational information that allows providers to concentrate on their mission of delivering the best patient care possible.
