I won’t forget Nurse Keith Sweat lol. He made sure I didn’t have to have another c-section which I’m more than grateful for. Nurse Cleo was great as well just a total sweetheart. A lastly nurse Kellie, helped with the ending of my stay and my discharge. SRMC really has a great staff I’m thankful I had this experience with them. – Celestine R., The Women’s & Infants Pavilion Patient, 6/8/23\n\nCelestine R.\n\n“The staff, from getting registered, pre-op room (Tiffany was amazing) , the anesthesiologist took her time explaining everything. Everyone in the operating room was patient. The nurses on the floor attended to my every need. My doctor, Trace St. Julian MD is super amazing. I have no complaints about anything!! Keep up the great work.” – Arundella B., Surgery and The Women’s Center Patient, 3/9/23\n\nArundella B.\n\n“This facility provided top notch services from the registration to the discharge. Everyone was thorough, patient, kind and compassionate. I couldn’t have had a better team. Special thanks to nurse Joyce, Ukeme, Dr. Lee, nurse Vonnie, the assistants in the operating room and the one and only Dr. Clifton Youngblood. I’m forever grateful.” – Trenishia B., Surgery Patient, 3/10/23\n\nTrenishia B.\n\n“They told me that it was the worst hospital and that is not the truth. I went there due to contractions because of gestational diabetes and the service of the nurses was excellent. I loved it and will recommend the hospital (sic) to many. Thanks to the nurses!” – Magdalena P., The Women’s Center Patient, 3/8/23 (translated from original review)\n\nMagdalena P.\n\n“My recent visit to Southern Regional Medical Center was welcoming and accommodating from start to finish. The front desk receptionist was polite and accommodating when I requested wheelchair transport to my appointment location. The young lady that provided the actual transport was also accommodating, polite, and very patient as it took me a few minutes to get into the wheelchair. Once I arrived at my appointment location, I was met with a friendly greeting. The young lady (Kim), who administered my care per the appointment, was super nice, patient, thorough, informative, and very knowledgeable in her specialty area. She was also kind enough to personally wheelchair me back to my car. I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to everyone for their great customer service. May God bless and keep them all. – Corean D., Outpatient, 10/5/22\n\nCorean D.\n\n“I woke up one morning with a bad headache and dizziness while 37 weeks pregnant with my son. I went to the emergency room and waited no more than 2 minutes before they had me rushed to the women’s side of the hospital. While waiting to see what was going on the nurses were so nice, friendly, and helpful. I was told I needed a C-section and they got me prepped for it, I was beyond nervous because I’ve heard so many stories and this was my first child and I’m only 22. From the doctors all the way down to the people assisting with the procedure were out of this world amazing. After my C-section I wouldn’t stop bleeding, so they tried 3 different treatments to get me to stop but the doctor who performed my C-section was there holding my hand the whole way. I wish I knew her name cuz I’m pregnant again and would love for her and her staff to deliver my daughter in May 2023. It was a breath of fresh air because all my healthcare professionals were black just like me and they treated us like family. The only negative thing I will say was once I got upstairs for my last day stay, they didn’t offer me any food, the night nurse was so rude and acted like she had better things to do. I would ask for something and wouldn’t get it until the morning nurse came. But overall, definitely would recommend delivering here. I joke every time I past the hospital with my fiancé that they gave me the Beyoncé treatment! – Lei-Asia B., ER and Women’s Center Patient, 12/21/22\n\nLei-Asia B\n\n“Doctor O, RN Melecia, Ms. Daisy, Nurse Darlin, Chief Nursing Nurse Janie, Respiratory Torey, Pam, Nurse Lydia has truly been a blessing for my Family. My Hubby has been here since 2/6/23 and they have done a GREAT JOB!! getting him back to being healthy. I really appreciate them ❤️❤️. His Nurses at night, Leslie, Candace, Shakira has done a wonderful job as well in ICU.” – DaStar E., ICU Patient Family Member, 2/13/23\n\nDaStar E.\n\nAbout Prime Healthcare\n\nHospitals\n\nCommunities served\n\nSTAFF & AFFILIATED PHYSICIANS\n\nLicensed Beds"
