        "text": "Zeppelin Baumaschinen GmbH, Europe’s largest Caterpillar dealer, last week completed its implementation of the Lawson M3 enterprise software solution for equipment service management and rental industries, Lawson Software said last week. Zeppelin is using the software at 40 sites in Germany. Zeppelin supplies its customers with more than 650 primary products, including large, standard and compact equipment from Caterpillar, used in mining, road construction and civil engineering. The Lawson software supports Zeppelin’s entire range of dealership activities, including rental, sales, service and maintenance, purchasing, spare parts management, warranty management and finance.\n\nZeppelin replaced its legacy in-house systems and its SAP financial application, resulting in a reduction in the total cost of system ownership.\n\n“We initially chose the Lawson system because of its ability to support the scale and breadth of our business requirements,” said Manfred Schmaderer, Zeppelin’s chief information officer. “Now that we are running live with a solution that is comprehensive and built for the specific needs of our equipment dealership, we have established a foundation of operational excellence at every stage of the equipment and customer lifecycle. The ability to capture critical transactional data will assist us in establishing standards and ongoing performance improvements focusing on our customers, equipment, people and ultimately the financials.”\n\nLawson Software is based in St. Paul, Minn., and has offices around the world."
