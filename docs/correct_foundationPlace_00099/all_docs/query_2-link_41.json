Why did Lawson Win or Lose the Deal?\n\nThe customer sought to replace its current HR system, which had been stretched beyond its full potential and had become obsolete. In addition to Lawson, the customer considered Oracle, PeopleSoft, and SAP for the purchase. Lawson was selected on the basis of product functionality. Specifically, it was the functionality of ProcessFlow, Smart Notification, and Design Studio that influenced the customer to purchase Lawson. The past experience of the customer with Lawson and its products also factor into this purchasing decision.\n\nHowever, the customer's experience with the delivery of this most recent purchase has been riddled with problems. In particular, while the customer was upgrading to 8.03, Lawson released 8.1. From the customer's perspective, the quality of Lawson's releases is so poor that it becomes necessary apparently, for upgrades to be released even before the problems are fully worked out of the earlier release. In addition, Lawson has been generally slow to respond to issues brought to its attention.\n\nLAW-003114 p>2. Where will the users be located? (ie. Corporate Office, US Branch Locations, Europe, etc.)\n\nUsers are located throughout a system of three clinics associated with the customer.\n\n3. What industry analysts were utilized? (If none, document accordingly)\n\nA Gartner Group report, as well as a second report supplied by an unnamed vendor, was consulted before making this purchase.\n\n4A. Please assign 100 total points that will represent your satisfaction with Lawson Software in these 4 factors (Product, Company & Sales Process, Pricing and Implementation & Service). How would you allocate them (ie. 40, 30, 20, 10 or 25, 15, 50, 10, etc.)?\n\n4B.
