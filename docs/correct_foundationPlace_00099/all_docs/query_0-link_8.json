Drivers of Partnerships for Future Success for Post-Acute Providers4Accountable Care Organizations\n\n6. Bundled Payment\n\n7. Hospital Readmission PenaltiesHome Health 30-Day Hospital Readmissions by State5\n\n8. Why Post-Acute Is Key to Managing Health Care Costs6\n\n9. Post-Acute Payments by Venue and Condition7In ACO-land, expect greater use of subacute skilled nursing and home healthNote: Data are preliminary and subject to change. Numbers reflect standardized payment rates and therefore do not reflect provider-specific adjustments such as the area wage index or DSH payment adjustments. Spending captures payments for all PAC services that occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.Source: MedPAC analysis of 5% Medicare claims files 2004 to 2006.\n\n10. ACOs – One of the Ways Health Care Reform will Bend the Cost CurvePayment ChangesReimbursement cuts\n\n11. Value-based reimbursement\n\n12. Bundled paymentsCare Delivery System ChangesAccountable care organizations\n\n13. Medical homes\n\n15. How ACOs Provide Accountable Care in a New Delivery SystemCapacity to deliver continuum of care, grounded in strong primary care and minimal use of high-cost institutional settingsPayment rewards slower cost growth so long as combined with improvements in qualityReliable measures of a person’s health assure that savings are achievedthrough improvements in care9\n\n16. Accountable Care Organizations5,000+ Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries\n\n17. Accountable for all Medicare Part A and Part B service\n\n18.

Medicare ACOs in 2012, But Many ACO Demonstrations Now113 Medicare Pilot SitesMany Private Payer PilotsRoanoke, VAMedica and InsurersLouisville, KYTucson, AZTorrance, CA\n\n30. Medicare ACO EligibilityWho Can Be An ACO?Group practices\n\n31. Networks of individual practices\n\n32. Partnerships or JV arrangements between hospitals and ACO professionals\n\n33. Hospitals employing ACO professionals\n\n34. Such other groups of providers of services and suppliers as the Secretary determines appropriate12ACO ProfessionalsDoctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine and surgery by the State\n\n35. Physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist\n\n36. Certified registered nurse anesthetist\n\n37. Certified nurse-midwife\n\n39. Clinical psychologist\n\n40. Registered dietitian or nutrition professionalHow Do You Qualify as a Medicare ACO?Become accountable for quality, cost, and overall careFormal legal structure to receive and distribute payments for shared savings Have enough primary care physiciansHave a minimum of 5,000 beneficiariesLeadership and management structure that includes clinical and administrative systemsProcesses to promote evidence-based medicine and patient engagement, report on quality/cost measures, and coordinate careMeet patient-centeredness criteriaMinimum three-year contract with Medicare13\n\n41. New Payment Model for Medicare ACOs: Shared SavingsCurrent per-capita spending for assigned patients determined from claims for past three yearsSpending target is determined (Medicare)If actual spending lower than target, savings are sharedIF quality targets are also achieved14ACO LaunchedProjectedTargetShared SavingsActual14Adapted from Brookings Institute\n\n42. Sample ACO Calculation15An organization must meetquality standards ANDachieve cost savings to earn bonus payments* Actual costs for “assigned” population are less than pre-set expected costs based on risk-adjusted trends** PGP demonstration gave groups 80% of savings; actual split for ACOs to be determined\n\n43. Three Strategic Partnership Imperatives for Post-Acute and Aging Services Providers16Partner with hospitals and ACOs to address biggest concerns:Length of stay\n\n44. Pendingre-admission penaltiesPartner with other providers to enhance yourpost-acute andhome care continuumPartner with like providers to create one-stop chronic care managementStrategy includes care transitions management and electronic health record\n\n45. The New Reality for Aging Service Providers: Partnerships with Other Providers17Provide an array of aging services, not just skilled nursing and long-term care; be the navigator or partner for services or venues you do not offer = care management\n\n46. Become preferred partner for integrated health systems or ACOs from whence Medicare dollars will flowStrategies for ACO and Hospice-Palliative Care RelationshipsJane Gorwin, RN, BS, MAHealth Dimensions Group18\n\n47. How Do Palliative and Hospice CareFit into an ACO Model?Laying the foundation for a palliative care framework first19\n\n48. How Do Palliative and Hospice CareFit into an ACO Model? (continued)20\n\n49. What Needs to Change?The basic way we work with patients, especially in one of these three categories:Chronic Disease ManagementNeed to better identify where a patient is within this trajectoryEnhance acute to community-based transitional care coordinationInterventional PalliationEducate/enlighten patient and family earlierProvide options for patient/family choiceHospice CareMarketing strategy and partnerships with hospitals and PCP21\n\n50. What Do ACOs Want from Post-Acute and Aging Services Providers?Not likely to be a partner, with “skin in the game”, but rather a contractorACOs will want few PAC provider-contractors who:√ Can demonstrate value (quality and cost reductions) with credible data Few 30-day hospital readmissions High volume of discharges to home√ Have evidence-based clinical programs for most common SNF-HHA discharges and a care transitions program between venues√Have facilities/services that are geographically convenient to primary care physicians and hospitals√ Already have positive relationship with hospitals and PCPs√ Willing and able to be part of health information exchange 22\n\n51. Hospice: Well Positioned for the FutureAging demographics – baby boomersChronic disease “explosion”Key offenders:Congestive Heart FailureDiabetesChronic Obstructive Pulmonary DisorderPneumoniaParkinson’s – ALS – DementiasDepression23\n\n52. Not-for-Profit Accountable Care Readiness Strategy: Aging Services Provider Partnerships24Create a not-for-profit consortium within a market that has more value than any organization individuallyBenefits:One-stop shopping for hospitals and ACOsBenchmarks for hospital readmissionsand ongoing comparisonPost-acute provider partnerships in geographic areas creating care continuum with standardized protocolsCare management projectsBundling experiments with Medicare Advantage Plans as we learn to take risksApply for grants for demonstration projects\n\n53. To Be a “Player” in the ACO ArenaYou have to be ahead of the curve in developing relationships with hospitals, primary care physician groups, and even insurers/managed carePartnerships must be value-based: what do you bring?Hospital readmission reduction\n\n54. Cost reductions for post-acute episode of care\n\n55. Care coordination across the continuum\n\n56. Chronic care management to reduce ED visits and hospitalizations\n\n58. Ability to share payment risk based on outcomes25\n\n59. Define Your Services: What are You Providing Within the Continuum?Palliative Care: interventional and comfort care focusPalliative care in–patient hospital versus home healthHospice Care: comfort care and quality of life focus Routine hospice care Respite Continuous careGeneral in patient 26\n\n60. Overarching Strategy of Why You Will Benefit an ACOAbility to reduce 30-day (+) hospital readmissionsAbility to reduce emergency/urgent care visitsReduce hospital length of stayPotentially decrease in-patient hospital mortality rates27KNOW YOUR DATA AND SHARE IT!\n\n61. Critical Elements for a Successful Strategy ImplementationEvidence-based practice (interventional PC and hospice)Use of aligned, care protocols Patient/family centered—self-care management drivenCoaching: motivational interviewing skillsPatient/Family self goal-settingMedication awareness (PHR)Self symptom management and interventions28\n\n62. Critical Elements for Successful StrategyAn integrated care management and health system navigator approachEffective electronic information exchangeFrom provider to providerPatient/family to provider (tele-health, bio-sensory technology, video-audio interface) Real-time data management decision-making29\n\n63. What are Some of the Current Challenges?Current fiscal realities (shrinking margins)HospitalsHome HealthHospiceRegulations and future Medicare payment models are always “behind”Hospice: limited to 6-month end-of-life prognosisPalliative care: not officially recognized No specific reimbursement for care management models…..yet30\n\n64. More ChallengesNeed for highly sophisticated data management information systems that will:Enhance traditional quality care indicators (pain management, satisfaction surveys post-death)Provide predictive statistical modeling as relates to primary diagnoses and co-morbid conditionsHelp to identify patients’ clinical and social needs within their trajectory (chronic disease management, interventional palliation, hospice)31\n\n65. Next Steps to Move Your Strategy ForwardEvaluate your current servicesDo you provide what your hospital(s) and PCP(s) need?Do you collect the right data?Research your most likely ACO partnersWhat are their specific needs?Get their data: mortality rates, lengths of stay, top chronic diseases causing the readmissions32\n\n66. Moving Your Strategy ForwardDevelop your presentation to meet with potential ACO partners: hospitals and PCPsBe specific with your data to show how YOU will be essential to their accountable care organizationExplore current funding opportunities:Shared risk ventures with Medicare Advantage plansGrantsDemonstration projectsBe proactive to get a “seat at thetable” and start now!33\n\n67.
