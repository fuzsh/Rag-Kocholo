We save financial institutions time and money by providing them with streaming, real-time access to income and employment data, so they can automate critical workflows, reduce risks, and provide consumers with exceptional experiences. And we do it all through payroll connectivity.\n\nIn with the new\n\nThe solution is Argyle\n\nSince 2018, we have brought together the brightest minds in the game to build the most trusted network of consumer-permissioned connections between payroll processors and financial institutions.
