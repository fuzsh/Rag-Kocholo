        "text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. – Lawson Software recently announced it will acquire Enwisen, a leading software-as-a-service provider of human resource service delivery solutions used by many of the world’s leading companies. After adding Enwisen, HR service delivery will become a new strategic component of the Lawson Human Capital Management (HCM) System, giving Lawson one of the broadest solution sets targeted at the HCM software market. The all-cash transaction of $70 million is subject to customary regulatory approvals and approval by Enwisen’s shareholders. The agreement also includes a contingent earnout payment of $5 million cash if certain conditions have been satisfied as of June 30, 2012. Lawson expects the acquisition to close by Dec. 31, 2010.\n\nBased in Novato, Calif., privately owned Enwisen has approximately 260 customers, including many in the Fortune 1000. The Enwisen AnswerSource HR Service Delivery suite helps companies transform and improve their delivery of HR services using fewer resources and lowering costs. Although many companies have implemented self-service HR software in their organizations, Enwisen further reduces the administrative burden on HR teams by giving managers, employees and HR customer service reps (CSRs) easy access to the information they need via a web-based portal and knowledgebase rich in personalized, relevant HR content. Enwisen solutions can also deliver significant cost savings for customers, whether implemented as a standalone solution or as part of broader HR transformation.\n\nThe Enwisen AnswerSource suite includes:\n\n· HR Knowledge Base/Portal – is a single point of access that delivers personalized HR content, including employee and manager policies, benefit information, handbooks and other essential HR information in two-clicks or less, and integrated with self-service transactions. This makes it easier for employees to find the right information in one place and answer their own HR questions up to 90 percent of the time without HR intervention.\n\n· Shared Services (HR Case Management) – is an HR case management solution that integrates with the personalized knowledgebase and allows CSRs to achieve more than 90 percent first call resolution; also allows employers to manage higher call volumes with significantly fewer CSRs.\n\n· Onboarding/Offboarding – provides a rich, personalized new-hire experience that increases employee engagement and retention while streamlining costs and processes. This solution also provides tours and workflows to help employees through transitions such as starting or ending their jobs with a company. It also allows for more robust content such as video to help bring new employees onboard more effectively.\n\n· Total Rewards – provides a comprehensive, online view of an employee’s total reward and compensation package. This includes modeling tools that allows employees to conduct a variety of “what if” scenarios relating to their compensation. It also allows the employer to help employees better understand the company’s total financial commitment to them, which can help improve employee retention and participation in voluntary saving programs such as 401(k) and employee stock purchase programs.\n\nEnwisen has been a strategic Lawson partner since 2008. Through the existing partnership, Lawson has packaged and sold the AnswerSource products to Lawson customers, resulting in these products already working in tandem with Lawson HR solutions. After the acquisition is complete, the Lawson Human Capital Management system will include Human Resource Management, Talent Management, Workforce Management and the new component, HR Service Delivery. The HR Service Delivery solutions can be purchased and implemented independently or as part of the total Lawson HCM suite. Lawson is committed to current Enwisen customers no matter what HR information system solution a customer is using. Lawson also plans to maintain, enhance and market the Enwisen HR Service Delivery suite to the Enwisen customer base and future customers who may be running varied HRIS platforms.\n\nThis acquisition supports Lawson’s growth strategy by adding a new set of proven products and services for customers in one of the company’s fastest growing markets. With more than 1,000 customers using Lawson’s Human Capital Management products, HCM is a significant component of Lawson’s business. It is also a key growth market that the company is targeting with new solutions like Lawson Talent Management, Lawson Workforce Management and now HR Service Delivery.\n\n“Companies want to transform how HR services are delivered to their employees, simplify these services and reduce the costs associated with them,” said Larry Dunivan, senior vice president of Human Capital Management products for Lawson. “This acquisition extends the level and quality of self-service capabilities. It delivers greater value to the employee as well as the employer. At the same time, Enwisen customers will benefit from Lawson’s strength, leadership and commitment to advancing HR service delivery solutions as a key component of HR transformation.”"
