        "text": "Boise, ID /PRNewswire - CIBER, Inc. CBR -4.57% , a global information technology consulting and managed services company, signed an eighteen-month contract with the City of Boise for a multi-application deployment of Lawson Software's Human Resource Management, Enterprise Financial Management and Supply Chain Management suites. This project, dubbed \"Vision 2020\" by the City of Boise, will help streamline operations, eliminate redundant systems, and reduce liability to make operations more efficient and cost effective.\n\nThe City of Boise is home to more than 211,000 residents. It has been named three times as one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People by America's Promise Alliance. Boise is home to Boise State University, the state's largest university with an enrollment of more than 19,500 students, as well as 34 grade schools, 9 junior high schools, and 5 high schools.\n\nThe City of Boise was exploring a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution, because of limitations of its existing system, which is not integrated with all of the city's systems and has proven challenging and expensive to maintain. The city completed an analysis that determined the implementation of a new ERP system could save more than $3.8M over a 10 year period. As a result, the City of Boise selected Lawson software and chose CIBER to perform the implementation - due to the depth and breadth of its experience with ERP implementations in the public sector. Lawson Professional Services will provide project team training and other select services.\n\n\"This project will help improve current business processes and enable improved decision making city-wide. With the new system we will save money and institute operational improvements, which will ultimately help us better serve constituents,\" said Garry Beaty, CIO of City of Boise. \"We chose CIBER as an implementation partner because of its focus and proven experience with process improvement and change management in ERP implementations in both the public and private sector.\"\n\nCIBER ERP Practice Leader Paul Robson said, \"CIBER's ERP expertise in the public sector, combined with our collaborative and disciplined approach to implementation, will help ensure that the city of Boise and its constituents have an efficient and robust system that provides a solid foundation for operations at a lower cost of ownership over the long term. CIBER looks forward to working with the City of Boise and leveraging our strong partnership with Lawson to make the project successful.\"\n\nAbout CIBER, Inc.\n\nCIBER, Inc. is a global information technology consulting, services and outsourcing company applying practical innovation through services and solutions that deliver tangible results for both commercial and government clients.
