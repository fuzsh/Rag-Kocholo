        "text": "HERNDON, Va., Jan. 31, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ePlus inc. (Nasdaq:PLUS) announced that on January 27, 2011, a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia unanimously found that Lawson Software, Inc. infringed ePlus patents relating to electronic procurement systems. The jury determined that all ePlus patent claims tried in court were valid.\n\nThe jury found that three different configurations of Lawson Supply Chain Management products infringed 11 claims of the ePlus patents. These configurations contain several Lawson products, including Lawson System Foundation, Process Flow, Requisitions, Inventory Control, Purchase Order, Requisitions Self Service, Procurement Punchout and EDI. These products are components of the Lawson S3 Supply Chain Management suite. The jury verdict also extends to Lawson's M3 e-Procurement software.\n\nThe jury determined that Lawson directly infringed ePlus' patents and that Lawson also induced and contributed to the infringement of the ePlus patents by Lawson's customers. The federal court has scheduled a hearing for March 3, 2011 concerning ePlus' request for an immediate injunction to prevent Lawson's infringing activity and operations. ePlus seeks an injunction to preclude not only Lawson's sales of its infringing software products, but also any of Lawson's maintenance, installation, implementation and other services for its infringing software products.\n\nThe ePlus patents involve electronic procurement, and the inventions allow end-users to perform a wide variety of functions, including, but not limited to:\n\nperform electronic searches, selections and comparisons as well as review items in multiple supplier catalogs;\n\nfind equivalent items and suitable replacements;\n\ngenerate purchase orders from multiple vendors; and\n\nelectronically check inventory.\n\n\"The United States patent laws have promoted the development of new and useful technologies, like the ePlus patents, for over 200 years,\" said Ken Farber, president of ePlus' software subsidiaries. \"This jury finding shows that companies like ePlus can continue to innovate and invent with the assurance that their investment will be preserved. We are very pleased with the verdict, which once again affirmed that our patents are valid.\"\n\nAbout ePlus inc.\n\nePlus is a leading provider of technology solutions. ePlus enables organizations to optimize their IT infrastructure and supply chain processes by delivering world-class IT products from top manufacturers, professional services, flexible lease financing, proprietary software, and patented business methods.
