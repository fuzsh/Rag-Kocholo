        "text": "Merit-based academic scholarships make the assumption that we are living in a society that is not only a meritocracy, but one that provides an equitable starting point for each person(s) involved. This is not the case for Black students in America. Oftentimes, opportunities to succeed in K-12 and higher education institutions are based on the economic standing of the student’s parents; the net worth of the average white family is nearly ten times more than that of the average Black family. Additionally, several studies have shown evidence of racial bias in standardized tests like the ACT and SAT. There are a myriad of factors that contribute to such a lopsided educational system, the chief among them being the deleterious and harmful effects of institutional and systemic racism.\n\nWe endeavored to create a scholarship fund that takes into account the disadvantages that Black students face on their educational path. Very bright students are not always able to get the 4.0 GPA or the 36 on the ACT due to circumstance, lack of resources, and biased and Eurocentric curricula, and therefore may not have the same access to traditional merit-based scholarships as white students. Providing scholarship opportunities whose submission criteria focus on Afrocentric history and Arts & Humanities may help to level the playing field.\n\nSeeing the disproportionately devastating effects that the Covid-19 pandemic had, and continues to have, on the Black community, we felt compelled to contribute to the uplifting of our people, Black people, in some way, shape, or form. Since Education Access & Quality are key Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), we figured that increasing access to quality education was a good place to begin.\n\nOur papa, the late Bishop Lawson Porter, after whom the foundation is named, instilled in us and our family the value of being in the service of others. He often said, “The only time you should be looking down at someone is when you are bending over to help them off the ground,” and those are words we live by. As a pastor, father of fifteen children, and grandfather to over fifty grandchildren, he was very familiar with being in the service of others. He passed his passion for knowledge and learning down to each of us, and we hope to spread that passion to each of you, as well as some monetary resources to access that knowledge."
