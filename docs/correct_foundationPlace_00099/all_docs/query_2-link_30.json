(\"Gartner\"), and are not representations of fact. Each Gartner Report speaks as of its original publication date (and not as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and the opinions expressed in the Gartner Reports are subject to change without notice.\n\nPart I\n\nWhen we refer to \"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" \"the Company,\" \"Lawson\" or \"Lawson Software,\" we mean Lawson Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our fiscal year mean the fiscal year ended on May 31 of such year.\n\nItem 1. Business\n\nGeneral\n\nLawson Software, Inc. is a global provider of enterprise software. We provide business application software, consulting and maintenance to customers primarily in specific services, trade and manufacturing/distribution industries. We specialize in and target specific industries through our three reportable segments: S3 Strategic Industries segment which targets customers in the healthcare and public sector industries as well as the horizontal market for our human capital management product line, M3 Strategic Industries segment which targets customers in the equipment service management & rental, food & beverage and fashion industries, and our General Industries segment which includes our services industries (S3) customers and manufacturing & distribution industries (M3) customers which are in industries not included in our other two industries groups. Our goal is to be the global leader in our target markets, with a particular focus on meeting the needs of mid-market customers.\n\nOur mission is to make our customers stronger. We offer a broad range of software applications and industry-specific solutions that help our customers improve their business processes and reduce\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncosts, resulting in better business or operational performance. Lawson solutions help automate and integrate business processes and promote collaboration among our customers and their partners, suppliers and employees. Through our consulting services, we help our customers implement, learn to use, upgrade and optimize their Lawson applications. Through our support services, we provide ongoing maintenance and assistance to our customers.\n\nLawson serves customers in three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia-Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand (APAC). We provide software in 16 languages to our customers in 68 countries and have approximately 3,900 employees throughout the world.\n\nWe generate revenues in three ways: 1) software license fees; 2) customer support and maintenance; and 3) consulting services. We market and sell our software and services primarily through a direct sales force, which is augmented by channel partners and resellers.\n\nDuring fiscal 2009 and prior years, we viewed our operations and managed our business as one reportable segment: the development and marketing of computer software and related services including consulting, maintenance and customer support. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we reorganized our operations to provide greater focus on and better serve our targeted vertical markets. With this strategic organizational change, including workforce realignment, we determined that we have three reportable segments that align with our three industries groups: S3 Strategic Industries, M3 Strategic Industries and General Industries. See Note 14, Segment and Geographic Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nLawson was founded and incorporated in 1975. In February 2001, we reincorporated in Delaware through a merger with our predecessor, Lawson Associates, Inc., a Minnesota corporation. We established a new Delaware corporation as our parent company as part of the acquisition of Intentia in April 2006.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, Lawson acquired Intentia International AB (Intentia), a Sweden-based provider of enterprise software, in an all-stock transaction valued at $460.9 million. The combination with Intentia increased Lawson's operational scale, product portfolio and geographic reach to compete in the global enterprise software market.\n\nOn January 11, 2010, we acquired Healthvision, a Dallas-based company providing integration and application technology and related services to hospitals and large healthcare organizations, for $160.0 million in cash. The acquisition of Healthvision is a strategic fit for our Lawson Healthcare customers within our S3 Strategic Industries segment. See Note 4, Business Combinations, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nWe have made significant investments over the past few years in establishing our global support center in Manila, Philippines. This facility employs over 800 employees and provides our customers product development, consulting services, support and delivery at competitive global rates. In addition, the Manila team provides shared services to our IT, finance and other corporate functions.\n\nLawson has offices in 26 countries. Our principal executive office is at 380 Saint Peter Street, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55102-1302. Our telephone number is +1-651-767-7000. Our website is www.lawson.com. Other than the information expressly set forth in this annual report, the information contained or referred to on our website is not part of this annual report.\n\nEnvironment\n\nWe face a competitive and challenging environment for sales of our software and services. Industry consolidation continues to be a primary factor shaping the selling environment. Our focus on specific industries and our low total cost of ownership continue to be our primary competitive differentiators in this environment.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nConsolidation\n\nIn recent years, the enterprise software industry has consolidated, driven by mergers and acquisitions. This activity has included larger companies making acquisitions purely to acquire a customer base or to fill out their product lines, creating \"horizontal\" providers of most forms of enterprise software. It has also involved smaller companies joining forces to better compete in the market. Oracle Corporation has been the most active in our industry, acquiring approximately 50 companies since 2005. Of note, Oracle acquired PeopleSoft Inc. in 2005 (which had acquired J.D. Edwards & Company in 2003), Retek Inc. in 2005, Siebel Systems Inc. in 2006, Hyperion Solutions Corporation in 2007, BEA Systems Inc. in 2008 and Sun Micro Systems Inc. in January 2010. Other major acquisitions in our industry include Infor Global Solutions acquiring SSA Global in July 2006 and SAP AG purchasing Business Objects S.A. in 2008 and most recently their announced intent to acquire Sybase, Inc.\n\nWhile this consolidation has created larger companies with broad product lines, it has also resulted in fewer competitors providing less choice for customers. As a result, we believe this consolidation has created an opportunity for Lawson to serve customers that may have budget or IT-resource constraints or are simply interested in another option to the two or three large vendors. For many customers, we present a competitive alternative to the large horizontal providers while maintaining an ability to compete with smaller niche providers.\n\nFocusing on Specific Industries and the Mid-Market\n\nLawson strives to be a compelling choice to certain enterprise software customers. We believe that we have developed competitive advantages in serving several specific industries and mid-market companies. As a result, we target specific industries, including manufacturing & distribution, healthcare, public sector (U.S.), service industries, equipment service management & rental, food & beverage and fashion as well as the horizontal market for our human capital management product line. We believe an industry-specific focus is fundamental to our ability to help our customers achieve their desired results and derive greater value from their enterprise software investments.\n\nOur industry-specific focus helps us develop industry-specific solutions, provide industry-specific expertise to sell and implement these solutions and offer industry-specific support on an ongoing basis. This industry orientation helps differentiate Lawson and enables us to present Lawson not only as a competitive alternative but also as a compelling choice.\n\nAt the same time, many of our products have broad application across multiple industries and are well-suited for customers outside our targeted industries. Many companies seek general enterprise software and not necessarily industry-specific solutions. Over the years, Lawson has developed an expertise serving mid-to-large size customers and this so-called mid-market now comprises the vast majority of our customer base. While the effects of the weakened global economy had a significant impact in fiscal 2009 and 2010 and will continue to be felt in fiscal 2011, we consider the mid-market to have growth potential for enterprise software during the next few years. Our \"horizontal\" productshuman capital management, enterprise financial management, business intelligence and asset managementare well-suited for these types of mid-market opportunities. The Gartner Report \"Forecast: Small and Midsize Business ERP Software, North America, 2008-2013\" published in November, 2009 estimated that total revenues for the ERP Upper Midmarket in North America declined by 1.3% in 2009. However, the report also forecasts that same market segment to grow 4.6% in both 2010 and 2011 to over $1.4 billion in total revenues. The market recovery in Western Europe is expected to take longer. The Gartner Report \"Forecast: Small and Midsize Business ERP Software, Western Europe, 2008-2013\" published in February 2010 estimated that total revenues for the ERP Upper Midmarket in Western Europe declined by 3.0% in 2009. An additional decline of 0.5% is forecasted for 2010, before rebounding 4.1% to 1.36 billion Euros in 2011. Increasingly, businesses within this category are looking to buy, add to or replace the systems they are using to help manage\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntheir financial, human resources, procurement, distribution or other business management processes. Within the Gartner North American forecast above, the human capital management submarket in North America also had a slight decline in 2009, but is forecasted to rebound quickly with growth rates in excess of 9% in both 2010 and 2011, reaching a total of $477.0 million in total revenues.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe enterprise software industry is intensely competitive, rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product offerings and other market activities. Some of our competitors have an advantage over us due to their larger customer bases, larger technical staffs, greater brand name recognition and greater financial and marketing resources. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting our market include:\n\n\n\nproduct features, functionality, performance and price;\n\n\n\nknowledge of a customer's industry and tailored solutions;\n\n\n\ncompany stability, resources and reputation;\n\n\n\nease of integration and speed of implementation;\n\n\n\nlevel of customer service;\n\n\n\nsales and marketing efforts; and\n\n\n\nnew product and technology introductions.\n\nWe believe Lawson has competitive advantages over a number of our competitors. Some of these advantages include:\n\n\n\n35 years of experience serving mid-market customers;\n\n\n\nlow total cost of ownership;\n\n\n\nindustry-specific experience and expertise;\n\n\n\nindustry-focused solutions; and\n\n\n\nopenness and flexibility of our software architecture.\n\nLawson's most frequently encountered competitors are SAP AG and Oracle Corporation. Both are large, global vendors that are increasingly targeting mid-sized businesses, particularly as their traditional larger-customer market becomes saturated. We believe there is demand for a vendor like Lawson that can offer scalable applications that are simpler to implement and operate than the more complex applications of SAP and Oracle. Our focus is on delivering simpler solutions with lower total ownership costs including license fees, consulting services and on going customer support.\n\nAs a large, strong, global company, we believe Lawson can compete and win against SAP and Oracle, especially customer opportunities in mid-sized organizations or in our targeted industries. By increasing our scale and the range of our products, we believe Lawson also provides an alternative to attempts by Microsoft, another significant competitor, to move into the mid-market segment.\n\nLawson has also strengthened its competitive position by launching innovative new products like Lawson Smart Office, Lawson Enterprise Search, Lawson Human Capital Management, Lawson System Foundation and Lawson QuickStep solutions. Increasingly, we are generating applications using our Landmark Application Designer, a proprietary application design tool that significantly reduces the lines of software code in applications. We have also significantly improved our consulting and maintenance offerings to give our customers greater choice in how we install and support their Lawson applications and technology.\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProducts and Services\n\nSoftware\n\nOur software products include applications and technology. Applications consist of the Lawson S3 Enterprise Management System, the Lawson M3 Enterprise Management System and the Lawson Human Capital Management System. Technology consists of the Lawson Business Process Platform on which Lawson applications run and the Lawson User Productivity Platform which searches, collects and analyzes data from the Lawson applications as depicted below:\n\nLawson S3 Enterprise Management SystemLawson S3 applications help customers \"staff, source and serve\" in their respective markets. The Lawson S3 product line is specifically designed for services industries.\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLawson M3 Enterprise Management SystemLawson M3 applications help customers who \"make, move and maintain\" goods or equipment in their markets. The Lawson M3 product line is geared for manufacturing and trade-oriented businesses facing resource constraints and whose processes are often complex and industry-specific.\n\nLawson Human Capital Management (HCM) Products and SolutionsApplications in the Lawson HCM product line provide solutions for customers to strategically manage their workforce. The Lawson\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHCM product line is a full suite of products that helps customers transform the role of the Human Resources (HR) professional from an administrative and policy enforcing role to that of a strategic business partner.\n\nLawson TechnologyThe platform to run all Lawson applications and tools to search, collect and analyze data.\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMaintenance and Customer Support\n\nOur customer support programs include software upgrades, updates and corrections for the software under maintenance, as well as various levels of support including access to our knowledge base and the Lawson support team, technical advice, and application management. These programs, Lawson Bronze and Lawson Silver maintenance agreements, are comprehensive customer care programs which entitle our customers to various levels of support to meet their specific needs. Our maintenance and customer support offerings are delivered through the Lawson Global Support organization operating from our state-of-the-art support centers around the world.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nOur consulting services range from the initial assessment and planning of a project to the actual implementation and post implementation of a project, including optimizing a customer's use of their Lawson software. We also provide training and learning tools via Lawson Learning to help our customers become proficient in using Lawson software quickly and effectively.\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCloud Services\n\nAnnounced in the spring of 2010, Lawson Cloud Services brings the benefits of cloud computing to external (off-premise) and internal (on-premise) deployments of Lawson software applications.\n\nLawson External Cloud Services combines full-function ERP software from Lawson with industry-leading cloud technology from Amazon Web Services. Lawson External Cloud Services includes our Lawson S3 Enterprise Management System, Lawson M3 Enterprise Management System and Lawson Talent Management. As part of the Lawson External Cloud Services offering, Lawson's flexible pricing gives our customers the choice of paying for their software by subscription or perpetual license.\n\nLawson Internal Cloud Services brings the benefits of software virtualization and cloud computing to our customers who want an on-premise deployment of their Lawson solutions. Lawson Internal Cloud Services utilizes the innovative Lawson Cloud Console and the first two of what Lawson plans to be a series of \"virtual appliances.\" The first virtual appliances are Lawson Smart Office and Lawson Enterprise Search. Virtual Appliances are \"pre-assembled\" software bundles that eliminate the arduous, time-consuming process of manually installing software.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nWe market and sell our software and services solutions primarily through a direct sales force, augmented by strategic alliances with systems integrators and resellers. Our direct sales force and services organizations are aligned with our strategy of providing industry-tailored applications. Within each industry, we have a sales team dedicated to prospective customers and another dedicated to existing customers. We also have regional sales teams that focus on specific geographic territories. Our sales and service offices are located in three geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA and APAC.\n\nIn addition to our direct sales teams, we enter into strategic alliances with systems integrators and resellers to benefit from our partners' resources, expertise and customer base. Business partner alliances allow us to expand our market presence through increased awareness of our software applications within our partners' organizations and customer bases, and through their personnel who are trained to implement our software. Our channel partners market and promote our software products and typically provide implementation services to their end-users. Channel partners generate sales leads, make initial customer contacts, and assess needs prior to our introduction. In addition, some of our channel partners engage in customer support and localization of our products. We also engage in joint marketing programs, presentations at seminars, attendance at trade shows, and the hosting of conferences with many of our business partners.\n\nWe also use application service providers (ASPs) to distribute our products in a hosted environment. ASPs allow us to reach small-to-medium sized businesses that prefer a hosted solution. Our software's architecture is easily distributed over the Internet and is highly scalable to serve many customers. It also supports multi-tenancy, which lets ASPs securely host multiple customers on a single set of our applications.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nSince our inception, we have made substantial investments in software product development. We believe that timely development of new software applications, enhancements to existing software applications and the acquisition of rights to sell or incorporate complementary technologies and products into our software offerings are essential to maintain our competitive position in the market. The business application software market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products, changes in customer demands and rapidly evolving industry standards.\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are committed to continued investment in R&D to enhance our existing products as well as developing new applications using our Landmark development tool for our Lawson S3, Lawson M3 and Lawson Human Capital Management product lines.\n\nOur total research and development expenses were $90.3 million, $82.4 million and $85.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008; respectively. As of May 31, 2010, our research and development organization consisted of approximately 1,000 employees. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further discussion of R&D expenses.\n\nTrademarks\n\n\"Lawson\" and \"Lawson Software\" are registered trademarks in the U.S. and the European Union. Other trademarks and trade names appearing in this document are the property of their respective holders.\n\nIntellectual Property and Product Liability\n\nWe regard certain aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation as proprietary, and rely on a combination of contract, copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and other measures, including confidentiality agreements, to protect our proprietary information. We currently hold 11 patents in the U.S. Existing copyright laws afford only limited protection. We believe that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of support services. We cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate, or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. Historically, we have provided our customers source code for many of our products. We may elect to distribute only object code in the future. In either case, we will permit customers to obtain access to our other source code through a source code escrow arrangement. Access to our source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our software products are, or may be licensed, do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. and Sweden.\n\nWe do not believe our software products, third-party software products we offer under sublicense agreements, our trademarks, or other Lawson proprietary rights infringe the property rights of third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation. As described in this report under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, we are currently defending three separate and unrelated patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. Under the license agreements with our customers, we agree to indemnify our customers for third-party claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of those third parties.\n\nWe are also exposed to product liability risks under applicable country and state laws. We generally attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims with customers as part of our license agreements. However, local laws or unfavorable judicial decisions might diminish or invalidate the scope of these limitations.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of May 31, 2010, we had approximately 3,900 employees, including approximately 600 in sales and marketing, approximately 1,000 in research and development, approximately 1,700 in services and customer support and approximately 600 in administration. None of our employees in the U.S. are\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nrepresented by a labor union. We are party to a collective labor agreement applicable to our employees in Sweden and in certain other international subsidiaries workers' councils represent our employees.\n\nExecutive Officers\n\nThe following sets forth our executive officers as of June 30, 2010, their age, position and a brief description of their business experience:\n\nHarry Debes has served as our president and chief executive officer and as a director since June 2005.

The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFactors That May Affect Our Future Results or the Market Price of Our Stock\n\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks. Investors evaluating our company and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. Any of the following factors could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition and/or negatively affect our stock price. Additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may make forward-looking statements from time to time, both written and oral. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements based on circumstances or events which occur in the future. The actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report.\n\nThe weakened global economy has negatively impacted our contracting activity and revenue, required that we reduce our expenses and imposed risks on our business.\n\nSome prospective and existing customers have cancelled, delayed or downsized software purchases and implementation projects because of the adverse economy and their internal budget constraints. Some customers may also experience difficulty in paying us for previously purchased products and services. The adverse economic environment has also intensified the difficulty of forecasting software license and services revenue due, in part, to the lengthening and uncertainty of the sales cycle. A decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenue in the same or subsequent quarters. Lower licensing activity will also lower new maintenance revenue since maintenance fees for new product licenses are based on the amount of associated license fees. We took steps in fiscal 2009 and 2010 to reduce headcount and lower expenses. Despite our efforts to focus on new sales of products and services and to manage our expenses, there is risk that we will not be able to achieve our business plan during this difficult global economic environment.\n\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results.\n\nThe uncertainty posed by the weakened global economy, volatile credit markets, escalating energy prices, terrorist activities, potential pandemics, natural disasters and related uncertainties and risks and other geopolitical issues may impact the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers. Because of these factors, we believe the level of demand for our products and services and projections of future revenue and operating results, will continue to be difficult to predict. These geopolitical risks could also impede employee travel and our business operations in any affected regions.\n\nWe face large, established competitors, specialized competitors and substantial price competition.\n\nWe compete with Oracle Corporation, SAP AG, Microsoft Corporation and other larger software companies that have advantages over us due to their larger customer bases, greater name recognition, long operating and product development history, greater international presence and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources. If customers or prospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors, they may elect to purchase competing products from Oracle, SAP, or Microsoft since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products. Furthermore, Oracle is capable of bundling its software with its database applications, which underlie a significant portion of our installed\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\napplications. We also compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors, including:\n\n\n\nsingle-industry software vendors;\n\n\n\nhuman resource management software vendors;\n\n\n\nfinancial management software vendors;\n\n\n\nmanufacturing software vendors;\n\n\n\nmerchandising software vendors;\n\n\n\nservices automation software vendors;\n\n\n\nsoftware integrators and outsourced services providers; and\n\n\n\ninternet (on demand) software vendors.\n\nSome competitors offer payment terms, contractual warranties, implementation terms or guarantees that are more favorable to customers and prospects. Competitors may entice our customers and prospects to switch software vendors by offering those customers or prospects free or heavily discounted products or services, and other more favorable contract terms. We may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers that lower our margins and increase our risks. We expect competition to persist and intensify, which could negatively impact our operating results and market share.\n\nWe may have exposure to potential impairment charges related to our goodwill and acquired intangible assets.\n\nWe have made several acquisitions over the past few years, primarily the acquisition of Intentia in April 2006 and Healthvision in January 2010. As a result of these acquisitions, we have recorded on our balance sheet approximately $525.6 million of goodwill and $159.7 million of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, as of May 31, 2010. We may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or our acquired intangible assets if we determine that the fair value of the goodwill and/or our acquired intangible assets is less than their current carrying value. In general, this could occur if the fair value of our applicable reporting units declines to an amount below the carrying value of such reporting units, or if we do not anticipate that the acquired intangibles will generate future cash flows in-line with our expectations as established at the date of acquisition. In fiscal 2010, we reorganized our operations into vertically focused operating segments resulting in our allocation of goodwill to each of our separate reporting units. As a consequence, we are required to test for potential goodwill impairment at the reporting unit levels. Recording an impairment charge related to our goodwill or acquired intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\n\nOur revenues, and in particular our software license revenues, vary each quarter and are difficult to predict.\n\nRevenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our licensing activity with new and existing customers, and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter under our revenue recognition policies. A significant portion of our future revenue is dependent upon our existing installed base of customers continuing to license additional products, as well as purchasing consulting services and renewing their annual maintenance agreements. If we do not continue to develop or acquire new products, licensing activity with existing customers will decline. Licensing activity for our products drives maintenance and services revenues because we sell maintenance and services for only our products. A decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenue in the\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nsame or subsequent quarters. If we do not have sufficient new licensing activity each year, our maintenance revenue and profit for the following year will decline because new customers or sales of additional products to existing customers are needed to offset the percentage of existing customers who scale back their businesses, reduce licenses and maintenance contracts, are acquired, or otherwise choose not to renew annual maintenance. Our sales force and marketing team must continue to generate sales leads among existing customers and prospective customers. When we \"qualify\" a lead, that lead becomes part of our sales \"pipeline.\" If our pipeline does not continue to grow in our different markets and geographies, our revenues will eventually decline. The rate at which we convert our pipeline into actual sales can vary greatly from year to year for the following reasons:\n\n\n\nThe period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary and can be more than one year. During the sales cycle, prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down purchases because of competing offers, budgetary constraints or changes in the prospect's management, strategy, business or industry. Increasingly, customer or prospect organizations are taking more steps to approve the purchase of our products and services. Often times, we must wait for a customer or prospect's board of directors to approve a purchase. These added approval requirements can delay the sales cycle and jeopardize the likelihood of completing the sale.\n\n\n\nA substantial number of our existing and prospective customers make their purchase decision within the last few weeks or days of each quarter. A delay or deferral in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause our quarterly license revenue to fall significantly short of our predictions.\n\n\n\nProspective customers may decline or defer the purchase of new products if we do not have sufficient customer references for those products.\n\n\n\nNew products or technologies, software industry mergers and other software industry news may create uncertainty and cause customers and prospective customers to cancel, postpone or reduce capital spending for our products.\n\nBecause a substantial portion of our software license revenue contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter, and our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, unexpected revenue shortfalls and deferrals have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability.\n\nWe may not retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products.\n\nThe enterprise software market is faced with rapid technological change, evolving standards in computer hardware, software development, communications and security infrastructure, and changing needs and expectations of customers. Building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in development. A substantial portion of our research and development resources are devoted to regulatory and maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support. These demands put significant constraints on our resources available for new product development. We also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products.\n\nWe may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments; and any acquisitions and investments we do complete may create business difficulties or dilute earnings.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms. If we acquire a company, we may incur losses in the operations of that\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncompany and we may have difficulty integrating its products, personnel and/or operations into our business. In addition, its key personnel may decide not to work for us. These difficulties could disrupt our on-going business, distract our management and workforce, increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business. Furthermore, we may incur significant debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. The issuance of equity securities may be dilutive to our stockholders. If the products of an acquired company are not successful, those remaining assets could become impaired, which may result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\nCompetitors may take advantage of our limited intellectual property protection.\n\nWe consider certain aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of contract, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect this information. In addition, we currently hold 11 patents in the U. S. Copyright laws afford only limited protection because those laws do not protect product ideas. In addition, when we license our products to customers, we provide source code for many of our products. Customers may also access source code through a source code escrow arrangement. Access to our source code could provide an opportunity for companies to offer competing maintenance and product modification services to our customers. Defending our intellectual property rights is time consuming and costly.\n\nOthers may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights.\n\nMany participants in the technology industry, and patent holding companies who have no independent product revenue, have an increasing number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to take legal action based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement. These types of claims are time consuming and costly to defend. As described in this report under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, we are currently defending three separate and unrelated patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nOur products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects or security flaws or be implemented incorrectly.\n\nBecause our products are deployed in large and complex systems, they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time. Our software programs may contain undetected defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. Our customers might encounter difficulties with the implementation of our products, experience corruption of their data or encounter performance or scaling problems only after our software programs have been deployed. The services needed for implementing our products are also complex, and require knowledge and cooperation between both the customer's and the service provider's teams. As a consequence, from time to time we have received customer complaints or been sued. In addition, our products are combined with products from other vendors. As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Software and data security are becoming increasingly important because of regulatory restrictions on data privacy and the significant legal exposures and business disruptions stemming from computer viruses and other unauthorized entry or use of computer systems. We may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance, software security or the provision of services. Product defects and security flaws could expose us to product liability and warranty claims and harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services.\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe success of our recently announced Lawson Cloud Services offering could be adversely impacted by deployment problems, security breaches, or system or telecommunication disruptions.\n\nLawson Cloud Services is new and could encounter unexpected problems. These problems could be attributable to our products, third party software, telecommunications failures, security breaches, or the cloud technology from Amazon Web Services or other hosting providers. We are in the early stages of rolling out this new offering and have not yet established the range of customer references that will be needed for Lawson Cloud Services to be a success. Industry acceptance of cloud computing is still forming. Since cloud technology is new and requires that customer data reside outside of a customer's \"fire wall\" of protection, many prospective customers could reject or delay adoption, thereby limiting the potential for this new offering. Other limitations include product and network scalability for large numbers of users. We must also renegotiate some of our third-party software contracts so that we can deploy the Lawson Cloud Services using an instance of the entire range of required software, including the software owned by those third parties. These types of risks could adversely affect our adoption and renewal rates for Lawson Cloud Services and adversely impact our ability to achieve our business plan and forecasted financial results.\n\nDeterioration in our relationships with resellers, systems integrators and other third-parties that market and sell our products could reduce our revenues.\n\nOur revenue growth will depend, in part, on adding new partners to expand our sales channels, as well as leveraging our relationships with existing partners. If our relationships with these resellers, system integrators and strategic and technology partners deteriorate or terminate, we may lose sales and marketing opportunities. Some current and potential customers rely on third-party systems integrators to implement and manage new and existing applications. These systems integrators may increase their promotion of competing enterprise software applications, or may otherwise discontinue their relationships with us.\n\nBecause we do not own all of the products that we license, we rely on our continued relationships with other software suppliers.\n\nWe license third-party software products that we incorporate into, or resell with, our own software products. For example, we incorporate in many of our products software supplied by Micro Focus International, Inc. and StreamServe, Inc. We also have reseller and alliance relationships with IBM, Business Software Incorporated and other software suppliers businesses that allow us to resell their offerings with our products and services. These relationships and other technology licenses are subject to periodic renewal and may include minimum sales requirements. A failure to renew or early termination of these relationships or other technology licenses could adversely impact our business.\n\nInternational sales and operations subject us to risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include software development, sales, customer support and administration. We face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, overlapping tax regimes, difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. We must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations, including trade restrictions, local labor ordinances, and import and export requirements.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\n\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our revenues and operating results are affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Swedish Krona, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound as well as the Norwegian Krona relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our revenues and operating results. Recognized balance sheet exposures are partially offset by forward currency contracts that we purchase. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, resulting primarily from recognized balance sheet exposures, are recorded within earnings in the period incurred.\n\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and industry throughout the world. We are subject to various legal proceedings and the risk of litigation by employees, customers, patent owners, suppliers, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings or other litigation. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive, and disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted with certainty. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOpen source software may diminish our license fees and impair the ownership of our products.\n\nThe open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of companies, software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use, distribution and modification, often free of charge. Open source software, such as the Linux operating system, has been gaining in popularity among business users. If developers contribute enterprise application software to the open source community, and that software has competitive features and scale to business users in our markets, we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete. If one of our developers embedded open source components into one of our products, without our knowledge or authorization, our ownership and licensing of that product could be in jeopardy. Depending on the open source license terms, the use of an open source component could mean that all products delivered with that open source component become part of the open source community. In that case, we would not own those delivered products and could not charge license fees for those products. We currently take steps to train our developers and monitor the content of products in development, but there is no assurance that these steps will always be effective.\n\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nA significant portion of our critical business operations, including research and development, product maintenance, services support, and general and administrative support, are concentrated in a few geographic areas. A disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing maintenance and services to customers. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur profit margin for consulting services is lower than margins related to the other aspects of our business.\n\nThe consulting part of our business is highly competitive, is less proprietary, and carries a much lower gross margin than the other aspects of our business. Our consulting services business is highly\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nsensitive to customer demands, competitive pressures and other external and internal forces. Our actions to improve our consulting services margin may be offset by these forces which could negatively impact our operating results.\n\nWe must attract and retain account executives in our sales organization to achieve our revenue goals.\n\nRevenue growth, and in particular software license revenue growth, requires that we have a sufficient number of trained account executives in our sales organization to develop leads and call on prospective customers. Competition in our industry for experienced account executives is intense. Competitors and other software companies may lure away our account executives through signing bonuses and other special incentives. The failure to attract and retain account executives will negatively impact our revenue growth. When we hire a new account executive, the time period required for that person to become productive will vary, depending on their experience and training and the customer pipeline and length of sales cycle.\n\nIf we are unable to attract and retain senior management, software developers, services consultants, finance and accounting specialists, and other qualified personnel, we will be unable to develop new products and increase our revenue and profitability.\n\nWe also rely on the continued service of our senior management, software developers, services consultants, finance and accounting specialists, and other key employees. In the software industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical, financial and other personnel. The failure to attract, train, retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service. If we are unable to attract and retain finance and accounting personnel who have experience with the software industry and U. S. accounting requirements, we will have to rely on more costly contractors to fill the roles necessary for us to meet our governance and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe are required to delay revenue recognition into future periods for portions of our license fee activity.\n\nOur entire worldwide business is subject to United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Under those rules, we are required to defer revenue recognition for license fees in situations that include the following:\n\n\n\nthe customer agreement includes products that are under development or has other undelivered elements;\n\n\n\nthe customer agreement includes essential services, including significant modifications, customization or complex interfaces (this is more prevalent with our M3 products);\n\n\n\nthe customer agreement includes acceptance criteria;\n\n\n\nthe customer agreement includes extended or contingent payment terms or fees;\n\n\n\na third-party vendor, whose technology is incorporated into our products, delays delivery of its product to the customer;\n\n\n\nthe customer agreement includes a fixed-fee service arrangement for which we do not have \"vendor specific objective evidence\" (VSOE) of fair value; or\n\n\n\nwe are not able to establish historical pricing and maintenance renewal rates to meet the VSOE requirements of these accounting rules.\n\nWe expect that we will continue to defer recognition of portions of our license fee activity in each period because of these factors, with deferrals more likely for (a) our M3 products because of product customization (often required due to the nature of the manufacturing and distribution industries) that\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nis frequently included with new sales, (b) sales to governmental entities because those often include fixed-fee arrangements for which we do not have VSOE of fair value, and (c) sales of large license fee contracts because it is more difficult to use standard contract terms. The amount of license fees deferred may be significant and will vary each quarter, depending on the mix of products sold in each market and geography, and the actual contract terms.\n\nWe may take additional restructuring actions that result in financial charges in the period taken.\n\nIn fiscal 2009 and 2010, we took actions to reduce costs in response to the current global economic downturn and as part of our preparation for verticalization of our organization's structure in fiscal 2010. Depending on the continued impact of the global economic downturn and the uncertainty and timing of any recovery, we may decide to take additional restructuring actions to improve our operational efficiencies and we may be required to incur financial charges in the period when we make such decisions, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for that period.\n\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nAs a multinational organization, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. as well as in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, both in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have additional exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities.\n\nOur effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\n\nOur effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\n\n\nchanges in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\n\n\nchanging tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\n\n\nchanges to the financial accounting rules for income taxes;\n\n\n\nunanticipated changes in tax rates;\n\n\n\nchanges in accounting and tax treatment of stock-based compensation;\n\n\n\nthe tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods;\n\n\n\nchanges to the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets; or\n\n\n\nthe assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place.\n\nWe report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Periodically, we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority, and we regularly engage in discussions, and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe have adopted anti-takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of Lawson or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock.\n\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our stockholder rights plan and Delaware law could make it more difficult for other businesses to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third-party:\n\n\n\nadvance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings;\n\n\n\na limitation on who may call stockholder meetings;\n\n\n\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; and\n\n\n\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote.\n\nThe issuance of stock under our stockholder rights plan could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any \"interested stockholder,\" meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors. Any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\n\nStock ownership by officers and directors, or other stockholders accumulating large positions in our stock, could significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval.\n\nAs of May 31, 2010, our executive officers, directors, and affiliated entities, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 11.0% of our outstanding common stock, providing them with voting power to significantly influence matters requiring approval by stockholders. From time to time, activist and hedge fund investors have accumulated large positions in our stock. Holders of large quantities of our stock or groups of stockholders acting together could also significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the nomination and election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. Sales of our common stock by officers, directors or significant stockholders in the public market, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\n\nOur stock price could become more volatile and our stockholders' investments could lose value.\n\nAll of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes could also affect our stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors' or analysts' valuation measures for our stock and market trends unrelated to our performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nOur corporate headquarters and executive offices are in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA where we lease approximately 308,000 square feet of space. The lease on this facility expires July 31, 2015. We also lease approximately 100,000 square feet of space, primarily for regional sales and support offices, elsewhere in the U.S. Additionally, primarily through our location in Stockholm, Sweden, we lease approximately 680,400 square feet of office space in 25 countries used primarily as sales and services offices. Expiration dates of leases on these offices range from 2010 to 2016. We believe that our current domestic and international facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. In addition, we believe suitable additional or alternative space would be available on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate expansion of our operations, if required. The restructuring plans we have implemented over the past few years have involved the exit or reduction in space of certain of our leased facilities. See Note 3, Restructuring, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nPatent Infringement Lawsuit by ePlus. On May 19, 2009, ePlus, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Lawson Software, Inc., Perfect Commerce, Inc., SciQuest, Inc. and Verian Technologies, Inc. The other three defendants subsequently entered into separate confidential settlements and the court dismissed their parts of the lawsuit. The May 2009 complaint alleges that Lawson's supply chain products infringe three U.S. patents owned by ePlus. In that complaint, ePlus seeks damages in an undisclosed amount, enhancement of those damages, an attorneys' fee award and an injunction against further infringement. In May 2010, ePlus quantified its damages claim based on an alleged 5% to 6% royalty on all license, maintenance and services revenues in the United States since November 2003 for a wide range of Lawson's supply chain products. Those alleged royalty damages would total $28.0 to $33.0 million or more, and all or part of that award could be increased up to treble damages by the court, at its discretion, if ePlus proved willful infringement by Lawson. A damages award would also include pre-judgment interest, which could total $6.0 to $8.0 million if ePlus were awarded damages in the amount claimed. ePlus may supplement its damages demand before trial based on updated Lawson sales information. If ePlus proves infringement, the court also has discretion to require Lawson to reimburse ePlus for its legal fees and costs. We are contesting the infringement claims and validity of the patents as well as the time frame and scope of products and services associated with ePlus' damages claim. We are vigorously defending this case because we believe we have meritorious defenses, including non-infringement and patent invalidity. This case is currently scheduled to go to trial in September 2010. If we are not successful in obtaining summary judgment or other resolution before or at trial, at the conclusion of the trial the jury will decide whether or not ePlus has proved that Lawson has infringed, and whether or not Lawson has proved that the patents are invalid. If the jury finds that Lawson failed to prove invalidity of the patents, and if the jury finds that ePlus has proved infringement, then the jury will determine the amount of damages payable by Lawson. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and jury trials, we cannot at this time estimate the possible outcome of this lawsuit. Because patent litigation is time consuming and costly to defend, we will continue to incur significant costs defending this case. In addition, in the event of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows. If ePlus prevails in this lawsuit, we could be required to pay a royalty to ePlus on the sale of certain products and services in the future, and if we could not reach agreement with ePlus on the amount or scope of that royalty, we would have to either stop the sale of those products and services or make modifications to avoid infringement.\n\nPatent Infringement Lawsuit by JuxtaComm. On January 21, 2010, JuxtaComm-Texas Software, LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Lawson Software, Inc., Lawson Software Americas, Inc. and 20 other defendants. One of the\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndefendants, Seco Tools, Inc. is a Lawson customer. Under the terms of our customer license agreement, we have agreed to defend and indemnify Seco Tools in this lawsuit. The complaint alleges that Lawson and the other defendants infringe United States Patent No. 6,195,662 entitled \"System for Transforming and Exchanging Data Between Distributed Heterogeneous Computer Systems.\" JuxtaComm seeks damages in an undisclosed amount, enhancement of those damages, an attorneys' fee award and an injunction against further infringement. On April 22, 2010, JuxtaComm filed an amended complaint, naming Lawson ProcessFlow Integrator and Lawson System Foundation, as well as any products and/or services in the Lawson S3 and Lawson M3 product lines, as allegedly infringing. We intend to vigorously defend this case. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and jury trials, we cannot at this time estimate the possible outcome of this lawsuit. Because patent litigation is time consuming and costly to defend, we could incur significant costs defending this case. In addition, in the event of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows.\n\nPatent Infringement Lawsuit by Aloft Media. On May 14, 2010, Aloft Media, LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Lawson Software, Inc., Lawson Software Americas, Inc. and 12 other defendants. The complaint alleges that Lawson's Planning Workbench for Food and Beverage software product, and possibly other software products, infringe United States Patent Nos. 7,593,910 and 7,596,538, which are each entitled \"Decision-Making System, Method and Computer Program Product.\" Aloft Media seeks, in undisclosed amounts, damages, costs, expenses, interest and royalties. We intend to vigorously defend this case. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and jury trials, we cannot at this time estimate the possible outcome of this lawsuit. Because patent litigation is time consuming and costly to defend, we could incur significant costs defending this case. In addition, in the event of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows.\n\nClass Action Overtime Lawsuit. On May 20, 2008, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of current and former business, systems, and technical consultants. The suit, Cruz, et. al., v. Lawson Software, Inc. et. al., alleged that we failed to pay overtime wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and state law, and alleged violations of state record-keeping requirements. The suit also alleged certain violations of ERISA and unjust enrichment. Relief sought includes back wages, corresponding 401(k) plan credits, liquidated damages, penalties, interest and attorneys' fees. Given the preliminary nature of the alleged claims and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, we cannot at this time estimate the possible outcome of any such action. We successfully moved the case from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to the District of Minnesota. The Minnesota Federal District Court conditionally certified the case under the FLSA as a collective action and granted our motion to dismiss the two ERISA counts and the state wage and hour claims. Plaintiffs moved for Rule 23 class certification but the Court denied their motion. At the present time, the size of the class is limited to the 68 consultants who elected to participate in the lawsuit by filing opt-in forms. The overtime period at issue is two years, which would be increased to three years if the plaintiffs proved that the Company intentionally violated the applicable wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs' damages expert claims total aggregate damages of $10.3 million for a two year period for the 68 consultants and an additional $2.9 million in aggregate damages if the overtime period is three years. Given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and jury trials, we cannot at this time estimate the possible outcome of this lawsuit. On June 30, 2010, Lawson filed a motion to de-certify the FLSA collective action, which, if granted, would limit the action to the five named plaintiffs. That motion will not be heard until November, 2010. As permitted by the present scheduling order, we plan to file a motion for summary judgment asking for dismissal of remaining class members based on their performance of exempt duties and/or making more than $100,000 per year. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in this matter, it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are subject to various other legal proceedings and the risk of litigation by employees, customers, patent owners, suppliers, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings or other litigation. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any one of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\n\nItem 4. (Removed and Reserved)\n\nPart II\n\nItem 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nMarket Information\n\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market System (NASDAQ) under the symbol LWSN. The following table lists the high and low closing sale prices by quarter as reported by NASDAQ.\n\nHolders\n\nAs of July 1, 2010, the approximate number of registered stockholders of record was 195.\n\nDividends\n\nWe have historically not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to reinvest future earnings to fund the operation and expansion of our business and to repurchase shares of our common stock under our board-approved share repurchase program.\n\nStock Performance Graph\n\nThe following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total stockholder returns for Lawson's common stock, the NASDAQ Stock Market Index (U.S. companies) and the Dow Jones U.S. Software Index for the period from May 31, 2005 through May 31, 2010. The graph assumes the investment of $100 on May 31, 2005. The date regarding our common stock assumes an investment at the closing price on May 31, 2005 of $5.92 per share of our common stock. All values assume reinvestment of the full amount of all dividends and are calculated through May 31, 2010. The performance shown in the\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\ngraph below is based upon historical data and is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of our common stock.\n\nPurchases of Equity Securities\n\nOn November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $100.0 million of our common stock. The Board increased this maximum to $200.0 million in April 2007 and to $400.0 million in July 2008. The share repurchases are funded by our existing cash balances and future cash flows. Our share repurchases may occur with transactions structured through investment banking institutions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion. Market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased. There can be no assurance as to the amount, timing or repurchase price of future repurchases, if any, related to the share repurchase program. The program may also be modified, extended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased an aggregate of 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $5.92 per share under the share repurchase program. From inception of the repurchase program through May 31, 2010, we have used $270.9 million to repurchase approximately 32.9 million shares at an average price of $8.23 per share. The repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction to our stockholders' equity. The shares will be used for general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2010, the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was $129.1 million.\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\n\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated financial data as of and for our last five fiscal years and should be read in conjunction with Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to those statements. The selected consolidated financial data has been derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data presented above, our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nManagement Overview\n\nGeneral\n\nLawson Software, Inc. is a global provider of enterprise software. We provide business application software, consulting and maintenance to customers primarily in specific services, trade and manufacturing/distribution industries. We specialize in and target specific industries through our three reportable segments: S3 Strategic Industries segment which targets customers in the healthcare and public sector industries as well as the horizontal market for our Human Capital Management product line, M3 Strategic Industries segment which targets customers in the equipment service management & rental, food & beverage and fashion industries, and our General Industries segment which includes our services industries (S3) customers and manufacturing & distribution industries (M3) customers which are in industries not included in our other two industries groups.\n\nOur software includes enterprise financial management, human capital management, business intelligence, asset management, enterprise performance management, supply chain management, service management, manufacturing operations, business project management and industry-tailored applications. Our applications help automate and integrate critical business processes, which enables our customers to collaborate with their partners, suppliers and employees. We support our customers' use of our applications through consulting services that primarily help our customers implement their Lawson applications, and through our maintenance programs that provide on-going support and product updates for our customers' continued use of our applications.\n\nWe believe our enterprise software solutions provide competitive advantages and business flexibility to our customers. Lawson's solutions fall within three main product lines and include related maintenance and consulting services. Our product lines are referred to as Lawson S3 Enterprise Management System, Lawson M3 Enterprise Management System, and Lawson Human Capital Management with many of the solutions in each product line having broad, cross-industry application. Our S3 solutions consist of business applications designed for service industries. Our M3 solutions consist of applications that are geared for manufacturing, distribution and trade businesses that face resource constraints and whose processes are often complex and industry-specific. Our Human Capital Management applications provide solutions for customers in any industry to strategically manage their workforce.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we acquired Healthvision, a Dallas-based company providing integration and application technology and related services to hospitals and large healthcare organizations. The acquisition of Healthvision is a strategic fit for our healthcare customers within our S3 Strategic Industries segment. Total purchase consideration related to the Healthvision acquisition was $160.0 million, net of cash acquired, and resulted in the recognition of $95.5 million of amortizable intangible assets and $78.2 million in goodwill. Operating results of Healthvision have been included in our results of operations since the acquisition date of January 11, 2010. See Note 4, Business Combinations, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nDemand for our software products and services continues to be negatively impacted by the weakened global economy. This is particularly true in our EMEA region. The unprecedented disruption in the financial markets which began in the fall of 2008 continued to disrupt credit and equity markets worldwide leading to a weakened global economic environment, restricted credit availability, and\n\n29\n\nTable of Contents\n\neconomic uncertainties throughout fiscal 2010. The effect of the weakened global economy and the fallout from the financial market turmoil continued to be a challenge for our license contracting and demand for our services in fiscal 2010. We have experienced a longer sales cycle and increased price sensitivity. Certain current and prospective customers have cancelled, delayed or downsized software purchases and implementation projects because of the adverse economy and their internal budget constraints. Continued economic uncertainties and/or further deterioration of economic conditions could cause further delay or reduce our current and prospective customers' software purchases or implementation projects which may negatively impact our future results. In addition, credit risks associated with our customers/vendors may also be adversely impacted by the current economic conditions. This challenging economic environment has also intensified the difficulty of forecasting software license and consulting services revenues. A decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenues in subsequent quarters. Lower licensing activity will also lower new maintenance revenues since maintenance fees for new product licenses are based on the amount of associated license fees.\n\nIn response to the continued uncertainty in the global economic environment, we have taken actions during fiscal 2010 to reduce our headcount, primarily within our consulting practice in our EMEA region and within our M3 operations in Europe, the U.S. and Manila. It is these areas of our business that have been particularly hard hit by the current global economic conditions. These actions included the elimination of approximately 225 employees, or less than 6.0% of our global workforce. Our results for fiscal 2010 include restructuring charges of approximately $13.2 million relating to these actions. See Note 3, Restructuring, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more information. We continue to closely monitor our discretionary spending while preserving targeted investments that we believe will enable Lawson's long-term growth and increase our operational efficiencies. We may consider possible future actions to reduce our operating costs if circumstances warrant.\n\nOn April 2, 2010, our Benefits Committee approved a plan to modify our defined benefit pension plan in Norway (the Plan). The modification of the Plan resulted in a curtailment of benefits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, when the modifications were approved. Accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The modification of the Plan also led to a settlement of active participants' projected benefits in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 for which we anticipate recording an additional gain of approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. See Note 11, Profit Sharing and 401(k) Retirement Plan, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nDuring fiscal 2009 and prior years, we operated as one business segment, the development and marketing of computer software and related services including consulting, maintenance and customer support. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we reorganized our operations to provide greater focus on and better serve our targeted vertical markets. With this strategic organizational change, including a workforce realignment, we determined that we have three reportable segments that align with our three industries groups: S3 Strategic Industries, M3 Strategic Industries and General Industries. See Note 14, Segment and Geographic Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for additional information. We continue to evaluate our vertical organizational structure and have changed certain management and reporting responsibilities effective June 1, 2010; eliminating our General Industries reportable segment and redistributing responsibility for management of the vertical markets that were part of this segment into our S3 Strategic Industries and M3 Strategic Industries segments. We believe the elimination of our General Industries segment will help us drive more efficiencies and better manage our operations. Commensurate with this organizational change, we expect to begin reporting operating results for two reportable segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.\n\n30\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal 2010 Results\n\nDuring fiscal 2010, within our S3 Strategic Industries segment, we entered into significant transactions within our healthcare and public sector verticals and for our human capital management products. Our acquisition of Healthvision benefitted our healthcare business within this segment. Software spending in our healthcare and public sector verticals has proven more resilient in this weak economy than other industries in which we do business. Despite this resiliency, we believe that public sector budgetary shortfalls will continue to present challenges. Within our M3 Strategic Industries segment, our equipment service management & rental vertical also continued to perform well during fiscal 2010 with increased license fees and consulting revenues as compared to last year. This increase was largely driven by our ability to offer a new end-to-end solution for our customers in this vertical. Our channel partners, primarily third-party resellers, also contributed to the improved licensing activity within our M3 Strategic Industries segment during the year. Certain industry verticals covered by our General Industries segment, particularly manufacturing & distribution, retail and financial services have been hard hit by the continued global economic downturn. Fiscal 2010 licensing activity in this segment increased slightly primarily related to licensing in our services industries vertical, which was offset by decreases in maintenance and consulting revenues for the segment.\n\nRevenues for fiscal 2010 were $736.4 million, down 2.8% compared to $757.3 million in fiscal 2009. Software revenues, consisting of license fees and maintenance services, increased $17.2 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal 2010 as compared to last year. Both our S3 Strategic Industries and M3 Strategic Industries segments experienced growth in fiscal 2010 software revenues. The increase included approximately $9.6 million within our S3 Strategic Industries segment related to our acquisition of Healthvision. Our General Industries segment software revenues declined in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 by $8.2 million. Consulting revenues decreased $38.1 million, or 12.8%, in fiscal 2010 compared to last year primarily in our General Industries segment. The decrease was somewhat offset by the inclusion of Healthvision c"
