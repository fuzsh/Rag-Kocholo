        "text": "<%=company1%>\n\nST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lawson Software (Nasdaq: LWSN) today announced that Central Grocers, Inc. licensed the Lawson M3 Enterprise Finance Management, Supply Chain Management, Customer Sales and Service, and Enterprise Performance Management Suites - along with Lawson System Foundation. The grocery wholesaler and distributor will use the enterprise software applications to help consolidate its financial, supply chain and distribution systems, enhance visibility and reporting, and create a strong technology platform for growth. The contract was signed during Lawson's fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended May 31, 2008.\n\nFormed in 1917 and based in Franklin Park, Ill., Central Grocers is a member-owned grocery wholesaler that supplies food and other merchandise to more than 200 independent grocery retailers in the Chicago metro area and Northwest Indiana. Operating as a cooperative, it distributes products under national brand names as well as its own Centrella brand.\n\nCentral Grocers previously relied on several legacy business systems that lacked the reporting tools necessary to track and analyze data from its expanding operations. \"As our business expands, we need a strong technology base that can help us capitalize on new growth opportunities,\" said Tim Kubis, chief financial officer, Central Grocers, Inc. \"The Lawson system offers the functionality we need to help us improve the efficiency and accuracy of our business processes, which can ultimately help us make better, margin-impacting decisions.\"\n\nOnce implemented, the new Lawson system, which will run on an IBM System i platform, will help Central Grocers employees access and share financial and supply chain data from a single user interface. This will give managers greater visibility into the company's supplier network and merchandise lines, which will help the company optimize inventory levels and quickly respond to supplier needs. The Lawson system's built-in industry best practices also will help the distributor standardize and automate its core business processes.\n\nCentral Grocers will partner with Lawson Professional Services and The Revere Group to implement and maintain the new Lawson system.\n\n\"Overcoming key barriers to growth, such as managing a complex supplier network, requires distributors to react to changing business conditions quickly and effectively,\" said Bob Peterson, global marketing director, Distribution, Lawson. \"Our software and services give distribution companies a comprehensive, scalable business system at a low total cost of ownership, which can help them focus more attention on serving customers.\"\n\nAbout Lawson Software\n\nLawson Software provides software and service solutions to 4,000 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance and service sector industries across 40 countries.
