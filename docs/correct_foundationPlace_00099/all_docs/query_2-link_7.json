        "text": "Skip to content\n\nFlexible Reporting, Business Intelligence, and Analytics Software Solutions for Lawson ERP\n\nLawson Reporting, BI, and Analytics Software Solutions\n\nOut-of-the-Box Reports in Lawson S3 and M3 are Not Meeting Your Reporting Needs\n\nManual Data Exporting is Time Consuming\n\nWith no automated way to get reports in Excel from your Lawson system, you’re left with data dumps and manually piecing together information for your reports. Depending on the complexity of the report you need, several exports may be necessary just to stitch together a report to perform basic reconciliation tasks. Then, each period, you’ll need to export the same reports again. Worse still, static spreadsheets are breeding grounds for errors and inaccuracies.\n\nCustom Ad Hoc Reports are Expensive\n\nWhen canned reports don’t cut it, most customers find themselves spending money to build their own set of operational and management reports. If you need to combine data from Lawson with other systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Patient Health Records, you’ll likely rely on expensive, outside help to create and manage your reporting.\n\nReport Distribution is Frustratingly Manual and Time Consuming\n\nDistributing report packs at month-end is a requirement, but you feel like it shouldn’t take as long as it does. Once business users receive their reports, you’re inundated with ad hoc inquiries from functional leaders and others. Responding to these inquiries can often mean long days and late nights, taking time away from activities like value-added analysis.\n\nEasily Build Custom Reports and Dashboards Without the Usual IT Bottleneck\n\nRefreshable, Drillable Data in Excel\n\nWith Spreadsheet Server there’s no need to worry about inaccurate or stale data in Excel. Reports in Spreadsheet Server are “once built, always built.” Simply refresh or update to a new period to pull in your new Lawson data. Empower your users to create their own reports and have more time for value-added analysis. Excel users can apply their existing knowledge to easily create, edit, and share any report throughout your organization.\n\nSave Time and Money by Reducing Reliance on Consultants and IT\n\nOutsourcing your reporting can be slower and more expensive than ideal, even with an excellent vendor. With Spreadsheet Server you save time and money by getting reports right the first time, without any back and forth with a consultant. Empower your team to become more hands-on than ever before with the ability to access data from multiple sources, so you can create single reports that contain EHR and financial or operational data from Lawson.\n\nEasily Distribute Financial Data to Your Non-Finance Audience\n\nCreate refreshable, drillable dashboards that your business users can use to help answer the questions they’d typically have at month-end, therefore saving you time. Empowering these users with self-service dashboards not only helps you accomplish other tasks, but they’re equipped with the right answer faster as they’re able to investigate on their own, without having to wait on you.\n\nImprove Results with Fast, Flexible Planning and Forecasting\n\nReplace manual planning processes with a more centralized, web-based, and efficient system. Use your existing Excel skills to customize budgets and plans directly in your browser. Integrate operational and financial planning while enabling frontline workers to collaborate and contribute to planning models for greater accuracy.\n\nReady to go beyond Financial Planning?\n\nSpreadsheet Server is one of insightsoftware's unified, modular applications. By bringing together all your insightsoftware applications in one place you can address multiple business needs faster with less risk, by picking and choosing the capabilities you need across reporting.\n\nView Recommended Products\n\nSpreadsheet Server\n\nSpreadsheet Server is easy to install and delivers fast time to value. It automates custom reports with drill-down to transactional data.\n\nHow to Compare Reporting and BI Solutions\n\nReporting and Business Intelligence (BI) solutions begin and end with data—not just how the data are collected, but also how they are stored, organized, and accessed. With a saturated market full of solutions to choose from, you need to have a clear understanding of your data needs before you start comparing your options.\n\nIn this white paper, you will learn:\n\nWhat to look for in reporting and/or BI software.\n\nWhy a reporting and BI solution is essential for growth\n\nHow to avoid reporting and BI solution implementation failure\n\nTo assist with your software selection process and help you find a solution that fits your current ERP system and IT infrastructure, we have also created a framework for evaluating third party solutions.\n\nYou need to have a clear understanding of your data needs before you start comparing your options.\n\nWork with the #1 Reporting and Analytics Vendor for Lawson\n\n“Prior to Spreadsheet Server, it took us an hour per report... now it takes us about 5 minutes per school!”\n\nLaura McDowell Accounting Systems Analyst at National Heritage Academies View Customer Story\n\nSpeak to an Expert\n\nWhat to expect\n\n20-minute discovery call with a product expert\n\nDiscover which solutions are best suited for your needs\n\nLive demo tailored to your business requirements\n\nNo high pressure sales pitch\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nHidden\n\nInterested in Financial Reporting\n\nInterested in Business Analytics and Dashboards\n\nInterested in Data Warehousing/BI Cubes\n\nInterested in Multiple Companies/Databases Consolidation\n\nInterested in Report Sharing and/or Scheduling\n\nInterested in Power BI\n\nHiddenHow Can We Help?*\n\nBusiness Email*\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nPhone Number*\n\nCompany Name*\n\nWhat Best Describes You?\n\nProspective Customer\n\nCurrent Customer\n\nPartner\n\nHiddenDo you resell software?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nJob Title\n\nHiddenIndustry\n\nPrimary Financial System\n\nFinancial System Version\n\nHiddenArea of Interest\n\nHiddenCurrent ERP Implementation Partner\n\nProduct of Interest\n\nBI Tool\n\nHiddenSeniority\n\nHiddenRole\n\nHiddenSub Role\n\nCountry\n\nState/Province\n\nHiddenComments\n\nI agree to receive digital communications from insightsoftware and its partners (click here for full list of partners) containing news, product information, promotions, or event invitations.
