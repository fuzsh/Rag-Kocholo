        "text": "4GL / RPG\n\nIn the diagram, \"4GL / RPG\"\" stands for a typical Lawson business application written in either the 4GL programming language (Unix and Windows) or the RPG language (IBM I).\n\nOn IBM I, Lawson applications are typically written in 4GL and then translated to RPG.\n\nAuthentication This document refers to two methods of authentication that are supported with Infor Lawson 10: Lawson Security as Security Token Service (LS as STS) and the Kerberos protocol. Browser (Lawson Portal execution) A web browser is the only desktop product required for typical end-users to run Lawson Portal. Client This document refers to any subsystem that connects via HTTP to the Lawson server as a client. Data Data is a Lawson service that facilitates read-only client requests for application data contained within Lawson. DA In the diagram, \"DA\" stands for Data Access servlet, the main web communication component between Process Server and other Infor Lawson System Foundation components. Drill Drill is a Lawson service that facilitates read-only client Drill Around requests. DSP (Distributed Security Package) DSP is the package that allows for communication between Infor Lawson System Foundation and the Sharepoint server which handles Kerberos authentication. Environment See \"Infor Lawson Core Technology\" in this table. HTTP Server Lawson Portal is installed on a server that communicates via HTTP. (This type of server is sometimes called a web server.) IOS (Internet Object Services) A subsystem of the Infor Lawson Core Technology that provides services to all of Lawson, in particular, web-based systems, such as Lawson Portal. It is deployed in the servlet container. IOS servlets The individual programs that perform the tasks that make up IOS as a whole. Kerberos protocol The protocol used to authenticate users on the Sharepoint server. LACOBRTS (Lawson Cobol Runtime System)\n\nLACOBRTS is a group of libraries and other files that have been tightly integrated with the Cobol vendor's runtime system to provide services that Lawson applications need at runtime.\n\nOn IBM I, LARPGRTS (see below) replaces LACOBRTS. An exception is for Java routines, which run through LACOBRTS on IBM I as well as on Unix and Windows platforms.\n\nLADB LADB is the interface between the customer RDBMS system and Lawson database drivers. Lawson provides a driver for each supported RDBMS. LADB routes requests for data to the appropriate driver. LA-RTS This document uses the term \"LA-RTS\" to refer to the Cobol and RPG (IBM I) runtimes collectively when it is appropriate to do so. LARPGRTS (Lawson RPG Runtime System) LARPGRTS provides services that Lawson System I applications need at runtime. LASE (Lawson Security Server) The Lawson Security Server is the main processing engine for authorization requests to Lawson Security. LATM (Lawson Application Server) The Lawson Application Server provides services to ensure that Lawson transactions move through the system with the best performance and least expenditure of system resources possible. Infor Lawson Core Technology\n\nInfor Lawson Core Technology is container name for the many services and utilities that run the Lawson system.\n\nThis document uses the term \"Lawson Environment\" (and sometimes \"Environment\"), to refer to a single instance of Infor Lawson Core Technology.\n\nLawson server In this document, the Lawson server is the server where the majority of Infor Lawson System Foundation components are installed. LDAP (Lightweight Data Access Protocol) Server and LDAP Lawson stores globally interesting user data in a third-party, industry-standard LDAP directory. ISS (Infor Security Services) Administrator The desktop tool for performing most tasks related to configuring users and federating systems (for example, for federating Infor Lawson System Foundation and Infor Landmark Technology). LS (Lawson Security) Administrator The desktop tool for performing all tasks related to writing security policies (authorization). (Most user administration tasks can also be performed using this tool.) Landmark runtime This term refers to the foundation technology that supports Landmark applications, including Infor Process Automation. Infor Process Automation\n\nUmbrella term for Lawson's Business Process Modeling (BPM) product. It includes Lawson Process Server and Lawson Process Designer.\n\nThe term also refers to server side components of the Infor Process Automation product. These components include configuration, administration and troubleshooting tools. They are delivered with Infor Landmark Technology and accessed using Infor Landmark Technology, Infor Rich Client, Infor Smart Office or the web UI.\n\nInfor Process Designer\n\nDesktop tool for creating the actual processes. All process developers must have this tool.\n\n(Access to the tool is not needed for users who need to take actions on processes that are in production.)\n\nInfor Lawson server components Software components installed on the Infor Lawson server that forward application requests to Infor Process Automation. Infor Smart Office This term refers to a Windows-based user interface that can be used instead of or in addition to Lawson Portal. Router The Router servlet manages the work of the main IOS services: Data, Drill, and Transaction. Single Sign-on (SSO) servlet This servlet verifies that a user session is valid. Sharepoint server If the installation uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication, the Sharepoing server is where users are authenticated."
