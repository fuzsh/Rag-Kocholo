Payne of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a permanent injunction order requiring Lawson Software, Inc. (Nasdaq:LWSN) and its successors to immediately stop selling and servicing products relating to electronic procurement systems that infringe ePlus patents. Lawson filed a motion with the District Court to stay the injunction pending appeal, and the motion was denied. Lawson has also filed a motion for an emergency stay with the appellate court, which has not yet ruled.\n\nJudge Payne's injunction order applies to configurations of several Lawson products, including Lawson Procurement, Requisitions Self Service, Procurement Punchout, EDI, Lawson System Foundation, and Process Flow. These products are components of the Lawson S3 Supply Chain Management suite. The injunction order also extends to Lawson's M3 e-Procurement software.\n\nThe injunction order was entered in response to ePlus' request to permanently shut down all of Lawson's infringing activity. As ePlus requested, Judge Payne's order shuts down not only Lawson's sales of its infringing software products, but also prevents Lawson from any ongoing or future maintenance, training or installation of its infringing software products.\n\nThe injunction order also prohibits Lawson from publishing any literature or information that encourages the use or sale of its infringing products and requires Lawson to notify all of its customers who have purchased its infringing products of the terms of the injunction order.\n\nThe injunction order is effective immediately for most customers of Lawson's infringing software products. Judge Payne's order provides a limited sunset period which permits Lawson to continue maintaining and servicing the infringing software products until November 23, 2011 to those customers who purchased the infringing products prior to January 27, 2011 and who are only providers of healthcare services.\n\nThe injunction order will remain in effect until the expiration of the ePlus patents, the latest of which is to expire on February 8, 2017.\n\nThe ePlus patents involve electronic procurement, and the inventions allow end-users to perform a wide variety of functions, including, but not limited to:\n\nperform electronic searches, selections and comparisons as well as review items in multiple supplier catalogs;\n\nfind equivalent items and suitable replacements;\n\ngenerate purchase orders from multiple vendors; and\n\nelectronically check inventory\n\n\"We are gratified that the Court has granted our request to shut down Lawson's infringing activity and operations,\" said Ken Farber, president of ePlus' software subsidiaries. \"Judge Payne's ruling will prevent Lawson from any further violation of the rights we have to protect our patented inventions.\"\n\nAbout ePlus inc.\n\nePlus is a leading provider of technology solutions. ePlus enables organizations to optimize their IT infrastructure and supply chain processes by delivering world-class IT products from top manufacturers, professional services, flexible lease financing, proprietary software, and patented business methods.
