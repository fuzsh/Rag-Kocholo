        "text": "One of St. Paul's biggest employers, Lawson Software, laid off employees Wednesday, but the company won't reveal just how many or where they are located.\n\nA company spokesman confirmed in an email that layoff notices did go out at Lawson, calling it an \"expected outcome\" of being acquired earlier this year.\n\nLawson stockholders approved the sale last month to a Georgia firm and a California investment group for $2 billion. Lawson was purchased by GGC Software Holdings, a holding company that includes Golden Gate Capital of San Francisco and Infor, of Alpharetta, Ga.\n\n\"Lawson is not identifying the size of the reduction,\" said company spokesman Joe Thornton. \"But we can say that affected employees are receiving severance and outplacement services to help them in their transition.\"\n\nLawson employees 3,800 workers worldwide, including 800 in St. Paul. The company would only say the reduction will eliminate redundancies; all laid-off workers will get severance; a majority of Lawson employees will stay with company, including a majority of workers in St. Paul.\n\nLawson specializes in software that helps companies run operations like human resources and finance.\n\nThe company's high-profile relocation in 1999 included construction of a new building in downtown St. Paul."
