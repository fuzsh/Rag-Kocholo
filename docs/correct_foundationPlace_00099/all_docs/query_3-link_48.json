        "text": "SANTA CLARA — ServiceNow has struck a deal that enables the company to create a big new headquarters complex in Santa Clara that could accommodate thousands of the up-and-coming software firm’s employees, the tech company said Thursday.\n\nThe most recent ServiceNow lease was for an office building at 2251 Lawson Lane in Santa Clara between San Tomas Expressway and Central Expressway, the company confirmed.\n\nServiceNow, with the latest transaction, has lease agreements for 858,000 square feet in Santa Clara, primarily on existing or under-construction buildings on Lawson Lane. That’s enough space for potentially 4,300 to 5,700 employees of the company.\n\nAll the buildings on Lawson Lane are owned by The Sobrato Organization, one of the Bay Area’s legendary and prolific developers.\n\n“ServiceNow recently expanded its headquarters by leasing an additional building on Lawson Lane,” ServiceNow said in comments about the new transaction emailed to this news organization.\n\nThe company had previously leased 329,000 square feet in two buildings of identical size at 2215 and 2225 Lawson Lane. After that, ServiceNow agreed to lease 269,000 square feet of office space, which is now under construction across the street, also on Lawson Lane. Prior to this expansion activity, ServiceNow was already leasing 130,000 square feet on Jay Street in Santa Clara.\n\nAll told, ServiceNow has leased 858,000 square feet in Santa Clara, including the latest rental transaction.\n\nIn the most recent lease, ServiceNow rented 130,000 square feet of office space from Sobrato. Chase Lyman, an executive with Cupertino-based Sobrato, declined to comment about the situation.\n\n“This is in addition to last year’s announcement that ServiceNow had entered into a new lease agreement for new buildings that will be built nearby to help accommodate the anticipated growth of ServiceNow,” ServiceNow said in the comments, referring to the under-construction buildings and the 130,000-square-foot lease.\n\nServiceNow has moved into two of the Lawson Lane buildings it leased from Sobrato.\n\nThrough an affiliate called SI 67, The Sobrato Organization bought the 2251 Lawson Lane office building that ServiceNow leased, according to public property documents filed with Santa Clara County officials on May 30.\n\nThe Sobrato affiliate paid about $41.1 million for the building, the county records show.\n\n“Certainly, ServiceNow is doing very well,” said David Vanoncini, an executive vice president and managing director with Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate firm. “You have major companies like Google, Apple, LinkedIn, and Facebook that are expanding. But you also have smaller companies like Roku and ServiceNow that also are growing.”\n\nRoku, through a series of leasing deals, has agreed to rent 733,000 square feet at San Jose’s Coleman Highline mixed-use tech campus near the city’s airport. These transactions will allow the fast-growing maker of digital media players to exit cramped offices in Los Gatos. Roku’s expansion will also give San Jose a new tech company headquarters.\n\nSanta Clara-based ServiceNow provides software and services for information technology, human resources, customer relations and security operations.\n\nOver the 12 months that ended in March, ServiceNow lost $38.9 million on revenue of $2.81 billion, according to the Yahoo Finance site.\n\nLike Roku, ServiceNow has been able to cobble together a viable headquarters campus with plenty of elbow room.\n\n“ServiceNow is fortunate that it is in an area with some options to expand,” Vanoncini said. “By working with Sobrato, ServiceNow was able to grow without having to move. A developer like Sobrato can make things happen for a tenant.”"
