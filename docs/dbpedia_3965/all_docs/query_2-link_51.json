        "text": "Summary\n\nRoman Catholic parish church, designed in 1953-1954 by Gerard Goalen, built in 1958-1960, with stained glass designed and made by Dom Charles Norris of Buckland Abbey, assisted by Dom Paulinus Angold and Jerome Gladman.\n\nReasons for Designation\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Fatima, designed in 1953-1954 by Gerard Goalen and built in 1958-1960, with stained glass designed and made by Dom Charles Norris of Buckland Abbey, assisted by Dom Paulinus Angold and Jerome Gladman, is listed at Grade II* for the following principal reasons:\n\n* as the first Liturgically inspired church to have been planned in England prior to its formalisation by the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), with its T-shaped plan, sanctuary at the central crossing and freestanding altar being advanced for its time; * as a striking piece of modernist architecture which significantly demonstrates the results of sweeping liturgical change in post-War England, it being a considered engagement with liturgical movement theology on part of both the parish priest and a modern architect; * for the extensive scheme of brightly-coloured dalle de verre glass designed by Dom Charles Norris of Buckfast Abbey, his first venture with the technique in the United Kingdom, and possibly the first major English example of its use, representing artistic embellishment of a significantly high quality; * the liturgical furnishings not only incorporate liturgical movement ideas but also represent a very complete and coherent set of modern works of art as inspired by the French Ateliers d'Art Sacré (Studios of Sacred Art) movement; * for its design by Gerard Goalen, one of the most important architects of the Roman Catholic Liturgical Movement in the United Kingdom.\n\nHistoric interest:\n\n* for the way it embraced the egalitarian ideals and spirit of new town planning, providing the Catholic community in Harlow with a space that connected their modern social and physical environment with their religious lives.\n\nHistory\n\nHarlow was designated a new town in 1947 to ease over-crowding in north-east London. Its master plan was drafted by Sir Frederick Gibberd (1908-1990), who was nominally the chief architect as well as the master planner, and was approved by Government in 1949. From 1951 Roman Catholics in the new town held mass at the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, Old Harlow. In the following year, as the town’s population increased, four Roman Catholic parishes were established. The first was at Mark Hall North, the first neighbourhood to be completed, and was entrusted to a religious order, the Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception, with land being granted by the Development Corporation close to the site of the town's first shopping centre, The Stow. Fr Francis E Burgess was appointed parish priest in 1953, and a church hall (from where mass was held from 1955) and a primary school were quickly built, respectively to the designs of Sperry and Starczewski, and of E A Boxall.\n\nIn 1953, on Gibberd’s recommendation, the design for parish's new church was entrusted to Gerard Goalen (1918-1999), an architect with a strong passion for church building, but who was then working with Gibberd at the Development Corporation designing factories for the town’s industrial estates. Goalen had studied at the Liverpool School of Architecture where he had briefly worked for Francis Xavier Velarde (1897-1960), a major Roman Catholic church architect of the Inter-War and Post-War periods. His thesis had been for a modern pilgrimage church, inspired by Auguste Perret’s Notre-Dame du Raincy, near Paris (1922-1923), and he found in Fr Burgess a priest who also shared his passion for liturgical reform and modern church architecture.\n\nFr Burgess’s brief was for a church capable of holding 500 parishioners, in which the altar should be freestanding, in the midst of and clearly visible to the congregation. Seating was also requested for a further 500 parishioners on paved spaces outside the three narthexes, from where the high altar could be viewed through open doors. Goalen’s design was informed by his research and travels in Germany, Switzerland and France in 1958, where he visited notable examples of advanced liturgical design. Along with Notre-Dame du Raincy, he took inspiration from Karl Moser’s St Antonius, Basel (1921) and Albrecht Dietz’s and Bernhard Grothe’s St Mauritius in Alt-Saarbrücken (1953-1956), both noted for their exposed concrete frames and large areas of coloured glass, while the churches of the German architect Rudolf Schwarz were also a significant influence, with their emphasis of placing the altar amidst the congregation. At Harlow, Goalen adopted a T-shaped plan, with the altar placed at the crossing and seating arranged around this on three sides in the nave and transepts. This was a radical brief for 1953, and if funds had been available to start building when the plans were approved, in January 1954, this would have been the first post-war church in England built under the auspices of the Liturgical Movement.\n\nThe church's foundation stone was laid on 6 December 1958 by the Right Reverend Bernard Patrick Wall (1894-1976), Bishop of Brentwood from 1955 to 1969. At this time, however, the choice of maker for the glass that was to cover around sixty per-cent of the wall surfaces had still not been made. This was finally agreed upon in early 1959 following Fr Burgess’s visit to the studio of the Benedictine monk and artist Dom Charles Norris (1909-2004) at Buckfast Abbey, where he was developing the modern French technique known as dalle de verre, using one-inch thick slab glass set in concrete. The technique had been pioneered by Pierre Fourmaintraux (1896-1974) who is credited with training Norris in the technique following his appointment in 1956 as chief glass designer for James Powell and Sons (later Whitefriars Glass Studio). Norris subsequently went on to become one of the most prolific British proponents of dalle de verre, with Our Lady of Fatima being his first venture with the technique, and possibly the first major example of its use in England. The church was opened and blessed by the Bishop of Brentwood on 26 March 1960. It was reported in the Catholic Building Review (1960) to have cost £48,500, with Fr Burgess receiving considerable financial help from his parents.\n\nBy the time work had commenced on Our Lady of Fatima, Goalen had joined Frederick Gibberd’s practice, and in 1959 submitted an entry to the competition for a new design for Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. However, much to Goalen’s chagrin, the competition was won by Gibberd despite his lack of church building experience or strong religious convictions, with his last-minute entry said to have been influenced by his attendance at Our Lady of Fatima's opening Mass. Goalen subsequently established his own practice, designing such churches as St Gregory the Great, South Ruislip (1965-1967), Thomas More, Swiss Cottage (1968), both listed at Grade II, and the Catholic Chaplaincy in Cambridge (1977).\n\nIn 2001, Our Lady of Fatima was closed due to problems with the stained-glass walls. Following the raising of £400,000 by parishioners along with a grant of £135,000 from English Heritage (now Historic England) and the Heritage Lottery Fund (now the National Lottery Heritage Fund), repairs commenced in 2003 and the church reopened in 2005. It closed again in 2017 to allow the cross and orb to be removed from the spire for safety reasons.\n\nDetails"
