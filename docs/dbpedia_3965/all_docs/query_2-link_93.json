Middle Park: the exterior\n\n[photograph by John Maidment (21 November 2010)]\n\nHistorical and Technical Documentation by John Maidment\n\nÂ© OHTA, 2012 (last updated December 2012)\n\nThe parish has been in the care of the Carmelite order of priests and brothers since April 1882 when the first Carmelite priests, Prior Butler and Father Shaffrey, arrived to take charge of the newly created parish of Sandridge (Port Melbourne). Their new parish, formerly part of Emerald Hill (South Melbourne), extended along the beachfront from the river at Port Melbourne to Fitzroy Street, St Kilda. The Carmelites celebrated their first Mass on 7 May 1882 in St Joseph's, Port Melbourne, which had opened in 1881.1\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel Church. Middle Park: the exterior of the first church\n\n[photograph from Some of the Fruits of Fifty Years: Ecclesiastical Annals (Melbourne: Massina, 1897)]\n\nThe foundation stone of the first church on this site was laid on 30 November 1890. The building was described as follows:\n\nThe church will be a most commodious one affording seating accommodation for a large congregation, irrespective of the choir and organ gallery. The general design will be Gothic of the 13th century carried out in red and buff brick with cement facings. The main front to Nicholson Street shows a nave and aisles, the centre gable having a rich traceried window. The gables to the nave are lighted with double lancet windows. The principal entrance doors communicate with spacious porches one of which contains a stone stairway to the organ gallery. The sanctuary is provided with an octagonal apse with provisions on each side for separate altars. Ample light is provided by a series of gables with double lancet windows to the aisles. The building will be ceiled with kauri pine. Ample provision for sacristies for acolytes and clergy has been made, whilst the southeastern angle is filled with a neat and tasteful belfry harmonising with the whole design. The architect is Mr George Gray.2\n\nThis building was opened and blessed on 29 November 1891.3\n\nThe organ was built by Frederick Taylor and consisted of two manuals. It was opened in the previous church in February 1908.4 No contemporary description of the instrument has been located.\n\nA new church building was erected in the 1920s.\n\nAs a memorial to the late Rev. Prior Kindelan, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Middle Park is to be completed. A drawing of the design for the finished church by Mr. A.A. Fritsch is reproduced. Approximately Â£10,000 will he required for the work, and an appeal for the sum is being made.5 The foundation stone laid of the new church was laid on 10 April 1927.6\n\nMEMORIAL CHURCH.\n\nThe Carmelite Church at Middle Park has been enlarged at a cost exceeding Â£11,000 and over the massive front is a copper-covered dome surmounted by a large statue of the Virgin and child. Carmelite fathers and parishioners completed the church as a memorial to the late Rev. Prior Kindelan, who was stationed in the district for many years. Yesterday morning solemn high mass was sung in the church by Bishop Ryan who was assisted by a number of clergy. Archbishop Mannix presided at the throne. An orchestra assisted the choir.\n\nIn the afternoon a meeting was held in the church, and addresses were delivered by Archbishop Mannix, Bishop Ryan, the Rev. Prior Power, the Rev. W.L. Bridger, Councillor Esmonde and Mr M. McNamara. It was stated that the parish expenditure in two years amounted to Â£12,311 with Â£3,500 still to be paid to the contractor. After allowing for receipts from all sources the parish debt is Â£7,000 but it was further reduced by Â£1,121, the amount realised by the special collection yesterday. Archbishop Mannix and Bishop Ryan each gave Â£20 and Bishop McCarthy Â£15.\n\nThe Rev. Prior Power announced that a new organ, to cost Â£1000, would be installed before the end of the year.7\n\nThe church includes outstanding stained glass windows in the apse by F.X. Zettler.\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel Church. Middle Park: the 1929 Taylor console\n\n[photograph by W.G.S. Smith (circa 1970s)]\n\nThe organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Frederick Taylor to three manuals and was dedicated on 30 June 1929 by Archbishop Mannix.8\n\nGREAT\n\nOpen Diapason I\n\nOpen Diapason II\n\nClarabella\n\nDulciana8\n\nPrincipal\n\nHarmonic Flute\n\nTwelfth\n\nFifteenth\n\nTrumpet\n\nSwell to Great\n\nChoir to Great\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2-2/3\n\n2\n\n8\n\nSWELL\n\nBourdon\n\nGeigen Principal\n\nLieblich Gedeckt\n\nViole d'Orchestre\n\nVoix Celeste\n\nGemshorn\n\nWald Flute\n\nCornopean\n\nOboe\n\nTremulant\n\nSub Octave\n\nOctave\n\n16\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n8\n\n1-12 unenclosed\n\ngvd.bass\n\nTC\n\nCHOIR (enclosed)\n\nViola\n\nHohl Flute\n\nSalicional\n\nVox Angelica\n\nLieblich Flute\n\nVox Humana\n\nTremulant\n\nSwell to Choir\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n8\n\nTC\n\nPEDAL\n\nOpen Diapason\n\nBourdon\n\nPrincipal\n\nGreat to Pedal\n\nSwell to Pedal\n\nChoir to Pedal\n\n16\n\n16\n\n8\n\nmetal\n\nCompass: 58/30\n\nTubular-pneumatic action\n\n3 thumb pistons to Great duplicated by toe pistons\n\n3 thumb pistons to Swell duplicated by toe pistons\n\nGreat to Pedal reversible toe piston\n\nBalanced pedals to Swell and Choir9\n\nThe distinguished French organist Marcel DuprÃ©, in Australia for the ABC, played the organ for vespers during his visit to Melbourne in July-August 1939. This performance was still proudly recounted almost 30 years later.\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel Church. Middle Park: the organ from the Laurie nave console\n\n[photograph by John Maidment (21 November 2010)]\n\nThe organ was rebuilt in 1986-87 by S.J. Laurie Pty Ltd. The key and stop actions were converted to electro-pneumatic and a second three-manual drawstop console provided, this being placed in one of the transepts. A number of tonal additions were made, including new Mixtures for the Swell and Great, provision of a new extended Swell reed rank, upperwork for the Choir, and a Pedal reed.10\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel Church. Middle Park: the 2011 console\n\n[photograph by John Maidment (2 December 2012)]\n\nThe organ was enlarged in 2011-2012 by Pipe Organs WA, from Perth. The work has consisted of the provision of a new four-manual terraced console, located in the right transept, addition of a Positiv division, sited on the gallery rail, addition of a horizontal Trumpet (envisaged in the Laurie rebuild), the moving forward and laterally of the divided cases in the rear gallery and their outwards extension by an additional flat, with newly constructed side panels, all in the architectural style of the original. A new Trumpet 8 was placed on the Great in place of the original, which is in storage in the blower room, and the composition of the Laurie Great Mixture was revised, with a fourth lower rank.\n\nGREAT\n\nOpen Diapason no 1\n\nOpen Diapason no 2\n\nClarabel\n\nDulciana\n\nPrincipal\n\nHarmonic Flute\n\nTwelfth\n\nFifteenth\n\nFourniture 15.19.22.26\n\nTrumpet\n\nSwell to Great\n\nPositiv to Great\n\nChoir to Great\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2-2/3\n\n2\n\nIV\n\n8\n\nrescaled 2012\n\n1987 recomposed with additional rank 2012\n\nreplaced 2012, original in storage\n\nSWELL\n\nBourdon\n\nGeigen Principal\n\nGedackt\n\nViol d'Orchestre\n\nVoix Celeste\n\nGemshorn\n\nLieblich Flute\n\nMixture 15.19.22 III\n\nDouble Trumpet\n\nCornopean\n\nOboe\n\nClarion\n\nTremulant\n\nSwell Sub\n\nSwell Unison Off\n\nSwell Octave\n\nPositiv to Swell\n\n16\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n4\n\nIII\n\n16\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\nbass unenclosed\n\nTC\n\n1987\n\nA 1987\n\nA 1987 replacing original Cornopean\n\nA 1987\n\nPOSITIV (2011)\n\nPrincipal\n\nStopped Diapason\n\nOctave\n\nPiccolo\n\nLarigot\n\nCymbal 22.26\n\nClarionet\n\nTremulant\n\nPositiv Sub\n\nPositiv Unison Off\n\nPositiv Octave\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1-1/3\n\nII\n\n8\n\ngvd.bas\n\n2012\n\nCHOIR\n\nHohl Flute\n\nViola\n\nSalicional\n\nVox Angelica\n\nWald Flute\n\nNazard\n\nFlageolet\n\nTierce\n\nVox Humana\n\nTremulant\n\n'Elijah' Trompette en Chamade\n\nChoir Sub\n\nChoir Unison Off\n\nChoir Octave\n\nSwell to Choir\n\nPositiv to Choir\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n2-2/3\n\n2\n\n1-3/5\n\n8\n\n8\n\n(enclosed except Trompette)\n\nTC\n\nTA 1987\n\n1987\n\nTA 1987\n\n2012\n\nPEDAL\n\nQuint Bass\n\nOpen Diapason\n\nBourdon\n\nPrincipal\n\nFlute\n\nOctave Flute\n\nTrombone\n\nDouble Trumpet\n\nTrumpet\n\nGreat to Pedal\n\nSwell to Pedal\n\nPositiv to Pedal\n\nChoir to Pedal\n\n32\n\n16\n\n16\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n16\n\n16\n\n8\n\nderived 1987\n\nB\n\nB\n\nB\n\n1987\n\nA\n\nA\n\nGreat and Pedal Comb Coupled\n\nCompass: 58/30\n\nElectro-pneumatic action\n\nThe Laurie drawstop console is now placed forward in the gallery, and the 1929 Taylor console, disconnected, is placed at the rear.\n\nAddition of a 16ft flue on Great and Pedal, and a 2ft stop to the Swell has been provided for at the two consoles.11\n\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel Church.
