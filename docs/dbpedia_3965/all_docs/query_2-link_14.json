        "text": "This Gothic Revival chapel, started in 1873 and completed in 1878, was built by young French architect Projectus Mouly for the Sisters of Loretto. In 1855, Jean Baptiste Lamy moved the Loretto Academy here into a former hotel he bought in 1854, La Casa Americana (the American House). That two-story, pitched roof building stood here (next to the south side of the chapel) until 1882 when a two-story convent replaced it and a three-story girlsâ€™ school was built on the north side of the chapel. The convent and school were razed in 1971 to make way for the Inn at Loretto.\n\nSite Information\n\nLocation (207 Old Santa Fe Trail, Santa Fe, New Mexico)\n\nThe chapel is famed for its 20-foot high, circular staircase, built in 1878. While the Lorretines insisted the builder was St. Joseph, recent evidence points to French master carpenter Francois-Jean Rochas.\n\nSafety Considerations\n\nEl Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail\n\nSanta Fe National Historic Trail\n\nOld Spanish National Historic Trail\n\nEl Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, Old Spanish Trail, Santa Fe Trail: Santa Fe, New Mexico Itinerary"
