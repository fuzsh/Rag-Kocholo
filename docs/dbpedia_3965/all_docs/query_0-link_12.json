        "text": "17th century ‚Äî Early Modern Period\n\nTime of Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and William Shakespeare. Europeans started colonizing the Americas. Electricity, ice cream, the telescope, and the microscope were invented. The ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of Ukrainian Cossacks and their struggle for independence. Historians consider the Cossack State to be a precursor of modern Ukraine.\n\n1. Bernardine Church and Monastery (1600‚Äì1630)\n\nThis church illustrates a switch from aristocratic and geometrical Renaissance to extravagant Baroque. Most of the building belongs to Mannerism ‚Äî the culmination of the Renaissance style right before the Baroque boom.\n\nBernardine monks came to Lviv in the 15th century, but Moldovans plundered their initial monastery in this place. The current complex stood behind the city walls and, surrounded by its own fortification, created a powerful defensive point on the southeast.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the church was closed by the Soviets and fell into disrepair until Ukraine‚Äôs independence.\n\n2. Church of Poor Clares (est. 1607)\n\nBernardine nuns (a.k.a. Poor Clares) arrived in Lviv in the 15th century and settled behind the city walls. Their initial church was small and suffered from wars throughout the 17th century. The reconstruction of the 1740s extended the building and transformed it into a Baroque.\n\nThe church was used as a tobacco warehouse, hospital, and customs under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Such misuse damaged the frescoes but preserved the building layout; only the Neo-Baroque tower was added in the course of the 1939 restoration.\n\nNowadays, the church is part of the Lviv Art Gallery and exhibits wooden sculptures by Johann Georg Pinsel, a prominent Galician sculptor.\n\n3. Church and Monastery of St. Mary Magdalene (est. 1609)\n\nDominican monks built their church and monastery simultaneously with the Bernardines. Despite the initial prevalence of Renaissance features, this church was rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1758, after Swedish invaders had looted and damaged it.\n\nIn the following centuries, the church underwent several minor changes, such as the balcony and Neo-Baroque tower helmets.\n\nBefore the Second World War, the church was equipped with an organ by the famous Rieger workshop. The Soviets plundered the temple after the war but didn‚Äôt touch the organ. Since 1969, the building has been housing the organ concert hall of the Lviv Philharmonic.\n\n4. Carmelite Church and Monastery (est. 1634)\n\nThe Barefoot Carmelite monks came to Lviv in the 17th century and acquired the plot on a hill at the eastern defensive wall. Despite being well-fortified, the church was damaged first by the Cossacks and then by the Swedes. The facade underwent a redesign in the 19th century but still retains much of its original design. Also, the church is adorned with 300-year-old frescoes and a black marble altar.\n\nAfter the Second World War, hobos occupied the abandoned monastery, and the garden became a hippies‚Äô place, ‚ÄúThe Holy Garden Republic.‚Äù\n\n5. Royal Arsenal (1639‚Äì1646)\n\nRoyal Arsenal replaced the so-called Small Arsenal and included a foundry and military workshops. King Wladyslaw IV Vasa covered two-thirds of the construction cost, hence the building name.\n\nThe rectangular layout made the arsenal a dreadful trap for soldiers who would break into its courtyard.\n\nThe arsenal was serving its original purpose till 1769. It was converted into the state archive in 1927 and plays this role nowadays.\n\n6. Church of Our Lady of Loreto (1644‚Äì1692)\n\nThe construction of this church was delayed because of the Swedish and Russian invasions in the mid-17th century.\n\nMany details of the church‚Äôs design were patterned after the Santa Susanna Church in Rome. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire took Lviv and Carmelites left the city in 1792, the building was turned into a warehouse. In Soviet times, it accommodated a metrology office.\n\n7. St. Casimir Church (1656‚Äì1664)\n\nThe initial wooden church was burnt when the Cossack troops took Lviv High Castle by storm in 1648. The new stone temple was built for the Catholic Reformists, a branch of the Bernardines. Despite the church‚Äôs minimalism, its fronton has a distinct Baroque shape.\n\nIn 1783 the Austrian authorities turned it into a hospital, and now the building belongs to Lviv State University of Internal Affairs.\n\n8. St. Lawrence Church ‚Äî Bonifratrzy Hospital (est. 1659)\n\nInitially, a local farmer hung the St. Lawrence icon on an oak. Soon, the icon was replaced with a wooden chapel, and the chapel, in its turn, with a stone church. Then King Jan III Sobieski granted the building to the Bonifratrzy Order, and they added a hospital and monastery.\n\nThe Austrian authorities abolished the monastery in 1783. Nowadays, the building is a facility of the Military Clinical Center.\n\n9. Church of St. Peter and St. Paul (est. 1668)\n\nThis church was built on Glyniany Tract, a medieval road that turned into modern Lychakivska Street. The temple was first mentioned in 1648; there is evidence that a stone chapel had stood here earlier.\n\nThe church was rebuilt in 1660 and had a bell tower, but a redesign in the following century shaped its present-day appearance. One can still recognize the original defensive character; for example, windows are located 6 meters above the floor level.\n\n10. St. Anne Church (est. 1673)\n\nThe first chapel in this place was built in 1507, but the temple encountered total destruction thrice in a row. Only around 1670, the Augustinian brothers took over the church, rebuilt it, and added a monastery. In the 19th century, St. Anne Church got a new tower with a clock.\n\nThere was a competition for a new church design in 1911, but the First World War interrupted it. So, instead of cardinal changes, only the Neo-Baroque tower top was added. After the Second World War, the Soviets plundered the church and turned it into a ticket office and furniture store.\n\n18th century ‚Äî Age of Enlightenment\n\nA wave of revolutions challenged monarchical rule and the slave trade. George Washington became the first president of the United States of America. Mozart and Beethoven composed their masterpieces; Voltaire proclaimed Enlightenment ideas; Adam Smith established modern economics. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which contained ethnic Ukrainian lands, broke up. Ukraine was divided between the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire, which repressed national expression and crushed the Cossack state.\n\n11. St. Anthony Church (1718‚Äì1739)\n\nThe first wooden church and monastery appeared on this site in 1630, but they burnt to ashes during the Lviv Siege and were later rebuilt.\n\nUnlike the majority of religious buildings, St. Anthony Church stayed open during the Soviet period. After Ukraine had become independent, Franciscans turned back to the temple.\n\n12. Bell Tower of the Holy Spirit Church (1722‚Äì1729)\n\nThe Dominican nunnery and church were founded here in 1729; they were finished and adorned with a Baroque tower in a couple of decades.\n\nWhen Lviv came under Austrian rule, the building turned into a Greek Catholic seminary; many influential Ruthenian (Ukrainian) writers and public figures studied here.\n\nIn the Second World War, a German pilot aimed at the post office, but his aerial bomb hit the church instead; only the tower remained intact.\n\n13. St. Martin Church (1736)\n\nCarmelites‚Äô wooden church had been standing here since 1630, but it burnt to ashes during the Lviv Siege. In 1736, a new stone temple was built, with a hospital for war veterans.\n\nThe Soviet regime turned the church into a warehouse, and it was restored only recently.\n\n14. Trinitarian Church (1739‚Äì1745)\n\nThe Trinitarian monks came to Lviv from Spain in 1685. They set up a temporary monastery in the city but soon received money and a plot in the suburb for a permanent building: first wooden, then stone.\n\nAfter the Trinitarian Order had been abolished, Jesuits took over the church, and today it belongs to the Orthodox.\n\nThe church‚Äôs lavish Rococo interior is adorned with a 420-year-old altarpiece moved here from the Latin Cathedral ‚Äî Lviv‚Äôs oldest temple.\n\n15. Kilianista House (1743‚Äì1744)\n\nThis building is named after one of the first owners, apothecary Kilianista. Although the house was first mentioned in the 1630s, its Baroque design developed in the 18th century. The ground floor has been used as a coffee shop since ancient times.\n\n16. St. George Cathedral (1744‚Äì1762)\n\nA church and fortress had been occupying St. George Hill since the 13th century but were destroyed by the Polish King.\n\nThe present-day cathedral was ordered by Athanasius Sheptytsky, a religious leader and bishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. He wanted the cathedral to become the mother church of Ukrainian Eastern-rite Catholics.\n\nSt. George Cathedral is a Baroque-Rococo masterpiece by an architect of German origin, Bernard Meretyn, and sculptor Johann Georg Pinsel, whose expressive figures of St. George the Dragon-Slayer, Pope St. Leo, and St. Athanasius adorn the main facade.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Soviet authorities began persecuting Greek Catholics and nullified the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. It reemerged only in the 1990s and reclaimed the cathedral.\n\n17. Church and Monastery of Sacramentines (1744‚Äì1780s)\n\nThe Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament came to Lviv in 1710; they rented an apartment near St. Anthony Church and taught noble young ladies there. In 1718 they got their own church made of wood and brick and later could afford a stone building.\n\nAlthough the building retains many Baroque features, its main facade was redesigned at the beginning of the 20th century in the modernist style.\n\nThe Soviets handed the complex over to the veterinary institute and repurposed it as a dormitory, gym, and club; the restoration started in the 1990s owing to the institute‚Äôs staff and philanthropists.\n\n18. Dominican Church (1749‚Äì1764)\n\nThe Dominican Order arrived in Lviv in the 13th century, during the reign of the city‚Äôs founder, King Leo. Dominicans constructed a wooden church within the defensive walls, but it burnt down in the war. The new Gothic church built in the 14th century didn‚Äôt survive either. When its ceiling started cracking, it was replaced with the present-day Baroque temple.\n\nDominicans were lucky enough to survive the Austrian Empire times when many monasteries were closed.\n\nIn 1865, a Neo-Baroque bell tower was added, and on the edge of the 19th and 20th centuries, the church encountered controversial renovations. After the Second World War, the Soviets turned it into a museum of atheism.\n\n19. Piarist Collegium (1762‚Äì1766)\n\nThe 18th century was called the Age of Enlightenment because hundreds of universities and academies were established in Europe. The Piarists, a Catholic order dedicated to educating youth, came to Lviv in 1718. At that time, the city‚Äôs main collegium belonged to the Jesuit Order, which hindered the Piarists from establishing theirs.\n\nIn several decades, the Piarists managed to get royal approval for their collegium, but it hadn‚Äôt functioned for a long time. Under Austrian rule, the building was repurposed as a tobacco factory and then turned into a hospital. Now it accommodates Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital.\n\nThe main collegium‚Äôs facade was inspired by the Lateran Basilica, the mother church of Roman Catholics. It‚Äôs a mix of Baroque and Classicism, the architectural style following Baroque.\n\n20. Abrek House (1764)\n\nThe first mentions of a house on this site date back to the 14th century. It belonged to a noble family of German origin, the Abreks.\n\nBy 1764, the house had become dilapidated and was rebuilt in the Baroque style by clockmaker Kaminski. Abrek House is colloquially known as ‚Äúthe house with the all-seeing eye.‚Äù\n\n21. Lubomirski Palace (1763)\n\nThe palace was built for Polish Prince Stanislaw Lubomirski as his Lviv residence. When the Austrian Empire took control of Western Ukraine, the building was taken over by the Austrian governors of Galicia.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Ukrainian cultural-educational society ‚ÄúProsvita‚Äù bought Lubomirski Palace for its headquarters. Besides, the independence of Ukraine was proclaimed in this palace several days after Nazi Germany had invaded the Soviet Union.\n\n25. Ubaldini House (1770‚Äì1772)\n\nThe first house on this site was built in the 15th century. It initially belonged to city councilor Wilczek and later to Italian merchant Ubaldini, who participated in the Pazzi conspiracy against the Duke of Florence and had to flee to Lviv.\n\nThe present-day building was erected on top of the old foundation. The Baroque facade is embellished with the statues of Glory on the top and sea dragons and Atlanteans beneath the balcony.\n\n23. Bielski House (1776‚Äì1779)\n\nThis elegant house was built for a local administrative officer named Kaiser in the 16th century. Two centuries later, the new owner, lady Bielski, ordered to rebuild it in the Rococo style ‚Äî the most elaborate and theatrical form of Baroque.\n\n22. House in Krakivska Street (end of the 18th century)\n\nThis house was built in the second half of the 18th century and was reconstructed twice in the same and next centuries. It combines the Baroque basis with a later layer of Historicism.\n\n24. Muratovich House (1781‚Äì1783)\n\nThis house was built in the 1780s to replace two dilapidated buildings. It combines Rococo and Classicism features and bears the name of the first Armenian book printer in Lviv.\n\nArcheological excavations in the courtyard revealed traces of ancient wooden fortifications, meaning there was a settlement here before Lviv."
