        "text": "The arrangement of the images of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Clement, patron of this church, standing near the enthroned Christ on the main arch is called “prayer of intercession” in Byzantine art. The lower sections on either side depict palm trees and cities, echoing the mosaics in the main arch of San Clemente in Rome.\n\nCHRIST THE KING\n\nAt the center of the main arch, Christ is depicted as a Byzantine Emporer. Seated upon a throne and garbed in royal robes, Christ holds the scepter and terrestrial sphere in his hands. His halo bears a cross with the Byzantine abbreviation in Greek letters for “he who is,” the name revealed by God to Moses (Exodus 3:14).\n\nBeneath is a verse adapted from Psalm 29: “Bless all people O God with peace.” This text from the liturgy of the Baptism of the Lord adorns the arch above the baptistery.\n\nMARY, MOTHER OF GOD\n\nMary stands in a posture of prayer, with her hands raised. Above her is the title Beatissima Virgo Maria Mater Dei: Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God. Mary is clothed in the traditional blue robe. The stars on her head and shoulders are symbols of her virginity.\n\nSAINT CLEMENT OF ROME\n\nClement stands offering to Christ a model of this church and his prayers for this community. Clement is an important witness to life in the early church; some believe that he is the Clement mentioned by Paul in his Letter to the Philippians (4:3).\n\nClement is pictured holding a book inscribed “Ad Corinthios” (To the Corinthians). As bishop of Rome, Clement wrote a pastoral letter between 95 and 98 to the Christian community in Corinth, Greece, in which he reproves some members for rebellious conduct and urges order and submission to authority. This letter was highly regarded by ancient Christian writers and some considered it worthy of inclusion in the New Testament.\n\nAn anachronism in the painting is the triple papal crown, or tiara, lying at Christ's feet. Such a crown was not worn by popes until 1315 and was eliminated after the Second Vatican Council.\n\nCITIES AND PALM TREES\n\nOn the lower sections of the arch, cityscapes may represent Bethlehem and Jerusalem.\n\nBethlehem is the city of Christ’s birth and symbol of the Jewish heritage of Jesus and all Christians. Jerusalem is the city of the death and resurrection of Christ and the place of the descent of the Holy Spirit and the beginnings of the church. The earthly Jerusalem became identified with the heavenly Jerusalem that comes down from heaven (Revelation 21:2). Followers of Christ are already citizens of the heavenly city.\n\nTWO MIRACLES OF SAINT CLEMENT\n\nThe east and west arches illustrate two miracles described in the “Acts of Saint Clement.” The artist has created unique depictions of these events modeled after previous artistic renditions.\n\nMIRACLE IN THE QUARRIES\n\nIn the east arch, we find a story from the \"Acts.\" The emperor Trajan had banished Clement to the quarries, where he found over two thousand Christians condemned to hard labor and tormented by thirst, since the nearest drinking water was miles away. Clement prayed that he might be shown a spring nearby. When he saw a lamb on a hill he recognized it as an answer to his prayer. Clement struck the rock and water flowed, refreshing the suffering people.\n\nMIRACLE UNDER THE SEA\n\nIn the west arch, we find a different story. In about the year 101, a Roman governor condemned Clement to death. He was taken aboard the governor’s ship and thrown overboard with an anchor tied around his neck. In answer to the prayers of Clement's followers, the sea rolled back to reveal a small shrine and Clement's tomb.\n\nEvery year, according to The Golden Legend, on the anniversary of Clement's death, Christians processed to the seaside and the water would recede to allow the faithful to pray at the shrine. One year, a boy was inadvertently left behind in the shrine. No one realized he was missing until everyone else had reached the shore and the water had covered up the shrine; he was given up for lost. But when the water receded again the next year, the boy was found safe in the shrine, sleeping at the foot of the altar. He was returned to his mother and the rejoicing townspeople.\n\nIn the center of the arch the artist created a papal crest for Clement with symbols referring to his life and death: the tiara and crossed keys for his office as pope, and the anchor. An anchor was the instrument of Clement’s martyrdom, but it is also a symbol of Christian hope.\n\nTHE THRONE OF THE TRINITY\n\nOn the south arch, we find a representation of the Trinity in glory surrounded by twelve saints. The empty throne is a Byzantine symbol for the presence of the Divine, first depicted in Saint Mary Major in Rome in the fifth century. In Revelation 4 the empty throne is a symbol of the last judgment and is often found on an arch or over the door of Byzantine churches.\n\nAdoring angels on either side of the heavenly throne hold smoking thuribles. “The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel” (Revelation 8:4).\n\nUpon the throne of the Trinity are symbols representing each Person: a dove for the Holy Spirit; a book for Christ, the Word of God; and a crown covered with a veil for the Father.\n\nTwelve saints kneel in the traditional posture of those attending God in the heavenly court. Through their writings and evangelization, through the formation of religious orders and their personal prayer, these missionary saints brought the revelation of the mystery of the Trinity to the peoples of the world.\n\nPatrick: Bishop, evangelizer of Ireland\n\nAlphonsus Ligouri: Bishop, founder of the Redemptorists and doctor of the church.\n\nAnselm: Bishop of Canterbury, doctor of the church\n\nGregory VII: Pope and reformer\n\nBonaventure: Regarded as second founder of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans)\n\nThomas Aquinas: Dominican priest, doctor of the church\n\nFrancis of Assisi: Founder of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans)\n\nDominic Guzman: Founder of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans)\n\nIgnatius of Loyola: Founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits)\n\nBenedict of Nursia: Abbot, founder of western monastic life\n\nBernard of Clairvaux: Abbot, doctor of the church, founder of Cistercian Order\n\nBoniface of Mainz: Archbishop, evangelizer of Germany\n\nBARREL VAULT: BENEATH THE MANTLE OF MARY\n\nARTIST\n\nFor many years little was known about the Reverend Gleb Evgeniovitch Werchovsky who was selected by the founding pastor, Msgr. Rempe, to design and decorate the interior of Saint Clement Church. Shortly after the renovation of the church in 1988, Fr. Werchovsky's granddaughter visited our church and shared with us the life of this \"mystery man\" who was artist, priest, and father.\n\nGleb Eveniovitch Werchovsky was born on November 5, 1888, in St. Petersburg, Russia. His father was an engineer and architect as well as a wealthy landowner of noble birth. His mother, Marie Starck, was of German ancestry. As a young student at the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Gleb was drawn through his study of art to the Roman Catholic Church and at 20 he converted. He enrolled at the University of Innsbruck, Austria to study theology and completed his theological studies at a Jesuit college in Belgium. He was ordained a priest of the Ruthenian rite in 1914 in Lviv by Metropolitan Andrew Sheptycky. (Based in southwestern Ukraine, the Ruthenian Catholic Church, while closely related to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in language, customs and traditions, is subject to the Holy See.) With the outbreak of the First World War he went to Constantinople to study Byzantine art. After spending some time in Rome, he returned to St. Petersburg to serve as chaplain to the Maltese community.\n\nThe Russian revolution in 1917 brought upheaval and oppression. Fr. Werchovsky went to the Ukraine where, under the Cossack leadership, he assisted in the preservation of cultural artifacts and artwork. In Kiev on February 20, 1920, Fr. Werchovsky married Natalia Evgeniovna von Stein, a professor with a diploma in the Faculty of Philology and History. Natalia (born on August 5, 1890 in Lgoff, Kursk, Russia) had converted to Roman Catholicism while studying at the Sorbonne in Paris. On February 26, 1921, their son, Ignatius was born.\n\nAfter the Bolshevik takeover, Fr. Werchovsky aided Russian immigrants in Prague. He and his wife considered their options for the future: Paris, where many Russian artists were taking refuge, or Constantinople, with the opportunity to become more immersed in Byzantine art. The decision was made for him when Pope Pius XI, who assigned Fr. Werchovsky to St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Church in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, a French/Russian community that was in need of a liturgical artist. Fr. Gleb, Natalia and Ignatius arrived in New York on March 9, 1925, and spent four years in Rhode Island. Two daughters, Anastasia and Andronica, were added to the family.\n\nBy August 1929, Fr. Gleb and his family were in Chicago where he was assigned to St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church at Oakley and Rice. There he created various murals, some of which still remain in the sanctuary. He also decorated the church of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (which has since been sold).\n\nIn 1930 Msgr. Francis A. Rempe commissioned Fr. Werchovsky to develop a design for the interior decoration of Saint Clement Church. This appears to have been Fr. Werchovsky's main project in the Chicago area. To create the decorative program he drew upon his Russian background, his training as an artist, his knowledge of Byzantine art, and perhaps one can imagine, his personal knowledge of the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome. He created a symbolic Byzantine universe within the walls of a Romanesque building. The coordinating principle is a painting in the apse that replicates the eleventh century tree of life mosaic in San Clemente. This image recalls the fundamental mystery of our faith--our redemption in Christ which is celebrated at each liturgy. Fr. Werchovsky's creative touch is also found in this painting. The eyes of the figure of Christ are open, gazing at the viewer, whereas in San Clemente the form is of the dead Christ. Also, as a remembrance of the founding pastor, the figure of his parrot was added to a branch of the tree.\n\nOn the main arch is a painting of Christ in glory (Pantocrator) with Mary and Saint Clement in the orans (praying position) on either side. On the rear arch is an image of the adoration of the Trinity in heaven, symbolized by the throne, and adored by angels and saints. On the lateral arches are original depictions of two miracles attributed to Saint Clement. Under the four arches are portraits of saints on a rich, golden background, symbolizing their sanctity. In the dome, the canopy of heaven, are figures of angels, clouds, stars, and the traditional signs of the zodiac. On the pendentives under the dome are the four evangelists with their symbols. The placement and the style of all these figures follow the canons of Byzantine art.\n\nThe stenciled walls create the illusion of a shimmering screen of heavenly radiance, which flows into and unites the surrounding space. The thirty-one stencil patterns are variations of a cross within interlocking circles. The intricate pattern and carefully composed vibrant coloration give the space great visual energy. Trompe l'oeil stonework covers the piers in tan marble and the pillars in dramatic green and white marble. The barrel vault of the nave honors Mary with symbols from the Litany of Loreto within large interlocking circles.\n\nIn November 1930 in the Silver Jubilee Book, Msgr. Rempe described his search for an artist and the work of Fr. Werchovsky as follows:\n\nLong and earnestly had he (Msgr. Rempe) sought for a design that would embody his ideas of a dignified interior with such pictures and symbols as would lift the minds of the people to the things on high. (He had a proposal from Arthur Hercz which he rejected.) By accident, if there is such a thing, he came upon a man who gave every promise of possessing the necessary ability for this work: the Reverend Gleb Werchovsky, a Russian priest, who before taking up his studies for the ministry had graduated from the Fine Arts Academy at St. Petersburg. The sketches he submitted presented subjects that were very fascinating, though unusual. It took some time to assimilate these. But after much thought and study, and extensive comparisons with old and new creations in the decorative line, the decision was finally made, and the work begun in June 1930. It is now completed. Of the impression that it has made it is probably best to say nothing at all lest we might seem to exaggerate. Let us rather take time to unlock the treasure-house of its rare symbolism. (He goes on to describe the art and it meaning.)\n\nThe extraordinary unity of the design and integrated color palette indicate the creative talent of the artist, Fr. Werchovsky. We are blessed to be wrapped in this treasure-house of rare symbolism, which can raise our hearts and minds in praise of God.\n\nAfter suffering several strokes over two years, Fr. Werchovsky died on April 11, 1935, at Alexian Brothers Hospital at age 47. He was buried on April 13, 1935, from Nativity of the BVM Church with Bishop William D. O'Brien representing Cardinal Mundelein. Others in attendance were Most Rev. Abbott Valentine Kohlbeck, OSB of St. Procopius Abbey (Lisle), four monsignori and several priests of the Roman rite. Seven priests of the Greek rite were present. Fr. Sembratovich, pastor of a Ukrainian church in Detroit, preached the sermon. Fr. Werchovsky was buried among the priests in Resurrection Cemetery, Justice, Illinois--an artist, priest and father who died too young, but who left a living legacy in his children and in Saint Clement Church.\n\nThe organ has mechanical stop action and suspended mechanical key action, and comprises twenty stops (27 ranks/1396 pipes) over two manuals and pedal. Manual compass is 56 notes, and pedal 30 notes. The hand-made casework is solid oak; manual natural keys are made of ebony, with sharps of rosewood capped with ivory; pedal naturals are made of maple, with sharps of rosewood. The façade pipes are 70% polished tin, and the organ's wind pressure is 80mm throughout. The Casavant organ was originally tuned in an unequal temperament modified from Werkmeister III. In 2008 the temperament was changed to Kellner.\n\nThe Cassavant organ specification is as follows:\n\nGRAND-ORGUE\n\nMontre 8\n\nFlûte à cheminée 8\n\nPrestant 4\n\nFlûte conique 4\n\nDoublette 2\n\nFourniture V\n\nDouçaine 16\n\nTrompette 8\n\nPOSITIF (expressif)\n\nBourdon 8\n\nPrestant 4\n\nFlûte à fuseau 4\n\nNasard 2 2/3\n\nQuarte de nasard 2\n\nTierce 1 3/5\n\nCymbale IV\n\nHautbois 8\n\nTremblant\n\nPÉDALE\n\nSoubasse 16\n\nOctavebasse 8\n\nOctave 4\n\nBombarde 16\n\nGO/Ped\n\nPos/Ped\n\nPos/GO\n\nZimbelstern\n\nThe Taylor & Boody Organ\n\nIn 2005 Saint Clement acquired a magnificent five-stop portative organ built by Taylor & Boody Organbuilders of Staunton, Virginia. This small movable pipe organ is used primarily in the front of the church to accompany cantors, choirs and instrumentalists during the liturgy, as well serving as a complement to the larger main organ in leading hymn singing and other service music. The Taylor & Boody organ is also used as a continuo instrument in concerts with orchestra.\n\nConstructed by hand from the finest woods and metals, the instrument was built according to historic organ building principles, with a keyboard of boxwood and ebony, and a case of superbly carved white oak. The organ stands about 3-1/2 feet tall, 2 feet deep and, 3-2/3 feet wide, and weighs about 200 pounds. Manual compass is 51 notes. The\n\ncase was designed to reflect many of the symbols and architectural elements of the Saint Clement church building, and features beautiful hand carvings on three sides.\n\nThe most essential part of any organ is its sound, and this one is no exception — the sounds in the Taylor & Boody organ range from sweet and gentle to brilliant and sparkling. Each sound has been voiced with utmost care, and even with only five stops, the combinations are varied and plentiful. The instrument's pipework features tuning sleeves, permitting the organ to be tuned in a variety of temperaments. In addition to several large instruments, Taylor & Boody have built many similar continuo organs in recent years, most notably for Harvard, Yale and Rutgers Universities, and for Saint Thomas Church in New York City.\n\nThe Taylor & Boody organ specification is as follows:\n\nGedackt 8 (wood)\n\nBlockflöte 4 (wood)\n\nPrincipal 2 (metal)\n\nQuinte 1-1/3 (metal)\n\nSesquialtera II (metal, from middle c)\n\nThe keyboard is transposable to two pitch levels: A-440 and A-415. A-440 is the standard pitch at which most music today is performed. A-415 is used primarily with period instruments in early music."
