        "text": "Santa Cruz Church – Sta. Cruz, Manila\n\nThe next stop was the Sta. Cruz Church. It was just a walking distance from the Quiapo Church. The Sta. Cruz Church can be found somewhere in the Plaza Lacson. As the name of the church implies, the church’s name was based on the Holy Cross. Furthermore, the patroness saint of the church is no other than Nuestra Seniora del Pillar or the Lady of Pillars.\n\nAs I can see the Sta. Cruz Church, it was quite old but still it holds unique architectural character. Upon observing the Church, it was more simple rather than the Quiapo Church.\n\nSanta Cruz Church in Manila is surrounded by three open spaces. It was located infront of the Santa Cruz Plaza where the Carriedo Fountain was re-installed. TheGoiti Plaza or the Plaza Lacson and at the rear side is a wide street on the right leading to Santa Cruz Bridge.\n\nUpon arriving at the Sta. Cruz Church, we have overtook a wedding. That is why, we wait for a moment to get inside the church. We have observed that this church was old and yet it is still great because it was being taking cared of.\n\nAs for its altar, it may seem understated at first glance, but it is dramatic because of the lighting that was used is quite awesome, actually.\n\nWe can already notice the diminishing radius at each level.\n\nThis was just a snapshot of the vaulted roof of the Santa Cruz Church! Because we were caught by the guards in there and they told us that they were not allowing anyone to take pictures inside the church proper.\n\nBinondo Church – Binondo, Manila\n\nLocated at Quintin Paredes Street Plaza Calderon de La Barca in Binondo, its intricately designed interior reflects the Hispanic Culture that has not only influenced the Filipinos. So here we go again, to the third church that we were supposed to go on to. The Binondo Church. And guess what, there was a wedding celebration again! So, we wait for our turn to enter the church. The perks of weddings in churches is that you can pretend to be a part of the wedding photography crew and not ask for permission if you can take pictures inside. When I saw the exterior of the church, I have noticed the octagonal shaped of the windows built in there. The octagonal shaped of the windows implicate the Feng Shui in the Chinese culture. I think, this just proves that Chinese people had really influence this place in the Philippines.\n\nWhen it is now our turn to enter the church, I have noticed that in every walls, nooks and crannies are meticulously paid attention to. The ceilings are painted with the images of the fourteen Stations of the Cross and the ascension of the Blessed Virgin Mary into heaven, creating a colorful and aesthetically appealing eye-candy that will perfectly blend on on a grand celebration such as weddings.\n\nI find this Catholic Church huge plus the arts are very well crafted. It seems that everything is made perfect inside, really beautiful.\n\nFor the others who are interested in architecture just like us, they will definitely love this beautiful church.\n\nAll I can say is that, the Binondo Church is the most elegant among the three churches that we have gone through.\n\nSan Agustin Church – Intamuros, Manila\n\nAt exactly 1 o’ clock in the afternoon, we have reach the San Agustin Church located at Intramuros, Manila. And now here we go again, there was a wedding! Not one but two consecutive weddings will be held in this church! San Agustin Church was one of the oldest building standing in our country.\n\nThe symmetrical composition of the San Agustin Church is prefixed by the pairs of Tuscan columns that flank the main door of the two-tiered facade. the vertical movement of the paired columns is adapted at the second level by the equally paired coritnhian columns.\n\nThis photo shows the columns that was built on the frontage of the church. This columns were just some sort of accessorizing the structure. Because in fact, this columns does not have any purpose as we can see. And this is one example of the architectural character of the Baroque Architecture.\n\nThe moment we were allowed by the personnels to enter the said structure, we were surprised when we saw the interior of the San Agustin Church! Honestly, we were not expecting what we have seen inside! Because when we take a look at its exterior view, it was old and quite damage. But, wow. It was so nice inside!\n\nIt was such a nice experience to travel along your own country. I am thankful for this opportunity because even though our country was not that good enough just like any other, still we have something to prove on to. We must always learn how to value our own. Because loving what we have is one way to make our country a better and peaceful one. As long as we are here, architecture is alive. We must always seek that we, Filipinos can develop and have our own unique style in forming iconic architectural works.\n\nSo from looking at the baroque architecture one i say that it played a great role in the design of buildings today. Many people who obtain an over and above salary sometimes have one or two rooms that give remembrance to the baroque style. It was certainly lavish, dynamic and “over the top” decorations were definitely a bit much for today’s modern society."
