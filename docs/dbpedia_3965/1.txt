Our Lady of Lourdes Church consists of 300 families living year round amid the salt air and great skies of Cape Cod Bay. In 2007, construction of the Parish’s new Roman Catholic Church began. The structure was to be 21,000 square feet, with a sanctuary to seat 500 and a Parish Hall to accommodate social, educational and Parish events.

The church commissioned Rambusch Studios to design and fabricate a series of stained glass windows that would provide iconic images of importance to the community, and at the same time would take advantage of the color and brightness of the building’s natural coastal surroundings. Working closely with the artist, Leandro Velasco, Rambusch designed and fabricated 21 new windows, including a massive triptych of The Vision of St. Bernadette in the Grotto. The other windows portray the Four Evangelists and numerous figures important to the parish, such as Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Jude.

With its deep knowledge of art glass, the Rambusch workshop crafted specially mouth-blown pieces to fit the windows that would create an effect of movement. Today that effect can be seen inside the church as the changing light of the Cape strikes the glass. The Church was dedicated in 2009.
