A movie that is always vaguely interesting but that, here and there, finds ways to be brilliant in a wonderfully twisted way...

Bloody DisgustingMeagan Navarro

Denis tries her hand at science fiction, but done in her naturalistic, heady style that trades high tech science in favor of exploring what deep space isolation can do on one's mental state. It's an arthouse meditation on time, death, and solitude.

High Life will send you back out into the world with a totally new idea of what black holes symbolize. It is an elliptical film, yes, because it will answer only the questions that you did not think to ask.

Denis strings together a series of alternately gorgeous and horrifying images that simultaneously communicate the smallness of our lives and the vastness of the universe.

You may not love the ride, but you should at least take it and see.

Minneapolis Star TribuneChris Hewitt

Many head-scratching things occur, but Denis' calm approach indicates that what interests her is not outer space but how living in it might affect behavior.

New YorkerAnthony Lane

Denis delves into the group psychology of a beleaguered crew, housed in an interplanetary rust bucket. Her devotees will claim, correctly, that her movie blooms with provocative ideas...

Arizona RepublicSamantha Incorvaia

[I]n "High Life," it feels like the challenge is beyond comprehension to invest in the non-linear plot or the annoying characters.

Washington PostMark Jenkins

[The] most amazing moments are never amazing enough to jar it out of its static orbit.

New YorkerRichard Brody

It's as if the events of the film are excerpts from a master script emphasizing the most apparent and foregrounded...fraught with a slowed-down pace of action, to render simple actions portentous.

Sometimes absurd but always absorbing, Claire Denis's sci-fi adventure begins with a bit of baby talk. "Da-da," cosmonaut Monte coos to his infant daughter during their celestial voyage. It's an apt prelude for a film that drifts off into Dadaism.

Austin ChronicleRichard Whittaker

High Life is a meandering mess of symbolism, half-thoughts, ponderous exchanges, and emotional dead ends, one that confuses ambiguity for an un-engaging air of vagueness.

High Life (a bittersweet irony of a title) is a perfect combination of [Claire] Denis' art-house sensibilities, her prodigious skill, and her larger-flashier eye toward the unknown and indistinguishable.
