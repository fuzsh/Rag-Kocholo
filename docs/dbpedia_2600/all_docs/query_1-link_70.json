        "text": "Pickens HAS to know that adding someone of Aiyuk's caliber across from him only makes his job easier.\n\nYes that is what it seems like. Aiyuk isn't going back to San Francisco and he won't accept a trade to the Browns or Pats, he wants to be a Steeler and a deal will get worked out.\n\nRemember a few seasons ago when a recently acquired linebacker (Ingram? Can’t really remember.) was bellyaching about something, and boom he was gone! Tomlin said something about needing volunteers, not hostages.\n\nI don’t know why, but the wide receiver position seems to have an out-of-proportion number of yamheads.\n\nThey also had Mathew Stafford!\n\nNot a fan of addition by subtraction. I know it's been said a few times in this thread but I want them to add weapons, not swap them. Besides, you have no idea how good Wilson could be and right now he's cheap. If he ends up balling out for another team on his rookie contract, that will not go over well.\n\nDeke just reported it sounds like a 2nd in 25, 4th in 26 and CA3, and the steelers are going to make Aiyuk very rich. That trade is really not bad, I think CA3 can be good, even very good, I just dont know if he has the build to be a regular 2 or even 3. I think trading Wilson would be pretty stupid. You have had CA3 for 2 years, he may catch lighting, but Wilson has potential yet to explore. With Aiyuk, Pickens, and Muth we have 3 legitimate targets, Wilson can grow a lot this year.\n\nMe. And. You. BOTH!!\n\nI still believe sonething gets done before Friday. That said, I just wish it be done now.\n\nPickens having Aiyuk will only permit him to add to his potential bank account should he continue his high level of play. For that matter, while this is too far out for Pickens' potential extension, acquiring Aiyuk could spell the end for Pickens. Pittsburgh isnt paying two WRs $30 million or more.\n\nHow do I know?! I aksed the Cincinnati Bengals. They seem to be ready for life without Tee Higgins.\n\nI'm on board with all of that. That would be a trade I could get behind for sure.\n\nIf that’s the deal, it’s not too rich at all in terms of the trade portion. I hold out more hope for CA3 than most, but the trade compensation overall doesn’t bother me much. I just wonder how rich we intend to make Aiyuk. I mean, he’s good. Maybe top 10-15 WR good. But $30 million+ per year good?"
