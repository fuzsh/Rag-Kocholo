        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis study provides insights into real-life management of patients with NDD-CKD anemia, including ESA treatment and concomitant iron therapy, in Germany, Spain, and the UK. Across the three countries, the mean and median Hb level at ESA initiation was 9.8 g/dL, which is in accordance with KDIGO guidelines for anemia treatment in patients with NDD-CKD.7 However, the Hb level at initiation ranged from 5 to 13 g/dL, indicating that some patients were initiated on ESAs despite having a Hb level above 10.0 g/dL. In addition, 9% of patients did not have a recorded Hb measurement upon ESA initiation, despite the guideline recommendations. As these patients did have Hb measurements at later dates, we consider the missing data to be evidence that Hb levels were not measured close to ESA initiation for these patients, rather than indicative of incomplete data extraction.\n\nIt is also recommended to monitor Hb concentration every 3 months, yet only 65% had an Hb measurement observed at 3 months after ESA initiation, and this proportion continued to decline up to 15 months. The reasons for the missing data are uncertain and may be due to incomplete documentation in the original medial record, and/or CKD progression to dialysis, ESRD, transplant, or death. Our findings are similar to those from the international CKDopps study, in which <50% of patients with an index Hb level <10 g/dL had a Hb measurement in the subsequent 3 months.2,9\n\nKDIGO guidelines recommend a target Hb level of 10 to ≤11.5 g/dL for ESA treatment, while noting that higher Hb targets (11.5 to ≤13 g/dL) may be beneficial for individual patients.7 For the purposes of this study, patients were considered to have met the target Hb level if they had a documented Hb measurement between 10 and 12 g/dL (the higher target level allowed for variability in the guideline recommendations and potential laboratory errors). Within 2 years, the majority of patients achieved this target. However, it is uncertain how many patients maintained their target level: by 12 months after target achievement, <50% of patients had a documented Hb level within the target range, and there was a substantial proportion with missing data.\n\nPrior to ESA initiation, approximately 60% of patients had received either IV or oral iron therapy; this could indicate that iron deficiency had been explicitly investigated and corrected in line with KDIGO guidelines. However, ferritin and TSAT measurements were missing at ESA initiation for 15% and 33% of patients, respectively, so it is not possible to determine whether iron therapy was indicated for these patients. Moreover, only approximately half of patients had documented ferritin and TSAT measurements in the months following ESA initiation, and only 36% and 42% of patients received concomitant IV and/or oral iron therapy, respectively. After ESA initiation, patients did not remain iron deficient over the 2-year observation period: TSAT levels were consistently >20% and ferritin >100 ng/mL, based on available measurements. In the CKDopps study, 26–77% of patients with NDD-CKD stages 3a–5, depending on country and CKD stage, had no TSAT or ferritin measurements within 3 months of their index Hb measurement,9 and only 29–43% of patients with Hb <10 g/dL received iron therapy in the 3 months following their index Hb measurement.9 Other research in Italy found that a majority of patients with iron deficiency (TSAT ≤20% and ferritin ≤100 ng/mL) did not receive iron therapy,11 while a study of nephrology centers in Ireland reported that only 14.1% of patients with iron deficiency received iron therapy.14\n\nDespite availability of global (KDIGO) guidelines, there were differences in the management of these patients between countries. There was a substantially higher rate of blood transfusions in Spain than in Germany or the UK, which may be linked to the lower use of IV iron in Spain compared with the other countries. Conversely, in the UK, there was a markedly higher use of IV versus oral iron, whereas the reverse was seen in the other two countries. The suboptimal management of anemia and iron deficiency, and between-country differences in management, may reflect variability between KDIGO and national or local guidelines, or uncertainty as to their application.8,14 Another underlying cause may be lack of resources or training,15 or country-specific medical administration practices.\n\nA notable finding of our study was the tendency for inflammation to be associated with higher ESA doses, although this was not consistent across all ESA types. This may indicate resistance to ESAs in patients with inflammation, either because of infection16 or because other possible causes of anemia were not sufficiently investigated. This finding is consistent with a study of patients with CKD in Sweden, which found a clear relationship between CRP levels and ESA dose.3 Alternatively, functional iron deficiency could be a consequence of inflammatory status, since inflammation upregulates hepcidin, causing iron to be trapped within cells and making it unavailable for erythropoiesis.3 Moreover, our data show that a numerically higher proportion of patients with either consistent or fluctuating inflammation received a blood transfusion than those with no inflammation. However, due to the nature of this study, statistical analyses were not conducted for these relationships and no firm conclusions can be drawn. CRP levels were unusually high (mean 13.1 mg/L, median 5.0 mg/L)—it is not certain whether this is due to poor data recording or if it is reflective of the real-life situation. Some patients may have had intercurrent bacterial infection or the numbers may reflect a negative selection bias, whereby HCPs were more likely to monitor and record CRP data for patients whose levels were abnormal.\n\nStrengths of this study include its 2-year observation period, which enabled longitudinal follow-up of patient outcomes from ESA treatment. This study was of a retrospective, observational, non-interventional design, in which centers were not selected on the basis of their compliance with clinical best practice. We, therefore, consider it representative of typical clinical practice in the participating countries.\n\nHowever, the retrospective design and dependence on medical records are also limitations, as it was not possible to follow up on the reasons underlying the observed data. The dependence on medical records may have led to the absence of some patient data, since records require that treating physicians are sufficiently motivated to provide complete information. We also acknowledge that relatively modest numbers of patients from each country were included. In addition, with the exception of the incidence data for dialysis, ESRD, kidney transplant, and death, the last possible date for the 24-month follow-up was December 31, 2017; consequently, the data analyzed here are a minimum of four years old and some changes in clinical practice may have occurred in the intervening period. The study was designed to be descriptive and no hypothesis testing was conducted. Lastly, the convenience sampling strategy for recruiting HCPs and high levels of missing data restrict the conclusions that can be drawn; caution should be taken when extrapolating these findings to other patient populations."
