PMID: 37317861; PMCID: PMC10527348.\n\nSummary of Evidence for SSRF:\n\nSSRF in clinical flail chest and unstable chest wall injuries\n\nFour randomized controlled trials comparing SSRF to non-operative management have been conducted in patients with flail chest.4,5,6,7 All patients enrolled in these four trials had a clinical flail chest injury and nearly all had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe first trail enrolled 37 patients with “severe” flail chest (e., flail chest injury of ≥6 ribs) and randomized them to either SSRF with Judet struts or usual care with positive pressure ventilation (called “internal pneumatic stabilization” in the trial).4 Patients were allocated on HD#5. No power calculation or prespecified primary endpoints. SSRF patients had decreased incidence of pneumonia on day 21 (4 [22%] vs. 17 [90%], p < 0.05), decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (10.8 [±3.4] days vs. 18.3 [±7.4] days, p < 0.05), decreased ICU length of stay (16.5 [±7.4] days vs. 26.8 [±13.2] days, p < 0.05), and decreased incidence of tracheostomy at day 21 (3 [17%] vs. 15 [79%], p < 0.05). For quality of life outcomes, fewer patients in the SSRF group reported “chest tightness” (6 [33%] vs. 16 [84%], p < 0.05), “thoracic cage pain” (7 [39%] vs. 17 [89%], p < 0.05), and “dyspnea on effort” (5 [28%] vs. 12 [63%], p < 0.05) at 12 months after injury. SSRF patients were also more likely to be back at work at 6 months after injury (11 [61%] vs. 1 [5%], p < 0.01). While this difference was no longer observed at 12 months, more people in the SSRF group were back to high activity jobs (13 [72%] vs. 3 [16%], p < 0.01).\n\nThe second trial enrolled 40 patients and allocated them at 36 hours to SSRF with K wires or “strapping and packing” (an adhesive plaster dressing designed to provide external fixation of the flail segment).5 No power calculation or prespecified primary endpoints. Standard deviations and interquartile ranges for length of stay outcomes were not provided. SSRF patients had fewer ventilator days (2 days vs. 12 days, p < 0.001) and a shorter ICU length of stay (9.6 days vs. 14.6 days, p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (11.7 days vs. 23.1 days, p < 0.001). SSRF patients also had improved incentive spirometry measurements (FVC, TLC, and FEF75) at 2 months after injury.\n\nThe third trial enrolled 46 patients and allocated them at 48 hours to usual care with positive pressure ventilation or SSRF using bioabsorbable plates.6 The study was powered to the primary outcomes of ventilator days and ICU length of stay. SSRF patients had a decreased ICU length of stay (324 [238-380] hours vs. 448 [323-647] hours, p = 0.03) and decreased incidence of tracheostomy (9 [23%] vs. 16 [70%], p = 0.04). However, there were no differences in spirometry results at 3 months or quality of life measured by the Short Form 36 at 6 months after injury.\n\nThe fourth trial enrolled 50 patients with flail chest and ISS ≥16 and randomized them to either usual care or SSRF.7 The study was powered to a primary outcome of ventilator days, though only 80% of the patients enrolled required mechanical ventilation. Patients in the SSRF group had fewer ventilator days (7 [6-10 days] vs. 9 [7-12] days, p = 0.012) and a shorter ICU length of stay (10 [7-12] days vs. 12 [9-15] days, p = 0.032), though these benefits were driven primarily by the subgroup of patients with pulmonary contusions. The SSRF group also had a lower incidence of ARDS (7 [28%] vs. 15 [60%], p = 0.045)\n\nA fifth study enrolled patients with clinical flail chest as well as “unstable chest wall” injuries (any one of the following: >100% displacement of 3 or more ribs, loss of thoracic volume [>25% volume loss of involved lobe(s)], overriding of ≥3 rib fractures by at least 15 mm each, or ≥3 rib fractures associated with intra-parenchymal injury).[i] This multicenter trial enrolled 207 patients at 15 level 1 trauma centers in the US and Canada and allocated them to SSRF or usual care within 72 hours of injury. The study was powered to a primary outcome of ventilator-free days in the first 28 days after injuries. Patients in the SSRF group had more ventilator-free days (mean difference 2.1 days, 95% CI -0.3 to 4.5 days, p = 0.09), though the difference did not meet statistical significance. Mortality was also lower in the operative group (0 [0%] vs. 6 [6%], p = 0.01), however only half as many patients in the SSRF group required mechanical ventilation after randomization. Tests of interaction for the pre-specified subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization showed greater potential benefit in patients that were ventilated and no benefit in patients who were not ventilated.\n\nSSRF in non-flail injuries\n\nTwo randomized controlled trials comparing SSRF to usual care have been conducted in the non-clinical flail chest population.9,10\n\nThe first trial enrolled 124 patients with ≥3 consecutive rib fractures and either refractory pain or bicortical displacement at four Australian Level 1 trauma centers.9 Patients were allocated to either SSRF or usual care within 48 hours of arrival to the hospital. The study was powered to a primary endpoint of Pain Rating Index (PRI) at 3 months following injury as assessed by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (higher PRI equating to worse pain). At 3 months the median PRI in SSRF patients was nearly double that of usual care patients (7.7 [1.7-19.8] vs. 3.6 [0.7-15.3], p = 0.17), though this did not reach statistical significance. At 6 months, PRI remained higher in the SSRF group, this time reaching statistical significance (2.6 [0-17.1] vs. 0 [0-5.7], p = 0.04). Despite this, more patients in the SSRF group were back to work at 6 months (23 [66%] vs. 14 [37%], p = 0.01). Inpatient opioid exposure and quality of life (measured by the Short Form 12) at 3 and 6 months were similar between groups.\n\nThe second trial enrolled 84 patients at a single center with a “severe chest wall injury” (defined as any one of: ≥5 consecutive rib fractures, ≥1 bicortically displaced fracture, or radiographic flail segment).10 Patients were randomized to either SSRF or usual care at a median of 48 hours and stratified by unit of admission as a proxy for injury severity. The study was powered to a primary outcome of hospital length of stay, but the final enrollment was underpowered for the primary outcome. Regardless, SSRF patients experienced a greater hospital length of stay (9 [6-20] days vs. 6 [3-11] days, p = 0.005). After adjusting for the stratification variable, hospital length of stay remained greater in the SSRF group (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.83). Daily opioid exposure was similar between groups, as was the incidence of opioid prescription at discharge. Quality of life at 1 month (measured by the EQ-5D-5L) was worse for the SSRF group in the Mobility (3 [2-3] vs. 2 [1-2], p = 0.012) and Self-Care (3 [2-3] vs. 2 [1-2], p = 0.034) dimensions, though these differences were no longer observed at 3 and 6 months.\n\nSSRF in symptomatic non-union\n\nNo randomized controlled trials or cohort studies of SSRF in patients with chronic pain from non-union of a rib fracture could be identified. Several case reports have been published, all of which favor the use of SSRF in this population.\n\nAPPENDIX B.

PMID: 36462798.\n\nSummary of Evidence for Regional Analgesia in Multiple Rib Fractures\n\nThoracic Epidural Analgesia\n\nFour randomized controlled trials have compared thoracic epidural analgesia to systemic pain medications.12,13,14,15\n\nThe first study was a pilot trial of trauma patients admitted to the ICU with “multiple rib and pelvic fractures, but without head injuries.”12 Patients were randomized to either continuous + PRN intravenous morphine or epidural opioids. The trial was not powered to a primary endpoint. The epidural group had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (3.07 [±1.3] days vs. 18.23 [±18.1] days, p < 0.05), shorter ICU LOS (5.93 [±1.4] days vs. 18.69 [±5.2] days, p < 0.05), and shorter hospital LOS (14.85 [±2.2] days vs. 47.69 [±14.7] days, p < 0.05). Incidence of tracheostomy was decreased in the epidural group (6.7% vs. 38.5%, p < 0.05). However, the lack of clarity regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria and the screening process used is a significant limitation. Additionally, the sheer magnitude of the difference between the groups (epidural group spent 2 fewer weeks on the ventilator and in the ICU and 4 fewer weeks in the hospital) raises concern for selection bias.\n\nThe second trial enrolled trauma patients with ≥3 rib fractures or flail chest/sternum (n = 32).13 Patients were randomized to epidural analgesia with fentanyl or intravenous fentanyl within 24 hours of presentation. The trial was not powered to a primary outcome. Vital capacity was improved in both groups after initiating the allocated pain control regimen, but the groups were not compared to one another. Tidal volume, respiratory rate, and minute volume were not improved in either group. PaCO2 increased and PaO2 decreased in the intravenous fentanyl group. These values did not change in the epidural group, and the two groups were not compared to one another. Hospital LOS was the same in both groups. The trial is limited by selection of less meaningful outcome measures and the manner in which they were compared (favoring before/after comparisons within each randomization group to comparisons between the randomization groups). Although the authors conclude that epidural analgesia should be the preferred method of pain management in patients with multiple rib fractures, this conclusion does not appear to be supported by the data provided in their study.\n\nThe third trial enrolled trauma patients with ≥3 rib fractures, a flail segment, pulmonary contusion, or sternal fracture (n = 24).14 Patients were randomized to either patient-controlled epidural analgesics (0.25% bupivacaine + morphine) or patient-controlled intravenous opioids (morphine). The trial was not powered to a primary outcome. 34 patients were initially enrolled but 10 withdrew. Reasons for withdrawal were not provided. Visual Analog Score was improved for the epidural group at 24h (scores not provided, p < 0.05) and 72h (3.8 vs. ???, p < 0.05). Maximum inspiratory force was greater for the epidural group at 72h (data not provided, p < 0.05). Tidal volume was also better for the epidural group at 72h (590 mL vs. 327 mL, p < 0.05). Plasma cytokine levels were similar at all time points, except IL-8 which was lower in the epidural group at 48h and 72h (data not provided, p < 0.05). Urinary catecholamines were similar at all time points. Given the lack of detail regarding methodology, failure to consider confounders, and failure to discuss why 29% of the enrolled patients withdrew from the study, the study results should be regarded with caution.\n\nThe fourth trial enrolled trauma patients with >3 rib fractures (n = 46). 15 Patients were randomly assigned to epidural analgesia or intravenous opioids. The trial was powered to a primary outcome of pneumonia within the first 28 days using the CDC definition. Incidence of pneumonia was greater in the systemic opioids group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (9 [38%] vs. 4 [18%], p = 0.15). Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay were similar between groups. Multivariable regression models were then performed to adjust for confounders (generally not a recommended analytic strategy in a randomized controlled trial). However, the authors report an increased odds of pneumonia for the IV opioid group (OR 6.0 [95% CI 1.0-35], p = 0.05) and an increase in ventilator days for the IV opioid group (RR 2.0 [95% CI 1.6-2.6], p < 0.001). There were no differences in mortality or LOS.\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared thoracic epidural to lumbar epidural.16 The trial randomized 55 patients with isolated blunt thoracic trauma admitted to the ICU to thoracic epidural analgesia (placed at the T5-T6 or T6-T7 intercostal space) or lumbar epidural analgesia (placed at the L2-L3 or L3-L4 intercostal space). The study was powered to a primary endpoint of incidence of mechanical ventilation or incidence of pneumonia. Visual Analog pain scores were similar between groups, as was the daily opioid exposure. Incidence of pneumonia, incidence of mechanical ventilation, and duration of mechanical ventilation were also similar between groups.\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared thoracic epidural with bupivacaine alone to thoracic epidural with bupivacaine plus dexmedetomidine.17 The trial randomized 64 patients with multiple rib fractures and “respiratory symptoms.” The catheter was maintained for three days in all patients and removed on day 4. Timing of allocation was not specified. The study was powered to a primary outcome of Visual Analog pain score. Visual Analog Scores were lower in the bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine group on day 2 (5.55 (±2.45) vs. 6.85 (±3.54), p < 0.001), day 3 (2.89 [±0.99] vs. 4.90 [±1.44], p < 0.001), and day 4 (1.05 [±0.78] vs. 2.67 [±0.67], p < 0.001). Some arterial blood gas measurements demonstrated statistically significant differences between the groups that were not clinically meaningful (e.g., PaO2 71.56 [±10.64] vs. 78.01 [±6.1], p = 0.002).\n\nParavertebral Nerve Blockade\n\nTwo randomized controlled trials have compared paravertebral nerve blockade to systemic pain medications.18, 19\n\nThe first study was a randomized controlled trial of American Society of Anesthesiology class 2 or 3 trauma patients with ≥1 rib fracture who underwent surgical stabilization of the fractured ribs (n = 60).18 Patients were randomized to post-operative patient-controlled paravertebral nerve blockade or patient-controlled intravenous opioids. The study was not powered to a primary outcome. PaO2 measurements and P:F ratios were clinically and statistically better in the paravertebral nerve blockade group at all timepoints (30 minutes, 60 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours). FEV1 was also improved in the paravertebral nerve blockade group at 72 hours (2.9 [±4] L vs. 2.2 [±0.5] L, p < 0.01).\n\nThe second study was a randomized controlled trial of trauma patients with ≥3 unilateral rib fractures (n = 90).19 Patients were randomized to either patient-controlled paravertebral nerve blockade with ropivacaine or patient-controlled intravenous opioids with sufentanil. The trial was powered to a primary outcome of pain score measured by visual analog scale. VAS scores were lower in the paravertebral group at 60 min after induction of analgesia (3.9 vs 4.9, p < 0.05 [95% CI not provided]) and at 24 hours (3.4 vs 4.1, p < 0.05 [95% CI not provided]). VAS scores were the same in both groups at 48 and 72 hours. FVC, FEV1/FVC, and peak expiratory flow rates were improved in the epidural group at 1 hour and 72 hours (p < 0.05). There was no difference in mortality.\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared paravertebral nerve blockade to thoracic epidural analgesia.20 The trial randomized adult trauma patients with ≥3 consecutive unilateral rib fractures (n = 30) to either thoracic epidural analgesia with bupivacaine or paravertebral nerve blockade with bupivacaine. Timing of allocation was not specified. The trial was not powered to a primary outcome. Both thoracic epidural and paravertebral nerve blockade showed similar decreases in Visual Analog Scores from baseline at 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 72 hours. P:F ratio was similar between groups at 30 minutes and 24 hours but greater in the paravertebral group at 72 hours (mean difference not reported, p = 0.018). Inpatient opioid exposure, ICU length of stay, and hospital stay were slightly greater in the paravertebral group, though these did not reach statistical significance. Twice as many patients in the epidural group experienced hypotension (6 [40%] vs. 1 [7%], p = 0.04).\n\nIntercostal Nerve Blockade\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared intercostal nerve blockade to systemic pain medications.21 The trial was a single center double-blinded study that enrolled adult trauma patients with ≥2 rib fractures and inability to achieve > 50% predicted inspiratory capacity on incentive spirometry. Patients were randomized to either intercostal injection with liposomal bupivacaine or peri-intercostal subcutaneous injection with 0.9% sodium chloride (the proceduralist was not blinded). The trial was powered to a primary endpoint of total inpatient opioid exposure in morphine milligram equivalents (MME). However, the study was stopped short of its planned enrollment (powered to n = 200; actual n = 100). Although there was a significant decrease in MME exposure in both groups over time, there were no differences between groups. In tests of interaction for patients with ≤ 6 fractures, 7-12 fractures, or ≥ 13 fractures, there was no differential treatment effect. Numeric pain rating scores were also similar between groups at all time points. Incentive spirometry volumes were greater in the bupivacaine group on day 1 and day 2 but not day 3.\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared single shot intercostal nerve blockade to “continuous intercostal nerve blockade” with an indwelling catheter.22 This single center trial enrolled adult trauma patients with rib fractures undergoing planned SSRF (n = 34). Patients were randomized to either intercostal nerve blockade with an admixture of 0.25% bupivacaine plus liposomal bupivacaine or placement of an infusion catheter beneath the scapula for infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine (both done at the time of SSRF). However, the catheter position beneath the scapula is of questionable efficacy, since local anesthetic infused in this location would not effectively block either the intercostal nerves or any recognized myofascial plane. The trial was powered to a primary endpoint of Sequential Clinical Assessment of Respiratory Function (SCARF) score measured at 10:00 AM daily. Median SCARF scores on post-operative days 1-5 were similar between groups. Median daily opioid exposure was lower in the intercostal group on post-operative days 1-4, but the differences were not statistically significant.\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared intercostal nerve blockade to intrapleural analgesia.23 The trial enrolled non-intubated adult trauma patients with rib fractures and “disturbed ABG parameters” who required a chest tube (n = 30). Patients were randomized to either intercostal nerve blockade with bupivacaine at the time of chest tube insertion or intrapleural analgesia with bupivacaine through the chest tube once it was placed. The trial was not powered to a primary endpoint. PaO2 was higher and HCO3 was lower in the intercostal nerve blockade group, though these differences were not clinically meaningful. Mean numeric pain scores were decreased in the intercostal nerve blockade group (1.68 [±0.02] vs. 6.29 [±2.9], p = 0.001). Mean opioid exposure in the 12 hours following the procedure was greater in the intrapleural group (4.1 [±1.1] mg vs. 1.65 [±0.48] mg, p = 0.001).\n\nIntrapleural Analgesia\n\nTwo randomized controlled trials have compared intrapleural analgesia to systemic pain medications.24, 25\n\nThe first study was a randomized controlled trial of trauma patients with ≥1 rib fracture (n = 42) who presented within 12 hours of injury with FVC <70% of predicted.24 Patients were randomly assigned to intrapleural analgesia (IPA) or systemic opioids using an even/odd distribution based on the sequentially assigned admission number (this is not a preferred methodology). The trial was not powered to a primary outcome. Change in FVC was greater in the IPA group in the most severely impaired subset of patients (initial mean FVC <20% predicted), however it does not appear that this was a pre-specified subgroup and was not stratified in the randomization. Adverse outcomes, including PNA, were the same between groups.\n\nThe second study was a randomized control trial of adult trauma patients with a blunt chest wall injury (n = 16) who were randomized to intrapleural infusions of either saline or an admixture of lidocaine and bupivacaine.25 The study was not powered to a primary endpoint. Inpatient opioid exposure and spirometry measurements (FVC and FEV1) were similar between groups.\n\nMyofascial Plane Blockade\n\nOne randomized controlled trial compared serratus plane blockade to systemic pain medications.26 The single center trial enrolled adult trauma patients with rib fractures and a numeric pain score of ≥ 4 (n = 60). Patients were randomized to either serratus anterior plane blockade with 0.25% bupivacaine plus patient-controlled systemic analgesia with intravenous tramadol (demand only; no continuous infusion) or patient-controlled analgesia alone. The trial was powered to a primary outcome of tramadol exposure in the first 24 hours. Tramadol exposure was decreased in the serratus plane group (98.33 [±74.13] mg vs. 148.30 [±87.68] mg, p = 0.02). Numeric pain scores were also lower in the serratus plane group at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours.\n\nFour randomized trials have compared erector spinae plane blockade (ESPB) to other regional analgesia techniques.27, 28, 29, 30\n\nOne trial compared ESPB to retrolaminar blockade.27 This single-center double-blinded trial enrolled adult trauma patients with 3-6 unilateral rib fractures undergoing planned SSRF (n = 80). Patients were randomized to either ESPB or retrolaminar blockade (both using ropivacaine after the induction of general anesthesia and prior to the start of SSRF). The trial was powered to a primary outcome of intraoperative remifentanil exposure. The anesthesiologist, patient, and outcomes assessors were blinded to the treatment group. Remifentanil exposure was decreased in the retrolaminar group (392.8 [±118.7] µg vs. 501.7 [±190.0] µg, p < 0.01). Post-operatively, there was no difference in opioid exposure. Visual analog pain scores were lower in the retrolaminar group at 2, 4, and 12 hours, but the differences were not clinically meaningful (mean differences 0.7 points, 0.6 points, 0.5 points, and 0.5 points, all p < 0.05). PaCO2 was decreased and diaphragmatic excursion was increased in the retrolaminar group, though the differences were not clinically meaningful.\n\nOne trial compared ESPB to serratus anterior plane blockade.28 This single-center double-blinded trial enrolled adult trauma patients with rib fractures and an ASA score of 1 or 2 admitted to the ICU (n = 50). Patients were randomized to either ESPB (with 0.25% bupivacaine) and sham SAPB or SAPB (with 0.25% bupivacaine) and sham ESPB. The trial was powered to a primary endpoint of Numeric Pain Score (NPS). The patient and outcomes assessors were blinded to the allocation group. NPS was lower in the ESPB group at 6 hours (1 [1-2] vs. 2 [2-2.5], p <0.001), 12 hours (3 [2-3] vs. 3 [3-4], p = 0.002), and 24 hours (4 [3-4] vs. 4 [3.5-5], p = 0.048), however the differences were not clinically meaningful. Tramadol exposure in the first 24 hours was also decreased in the ESPB group (50 [50-100] mg vs. 100 [75-150] mg, p = 0.004). Diaphragmatic excursion was improved in the ESPB group at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the block, but the differences were not clinically meaningful.\n\nOne trial compared ESPB to paravertebral nerve blockade.29 This single-center trial enrolled adult trauma patients with multiple unilateral rib fractures and Visual Analog pain scores (VAS) ≥ 7 (n = 60). Patients were randomized to either ESPB or paravertebral nerve blockade using an admixture of 0.5% bupivacaine and dexamethasone. Both patients and clinicians were reported to be blinded to the allocation group, but details about the blinding strategies were not provided. The trial was powered to a primary endpoint of opioid exposure in the first 24 hours. Opioid exposure in the first 24 hours, the time from blockade to the need for the first rescue dose of opioids, and the incidence of rescue opioids were similar between groups. VAS measured at 30 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, and 24 hours were also similar. More patients in the paravertebral group experienced hypotension (6 [20%] vs. 0 [0%], p = 0.024).\n\nOne trial compared ESPB to intercostal nerve blockade.30 The trial enrolled adult trauma patients with either blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma (n = 50). The presence of rib fractures was not necessary for inclusion. Patients were randomized to either ESPB or intercostal nerve blockade with 1% lidocaine. The trial was powered to a primary endpoint of Numeric Pain Score (NPS) at 60 minutes after blockade. NPS was lower in the ESPB group at 20 minutes (5.2 [±1.2] 6.1 [±1.3], p = 0.04) and 60 minutes (4.1 [±1.0] vs. 5.4 [±1.2], p = 0.001), and decrease in NPS from baseline was greater at 20 minutes (-2.7 [±1.5] vs. -1.2 [±0.9], p = 0.001) and 60 minutes (-3.9 [±1.5] vs. -1 [±0.9], p < 0.001).\n\nReferences\n\nEdwards JG, Clarke P, Pieracci FM, Bemelman M, Black EA, Doben A, Gasparri M, Gross R, Jun W, Long WB, Lottenberg L, Majercik S, Marasco S, Mayberry J, Sarani B, Schulz-Drost S, Van Boerum D, Whitbeck S, White T; Chest Wall Injury Society collaborators.
