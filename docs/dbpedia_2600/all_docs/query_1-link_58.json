        "text": "A customer says this to a coworker on the morning shift:\n\nCustomer: “My to-go order was wrong, y’all said you would give me a free burger.”\n\nOur burgers are $20 a pop, by the way! Since our morning staff are the sweethearts:\n\nCoworker: “Oh, sorry to hear that! Let me get that sorted for you!”\n\nThey comped her without issue, but we have to tell management about these things.\n\nI come in to close that night and overhear my opener explaining what happened to the manager. I ask:\n\nMe: “Well, who did she talk to?”\n\nCoworker: “She said the girl who kinda looks like me, but normally works nights.”\n\nWe have a small staff. This coworker and I are the only two black women, so this woman is referring to me.\n\nMe: “I said no such thing.”\n\nMy manager believed me, got a description of the customer from our coworker, and I went about my day.\n\nAbout three weeks later this customer comes back with a group during my night shift. She’s wearing the same big flashy fur coat.\n\nCustomer: *To the group.* “Everyone order as one! I’ll pay!”\n\nShe goes to pay but then hits me with the same story.\n\nCustomer: “My to-go order was wrong last time, y’all said you would give me a free burger!”\n\nMe: “Who did you talk to? When was the order placed? What was wrong with it?”\n\nCustomer: “I spoke to—”\n\nMe: “—and why weren’t you given a gift card? Where’s the receipt?”\n\nAll rapid fire. She looks like a deer in headlights and tries to answer but can’t.\n\nCustomer: “I called and talked to a manager.”\n\nMe: “Oh really? We don’t have a customer phone, so I think you’re at the wrong place.”\n\nCustomer: “I want to talk to the manager!”\n\nThis is the same manager who we spoke about this before. The customer tells the same story.\n\nManager: “Without at least a receipt there is nothing I can do. You’ll be expected to pay the whole bill; nothing is being comped.”\n\nShe eventually does try to pay but her card gets declined and she has to sheepishly ask her friend, stating:\n\nCustomer: “I brought the wrong card, haha!”\n\nThink this is the end? Nope! She tries this AGAIN about a month later back with our morning server. Sadly for her, we trained them to not be scammed like this and the customer was banned from all our locations for life.\n\nI am a college senior doing freelance web design to scrape up some extra cash. My current client is a well-respected public speaker who needed a professional website. After just starting development on Thursday, the following interaction occurred on Friday afternoon as I was about to leave his office.\n\nMe: “All right, I have created a template of what the home page of the site will look like. Let me know if this is the feel you’re going for, and I can expand it from there.”\n\nClient: “Looks great! Please finish the website and wrap this up by the end of today!”\n\nMe: “Err… I just started work on this yesterday. Creating an entire site requires a lot more time than that. Not to mention, you still haven’t sent me any content.”\n\nClient: “Well, I’ve been told that you are a hard-working student, so hearing this from you is disappointing. In the future, please wrap up your projects before the weekend. “\n\nMe: “…Okay. Would you be able to send me the website content so I can finish?”\n\nClient: “I will email you the information in a week or two.”\n\nIt is just after a hurricane has gone through, and cleanup is underway. My friends and I have stopped by a coffee shop for some drinks.\n\nOut the back of the shop is a deck. Below the deck is about a twenty-foot drop to a swampy area, where there are currently several gators just chilling. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my friend bursts out:\n\nFriend: “Is that a f****** kitten?”\n\nWe’re all looking around for the kitty when it dawns on us. He means down there. With the gators. I look over the edge of the deck, and sure enough, there’s a small animal in the remnants of a fallen tree, a short distance from the gators.\n\nFriend: “I’m gonna grab him.”\n\nOther Friend: “Those gators will get you before you get halfway.”\n\nFriend: “Not if I climb down that fallen tree.”\n\nYup, there’s a tree that’s fallen, leaning against the deck of the next shop over, that slants at an angle down to the swamp land and could possibly be climbed. The bottom is resting near another tree, which could possibly be climbed across to reach the kitten.\n\nOther Friend: “If you fall, it’s suicide.”\n\nFriend: “I won’t fall. Look, you guys hold the tree steady while I climb. I’m gonna go down, grab the kitten, and haul a*se.”\n\nNow, at this point, I realize we’re not going to talk him out of it.\n\nMe: “Just, please be careful.”\n\nOther Friend: “Test those branches before you step on them. They might have gotten damaged when the tree came down.”\n\nSo, the four of us are holding this fallen tree as steady as we can as our friend slowly climbs down it. He gets to the bottom, swings off onto fallen tree #2, and crawls along that until broken tree #3 with the kitten is in arm’s reach. He grabs the kitten, tucks it into his t-shirt, and begins his ascent.\n\nSomehow, he makes it out of there okay. But I was holding my breath and super anxious the whole time.\n\nFriend: “So, it wasn’t exactly a kitten.”\n\nHe pulls out a baby possum. The little guy looks pretty bedraggled but is breathing and moving.\n\nMe: “His mother must have lost him in the storm. If she survived.”\n\nOther Friend: “Should we take him to a wildlife rescue?”\n\nCue some googling for wildlife rescues that might possibly rehabilitate a lost baby possum. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get in touch with anyone, probably due to the aftermath of the storm, so our friend took the little guy home.\n\nAnd still has him!\n\nHe named him Moriarity, and let me tell you, the little guy is adorable. He’s basically a cat. He’ll beg for your food, climb in your lap, and generally follow you around the house. He’s very well-behaved, litter-trained, and very sweet. I guess he lucked out and got to be a spoiled house possum.\n\nI once asked my friend if he would still have gone down if he knew it was a possum. His response?\n\nFriend: “F*** yeah, possums are awesome.”\n\nI get a call from one of our rooms.\n\nGuest: “Call me an Uber!”\n\nMe: “You’d like to call a taxi. Sir?”\n\nGuest: “No, I need you to book me an Uber for right now to go to [Nightclub].”\n\nMe: “I can give you a number to a taxi service, sir, but we don’t book rideshare vehicles for our guests.”\n\nGuest: “But I’m a hotel guest! You gotta!”\n\nMe: “If the hotel made a booking for you on Uber we would need access to your Uber login details.”\n\nGuest: “Wait, so the hotel doesn’t have its own Uber account?”\n\nMe: “No, sir.”\n\nGuest: “So I gotta pay?!”\n\nMe: “You would need to pay for your own taxi, sir. That’s not something the hotel provides.”\n\nGuest: “But I’m paying $300 a night to stay here! You should offer free taxi services like before!”\n\nMe: “If you’re referring to your airport pickup and drop-off, sir, that’s just a one-time service per reservation.”\n\nGuest: “Put your manager on!”\n\nMe: “My manager is in a meeting but will be out in about ten min—”\n\nGuest: “I’m coming down!” *Click.*\n\nMy manager comes out of his call a few minutes later and I tell him what happened. My manager rolls his eyes and know exactly who I am talking about, as this guy has been an overly-demanding problem guest since he checked in. The guest storms up to the front desk and demands to speak to the manager.\n\nManager: “Sir, you will need to call your own rideshare. We can call a taxi for you from a local service, but you would still need to pay for that yourself.\n\nGuest: “D*** it! Call me an Uber!”\n\nManager: “Okay… you’re an Uber.”\n\nThe guest opened his mouth to shout some more, but blinked, closed his mouth, and paused. The dad joke totally derailed his momentum and he just… slowly walked towards the exit. We later saw him getting into a taxi so I guess my manager’s “guest reboot” must have worked! My manager later told me to “not try that” as he wasn’t expecting it to work!\n\nI work in tech support. I get an irate call from a manager in one of our remote offices.\n\nManager: “Our computer is making horrible screechy noises!”\n\nMe: “Is there an error code on the screen?”\n\nManager: “I don’t know, maybe?”\n\nMe: “Well, if you could—”\n\nManager: “That’s computer stuff! I don’t know anything about computers!”\n\nMe: “Okay, does the computer boot up— turn on?”\n\nManager: “No, it’s just making horrible screechy noises!”\n\nTroubleshooting got me nowhere, so I drove to their remote location. Before I even walked into the office, I could hear the “horrible screechy noise,” and it wasn’t a continuous squeal; it was the rapid beep-beep-beep of a Dell motherboard keyboard error. Within seconds, I could see what the issue was.\n\nSo, without saying a word, I walked into the office, took the stapler off the keyboard, cycled the power, and walked out.\n\nThe manager in question — in most ways one of our best — tends to get cocky because he knows how good he is. But now, if he gets that way with me, all I have to do is say, “Stapler,” and he quiets down."
