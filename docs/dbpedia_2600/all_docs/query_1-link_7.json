        "text": "This is the story of the only time in my life that I have been overtaken by road rage.\n\nMy spouse has no understanding of travel time. We only have one car between us, and my spouse works closer to home, so I drop my spouse off at work, then go to my work.\n\nI am late every single day as a result. Fortunately, work doesn’t particularly care about that, but I find it personally annoying. I’ve always made it clear to my spouse how long they have left to get ready, what time we have to leave, and exactly how late I am. They always take extra time.\n\nThere’s a traffic circle between my spouse’s work and my work. The approach to the traffic circle is a narrow path with high curbs on either side.\n\nI notice a van sitting in the circle, but am not worried yet. I pull in behind the van. At this point I am locked into place: I cannot pass the van, and I certainly can’t turn around and go back.\n\nThe van sits there and waits. Maybe they can’t understand traffic circles. I can be a little paitent.\n\nThe sun shines through the van’s front window to the back and I see clearly that the owners are messing around with a GPS while blocking the intersection. That’s not OK.\n\nI hit my horn. Nothing happens. I wait a few minutes. Still messing with the GPS. I hit the horn again.\n\nBy the time I’ve lost my paitence I’ve been waiting for them to move for 15 minutes. I am now later to work than I’ve ever been. They’re usually willing to forgive me being five minutes late, even ten minutes late. I’m now 20 minutes late.\n\nI start hitting the horn constantly. Eventually a car enters the circle from another entrance. While it goes past the car I’m stuck behind I stop hitting the horn, after all it’s not their ‘fault’ they’re not moving if something is in the way. As soon as the car is past, I start hitting the horn again.\n\nThis repeats a few times. I am now 45 minutes late. They finally pull into the intersection. They drive super slowly through the traffic circle, and it’s physically impossible to go around them, but joke’s on them: I don’t care so long as they’re moving.\n\nProbably in an effort to show that they’re pissed at me for calling them out with their horn, once they get out of the traffic circle, and I can pass them they suddenly speed up. I don’t care, I’m not passing them anyway, I’m getting on the highway.\n\nI make it to work an hour late. After that, I was put on timelyness notice, and I was no longer allowed to be late. I started leaving home without my spouse if it was too tight to drop them off and make it to work in time, which lead to my spouse being later to their job, so they lost their job.\n\nI’m still angry thinking about the whole set of events.\n\nA few months later, when my spouse got a new job, they also got a car to go with it. We’ve been a two car family ever since.\n\nI still don’t expect my spouse to show up to any event, from family gatherings, to movies, on time, but since we don’t have to travel together, it doesn’t effect me, and is no longer a point of conflict in our relationship."
