        "text": "Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones met in 1998 at the Deauville Film Festival\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones got engaged in December 1999 and married the following November\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones share two children: son Dylan and daughter Carys\n\nThey separated in August 2013 but reconciled in 2014\n\nOscar-winning actors Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones share two children, a Sept. 25 birthday and they've been married for more than two decades.\n\nThe Fatal Attraction star immediately knew Zeta-Jones was the one after watching her in The Mask of Zorro in 1998. He had his publicist set up a date and although their first meeting didn't quite go as planned, the pair eventually welcomed a child and tied the knot in 2000.\n\nThey went on to have another child, and in November 2023, they celebrated 23 years of marriage. However, the Hollywood power couple's long-lasting relationship hasn't been without its bumps in the road. In 2013, Douglas and Zeta-Jones briefly split before reconciling the following year.\n\nDouglas opened up about the split and reconciliation during a 2015 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\n\"It can't be a one-way street,\" Douglas told host Ellen DeGeneres. \"But I'm crazy about her. And yeah, I think every couple has their difficult times. The only problem is, as you well know, we're all in the public eye, and it tends to get a little more exposed than most. We're back stronger than ever.\"\n\nHere's a timeline of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship through the years.\n\n1998: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones meet\n\nDouglas initially struck out when the pair met at the Deauville Film Festival in 1998. Zeta-Jones was promoting her film The Mask of Zorro and Douglas was promoting A Perfect Murder. During a 2016 appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, Douglas revealed that he'd seen Zeta-Jones in her role as Elena Montero and asked his publicist to arrange a meeting.\n\n\"I met her in the bar and was a total gentleman,\" Douglas said. He recalled asking her, \"By chance do you want to come back and have a nightcap?\" When Zeta-Jones met him later that night, he told her, \"You know, I'm going to be the father of your children.\"\n\nAccording to Douglas, she responded, \"You know I've heard a lot about you, and I've seen a lot about you, and I think it's time that I say goodnight.\" He thought he'd blown his shot with the actress, but he knew she was off to film Entrapment on a small island in Scotland, so he arranged to have roses waiting for her when she arrived.\n\n\"You know what the worst thing is?\" Zeta-Jones joked during a red carpet interview with Access in 2019. \"He was right.\" Two decades later, Zeta-Jones still has the card that was attached to those roses.\n\nDecember 1999: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones get engaged\n\nWhile on a New Year's Eve trip to Aspen, Colorado, Douglas proposed to the actress.\n\n2000: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are expecting their first baby together\n\nAfter rumors circulated that the newly-engaged couple were expecting a baby, Douglas confirmed the pregnancy news to PEOPLE. \"We obviously were hoping to hang onto this information a little longer than expected but, yep, Catherine's expecting, and both of us couldn't be happier,\" said the actor.\n\nAugust 8, 2000: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones welcome their first baby together\n\nRoughly two years after the pair met, Douglas and Zeta-Jones welcomed their first child together, son Dylan Douglas, on Aug. 8, 2000, in Los Angeles. \"They're ecstatic,\" Douglas' publicist said at the time.\n\nNovember 18, 2000: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones get married at New York's Plaza Hotel\n\nThe new parents tied the knot in an extravagant ceremony at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on Nov. 18, 2000. Plenty of celebrity guests attended the nuptials, including Tom Hanks, Whoopi Goldberg, Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Goldie Hawn.\n\nZeta-Jones wore a David Emanuel dress and Douglas' then-21-year-old son Cameron (from his previous marriage to Diandra Luker) served as the best man. The couple's then-3-month-old son Dylan was also in attendance.\n\nSeptember 2002: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are expecting their second baby\n\nZeta-Jones discovered she was pregnant with her and Douglas' second child toward the end of filming Intolerable Cruelty. \"I didn't want to know until I finished it,\" she told PEOPLE. \"The day after, I went to my doctor. I came home and told Michael. He let out a whoop. I never wanted Dylan to be an only child. Because of my amazing relationship with my siblings, I couldn't see him being the Little Lord Dylan on his own.\"\n\nMarch 23, 2003: Catherine Zeta-Jones thanks Michael Douglas in her Academy Award acceptance speech\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones attended the 75th annual Academy Awards on March 23, 2003, while the actress was pregnant with their second child.\n\nZeta-Jones performed \"I Move On,\" from the Chicago soundtrack with costar and fellow nominee Queen Latifah, and then went on to snag the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress her role as Velma Kelly in the hit musical.\n\n\"I mean my hormones are just way too out of control for me to be dealing with this,\" Zeta-Jones joked in her speech, before thanking her family. \"And to my son Dylan who is going to be watching at home, and to my husband who I love, I share this award with you.\"\n\nApril 20, 2003: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones welcome a baby girl\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child together, daughter Carys Zeta Douglas, on Easter Sunday in 2003.

But, you know, I have to check out on a monthly basis now to maintain.\"\n\nAfter his final cancer treatment, Douglas and Zeta-Jones took their children on a trip to Walt Disney World in Florida for Thanksgiving.\n\n\"All of a sudden the affection from my family, from my friends, and from my fans hit me at a much deeper level than I would have ever imagined before,\" the actor told Lauer. \"And it gave me a really new appreciation of just how valuable, how precious good friends are, and family.\"\n\n\"There's a much deeper feeling,\" he continued. \"And I've talked to other cancer survivors about this, that — that happens, that you just really, really appreciate what's important in life.\"\n\nAugust 2013: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones split\n\nAfter nearly 13 years of marriage, the couple announced their separation in August 2013.
