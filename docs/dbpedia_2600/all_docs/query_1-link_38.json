        "text": "Unless specifically exempted by law, every course for which State aid is claimed is fully open to any person who has been admitted to the college and who meets the appropriate academic prerequisites.\n\nHow to Enroll:\n\nFile an application online and receive an appointment to enroll.\n\nSee Register for Classes Online on page 16 for instruction on how to enroll online, or by coming to the college in person.\n\nIf you miss your registration appointment, you may still register for classes anytime AFTER your scheduled appointment.\n\nThe Los Angeles Community College District, in compliance with Federal and State law, has established policies and procedures governing student records and the control of personally identifiable information. The Los Angeles Community College District recognizes that student records are a confidential matter between the individual student and the college. At the same time, the District has a responsibility, to fulfill public information needs (i.e., information about students participating in athletics, announcements of scholarships and awards, etc.). To meet this responsibility the District may release Directory Information unless the student states in writing that he or she does not want it released. The responsibility for carrying out these provisions is charged to the college Records Officer, designated by the Chief Administrative Officer on each campus. The Records Officer may be contacted via the Admissions Office. Copies of the Federal and State laws and District policies and procedures are maintained by the Records Officer and are available for inspection and inquiry.\n\nAll student records maintained by the various offices and departments of the college, other than those specifically exempted by law, are open to inspection by the student concerned. The accuracy and appropriateness of the records may be challenged in writing to the Records Officer. A student has the right to receive a copy of his or her records, at a cost not to exceed the cost of reproduction. (Requests for transcripts should be made directly to the Admissions Office).\n\nNo student records, other than Directory Information, will be released without the written consent of the student concerned except as authorized by law. A log of persons and organizations requesting or receiving student record information is maintained by the Records Officer. The log is open to inspection only to the student and the community college official or his or her designee responsible for the maintenance of student records.\n\nDirectory Information includes the student's name, city of residence, date of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. Directory Information about any student currently attending the college may be released or withheld at the discretion of the Records Officer.\n\nNo Directory Information will be released regarding any student who has notified the Records Officer in writing that such information shall not be released.\n\nAll inquiries regarding student records, Directory Information, and policies for records access, release, and challenge should be directed to the Records Officer via the Admissions Office.\n\nStudents have the right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education concerning alleged violations of Federal and State laws governing student records.\n\nStudy Load Limitations\n\nMaximum unit requirements are as follows:\n\nFall/Spring Semesters\n\nThe maximum study load is 19 units during a regular semester. The normal class load for students in the Fall or Spring semester is 12 to 19 units a semester for full-time students. A college program of 15 units is equal to at least a 50-hour work week for most students.\n\nStudents who desire to take 20 or more units must obtain counselor approval after the semester begins by presenting a Permission Number & Attendance Verification Form signed by the instructor for each class they wish to add.\n\nThe maximum study load for a student who has been on academic and progress probation for two consecutive semesters is 6 units. Students who desire to enroll in more than 6 units must obtain counselor approval.\n\nSummer and Winter Sessions\n\nStudents are limited to a maximum study load of 9 units per session.\n\nTo enroll in two courses per session that total more than 9 units but do not exceed 10 units, students must go to the Admissions Office. No other enrollment unit requests will be considered until the session begins.\n\nStudents must see a counselor with a Permission Number and Attendance Verification Form signed by the instructor for each class they wish to add.\n\nEffective Summer 2012, course withdrawal (\"W\") will count in ways that all students need to know about.\n\nStudents who drop or are excluded after the last day to drop without a grade of \"W\" will have a \"W\" appear on their transcript. The \"W\" will count as an attempt for that course.\n\nA course on a student's transcript which shows a recorded \"W\" counts as an attempt for that course.\n\nStudents will not be allowed to register for any course within the LACCD if there are three recorded attempts for that course in any combination of W, D, F, or NP grades.\n\nAdds for a course within the LACCD will not be processed if there are three recorded attempts for that course in any combination of W, D, F, or NP grades.\n\nFor courses specifically designated as \"repeatable,\" students may repeat up to three times. (See Title 5 California Code of Regulations sections 55040, 55041, 58161).\n\nWhere the student's number of enrollments in a course exceeds the allowable amount, the student may petition for an additional enrollment in cases of extenuating circumstances. Use the Course Repetition Petition available in Admissions & Records.\n\nTitle 5, California Code of Regulations, limits a student from taking more than 30 units of \"remedial\" course work, which is defined as \"nondegree-applicable basic skills courses.\" The LACCD registration system will prevent students who have exceeded this limit from enrolling in additional basic skills courses. However, a student who has reached this limit, but enrolls in a credit or non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) course, will be allowed to also enroll in additional basic skills courses. Students with a learning disability may request an exemption through the Services for Students with Disabilities office (formerly DSPS). Also, this limitation does not apply to enrollment in non-credit basic skills course.\n\nPetitioning the 30-Unit Limit on Basic Skills Courses\n\nStudents may petition by submitting a General Petition to the Admissions Office. The petition must include a Student Educational Plan issued by a counselor.\n\nThe following courses are considered Basic Skills courses for purposes of this unit limitation:\n\nDevelopmental Communications 22A, 22B, 22C, 22D, 22E, 23, 35, 36A, and 36B.\n\nEnglish 67, and 68.\n\nLearning Skills 10ABC, 13, 40, 41 and 44.\n\nMath 100, 110 and 112.\n\nIt is essential that enrollment forms be completed accurately and carefully. While classes may be dropped any time before the end of the 11th week, “Permission Numbers” are processed online only through the published deadline. The Admissions Office requires a picture I.D. to process any program changes.\n\nSome of the classes offered may require students to provide those materials which are of continuing value to the student outside of the classroom setting. These materials may be purchased at the campus bookstore.\n\nThe only students who may attend classes are those who have been admitted to the college and are in approved active status.\n\nStudents are expected to attend every meeting of all classes for which they are registered. Violation of this regulation may result in exclusion from class as specified in Administrative Regulation E-13. Provisions of Administrative Regulation E-13 include the following:\n\nSTUDENTS WHO HAVE PREREGISTERED FOR A CLASS AND WHO DO NOT ATTEND THE FIRST MEETING OF THE CLASS FORFEIT THEIR RIGHT TO A PLACE IN THE CLASS. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED BY THE INSTRUCTOR.\n\nWhenever absences in hours exceed the number of hours the class meets per week, the instructor will consider whether there are mitigating circumstances which may justify the absences. If the instructor determines that such circumstances do not exist, the instructor may exclude the student from the class.\n\nThree cases of tardiness may be considered equivalent to one absence.\n\nIt is the student's responsibility to consult with an instructor regarding any absences that would alter the student's status in the class. Instructors may be reached by calling, emailing, or writing to the instructor at the college address. Contact information can be found on the course syllabus or in the College Directory.\n\nStudents may be permitted to audit a class under the following conditions:\n\nPayment of a nonrefundable $15 per unit fee. Students enrolled in classes to receive credit for 10 or more semester units shall not be charged a fee to audit three or fewer semester units per semester.\n\nNo student auditing a course shall be permitted to change his or her enrollment in that course to receive credit for the course.\n\nPriority in class enrollment shall be given to students desiring to take the class for credit.\n\nPermission in the form of a signed \"Add Permit\" marked \"Audit\" must be obtained from the instructor.\n\nThe fees are non-refundable and payment is due upon processing the audit form.\n\nTransferring from \"credit\" to \"Audit\" after the deadline to add is not permitted.\n\nAudit classes are not covered by Financial Aid.\n\nAfter you submit your online application, you will receive an email with directions on how to follow our matriculation process.\n\nYou will be given an appointment to register or classes\n\nYou may enroll in open classes by using the online student information system.\n\nTo add classes once the semester begins, you must obtain a Permission Number from the instructor of the class. Use the Permission Number to add classes online.\n\nNo semester courses may be added after the normal add period (published in the Schedule of Classes). Short-term and Open-Entry/Open-Exit classes have different add periods. Check with the Office of Admissions and Records for deadlines. Attending classes without being properly enrolled is not permitted.\n\nNew statewide regulations are now in effect that change the way students should think about enrolling in, and then withdrawing from, classes.\n\nCommunity colleges get their money from state apportionment. Apportionment is a set amount of dollars distributed to the college districts, based on enrollment. Each class you enroll in results in compensation to the college, and that is how the college stays open.\n\nA \"W\" counts as an attempt, and you only get three attempts at any one course.\n\nAfter that, the state won't pay the college for you to take the course again.\n\nWhat this means for LAVC students:\n\nIf you stay in a course past the “no penalty” withdrawal date and then drop or are excluded, you receive a grade of “W” and you have used one of your three attempts.\n\nWhen you have made three attempts at a class, with any combination of W, D, or F grades, you will not be able to register for the class again. You would have to try to take the class again at a college outside the Los Angeles Community College District.\n\nYou may petition for one more try citing “extenuating circumstances;” however, for the most part the only extenuating circumstances that will qualify are military deployment or natural disaster.\n\nIf your registration is blocked because of this rule, getting a Permission Number will not help.\n\nWhat you should do:\n\nIf you're going to drop, drop before the deadline so you won't get a \"W\".\n\nBe sure you're academically ready for classes you enroll in.\n\nSee a counselor to help you make good decisions about your educational plan.\n\nIt is the student's responsibility to withdraw officially. Consult the deadline calendar on the inside front cover of the Schedule of Classes.\n\nTHROUGH THE 2nd WEEK: No notation (\"W\" or other) will appear on the student's record if the class is dropped during the first two weeks of the semester.\n\nTHROUGH THE 11TH WEEK: A notation of \"W\" (withdrawal) is recorded on the student's record for classes dropped during the 3rd through the 11th week of the semester.\n\nAFTER THE 11TH WEEK: Students who remain in class beyond the 11th week (or 75% of the class for short term classes) are given a grade by the instructor. THAT GRADE CANNOT BE A \"W\" (withdrawal). Consult the deadline calendar in the Schedule of Classes or contact the Office of Admissions.\n\nStudents should refer to the class syllabus drop policy for courses that are less than 16 weeks.\n\nEnrollment in more than one section of the same course during a semester is not permitted.\n\nEnrollment in courses which are cross-referenced to each other (i.e., courses designated \"same as\" in the catalog) will be rejected by the computer.\n\nThe computer will also reject enrollment in classes scheduled or conducted during overlapping times.\n\nThe competency requirements for the Associate of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) Degrees are met by the following criteria.\n\nMathematics Competency\n\nThe competency requirement in mathematics for the Associate Degree may be met by completion of any of the following:\n\n1) Verification of passing with a grade of C or P or higher any course from a California Community College Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) Course Basic (CB) Code of “One Level Below Transfer” or higher with a TOP code beginning with 17.\n\n2) Verification of passing with a grade of C- or higher a mathematics course at or above the level of the course typically known as Intermediate Algebra or the equivalent from any United States regionally accredited secondary or post-secondary institution.\n\n3) Verification of passing with a grade of C or P or higher a California Community College course that meets the California State University General Education Breadth (CSUGE Breadth) requirement in Area B4: Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning and/or the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) in Area 2A: Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning.\n\n4) Achieving a satisfactory score (using a DAS-approved scoring-method) on a DAS-approved District Mathematics Competency Examination.\n\n5) Achieving a satisfactory score on an external examination (such as, but not limited to an Advanced Placement Exam) as specified in LACCD Administrative Regulations.\n\nWritten Expression Competency\n\nThe competency requirement in written expression for the Associate Degree may be met by completion of any of the following:\n\n1) Verification of passing with a grade of C or P or higher Freshman Composition from any California Community College or the equivalent from any United States regionally accredited institution with a grade of C- or higher.\n\n2) Verification of passing with a grade of C or P or higher a California Community College course that meets the California State University General Education Breadth (CSUGE Breadth) requirement in Area A2: Written Communication and/or the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) in Area 1A: English Composition.\n\n3) Achieving a satisfactory score on an external examination (such as, but not limited to an Advanced Placement Exam) as specified in LACCD Administrative Regulations.\n\nStudents who maintain continuous catalog rights (as defined in Board Rule 6203) may satisfy competency according to the requirements stated in college catalogs pursuant to relevant Board Rules and Administrative Regulations from the first term under those rights until the term all graduation requirements have been met or any intervening term.\n\nThe District Curriculum Committee shall establish whether the course meets the competency requirement as established in this administrative regulation.\n\nSome courses in the college catalog are eligible for credit by examination.\n\nMethod of obtaining credit by examination:\n\nSatisfactory completion of an examination written, administered and graded by the discipline faculty at the college in lieu of completion of a course listed on the approved list below (Courses Approved for Credit by Examination).\n\nDetermination of eligibility to take the examination\n\nThe student must be currently registered in the college and in good standing with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in any work attempted at the college.\n\nThe student must have completed 12 units within the L.A. Community College District, unless the petition is for a Career Technical Education course with an approved high school articulation agreement.\n\nThe course for which credit is requested must be listed on the approved list below (Courses Approved for Credit by Examination).\n\nThe student is not currently enrolled in, or has completed a more advanced course in the discipline.\n\nMaximum Credit Allowable and Limitations\n\nStudents may petition for a total of 15 units for credit by examination. A student who does not pass the exam for a course may not repeat the exam.\n\nCredits acquired by examination are not applicable to the meeting of such unit load requirements as Selective Service deferment, veterans' or Social Security benefits or scholastic honors.\n\nUnits for which credit is given shall not be counted in determining the 12 semester hours of credit in residence.\n\nA student who does not pass the exam for a course may not repeat the exam.\n\nFiling a Petition\n\nStudents must obtain a Credit by Examination card from the Admissions Office, complete it, and return it to the Admissions Office for verification of eligibility. After verification is complete, students must take the card to the appropriate department chairperson. The date and time of the examination are the responsibility of the department chair and/or faculty involved.

Each external exam follows distinct policies. Students who take an Advanced Placement (AP) Exam, and International Baccalaureate (IB) Exam or College-Level Examination (CLEP) Exam in the same topic area will receive credit for only one exam. The college will award credit for the exam that most benefits the student.\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) Exam Credit\n\nCourse equivalency for Advanced Placement exams, for purposes other than meeting general education and graduation competency requirements for the Associate Degree are described below. To be eligible to receive credit for Advanced Placement exams, the student must be enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College during the semester in which credit is to be granted. Advanced Placement exam scores must be 3 or higher in order to receive credit. Official AP score reports from the College Board must be sent directly to the Admissions Office.\n\nPlease refer to the LAVC Catalog (page 27) for a chart on how general education credit is earned for the IGETC general education plan requirements. Please refer to the LAVC Catalog (pages 32-24) for a chart on how general education credit is earned for CSU general education certification. Please refer to the LAVC Catalog (page 37-38) for a chart on how general education credit is earned for LAVC general education. The amount and type of transferable credit granted towards a university's admission or major requirements are determined by that university's AP policies and not by Los Angeles Valley College's policies; a university's policies often differ from Los Angeles Valley College's policies. See a counselor for further information. Credit acquired by AP exams is not applicable towards meeting unit load requirement of Veterans Administration benefits, Social Security benefits, or athletic eligibility.\n\nThe following is a list of course equivalencies for Advanced Placement exams. This course equivalency information is used for satisfying Associate Degree major or Certificate requirements.\n\nAP EXAM COURSE EQUIVALENCY Calculus AB Math 265 Calculus BC Math 265 Comparative Government & Politics Political Science 2 English Language English 101 English Literature Score of 3 or 4 English 101 Score of 5 English 101 + 102 Environmental Science Environmental Science 1 European History History 2 French Language French 4 French Literature French 4 German Language German 2 Human Geography Geography 2 Music Theory Music 201 Physics B Physics 6 & 7 Physics C (Mechanics) Physics 37 Psychology Psychology 1 Spanish Language Spanish 4 Spanish Literature Spanish 4 Statistics Statistics 101 U.S. Government & Politics Political Science 1 U.S. History History 11\n\n1. Course Equivalency\n\nCourse equivalency for CLEP (College-Level Examination Program) exams, purposes other than meeting General Education and Graduation Competency requirements for the Associate Degree, shall be determined by the college, using policies developed in consultation with the college's Academic Senate, in accordance with the provisions of LACCD Board Rules, Chapter XVIII, Article I.\n\nCourse equivalency does not award unit credit. For unit credit policy, see item 3 below.\n\n2. Use of CLEP exams for meeting LACCD General Education Requirements and Graduation Competency Requirements for the Associate Degrees\n\nStudents must receive a passing score (50) on most CLEP exams, except Foreign Language level 2 exams which require a higher score as noted on pages 41-43.\n\nStudents who take an Advanced Placement (AP) exam, an International Baccalaureate (IB) exam or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) exam in the same topic area will receive credit for only one exam. (For example, if a student takes both the CLEP exam in Biology and the AP exam in Biology, they will only be awarded credit for one exam because the topics are duplicative). The college should award credit for the exam that most benefits the student.\n\n3. CLEP Unit Credit\n\nFor the purpose of granting unit credit towards meeting General Education and Graduation Competency requirements, the LACCD shall follow the guidelines for CLEP credit set by the American Council on Education:\n\n3 semester hours recommended in the case of a half-year course.\n\n6 semester hours for most full-year courses.\n\n12 semester hours for Level 2 Foreign Language exams equivalent to four semesters of college level foreign language course work.\n\nFor information on how the CLEP exams apply toward the CSU Breadth GE, see pages 33-34.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate® (IB) Diploma Program is a challenging two-year curriculum, primarily aimed at students aged 16 to 19. The IB Diploma Program is a comprehensive and challenging pre-university course of study, leading to examinations that demand the best from motivated students and teachers.\n\nLos Angeles Valley College will grant units towards general education and/or the associate degree as describe in the chart on the LAVC Catalog (page 39). This chart also indicates the passing score required for each exam. A passing score on any one of the following exams fulfills the Reading and Written Expression Competency Requirement as required in Board Rule 6201.13: IB Language A1 (English) HL or IB Language A2 (English) HL. A passing score on the IB Mathematics HL Exam fulfills the Mathematics Competency Requirement as required in Board Rule 6201.13. Credit is only given for the Higher Level (HL) exams. No credit is given for Standard Level (SL) exams. For information on how IB credit is applied toward the CSU Breadth GE see the LAVC Catalog (page 30-34), and for IGETC GE see the LAVC Catalog (page 25-28).\n\nLos Angeles Valley College accepts degree-applicable coursework completed at other colleges for the purpose of satisfying the LACCD Associate Degree general education plan, graduation competency, and unit (elective) credit using the following guidelines*:\n\n1.

These courses will be noted in the college catalog as being eligible for the “pass-no pass” option.\n\nThe pass-no pass grading system shall be used in any course in which there is a single satisfactory standard of performance for which unit credit is assigned. A grade of Pass shall be assigned for meeting that standard (earning 70% or higher), and a grade of No Pass shall be assigned (earning a grade below 70%) for failure to do so.\n\nThe student who is enrolled in a course on a “pass-no pass” basis will be held responsible for all assignments and examinations required in the course and must meet the same standards of evaluation as required for all students.\n\nStudents considering taking courses for Pass/No Pass in their major field should see a Counselor or major field department chairperson in order to avoid loss of credit.\n\nThe courses listed below may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis providing the student meets the requirements for enrollment on this basis. Information concerning the requirements is available in the Admissions Office. In order to take a class on a Pass/No Pass basis the student must make such request in the Admissions Office by Friday of the 5th week of the semester.\n\nIn addition to courses designated Pass/No Pass Only (Ch Dev 172; Counsel 1; Dev Com 22A-E, 35; EDUC 385; English 67, 68, 69, 72, 75; LRNSKIL 40, 44; Math 100, Music 190, 191, 192; NRSCE 200-1, 200-2, 200-3, 200-4.) students may take only one class per semester on a requested Pass/No Pass basis.\n\nAdministration of Justice: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 39, 49, 185, 285, 385\n\nAfrican American Studies: 20\n\nArchitecture: 173, 221, 271\n\nAnthropology: 101, 104, 111,116, 121, 385\n\nArt: 102, 103,109, 112, 115, 116, 201, 501\n\nAstronomy: 1 & 5\n\nBroadcasting: 3, 25, 28, 31, 45, 46, 47\n\nBusiness: 32 & 38\n\nCAOT: 2, 9, 31, 32, 47, 78, 82, 84, 85, 86, 92, 97, 108, 123, 124, 185, 385.\n\nChicano Studies: 2, 7, 8, 37, 42, 44, 54\n\nChild Development: 29, 30, 31, 34, 36, 37, 39, 42, 47, 48, 53\n\nCinema: (non majors only) 104, 105, 106, 107\n\nCommunication Studies:102, 185, 285, 385\n\nDance Specialties: 161, 171, 172, 173, 174, 331, 332, 333, 334, 441, 442, 443, 444\n\nDance Studies: 185, 285, 301, 302, 801, 805, 814, 815, 816, 820, 822\n\nDance Techniques: 111, 112, 113, 114, 121, 122, 123, 124, 141, 142, 143, 144, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 231, 232, 233, 234, 437\n\nEconomics: 8, 50\n\nEducation: 2\n\nEngineering, General: 101, 131, 151\n\nEnglish: 102, 105, 124, 125, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 385\n\nEnvironmental Science: 7 & 22\n\nEnvironmental Studies: 101\n\nFinance: 2\n\nFire Technology: 27, 96, 185, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 285, 385\n\nFrench: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 21, 22, 25, 66, 185, 285, 385, 008-1, 008-2\n\nGeography: 1, 2, 3, 9, 14, 15, 17, 30, 45\n\nGeology: 1, 2, 7\n\nGerman: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 63, 64, 66, 185, 285, 385\n\nHealth: 3\n\nHebrew: 1, 2, 10, 385\n\nHistory: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7\n\nHumanities: 1\n\nItalian: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 185, 285, 385\n\nJewish Studies: 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 25, 27, 35\n\nJournalism: 101, 105\n\nKinesiology: 8, 45, 46, 47, 49, 217-1, 217-2, 237-1, 268-1, 287-1, 301-1, 303-1, 315-1, 315-2, 317-2, 326-1, 326-2, 329-1, 350-1, 350-2, 350-3, 350-4, 364-1, 364-2, 369-1, 369-2, 370-1, 370-2, 370-3, 370-4, 371-1, 371-2, 371-3, 371-4, 374-1,374-2, 387-1, 387-2, 387-3, 387-4, 389-1, 389-2, 391-1\n\nLaw: 2 & 3\n\nLearning Skills: 41\n\nLinguistics: 1\n\nManagement: 13\n\nMarketing: 1, 21, 31\n\nMathematics: 120, 122, 185, 245, 260, 261, 263, 265, 267, 270, 275, 285, 385\n\nMeteorology: 3\n\nMusic: 118, 136, 141\n\nOceanography: 1Philosophy: 1, 6, 9, 12, 14, 20, 28, 30, 35, 45\n\nPolitical Science: 1 & 5\n\nPsychology: 12, 14, 17, 32, 52, 60, 75, 90\n\nReal Estate: 5, 7, 9, 21\n\nRecreation: 81\n\nSociology: 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20, 21, 25, 31, 35, 84\n\nSpanish: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 25, 27, 35, 36, 48, 66, 185, 285, 385\n\nTheater: 100\n\n(List subject to change)\n\nNOTE: A STUDENT WHO HAS RECEIVED A GRADE OF \"PASS\" FOR A COURSE TAKEN ON A PASS/NO PASS BASIS MAY NOT CONVERT THE \"PASS\" GRADE TO A LETTER GRADE.\n\nPass/No Pass Option for Spring 2020\n\nFor the Spring 2020 term, the LACCD will lift the restriction on the number of courses/units students can take for Pass/No Pass. Additionally, these courses will not count towards the maximum number of P/NP limits one may apply to a certificate or degree, including major courses.\n\nAll classes can be taken either Graded or as Pass/No Pass. Courses that are already designated locally as Pass/No Pass only will remain Pass/No Pass only. Per title 5 section 55023, a Pass means \"at least satisfactory,\" and a grade of Pass shall be equivalent to earning a letter grade of C or higher.\n\nThe deadline to petition for a grade basis change (i.e., Graded to Pass/No Pass) is the last day to drop with a W/EW for the course.\n\nFor courses taken this term as a replacement/repeat of a previously-graded course may be taken Pass/No Pass. (Note that a grade of “Pass” will replace a previous grade, while a grade of “No Pass” will not replace a previous grade.) The previous grade GPA will not be counted towards the student’s cumulative GPA if replaced with the Pass grade.\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to speak with a Counselor to discuss their options for taking a course Pass/No Pass and the impact it may have on their academic standing, admissions, financial aid, and transfer to a CSU, UC or private universities.\n\nMost transfer institutions do not compute a GPA for a Pass/No Pass course; however, in some instances a passing grade is computed at a 2.0 level, potentially adversely affecting a student’s overall GPA score.\n\nPrivate and out-of-state universities have different policies on use of Pass/No Pass.\n\nMost transfer institutions—including CSU, UC, and graduate or professional schools—require courses for the major to be completed with a letter grade. A Pass grade may result in a student needing to retake a course either before or after transfer.\n\nThe UC has waived the limitation on total number of units allowable by Pass/No Pass, but has not waived requirements for local transfer requirements or major courses to be taken by letter grade.\n\nA transfer, professional or graduate institution may restrict the allowable transfer units taken as Pass/No Pass. Nursing program course prerequisites may require a letter grade.\n\nTo chat with an Academic Counselor or an Admission’s representative, click on the “Online Counseling & Live Chat” tile on your MyCollege.laccd.edu student homepage.\n\nTo execute a Pass/No Pass grading option, complete the Pass/No Pass Petition, and return the form from your District email address (Student.laccd.edu) to LA Valley College at @email. If you are unable to scan and return the document with your handwritten signature; type your name in the signature line instead.\n\nThe instructor on record for the course shall determine the grade to be awarded to each student The determination of the student’s grade by the instructor is final in the absence of mistake, fraud, bad faith, or incompetency. For purposes of this section, “mistake” may include, but is not limited to, clerical errors and errors made by an instructor in calculating a student’s grade. The removal or change of an incorrect grade from a students record shall be done only upon authorization by the instructor of record for the course, or upon authorization by the College President upon the conclusion of the grade grievance process.\n\nIn the case of fraud, bad faith, or incompetency, the final determination concerning removal or change of grade will be made by the College President.\n\nNo grade may be challenged by a student more than one year from the end of the term in which the course was taken, absent extenuating circumstances; if a college’s academic senate has determined that extenuating circumstances apply, then that period of time during which grades may be challenged should be more than one year, such longer period shall apply at that college.\n\nIn the case of fraud or incompetence, the final determination concerning removal or change of grade will be made by the College President.\n\n(LACCD Board Rule 6700)\n\nOnly the symbols in the grading scale given in this section shall be used to grade all courses.\n\nGrades shall be averaged on the basis of the point equivalencies to determine a student's grade point average, using the following evaluative symbols:\n\nSYMBOL DEFINITION GRADE POINT A Excellent 4 B Good 3 C Satisfactory 2 D Less than satisfactory 1 F Failing 0 P Pass (At least satisfactory – units awarded not counted in GPA. Has the same meaning as “CR” as that symbol was defined prior to June 30, 2007.) Applies to credit and noncredit courses. SP Satisfactory Progress towards completion of the course (used for noncredit courses only and is not supplanted by any other symbol) NP No Pass (Less than satisfactory – units awarded but not counted in GPA. NP has the same meaning as “NC” as that symbol was defined prior to June 30, 2007.) Applies to credit and noncredit courses. (P and NP grades may be given only in courses authorized by the Districts Pass/No Pass Option and Credit By Examination Policies.)\n\nThe following non-evaluative symbols may be entered on a students record:\n\nSYMBOL DEFINITION I Incomplete Incomplete academic work for unforeseeable, emergency, and justifiable reasons at the end of the term may result in an \"I\" symbol being entered in the student's record. The condition for removal of the \"I\" and the grade which is assigned in lieu of shall be stated by the instructor in an Incomplete Grade Record.\n\nThis record shall be given to the student, with a copy on file in the college Admissions Office until the \"I\" is made up and a final grade assigned, or when one year has passed. The \"I\" symbol shall not be used in calculating units attempted nor for grade points. The \"I\" may be made up no later than one year following the end of the term in which it was assigned. The student may petition for a time extension due to unusual circumstances.\n\nSYMBOL DEFINITION IP In Progress The \"IP\" symbol shall be used only in those courses which extend beyond the normal end of an academic term. It indicates that work is \"in progress,\" but that assignment of a grade must await the course completion. The \"IP\" symbol shall remain on the student's permanent record in order to satisfy enrollment documentation. The appropriate evaluative grade and unit credit shall be assigned and appear on the student's record for the term in which the required work of the course is completed. The \"IP\" shall not be used in calculating grade point averages.\n\nSYMBOL DEFINITION MW Military Withdrawal The MW symbol may be used to denote military withdrawal. “Military Withdrawal” occurs when a student who is a member of an active or reserve United States military service receives orders compelling a withdrawal from courses. Upon verification of such orders, a withdrawal symbol may be assigned at any time after the period established by the governing board during which no notation is made for withdrawals. The withdrawal symbol so assigned shall be a “MW.” Military withdrawals shall not be counted in progress probation and dismissal calculations. “MW” shall not be counted for the permitted number of withdrawals. The District shall refund the entire enrollment fee unless academic credit has been awarded. SYMBOL DEFINITION W Withdrawal Withdrawal from a class or classes shall be authorized through the last day of the fourteenth week of instruction or 75% of the time the class is scheduled to meet whichever is less. No notation (\"W\" or other) shall be made on the record of a student who withdraws before the census date of the course. Withdrawal between the end of the fourth week (or 30% of the time the class is scheduled to meet, whichever is less) and the last day of the fourteenth week of instruction (or 75% of the time the class is scheduled to meet, whichever is less) shall be authorized after informing the appropriate faculty. A student who remains in class beyond the fourteenth week or 75% of the time the class is scheduled shall be given a grade other than a \"W\", except in cases of extenuating circumstances. After the last day of the fourteenth week (or 75% of the time the class is scheduled, whichever is less) the student may withdraw from class upon petition demonstrating extenuating circumstances and after consultation with the appropriate faculty. Extenuating circumstances are verified cases of accidents, illness, or other circumstances beyond the control of the student. Withdrawal after the end of the fourteenth week (or 75% of the time the class is scheduled, whichever is less) which has been authorized in extenuating circumstances shall be recorded as a \"W\". For purposes of withdrawal policies, the term \"appropriate faculty\" means the Instructor of Record for each course in question or, in the event the instructor cannot be contacted, the department chair or equivalent faculty officer. The \"W\" shall not be used in calculating units attempted nor for the student's grade point average. \"W's\" will be used as factors in progress probation and dismissal. A “W” shall not be assigned, or if assigned shall be removed, from a student’s academic record, if a determination is made that the student withdrew from the course due to discriminatory treatment or due to retaliation for alleging discriminatory treatment or that the student withdrew because he or she reasonably believed that remaining in the course would subject him or her to discriminatory treatment or retaliation for alleging discriminatory treatment. A student may not withdraw and receive a “W” symbol on his or her record more than three times for enrollment in the same course. A student may enroll again in the same course after having previously received the authorized number of “W” symbols in the same course, if a designated college official approves such enrollment after review of a petition filed by a student.\n\nSYMBOL DEFINITION RD Report Delayed The \"RD\" symbol may be assigned when there is a delay in reporting the grade beyond the control of the student. The \"RD\" may be assigned by the Dean of Student Services only. It is a temporary notation to be replaced by a permanent symbol as soon as possible.\n\nAccess Grades Online\n\nFollow the steps below:\n\nGo to the LAVC homepage and click on Register. This will take you to the new Student Information System (SIS) where you can register for classes and view grades.\n\nEnter your Student ID Number and Password to login\n\nGo to the Action Menus and select View My Grades\n\nGrading Standard\n\nA course grade of “C minus” does not satisfy the “C or better” requirement for purposes of prerequisites, competencies or transfer to UC or CSU.\n\nCertain courses in the catalog may be repeated for additional unit credit. These courses, marked RPT in the course description section of the catalog and in the schedule of classes, allow the student an expanded educational experience each time the student enrolls in the course.\n\nEffective Fall 2013, students enrolled in \"active participation courses\" in physical education (kinesiology), visual arts, or performing arts are limited to 4 enrollments per \"family\" group within the LA Community College District. All grades including withdrawals count as enrollments.\n\nEven if a family contains multiple courses, a student can only take 4 of them. This applies to courses in the areas of Music, Art, Dance Specialties, Dance Techniques, Kinesiology (Physical Education), and Theater. Not all courses listed below are offered at Los Angeles Valley College but are offered at other colleges in the LA district. Note that courses within a family may be \"leveled.\" That means, for example, beginning, intermediate, and advanced courses. Students still are limited to no more than 4 enrollments within the family group. For example, Kinesiology 251 has four levels: KIN 251-1, 251-2, 251-3, and 251-4. You could enroll once in each level. However, if you enrolled in KIN 251-1 twice (due to withdrawal or substandard grade) you effectively will have no opportunity to take KIN 251-4. Additions are made to the list on an ongoing basis as new curriculum is developed.\n\nArt Family group (9 families) 1. Ceramics - A01 Art 708-714 2. Design - A02 Art 501-505, 520 3.

Should circumstances develop which justify a student's requesting a special examination at a time other than scheduled, the student must secure permission from the instructor.\n\nStudents expecting to graduate from the college with an Associate degree must file a petition for graduation early in the semester BEFORE they expect to complete their requirements. The deadlines for filing each semester are listed in the front of the Schedule of Classes. The Admissions Office in the Student Services Center building has the necessary forms.

All proceedings held in accordance with these Board Rules shall relate to the alleged violation of appropriate standards of student conduct. Discipline measures may be taken by the college independently of any charges filed through civil or criminal authorities, or both.
