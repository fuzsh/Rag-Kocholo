        "text": "Are you ready to get started in learning the ropes of Call of Duty: Warzone? Before jumping into a match there are a handful of tasks it’s recommended that you complete. You should build your Loadout and fine tune your settings, but you’ll also need to know what you’re building your Loadout for, exactly. There are four different modes of Call of Duty: Warzone: Bootcamp, Battle Royale, Resurgence, Plunder, and Lockdown\n\nAvailable on: Urzikstan (Player Count: 44, up to 20 Players, 24 Bots).\n\nRefine your Call of Duty: Warzone tactics in a new training mode set on a randomized slice of Urzikstan. Expanding on the Modern Warfare III “Training Course,” which launched in Season 2, the all-new Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp is designed to help new players build confidence for their first official drop-in.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp is a Quad-only training mode (either partied up or fill-squad) providing players a snapshot of the real-deal Call of Duty: Warzone experience, featuring up to 20 players via mode-specific matchmaking and 24 bots to test their mettle. Warzone Bootcamp is the only mode for Call of Duty: Warzone featuring bots. If this changes in the future, we’ll ensure the community is informed ahead of time.\n\nPlayer, Weapon, and Battle Pass XP progression is limited in Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp. The new training mode will not progress Daily/Weekly Challenges, Calling Card Challenges, Weapon Challenges, or Champion’s Quest. Additionally, the new training mode will not feature public events or advanced contracts.\n\nDrop in, learn the ropes, and get ready to take on the world.\n\nBattle Royale is the classic Call of Duty: Warzone experience with a high risk/reward bottom line that allows you and your Squad one full round of life, which will be explained later, and ends with one winner. Battle Royale takes place on the new big map, Urzikstan.\n\nResurgence is a little more lenient on members of your Squad being eliminated because as long as someone in your Squad is still alive, you can redeploy back into the fight after a timer. That is until the resurgence timer is up, then free redeployment becomes impossible for the rest of the game. Normally taking place on a smaller map, Resurgence can be significantly more intense, but it is just as rewarding as Battle Royale and will also end when there is only one Operator or Squad left alive on the map. Resurgence takes place on Vondel, Ashika, Fortune’s Keep, Rebirth Island, and sometimes Urzikstan.\n\nPlunder is a squad-based, respawn-enabled mode where Cash is king. The squad that collects the most Cash after a set time limit, including an overtime period once a squad hits $2 million in Cash, wins the match. Cash is earned by eliminating players and picking up their valuables, scavenging for loose Cash, and completing Contracts and in-game events. Operators can equip a custom Loadout from the start and can redeploy after being eliminated throughout the whole match.\n\nLockdown comes to Rebirth Island with multiple squads tasked to capture and control zones across the map, scoring points for each zone successfully held, like a large-scale Battle Royale version of Hardpoint. Total player count is adjusted due to the smaller nature of the map, allowing for balanced, but chaotic combat: Drop in with your favorite Custom Loadout – or bring a new weapon you’re wanting to quickly level up – and learn the new rotations so your team occupies as many zones as possible, accruing more points to ensure victory, rather than being the last squad standing. Respawns are active, and towards the end of a match, so are High-Value Zones that offer the chance for greater point acquisition, as well as the fiercest fighting yet experienced in this mode!\n\nThe Bootcamp, Battle Royale, Resurgence, Plunder, and Lockdown modes provide an experience like no other. No matter your style of play, there is room for everything in Call of Duty: Warzone and as long as you’re playing your best game, you always have a chance at success.\n\nAs the first mobile POI that Call of Duty: Warzone has ever seen, The Drivable Train is a completely interactable and moving Point of Interest that can almost always be guaranteed to be a hot spot at the beginning of a match. Players can affect the movement of The Train by starting and stopping it via the engine. Additionally, the caboose has a handbrake that can bring the train to a full stop which is useful for an attacking squad attempting to cease control from another squad controlling it.. Once you’re on the Train, you can run to either end and flip the lever to stop it, but remember that you can only restart the train from the front.. With this power, you can keep you and your squad inside of the safe zone and out of the gas while keeping control of an advantageous position. You may have to travel through some gas, depending on how it moves and where the railroad takes you. Navigating the strategy of when to start and stop the Train may take some practice and a bit of bravery, but once you’ve mastered the timing, this POI can be the key to your success.\n\nHorizontal Ziplines\n\nHorizontal Ziplines are strategically placed all around Urzikstan and provide Call of Duty: Warzone players with a new movement mechanic that will be useful for players attempting to get across large, exposed areas quickly. Using Horizontal Ziplines as a means to rotate around your enemy quickly and attack their flank should be used whenever possible. Just remember to drop from the zipline if you’ve been spotted because committing to the zip can make you an easy target.\n\nBuy Stations are the only spots where you can spend your Cash in Urzikstan. Due to this, they have a significant chance to have enemy players nearby. Indicated by the Shopping Cart on the map, Buy Stations are where you can buy items like Armor Plates, Killstreaks, loadout weapons and perks. Some of these items you can find by looting Supply Boxes, however they can be rare so a Buy Station is where you can guarantee you’re equipped with a proper setup so long as you have the Cash.\n\nTip: Look for an deployable Buy Station, which is a Buy Station that you can call in at any point during a match. This is a safer way to use a Buy Station but remember that you cannot pick it back up once it has been deployed and there’s always the possibility that another squad shoots it down before it arrives, claiming it for themselves.\n\nRedeploying Teammates\n\nWhen your teammate is eliminated for the first time, they do get the chance to earn their way back via The Gulag, however if they do lose their 1v1 fight or have been eliminated before, they will have to be redeployed. To redeploy your teammate, you must find a Buy Station, indicated on the map by a Shopping Cart, and purchase the redeployment for each individual teammate that had been eliminated. It can get expensive, so be sure to collect as much Cash as possible.\n\nIf you have played Call of Duty multiplayer, you may be familiar with the general idea of how a Loadout is setup. In Call of Duty: Warzone Loadouts are slightly different, both in how they’re setup as well as how to equip them. Before loading into a match, you can select the “Weapons” tab at the top of your screen to set up custom Loadouts. Create a few based on what you’d like to use in a few different situations. For instance, in the early game you may want something that’s a little more long ranged and can pick targets from a safe distance. However, in the later portion of a Call of Duty: Warzone match, you might want something built for a bit of close quarters combat due to the gas shrinking the playable area. You also have the option of setting up a Loadout that you’ll want to use for the entire length of a match because it’s less risky than attempting to buy and collect multiple Loadouts in a single match. Below are some Loadout suggestions that can help you get started.\n\nEvery Loadout consists of the following:\n\nPerk Package\n\nPrimary and Secondary Weapon\n\nTactical and Lethal Equipment\n\nPrimary and Secondary Weapons: Pick from any MWII or MWIII armament, from the pool of 114 existing weapons and their coresponding attachments. .\n\nTacticals and Lethals: Offering a similar selection to MWIII Multiplayer, your choices are as follows:\n\nTacticals: Stun Grenade, Battle Rage, Smoke Grenade, Scatter Mine, Decoy Grenade, Flash Grenade, Snapshot Grenade, Shock Stick, Stim, Experimental Gas, and EMD Grenade.\n\nLethals: Proximity Mine, Drill Charge, Molotov Cocktail, Semtex, C4, Throwing Star, Breacher Drone, Frag Grenade, Claymore, Throwing Knife, Thermite, and Thermobaric Grenade.\n\nLoadout Suggestions\n\n1: Early Game Scout\n\nPrimary Weapon: Longbow Sniper Rifle\n\nSecondary Weapon: Holger 556 Assault Rifle\n\nTactical: Snapshot Grenade\n\nLethal: Breacher Drone\n\nPerk Package: Double Time, Focus, Cold-Blooded, Combat Scout\n\nWhile other Sniper Rifles may inflict more damage per hit, the Longbow’s large ammo capacity makes it a worthy choice in any match. Pair it with the Holger 556 for dealing with enemies in the mid-range, complimented by the Snapshot Grenade for pinpointing enemy positions in tight spaces, and the Breacher Drone for a long-ranged explosive option.\n\nFor Perks, Double Time helps you move to new vantage points more quickly, Focus keeps you on target under fire in addition to providing more Hold Breath time when aiming in with the Longbow, Cold-Blooded makes it more difficult for enemies to discover your location, and Combat Scout marks enemies for you and your squad after hitting them.\n\n2: Vanguard Operator\n\nPrimary Weapon: MCW Assault Rifle\n\nSecondary Weapon: Rival-9 SMG\n\nTactical: Stun Grenade\n\nLethal: Frag Grenade\n\nPerk Package: Battle Hardened, E.O.D., Quick Fix, High Alert\n\nA good one for the aggressive players, this Loadout focuses on inflicting damage in close- to mid-ranged combat by pairing together an Assault Rifle and SMG. Use your Stun to disorient enemies and cook the Frag before tossing for a better chance to catch them in the explosion.\n\nBalancing the aggressive weapons and equipment in this Loadout is a Perk Package full of defensive abilities. Pair Battle Hardened and E.O.D. to reduce the effects of enemy equipment, grab Quick Fix to heal up after eliminating an enemy or inserting an Armor Plate, and High Alert as a means to react to enemies who have you in their sights.\n\n3: Heavy Support\n\nPrimary Weapon: Pulemyot 762 LMG\n\nSecondary Weapon: RGL-80 Launcher\n\nTactical: Smoke Grenade\n\nLethal: C4\n\nPerk Package: Shrapnel, Spotter, Resupply, Birdseye\n\nThis Loadout is all about dealing heavy damage and supporting your squad. The Pulemyot LMG boasts high damage and a large ammo capacity for dealing with enemy Operators and vehicles alike, with extra explosive support from the RGL-80 Launcher. Deploy the Smoke Grenade to set a distraction for attacking or escaping, and plant traps with the C4.\n\nBoost the effectiveness of your explosive attacks using Shrapnel, locate entrenched enemies using Spotter, recharge your equipment for multiple uses via Resupply, and improve your UAV capabilities with Birdseye including the ability to track players using the Ghost Perk.\n\n4: Mobile Warrior\n\nPrimary Weapon: Striker SMG\n\nSecondary Weapon: Lockwood 680 Shotgun\n\nTactical: Experimental Gas\n\nLethal: Stim\n\nPerk Package: Double Time, Sleight of Hand, Stalker, Ghost\n\nWhen speed is everything, try this Loadout. The combination of an SMG and Shotgun requires that you get up close to your enemy, making this setup deadlier as your map knowledge and movement skills improve. Disorient enemies with the Experimental Gas and use the Stim to heal back up in a tough fight and to gain a quick burst of movement speed.\n\nFor Perks, equip Double Time to close the distance more quickly, Sleight of Hand to minimize downtime during fights, Stalker to improve your strafing and ADS movement speed, and Ghost to reduce the chances of being spotted while engaged in a flanking movement.\n\n5: Late Game Finisher\n\nPrimary Weapon: BAS-B Battle Rifle\n\nSecondary Weapon: KATT-AMR\n\nTactical: Stim\n\nLethal: Molotov Cocktail\n\nPerk Package: E.O.D., Sleight of Hand, Tempered, High Alert\n\nFor our late game Loadout suggestion, we’re going with a Battle Rifle and Assault Rifle pairing. This combination has great versatility for handling a variety of situations. Top it off with Stim to counter a losing battle, and the Molotov Cocktail for area denial.\n\nYour Perks offer a variety of benefits. Use E.O.D. for greater protection against incoming grenades, Sleight of Hand to keep your weapon topped off in the final moments of the match, Tempered to armor up more quickly, and High Alert to reduce the chances of being caught unaware in a flank attack.\n\nPerks\n\nUnlike MWIII Multiplayer, Call of Duty: Warzone Perks work as Packages, where you can choose a selection of Perks to run after placing them into one of four slots, all of which become active once the Loadout with said Perk Package has been claimed. There are Custom Packages (where you can choose your Perks), or Preset Packages. The available perks and the slots that they are compatible with are as follows:"
