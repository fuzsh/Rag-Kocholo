Service members who engage in demolition using live explosives objects, obstacles, or other explosives, or recovering and rendering harmless, by disarming or demolishing, explosives that have failed to function as intended or which have become a potential hazard, under competent orders and as a primary duty assignment (such as explosive ordnance disposal personnel assigned to an explosive ordnance disposal billet) at least one time during the calendar month may receive a payment up to $150 for each qualifying month.\n\nExperimental Stress Duty - The Secretary concerned may pay HDIP to a Service member on active duty that is required by competent orders to perform experimental stress duty under the conditions stated below:\n\nHuman Acceleration or Deceleration Experimental Subject.
