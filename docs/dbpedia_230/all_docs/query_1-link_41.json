Want to help improve documentation? Have ideas for improvements?\n\nJoin the development on GitHub\n\nJoining existing games is usually easy.\n\nStart the game, click Multi Player → Join Game → Lobby.\n\nIf any games are available, you will be able to click and join. Then tick the “ready” box. When everybody checks “ready\", the game starts.\n\nDon’t forget to choose your name by clicking on the name box on the left.\n\nIt depends on your platform:\n\nOn Windows:\n\nThe directory Warzone 2100 Project\\Warzone 2100 <version> is located under the %APPDATA% folder.\n\nHence, the default path for the Warzone 2100 configuration data on Windows Vista+ would be: C:\\Users\\$USER$\\AppData\\Roaming\\Warzone 2100 Project\\Warzone 2100 <version>\\\n\nBy default, the %APPDATA% folder is hidden. Entering: %APPDATA%\\Warzone 2100 Project\\ into the address bar of Windows Explorer / File Explorer will browse to your Warzone directory.\n\nOn macOS:\n\nThe directory Warzone 2100 <version> can be found in your home-directory at: ~/Library/Application Support/\n\nBy default, recent version of macOS hide your account’s Library folder. To view it in Finder, hold down the Option (⌥) key while clicking the Go menu, and your Library folder will appear as a menu choice.\n\nOn Linux:\n\nUnder GNU/Linux, Warzone 2100 conforms to the XDG base directory spec.\n\nBy default, the directory warzone2100-<version> can be found in your home-directory under the path ~/.local/share/. (If the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable is defined, the Warzone folder will be located within $XDG_DATA_HOME.)\n\nThe leading dot in the .local part of the path indicates that it is a hidden directory, so depending on your configuration you may not be able to see it. However, you can still access it by typing the path into your address-bar."
