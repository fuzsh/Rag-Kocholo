        "text": "Amidst a moment of intensified global conflict, disabled people in war zones around the world face devastating challenges that are too often ignored or invisibilized.\n\nAs a child, Mercer University math professor Hani Khoury remembers when Israeli soldiers searched his school building for classmates who had thrown rocks at them in 1981.\n\n“Stand up, you animal,’” he recalled one commanding him.\n\nHowever, Khoury couldn’t comply because he was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a disorder that impacts motor neurons, thus weakening muscles. “It would have taken me 10 minutes to stand up,” Khoury said. “One of the soldiers ...slapped me in my face. He said ‘I told you to stand up, you animal.’”\n\nIn war zones like the Gaza Strip, many people become physically disabled due to violence, and those already physically disabled are often the targets of military forces. War disproportionately impacts people with disabilities, who are often left behind during evacuations, denied access to food and water, and targeted for violence. The physical and emotional trauma created by violent conflict further compounds the existing inequalities faced by disabled communities around the world.\n\nInaccessible environments, lack of basic services\n\nMarice Roth is the Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer at the World Institute on Disability, the oldest known disability justice organization in the world. She says that oftentimes disabled people are left behind when it comes to the billions of dollars in U.S. aid sent to war zones annually.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has sent a reported $12 billion to aid Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. Still, many reports indicate that some 3 million Ukrainians living with disabilities remain underserved.\n\n“People can’t get into the bomb shelters because they’re not accessible,” said Roth. “There were many people who were trapped in their homes.”\n\nBeyond physical disabilities, war disproportionately affects people with intellectual disabilities. An estimated 4,000 elderly Ukrainians with neurodivergence, have been forcibly institutionalized since the war began.\n\nElkhansa Fahad is a drawer, sculptor and activist in Sudan. Having lost her hands to a blood clot at age three, she leads with Action on Disability and Development International (ADD) to advocate for the rights of disabled Sudanese people. Displaced by violence, Fahad’s work involves centers on disability justice, despite discrimination in her community. “Millions of people with disabilities have become displaced,” she says. “Including those who are moving between safe States.”\n\nThe intensified military conflict in Sudan has led to the displacement of 3.3 million people since April of 2023, and has left the approximately six percent of Sudanese citizens with disabilities to fend for themselves.\n\nInternational neglect, local consequences\n\nWhen he was 16, Khoury’s family in The West Bank applied for a tax exemption under Israeli law to buy him a mobility device.\n\n“The first thing they asked was ‘what have you done to the State of Israel for us to grant you that exemption?’” When Khoury’s father couldn’t answer, they were denied. “[The officer] tore the application up right in front of him.”\n\nWhile Khoury says he has seen improvements in the West Bank for disability justice after being gone for 35 years, such as included portable ramps, some parking spots, and people using motorized wheelchairs, systemic inequities under what many advocates call a system of apartheid have translated to inaccessible buildings and public transportation.\n\nNowadays, activists like Lafi Melo, a Palestinian-American visual artist and educator with a blood disorder and a growth hormone deficiency, have different perspectives on disability than in Khoury’s time, when he said it was taboo. “Amputations are considered partial martyrdom,” Melo said. “In our community, we often say ‘your limb[s] preceded you to heaven.’”\n\nDuring the 2018 Great March of Return–a series of protests where over 10,000 people marched along the fences blocking the Gaza Strip and Israel to demand an end to the Israeli blockade–human rights organizations accused the Israeli Defense Forces of specifically targeting protestors’ legs. Over 6,392 people were struck in the lower limbs resulting in life-altering injuries, and in some cases paralysis or amputation.\n\n“We are seen as threatening, regardless of our abilities,” said Melo. “Only when the standard is death and destruction are we seen as equals.”\n\nFollowing Hamas’ Oct. 7th attack on Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) instructed citizens of Gaza to evacuate south to seek safety from a bombing campaign that has led to the death of over 17,000 Palestinians. Even as Palestinians evacuated south, Israel has bombed that area.\n\nMelo recalled a client who needed at least thirty minutes to get into her wheelchair. “There would be no way to get her out in time. My choices would be to either leave her behind or stay. I would choose to stay.”\n\nThis kind of systemic violence and neglect also impacts people like Jacob, a resident of Beirut.\n\nJacob, who has chosen to use a pseudonym for safety reasons, developed muscular dystrophy over time. They say that the impact of the 2020 explosion in the Port of Beirut, which killed over 200 people, continues to affect the city’s economy and infrastructure to this day.\n\nIn Beirut, Jacob and other residents do not have electricity twenty-four hours a day, which means that they have limited access to elevators and power for their electric wheelchair. “I’ve been through an evacuation before in 2006,” they said, referring to the Israel-Hezbollah war. “That was a horrible experience.”\n\nFearing war’s return to Beirut, Jacob, who is a U.S. dual citizen, asked the embassy for help. They offered a loan of $2,000 for the plane ticket.\n\n“Once I get to the States, I’m on my own,” said Jacob, who is currently unemployed. “That was really discouraging.” Like an alarming number of disabled people around the world, Jacob is unemployed.\n\nRoth also noted a similar lack of support for disabled people in Haiti and other places, where recent political crises have set the country in turmoil since 2018. Whether people are asked to shelter in place, access to bomb shelters, use humanitarian corridors or designated passages out of war zones, accessibility is a global challenge.\n\n“[Disabled people] don’t have access to the information they need in accessible formats.” she said. “Deaf people have had difficulty getting actionable information. People who are blind, people with mental health disabilities. I could go on and on.”\n\n“Certainly the impact of conflict and disasters has a tremendous impact on everyone,” Roth said, noting the emotional trauma that accompanies the experience of disabled people attempting to flee war. “There are many people with mental health disabilities before disaster, before the conflict. And they are left out, left back, left behind.”\n\nSolutions in an ableist world\n\nAdvocates like Roth say that U.S. funding should go directly to disability-led organizations.\n\n“We are master problem solvers,” said Roth. “We are very good at anticipating problems, creative solutions, and we are huge assets in disaster-impacted communities.”\n\nBut as evidenced by the United States’ recent veto of the UN ceasefire resolution, it is clear that foreign aid will continue to fund military aggression, not peacebuilding.\n\nRoth highlighted the work of Fight for Right, a disabled woman-led collective in Ukraine who since the start of the Russian invasion has been at the forefront of disability justice.\n\n“They found themselves needing to step in,” said Roth. She says they were able to move many of disabled people to safety and help them shelter in place, including many of the disabled men being forced to serve. “A small disabled women led organization was able to move tens of thousands of people to safety.”\n\nTo facilitate evacuation, Fahad and others call for humanitarian corridors specifically for disabled people.\n\nFor those who cannot leave their country, new ordinances aim to provide some protection. In the Congo authorities recently ratified Organic Law No. 22/003 of May 2022, which ensures disabled people’s rights to employment, healthcare, accessibility, and protects them from discrimination.\n\nAs international governments fail the disabled community, disabled people themselves continue to offer solidarity to one another. Melo created a disability and Palestine video playlist that includes interviews, clips of Israeli soldiers targeting disabled Palestinians, and information that aims to educate and inspire advocacy.\n\n“Whatever you hope will happen for disabled Palestinians,” they said. “You must find a way to contribute to that dream.”\n\nThe struggle for justice remains linked to war and empire, but so too are the answers to ending ableism in crisis and beyond. “I just hope that one day we can realize we are all equal in humanity,” said Khoury."
