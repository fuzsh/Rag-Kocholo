        "text": "I started this post yesterday thinking it would be a short one not assosiated with our current series, but as it was the Lord’s leading, it will probably be an added chapter.\n\nThe closer we are to the Lord, the greater is the warfare. He and we are still being attacked today. In every age, until the end of this world and His coming again to save His people from the evil one, He is drawing us nearer and keeping us close to Him.\n\nWe must understand the battle to which He brings us. It is a spiritual war within a physical world.\n\nThis world is not just a physical, visible world. It is encompassed within a spiritual world.\n\nThe battle between the two ~ the antithesis ~ began in the Garden of Eden and will continue until He comes again.\n\nAs we draw closer to that time of departure in the enemy’s last effort through death, we are witness to this warfare between the spiritual and the physical world. We live in the center of the warzone, with the weaponry used from all sides seemingly coming at the same time. We were experiencing this attack yesterday.\n\nThis comes now for Jerry and me as I am in the process of publishing One Month to LIVE ~ A Father’s Last Words; a recollection of the last three weeks with my dad as he was dying of cancer. He died on Labor Day, 1994, but while working on this project, the event has been almost as real as those days twenty-four years ago. We are close to the same ages as my parents were then; going through the same stages as they were before my dad was diagnosed with cancer. (Praise the Lord, the day ended amazingly victorious and fruitful; the first draft submitted, waiting for review.)\n\nTo Admonish\n\nI share all this to alert those who are still young, to know where you are; who you are in Christ: to admonish you to draw nearer to HIm now, with all diligence through His Word, prayer, worship in a close-knit, Bible-led congregation of those whose lives are spent for His name’s sake, through His grace and for His glory. Herein, is the means of enduring as we understand the fiery trials that come.\n\n“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” Ephesians 6:12\n\nThe WAR is real, unlike any physical battles on this earth. Unless you are prepared beforehand for the ending of your life for eternity with Him, you will perish when your world starts spinning out of control; your flesh wasting away, while losing all your mental faculties. You will have lost the battle without even knowing it.\n\nYou will pass into eternity in the arms of the Lord Jesus or into outer darkness with the enemy of God. If you believe HIs Word, you will see now, Beyond a Mere Christianity, the goal that lies ahead and prepare for the battles that all creatures will face in this lifetime. Among other things, it a battle for truth (Ephesians 6:10-18).\n\n“Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.\n\nPut on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\n\nWherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.” Ephesians 6:10-11, 13\n\nDear Father, how do we hold to your Word or stand in these days of the battle? The spirit and the flesh are always at odds, and we have no means of holding or standing except in Christ who has called us to eternity with Him. You know that this puts us right in the middle between you and the evil one. You know we cannot endure except as you stand with us and fill us with the power of your Spirit, the Spirit of Christ. Lead us in the paths of righteousness for your name’s sake. This is our only hope and our assurance of salvation. We thank you and praise you in Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nFran\n\nPlease listen to these two sermons from Northern Ireland on Things That are Eternal, Things That are Eternal Part 2. You will be graciously blessed.\n\nImage:Google"
