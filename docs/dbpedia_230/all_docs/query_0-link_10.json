        "text": "For mobile version, see Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile.\n\nFor its sequel, see Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone was a free-to-play Call of Duty game developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Windows. Warzone is a component of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and integrates content from Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Vanguard. The game featured three main modes, a Battle Royale mode, a Plunder mode, and a Resurgence mode added with the Season One of Black Ops Cold War.\n\nAnnounced on March 9th, 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released the next day on March 10th. Warzone was downloaded and played by more than 6 million players in 24 hours[1], 15 million after 3 days[2], 30 million after 10 days[3], 50 million after a month [4], 60 million after less than two months[5], over 75 million after five months[6] and over 85 million after nine months[7]. Over 100 million after 13 months[8]. By June 2022, Warzone surpassed 125 million total players.[9]\n\nWith the release of the sequel Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 on November 16th, 2022, the servers of Call of Duty: Warzone temporarily remained offline and returned on November 28th, 2022, with the game relaunched as Call of Duty: Warzone Caldera, only with the Caldera map with Battle Royale Solos and Quads playlists. On June 22nd, 2023, it was announced Warzone Caldera would be shutdown on September 21st, 2023.[10]\n\nOverview[]\n\nHealth[]\n\nPlayers start with 150 health and 2 Armor Plates equipped. Each plate adds 50 extra health. If a player equips another Armor Plate, up to a total of 3 plates, their health raises to its maximum, 300. Players can hold 5 plates in reserve at a time, or 8 if carrying an Armor Satchel, in addition to the armor they are wearing, making for a total of 8-11. Armor Plates can be purchased at Buy Stations in a bundle of 5, as well as an Armor Box which when placed can instantly fill the player's Armor Plate reserves.\n\nWeapons[]\n\nThe weapons available in Warzone include nearly all multiplayer weapons available in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and Call of Duty: Vanguard.\n\nWeapon Tiers[]\n\nWeapons in Warzone are sorted by Weapon Tiers. Weapons of varying tiers can be found by looting and completing Contracts. Unlike other battle royale games where a weapon's rarity level determines its damage, fire rate, accuracy, etc, rarity tiers in Warzone simply apply more attachments to a weapon as the rarity increases.\n\nPlayer Loadouts (Default weapons and/or obtained via Loadout Drops)\n\nCommon (No attachment included)\n\nUncommon (1 attachment)\n\nRare (3 attachments)\n\nEpic (4 attachments)\n\nLegendary (5 attachments)\n\nUltra (Unobtainable from ground loot)\n\nContracts[]\n\nContracts are optional objectives that teams can complete to earn XP and Weapon XP as well as rare loot or Cash, which can be spent at Buy Stations.\n\nA Bounty contract tasks the team with killing a specific player, who is marked by a yellow circle revealing their approximate position on the map. When a player is marked as a bounty target, they and their team can see a bar on their heads-up display that measures the proximity of their hunters to the target.\n\nA Recon contract will have the team capture a set point in the map by standing near it, similar to a point in Domination. Completing the contract will give the team one circle peek. Doing more Recon contracts can give additional circle peeks, until the final circle is revealed.\n\nA Scavenger contract will mark 3 Supply Boxes located near the player's location, one at a time, and task the team with looting each in a limited time. An Armor Satchel is guaranteed in the final supply box.\n\nA Most Wanted contract marks its user for all enemies to see, offering a reward to any player who can eliminate them in a limited time. Letting the time run out completes the contract, rewarding the player and their team with Cash as well as redeploying any eliminated teammates.\n\nA Supply Run contract will have the team travel to a marked Buy Station approximately 500m away in a limited time. Upon completion, each team member will be able to purchase one discounted item, or get a Self Revive Kit or revive a teammate for free.\n\nA Big Game Bounty contract marks a player with a high elimination count to be eliminated in a limited time. The contract is shown on the Tac Map at the end of the first playzone and will not target the same player several times in a row.\n\nA Supply Drop contract marks an area for a Supply Crate filled with loot and with the exact location only highlighted for the team which activated the active contract. The green smoke of the marker can still be viewed by other teams.\n\nA [TOP SECRET] contract will randomly select one of the other contracts to be completed, with increased rewards.\n\nA Contraband contract has a small chance of occurring after completing any of the aforementioned contracts. Among the loot the team is rewarded with, Contraband will spawn, appearing as a bright blue suitcase. It must be picked up and brought to a highlighted point for helicopter extraction within a time limit. This contract rewards the team with an unlock for one of many unique weapon blueprints.\n\nBuy Station[]\n\nMain article: Buy Station\n\nBuy Stations are boxes that can be found throughout a map where players can purchase equipment, killstreaks using Cash earned during the game. Squadmates can also be redeployed from the Buy Stations for $4,000.\n\nArmor Plate Bundle [4]: $1,500\n\nGas Mask: $3,000\n\nSupply Box UAV: $3,000\n\nCluster Strike: $3,000\n\nPrecision Airstrike: $3,500\n\nSelf-Revive Kit: $4,000\n\nMunitions Box: $4,500\n\nArmor Box: $6,000\n\nUAV: $6,000\n\nUsing at least 3 UAVs at a time grants an effect similar to the Advanced UAV.\n\nLoadout Drop Marker: $10,000\n\nPlayzones[]\n\nThe playzone in Warzone is surrounded by toxic gas that bypasses armor plates and reduces health directly, while chipping away at armor as well. To become invincible to the gas for a certain time, players can find a Gas Mask in Supply Boxes randomly within the map or can purchase one from a Buy Station. Gas Masks can protect players from the gas for 10 seconds. After that, depending on its phase, the gas can kill a player at full health and armor in 15 seconds.\n\nGulag[]\n\nMain article: Gulag (Warzone)\n\nWarzone features a respawning system called Gulag which allows players who were eliminated for the first time to redeploy in the game after winning a short firefight.\n\nWhen a player is eliminated for the first time, a cutscene will show them being captured and sent to the Gulag. If others players are already in the Gulag, the player will be put in a queue and will be allow to watch the other fights from a high place as well as throwing rocks at the contestants. Once they enter the fight, the player will have to face another player in a 1v1 fight similar to Gunfight. The winner of the fight will be redeployed into the main game again while the loser may spectate the rest of the match or quit. When playing in solo, the loser of the fight won't be able to redeploy and the game ends for them.\n\nEvents[]\n\nEvents can also randomly happen during a match, usually during the second playzone. In most modes, only one event can occur during a single match.\n\nThe Jailbreak event allows every down player in Gulag to be redeployed into the map. Other players are notified 1 minute before the jailbreak happens.\n\nThe Fire Sale event reduces the prices of all items in the Buy Stations up to 100% during 1 minute. The Self-Revive Kits are free and redeploying squadmates only costs $2,000 during the event.\n\nArmor Plate Bundle: $300; Gas Mask: $600; Munitions Box: $900; Armor Box: $1,200\n\nCluster Strike: $600; Precision Airstrike: $700; UAV: $1,200\n\nThe Restock event resupplies every Supply Box which can be opened again.\n\nThe Resurgence event allows player to respawn after being killed as long as one of their teammates are alive.\n\nThe Cash Drop event spawns several Cash Drop crates on the map, similarly to a regular match of Plunder.\n\nThe Heavy Weapons Crate event spawns several supply crates filled with high-tier weapons.\n\nThe Titan Frenzy event was a limited time event added for Operation Monarch. It made Kong and Godzilla become enraged and to attack any nearby players. If the player or team deals the most damage to a titan, they will receive a S.C.R.E.A.M. Device.\n\nThe Supply Choppers event was one of the original event in Warzone before it was removed with the Warzone Pacific update. The contract revealed five unarmed supply helicopters that can be shot down using heavy weaponry. Once a helicopter is destroyed, a Supply Crate will drop and reward players with 3 UAVs, 2 Armor Boxes, 1 Munition Box, 1 Gas Mask, Cash, Weapons and a MGL-32 Grenade Launcher. The Supply Crate, however, will be highlighted for every other player.\n\nVehicles[]\n\nWarzone features 10 different vehicles in both the Battle Royale and Plunder mode.\n\nATV (1 driver, 1 passenger)\n\nSUV (1 driver, 3 passengers)\n\nHeli (1 pilot, 4 passengers)\n\nCargo Truck (1 driver, 10 passengers)\n\nTac Rover (1 driver, 3 passengers)\n\nDirt Bike (1 driver, 1 passenger)\n\nFighter Plane (1 driver, 1 passenger)\n\nSquad Transport (1 driver, 3 passengers)\n\nUtility Truck (1 driver, 10 passengers)\n\nBomber Plane (1 driver, 3 passengers)\n\nArmored SUV (1 driver, 4 passengers)\n\nProgression and Crossplay[]\n\nWarzone supports Crossplay across all platforms since its introduction in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.\n\nPrior to Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, both Modern Warfare and Warzone shared a progression system, with 55 Enlisted ranks, unlocking items for Modern Warfare in both games. Afterwards came 100 Officer ranks. resetting at the beginning of each season, granting access to challenges and a weapon blueprint unlock at Level 155.\n\nThe release of Season One introduced a new progression system, unified across all three games. 55 Military ranks are available, unlocking Black Ops Cold War items for Warzone. Upon completing all Military ranks, the player will automatically enter Prestige 1. Increasing the Season Rank and reaching multiples of 50 will increase the Prestige level further, the maximum rank being 1000. At the beginning of each Season, the Season Rank will be reset to 1, but the Prestige level achieved prior will be retained. This system continued with the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone also shares the same Store and Battle Pass system as Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard.\n\nGame Modes[]\n\nBattle Royale[]\n\nMain article: Battle Royale\n\n\"Loot and Kill. Last team standing wins.\"\n\n— Battle Royale Description\n\nIn Battle Royale, players fight to be the last team standing. Warzone was released with squads of three players but on March 17th, a solo mode was added to Battle Royale[11] followed by a 4-player Quads mode on April 8th[12]. In addition to the loot found on the map and dropped by eliminated players, players can collect Cash to buy equipment or killstreaks from Buy Stations. Squads can also take on Contracts to get loot and Cash.\n\nWhen a player is eliminated, they are sent to the Gulag where they will have to win the fight for a chance to being brought back into the match. When playing with a squad, the player who died during the fight can be redeployed by their teammates with either a Squad Buyback, which costs $4,000, or by completing a Most Wanted contract. A player who dies again after having won a Gulag fight dies again will need to be redeploy by their teammates. Players can also use a Self-Revive Kit to revive themselves when downed. These are available as loot and at Buy Stations for $4,000.\n\nScopes And Scatter Guns[]\n\n\"Shotguns and Snipers only. Near? Far? Whatever... BR.\"\n\n— Scopes And Scatter Guns Description\n\nScopes And Scatter Guns is a limited-time variant of Battle Royale. It was available between April 14th and April 17th, 2020. As the name implies, the only weapons available during a match of Scopes And Scatter Guns were Sniper Rifles and Shotguns with Loadout Drops disabled. Players would still deploy with the X16 at the start of a match.\n\nThe mode returned between October 14th and October 28th, 2021, exclusively on Rebirth Island. Playing like the original variant, the mode also used the same Down But Not Out gameplay as Resurgence. Alongside Sniper Rifles and Shotguns, player also had access to Crossbows. The players would deploy with the Marshal at the start of a match.\n\nBuy Back[]\n\n\"When a player dies, they will parachute back into the fight if they have enough cash on them. The Gulag is disabled.\"\n\n— Buy Back Description\n\nBuy Back, originally called Stimulus, is a recurring variant of Battle Royale. Unlike normal Battle Royale, Buy Back doesn't feature a Gulag system but only allows players to redeploy their killed teammates by spending $4,000 at the Buy Stations for a duration of 20 minutes and 15 seconds. As such, every player starts a match with $4,500. When playing in a solo version, players can redeploy automatically as long as they have over $4,500.\n\nRealism[]\n\nRealism is a limited time variant of Battle Royale. It was available between June 19th and June 23rd, 2020. In Realism, the Heads-up display is stripped of most of its indicators such as the mini-map, player's health, cash, ammos and equipment, Field Upgrades, remaining players. Only the name of the squad players remained as well as a smaller indicator for the armor. The overall Tac Map can still be viewed. Players deal more headshot damage in Realism compared to standard Battle Royale.\n\n200 Quads[]\n\n200 Quads is a limited time variant of Battle Royale. It was available between June 30th and July 8th, 2020. As the name suggests, the mode played with 200 players in squads of four players rather than the standard 150-player matches.\n\nVanguard[]\n\n\"Experience planes and weaponry fit for battle in the heart of the Pacific during 1944.\"\n\n— Vanguard Royale Description\n\nIntroduced with the Season One of Call of Duty: Vanguard, Vanguard Royale features only weapons and operators from Vanguard as well as restricting various items from the loot pool.\n\nThe mode is similar to Battle Royale with the addition of dogfighting with Fighter Planes as well as anti-aircraft guns that players can use to shoot down the planes. The mode also features Bombing Runs, first seen in Last Hours of Verdansk, randomly striking areas with mortar fire.\n\nSimilarly to Operation: Flashback, an event will occur at the start of each new circle and playzone for the first sixth circles. The last two playzones don't feature events. The different events are as follows:\n\nCircle 1: Weapon Crates or Cash Drops\n\nCircle 2: Loadout Drops\n\nCircle 3: Fire Sale\n\nCircle 4: Weapon Crates or Cash Drops (Higher Chance); Resurgence or Jailbreak or Loadout Drops (Lower Chance)\n\nCircle 5: Restock\n\nCircle 6: Loadout Drops\n\nVanguard Royale was removed with Season Two Reloaded of Vanguard on March 23th, 2022.

Each match only lasts 30 minutes. Unlike Battle Royale, players have unlimited respawns and redeployments and can spawn with their own loadouts and Field Upgrades.\n\nIn order to accumulate the most amount of cash before time runs out, squads can open Supply Boxes, taking and completing Contracts or eliminating players who will drop a percentage of the cash they were holding before dying. Cash Drops containing $100,000 can also appear around the map. The squads with the most money are marked on the Tac Map of all players by a red bag icon and a red crown icon for the squad with the most cash.\n\nOnce a squad has reached $1,000,000, an overtime timer appears with a 4-minute countdown and all the cash collected afterward is automatically deposited. In addition, all the cash collected by every squad during the overtime is multiplied by 1.5x. The match ends after the standard 30 minutes or after the 4-minute timer.\n\nResurgence[]\n\nMain article: Resurgence (Warzone)\n\n\"Survive to redeploy fallen teammates and earn score to return them faster.\"\n\n— Resurgence Description\n\nIntroduced with the Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Resurgence takes place on Rebirth Island or Fortune's Keep and works similarly to Blackout's Down But Not Out mode. As long as a teammate is alive, players can redeploy after a countdown. They can redeploy 15 seconds after being killed during the first playzone and 39 seconds during the second and third playzones until the Rebirth Countdown runs out after 9 minutes and 15 seconds. After the timer has run out, players being killed will no longer be able to redeploy. Killing a player will also temporarily highlight their teammates on the mini-map.\n\nEvery player in Resurgence starts with a Self-Revive Kit. Players can also help their teammates redeploy faster by downing other players reducing the timer by 2 seconds; killing other players, reducing it by 7 seconds; killing other players with a Finishing Move, reducing it by 8 seconds; destroying enemy equipments, reducing the timer by 1 seconds; opening crates, reducing it by 2 seconds; and completing contracts, reducing the timer by 5 seconds.\n\nThe mode also features exclusive crates called Rebirth Supply Boxes. Painted in red, these Supply Boxes can be reactivated after being opened. The boxes are marked with a recharging bar; as the bar progresses its color change from red to green. Once fully recharged, after just over a minute, the boxes can be looted again.\n\nMaps[]\n\nVerdansk[]\n\nMain article: Verdansk\n\nThe first map released for Warzone is Verdansk set in Kastovia. The map supported up to 200 players depending on the modes and playlists but was played generally with 150 players. With the release of the Season One of Call of Duty: Vanguard, Verdansk was removed from Warzone.\n\nDuring Season Four of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a train track was added to the western part of Verdansk creating a tunnel near the Hospital. Several small shacks were also added onto the map but were locked to prevent players from entering them. In Season Five, the Stadium roof was destroyed, allowing players to access its interiors. Underground parking lots were also made available around the Stadium. The interiors of the Train Station also became available for the players. Several rappelling ropes were added to high buildings around the map such as the SNK building and the Art Museum in Tavorsk District or the Stadium. A freight train was also added which traveled around the train track added in Season Four. In Season Six, an underground metro system was added to the map, which allows for fast, relatively safe travel between areas of the map. A night-time version of Verdansk was also available during Season Six with the Haunting of Verdansk event.\n\nWith Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, a new underground bunker was added beneath the western airport runway, accessible through a large hole in the ground or a small shed near the runway. The bunker uniquely contains several corridors and rooms. Multiple monitors display the same ICBM footage seen in Bunker 10. Several canisters of Nova 6 could be seen in one of the rooms.\n\nWith the release of Season Two, the Vodianoy, a ship previously seen near Rebirth Island crashed into Verdansk, creating a new location Shipwreck. Missiles silos were also added beneath or near Spomeniks. During the first two weeks of Season Two, zombies could be summoned and then eliminated at the Shipwreck to collect cash and armor. If all 40 zombies were killed, the final one to die would drop a Yellow Access Card, which could be used to open a Supply Box full of highly rare loot. Between March 11 and April 15, zombies moved into different locations, some of them gaining new abilities. Radiation zones started to appear where the zombies could be found previously. Season Two ended with the Destruction of Verdansk event which marked the end of the current modern-day Verdansk.\n\nThe release of Season Three introduced a new version of Verdansk called Verdansk '84 which featured several new Point of Interests as well as drastically redesigned and renamed known locations. Among the new POIs are the Summit Complex and the Gora Viaduct which replaced the Gora Dam, the Kastovia Radar Array replaced the WHP Camp, the Plane Factory was added next to the Superstore. The Verdansk Arena was replaced by a smaller stadium being demolished, the Karst River Quarry was renamed Karst Salt Mine with parts of the mountain still present, the Verdansk Aiport and its interior were now intact and redesigned, the village in Krovnik Farmland was also redesigned. The spomeniks were replaced with missile hatches and various buildings were either removed or replaced. The metro stations were removed from the map while the western train tack and the circling freight train remained. With the 80s Action Heroes event, ten survival camps were added throughout the map replacing several campsites as a reference to 1985 movie Rambo: First Blood Part II; the interior of Hangar 21 inside the Arklov Peak military base was changed into a CIA outpost; the government plaza in Downtown Tavorsk was changed as the SNK Tower and several other buildings were replaced with the Nakatomi Plaza from 1988 movie Die Hard. The parking garage of the tower as well as its first three floors, floors 30 to 34 and the roof became available to the players.\n\nWith Season Four, the survival camps and CIA outpost were removed while the Nakatomi Plaza remained and was renamed Downtown Tower, although the vault was now closed. Four crashed satellites were added to the map east of Farmland, on the Gora Bridge near Tavorsk District, next to the Gora river between Bloc 16 and Bloc 17, near the Karst river next to Bloc 18. Several Red Doors, first seen in the Black Ops Cold War campaign, were added around the maps and allowed players to teleport across the map to previously unreachable rooms which featured a chair in front of several TVs as well as various crates with loot called Stations going from Alpha to Mike. When a player crossed a door, numbers started to appear on the screen. With Season Four Reloaded, players could hear Vikhor \"Stitch\" Kuzmin and Russell Adler as they would walk through the doors. Some doors would teleport and deploy players around the map while others would teleport the players to the rooms. Some rooms featured a Supply Box covered with numbers offering more legendary loot and could also feature a Specialist Bonus rewarding players with all the Perks. Other rooms featured a Supply Box marked with the Perseus logo and would explode and release gas to hurt the players. After a door was used several times, it disappeared for the rest of a match.\n\nThe Season Five introduced nine Mobile Broadcast Stations that could be found around the map emitting noices and were used as part of the Numbers event. Seven piles of red shipping containers could also be found around Verdansk. The Red Doors were also updated to teleport the players in a corridor similarly to the one first seen in the Black Ops Cold War campaign mission Break on Through. Within the corridor, four doors were available and the players had to choose one of them within 30 seconds. Three of the doors would simply teleport and redeploy the players while the last one would send them to one of the rooms. If the player didn't choose a door before the timer ran out, they were teleported and redeployed back on the map witnessing a bell ringing among the numbers.\n\nWith Season Six, it was revealed that the shipping containers were used by Adler to drill into German bunkers under the city and set seismic charges to destroy Verdansk. The explosions destroyed the Stadium and leveled parts of Downtown Tavorsk, leaving massives fissures in the area. While most of the red shipping containers were destroyed, three piles remained and were used to access the bunkers with one located near Kastovia Radar Array, one near the Boneyard and the last one near the Airport Maintenance. In addition to the shipping containers, another entry for the bunkers were available next to rubbles and construction vehicles. A night-time version of Verdansk' 84 was also available during Season Six with the Haunting event. The Old Mines located west of the Verdansk Airport were opened as part of the Secrets of the Pacific event.\n\nRebirth Island[]\n\nMain article: Rebirth Island (Warzone)\n\nThe second map for Warzone is Rebirth Island which was released with the Season One for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. The map is a remake of Alcatraz from the Blackout of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and was originally set in 1984. Following the end of the Season Five of Call of Duty: Vanguard, Rebirth Island was removed from Warzone.\n\nThe map features vehicles as well as its own version of the Gulag respawn system. The map supports up to 99 players depending on the modes and playlists but is played generally with 40 players.\n\nA Night version of Rebirth Island set in 2021 was available during the Destruction of Verdansk event marking the end of Season Two of Black Ops Cold War. This version featured a new building called Control Center replacing the construction site. A Day version of the 2021 Rebirth Island map was released during Black Ops Cold War's Season Three with the 80s Action Heroes event on May 20th, 2021 replacing the previous 1984 version.\n\nThe release of Season Two Reloaded of Call of Duty: Vanguard introduced a new version of Rebirth Island called Rebirth Island Reinforced which was set in 2022 and featured several new Point of Interests as well as drastically redesigned and renamed known locations.\n\nCaldera[]\n\nMain article: Caldera\n\nThe third map for Warzone is Caldera set in the Pacific. The map was released with the Season One for Call of Duty: Vanguard, replacing Verdansk. The map also supports up to 150 players.\n\nThe release of Season Two introduced a new Point of Interest, the Factory located to the north of Caldera. The factory itself was guarded by non-playable characters shooting at any player approaching the facility. Seven of the thirteen hatches featured on Caldera were opened, leading to research labs also guarded by non-playable characters. Inside the research labs, the player could find the new loot Nebula V Ammo, Nebula V Bombs, and P.D.S. Several Armored Transport Trucks could also been seen traveling around Caldera rewarding players with Cash and loot when destroyed. Redeploy Balloons were also added throughout Caldera, allowing players to toss themselves into the air and travel around the map.\n\nFortune's Keep[]\n\nMain article: Fortune's Keep\n\nThe fourth map for Warzone is Fortune's Keep designed for the Resurgence mode. The map was released with the Season Four of Call of Duty: Vanguard. The map takes place on a island in the Adriatic Sea. Following the end of the Season Five of Call of Duty: Vanguard, Fortune's Keep was removed from Warzone.\n\nStory[]\n\nModern Warfare Storyline[]\n\nFollowing a series of operations in 2020 carried out by the ARM-4 team of Armistice, a localised alliance between the Allegiance and the Coalition, to dismantle an Al-Qatala network in Verdansk, Khaled Al-Asad released a massive amount of poisonous gas into the city as part of the Ultranationalist Victor Zakhaev's plan to dissolve Armistice and increase tensions between Russia and the West.\n\nIn March 2020, with the gas engulfing the city, Armistice operatives started fighting among themselves to survive. Lieutenant Simon \"Ghost\" Riley, a member of the Task Force 141 stationed in Verdansk, reported to Captain John Price, the task force leader, several blue on blue incidents and requested reinforcement and operators he could trust.\n\nIn April, Zakhaev's plan was a success. As the situation deteriorated, Price informed Ghost, who managed to leave Verdansk, that Armistice was officially disbanded. Zakhaev allowed Al-Qatala to return to Urzikstan while his own army stayed in Verdansk. The conflict continued, however, and soon Price and Kyle Garrick, another member of Task Force 141, joined the fight. Many operators from Allegiance and Coalition also arrived in Verdansk.\n\nIn August, with no progress made to stop Zakhaev, a private military company called Shadow Company and its Senior Officer, Marcus Ortega, joined the fight in Verdansk. After receiving intel from the Allegiance about Ultranationalist comms traffic coming from the Verdansk National Arena, Ortega and a small team of Shadow Company operatives stormed the stadium, blowing off its roof and landed in its soccer field to eliminate any hostiles and hunt down Zakhaev. This proved to be fruitless, and Zakhaev was nowhere to be found.\n\nIn September, with the help of Ghost, operators were able to discover that Zakhaev had been evading detection by using the underground metro system to travel on foot. Chimera leader \"Nikolai\" enters the subways alongside Farah Karim, now a Chimera operator, and powers the trains for use against the Ultranationalists. Farah contacts Price in preparations for capturing Zakhaev. Afterwards, Price contacts Sergeant Griggs of the Demon Dogs to stand by for orders.\n\nIn December, the team figured out that Zakhaev was going to activate a hidden ICBM located in Bunker 10. Farah, Alex Keller, and the Demon Dogs branch of the Coalition launched an assault against Zakhaev's guards to create a diversion while Price infiltrated the bunker. Zakhaev managed to activate the missile before Price shot him and threw him off to the bottom of the silo. With Zakhaev dead, Price received the abort code, 6157, from \"Nikolai\" and prevented the missile from launching. The team then regrouped on top of the Verdansk dam where Ghost noted that it wasn't over yet as they oversee an ongoing battle. Price then received a call from Johnny \"Soap\" MacTavish informing him that things were heating up half a click off the coast of Verdansk. Price replied they were moving his way before the team jumped off the dam.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, an abandoned cargo ship named Vodianoy wrecked at the south-eastern coast of Verdansk, after disappearing in 1984. The shipwreck contained the biochemical agent Nova 6, as well as zombies. Armistice operations continued, focused on containing the threat, but the presence of zombies grew across the city. On April 21, evacuation was ordered for all remaining Armistice operators in Verdansk, but the situation became critical. In a last-ditch effort, a nuclear strike was ordered on Verdansk, to quickly eliminate the zombie threat.[Canonical?]\n\nBlack Ops Cold War Storyline[]\n\nOn April 19th, 1984, following Vikhor \"Stitch\" Kuzmin's capture of CIA operative Russell Adler, the terrorist organization Perseus transported him to Verdansk, leading off a NATO search party with untrue claims of Nova 6 production. While the NATO team was distracted by the false lead, Stitch tortured Adler, and ordered fellow operatives Freya \"Wraith\" Helvig and Roman \"Knight\" Gray to infiltrate a KGB black site in Mount Yamantau and steal data from the brainwashing project conducted by Nikita Dragovich on Alex Mason during the 1960s. After the information was extracted and the Perseus team exfiltrated the base, they destroyed it with a nuclear bomb. In Verdansk, Stitch later assured the team that his work with Adler was almost complete, and that Perseus would do \"what Dragovich only managed with a single subject\" to \"entire nations\", paving way for Perseus' goal of a Greater Russia.\n\nAdler was eventually located in Verdansk by NATO forces and rescued on June 10th, 1984, by which Perseus had placed several sleeper agents in Verdansk. However, satellites were in place that prevented further communication with the subjects. Discussing the matter, Wraith and Knight suggested calling on the help of a contact in South Africa to assist in destroying the satellites, to which Stitch agreed.\n\nOn June 26th, Owethu \"Jackal\" Mabuza led a Perseus team after capturing the Jumpseat Satellite Ground Station in South Africa and crashing two satellites into the Earth’s atmosphere. One crashed in Verdansk and the other crashed in Algeria. This allows Vikhor Kuzmin to broadcast on a specific frequency.\n\nVanguard Storyline[]\n\nAs part of Project Phoenix and the advent of the Fourth Reich, Nazi scientists began the development of Nebula V on the island of Caldera as well as the nearby islands. The gas was then to be loaded into V-2 Rockets and launched against the Allied Powers.\n\nOn December 3rd, 1944, the SOE launched Operation Vulcan after rumors of German activity on Caldera. Carver Butcher oversaw the operation, transporting Task Force Trident led by Francis Lanakila and comprised of Isabella Reyes and Lewis Howard. However, the Germans spotted the plane and began attacking it. Carver ordered Trident to jump out while he crash-landed on a beach. The task force regrouped and began looking for Butcher who discovered a hidden bunker near the crash site. Inside the bunker, they discovered intel regarding Nebula V and a stockpile hidden within a medieval castle in the Alps.\n\nButcher succesfully returned to Europe and oversaw another operation with Task Force Yeti led by Anna Drake and comprised of Thomas Bolt and Gustavo dos Santos. As a tank battle raged on outside of the castle, Yeti infiltrated the castle to acquire the Nebula V. The task force burst through the door where the weapon was stockpiled but a Nazi soldier released the gas while celebrating the Fourth Reich before the team could secure the weapon. As they fled, the gas engulfed the castle killing the German soldiers stationed there. The task force escaped the area with the help of Butcher who had seized a Panzer IV.\n\nEaster Eggs[]\n\nBunkers[]\n\nFollowing the release of Title Update 1.21 on May 18th, 2020 for Modern Warfare and Warzone, some of the twelve bunkers, Bunker 00 to Bunker 11, in Verdansk could be opened. The bunkers featured several Supply Boxes and rare items.\n\nBunkers 00, 04, 05, 06, and 09 could be opened using a Red Access Card, that could be looted from a Supply Box or a dead player who already had one. Once in possession of a card, a player could travel to one of the five bunkers available and interact with the panel outside the bunker to \"Enter Access Code\" and open the bunker. Each bunker featured another door inside that was locked by an 8-digit keypad.\n\nBunker 11[]\n\nBunker 11, located in the far north of Verdansk, requires to activate several phones to open it. At the start of a game, several specific phones can be picked up to start the sequence. Once the correct phone is picked up, the player will hear someone speak Russian, and after a small chime they'll hear three numbers spoken in Russian from 0 to 9.\n\nThe numbers matched another set of specific phones that need to be activated in the same order as the numbers spoken originally. Once a player activated the three phones in the exact order, they would be able to travel to Bunker 11 and enter the \"Number Station Code\" to open it.\n\nOnce inside, the players would follow a series of corridors with the sentence \"Resume cover. Await further instructions\" written on a wall at one point. They would then find themselves in a central room leading to another locked door. Two rooms could be accessed on the left of the central room and one room on the right.\n\nIn the first room on the left, players would find a room with a computer that could be rebooted. The second room on the left featured a meeting room where a monitor presented a 10 second countdown that would reset at 00:00:02. The room on the right contained the Legendary \"Mud Drauber\" MP7 blueprint, which when obtained would unlock the blueprint in the player's Armory. This room also featured a secret passage leading to a Shiny Red Button. Activating the button would clear smoke through a window to the next room, letting players see several nuclear warheads.\n\nStadium[]\n\nFollowing the release of Title Update 1.24 on August 5th, 2020 for Modern Warfare and Warzone that came with Season Five, the stadium was opened and new Blue Access Cards became available to the players.\n\nThere are three areas in the stadium, the underground Parking Lots, the Concourse and the Executive Level on the upper part of the stadium. The Blue Access Cards can be found anywhere within the stadium but cannot be found in Supply Boxes. Each Blue Access Card unlock one specific room at each specific area. The \"P2-16\" Access Card is used to open a room in the underground Parking Lots, the \"CL-19\" Access Card is used to open a room in the Concourse near the bar, and the \"EL-21\" Access Card is used to open a door in the Executive Level.\n\nEach room contains a computer that, when interacted with, gives a 8-digit code consisting of numbers from 0 to 9 and three specific symbols. Each computer gives the same code but some numbers are replaced by some of the three symbols. Using the three codes, players can decipher the actual 8-digit code and enter it in a keypad next to a double door in the Executive Level.\n\nOnce the door is unlocked, players can enter the room and obtain the Legendary \"Enigma\" CR-56 AMAX blueprint, adding it to their Armory. The opening of the door is accompanied by fireworks launching all around the stadium.\n\nMetro Station[]\n\nFollowing the release of Season Six, a keypad became accessible inside the Parliament building in Downtown Verdansk, alongside a computer that had the option to \"Enter Password.\"\n\nIn the metro stations in Verdansk, players could see portions of a code on signs inside the stations, with the rest of the code redacted. Different parts of the code were redacted at different stations; the complete code was \"2179\".\n\nUpon entering the code 2179 at the keypad in the Parliament building, the building would enter a lockdown in which the doors would close and lock, trapping any players inside. Toxic gas would fill the room, eventually killing any players within after a short time. After this, the lockdown would end and the doors would open again. This can be repeated with no limits.\n\nDuring the lockdown, the computer at the desk would be accessible, displaying a sequence of images that corresponded to paintings inside the building, then providing a keypad interface where 2 halves of several numbers are displayed. Roman numerals appear on plaques under all of the possible paintings. Remembering the sequence and solving some math, the player can find the correct code. They will have to first type the top half of every number in the code in the first 4 spaces, then type the bottom half.\n\nIf the correct code is inputted, the lockdown will end inside the building, and any players inside may exit it alive. The computer will briefly display the text \"Subway Override Authorized.\"\n\nAfter authorizing the subway override, the team must then travel to the metro station at Verdansk International Airport, where they can interact with a keyboard to \"Enter Computer Override.\" Doing this will cause the next subway train that arrives to travel to an otherwise inaccessible Maintenance area. Inside this area, a massive amount of loot will be accessible, including rare killstreaks, the Specialist bonus, and the Legendary \"Firebrand\" Bruen Mk9 blueprint. Picking up the weapon will unlock it in the player's armory.\n\nIntel Missions[]\n\nIntroduced with Modern Warfare Season Four and accessible in the \"Missions & Challenges\" section of the menu was the \"Intel\" section.\n\nTo complete the Intel Missions, the player had to collect several pieces of intel, contained within signs, computers or small golden coins, scattered around the map of Verdansk and hinted by provided images. Collecting a piece of intel will advance to the next objective, tasking players with finding another piece of intel. Some pieces of intel require certain perks to be used to collect them. Only one piece of intel per Mission may be collected in a single match of Warzone.\n\nCompleting the Missions would reward the player with experience points and reveal details of various events that occurred in Verdansk during the events of Warzone. Completing all the Intel Missions would unlock a unique cutscene which served as a conclusion for the storyline. With the release of Black Ops Cold War Season Two, Intel Missions were removed from the game.\n\nCombat Packs[]\n\nCombat Packs are downloadable content packs for Warzone and the concurrent game at the time of their release. The packs were originally available as free limited-time content for PlayStation Plus subscribers. Most Combat Packs were released coinciding with the launch of a new season.\n\nModern Warfare Combat Packs were exclusive until October 1st, 2020 while Black Ops Cold War Combat Packs were exclusive until November 1st, 2021.\n\nModern Warfare[]\n\nBlack Ops Cold War[]\n\nVanguard[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare|Warzone[]\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War|Warzone[]\n\nRebirth Island[]\n\nVerdansk '84[]\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard|Warzone[]\n\nCaldera[]\n\nRebirth Island Reinforced[]\n\nFortune's Keep[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDevelopment of Warzone started in 2017, under the name \"Magma\", after Infinity Ward and Raven Software witnessed the rise in popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The mode was originally set in Kabul, Afghanistan before the studios settled with Verdansk.[16]\n\nFootage of Warzone was featured in the Modern Warfare reveal trailer released on May 30th, 2019.[17]\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone was teased during the Season Two intro cutscene of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. A \"Classified\" slide was added at the start of that season in the Modern Warfare's main menu.\n\nOn February 25, with Title Update 1.15, the slide was updated to display \"Transmission Incoming\" under \"Classified\".\n\nOn March 9, after the announcement of Warzone, a 24 hour countdown timer was added to the slide. The slide displayed \"Incoming Transmission\" the next day before the release of Title Update 1.17 and Warzone.\n\nThe announcer for Warzone changed depending on the map and modes played in the game:\n\nAt the launch of Warzone, \"UK Team Leader\" was the announcer for the Operators of the Coalition as well as the training and practice modes for the game while \"Russian Team Leader\" was the announcer for the Operators of the Allegiance. Following the integration of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War in December 2020, Kamarov's voice lines were removed from the game.\n\nWith the release of the Season One of Call of Duty: Vanguard, Carver Butcher became the announcer for Vanguard operators while the \"UK Team Leader\" remained for Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War operators. Following the Season Two Reloaded update, the \"UK Team Leader\" was removed from the game, leaving Butcher as the sole announcer."
