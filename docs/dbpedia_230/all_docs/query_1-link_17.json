        "text": "For the location, see Rebirth Island.\n\nFor the in-game event, see Rebirth Island (Event).\n\n\"Including an entirely new battle royale experience: Rebirth Island. An illicit Soviet base raided and shut down by the CIA in 1968, during which Operator Russell Adler caught and forcefully interrogated the base commander Vikhor “Stitch” Kuzmin, it appears this island was rebuilt and recommissioned by Stitch in 1984 with one purpose: the creation and testing of the deadly Nova 6 gas. Part prison, part chemical bioweapons manufacturing and testing facility, the entire island has dozens of locations to explore including laboratories, barracks, decontamination areas, and a hilltop prison block where unspeakable acts have been perpetrated.\"\n\n— Warzone Description\n\nRebirth Island is a map introduced in Call of Duty: Warzone, and available in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile and Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0.\n\nAs the name suggests, the map is set on Rebirth Island, first seen in the Call of Duty: Black Ops mission Rebirth.\n\nOverview[]\n\nRebirth Island is a remake of Alcatraz from the Blackout mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.\n\nThe map was released in Call of Duty: Warzone on December 16th, 2020 with the Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. It was the first map designed for the Resurgence mode and featured 11 Points of Interest.\n\nDuring the Destruction of Verdansk event, a night-themed version of Rebirth Island briefly became available with a new POI, Control Center, replacing the Construction Site. With the release of the Season Three Reloaded update on May 20th, 2021, Rebirth Island was updated with a sunny day-time lighting and the Control Center POI permanently added to the map. The Decon Zone POI was also extended, as well as the docks near the Shore POI.\n\nA new version of Rebirth Island, dubbed Rebirth Island Reinforced, was released on March 23rd, 2022 as part of the Season Two Reloaded update for Call of Duty: Vanguard. The map was updated with many Perseus emblems featured around the area. The Security Area POI was updated and renamed Stronghold and the docks near the Shore POI were reworked into a new Dock POI which featured an anchored ship. Another anchored ship could be find on the other side of the map next to the Factory POI. During the Rebirth of the Dead event, Rebirth Island was updated to darker and gloomy lighting. With the release of Season Five, the lighting was updated to sunset. In the limited-time mode, Rebirth After Dark, the map was updated with a darker lighting with increased fog.\n\nThe map was removed from Warzone following its re-launch as Warzone Caldera on November 28th, 2022.\n\nThe Rebirth Island Reinforced version of the map became available in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile on October 5th, 2023 during its Limited Release, and is available to all players following its worldwide release on March 21st, 2024.\n\nThe map was also added to Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 with the release of the Season Three update for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. On April 8th, 2024, the map was updated with a dim lighting and a solar eclipse visible in the sky in celebration of the Solar eclipse happening the same day.\n\nGeography and Infrastructures[]\n\nFor Geography and Infrastructure, see Rebirth Island (Warzone)/Infrastructure.\n\nGallery[]\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone[]\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile[]\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone 2.0[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nGeneral[]\n\nRebirth Island, and all its iterations, was primarily developed by Beenox.[1] [2]\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone[]\n\nA ship called \"Vodianoy\" could be seen anchored north west of the island. A few days before the release of Season Two for Black Ops Cold War, the ship left the island before appearing near the coast of Verdansk accompanied by a thunderstorm.\n\nRebirth Island was known by Operation names on different dates during the infil cinematic:\n\nBetween Season One and Season Three of Black Ops Cold War, the map is known as \"Operation: Domino\" and the date is Day 119, 17:35:40.\n\nBetween Season Three Reloaded of Black Ops Cold War and Season Two of Call of Duty: Vanguard, the map is known as \"Operation: Fast Forward\" and the date is Day 24, 11:30:15.\n\nBetween Season Two Reloaded and Season Four of Call of Duty: Vanguard, the map is known as \"Operation Reinforced\" and the date is March, 2022.\n\nFrom Season Five of Call of Duty: Vanguard onwards, the map is known as \"Operation: Sunset\" and the date is September, 2022.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile[]\n\nThe chyron for Rebirth Island in Warzone Mobile erroneously states that it takes place in Kastovia.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone 2.0[]\n\nThe map is known as \"Operation Urgent Renewal\" and the date is Day 147 16:02."
