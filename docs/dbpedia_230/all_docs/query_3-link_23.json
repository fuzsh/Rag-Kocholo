        "text": "Developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 1990s, a period of transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops across a cinematic single-player Campaign, a best-in-class Multiplayer experience, and with the epic return of Round-Based Zombies.\n\nLaunching worldwide on October 25, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is available for pre-order now on Xbox (Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One), PlayStation (PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4), and PC through Microsoft Store, Battle.net, and Steam, and coming to Game Pass on Xbox consoles and PC (Microsoft Store only) at launch. Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass Console players can download and pre-install COD HQ and Call of Duty®: Warzone™.\n\nSecure Early Access to the Open Beta* by pre-ordering or pre-purchasing a digital or physical edition of Black Ops 6 on any supported platform, or by having an active Game Pass subscription (Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console) during the Early Access window. Stay tuned for more details about the Open Beta.\n\nPlayers who pre-order a digital edition of Black Ops 6 receive the Woods Operator Pack for use in Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III, Call of Duty®: Warzone™, and Call of Duty®: Warzone™ Mobile. Also available in Black Ops 6 at launch.\n\nBy pre-ordering, you instantly receive the Classic Woods Operator Skin as part of the Woods Operator Pack. The pack also includes access to unlock the Zombie Woods and Numbers Woods Operator Skins, which can be unlocked by completing exclusive Challenge Events in Modern Warfare® III or Warzone™.\n\nWarzone™ Mobile players: To unlock the Woods Operator Pack in Warzone Mobile, you will need to log in to Modern Warfare III or Warzone on the platform where you pre-ordered with the same linked account you use to play Warzone Mobile.\n\nGame Pass subscribers: To access the Woods Operator Pack, Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console subscribers must log in to Modern Warfare III or Warzone on the platform where they are an active Game Pass subscriber at some point before October 25, 2024, and continue maintaining an active Game Pass subscription to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console.\n\nAvailable on all platforms or as an upgrade option for Game Pass subscribers and players who have already pre-ordered (see more below), the digital-only Vault Edition offers the most content of any version of Black Ops 6.\n\nIn addition to the base game – the Digital Cross-Gen version on consoles and the Standard Edition on PC – and its incentives (Open Beta Early Access and the Woods Operator Pack), the Vault Edition includes the following bonus content.\n\nDigital Cross-Gen Editions for Consoles\n\nAvailable on Xbox and PlayStation, Digital Cross-Gen Editions include the base game playable on both console generations within the same console family (Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, or PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4). Digital Cross-Gen Editions give players the flexibility to play on multiple consoles or take advantage of potential upgrade options.\n\nPlease note: When installing the game on PlayStation 5, be sure to install that console’s version of the game, as both versions may be available for download in the Cross-Gen Bundle.\n\nGame Pass Options\n\nPlayers with Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass Console subscriptions will have access to the complete Black Ops 6 game.\n\nFor Game Pass Console subscribers, a Game Pass Core subscription is required to access online game modes (Multiplayer and Zombies).\n\nSubscriptions must be active in order to play."
