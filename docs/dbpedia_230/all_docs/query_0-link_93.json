        "text": "1 in 6 of the World's Children Live in a Conflict Zone\n\nIn 2022, 468 million children worldwide lived in areas affected by armed conflict. Nearly 200 million children are living in the world's most lethal war zones, the highest number in over a decade. Save the Children’s research shows that the increase in children living conflict zones has been fuelled by the war in Ukraine.\n\nChildren living in war-affected countries live in constant fear, experiencing grave violations of their rights, with serious impacts on their mental health. Many children living in lethal war zones are already at risk of climate change and facing unprecedented levels of hunger as well.\n\nToday, Save the Children is the world leader in protecting children from the physical and emotional wounds of war. We've helped more children in crisis recover and return to learning than any other global humanitarian organization. Your generous support makes this work possible. Make a one-time donation to the Children's Emergency Fund or join Team Tomorrow to connect with the causes you care about - like conflict- through your monthly donation.\n\nThe 10 most dangerous countries for children living in conflict\n\nSave the Children's report \"Stop the War on Children: The Forgotten Ones\" studied data from the 2022 report of the United Nations Secretary-General on children and armed conflict as well as the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) of children living in conflict zones to rank the 10 worst conflict-affected counties in which to be a child.\n\nA total of 2,985 children were killed across 24 countries in 2022. Data from Save the Children shows that the number of children reported killed in Gaza in just three weeks has surpassed the annual number of children killed across the world's conflict zones since 2019.\n\nWhat Is the Impact of Conflict on Children?\n\nToday, the nature of conflict – and its impact on children – is evolving. The world is witnessing deliberate campaigns of violence against civilians, including the targeting of schools, the abduction and enslavement of girls, and deliberate starvation.\n\nIn today’s armed conflicts, there is often no longer a clearly demarcated battlefield: children’s homes and schools are the battlefield.\n\nThe nature of conflict has changed, putting children in the frontline in new and terrible ways. Wars are lasting longer. They are more likely to be fought in urban areas amongst civilian populations leading to deaths and life-changing injuries, and laying waste to the infrastructure needed to guarantee access to food and water. Attacks on schools and hospitals are up.\n\nChildren are disproportionately suffering the consequences of these brutal trends.\n\nWe are seeing more children facing unimaginable mental and physical trauma.\n\nMore children are going hungry.\n\nMore children are falling victim to preventable diseases.\n\nMore children are out of school.\n\nMore children are at risk of sexual violence and recruitment by armed groups.\n\nMore children are trapped on the frontline without access to humanitarian aid.\n\nThe harm that is done to children in armed conflict is not only often more severe than that done to adults, it has longer lasting implications – for children themselves and for their societies.\n\nThe Distinctive Ways Children are Harmed by Armed Conflict\n\nChildren suffer in conflict in different ways than adults, partly because they are physically weaker and also because they have so much at stake – their physical, mental and psychosocial development are heavily dependent on the conditions they experience as children.\n\nConflict affects children differently depending on a number of personal characteristics, significantly gender and age, but also disability status, ethnicity, religion and whether they live in rural or urban locations."
