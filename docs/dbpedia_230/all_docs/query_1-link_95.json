        "text": "Post by agent817 on\n\nGranted the whole show was Raw, but back in the late-1990s to early-2000s (I'll get to another change), Raw would be the first hour and the second hour would be War Zone. They would be treated like different shows, especially with the name graphics being shown on the screen. Raw's would have a crosshair, whereas War Zone would have barbed wire. That was like that in 1997-1998 but when Raw changed the theme and graphics in late-1998, it wasn't much different except for the names used on the name graphics.\n\nI also must note that after late-2001, War Zone was changed to \"Raw Zone,\" and I read back then it was because of 9/11. It was like that during the 2000s, at least during the Ruthless Aggression Era.\n\nWas there supposed to be any difference?\n\nPost by Bob Schlapowitz on\n\nI think I was because they could get away with more after 10 PM.\n\nPost by Gecko on\n\nWasn't it to do with getting each hour treated as its own show for the ratings for some reason?\n\nPost by thecrusherwi on\n\nI think it was for ratings purposes for one. In 1997 prior to Nitro going to three hours, the War Zone was unopposed by Nitro. Also I believe Raw was TV-PG and the WarZone was TV-14.\n\nPost by The Summer of Muskrat XVII on\n\nI think it was for ratings purposes for one. In 1997 prior to Nitro going to three hours, the War Zone was unopposed by Nitro. Also I believe Raw was TV-PG and the WarZone was TV-14.\n\nYeah, it was totally a gimmick to artificially boost the ratings a little. I think it was done basically to try and lift USA’s average, I can’t remember exactly how the whole thing worked.\n\nPost by darbus alan on\n\nWasn't it to do with getting each hour treated as its own show for the ratings for some reason?\n\nYep. It was a clever way of manipulating the ratings so USA/Spike could charge ad rates per hour as they were technically considered two different shows. That way, the lower rated hour wouldn't bring down the ad rate for the higher rated hour in an average for the two.\n\nNowadays they drop all pretense of that, though they still rate each hour individually. Guess it was grandfathered in for Raw.\n\nPost by tafkaga on\n\nI always thought it was because Nitro started treating their second hour like a big deal with the countdown, fireworks and change of announce teams and Vince wanted to do something similar.\n\nPost by A Platypus Rave is Correct on\n\nI think I was because they could get away with more after 10 PM.\n\nfrom what I remember shows that started after 10 pm could get away with more stuff.\n\nSo Raw technically ended at 10 so they could do Warzone even though it was clearly the same show <_<\n\nalso the ratings thing\n\nPost by wildojinx on\n\nThey briefly gave War Zone its own theme, which was \"We're All Together Now\" from the Full Metal album (and RAW had \"Thorn in Your Eye\" from the same album).\n\nPost by lildude8218 on\n\nIt's similar to how Adult Swim went from a programming block on Cartoon Network to being labeled as its own network. Promoting a \"top rated network\" sounds better than a \"top rated block on a network.\"\n\nPost by Venti on\n\nWish they would do something like this again just to spice things up.\n\nRemember when they did the edgier looking Raw 3rd hour where the aesthetic was a little darker and more low key? And it lasted like 2 weeks. I actually loved that and wished it stuck around.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nWish they would do something like this again just to spice things up.\n\nRemember when they did the edgier looking Raw 3rd hour where the aesthetic was a little darker and more low key?
