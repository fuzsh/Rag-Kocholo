        "text": "The new Warzone 2 map, Al Mazrah, is broken up into six sectors with different landscapes in each one, from desert ranges to cityscapes and more. The varying terrain and locations means that whether you're in Warzone 2, the DMZ, or even fighting in specific areas in Modern Warfare 2, it's important to know what you're getting into and what you can expect from Al Mazrah's different areas and regions.\n\nFor that reason, we've compiled all the most important detail about each of the sectors below, so when asked \"where we dropping\", you'll have a good answer with a good explanation. Here's everything you need to know about the Warzone 2 map of Al Mazrah, with its different sectors, locations and POIs laid clear.\n\nFull Warzone 2 Al Mazrah map\n\nThe Warzone 2 map setting of Al Mazrah features a huge area to explore and a variety of terrain types to fight across, from wide open deserts to crowded towns. It is divided up into six Sectors we'll list below with an overview of what to expect from each area.\n\nWarzone 2 map Sector 1, Northwest Al Mazrah\n\nOasis\n\nTaraq Village\n\nWestern Foothills\n\nRohan Oil Refinery\n\nAl Safwa Quarry\n\nThe northwest corner of the Warzone 2 map contains various oases and ancient ruins, which look nice but offer little protection, while the abandoned Taraq Village to the east of the Sector provides tight areas for small scale combat. To the southeast the Rohan Oil Refinery burns, and the scalable Processing Tanks give a handy position for sniper overwatch while the offices and worker housing can be looted. Al Safwa Quarry is in the southwest of the Sector, providing a mixture of open combat areas and winding industrial buildings, though the maze of marble blocks in the staging area nearby can be used for tense showdowns.\n\nWarzone 2 map Sector 2, Northeast Al Mazrah\n\nNorth Industrial\n\nWestern Outskirts\n\nAl Mazrah City\n\nEastern Outskirts\n\nSouthern Outskirts\n\nZarqwa Hydroelectric\n\nMawizeh Marshlands\n\nEast Suburbs\n\nSector 2 of the Warzone 2 map is the biggest and most built up, featuring industrial areas, a large dam, and Al Mazrah City. On the north side you'll find plenty of warehouses to explore, along with several electrical towers that can be climbed to get a better view over the surrounding area. Head into central Al Mazrah City for plenty of facilities and multistorey buildings to ascend, including the Channel 7 TV Tower and the US Embassy, while the surrounding outskirts offer smaller suburbs and settlements to investigate. To the southwest lies Zarqwa Hydroelectric, which includes a dam, power facility, various bridges, plus a military checkpoint to raid.\n\nWarzone 2 map Sector 3, West Al Mazrah\n\nSattiq Cave Complex\n\nHafid Port\n\nSa'id City\n\nTowards the east side of the Sector lies the Sattiq Cave Complex, a series of underground tunnels beneath the town where you can sneak around undetected or engage in running battles within the caves. To the west you have Hafid Port, a dockside area filled with warehouses and containers, along with a jetty you can follow out to board a huge container ship. Then there's Sa'id City along the river to the south, with a giant decaying shopping mall, abandoned soccer stadium, and even the creepy remains of a fairground to explore, along with narrow streets lined with shops and apartments to navigate.\n\nWarzone 2 map Sector 4, Zaya Observatory and Mountains\n\nNorthwest Mountain\n\nZaya Observatory\n\nAl Sharim Pass\n\nAhkdar Village\n\nSector 4 on the Warzone 2 map is dominated by mountains and winding trails making for slow progress, though there are ascenders dotted around to help you take shortcuts. The standout structures are the radar dome and telescopes to the west, and although you can't climb up all of them from the inside, they are open at the roof to allow access when landing from above. Heading east will bring you to tiered farmlands that can lead to multilevel combat, and in the settlement you'll find several towers to provide sightlines over the surrounding area. Down in Ahkdar Village to the south is an ancient walled settlement featuring a bazaar, apartments, ornate archways and winding walkways, with lots of rooftops to allow vertical combat.\n\nWarzone 2 map Sector 5, Southwest Al Mazrah\n\nEl Samman Cemetery\n\nSawah Village\n\nThe northeast of this Sector is dominated by the El Samman Cemetery, a wide open space for ranged combat where only the dilapidated mausoleums and gravestones provide any protection. Surrounding that are various residential areas and a market, which give more cover and an opportunity to target enemies passing through the exposed location. Heading southwest leads you to the flooded Sawah Village, where most of the main streets are underwater so quiet movement will be much more difficult, and there are several oil tankers that have run aground and are ready for exploring.\n\nWarzone 2 map Sector 6, South Al Mazrah\n\nSarrif Bay\n\nAl Malik Airport\n\nAl Bagra Fortress\n\nThe final area on the Warzone 2 map is Sector 6, which features several significant structures in Al Mazrah. Sarrif Bay to the west includes an extensive holiday resort with tents and a swimming pool, along with hotels and residential buildings to search for loot. In the east is Al Malik Airport, with a damaged runway and an expansive terminal building to explore, plus a control tower that provides a great sniper overview of the whole landmark. Al Bagra Fortress to the south is a giant medieval walled city that was recently converted to a museum, and the large interior space coupled with surrounding narrow passageways and a maze of underground tunnels offers a variety of combat encounters."
