        "text": "This experience is 9 days and includes BVG train passes so you can explore all of Berlin, even when you're not on a tour.\n\nThe package also includes:\n\n- Round trip non-stop 1st class ICE high speed train tickets to Nuremberg, Germany\n\n- All airport and train station transportation\n\n- Hotels in the best areas for exploring both cities\n\n- Some meals\n\n- The best tours of the most important and interesting places of WW1, WW2 and Cold War history\n\n(Contact us directly if you would prefer more or fewer nights, we'll be happy to create a special package just for you!)\n\nYou think Berlin’s all about WWII and currywurst?\n\nWell, it is, but there’s so much more! Take in the unique underground scene of Berlin, from amazing street art and great local stories to cool neighborhoods and alternative vibes. See the city through the eyes of a local and experience the lifestyle they’re all used to.\n\nStart your vacation by discovering the ‘Story of Berlin’ in a performance art masterpiece of sight and sound. Using pictures and music, renowned sand-artist Natalya Netselya narrates the history of Berlin, highlighting the city’s stories and wonders. Marvel at the unique interaction of lights, shadows, sand and music — a visual tour of Berlin that’s universally understood without any words.\n\nTake a look at what life was like behind the Iron Curtain while taking a walking tour along the trail of the Berlin Wall. Trace the wall’s former route through the city’s center with an expert, 20th-century historian, learning the meaning behind its construction, the realities of living in a divided city and the account of its eventual fall. See surviving sections of the wall and stop to visit the memorials, exhibits, landmarks and street art — a comprehensive account of life before, during and after the Berlin Wall.\n\nPack an overnight bag!\n\nWe know that packing and unpacking your things and traveling from place to place can be stressful. There's no need for that on this vacation! You can leave your things in your hotel room and just pack a light bag for your trip to Nuremberg, Germany!\n\nYou'll see the countryside of Bavaria as it speeds past you at speeds of over 100mph.\n\nThis art and history filled vacation wouldn't be complete without a trip to Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nRoam through the city’s Old Town, admiring the beautiful timber-framed houses and cobblestone streets. Marvel at the massive City Walls of Old Town Nuremberg. Along the way, learn about the history of this beautiful and prosperous city — as the center of the Holy Roman Empire, to the days of the German Renaissance, the Temple City of the Third Reich, and the home to both the Nazi rallies and Nuremberg Trials.\n\nShortly after the beginning of WW2, a shelter unique in Germany was created under extremely difficult conditions in the old rock cellars - former beer cellars directly under the Imperial Castle. Irretrievable art treasures were to be protected here from fire, smoke, gas and pillaging and secured for generations to come. The treasures sheltered here in the bomb-proof cellars included famous Nuremberg attractions such as the Annunciation by Veit Stoß from St Lawrence's Church, the Imperial Insignia and the \"Clockwork Men\" from Our Lady's on the Main Market Square. Today, large parts of the original fittings in the Art Shelter can still be seen, including the guards' rooms.\n\nAnd since no trip to Bavaria can be complete without tasting the authentic food and world renown beers, you'll enjoy a food tour and a one of a kind beer crawl.\n\nIn Germany there are 1,284 breweries and more than half of them (618) brew their beer in Bavaria and 201 of them in Upper Franconia (just outside of Nuremberg, Germany). And…73 of the 201 Upper Franconian breweries are located in the Franconian Switzerland region (in Upper Franconia) which makes it the largest concentration of breweries in the world. But wait, it gets better…according to the Guinness Book of Records, the small village of Aufsess in Franconian Switzerland, as measured by its number of inhabitants (1,400), has the highest brewery density (four breweries) in the entire world!\n\nYou'll end the vacation with some extra options (subject to availability) , choose one, choose both, choose none!\n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nSpend a night out at one of the most famous sites in Berlin with “An Evening at Charlottenburg Palace,” a dinner and concert experience with the Berlin Residence Orchestra, plus a tour of the palace. Enjoy a 3-course candlelight dinner in the Palace Orangery. Then take in the classical sounds of the Berlin Residence Orchestra, performing selections from Bach, Handel, Mozart and more.\n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nOn your final night in Berlin, you have the option to celebrate your visit to Berlin with a sky-high meal in the clouds during this VIP dinner 679 feet (207 meters) above the city at Sphere, the Berlin TV Tower's revolving restaurant. Enjoy skip-the-line access to the tallest building in Berlin, where you'll sit down to a VIP dinner. Savor a delicious 2-course dinner at a guaranteed window-seat table, accompanied by three wines, and soak up the incredible vistas of nearby Berlin landmarks such as Charlottenburg Palace and Checkpoint Charlie."
