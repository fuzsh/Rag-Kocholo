        "text": "Rebirth Island began life as Alcatraz—the prison island that it’s based on—back in Blackout, the very first Call Of Duty battle royale. That’s when the Resurgence mode was created, giving battle royale its best twist to this day.\n\nIn Resurgence, you continue to respawn so long as someone else in your squad is alive. This creates a faster, more enjoyable gameplay loop than normal battle royale (in my opinion) and makes it less tedious if you’re killed. The Resurgence mechanic turns off at the end-game and the handful of remaining squads or players battle it out to claim victory.\n\nRebirth Island was brought back in the original Warzone and immediately became my squad’s preferred mode. We played it like crazy and were pleasantly surprised when Fortune’s Keep joined the roster—a change was good. Then Activision killed both maps at the launch of Warzone 2.0 and didn’t bring Resurgence back at all until Ashika Island, which was fun but not as good as either of the previous two maps. Vondel came next, and it’s a terrific map, but quite a bit larger than any other Resurgence maps.\n\nThen in Season 2 of the current year of Warzone, Fortune’s Keep returned and this season—Season 3—Rebirth has made its glorious comeback. Both maps are terrific, but there’s something special about Rebirth Island. It’s incredibly nostalgic to be back at the Bioweapons Lab, fighting over Command Center, or landing at “the spot” as we affectionately call it—an unnamed location that generally has good loot and can be a good spot to move from.\n\nNot a ton has changed about Rebirth Island, unlike Fortune’s Keep which had a bunch of changes, destroyed areas and new tunnel systems. The main thing is that in this game you can swim in water, and some new areas have opened up that allow aquatic exploration.\n\nIt also looks terrific. It’s a massive improvement over the original map and even over the Reloaded version, though some areas—like Chemical Engineering—have had textural overhauls that make them strikingly different. The first time I was underneath Chemical, the changes to the area made me think we were at a totally new location for a moment.\n\nOverall, it’s been a blast. Which is why I’m a little confused by two posts over at Dexerto.\n\nThe first informs us that players are upset by the map because it’s “super sweaty”—aka, intense matches with very aggressive players—which is funny, because all these maps can be sweaty and of course the brand new map is going to attract all the most committed players at launch. It’s not the map’s fault. I got four wins playing Rebirth on Wednesday when the season launched (spread out among various members of my Call Of Duty squad, as we tend to cycle players throughout the day). There was some very tense matches, but playing against good squads makes things fun, and victory taste all the sweeter.\n\nPlus I had this clutch moment at the end of our second W:\n\nJacob Hale writes:\n\nClearly there is some frustration from players who were hoping to have some easy-going games with their friends for the first time in almost two years on Rebirth Island.\n\nOf course, with Skill-based Matchmaking (SBMM), there’s always going to be some element of ‘sweatiness’ in the game as you’re matched up against opponents of a similar skill level, so you’re unlikely to get an easy ride through matches regardless.\n\nSBMM is a controversial subject. It’s designed to keep players of a similar skill level in matches together, rather than have the sweatiest players out there up against complete potatoes. But even without it, the release of Rebirth was going to be like this and anyone who wanted “easy-going games” isn’t playing the right game to begin with.\n\nThe second post at Dexerto is the one I find most baffling. Headlined “Warzone’s return to Rebirth Island is a nostalgia trip for all the wrong reasons” Shane Black argues that the map “is off to a rough start thanks to bugs, connection issues, and the “sweats” taking over the map.”\n\nThe launch of a new season usually does come with some issues and glitches, and many past Call Of Duty seasons (or game launches) have been a nightmare. But I’ve experienced none of these. None of my regular gaming group has, either. If anything, in Ranked play it seems to be working much more smoothly than last season on Fortune’s Keep.\n\nYes, there are sweats “taking over the map” but again: I got for W’s on Wednesday. I am far from the best Call Of Duty player in the world. Playing against better players means you have to get good, learn how to coordinate, and lose matches most of the time. Learn from your mistakes. Work as a team. Stop complaining all the time and hone your skills.\n\nThis next passage is just bizarre. Black notes a few of the bugs players have encountered, quoting some of the glitches and installation issues players have complained about on social media and forums. He then writes:\n\nBut for those who are able to make it through and play Warzone, the return to Rebirth Island is an underwhelming experience as the most competitive and toxic players, known as “sweats,” have infiltrated the map out of the gate.\n\nSweat isn’t the only salty liquid bodies produce—and this just sounds like tears. Sure, we all grumble about the “sweats” but guess what? When you’re stomping another team they’re calling you a sweat (or a cheater or a camper or whatever).\n\nBeing “sweaty” doesn’t mean you’re toxic, either. That’s not the definition of “sweat”. Sure, some sweaty players can be toxic (so can terrible players) but others can be totally chill and cool.\n\nAnd yes, there are some cheaters out there. There was a pretty blatant aimbot we encountered in one match. But these are not issues with the map. If you have a problem with sweats, the real problem is with yourself. You need to get better so that you can be sweaty, too. Unless we just want games that aren’t competitive at all, iun which case go play Stardew Valley or something. This is a competitive shooter. Get good or get off the field. It takes time and practice, and with SBMM it means that the better you get, the better your opponents will get. So you have to keep getting better. Ride or die.\n\n“Just looking through social media shows that this has been a less-than-nostalgic return to one of Warzone’s most popular maps among fans,” writes Black. Oh yeah? That’s the barometer we’re using now? People crying on social media about a video game means that the map’s launch is a huge letdown? As far as I can tell, this is just clickbait.\n\nI also find posts that merely quote random people on forums and social media the most laziest of them all. How about you tell us what you think of the map, not what a bunch of randoms think? What is your experience? Or interview some pros or experts. Anything—anything—other than parroting randoms on social media and saying the launch was “bad”. Give me a break.\n\nI’ve had a blast with Rebirth Island so far. Yeah, it’s been sweaty, which I was expecting because I wasn’t born yesterday, and we’ve had a lot of near misses and a couple bad matches. Lots of 2nd and 3rd places. Some teams are better than us, no doubt. Some we crush like bugs. That’s what keeps it fun."
