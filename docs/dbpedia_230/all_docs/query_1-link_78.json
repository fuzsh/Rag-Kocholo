Then you grab your fully charged phone and head to school to catch up with your friends before the first bell.\n\nThis may sound like just another ordinary day in your life. But in Ukraine, where war has raged for two years, many teens can only dream of this kind of normalcy. Thatâs because nearly every aspect of their lives was turned upside down on February 24, 2022.Â\n\nEarly that morning, Russia launched a full-scale assault on Ukraine. Missiles rained down on Ukrainian military bases and cities, and Russian troops and tanks poured into the Eastern European nation from the north and east. The Ukrainian military was immediately deployed. The two sides have been fighting within Ukraine ever since (see \"Why Did Russia Invade Ukraine?\", below).\n\nWhat is a typical morning like for you?

But in Ukraine, many teens can only dream of this kind of normalcy. War has raged there for two years. Nearly every part of their lives was turned upside down on February 24, 2022.\n\nEarly that morning, Russia launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Missiles rained down on Ukrainian military bases and cities. And Russian troops and tanks poured into the Eastern European nation from the north and east. The Ukrainian military was immediately deployed. The two sides have been fighting within Ukraine ever since (see \"Why Did Russia Invade Ukraine?,\" below).\n\nThe ongoing conflict has caused great suffering. Roughly 200,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed or wounded in the fighting as of this past fall. And at least 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, according to the United Nations (U.N.). In addition, about 6 million people have fled the country to escape the violence.\n\nFor the 37 million residents who remain in Ukraine, nearly half needed urgent humanitarian aid, such as food and shelter, as of this past December. At times, families have had to make do without heat and electricity, and millions of students have been shut out of classrooms. In addition, countless others are staying isolated at home for safety, leaving them disconnected from friends and family.\n\nHow are the children and teens of Ukraine coping?

That leaves them disconnected from friends and family.\n\nHow are the children and teens of Ukraine coping? Turn the page to learn about some of the challenges they face because of the warâand how they are overcoming them.\n\nArtem Korsun, 18, is a college student at a university in Kyiv, Ukraineâs capital. But Kyiv is frequently targeted by air strikes, so Artem now takes his classes online from his hometown of Korostyshiv, which is somewhat safer.\n\nStill, the stress of the war has taken its toll on Artem. And the fact that he canât be around his peers at school has made it worse, eliminating the moments of connection that once brightened his days.\n\nâEven [if the] missiles donât kill me, they still strike the inner part of me that wants to live, not just exist,â he says.\n\nArtem is not alone. Studies show that the loss and disruption caused by war make people more prone to mental health problemsâparticularly children and teens, who thrive on routine. An estimated 1.5 million young people in Ukraine are at risk of depression and other mental health issues because of the war, according to the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (Unicef).\n\nWhatâs more, experts say that people who live in war zones are often under constant stress. They may have witnessed loved ones being injured or killed, or they may have lost their homes.\n\nArtem recognized that many of his peers in Ukraine likely felt like he didâor worseâso he decided to take action. In October 2022, he helped establish a youth center in Korostyshiv. The space provides a place for teens to connect.\n\nArtem helped set up the youth center through a Unicef initiative called Upshift. The program provides teens with skills and funding to help solve problems in their communities.Â\n\nAbout 200 teens now use the center to study and play games. They also do art therapy, which experts say can help people process difficult emotions.Â\n\nBut most important to Artem, many teens are making new friends thereâincluding him.\n\nâWe still need to socialize,â he says. âHaving someone you can talk to is crucial during such challenging times. You realize that youâre not alone.â\n\nArtem Korsun is 18. He is a college student at a university in Kyiv, Ukraineâs capital. But Kyiv is often targeted by air strikes.

When they returned a few months later, their house had been destroyed.\n\nThe family found a new place to live in Irpin, but their crisis was not over. With winter coming, Russia began attacking Ukraineâs infrastructure (the basic systems and structures that help a country function). Thousands of missiles and drones struck power plants across the nation, knocking out electricity, heat, and hot water for millions. Suddenly, much of Ukraineâincluding Irpinâwas plunged into frigid darkness.\n\nBut Vladyslavâs family happened to have a generator. That is a device that can convert fuel into electricity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that generators are âas important as armorâ when it comes to protecting residents.Â\n\nVladyslav used his generator for warmth and even to study. âTo charge a phone, we have to switch on the generator,â he said. âOur teachers send us homework [over an app].â\n\nSince that first winter at war, most of Ukraineâs infrastructure has been repaired. But when this issue went to press, winter was setting in once againâand Russia was ramping up attacks on Ukraineâs power plants.\n\nHowever, people around the world are rallying to help. The U.S. has sent Ukraine weapons to shoot down Russian drones. And aid groups are donating generators and warm clothes.Â\n\nEven teens are stepping up. In British Columbia, Canada, students at Oak Bay High School recently learned how Ukrainians suffer during winter. That inspired them to take part in a community fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $20,000 to buy two generators for Ukrainians.\n\nRegen Wharran, a 10th-grader involved with the effort, is determined to succeed.Â\n\nâAs long as we get the word out,â she told reporters, âwe can come together and do this.âÂ\n\n*Last name withheld for privacy\n\nVladyslav,* 16, and his family left their home in Irpin in the spring of 2022.

An underground train is rumbling past, just feet away from the class. But Alina doesnât mind.Â\n\nThe eighth-grader is one of about 1,000 students in Kharkiv, Ukraine, who attend school belowground âin a subway station. Education officials created the voluntary program at the start of this school year as a way to get students back into classrooms while still protecting them from the near-constant threat of Russian air strikes.\n\nKharkiv, with about 1.4 million people, is less than 25 miles from the Russian border. A missile from Russia can reach the city in less than a minuteânot enough time for students in aboveground classrooms to race to bomb shelters. For this reason, all in-person learning in Kharkiv was effectively canceled when the war began.\n\nAcross Ukraine, education systems are facing similar challenges. According to the U.N., more than 1,300 of the countryâs 17,000 schools have been destroyed. Thousands of others have been damaged. Unicef estimates that more than 5 million students in Ukraine have fallen behind academically, in part because many of them no longer have access to in-person learning.Â\n\nTo address the crisis in Kharkiv, officials there built dozens of classrooms in five subway stations. The learning spaces are set up near where trains arrive and depart. Students in grades 1 through 11 attend the classes in person two or three days a week. The rest of the time, they continue their learning from home.Â\n\nMany experts say in-person learning is critical during a war. A classroom setting allows students to better grasp the material, and it gives young people an opportunity to be with their peers. It also provides a sense of routine amid great uncertainty. Yet only about one-third of Ukrainian kids and teens are able to attend school in person full-time.\n\nAlina, 14, is happy to be inside a classroom. âI wanted to go back to school for a long time,â she told reporters. âThere are [other teens] to talk to, and you see the teacher in person.â\n\nYegor Rastorgui, an 11th-grader, agrees. âAfter two years of online classes, itâs really nice to come here and see peopleâs eyes.â\n\nEvery so often during the school day, the walls of Alina Barsukâs classroom vibrate.
