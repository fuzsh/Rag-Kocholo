        "text": "We all have them, those areas in our cities or towns deemed “rough” or “dangerous” by many. Those neighborhoods we sometimes drive through that prompt us to immediately lock our doors. One area considered “bad” by many in Albuquerque (New Mexico’s largest city) is The War Zone. Located in South East Albuquerque between the Foothills and Nob Hill, it is home to one of the most diverse communities in the city. As a result of the many characteristics that The War Zone has, it is often perceived in a negative way, when in reality, The War Zone does not differ that much from the rest of the city. We only consider the belief of the place and not the reality of it.\n\n“However, there is much more to The War Zone than just violence and crime, and at times, it has something that not all neighborhoods have (a sense of community).”\n\nThe War Zone has always been considered “ghetto” or “dangerous”. This reputation comes from a long history of drug, gang, and crime problems that has existed throughout its past. However, there is much more to The War Zone than just violence and crime, and at times, it has something that not all neighborhoods have (a sense of community). This is not only because they live in the same area, but because they can all relate to each other as they are all living in the same conditions and many are going through the same problems. Most importantly, many people there have a similar identity. Most of the families in the War Zone are minorities with a low socio-economic status. Thus, people categorize and even stereotype these families. Even though people characterize The War Zone’s residents by the events that take place there, those events do not define who they are.\n\nThe War Zone’s inhabitants are very similar to the people of “nicer” areas; they are people who are just trying to better themselves. Unfortunately, they live in areas that suffer from many problems like poverty, drugs, and theft, which adds to the false perception and takes away from the real reality of The War Zone. No area or neighborhood is perfect, bad people exist everywhere, and in Albuquerque, crime is present almost evenly throughout the city, not just in areas like The War Zone.\n\n“This might be a result of the media’s portrayal of the city through shows such as Breaking Bad and others.”\n\nAt one point, many considered Albuquerque as one of the cities with the highest percentage of crime per capital, and to this day, people from around the country keep up an idea that Albuquerque is a dangerous city with a drug and crime problem. This might be a result of the media’s portrayal of the city through shows such as Breaking Bad and others. However, it would be unfair to assume that those shows are a realistic description of the city. Likewise, it would be unfair to assume that the city is dangerous and that when driving through Albuquerque one should lock their doors. The same could be said of The War Zone, one should not assume that the common perception is at all correct, but in fact, could be considered about the same, when compared to the rest of the city.\n\nBackground Information\n\nThe War Zone dates back to the 1940s when Route 66 was in its prime and the nearby Kirtland Airforce Base demanded plenty of employees. However, as interstate highways replaced Route 66 and as Kirtland’s workforce reduced so did the housing demand, employment, and economy of the neighboring area drop. The area was later settled by many migrants from around the world. At a later time, the area was plagued by crime and violence. Therefore, the area was dubbed “The War Zone”.\n\nThe War Zone is nestled in South East Albuquerque parallel to historic Route 66. It is home to many abandoned homes and\n\napartment complexes. However, The War Zone is also home to many beautiful homes and iconic landmarks. For example, Iconic stores like Fair N Square and Talin Market are found in the area.\n\nOne will not find a Starbucks or Target anywhere around the area, but rather small locally owned shops. There is also a strong presence of Native-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Asian-Americans, and African-Americans. This might be why city officials have decided to rename the area The International District. Unfortunately, many have taken offense to this new name that the city has decided on.\n\nIs the name any better than the earlier? Perhaps, but to many it is insulting or unrepresentative and according to many, the name classifies and stereotypes the people. One of those people is Jamar Emedaniel. Emedaniel “grew up” in The War Zone and has always felt a sense of community there. According to Emedaniel, the most challenging thing about the area is how difficult it is to “escape” or get out of the area. If it were up to him he would live in a “better” area, but this place is also his home where he grew up. Emedaniel hopes that there would be a larger investment in the community. After visiting the nearby community center, I could not agree more. Compared to the Community Center in my neighborhood, it is clear that their community center is not as funded or cared for even though they are at a nine-minute driving distance from each other.\n\n“People think that we are all criminals,” said Emedaniel. “When I mention where I live, they immediately stereotype me”. People like Emedaniel may not live in the same neighborhood, and the areas might slightly vary, but as Emedaniel said: “We are no different from the people of the ‘nicer’ areas”.\n\nPeople might say that no one is to blame for this issue. However, physical barriers, like the one pictured above, at intersections that can “stop fleeing criminals” are mainly only found in The War Zone and serve only as metaphorical barriers between us and them.\n\n“Highland High School – a school where girls get pregnant and where boys party and do drugs.”\n\nHighland High School is home to many high school students in The War Zone. Highland High School has a reputation for being “easy”, “dangerous”, and a school where girls get pregnant and where boys party and do drugs. Even though there might be some truth to these claim, one would be foolish to assume that these events are only specific to this school. When in reality, kids use drugs at even the “best” private schools in town. These events are highlighted in this school because of the area in which it is, The War Zone. Therefore, much like Highland and other schools in the city, we must not stereotype or classify a neighborhood and assume that illicit activities are only specific to certain places.\n\nAnecdotes\n\nOne day my family and I were passing through the area when we saw dozens of people from around the neighborhood working together with the crew from the Extreme Makeover Home Edition show to build and renovate three buildings to help the community. These people came together to help build a beautiful house for someone who attempted to change “The War Zone”.\n\n“When I mention where I live, they immediately stereotype me”.\n\n“People think that we are all criminals,” said Emedaniel. “When I mention where I live, they immediately stereotype me”. People like Emedaniel may not live in the same neighborhood, and the areas might slightly vary, but as Emedaniel said: “We are no different from the people of the ‘nicer’ areas”.\n\n“In order to solve this problem, we must first get rid of the stereotypes and names that surround these places.”\n\nConclusion\n\nOne day someone decides to call you by something other than your name, maybe a nickname or a label. This name sticks and suddenly you become that name. You get called by that name so much and for so long that you start to believe that this is your name and you embody this name. You fall victim to this name. There is obviously a problem in our cities’ “war zones”, but we must not just try to ignore it or try to “rebrand” them as if there is nothing wrong. We must open our eyes and see that our cities’ “war zones” have a problem. In order to solve this problem, we must first get rid of the stereotypes and names that surround these places. These places are not very different from any other neighborhood or area in our cities, they have just fallen victim to a crude, obsolete, and irrelevant label. Let’s get rid of these titles or names, but in a respectable, history honoring way. Remember “The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit” (Proverbs 18:21).\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
