        "text": "Welcome to Paradise\n\n“I knew one thing for certain: the world would never be ready for what I found.” — Captain Butcher, Call of Duty: Vanguard\n\nOut of the fall, a threat continues to rise on a new front.\n\nAs the Allied Forces focus on ending World War II hostilities, Captain Butcher gets the green light to begin a top-secret campaign known as Operation Vulcan.\n\nVanguard — Special Operations Task Force (S.O.T.F. 001) — only delayed the inevitable with Operation Phoenix, as Axis scientists and leaders fled to the South Pacific. The four core forces from Vanguard – Hellhounds, Sentinel, Barbarian, and Shadow — were strong, but none of them, even within the Pacific, had enough intel on this uncharted island known as Caldera.\n\nEnter S.O.T.F. 006: Trident.\n\nWith their respective elite backgrounds combined, and the winter trade winds at their back, all three members of Trident and Captain Butcher charted a course for Caldera. Unbeknownst to them, the Axis were prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft on sight with anti-air guns stationed on Caldera’s beaches, taking down Butcher’s pride and joy while splitting him from his newly recruited forces.\n\nDespite counterattacks, Trident survived and regrouped with Captain Butcher, who happened to land right on whatever the Axis were hiding…\n\nRise on a new front and discover this secret in Season One of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Pacific, a massive island-sized introduction to another incredible year for Call of Duty — complete with free weapons, maps, Operators, and more content, especially for Vanguard owners.\n\nSeason One will begin on December 8, following updates to Vanguard and Warzone. Vanguard’s update is scheduled for December 6 at 9 PM PT. Warzone will schedule its update for when it shuts down its servers from December 7 at 9 PM PT to December 8 at 9 AM PT to prepare for Warzone Pacific.\n\nFrom all the free content across Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone Pacific, to new innovations within the Battle Pass system and 24 hours of exclusive access to the new Caldera map for Vanguard owners in Warzone Pacific, this is everything you need to know for Season One:\n\nVANGUARD AND WARZONE OVERVIEW\n\n- Vanguard Owners Drop in on December 8. Play the new Pacific map, Caldera, a day early by owning Call of Duty: Vanguard. Rebirth Island will remain live during this time for all other players.\n\n- The Battle Pass: The Best Value Gets Better. Three functional weapons, two Multiplayer Perks, new Equipment in Vanguard, as well as other unprecedented free items in Tiers and dozens of other items in the full Battle Pass.\n\n- Tips of the Three-Pronged Spear. S.O.T.F. Trident is prepared to pierce through the Pacific, with Francis “Kai” Lanakila arriving first with the Season One Battle Pass.\n\n24-Hour Exclusive Access to Caldera\n\nThere’s still time to be the first to drop into Caldera, the brand-new map launching with Warzone Pacific.\n\nPurchase Call of Duty: Vanguard before December 8 to participate in a 24-hour Caldera exclusive access event in Warzone Pacific, which begins on December 8 at 9 AM PT. Digital copies of Vanguard come with immediate access to Caldera during its 24-hour exclusivity period, while those who purchase a physical version must install and boot Vanguard and get past the initial interactive screen to gain access to this Warzone Pacific event.\n\nMore intel about Caldera can be found in our overview blog here.\n\nPrepare for a Whole New War with the Battle Pass\n\nTime to restock that arsenal for the Pacific.\n\nThe Season One Battle Pass for Vanguard and Warzone is set to offer a new standard in value, both within the free Battle Pass System and the full Battle Pass containing access to up to 100 Tiers. During Season One, you can earn plenty by just playing the game, and you’ll get even more value by picking up the full Battle Pass:\n\n- Three Free Functional Weapons. Two New Perks. New Equipment. All Free. Period.\n\n- Over 30 Free Items, Including Some for Clans. 300 COD Points, Weapon Blueprints, and more. Earn even more items by joining a Clan with friends, then party up to get that 10% global XP boost.\n\n- Trident’s First Operator: Francis “Kai” Lanakila. Here for a good time, not a long time. Purchase the Battle Pass to unlock him immediately at Tier 0.\n\n- A “Battleprepped” Legendary Skin, Free with Battle Pass Bundle. Pick up the Battle Pass Bundle to get access to all 100 Tiers, skip ahead to Tier 20, and grab a menacing new skin for Polina.\n\nIntroducing S.O.T.F. Trident, Led by Francis “Kai” Lanakila at Tier 0\n\nWhen Butcher needed to hunt down the Axis on Caldera, Francis “Kai” Lanakila was the first man he called… even if he likes to show off just as much as hotshot pilot Wade Jackson.\n\nAs passionate in battle as he is for food, friends, and thrills, Francis learns quickly from mistakes and knows to move on to the bigger missions ahead. He fights to help others in need… but he always wants to make sure he looks good doing it.\n\nHis favorite weapon is the Cooper Carbine, one of the three new weapons within the Season One Battle Pass. Use it to rank up quicker through this 20-level Operator XP progression path, which includes XP bonuses, two new Skins, and a tasty “Kalua” Pork Weapon Charm among other rewards.\n\nFrancis and his default “Kingdom” Operator Skin are automatically unlocked at Tier 0 with purchase of the Season One Battle Pass.\n\nPLUS: Bundle Bonus Skin, Other Instant Rewards\n\nTier 0 also offers these instant rewards upon Battle Pass purchase:\n\n- “Alleyway” Arthur Kingsley Skin. Dive into the Pacific prepared for the heat with this new Skin for Vanguard’s leader.\n\n- Season One XP Boost. Enjoy a 10% increase on Player XP throughout Season One.\n\n- 45-Minute Double Weapon XP Token. Level up those new armaments faster with this token.\n\nThose who want to get access to up to 100 Tiers of the Battle Pass — and do so with a head start — have another reason to pick up the Battle Pass Bundle: the Legendary “Battleprepped” Operator Skin for sharpshooter Polina Petrova. Although the gas mask is not functional against Caldera’s circle collapse, your presence will be even more menacing to those trying to escape it while wearing this gear.\n\nLater This Season: Trident’s Reinforcements Lewis Howard and Isabella Rosario Dulnuan Reyes\n\nAn American hybrid rifle with SMG-like properties, the Cooper Carbine is a short-range Assault Rifle that’s easy to control with a fast fire rate.\n\nIt could best be compared to the Automaton, another popular fast-firing Assault Rifle that community members have gravitated toward since launch. By default, the Cooper Carbine has a slightly slower rate of fire, shorter effective range, and a bit more horizontal recoil, but in exchange offers better damage per shot, quicker centering speed, and a bigger default magazine.\n\nDive into the Gunsmith, and you’ll find attachments that can boost its rate of fire past 1,000 rpm, put its damage into three-shot elimination territory in Multiplayer, or provide a 60-round drum magazine that fully commits this weapon to its SMG roots.\n\nExpect it to be a solid midrange option for Warzone Pacific and Multiplayer, or as an Overkill backup to the other ranged weapon in the Battle Pass system.\n\nGorenko Anti-Tank Rifle: Sniper Rifle (Launch, Tier 31 of Battle Pass System)\n\nThe Gorenko is going to hit enemies hard.\n\nA heavy semi-automatic rifle, the Gorenko offers the most damage per shot of any ballistics-based weapon, capable of one-shotting any enemy in Multiplayer with ease. Even though it is semiauto, follow-up shots may be hard to take due to the incredible kick its high-caliber bullets produce.\n\nThis can be remedied with some available barrel attachments, or those who can somehow tame it could bump up the fire rate and Aim Down Sight speed for a wildly aggressive sniping Loadout.\n\nAs the only weapon of its kind in Vanguard, it fills a unique role when facing foes. However, in Warzone Pacific, the Gorenko could rival similar sniper rifles from other Call of Duty titles and may wind up being the go-to long-range option for top players in tough trials and competitions.\n\nSawtooth: Melee (Launch, Tier 37 of Battle Pass System)\n\nOver 120 items are yours to unlock through the free Battle Pass System and all 100 Battle Pass Tiers in Season One, including several Tiers that stack two-for-one rewards with one exclusive for Vanguard and one to use across both Vanguard and Warzone.\n\nThese items include Highlight Intros and Killcam Vanities, the latter of which wraps a fancy or gnarly border effect around an enemy as they see their demise. But when it comes to making those highlights and looking good while doing it, you’re going to need some new Weapon Blueprints and Operator Skins.\n\nWeapon Blueprints\n\nThose looking to bolster their Loadouts will want to grab over a dozen Weapon Blueprints across the Battle Pass, including the following:\n\nThe Season One Battle Pass ends with an explosion of Legendary content, starting with the “Hold the Line” Weapon Blueprint for the new Sniper Rifle within the Battle Pass, available at Tier 95.\n\nFollowing some more Legendary items in the next few Tiers — including 100 COD Points for free at Tier 98 — your reward for reaching Tier 100 is worthy of a true warrior:\n\n- “Awoken” Legendary Francis Skin. Don the mask of a fearsome fire legend with this Legendary Skin, designed for the first Trident Operator to the fight.\n\n- “Harvester” Legendary Assault Rifle Blueprint. A 10-attachment configuration for the new short-ranged Assault Rifle, the Harvester is all about pumping out hard-hitting damage against enemies and their technology with great speed and agility.\n\n- Title, Emblem, and Charm. Let the lobby know you are ready to light it up with a new Title, Emblem for your profile, and a fiery Charm that can be placed on nearly any weapon of your choosing.\n\nWhat’s in Store for the Pacific: Bundle Overviews\n\nIn addition to the first Bundle for the Welgun and Katana, along with Operators Francis and Isabella, Season One will bring a host of new Store content, including the first Pro Pack in Vanguard.\n\nFit for a fight in the Pacific, the Skull Collector Pro Pack contains seven items on top of 2,400 COD Points for only USD $19.99 SRP or your regional equivalent — essentially, a free pack of Legendary items if you were already planning to pick up 2,400 COD Points in the store.\n\nAmong these items is the Legendary “Canopy Stalker” Skin for Roland and two Legendary Weapon Blueprints that are perfect for a sniping Loadout with Overkill: the “Pythonidae” bolt-action Sniper Rifle Blueprint and the fast-firing “Acinonyx” Assault Rifle Blueprint. It also has a home run of an MVP highlight in “Knuckleball” for Vanguard, if you choose to jump back into Multiplayer and try out or level up new weapons before that next infiltration into the Pacific.\n\nMastercrafts will also appear in Vanguard before the end of the year, starting with the Fire Starter Mastercraft Bundle, featuring the “Helm of Darkness” Assault Rifle Blueprint, which is perfect for the fiery Legendary Skin for Francis within the Battle Pass. An all-around menace that features a deadly Bayonet and Reach Kit combo, this 10-attachment weapon is ready to light up the lobby, especially with its included Incendiary ammunition.\n\nThose who want to look toward the future of CQB combat will want to grab the Enjoy the Retreat Mastercraft Bundle, featuring the “Demo Kit” SMG with heavy-hitting short ammo, where every shot can be vital to your success up close. Expect solid accuracy with this weapon thanks to its barrel and hand stop, as well as a faster fire rate due to the Recoil Booster it has at the muzzle.\n\nLove tracers and gold? Vanguard’s initial bundle offerings will bring back some of the more popular features and styles seen for the past dozen seasons.\n\nAmong the initial offerings of tracer packs is the Tracer Pack: Blue Thunder Bundle, which features an SMG and an Assault Rifle fitted with blue tracer rounds. The “Bioluminescence” SMG is built for covert operations, with a silencer and Subsonic ammo able to keep those smaller caliber bullets off the radar, while the “Flame Painted” Assault Rifle is a 10-attachment beast built for long-range combat.\n\nThose who rather be regal and auric in dealing damage will want to look at the Noble Death Bundle – its highlights are a Legendary “Imperial” Skin for Constanze and two golden Weapon Blueprints that could be used in a full loadout. Take the “Imperator” Assault Rifle as a Primary Weapon and send silent, yet highly accurate, shots down range, and when the enemy gets too close for comfort, deal with them with the fully-automatic “Executor” Handgun.\n\nAlso expect plenty of Bundles themed around the upcoming Festive Fervor — the in-game event and holiday celebration across Vanguard and Warzone — that will arrive alongside these Mastercrafts.\n\nVANGUARD MULTIPLAYER OVERVIEW\n\nBest known as a popular third mode in competitive Call of Duty, Control will see a return in Vanguard Multiplayer in the launch window of Season One.\n\nControl mixes the limited-life nature of Search and Destroy with the objective style of Hardpoint and the elimination-centered gameplay of Team Deathmatch. Two teams alternate between attacking or defending two fixed capture zones on the map with limited respawns. Attackers either have to capture both zones or completely eliminate the Defenders before the time limit.\n\nAnother, more respawn-heavy mode, is set to drop during for Festive Fervor, and any veteran since the Modern Warfare 3 days should be prepared to get in the zone for it...\n\nTwo New Perks and Incendiary Lethal Grenade for Loadouts\n\nReady those Loadouts for some new Perks and Equipment.\n\nThrough the Season One Battle Pass, you can unlock three new options across all Vanguard Loadouts, which are set to rival the already stiff competition between the Lethal Equipment and Perk 1 and 2 slot choices:\n\nSerpentine — Perk 1, Tier 21 of Season One Battle Pass\n\nSprinting reduces incoming damage.\n\nBreaking out into a regular sprint slightly reduces all damage from ballistics and explosives, while Tactical Sprinting can cut damage by more than a quarter of its normal value.\n\nIntuition — Perk 1, Tier 44 of Season One Battle Pass\n\nYour vision pulses when enemies are nearby, even through walls.\n\nSimilar to High Alert in previous games, but with shorter range, Intuition allows you to perceive threats before they round corners or burst through doors. This is done without the need to suppress them like Piercing Range, making it a more passive option for those looking for more close-range engagements.\n\nSpecial Incendiary Grenade — Lethal Equipment, Tier 39 of Season One Battle Pass\n\nObscures an area in a white fog and burns those who come close.\n\nA handheld and extremely limited version of the Firebombing Run Killstreak, the Incendiary Grenade deals a small burst of damage within a large radius at the detonation point, then deals burn damage every second to those who stay within its range. This damage scales the longer someone is within the area and lasts for a longer time than its rivals, the Thermite and Molotov Cocktail.\n\nVANGUARD ZOMBIES OVERVIEW\n\nSeason One introduces a new batch of content for Zombies, as Treyarch adds in a new Objective, new Covenants, new weapons, new Career Challenges, and 20 Season Challenges on December 8.\n\nNew Objective: Purge\n\nEradicate the Augmentors from this plane of existence in Purge, the newest Objective coming to “Der Anfang.” These aethereal worms feed on the dimensional energy that powers Kortifex, and can only be stopped by capturing powerful Control Runes. But beware: the Augmentors will spawn waves of enemies as a defense mechanism as you attempt to purge them from our dimension.\n\nPrepare to take on this Objective among those already available from launch across all arenas, from Stalingrad to Shi No Numa. Earn a new Sacrificial Heart with each completion to spend at the Altar of Covenants.\n\n14 New Covenant Upgrades\n\nFourteen powerful upgrades across five new Covenants are coming for those ready to stop Kortifex’s forces, including one that calls back to a classic Zombies Perk:\n\n- Brimstone: Deal damage to nearby enemies (Rare/Epic/Legendary Rarity).\n\n- Deadshot: Aiming down sights snaps the crosshairs to headshot location on enemies. Bonus damage on first crit for each enemy. Removes weapon sway (Rare/Epic Rarity).\n\n- Dead Wire: Stuns enemy (Rare/Epic Rarity). Stuns enemy and nearby enemies (Legendary Rarity).\n\n- Scrapper: Gain more Salvage from pickups (Rare/Epic Rarity). Gain more Salvage from pickups and Objective rewards (Legendary Rarity).\n\n- Swift Vengeance: Deal more damage the faster you move. Activates shortly after you start moving. Fire while sprinting (Rare/Epic Rarity). Activates immediately upon moving (Legendary Rarity).\n\nThe Big Guns Are Here — Season One Weapons and Launchers Inbound\n\nReady to blast away the hordes with a Bazooka or the Panzerschreck? How about an anti-tank rifle?\n\nSeason One’s newest weapons — the Cooper Carbine, Gorenko Anti-Tank Rifle, and Sawtooth melee weapon — will become available in Zombies Loadouts once they’re unlocked in the Battle Pass system. Watch for them to join the Mystery Box rotation later in the season, as well.\n\nAll four Launchers will also be available in Loadouts and the Mystery Box for Zombies at the start of Season One, adding another layer of strategy for surviving Kortifex’s legions. Be sure to equip Splatterfest at the Altar of Covenants and let the rockets fly.\n\nNew Zombies Career Challenges and Season Challenges\n\nEarn unique Calling Cards and XP bonuses by conquering new sets of Zombies Career Challenges in Season One, which will offer more ways to test your undead-slaying skills in “Der Anfang.”\n\nZombies players can also unlock and complete 20 new Season Challenges at the start of the season to earn even more XP and Calling Card rewards throughout the season.\n\nComing Soon: The Tome of Rituals, New Area, Support Killstreaks, Holiday Updates and More\n\nTreyarch is preparing new Zombies updates for after the new year, which will include more content and features:\n\n- The Tome of Rituals. Your Artifacts will be able to grow in power through the Tome of Rituals, offering greater Dark Aether abilities to aid in your survival.\n\n- Von List’s Office. Few know what Von List is hiding in his personal quarters, but it may offer clues as to Kortifex’s plans. Dark secrets may also be waiting beyond a mysterious new portal…\n\n- Support Killstreaks. The devastating Warmachine and Deathmachine will be ready to help you fight the rotting masses, so long as you have the Salvage to spare at the Crafting Table (or get lucky at the Mystery Box).\n\n- Additional Features. New weapon unlock challenges, Mystery Box weapon updates, Server Pause functionality, and more are planned for later in Season One, including festive new holiday theming in Stalingrad. Speaking of which...\n\n’Tis the Season for Prestige: Season One Challenges and Events\n\nAt the start of Season One, your Season Level will refresh to Level 1 and your progress will resume from the highest Prestige Level you achieved previously — three, if you reached the top level during the pre-season.\n\nStarting with Season One, every 10 levels within Prestige offers a new Zombies and a Multiplayer/Warzone Pacific Challenge to complete for XP and a Calling Card. Complete all 20 within a seasonal set for that game mode to unlock an incredible animated Calling Card that shows off your elite abilities.\n\nThis season offers four additional Prestiges to achieve across the first 200 levels, as well as a new Weapon Blueprint:\n\n- Level 50: New Prestige, Emblem, Weapon Blueprint, and Battle Pass Tier Skip\n\n- Level 100: New Prestige, Emblem, and Battle Pass Tier Skip\n\n- Level 150: New Prestige, Emblem, and Battle Pass Tier Skip\n\n- Level 190: All Season Challenges Available\n\n- Level 200: New Prestige, Emblem, Battle Pass Tier Skip, Master Prestige Calling Card\n\n- Levels 250–1,000: Ability to earn additional Prestige Levels, if they were not reached during the pre-season.\n\nRemember: Your Prestige-leveling journey is synchronized between Vanguard and Warzone Pacific, meaning you can progress through Season Levels and increase your Prestige Level by earning XP in either game!\n\nTHE LAST HOURS OF VERDANSK — HEAD TO WARZONE NOW!\n\nAt 9 PM PT on December 7, the Verdansk we knew will be gone.\n\nOperators should prepare to infiltrate the Last Hours of Verdansk, a limited-time mode in Warzone starting tomorrow that contains exclusive rewards for participation and victory. Those who want to play on Verdansk one last time may want to join this explosive finale, where bunkers are your only safe haven from what will come.\n\nRemember: after 9 PM PT on December 7, the Warzone servers will shut down alongside the Season One Update. They will be back online at 9 AM PT December 8, where Vanguard owners can drop into Caldera and everyone can get back to Rebirth Island for the start of Warzone Pacific.\n\nRise on every front.\n\n* PlayStation players receive select bonus content and benefits not available on other platforms until Nov. 1, 2022.\n\nFor more information on Call of Duty®: Vanguard, check out www.callofduty.com and www.youtube.com/callofduty and follow @SHGames, @Treyarch, @RavenSoftware, and @CallofDuty on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\n© 2021 Activision Publishing, Inc.
