        "text": "Central to the Modern Warfare II universe, the city of Al Mazrah within the United Republic of Adal is your first battleground for Warzone 2.0.\n\nThose who are playing Modern Warfare II right now are getting some serious training on Al Mazrah. For example, the following Multiplayer maps are subsections of this massive region:\n\nAl Bagra Fortress (Core Map)\n\nEmbassy (Core Map)\n\nZarqwa Hydroelectric (Core Map)\n\nTaraq (both Core and Battle Map)\n\nSariff Bay (Battle Map)\n\nSa’id (Battle Map)\n\nWe already gave a brief overview of Al Mazrah here. Expect an expanded map guide before launch.\n\nWarzone 2.0 Innovations, Updates Since Call of Duty: Next\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is ready to make its impact as a rebuilt, free-to-play, free-for-everyone take on the Battle Royale game that has redefined the Call of of Duty® franchise.\n\nBefore the Season 01 launch, an entire blog will be dedicated to diving deeper into new features and mechanics that have been updated since what was shown at Call of Duty: Next. For now, here is a taste of the biggest highlights we can share:\n\nLoadouts Are Not Leaving\n\nWarzone 2.0 will implement a new Backpack system, fully integrated for DMZ and streamlined for Battle Royale modes.\n\nIn Battle Royale, like the previous Warzone, Supply Boxes will throw out items to pick up. When a player interacts with any other loot container, such as a duffel bag, medical case, they will function with a loot menu.\n\nWhen a player dies, they will drop their Primary Weapon on the ground and their Backpack, which contains the rest of their content, and is accessed through a loot menu.\n\nDefining the New Gulag\n\nAfter Next, the new Gulag received some changes over the past two months while still being grounded within a traditional Warzone experience.\n\nThe Gulag will be a 2v2 environment where randomly paired Duos must coordinate to take down their opposition. All players will receive a predefined Loadout — at launch, this will be a Pistol or a Shotgun, a Lethal Grenade, and a Tactical Grenade — with highly effective weaponry and gear placed toward the map’s center.\n\nThe Gulag will also include a Jailer, who will appear in the middle of the match to help speed up combat. Defeating the Jailer will return all four Gulag prisoners back into the Battle Royale, which offers a dilemma: Do both Duos agree to wait and fight this powerful enemy together, or does one get greedy and try to go for the elimination victory?\n\nInstead of a traditional Overtime mechanic, if neither team nor the Jailer is eliminated after a brief period of time, all four Operators lose.\n\nAI Combatants in Battle Royale — Only at Strongholds, Black Sites, Gulag Overtime\n\nThe Gulag is just one of three places where players can fight AI combatants, as they will be restricted to guard specific locations.\n\nThe other two locations are Strongholds and Black Sites, which are clearly designated on your in-game Tac-Map to allow you to opt-into engagements with AI combatants.\n\nDuring each match, several Strongholds will be activated around the map. Squads can visit these areas to fight AI combatants. The first team to complete a Stronghold must disarm a bomb and will earn a key to a Black Site and their Custom Loadout. Successive teams must eliminate a specific number of defenders (AI or players) and will earn their Custom Loadout, but not a Black Site key.\n\nBlack Sites are a more dangerous form of Strongholds, but they offer a permanent Weapon Blueprint reward and even more valuable in-match items for those who clear it out. These are available only via Black Site key, given to the first team that clears one of the active Strongholds.\n\nAdditional New Features: Aquatic Combat, New Vehicles and Fuel Mechanic, and More\n\nNot everything will be different from what we saw at Next. In addition to some other new features, expect the following in Warzone 2.0:\n\nCircle Collapse\n\nThere may not be only one safe zone — in Battle Royale modes, there can be up to three circles within the collapse, which will ultimately remerge for the final showdown. Prepare to adjust your strategies accordingly, as this feature is randomized in each match.\n\nProximity Chat\n\nGot something to say? Comms are now open, so any in-game chatter can be picked up by any other squad. This can open up new ways to tackle engagements . . . or mess with enemies who are holed up inside buildings.\n\nAssimilation\n\nIn squad-based DMZ modes, as well as special Battle Royale playlists, you have the choice to join up with enemy Operators and form a larger squad.\n\nInterrogation (Battle Royale and DMZ only)\n\nIn squad-based modes, intel is everything. Reveal enemy locations by successfully shaking down player-controlled enemies while they are downed.\n\nHeavy Chopper and Hummer EV\n\nTwo new vehicles define the refreshed vehicle roster for Warzone 2.0: an aerial powerhouse known as the Heavy Chopper, which can hover in the air without a pilot, and the and the GMC HUMMER EV Pickup, a versatile means to quickly cover serious ground with the whole squad in this all-electric supertruck.\n\nHere is the full roster of vehicles you can expect to find in Al Mazrah:\n\nATV: Nimble three-seater with little protection\n\nUTV: All-terrain lightweight four-seater.\n\nHatchback: Four-door civilian vehicle without any significant protection.\n\nSUV (Standard): All-terrain civilian 4x4 with a boxy frame.\n\nGMC Hummer EV: All-electric supertruck engineered for off-road.\n\nCargo Truck: Large industrial vehicle with a flatbed.\n\nLight Helo: Twin-engine light helicopter for rapid traversal and combat support.\n\nHeavy Chopper: Heavily armored search-and-rescue helicopter.\n\nRHIB: Maneuverable tactical boat designed for Special Forces.\n\nArmored Patrol Boat: Reinforced aquatic vehicle with mounted .50 Cal machine guns.\n\nVehicle Fuel, Gas Station Mechanic\n\nNo more unlimited fuel sources — all vehicles (yes, including the EV) use fuel over time, and when it runs out, that vehicle is no longer usable. Vehicles can be refilled either with Gas Cans found around the map or at Gas Stations.\n\nGas Stations can also repair body damage and tires, thereby restoring vehicle health. However, Operators can also perform flat tire repairs anywhere in the world by interacting with individual tires.\n\nAquatic Combat\n\nWhether by boat or breaststroke, Operators can navigate waterways, rivers, and the open sea as part of their overall victory strategy. Remember: only Sidearms, melee weapons, and Throwing Knives can be used while you’re submerged. Also, try using Lethal and Tactical Equipment on or underwater for a wide variety of potentially destructive effects.\n\nThe Shops: Buy Station 2.0\n\nEach Buy Station contains a unique set of items for purchase in limited quantity, including Killstreaks, Armor Plates, and more. You can see these offerings, and can buy back fallen squadmates, within a new interface.\n\nDMZ — Play Your Way in a Completely New Warzone Experience\n\nIn a future Modern Warfare II season, Treyarch is teaming up with Infinity Ward and other partners to provide a Ranked Play experience in Multiplayer, modeled after the game’s highest level of competition: the Call of Duty League.\n\nAs previously announced, Modern Warfare II Ranked Play will be based off the past two years of continuous feedback and will contain, among other new features, Ranked Skill Divisions, visible Skill Ratings, a Top-250 Leaderboard, and rewards fit for our most competitive Operators.\n\nWhile this mode is still being fine-tuned for that eventual seasonal update, the developers created a special CDL Moshpit Playlist for Season 01.\n\nThis Playlist will use the League’s standard rules, restrictions, and map rotation across all three of its official game modes: Hardpoint, Search & Destroy, and Control.\n\nGrab up to three of your most competitive squadmates and get that practice in for Ranked Play; you can afford the tough losses now before it starts hurting that Skill Rating!\n\nSpecial Ops — New Mission at Launch, Raid Episode 1 Mid-Season\n\nCall up that Duo at the start of the season and prepare the Trio for the ultimate test — Special Ops is getting a new mission and the first episode of Raids during Season 01.\n\nHigh Ground\n\nSuccessfully find and destroy enemy communication servers to locate and extract three hard drives with vital enemy intel. One Operator will be tasked with piloting an Attack Chopper to clear out dangerous land mines, while the other works with AI allies as part of a Ground Assault Team to infiltrate the buildings that contain enemy equipment.\n\nBe sure to replay this mission to get those three weekly Stars, and tackle those Daily Challenges for additional Stars.\n\nComing Mid-Season: Raid Episode 1\n\nIn the seasons of Modern Warfare (2019), the Battle Pass system offered players a collection of free items, including functional weapons and Call of Duty Points, just by playing the game. It gave our community visibility into what content they were earning or buying, with the ability to upgrade and access 100+ items, including a new Operator, Weapon Blueprints, and more.\n\nIn Season 01, we are introducing a brand-new iteration of the Battle Pass with a host of innovations — players will have more choices and more agency than ever before.\n\nInstead of a linear stream of tiers set out in a scrolling row along the bottom of your screen, your Battle Pass takes the form of a multi-Sector map. Players will unlock items using earned Battle Token Tier Skips across this map, which is themed within the current season. Each map has at least 20 Sectors with five items in each Sector — tokens can be used to either unlock adjacent Sectors or earn more items within an unlocked Sector.\n\nEssentially, these tokens can be used to unlock specific items within the Battle Pass at your own pace — whether it is a new free functional weapon or a cool new Operator Skin, you have control over what gets unlocked earlier on the road to 100% map completion. Are you looking for a particularly impressive Operator Skin, Weapon Blueprint, or one of the new weapons? Then pick the appropriate Sector and start acquiring tokens to unlock those items!\n\nCheck back next week to see the new Battle Pass in detail.\n\nFour New Weapons, Two Free in Battle Pass\n\nEagle-eyed players may have seen (and even used) both of the season’s functional weapons within this season’s Battle Pass system while playing the Modern Warfare II Campaign. Now you can wield them across Multiplayer, Special Ops, and Warzone 2.0 modes. Introducing the Victus XMR and the BAS-P SMG at launch and the Chimera and M13B Assault Rifles during the season:\n\nVictus XMR Sniper Rifle — Imperatorium Platform (Launch, Battle Pass)\n\nBorn in the South Niger Delta, Zosar Kalu is the eldest of three children, helping to raise his younger siblings while his parents pursued political aspirations. His nickname comes from his youngest brother, who was born with dysarthria (a speech disorder) and would pronounce his name “Zeus.”\n\nFollowing his year of military service shadowing a Nigerian Army Special Forces Battalion, he enlisted and rose through the ranks of those same Special Forces. At the same time, his family became involved in a high-profile state election but tragically died to a local Al Qatala cell.\n\nOrphaned, and now the last of his name, Zeus established the “Thunder” Corps, a counterterrorism group dedicated to hunting AQ wherever they hide and bringing them to true justice.\n\nHow to Unlock: Zeus is automatically unlocked with purchase of the Season 01 Battle Pass.\n\nKlaus (Mid-Season)\n\nThis year, leveling up past Rank 55 will allow you to earn a persistent Prestige Rank across all seasons, rather than having it reset at the end of each season.\n\nBeginning in Season 01, reaching Rank 56 will unlock Prestige 1. This will grant an Emblem, additional rewards, and a set of challenges — complete those challenges to unlock an exclusive Calling Card.\n\nSeason 01 includes four more Prestige Ranks, which also unlock a new set of challenges and rewards:\n\nPrestige 2: Unlocked at Rank 100\n\nPrestige 3: Unlocked at Rank 150\n\nPrestige 4: Unlocked at Rank 200\n\nPrestige 5: Unlocked at Rank 250 and is the level cap until the end of Season 01.\n\nAt the end of Season 01, players can continue ranking up from wherever they ended up on the Prestige Ranks. This allows players who may not have enough time to level up to catch up in later seasons, while also not resetting the progress of anyone who reached the Max Rank during that season.\n\nOUT OF COMBAT OVERVIEW\n\nSpeaking of the Call of Duty Endowment, the Call of Duty Endowment (C.O.D.E.) Bowl III presented by USAA will be held on December 16th from 12-4pm ET during the first Call of Duty League Major, taking place right after the Season 01 mid-season update December 15 to 18 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Call of Duty League Major will also host the first Call of Duty Challengers Open. If you think your squad has what it takes to start on the road to glory, see here for more details.\n\nVisit the League’s official website for more information, including when tickets for the first Major will be on sale.\n\nNew Call of Duty League Launch Pack, Team Packs to Be Released\n\nDuring Season 01, we are celebrating an early return to the Call of Duty League™ with a special launch pack for the 2023 season. We are also releasing Team Packs for all 12 of the League’s teams.\n\nCheck back here for more intel on these closer to Season 01’s launch.\n\nGear Up at the Call of Duty Shop This Black Friday\n\nThe Call of Duty Shop will hold a special Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale from November 15 to November 28. All items site-wide are 20% off.\n\nIf you have not already, keep those comms open for more details closer to sale dates, and be sure to visit the Call of Duty Shop and gear up!\n\nStill Time to Drop into MWII and Get Ownership Benefits, Upgrade to Vault Edition\n\nNow is a great time to pick up Modern Warfare II before Season 01 kicks off.\n\nPurchase Modern Warfare II to get access to a ton of content across three modes, including the ability to unlock 14 exclusive Operators to use across both games, as well as other ways to quickly level up the available 30 Weapon Platforms and over 50 Weapons through Multiplayer and Special Ops.\n\nModern Warfare II owners also get Premium XP while playing Warzone 2.0 — at the end of each match, owners will receive additional XP on top of any XP that can be earned by all players.\n\nPlus, as already mentioned, those who own Modern Warfare II will have access to all the content coming in Season 01, including the first ever Raid, arriving mid-season.\n\nThose who want even more benefits should consider upgrading to the Vault Edition, which grants four additional Operators — Ghost, Farah, Price, and Soap — as Red Team 141, the FJX Cinder Weapon Vault, an ultimate version of a Weapon Blueprint with 50+ attachments included, the Season 01 Battle Pass along with 50 Battle Token Tier Skips, and more.\n\nStay frosty."
