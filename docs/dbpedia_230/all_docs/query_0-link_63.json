In Ukraine, health workers have retrofitted a passenger train to evacuate patients away from hospitals near conflict zones.\n\nIt’s one of several initiatives Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched in Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February. MSF staff have been preparing hospitals for mass casualty situations, delivering emergency supplies, and training local doctors in battlefield medicine — from extracting bullets and shrapnel to wound cleaning.\n\nCanadian-American emergency physician Dan Schnorr is one of the health care workers involved in the medevac train project. CMAJ reached him in Dnipro."
