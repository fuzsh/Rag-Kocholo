However, since the original Warzone's release, the battle royale mode has become an integral part of the whole franchise.\n\nSo, as Modern Warfare 3 approaches, fans are naturally curious about whether we'll see Warzone 3 in the game. Some have even started referring to the next iteration of the battle royale mode as Warzone 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Warzone mode will be back in Modern Warfare 3, however it will not be called 'Warzone 3'. Activision have dropped the number from the name and will just keep updating the current iteration of the mode.\n\nThe term Warzone 2 was initially introduced during the release of Modern Warfare 2 and it created some confusion among the fanbase. Many thought that Modern Warfare 3 might bring Warzone 3. It's common to associate a number with the title to indicate changes following a new game.\n\nFor now, you'll have to settle for the current Warzone. If Activision decides to make any naming changes in the future, we'll keep you updated."
