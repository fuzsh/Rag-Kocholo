You'll also need to set your region and decide whether or not you'd like to receive marketing emails before confirming your account. You can also create an account online.\n\nAfter accepting the Call of Duty Account Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, your account registration will be complete, and your Account Summary will display.\n\nNote that your Account Summary includes your Activision ID, which is the name you'll appear as in the game.\n\nImportant! When creating an Activision account, be sure to use a valid email address that you can access. Account verification emails will be sent to validate your account ownership if you wish to\n\nlink or unlink accounts;\n\nchange the account's email address or password;\n\nchange your Activision ID;\n\nsign up for two-factor authentication.\n\nAfter signing up or logging in, you'll see your Activision ID, also referred to as your Display Name. Activision IDs include a hash mark followed by a series of numbers (ex: DisplayName#1234567), which is unique to your Activision account and allows players with the same PSN ID, Gamertag, BattleTag, or SteamID to keep their names while differentiating them in the game. The numbers also make account creation easier, eliminating the need to see if a name is available.\n\nYou can change your Activision ID/Display Name with a Username change token. You'll receive a new Username change token every six months, and you can carry up to two tokens at any given time.\n\nTo change your Activision ID/Display Name in the game, head to the Activision Account screen.\n\nPress Options on the home screen.\n\nGo to the ACCOUNT tab and select Activision Account.\n\nChoose CHANGE DISPLAY NAME.\n\nEnter your desired name and choose CONFIRM.\n\nYou can also change your Activision ID/Display Name online.\n\nLog in to your Activision account.\n\nSelect BASIC INFO.\n\nSelect EDIT next to your ACTIVISION ID.\n\nIn the ACCOUNT VERIFICATION REQUIRED pop-up, select SEND CODE.\n\nGo to your email account to retrieve the one-time verification code.\n\nReturn to the ACCOUNT VERIFICATION REQUIRED pop-up and enter the code.\n\nOn the BASIC INFO tab and select EDIT next to your ACTIVISION ID.\n\nEnter a new Activision ID/Display Name and select SAVE.\n\nEnter the password for your Activision account.\n\nSelect SUBMIT."
