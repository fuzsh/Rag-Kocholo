        "text": "How to change your name in Warzone: Quick steps\n\nLaunch Warzone on your PC or console\n\nAt the main menu, select Options in the bottom left\n\nFrom the tabs across the top, select the Account tab\n\nSelect Activision Account from the menu on the left\n\nIn the popup window, choose Change Display Name\n\nEnter your new name and then click confirm\n\nWhether you created your Warzone account during a more embarrassing time in life or just want to spice things up, now's the perfect time to change your player name. With the fresh season 3 here and a huge Warzone update, getting logged in might take a minute, but it's where you'll find the options menu to get started.\n\nPatience to wait out any outstanding Warzone downloads\n\nAn existing account with Activision\n\nSteps\n\nWhether you're on console or PC, the steps are the same, and thankfully it's a pretty easy process. Just remember that you earn a rename token once every six months and can hold only two, so you won't be able to change your name willy nilly.\n\nOpen up Warzone and then consider getting a hot dog while you wait, if there's an update.\n\nNear the bottom left, select the options menu. It's kind of small, but you've probably needed it before to change controls or adjust the sound\n\nAlong the top there will be tabs, select Account on the far right. This is where all your account options live.\n\nPick Activision Account from the new menu page. This should pop open a window showing your current name and account info.\n\nIn the new window choose Change Display Name. This will load another window that tells you how many tokens you have currently for name change.\n\nEnter your new name in the blank and then click Confirm. Should be as easy as that.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere's nothing worse than being stuck with something like Xx_tHa_sNiPa_xX when you've decided you're really more of an assault rifle player. Thankfully, as your tastes change, you can swap things around and lock down a new gamertag that fits the new you.\n\nWhile you're at it, secure yourself a better shot at your first win of the new season with our Warzone tips.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nContributor\n\nSarah (She/Her) is a contributor and former Senior Writer for TechRadar Gaming.
