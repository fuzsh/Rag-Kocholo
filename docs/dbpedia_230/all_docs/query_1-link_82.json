        "text": "Which Warzone maps are currently in rotation? The free-to-play Warzone battle royale mode remains one of the most popular aspects of the Call of Duty series, and alongside one large map, there are now a constant rotation of smaller maps, and we’ve got the details on which ones you can play right now.\n\nAs the Black Ops 6 release date approaches, we can expect a new Warzone to come with it. In the meantime, though, there’s still Warzone Season 5, a new Warzone Battle pass, and a popular POI returns to Urzikstan. If you want to know which Resurgence maps are currently available and where to drop, read on.\n\nWarzone Urzikstan map\n\nUrzikstan is currently the main Warzone map featured in the standard mode of the battle royale game. This large map contains a number of unique POIs, some of which appear in Modern Warfare 3 maps.\n\nThis huge map was the first to introduce horizontal ziplines to Warzone as a crucial way of getting around fast. If that doesn’t do it for you though, there’s always the train that travels through many of the POIs below.\n\nAs a huge battle royale map, there is a perfect mix of close quarters and vast open spaces, areas to take cover, and high points to snipe from. As such, many loadouts can be put to good use in Urzikstan, but you can’t go wrong with the best Warzone ARs and SMGs.\n\nUrzikstan POIs\n\nLevin Resort\n\nPopov Power\n\nOrlov Military Base\n\nSeaport District\n\nUrzikstan Cargo\n\nOld Town\n\nLow Town\n\nHadida Farms\n\nZaravan City\n\nZaravan Suburbs\n\nShahin Manor\n\nCurrent Warzone Resurgence maps\n\nThe smaller Warzone Resurgence maps currently in rotation are:\n\nSuperstore Resurgence\n\nFortune’s Keep\n\nRebirth Island\n\nVondel\n\nSuperstore Resurgence\n\nCelebrating the new Atlas Superstore POI in Urzikstan, inspired by the classic Verdansk Superstore, there is a new Resurgence map available in Warzone Season 5. Superstore Resurgence is a dedicated Resurgence mode set in the POI itself. The play here is to try and control the high ground – the roof, but know that you’ll face tough competition up there.\n\nFortune’s Keep\n\nFortune’s Keep returned to Warzone in February 2024, bringing the fan-favorite Resurgence mode back with it. Shortly after the re-release of the Mediterranean-inspired map, an explosion rocked the island, creating a series of cracks and crevices throughout while opening up a new underground area. It’s up to you, then, whether to head straight for the high vantage points at Bioweapons or sneak around underground via an underwater pipe at Dock.\n\nRebirth Island\n\nAfter the success of Fortune’ Keep, Rebirth Island was also brought back to Warzone in April 2024, and remains in Resurgence rotation right now. There is also a Rebirth Island-only playlist, if this is your favorite map.\n\nSince Rebirth Island’s return, the map has told the story of the Konni take over of the area, with new, clinical, technologically advanced areas such in Industry and a vast new building that’s great for looting at the Chemical Engineering POI.\n\nVondel\n\nUnlike the other maps above, Vondel is a beautiful historial site, with some incredible gothic architecture to take in. Don’t get too distracted, though, as it could be the death of you. Instead, perhaps try and hide in the spires of the castle roof to get a good view of the whole map.\n\nAlternatively, this is a map with a lot of inside areas, so you can stay stealthy and sneak between buildings, using them as cover, or make the most of the shadows cast by tall buildings while darting down the narrow European-inspired streets.\n\nOther Warzone maps\n\nThese Warzone maps are not currently playable, but could see a return in the future:\n\nVerdansk\n\nVerdansk ’84\n\nAshika Island\n\nCaldera\n\nAl Mazrah\n\nCaldera and Al Mazrah were some of the more recent main Warzone maps, while Verdansk remains perhaps the most beloved Warzone map of all time. There have been repeated leaks over the last year or so that Verdansk is set to return to Warzone, including this report from Insider Gaming. While this has yet to come to fruition, previous map changes have always coincided with the release of a new mainline Call of Duty game, so Verdansk could still return with the release of Black Ops 6 in October 2024.\n\nAshika Island, meanwhile, is a Resurgence map based in the Asia Pacific region that was most recently removed from playlists in May 2024."
