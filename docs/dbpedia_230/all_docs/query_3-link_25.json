        "text": "One of the aims of military medicine is to keep soldiers ready for action. It starts with the health of new recruits, but keeping troops fighting fit also means preventing and controlling diseases that can devastate an army as effectively as any weapon.\n\nOnce the fighting begins, the medical service aims to treat and return troops to active service as quickly as possible. The military has had to develop fast, efficient systems for both treating the injured at the front line and transporting the seriously wounded to hospitals away from the fighting.\n\nAs medicine has improved, more soldiers survive their injuries, but those left with life-changing damage, might need a lifetime of treatment and support. In the aftermath of war, medicine has a role to play in the rehabilitating the wounded and providing continuing care for those left with chronic physical and mental conditions.\n\nMilitary medicine draws on the latest developments in medicine and science, but it's not all one way. Techniques and equipment proven to be effective in war have made valuable contributions to medicine in peacetime.\n\nfour stories about war and medicine"
