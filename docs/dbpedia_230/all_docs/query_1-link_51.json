        "text": "Have you ever wanted to change your Activision display name in Call of Duty: Warzone? Activision makes it easy to switch usernames right from the in-game menus. This guide details the necessary steps for how to change your name in Warzone.\n\nStep 1: Access your account settings in-game\n\nFrom the main menu in game, navigate to Settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner of the screen or by pressing the menu button on controller. Select the Account & Network settings tab.\n\nStep 2: Open your Activision account\n\nNext, choose Activision Account under the Online tab.\n\nStep 3: Change your Activision display name\n\nClick Change Display Name and type a new Warzone name in the text box.\n\nStep 4: Confirm your updated name\n\nOnce you have the perfect Warzone name, select Confirm to finalize your choice.\n\nStep 5: Close and restart Warzone\n\nAfter confirming your updated name, Warzone will require an immediate restart. You should see the changed Activision display name when you log back into the game.\n\nKeep in mind that Activision charges one token per name change, and all players start with two name-change tokens. Make sure you will be satisfied with the Activision display name you pick â€“ it takes six months to regain one name-change token, meaning after two name changes, you are stuck with that username for at least six months.\n\nHow to change the way your display name looks in-game\n\nActivision also lets players modify how player names are displayed in-game.\n\nGo to the Interface in the Settings menu and scroll down until you see Player Names.\n\nFrom here, you can pick between Full, Abbreviated, and Icon only names."
