Studio 7 is a concept store that offers a new retail experience for both designers and customers alike. The concept store is devoted to empowering emerging designers by showcasing their work and, crucially, enabling them to commercialise it. This is achieved physically in-store at M7 and via a dedicated online platform (coming soon), making their designs accessible to international audiences and consumers.

Related event programme

Studio 7 also plays host to an evolving special events programme intended to support designers and engage with the local community. The programme includes talks, workshops, and performances.
