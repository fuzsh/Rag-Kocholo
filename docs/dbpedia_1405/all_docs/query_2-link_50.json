We do not allow unsupervised children in our building. If you or someone in your group requires childcare (and the children cannot remain in the booked studio with their parent/guardian), we recommend that you book an additional studio for those children and schedule a childcare professional to supervise them. If CCD staff encounters unsupervised children in the building and identifies them as part of an ongoing studio rental, CCD reserves the right to immediately terminate that rental without a refund."
