        "text": "The WSRE PBS Jean & Paul Amos Performance Studio is a 10,000 sq ft television studio which also serves as an event venue for various organizations and activities. The Amos Studio is located on the campus of Pensacola State College, across from the Pensacola International Airport, on the corner of College Blvd. and 9th Ave. You will find the studio entrance on the west end of the Kugelman Center for Telecommunications with ample parking for events.\n\nThe Amos Studio opened in 2005 to support the mission of WSRE PBS to postively impact local communities through education, entertainment and engagement by providing everyone access to the highest quality media content and by engaging all children in essential learning activities. One of the largest community events held at the Amos Studio is the annual WSRE PBS KIDS Be My Neighbor Day with family-fun activities indoors and outdoors.\n\nFunding for the studio's construction came from major gifts to the WSRE-TV Foundation, matching dollars from the state legislature and a lead gift of $500,000 from former Northwest Florida residents, Jean and Paul Amos.\n\nPaul Amos was best known as a co-founder of Aflac, the world’s largest supplemental insurance company. He and his wife Jean had resided in Columbus, Ga.; however, they first met during their formative years living in Milton, Fla. and were married 65 years before his death in 2014. The Jean & Paul Amos Performance Studio was named in honor of their generous gift to the station's FutureVision Capital Campaign.\n\nSince its opening, the WSRE PBS Jean & Paul Amos Performance Studio has been used a soundstage and a venue for a variety of performances and events. In addition to WSRE PBS productions, like the “StudioAmped” televised music series, the Amos Studio hosts concerts, lectures, film screenings, recitals and plays, along with job fairs and a variety of events hosted by community organizations and Pensacola State College.\n\nStudio Rental\n\nThe Amos Studio is self-contained and can be rented for public or private events and productions. For studio rental and setup, a WSRE PBS station representative can guide you from start to finish.\n\nAn audience of 500-plus will fill the studio’s theater seating with space on the floor for additional seats. Theater seating is retractable, providing a larger floor space for events as required.\n\nThe station can provide tables and chairs, and the studio’s spacious lobby area is ideal for accommodating event registration and displays. The upstairs foyer is often used for receptions and smaller gatherings.\n\nThe studio’s 25x30 breakout room— the Red Room—is an ideal space for sponsor parties, private pre-show meetings, or additional dressing room space for large casts. Adjacent to the Red Room is a setup area (with refrigerator, ice machine and ample counter space for catering needs) and another small space ideal for meetings or storage during events.\n\nBackstage accommodations include four dressing rooms and a Green Room with lighted makeup mirrors and restrooms with showers. Backstage spaces are equipped with sound monitors.\n\nThe Amos studio also offers a ticket booth and public restrooms.\n\nThank you for considering the WSRE PBS Jean & Paul Amos Performance Studio for your next event!\n\nContact:\n\nJill Hubbs, WSRE PBS General Manager\n\nPhone: (850) 484-1236\n\nCell: (850) 572-2055\n\nEmail: jhubbs@wsre.org"
