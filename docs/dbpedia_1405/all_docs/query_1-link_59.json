        "text": "Thanks for that fast response. Price is not my concern, free or a few hundred dollars . . .\n\nI'm concerned about installing any new music software on the same computer as my old music software.\n\nAcid Music Studio 11 is eight years and several versions more recent. I could discover that the \"New and improved\" features have invalidated my previous thousand hours of work: just incompatible. But - by then - my old software has been written over!\n\nOver the years, this has already happened with a lot of my previous work in other fields, with other types of software. I\n\nLet me give you the background. It's a long story, but interesting.\n\nOver the last 16 years I've invested several thousand hours recording and mixing drums, lead/ rhythm guitars, Bass guitars, 3-part harmonies and keyboard (all recorded Live), into over 130 songs.\n\nI performed live with my band for several years, and now I'm recording a lot of my unrecorded songs, while still composing new songs. Some samples: Reverbnation.com/Alan Bradley. (I've posted - I dunno 30 - 50 songs).\n\nI am a prolific composer, and have I have about 50 songs currently partially recorded. For example, a rough guitar track or drum track as a backbone for a Bass track. Then I decide a bass melody/ rhythm, and record. I then delete the guitar track, and write one with a more significant rhythm to mesh with the bass. My songs are not simple rock or blues, they are quite complex, and so take longer to record and edit.\n\nFore instance, one of my Songs, \"Folks I Knew,\" has 35 edited tracks in the folder. The folder for that ONE song contains 1.33 GB, and my preliminary mix on that one song took me 39-1/2 hours. Most songs are smaller, though (thank God). Still I now currently have a total of 66.8 GB of songs recorded or in the works. 11,513 files.\n\nIt takes 14 CD's of MP3s to hold my current master catalog of recordings: 226 mp3s. 10 disks of finished or mostly finished songs, 4 disks of songs-in-the-works.\n\nI am a composer - for about 45 years now - and at any one time I have up to 100 brand new songs in the rough stages. I am a also a member of the BMI music rights organization, and I've so far copyrighted over 70 songs with the U.S. Copyright office. I already have another 30 - 40 finished songs ready for copyright.\n\nSorry for the long story.\n\nThe bottom line is that I am an experienced composer with 100 - 110 brand new songs in the rough stages. Many of these rough recordings have 5 -10 tracks with a LOT of editing done to them.\n\nI can't take the slightest risk of losing my last 500 - 600 hundred hours of editing! I've been bitten in the ass by 'updated' software before!\n\nI need to know first if it's safe to install this software; I can't just download it and 'see if it works,' it may invalidate everything I've accomplished.\n\nQUESTION: Will my old wavs and sfk files, an all my previous cut & pasting, balancing, volumes reverb, etc still work the SAME, with the SAME timing and all?\n\nWill all my old editing survive the new software?\n\nAnyone have any ideas/input?\n\nIf necessary, I will finish out my last 100 songs using the old software (Sony Acid Music Studio 7). There are tremendous problems involved between WIN 10 and Sony Acid Music Studio 7. I'd rather use current software.\n\nIf the only way to be sure is to keep all my old work away from the new software - I will. I may have to buy a brand new computer, install the new software, and start recording any and all new songs on a separate computer.\n\nI don't know where to find the answers . . . Anyone have any ideas/input?\n\n- Alan\n\nYeah, thanks for the suggestions, guys.\n\nYeah, I back up everything at least once a week.\n\nBut usually newer versions of software will first remove all traces of the old software. And I CAN use my old software. If the new software doesn't work - and it has by then already erased my current software - then I'm up the creek without a paddle.\n\nYeah, I get it: the \"theory\" says 'yeah, it'll probably wok.' But 'probably' is not good enough; not worth the slightest risk of my losing thousands of hours (literally, thousands of hours) of recording and editing songs. Sometimes I record and edit songs 40 hours a week.\n\nSony Aid Music Studio 7 is from 2006; the new software is 15 YEARS newer! Before I erase my old software, I need to be sure that all my wavs and sfk files, with all the previous cut & pasting, balancing, volumes reverb, etc, will still appear & work & sound the same way. With no additional work required to 'adjust' the songs to the new software.\n\nif it was just one song, I wouldn't worry about it, but I have a pretty large library of complex work, which would take me me seven years to re-create, and I'm still writing and recording new stuff all the time. I won't take even a 1% risk of that.\n\nI was looking to see if anyone has had direct experience with importing WAV & SFK files from older versions to the newer version.\n\nCrap. I'll probably get a new computer and install the new software, to segregate any problems.\n\nAh, well . . . thanks anyway, guys. I appreciate your suggestions."
