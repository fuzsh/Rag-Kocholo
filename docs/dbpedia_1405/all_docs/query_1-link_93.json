        "text": "Often, I have heard the argument that FS should follow the model of AH who is of comparable size and geographical location. Yet, I keep seeing a lot of news that they’re making some extremely questionable developer decisions.\n\nSo, what’s going on? Do you think this is a culture thing? Or a development life cycle? Or… what? Because The last time I remember seeing solid praise for HD2 was a couple of months ago. In relation to Darktide should FS still follow the model that AH is producing?\n\nThey are 2 different games that don’t work the same way, are there certain things that HD2 has over DT, yes (Eg: Earnable Premium cosmetics), but on the other hand there are many things that they could not really replicate.\n\nSo should they follow the model of AH, no, it’s not really feasible for FS and GW.\n\nCould they took some things from it, yes. Will they, probably not, and it’ll be fine anyway\n\nWhat sort of things are super questionable? Literally havent heard much drama of late, but Im also not on reddit or their discord so am probably out of a loop. Last I heard they were focusing on a large weapon rebalancing effort, looking into recent reviews, there appears to be lots of angst over flamethrowers, I see their Steam reviews of late have dropped back to Mixed, but I’m not sure that’s a systemic issue plaguing the game as opposed to just a single update that messed some people’s fav toys thatll bounce back again.\n\nAs is, the game has settled from its launch highs, but is still pulling in 10x more people on average than DT is and still generally being reviewed better than DT. As a player, I don’t really have any deep complaints about HD2 the way I do with DT (current crafting/itemization, dramatically worse FOMO cosmetic approach, etc), and stability (my biggest issue) has improved dramatically. HD2 is still the big 4 person coop shooter among my groups, with DRG close behind.\n\nBy all available metrics, HD2 is still performing better in the market and being received better than DT, even with some bruises.\n\nYknow I never actually tuned in to any official FS streams, what difficulties do they usually play on? I’d imagine Heresy, since that’s engaging enough to watch while not overwhelming like Damnation can get.\n\nAs for overall balance, DT is pretty well-balanced for the most part, with only a few overtuned weapons and abilities. I can’t concretely say which class is the “best”, and although knives are pretty good, nearly all of the alternative options are still very viable to use.\n\nThe biggest pain points I’d say for balance are:\n\nVeteran has a noticeable lack of diversity, due to the strength of Voice of Command being a must-pick and the weakness of Smoke Grenades and alternate auras making them not worth taking most of the time. Also keystones suck lol\n\nZealot can play like an idiot and get away with it far more often than other classes can\n\nUnless a Psyker is using Scrier’s Gaze, which is generally considered the weakest Psyker active ability, they rely on their teammates more than other classes to cover them, in a game where you usually have to handle yourself\n\nOgryns have a very simply strategy that can get dull very quickly for those craving variety\n\n“Heavy weapons” such as the Bolter, Thunder Hammer, and Rumbler are fun, but ultimately weaker than alternatives due to the game’s demand for versatility\n\nBrutal Momentum being a requirement for axes leaves a lot to be desired for blessing variety\n\nThese aren’t RUINING the game, though. It’s still a lot of fun even with this issues (sometimes nitpicks). FS is pretty slow and meticulous with balancing and it shows - I just wish they’d do the same for bugfixing and proper patch note writing.\n\nOh, I thought you were saying to nerf the DT plasma gun the same way the HD2 Incendiary Breaker was nerfed.\n\nI think the Scorcher is fine because it has that very definite downside of the AoE killing you or your teammates if anything jumps close enough. It can’t be used to close bug holes or blow-up fabricators, so it doesn’t have that utility like the crossbow and Erupter does. They should look more at the Plasma Punisher and Purifier before they do anything to the Scorcher.\n\nThe community is completely right in their outrage at the flamethrower nerf tho\n\nIt burning charger legs for the last 6 months wasn’t a problem throughout multiple patches\n\nIt was never listed as a bug for the last six months\n\nBut some how days right before a fire weapon based warbond it’s now a issue that took precedent over bots shooting though mountains and somehow unrealistic despite the whole point of flamethrower literal point is to cook things behind armour.\n\nIt wasn’t op in the slightest it had risk of immolating yourself\n\nForced you to get close to bugs which would leave you open to hunters that would take too long to burn down before getting in a leap attack\n\nChargers still took time, effort and risk to burn down their legs and there are several at once on any actual difficulty\n\nArrowhead do a pretty crappy job at balancing their game at moments like this and going by their major update stream, fundamentally don’t understand the basic mechanics of their own game. Hell the devs were lighting up armoured enemies with small arms completely ignoring the blue reflect effect clearly showing them they are literally doing nothing to the thing, like it was ign playing doom eternal bad.\n\nThey shouldn’t have the low maximum resources. I feel pretty discouraged when I see all these samples, medals, and etc. just thrown into the fire… Similar to Darktide with its RNG.\n\nBut the content release schedule is impressive. Likely had a lot of it ready to drip out before launch though.\n\nDarktide could have earnable premium currency, but I don’t think it should when it’s only cosmetics.\n\nBoth don’t allow you to pick your own missions and people don’t like that about both.\n\nDarktide could do some more procedural generation in their maps like they do.\n\nI think what you’re referring to is when people mentioned a game can succeed without any RNG and deterministic upgrade systems. Or the fact that having weapons be the exact same with no mechanical modifications can work. That you can have a healthy player base without hostile retention tactics.\n\nHelldivers does some things I would like FS to do, but many things I don’t. Also, FS seems much more willing to pull back on controversial changes that impact more than the top 1% of players and go back to the drawing board.\n\nI.E. the shooter changes. I think overall, people generally agree shooters could have some sort of changes, but are very divided on whatever that was that they cooked up before.\n\nMeanwhile, Arrowhead saw how much people enjoy being ragdolled by rockets and decided to add even more sources of them into the game.\n\nJust another one of those situations where increasing difficulty is fine, as long as it isn’t unfun. You can’t reasonably avoid/mitigate every instance of damage like you can in Darktide with enough practice.\n\nWhich is fine! The game is clearly designed around overwhelming odds and high lethality, hence the 20 ticket respawn count. However, losing control of your character is rarely fun and getting ragdolled is only funny the first couple times.\n\nThis is what I think most people think of. Arrowheads track record aside, in theory a specific weapon mark all having the same stat spread and/or enemies having the same stats at all difficulties should make the game easier to balance. It’s just less variables you have to calculate.\n\nUnless like AH all you are doing is looking at % pickrates for weapons in a vacuum and not why a weapon is picked.\n\nAnd then going a step further justifying your poor design decision in the name of selective “realism” because you don’t have a better explanation.\n\nRight. Realism. And the anti-tank mines have the pressure activation threshold of a feather because…?\n\nThis is all conjecture on my part just based on what I’ve seen, but I would chalk that up to Arrowhead pushing most if not all of their resources towards one game at a time.\n\nFS seems to split development across various areas more than AH does.\n\nHelldivers came out in 2015 and received content support for about 2-3 years. HD2 came out just this year, almost 5-6 years after support for the first game was winding down.\n\nMeanwhile FS released both VT1 and Bloodsports TV in 2015, continued to support VT1 until VT2’s release in 2018 and supported that through Darktide’s release in 2022.\n\nBoth studios have a comparable number of employees, about 120 AH to about 190 FS. I think the pace of development may be slower than we desire, but likely as fast as it could reasonably be considering how they spread their resources out thinner.\n\nI’m just glad they let Strawhat out of the mines to talk to us now.\n\nDifferent games, different strategies, was in development for 10 years with a backlog of content to push out to stem any discontent about content drying up. There really is no perfect game studio and I think sometimes people fall prey to “grass is greener on the other side.”\n\nI can’t speak to the balancing, but I do think FS could do an AH route and have content backlogged more often, but without knowing AH inner workings, I’m not sure how sustainable that is for most studios (knowing this had a ten year lead time), especially since the industry is in complete shambles right now."
