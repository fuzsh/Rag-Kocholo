        "text": "All tickets are General Admission at this time. When you arrive at the theater, our House Manager will assign you a seat based on your time of arrival and how many parties are expected for that performance. All seating is based on the discretion of the House Manager.\n\nWhen you arrive at the theater, our House Manager will assign you a seat based on your time of arrival and how many parties are expected for that performance. All seating is based on the discretion of the House Manager.\n\nOur tables are closer together because it’s a nightclub. You’ll always be seated with the people you came with, but expect to make some new friends, too.\n\nWhen a couple hundred people enter a small room at once, the temperature increases anywhere from 8 to 12 degrees…quickly. Even the finest HVAC systems in the world can’t handle that kind of rapid transition well.\n\nIt’s also important to consider that the temperature *on stage* is dramatically different for the actors than it is for you, our audience. Not only are they under hot lights, but they’re constantly moving around…and no one bought tickets to watch a bunch of overheated actors pouring sweat.\n\nSo bring a jacket!\n\nThe Second City respects the individual needs of every single guest who joins us for an experience, including guests requiring accessibility accommodations. The Second City offers services, which can be found on our accessibility page and requested in advance by contacting our Customer Service Team 7 days a week.\n\nBy Phone: 800-896-8120\n\nBy Email: You can also send a request via email to customerservice@secondcity.com\n\nWhen requesting access or purchasing tickets to an accessible show, please indicate which service(s) you are in need of for us to best accommodate you. We look forward to welcoming you!\n\nFirst, let’s define a few terms so we’re all on the same page:\n\nSketch comedy: Scripted, well-rehearsed scenes that we never, ever call “skits.” (And most of us are mighty touchy about that one.)\n\nImprov: The unscripted, spontaneous, collaborative art form Second City is famous for.\n\nStand-Up: The classic one-comic-on-stage-with-a-mic-telling-jokes routine. Think Jerry Seinfeld against a brick wall.\n\nA classic Second City revue is made up of original sketches and songs sprinkled with a healthy dose of our world-famous improv. Second City productions are fully written and rehearsed, but no two shows are ever the same.\n\nOur resident stages (Mainstage, e.t.c., and UP Comedy Club) feature Second City’s headline performances and professional Second City talent. Revues showcase a collection of comedic scenes, characters, songs and more that have been honed and developed by our world-class ensemble. Revues at Second City are hilarious, thoughtful, smart and polished, and they often feature moments of unscripted improvisation, creating a one-of-a-kind night of live theater. These theaters are not available to rent for outside performers.\n\nOur studio theaters (Blackout Cabaret, Judy’s Beat Lounge, Donny’s Skybox, de Maat Studio Theater) may feature:\n\n– Guest Performances: These non-Second City productions are original works created and produced by guest performers and ensembles. With limited runs in The Second City’s Studio Theaters, these performances allow for complete creative freedom and may feature artists of any experience level.\n\n– Training Center Student Performances: These performances feature Second City Training Center students currently enrolled in classes and showcase the skills developed through our various creative programs, including improv, acting, stand-up, music and more.\n\n– Training Center Productions: These are ongoing weekly performance opportunities meant to give Second City Training Center students and graduates more experience on stage.\n\nThese theaters are available to outside performers to rent. If you would like more information on renting a studio theater, please contact Stephanie Case at scase@secondcity.com.\n\nNo way! Although we do not require any food or drink minimums, we do offer a full food and drink menu inside all three of our professional stages. You are more than welcome to place an order once you’ve been seated.\n\nIf you’re looking to sit down before or after the show, all of our locations have feature full service restaurants as well as in-theater dining.\n\n1959 Kitchen & Bar – Chicago\n\nThe Bentwood – Toronto\n\nThe Bentwood – NYC"
