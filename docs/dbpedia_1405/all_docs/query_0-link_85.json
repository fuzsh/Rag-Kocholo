Since then, I have had the opportunity to work with small businesses, non-profit organizations, & large franchise systems.\n\nMy first job while obtaining my Bachelor of Arts, was in an apparel shop creating artwork for schools & colleges. After graduating, I became the Art Director of Kona Ice in 2009. I then started working on various other projects with different artist creating illustrations, web layouts, packaging, animation, social media & more.\n\nI was able to learn so much through that journey that I started my own business.
