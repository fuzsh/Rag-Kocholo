        "text": "Our Long Distance Love Story & The Amazing Photographer Who Captured It All!!!! From the minute we met Shona to the minute we worked with her, she was nothing short of amazing! She made us feel like family the moment we booked an appointment! That's the kind of photographer you want! The kind that will really take the time to listen and pay attention to detail and see your vision! Not only was she professional from the gate this women came into our life and exceeded our expectations to say the least! The engagement and wedding photos she took of us were so breathtaking that every single time we show off our photos the first thing our family and friends say with awe is \"Who took your photos?!\" I get so excited just to show off our images and share her love for photography with anyone I possibly can! The way she captured our unique \"long distance love story\" at the Sacramento Airport left our images timeless, elegant, modern, and SO classy! Even during the stress of getting married during a PANDEMIC she made us both feel like the most special people in the world! She didn't let the pandemic stop her from being there for us on our Wedding Day! She showed up with her mask on and camera ready and on that day she proved to us just how dedicated she was to making us feel important! I definitely recommend her to ANYONE looking to have images that not only tell a story but who want to work with someone that really puts her heart into what she does! My husband and I are so very thankful for her hard work and dedication to us! If I had anything to do with it I would say that she deserves 1 million stars not just 5! Thank you Shona! You are one of a kind! Quincy + Janné\n\nChoosing a wedding photographer is a BIG DEAL because your pictures and albums are memories that you have to hold in the years after the “I do’s”. The excitement of engagement, the anticipation on that special morning before you walk down the aisle, and the rush of love and joy that you feel with your first kiss as a wedded couple. These are all moments and feelings that you want to capture and remember forever, and Shona at Studio 7 Teen does all that and more. I could just post my album as a review…I feel like it speaks for itself as a glowing example of Shona’s work. But the end product (as beautiful as it is) isn’t the only thing I loved about working with Studio 7 Teen. I felt comfortable…which is a lot to say for being a bride. So much about planning a wedding is stress-ridden, but i can honestly say that as far as photography went it was no problem. From the consultation to the day that we received our album, Shona was quick to respond to my calls and very flexible to my tight schedule. We chose a package that had multiple shoots; engagement, wedding, and after-shoot. I highly recommend the after-shoot because it allows you to spend more time with your friends and loved ones on your wedding day. On the wedding day Shona kept cool under seriously trying circumstances (it was 105 degrees that day) and managed to make us all look our best despite the heat. All in all, choosing studio7teen was the best decision I made for out wedding. Thank you Shona, for giving me the pictures that bring back the memories of our special day. -Katy & Justin\n\nIn our opinion Studio 7 Teen photography ranks up there with the greatest greats. When we began our adventure of searching for our wedding photographer we knew it had to be someone special. Someone that could make our wedding day immortal by capturing every detail and preserving our story. It was such a thrill to work with Studio 7teen. The entire wedding party had a great time and were at ease. You were coordinated and well organized. From location to location you ladies were rip roaring and ready to go. The Studio 7 Teen staff had an immense amount of knowledge about their trade. Every pose and location were well researched and well thought out. This made selecting our pictures for our wedding album extremely difficult because every single shot was absolutely gorgeous. We appreciated your flexibility. Studio 7 Teen saw fit that we received the package we wanted, and worked well within our budget. When we purchased our wedding day photography package, it included an \"after-shoot\". Both Peter and myself were unfamiliar to this term prior to meeting you. We are so happy to have met you. Having the wedding after-shoot was the biggest relief to us and the best investment. On the wedding day we were able to spend the most of our time with our loved ones. At the after-shoot a couple weeks later, Peter and I were well rested and relaxed. The shoot was intimate, no pressure from time. The pictures captured at the after-shoot could in no way be replicated, stunning and timeless. Thank you so much for being creative and inspiring. Your art will be proudly displayed in our home for years. We look forward to having you at all the major landmarks of our lives. -Peter & Felicia"
