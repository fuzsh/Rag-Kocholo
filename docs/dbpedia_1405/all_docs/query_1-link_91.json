        "text": "\"I have attended a variety of Pilates, Xtend Barre®, Gyrotonic® & Gyrokinesis® and Yoga Tune Up® Therapy Ball classes at Studio 7 for nearly six years. Studio 7 offers cutting edge classes taught by skilled and knowledgeable professionals in a welcoming and tranquil setting. I feel very fortunate to have access to big city – NYC, Boston – caliber classes and instruction here in the heart of the New Hampshire Seacoast.\"\n\nSUSAN SHEPCARO\n\n\"Joanne, at Studio 7 has been a lifesaver for me. Some 12 years back when the Studio was in it's early days, I had the great fortune of being directed to her from a client of hers. Several health issues led me to know that I needed specialized care in exercising. Joanne's education and clear sense of the physical body have been exactly what I was in need of. She adjusts the exercises daily to meet my concerns, problems or injuries that vary day to day. I always go away feeling great. She is an excellent teacher, a warm and encouraging person, and a very dear friend. I highly recommend her to anyone!\"\n\nJANE MITCHELL\n\n\"I have known Joanne for over ten years and consider her a friend as well as someone who has given me back my health and youthful vigor on more than one occasion. She has always pushed me to be the best that I can be, even when life's setbacks have occurred. She has taught me to walk again and lose a limp after a serious bone break. Love that Xtend Barre®! She finally got rid of my chronic back pain that was persisting for years. Gotta love Gyrotonic®! And what can I say about good old Pilates that at age 63 has still kept me in tight dresses and skinny jeans! Wow! I am grateful and think that everyone should experience her joy, happiness and support!\"\n\nMARLENE ALLEN, Stiletto Shoes"
