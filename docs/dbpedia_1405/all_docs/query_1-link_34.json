        "text": "Spotlight On: Studio 7H Collection\n\nYou'll want to come sit by us then, just around the corner at Studio 7H. It's an imaginary world where very real things happen. Namely, a makeover for a familiar old friend: the furniture collection. It was like pulling a thread. First, a great design on the drawing board. Then another. And more. A credenza that refused to stay put in the dining room. Bedside tables that left their mates. Mulitple wood finishes that stand alone or suit up. Metal mingled into the mix. Sofas and chairs wanted in. At the end of the day, three Studio 7H personas emerged -- Mid-century Modern, Scandinavian and Rustic Chic in about seventy-five pieces -- all singular and mixable and beautiful.\n\nScandinavian\n\nThe great thing about Scandinavian Style is that it points a line back to the original authors of modern design - those inventive Danes, Swedes and Finns. Scandinavian Chic is full of legacy, but conceived for today's spaces. The look is organic and modern - wood finishes are light and thirsty and we've added natural elements like rope and metal to flesh it out. Form and function are important. Pieces can be multi-purposed. Scandinavian style stands alone or can mix with other personas so easily.\n\nMid-Century Modern\n\nMid-Century Modern is everywhere, but we really get into the crux of it here. It's soft modern, but not rigidly interpreted. The low-sheen walnut finish is notable, but we mix it up with metal elements and very versatile forms that can move from room to room and mix with other pieces/personas.

It's not about geography. Rustic Chic happens everywhere. It's new furniture designed and made with a reclaimed vibe. ALL finishes meet in Rustic Chic - the MCM walnut and Scandinavian Chic weathered finishes - plus, metal and leather are also in the lively mix. Repurposing is fundamental. Rustic Chic pieces work all through the house and are especially well suited to mix and mingling."
