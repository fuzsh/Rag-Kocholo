We will provide the artist with space and a box office split of 80/20 per cent in favor of the artist. There are 20+ weekends available in one of our two performance spaces – Julie Ince Thompson Theatre (Studio 1) and Studio 7. It is recommended that the artist have self produced previously and have other funding in place to cover artistic expenses. We encourage a wide spectrum of genres and cultural origins within under-represented communities.\n\nDIY Performance Resources:\n\n*These references are intended to give prospective participants a reference on cost and procedures.
