        "text": "Detailed analysis by the team at Kepios shows that there were 5.17 billion social media users around the world at the start of July 2024, equating to 63.7 percent of the total global population.\n\nSocial media user numbers have continued to grow over the past 12 months too, with 282 million new users joining social media since this time last year.\n\nThat equates to annualised growth of 5.8 percent, at an average rate of 8.9 new users every single second.\n\nThe latest figures indicate that close to 95 percent of the world’s internet users now use social media each month (learn more about people’s broader internet behaviours on our Global Digital Overview page).\n\nHowever, note that figures for social media users may not represent unique individuals, and due to issues like duplicate accounts, social media user figures may exceed the figures that we publish for internet users – or even for total population. This is why we refer to social media user “identities”.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s also worth noting that comparing social media users with figures for total population may under-represent the full extent of social media use, because most social media companies restrict use of their platforms to people aged 13 and above.\n\nAnd for additional context, the latest data suggest that the number of “adult” social media users around the world (i.e. those aged 18 and above) now equates to more than 86 percent of all adults in that age group.\n\nMeanwhile, data from GWI reveals that the typical social media user actively uses or visits an average of 6.7 different social platforms each month, and spends an average of 2 hours 20 minutes per day using social media.\n\nAssuming that people sleep for between 7 and 8 hours per day, these latest figures suggest that people spend roughly 14 percent of their waking lives using social media.\n\nAdded together, the world spends more than 12 billion hours using social platforms each day, which is the equivalent of more than 1.38 million years of human existence.\n\nThe world’s most used social media platforms\n\nApp intelligence from data.ai suggests that YouTube has the greatest number of active users today, giving the platform an index of 100 [note that the top platform in this ranking will always have an index of 100].\n\nWhatsApp and Facebook rank second and third (respectively), with this data suggesting that Meta’s top messaging platform has a greater number of active app users than its top social network.\n\nHowever, data.ai’s figures indicate that YouTube’s audience is roughly 20 percent larger than the audiences of both these Meta platforms.\n\nInstagram ranks fourth, with the platform’s active app users equating to almost 70 percent of YouTube’s active app user base.\n\nFacebook Messenger ranks fifth with an index of 50.1, and Messenger is the only other platform where active app users equate to more than half of YouTube’s active app user base.\n\nTikTok claims sixth place in the latest ranking, but data.ai’s figures suggest that the platform’s active app user base is only 44.7 percent the size of YouTube’s.\n\nMeanwhile, all other platforms have fewer than one-third the number of active app users that YouTube does."
