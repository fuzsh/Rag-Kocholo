She was on cloud nine all day. She even wanted to wear her recital T-shirt to sleep. It was amazing to see the smiles and joy on every dancer. To she her on stage today was such an amazing moment for me as a mom. Thank you for all you do! We are so beyond grateful.”\n\n— Michelle Holzapfel\n\n“Eloise was so excited and confident leading up to the recital, and so proud of herself afterward. I literally said to my husband afterward, sign me up to be a dance mom if this is what it does for kids (and parents)! Such a fun experience, and I hope the first of many recitals for us. Can't wait to see the video! Thank you again for a wonderful year!”\n\n— Stephanie Lee\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to THANK YOU for ALL you have done for all the dancers this year! Recital day is always the best day of the year, but this year it holds an even more extra special place in our hearts! We truly enjoyed every single act!!! The “front end managers” at the Algonquin told me many times that they were so impressed by our dancers and the families and how polite and respectful they were. I told them I truly believe it comes from the top! When “the top” stresses the importance of following the rules for the girls sake, it trickles down in such a positive way! We really can’t thank you enough!”\n\n— steve and leigh white"
