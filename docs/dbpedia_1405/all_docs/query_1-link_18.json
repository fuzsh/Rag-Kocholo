        "text": "Fillers vs. Botox\n\nDermal fillers and botox are both minimally invasive, injectable cosmetic treatments. Both are performed as outpatient procedures in the comfort of your doctor’s office and require minimal downtime. While both can improve the overall appearance of the face, they achieve this in different ways.\n\nBotox is primarily used to treat fine lines and wrinkles. It is a purified form of the botulinum toxin, but is a safe, FDA approved treatment that has been used for several decades now.\n\nBotox works by blocking nerve signals to the muscles that cause fine lines around the eyes, forehead, and mouth, also known as expression lines. By blocking the nerve signals, muscles in the injection site become temporarily paralyzed, thus softening or eliminating wrinkles from the area. These results can last up to three months, and the treatment takes about five minutes to complete.\n\nDermal fillers, on the other hand, are primarily used to rejuvenate the skin and add volume and fullness to various areas of the face. Different brands and types of fillers are made of varying ingredients, including:\n\nHyaluronic acid, such as JUVÉDERM®, Restylane®, and Belotero®\n\nCalcium hydroxylapatite, such as RADIESSE®\n\nPoly-L-lactic acid, such as Sculptra®\n\nPolymethyl-methacrylate microspheres (PMMA), such as Bellafill®\n\nEach of these fillers is designed to treat certain kinds of aging or other cosmetic issues. Depending on which one is used, they can last anywhere from 12 to 24 months. On average, treatment takes approximately 45-60 minutes.\n\nA Range of Benefits\n\nCreates tiny thermal zones in the skin, prompting the body to quickly generate new tissue\n\nIncreases permeability with minimal mechanical disruption to the stratum corneum\n\nTreats mild to moderate cases of actinic keratosis, benign pigmented lesions, lentigos, and freckles across the face, neck, and\n\nDécolletage\n\nHarnesses 20 Watts of power to ensure the fastest, most consistent laser\n\nHow It Works\n\nUltra™ is the superior solution to maintaining skin. Equipped with a 200 ¼m beam diameter, Ultra’s magnetic roller tracking system can complete a full-face treatment in only 6-8 minutes. Virtually painless and with little to no downtime, LaseMD Ultra is essential for every aesthetic practice.\n\nKey Benefits\n\nUnmatched power ensures fast treatments that are adaptable to multiple skin areas\n\nGentle yet comprehensive enhancements to improve all skin types year-round\n\nProvides comfortable treatments with very little downtime and instant results for pigment, sun damage, tone, and texture\n\nAn intuitive display simplifies navigation and provides practitioners with essential insights for consistently achieving exceptional results\n\nDo Ultra treatments cause any discomfort for patients?\n\nPatients may experience mild to moderate discomfort depending on their pain tolerance and treatment settings. For sensitive patients or treatments involving relatively high settings, practitioners can use topical numbing cream to enhance comfort.\n\nHow long is the treatment and recovery period?\n\nA session can range from 5 to 20 minutes depending on the size of the target area. After the procedure, patients may experience mild redness but can immediately resume regular activities. Complete healing typically takes 5 to 7 days.\n\nHow many treatments are required to achieve the best results?\n\nThe number of sessions needed varies according to patient expectations. While some individuals may notice results after a single session, others might require a series of treatments to achieve their desired outcome.\n\nIs Ultra safe for all skin types?\n\nYes! Anyone can benefit from Ultra’s cutting-edge technology\n\nBotox mixed with lidocaine is inserted directly to the trigger point. After 2 weeks, this loosens the knot in the muscle, supplying relief. More frequently, patients feel positive effects from trigger point therapy after several regularly scheduled visits. The most effective results usually come from a combination of treatments, including some or all of the following: manual adjustments, Botox injections, massage, heat therapy, ice packs, electrical stimulation, and ultrasound. Recovery from an injury is generally shortened by trigger point therapy. Compression of a trigger point may provoke a response of local tenderness, referred pain, sometimes accompanied by muscle twitch, or motor dysfunction, but this is diagnostic and temporary.\n\nTrigger points generally develop due to muscle overload which may result from injury, muscular atrophy due to illness, or excessive exercise. The precipitating cause of trigger point development is usually ischemia, or blood loss. The nodules that appear in the deep muscle tissue are considered to be small knots of spasmodic muscle contraction.\n\nTrigger point therapy should not be painful, though it is likely to be somewhat more uncomfortable than a typical massage. Patients are advised to speak up if the pressure causes real pain, since it is important for the therapist to receive ongoing feedback. In most cases, the discomfort experienced is described by patients as “good pain” since it is followed immediately by relaxation of muscle tension in the problem area. Trigger point therapy is designed not for general relaxation, but to target a particular region It may be used to relieve pain or increase range of motion due to:\n\nHeadaches\n\nWhiplash, falls, sports injury\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\n\nOsteoarthritis\n\nFibromyalgia\n\nMany patients are sore in the day or two following a trigger point treatment. This is normal and expected, like the discomfort after a strenuous physical workout. Increased hydration is recommended after trigger point therapy to shorten recovery time."
