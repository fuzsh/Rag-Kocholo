Alexis's passion for providing a luxurious and relaxing experience is just an added bonus to her quality of work. The lashes are soft, natural and long lasting. I would (and have many times) recommend Alexis & Studio Seven to anyone.

I loved my recent spray tan with Maggie! Whether it’s your first spray tan or 50th- she makes sure that you are comfortable and educated on after care to make your spray tan last. She even has different scents for your tan so that you don’t have that spray tan smell for your upcoming event.

Paige was great! She set the mood with my favorite artist and made sure I was super comfortable before my service. She was very thorough and attentive every step of the way. 10/10 would recommend
