By following and supporting a young Slovenian rock’n’roll band Joker Out, STUDIO7 started to develop it’s own show production support. It organically grew from producing a small venue to producing a big arena show including our presence on the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest, where we supported the 2023 Slovenian delegation. By collaborating on multiple local and international shows and tours, we gained valuable experience we offer to share with our future clients.

PRODUCING THE SHOW

From the initial idea, we can lead you through the process of connecting the right ideas with the right people who can execute the show under our supervision.

SHOW & EVENT MARKETING

Setting up the right marketing strategy and communication of the show is the key for successful ticket sales. We offer you a variety of outdoor, web, social media and TV advertising options to successfully sell out your shows.

STAGEING PERFORMANCE

We are able to connect talents and develop a full staging CuePilot based performance for artists that require an environment with full control over monitoring process.

LIVE LED VIDEO PLAYOUT

Offering live video playout if your show includes any sort of LED or projection mapping. With different types of levels we can assure a bigger view of the live performance.

PROJECTION & LED VISUALS

Collaborating with various talented visual artists, we can help you find the right fit and supervise the development, production and realisation of projection visuals.

CONCERT & SHOWCASE FILM

We can produce a concert film for your needs or extend it into a showcase video you can use for the audience to see the behind the scenes of the show.
