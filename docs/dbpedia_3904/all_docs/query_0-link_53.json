        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nON A PROMISING SEPTEMBER DAY, I’m searching for Bill Mason on the blue-water edge of the Canadian Shield, north of Sault Ste. Marie. Lake Superior has been calm as I have made my way west from Michipicoten Mission. The fall sun has reached its zenith and is noticeably lower in the sky than just weeks ago; my left side is hot, but there’s a chill creeping in from the shadows on my right. Swells begin to rise from the direction of Devil Island or Michigan or wherever it is that the character of this lake originates. They lift and settle this canoe as if I’m paddling on the back of a benevolent monster. Fortunately, the boat has been here before—Bill’s boat. It knows the beast. There is safety in that.\n\nBill’s widow, Joyce, has lent me this loved, old 16-foot Chestnut Prospector. The red canvas is cracked and faded. The ribs and planks are brittle. But the slat seats still squeak, and that nostalgic smell of cedar and old varnish wafts up from the sun-warmed floor as I make my way along the coast. The plan is to visit some of Bill’s favourite haunts. Today I’m headed for Denison Falls and will sleep there in one of his old Baker tents. The boat spins as a rogue wave rolls under its keel, turning me broadside in the troughs. It’s a great old canoe, but too small for a lake this size to notice. Time to head upriver. I fight to maintain balance as the waves break and tumble back in the shallow water along the sand spit that protects the river from the lake. I catch a curler and surf into the calm water on the other side.\n\nThe sign on the first inside says Dog River. Since 1632. Somebody’s trying to make a point. Bill always called this river The University. He always talked about a cherished spot a couple of miles upstream from the lake: Denison Falls. He filmed it, painted it, described it in his books. I’ve come along the coast to pay my respects.\n\nTwo or three bends upstream from the sign, I’m debating with myself whether I’m actually gaining or losing ground against the current. Should I pull a little harder and get to that eddy there, and then across to that big rock over there? Travelling alone like this, talking to myself, reminds me of Friar Tuck and the way he muddled through Sherwood Forest supplying both sides of a running argument. Bill prayed a lot when he was out here. Maybe now is the time. Or should I forgo the upstream paddling, save breaking my paddle on the bottom as I flail to make headway, and start tracking up the shore?\n\nI tie lines to the bow and stern painter rings, let the boat angle freely into the current, coil up the loose ends and begin making my way unsteadily along the boulder bank of the river. It’s not a very big river and the water appears to be low, but it’s surprising how much pull the canoe exerts on the ropes. Looking back at the empty red canoe, I am caught by a momentary twinge of deep sadness. Bill is gone.\n\nThe valley is deep here, and the trees are mostly birches and conifers with a few mountain ash sprinkled with vermilion berries. The forest hues are bronze, not red. Lofty hemlocks diffuse sunlight into cascades of laughing riparian light that follows me up the valley, highlighting the banks. Behind, the gulls, the noisy birds, have stayed to argue on the spit. But for the most part, the forest here is quiet. Ahead, the river chuckles away on rocks and riffles centre stream. I turn and look again at the red canoe silhouetted against the shining river, somehow expecting him to be sitting there, feet up, enjoying the free ride.\n\nI’m doing my best not to get wet feet, but before long the boat catches on a gravel bar and I must wade in, in my wellies, to move it. Three steps later I’ve got one long, tall soaker; then the other. The river is not all that deep, and it’s not all that fast-flowing, but there is a current and the canoe feels heavy on the lines. One almighty tug, one slip, and I’m wet to the waist.\n\nTwo hours later, I’m thoroughly soaked, tired but pleased to be reaching a sharp left swing in the river where the map says the falls are supposed to be. I pull up the canoe by an eddy and slosh my way up the shore to catch a glimpse of this place that so caught Bill’s fancy. There it is, Denison Falls, running across the river, maybe 20 feet high. I’m surprised. Like the man, perhaps, it looks bigger in the films.\n\nI strip—even in an out-of-the-way place like this, it’s a trick to convince yourself that you are in fact alone—and carefully lay out my wet shirt, pants and red woollen socks on the smooth grey rocks to dry in the sun. Barefoot, I make my way back up the rock-strewn riverbed to the base of the falls. There’s another rushing stream coming in on the right—Jimmy Cash Creek. It’s almost more appealing than the big falls. Nice spot, but it is difficult to imagine why Bill got so excited about this place. Denison Falls seems pretty ordinary.\n\nThere appears to be a steep trail that starts at the point where a worn hawser dangles from an overhanging cedar tree down a vertical rock face beside the falls. I haul myself up the rock, scramble up the trail and make my way through the bushes, apparently cutting high across another sharp bend in the river. Then, suddenly, I’m aware of a physical murmuring in the air and the ground around me. Under a deadfall, a few more excited steps along the path, and I’ve found what Bill discovered more than thirty years ago.\n\nThe path opens to an outlook commanding a stirring view of Denison Falls. It begins above me in the coloured hills on the far side of the river, a line of black water steps out over a mist-shrouded brink; it splits with abandon on a pillar of black rock, wheels with a flick to the crowd, then bubbles itself into a filigreed fan that flutters and falls to the river below. The view suspends time, for an instant, for an hour. Bill always said he felt closer to God in places like this. Just breathing the mist-dampened air makes the transcendency of that notion close enough to touch.\n\nSometime later, shadows lengthen and I start to get cold. Surely those clothes arc dry by now. I return on the path, climb under the broken tree and down the steep, slippery path, onto the rope gingerly—it’s different trusting your life to a line when you’ve seen the extent of its tenuous anchor close up—and back down to the river below. I pick up and pull on my jeans and shirt. Bending to get my socks, I find only one, lying flat and crispy on the rock. The other is gone. Gone. Gulls might steal a sock, but not now, not in the fall, and besides they’re probably still bickering at the lake. The only bird I’ve seen all day is a circling lone osprey. The sock, apparently, has just vanished.\n\nIt’s classic Mason. I start to laugh. The silliness of the missing sock is too much. For a minute I’m certain that a puckish Bill is hiding in the trees somewhere nearby, with his battered hat and his favourite canoeing shirt, killing himself laughing and waving one red sock on a stick for all the otherly world to see. It was his kind of joke. Mason, you little weasel, what have you done with my sock? I call exasperatedly in a voice that is swallowed without echo by the autumnal woods.\n\nAnd so it has been for nearly two years now looking for Bill Mason, checking out his favourite spots, talking to his friends and family, following his trail from one side of the country to the other. Writing the story of his life has been a little like the Denison Falls trip, hoping chance and serendipity might leaven safe, scholarly instincts. Bill’s geographic lifeline links Winnipeg, where he was born, to Old Chelsea, Quebec, where he died. I’ve found it helpful to think of his life as a gradual eastward movement, over time, away from Winnipeg, east past Lake of the Woods, Quetico, the north shore of Superior, and Algonquin Park, to Ottawa. His career rises gradually along that line through the making of Paddle to the Sea, Rise and Fall of the Great Lakes and his other early films, climaxing with the release of Cry of the Wild, his feature film about wolves that outsold every film except The Exorcist in its first week of release in New York City. The wolf film days were the high times that led to a turning-point in his life in the mid-1970s. Mason was dining with the Queen, playing broomball with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and being asked to speak around the world. At this point in his career, on the occasion of his investiture as a film maker into the Royal Canadian Academy, he startled his University of Manitoba School of Art colleague and previous RCA inductee, Tony Tascona, with the news that he was going to quit filming and turn back to painting, his first love. It was a transition he struggled with for the rest of his life.\n\nBeing a keen paddler myself, following Bill the canoeist was easy. It was the best excuse yet for getting out to the wild. Getting at Bill the artist, however, was a very different story. I began these explorations by attempting to whittle a likeness of Paddle to the Sea using Holling C. Holling’s famous children’s book as a guide, just as Bill had done. It was a chance to think with my hands, as Bill frequently did. But the task was much more difficult than I had ever imagined. Artistically, the result was disappointing. Carving the canoe, with its many symmetries, was facile, but bringing form—and proportion—to the little Indian figure was another story. In the end, when the Band-Aids were all used up, and the work as finished as I could make it, I was frustrated and a little embarrassed at the tawdry effort. I simply dumped Paddle on the basement bench to collect dust, until the summer.\n\nI threw in Paddle and a few old jars of Testor’s model paint, almost as an afterthought, packing for our annual summer pilgrimage to Nova Scotia. Paddle would go to the sea, and maybe that would release a little of his Masonian wisdom. On a day when it was too hot to swim or even walk the flats, I got out Paddle and, hesitantly at first, began to apply the paint. Almost magically the wood came to life. Our two young daughters began inviting their beach friends to hold Paddle while perusing the dog-eared book. On sleep-overs there were fights about who would hold Paddle while the book was being read. And in that transformation I glimpsed the world for an instant through Bill Mason’s eyes. To everyone else who bought the book at Eaton’s in Winnipeg back in the 1940s, and since, Paddle to the Sea was a charming story about a carved wooden toy. To Bill, who purchased the book in his teens, Paddle was a magical being he could bring to life and share with children and adults around the world through the medium of film. From the moment Bill saw the illustrations in the book, Paddle was alive in his imagination. It would take him nearly fifteen years to transfer the vision in his head to moving images on the cinematic screen, but that is exactly what he did.\n\nAnd so began the career of one Canada’s most prolific and successful film makers—eighteen films; sixty-odd honours, including two American Academy Award nominations and two British Academy Awards; and a gilded international reputation as a sensitive creator, canoeist and voice of wilderness preservation. The strange thing is that, while everyone, it seems, loved Bill Mason’s work in film, Bill could never rest on his accomplishments. Perhaps the greatest burden he carried with him—and one substantiated by his faith and sense of artistic mission—was the need to seek out the next challenge, never to rest on his accolades. The story of his life that you are about to read is one of enviable success, creative freedom, supportive family, tantalizing projects and a life’s work that most artists in the world of film can only dream about. But in walking Bill’s path, in seeking out his favourite locations, his friends, co-workers and family—in efforts to explore his life comprehensively, I have uncovered a story that has its moments of great sadness and disappointment. Bill Mason died at 59 with every kudos, every success, every award a film maker could hope to achieve, but, ironically, he may have died a resolutely frustrated artist, his pass ing coincident with the tumultuous end of one career and the trepidatious beginning of another.\n\nI knew Bill, but primarily for only one period of his life, when we collaborated on several projects in the 1980s. Even with those sporadic encounters I had learned to admire his qualities as a canoeist, a dreamer and a lover of adventure who would much sooner go out the door than in. There was something about Bill that drew people to him. What kind of person would win almost every award possible for film making and then quit making films because, he said, he was really a painter? What kind of person would impel strangers to name their children in his honour? What kind of person would move other strangers to tears on hearing the news of his death?\n\nI started this book with a clear destination in mind, like the North Pole from Guelph, Ontario, to celebrate Bill’s life and work, and to answer a few of these questions. But a life, it turns out, is more complicated than I had ever imagined. Bill Mason was a son, a brother, a father, a husband and a film maker who loved to create with his hands and who lived to canoe; but like other Canadian heroes, Mason was also a mythical character, larger than life, wilderness man—white beard, floppy hat, plaid shirt, red bandana, cutoffs and a long summer tan—keeper of the wild, painter in the red canoe. It helps to begin to think about Bill first as a person, a person from whom an enduring myth emerged. Bill the man had a life that could be portrayed as points on a line—significant events, achievements and contradictions ordered in time. Bill the myth was a much more elusive character; the wilderness icon was created by Bill himself, first in the process of editing Cry of the Wild and later the Path of the Paddle series, but it very quickly developed a life energized elsewhere. These two Bill Masons lead to at least two intertwining obligations for his biographer: the first demands that life be written as linear, birth at one end, death at the other; the writer’s obligation is to demarcate significant points on the line and to highlight patterns that emerge, to highlight the facts. But, as writer and paddler Robert Perkins remarked, Life is what happens between the facts. Put another way, poet Bronwyn Wallace characterized this other human essence as powered by the stubborn particulars of grace.\n\nAt one level, this story of Bill Mason’s life is an assemblage of facts. But I hope there is also, within these words, a prospect for readers to see between the facts, to ponder the stubborn particulars, even to imagine that a life isn’t linear at all; some lives are spherical and have at their centre a focus, or essence, around which everything else is ordered and from which a vital talent is derived. This is a story about one man, but—depending on one’s point of view and the extent to which Bill’s life is seen as facts or particulars, as a line or a circle—this is also a more universal story in which a reader might find him-or herself or something elemental about red canoes, white water and the lure of the wilderness.\n\nThe curious thing about Bill Mason’s huge popularity and influence was his simplicity. My favourite images of him—and the ones, I suspect, that have made the most difference in changing the way we think about who we are and where we live—are those of a solitary, far from the adulation, alone in his red canoe in a wilderness like Algoma or Algonquin Park. There he is oblivious to man or machine, paddling, watching, listening, suspended in a reverie piqued by regard for nature and fixed by faith that there is a lesson to be learned from immersion in the Canadian wild. Sometimes, when I’m alone on the water, I hear the chatter of waves on the shore and the scolding of a red squirrel in the pines; at other times, I’m sure it’s Bill’s hearty laugh I hear on the wind. But in a blink he is gone, leaving only the rhythmic dip of cherry paddle in bright water, and the echoes of a uniquely Canadian story.\n\nJR.\n\nSeeley’s Bay, Ontario\n\nNovember 1995\n\n1\n\nTHE MAN AND THE RED CANOE\n\nA SINGLE RED CANOE PIVOTS playfully next to the Mississippi River in Carleton Place, southwest of Ottawa. Evening light warms its chipped wooden gunwales and shadows its gentle curve from stem to stern. Star bursts of tiny cracks and scratches in the patina of painted canvas give a sheen to the boat as it turns in rhythm with the music. Underneath, balancing the canoe on his shoulders, blasé about poise or whom he might hit in the process, is a diminutive man in grey flannels, white shirt and burgundy tie. It is only when the twirling canoe narrowly misses the bride, clapping in a joyous circle of family and friends, that someone grabs the dangling painter as it sweeps across the polished dance floor, stops the pirouette and leads the man outside and back to the river. A spontaneous cheer rises above the music. People applaud and hoot for the spirit of the man, Canada’s own Mr. Canoehead—Bill Mason—dancing as only he would, at his son’s wedding.\n\nIt is June 18, 1988. Mason’s 5-foot 4-inch, 130-pound frame is tanned and lean. He will be sixty on his next birthday, and there is much to celebrate. Son Paul, with whom he paddled so many Canadian rivers in the making of his best-selling instructional films and canoeing books in the Path of the Paddle series, has found a new paddling partner; he is growing up, moving on, marrying the love of his life. At the wedding Mason is surrounded by family—wife, Joyce; daughter, Becky; sister, Elizabeth; nephews, nieces and relatives of every stripe—from Winnipeg and the greater Ottawa area. He has just given Paul and his new bride, Judy, a hand-drawn card on which a cartoon character asks them to select one red Chestnut Prospector canoe from the pile at the Mason homestead at Meech Lake for their wedding present. Paul and Judy paddled to the Carleton Place Canoe Club, after a simple marriage ceremony in a nearby church, and now Bill is celebrating their new life together, remembering old times, in the only way he knows how—with a canoe and a laugh and a show for the audience.\n\nAnyone who looked closely that night as Bill Mason danced with his beloved Prospector canoe in the Carleton Place Canoe Club would have seen a hospital identification bracelet tucked under the starched cuff of his dress shirt. Two days before the wedding, he had been admitted to Ottawa Civic Hospital for tests to get to the root of a serious intestinal problem. He had signed himself out for the wedding. On the day following the wedding, the Sunday, before returning to the hospital, he canoed whitewater on the Petite Nation River, north of Ottawa, with his nephews from Winnipeg and other wedding guests. On Monday he underwent a CAT scan and on Tuesday he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In four months he would be dead, at fifty-nine.\n\nDuring his life Bill Mason captivated the hearts of people across Canada and around the world. He became an icon for wilderness, with his floppy hat, white beard, plaid shirt and red canoe. His last six films—four in the Path of the Paddle series, and two features, Song of the Puddle and Waterwalker—made Bill a canoe legend. Two books about canoeing, which grew out of the film work, cemented his place in canoeing history. And while people, young and old, turned to Mason’s books and films for advice on canoeing—the technique, the stroke details, the how-to goods on every aspect of the sport—they also got tips on how to relate to nature. Over the years there have been dozens of instructional books and films produced by and for canoeists but what drew fans and admirers and set Bill in a class of his own was the man himself—the man who could not hide his love for life, for canoes and for the wilderness, even if he had wanted to; the man who would dance with his canoe.\n\nHad Mason plopped his red canoe in the water that night, instead of returning to the wedding, he would have paddled downstream, as he had done countless times previously, past Appleton, Almonte, Pakenham, and out to Arnprior, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ottawa rivers. Since leaving Winnipeg in 1959, he had made the Ottawa valley his home, a voyageur highway swelled at every turn by Quebec waters to the north and Ontario streams to the south. With his friend Wally Schaber, he had crashed down the steep Laurentian hills on the Quebec side every spring on rivers like the Dumoine, Black, Fildegrande, Coulonge, Picanoc and Petite Nation; and on lazy summer days and the misty mornings of late August he had made his way down the big rivers of Algonquin Park, including the Petawawa, Barron, Madawaska and Opeongo. He travelled with friends and family, anybody he could cajole into joining him for 5:00 A.M. departures, and stopped to paint or to listen to the way the echoes of a loon change as the air gets crisp and cold. And just for fun, on an afternoon whim, he had sometimes filled his boat with truck inner tubes and gone for a whitewater frolic on the main channel of the Ottawa, at Beachburg, or for a flatwater toot on the Bonnechere, the Jock or the Mississippi, stopping in at Carleton Place for ice cream or a glass of cold water.\n\nHad he carried on down the Ottawa, even solo and in the dark, past Masson, Thurso, Papineauville, Hawkesbury and Montreal, he would have relived other adventures—his nights at the National Film Board in Montreal, his days with Blake James in the Gaspé, looking for locations to shoot the ocean scenes for Puddle to the Sea. And should he have stopped for the night to sleep in his cherished Baker tent, he would have set it up with a view of the stars and the crescent moon and, long after the candle had been extinguished, would have dreamed of places and possibilities for a man and his canoe.\n\nAnybody who ever talked to Bill Mason would learn that his favourite canoe trip was the one he had just finished. After canoeing the Nahanni, he raved about that; after the Hood River trip with singer Bruce Cockburn, he raved about that, though he wouldn’t tell people how disappointed he felt on encountering silence after running to the top of an esker and howling his head off expecting a chorus of wolves to reply. After the Dumoine, he might speak rapturously about the nuance of change in rapids as water levels rise and fall, or he might complain about the garbage he’d found on the big campsite on Lac Benoit. And after a day’s outing on the Mississippi, he would say it was his favourite because it is so beautiful and so close to home, or because he happened to see there a flight of geese heading south against the sun. Or he might duck the questions altogether and just say, C’mon, let’s go. It’s too nice a day to sit around gabbing!\n\nUnconventional though it may be to begin a person’s life story at its end, the image of Bill at his son’s wedding is highly symbolic of a man who loved his canoe, who cherished life and who defined himself and spoke to the world as much through his actions as through his words. Bill rarely danced in the conventional way—or at least, not very often, according to his wife, Joyce—but in so far as dancing is action charged with the rhythm of its surroundings and with the zest of its actor, Bill Mason was a dancer for his whole life—Mr. Bojangles with a camera and a canoe, full of life, full of passion.\n\nIn his actions and in the rich experiences of his life, Bill crystallized or a generation the Canadian wilderness tradition and wisdom of his elders, among them Ernest Thompson Seton, Grey Owl, Tom Thomson, Calvin Rutstrum, Sigurd Olson and Eric Morse. Look closely at Bill’s life, though, and it’s full of paradox: he was not a great reader, and yet he carried the words of the masters in his heart and conveyed them in his work; he thrived on the company of others and loved the comradeship of team sports—especially hockey in the starched blue winter air of Winnipeg and Meech Lake—and yet he craved solitude for his painting. Collaboration with others was in many ways the bane of his professional film making; he was inarticulate, not handy with words, and yet he was a masterful storyteller, writing award-winning film scripts and best-selling canoe books; he was physically small and was sick much of his life with asthma and various other life-threatening conditions, and yet he became the epitome of the robust wilderness man, the modern-day voyageur, travelling the woods alone, heaving his canoe through haystacks and souse-holes in the wildest of rapids, and carrying huge packs over craggy trails all through the Canadian Shield; he could sit for hours—days even—at an editing table in his film studio at Meech Lake, and yet, when it came to painting, he always said the biggest problem was sitting still long enough to finish an image. Catchy contradictions worth exploring.\n\nWhen Bill died in his log home on the shores of Meech Lake on October 29, 1988, his passing was marked by almost every national newspaper, radio and television outlet in the country, noting his legacy of films and books and his presence as part of the environmental movement. In time, when the popularity of his films was documented, Bill Mason would emerge as the most successful film maker in the history of the National Film Board of Canada, Records would show that, as a body of work, his films were borrowed, purchased and seen by more people than those of any other NFB film maker since the inception of the Film Board in 1939. And from his work at the NFB comes another central informing image from this fascinating life.\n\nIn Paddle to the Sea, Mason’s first film with the NFB, there are many memorable images that include the carved toy canoe and its Indian occupant: a snake swimming up and over Paddle as he sits in a marshy backwater; Paddle getting away from a little boy who finds him on the shore of a lake, and the boy’s dog refusing to fetch the little canoe; Paddle going over Niagara Falls; Paddle being caught in a raging forest fire. The adversity this little figure overcame in many ways parallels the early years of a young boy born on the banks of the Red River. Close up, that life was fraught with scrapes, moments of unspeakable strife, ups and downs to shake the most resilient of characters, meanders and backwaters to test even the most patient of souls. But, from a distance, especially with the broad vision of time, there was pattern, flow and purpose—destiny even—in Bill’s life, moving ever forward on the river that was his faith and his belief in himself.\n\n2\n\nCANOES AT GRAND BEACH\n\nIT WAS A WONDER THAT THE BOY survived at all. Born William Clifford Mason in Winnipeg’s Victoria Hospital on April 29,1929, the first child of Sadie and Bill Mason was a very tiny baby. Anyone who came to visit the proud mother in hospital would have seen her struggle not to panic when the baby rasped and coughed. From the beginning, he was beset with respiratory problems, leading later to asthma, which would pester him into adolescence. On those first nights in the hospital, someone would have to sit him up and massage his back to help him breathe. Thinking about those at once joyous and worrisome days, Sadie remembers fearing at times that her son would expire from lack of breath. After the doctor decided to allow the baby to be taken home, Sadie Mason—by instinct, pure determination or a combination of both—would sleep, as only a mother would, in Bill’s room in a little bed beside his crib, listening for the slightest wheeze. Night after night she would take him in her arms, feed him, rub his back and sing him to sleep. When Sadie got too tired to continue, she would go into the next room and wake her husband, who would take his turn walking with Bill to ease his breathing. People remarked at the time that, even with all the love and care his parents provided, it was astonishing that the child prevailed.\n\nThe Winnipeg into which Bill was born was a crumbling commercial and industrial empire, soon to be devastated, like the rest of the country, by the Great Depression. The Canadian Pacific Railway, which had come to Winnipeg fifty years earlier, had brought with it manufacturing and service industries that made the city the wholesale, administrative and financial hub of the West. But, in 1919, the Winnipeg General Strike signalled the start of serious economic decline and social ferment in the proud city. By April 1929, in what was called The Bull’s Eye of the Dominion, factories were closing and unemployment was rising at unprecedented rates. But though he was born at the beginning of the Depression, Bill Mason was spared the indignity and hardship felt by many Winnipeggers of the time: his father and both grandfathers had work, and the family home was warm and filled with the helping hands of grandmothers, and other relatives from both sides of the family who did what they could to help him get started in the world.\n\nIt was a stable, conservative home environment. Mason’s father and namesake, William Thomas Mason, had moved to Winnipeg with his parents as a boy, from Birmingham, England, in the early part of the century. He grew up during the city’s boom years, graduating from Grade 11 at age sixteen and finding employment immediately as a clerk with the Great West Life Insurance Company, where he remained—reluctantly, as time progressed—until retirement. Bill Sr. was twenty-five when son Bill was born. By then he had been at Great West Life for nearly a decade, and with Sadie’s careful budgeting they had been able to purchase a small white two-storey frame house in South Winnipeg.\n\nLike her husband, Sadie Fair was also the child of a family that had emigrated from the Old Country, in this case, Dublin, Ireland. She met Bill Sr. at a United Church Sunday school in St. Vital, another suburb of Winnipeg, where her friend May lived. Even after Sadie completed high school and went to work at the T. Eaton Company in Winnipeg, she continued to visit May. It was on one of those weekend visits that she met the man she would marry. After that first meeting, the dashing young Mason kept sidling up to May, enquiring hopefully, Why don’t you ask Sadie to come up and stay for the weekend? And why don’t you bring her to Sunday school again? Sadie knew that her mother was set on another fellow for her, but fell in love with the handsome lad with a career position at Great West Life, and married him instead.\n\nFor the seven years prior to the birth of his sister, Elizabeth Catherine, Bill Jr. lived the life of an only child. He was frail and small, and his mother fussed over him constantly. The Masons lived at 162 Morley Avenue in the suburb of Riverview, an orderly grid of lots and modest houses tucked inside a sweeping oxbow in the Red River, just south of the place where La Verendrye had built Fort Rouge in 1738, at the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red rivers. Bill’s father would leave in the morning and walk west, past neatly planted boulevard hardwoods that in later years would arch over the streets, shading the wonderful old neighbourhood. On Sundays, Bill and his parents would take that same sidewalk, west to Osborne Street, where they would catch the Park Line street car and head north to church in the centre of town. Almost as soon as he could walk, and certainly as soon as he could draw, little Billy would accompany his parents to church, where he would often position himself on his knees on the floor, facing the pew between his parents. Here he would draw while the preacher delivered the message of the day. In those preschool years, Bill created elaborate drawings in church—of trucks and buildings, fires and fire engines—and on the way back south on the street car he would regale his parents with elaborate narratives of what was going on in his work, who was doing what to whom and why.
