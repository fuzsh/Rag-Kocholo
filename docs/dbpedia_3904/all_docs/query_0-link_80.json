        "text": "So few animal documentaries for family viewing are filmed these days that one called \"Cry of the Wild\" is doubly welcome. Even so, don't be misled by those television trailers, heralding a close-up study of snarling wolves in the wild.While the footage has an atmospheric opening and closing in the Canadian Arctic, the wolf pack we see here in fascinating and remarkably intimate detail is roaming a carefully surveyed forest enclosure near Quebec. This middle portion of the picture, which was produced by the National Board of Canada and had a multitheater opening yesterday in the metropolitan area, is superb. At one Manhattan theater yesterday, the uptown Olympia, a capacity audience of children and parents drank it in raptly. No wonder.The picture has a curious history. Made in 1972, running only 50 minutes and titled \"Death of a Legend,\" it was widely shown nontheatrically (schools, clubs, etc.). This release is its first theattrical exposure, through an American company, with a new title and 40 more minutes of the original footage restored.This footage is undoubtedly the prelude, which zeroes in scenically but rather meanderingly on the Canadian wilds, as the director-photographer, Bill Mason, and a narrator, generalize factually about the wolves, who snarl away in the distance.It's another matter entirely back at the Mason enclosure, with the charming Mason family overseeing their semi-tame pack. The camera records the animals' life cycle, including tribal hierarchy, feeding rituals, courtship and birth. A candid, tastefully shown birth sequence of a litter, with the wolf as tenderly solicitous as a doe, is a touching, even beautiful sight."
