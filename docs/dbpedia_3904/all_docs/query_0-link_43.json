        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The UCLA men’s basketball team and athletics department are mourning the loss of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, who died at the age of 71 following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday.\n\nWalton, a UCLA basketball icon, led the Bruins to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, with two straight 30-0 records, which was part of the program’s historic span of seven consecutive NCAA championships from 1967 to 1973, under legendary UCLA coach John Wooden.\n\nWalton still stands No. 1 on UCLA’s career rebounding list at 1,370 and was three-time Naismith College Player of the Year and Academic All-American during his three years on varsity (1972-74).\n\n“On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA men’s basketball coach Mick Cronin said. “My deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones. It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\n\n“As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.”\n\nThe San Diego native, who attended Helix High School, was Coach Wooden’s starting center for three seasons (1971-74). In his three varsity seasons, Walton never lost a game at Pauley Pavilion (49-0). He was a consensus first-team All-America selection in all three varsity seasons, as freshmen were not allowed to play varsity when enrolled at UCLA in 1970.\n\nWalton, a UCLA Athletics Hall of Famer since 1984, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, six years after his NBA career that spanned from 1974-1987 ended.\n\nThe college basketball star was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and helped lead them to the 1977 NBA championship and was named the NBA MVP in 1978. He battled injuries in his professional career. After leaving Portland, he played for the San Diego Clippers and the Los Angeles Clippers, before retiring with the Boston Celtics, where he helped win the 1986 NBA championship.\n\n“We are stunned and saddened about the news of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said. “Bill represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear and embodied multiple traits on Coach Wooden’s Pyramid of Success.\n\n“He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.”\n\nWalton’s No. 32 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s No. 33 (known in college as Lew Alcindor) became the first two UCLA men’s basketball players to have their jersey numbers retired on Feb. 3, 1990. Since then, UCLA has retired the jersey numbers of 10 former men’s basketball players.\n\nWalton, who passed surrounded by family, is survived by his wife of 33 years, Lori; his four sons, Adam, Nathan, Luke and Chris; and his three grandchildren, Olivia, Avery Rose and Chase.\n\nRELATED:\n\nBill Walton, UCLA great, NBA Hall of Famer, broadcasting star, dies at age 71\n\nBill Walton dies: Social media reacts to the news"
