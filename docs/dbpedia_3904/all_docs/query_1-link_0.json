        "text": "This documentary is about wolves and the impact upon and from humans. It is quite graphic in nature but is an accurate reflection on the tug-of-war between those that want to save the wolves and those that want to exterminate them completely. Both viewpoints are represented equally. On the one hand we have a beautiful intelligent creature that lives in packs with social rules which has roamed the earth for thousands of years minding its own business. On the other hand we have a cold-blooded predator which is a bane for ranchers, farmers and those living in remote areas, killing livestock, children and family pets. When the government steps in to protect the species the conflicts escalate between businessmen and animal rights activists. Not for small children but a great discussion tool for high school and college students."
