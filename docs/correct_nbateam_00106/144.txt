LOS ANGELES (AP) The Los Angeles Clippers and free agent Kenyon Martin have agreed to a one-year deal, returning the veteran forward to the NBA after a brief stint in China.

Martin's agent, Andy Miller, confirmed Friday that the sides reached agreement. The deal, believed to be worth the mini mid-level exception of $2.5 million, is expected to be finalized as soon as Martin passes a physical.

Martin spent part of the season playing for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in China and was required to wait until their season ended before rejoining the NBA. However, he was cleared to return Thursday by FIBA, basketball's international governing body.

The 34-year-old Martin averaged 8.6 points and 6.2 rebounds last season in Denver. The deal reunites him with former Nuggets teammate Chauncey Billups, now a guard with the Clippers. Martin also has a home in Los Angeles.

Martin has averaged 13.5 points and 7.2 rebounds in 11 NBA seasons, including a stint with New Jersey.
