11 years ago, Kenyon Martin Sr. was briefly a member of the LA Clippers. Fast forward to today, and now his 22 year old son will be a member of the same team his father was. Needless to say, Kenyon Martin is excited about the opportunity.

Kenyon Martin Sr. was a guest on Podcast P with Paul George where he opened up about his son playing for the LA Clippers.

“Oh absolutely [I’m excited KJ is playing for the Clippers]," Martin Sr. said. I’ve made LA home for the last eight years now, so yeah. Now I get to see him and I ain't got to pay for plane tickets, save some money. I just – he’s a winner in his heart. He despises losing, so for him to be able to play on a team that’s fighting for something. These dudes are fighting for legacy, fighting for [a] championship so they play different[ly]. And that’s the way he approaches the game night in and night out. The guys that he play against know that. So for him to be in that environment and with an organization that know him and appreciate him, man, I’m ecstatic.”

It's hard to believe it's been 11 years since Martin Sr. was a member of Lob City, but time has flown by quickly. It's even harder to believe that the team is about to enter year five of having both Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The Clippers have yet to win an NBA Championship throughout all the success, but they've managed to reach their first Conference Finals ever. Unfortunately for LA, they just have't had a chance to be healthy in the playoffs, which has ultimately been the main reason for their lack of championships.
