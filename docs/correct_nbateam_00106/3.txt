According to Espn.com, The Los Angeles Clippers have agreed to a deal with free-agent forward Kenyon Martin.

The former Denver forward, who reached a buyout agreement with the Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers on Dec. 21 and was cleared by FIBA earlier this week to return to the NBA two weeks ahead of schedule, will make the Clippers’ mini-mid-level exception of $2.5 million. It will not be pro-rated as that doesn’t apply to exceptions until Feb. 10.

Martin’s agent, Andy Miller, confirmed Friday that the sides reached agreement.

The Clippers are confident that FIBA’s early clearance of Martin will hold up, according to a team source, despite some the pushback from Chinese basketball officials reported by Yahoo! Sports. However, even if his return is delayed, it would only be until mid-February.

Martin, 34, also considered the Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks.
