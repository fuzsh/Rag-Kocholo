        "text": "At an early age, KJ Martin stood on the sidelines at NBA practices and in locker rooms afterward, absorbing every detail and the atmosphere.\n\nAs he grew and his game matured, KJ joined the pick-up games at Rico Hines’ runs, playing alongside NBA All-Stars, pro prospects and others at Pauley Pavilion.\n\nAt Sierra Canyon High in Chatsworth and IMG Academy in Florida, he played against future NBA players, putting the finishing touches on a career that seemed destined since birth, given his genetics.\n\nKJ is the son of former NBA player Kenyon Martin, sharing many of the traits that helped his father carve out a successful 15-year career (12.3 ppg, 6.8 rpg). Besides the facial resemblance, they both possess the ability to attack the rim and the skills to back down an opponent in the paint.\n\nAnd now they share something else – an opportunity to play for the Clippers.\n\nKenyon Martin Sr. was traded to the Clippers in 2011, where he averaged 5.2 points and 4.3 rebounds in one season in L.A.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Houston Rockets, where he was a second-round pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, KJ was traded to the Clippers in July, adding a young rotation player to a veteran-heavy roster. He brings energy to the court, something he hopes to show the Clippers.\n\n“That’s my biggest thing – just keeping the pace of the game up,” KJ said via phone from the Clippers’ training camp in Hawai’i. “And, obviously helping Kawhi (Leonard) PG (Paul George) and Russ (Westbrook) get open.”\n\nKJ, a 6-foot-6, 215-pound power forward, also sees himself using his athleticism to score and his ability to defend multiple positions as more ways that could help the Clippers. Last season, he averaged 12.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.4 assists while shooting 57% from the field. He also has 173 career dunks and is a career 34.3% shooter from 3-point range.\n\nHe attributes his skills not only to playing against older, more experienced players growing up, but hanging around NBA spaces where he saw how players prepared for games and how hard they worked year in and year out to get better.\n\n“Those players helped me so much in my development process,” said KJ, 22. “Obviously they were bigger and stronger than me, so to be able to go out there and compete helped me grow. I also asked questions. That was the biggest thing, just asking questions and figuring out how to apply them to my game.”\n\nClippers coach Tyronn Lue’s eyes light up when he talks about KJ’s experience and versatility.\n\n“I see him as a basketball player at the three, four, five, wherever we can use him,” Lue said. “Just his athleticism, being able to switch, being able to guard different positions, being able to roll to the basket, run the floor.\n\n“He’s a really good passer, he can push the ball in transition and make plays. We just want to get him on the floor just being a basketball player.”\n\nLue had a bit of a flashback when KJ showed up. He and Kenyon were – and still are – good friends, having come into the league around the same time.\n\n“K1 has been my guy, he’s been my guy for a long time,” Lue said.\n\nKenyon Martin was a fixture at Rockets games the past three seasons and showed up in Hawai’i for the final few days of training camp last week. Lue, however, won’t mind if Martin Sr. hangs around Crypto.com Arena because of “his passion about the game. He was passionate when he played.”\n\nKJ said he is excited to be back in Los Angeles, where he grew up. He already has reconnected with friends and reacquainted himself with the city.\n\n“Obviously, my family is here. My dad lives in L.A. also, so for them, they’re able to come to the majority of the games,” KJ said. “When I was in Houston, my dad would travel and stuff like that, but it’ll be easier. He will be able to go to games and go right back home. That’s what I’m super excited about.”\n\nWith his father being near, KJ expects the life – and basketball – lessons to continue. Kenyon Martin handed out plenty of advice as he watched his son follow in his footsteps.\n\n“He told me to just be a professional,” KJ said. “The basketball thing he said was the easy part. It’s the other stuff about being professional or being on time and being respectful whether it’s coaches, media or trainers. And even the other teams and their trainers, security, whatever it may be.\n\n“He’s always been an example of this.”\n\nCLIPPERS VS. JAZZ\n\nWhen: Tuesday, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Climate Pledge Arena, Seattle"
