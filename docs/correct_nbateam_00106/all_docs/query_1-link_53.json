        "text": "Damian Lillard and James Harden, two guards with a combined 17 All-Star appearances, could still be on the move this summer as the NBA offseason rolls into July. Here's what to know:\n\nLillard has asked the Trail Blazers to trade him — specifically to the Heat, league sources told The Athletic. The seven-time All-Star, who turns 33 on July 15, has spent his entire 11-year pro career in Portland.\n\nHarden opted into his $35.6 million deal for next season to allow the 76ers and the 10-time All-Star to work together on finding a trade out of Philadelphia, league sources said. The Athletic reported last week Harden, a Los Angeles native, would like to play for the Clippers.\n\nMany of the NBA's top free agents agreed to deals in the opening hours of the negotiating period last Friday. Kyrie Irving agreed to re-sign with the Mavericks, Draymond Green will re-up with the Warriors and Fred VanVleet is jumping to the Rockets.\n\nMeanwhile, four 2020 draft picks — Minnesota's Anthony Edwards, Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton, Charlotte's LaMelo Ball and Memphis' Desmond Band — struck five-year maximum rookie extensions that could be worth up to a projected $260 million.\n\nFurther reading\n\nWhy Damian Lillard finally asked out and sparked an all out blitz around the NBA to cut the Heat in line\n\nIf you thought player empowerment was on the wane, grab a chair; Dame Time is on the clock\n\nHollinger: Suns lead the way as early NBA free-agency winners\n\nSign up for The Bounce, the free daily NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and Shams Charania\n\nFind the best ticket deals on StubHub to see your favorite team.\n\nJosh Christopher going to Memphis makes it likely that Dillon Brooks's move is a sign-and-trade. That would generate an $11.4 million trade exception for the Grizzlies if no players come back, however Christopher would cut into that by $2.4 million ... unless there is also a small salary coming back to the Rockets. Also, Memphis now has 16 players under contract; it's possible Christopher will just be waived as the odd man out, but Christopher's family also goes waaaaay back with Grizzlies executive Tayshaun Prince. Don't be surprised if he ends up staying and another player is moved out.\n\nHouston still has some questions as we parse through the recent volley of moves today. Based on the reported deals for Jock Landale and Dillon Brooks, the Rockets don't have enough cap room at the moment to acquire Patty Mills in a trade. Remember, Landale can't be signed with the $7.7 million room exception if he's on a four-year deal, so he'd have to be signed into room.\n\nMills could be acquired by making the previous trade with Atlanta a three-way deal and including Josh Christopher or Kenyon Martin. Jr; or the Rockets could stuff a small contract or two into a sign-and-trade with Memphis for Dillon Brooks.\n\nIt took $80 million to get there, but the Rockets have been able to land their top wing target in Dillon Brooks and their top point guard target in Fred Van Vleet during the first two days of free agency.\n\nBrooks certainly comes with his fair share of antics and his outside shooting numbers leave a lot to be desired, but we're still talking about a versatile, 27-year-old wing that finished second team All-Defense. Ime Udoka can certainly get behind that.\n\n(Photo: Petre Thomas / USA Today)\n\nWho might the midlevel exception addition be? Is Donte DiVincenzo a lock? If the Knicks miss out on him, what’s the contingency plan? Could it be former Phoenix Suns wing Torrey Craig or might former L.A. Clippers guard Eric Gordon add a valuable enough veteran presence? There are still reliable free agents left out there for the right price, even if the market is shriveling up 24 hours after it opened.\n\nIf they use the midlevel exception on a guard, another move could come, too. If the Knicks were to enter the season with a guard replacing Toppin along with eight returning rotation players, their backup power forward would be some mix of Hart and RJ Barrett. Either of those two can fill in at the four, but their traits that are overpowering against smalls (such as Hart’s rebounding or Barrett’s strength) become more muted when they’re consistently facing power forwards.\n\nBut there is still plenty of time for the Knicks to complete their roster.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks have re-signed Dwight Powell, as first reported by ESPN and confirmed by a team source, to a three-year deal that will allow the team's longest-tenured player to remain in Dallas. The team did contemplate pursuing players that could replace Powell, two team sources say, but ultimately the front office was very comfortable re-signing the 31-year-old center as a veteran presence whose role should diminish in the coming years as the team hopes its lottery pick, Dereck Lively II, develops into a long-term starter.\n\nAlthough not yet confirmed, it seems likeliest that Powell’s deal will be signed using his Bird rights, which still gives Dallas the option to use its non-taxpayer mid-level exception if another trade — probably involving Tim Hardaway Jr. — is made that clears a few million more in cap room.\n\n(Photo: Megan Briggs / Getty Images)\n\nLeague source says Cavs will send the minimum consideration of $110,000 to Utah for reserve center Damian Jones, who will go into a minimum cap exception. Utah still has $14 million in cap room and an open roster spot after depositing Damian Jones onto Cleveland's cap sheet, so keep an eye out for the Jazz. The Jazz, Rockets and Spurs are the only teams left who could still sign a free agent for more than the full midlevel exception, although we are rapidly running out of players worth playing that much. As for Cleveland, the Cavs needed a third center on a cheap deal and now have one.\n\nOn its own, losing Fred VanVleet for no return except the flexibility to pay Dennis Schröder is not a disaster. We don’t know precisely what the Raptors could have got for VanVleet at the trade deadline, and while any amount of future equity would have been preferable, that value would have been lessened if they had to also take on undesirable contracts to make a trade work. (Jake Fischer of Yahoo reported Phoenix and the Clippers as VanVleet suitors, but that would have probably meant taking back Marcus Morris or Landry Shamet or some other player they’d rather not have.)\n\nHowever, the overvaluing of their own players made the Raptors committed to a plan to stay in win-now mode, even if maintaining optionality would have been ideal. It also means they might have missed their best opportunities to trade some of their best players, who may or may not intend to stay in Toronto long term.\n\nThe lesson: Surrender leverage and control at your own peril. If nothing major changes with their roster or their best players’ contractual status within the next year, the Raptors will walk into free agency with three of their top six players hitting the market: Gary Trent Jr., O.G. Anunoby and Pascal Siakam. Scottie Barnes will also become eligible for a rookie extension.\n\nLet’s get specific, shall we?\n\nDenver was the first place where Bruce Brown felt at home, both on the court and in the locker room. After a lukewarm experience with the Brooklyn Nets, the Nuggets embraced him. They allowed Brown to play on the perimeter, and they allowed him to be himself. Their belief in him went a long way toward helping them to win a championship, so even as a one-year thing, it goes in the books as a home-run, free-agency signing.\n\nAt the end of the day, according to league sources, Brown couldn’t turn down $20-plus million a season. He’s never made close to that kind of money in a single season. And, with the players the Pacers have returning, the playoffs aren’t out of the realm of possibility for them, especially with Brown’s ability to fill in the blanks the Pacers roster is missing.\n\nNow the Nuggets need to replace a key piece to what made them work last season at such a high level, and they have to do it essentially with veteran minimums.\n\nA brutal but perhaps necessary piece of business for Houston, giving up two seconds and cash just to salary dump two recent first-round draft picks and create a mere $5 million in extra cap space. Let's see what that extra room yields them before we judge, because it may give them just enough cap room to add Dillon Brooks and a quality big man, but the optics on this one ... woof.\n\nAs for Atlanta, they unbelievably will end up getting to use the tiny exception from the Moe Harkless trade to swallow Garuba's contract, and a part of the Justin Holliday trade in February with these same Rockets to take in Washington's. The expected $25 million exception from John Collins was not needed for this deal. The Hawks are now $10 million from the tax line with one roster spot open, presuming the non-guaranteed deals of Vit Krejci, Tyrese Martin and Bruno Fernando are not retained, and get a free look at two young players who may spend more time in College Park this year than they do with the Hawks.\n\nThe Wolves reached agreements with Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Shake Milton and Troy Brown Jr. in the hours after the market opened on Friday evening, league sources told The Athletic. Alexander-Walker got a two-year deal worth $9 million, Milton got two years and $10 million and Brown got two years and $8 million, according to those sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been signed. The deals for Milton and Brown have team options in the second season.\n\nMinnesota started the day with about $15 million in spending power after letting Prince walk and guaranteeing the contract of Jordan McLaughlin, the point guard who struggled last season with injuries and inconsistency. Before they decided to divvy up their cash between three solid, if not well-known, bench players, the Wolves did make overtures to several more well-known free agents, team sources said.\n\nTheir dream catch was Bruce Brown, the rugged guard who played such a big role in Denver’s title run. But they became aware early in the market that Brown had visions of going elsewhere, so they quickly moved on. There were conversations with Joe Ingles, who was a teammate of Conley and Gobert in Utah. But the Orlando Magic blew everyone else out of the water with a two-year, $22 million offer.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo was a target as well, but it was assumed he’d be commanding more money than the Wolves could spend. Eric Gordon was given some consideration, team sources said, but the Wolves wanted to maximize their spending power. Adding the three players they did at those numbers allows them to maintain financial flexibility going forward, an essential element for a team that expects to be living in the luxury tax after next season."
