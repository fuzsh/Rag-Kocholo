        "text": "The Clippers’ stars are healthy, the point guard is back, a talented young player has joined the team, as well as a first-round draft pick, and championship aspirations are in hand with training camp set to begin Tuesday in Hawaii.\n\nEvery team comes into the NBA season eyeing the NBA title and the Clippers are no different. For the past four seasons, with the tandem of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George at the helm, the Clippers have appeared to be a championship-caliber team.\n\nTo assure themselves of a long postseason run, the team’s focus in recent seasons had been on keeping their stars healthy for the playoffs. But that hasn’t happened as injuries to both George and Leonard have cut their past three seasons short, dashing any championship dreams. Last year, they had to battle to avoid dropping into the play-in tournament.\n\nThis season, the Clippers are switching it up, putting the focus on winning more regular-season games instead of saving the best for last.\n\n“We need to compete harder every single night,” said Lawrence Frank, Clippers’ president of basketball operations. “We owe it to ourselves. We owe it to the fans. We want to be a championship organization and we have to invest deeper into the process.\n\n“I mean, the last 28 years, the NBA champion has been a top-three seed, so you have to earn it. The regular season matters.”\n\nThat means from Oct. 25 to mid-April, the Clippers will look to compete every night and take a boxing gloves rather than kid gloves approach in dealing with their stars. George and Leonard played only 38 games together last season and that won’t work this season – barring injuries.\n\n“Not that our guys don’t think it (regular season) matters, but I just think we, all of us and starting with me, we can compete harder every day,” Frank said. “We can hold each other accountable every day. And that’s just what we have to do.\n\n“As a team, in terms of our goals, we can compete harder in everything we do. We know we can.”\n\nTo reach their goals, the Clippers not only will be looking to their duo stars, but other starters, such as Ivica Zubac and Rusell Westbrook.\n\nWestbrook decided to stay with the Clippers, agreeing to a two-year, $8 million deal – the non-Bird exception – a dramatic decrease from the five-year, $206 million he had in pocket before being traded (Lakers) and waived (Utah) at midseason.\n\nAnd the Clippers are more than happy to have the mercurial playmaker back after he averaged 15.8 points, 4.9 rebounds and 7.6 assists on 48.9% shooting in 30.2 minutes per game for the Clippers.\n\nThe Clippers for the most part remained intact. The lone major move they made was acquiring Kenyon Martin Jr., a talented young rotation player. He averaged 12.7 points and 5.5 rebounds on 57% shooting last season with the Houston Rockets.\n\nRookie Kobe Brown, a 6-foot-8 guard, is expected to see action this season.\n\nHere are five questions entering training camp this week.\n\nHow does having Westbrook back make the team better?\n\nThe Clippers will have Westbrook for an entire season, giving them a chance to see how completely he fits into the offense. He showed in 21 games last season that he could be efficient in scoring without having to be the focal point – until he had to be during their first-round playoff series against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nWhen George (knee sprain) and Leonard (torn meniscus) both got hurt, Westbrook was thrust into the spotlight and looked like the Westbrook of old, driving and passing and scoring 30 or more points in consecutive playoff games. Although it didn’t keep the Suns from winning the series, it showed that the Clippers have a capable option in case of injury.\n\nHe gives the team a full-time legitimate playmaking guard, something they have coveted since Chris Paul departed.\n\nHow will the new NBA rules regarding resting affect the Clippers?\n\nWhen the NBA announced its new rules regarding star players sitting out games to rest, the internet was littered with pictures of the Clippers’ super duo on the bench. Unfair, maybe. But George and Leonard were in and out of the lineup throughout the season because of illness, injuries and simply nights off.\n\nFor instance, when Leonard returned from a knee injury, his minutes were restricted and he even sat out the second half against the Memphis Grizzlies in the first game of a back-to-back, which would allow him to play the entire game the next night. Both he and George faced limited minutes throughout the season.\n\nWith the new rules in play, players could face punishment for sitting out games, including national TV games and in-season tournament games, as well as if one or more All-Stars sit out regular-season games on the same night.\n\nLast season, George and Leonard played just 38 games together and the league will be watching the Clippers perhaps more closely than other teams. Frank said the Clippers shouldn’t be scrutinized any more than other teams.\n\n“When our guys are healthy, they play. And that’s the bottom line,” Frank said. “There’s a difference between being injured and ‘load management.’ When they’re healthy, they play. When they’re unhealthy, then they don’t.”\n\nWill PG and Kawhi be ready to go when the season begins?\n\nThis leads us to the question of the health of George and Leonard. Frank said both players are coming into training camp healthy.\n\nGeorge has recovered from the sprained knee that sidelined him late last season, and Leonard is ready to go after having surgery to clean up a torn right meniscus he suffered in the playoffs.\n\n“Both are fully healthy,” Frank said last week. “I think both have had extremely productive offseasons, and obviously our two best players are totally invested in doing special things for the Clippers. They show it with their actions, so I think we’re really excited that they’re both fully healthy and will be full participants in camp.”\n\nFrank said all 21 roster players are healthy entering training camp.\n\nHow long will Tyronn Lue continue to coach the Clippers?\n\nFor a long time, if you listen to Frank.\n\nLue has two years remaining on a five-year contract he signed in 2022 and the fact the Clippers have reached the Western Conference finals just once in his three seasons has more to do with injuries than Lue’s ability to coach.\n\nIn his first season, Lue led the Clippers to the conference finals (despite losing Kawhi Leonard to a season-ending injury halfway through their second-round series). It was the first conference finals appearance in franchise history, and they finished the regular season with a record of 47-25. The following three seasons were lackluster as injuries derailed any hopes of repeating his initial season. Lue’s overall record with the Clippers is 133-103.\n\n“We love TLue, we want T-Lue to be the coach here for a long time,” Frank said. “He’s one of the elite coaches in this league and there’s always a timing for things like that (contract extension discussions).\n\nIs James Harden coming or not?\n\nTraining camp begins Tuesday and as of now, James Harden is still (technically) wearing a Philadelphia 76ers jersey. The Clippers had engaged in preliminary talks about trading for the former league MVP, but after several attempts, talks stalled, and nothing happened.\n\nThe 76ers were asking a lot in exchange for Harden and the Clippers reportedly weren’t willing to offer up Terance Mann or more than one first-round pick.\n\nTalk regarding Harden to the Clippers resurfaced last week when Jrue Holiday was sent to the Portland Trail Blazers as part of the Damian Lillard trade and a three-team deal was being talked about that would have sent Harden to the Clippers, Holiday to Philadelphia and a first-round pick from each team to Portland.\n\nBut Holiday was traded to the Boston Celtics on Sunday, leaving Harden still part of the 76ers."
