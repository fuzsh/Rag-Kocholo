        "text": "James Harden finally received his ticket out of Philadelphia.\n\nThe 76ers agreed to trade the 10-time All-Star along with P.J. Tucker and Filip Petrusev to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marcus Morris Sr., Nicolas Batum, Robert Covington, Kenyon Martin Jr., a 2028 unprotected first-round pick, two second-round picks in 2024 and 2029, and a pick swap in 2029, both teams announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder are also a part of the trade, sending a protected 2026 first-round pick to the Sixers in exchange for a 2027 first-round pick swap with the Clippers, the Thunder announced.\n\nThe 76ers waived guard Danny Green to clear a roster spot.\n\nHere's what the math on the proposed trade looks like, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks:\n\nAll four incoming players are on expiring deals, clearing the way for the Sixers to have $50 million to $65 million in salary-cap space next offseason.\n\nHarden is \"ecstatic\" to be joining the Clippers and could be present for Tuesday's game against the Orlando Magic, sources told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.\n\nThe blockbuster move to L.A. marks the culmination of a messy falling-out between the former MVP and the Sixers front office. Harden demanded a trade after exercising his $35.6-million player option in the summer.\n\nHarden subsequently called team president Daryl Morey \"a liar\" while vowing to never play for the organization again. Harden was fined $100,000 for his comments. He also missed the end of training camp and preseason as part of a 10-day absence due to personal reasons and is yet to play this regular season.\n\nIn the end, Harden appeared in 79 regular-season outings for the Sixers across two seasons and change following his trade from Brooklyn in February 2022, which sent Ben Simmons the other way.\n\nHarden, 34, joins a veteran-laden Clippers roster anchored by Southern California products Kawhi Leonard and Paul George that lost to the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs last season. He will also team up with former backcourt mate Russell Westbrook for the third time after stints with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets.\n\nMeanwhile, of the players headed Philly's way, Covington leads the pack in average minutes (23), points (three), and rebounds (2.7) through three games. He played for the Sixers from 2014 to 2018, establishing himself as a fan favourite for his hustle on the defensive end - culminating in an All-Defensive first-team selection in his final campaign with the franchise.\n\nMorris has yet to appear in a game this season, falling out of the Clippers' rotation prior to the trade. Last year, the veteran forward started 65 games and averaged 11.2 points, four rebounds, and 1.8 assists in 28 minutes.\n\nBatum revived his career in L.A., averaging 7.3 points over 207 career games with the franchise. The 34-year-old is off to a slower start this campaign, averaging 2.7 points, 2.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 1.3 blocks and a steal in 18 minutes per game.\n\nThe Clippers are Harden's fifth team in his 15-year career, following spells with the Thunder, Rockets, Nets, and Sixers. He led the league in assists (10.7) last season and was Philly's second-leading scorer, averaging 21 points per game.\n\nHarden's departure represents another major change for the Sixers. Shake Milton, Georges Niang, and Jalen McDaniels all left during the offseason, while Green, Patrick Beverley, Mo Bamba, and Kelly Oubre Jr. were brought in prior to the Clippers trade to bolster new head coach Nick Nurse's squad.\n\nPhiladelphia and L.A. are both off to 2-1 starts this season."
