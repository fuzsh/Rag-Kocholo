        "text": "HONOLULU â When the Los Angeles Clippers flew over for preseason training camp in Hawaii in 2019, they packed along the most hype and expectation the franchise had ever experienced. Superstars Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, both in their prime, had just signed long-term deals and forged expectations that Southern Californiaâs other basketball team could finally break through for its first championship.\n\nBut George, coming off of shoulder surgery, and Leonard, fresh off of leading the Toronto Raptors to a title, both sat out of the Clippersâ two preseason games in Honolulu. It turned out to be a harbinger of the next four seasons â the stars were rarely aligned.\n\nThe 2023 playoffs were case in point. The Clippers pieced together regular-season wins with patchwork lineups, earned 44 wins and the Westâs fifth seed, and were bounced in the first round by the Phoenix Suns. Leonard tore a meniscus early in the series and George was not quite ready to return from a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Clippers are as whole as they've been entering 2023 training camp in Hawaii, their first here in four years. And based on the structure of the veterans' contracts, it could be the last title run together for the core of George, 33, Leonard, 32, and point guard Russell Westbrook, 34, who proved himself as a castoff from the Lakers last season. Next year, the Clippers are poised to move into their new $2 billion Intuit Dome in Inglewood and those three have player options to return.\n\nâHealthyâ was the word of the day as coach Tyronn Lue and three members of the Clippers supporting cast â Terance Mann, Bones Hyland and Norman Powell â spoke to the media as the team warmed up for its first practice at the Stan Sheriff Center. Leonard, George, Westbrook and other veterans appeared in high spirits on the arena floor.\n\nLue said he hasnât paid mind to the Clippersâ dearth of title chatter compared to preseasons past or an under-the-radar status in a crowded Western Conference.\n\nâI donât care about that. I know we have a good team. I know when weâre healthy weâre at the top of the league,â Lue said. âAnd so nothing really matters to me where weâre at at the beginning of the season. I care about where weâre at at the end of the season.â\n\nBillionaire Steve Ballmerâs franchise reached its first Western Conference Finals in Lueâs first season of 2020-21, but didnât make the playoffs the following year. The George-Leonard Clippers have not achieved a 50-win regular season.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Mann, who since his rookie NBA training camp here in 2019 has emerged as one of the more reliable bodies in the lineup, having played 81 of 82 games in the last two regular seasons, was asked if his outlook for the team had changed since the last time he was in Hawaii.\n\nâDifferent roster, so a little bit different outlook, but we want the same outcome, and thatâs to win a championship,â Mann said. âSo Iâll say the mentalityâs still the same â weâre here to work and weâre here to strive to do that.â\n\nThe Clippers plan to lean on their positional flexibility on the wings for success this year, starting with Sundayâs preseason opener against the Utah Jazz at the SSC. Clippers officials hope for a sellout in the 10,300-seat arena, which would match the Clippersâ two previous preseason games in Hawaii against NBA competition.\n\nProceeds of ticket sales for this yearâs game will go toward benefiting Maui wildfire recovery efforts. The Clippers also have something in that vein planned for Thursday; Lue was coy when pressed for details.\n\nâItâs going to be a great benefit,â said Lue, 46, who is making his first Hawaii camp in his fourth year with the Clippers. âOur guys are excited â¦ to help in any way we can.â\n\nLue said his objective for the camp in Hawaii was to âjust establish who we are. Establish our identity throughout the season, on both sides of the basketball. How we want to play. Thatâs our biggest thing coming out of camp this week.â\n\nThe Clippers were rated 17th defensively in the 30-team NBA last year. That middling ranking stuck with Lue all offseason. He noted that when Leonard and George both play, the Clippers are a top-four team offensively, and should be similarly accomplished at the other end of the floor.\n\nThe coach declined to name a starting five for Sunday. Itâs not yet known if the Clippersâ stars will play or if the minutes will be distributed to roster hopefuls.\n\nThe Clippers brought the full offseason complement of 21 players to camp, including veterans Nicolas Batum, Marcus Morris Sr., Ivica Zubac and Mason Plumlee, trade acquisition Kenyon Martin Jr., and 2023 draft picks Kobe Brown (Missouri) and Jordan Miller (Miami). The roster must be trimmed to 15 by the start of the regular season Oct. 25.\n\nAsked of his memories of playing in the islands, Lue recalled one of the two in-season tournaments he played here in his Nebraska career: the 1995 Big Island Invitational, won by the Cornhuskers when he was a freshman.\n\nLue made the 1997 Rainbow Classic all-tournament team, despite losing to Hawaii by 25 in the semifinals, though he didnât recall playing in the Stan Sheriff Center. UH, led by Anthony Carter and Alika Smith, went on to beat No. 2 Kansas in the Rainbow championship that year.\n\nThe Jazz arrived for their training camp in Hawaii on Tuesday and will practice at BYU-Hawaii. The Clippers and Jazz rematch on the mainland on Tuesday.\n\nCorrection: The Utah Jazz are holding training camp at BYU-Hawaii on Oahu's North Shore in advance of Sunday's game, but are not practicing at the Stan Sheriff Center."
