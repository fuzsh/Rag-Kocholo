        "text": "The LA Clippers are acquiring Houston Rockets forward K.J. Martin in a trade for two future second-round draft picks, sources told ESPN on Saturday.\n\nThe Clippers have been in the market to start adding young rotation players to a veteran roster, and Martin has been rapidly developing into a starting-level forward in the league. He averaged 12.7 points and 5.5 rebounds on 57% shooting last season, including better than 80% from within 3 feet of the rim.\n\nHe also had 173 dunks and is a career 34% 3-point shooter.\n\nMartin, the 52nd overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft out of IMG Academy, played 82 games a year ago -- including 49 starts.\n\nHis father, Kenyon, played for the Clippers and under president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank during his coaching days with the New Jersey Nets ."
