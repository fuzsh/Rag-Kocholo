        "text": "Many people may have forgotten by now, but Kenyon Martin Sr. spent one season with the LA Clippers in 2012. Clipper fans remember his tenure because he was a part of the epic 27 point comeback against the Memphis Grizzlies in the palyoffs. What fans don't know, is that he actually was close to joining Miami instead.\n\nIn the newest episode of Podcast P with Paul George, Kenyon Martin Sr. revealed his worst memory with the LA Clippers in 2012. While it wasn't exactly a specific memory, it was the fact that he missed out on a championship with the Miami Heat.\n\n“Well, people are going to be mad at me, please don’t hate me for this,\" Martin said. \"I went because Chauncey [Billups] was on the team at the time. It’s when I had just came from China – three months I was over there…Chauncey was like we’ve got a chance...come and big shot got hurt. Like my first game, I’m about to suit up, Chauncey tore his achilles. Distraught, right? I could’ve went to Miami and had a championship that year. But KJ and them was raised in LA so it was a family thing, get to see them, all that.”\n\nThe 2012 Clippers were a very deep squad, but both Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan definitely had vastly underdeveloped games at the time. They were ultimately swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round, and the Miami Heat became the eventual champions that season. Martin never had a better opportunity to win a championship again that season, so it makes sense why it could be both a bright and a sore spot for him.\n\nKevin Durant Gets Honest About Russell Westbrook's Impact\n\nPaul George Reveals Conversation With Kawhi Leonard After Devastating Injury"
