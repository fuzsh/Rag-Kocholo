        "text": "HONOLULU â The Los Angeles Clippers have a veteran roster with a lot still to prove in little time left to do it. The youthful Utah Jazz have a broad array of future assets and no real pressure to deliver now.\n\nThe Clippers soaked up the Waikiki sun and dealt with shoulder-to-shoulder semicircle scrums of media during training camp this week in advance of the 2023-24 NBA season. The Jazz were tucked out of view on the North Shore with a minimal media presence in tow.\n\nTwo Western Conference teams with a contrast in approaches and present circumstances will take to the same Stan Sheriff Center court at 3 p.m. Sunday in their mutual preseason opener. The gameâs net proceeds will benefit Maui wildfire relief efforts.\n\nâJust put on a show,â said Clippers forward Kenyon Martin Jr., an offseason acquisition who was last in Hawaii for the 2018 Iolani Prep Classic, of what the players hoped to show for local basketball fans. âI mean, obviously we donât get a lot of NBA basketball out here. They watch it on TV. So just coming out and putting it on for Hawaii.â\n\nIt is close to a sellout. As of Saturday night, there were only scattered single seats available in the upper level of the 10,300-seat stadium.\n\nFor the Clippers, it is their fourth camp in Hawaii since 2017, but the first since 2019 â the prelude to the NBA season that ended up in the Orlando bubble due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Jazz were last here in 2015 to play the Los Angeles Lakers in two games for Kobe Bryantâs farewell preseason.\n\nThe Clippers have considerable star power with Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and Russell Westbrook, and they are healthy â something that hasnât often been said in the four-year tenure of the first two. Those three were here in 2019, when Leonard and George were the Clippersâ prized pickups and Westbrook was on the Houston Rockets, and all sat for various reasons, to the disappointment of attendees. Among stars in the building, only then-Houston guard James Harden played.\n\nClippers coach Tyronn Lue said before Saturdayâs practice that all his players are available to play in Sundayâs exhibition. But will they?\n\nâYes. Unless I make a call,â Lue said.\n\nThe Jazz have big man Lauri Markkanen, one of last seasonâs breakout stars, and a host of capable scoring guards like Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton. Coach Will Hardy has been attempting to hammer out a backcourt rotation at BYU-Hawaii.\n\nLue plans to treat the entire four-game preseason, through Oct. 24, as an extended training camp to get his entire team on the same page, including last year's mid-season additions like Westbrook, center Mason Plumlee and guard Bones Hyland. The Clippers are trying to lean into their positional versatility to outrun teams this year.\n\nLeonard and George, whom the Clippers owe $45 million each this season, have player options in their contracts for next season but otherwise are question marks beyond 2023-24. Both Los Angeles natives said in practices at the University of Hawaii this week they have a strong relationship with the Clippers front office, with George volunteering that he wanted to end his career with the franchise.\n\nThe low-key Leonard, expressive Westbrook and easygoing George all appeared to be in good spirits throughout warmup sessions before camp practices this week, wearing smiles as they joked with each other off to the sides.\n\nâItâs been going well. Starting off with the basics, trying to build our foundation, and the islandâs been great,â Leonard said. âAmazing weather. You canât ask for a better scene.â\n\nThe teams depart Hawaii later Sunday to prepare for a second preseason game against each other at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle on Tuesday.\n\nFans are encouraged to get to the arena early and allow extra time for NBA security measures for admittance."
