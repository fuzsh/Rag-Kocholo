Sports.\n\nMartin will make the veteran's minimum of $1.4 million.\n\nMartin, 35, made a strong impression on the Knicks' front office and coaching staffs to earn his return to New York.\n\nAfter signing with the Knicks late last season, Martin played an integral role in the frontcourt in the final month of the regular season and playoffs. He averaged 7.2 points and 5.3 rebounds in nearly 24 minutes in the regular season, including 11 starts.\n\nMartin played 12 playoff games for the Knicks and averaged nearly six points in 21 minutes.\n\nIn 13 NBA seasons with the Brooklyn Nets, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers and Knicks, Martin has career averages of 12.8 points and 5.3 rebounds. He was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft out of the University of Cincinnati."
