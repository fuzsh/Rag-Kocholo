        "text": "Kenyon Martin on facing tedious customs procedures when traveling to and from Toronto: ‘Terrible. You can’t even bring your toiletry bag back through the airport after the game cuz we got to go through the airport after the game to go through security. You can’t even bring your f*cking toiletry bag in like you a f*cking civilian.\n\nKenyon Martin: There was a rumor, a dude played for the Nets, went knowing he had his situation, they landed back and they had folks waiting on him like ‘come on over here’. Plane pull up, hey don’t nobody get off the plane.. we’ve been looking for you… but we know who all had issues and you know some people might take longer than others. If it’s a pending charge, yeah the bus going to leave you, they got to figure this out. If it’s something that you’ve been already convicted or you already got to they could take you back there probably… Smart teams, Smart security dudes, they pull you first right because they know it’s going to take a little longer, so when everybody get it done then you’re done.\n\nKJ Martin: I’m tired of seeing yall say that my dad forced me out of playing in Houston. He had nothing to do with it he has his own opinion to say what he wants like everyone else does. It was strictly NBA business on why i got traded noting more nothing less!"
