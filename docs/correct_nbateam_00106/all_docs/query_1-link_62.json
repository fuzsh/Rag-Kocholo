        "text": "Kenyon Martin played college basketball for the Cincinnati Bearcats. His senior season he averaged 18.9 points per game, 9.7 rebounds per game, and 3.5 blocks per game. Cincinnati has retired his number \"4\" jersey. He was the top pick of the 2000 NBA Draft, drafted by the New Jersey Nets. In his second season the Nets won the Eastern Conference title and faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the finals. They lost in four games. In Martin's third season the Nets advanced to the finals again facing the San Antonio Spurs. This time they lost in six games. In his fourth year Martin played in his first NBA All-Star game. At the end of the 2003-04 season Martin was traded to the Denver Nuggets for three future first-round draft picks in a sign-and-trade deal. At the end of the 2004-05 season a problem was noticed in Martin's left knee. He then had microfracture surgery on the knee. Kenyon missed 26 games during the 2005-06 season due to knee tendinitis. The Nuggets made the playoffs. During a playoff series with the Los Angeles Clippers Martin was suspended indefinitely for arguing about playing time with his coach. During the 2006-07 regular season swelling occurred in Martin's right knee, and that knee too required microfracture surgery. Martin has had several off-the-court issues including yelling at heckling fans and getting into a profanity-laced argument with a radio personality. For the 2007-08 season Martin changed his uniform number from \"6\" to \"4,\" his college number, to symbolize a new start for him."
