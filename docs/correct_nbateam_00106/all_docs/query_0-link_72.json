        "text": "The Clippers filled a glaring need in the frontcourt Friday by agreeing to a contract with veteran free agent power forward Kenyon Martin.\n\nThe one-year deal, believed to be worth the mini mid-level exception of $2.5 million, is pending Martin passing a physical.\n\nMartin had been playing with the Xinjiang Tigers in China but was allowed out of a season-long contract with the club when FIBA, which oversees international basketball, stepped in on his behalf.\n\nIn doing so, the 6-9 forward was free to sign with any team in the NBA, and the Clippers, who need help behind center DeAndre Jordan and power forward Blake Griffin, immediately showed interest.\n\nMartin has career averages of 13.5 points and 7.2 rebounds over 11 seasons with the New Jersey Nets and Denver Nuggets. He averaged just over 8 points and 6 rebounds last year with the Nuggets.\n\nMartin chose the Clippers over the Lakers, Miami Heat and Atlanta Hawks. Many speculate that Martin’s relationship with Clippers guard and former Nuggets teammate Chauncey Billups helped sway him to Los Angeles."
