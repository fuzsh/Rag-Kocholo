        "text": "Put a bow on the Chris Paul-era in Los Angeles. In fact, let’s just put a bow on the Clippers in general. Doc Rivers isn’t saving this shit…and neither is Austin Rivers — although he does get a bad rap.\n\nBut, man, it’s been a helluva ride. From the Vinny Del Negro days, all the way to the father-and-son-Rivers days, it was nice to see Billy Crystal happy for a few years.\n\nCP3 landed in Los Angeles prior to the 2011–12 season, and honestly, those first couple teams were some of the most talented. Still, the Clippers were never able to escape the second round; which is probably a direct correlation to Paul’s actual leadership ability. I hate to say it, but I think Stephen Curry would have led at least one of those teams out of the semi-finals.\n\nBut we’re not trying to dump on Chris Paul or his banana boat, we just want to fill you in on the RIDICULOUSLY long list of notable teammates he had in LA. Some were past their prime, some never had a prime…all were awesome in one way or another and run out of town quickly.\n\n(This list will exclude the core-group of Blake, DJ, JJ, and Jamal Crawford)\n\nLet’s start from the top…\n\nReggie Evans (11–12)\n\nKenyon Martin (11–12)\n\nYeah, that’s the most bad-ass frontcourt you could assemble.\n\nMo Williams (11–12)\n\nRandy Foye (11–12)\n\nEric Bledsoe (11–13)\n\nSwaggy P (11–12)\n\nYeah…that happened.\n\nChauncey Billups (11–13)\n\nCaron Butler (11–13)\n\nBobby Simmons (11–12)\n\nBobby Simmons won the 2005 Most Improved Player Award — wait, what?\n\nGrant Hill (12–13)\n\nLamar Odom (12–13)\n\nRonny Turiaf (12–13)\n\nMatt Barnes (12–14)\n\nOne of the 10,000 different NBA jerseys Barnes has worn.\n\nDarren Collison (13–14)\n\nDanny Granger (13–14)\n\nAntawn Jamison (13–14)\n\nHedo Turkoglu (13–14)\n\nStephen Jackson (13–14)\n\nLots of Big-3 players on this list…\n\nGlen ‘Big Baby’ Davis (13–15)\n\nJared Dudley (13–14)\n\nSasha Vujacic (13–14)\n\nTwo games, one smokin’ hot wife.\n\nAustin Rivers (14-present)\n\nDahntay Jones (14–15)\n\nChris Douglas-Roberts (14–15)\n\nCan’t mention CDR without a short-shorts picture…\n\nNate Robinson (14–15)\n\nSpencer Hawes (14–15)\n\nJosh Smith (15–16)\n\nJeff Green (15–16)\n\nWesley Johnson (15-present)\n\nPaul Pierce (15–17)\n\nLance Stephenson (15–16)\n\nMy favorite of the random CP3 Clippers’ teammates.\n\nPablo Prigioni (15–16)\n\nMy 2nd favorite…\n\nRaymond Felton (16–present)\n\nMarreese Speights (16-present)\n\nThe list is crazy — All-Stars, Hall-of-Famers, Lottery Picks, Crazy People…How Chris Paul could never got this team out of the second-round is beyond me.\n\nI have a feeling we might see a similar collection of talent join up with Houston — with the same result."
