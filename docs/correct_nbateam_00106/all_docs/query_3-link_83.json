        "text": "Here’s a look at IMG Academy forward Kenyon Martin Jr., whom the Rockets selected with the 52nd pick in the 2020 NBA Draft.\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. | Forward | IMG Academy | Birthdate: January 6, 2001 (Age: 19) | 6-7 | 215 LBS | Hometown: Los Angeles, CA\n\nQUICK BACKGROUND: Goes by K.J. Father is Kenyon Martin, the former NBA all-star who went No. 1 overall in the 2000 NBA Draft and played 15 years in the league. Martin is a similarly elite athlete to his father with all sorts of power and bounce. Started his career at Chaminade College Prep in West Hills, California, before transferring to Sierra Canyon School in Los Angeles. Helped Sierra Canyon win two state titles. Was originally planning to go to Vanderbilt, but ultimately chose to do a post-grad year at IMG Academy. He blossomed from being a three-star recruit out of high school into being a somewhat real NBA prospect due to his athleticism and burgeoning skill. The plan from the time he went with the prep year was to turn pro, and he did just that in March.\n\nBREAKDOWN: The whole bet here is on athleticism. Martin is a wildly explosive athlete at 6-foot-6 who plays through contact with power. Teams that like him are interested in him being something of a small-ball 4/5 in a couple of years after developing him. Very interesting ambidexterity. Shoots right-handed, and has improved a bit as a shooter (although there will need to be growth there). However, he goes up for every attempt at a blocked shot with his left hand. Indeed, his potential defensive versatility is where teams are intrigued. He’s quick enough as an athlete to slide on the perimeter, but also has enough bounce and lift to be a weak-side rim protector. Easy lift off of one foot or two, but prefers to be a load leaper as a finisher right now. Could compete in a dunk contest pretty easily at some point. Ultimately, the question is how much offensive game Martin develops in the next few years. Not really an attacker off the bounce at the NBA level, and doesn’t read defenses yet as a passer. Still working through his jumper, although teams are encouraged by the strides he’s made there over the last year. Will need to really develop his overall offensive game. But he has such freaky athleticism and body control that it’s tough to look past him when looking for fliers to take on two-way deals. Teams are always interested in trying to develop athletic guys like this.\n\nFIT: The first draft selection of the Rafael Stone era has shades of a longstanding attraction to the potential that exists in the Rockets’ front office. Martin Jr. doesn’t come off as “two years away from being two years away” like Bruno Caboclo — a never-ending cycle of hope — but there’s no denying what stood out to Houston during their draft evaluation process — athleticism. Martin Jr. possesses it in spades, something the team has long spoken about needing more of within the roster. Danuel House carried that mantle last season but outside of him, their lack of explosiveness at the wings was as clear as day. If the Rockets want to get younger and bouncier, Martin at 52 makes a lot of sense.\n\nNow comes the hard part, finding a fit in the current rotation. At first glance, this feels like a developmental project. Martin is a freak athlete that finishes plays hard and emphasizes power. His penchant for above-the-rim plays will wow teammates and coaches — I can foresee a number of practice dunk-offs with House and Ben McLemore. Coaches, above all, love effort, which Martin Jr. seems to have. Because of his motor, there is the real potential of turning that into a solid defensive player, banking on his quickness and shiftiness. In a system where the Rockets like to switch matchups on the defensive end, Martin Jr. could have an impact if Stephen Silas, John Lucas, and the coaching staff can hone his skills and aid his progression.\n\nIs his offensive game up to snuff though? One of the downsides of playing at IMG Academy is the opposition just isn’t of the ilk at Division 1 schools or overseas in professional leagues. Looking at his jumper from a pure mechanics standpoint, there is an element of funkiness to it, especially the follow-through. Silas wants to play up-tempo, which should suit Martin Jr., but last season’s Mavericks offense featured a lot of player reads and situational basketball. It’s unknown at this point whether his game will immediately translate to the next level. A stint with the Rio Grande Vipers might be the best approach, as Martin Jr. will be able to learn the ways of Houston and operating against more talented players than the ones he encountered at IMG Academy, while also developing his game.\n\nShould Houston’s transitional pipeline prove effective, the Rockets might reap the rewards of some pretty talented athletic wings, between Martin Jr., House, and David Nwaba.\n\nGRADE: Two-way contract\n\n(Photo: \\Cassy Athena/Getty Images)"
