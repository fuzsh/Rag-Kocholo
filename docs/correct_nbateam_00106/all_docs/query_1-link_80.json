        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” The New York Knicks have re-signed veteran forward Kenyon Martin.\n\nGeneral manager Glen Grunwald announced the signing Thursday.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 former All-Star averaged 7.2 points and 5.3 rebounds over 23.9 minutes in 18 games (11 starts) with New York last season. In 12 playoff games, he averaged 5.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.42 blocks over 21.1 minutes.\n\nMartin originally signed the first of two consecutive 10-day contracts on Feb. 23, 2013 and then was signed for the remainder of the season on March 15.\n\nThe top overall selection in the 2000 draft out of Cincinnati by the New Jersey Nets, Martin helped the Nets make two NBA Finals. He also has played for the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers but has never been healthy enough to play an entire schedule in a season."
