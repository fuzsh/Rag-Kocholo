        "text": "Kenyon Martin Jr. News\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Staying In Philly\n\nFree-agent forward Kenyon Martin Jr. agreed to a two-year, $16 million contract to remain with the 76ers. The 2020 No. 52 overall pick appeared in two games for the Clippers last season before getting moved to Philadelphia in the James Harden trade. Unfortunately, he averaged a career-low 3.7 points for Philly. With that said, Martin could get more minutes with the Sixers during the 2024-25 campaign, so his statistical contributions could improve. There's also a chance he'll be traded at some point during the season. Either way, Martin won't draw interest from fantasy managers until he starts to produce consistently. However, that's not expected to happen anytime soon.\n\n7 days ago\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Questionable Wednesday\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (toe) is considered questionable for Wednesday's play-in matchup against Miami. A toe injury kept him out for the final three regular-season games, and Martin might remain unavailable as the 76ers try to lock up their playoff berth on Wednesday. Even if he's able to return, Martin likely won't have a large part to play in the contest with Philadelphia's frontcourt fully healthy. Joel Embiid (knee) is carrying a questionable tag but is expected to be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\nApr 17\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Ruled Out Friday\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (toe) will miss a second consecutive game on Friday versus the Magic. He's dealing with a buried toe that could also keep him out for the final regular-season game on Sunday against Brooklyn. Buddy Hield and De'Anthony Melton could get a chance to see extra time on the court without Martin Jr., with the former being the better fantasy option. However, relying on Hield always tends to be risky business, and Friday's matchup is an awful one for the Sixers players fantasy-wise.\n\nApr 12\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Iffy For Friday\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (toe) might be absent for a second consecutive game on Friday versus Orlando, as the team has listed him as questionable for the contest. The high-flying youngster is trying to overcome a left big toe contusion. Martin has seen quite a bit of playing time lately, but it's come during a time when Philadelphia has been without a number of frontcourt players due to injuries. He doesn't have a big role to play when everybody's healthy, and the 76ers should do just fine without Martin if he isn't in the lineup on Friday.\n\nApr 11\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Out Against Hornets\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers small forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (ankle) is unavailable in Friday's game against Charlotte. He will miss his third consecutive game with a right ankle impingement. Before the ankle injury, Martin Jr. averaged 3.5 points, 0.7, and 1.8 rebounds in 11.5 minutes per game. He has suited up in 42 contests this season. Nicolas Batum, Ricky Council, and Darius Bazley could see more minutes with Martin sidelined.\n\nMar 1\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Questionable For Friday's Game\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers small forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (ankle) is listed as questionable for Friday's game against Charlotte. He's in danger of missing a third consecutive contest with right ankle impingement. 76ers head coach Nick Nurse noted on Thursday that Martin Jr. got through \"about three quarters\" of practice, which doesn't sound too promising regarding his potential comeback on Friday. Before landing on the shelf, Martin Jr. had gained some momentum, averaging 7.1 points and 4.5 rebounds in 19.5 minutes this month.\n\nFeb 29\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. In Danger Of Missing Another Contest\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (ankle) carries a questionable tag ahead of Tuesday's meeting with Boston. He's dealing with right ankle impingement and could be out for a second consecutive game. Martin Jr. has played a fairly significant role in the rotation lately, averaging 23.3 minutes across his last seven appearances. Kelly Oubre Jr. and De'Anthony Melton should see more action off the bench without Martin Jr. on Tuesday.\n\nFeb 27\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. Downgraded On Sunday\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers forward Kenyon Martin Jr. (ankle) is now out for Sunday's matchup with the Bucks. He was initially listed as probable on Saturday, so things must have taken a turn in the wrong direction since then. The 23-year-old has averaged 7.1 points, 4.5 rebounds, and shot 44.4% from behind the arc in February, his best stretch this season. However, it still hasn't been enough to make him a reliable fantasy contributor. At any rate, Martin's absence could at least allow Ricky Council IV to receive a few more minutes of action, although he's not worth adding to any fantasy roster.\n\nFeb 25\n\nTyronn Lue Sees Kenyon Martin Jr. Playing Multiple Positions\n\nLos Angeles Clippers forward Kenyon Martin Jr. starts out the season mainly as Kawhi Leonard's backup, but he can expect to be used in multiple positions. \"I see him as a basketball player at the three, four, five, wherever we can use him,\" Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said of Martin Jr. \"Just his athleticism, being able to switch, being able to guard different positions, being able to roll to the basket, run the floor.\" His versatility will give Martin Jr. a chance to pick up minutes in various situations, but he will definitely need to cope with a lesser role compared to his final year in Houston, when the 22-year-old was a starter for around half of the games and averaged 28.0 minutes a night.\n\nOct 12"
