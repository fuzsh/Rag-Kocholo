        "text": "Former New Jersey Nets big man Kenyon Martin recently implied that a Houston Rockets player slept with the same girl his son K.J. was talking to during a team retreat a couple years back.\n\n“I tell K.J. who’s talking to a little young lady before a couple years ago,” the elder Martin said. “I just see her around a little bit. And I tell him, ‘Listen, don’t be surprised if she’s f—— one of your teammates.’ They go to Bahamas to a little preseason team retreat. He go knock on the door. Who answer the door? He hit me right away.”\n\nThe younger Martin is in his fourth season in the NBA and first with the Philadelphia 76ers organization after spending the first three seasons of his NBA career with the Rockets.\n\nIn the offseason, the Rockets traded him to the Los Angeles Clippers. But after logging just two appearances with the Clippers this season, Los Angeles dealt him to the 76ers as part of the trade package that brought point guard James Harden to the team.\n\nHe has appeared in two games with the 76ers so far this season.\n\nThe younger Martin is fresh off the best season of his pro career with the Rockets. He averaged 12.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game while shooting 56.9 percent from the field and 31.5 percent from behind the 3-point line across 82 appearances with Houston during the 2022-23 regular season.\n\nThe elder Martin, meanwhile, played for the Denver Nuggets, Nets, New York Knicks, Clippers and Milwaukee Bucks across his 15 seasons in the NBA. The Nets drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2000 NBA Draft after he starred playing college basketball at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nThe 45-year-old earned just one All-Star nod during his career, and that was back in the 2003-04 season when he was a member of the Nets. The elder Martin averaged 16.7 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game for the Nets during the regular season.\n\nHe retired from the NBA after playing 11 games with the Bucks and a young Giannis Antetokounmpo during the 2014-15 regular season.\n\nIt’s unfortunate to hear that the younger Martin found himself in a sticky situation on a team retreat a couple of years ago. Here’s to hoping that he has found a home with the 76ers and will play for the franchise for a long time."
