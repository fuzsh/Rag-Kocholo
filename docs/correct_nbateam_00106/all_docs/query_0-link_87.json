        "text": "This LA Clippers free-agency targets piece has always been one of my favorites to write.\n\nThree years ago, I listed center Richaun Holmes, only for him to sign almost the same contract that incumbent LA Clippers starter Ivica Zubac got a year later. Two years ago, John Wall was one of my targets to watch. He signed up but didn’t finish the season with the Clippers — or the season overall.\n\nLast year? Never mind my targets (although Kenyon Martin Jr. was a Clipper for 31 whole minutes!). I was so convinced that James Harden would opt out of his contract with the Philadelphia 76ers to become a free agent that I prefaced my list with the following:\n\nWhen I looked at this year’s free-agency class, I thought about how uninspiring the options are. The Clippers aren’t in play for players like James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Josh Hart, Kristaps Porziņģis or Nikola Vučević. (Hart is the only non-All-Star in that group, but I love his game, and he’d immediately upgrade the Clippers. That’s why he’s not leaving New York.)\n\nTo be fair, the Clippers weren’t in play for Harden as a free agent — and Harden knew this, so he made some calls and opted into the final year of his contract and demanded a trade. It took four months longer than Harden wanted (which cost the Clippers at least five games), but LA was able to acquire Harden.\n\nGuess what? Not only is Harden a free agent now, but the Clippers have this year’s version of Harden in Paul George. The Clippers will aim to retain Harden, who wasn’t extension eligible and whom the Clippers could not negotiate with until after the NBA Finals. George, on the other hand, has been extension eligible all season. He is easily the biggest walk threat in the league. Like Harden last year, George has a player option. The expectation is that he will opt out and test free agency, where the Clippers hope to retain him. But it’s George’s choice.\n\nI’m not going to tell you that LeBron James is coming to the Clippers after spending the Olympics with Tyronn Lue and Kawhi Leonard. In fact, I only have one of John Hollinger’s top 25 free-agent targets on my list of free agents to watch. I did have one simple rule here, though, the player cannot be 30 years old or older at any point of the 2024-25 NBA season. The Clippers were the oldest team in the NBA last season, and all of their future Hall of Famers were older than 30, this team has to get younger and better somehow.\n\nHere are the under-the-radar options, one for each position, that I would keep an eye on for the Clippers as free agency gets underway.\n\nPoint guard: Tyus Jones\n\n2023-24 team: Washington Wizards\n\n28 years old\n\n6-foot-1, 196 pounds\n\nUnrestricted free agent\n\nHarden is a free agent, and Russell Westbrook has a player option. While Harden played a ridiculous 40.3 minutes per game in the postseason, his most in 10 years, Westbrook tallied a postseason career-low of 19.0 minutes per game. Do the math, and you see Westbrook didn’t play much overall, and most of his minutes still came next to Harden, rendering him ineffective offensively due to his struggles as a finisher and shooter.\n\nIf Westbrook chooses to move on from the Clippers, there are some other older guards that could serve as replacements. But why not Jones? He is somehow only 28 years old despite playing nine NBA seasons and he started a career-high 66 games last season in Washington. While Jones set career-highs across the board, the Wizards had their worst season in their 63-year franchise history.\n\nI doubt anyone is clamoring for Jones to get another shot as a starter, and his lack of size and strength makes him defensively-challenged. Jones is also a docile scorer, as he attempted only 40 free throws the entire season.\n\nBut Jones is active defensively, averaging 1.1 steals per game and he is a good high-floor player, annually posting some of the league’s better assist-turnover ratios. Last year, Jones averaged 7.3 assists and only 1.0 turnover per game, and he had more steals than personal fouls in each of the last six seasons. While Jones isn’t a scorer, he doesn’t hurt teams with bad shot selection; he made a career-high 1.6 3s per game on a career-best 41.4 percent. Jones was also one of the best sixth men in the league while backing up Ja Morant with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Clippers likely have bigger priorities than backup point guard, but Jones would be the best fallback option if Westbrook departs.\n\nShooting guard: De’Anthony Melton\n\n2023-24 team: Philadelphia 76ers\n\n26 years old\n\n6-foot-3, 200 pounds\n\nUnrestricted free agent\n\nYes, that is Southern California native, University of Southern California product and former Clipper fan De’Anthony Melton. Bringing a hometown favorite into the fold has been the MO for the Clippers as of late.\n\nThere are obvious concerns with Melton, sure. He’s small for a shooting guard, back issues caused him to miss more than half of the season and his defense slipped somewhat as a starter in Philadelphia compared to when he was in a bench role in Memphis. Shooting guard is also the one position that the Clippers appear to be set at as far as veterans are concerned, with both Terance Mann and Norman Powell under contract. The only reason the Clippers may want to entertain a new shooting guard is if Powell starts and/or Mann plays more small forward.\n\nIn one of those cases, Melton would be an outstanding fit as a playmaker on both ends of the floor. His nickname is “Mr. Do Something” for a reason. He’s a comfortable 3-point shooter, making 2.0 per game at 36 percent last season, and he averaged 3.0 assists per game despite playing next to multiple isolation-heavy players. He also rebounds (3.7 per game) and gets steals (1.6 per game), the latter being a major issue for the Clippers last season. Melton is a tad stretched as a starter, but if healthy, he would be one of the best reserves in the league.\n\nSmall forward: Simone Fontecchio\n\n2023-24 team: Utah Jazz, Detroit Pistons\n\n28 years old\n\n6-foot-7, 209 pounds\n\nRestricted free agent\n\nThe Pistons gave up a second-round pick to acquire Fontecchio, one of the few players who could actually make a shot for them last season, so it would behoove them to retain him. But I was impressed with Fontecchio’s game beyond his shooting, which is very good (two 3s per game, 40.1 percent 3s, 81.8 percent free throws).\n\nFontecchio competes on defense. He’s not a strong rebounder and he doesn’t make plays defensively, but he can keep isolation scorers in front of him. Offensively, he’s not just a spot-up shooter, as he can run the floor, shoot off of movement, and drive closeouts. Fontecchio is a high-floor player who could be a decent fit for the Clippers’ second unit.\n\nPower forward: Precious Achiuwa\n\n2023-24 team: Toronto Raptors, New York Knicks\n\n24 years old\n\n6-foot-8, 243 pounds\n\nRestricted free agent\n\nThis is the biggest position of need for the Clippers. They have to replace P.J. Tucker and keep Amir Coffey from playing power forward minutes.\n\nAchiuwa is not a strong offensive player. He’s not a shot creator for himself or others, and he shoots poorly outside of the paint and at the free-throw line. He is too short to be a center in most matchups.\n\nBut Achiuwa played plenty of power forward last season, especially once he got to the Knicks and played alongside another non-shooting big in Isaiah Hartenstein. Achiuwa showed that he can be effective as a rebounder on both ends of the floor. He is a versatile and rugged defender as well. Finding a role for Achiuwa offensively would be a lot easier if he were able to play with a floor-spacing big, but what Achiuwa does as a rebounder and defender would be a big upgrade on what the Clippers had for most of last season.\n\nCenter: Jalen Smith\n\n2023-24 team: Indiana Pacers\n\n24 years old\n\n6-foot-9, 215 pounds\n\nPlayer option\n\nI keep going back to Smith. Last year, I said the Clippers should trade for him, knowing that he had a 2024 player option. Smith was Indiana’s backup center after previously being tested as a starting power forward. But Smith was eventually passed on the depth chart by Isaiah Jackson. I would expect Smith to opt out and see what free agency looks like.\n\nSmith’s drawbacks are obvious. He’s undersized for the center position and thin for a big overall. His defense outside the paint remains shaky. Last season was Smith’s first time since high school that he had more assists than turnovers, but he still only averaged 1.0 assists per game. Smith’s free-throw shooting was a career-low 69.2 percent last season. He’s not great in the post, and he’s not going to create a shot for himself.\n\nSmith has continued to get better in other areas. He averaged a career-best 9.9 points per game despite playing only 17.2 minutes, making a career-best 59.2 percent from the field. He’s an outstanding finisher, and has the ability to finish in the paint outside of the restricted area. Smith is active on the glass on both ends of the floor, and he does a fair job as a rim protector. He is athletic and runs the floor, finishing well on the fast break.\n\nSmith’s shooting has come a long way. He made 42.4 percent of his 3s, and while he is good from the corners, 83.4 percent of his made 3s came above the break. Smith doesn’t just spot up for 3s, he will pick and pop comfortably. Smith also has a decent midrange jumper.\n\nSimply put, the Clippers don’t have a player like Smith, and the closest they have come to him is when Serge Ibaka was acquired in 2020. That’s the same year Smith was drafted, and as a rookie with a Phoenix Suns team completely disinterested in developing talent, Smith was assigned to the Clippers G League affiliate as a rookie. It would be quite a full circle to see Smith wind up as the backup center for the Clippers four seasons later.\n\n(Top photo of De’Anthony Melton: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images)"
