        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CBS) -Kenyon Martin is back from China to join forces with Blake Griffin and Chris Paul to Lob City.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have come to terms to sign free agent forward K-Mart, who was in China playing for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers during the lockout.\n\nMartin needs to pass a physical in order to complete the deal. The deal is a mini-midlevel contract that could be worth around $2.5 million per year for up to two years.\n\nThe 34-year-old Martin averaged 8.6 points and 6.2 rebounds last season in Denver. The deal reunites him with former Nuggets teammate Chauncey Billups, now a guard with the Clippers. Martin also has a home in Los Angeles."
