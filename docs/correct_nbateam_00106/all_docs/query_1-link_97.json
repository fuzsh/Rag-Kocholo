        "text": "While Russell Westbrook was the center point of the trade, a European player's rights were exchanged in the deal between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Utah Jazz as well. According to Adrian Wojnarowski from ESPN, the rights of Balsa Koprivica, who currently plays for Partizan Mozzart Bet Belgrade, were traded. The 24-year-old was drafted with the 57th pick in the 2021 NBA Draft.\n\nSpeculations surrounded Russell Westbrook's future with the Los Angeles Clippers. The club has ultimately decided to trade the player away. According to Adrian Wojnarowski from ESPN, the Clippers are trading the former NBA MVP to the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are planning to part ways with Russell Westbrook. If the plan materializes, the veteran guard is likely to stay in the Western Conference. Westbrook picked up his player option earlier this summer, which is worth $4 million next season. However, Shams Charania from The Athletic notes that the Clippers are preparing to let the player go either via waiving or trading him.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful finish in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament (OQT) in Athens, Greece, Croatia's stars Ivica Zubac and Dario Saric let it all out in a beach bar. It ultimately led to a fight. According to TMZ Sports, the two players got involved in a physical altercation at around 5:30 AM Sunday night in the Bolivar Beach Bar.\n\nAfter five seasons with the Los Angels Clippers, Paul George moved to play for the Philadelphia 76ers after not agreeing to a new deal with his now-former team. The player has now shared details of how the negotiations went on.\n\nGood news for Team USA ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics as Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard performed well at a training camp for the team. According to the Los Angeles Times, Leonard put up a great showing last Friday in a Team USA camp in front of Grant Hill, the team's managing director, and Steve Kerr, the head coach of USA.\n\nNicolas Batum, who was a free agent for a short time, is moving to one of his ex-teams, the Los Angeles Clippers, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported.\n\nPaul George has entered the free agency market and will look for a new contract. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the 34-year-old guard has decided not to renew his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. His salary next season would have been $48.7 million.\n\nRussell Westbrook is slated to continue his career in the Los Angeles Clippers. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Westbrook activated his $4 million player option and has returned to the team. Aged 35, the versatile guard first joined the Clippers in 2022, which is his sixth team in the NBA.\n\nBrandon Boston Jr. is slated to hit free agency after being part of the Los Angeles Clippers since 2021. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the shooting guard was not given a qualifying offer and will become a free agent. Boston, aged 22, has been with the Clippers since 2021. He was selected as the No. 51 pick in the second round of the 2021 NBA Draft by the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nAt one point, P.J. Tucker wanted to leave the Los Angeles Clippers, but he will remain with the team for the 2024-25 season. According to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the forward has opted into his $11.5 million player option for the upcoming season.\n\nOne of the NBA's veteran point guards, Chris Paul from the Golden State Warriors, may draw interest from two other teams if he hits free agency. According to Marc Stein, Paul will see the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers interested in him in the event that he becomes a free agent.\n\nGolden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers are both facing hefty luxury tax bills that surpass the NBA's salary cap for the 2023-24 season, as reported by ESPN's Bobby Marks. According to Marks, the projected luxury tax payments for the Warriors and Clippers are $176.9 million and $142.4 million, respectively. In contrast, the salary cap was set at $136 million.\n\nJeff Van Gundy has agreed to become the lead assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers head coach Tyronne Lue, according to Adrian Wojnarowski from ESPN. The 62-year-old Van Gundy spent the previous 16 years as a television analyst for ESPN before accepting a role with Boston Celtics President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens last summer.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have signed a contract extension with their head coach. According to Adrian Wojnarowski from ESPN, Tyronn Lue has agreed to a new multi-year contract extension with the organization. The deal has been finalized recently. It will make Lue one of the highest-paid coaches in the NBA, Wojnarowski adds.\n\nWith 28 teams having already finished the season, organizations are looking to strengthen their rosters for the upcoming season. Golden State Warriors guard Chris Paul is a player who has drawn the attention of multiple franchises. With previous reports stating interest from the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers, a new team should be considered added to the list.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Los Angeles franchises, this certainly has not been an easy season for you. The Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers both exited in the first round of the playoffs, leaving many to wonder how their futures might continue in the coming weeks.\n\nIn the not-so-distant past, it seemed like a sure bet that Paul George would stay put with the Los Angeles Clippers. Fast forward to today, and the narrative has shifted. Now, there's a growing sense that George might explore his options in free agency.\n\nAfter the Los Angeles Clippers lost in Game 6 against the Dallas Mavericks, reports started coming out about Russell Westbrook's possible departure. The player has responded. According to Sam Amick and Law Murray from The Athletic, Westbrook might want to leave the Clippers to search for more playing time and more money elsewhere. The player implies the priority is to stay.\n\nTyronn Lue is slated to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers for the foreseeable future. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Clippers want to extend Lue's contract to ensure that the 2025-26 season is not the last year of the coach on the team. Sources state that irrespective of this season's result, the Clippers are intent on keeping Lue.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are on the brink of elimination after getting dominated by the Dallas Mavericks, 93-123, in Game 5. The Mavericks now hold a 3-2 lead over the Clippers with the series shifting back to Dallas for Game 6. It was the Clippers' worst playoff loss in franchise history.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers will have to battle the Dallas Mavericks in an important Game 5 without Kawhi Leonard. Due to right knee inflammation, Leonard was ruled out by Clippers coach Tyronn Lue. It will be the third game that Leonard will miss in the series.\n\nKawhi Leonard was limited in Game 3 against the Dallas Mavericks. He will miss Game 4 and might miss the entire series. According to Adrian Wojnarowski from ESPN, Leonard will be sidelined in Game 4 with a knee inflammation. Additionally, Leonard's availability for the entire series is in question.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers will get a huge boost in Game 2 of their first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks. According to head coach Tyronn Lue, Kawhi Leonard will finally suit up for his first game in the 2024 NBA playoffs.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks opened their NBA playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers with a loss. Their two stars were able to carry the team—Luka Doncic had 33 points and 13 rebounds and Kyrie Irving had 31 and 7—but the Mavericks had no answer for the Clippers. Dallas only scored 30 in the first half, a playoff low for the franchise.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers will begin the series against the Dallas Mavericks without their biggest star. Kawhi Leonard will miss Game 1 due to knee inflammation, head coach Tyronn Lue announced. While the player has been on the court in the last couple of days, he hasn't practiced with contact and will be monitored day by day, the coach said.\n\nThere is growing uncertainty surrounding Kawhi Leonard's availability for the Los Angeles Clippers' playoff series Game 1 against the Dallas Mavericks, set to begin on Sunday, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Coach Ty Lue mentioned that Leonard has been getting shots up and continued to do so on Saturday with the team, but he hasn't engaged in any contact drills yet.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers have been fined for violating league rules. The NBA officially announced that the organization received a $25,000 fine for incorrectly reporting the status of several of their players for a game last Sunday, April 14th.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard will play in Game 1 of the NBA playoffs series against the Dallas Mavericks. According to Shams Chanaria and Mark Puleo of The Athletic, Leonard received an injection early in April to prepare for the upcoming showdown. The team head coach, Tyronn Lue, had stated a few days ago that they were preparing with a mindset that Leonard would be playing in Game 1."
