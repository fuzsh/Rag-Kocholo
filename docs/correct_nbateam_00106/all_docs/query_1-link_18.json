        "text": "Well this could be weird. Imagine the Nuggets, needing a basket late in the game, but being stymied on the defensive end by Kenyon Martin.\n\nIt could happen. Denver’s longtime defensive stopper is going to join the Clippers as a free agent. Denver plays the Clippers in L.A. on Feb. 22 and at home April 18.\n\nThe Martin signing is an important one for the Clippers as they try to establish themselves in unlikely territory — among the top teams in the Western Conference.\n\nThe longtime Nuggets power forward returned from playing in China and chose the Clippers and close friend Chauncey Billups, a former teammate with Denver.\n\nThe Nuggets weren’t in contention to re-sign the unrestricted free agent. Martin considered the Heat, Lakers and Hawks, among others.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any question that it will help their depth up front,” Denver coach George Karl said. “Their bench has kind of been their — I don’t know if it’s a weak link, but it gives them a three-man rotation that will be pretty good. And gives them a great frontcourt rotation at the end of games.”\n\nMartin, 34, averaged 8.6 points per game and 6.2 rebounds last season. He will join another former Nugget forward, Reggie Evans, in the frontcourt rotation for the Clippers.\n\nBrewer is back\n\nOn Thursday, Karl thought Corey Brewer might miss this entire back-to-back-to-back while the reserve forward dealt with personal issues. But Brewer was back with the Nuggets on Friday — and will play with the team tonight at Portland. Brewer has been one of the pleasant surprises for the Nuggets this season, averaging 7.9 points per game and running the floor with purpose."
