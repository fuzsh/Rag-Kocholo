        "text": "The LA Clippers began this week finishing the simple part of their offseason. After bringing back incumbent starting point guard Russell Westbrook and acquiring forward Kenyon Martin Jr. from Houston to take the spot of Eric Gordon, the Clippers re-signed backup center Mason Plumlee to a one-year, $5 million deal and inked first-round rookie power forward Kobe Brown.\n\nSeems like a bold concept — a team with a traditional point guard and a true center in the same offseason, both players who were acquired the previous February. But it hasn’t always been so straightforward for the Clippers.\n\nIn the last two offseasons, the Clippers attempted a bold strategy: why not build the whole thing out of wings?\n\nWhen Kawhi Leonard underwent right knee surgery to repair a partially torn ACL in July 2021, the team shifted toward building a roster to account for his loss. Eric Bledsoe was brought in as a trade acquisition in August 2021, consolidating the small guard position by sending out Patrick Beverley and Rajon Rondo, as well as second-year big man Daniel Oturu. While the thought originally was that Bledsoe could come off the bench while a player like Terance Mann started, coach Tyronn Lue squashed that right away in training camp: Bledsoe would start with incumbent starting point guard Reggie Jackson next to forwards Paul George and Marcus Morris Sr., with Ivica Zubac at center.\n\nThat left Mann and Luke Kennard to be the primary backup wings. Free agent Justise Winslow was seen as a “positionless” option to fill in minutes as a backup point guard and possibly getting minutes in a pinch at center. The problem with the positionless label? Some players can’t overcome their deficiencies when put in certain roles. Winslow’s poor shooting and loss of explosion after years of injuries, most notably his hip, canceled any point guard experimentation for him. Winslow was better situated at one position, power forward, while Mann more ably filled in as a backup point guard.\n\nAt the same time this was going on, the Clippers had a backup center competition for a roster spot. Serge Ibaka’s recovery from back surgery was going to keep him from starting the season on time, and the winner between Isaiah Hartenstein, Harry Giles III, and undrafted rookie Moses Wright would be in line for second-unit minutes right away. Hartenstein not only won the competition for the last spot in camp, but he wound up Wally Pipp-ing Ibaka as well, leading to Ibaka’s trade to Milwaukee Bucks at the 2022 trade deadline.\n\nBledsoe was eventually separated from Jackson in the starting lineup, and Bledsoe was much more effective as the second-unit point guard compared to being the first-unit shooting guard. Kennard, Mann, and Hartenstein were thriving in the second unit together. Nicolas Batum was supposed to be the second unit power forward, but after the injury-riddled start to the season by Morris Sr. (knee soreness) and George (torn ligament in shooting elbow), Lue moved Batum into the starting lineup permanently and paired him on the wing with then two-way contract Amir Coffey.\n\nThat same trade deadline in 2022 saw Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank deemphasize the point guard position in a drastic way. Bledsoe and Winslow were moved, along with rookie guard Keon Johnson, to Portland in exchange for Norman Powell and Robert Covington. All the Clippers got back for Ibaka were the immediately replaceable contracts of Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye. Rookie point guard Jason Preston was on the shelf all year after foot surgery. No buyout market point guard option materialized. Jackson had to play heavy minutes, and Mann had to be Lue’s backup point guard for the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Clippers chose continuity after losing two games in the 2022 Play-In Tournament. They drafted Moussa Diabaté to be a future option at center, but the second-round pick was going to be stashed on a two-way contract for a year. The Rockets finally bought out John Wall’s contract, and the Clippers scooped him up, addressing the point guard depth after largely neglecting it in 2021-22. Wall’s contract pushed Hartenstein to secure the bag from the New York Knicks, though. The Clippers were bringing back a healthy George, Leonard, and Powell to a team that already had Batum, Morris Sr., Covington, Kennard, Mann, and Coffey. Point guard wouldn’t be a dumping ground for the wing excess in 2022-23 — but the front office believed that center could be.\n\nThe original plan was to start Jackson, George, Leonard, Morris Sr., and Zubac. But take advantage of George and Leonard’s rebounding abilities and feature Batum and Covington as backup bigs. The healthy return of George and Leonard meant Batum would return to the second unit, which seemed fine despite the contract extension of Covington because Hartenstein was departing. Then when George and/or Leonard were out, Zubac could filter in with the smaller second units that featured Wall, Powell, Kennard or Mann.\n\nLeonard’s availability detonated that plan almost immediately after the regular season started. Leonard did not play in four straight games for the Clippers until mid-January. By then, the roster was in need of reform. Neither Jackson nor Wall were suitable starting point guards and Mann took over that first unit spot by the second week of January.\n\nBut the center position behind Zubac was an eyesore. Extending Zubac’s minutes led to a decline in his performance by December. The Clippers did not have the same success with training camp invite Moses Brown as the team had with the significantly more skilled Hartenstein; Brown had to be placed on a two-way contract, giving him a 50-game limit. Brown only played 15 minutes or more in five games; the Clippers lost them all. Diabaté flashed real impact in a late November comeback win at Portland, but the Clippers won only one of the six games Diabaté played more than 15 minutes, and that was a start against Washington that saw Diabaté finish with only one field goal and zero steals, blocks, or defensive rebounds.\n\nAs the trade deadline approached, the team knew what had to be done. After Diabaté’s unsuccessful rotation tryout in January, the Clippers maxed out Brown’s 50-game limit, knowing they would be waiving Brown at the All-Star break. Wall injured his abdomen in January, and he knew he would either be traded or waived by the end of the month. Jackson played well as a backup, but he was in a contract year; he knew he was going to be traded. Both Jackson and Wall wound up getting moved, and even though the Clippers acquired Gordon and Bones Hyland, that was not satisfactory to the stars. Not having a traditional point guard may have worked with Leonard and George injured and unable to do anything about it in 2022, but George spoke up in 2023, leading to Westbrook’s arrival to complete the roster.\n\nIt was Jackson who was used to secure a legitimate backup center for the Clippers, as he was sent to the Charlotte Hornets for Plumlee. It worked out for Jackson as the Hornets bought out his contract and he won a championship with his home state Denver Nuggets. Plumlee effectively replaced Brown on the team and allowed Diabaté to return to the G League and develop. Lue was thrilled to have a backup center option; while Brown and Diabaté combined to play 15 minutes or more in only 11 games (all before All-Star break), Plumlee played at least 15 minutes in 19-of-23 regular season games for the Clippers and every game against the Phoenix Suns in the postseason except Game 2 (13:36).\n\nPlumlee wasn’t a perfect addition. The Clippers had to start Plumlee four times after the All-Star break with Zubac nursing a calf injury and all were losses. The Clippers allowed 115.8 points per 100 possessions when Plumlee was on the floor last season, the second-worst figure on the team (when Gordon was on the floor, the Clippers allowed 118.3 points per 100 possessions). Plumlee isn’t a shotblocker (0.5 per game with Clippers, 0.6 per game with Hornets last season, 0.9 per game in career) and out of the 57 players who played at least 10 games and defended at least 4.0 shots at the rim last season, Plumlee’s rim protection (64.1 percent field goals allowed) ranked 52nd. By comparison, Zubac (52.5 percent field goals defended at rim) ranked sixth out of 57.\n\nPlumlee made up for his defensive issues by being an outstanding offensive player. He didn’t score much with the Clippers (7.5 points per game), wasn’t utilized fully (only 1.7 assists per game), and did not attempt a single shot outside the paint with the Clippers after making 9-of-17 midrange field goals with the Hornets. But Plumlee made 72.7 percent of his field goals, only had 1.3 turnovers per game, and made a relatively scorching 77.2 percent of his free throws after being traded to LA. The reformed southpaw was the only Clippers center to have more assists than turnovers or to make better than 70 percent from the free-throw line. Plumlee had more assists in the playoffs (9) than Brown or Diabaté had in the entire regular season combined for the Clippers (8). And Plumlee averaged 6.9 rebounds (1.8 offensive) per game for the Clippers as well in his 19.9 minute-per-game role.\n\nRe-signing Plumlee for a lone year of $5 million is a bargain, especially compared to some of the other contracts signed by backup centers. So this won’t be last season’s mess at the center position. Signing Brown adds another layer of depth there, even though the team wants to develop him at power forward, and Diabaté will likely be on another two-way contract as the team’s development center.\n\nThe Clippers are done adding free agents on the open market. The center position is set. But swapping out Gordon (who was effectively Lue’s backup point guard until George’s season-ending knee injury) for Martin puts LA’s depth chart in an interestingly familiar position. Martin’s pending addition will affect the veteran power forwards on the roster since he is expected to play, but not expected to be a realistic candidate for a starting role given his skillset. So if Martin is a second unit small forward, that shifts Mann to a second unit point guard spot for now, with the team in need of a consolidation trade involving Morris Sr., Covington, and Batum (in order of most likely to depart and least likely to depart).\n\nBrown can’t be traded until Aug. 2 — his signing gives the team 15 guaranteed contracts. Preston’s contract would be guaranteed on July 18 if he is still on the roster, and his summer league performance will go a long way toward determining how that decision is made. A solid performance and a consolidation trade are his best bets, and he could always be included in a deal if he impresses. Preston could also be waived and re-signed to a training camp deal, or the team could move on altogether. Any way you look at it, Preston is behind 2021 draft classmates Hyland and Brandon Boston, two players the Clippers are holding out of summer league entirely as they enter their third season of depth chart climbing.\n\nAs of now, 11 of the players who were on standard contracts at the beginning of the 2022-23 season are still on the team. Of the 15 players who were on standard contracts at the end of the All-Star break, only Gordon is not on the team. The first wave of free agency has come and gone. The only way the Clippers shake up the roster is to complete the big trade, whether that is for James Harden, Damian Lillard (less ideally), or Malcolm Brogdon (less impactfully). That move could take weeks or months, but the Clippers know they have to do something before the summer ends for this to be a satisfactory offseason of required change.\n\n(Top photo of Mason Plumlee: Petre Thomas/USA Today)"
