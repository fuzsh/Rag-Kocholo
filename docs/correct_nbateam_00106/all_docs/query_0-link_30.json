        "text": "Kenyon Martin has received clearance to sign with an NBA team after leaving the Chinese Basketball Association, reports ESPN's Marc Stein. Martin had joined a Chinese club as the NBA lockout cut into the 2011-12 regular season, despite the Chinese government passing rules that would not have allowed teams to waive NBA imports should the lockout end. Martin's Denver teammates J.R. Smith and Wilson Chandler had also signed in China, and both remain there.\n\nYahoo!'s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that FIBA granted the necessary letter of clearance to Martin after the Chinese league failed to respond to the power forward's request."
