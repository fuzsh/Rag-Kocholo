        "text": "Both Martin and Coach Vinny Del Negro said there is no timetable for him to play in a game, but Martin said he’d like to be in uniform playing before the team finishes a six-game, 10-day trip that continues Monday night against the Orlando Magic. The Clippers won Martin’s services over the Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs, New York Knicks and Atlanta Hawks. “The Clippers were a good makeup of a team before I got here,” Martin said. “They were old and young. I’m about winning. I’m about winning basketball games. And I felt the best chance to help was here.”\n\nMartin felt as if he could provide Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan with a veteran’s knowledge of how to be a successful big man. Martin averaged 8.6 points and 6.2 rebounds with the Denver Nuggets last season in 48 games, but he averaged 13.5 points and 7.2 rebounds over his 11-year NBA career in New Jersey and Denver. “With my knowledge of the game, I know I can help Blake,” Martin said. “I’ve been where Blake is — a whole lot of athleticism and not really knowing how to play. He’s getting it, but I think me being here, being around and talking to him and DeAndre, I think it’s going to help a lot.”\n\nDel Negro said he didn’t think Martin would play in a game with the Clippers for a few days. When he does, Del Negro said, Martin will be the third big man on the team. “He’s a pro and I think he’s going to fit in perfect for us,” Del Negro said on the team’s plane Friday before the Clippers flew to Washington to start a six-game trip that begins against the Wizards on Saturday. “I’ve talked to him a lot and kind of explained everything and he’s very comfortable with the situation. Now we’ve just got to get him in here and figure things out as we go forward.”\n\nMartin apparently was sold, because on Friday he signed a one-year, mini mid-level contract for $2.5 million to play for the Clippers. Del Negro said Martin will provide the Clippers with quality depth in the frontcourt off the bench to help out All-Star power forward Blake Griffin, center DeAndre Jordan and Reggie Evans. Del Negro said the plan was for Martin to to join the team in Orlando by Sunday or Monday.\n\nThe Nuggets are said to be fuming that the league’s new labor agreement wouldn’t allow them to sign-and-trade Kenyon Martin to his new team — thereby positioning Martin to make a little more money in the deal and score an asset for Denver in the process — but the Clippers’ offer of $2.5 million for the rest of the season trumped all other suitors because of the role they can offer with it. Word is that Martin prefers to play in the West because the proliferation of quality power forwards throughout the conference should translate to more playing time. That’s especially true with the Clippers, who desperately need another big man to join Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan and Reggie Evans.\n\nSources close to the situation say that the Clippers initially wanted to make a run at shooting guard J.R. Smith as well but conceded that frontcourt depth is the bigger priority and have focused on Martin. It’s the opposite approach to that taken by the Knicks, who also had interest in both ex-Nuggets but have a greater need for Smith’s perimeter shooting than Martin’s defensive know-how and are thus focused on trying to land Smith when he returns from China in the next month."
