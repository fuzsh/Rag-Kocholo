        "text": "The Gotham Ballers, who will play most of their home games at a downsized Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, have been announced as one of 16 teams in the new Championship Basketball League, comprised of former NBA players.\n\nEx-Net (and ex-Knick) Kenyon Martin (age 39), ex-Knick Al Harrington (36), ex-Sun Shawn Marion (38), and ex-Cavalier Daniel Gibson (30) are among those listed on the Ballers roster.\n\nThe teams will play 14-game schedules in July and August, then have a tournament in Las Vegas in September. (Having covered the NBA throughout the 1990s, I can promise you that there will be plenty of current NBA stars in Las Vegas hooting and hollering at their ex-teammates from the stands and from the luxury suites.)\n\nThe sports business gimmick is that fans can invest in the team directly.\n\nShares are $7 apiece, with a minimum investment of $140 that gets you two game tickets (face value $25) and pre-game meet-and-greets with players, among other things.\n\nA $500 investment also gets you into team practices, or double that investment and add two Ballers jerseys and an invite to a party at Walt Frazier's Restaurant in Manhattan to meet Clyde and Earl Monroe.\n\nFor five grand, you get four season tickets as well, among other perks. For $25,000, you also get to be an honorary assistant coach for a game as well an invite to \"spring training\" in June plus four tickets to the CBL title game in Las Vegas.\n\n“When launching the team, we knew that what fans wanted more than anything was to be treated like an owner,” said Carl George, CEO and President of the Champions League in a statement. “So we created the opportunity where fans could be owners, with the amazing perks ownership implies. This is actual ownership, so fans become owners along with our founding team owners, so it is a once in a lifetime opportunity for fans to be more connected than ever before to a professional sports team. Fans for the first time can profit from ownership as well as enjoy all the special perks that only ownership can bring.\"\n\nHaving covered many start-ups - from the World League of American Football to the XFL to the UFL - one thing I can assure anyone of is that there will be hiccups. Many of the 16 franchises are liable to be a one-and-done, and contraction is common.\n\nThe disclaimers are lengthy and can be found here.\n\nMy favorite team names are the Miami Beach Kings, the Houston Hustle, and the Orlando Juice (a majority of the 16 teams have singular nicknames, a long and inexplicable tradition for startup leagues).\n\nBut what will make or break the product is the name recognition of the players and the quality of the play - although having a contract with ESPN3 to show the games is a good start."
