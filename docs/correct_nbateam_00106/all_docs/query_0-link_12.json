        "text": "Doug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nAll season long, the Los Angeles Clippers have shown that they are the real deal.\n\nThe players have begun to mesh with each other and they have become comfortable with coach Vinny Del Negro's system, as a result the offense has continued to improve.\n\nBut there was one flaw that time on the floor together could not solve: The lack of depth in the low post.\n\nObtaining Kenyon Martin is a big step towards solving that problem. Although K-Mart has slowed down from his glory days in Denver, he still has the strength and defensive prowess that can make any team better defensively. That defensive talent should take the Clippers from a contender to a favorite.\n\nUp to this point the Clippers have been one of the worst rebounding teams in the NBA, tied with the Milwaukee Bucks for 24th, averaging only 40.8 boards a game They have been bad defensively too, allowing 97 points per game.\n\nK-Mart can help fix both those numbers.\n\nIn his career he has been a solid rebounder and a good shot-blocker, which is exactly what the Clippers need. More than anything, however, he is just an overall upgrade as the first big man off the bench.\n\nUp to this point in the season—after starters center DeAndre Jordan and power Forward Blake Griffin—veteran journeyman Reggie Evans has been the first big man off the bench. K-Mart is an upgrade over Evans in every department.\n\nNow, Del Negro has four forwards he should feel comfortable putting on the floor at any time, which should take some pressure off Jordan and Griffin."
