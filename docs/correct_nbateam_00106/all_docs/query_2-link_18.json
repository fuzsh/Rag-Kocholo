        "text": "During a recent podcast episode with The Athletic's Kelly Iko, former Houston Rockets forward Kenyon Martin Jr. opened up about his trade to the LA Clippers. Martin thanked the Rockets for giving him an opportunity to prove that he is an NBA player, and also shared his excitement for the opportunity to play with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\n\n\"It's a different experience from the Rockets,\" Martin said. \"I'm excited. I know Kawhi got two rings, and PG trying to fight for one. I think I'll fit right in. I'm going to help them get open and feed off them.\"\n\nMartin is an incredible athlete who impressed the Clippers with his performance against them in LA last season, when he finished with 22 points and 9 rebounds with several emphatic dunks. The Clippers have been in desperate need of youth and athleticism, and Martin checks both of those boxes.\n\nStill with roster work to do, it's unclear exactly how the Clippers plan to utilize Martin, but he will certainly have a role on a team that lacks a lot of what he brings. Still just 22 years old, Martin is younger than both players the Clippers just drafted, yet he already has three years of NBA experience. The son of former Clippers forward Kenyon Martin, Kenyon Martin Jr. is excited to play in LA.\n\nKevin Durant Gets Honest About Russell Westbrook's Impact\n\nPaul George Reveals Conversation With Kawhi Leonard After Devastating Injury"
