LOS ANGELES (CBS) -Kenyon Martin is back from China to join forces with Blake Griffin and Chris Paul to Lob City.

The Los Angeles Clippers have come to terms to sign free agent forward K-Mart, who was in China playing for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers during the lockout.

Martin needs to pass a physical in order to complete the deal. The deal is a mini-midlevel contract that could be worth around $2.5 million per year for up to two years.

The 34-year-old Martin averaged 8.6 points and 6.2 rebounds last season in Denver. The deal reunites him with former Nuggets teammate Chauncey Billups, now a guard with the Clippers. Martin also has a home in Los Angeles.
