        "text": "During the history of science, many biologists tried to name and describe animal species. There are several theories and hypothesis to classify and name species. It is vital to understand the role and goal of taxonomy related to the evolution of animals and how taxonomy impacts the science of evolution. More studies have been taken on unicellular organisms and their processes. One of the crucial processes is symbiogenesis. Biologists studied the process of symbiogenesis and they linked it to the increasing amount of oxygen in early ages. They found several strategies on how organisms adapted to this great oxidation event. Scientists argued that some events caused a mass distinction of species at different ages. They also discussed how these losses affect the classification of species. Another new factors can influence the biodiversity of species, such as human factors and environmental factors.\n\nIt is argued that allometric principles account for most of the observed variation in the life history patterns amongst birds. To test this contention it is shown that traits such as incubation time, growth rates, age at first reproduction, lifespan, clutch weight and egg weight all scale to body weight with exponents similar to those found for analogous traits in mammals. It is then shown that most of the variation amongst bird taxa and between birds and mammals based on body weight allometry can be explained by variations in brain size, body temperature and metabolic rate, consistent with theories of growth and ageing derived from mammalian studies. Finally, it is suggested that the evidence for life histostory allometry is sufficiently strong that it argues for a more epigenetic view of life history patterns and their evolution than is generally conceded in most adaptation theories.\n\nThe article investigates the possibility of use of morphological characteristics of eggs as criteria for the solution of questions of systematics and phylogeny of birds of prey. The comparison of systematical dendrograms developed by different authors on the basis of morphology, comparative anatomy and DNA analysis with polynom indexes and factors calculated for 1322 eggs of birds of prey give the grounds to believe that morphological parameters of eggs can serve as an additional criteria in systematics and phylogeny of birds.\n\nThere are currently four world bird lists referenced by different stakeholders including governments, academic journals, museums and citizen scientists. Consolidation of these lists is a conservation and research priority. In reconciling lists, care must be taken to ensure agreement in taxonomic conceptsâ€”the actual groups of individual organisms circumscribed by a given scientific epithet. Here, we compare species-level taxonomic concepts for raptors across the four lists, highlighting areas of disagreement. Of the 665 species-level raptor taxa observed at least once among the four lists, only 453 (68%) were consistent across all four lists. The Howard and Moore Checklist of the Birds of the World contains the fewest raptor species (528), whereas the International Ornithological Community World Bird List contains the most (580) and these two lists are in the most disagreement. Of the disagreements, 67% involved owls, and Indonesia was the country containing the most disagreed upon s..."
