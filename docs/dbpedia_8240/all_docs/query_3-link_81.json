        "text": "The next calendar year will be an important one at the institutional level for Barcelona.\n\nJosep Maria Bartomeu's time will end in June 2021 but he won't be able to run for re-election and his successor will become known in early 2020.\n\nWithout official confirmation, Emili Rousaud is the one chosen but the selection hasn't been a simple process.\n\nAll signs pointed towards Jordi Cardoner for early candidacy. The vice president, though, turned down the opportunity.\n\nXavi Vilajoana and Maria Teixidor's names were discarded, leaving Rousaud and Oriol Tomas as the two 'finalists'.\n\nThe board face two huge issues in 2020 that will mark the future of the club.\n\nOne, naturally, is sporting. The club need to keep winning titles. A Champions League win may lead to an early call for elections.\n\nThe second is the Espai Barca. The construction of a new stadium is a headache for Bartomeu but in recent days permission was finally obtained by the city council for the urbanisation of the land adjacent to the Camp Nou.\n\nNext, the financing of the project needs to be approved.\n\nBut there is opposition who have entered the debate who don't trust the accounts presented, and they've asked for a referendum through Victor Font.\n\nAny decisions now taken will be with the elections in mind, and one thing that needs resolving is Lionel Messi's contract, which is likely to be handled in the second half of the year.\n\nFont has expressed his desire to run for president publicly."
