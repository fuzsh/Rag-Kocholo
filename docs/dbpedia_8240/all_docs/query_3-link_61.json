        "text": "Daniel Robb grew up on Rosewood Drive in Northeast Ohio, and it is on that street that he developed the qualities that form the foundation of who he is today. It is on that street that he learned the values of hard work, resilience, steadfastness, and integrity from his father—a man who grew up in poverty on a farm in Iowa and went on to become a successful physician. Rosewood Capital Ventures is founded on the same principles of integrity, perseverance, and hard work that were once taught on that street in Northeast Ohio. Daniel earned a bachelor’s and master’s degree from Bowling Green State University, where he studied finance and accounting. He started his career as an associate at Ernst & Young where he was able to develop a strong understanding of financial statements and cultivate his ability to work with diverse clientele. He went on to serve his country as a ground intelligence officer in the Marines. While serving as a military officer, he had the privilege of leading more than 500 personnel, and developing high-level intelligence products used in combat zones around the world. He was promoted to the rank of Captain before leaving the Marine Corps. Daniel also had an opportunity to work for Amazon as a procurement category manager. In a short period of time, he was able to develop an innovative program that generated significant annual cost savings. He temporarily paused his working career in order to obtain his MBA at the University of Cambridge. He enjoys traveling and the photos used on our website were taken by him all over the world."
