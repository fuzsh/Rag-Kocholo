        "text": "Notes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor the Fifth Sunday following Epiphany 2022\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Canon in B Major – Robert Schumann (1810-1856)\n\nOpening Hymn: 665 “All my hope on God is founded” (Michael)\n\nSequence Hymn: 660 “O master let me walk with thee” (Maryton)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Alleluia: Senex puerum – William Byrd (c. 1540-1623)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 649 “O Jesus, joy of loving hearts” (Dickinson College)\n\nCommunion Anthem: Nunc Dimittis from Second Service – Thomas Tomkins (1572-1656)\n\nFinal Hymn: 410 “Praise, my soul, the King of heaven” (Lauda anima)\n\nPostlude: In dir ist Freude – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nWell, the best laid plans for last week were foiled by a singer’s last-minute travel difficulties, so we did something entirely different than planned. I’ve moved the two choral anthems from last week to this week, so see last week’s notes for those!\n\nInstead, we did two Villancicos in honor of the Virgin Mary from a collection commonly called the Canionero de Upsala, published in 1556. Though it seems confusing that a collection with “Uppsala” in its name would contain Spanish music, it does, and it’s just called that because the only manuscript is currently housed in the library at the University of Uppsala in Sweden. Both “E la don don” and “Gozate” are villancicos in old Spanish meant for Christmas. The author and composer of both is unknown, though “E la don don” may be attributed to either Mateo Flecha el Viejo (best known for his Villancico, “Ríu, ríu, chíu,” which is also in this collection) or Bartomeu Càrceres. As you may have noticed, “E la don don” is quite a bit more up-tempo than “Gozate,” and may have benefitted from a drum (though we didn’t have one handy)!\n\nThe organ postlude for this Sunday is also a postponed one, which I had originally planned to play on January 2nd before we decided to worship remotely for the month! Though the chorale, In dir ist Freude is associated with the new year, it’s a general hymn of praise, and is one of the more substantial and “fun” preludes from Bach’s Orgelbüchlein, with the chorale theme being passed among different voices in imitative counterpoint over a repeating pedal figure. The organ prelude, by contrast, is a slow and tranquil canon by Robert Schumann from his collection of six canons for pedal piano. As its name would suggest, a pedal piano is simply a piano with an organ-style pedalboard, and was a popular practice instrument for organists in the 19th Century. The Schumann household bought one in the 1840’s at the same time that Robert and Clara did some focused study on counterpoint. Naturally, Robert wanted to try out some of that study on this new instrument! The canon in B Major is the last and slowest in the set. A Canon is a piece in which a voice follows the melody, imitating it a bit later (for a simple example, think “Row, row, row your boat”).\n\nWhen the season after Epiphany goes on this long (that is, when Easter is on the late side, which it is this year), the tone of the Sunday lectionary tends to turn slightly more penitential, perhaps echoing the old Pre-Lenten season (called “Septuagesima” or “Shrovetide”) which most Western churches did away with in the 1960’s. The hymns, therefore, turn a bit more introspective than they have been, and I went for a theme of trust in God for this week, especially present in the Epistle and Gospel appointed. We start with Herbert Howells’s excellent tune (and one of my favorites if you haven’t noticed!), Michael, named for his young son who sadly died of polio. The text, however which translates a 17th Century German text by Joachim Neander, speaks of trust in God above all else. “O master let me walk with thee,” a late-19th Century text, talks about serving God, and works well with both the Epistle and Gospel, in which, respectively, Paul and the fishermen drop everything to follow Jesus. This is paired with a tranquil tune of a similar vintage by Henry Percy Smith. “O Jesus, joy of loving hearts” talks of trust in God with a Eucharistic bent and is a translation of a text attributed to St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who is known for proliferating the Cistercian monastic order (though the dog breed is named for a different St. Bernard). The tune is by Lee Hastings Bristol, a native Brooklynite who comes from the family which is the Bristol in Bristol Myers-Squibb, and who served on the Standing Committee for Church Music of the Episcopal Church for a while and eventually was the President of my alma mater, Westminster Choir College. Finally, we’ll go out singing one of the most quintessential Anglican hymns, to a tune by a former organist of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London (John Goss). The text, a song of praise by 19th Century poet and Priest Henry Francis Lyte, is quite a bit more extroverted than the other texts sung on Sunday.\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor the Fourth Sunday following Epiphany 2022\n\n​\n\nLast week, we heard from two of the most prominent “continental” composers of the late 16th Century. But what was going on in England? Much of the 16th Century was a time of a lot of religious upheaval and back and forth as to what the Church in England should look like, from the time Henry VIII was denied an annulment of his marriage to his brother’s widow (Catherine of Aragon, as it happens, was Charles V’s aunt, and The Pope was a captive of Charles V at that point), to the first Act of Supremacy passing in 1534, declaring the English monarch as the “Supreme Head of the Church of England,” to Queen Mary I’s attempts to reverse the reformation, to Queen Elizabeth I taking the throne in 1558, passing a second act of supremacy in 1560, and being declared illegitimate and excommunicated by Pope Pius V in a Papal Bull written in 1570. All the while, Bishops, theologians, royal advisors, and others jockeyed about what form the Church of England should take, many looking toward reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin. But what does this all have to do with music?\n\n​\n\nSeveral composers had to navigate the changing needs of the Church during the English Reformation, most notably Thomas Tallis (1505-1585), whose output ranges from simple psalm tones to perhaps the crowning achievement of English Renaissance polyphony, his 40-voice Motet Spem in Alium (written for 8 5-voice choirs), and William Byrd (c. 1540-1623), who remained a Catholic and fell under suspicion despite being a favored composer in the Elizabethan court. The more reformed church demanded simpler music with more homophonic textures (i.e. all voices of a piece move at the same time), while the more florid Catholic music was much more polyphonic (England was not alone in this; while Lutheranism largely didn’t have an issue with complex music, some Calvinist traditions did, and some even went so far as to ban any music at all during worship). As time went on and the relationship between the Catholic Church and the English Crown became more strained, the more “Catholic” style of music came to be viewed with suspicion, especially as the Mass was seen as a subversive activity and English Catholics had to go underground and meet in secret.\n\n​\n\nByrd continued to write both in the simpler “English” style and the more florid “Catholic” style throughout his life, and likely wrote some pieces for the clandestine celebrations of the Mass which he no doubt attended. His famous Mass settings (one for 3 voices, one for 4 voices, and one for 5 voices) were published separately likely to keep them more under wraps, since anyone found with the part-books might have been considered a bit subversive at points. His Gradualia collection, therefore, is impressive. It’s a massive anthology of polyphonic settings of the minor propers used in the Catholic Mass. “Alleluia: Senex Puerum” comes from the verse sung before the gospel at the Mass of Candlemas unless Septuagesima (in the old calendar, the beginning of the three week period before Lent, during which the word “Alleluia” is not used) falls before Candlemas. Gradualia demonstrates Byrd’s mastery of the florid style of polyphony, and this short 5 voice piece spends a lot of time with cascading alleluias.\n\n​\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum of English music, we have a Nunc Dimittis (in English) by Thomas Tomkins, meant to be sung at services of Evening Prayer. Tomkins worked a generation later than Byrd, and his Second Service was published posthumously. The texture is largely homophonic, making the text easily understandable, and much of the interest lies in the harmonic progression of the music rather than the counterpoint.\n\n​\n\nYou may have noticed that the music I chose is for the feast day which falls next Wednesday and has a few different names. The Feast of the Presentation of Our Lord in the temple, also known as the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also known as Candlemas, falls on February 2nd and commemorates when Mary went to the temple 40 days after childbirth to be purified and present her son in the temple. It’s then, in the Gospel of Luke, that an old man named Simeon sings the Nunc Dimittis, which has become an integral part of Christian worship since then (including in Anglican offices). The hymn is also for this feast. The tune is a psalm tone from late 16th Century England (representing the simplest end of the spectrum of English Church music), first published in Damon’s Psalter in 1572. The text is significantly newer, published by an Englishman named John Ellerton in 1880, and sets the story of Candlemas to music.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor the Fourth Sunday following Epiphany 2022\n\n​\n\nLast week, we heard from two of the most prominent “continental” composers of the late 16th Century.

The text is significantly newer, published by an Englishman named John Ellerton in 1880, and sets the story of Candlemas to music.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor the Third Sunday following Epiphany 2022\n\nTomás Luis de Victoria, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, and Orlande de Lassus were the three most prominent musicians in Europe in the late 16th Century. All three were prolific, all from different parts of Europe, and all eventually associated with the “counter-reformation,” the movement in the Catholic church which sought to respond to the Reformations happening in some parts of Europe, culminating in the Council of Trent. Victoria, who was born in Spain and spent the beginning and end of his career there, will not be heard on Sunday (though he’s my favorite of the three!), but the other two will. Lassus, who was born in modern-day Belgium, was considered the best composer of the Franco-Flemish school of his time and is the only one of the three who likely never lived in Rome. He settled in Munich and made frequent visits to Ferrara, an Italian city especially known for its rather avant-garde (in modern terminology) music scene, where composers such as Luzzasco Luzzaschi and Nicola Vicentino (who invented a microtonal keyboard instrument) experimented within a very permissive musical culture. Ferrara’s scene became a particular source of inspiration for Carlo Gesualdo, the (in)famous Prince of Venosa known both for his unusual use of chromaticism in his late Madrigals and Tenebrae Responsories and for brutally murdering his wife and her lover upon catching them “in flagrante,” and a prominent collective of women made music there, which was certainly unusual for the time. Lassus remained much more musically conservative than the people who worked in Ferrara, but he doubtless took some influence from the place!\n\n​\n\nThe third, Palestrina, is probably the most well-known of the three, and was especially favored by the Vatican because he was the first prominent Italian composer hanging around the Vatican for a long time, and a church centered in Rome liked having a hometown boy as its foremost musician. As his name would suggest, Palestrina was born in the town of Palestrina, which is quite close to Rome. He worked as an organist and chorister at various churches around Rome until he lost his wife to the bubonic plague and he got remarried to a wealthy widow, which gave him financial independence and allowed him to focus more on composition. His music is often held up as the platonic ideal of “correct” Renaissance counterpoint, and was studied by composers for a long time to come, including a certain young Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n​\n\nBefore Morning Prayer, we’ll hear the second part of Palestrina’s most famous motet, Sicut Cervus, which sets the first few verses of Psalm 42. We heard the first part, which sets the first two verses, a few weeks ago. “Sitivit anima mea” sets the verse that translates to “my soul is athirst for God, even the living God.” After Morning Prayer, we’ll hear a setting of the Offertory Verse of the traditional Minor Propers for the Third Sunday after Epiphany, whose text is taken from Psalm 118. This short motet passes a simple theme between the four voices.\n\nDundee, the simple, short, and sweet hymn tune, appears three times in The Hymnal 1982! The tune first appeared in a Scottish Psalter published in 1615 as a miscellaneous tune (not associated with any particular psalm), and was later harmonized in Thomas Ravenscroft’s Whole Booke of Psalmes from 1621. The tune is named for a city in Scotland. The text, by a Scotsman named John Morison, paraphrases parts of Isaiah 9, and has gone through many revisions over the years. The original text began “The race that long in darkness pined.” It concerns itself with the promise of Jesus’s coming, and of its implications for all people.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor the Sunday following Epiphany 2022\n\n​\n\n​\n\nI skipped last week because of the need to formulate last-minute plans; the music will be different for the next few weeks, but hopefully this wave will abate before too long and we’ll be back to business as usual!\n\nLast week, we did two medieval English carols (one arranged by Gustav Holst). The Coventry Carol, also known as Lully Lullay, is among the darker popular Christmas Carols. It tells the story of the Holy Innocents (Holy Innocents’ Day is on December 28, though in the 1979 BCP calendar it was pushed back a day this year), the young children in Bethlehem who Herod ordered to be killed to prevent Jesus from taking his throne. The carol is rendered as a creepy lullaby to the children about to be slain by Herod’s soldiers. The Coventry Carol was traditionally performed as part of one of the famous Coventry Mystery Plays. It comes from the first one, known as the Shearmen and Tailors’ Pageant, which acts out the events from the Annunciation until the slaughter of the Holy Innocents. Though this first play is one of only two that survives to this day (The other being the Weavers’ Pageant which deals with the events around the Presentation of Jesus to the temple), the full set of around ten plays was very popular in the 16th and 17th Centuries. Despite the horrifying story surrounding it, the Coventry Carol remains a much-loved carol to this day!\n\nThough his name would suggest otherwise, Holst was indeed an Englishman; his father was of German, Swedish, and Latvian ancestry (his mother was English, though). The carol itself comes from a 15th Century collection and was originally in Middle English, but Holst’s version modernizes it a bit. Like many carols of that era, it’s macaronic, meaning it has text in both English and Latin; the Latin generally refers to well-known hymns (Veni creator spiritus, O lux beata trinitas, etc)...\n\nWe also sang the much loved Epiphany carol, “We three kings,” with its text and tune by John Henry Hopkins, Jr (no relation that I know of). Hopkins was an Episcopal Priest, who spent much of his ministry as Rector of Christ Church in Williamsport, PA and as a music instructor at General Seminary. He wrote “We three kings” for a Christmas pageant at General. Hopkins came from a prominent Episcopalian family! His father, John Henry Hopkins, was the eighth Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church, and was responsible for reuniting The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America with the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America after the Civil War. He also represented The Episcopal Church at the first Lambeth Conference in 1867, which formed the Anglican Communion as we know it.\n\nThis week, if the pandemic permits us to gather the forces, we’ll take the occasion of Our Lord’s baptism to offer one of the most famous pieces of Renaissance Polyphony in the repertoire: Palestrina’s Sicut Cervus. This is a setting of the first couplet of Psalm 42 (As the deer longs for the water-brooks, so longs my soul for you, O God). Palestrina is probably the most famous of the big 3 Counter-Reformation composers (the other two being Tomás Luis de Victoria and Orlande de Lassus); he was Italian, which was a big plus for the Catholic establishment in Rome, and married a wealthy widow late in life, which meant he had time to be very productive. At the end of Morning Prayer, we’ll do a sort of jam, as it were, with a popular shape-note hymn: Star in the East. This tune comes from the Southern Harmony shape note collection published in 1835. Shape note singing was developed as a way to teach rural American churchgoers how to sing in parts, largely using pentatonic modes and simplified solfège (using only fa, sol, la and mi rather than do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si).\n\nThe hymn we’ll sing on Sunday combines a very old tune (found in a 15th Century manuscript, but probably older than that) with a text by Charles Coffin, a Jansenist French writer who published a number of Latin hymns. The hymn is a meditation on the star which appeared over the stable in Bethlehem.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Christmas Weekend 2021\n\n​\n\nSince Christmas falls on a Saturday this year, we have 3 different services in as many days, so there’s a lot of music to talk about!\n\n​\n\nWe’ll start the service on Christmas Eve with the usual half-hour prelude, with music for organ, choir, and a couple solos, interspersed with some hymns. This will include two selections from the Llibre Vermell de Montserrat, a 14th Century collection of devotional texts and music meant for pilgrims to the monastery on Montserrat, near Barcelona with texts in Latin, Old Spanish, and Catalan. Both pieces we’ll do on Friday are odes to Mary in Latin. The performances will contrast greatly, though; we’ll perform the gorgeous melody of “Mariam Matrem” pretty much as written, while Stella Splendens will be quite a bit more raucous, even featuring bagpipes (though the quieter indoor variety, not the Scottish Highlands variety usually used in parades)! We will also hear a popular Christmas carol by Adolphe Adam, “Cantique de Noel,” aka “O Holy Night.” Adam was a prominent French opera composer in his day, but is remembered mostly for this Christmas song. Finally, we’ll hear a simple arrangement of a popular English Christmas carol, “Ding Dong Merrily on High,” adapting a French dance tune from the 16th Century.\n\n​\n\nDuring the Eucharist itself, we’ll hear a famous Christmas motet by one of the most famous Renaissance polyphonists to this day: Tomás Luis de Victoria. Though he spent much of his career in Spain, he did travel to Rome and became associated with the Counter-Reformation as one of the big 3 composers, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus. Victoria is my favorite of the three, and his setting of “O Magnum Mysterium,” a Matins Responsory for Christmas Day, is a near-perfect setting of the text in my estimation. We’ll also do the Gloria from his Mass setting based on the motet; see if you can spot the similarities! The other choral anthem is a beloved setting of Christina Rossetti’s poem, “In the bleak mid-winter,” by Harold Darke. This is one of two familiar settings of this work (the other by Gustave Holst). Rossetti’s poem first appeared in the January 1872 issue of Scribner’s Monthly, and Darke’s wrote his setting in 1909 while he was a student at the Royal College of Music. It has remained a beloved carol, winning a choirmaster poll of “best Christmas carol” as recently as 2008!\n\n​\n\nThe major organ work we’ll hear on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day may be the most obvious homage to the North German “Stilus Phantasticus” employed by the likes of Buxtehude and Bruhns in Bach’s catalog of organ works. The Toccata in E Major lengthens the structure of the typical North German Praeludium, with two fully developed fugues and lengthy interlude sections, rather than the much shorter sections one would expect from the earlier North Germans. Bach’s influences were many, but he gravitated toward the North German school early in his life, even traveling over 200 miles each way to Lübeck to hear Buxtehude play when he was a young man. We’ll hear more Bach on Sunday, with two contrasting chorale preludes on the tune “In Dulci Jubilo” (Good Christian Friends, Rejoice); one is a spritely one from the Orgelbüchlein, Bach’s collection of short chorale preludes, and another is a bombastic stand-alone one, clearly influenced by the Stilus Phantasticus.\n\n​\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, we’ll hear selections from Peter Cornelius’s song cycle, Weihnachtslieder (Christmas Songs). Each song describes a different character or theme from Christ’s nativity and youth, and we’ll hear songs about the shepherds, the Christmas Tree, the Christ Child, and the three wise men. Cornelius was a composer of some prominence during his lifetime, mostly of opera, but has become a footnote nowadays. “The three kings” may be his most recognized piece due to an arrangement for baritone solo and choir, and if you recognize the accompaniment, that’s because it’s a hymn tune for Epiphany (Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, or “How bright appears the morning-star”)!\n\n​\n\nAnd then we, of course, will sing a bunch of Christmas carols, from traditional favorites like the popular Latin carol, “Adeste Fidelis” (O come, all ye faithful), various adaptations of tunes from popular composer’s works set to English texts (like “Hark, the Herald Angels sing,” which was originally “Hark how all the Welkin Rings,” to a tune by Mendelssohn, and “Joy to the world,” to a tune by Handel). There are some traditional English carols in there (God rest ye merry, gentlemen, While shepherds watched their flocks by night), an old Latin carol (of the Father’s love begotten), a traditional American carol (O little town of Bethlehem), an African-American spiritual (go tell it on the mountain), a modern classic whose tune was written by a still prominent NYC-based church musician, David Hurd, who was once Music Director at All Saints and is now across town at St. Mary the Virgin (A stable lamp is lighted), an intimate Austrian carol (Silent night), A German carol (Good Christian friends, rejoice), A French carol (Angels we have heard on high), and a sturdy 18th Century English hymn (Christians awake, salute the happy morn). It’s enough to inspire full-throated singing, even through masks!\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday December 19th. ADVENT 4\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Magnificat primi toni – Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637-1707)\n\nOpening Hymn: 56 “O come, O come Emmanuel” (Veni, veni Emmanuel)\n\nSequence Hymn: 269 “Ye who claim the faith of Jesus” (Den des Vaters Sinn geboren)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Ther is no rose of swytch virtu – Anon. 15th Century\n\nOffertory Hymn: 265 “The angel Gabriel from heaven came” (Gabriel’s Message)\n\nCommunion Anthem: Ave Maria – Robert Parsons (c.1535-c.1572)\n\nFinal Hymn: 81 “Lo, how a rose e’er blooming” (Es ist ein Ros)\n\nPostlude: Es ist ein Ros entsprungen – Johannes Brahms (1833-1897)\n\n​\n\nHere we are at the fourth Sunday in Advent already. You may be wondering why I haven’t put the most popular Advent carol, “O come, O come, Emmanuel” down until this Sunday, and it’s really because it fits the themes of the later part of the season. In fact, the text of the hymn paraphrases the 7 great “O” antiphons, which have been sung as the antiphon to the Magnificat at Vespers on the 7 days leading up to Christmas for at least the last 1200 years or so. Though various uses of the Roman Rite (like the famous Sarum Use used at Salisbury Cathedral) had different numbers of antiphons, the number was standardized at 7 at the Council of Trent. “O come, O come, Emmanuel” puts all 7 of these antiphons together with a tuneful melody, compelling enough that it even gets some play in the secular world. The text draws on various prophecies of the Messiah found in the old testament, using imagery such as the “Key of David,” “Wisdom from on high,” and other things found in those prophecies.\n\n​\n\nMuch of the rest of the music is in honor of Mary, who the texts for this Sunday seem to focus on. The sequence hymn is a general ode to her which comes from 19th Century England, in the renewed enthusiasm for Marian devotion brought on by the Oxford Movement. “The angel Gabriel” is another eminently recognizable Basque carol for the Annunciation which also has some play even on non-religious holiday playlists, telling the story of the Angel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she will bear Jesus, and the final verse is a paraphrase of Mary’s song in response, the Magnificat.\n\n​\n\nAnd speaking of parallels to Old Testament prophecies, the final hymn is our first Christmas Carol of the year, building on imagery in Isaiah’s prophecy: “A shoot shall come out of the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.” “Lo, how a Rose e’er blooming” is an old carol of German origin. The exact author of the text and tune are unknown, except that Michael Praetorius harmonized the tune. The “rose” in question is, of course, Jesus, but the choir will sing of another rose at the offertory: Jesus’s mother, Mary. “Ther is no rose of swych virtu” comes from the early 15th Century in England (probably around 1420), a country with a great deal of devotion to Mary right up until the Reformation. It tells the story of the nativity through the lens of an ode to Mary. As was common in those days, the text is macaronic, meaning it switches between Middle English and Latin (those who were educated in those days, in England and the rest of Europe, would have been able to speak Latin, since it was the “lingua franca” of Europe through the 19th Century). Luckily, the English text is similar enough to modern English that it’s understandable to us, which isn’t always the case with Middle English!\n\n​\n\nAnd speaking of England and its pre-reformation devotion to Mary, we’ll hear one of the greatest Marian motets from the English Renaissance: a setting of Ave Maria by Robert Parsons. The text comes directly from Luke, in which it’s said both by the Angel Gabriel and by Mary’s sister, Elizabeth, the latter of which we’ll hear as part of the gospel reading. The Ave Maria text is, of course, very recognizable now, but the latter part of the ubiquitous litany (Sancta Maria, mater Dei etc) is a later addition, which is probably why it’s not found in this setting. Not much is known about its composer, except that Parsons was a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, navigated the English Reformation just as Byrd and Tallis did, and was possibly a friend and mentor to Byrd. “Ave Maria,” a 5-part motet, is his best known work.\n\n​\n\nWe’ll hear again from Dieterich Buxtehude before the Eucharist this Sunday, but instead of a quiet chorale prelude, we’ll hear his showmanship really come to the forefront in his organ setting of the Magnificat (the song of Mary, which we’ll hear multiple times today). It was common practice to improvise on various liturgical texts in the Catholic Church (and still is in a few places, notably France), and though Buxtehude wasn’t Catholic, he may have found this practice intriguing. His setting of the Magnificat is, as one would expect, in several very short, contrasting sections, each exploring a verse of the text. After the service, we’ll hear from one of the great 19th Century German composers, Johannes Brahms. Though he’s best known for his symphonic and chamber music, Brahms did play the organ, and wrote a handful of pieces for the instrument, mostly in his youth. However, on his deathbed, Brahms decided to go back to the organ, and write a set of eleven chorale preludes on well-known Lutheran chorales. Es ist ein Ros entsprungen is included in this set, and is a beautiful setting of the well-known German Christmas Carol.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday December 12th. ADVENT 3\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Es ist das Heil uns kommen her – Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637-1707)\n\nOpening Hymn: 66 “Come, thou long-expected Jesus” (Stuttgart)\n\nSequence Hymn: 76 “On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry” (Winchester New)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Rejoice in the Lord alway – Anonymous, 16th Cent.\n\nOffertory Hymn: 68 “Rejoice, rejoice believers” (Llangloffan)\n\nCommunion Anthem: O thou the central orb – Charles Wood (1866-1926)\n\nFinal Hymn: 436 “Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates” (Truro)\n\nPostlude: Magnificat I from 15 Pieces – Marcel Dupré (1886-1971)\n\n​\n\nThe Third Sunday of Advent is traditionally a bit of a relaxation of the penitence of the season, though that penitence is not as prevalent today (though we still do sing the Kyrie Eleison in place of the Gloria in excelsis at the beginning of the Eucharist). It’s often called “Gaudete” Sunday, which is Latin for “Rejoice,” which comes from the first word of the traditional Introit for the day. Traditions for penitential seasons have varied through the years, but in Western Christianity, churches would be decorated plainly, use of the organ was limited during worship, and violet vestments were used. On Gaudete Sunday, the organ would be allowed to play freely, and rose vestments are often used, a shade lighter than the penitential violet (though at All Saints we use blue throughout the season, a tradition which arose in parts of Anglicanism recently). We will hear the words of that Introit twice on Sunday; once in the Epistle reading from Paul’s Letter to the Philippians, and once as the Offertory Anthem.\n\n​\n\n“Rejoice in the Lord alway” was, for a long time, attributed to John Redford, but its composer is unknown and it seems unlikely, but not impossible, that Redford wrote it. Though the work may have existed prior to its first known manuscript, the earliest evidence we have of it is from the Mulliner Book, a collection of keyboard pieces compiled by Thomas Mulliner sometime in the mid-16th Century. The attribution to Redford comes from the fact that many other works in the book are attributed to him (in which case it would seem strange that this wouldn’t be). Titled “Rejoice in the Lord Alway,” it’s thought that this piece is a transcription of a choral work, something which was common in those days, so it has since been reconstructed with the text of the Introit for the Third Sunday in Advent. Though its origins remain a mystery, it’s a staple of Renaissance choral music and will be heard in many churches around the world on Sunday. It should be noted that music was seen as less of a personal statement in those days, so works without attribution were common (or, as the quip goes, “that Anonymous guy really wrote a lot of stuff!”).\n\n​\n\nThe text for “O thou the central orb” is interesting in that it was written to fit an extant piece of choral music, rather than the other way around as usual. In 1873, Frederick Ouseley published a collection of works by late Renaissance composer Orlando Gibbons, who was especially famous for his verse anthems (his most famous one, “This is the record of John,” is especially appropriate for this Sunday but we don’t have enough singers to do it). Ouseley asked poet Henry Ramsden Bramley to write a new liturgical text for Gibbons’ “O all true faithful hearts,” a verse anthem from 1619 which is in thanksgiving for King James’s recovery from an illness. Bramley came up with an Advent text, which was later set by Wood in typical sweeping, early 20th Century Cathedral anthem style.\n\n​\n\nThe hymns on Sunday are another round of classic Advent favorites. The opening, “Come thou long-expected Jesus” sets a hymn by Charles Wesley to a simple, but sturdy, early-18th Century German tune. Since the gospel text on Sunday is the story of John the Baptist preaching to the crowds, the sequence hymn will, naturally, be the classic hymn about this event: “On Jordan’s bank!” This text about John is a translation of a Latin hymn by 18th Century French poet, Charles Coffin. The tune is an old German tune adopted and adapted by William Havergal (“Winchester New” is distinct from “Winchester Old,” often used for the Christmas carol, “While shepherds watched their flocks by night”). The other two hymns are hymns of joyful anticipation (despite one being in a minor key!).\n\n​\n\nAnd finally, we have the organ music. Though Dieterich Buxtehude is best known for his flamboyant and virtuosic “free” organ works, he was still a church organist and wrote some more practical music, including many chorale preludes (which, in those days, were likely used to introduce the chorale for the congregation). “Es ist das Heil uns kommen her” is one such piece, a quiet chorale prelude on a tune that’s largely not sung these days, but which roughly translates to “Salvation now has come for all.” The postlude is from Dupré’s collection of transcribed organ improvisations for a service of Vespers of Our Lady, based on works he improvised while filling in for Louis Vierne at Notre Dame in Paris. The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Claude Johnson, was greatly impressed by Dupré’s work and commissioned the young organist to write down his improvisations, resulting in this piece. On Sunday, we’ll hear the first of the set of pieces on the Magnificat, foreshadowing the story of the Annunciation we’ll hear on the following Sunday. This setting sits high in the flutes of the organ, giving it an ethereal feel.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday December 5th ADVENT 2\n\n​\n\nPrelude: from the Orgelbüchlein: - J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\nNun komm, der Heiden Heiland\n\nGottes Sohn ist kommen\n\nOpening Hymn: 65 “Prepare the way, O Zion” (Bereden väg för Herran)\n\nSequence Hymn: 67 “Comfort, comfort ye my people” (Psalm 42)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Never weather-beaten sail – Charles Wood (1866-1926)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 72 “Hark the glad sound!” (Richmond)\n\nCommunion Anthem: E’en so, Lord Jesus, quickly come – Paul Manz\n\nFinal Hymn: 61 “Sleepers wake! A voice astounds us” (Wachet auf)\n\nPostlude: Wachet auf! Ruft uns die Stimme – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nIn the Gospel reading for Sunday, John the Baptist recites part of Isaiah’s foretelling of the Messiah. The passage about preparing the way of the Lord has been set to music many times, from the recitative and aria that open Handel’s oratorio (Comfort ye and Every valley), The Messiah, to two of the hymns we will sing on Sunday.\n\n​\n\nThe first of these hymns comes from Sweden. The text, a paraphrase and embellishment of Isaiah’s exhortation, is by Frans Franzen, a Bishop in the Church of Sweden (which is a Lutheran church). The tune, “Bereden Väg för Herran,” comes from a 17th Century Swedish psalter. The Sequence Hymn on Sunday is another embellishment of this exhortation, this time from Germany. The text was written by 17th Century German Lutheran pastor, Johann Olearius, and translated by Catherine Winkworth, the 19th Century Englishwoman who is known for her many excellent translations of German hymns. The tune, known as “Psalm 42” or “Genevan 42,” originally comes from a mid-16th Century Genevan psalter, written by Louis Bourgeois and later adapted by Claude Goudimel. As the name would suggest, it was originally written for Psalm 42, though I have a hard time imagining this energetic tune paired with the lament that is that psalm!\n\n​\n\nThe other two hymns are also favorites for Advent. “Hark the glad sound” came from one of the few places English hymns could come from in the 18th Century: the non-conformists (since hymn singing was banned in the Church of England at the time). Philip Doddridge, a prominent non-conformist minister in Northhampton, wrote the text. The tune, “Richmond,” (named for a person, not the county name for the smallest borough of our city), appeared in the late 18th Century, written by a Church of England clergyman who was also around Northhampton for a time. However, I think that’s coincidence; “Richmond” was intended as a metrical psalm tune and is used for several texts (I’ve even seen it paired with “Joy to the world!”). The other is a classic Lutheran chorale, made most famous by Bach’s adaptations in his cantata of the same name. Both the text and tune of Wachet auf! Ruft uns die Stimme are by Philipp Nicolai, a 16th Century Lutheran minister who certainly didn’t shy away from challenges. He fled from Spanish occupation early in his life, only to minister to plague-stricken towns and fiercely debate with Calvinists over doctrine. Unfortunately, though Catherine Winkworth’s translation of the text is excellent and is the translation found in The Hymnal 1940, the editors of The Hymnal 1982 opted to use a newer, if somewhat clunkier, translation by Carl Daw, Jr.\n\n​\n\nThe organ music on Sunday is, again, a set of chorale preludes. The postlude is a well-known piece based on the tune of the final Hymn, “Wachet Auf,” with an obbligato melody which is just as well-known as the hymn itself! Originally written for Bach’s Cantata on “Wachet Auf” (BWV 140) with tenors, violins, and basso continuo in mind, this cantata movement was arranged by Bach himself for the organ. The organ version was published in a collection known as the “Schübler Chorales,” named for the publisher of the collection. It contains 6 chorale preludes, 5 of which are arrangements of movements from Cantatas (and perhaps the sixth is an arrangement from a Cantata that was lost). The other two chorale preludes, also on well-known Advent chorales, are short ones from the Orgelbüchlein, which Bach intended to be a collection of short chorale preludes for the entire church year, primarily as a teaching tool.\n\n​\n\n“Never weather-beaten sail” was written by Thomas Campion, a poet, composer, and physician who lived in Elizabethan England. The text is really a plea for God’s presence while on the sea, but the litany of “O come quickly” means it lends itself well as an Advent text. Though Campion wrote his own musical setting of the text (a lute song), we will do a setting by turn-of-the-century composer Charles Wood, for organ and choir. Wood was an Irish composer who succeeded his mentor, fellow Irish composer Charles Villiers Stanford, as a professor at the University of Cambridge.\n\n​\n\nThe other choral piece heard on Sunday is a classic of American sacred music. Born in Cleveland, Paul Manz became a celebrated organ recitalist, choir director, and composer, eventually settling in Minnesota, where he directed the music at Mt. Olive Lutheran Church in Minneapolis and taught at Concordia College in St. Paul. He wrote his most famous piece, the choral anthem E’en so Lord Jesus, in 1953 while his 3-year-old son was critically ill. As the story goes, he drafted the piece while sitting at his son’s bedside, using a text which his wife, Ruth, adapted from Revelation. Happily, his son did recover.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday November 28th ADVENT 1\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\nOpening Hymn: 59 “Hark! a thrilling voice is sounding” (Merton)\n\nSequence Hymn: 54 “Savior of the nations, come” (Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes – Thomas Attwood (1765-1838)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 324 “Let all mortal flesh keep silence” (Picardy)\n\nCommunion Anthem: Audivi vocem – Thomas Tallis (c. 1505-1585)\n\nFinal Hymn: 57 “Lo, he comes with clouds descending” (Helmsley)\n\nPostlude: Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nIt's the beginning of a new church year and the beginning of my favorite liturgical season, Advent! The music for Advent mirrors the lectionary in its looking forward to when Jesus will come again, and in recalling the prophecies foretelling the Messiah. Later in the season, the theme shifts more toward looking forward to Christmas and the story leading up to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. This first Sunday, however, is rife with imagery of Jesus coming again to great fanfare.\n\n​\n\nBoth the organ prelude and postlude are based on the same German chorale tune (which is the Sequence Hymn this Sunday), though offer two quite different takes on it. Both the text and tune to “Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland” were likely written by Martin Luther, and both adapt the ancient Latin hymn by St. Ambrose, “Veni redemptor gentium” (which is also in our Hymnal at number 55 – if you can read music, it may be worthwhile to compare the two!). Luther treated many plainchant hymns like this (another example is the Easter chorale, “Christ ist erstanden,” based on the Latin sequence for Easter Day, “Victimae Paschali laudes”) and wrote many original tunes. Contrary to common belief, few, if any, Lutheran Chorale tunes are adaptations of popular songs of the day, and the quote, “Why should the devil have all the good tunes” is probably attributable to one of a few 19th Century Englishmen, not Martin Luther. The hymn’s text is a petition for Jesus to come again while summarizing his first time on earth.\n\n​\n\nThe two chorale preludes on this tune which will be heard on Sunday are two of the three from the collection known as the “Leipzig” or “Great 18” chorale preludes. Though compiled later in Bach’s life while he worked as the “Thomaskantor” in Leipzig, Bach probably wrote these preludes while in Weimar, where he wrote the bulk of his organ works. The collection contains longer chorale preludes than collections like the Orgelbüchlein do. The first of the preludes on “Nun komm,” which will be Sunday’s prelude, heavily ornaments the tune over an accompaniment which evokes an air of mystery. The third, which will be Sunday’s postlude, plays the tune plainly in the pedal while a fiery toccata is played in the manuals.\n\n​\n\nThe other hymns include two sturdy English tunes and one well-known French tune. “Hark! a thrilling voice is sounding” is a translation of an old Latin hymn which probably originates around the 10th Century, and the first verse especially mirrors the Collect for Sunday. The tune is by William Henry Monk, the editor of the first few editions of Hymns Ancient and Modern, and was written for Edward Caswall’s translation of the text for the first edition of the hymnal. “Lo, he comes with clouds descending,” which, paired with the tune “Helmsley,” is among my very favorite hymns, comes from Charles Wesley, one of the famous Wesleys associated with the foundation of Methodism (though the one who remained loyal to the Church of England and disapproved of John Wesley’s ordinations which led to the split from the Church of England). Wesley paired the text with the tune, Helmsley, whose authorship is somewhat murky; Wesley attributed it to Thomas Olivers, though it may have either been a composition for the stage or a tune taken from a collection of hymn tunes sung at a hospital. Whoever wrote it, though, wrote a brilliant, soaring tune which pairs perfectly with the text.\n\n​\n\n“Let all mortal flesh keep silence” comes from the Syrian Liturgy of St. James. Gerard Moultrie wrote the text as we know it as a paraphrase of a “cherubic hymn,” or a hymn chanted by the Celebrant as the bread and wine are brought to the altar in that Liturgy. Today, it’s used both as an Advent hymn and a general Eucharistic hymn, and this Sunday we can use it as both (since it will be sung as the Altar is prepared during the offertory)! The tune, Picardy, comes from a 17th Century French carol, originally used for a text beginning “Jésus-Christ s’habille en pauvre” (poetically, Jesus came in garment lowly). The tune was adapted and paired with Moultrie’s text by Ralph Vaughan Williams for The English Hymnal.\n\n​\n\nThough the “classical” music canon has largely ignored England between the death of Henry Purcell in the late 17th Century and the flourishing of Edward Elgar in the late 19th (to the point that the Germans who came up with the idea of a canon in the first place derisively referred to England as “Das Land ohne Musik” or “the land without music”), there were indeed many skilled composers in England during that period. Not only did many well-known composers like Handel, Mendelssohn, and Haydn travel to England frequently or reside there for a time, there were plenty of home-grown composers as well. Thomas Attwood may be the most prominent one from the late 18th Century. As a young man, he impressed the Prince of Wales (who would later become King George IV) so much that the Prince funded Attwood’s studies in Naples and Vienna. In Vienna, Attwood would become a favored pupil of none other than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Upon his return to England, he worked for a few prominent noble courts and taught at the newly formed Royal Academy of Music and joined the Royal Philharmonic Society. His style is quite typical of the late 18th Century “classical” style, and we can certainly see shades of Mozart in the Offertory Anthem on Sunday, “Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,” a setting of a portion of Psalm 119.\n\n​\n\nA composer more accepted in the canon (to the extent that it even goes back to the Renaissance) is the Tudor-era composer, Thomas Tallis. Tallis was among the favored composers of the royal family during his career, and managed to navigate the English Reformation relatively unscathed, writing music for various forms of the English church as needed. “Audivi vocem” is from the more Catholic end of things; it’s technically a text for All Saints Day (since it’s the responsory for one of the lessons at Matins for that feast), but works extremely well for Advent as well. The text is all about anticipation, beseeching the “wisest virgins” to fill their lamps with oil and wait for the bridegroom.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday November 21st\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Prelude in D Major – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\nOpening Hymn: 450 “All hail the power of Jesus’ Name” (Coronation)\n\nSequence Hymn: 495 “Hail, thou once despised Jesus” (In Babilone)\n\nOffertory Anthem: O God, the King of glory – Henry Purcell (1659-1695)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 483 “The head that once was crowned with thorns” (St. Magnus)\n\nCommunion Anthem: O Rex gloriae – William Byrd (c.1540-1623)\n\nFinal Hymn: 494 “Crown him with many crowns” (Diademata)\n\nPostlude: Fugue in D Major – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nIn modern rites, the last Sunday before Advent is the celebration of the Feast of Christ the King. This being a relatively new feast day (first instituted in 1925 by Pope Pius XI, under the backdrop of rising nationalism and secularism and not widely adopted by Anglicans until the 1970’s), there isn’t much music written specifically for it. However, the themes of the kingship of Christ are all over the texts for the feast of the Ascension, so much of the wealth of music for that feast can do double duty (and indeed, both anthems on Sunday were written for the Ascension).\n\n​\n\nThe choral music on Sunday is from two of the best-known English composers in history. Many consider Henry Purcell to be the greatest composer of the baroque period in England, and, of course, William Byrd was a master of Renaissance polyphony. Purcell’s anthem, “O God, the king of glory” sets the collect for the Sunday after the Ascension in the Book of Common Prayer, which survived the great Collect reshuffling of the 1970’s and remains in the current BCP! Byrd’s anthem has a similar text, but it’s taken from the Divine Office for the Ascension (specifically the Antiphon for the Magnificat at 2nd Vespers of the feast) rather than the Book of Common Prayer. Byrd remained a devout Catholic despite the religious upheaval which was already under way in England when he was born, and despite the suspicion the English government had for Catholicism. However, he did enjoy a place of privilege, being a prominent composer and one of Queen Elizabeth I’s favorite composers. This only got him so far, though; after the Papal Bull, Regnans in Excelsis by Pope Pius V in 1570, which declared Elizabeth an illegitimate monarch and absolved her subjects of loyalty to her, Byrd began to be viewed with suspicion, being barred from his post at the Chapel Royal for a time, and having his movements restricted. Though he wrote some music for use in the Anglican Church, a lot of his choral music is very Catholic. “O Rex gloriae” is from a late collection of his titled Gradualia, which is a massive collection of motets in two volumes which sets texts from the Catholic Mass and Office. These are excellent examples of Byrd’s polyphony, though, and the 5 voice “O Rex gloriae” is no exception.\n\n​\n\nThe hymns, appropriately, all speak of the reign of Jesus. The hymns sung to “Coronation” and “Diademata” are, of course, standards for the day. “All hail the power of Jesus’ name” was written in the late 18th Century by Edward Perronet, a friend of the Wesley brothers, and is known to a few different tunes, but best known to us to Oliver Holden’s tune, “Coronation,” composed a couple decades after the text. “Crown him with many crowns” is a bit later, with both text and tune written in the mid-19th Century by Matthew Bridges and George Elvey, respectively. The pair was first published in the 1868 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern and has remained popular since.\n\n​\n\nThe other two hymns are more about the juxtaposition of Jesus’s reign with the shame and suffering he went through at the crucifixion. “Hail, thou once despised Jesus” comes from early 18th Century England, and in our hymnal is paired with a traditional Dutch tune called “In Babilone.” “The head that once was crowned with thorns” is a common choice for the Ascension, a text written by an Irish lawyer who lived in the 19th Century. The tune, “St. Magnus,” was first seen in 1707 in Henry Playford’s book, Divine Companion, without attribution. It’s thought to be by Jeremiah Clarke, a prominent English organist who committed suicide, which may be why the tune was not attributed to him at first. The name, “St. Magnus,” is for the Church of St. Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge, which today is a prominent Anglo-Catholic parish.\n\n​\n\nBach’s Prelude and Fugue in D Major remains among his best-loved “free” organ works, written in the 1710’s while Bach worked in Weimar (as much of his organ music was). It’s most notable for its, frankly, ridiculous fugue subject (which nonetheless is woven into a truly great fugue), but the prelude is also great. It opens with typical North German flair, with ascending pedal scales and manual flourishes, before moving to a spritely “alla breve” section. It ends with a crash, though, in a cataclysmic coda prominently featured as the musical backdrop to the famous Baptism scene in the 1972 film, The Godfather.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday November 14th\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Lebhaft from Sonata I – Paul Hindemith (1895-1963)\n\nOpening Hymn: 632 “O Christ, the word incarnate” (Munich)\n\nSequence Hymn: 594 “God of grace and God of glory” (Cwm Rhondda)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Locus Iste – Anton Bruckner (1824-1896)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 619 “Sing alleluia forth in duteous praise” (Martins)\n\nCommunion Anthem: And I saw a new heaven – Edgar Bainton (1880-1956)\n\nFinal Hymn: 579 “Almighty Father, strong to save” (Melita)\n\nPostlude: Phantasie, Frei and Ruhig Bewegt from Sonata I – Paul Hindemith (1895-1963)\n\nSome of the music for Sunday continues the theme of All Saints Day, which can still be seen in the readings for the day. Notably, one of the hymns talks about the choirs of angels and saints in heaven praising God, definitely a theme of All Saints Day, and the other talks about what happens when this world passes away.\n\nBut first, we have the organ music. Paul Hindemith is known today as a musical polymath with very strong opinions, and who devised a method of teaching musicianship which frustrates music students to this day. He was a skilled violinist as a child, excelled in the conservatory, and went on to make his living early in his career by playing for dance bands, shades of which can be seen in his music. As his career progressed, he became known both as an educator (he taught at many prestigious institutions, including a stint at Yale) for a sort of neo-baroque style of composition and for using instruments such as the viola d’amore, previously unheard of in the modern era. He learned to play just about every major instrument and strove to write a piece for all of them. By the 1930’s his relationship with his homeland of Germany was fraying as the Third Reich rose to power. His wife was Jewish, for one thing, and the Nazi Party seemed to oscillate between praising Hindemith’s music and condemning it as degenerate (Goebbels, especially, did not like it). We can’t blame him, then, for getting out of dodge, first moving to Turkey, then moving to Switzerland, all the while making multiple tours of the United States. It was during one of these tours in 1937 that he wrote the first two of his three sonatas for organ, which are his only solo organ works. The first comes in two movements, though the second of those movements is split into three distinct parts. As the prelude, we’ll hear the lengthy first movement, which pads a typical classical-style Sonata Allegro form with several bits of transitional material. However, the two themes, an angular, folksy theme resembling an ornamented chorale, and a relentless stepwise theme, are quite compelling and make for an interesting piece of music! As the postlude, we’ll hear two parts of the three-part second movement (the first part doesn’t fit well in a postlude outside Lent); the “Phantasie, Frei” section clearly draws inspiration from Buxtehude, Bruhns, and other composers of the North German “stilus phantasticus,” with its virtuosic runs and sudden changes in texture, though through a highly dissonant 20th Century lens. The “ruhig bewegt” section is a definite shift in gears, more like a folksy rondo.\n\n​\n\nAnton Bruckner may be known for his grand orchestral works, but he was also an organist and began his career working for the church. As such, he wrote many pieces of choral music, which are much more digestible lengths than his symphonies. “Locus iste,” a setting of the traditional Gradual at Masses for the Dedication of a Church in the old Catholic rite, might be his best-known choral piece. The text, which talks about the house of God fits especially well with the epistle for Sunday. “And I saw a new heaven” sets a passage from Revelation, read on All Saints Day this year, and is by an English composer who eventually emigrated to Australia to take charge of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. “And I saw a new heaven” is by far Bainton’s best-known work, and soon after its publication in 1928, became a mainstay in the repertoire of many British Choirs, including at the Three Choirs Festival.\n\n​\n\nThe four hymns on Sunday are mostly commonly sung tunes, with perhaps one exception. “Sing alleluia forth in duteous praise” is a translation of a very old Latin hymn (estimated anywhere from the 5th-8th century AD) about the choirs of heaven praising God. The tune, Martins, is by an English organist and educator, Percy Buck. The first hymn, though not a commonly sung text in my experience (though a text which fits quite well with the collect of the day), should be a familiar tune; it’s an old Lutheran tune, first seen in the 1693 Neuvermehrtes Gesangbuch, which was adapted by Felix Mendelssohn for use in his most famous oratorio, Elijah. The text is by William Walsham How, who also wrote “For all the saints,” which we sang last week. The sequence hymn is a warhorse to a sturdy Welsh tune. The final hymn is in honor of Veterans’ Day, which is on Thursday the 11th; it’s a thoroughly English hymn, with a text by William Whiting and a tune by John Bacchus Dykes, but it’s commonly known in the United States as the “Navy Hymn.” Whiting’s text, inspired by his experience in a storm on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea, ask for God’s protection for seafarers, and a tradition arose in 1879 of concluding services in the chapel of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland with this hymn.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday November 7th\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Langsam from Six Fugues on BACH – Robert Schumann (1810-1856)\n\nOpening Hymn: 286 “Who are these like stars appearing” (Zeuch mich, zeuch mich)\n\nSequence Hymn: 623 “O what their joy and their glory must be” (O quanta qualia)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Angeli, archangeli – Andrea Gabrieli (c.1532-1585)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 293 “I sing a song of the saints of God” (Grand Isle)\n\nCommunion Anthem: O quam gloriosum – T.L. de Victoria (c.1548-1611)\n\nFinal Hymn: 287 “For all the saints” (Sine Nomine)\n\nPostlude: Praeludium in G Major – Nicolaus Bruhns (1665-1697)\n\n​\n\nThis is a special Sunday at All Saints. Not only will we be celebrating All Saints Day, our Patronal Festival, but this will be the first “normal” musical Sunday at All Saints since March 8, 2020, with four hymns and a choir! We will return to offering two choral anthems and doing the psalm to Anglican Chant.\n\n​\n\nThe anthems are by familiar names for anyone versed in Renaissance music. Though perhaps not as famous as his nephew, Giovanni, Andrea Gabrieli might be the first of a long line of highly influential Venetian composers (which includes Claudio Monteverdi and Antonio Vivaldi) and is considered the father of the Venetian school of polychoral polyphony. His reach extended beyond Venice as well; during a trip to modern-day Germany, he met a more famous Renaissance composer, Orlande de Lassus, and the two exchanged ideas. He also became famous as a teacher, notably teaching Hans Leo Hassler, perhaps the most influential German renaissance composer. “Angeli, archangeli” is a spritely motet for All Saints Day, which passes a simple, 2-3 note motive around the four voices. The text is taken from the antiphon for the Magnificat for one of the Vespers services for All Saints, and asks angels, archangels, and all categories of Saints to pray for us.\n\n​\n\nThe other anthem, more well-known by far, sets the other Magnificat antiphon for All Saints. Tomás Luis de Victoria is among the “big 3” of the Renaissance composers associated with the so-called “Counter-Reformation,” along with Orlande de Lassus and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Victoria spent most of his life in his native Spain, but did go to Rome as a young man to study, and became involved in the musical goings-on there. His compositional style is much more dramatic than Gabrieli’s, and “O quam gloriosum” certainly starts dramatically, with a slow build in the first line. Another obvious moment of text painting is the ecstatic ascending scales in all four voices on the word “gaudent” (meaning “rejoice”).\n\n​\n\nAll but one of the hymns on Sunday are explicitly for All Saints Day. We will enter on the sturdy German tune accompanying “Who are these like stars appearing,” which is a translation by Frances Elizabeth Cox (among the best known translators of German hymns in the 19th Century) of an early 18th Century German text by Heinrich Schenck. The sequence hymn, which is related to the theme of the second reading, comes from medieval France, written by the famous philosopher Peter Abelard, who is perhaps most famous for his tragic love affair with Héloise d’Argenteuil. The text was translated by the great 19th Century translator of Latin texts, John Mason Neale, and set to a tune from a 17th Century French “antiphoner.”\n\n​\n\nThe other two hymns are more well-known. “I sing a song of the saints of God” is a hymn intended for children, written by and Englishwoman named Lesbia Scott. It’s likely that Scott wrote the hymn to sing to her own children when she was a young mother. Though the hymn never caught on in the UK, it became quite popular in the United States, thanks in part to the tune by John Henry Hopkins III (no relation to me, as far as I know). This John Henry Hopkins is one of three from the same family who were notable in Anglican circles, beginning with John Henry Hopkins, who became the Eighth Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church, and John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (III’s uncle), an Episcopal Priest who wrote the famous tune for “We three kings of Orient are.” And, of course, we end with the famous “For all the saints,” to Ralph Vaughan Williams’s “Sine Nomine.” The text is by 19th Century English Bishop, William Walsham How, known for his charity in the London Slums and for his alignment with the Oxford Movement. The tune, by great early-20th Century English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, was written for The English Hymnal in 1906, which Vaughan Williams edited. The tune name, “Sine Nomine,” translates to “without a name,” perhaps referring to those Saints whose names we don’t know.\n\n​\n\nAnd finally, we have the organ music. We’ve heard a bunch of North German Baroque music over the last few weeks, including Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, which was certainly heavily influenced by North German music. This week, we’ll continue the trend with a piece by Nicolaus Bruhns, who was flashy even by the already flashy standards of the North German school. Bruhns was born in Denmark but moved to Lübeck as a teenager to study violin and gamba with his uncle, and organ and composition with the great Dieterich Buxtehude. He then moved to Copenhagen and became well-known as an organist and violinist (and would supposedly play the violin while accompanying himself on the organ pedals sometimes), but his very accomplished life was cut short when he died at the age of 31. His Praeludium in G does not hold back on the virtuosity and, for lack of a better word, showiness. The other organ work is by the famous 19th Century composer and journalist, Robert Schumann, who is equally known for his compositions and for his influence on the music world at the time with his quarterly journal, Neue Zeitschrift für Musik. Schumann struggled greatly with mental illness later in life, eventually dying in an asylum. One way he dealt with this in the 1940’s was to study counterpoint intensely, and he also bought a pedal piano (a piano with an organ-style pedalboard which was popular as a practice instrument at the time) around the same time. He wrote two sets of contrapuntal studies for this instrument, and then a set of six fugues on Bach’s name (spelled musically as B-flat, A, C, B-natural, since in German nomenclature B refers to B-flat and H refers to B-natural) without specifying instrumentation. We’ll hear the first of those six fugues on Sunday, a long, slow, and dramatic crescendo.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday October 31st\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Toccata in D Minor – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\nSequence Hymn: 665 “All my hope on God is founded” (Michael)\n\nOffertory Anthem: God be in my head – H. Walford Davies (1869-1941)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 688 “A mighty fortress is our God” (Ein feste Burg)\n\nCommunion Anthem: God shall wipe away all tears – Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900)\n\nPostlude: Fugue in D Minor – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nYes, I had to. Since this Sunday falls on Halloween, some spooky organ music is in order. There’s plenty to choose from, of course, but on a North German Baroque-style organ like the one we have, the famous Toccata and Fugue in D Minor is the clear answer. This is one of the most popular examples of the “Stilus Phantasticus” in the North German baroque era there is. Bach (if, indeed, Bach did write this piece – there’s some debate among experts as to whether it’s really a Bach work) likely wrote this piece as a very young man, possibly as a teenager. It later gained in popularity when performing Bach’s music became commonplace in the 19th Century (thanks in no small part to Felix Mendelssohn), but really exploded in the popular imagination after 1940. What happened in 1940, you may ask? Well, that’s the year Walt Disney’s Fantasia debuted, which opened with an orchestral arrangement of the Toccata and Fugue by Leopold Stokowski. Stokowski began his career as an organist, serving as Organist and Choirmaster at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church here in New York (now at Park Avenue between 50th and 51st, but then was still in its old building at 43rd and Madison) before he went to Europe for further conducting study. Naturally, he enjoyed arranging organ works for orchestra, and arranged a few Bach works. Of course, the Toccata and Fugue, especially the commanding opening of the Toccata, has deep associations with the horror genre now. I’m not sure how that came about, though it may have something to do with theater organs in silent movie houses; perhaps organists often played it for horror movies.\n\n​\n\nThe vocal solos on Sunday are by two Englishmen. H. Walford Davies played a major role in the early days of broadcast radio; he was the musical advisor to the British Broadcasting Corporation (aka the BBC) and became famous for musical talks he did on the radio through the 20’s and 30’s. He was also notable as a composer, of course, and the piece we’ll hear on Sunday is a short setting of the famous text from the 15th Century Sarum Primer (a collection of prayers from Salisbury Cathedral, often nicknamed Sarum). The other is a setting of texts from Revelation by Sir Arthur Sullivan, who is noted for his own classical music, some exceedingly campy hymns (including the tune to the controversial “Onward, Christian soldiers”), and for being half of a famous theatrical collaboration with W.S. Gilbert, collectively known as Gilbert and Sullivan, whose operettas are still beloved and widely performed.\n\n​\n\nAside from Halloween, October 31 is the day when Lutherans commemorate the reformation. October 31 is ostensibly the day Martin Luther nailed the 95 Theses, a list of complaints about the way the Catholic Church operated, to the door of the Schlosskirche in Wittenberg (which was dedicated to All Saints). Of course, this is somewhat apocryphal since Luther may not have even been in Wittenberg at the time. However, in commemoration of that, we will sing one of Luther’s most famous chorales, “Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott” (translated in English as “A mighty fortress is our God”). The sturdy tune accompanies a text about seeking refuge in God against the evils of the world. The other hymn is one of hope amid adversity. The tune, Michael, is named for the composer’s (Herbert Howells) son, who died of polio in 1935 at age nine. The text translates a hymn about trust in God by Joachim Neander, an 18th Century German poet, and though it had been published a few years prior to Michael’s death, was renamed for Michael in 1936. Howells honored his son in several other ways; A Sequence for St. Michael and Take him, earth, for cherishing are two anthems in Michael’s honor. Howells also sketched out his unpublished Hymnus Paradisi, an expanded version of his unconventional Requiem, in the three years following his son’s death.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday October 24th\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Andante Religioso from Sonata IV – Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847)\n\nSequence Hymn: 488 “Be thou my vision” (Slane)\n\nOffertory Anthem: Sheep may safely graze – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 617 “Eternal ruler of the ceaseless round” (Song I)\n\nCommunion Anthem: Steal Away – arr. Harry Burleigh (1866-1949)\n\nPostlude: Praeludium in C – Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637-1707)\n\n​\n\nThe organ music this week returns to the North German great of the middle baroque, Dieterich Buxtehude. The Praeludium in C, often called the Prelude, Fugue, and Chaconne, is among his more famous works and demonstrates the “Stilus Phantasticus” as it applies to the organ well. It begins with a declamatory pedal solo, as if to get the listener’s attention, with a few other virtuosic flourishes, before moving to a short fugal section. After a more extensive and restrained interlude, we hear a spritely fugal section which eventually gives way to a quick ground bass (referred to as a chaconne), in which the music is played over a repeating bass line. The piece abounds with flamboyant passagework, sudden stops, starts, and transitions, and improvisatory elements typical of the North German style. Buxtehude, presiding from the organ at the Marienkirche in the North German free city of Lübeck, was a particular master of the style. We have an extensive collection of organ music from him, and he doubtless improvised much more music. As I mentioned last week, a young Bach traveled over 200 miles each way on foot to hear and presumably study with the master in 1705 and was away from home for months, much to the annoyance of his employers in Arnstadt (who granted him 4 weeks off for the journey, but Bach was gone around 4 months)! Some theorize that Bach was asked if he’d like to succeed the aging Buxtehude, but that ultimately didn’t pan out. One possible reason was the custom that the organist at the Marienkirche would marry his predecessor’s daughter (Buxtehude married Anna Margarethe Tunder, daughter of his predecessor Franz Tunder, when he took the job in 1668) and Bach would marry his first wife, Maria Barbara, the next year, and may have already been engaged. There are also some mean-spirited theories about the appearance of Buxtehude’s eldest daughter (both Handel and Johann Mattheson were offered the job with the stipulation that they marry her and turned it down), but no portraits of her exist.\n\n​\n\nThe other organ work is from the 19th Century, by the short-lived prodigy, Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was born to a wealthy Jewish family (though not religious), but was baptized as a Christian in childhood, possibly for political reasons. He and his sister, Fanny, received excellent musical training and Felix began publishing chamber music at age 13 (some of Fanny’s early works were also published under his name). He would go on to be an influential composer and conductor, and to revive public interest in the works of J.S. Bach (whose music was far from forgotten, as many composers studied it, but public performances of it were rare). His six organ sonatas were commissioned by an English publisher as a “set of voluntaries” which Mendelssohn decided to expand to sonatas. The fourth, from which we’ll hear on Sunday, is a favorite of many and contains four movements. We’ll hear the calm reprieve which is the second movement, which follows the sonata’s aggressive opening. As is typical of Mendelssohn’s slow movements, it’s in a short A-B-A form with a simple, beautiful melody.\n\n​\n\n“Schafe können sicher weiden,” known in English as “Sheep may safely graze,” is among the more recognizable soprano arias by J.S. Bach and is a popular piece for weddings. It comes from the cantata, Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd (the lively hunt is all my heart’s desire), BWV 208, which is one of Bach’s few secular cantatas (the most famous of which probably being Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht, often nicknamed the “coffee” cantata). Bach wrote the cantata in 1713 while he was employed at the Ducal court of Wilhelm Ernst in Weimar, and it was likely intended as a gift from Ernst to a neighboring Duke, who enjoyed hunting. Weimar’s court poet, Salomon Franck, wrote the text. “Sheep may safely graze” is likely meant to draw a parallel between sheep being secure with a good shepherd to subjects of a wise ruler living safely and happily, but given the Biblical imagery about Jesus as the good shepherd, it can easily be interpreted as a song about trust in God. In the original scoring, the aria is accompanied by two recorders and basso continuo, clearly meant to evoke a peaceful pastoral scene.\n\n​\n\nThe other vocal solo on Sunday is by our favorite New York Episcopal singer and spiritual arranger, Harry Burleigh. Burleigh was born in Erie, PA, but moved to New York to study at the National Conservatory of Music and remained here for the rest of his life. Among his many singing engagements, he was the baritone soloist at St. George’s Episcopal Church on Stuyvesant Square for over 50 years (a controversial appointment due to his race) and remained much in-demand as a singer in New York and beyond (however, he hated recording, so few recordings of him exist). He also arranged many traditional African-American spirituals for solo singers and for choir. “Steal Away” is one such arrangement of a song by a slave named Wallace Willis. The spiritual, as many spirituals do, talks about trusting in Jesus, especially after this life, with some undertones of hope for freedom. Many claim this and other spirituals like “Swing low, sweet chariot” also contain coded messages about the underground railroad.\n\n​\n\n“Be thou my vision,” normally sung, as it will be Sunday, to the tune Slane is a fully Irish hymn. The text is a translation of an old Irish hymn, “Bí Thusa 'mo Shúile,” done by an Irish woman who lived around the turn of the 19th-20th Century. The tune, Slane, is an old Irish folk tune which was adapted as a hymn and published in The Church Hymnary in 1927 along with this text. This marriage of text and tune has since appeared in countless hymnals. The other hymn marries an American text with an English tune. The text, “Eternal ruler of the ceaseless round,” was written by John Chadwick, a Unitarian minister from Massachusetts. He wrote the text for his graduating class at the Divinity School in Cambridge, MA. After graduation, Chadwick moved to Brooklyn to be the minister of the Second Unitarian Church on the intersection of Clinton and Congress Streets in what is now known as the Cobble Hill neighborhood, and as part of what the Brooklyn Daily Eagle called the “Highway of Churches” on Clinton Street (the congregation is no longer active and the building was demolished in the 1960’s). The tune is by Orlando Gibbons, one of the leading English composers of the late Tudor and early Jacobean periods, first appointed to the Chapel Royal by King James I (for whom the King James Bible is named). “Song 1” was likely intended for psalm singing, but is paired with a number of hymn texts now, and appears in The Hymnal 1982 three times.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday October 17th\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Nun bitten wir – Dieterich Buxtehude (c.1637-1707)\n\nSequence Hymn: 448 “O love, how deep, how broad, how high” (Deus tuorum militum)\n\nOffertory Anthem: We sing to Him, whose wisdom form’d the ear – Henry Purcell (1659-1695)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 480 “When Jesus left his Father’s throne” (Kingsfold)\n\nCommunion Anthem: The goodness of God – C.P.E. Bach (1714-1788)\n\nPostlude: Toccata in F – Dieterich Buxtehude (c.1637-1707)\n\n​\n\nMainstream “classical” music tends to ignore any composer before Bach and Handel (except for one piece by Johann Pachelbel, you know the one), but if you’ve heard of one composer before the “high” baroque, there’s a good chance that composer is Dieterich Buxtehude. Though technically born in Denmark, Buxtehude spent most of his life and career in the Free City of Lübeck, a city in what is now Northern Germany, where he succeeded Franz Tunder as the organist of the Marienkirche. From there, Buxtehude became an extremely influential composer and organist. He was a major influence on a young Johann Sebastian Bach, who traveled over 200 miles each way on foot from Arnstadt to Lübeck to hear the master organist play! On Sunday, we’ll hear two very different pieces by the composer. The first is a simple, lyrical chorale prelude which ornaments the chorale melody. The chorale is Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist (we now implore the Holy Ghost), which is a medieval German church song (called a leise) based on the Veni Creator which was adapted to a chorale after the Reformation. The other piece is a short, simple, but flashy toccata which demonstrates a condensed version of the “Stilus Phantasticus” Buxtehude is known for. It includes virtuosic runs, sudden stops and starts, and general showmanship, much like contemporary violin works by the likes of Heinrich Biber.\n\n​\n\nThough we’re not hearing any J.S. Bach this week, we seem to be dancing around him! One of the anthems is by one of his sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel, who was Bach’s fifth child and second son to live to adulthood (after all, this was before modern medicine, so only about half of Bach’s 20 children survived to adulthood). CPE Bach, as he is more commonly known, was probably the most successful member of the Bach family during his lifetime (more so than his father, even) and spent the early years of his career working in the Berlin court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia (who was himself an accomplished musician), which was an extremely cosmopolitan court (in stark contrast to his father’s appointment as a church musician in Leipzig, a relative backwater). Though CPE was doubtless heavily influenced by his father, he primarily composed in a simpler style, more reminiscent of the early Classical period, focused on elegant phrases and melodies rather than the counterpoint associated with the elder Bach. That style is certainly showcased in the Communion Anthem on Sunday, which you might be forgiven for associating more with the likes of Mozart than with anyone named Bach. Near the end of his life, J.S. Bach made a visit to the Prussian court to visit his son, and wrote A Musical Offering for Frederick the Great; the book An Evening in the Palace of Reason by James R. Gaines offers an engaging and informative account of this story, if you’re interested in reading it!\n\n​\n\nFor the other anthem, we turn to 17th Century England, to the greatest English baroque composer, Henry Purcell. “We sing to him, whose wisdom form’d the ear” is one of Purcell’s miscellaneous sacred songs, a setting of a text by English clergyman Nathaniel Ingelo. The result is a short song of praise for soprano and basso continuo, with an optional bass voice added in the refrain.\n\n​\n\nThe two hymns on Sunday speak of the love and servitude of Christ. The first, “O love, how deep, how broad, how high” is a translation of an anonymous Latin text (O amor quam ecstaticus!) which is often attributed to 14th Century monk, Thomas á Kempis. The text chronicles Jesus’s life on earth through the lens of what he did for us. The tune comes from the 18th Century publication, Grenoble Antiphoner, and was originally meant to set the Latin office hymn, Deus Tuorum Militum, which is the hymn appointed for Vespers on the feast of a martyr. The other, “When Jesus left his Father’s throne,” talks about Jesus humbling himself, and has the alternate title, “Children Recalling the Example of Jesus.” The text is by James Montgomery, who lived around the turn of the 18th to 19th Centuries, was the son of Moravian missionaries, and an outspoken abolitionist. The tune, Kingsfold, is thought to be an English folk tune with origins in the medieval period. Its popularity in the modern era started with its publication in English Country Songs in 1893 and it was adapted as a hymn tune by Ralph Vaughan Williams for The English Hymnal (1906), originally paired with the text “I heard the voice of Jesus say.” Since then, it has appeared in countless hymnals and paired with several texts.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday October 10th\n\nPrelude: Alla Siciliana from Pastorale – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\nSequence Hymn: 400 “All creatures of our God and King” (Lasst uns erfreuen)\n\nOffertory Anthem: O for the wings of a dove from Hear my Prayer\n\n– Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847)\n\nOffertory Hymn: 593 “Lord make us servants of your peace” (Dickinson College)\n\nCommunion Anthem: Psalm 8 – Griffin Candey (b. 1988)\n\nPostlude: Alla Gigue from Pastorale – J.S. Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nThis Sunday, we’ll celebrate St. Francis of Assisi, who is often associated with animals, so the music this week has a definite nature-y feel! We’ll start with Bach’s Pastorale, which isn’t among the most performed of his organ works these days, and is a bit odd, but is a great piece nonetheless. None but the first movement of this four-movement work even has a pedal part, and the pedal part in the first movement is a series of pedal points (or drones)! The “Pastorale” or “Pastorella” is a musical form meant to evoke, well, a pastoral scene. They’re usually in a triple meter (12/8 in this case), almost like a slow triple meter dance, and over a drone. This first movement seems unfinished, with an odd key change before it ends, but it’s a nice piece nonetheless! The final movement is a gigue, a faster triple meter dance. It’s in two sections, one presents a theme which is imitated by the other voices, and the second section is based on the same theme but inverted (i.e. turned upside-down)!\n\n​\n\nThough Bach’s Pastorale may not be heard as much as some of his other organ works, it’s been well known for a long time! It was among the pieces performed in Felix Mendelssohn’s acclaimed series of recitals of Bach’s music, which were notable because it was unusual to hear older music until the late 19th Century. Though many composers studied Bach, Mendelssohn was instrumental in getting audiences interested in Bach, and he was a composer himself! “Hear my prayer, O Lord” is a late work by Mendelssohn (though, as you can see looking at his dates, he didn’t live very long), written in 1844. The piece, scored for soprano solo, choir, and organ or orchestra, adapts parts of Psalm 55. We’ll hear an excerpt from the end of the work on Sunday, a soaring melody which sets a text of longing, and of course the imagery of a dove building a nest seemed appropriate for St. Francis. The other vocal solo on Sunday is a setting of Psalm 8 written in 2016 by a young (roughly my age!) American composer. Griffin Candey started his career as a singer and has written a lot of vocal music, and is currently artist-in-residence for the Cleveland Opera Theatre. This setting of psalm 8 features a soaring soprano line, perhaps not dissimilar to the Mendelssohn.\n\n​\n\nThe hymns for Sunday are both texts associated with St. Francis. “All creatures of our God and King” beseeches all of creation to praise God, and was almost certainly written by St. Francis, and is set to Lasst uns erfreuen, which we sang to a different text (Ye watchers and ye holy ones) a few weeks ago, and which is among the most beloved tunes in all of hymnody, with its distinctive “Alleluia” refrain. The other text, known as the “Prayer of St. Francis,” was almost certainly not written by Francis. For one thing, St. Francis lived in the 12th and 13th Centuries, and this “Prayer of St. Francis” has, as its earliest known appearance, a French Catholic magazine published in 1912! Though the author of the prayer is anonymous, many think the founder of the league that published the magazine, Fr. Esther Bouquerel, is its author. Despite its false attribution, it’s still a lovely prayer and is often associated with St. Francis now, so it seems appropriate. We will sing this to Dickinson College, a flowing tune in 5/4 meter (unusual for hymns) by Lee Hastings Bristol, who was part of the Bristol family in the pharmaceutical company name, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Born in Brooklyn, Bristol studied as an organist but decided to work in advertising for the family business (then simply Bristol-Myers) before retiring and becoming President of Westminster Choir College in Princeton, NJ. He also served on the joint commission of church music of the Episcopal Church for many years.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday October 3rd\n\nPrelude: Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar – J.S.

Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nSince we’re celebrating Michaelmas on Sunday (the nickname for the Feast of Saint Michael), the music will be particularly angelic (in theme, if not in execution!). We’re hearing yet more Bach on the organ on Sunday (can I help it if that’s what our organ is particularly suited to?)! The organ postlude on Sunday is another movement from Bach’s transcription of Vivaldi’s concerto in D Minor for two violins, cello, and string orchestra. Last week, we heard the middle slow movement, and this provides a contrast in an aggressive movement in “ritornello” form (remember that from a few weeks ago?). This means the orchestra largely plays the same material at various points in the piece (much like a refrain or chorus in a song), and the solo instruments show off in between. Of course, it will be played on a single pipe organ, but hopefully some of the effect of soloists backed by a larger ensemble will come across! The organ prelude is from Bach’s unfinished collection of short chorale preludes, the Orgelbüchlein. Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar (roughly, from heaven came the angel band) actually sets a Christmas chorale, but the cascading scales which accompany the chorale tune are too good a depiction of angels to pass up.\n\n​\n\nThough born in modern-day Germany, Handel’s career eventually took him to London, where he had success as a composer of opera before Italian opera began to fall out of fashion. Handel turned to oratorio after that, which were both cheaper to put on (since they don’t need to be staged) and could be sung in English (since the convention for opera in London at the time was to do it in Italian). Many of Handel’s oratorios were quite popular both in their time and since then. Of course, we all know at least parts of The Messiah, but Samson, which premiered in 1743 (two years after the premiere of The Messiah), might be Handel’s most popular oratorio that’s not The Messiah. Its premiere at Covent Garden was a huge success, and a few movements are standard repertoire for both solo voices and choruses. Its libretto by Newburgh Hamilton is based on the biblical story of Samson as told in the book of Judges. “Let the bright Seraphim,” a soprano aria, is one of the more popular movements of the work, with its soaring vocal line and regal trumpets in the accompaniment. Like many of Handel’s arias, it is in “Da capo” form (da capo meaning “from the head”), with an A section, a contrasting B section, and a repeat of the A section (often with additional ornamentation from the singer).\n\n​\n\nWe’ll also hear a song for the angels by 12th Century abbess, composer, poet, mystic, and polymath Hildegard von Bingen. The first phrase of “O gloriosissimi lux vivens angeli” translates roughly to “O living light, O angels glorious!” The piece is relatively long, and changes mode several times. This is one of several pieces about the celestial choirs, which, as a set, is much like the hymn, “Ye watchers and ye holy ones” which we sang last Sunday.\n\n​\n\nThe two hymns are classic hymns about the angels. “Christ the fair glory of the holy angels” is a translation of a text by 9th Century abbott Rabanus Maurus. It is also an office hymn for Michaelmas in the Roman Breviary. This translation was made for our Hymnal 1940, though it doesn’t specify who the translator was. It’s paired to a tune from a 1728 publication from Rouen called Antiphoner, which gives the text an exciting and regal air. Each verse of the text briefly describes the three Angels which play major roles in scripture: Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel. The other is a 17th Century text set to an 18th Century tune. The text of “Ye holy angels bright” is by Richard Baxter, a former chaplain to Oliver Cromwell’s regiment, who decided to leave the Church of England and become a nonconformist minister upon the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662. The tune, known as “Darwall’s 148th” or simply “Darwall” is, and you may find this shocking, by John Darwall. Darwall was a Priest in the Church of England and was an amateur composer and musician. His most well-known tune, Darwall’s 148th was first published in 1770 in a publication called the New Universal Psalmodist, as a tune for Psalm 148 (hence the name).\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday September 26th\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Largo e spiccato from Concerto in D Minor (after Vivaldi) – J.S.

Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nYou may remember that, a few weeks ago, we heard a movement from a concerto by Venetian composer, Antonio Vivaldi, as transcribed for the organ by J.S. Bach. The prelude on Sunday comes from a transcription of a different concerto. Two weeks ago, I played one of the faster movements, so this will come as quite a contrast! Vivaldi’s original concerto was scored for two solo violins, solo cello, and string orchestra, though this movement has a single solo line over a simple accompaniment. The other organ piece on Sunday is also by Bach, is among Bach’s best known organ works, and is a youthful one, likely written while Bach lived and worked in Arnstadt in his early 20’s. The fugue subject is among Bach’s most recognizable tunes, though the fugue was likely popularized largely by Leopold Stokowski’s arrangement of the work for orchestra. Before becoming famous as a conductor (and especially so as the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra for the music used in Disney’s 1940 film, Fantasia), Stokowski was an organist. He spent his early career as organist and choirmaster at St. Bart’s here in Manhattan (now over on Park Avenue, though in those days they were still worshipping at their old building on 43rd Street) before he went to Europe for further conducting study.\n\n​\n\nMy habit of acknowledging other occasions during this time of year when there seems to be little to distinguish the Sundays continues. September 29th, which is next Wednesday, is the Feast of Saint Michael and All Angels, often called Michaelmas, which though a notable feast in the church, is perhaps more notable for its place in the year. It’s one of the “quarter days” in the British Isles (on which, among other things, servants were hired, rents were due, and school terms would start, and you’ll still hear some British schools refer to the fall term as the “Michaelmas term”). In normal years, the Sunday closest to it would be the kickoff of the program year here at All Saints’, though that will be delayed a little bit due to the Pandemic. Both the anthem and the hymn at the offertory use angels as the theme. “Hark, the echoing air” comes from Purcell’s “semi-opera,” The Fairy Queen, written near the end of his short life. Though the work is a secular piece of music, this vocal solo from it describes angels clapping their wings (well, cupids in the original, but who’s counting). The libretto used for The Fairy Queen is an adaptation of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream done by an anonymous writer, and “Hark the echoing air” strikes a definite triumphant mood. It will be immediately followed by “Ye watchers and ye holy ones” to the popular tune, Lasst uns erfreuen. The tune first appeared in its current form in a German Jesuit hymnal in 1623, though some traces of it can be found in some reformed psalters. Ralph Vaughan Williams paired it with this text by Athelston Riley, a description of the choirs of angels praising God, for The English Hymnal in 1906, and it has remained a popular text and tune since then. It’s a favorite in just about every church I’ve ever been in and was even lampooned in an episode of Mr. Bean!\n\n​\n\nThe other hymn is a charge for Christians to fulfill their duty and follow God, which has been a theme of the last several weeks in the lectionary. The tune was written by William Walter in 1872, and the text (which originally began “Rise up, O men of God”) by William Pierson Merrill in 1911.\n\n​\n\nFinally, we’ll briefly go back to the Biblical Songs by famous Czech composer, Antonín Dvořák, who is perhaps most famous for his time in the United States. That time most famously produced his 9th Symphony, often called the “New world” symphony, in which he included several themes he heard while in various parts of the country. The Biblical Songs were largely written toward the end of those travels while the composer lived in New York City and ran the now-defunct National Conservatory of Music (where he became acquainted with singer and composer Harry Burleigh, whose arrangements of spirituals we’ve heard at All Saints). Each song sets portions of psalms; the triumphant one heard on Sunday sets parts of Psalms 144 and 145. The collection was published in 1895, after the composer returned to his native Bohemia, and though composed in New York, was premiered in Prague. Interestingly, the collection was published in three languages: Czech, German, and English, and the composer took care that all three languages fit the music.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNotes from The Music Director, Mr. James Hopkins\n\nfor Sunday September 19th\n\n​\n\nPrelude: Prelude in G Major – J.S.

Bach (1685-1750)\n\n​\n\nBach’s time in Weimar, where he worked in the court of Duke Johann Ernst III, produced many of the composer’s keyboard works, including many of the preludes and fugues which would eventually make up The Well-Tempered Clavier. Bach had a pretty good situation at the Ducal court (at least until he left the job, but that’s another story), and had a major say in the expansion of the chapel organ there, so it’s not hard to see that he was inspired to write organ music as well. Bach wrote the Prelude and Fugue in G Major, which is number 541 in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnes (BWV for short, which literally means “Bach works catalog”), around 1712, when he would have been about 27 years old. The prelude seems more like a virtuosic violin solo than a keyboard work, to the point that I wouldn’t be surprised if a version of the piece for violin and keyboard"
