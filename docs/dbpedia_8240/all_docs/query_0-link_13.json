        "text": "unconfirmed source said one of the pair is Nicky Butt\n\nand the pair does not necessary has to be from Hotspur.\n\nI thought this myself. If they were both coming from one club then I would presume only on loan and that some kind of agreement would have been made.\n\nOn the other hand, Dos Santos being linked must be widely off the mark, why would he go from World Cup to HK just like that? He's just at the beginning of his career unlike the Butt's and Woodgates. But what would they seriously bring? Would they enjoy if? I think both could be there for the money, maybe Woodgate would be the better option to help develop players more defensively, but where would there prioties be? To me, off the field than on.\n\nIt has been confirmed by South China blog and the Hong Kong newspapers that the English player is Nicky Butt. The CONCACAF player's identity will be kept secret until later due to his manager's request.\n\nAlso Ng Wai-Chiu (Hangzhou Greentown) and Andy Nagelain (Shenzhen Ruby) are strongly rumoured to join South China as well. Hangzhou Greentown looks set to qualify for ACL, but for ACL Ng Wai-Chiu is considered a foreigner so they will let him go. Andy Negalain's family lives in Hong Kong, so it is even easier for him to move here.\n\noh man Ng Wai-Chiu is not going to play in CSL anymore?\n\nhe is arguably one of the best hong konger players we have now.\n\nandy negalain, i hope he will play well and join the hong kong national team\n\nrumour states it might be Chinese tier 2 league 廣州日之泉\n\nbut he his kid has just born\n\nso it might not be wise for him to move his family to mainland rightaway."
