        "text": "Joan Magrané Figuera took his first composition lessons with Ramón Humet. He then studied at the Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya (Barcelona) with Agustí Charles, and at the Kunstuniversität Graz with Beat Furrer. He is currently preparing a master’s degree in composition at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris with Stefano Gervasoni. Laureate of the Villa Medici in Rome in 2016, he was a member of the Casa de Velázquez in Madrid in 2017-2018. He was composer-in-residence at La Pedrera (Barcelona) in 2018-2019, at Faber (Olot) in 2018, and at the Centro Nacional de Difusión Musical (Madrid) in 2020-2021. He was also a guest composer at the Palau de la Música Catalana (Barcelona) for the 2019-2020 season and at L’Auditori (Barcelona) for the 2021-2022 season.\n\nHis encounters with Mauricio Sotelo and Jesús Torres were crucial in his artistic development, as have been the courses and master classes of Pierre Boulez, Peter Eötvös, Salvatore Sciarrino, George Benjamin, Helmut Lachenmann, Brian Ferneyhough, Chaya Czernowin, Hèctor Parra, José María Sánchez-Verdú, Pedro Alcalde, and Alberto Posadas.\n\nHis works have been performed by the Quatuor Diotima, the Quartet Gerhard, bcn216, CrossingLines, JONDE, Espai Sonor, Taller Sonoro, and the Ensemble SurPlus, among others, in events such as the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Gaudeamus Muziekweek, Voix Nouvelles, the Akademie Schloss Solitude, the ManiFeste Academy, and the Cátedra Manuel de Falla.\n\nMagrané Figuera’s artistic expression has been built around medieval music, gothic music, and Renaissance polyphony. He also claims the influence of composers such as Federico Mompou, Josquin des Prez, Orlando di Lasso, and Claudio Monteverdi. From Mompou, he took the idea of “de-composition,” which consists in removing all embellishments in order to reach the essential. He also draws his inspiration from poetry and painting, and is influenced by the works of José Ángel Valente, Pere Gimferrer, Dino Campana, Miquel Barceló, Albrecht Dürer, and Piero della Francesca.\n\nHe is the recipient of numerous international awards, including the XXXI Queen Sophia Composition Prize (2014).\n\nSome of his works are published by Éditions Durand, FICTA, and BabelScores.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nMember of the Casa de Velázquez, 2017-2018\n\nLaureate of the Villa Medici, 2016\n\nXXXI Reina Sofia Composition Prize, 2014\n\n3rd Prize at the Franz Josef Reinl-Stiftung Composers Competition, 2012\n\nPrize from the Ministry of Youth, Competition from the City of Udine, 2012\n\nHonorable Mention at the Premio del Colegio de España-Inaem, 2012\n\n1st Prize at the Premio G.e.r.m.i., 2012\n\nPremio Jonde-Inaem, 2011\n\nHonorable Mention at the Premio Carmelo Bernaola de Composición, 2011\n\nPremio Injuve at the Creación Joven, 2010\n\n© Ircam-Centre Pompidou, 2022\n\nSources\n\nSite du compositeur ; Site des éditions Durand ; site des éditions BabelScores ; site des éditions Ficta."
