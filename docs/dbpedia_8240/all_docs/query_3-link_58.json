Barcelona members has succeeded in its race to collect the thousands of signatures required to force a vote that could lead to the ouster of the club’s unpopular president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, and the board that has led the team into the biggest crisis in its recent history.\n\nThe group — a collection of fan organizations that aligned specifically for the effort to push out Bartomeu — hopes that, if the signatures are accepted after a review, a no-confidence vote will be held as soon as next month."
