        "text": "Paraguay travel to Montevideo for the vital World Cup Qualifier on Thursday looking to win in the Uruguayan capital for the first time in over 20 years. This will be the Albirroja’s 51st game there almost 100 years since the first meeting in November 1921, a 4-2 friendly loss against the Celeste. It will be Paraguay’s 30th game against Uruguay in the capital and have previously won seven encounters. Here we look back chronologically at the seven WCQs played between these sides.\n\n1957 Uruguay 2-0 Paraguay\n\nThe first meeting was the final game of the 1958 qualifiers with the Albirroja arriving in high spirits having thrashed their opponents 5-0 just two weeks previously in Asunción. Florencio Amarilla, then still based locally at Nacional, netted a hattrick which is something that wouldn’t be repeated in WCQs until José “Pepe” Cardozo did the same against Uruguay but also in Asunción in 2003. With Aureliano González’s side already qualified for the World Cup in Sweden it might not be a surprise that their only loss of the campaign was this one, Eladio Benítez scored early on for the home side before William Martínez put some shine on the result with an 89th minute goal.\n\n1996 Uruguay 0-2 Paraguay\n\nThe two sides successfully avoided each other in qualifying campaigns until the introduction of the current round-robin format ahead of the 1998 World Cup in France. The Albirroja came into the game on June 2nd having lost their home opener in April to Colombia, meanwhile the Charrua’s had picked up a routine win away to Venezuela. But this match was very a coming-of-age for the graduates from the much celebrated 1992 Olympic team. Carlos Gamarra, Celso Ayala and Francisco Arce had all been in that defence and kept a cleansheet here, marshalled by the legendary José Luis Chilavert in goal. It was Arce who started the scoring with a wonderful freekick after just 10 minutes to settle the nerves. As Uruguay kept searching for an equalizer, coming close when captain Bengoechea struck the foot of the post with a dipping volley, they left space in behind. Paraguay capitalized in the dying minutes with substitute Arístides Rojas rounding off a 3 vs 2 counter attack.\n\n2001 Uruguay 0-1 Paraguay\n\nThis was the 11th game of the 2002 qualifiers but the first that year (2001) as Paraguay hoped to continue their excellent WCQ form which had seen them stay unbeaten for the previous six matches including a win over Brazil and draws away to Argentina & Bolivia in La Paz. The hosts dominated with Chilavert having to pull off a string of important saves, but it was a goalkeeping error the other end that handed the victory to the visitors. Paolo Montero’s backpass to Fabián Carini was miscued by the stopper and José “Pepe” Cardozo had time and space to pick out Cerro Porteño’s Guido Alvarenga for his first ever goal for the Guaranies.\n\n2004 Uruguay 1-0 Paraguay\n\nAnother typically tense game between these sides as had become, and Uruguay came out on top just as they had done in the Copa América encounter just a few months before in Peru. The Albirroja played a defensive style in these qualifiers under Aníbal Ruiz and managed to frustrate their old rivals for most of the game. But Juventus’ central defender Paolo Montero steamed in at the back post to head home from a corner, Caniza and Paredes couldn’t keep him out.\n\n2009 Uruguay 2-0 Paraguay\n\nFive years later and both sides were much changed for this contest, ushering in exciting new generations of players. Uruguay had formed the Suárez and Forlán partnership and the pair combined for the opening goal, the Pistolero latching onto a long diagonal pass and wrong-footing Paulo Da Silva to feed Forlán. The then Toluca-based centre-back was found wanting again late into the second half as the captain Diego Lugano outjumped him at the far post heading in a freekick.\n\n2013 Uruguay 1-1 Paraguay\n\nOn reflection it is surprising to think that the Albirroja’s only point earned in the last 20 years in Montevideo was during their catastrophic campaign when they finished bottom of the World Cup Qualifying table. Once again it was Luis Suárez causing problems, he eventually opened the scoring with a stunning volley from Nicolas Lodeiro’s cross. It looked like the Albirroja would come away with nothing yet again but they were rescued by the substitute Edgar “Pajaro” Benítez. Godín and Lugano had both attacked a hopeful punt with the latter inadvertantly flicking the ball on for a grateful Benítez.\n\n2016 Uruguay 4-0 Paraguay\n\nThe memory of the most recent meeting between these two sides is a harrowing one for the fans of the red and white, their heaviest ever defeat in WCQs equalling the loss by the same scoreline against Colombia in 2001. Once again Luis Suárez was a nightmare, he had two assists and won a penalty which he converted himself. The plaudits also went to his new partner Edinson Cavani, the matador scored twice and would finish topscorer in the qualifiers.\n\nOnly three players survive that defeat, the Romero twins Óscar and Ángel who started in the rain that day and Miguel Almirón who came on as a sub. Let’s hope that this new generation can reverse two difficult decades in the Uruguayan capital.\n\nArgentina vs Paraguay\n\nEstadio Mario Kempes\n\n(2-1) 3-1 – Lavezzi, Higuain, Messi; Fabbro (pen)\n\nAnother away defeat for Paraguay, their fourth of the current campaign leaves them bottom of the qualifying group with just four points. It was their first qualifying defeat to Argentina since 1997 and their first on Argentine soil since 1973. It isn’t all doom and gloom, this was the albirroja’s best performance in the qualifiers so far as they went down fighting against the albiceleste and can point to some misfortune in the first two goals.\n\nThe opener came after a couple of minutes, Paraguay had started brightly but were ripped apart by a quick passing move that dragged the defence towards the ball leaving Angel Di Maria in space. He looked to curl a shot into the far corner which looped up off the back of Ezequiel Lavezzi and out of the reach of Justo Villar.\n\nParaguay stuck to their gameplan, giving Argentina possession in defence before trying to squeeze and accelerate the tempo in the midfield, Cristian Riveros in particular was excellent at pressing. Paraguay began to have possession and were winning set pieces, one of which led to the equaliser. Under no pressure Rodrigo Braña inexplicably handballed a Victor Ayala corner to hand Paraguay a lifeline. The Argentine-born Jonathan Fabbro had no problem scoring and celebrating against the country of his birth, the 100th Paraguyan goal against their oldest rivals. The Guaraní were only level for 15 minutes though as Argentina went in front on the half hour through Gonzalo Higuain’s smart finish. Richard Ortiz attempted to cut out a through ball but only succeeded in diverting it into the path of Higuain and one-on-one with Paulo da Silva there was only going to be one winner.\n\nThe nail in the coffin came in the second half with a Lionel Messi free kick, the Argentine captian had threatened in the first half when he struck the post from a set piece but this time he made no mistake. Paraguay pushed in the later stages for a consolation, their main weapon Ayala’s dead ball delivery but they were unable to find the net again and have now lost every away game by two goals.\n\nWorld Cup qualification looks all but impossible now for the albirroja especially with Colombia and Ecuador winning, but hopes will be raised if they can win at home to Venezuela on Tuesday night and the aforementioned sides lose their away games to Chile and Uruguay.\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nWith several Paraguayan players heading north during this (southern hemisphere) winter it seems a good time to inform you all of the Mexican Legion that will be on show in the Mexican Apertura that kicks off next month. Sit back and enjoy\n\nNEW RECRUITS\n\nHerminio Miranda (Puebla)\n\nThe 27-year-old defender has joined Puebla after four years at Paraguayan club Nacional where he picked up two league titles (2009 & 2011 Apertura). A left-footed player known for his vicious freekicks and strong challenges he is as likely to be amongst the goals as the red cards!\n\nStats\n\nD.o.B: 4 April 1985\n\nHometown: Itá, Paraguay\n\nHeight: 1.85 metres\n\nPosition: Left back/Centre back\n\nPrevious Clubs: General Caballero, 2 de Mayo, Nacional (all Paraguay), Huachipato (Chile)\n\n=================================\n\nPaulo Da Silva (Pachuca)\n\nTechnically a returning hero – the former Sunderland man couldn’t agree terms with Real Zaragoza who he helped save from relegation in Spain. Da Silva of course made his name with Toluca in México where he spent six years and picked up three winners medals. Although he struggled in the Premier League the central defender has excelled at international level winning over 100 caps for the albirroja and is impressive as a covering defender behind a more physical partner who wins the aerial battles.\n\nStats\n\nD.o.B: 1 February 1980\n\nHometown: Asunción, Paraguay\n\nHeight: 1.81 metres\n\nPosition: Centre back\n\nPrevious Clubs: Atlantida, Presidente Hayes, Cerro Porteño, Sport Colombia, Libertad (all Paraguay), Perugia, Venezia (both Italy), Lanús (Argentina), Toluca (Mexico), Sunderland (England), Real Zaragoza (Spain)\n\n=================================\n\nEdgar ‘Pajaro’ Benitez (Toluca)\n\nOk so this one is unofficial, but the pajaro will fly the nest if he can’t agree terms with Cerro Porteño where he is currently on loan. Parent club Pachuca have already stated publicly he will be a Toluca player if the Paraguayan club don’t retain his services. The 24-year-old has already enjoyed success in México scoring the crucial goal for Pachuca to win the CONCACAF Champions League in 2009/10. The left-footed winger cum striker has excelled in the domestic sphere with Cerro with his blistering pace and tendency to run at defenders making him a real handful.\n\nStats\n\nD.o.B: 8 November 1987\n\nHometown: Repatriación, Paraguay\n\nHeight: 1.76 metres\n\nPosition: Left winger/forward\n\nPrevious Clubs: Libertad, Sol de América, Cerro Porteño (all Paraguay), Pachuca (Mexico)\n\n=================================\n\nOLD GUARD\n\nJust a brief round-up of the guys already plying their trade in La Liga Mexicana.\n\nOsvaldo Martinez (Atlante) – This blog is a big fan of the diminutive forward who like Edgar Benitez has won the CONCACAF Champions League with Monterrey where he picked up a couple of league titles to boot. We featured him earlier in the season.\n\nFredy Bareiro (Estudiantes Tecos) – Fredy ‘The Fox’ Bareiro is close to coming back to Paraguay possibly with Olimpia with his contract up at Tecos, however if the right deal comes through he will happily stay in the country he first moved to five years ago with León.\n\nAureliano Torres (Toluca) – The left back was a regular starter for the side who missed out on the liguilla he will hope to form a good partnership down the left with his compatrior Edgar Benítez should he stay, although Torres has been linked heavily with Uruguayan club Peñarol.\n\nDario Verón (PUMAS) – Paulo da Silva’s long-standing central defensive partner in the national team is recovering from a long-term injury and how PUMAS missed him towards the end of last season. He has been a pillar of the team so successful in recent years winning five trophies since joining almost a decade ago.\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nBolivia vs Paraguay\n\nEstadio Hernando Siles\n\n09/06/2012, 16.00 hs (21.00 BST)\n\nFinally, after all the talk, all the hype and all the acclimatising the crunch World Cup Qualifier between Bolivia and Paraguay is upon us. The game has taken on huge significance following the albirroja’s relatively slow start to the campaign and Chiqui Arce will be under fire if Paraguay fail to win having spent one month in La Paz acclimatising. The support of the APF (Paraguayan FA) and the clubs who released their players early will vanish if the Guaraní don’t get the right result.\n\nArce will set his side up in a 4-4-2 formation hoping to keep possession and frustrate the Bolivians, that is the Chiqui way and while it didn’t work against Peru or Chile in the previous qualifiers away from Asunción the system should have been drummed into the players after a month of training. The team is likely to be domestic-based players with a spine of old warhorses starting in goal with Justo Villar, supported by central defender Paulo Da Silva, central midfielder Cristian Riveros and hard-working striker Nelson Haedo Valdez. Aureliano Torres was recalled and the left back will have a key role to play from set pieces as the ball can often take a deceptive trajectory in the thin La Paz air.\n\nBolivia are trying to bounce back from the disappointment of the lacklustre display against Chile and are boosted by the return of star striker Marcelo Martins although they lost Juan Carlos Arce to injury. Coach Gustavo Quinteros had previously organised the Andean side very well and they frustrated Argentina last year in Buenos Aires. The problem with the verde is more psychological and has plagued them historically, if they concede the first goal heads will drop and a comeback is unlikely. Paraguay will undoubtedly be looking to score early on to break Bolivia mentally in this battle of the continent’s two landlocked nations.\n\nParaguay Probable XI: Justo Villar; Ricardo Mazacotte, Adalberto Román, Paulo Da Silva, Aureliano Torres; Eduardo Aranda, Cristian Riveros, Eric Ramos, Osvaldo Martínez; Nelson Haedo, Pablo Zeballos\n\nPrediction: Bolivia were poor against Chile at home and their home advantage has been hugely reduced by the acclimatisation of the away team, Chiqui Arce is aware his job could be riding on this game and his team will come through for him, 0-1\n\nSELECTED ODDS: Bolivia win 2.8, Draw 3.35, Paraguay win 2.74, 0-1 scoreline 8.4, Under 2.5 goals 1.69\n\nBEST BET: Hard to look past the away win at that price\n\n==================================\n\nStats\n\nFor a more complete set of statistics take a peek at the Bolivia vs Paraguay Stat Attack – here are the head-to-heads taken from there:\n\nHead-to-Head\n\nParaguay vs Bolivia Overall\n\nPld 64 W 32 D 17 L 13 GF 122 GA 62\n\nParaguay vs Bolivia World Cup Qualifiers\n\nPld 14 W 8 D 3 L 3 GF 28 GA 13\n\nParaguay vs Bolivia World Cup Qualifiers in Bolivia\n\nPld 7 W 1 D 3 L 3 GF 7 GA 10\n\nParaguay vs Bolivia all competitions in La Paz\n\nPld 15 W 2 D 6 L 7 – only wins were WCQ in 1974 and friendly in 1977\n\n==================================\n\nParaguay Squad\n\nFor full analysis on the squad you can check out my piece here.\n\nGoalkeepers: Justo Villar (Estudiantes LP, Argentina), Diego Barreto (Cerro Porteño, Paraguay), Antony Silva (Deportes Tolima, Colombia), Joel Silva (Guaraní, Paraguay).\n\nFull backs: Ricardo Mazacotte (Nacional, Paraguay), Tomás Bartomeus (Guaraní, Paraguay), Aureliano Torres (Toluca, México), Elvis Marecos (Guaraní, Paraguay).\n\nCentre Backs: Paulo Da Silva (Zaragoza, España), Adalberto Román (Palmeiras, Brasil), Julio Manzur (Guaraní, Paraguay), Luis Cardozo (Cerro Porteño, Paraguay).\n\nMidfielders: Jorge D.
