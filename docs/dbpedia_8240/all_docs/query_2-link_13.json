        "text": "Guatemala vs Paraguay\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium\n\n(2-1) 3-3 – Pappa (pen), León, Ruiz (pen); Cardozo, Fabbro, Perez\n\nUnfortunatley this game wasn’t televised in Paraguay or Guatemala or anywhere in the world so I had to resort to listening to it on the radio. However there is no doubt that the key player for Paraguay was second half substitute Jonathan Fabbro, the Argentine native making his international debut in Gerardo Pelusso’s first game in charge. The number 17 scored a delightful freekick and used his strength and vision to set up the third.\n\nParaguay were denied a win by a late penalty from ‘Pescadito’ Ruiz (any jokes about diving little fishes are not for this blog) and it was the first time they had scored three and failed to win since the Copa America game with Venezuela last year. Pelusso definitely has plenty to think about before next month’s game away to Argentina in the World Cup Qualifiers, if they concede three to Guatemala just how will they stop a rampant Lionel Messi? Up front he needs to decide if Fabbro is the man for the job, if so the team should be built around him as he proved last night just how destructive he can be.\n\nParaguay XI: Justo Villar; Dario Verón, Paulo Da Silva, Antolin Alcaraz, Richard Ortiz; Hernan Perez, Víctor Cáceres, Cristian Riveros, Marcelo Estigarribia; Edgar Benítez, Oscar Cardozo\n\nSubs: Jonathan Fabbro for Edgar Benítez, Julio Dos Santos for Cristian Riveros, Carlos Bonet for Dario Verón, Miguel Samudio for Richard Ortiz, Roque Santa Cruz for Oscar Cardozo, Osvaldo Martinez for Hernan Perez\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nGuatemala vs Paraguay\n\nRobert F.Kennedy Memorial Stadium\n\n15/08/2012, 18.15 hs (23.15 hs BST)\n\nFor the third time this year Paraguay and Guatemala go head-to-head in an international friendly, the first game in Luque was won 2-1 by the albirroja with the ‘2nd leg’ in the Guatemala City also a victory for the South Americans. Now they meet on neutral ground, in Washington DC, in a game that represents Gerardo Pelusso’s first chance to look at his players.\n\nAt Olimpia the Uruguayan coach usually lined his team up in a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3 formation but with the national team recently there has been a problem scoring goals, Martino managed an average of 1.1 goals per game and while Chiqui Arce increased that return to 1.4 in his 12 official games it was heavily reliant on goals from set pieces and penalties. With that in mind Pelusso has looked to the recently-nationalized Jonathan Fabbro who will make his international debut aged 30. While some readers may be more aware of his girlfriend (strongly advise male readers to click this link) the Argentinian native who has taken Paraguayan nationality having lived here for five years is a class act. He isn’t a traditional South American playmaker, he’s too tall (1.88 metres) and strong and has more defensive ability than a typical ’10’, but he can’t be considered a striker either as he rarely finds himself in the penalty area. Undoubtedly his great strengths are shots from distance and vicious free kicks but he needs to get the best out the striker he plays with, most likely to be Oscar Cardozo with Lucas Barrios (injury) and Nelson Haedo (given leave to sign for Valencia) unavailable.\n\nIn the previous two meetings with Guatemala it is clear that Paraguayan coach Ever Almeida are well organised and comfortable in possession but lack any killer punch. The conduit is Marco Pappa in midfield who plays in the United States and scored a late equaliser against USMNT in their previous competitive game. La Albirroja have successfully neutralised his threat the past two games and it is likely they’ll be able to do so again and win this game to nil.\n\nPREDICTION: Paraguay are too good on paper and will want to impress their new coach, 0-2\n\nSELECTED ODDS: Guatemala win 7.4, Draw 5.2, Paraguay win 1.39, Under 2.5 goals 2.08, 0-2 scoreline 6.8\n\nBEST BET: Not much value in the win, one possibility is ‘Paraguay win to nil’ or maybe spread the final score market with 0-1, 0-2 and 0-3 all possibilities\n\nParaguay XI probable (4-2-3-1)\n\nJusto Villar; Dario Verón, Antolin Alcaraz, Paulo Da Silva, Richard Ortiz; Víctor Cáceres, Cristian Riveros; Hernan Perez, Jonathan Fabbro, Marcelo Estigarribia; Oscar Cardozo\n\n===========================================================\n\nSTATS\n\nParaguay record vs Guatemala: Pld 8 W 7 D 1 L 0 GF 17 GA 6\n\nParaguay in the United States (since 2005): Pld 5 W 1 D 0 L 4 GF 5 GA 11 – their only win came against the USA\n\nTime of first Paraguay goal in last five games: 82, 6, 88, 34, 44\n\nParaguay have kept NINE cleansheets in their previous ELEVEN friendlies\n\n==========================================================\n\nFull Squad list\n\nGK: Diego Barreto (Cerro Porteño), Antony Silva (Tolima), Justo Villar (Estudiantes)\n\nDEF: Paulo Da Silva (Pachuca), Darío Verón (Pumas), Antolín Alcaraz (Wigan Athletic), Pedro Benítez (Cerro Porteño), Carlos Bonet (Cerro Porteño), Miguel Samudio (Libertad), Richard Ortiz (Olimpia)\n\nMID: Víctor Cáceres (Flamengo), Hernán Pérez (Villarreal), Cristian Riveros (Kayserispor), Marcelo Estigarribia (Sampdoria), Osvaldo Martínez (Atlante), Julio Dos Santos (Cerro Porteño), Marcos Riveros (Nacional), Jonathan Fabbro (Cerro Porteño)\n\nATT: Roque Santa Cruz (Manchester City), Óscar Cardozo (Benfica), Edgar Benítez (Toluca)\n\n** Nelson Haedo (Valencia) and Lucas Barrios (Guangzhou Evergrande) were called up but subsequently pulled out\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nAuthors Note: All odds correct at time of writing via Betfair\n\nGuatemala vs Paraguay\n\nEstadio Mateo Flores\n\n25/04/12, 22.00 hs (03.00 hs BST)\n\nParaguay embark on the final rehearsal before the returning to the World Cup Qualifying scene in June with that crucial game against Bolivia in La Paz. Chiqui Arce has picked a casera squad with two exceptions, Jorge Nuñez and Fernando Gimenez travel from Colombia and Ecuador respectively to join the group. This is Paraguay’s fourth visit to the Guatemalan capital having previously played twice in 1965 and most recently 1999. They won the last fixture 2-1 thanks to goals from Edgar Benitez, who starts tonight, and Ariel Bogado, who didn’t make the squad.\n\nChiqui Arce has used vastly varied teams throughout the recent spate of friendlies but has generally stuck to a 4-4-2 which seems the plan for tonight. The weakness is probably Tomás Bartomeus who has been forced to play out of position at left back, however he will get good cover from Emelec’s Fernando Gimenez who can get up and down. One of the few players to have featured in all the matches this year is Cerro Porteño’s Edgar Benitez who will play up front tonight but has also been used as a winger. El Pajaro is fast and very dangerous when running at defenders, Guatemala had a hard time containing him last time round.\n\nThe home side, managed by Ever Almeida of Paraguay, were relatively positive in the previous encounter but had a heavy reliance on Pappa in midfield. La Albirroja neutralised that threat with good pressing in the middle of the pitch and it will probably be the task of Eric Ramos to do the dirty work for the visitor’s tonight. La Azul y Blanco have been in good form at home, winning their last three with a goal difference of 10-1, although their last game against CONMEBOL opposition here saw them lose 2-0 to Venezuela, I think it could be a similar story tonight.\n\nPREDICTION: Paraguay travelled well to central America previously and have enough quality up front to win this, 0-2\n\nSELECTED ODDS: Guatemala win 4.1, Draw 3.6, Paraguay win 2.02, Under 2.5 goals 1.94, 0-2 scoreline 11.0\n\nBEST BET: The away win is too good value to miss out on especially when you consider that these players have spent most of their Mondays and Tuesdays with Chiqui Arce in special training camps, back Paraguay\n\nParaguay XI confirmed (4-4-2)\n\nD.Barreto; R.Mazzacotte, P.Aguilar, S.Candia, T.Barthomeus; J.

Cerro Porteño’s stadium welcomed 9,554 fans who expected nothing less than an easy win, especially with the presence of the much feted World Cup stars (or mundialistas in local vernacular). But rather than an exhibition of flowing football they were ‘treated’ to the most traditional of Paraguayan qualities, hard graft as the ten men in red and white presented Chiqui Arce with his sixth win after ten games in charge.\n\nParaguay lined-up as a 4-4-2 but as expected Osvaldo Martinez was given license to cut inside and try and create things for his forwards, Jorge Mendoza found himself on the left but being a natural right footer he tried to cut in making Paraguay rather narrow at times. The home team were patient in possession and it seemed Arce was finally getting his message across, that was until the 16th minute. Victor ‘Topo’ Caceres was sent off for an alleged elbow (Paraguay Football still hasn’t seen the replays) and at that point Arce might as well have thrown his notebook over the stadium fence. The game was no longer about tactics, strategy, plans for Bolivia (their next competitive international) but about clinging on and not losing at home to a desperately poor opposition.\n\nPanama were so poor in fact, that Paraguay had no problem keeping possession with ten men, the difficulty was penetration in the final third as Lucas Barrios and more often Nelson Haedo Valdez were isolated with full backs unable to support and Cristian Riveros now having to hold in central midfield instead of push forward. Haedo Valdez playing as a right winger cum striker (he generally runs enough for two positions so this wasn’t a major problem) was excellent in holding up the ball but rarely found the target when in a position to score. Barrios, justifiably tired having only arrived the morning before the game, only had one chance of merit a bicycle kick wide.\n\nIn the second half the game became disjointed with substitutions and quite incredibly Panamanian attempts to time waste (a professional team with an extra man trying to draw 0-0 in a game where the result doesn’t matter is a frustrating sight) but Paraguay kept at their game plan, keep possession and don’t panic. The introduction of José Ortigoza up front gave the local team more of a target up front and he had a wonderful headed chance following Victor Ayala’s (another substitue) teasing cross.\n\nWith 15 minutes to go the excellent Osvaldo Martinez was withdrawn for Reinaldo Ocampo and Eric Ramos came on in the middle for Riveros as Paraguay hoped to inject more pace into the game. It was pace that clinched this friendly win for them, Edgar Benitez is fast becoming Arce’s star man and the Cerro Porteño forward danced his way into the box to slide a pass to Jonathan Santana the Libertad man made no mistake.\n\nParaguay XI: J.Villar; C.Bonet, A.Alcaraz, P.Da Silva, M.Samudio; O.Martinez, V.Caceres, C.Riveros, J.Mendoza; N.Haedo Valdez, L.Barrios\n\nSubs: E.Benitez for L.Barrios, J.Ortigoza for N.Haedo Valdez, V.Ayala for C.Bonet, R.Ocampo for O.Martinez, E.Ramos for C.Riveros, J.Santana for J.Mendoza\n\nRed Card: Victor Caceres ’16\n\n===============================\n\nOFF THE BALL\n\nParaguay U17s give us a goal fest\n\nAs is common in Paraguay the main course that is the senior side is preceeded by a youthful starter, the U17s continued their preparation under Mauro Caballero with a 7-1 thrashing of a Guaireña selection having draw 2-2 last week with Ovetense. Cristian Vargas was strong up front again and in central midfield Angel Benitez and Rene Obregon seemed much more athletic than their hapless opponents. As Paraguay used all their subs it gave them more energy and a flurry of goals at the end much in part to replacement left winger Angel Marecos, lovely balance and speed.\n\nParaguay U17s XI: M.Mereles; R.Alvarenga, A.Duarte, D.Marín, J.Sanabria; M.Gonzalez, A.Benitez, R.Obregón, M.Durán; F.Gonzalez, C.Vargas\n\nSubs: L.Caballero, A.Vera, R.Tandi, L.Acosta, A.Marecos, D.Toledo, A.Torres\n\n===============================\n\nNapout no comment on friendlies\n\nAfter the game, the president of the Paraguayan FA, Juan Angel Napout said “I have no opinion” about the quality of the opposition. Paraguay since the World Cup Quarter Final have played friendlies against the likes New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras and Bolivia. The only European team they’ve faced is Romania in Asunción although it was a weakened side.\n\n===============================\n\n1-0 to the Albirro\n\nLast night’s win was the 22nd 1-0 win by Paraguay in their 177 home games, it is the most common scoreline.\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nParaguay vs Panama\n\nEstadio General Pablo Rojas a.k.a La Olla\n\n29/02/12, 20.30 hs (23.30 hs GMT)\n\nParaguay take on a Central American side time for the fourth time under Chiqui Arce’s reign, it is the second time the new coach has faced Panama having debuted with a win against them back in September. That day Oscar Cardozo and Robin Ramirez got the goals, neither striker has been called up to the current squad, full of domestic-based players with one eye on the World Cup Qualifier in La Paz just over three months away.\n\nThe European stars are happy to be back in the warmth, Nelson Haedo Valdez of Rubin Kazan in Russia noted on local radio earlier today “It is so cold even your snot freezes”. The idea will be to build on the solid victories against Chile and Guatemala with the introduction of established players, like captain Justo Villar who makes the short trip from La Plata, Argentina. Don’t expect much change tactically from Chiqui Arce, he is trying to impose his style onto a group of players and wants to keep drumming into them the virtues of possession and patient build up in a 4-4-2.\n\nThe starting eleven is all but confirmed (see below) the only doubt being a choice between Lucas Barrios or Haedo Valdez, the Dortmund striker only arrived on Tuesday morning and will be assessed on the day of the game. The back four is balanced, Libertad duo Carlos Bonet and Miguel Samudio will offer something going forward but are accomplished defensively. In midfield expect Victor ‘Topo’ Caceres to sit in the middle while Cristian Riveros is more box-to-box and will go chasing the ball and try to get in the box if the situation allows. Osvaldo Martinez is back in the fold having started the season well with Atlante in Mexico and he will be the creative spark, trying to provide fodder for the two strikers.\n\nUltimately, like the previous game against Guatemala, Paraguay are expected to win and win with ease. They played well against Guatemala, were organised, kept possession and despite the scoreline (2-1) never looked uncomfortable. Here’s hoping for more of hte same on Wednesday night.\n\nParaguay XI (probable) vs Panama: J.Villar; C.Bonet, P.Da Silva, A.Alcaraz, M.Samudio; O.Martínez, V.Cáceres, C.Riveros, J.Mendoza; J.

The game ended Guatemala’s six game winning streak and keeps Paraguay unbeaten in home friendlies since 1999, it also represents a third straight home victory in all competitions.\n\nThe cheap tickets and clear skies (despite the threat of a storm) made for an excellent atmosphere in the Feliciano Caceres, the Luqueño public turned out in force to watch the albirroja and were rewarded with an entertaining game. Arce employed a fluid formation alternating seamlessly from a 4-4-1-1 to a 4-3-3 with Edgar ‘Pajaro’ Benitez playing behind Santiago Salcedo or moving wide left to allow Reinaldo Ocampo to push up on the right. It was the pace of Benitez and Ocampo that proved a constant threat during the first half dominated by the home side. Ocampo in particular found plenty of space to run at his full back as Guatemala’s playmaker Pappa stationed himself on the left and wasn’t one for tracking back. The Sol de América midfielder had the best chance of opening the scoring following a break down the left by Benitez, his cross found Ocampo who did everything right but his shot flashed onto the post.\n\nSalcedo was playing as the target man and while very competent in the build up play he was found lacking when it came to finishing, he really should have scored when Thomas Bartomeus low cross from the right found him sliding in at the near post. In the end the first goal came from a similar situation, this time Salcedo the provider. A hopeful long ball was misjudged by Guatemala’s centreback allowing the Cerro Porteño striker to get in behind the defence and cross to his club teammate Benitez for an easy tap in, his third goal in three internationals.\n\nThe second half was diluted by substitutions as is the case with these friendly encounters, but there was still several chances for the albirroja. Luis Cardozo, on as a sub for Julio Manzur, hit the post with a header early on and when the ball came back into the box he was unmarked at the back post only to poke his shot into the side netting. The most notable performance of the second half however was from Nacional’s Ariel Bogado who had replaced Benitez. His link up play was excellent, finding space between the midfield and defence to bring in players around him particularly Jorge Mendoza and Eric Ramos who both applied themselves well in midfield. Ariel Bogado got his reward when Ocampo (otherwise absent in the second period) was brought down in area the 69th minute and the 28-year-old converted from the spot, his first international goal.\n\nGuatemala did find a consolation, an ugly defensive mix up between Tobias Vargas and his centre backs saw the ball loop out kindly to Carlos Ruiz who volleyed home as the game ended 2-1. Overall a good performance from Paraguay, they looked to keep possession where they could but had studied their opponents weaknesses and employed more direct measures when necessary. Next up is Panama at La Olla on the 29th of this month.\n\nParaguay XI (4-4-1-1)\n\nJ.Silva; T.Bartomeus, J.Manzur, P.Aguilar, R.Salinas; R.Ocampo, E.Ramos, M.Riveros, J.Mendoza; E.Benitez; S.Salcedo\n\nSubs: L.Cardozo for J.Manzur, A.Bogado for E.Benitez, F.Oviedo for E.Ramos, T.Vargas for J.Silva, J.Rojas for S.Salcedo, E.Orzusa for J.Mendoza\n\nYellow Cards: S.Salcedo, R.Ocampo\n\n===================================================\n\nOFF THE RECORD\n\nThe future is bright\n\nAs a preview to the game the Paraguay U17s side faced the Interligas U17s champions Ovetense (from Coronel Oviedo). A thoroughly fun game to watch with both sides fielding some exciting future talent. Paraguay went into the break two goals up the first from Sol de América’s Cristian Vargas who showed coolness in front of goal to dummy then lift the ball over the keeper. They doubled their lead through Denis Toledo who was set up by Vargas’ cross. The real star of the first half though was Paraguay’s number 10 playing like a classic ‘diez’ behind the strikers, Ismael Reyes has a nice touch, great movement and excellent awareness. It was Ovetenses’s César Giménez who turned the game on its head with two strikes in the second half, one a penalty the other a good finish to end the move he had started. This talented teenager was only denied a hattrick by an good save having jinked past two defenders.\n\nParaguay U17s XI (4-3-1-2)\n\nM.Mereles; A.Martinez, A.Duarte, D.Marin, J.Sanabria; D.Toledo, C.Garay, R.Tandi; C.Vargas; I.Reyes, A.Benitez\n\nSUBS: J.Samaniego for A.Martinez, J.Merida for A.Benitez, A.Almirón for I.Reyes, M.Durán for C.Vargas, F.Gonzalez for R.Tandi\n\nGuatemala Gallery\n\nFor more photos from the game taken by Paraguay Football check out this Guatemalan website\n\nWell done APF\n\nTicket prices for last night’s game started at 5.000 guaraníes or just over US$1.00 – the Paraguayan FA have clearly learned their lesson having charged 8 times as much last winter (European summer) for Paraguay vs Romania which drew a crowd in the hundreds.\n\nWisecrack of the Week\n\nA very annoying girl who kept screaming at players during the game was put in her place towards the final with a stinging one-liner: “No juega Pipino, Ña Tora – tranquilo nomás”\n\nFraternal Rivalry\n\nI love this photo of two brothers, one in his Cerro Porteño shirt and one in his Olimpia shirt at the game last night.\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nParaguay vs Guatemala\n\nEstadio Feliciano Caceres\n\n22/02/12, 20.30 hs (23.30 hs GMT)\n\nParaguay’s casera outfit play their second friendly in a week having successfully overcome Chile 2-0 in the same stadium last Wednesday. The historic game is the first ever international match involving two Paraguayan coaches, Guatemala’s recent rise in fortunes has been thanks to ex-Paraguay goalkeeper Ever Almeida who won 2 Copa Libertadores titles as a player with Olimpia. It is unlikely he will be on the winning side tonight however, Paraguay will be strong favourites going into this one.\n\nLast week Edgar Benitez and José Ortigoza got their names on the scoresheet and expect them to be key figures again this evening, Benitez has been excellent on the left wing for his club and Ortigoza is in a rich vein of form scoring four goals in his last four games. In terms of young talent the right winger Jorge Rojas (called up due to Rodolfo Gamarra’s injury) was our Player of the Week during round three of the Apertura. The 19-year-old will look to run at defenders and supply crosses to Ortigoza and his likely partner Santiago Salcedo.\n\nGuatemala bring a strong side to this friendly owing to the quality of the opposition, we’ve been told by our Guatemalan expert that Pappa drives the team in midfielder while Jerez offers security in goal. The main man to look out for up top is Ruiz. They come into the game having won their last six encounters albeit against the likes of Belize and Grenada. Paraguay themselves are eight games unbeaten at home, the last reverse a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Chile. In terms of home friendlies it is almost 13 years that they last tasted defeat. Expect that record to stay intact.\n\nPREDICTION: Paraguay to continue good form in friendlies against weaker opposition, 3-0\n\nSELECTED ODDS: Paraguay win 1.29, Draw 5.7, Guatemala win 15.5, Over 2.5 goals 1.91, Paraguay/Paraguay 1.85, 3-0 win 8.2\n\nBEST BET: Not much value on the outright win, I like the Paraguay/Paraguay bet seeing that they have scored in the first half in 4 of their last 6 friendlies\n\nPOSSIBLE XI (4-4-2)\n\nJ.Silva; T.Barthomeus, L.Cardozo, J.Manzur, R.Salinas; J. Rojas, E.Ramos, F.Oviedo, E.Benitez; S. Salcedo, J.Ortigoza\n\n===========================================================\n\nSTATS\n\nParaguay record in Luque: Pld 3 W 1 D 1 L 1 GF 2 GA 2\n\nParaguay record vs Guatemala: Pld 6 W 5 D 1 L 0 GF 14 GA 5\n\nParaguay home record (since 2011): Pld 6 W 3 D 3 L 0 GF 7 GA 2\n\n==========================================================\n\nFull Squad list\n\nGK: Tobías Vargas (Luque), Joel Silva (Guaraní)\n\nDEF: Tomás Bartomeus (Guaraní), Pablo Aguilar (Sportivo Luqueño), Julio Manzur (Guaraní), Luis Cardozo (Cerro Porteño), Richard Salinas (Independiente)\n\nMID: Reinaldo Ocampo (Sol de América), Jorge Mendoza (Guaraní), Edgardo Orzusa (Sol de América), Eric Ramos (Rubio Ñu), Marcos Riveros (Nacional), Fidencio Oviedo (Cerro Porteño), Jorge Rojas (Cerro Porteño)\n\nATT: Edgar Benítez (Cerro Porteño), Santiago Salcedo (Cerro Porteño), José Ortigoza (Sol de América), Ariel Bogado (Nacional).\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nAuthors Note: All odds correct at time of writing via Betfair"
