        "text": "\"I will help,\" says Thomas quietly.\n\n\"I spent time studying the covenant charter that my parens brought with her when we went into hiding. I think we should make sure we add a few things to your list:\n\n\"Outline the covenants rights on resources including common vis sources, unclaimed and undisputed as well as claimed. A stance on books, magical items, money, chattel, buildings, and inhabitants that we might get when working on covenant business.\n\n\"We should probably write out something on censure and and expulsion. I hope it never comes to that, but one doesn't know.\n\n\"I also wonder if we need to define roles a bit more. Do we have a protected person status for someone who joins us for a time be they magus or mundane? Do we grant a voting or non-voting position on the council to a mundane who leads our mundanes? Do we create a probationary status to those who might wish to join us in the future?\n\n\"Janus is right about the responsibility of carrying out work for the covenant. Do we compensate for that work with a vis stipend depending on the risk as Janus outlines?\n\n\"Many things to think about, but I am happy to help get the charter going.\""
