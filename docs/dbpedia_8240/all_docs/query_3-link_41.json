        "text": "Ever since my PhD, which focused on patterns in and consequences of the distribution of body sizes in food webs, a recurring theme of my research has been, and still is, on various aspects of food webs. Here I often use theoretical approaches, such as mathematical modelling, to study consequences of trophic interactions on populations as well as community structure and function.\n\nDuring the last decade, much of my research has fallen under four separate but still related main themes (see below for details):\n\nAdvancing the Metabolic theory of Ecology as a predictor of ecological phenomena on various levels\n\nCombining geographical information systems (GIS) with an ecological model to assess conditions for biological diversity at the landscape level\n\nAdvanced understanding of ecosystem functioning through food web ecology (in close collaboration with SLU)\n\nIncreased understanding of fishes in the great lakes of Sweden using a food web approach (in collaborationn with SLU and the county adminsistrative board)\n\nTheoretical approaches, such as mathematical modelling, is an important part of these projects. Theoretical research should, however, not live a life of its own, at some point there must be an interaction between theory and empirical observation. The research I carry out fulfills this requirement by using a mixture of theoretical and experimental techniques as well as empirically observed field data.\n\nDegrees\n\nProfessor in Ecology, University of Skövde, 2019\n\nAssociate Professor of Theoretical ecology, University of Skövde, 2007\n\nPhD, Linköping University, 1998\n\nBSc, Linköping University, 1990\n\nResearcher identity\n\nORCID: 0000-0002-5234-9576\n\nResearcher ID: G-1787-2013\n\nAcademic positions\n\n2019 - : Professor in Bioscience with specialization in Theoretical Ecology at the division of Biology and Bioinformatics, School of BioScience, University of Skövde.\n\n2017 - 2019 : Lecturer and Associate Professor in Theoretical Ecology at the division of Ecology, School of BioScience, University of Skövde.\n\n2012 – 2016: Researcher in Theoretical Population Ecology at the Dept. of Ecology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Uppsala.\n\n2001 – 2012: Assistant professor in Theoretical Ecology (Universitetslektor i Teoretisk ekologi) at the division of Ecology, School of Life Sciences, University of Skövde.\n\n1999 – 2000: Postdoctoral Associate at the Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.\n\n1998: lecturer (vik.
