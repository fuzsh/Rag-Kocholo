        "text": "The immense diversity of indigenous languages in South America has led to a rich lexicographic production since colonial times, when some of the widespread languages were used for purposes of Christian missionary work. The period of the first dictionaries of Quechua, Aymara, Guaraní, and “Língua Geral” in Brazil is followed by the missionary lexicography of further languages in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Dictionaries compiled by linguists, from the SIL and from national universities, begin to appear since the 1950s. In recent years the concern about the increasing number of endangered languages is resulting in more and more comprehensive dictionaries of small hitherto unknown languages, especially of Amazonia. Typological characteristics as well as problems of semantics and pragmatics are the focus of linguistic studies. Ethnolinguists are increasingly involved in teaching programs, which very often include projects of dictionaries to be elaborated together with the indigenous communities. The modern dictionaries of all relevant languages in South America are presented in this chapter."
