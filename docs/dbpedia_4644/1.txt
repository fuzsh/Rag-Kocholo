Final Fantasy Versus XIII is an upcoming action-RPG for the PlayStation 3. Alongside Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Final Fantasy Type-0, it makes up Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy, although it shares no connections to the other games in the project apart from the mythology.

Final Fantasy Versus XIII was announced at E3 2006 along with Final Fantasy XIII. It was first developed using the Crystal Tools engine until in September 2011 it was announced that Versus had moved to a game-specific engine.
