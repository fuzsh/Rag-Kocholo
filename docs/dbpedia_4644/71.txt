Speaking with Game Informer, he hinted the series - which currently consists of Final Fantasy XIII for PS3 and 360, Final Fantasy Versus XIII for PS3 and Final Fantasy Agito XIII for PSP - could still see more games on the way.

All he would say on it was:

"Please look forward to future announcements."
