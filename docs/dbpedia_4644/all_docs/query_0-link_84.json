        "text": "The exclusivity of Final Fantasy Versus XIII on PlayStation 3 is in question yet again. A recent job listing seeking a “Battle Planner” to work on the game is asking that those who be knowledgeable in both level and battle design and have “development experience on a PS3, or Xbox 360 package title”.\n\nIt’s a bit odd to require experience in developing an Xbox 360 title for a PlayStation 3 exclusive game, isn’t it? This fuels speculation.\n\nBack in September, game director Tetusya Nomura hinted at the game going multiplatform, suggesting that a port would be done for an Xbox 360 version, however, reaffirming that the game is being developed “specifically for the PlayStation 3.”\n\nA press conference on Final Fantasy Versus XIII as well Fabula Nova Crystallis’ other entry Final Fantasy Agito XIII is scheduled for January 11, 2011. We can expect to hear whether or not the game will go multiplatform then."
