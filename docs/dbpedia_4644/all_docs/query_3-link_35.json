Chosen by the faeries to sacrifice themselves to the Mana Tree, \"alms\" are selected to go on a pilgrimage with \"soul guards\" to protect them. Val is one such soul guard, and his childhood friend Hinna is appointed as an alm. As they travel, they encounter others chosen as alms, recruiting them to their party. They'll also encounter the fearsome Benevodons, powerful and otherworldly beasts that are aligned with the eight elements. Elemental Aeries can be found across the world, where players can take on special challenges with certain rules to complete difficult trials.

It’s been fifteen years since the last all-new entry, which is plenty of time to create something fresh for the franchise. Thus, we find ourselves with Visions of Mana – a game that promises to offer that fresh experience for returning fans while still creating something exciting for newcomers. Visions of Mana begins with the introduction of Tianeea, a village preparing for the coming of the Faerie and naming of something known as an “alm”. This alm is chosen to revive the Tree of Mana on a four-year basis by sacrificing their souls. But before all of this, the game eases into itself with a prologue of sorts, one that ends in tragedy, and shows us that the world isn’t as pleasant as its colorful designs make it seem. It’s following this tutorial that the story truly begins. Our main character, Val, is a soul guard - someone with a rare ability - who must accompany the chosen alm on their journey, but to his surprise it’s his friend Hinna who ends up getting chosen to\n\nIn Life is Strange Double Exposure, players assume the role of Max Caulfield, the protagonist of the first game in the series. Max is now a photographer-in-residence at Caledon University, and when her friend Safi is suddenly murdered, new powers awaken within her. Using the ability to shift between timelines where Safi lives or dies, Max needs to find the culprit before they strike again. In the trailer below, we get an extended look at how these powers function and impact the narrative. Max can move through environments and find items that only exist in one timeline. Since Safi's death is the centrifugal event, people will in different mental states in each timeline, and will help Max learn more about them or their potential motives. The game will visually represent which timeline Max is in, but the information she learns may help or hinder how she responds in certain situations. Life is Strange Double Exposure will release on October 29th, 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and the Windows Store. Pre-ordering the Ultimate Edition will allow you to play the game two weeks early on October 15th. A Nintendo Switch release is planned for a later announcement.
