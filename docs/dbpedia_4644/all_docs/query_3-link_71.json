        "text": "So early last gen Square Enix laid out their plan to usher FF into the HD era of gaming by announcing Fabula Nova Crystalis, a brand new compilation in the vein of the FFVII compilation that was meant to offer what was essentially multiple versions of FFXIII. Things didn't quite pan out the way SE planned.\n\nAnyways, I didn't make this topic with the intention of discussing the quality of specific games in FNC (though any other posters are free to do that here), what I want to talk about is how the concept behind this compilation never made any sense to me even before any of its games came out.\n\nSo when FNC was announced, SE explained it as a series of FF games that didn't take place in the same universe (unlike the Ivalice Alliance) but are linked by similiar terminology, themes, and mythos with different interpretations. My problem here is that this is something that mainline FF was already doing since almost the beginning. Mythos, terms, and even characters were things that were already being shared between FFs despite taking place in different continuities. Even the name, which translates to New Tale of the Crystal (SE was really huge on latin during this time) didn't resonate with me because every FF game features a new plot where crystals play an important, if not central role.\n\nThis is a big part of why I feel FNC floundered as a concept and basically just became \"The Lightning Trilogy\". It's very hard to sell a multi-media project to people when none of it even came out yet. But when the explanation for it is something that doesn't sound like anything new or exciting that makes it tougher. Imagine if FFXIII was marketed and released as its own thing other FFs but then later on FFXVI or whatever made a reference to Fal'cie or Etro in its plot. Would anybody have found that weird in comparison to the rest of the series? No! XII had summons that were named after final bosses of previous FFs and nobody even blinked at that.\n\nFFVII comp. made sense because FFVII already existed and proved itself as an extremely popular property. Ivalice Alliance made sense because multiple games taking place in Ivalice were already a thing and SE was just making things formal. FNC just didn't at all.\n\nI just wanted to know if anyone was on the same page as me about this.\n\nP.S. Did we ever find out what the hell Heraesis XIII was going to be?\n\nThe only thing I learned from the FNC was moms are tough\n\nThey def are\n\nI think a big part of the issue is that all three games had terrible development cycles (and even if they want to say the games weren't in the same universe, it feels very apparent that Type 0 and XIII were to some degree).\n\nYeah: http://www.rpgfan.com/features/Fina.../Crystal-Tools-Without-A-Craftsman/index.html\n\nIt's weird when you can tell a game went through development hell and it almost never succeeds after it (or it does with diminishing returns).\n\nWorking on Crystal Tools devoured years of Final Fantasy XIII's development time. While media outlets were fed tidbits of information about the Dyson Sphere-esque world of Cocoon, the outlying world of Pulse, and the mechanical gods known as fal'Cie, nobody realized that Toriyama's team was struggling to come up with a gameplay system to support the characters and lore they had envisioned during the PS2 days. It wasn't until the team was called upon to make a demo, which would be shipped with Japanese copies of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete, that there was clarity. According to Toriyama, having to create this vertical slice of gameplay for the demo solidified the team's vision and enabled them to finally start moving forward on the game's creation...a mere six months before its Japanese release date. If you've ever wondered why Final Fantasy XIII was so linear, this is likely the answer: Toriyama would later admit that the game was rushed through production following the release of the demo.\n\nI definitely agree that they put Waaaaaaay too many eggs in one basket. .hack// learned a tough lesson that gamers might not be interested in a game series told across 4 parts (worse yet since the games weren't that dramatically different from one another); FNC put a lot of stock on its showroom footage with very little output in the end --- it was a big ol' vanity project. It looked pretty but it just didn't do enough of what games were supposed to do: Play well.\n\nIt was a tall order to expect fans to stay interested if something...so average.\n\nI mean it's not like FF15 didn't take up the reigns, name change or not, it has some related title on just about every piece of media.\n\nIt's a cool idea, but so far it just feels incredibly disjointed in practice; FF15 feels 'incomplete' in ways since parts of the story seem to have been left on the cutting room floor or scattered in books, youtube videos, movies, games, multiple DLC episodes/seasons, mobile titles and more.\n\nI think the model of having spin-offs that have something of the quality of a numbered game was a good idea at the time - Type-0 is more interesting than a lot of FF spin-offs even if it isn't perfect - but at the moment, when there's a paucity of numbered games and portable hardware has now completely shifted over to HD... it would probably make more sense to just brand such projects as numbered games. I'm not really convinced the FNC mythology would have added much value across the games either, even though it was somewhat interesting.\n\nI think that's the other things that kills this for me: L'cie and Fal'cie and Etro and the GODS and all that whatnot are...interesting..but not THAT interesting and then the games stories were even messier to digest.\n\nBasing a whole slew of games around a similar mythology (but not really) was just... blah.\n\nI mean at least decent games came out of the whole thing; and I think that's the sorta end-result here. It was okay, but a really messy series of releases that changed goals in light of the mess they made.\n\nSo early last gen Square Enix laid out their plan to usher FF into the HD era of gaming by announcing Fabula Nova Crystalis, a brand new compilation in the vein of the FFVII compilation that was meant to offer what was essentially multiple versions of FFXIII.

Did we ever find out what the hell Heraesis XIII was going to be?\n\nSquare has repeatedly tried this and failed every time. As you highlight, the FNC concept doesn't make sense at a basic level - it's already how final fantasy games work! And the notion of crystals being the centre is just odd because that's the original FF story and has been reused every time to some degree or another.\n\nWhat I would point out, which I know annoys people, is that the shared world of Ivalice is just as nonsensical a concept. How anyone can look at FFT and FF12 and think there's some deep and significant connection between them is beyond me. Barring the presence of a few optional espers the games are completely seperate.\n\nSquare has repeatedly tried this and failed every time.

Barring the presence of a few optional espers the games are completely seperate.\n\nYeah Ivalice Alliance's problem is that there's a time gap between 12/TA2 and the original Tactics that's so huge that non-hume races are seemingly extinct during Ramza's time. It's not like the Kiseki series where everything is tight to the point where some games take place concurrently.\n\nCrystals had been a big part of FFs but unless I have totally forgotten, they weren't a huge part of FFVII, VIII and X? And it wasn't just about the \"re-introduction\" of crystals but doing something a bit new with them and bringing perhaps a bigger focus on them than even games like XII had had (crystals were a part of FFXII but kind of instrumental to political struggles and not the central focus). Usually crystals were a source of power or kinds of forces of harmony/(fantastical) nature that kept the world at balance. If crystals had some kind of sentience, it was mostly to bestow power to a destined hero who would save the world from great evil or used by that great evil to cause calamity.\n\nFNC added the whole l'cie stuff that wasn't necessarily your typical Benevolent Good Force Bestowed Upon Heroes but a twist on that formula. Crystals themselves were vessels of powerful creatures/beings fighting for power, not just sources of power like they mostly were in especially older FFs.\n\nWhy oh why oh why they initially decided to put all of FNC under the 'Final Fantasy XIII' label is beyond me. It's not even like the FFVII compilation where all the entries are (were?) canonically tied together in the same world and universe. The only thing that was to tie the FNC games together was a common shared mythology but interpreted in different ways across each game with their own individual stories. The only thing it was destined to do was confuse more casual consumers. I remember back in 2006 and how outlets struggled to try and comprehend and explain what the difference was supposed to be between FFXIII itself and FF Versus XIII.\n\nBut that was a really weird time for Square Enix. They were truly a prolific poster boy in the industry when it came to putting the cart miles ahead before the horse. By the time the horse caught up, the cart would have lost half its wheels and be entrenched in mud.\n\nCrystals had been a big part of FFs but unless I have totally forgotten, they weren't a huge part of FFVII, VIII and X?

Also the vessels angle was explored in 6 and pretty central to the plot with genocide based on magicite."
