        "text": "Em is back from the month off to talk about the joy of a kind of cheesy mystery with a great sci-fi premise as we get to live out our Star Trek: The Original Series dreams by lecturing ancient peoples about how our modern world view is clearly the best one. This sounds like it’s selling The Forgotten City short, but I promise it isn’t, we really liked this game. Sometimes good things are also kind of silly things, is all, and we delight in the silliness in this episode.\n\nThings Discussed: Dwarf Fortress, Neon White, Jackson's MMO Summer, The Forgotten City, Immortals of Aveum\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: A Bonus Final Fantasy XI episode, and then Mister Mosquito at the end of the month!\n\nRead More\n\nThis month it’s just me, Jackson, being joined by Crystal to play Citizen Sleeper. Em is currently in Hospital after major surgery and so I’m taking over and organizing the podcasts while they recover! Please send them well wishes. It’s time to talk about RPG systems, and the strange act of critiquing leftist video games that you mostly agree with. I think this is a good discussion about a fun game and I hope everyone enjoys it!\n\nRead More\n\nWe enjoy one of the major modern attempts at making a Pokemon-style monster collecting and battling RPG with Cassette Beasts. We talk about surprising scope of the world, the intense battle system, what your numbers say about your priorities, the weirdness of dating mechanics, and much more! This game was a great surprise and a huge delight, so please check it out!\n\nThings Discussed: Doom 4, Summer Games Fest, baffling Square Enix decisions, Cassette Beasts, Pokemon, rpg battle mechanics, open world design, dating mechanics\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: The Forgotten City\n\nRead More\n\nWe find ourselves doing grunt work for Atrus once more as our favorite self-published author and god of his own realms begins reaping what he’s sown over the last two games. We solve some puzzles, enjoy Brad Dourif, and talk about the kind of guy who keeps going around birthing entire worlds. Exile was good fun, happy to dip back into the world of Myst once again.\n\nThings Discussed: Balatro, Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, Blinx: The Time Sweeper, Panzer Dragoon, Shinobi, Shadow Dancer, The Revenge of Shinobi, Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi, The Cyber Shinobi, The G.G.

Not exactly divisive that we enjoy these types of games, but the generational split is very real as we talk about these two classics of game. Join us, for a walk down memory lane (Sega edition).\n\nThings Discussed: Roboquest, NiER: Reincarnation, Final Fantasy XVI: The Rising Tide, Needy Streamer Overload, Blazing Lazers, Felvidek, Binding of Isaac, Dynamite Headdy, Ristar, Gunstar Heroes, Beyond Oasis, Zelda, Angry Video Game Nerd\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: Myst III: Exile\n\nRead More\n\nWe finish our long Final Fantasy adventure by playing Square’s largest single player Final Fantasy yet. But does size equal quality? Does it equal ambition? We have many thoughts about this and about where the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake Project has gone and is heading in this enormous podcast about an equally enormous game.\n\nThings Discussed: Balatro, Cosmo Cheats at Poker, Rise of the Ronin, Jackson's piece on the ending of FF7 Rebirth, Jackson's Rise of the Ronin review, Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, every other Final Fantasy on earth but ones with specific spoilers include: Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Intergrade, and Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X-2, Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV, Final Fantasy XVI\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: Beyond Oasis and Dynamite Headdy\n\nRead More\n\nWe’re joined by Molly for the return of one of the classics, a guy who just needs to jump over every spike in all the world, conveniently located in a beautiful palace. That’s right, we’re here to talk about the return of Prince of Persia, and the surprising ways Ubisoft have melded the last ten years of exceptional platforming games into something with its own identity\n\nThings Discussed: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Granblue Fantasy: Relink and Granblue Fantasy, Pseudoregalia, Iconoclasts, Monster World IV, Prince of Persia, Immortality, Another Code: Recollection, Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, a bunch of Metroidvania stuff broadly\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\nRead More\n\nWe interrupt your regularly scheduled coverage with a special announcement: Jackson has played the Final Fantasy XIII games, at last. Despite the frankly illegal amount of Final Fantasy content lately they were not going to let that go to waste. They are joined by Erin (@Woodabris, Woodaba on Youtube) to discuss the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, with a little Type 0 in there. It’s time to get remember: Fabula Nova Crystallis.\n\nRead More\n\nWe’re going back to the heady days of licensed multi-platform games in the early 00s this month as we play 007: Everything or Nothing and talk about the era of arcane save processes, weird genre mashups, awful final missions, and the ways in which the whole medium could turn on a relatively short dime to become something new. Was this game an unheralded prelude to the next-gen era? Maybe! We talk about it.\n\nThings Discussed: Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Final Fantasy Type-0, Final Fantasy XIV, GoldenEye, The Binding of Isaac, Star Ocean The Second Story R, Octopath Traveler II, 007: Everything or Nothing, 007: NightFire\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown\n\nRead More\n\nWe close out the year with a podcast years in the making, as Molly joins us and we take a road trip with the king to be and his homies and play the much maligned but beloved by us Final Fantasy XV! This podcast will cover the main game and the first three episode DLCs (Gladio, Prompto, Ignis), and there’ll be a follow up podcast on the patreon (free for everyone) in about a week covering the movie, the anime, Episode Ardyn, and the Awful Book.

Some of them are reasonable critiques, some of them are just the unfortunate realities of game production, some are just The Times. I think the array of responses and games really makes for a solid episode however, and I hope you’ll agree!\n\nThings Discussed: Signalis, Heretic, Jusant, Valis III, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog, Super Mario Bros Wonder, The Red Lantern, Firewatch, Beton Brutal, Getting Over It, Inertial Drift, production values in video games, Silent Bomber, the PSX aesthetic, Sean Seanson's video on Silent Bomber, TheGamingBritShow's video on Silent Bomber, petting the dog, Oboe Shoes Games a guy we like a lot, watch Em and Dia play The Dagger of Amon Ra\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: Final Fantasy XV and the four Episode DLCs\n\nRead More\n\nWe’ve been doing this for ten years!

Ambitious in a way few other games in this space are.\n\nThings Discussed: Paradise Killer, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, El Viento, Top Gear 2, Donkey Kong 94, getting into the weeds about Donkey Kong, Demon Turf, 3D Mario games, Spark 3, 3D Sonic games, Lunistice\n\nNext Month’s Game Club: Shenmue\n\nRead More\n\nWe’re back with one of the obvious classics of all time, a game neither of us had played before this month but came like a lighting strike into our lives with its charm and brevity and interesting vision of early 3D RPG design.

We have a brief RPG checkin first, nothing especially spoiler-heavy so don’t worry if you’re not also 7 games into Kiseki, but the Muv Luv sequence is, of course, exceedingly spoiler heavy by nature.\n\nThings Discussed: Kiseki, Persona, Donkey Kong Country 3, Octopath Traveler 2, Muv Luv Extra, Muv Luv Unlimited, Muv Luv Alternative\n\nThis Month’s Game Club: Mega Man Legends\n\nRead More\n\nWe’re joined by post-gamer and friend of the show Austin Walker to talk about the latest and greatest in the long running Final Fantasy series. That’s right, it’s Clive time! Join us as we try to grapple with this large action RPG and talk mostly about its story and themes.
