        "text": "The Final Fantasy series is one of the oldest in the gaming industry, with the first release dating back to 1987. Since then, the series has spanned nearly every platform and genre. Keeping up with all of the main releases, sub-games, and spinoffs is enough to make anyone confused. Fortunately, through extensive research and my own personal history, I’ve collated all of the info on each Final Fantasy title so we can answer just how many there are.\n\nEvery main Final Fantasy game released\n\nNow, there are a lot of Final Fantasy games. 136 of them, in fact. So, before I get to breaking down the numbers, there are going to be some rules established. Without rules, we’re no better than malboros.\n\nRelease dates are for Japan unless otherwise noted due to funky North American release dates.\n\nRe-releases and ports do not count unless there is a significant change, like an HD remake.\n\nExpansions and DLC aren’t counted as separate releases. This includes re-releases of XI and XIV where expansions are bundled in with the base game.\n\nI’m only counting games that have actually been released. In-development titles, canceled titles, and standalone demos don’t count.\n\nSpin-offs and sequels are grouped with the originating title where applicable.\n\nThe SaGa series is not included despite having the Final Fantasy label in NA. This is because they had no Final Fantasy branding when originally released in Japan.\n\nFinal Fantasy (1987)\n\nThis is where it all started. Players took control of four Warriors of Light in order to rescue a princess from Garland before setting off on an epic adventure to defeat the Four Fiends and save the world.\n\nFinal Fantasy Pixel Remaster (2021)\n\nInitial Platform: NES\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy II (1988)\n\nFinal Fantasy II introduced several staples familiar to fans of the series, including chocobos and Cid. Rather than having nameless characters, this sequel brought about an original cast of characters led by Firion in their fight against Emperor Mateus.\n\nFinal Fantasy II Pixel Remaster (2021)\n\nInitial Platform: NES\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy III (1990)\n\nNot to be confused with the re-release of Final Fantasy VI in NA, the true version of Final Fantasy III went back to having nameless protagonists. Starting off as Onion Knights, these new Warriors of Light could specialize via the job system.\n\nFinal Fantasy III (3D remake) (2006)\n\nFinal Fantasy III Pixel Remaster (2021)\n\nInitial Platform: NES\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy IV (1991)\n\nFinal Fantasy IV was released in NA as Final Fantasy II. It flops back to using an entirely original cast centered around Cecil Harvey. Another series staple, the Active Time Battle system (ATB), was introduced with this entry.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV (3D remake) (2007)\n\nFinal Fantasy IV: The After Years (2008)\n\nFinal Fantasy IV: Interlude\n\nFinal Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster (2021)\n\nInitial Platform: SNES\n\nTotal Games: 5\n\nFinal Fantasy V (1992)\n\nBartz Klauser and his entourage must contend with Exdeath and stop him from releasing the power of the Void upon an unsuspecting world. Fan favorites like the Blue Mage job and Gilgamesh made their first appearances in the fifth outing.\n\nFinal Fantasy V Pixel Remaster (2021)\n\nInitial Platform: SNES\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy VI (1994)\n\nWith the release of Final Fantasy VI, the series was starting to gain a real following. Featuring an unforgettable ensemble, Terra and Locke form the heart of a party battling against the insidious Kefka. FF VI put more of a focus on summons through Espers and introduced an early form of the Limit Break with Desperation Attacks.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster (2022)\n\nInitial Platform: SNES\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy VII (1997)\n\nThere’s not a person on Earth who isn’t at least vaguely familiar with the blonde spikey hair of Cloud Strife. With the release of Final Fantasy VII, the series made the jump to 3D and introduced dilemmas such as “Tifa or Aerith?” and “Is Sephiroth really this evil if he’s this hot?” Square Enix has been capitalizing on this ever since, as this particular entry has more tie-ins than any other title in the series.\n\nBefore Crisis: Final Fantasy VII (2004)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Snowboarding (2005)\n\nDirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII (2006)\n\nDirge of Cerberus Lost Episode: Final Fantasy VII (2006)\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII (2008)\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion (2022)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII G-Bike (2014)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake (2020 Worldwide)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (2021 Worldwide)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: The First Soldier (2021 Worldwide)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis (2023 Worldwide)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 11\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII (1999)\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII is where I got my start in the Final Fantasy series. It might not be a fan favorite, but it’s mine. Squall and company trade their memories for power to take down a witch spanning multiple points in time. Also introduced was the gunblade, whose existence is allowed only by the “rule of cool.”\n\nChocobo World (1999)\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII Remastered (2019)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy IX (2000)\n\nFinal Fantasy IX was Final Fantasy‘s swan song on the PlayStation 1 and definitely went out on a high note. Returning to the medieval setting and taking plenty of inspiration from various legendary tales, FF IX re-established the roots of the series and delighted both longtime fans and newcomers.\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy X (2001)\n\nMaking the leap to the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy X boasted stunning visuals and an engrossing battle system alongside the Sphere Grid. FF X was also the first in the main series to get a direct sequel, which pivoted from Tidus to Yuna as the main character.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 (2003)\n\nFinal Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster (2013)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation 2\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy XI (2002)\n\nTaking the series in a daring new direction, Final Fantasy XI was the first MMORPG for the franchise. By creating their own unique character, players could team up with one another to explore the world of Vana’diel across several different platforms.\n\nFinal Fantasy Grandmasters (2015)\n\nInitial Platforms: PC, PlayStation 2\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy XII (2006)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII tried several new ideas, with some being more successful than others. The Gambit system automated combat and could be made more intricate as the game went on. Random encounters were removed and systems such as a day-and-night cycle and weather were introduced.\n\nFinal Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System (2007)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings (2007)\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age (2017)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation 2\n\nTotal Games: 4\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII (2009)\n\nOtherwise known as the world’s longest tutorial, Final Fantasy XIII jumped to the next generation and was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Initially developed under the Fabula Nova Crystallis banner alongside two other entries (that would later become Type-0 and XV), FF XIII returned to the sci-fi setting and wowed players with an enhanced Gambit system and stunning visuals. This was enough for it to become the first dedicated trilogy in the series.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 (2011)\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (2013)\n\nInitial Platforms: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV (2010 Worldwide)\n\nDeciding to dip its toes back into the MMORPG pool, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XIV, which was absolutely blasted by fans and critics alike. SE would go on to issue an official apology and would relaunch the game as A Realm Reborn with the in-game story being that Bahamut destroyed the world (the first version of the game) and now we’re starting over. It was super clever and since then, critics and fans have been in love.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (2013 Worldwide)\n\nInitial Platform: PC\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy XV (2016 Worldwide)\n\nLike a fine wine, Final Fantasy XV aged from a companion to Final Fantasy XIII to its own release. By this point, game updates and additional content had become commonplace and Square Enix leaned into the practice with FF XV. Second only to FF VII in terms of spin-offs and sequels, FF XV was Square Enix’s attempt to build another engrossing world.\n\nJustice Monsters Five (2016 Worldwide)\n\nA King’s Tale: Final Fantasy XV (2016 Worldwide)\n\nMonster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV (2017 Worldwide)\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: A New Empire (2017 Worldwide)\n\nKing’s Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon (2017)\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition (2018 Worldwide)\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition (2018)\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: Windows Edition (2018)\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: War for Eos (2022 Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines)\n\nInitial Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n\nTotal Games: 10\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI (2023 Worldwide)\n\nJumping ahead another generation, this PlayStation 5 exclusive title is the first “Mature” rated Final Fantasy. The story deals with far darker tones as players fight against slavery on several different levels. FF XVI is a cinematic juggernaut that plays more like an action game than the series’ RPG roots, and is another great step forward for the franchise.\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation 5\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nEvery non-mainline Final Fantasy game\n\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin (2022 Worldwide)\n\nIs it a spin-off? Is it a prequel? Is it a reimagining? No one, not even the developers, seems to know quite what Stranger of Paradise was supposed to be. What we received was a super-edgy action game with dialogue even worse than an ’80s B-movie. Maybe it’s time to rein in Tetsuya Nomura?\n\nInitial Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics (1997)\n\nSet in the familiar land of Ivalice, Final Fantasy Tactics eschewed the traditional battle mechanics of the series in favor of a more tactical system. Utilizing the Job system, players were able to customize characters to form the perfect party. This formula was a smash hit and cleared the way for several more entries in this sub-series.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions (2007)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance (2003)\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift (2007)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 4\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics S (2013)\n\nThis short-lived mobile title was only available in Japan for a little over a year. Players would pick a Job, join a clan, and duke it out with other clans or monsters in an automated battle.\n\nInitial Platforms: Android, iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 (2011)\n\nThe third part in the initially proposed Final Fantasy XIII series spun off into its own title. Players took control of students whose playstyles were determined by their weapons. The original PSP release supported drop-in/drop-out functionality but this was never carried over into other versions.\n\nFinal Fantasy Agito (2014)\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 HD (2015)\n\nFinal Fantasy Awakening (2016 China)\n\nTotal Games: 4\n\nFinal Fantasy Artniks (2012)\n\nWith the initial release being supported for only two years and the sequel for two years after that, Artniks was a bit of a flash in the pan. Both titles were published through GREE which primarily operates in Japan. The first title was a card-collecting game, whereas the second was a dungeon-crawler RPG that utilized cards and Final Fantasy characters.\n\nFinal Fantasy Artniks Dive (2014)\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy Brave Exvius (2015)\n\nThis mobile title has players progressing the story through checkpoints where the party, made up of various characters from the Final Fantasy series, must battle various monsters. The first spin-off, Tap!, was available on Facebook before shutting down in 2019. The second spin-off, War of the Visions, serves as a prequel to the original game.\n\nFinal Fantasy Brave Exvius Tap! (2017 Worldwide)\n\nWar of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius (2019)\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (2003)\n\nFinal Fantasy came back home to Nintendo after a nine-year departure with the release of Crystal Chronicles for the GameCube. The immensely popular title allowed Square Enix to make three sequels, two prequels, and an HD remake of the original.\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates (2007)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King (2008)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord (2009)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time (2009)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers (2009)\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition (2020)\n\nTotal Games: 7\n\nCrystal Defenders (2008)\n\nThis Crystal (Tower) Defense series of games was available on mobile in addition to a few consoles before ultimately being shut down in 2019. Players that still have an iPod Nano or Xbox 360 with it installed might want to be careful with them, as there is no way to download any of the three games any longer.\n\nCrystal Defenders +Plus (2008)\n\nCrystal Defenders: Vanguard Storm (2009 Worldwide)\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy Dimensions (2010)\n\nDimensions was an episodic series of stories focusing on the forces of Light and Dark fighting over crystals. Players utilize Jobs and the ATB system to defeat opponents and move on to the next episode.\n\nFinal Fantasy Legends II (2014)\n\nFinal Fantasy Dimensions II (2015)\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy (2008)\n\nThis PSP-exclusive fighting game was just an excuse to allow players to battle with Final Fantasy characters. The prequel, Dissidia 012, expanded on the roster and honed the gameplay. Just to mess with me, Team Ninja released a different Dissidia Final Fantasy in Japanese arcades that would later be ported as Dissidia Final Fantasy NT. Not wanting to leave mobile out of the mix, Opera Omnia went for the classic JRPG battle system.\n\nDissidia 012 Final Fantasy (2011)\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy (2015)\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia (2017)\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy NT (2018)\n\nTotal Games: 5\n\nFinal Fantasy Explorers (2014)\n\nYou got Monster Hunter in my Final Fantasy! Long before the Monster Hunter World/FF XIV crossover, players got to take on classic Eidolons like Shiva and Ifrit alongside three friends on the Nintendo 3DS. This spawned a sequel for Japanese iOS and Android devices which flopped within a year. It’s definitely a neat idea, even if the execution was flawed.\n\nFinal Fantasy Explorers-Force (2018)\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy (2012)\n\nOne of the best parts of Final Fantasy is the music. I have personally wept like a baby at a Distant Worlds concert. This rhythm game has players taking on opponents with classic FF protagonists to timeless music.\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call (2014)\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy All-Star Carnival (2016)\n\nTheatrhythm Final Bar Line (2023 Worldwide)\n\nTotal Games: 4\n\nFinal Fantasy: Unlimited with U (2002)\n\nBased on the Final Fantasy: Unlimited anime that had a 25-episode run in 2001-2002, both games were only released in Japan. Unlimited with U was your standard RPG, only available for mobile, whereas Unlimited on PC was a card battler. These tie-ins disappeared quicker than the canceled anime and the entire universe seems to be a blip in the history of the franchise.\n\nFinal Fantasy: Unlimited on PC (2003)\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nWorld of Final Fantasy (2016)\n\nReleased as part of the 30th anniversary of the series, World of Final Fantasy was a smorgasbord of all things Final Fantasy. It followed two young siblings on their quest to befriend monsters and characters alike from the various titles. Meli-Melo was a multiplayer spin-off and Maxima was released with additional characters and stories.\n\nWorld of Final Fantasy: Meli-Melo (2017)\n\nWorld of Final Fantasy Maxima (2018)\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nFinal Fantasy Adventure (1991)\n\nFinal Fantasy Adventure is an FF title in the same way that Pete Best is a Beatle. There are some tenuous connections that were later completely severed when further remakes and sequels were branded as the Mana series. As such, I’m not counting any other entries in this series.\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Mystic Quest (1992 North America)\n\nDespite Final Fantasy Adventure being titled Mystic Quest in Europe, this version of Mystic Quest has no relation to the original title. Oh wait, Square called it Mystic Quest Legend in Europe. To make things further confusing, the developer also titled this Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest in Japan even though it was developed in Japan.\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light (2009)\n\nReleased on the Nintendo DS, The 4 Heroes was an original title with no connections to previous entries in the series. Players could equip their characters with Crowns which stood in for the Job system and play with up to three others wirelessly.\n\nInitial Platform: Nintendo DS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nVoice Fantasy (2010 Worldwide)\n\nBack when smart devices were still more of a novelty than a commonplace device, SE released Voice Fantasy. By screaming into their device, different characters were generated for the player’s army to battle against enemy units. Unfortunately, that is where the user’s input ended as everything else was automated. Voice Fantasy was ultimately a gimmick with no real staying power.\n\nInitial Platform: iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Airborne Brigade (2012)\n\nFunctioning as an itty bitty MMO for phones, Airborne Brigade was your standard FF fare. Players could team up with one another to delve into dungeons in search of loot and glory.\n\nInitial Platforms: Android, iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy All the Bravest (2013 Worldwide)\n\nAll the Bravest was a mobile app more than it was a game where users collected Jobs like a starving millennial. With the ability to form a party consisting of 40 characters, the objective was to march through familiar locales and slay familiar enemies. Unfortunately, All the Bravest was riddled with costly microtransactions which, along with the lackluster gameplay, turned off many.\n\nInitial Platform: iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nPictlogica Final Fantasy (2013)\n\nNever meant to see the light of day outside of Japan, Pictlogica was a mobile title that blended RPG mechanics with dot logic puzzles. It offered multiplayer and was popular enough to get a Nintendo 3DS remake several years later.\n\nPictlogica Final Fantasy Nearly Equal (2017)\n\nInitial Platform: iOS\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nFinal Fantasy: World Wide Words (2014)\n\nThis mobile and Japanese exclusive combined the utter brilliance of The Typing of the Dead with classic FF settings and characters. It utilized the character models from Theatrhythm and looked like an utter delight.\n\nInitial Platforms: Android, iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Record Keeper (2014)\n\nIn what is now standard fare for mobile FF titles, players take on the role of an original character as they explore dungeons from various FF titles and interact with characters like the Warrior of Light and Cloud. It’s a nice bit of nostalgia, but not much else. It was shut down in 2022.\n\nInitial Platforms: Android, iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nHeavenstrike Rivals (2014 Worldwide)\n\nInitially launched as a mobile title before being ported to PC, Heavenstrike Rivals was a tactical RPG where players could team up with one another to battle the forces of the Fallen. As is tradition, several characters from other entries could be used as playable units. The game was shut down in 2018.\n\nInitial Platform: iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Portal App (2015)\n\nThis one is definitely more of an app than a game, but since it features a fully functional version of Triple Triad, I’m including it. Beyond having the best card game in the series, Portal App contains press releases for all things FF and allows players to obtain points that can influence loot in other mobile titles.\n\nInitial Platforms: Android, iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nMobius Final Fantasy (2015)\n\nThis mobile title was an ambitious undertaking where players took control of an amnesiac Warrior of Light. By mixing tap-to-attack gameplay with match-three mechanics, players were able to fight the many enemies littered in each zone. Mobius was a gorgeous title but was brutal on batteries, even with settings turned to low. It was eventually shut down in 2020.\n\nInitial Platforms: Android, iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Digital Card Game (2019)\n\nThis flash-in-the-pan lasted only a year before getting the axe. Players in Japan could duke it out with cards after accessing the title from Yahoo! Game Plus.\n\nInitial Platform: PC (Yahoo! Game Plus)\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nFinal Fantasy Chocobo series\n\nChocobo’s Mystery Dungeon (1997)\n\nThe Chocobo’s Mystery Dungeon series is actually a spinoff of the Fushigi no Dungeon games. While the initial series features original characters, multiple franchises like Final Fantasy and Pokémon have been licensed. Since then, the Chocobo series has chugged along.\n\nChocobo’s Mystery Dungeon 2 (1998)\n\nFinal Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales (2006)\n\nFinal Fantasy Fables: Chocobo’s Dungeon (2007)\n\nChocobo’s Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY! (2019)\n\nChocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, the Girl, and the Five Heroes (2008)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 6\n\nChocobo Racing (1999)\n\nWhen not exploring dungeons, Alpha and crew took to the track. It seems that every major franchise has to dabble with a kart racer at some point and it’s unfortunate that Chocobo Racing has continually been a disappointment.\n\nChocobo GP (2022)\n\nChocobo GP’ (2022)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 3\n\nChocobo Stallion (1999)\n\nThis one-off title was developed and released only in Japan. Based on the popular minigame in FF VII‘s Gold Saucer, players could race their own chocobos without having to be distracted by an impending meteor crashing into the planet.\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nDice de Chocobo (1999)\n\nWhile I exclusively play as the top hat in Monopoly, I’d make a concession to play as a plucky chocobo. This Japan-exclusive had players working their way through several different themed boards, buying up spaces and placing monsters on them to increase the “rent.”\n\nChocobo Land: A Game of Dice (2002)\n\nInitial Platform: PlayStation\n\nTotal Games: 2\n\nWorking Chocobo (2000)\n\nIf there’s one thing publishers love to do, it’s to take someone else’s idea and slap their own IP all over it. Enter Working Chocobo, which might as well be Harvest Moon with Final Fantasy flair.\n\nInitial Platform: WonderSwan\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nChocobo Anywhere (2002)\n\nFor decades, Square Enix has been trying various ideas for mobile. I have to respect the tenacity, even if most of the games have been flops. The Chocobo Anywhere series consisted of various themed puzzle games exclusive to Japanese phones.\n\nChocobo Anywhere 2: Escape! Ghost Ship (2003)\n\nChocobo Anywhere 2.5: Infiltration! Ancient Ruin (2004)\n\nChocobo Anywhere 3: Defeat! The Great Rainbow-Colored Demon (2004)\n\nInitial Platform: Mobile\n\nTotal Games: 4\n\nChoco-Mate (2003)\n\nDid this game ever exist? Information on it is incredibly sparse and the only bits I could find are from an archived press release. The premise was that users selected their chocobo, found friends on the app, and sent messages to one another.\n\nInitial Platform: Mobile\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nChocobo de Mobile (2006)\n\nMuch like Choco-Mate, there isn’t a whole lot of information available for Chocobo de Mobile. It appears to be comprised of different minigames with additional content packs having been released.\n\nInitial Platform: Mobile\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nChocobo Panic (2010)\n\nIn this unique title, players must tap and hold the specified chocobos on the screen until told to let go of a specific one. It’s like Twister for your fingers.\n\nInitial Platform: iOS\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nChocobo’s Crystal Tower (2010)\n\nInitially released for mobile phones and then ported to Facebook, Chocobo’s Crystal Tower was a sidescrolling dungeon crawler. Players could collect cosmetics and gear to decorate their stable to show off to other players.\n\nInitial Platform: Mobile\n\nTotal Games: 1\n\nChocobo’s Chocotto Farm (2012)\n\nChocobo’s Chocotto Farm was a farming sim with a special focus on the large yellow birds released exclusively on mobile."
