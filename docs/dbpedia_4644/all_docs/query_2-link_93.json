        "text": "Man so many posts about \"square is garbage\" \"square lost their touch\" \" square is finished\" if this rumor were to be true. Im sure alot of the members here understand this better than the casual gamer's, but in case you missed it let me give you some insight.\n\nThis game is being directed by Tetsuya Nomura\n\nHe is also the Director of the Kingdom Hearts Franchise\n\n( a old school FF fan will say Nomura is trash and Yoshitaka Amano is god, based on the fact they dont like his character designs for the most part. In which i can understand the hate when you think about it as a FF fan, we have had a female lead since nomura started having rights over character designs starting with ff7 haha.)\n\nLets have a look at what Tetsuya has done or at least been credited for since FFvs13 was announced:\n\n(development began in Novemeber 2005)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Advent Children 2005 OVA Director\n\nLast Order: Final Fantasy VII 2005 OVA Supervising Director\n\nKingdom Hearts II 2005 PlayStation 2 Director\n\nDirge of Cerberus: FF7 2006 PlayStation 2 Character Designer\n\nDirge of Cerberus Lost Episode 2006 Mobile Phones Character Designer\n\nFinal Fantasy V Advance 2006 Game Boy Advance Monster Designer\n\nThe World Ends with You 2007 Nintendo DS Creative Producer & Main Character Designer\n\n(this ^^ is the best game that you have never played/heard of)\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII 2007 PlayStation Portable Creative Producer & Character Designer\n\nKingdom Hearts coded 2008 Mobile Phones Director\n\nDissidia: Final Fantasy 2008 PlayStation Portable Creative Producer & Character Designer\n\nKingdom Hearts 358/2 Days 2009 Nintendo DS Director\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII 2009 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Main Character Designer\n\nKingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep 2010 PlayStation Portable Director\n\nKingdom Hearts Re:coded 2010 Nintendo DS Director\n\nThe 3rd Birthday 2010 PlayStation Portable Creative producer & Character Designer\n\nDissidia 012 Final Fantasy 2011 PlayStation Portable Creative Producer & Character Designer\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 2011 PlayStation Portable Creative Producer & Character Designer\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 2011 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Main Character Designer\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy 2012 Nintendo 3DS Creative Producer\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D:DDD 2012 Nintendo 3DS Director\n\nFinal Fantasy: All The Bravest 2013 iOS Creative Producer & Original Concept\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII 2013 PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 Main Character Designer\n\nFinal Fantasy Versus XIII TBA PlayStation 3 Director, Concept Designer, Character Designer & Base Story\n\nI also imagine the KH 1.5 HD remaster would require some input from him somehow.\n\nWell first thing that stands out to me is dudes been working, i know vs13 started what seems like ages ago but give this guy a break, look at that list i count six kingdom hearts games in 8 and a half years. i remember a interview from a while back where he talked about how working on the \" light and fluffy\" story of KH was getting tiresome, he really wanted to do something more mature more dark. and who can blame him? i fap to KH more than most and while i love the series it is sometimes upsetting to me that the oldest itteration of my new favorite hero is like 16 if that. and while age means almost nothing it dictates alot of his speech for sure which is cheese fest. and not to mention FINALLY not having the binds of Disney shooting down every single awesome idea nomura had for the KH games, forget about you the consumer think about him as a artist, blank canvas FF brand name with pretty much no one to answer to.( just a side note Yoko Shimomura is the composer of vs13 and she will make this game DARK ala that first song Somnus that was really really creepish that launched with the orignal trailer maybe the second one)\n\nBack to the list lets check which consoles were used:\n\nPlaystation - 9 (counting Vs13)\n\nNintendo- 6\n\nMulti - 3 ( ps3 xbox360)\n\nphone- 2\n\nMovies- 2\n\niOS- 1\n\nNow the Handheld/console :\n\nexcluding the phone, movie and ios games as well as vs13 itself\n\nthat leaves 17 titles\n\n12 were handhelds\n\n3 were ff 13 1-3 (which mr nomura has really no creative input it seems minus the character design)\n\nKingdom hearts 2 ps2\n\ndirge of cerberus ps2\n\nMr nomura has pretty much had zero input to ANY game for ANY console of the ps3/360/wii generation.\n\n(So why start now?? less than a year before the ps4 releases and no news nvm a release date i personally feel with the complete lockout of vs13 news for the past 3 years that there is no plausible reason why this game could not have been moved to ps4. you want that dark mature FF really really bad and you know it, were talking all the things the ff 10 kiddies never had, vast open world, airships that you can drive..not pick a town from a drop down menu, chocobos, cars, day/night cycle , and what seems to be a badass RTE feature.\n\nNomura has stated that there are two main goals he wants to achieve with Final Fantasy Versus XIII:\n\nTo provide the most seamless gameplay experience ever seen in a Final Fantasy game.\n\nTo provide the most realistic story, characters and world ever seen in a Final Fantasy game\n\nYou want to Play ^^that Final Fantasy let him make it please, and gtfo with your \"SE just release it\" \"omg SE sucks\" i know the development has been an astronomical amount of time ( the best was someone who said the game was announced when they were in 6th grade and now hes in like his first semester of college haha) but if this really was switched over to the ps4 it happened right after they started using the luminous engine lighting. just give them time this title has been tucked away from the world for far too long without any HARD news for ANYONE to say that this is going to be a ps3 and ps3 game only. something is up with this game i say ps4 exclusive.\n\nNow this post has been all over the place and i dont really remember what my inital point was but, lets talk about this being a ps4 exclusive. Im getting really tired of the ps3 kids crying and bleeding all over the floor once these ps4 speculations arose. so you bought a ps3 for a game that didnt get released on your console even though it seemed that it was going to be a sure thing? QQ more plz. its funny because i was in this boat sort of, i told myself not bw buy a ps3 untill vs13 or kh3 were released those where my terms. and guess who has no seventh gen console...thats right me. while its depressing that i missed some really quality titles on the ps3 im going to have to get one now anyways for the KH 1.5 hd. i just hate the whining about how much i paid for a ps3 and now i have to buy a PS4??????????? get over yourself and your trash budget, or have more control and not go impulse buy a ps3 becasue I HAZ TO COD WITH FRENDz, The thing with vs 13 being this far into ps3's life is that with kh3 no where in sight you can be almost positive that kh3 will be a ps4 title which i dont know how you feel about that but it makes me feel like a kawii 13 year old schoolgirl.\n\nAnd this is the other thing, although all the hype this game has is pretty much gone i bet you i know a few folks who follow every piece of vs13 news they can get and that is the KH fans. now while the kh fans are pretty much the same as ff fans meaning the same people, they are waiting for this game to come out. not only will it be a beast title but because vs13 done = start kh3.\n\nkh2 the last console KH sold 4m worldwide not the greatest but understanding that ps4 is around the corner and that the coveted kh3 will sure enough end up on ps4 than hell why not buy one at launch (or not) with vs13.\n\nVersus and Agito/type-0 are pretty clearly not spin offs. They were planned well before XIII released and are therefore not derivatives of XIII. They are all co-equal entries (in theory, since type-0's release was horribly mishandled and Versus' hasn't been handled at all) in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series. There are, as far as we know, no connections to the world or characters of XIII, so how is that a spin off? The vague idea that all the games are set in the same \"universe\", which was seemingly just Square's way of communicating that they are all part of the XIII compilation, is pretty flimsy evidence for that assertion. Anyway, it would be pretty strange for a spin off to be a more ambitious and far more expensive project than the main series.\n\nDirge of Cerberus was a spin off. XIII-2 is a direct sequel, not a spin off.\n\nThe JRPG golden age is basically a myth. They were a niche genre then, and they remain a niche genre today. The only major system selling JRPGs then, as now, were Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Final Fantasy's decline is not indicative of a general loss of interest in JRPGs but of Square's terrible, terrible mismanagement of the series. The fact that the most prominent series has stumbled so badly gives the illusion that JRPGs as a whole are in decline, but there are actually more JRPGs being released now than there were in the '90s.\n\nVersus is well past the point of no return. There is no way they can just can it at this point, and even if they could it would be approximately the worst idea ever. Square already has a lot of rehabbing to do of the series' reputation, and this would be more than a mere setback. They've already said that another disaster like XIV could kill the company. The backlash from such a move would probably do just that.\n\nMaking it a PS4 exclusive is really not any riskier than making it a PS3 exclusive, and it's certainly less risky than not making it at all."
