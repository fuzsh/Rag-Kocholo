        "text": "This is a fantasy based on reality...\n\n—Tagline\n\n\"Fools set the rules in this world. Just look around. It's undeniable.\"\n\n—Noctis\n\nFinal Fantasy XV is a 2016 action role-playing video game by Square Enix. The game was initially known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII.\n\nThe fifteenth entry in the stupefyingly popular (and increasingly delayed) Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy Versus XIII was supposed to be a spiritual sibling of Final Fantasy XIII, but was not a sequel, prequel or related to it in any way other than sharing mythos elements, and was supposed to take place in a different world. Final Fantasy Versus XIII was part of a \"ten year project\" called Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, which is a Pretentious Latin Title meaning \"The New Tale Of The Crystal\". This particular game was being developed by the same team who does Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAs the game's name changed, references to such project were mostly dropped from the final product.\n\nThe story of Final Fantasy Versus XIII centered around Noctis Lucis Caelum, mafia prince of an isolated kingdom and protector of the last crystal, in a world where crystals are no longer used. Together with his loyal True Companions, Noct works to defend his homeland from neighbouring \"barbarians\" who seek its power for their own in the growing conflict. He also meets Stella Nox Fleuret, a young woman from the rival country of Tenebrae and his unwilling enemy. All this is overshadowed by legends of Etro, goddess of death, and her relationship with humans.\n\nIn the final product, however, though the basic premise of Noctis and his friends fighting for their homeland remained, Stella was completely replaced by Luna, a character with similar physical characteristics (blonde hair, white skin, female, thin figure), but who serves as ally in their fight against the The Empire of Nilfheim, who are the antagonists of Final Fantasy XV.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV, its final denomination, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It has since been released on Windows. It also has a Pocket Edition, an abridged version of the same story on mobile platforms and for computers running Windows 10 which is basically a streamlined game with simpler graphics and gameplay but all the story content of the more powerful original game.\n\nIt's a game with much supplementary media:\n\nKingsglaive: a CGI movie detailing the political machinations behind the scenes that set up the events at the end of Chapter 1 that were largely offscreen.\n\nBrotherhood: an anime prequel to the main game covering the backstories of the main playable characters.\n\nA King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV: A spinoff side scrolling Beat'Em Up game based on King Regis in his younger days.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: A New Empire\n\nMonster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV: A Playstation VR game based on the fishing portion of the main game.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV: A New Empire\n\nMusic was composed by Yoko Shimomura, the composer for Kingdom Hearts.\n\nTropes used in Final Fantasy XV include:"
