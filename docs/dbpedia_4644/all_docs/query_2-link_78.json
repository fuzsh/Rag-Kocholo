        "text": "You might not have had to play Final Fantasy Type-0 to understand Final Fantasy Agito, but if you did you may recognize some scenes in the mobile game’s TGS trailer.\n\nPosted online this morning, this lengthy look at Agito shows off various facets of gameplay – including missions, story event scenes, CG visuals, character conversations and of course the game’s battle system. The base game will be free of charge, and players will be able to create their own character to participate in missions throughout the world of Oriense. Although the game is F2P, players can pay real money for items to recover energy points expended by taking on these missions as well as revive after mission failures and other gacha items. By deepening your relationship with certain characters, they’ll appear to help you at various points along the way.\n\nFinal Fantasy Agito will be available sometime in 2014 for iOS and Android platforms."
