        "text": "Way back in 1987, the game development company Square had found mild success with a variety of home video games in Japan and western territories. Despite people buying and enjoying games like King's Knight and Rad Racer, the specter of bankruptcy and financial ruin loomed. With enough resources for one more project and the unexpected popularity of the then-new title Dragon Quest, Hironobu Sakaguchi and a small team were given permission to make their own fantasy adventure game for the Nintendo Entertainment and Japanese Family Computer game consoles. Anticipating that this would be Squares last game, the project was dubbed, 'Final Fantasy' but luckily for Square, this turned out to be one Hell of a misnomer. Since 1987, there have been over a dozen titles in the main series, numerous spin-off titles, remakes, remasters, re-releases, compilations, film and, anime adaptations. Today, I'm going to take a look at Final Fantasy XIII, the only Final Fantasy title to be released on the PS3 and Xbox 360.\n\n[sub]The Thirteenth-most Final Fantasy[/sub]​\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII isn't just another main-line title in the series. XIII was meant to kick off a new sub-series in terms of lore known as the Fabula Nova Crystallis Collection. The Fabula Nova Crystallis collection serves to introduce a more standard world (or collection of landmarks?) as well as a new importance to crystals, which have been important to the franchise from the very beginning. One of the problems I had with Final Fantasy XIII though, is that it has trouble conveying its plot at times. It's an issue made more obvious by uninteresting and under developed characters but I'll get back to that later. The worlds presented in Final Fantasy XIII are known as Pulse and Cocoon. Cocoon is a vast floating city meant to protect people from the horrors and corrupting influences of the world Pulse below.\n\nWhile the citizens of Cocoon enjoy a life of technological bliss and luxury, they're also the subjects of a subtle, though brutal, Oligarchy...or Monarchy...or Tyranny...I could have missed this in the cut scenes and I certainly wasn't going to back and read one of the many primers you, the player, are given at the beginning and ending of each in-game Chapter. What is clear is that the ruler of Cocoon is of course the recurring antagonist who seeks to bring about the end of the world because somebody has to do it and Primarch Galenth \"Barthandelus\" Dysley drew the short straw. For a game that wanted to kick off a new sub-series in terms of plot, Final Fantasy XIII hasn't changed too much since this is another game wherein you control a motley crew who are essentially saving an oppressed world from The Pope and eventually God (well, A God since Final Fantasy is and always has been a polytheistic series).\n\nThe game begins with Lightning and Sazh aboard a train filled with people who are thought to have been corrupted by a fal'Cie, a creature which infiltrated Cocoon from Pulse...somehow. These two derail the train in an attempt to save the people about to be purged and after a lengthy series of cut scenes, the first battle begins with a giant robotic Scorpion tank thing. I'm immediately reminded of Final Fantasy VII which began very similarly although admittedly, Sahz isn't nearly as foul-mouthed as Barret was. After the initial battle, you're given a bit of control and allowed to walk down a linear corridor and take on a few more opponents. As you progress through the starting area, you're familiarized with the characters Lightning (who will be the main character for this installment), Sahz and, Snow (who owns and operates NORA, AKA Avalanche). Players who chose to skip over the over-long cut scenes can easily miss out on the fact that NORA even exists. As I mentioned previously, players who aren't interested in long cut scenes can opt out of them and instead take in the plot of the game by reading summaries provided in the options menu. Like the game itself, these are broken up into chapters and are quiet detailed. The problem is that Final Fantasy XIII isn't a visual novel and if you want to jump right into the action of the game, odds are you won't be interested in stopping to read about why six people are fighting military police from the future or gigantic monsters from a lush and beautiful world.\n\nThat reminds me: Final Fantasy XIII is one of the best looking games on the Playstation 3 (and presumably the Xbox 360). Despite the linearity and, despite the lack of any true towns or landmarks, Final Fantasy XIII offers up a beautiful and diverse world to look at as you're wandering through the hallways. The character design isn't stellar but Square has definitely made stranger decisions when it comes to wardrobe. Lightning and Snow for example are not as simply dressed as Tifa or Cloud but they're dress isn't quite as over-the-top as someone like Lulu from Final Fantasy X or Cloud from Kingdom Hearts. The lack of a non-human playable character is also disheartening although since everyone is made into a l'Cie rather early on, I suppose it can be argued that none of the playable characters are truly human. As for the soundtrack, the main theme, Chocobo theme and, battle theme are nicely memorable but I have a feeling that if it wasn't for my love of Theatrhythm, I would have forgotten about most of FFXIII's soundtrack by now with the exception of the song Fighting Fate. Fighting Fate wouldn't be a bad boss theme if it wasn't for the fact that it's accompanied by a chorus which bypasses 'annoying' and goes right into the territory of gratingly unbearable. This isn't the standard boss theme but you do have to endure this theme every time you go up against Barthandelus.\n\n[sub]Not all Popes are evil...but a lot of evil people happen to be Popes[/sub]​\n\nWhen I first played Final Fantasy XIII back in 2009, I had just finished up Crisis Core and IX. I was really excited for a new Final Fantasy and my expectations were high. The most important aspect of a JRPG for me is the battle system since I see that as its main gameplay feature. Final Fantasy XIII's battle system takes place in real time which has been used in past Final Fantasy titles. Players can only directly control the party's leader, which can't be changed until past the mid-point of the game. Players have an ATB gauge which is segmented and fills as the battle progresses. Actions and abilities can be stacked and unleashed back-to-back once the gauge is filled completely or they can be activated individually as the segments of the gauge is filled to the appropriate level. Alternatively you can tap on the X button repeatedly, choosing Auto-Battle.\n\nMost battles unfold thus: your party beats on an enemy until the stagger gauge fills up, at which point the enemy takes far more damage and hopefully dies very soon after. Sometimes you'll even be able to kill an enemy before staggering it! As the game progresses, you will be able to access several paradigms (or Jobs) which can be switched on the fly during battles. These jobs have strange names and the various configurations have strange names but they breakdown thus: Commando (warrior), Ravager (black mage), Medic (white mage), Sentinel (a tank class that buffs defenses and draws enemy ire), Saboteur (a black mage that targets enemies with debuffs), and Synergist (a white mage that focuses on buffing allies). Battle parties are made up of three characters so it's possible to have three commandos who just steamroll weaker enemies or a more diverse team who focus on buffing one attacker while de-buffing a single, powerful enemy. This puts a new spin on combat that hasn't been seen in Final Fantasy before though some have seen similarities between this system and the gambit system from Final Fantasy XII. This new system can be really simple to control but the presentation is spectacular; many times it's more fun to watch a fight than engage in one.\n\nBefore I get too much further, I would like to briefly summarize the playable characters just to get that out of the way. There are six playable characters in Final Fantasy XIII, all human with a healthy amount of diversity in that half of them are women and one of them are a person of color. Lightning is the stoic, main character who is fighting to save her sister Sarah and bring down the corrupt government ruling over Cocoon. Snow is a somewhat arrogant brawler, fighting to save his lover Sarah and leading a group who seek to overthrow the corrupt government ruling over Cocoon. Vanille is strange...she seems to react to stimuli that haven't happened in our plane of reality and her voice is absolutely annoying but they needed at least one quirky character. Hope is characterized as weak and simpering, fighting because...well, how else is he going to grow as a character? Sazh is fighting with Lightning to overthrow the corrupt government etc and eventually to save his son. Fang is a bad-ass, ass-kicker who...I honestly can't remember her motivations other than her and Snow having a relationship of some kind. They are brought together after being branded as l'Cie and given the choice to either save the world or become crystal-monsters...or crystals...or monsters...I'm not sure what the outcome would be if they ignored their fate but it's all Gods fault that they were cursed with amazing powers and the ability to become more powerful than any human could ever hope to be.\n\n[sub]Even leveling up is linear[/sub]​\n\nOnce you get to chapter 11 (out of 13), a new aspect of the game opens up to you the player and that's missions. There are 64 in total but a majority of them boil down to 'go here, kill this monster' or, 'go here, kill these monsters'. If you manage to get through enough missions, you unlock the right to ride around in the one vast, open space the game provides of Chocobo! In Final Fantasy XIII, the main benefit to riding Chocobo boils down to allowing you access to a buried treasure?well it isn't a mini-game, it's just there to collect if you chose to seek it out. There are a couple of sub-areas within the large area that are only accessible by riding around on a Chocobo. Since the missions I've played through didn't offer anything really interesting or new, I didn't bother to play through all of the missions. I was already bored by the combat system and didn't want to spend more time than I had to on the game. I just wanted to grind, level-up and, get through the chapters of this game! That brings me to another criticism?\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII, as I mentioned before, is broken up into 13 chapters. In past games, it's possible to level-grind in one of many areas so as to better prepare one's self for an upcoming area of the game. In fact it's possible to grind in such a way that your characters can use incredibly powerful limit breaks in Final Fantasy VII before even making it out of Midgar! Or it's possible to access mid-level magic and boost your stats to an excessively high level before fighting the first boss in Final Fantasy VIII. Final Fantasy XIII is different in that not only are you unable to level-up at all until chapter 3, but there are level caps. In fact, it's impossible to max out your character's levels until after you've beaten the game for the first time. If you're having trouble with a specific boss or a specific area of the game, you can find yourself in a situation wherein you can't develop a your characters any further but still find yourself being absolutely trampled by enemies. I didn't mention this too much while talking about the battle system but if you're not using the correct configuration of paradigms, it will feel like you're doing little more than blowing kisses at your enemies up until they are staggered. There are some enemies that have so much HP, that even when they're staggered it's difficult to tell if you're making much of a difference at all. If there's one thing I hate, it's a game that makes me feel weak despite ensuring me that I'm definitely growing more powerful and of course I'm getting better than I used to be.\n\n[sub]Are you trying to kill me or tickle me?[/sub]​\n\nAnother means by which to advance your characters is by upgrading weapons and equipment. As you fight monsters and enemies, you'll end up being laden down with items ranging from chipped fangs and fish scales all the way up to microprocessors and, ultra-compact superconductors. There are two types of component types, organic and synthetic. The organic components add multipliers which allow your equipment to develop more quickly whereas the synthetic components offer up higher EXP values which actually level up equipment more quickly. Once a weapon or piece of equipment has reached its highest level, it'll be shown to be at level-star. Some pieces of equipment and all weapons can become a better item (or variant piece of equipment) by combining the perfect item with a specific, and generally expensive, component. Out of every other aspect of Final Fantasy XIII, I got the most satisfaction from leveling up and upgrading weapons and items. I can't really explain why since it is somewhat tedious and it absolutely drains all of the Gil from your wallet but the first time I turned a decent weapon into a much better weapon brought about far more satisfaction than any of the times I felled a King Behemoth or one of its palette-swapped brethren.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is one of the last games I have ever pre-ordered. I was incredibly disappointed by it when I first played it and that's mainly from my lack of understanding of the game's mechanics. The first time I played it, I took the time to watch all of the cinematics and read the tutorials. I read FAQs which insisted that bosses who kept killing me were easily beaten. I hated this game but I wouldn't let it beat me and when I finally came back to it a few months ago, I was filled with a fire that wouldn't be extinguished until I made it through the game. I found the experience much more bearable once I started skipping cut scenes. I found myself going from incensed by this game to annoyed. I still dislike Final Fantasy XIII but now that I've beaten it and it's behind me, I can say that this isn't the worst game I've ever played.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a textbook example of style over substance. The scenery, set-pieces and, cinematic sequences are gorgeous. Watching a battle unfold is really cool and if Final Fantasy XIII was a mini-series I probably would have liked it a whole lot more. This is a game that feels like it didn't want to be a video game and it's definitely not a game that I would recommend to anybody who prefers their Final Fantasy games to have a contained plot and even turn-based combat. Final Fantasy XIII isn't bad because it's different, it's bad because it wanted to be watched and not played. I spent $10 on my current copy of FFXIII and $60 when it first came out...I would have much rather spent that same $70 on something more substantial, like 5 pizzas or, some gratuitous anime box-sets...or several good Final Fantasy titles."
