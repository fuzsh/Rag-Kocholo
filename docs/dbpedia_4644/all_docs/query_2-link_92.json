        "text": "I suppose I'll make a possible contribution with Allison Road. Best known for being one of the first projects that tried to capitalize on the cancellation of P.T. / Silent Hills. It had a notable Kickstarter campaign that was canned after a surprise announcement that Team17 would be supporting its development. However, they dropped the game around June 2016 with a cancellation announcement although the developers proclaimed it would continue production without Team17 about two months later. Eventually, all major outlets from their social media accounts to the main website would be deleted so it's safe to assume Allison Road has finally been put to bed despite no official final acknowledgement.\n\nVisage has become something of a spiritual successor to both it and the late Konami revival so I'm grateful the premise is still being pursued.\n\nApparently, the game is supposed to appear at E3 2020 in some fashion alongside Deathloop.\n\nHold the phone: Bruce 'The Chin' Campbell has retired?!\n\nHe hasn't officially retired from acting if that's what you're inquiring. Back in April 2018, Mr. Campbell announced that he was stepping away from the character 'Ash Williams' following the cancellation of Ash vs. Evil Dead. He believes it's time for a younger actor to take on the role even though director Sam Raimi still wants to do another film installment with him.\n\nUshiro (Level 5's horror game)\n\nIt was revived back in October 2018 for the Switch. However, it was still suggested to be in very early stages of development on the platform and, funnily enough, no concrete updates have been provided since then.\n\nUppers is what I was going to post, both of them are from Marvelous and I'm pretty sure Sony's policies are at least part of the reason we never heard from those games again. Both of them have questionable fanservice mechanics that are part of the gameplay and Sony probably wouldn't approve of them these days.\n\nIt really wouldn't be surprising if the Western localization of Uppers was silently scrapped as a result of Sony's undisclosed policy toward sensual content. Last time I checked, Marvelous Games through their Twitter account claimed it was still in development as of March 2nd, 2020. However, I find it weird that nothing concrete has been revealed since Marvelous claims every detail except for the release date has been disclosed and it was already rated by the ESRB back in December 2018. I'm speculating that they might not want to acknowledge any troubles with development to avoid any backlash or policy discussion after the content changes with the last Senran Kagura installment on PS4.\n\nEDIT: Also, anyone remember Routine?\n\nI definitely still remember the game! In terms of visual presentation, I'm guessing Alien: Isolation sort of stole its thunders with the lowfi / retro-future art direction for a first-person horror title. Allegedly, someone claiming to have been an aspiring financier and close friend to one of the lead developers wanted to provide financial support for the studio, Lunar Software, back around late 2017 along with several other investors. The team was extremely stripped for cash and experienced tremendous hardship trying to finish the project; however, its lead developer suddenly cut off all personal contact about a year later and nobody knows whether it'll be resurrected as other known contacts have gone dark. The main websites for the studio and game continue to have their registrations renewed for what it's worth. Plus, an Easter egg for the game was found in The Occupation.\n\nI suppose I'll make a possible contribution with Allison Road.

The game started dev on PSP.\n\nI wouldn't count Versus as cancelled since they simply decided to change into a main entry.\n\nI am sure Prey 2 was admitted as cancelled.\n\nAnd Beyond Good and Evil 2 isn't cancelled. They had viddoc in oct 2019 and basically this year it seems during investors meeting (Feb 2020) they simply confirmed it will not be coming out before April 2021. But they didn't state it was cancelled.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 isn't part of Ubisoft's plans for next fiscal year\n\nFans of Beyond Good & Evil who delighted in the game's announcement trailer when it was shown at E3 2017 are unfortunat…\n\nVersus XIII had completely different dev team entirely, characters, plot, gameplay and cutscenes. It's a different game.\n\nPretty sure Prey 2 wasn't admitted as cancelled by Bethesda, only that it was \"repurposed\" by the devs of Dishonored (it was canned and made by a different team entirely and looked like a different game entirely, just like the game above)\n\nDidn't know that about Beyond Good & Evil 2 but I wasn't the only one who thought it's become vaporware considering Ancel's other recent announcements (WiLD).\n\nEDIT: Just thought of another - Red Ash (Mega Man Legends from Inafune)."
