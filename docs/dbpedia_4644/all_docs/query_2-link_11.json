        "text": "Final Fantasy is a series of role-playing video games developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square). Its first game premiered in Japan in 1987, and Final Fantasy games have subsequently been localized for markets in North America, Europe and Australia, on nearly every video game console since its debut on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Final Fantasy is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 97 million units worldwide to date.[1] In addition to traditional role-playing games, the series includes tactical role-playing games, portable games, massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and games for mobile phones. Its popularity has placed it as the sixth-best-selling video game franchise, and the series has won multiple awards over the years.[2]\n\nIn addition to the 15 games released as part of the main (numbered) series and their many spin-offs and related titles, the Final Fantasy series has spawned many works in other media including anime, movies, novels and manga, and radio dramas. Final Fantasy: Unlimited, originally a stand-alone anime series, now has its own sub-franchise which includes video games. Many games, particularly the main series, have soundtrack album releases featuring their music in different arrangements. Square Enix has also consistently released companion books for its games which provide additional backstory and plot information, as well as detailed walkthroughs for the game. Since the announcement of Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Square Enix has focused on \"polymorphic content\", expanding each game world with material on many video game platforms, as well as other forms of media.[3]\n\nVideo games[]\n\nEach game in the main series takes place in a different fictional universe, although beginning with Final Fantasy X-2, additional video games set in the main series games' worlds have been released.[4] Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy are cross-platform multimedia projects consisting of games, films, books, and other media centered on their respective main series game, Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy XIII.[3][5] Final Fantasy Tactics, although originally envisioned as a spin-off game, became its own series as part of Ivalice Alliance, which counts Final Fantasy XII in its membership.[6]\n\nA large number of spin-off video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games vary in their relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but were considered to be the first three games of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding.[7] Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.\n\nTitle Original release date\n\nJapan\n\nNorth America\n\nPAL region\n\nFinal Fantasy December 18, 1987[9] July 12, 1990[10] March 14, 2003[11] (PlayStation) Notes:\n\nReleased on Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nAlso available on MSX,[12] WonderSwan Color,[13] PlayStation,[14] Game Boy Advance, mobile phone,[16] PlayStation Portable,[17] Virtual Console,[18] PlayStation Network,[19] Windows Phone, and iOS[20]\n\nFinal Fantasy II December 17, 1988[9] April 8, 2003[11] (PlayStation) March 14, 2003[11] (PlayStation) Notes:\n\nReleased on Family Computer\n\nAlso available on WonderSwan Color,[21] PlayStation,[22] Game Boy Advance, mobile phone,[23] PlayStation Portable,[24] Virtual Console,[18] PlayStation Network,[25] and iOS[20]\n\nFinal Fantasy III April 27, 1990[9] November 14, 2006[26] (Nintendo DS) May 4, 2007[26] (Nintendo DS) Notes:\n\nReleased on Family Computer\n\nAlso available on Virtual Console[18]\n\nFull 3D remake for Nintendo DS,[27] iOS and PC.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV July 19, 1991[28] November 23, 1991[29] February 27, 2002[30] (PlayStation) Notes:\n\nReleased on Super Famicom, first released in North America as \"Final Fantasy II\" on Super NES[31]\n\nAlso available on PlayStation,[32] WonderSwan Color,[33] Game Boy Advance,[34] mobile phone,[35] and Virtual Console[18]\n\nFull 3D remake for Nintendo DS[36]\n\nFinal Fantasy V December 6, 1992[28] October 5, 1999 (PlayStation) February 27, 2002[30] (PlayStation) Notes:\n\nReleased on Super Famicom\n\nAlso available on PlayStation[38] Game Boy Advance,[39] Virtual Console,[18] and PlayStation Network[40]\n\nFinal Fantasy VI April 2, 1994[28] October 11, 1994[41] March 1, 2002[42] (PlayStation) Notes:\n\nReleased on Super Famicom, first released in North America as \"Final Fantasy III\" on Super NES[43]\n\nAlso available on PlayStation[42] Game Boy Advance,[44] and Virtual Console[18]\n\nFinal Fantasy VII January 31, 1997[45] September 7, 1997[46] November 17, 1997 Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation\n\nAlso available on Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows personal computer[48] and PlayStation Network[49]\n\nInternational version released in Japan[50]\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII February 11, 1999[45] September 9, 1999[51] October 27, 1999 Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation\n\nAlso available on Microsoft Windows personal computer[53] and PlayStation Network[54]\n\nFinal Fantasy IX July 7, 2000 November 13, 2000 February 16, 2001 Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation\n\nAlso available on Microsoft Windows personal computer[56] and PlayStation Network[57]\n\nFinal Fantasy X July 19, 2001 December 17, 2001 May 24, 2002 Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation 2\n\nInternational version released in Japan[59]\n\nFinal Fantasy XI May 16, 2002[60] October 28, 2003[61] (Microsoft Windows) September 17, 2004[62] (Microsoft Windows) Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows personal computer, and Xbox 360\n\nFive expansion packs and six \"add-on scenarios\" released in the following years[63]\n\nFinal Fantasy XII March 16, 2006[64] October 31, 2006[65] February 23, 2007[66] Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation 2\n\nInternational version released in Japan\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII December 17, 2009[68] March 9, 2010[69] March 9, 2010[69] Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV September 21, 2010[70] September 21, 2010[71][72] September 21, 2010[73] Notes:\n\nReleased on Microsoft Windows.\n\nCompletely revamped version released in 2013 as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn for Windows, PlayStation 3 and in 2014 for PlayStation 4\n\nFinal Fantasy XV November 29, 2016 November 29, 2016 November 29, 2016 Notes:\n\nReleased on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC.\n\nSimultaneous world-wide release.\n\nStarted development as Final Fantasy Versus XIII on the PlayStation 3\n\nFilm and television[]\n\nSquare's initial forays into film and television were critical and commercial failures. Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals was poorly received and the box office failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within lead to the merger between Square and Enix.[74][75][76] The series did not have success in film until Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, which ultimately won several awards for \"best anime feature\" and sold over 2.4 million copies within a year.[77][78][79]\n\nTitle Original release date\n\nJapan\n\nNorth America\n\nPAL region\n\nFinal Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals March 21, 1994[80] November 24, 1998[81] none Notes:\n\nFour episode original video animation (OVA) by Madhouse\n\nSequel to Final Fantasy V\n\nFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within September 15, 2001[82] July 11, 2001 August 3, 2001 Notes:\n\nFeature-length, theatrically released computer-generated film released under the Final Fantasy brand\n\nFinal Fantasy: Unlimited October 2, 2001[84] October 28, 2003[85] March 15, 2004[86] Notes:\n\nOriginal 25 episode animated television series by GONZO featuring concepts and themes from the Final Fantasy games\n\nFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Children September 14, 2005 April 25, 2006 April 24, 2006 Notes:\n\nFeature-length, theatrically released computer-generated film serving as a sequel to Final Fantasy VII\n\nPart of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\n\nLast Order: Final Fantasy VII, a traditionally animated OVA by Madhouse that serves as a prequel to Final Fantasy VII, is included as a bonus feature on the North American Limited Edition Collector's Set of Advent Children[88]\n\nA director's cut version of the movie was released in 2009 on Blu-ray disc as Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete.

Music for the spin-off series and main series games beginning with Final Fantasy X was created by a variety of composers including Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Kumi Tanioka, as well as many others.[2] In addition to the original soundtracks, listed below, many games have inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums, as well as compilation albums featuring music from several Final Fantasy games.\n\nTitle Original release date\n\nJapan\n\nNorth America\n\nPAL region\n\nAll Sounds of Final Fantasy I & II December 21, 1988[93] none none Notes:\n\nOne CD (62:33) with 49 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by DataM/Polystar\n\nFinal Fantasy III Original Sound Version July 15, 1991[94] none none Notes:\n\nOne CD (54:24) with 44 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by Square and NTT Publishing\n\nFinal Fantasy IV Original Sound Version June 14, 1991[95] August 21, 2001[96] none Notes:\n\nOne CD (58:23) with 44 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by Square Co. and NTT Publishing\n\nFinal Fantasy V Original Sound Version December 7, 1992[97] none none Notes:\n\nTwo CDs (2:08:30) with 67 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by Square Co. and NTT Publishing\n\nFinal Fantasy VI Original Sound Version March 25, 1994[98] July 1, 1994[99] none Notes:\n\nThree CDs (3:07:21) with 61 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by NTT Publishing\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack February 10, 1997[100] none none Notes:\n\nFour CDs (4:39:53) with 85 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by DigiCube\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack March 1, 1999[101] January 2000[102] none Notes:\n\nFour CDs (4:09:30) with 74 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by DigiCube\n\nFinal Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack August 30, 2000[103] none none Notes:\n\nFour CDs (4:46:31) with 110 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by DigiCube\n\nFinal Fantasy X Original Soundtrack August 1, 2001[104] none none Notes:\n\nFour CDs (4:32:26) with 91 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by DigiCube\n\nFinal Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack June 5, 2002[105] none none Notes:\n\nTwo CDs (1:51:57) with 51 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by DigiCube\n\nFinal Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack May 31, 2006[106] January 31, 2012 none Notes:\n\nFour CDs (4:54:34) with 100 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by Aniplex\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack January 27, 2010[107] none none Notes:\n\nFour CDs (4:04:06) with 85 tracks\n\nReleased in Japan by Square Enix\n\nCompanion books[]\n\nStarting with Final Fantasy III, Square began publishing guide books for its games which traditionally include additional content such as developer interviews and expanded plot and setting information. Studio BentStuff wrote the first Ultimania book for Final Fantasy VIII in 1999, though the company had been contracted to write Final Fantasy VII True Script Dissection for the previous game. Since then, Ultimania books have been written for every major Final Fantasy title, including Battle Ultimania, Scenario Ultimania, and Ultimania Omega editions for some games.[108] Square experimented with online content delivery with Final Fantasy IX Online Ultimania, but the move was criticized for forcing customers to buy a print guide while releasing most of the information online.[109] Another online Ultimania was planned for Final Fantasy XI, but it was dropped during development.[110] Square Enix has produced expanded editions to some books, such as Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania Revised Edition.[111] In addition to the Ultimania series, Square Enix also publishes an Official Complete Guide series of guide books.[112]\n\nA set of three artbooks have also been produced under the title The Sky: The Art of Final Fantasy. The set was first released in Japan in May 2002 by Digicube, then released in North America as a boxed set a decade later on October 17, 2012 by Dark Horse Books with additional postcards, prints, and booklets. A third edition was released in a slipcase by Dark Horse Books on July 17, 2013 without the additional pieces. Each book features concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, with the first book covering Final Fantasy I through III, the second IV through VI, and the third VII through X.[113][114][115]\n\nNovels and manga[]\n\nMany Final Fantasy games have been adapted as novels and manga series. With the advent of the Internet, web novels and digital publishing have also become common. These stories act as companion pieces, offering an interpretation of the game's events or expanding the plot of the games by depicting additional scenarios.\n\nTitle Original release date\n\nJapan\n\nNorth America\n\nPAL region\n\nFinal Fantasy II Muma no Meikyū April 1989[116] none none Notes:\n\nNovelization of Final Fantasy II written by Kenji Terada\n\nRoughly translates to \"Labyrinth of Nightmare\"\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-04-410604-1\n\nYūkyū no Kaze Densetsu Final Fantasy III September 1992[117] none none Notes:\n\nManga adaptation of Final Fantasy III by Yū Kinutani (art) and Kenji Terada (story)\n\nRoughly translates to \"Eternal Legend of the Wind\"\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-04-926037-3\n\nFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within none June 26, 2001[118] none Notes:\n\nNovelization of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within by John Vornholt\n\n(NA) ISBN 978-0-7434-2419-6\n\nSō no Kizuna March 2002[119] none none Notes:\n\nA side story to Final Fantasy: Unlimited\n\nRoughly translates to \"The Bonds of Two\"\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-04-427701-7\n\nFinal Fantasy: Unlimited After May 2002[120] none none Notes:\n\nA series of web novels published on the official Japanese Final Fantasy: Unlimited website, which continue the story of the anime\n\nLater published in a single anthology by DigiCube\n\n(JP) ISBN 4-88787-035-3\n\nFinal Fantasy XI ~The Out of Orders~ April 19, 2003[121] none none Notes:\n\nManhwa set in the Final Fantasy XI continuity, by Kim Byung Jin (art) and Kim Sungjae (story)\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7577-1424-3\n\nFinal Fantasy XI May 2003[122] none none Notes:\n\nSeries of novels set in the Final Fantasy XI continuity, written by Miyabi Hasegawa\n\nReleased in Japanese, German,[123] and French[124]\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7577-1424-3\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles ~Hatenaki Sora no Mukō ni~ January 10, 2004[125] none none Notes:\n\nManga adaptation of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles by Ryunosuke Ichikawa (three volumes)\n\nRoughly translates to \"Beyond the Endless Sky\"\n\n(JP) ISBN 4-7575-1455-7\n\nOn the Way to a Smile September 14, 2005[126] February 20, 2007[88] February 20, 2007[88] Notes:\n\nCollection of two novellas, \"Case of Denzel\" and \"Case of Tifa\", set in Final Fantasy VII's continuity, written by Kazushige Nojima and published in the book Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Prologue\n\nReleased in English in the Advent Children Limited Edition Collector's Set along with \"Case of Barret\" written specifically for that release\n\nFour more stories, \"Case of Yuffie\", \"Case of Red XIII\", \"Case of Shinra\", and \"Case of the Lifestream\", and the previous three were published in a single anthology in Japan by Square Enix, on April 16, 2009[127]\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7575-2462-0\n\nFinal Fantasy XII December 22, 2006[128] none none Notes:\n\nManga adaptation of Final Fantasy XII by Gin Amou\n\nFive volumes published from 2006 to 2009\n\n(JP) ISBN 4-7575-1830-7 (Vol. 1), ISBN 978-4-7575-2082-0 (Vol. 2), ISBN 978-4-7575-2263-3 (Vol. 3), ISBN 978-4-7575-2442-2 (Vol. 4), ISBN 978-4-7575-2650-1 (Vol. 5)\n\nAdventure Log none March 20, 2007[129] none Notes:\n\nOfficial Final Fantasy XI webcomic\n\nWritten and drawn by Scott Ramsoomair\n\nFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates 4 Komaansoroji Komikku March 1, 2008[130] none none Notes:\n\nManga adaptation of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates (2 volumes)\n\nTranslates to \"Ring of Fates 4-Panel Anthology Comic\"\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7577-4103-4\n\nFinal Fantasy IV December 25, 2008[131] none none Notes:\n\nTwo-volume novelization of Final Fantasy IV\n\n(JP) ISBN 4-7575-2458-7 (Vol. 1) ISBN 4-7575-2459-5 (Vol. 2)\n\nFinal Fantasy IV: The After March 26, 2009[132] none none Notes:\n\nNovelization of Final Fantasy IV: The After Years\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7575-2536-8\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII Episode Zero: Promise September 28, 2009[133] April 30, 2019 February 15, 2011 Notes:\n\nSeries of web novels written by Jun Eishima and first published on the official Japanese Final Fantasy XIII website, depicting the thirteen days leading up to the events of the game\n\nLater published in a single anthology by Square Enix on December 24, 2009[134]\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7575-2770-6\n\nFinal Fantasy: Memory of Heroes October 31, 2012[135] August 18, 2020 none Notes:\n\nNovel containing three short stories, each covering the story of Final Fantasy I, II, or III, written by Umemura Takashi[135]\n\n(JP) ISBN 978-4-7575-3775-0\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of Kingdom Hearts media\n\nReferences[]"
