        "text": "Final Fantasy XIII Doubled Up for PS3\n\nAnd there's Dragon Quest coming to the Wii too. First screens inside.\n\nNo one would ever accuse Square Enix of neglecting its franchises, and that attitude was on display in full force on Monday at the company's briefing ahead of the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Heading the company's franchise-heavy next-gen line-up is not one but two new Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation 3 and a Dragon Quest title for Nintendo's Wii.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII forms two of the spokes in what Square Enix is calling Fabula Nova Crystallis - the new tale of the crystal. This is a trio of games set in the same game world. The third game, Final Fantasy Agito XIII, is coming to mobile phones.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 games take place in the most advanced world shown in a Final Fantasy game yet. The crystals still forms a core part of the world's workings but they've become even more entwined with magic.\n\nThe first game is being handled by the Final Fantasy X team while the second comes courtesy of the creators of the Disney- Square Enix crossover hit Kingdom Hearts II.\n\nThere was even more next-gen Final Fantasy stuff too. Square Enix revealed during the event that it has a duo of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles games coming - one for the DS and one for Nintendo's new system, the Wii.\n\nSpeaking of Wii, Square Enix is getting behind the system early and with its biggest franchises too. In addition to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the Wii is also getting a Dragon Quest game named Dragon Quest Swords: The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors. The brief trailer shows a player using the Wii controller to slice and dice unwitting enemies.\n\nExpect more on the Wii and Square Enix's involvement with it at Nintendo's press conference on Tuesday.\n\nAlex Wollenschlaeger\n\nEditor, Kikizo Games"
