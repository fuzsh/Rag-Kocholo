        "text": "Final Fantasy 13's Japanese Release Date\n\nIn an recent interview Square Enix's CEO, Yoichi Wada, has revealed that Final Fantasy XIII's development is coming along fine. According to him, the game is on schedule and is to be released at the end of the year in Japan. Yoichi Wada also stated that the Japanese release date will be revealed in a couple of weeks.\n\nAfter GamesCom 2009, we should be seeing more of the game at the Tokyo Game Show this September.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII at GamesCom 2011\n\nAs a rather nice surprise, Square Enix has announced their line-up for GamesCom 2009. The top titles include Final Fantasy 13 and the newly announced Final Fantasy XIV. Check out the the press release below:\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix Co., Ltd.\n\nBrand: Square Enix\n\nPlatform: PLAYSTATION 3 computer entertainment system / Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from Microsoft\n\nGenre: RPG\n\nRelease Date: 2010\n\nSquare Enix proudly presents FFXIII, the latest instalment in the world-renowned FINAL FANTASY perk series. To celebrate the 13th numbered release in the series, Square Enix has undertaken a colossal project involving the development of various content for multiple platforms. FABULA NOVA CRYSTALLIS, defined in Latin as \"the new tale of the crystal,\" is made up of several different titles based on variations of the FINAL FANTASY XIII universe. While each title in the project features different characters, different worlds and different stories, all are ultimately based on and expand upon a common mythos.\n\nIn FFXIII, players will embark on a journey through the cityworld of Cocoon and the outerworld of Pulse, encountering and fighting alongside a diverse group of allies. Execute powerful attacks with weapons, perks and magic, and summon the enigmatic Eidolons with an evolved Active Time Battle system. Experience seamless transitions between real-time gameplay and in-game cinematics. Do you have the courage to face your destiny?\n\nWe can expect a new trailer and possibly a playable demo for those who attend the convention. GamesCom will be held in Cologne, Germany August 19th - 23rd.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 3 Multiplayer\n\nBlack Ops III is a video game developed by Treyarch Studios. The game is a sequel to the 2012 Black Ops 2 game and will be released on November 6, 2015 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.\n\nCOD: BO3 takes place 40 years after the events of Black Ops 2 and is set in the year 2065. Building slightly off Advanced Warfare, players can now wall-run and boost jump across maps with various BO3 weapons and attachments and other cybernetic perk augmentations. Cyber Cores and Rigs are new technologies that are available to players and allow them to choose three BO3 scorestreaks for multiplayer matches.\n\nThe boost jumps in BO3 work similarly to the Exo-Jumps in COD: Advanced Warfare. With this in mind, players can choose three BO3 perks for their loadout and an additional three with wildcards. In addition to the Pick 10 class loadout, Specialists can change the course of a MP match with their special weapons and abilities. Rather than being able to access the Specialist's weapon or ability at will the powerful BO3 specialists abilities need to be charged up by taking out enemies and completing objectives, like in BO3 CTF.\n\nThe multiplayer in BO3 features changes from that of previous COD games, as some new mechanics have been added to the multiplayer maps. These new features, e.g. wall-running, have been added to the popular BO3 NUK3TOWN map which is also a pre-order bonus, like Nuketown 2025 for COD: BO2. The brand new Nuketown map is back with a fresh take on the classic run-and-gun action. The Zombies mode also returns in Black Ops III with its own XP progression system and might get its own zombies themed NUK3TOWN spin-off.\n\nIn addition to the normal retail version of the game, other Black Ops 3 versions include the Digital Deluxe Edition, Hardened Edition and the rare Juggernog Zombie Edition.\n\nSource: The Black Ops 3\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts Multiplayer Perks\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts is an upcoming first person shooter video game and is to be released for PC, PS3, Wii U, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox 360 on November 5, 2013. In Call of Duty: Ghosts, for the first time, the player will be able to alter their experience on each map, with Dynamic Maps coming into play for the first time. In terms of loadouts there's a new class of weapon called the marksman rifle, which sits between sniper rifles and assault rifles. Further killstreak points can be unlocked by sacrificing your secondary weapon or primary weapon attachments.\n\nEvery Perk has a set point value from 1 to 5, and you have 8 points to use how you want. Perks in Ghosts have been updated in a manner that borrows a few ideas from Treyarch's \"Pick 10\" system from Black Ops 2. Pointstreaks return from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and are also available as Assault, Support or Specialist pointstreaks. Assault bonuses can only be earned in the space of a single spawn and Support bonuses build up over time. Call of Duty: Ghosts, for the first time, the player will be able to alter their experience on each map, with Dynamic Maps coming into play for the first time."
