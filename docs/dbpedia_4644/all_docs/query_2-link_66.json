It's a sad world we live where people no longer care about huge adventure games.\n\nI don't think people \"don't care\" about adventure games, it's just that there's a ceiling of around 5 million sales for anything besides the massive breakouts like Zelda, Horizon, cyberpunk, baldur's gate, Elden ring, ect. Truth is people just don't care about Final Fantasy, and to a slightly lesser extent traditional style JRPGs, in huge numbers anymore.\n\nSad for sure, but the solution is probably to scale back production and focus on innovation.\n\nSaito Hikari\n\nJul 3, 2021\n\n3,273\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,308\n\nPeople knew Rebirth was inevitable before they even knew that 16 existed.

They are just going to change their release strategy. Its fair to say a good chunk of the prospective FF audience is on PC, and in Japan, they are on the Switch, so I expect S-E to adapt to that, especially when the new Switch comes out. They aren't going to abandon Sony either.\n\nI also do not expect the remakes or games like Octopath Traveler 2 to stop. You have to have something in between your tentpole releases, and you need smaller games for your younger developers to get experience. Honestly I expect Square to go back to what they were in the 90s, more akin to the PS1 days.\n\nHolundrian\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n10,057\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,313\n\ngiven that 13 and 15 sold better the solution is fabula nova crystallis 2\n\nduckroll\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n12,380\n\nSingapore\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,314\n\nGames should sell well by virtue of their quality and ambition in my perfect world.\n\nVagrant Story came out 24 years ago and didn't sell all that well.

This reaction to Rebirth is bonkers though.\n\nIt's late-stage memberberries addiction, which is understandable of course with Rebirth being a game bursting at the seams from memberberries 🫐\n\nThe Final Fantasy brand dying might be a good thing long term. As a fan of the franchise it's such an unknowable beast drowning in baggage and lack of identity since X. At this point it's a series of varying ARPGs with similar iconography that ends with the party killing god with the power of friendship. The ties that bound the games are looser than they've ever been, and the weight of expectations on the brand seems to be more damaging for the games than helping.\n\nBlackleg-sanji1\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n57,596\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,316\n\ngiven that 13 and 15 sold better the solution is fabula nova crystallis 2\n\nAmen.

This makes absolutely no sense; why would someone quit the franchise forever just because this one game (technically in a different series of games of sorts from the FF7 remake titles) plays differently?\n\nHell, XV doesn't even play *that* much differently from XVI\n\nIf people lapsed after XV and Remake from Rebirth specifically, it sure as hell wasn't because of XVI\n\nI mean the sales collapse is stark. XV and Remake both hit 700k+ physical launch weeks in Japan, while 16 didn't hit a half that, and now Remake opened at 1/3 of the XV/Remake numbers and still hasn't gotten to 16's launch number in 7 weeks.\n\nIt might take 10-11 weeks for Rebirth to hit 16's launch sales number.\n\nThere's a lot that goes into a collapse like that, I'm just saying if you piece together the various factors (PS5 exclusivity being the biggest issue), you can lose thousands of players for each reason.\n\nKnowing that the game was split in 3 was also problematic; it made selling the middle one a fair bit tougher like in any trilogy where the middle part doesn't reach a satisfying conclusion.\n\nWut, like they turned when FF became an MMO, a hallway simulator and a boy band game? 😂\n\nI agree with your other two points, but there's nothing irreversible about fandom\n\nFair point. I actually think FF will probably be stronger in the long run.\n\nAll it takes is Square learning its lesson here (Visions of Mana, DQ 3 2D-HD, DQ 12) with the next set of big releases getting Switch 2 iterations, and things can get back to track.\n\nFF17 can easily get back to 500k+ launch expectations with the right positioning (a return to form).\n\nFF7's 3rd game should also be an easier sell as the \"conclusion\" game, though I do hope that they put Remake/Rebirth on Switch 2 before that comes out.\n\nAt some level, you have to go where the gamers are.

There are so many insane things happening throughout the game and at no point do the characters ever act like actual human beings. Even within the game world, the way some of the most glaring issues are simply handwaved away or straight up ignored is mind-boggling. The characters themselves are fun and have a lot of interesting interactions, but there were plenty of moments where someone did something and everyone continued as if nothing happened. In real life you'd immediately confront that person and talk it out, not here though.\n\nThe game tries to tell an overall serious and \"deep\" story, while basically being closer to Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nCheers for the responses.\n\nI've been seeing so much glowing praising for the story & character work in Rebirth that I was starting to wonder if they'd somehow deftly handled this, but it seems it's just not something most people care about? Personally it's the number one thing that completely takes me out of a story. I'm sure there are some good character moments in Rebirth, but if the characters stop acting believable in order to move past plot points, it's definitely not for me.\n\nI can't say I'm surprised. I'd figured there was basically no chance they actually address any of this since playing Remake, but it's still disappointing to hear.

They 100% nailed this part.\n\nWhen it comes to how they act during story moments however, they're dumb as rocks at times, letting villains who are standing right there literally walk away because.. reasons, and that's not to mention the characters not reacting at all during moments they definitely should.\n\nTruth be told, it's the characters that are hard carrying the game, not the actual story itself.

The game is chock full of wonderful character moments (a lot of them due to the very smart decision to tie every single side quest to one of the party members so you get extra bonding them with them) but they're still going to behave strangely during key story sequences. Like it or not, the game's original story and the new story both require a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief.\n\ndglavimans\n\nNov 13, 2019\n\n8,370\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,331\n\n.\n\nI mean I definitely understand being concerned about more and more games having gambling and gacha mechanics, but also I feel that there is plenty to play in the same or similar genres, all without any microtransactions, as I posted above.\n\nGame companies are way overspending on their budgets, and I think that's coming to bite them in the ass when you have great games like FF Rebirth selling, like, over a million copies, and people freaking out that it was a massive failure.

As a fan of the franchise it's such an unknowable beast drowning in baggage and lack of identity since X. At this point it's a series of varying ARPGs with similar iconography that ends with the party killing god with the power of friendship. The ties that bound the games are looser than they've ever been, and the weight of expectations on the brand seems to be more damaging for the games than helping.\n\nI really wonder if the consolidation happening there right now just leads to some of these FF teams creating new entries in the franchise that are practically defined by the team making them, and each team working out it's own style. It's funny to think about, but I see what happens with a franchise like Call of Duty, where the fan base is sorta segmented based on their preferred developer, and the devs being the main distinction. FF having something similar happen to it would be interesting, as it could end up setting expectations within the current FF fanbase(i.e CBUI making games that grow off of Remake/Rebirth, CBU3 making single player FF games that grow off of XVI), and maybe make it more digestible for new fans since they'll have a better understanding of what kind of game they're getting into(This is a CBUI type game, or this is a CBUIII type game). It sounds odd to think of FF being segmented like that, and it sounds more problematic as it would essentially segment an already strugglying fanbase, but I gotta wonder if a strategy like that would, overtime, end up helping long term in solidifying an identity for the franchise. Like i'm even seeing something similar happen with the Yakuza series where now we have fans of the turn based games, and classic fans of the action based ones. Just a thought, but it is one i've thought about for a minute now.\n\nduckroll\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n12,380\n\nSingapore\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,334\n\nUser banned (3 days): Trolling over multiple posts\n\nYou've basically come into this thread and thrown insults at FF7 fans and are then asking \"why you mad?\"\n\nLook inward, friend.\n\nYou don't understand how much I'm enjoying this.

A lot of XIV players aren't even familiar with the series outside of XIV and now you've pulled in a bunch more. CBU3 is their most popular dev team, a lot of players vibe with them and would support future work if it's accessible. Now, that same dev team is behind that new mainline game, FFXVI, but the platforms that the majority of the XIV playerbase are on can't even access the game. Then, a half year later, another mainline entry releases, and not even that game is available on those platforms. Infact, they've so poorly conveyed that the prequel, Remake, isn't even Epic exclusive anymore, that there are people I've recently talked to that don't know the game is on Steam or was confused as to what Integrade even meant in regards to Remake.\n\nNow they're attempting to build a base through XIV on a platform that hasn't received any of the last three mainline titles and where the chance of receiving a spinoff or a non FF game is a coin flip. There's no communication, as for example, Octopath 2 was announced for Xbox months after it released for Switch/PS/Steam despite the first game being on Xbox, with a release date for \"Early Spring.\" We're walking out of Q1 without a word.\n\nHow in the world do they expect to build trust, build their playerbase, and retain players with plays like these? Quality control is only one piece of the puzzle and isn't going to magically solve all their issues.\n\nSpehornoob\n\nNov 15, 2017\n\n9,844\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n#3,336\n\nuhhh\n\n(newly reinvigorated by the TV show)\n\nAnd that's not to dismiss the success of other games that are growing in success like the Like a Dragon series, Metroid is more popular than ever, etc.\n\nFF isn't like a colossal giant anymore, but games don't need to have the ridiculous budgets they're being allotted.
