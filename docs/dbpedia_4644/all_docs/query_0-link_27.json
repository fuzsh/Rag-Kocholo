He says that “for Type-0 and Versus XIII we are giving 100% to development.” It should be noted, however that the team has used their know-how from developing FINAL FANTASY XIII in order to create XIII-2 with a much shorter development period, and as such, the reason why it will release ahead of time.\n\nFINAL FANTASY Type-0 is out next month, and with XIII-2 out in December/January, the best we can hope for is a proper Versus reveal soon after."
