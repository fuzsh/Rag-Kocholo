        "text": "FINAL FANTASY XIII was announced to the world in 2006. It was touted as being the next generation of FINAL FANTASY, of RPGs, and of Square Enix itself. When we viewed it we all saw the character Lightning fighting in what was supposedly the game’s actual combat system. The visuals and the atmosphere dazzled gamers and we were all enamored by the visage of the warrior fighting. What we were seeing was the future of Square’s ambition and the potential fruits of their labours.\n\nIn truth what we all witnessed was not so. The combat in the FFXIII’s initial trailer was a lie. The “main character” was a lie. The plot gamers were fed was a lie. The FINAL FANTASY XIII that the world witness was a lie.\n\nWat was presented at E3 2006 was merely a concept trailer. Basically the culmination of ideas thrown together to look pretty and to give everyone a good impression on a non-existent game. Square hadn’t actually done anything for FINAL FANTASY XIII. The initial trailer shown was all they had. Gameplay hadn’t even been finalized, the world at large for the game’s setting wasn’t fully crafted. Hell, even the main character wasn’t chosen yet. Before the trailer was even released Square had been planning on using Vanille as the main character (which would have improved the game’s narrative in my opinion). But since they already revealed FFXIII’s existence (or lack thereof) and Lightning in the trailer Square forced themselves to switch to her instead since everyone in the world already saw her. That’s a big strike one right there.\n\nAfter jumping the gun at E3 Square scrambled to actually cobble something together that actually resembled a game. But there were a few problems with this.\n\n1: There was no unified vision for the game. Everything from character rolls, to the story, and even gameplay were up in the air. Nothing was on a straight path causing part one of the FFXIII’s downfall.\n\n2: There was a lack of communication between departments working on the game. Square thought it would be brilliant to make FFXIII’s development staff the largest in the series’ history (and probably the company’s as a whole). Everyone trying to work in these conditions couldn’t and the game suffered immensely for it.\n\n3: In another stroke of brilliance Square decided to keep everything about the game top secret so news outlets and even beta testers couldn’t find out anything. This large scale attempt at secrecy caused crucial information to be delayed between teams working on the game. Check points 1 & 2 for why this approach hurt the game.\n\nSquare has also found themselves reveling in hypocrisy regarding FINAL FANTASY XIII’s platform of development. It was announced as a PlayStation 3 exclusive to the world over. Indeed Square was so adamant on this that despite the fact they themselves acknowledged the PS3 was tricky to code for they were determined to make FFXIII for the system and even publicly announced that all FINAL FANTASY games would be exclusive for PlayStation only. Square and Sony have had such a good relationship since FINAL FANTASY VII why ruin that now? To appeal to the Western gamers that had no interest in the game, of course. Square announced that FFXIII would be ported to the Xbox 360. What seemed like a victory for Xbots turned out to be a loss for all. The game still didn’t have a unified vision at this point, key people are leaving the company left and right, and now Square has damned themselves in the eyes of Japanese gamers for betraying them and flat out lying about both the individual game and the series as a whole it would seem. Trying to port FFXIII to another system only served to increase development time and apply even more pressure than before. And the sad part is Xbox fans didn’t bother with the game. It fell off their radars quickly leaving only the true FINAL FANTASY fans who were only on PlayStation to begin with. The subsequent sequels have done even worse in this regard. Another odd factor is how Square heavily favoured the PlayStation version of the game. I a few very controversial advertisements for the game, Square displayed footage from the PS3 version and tried to pass them off as 360 footage. They did this more than once. Why port the game if you aren’t even going to properly advertize it? In this instance Square made no attempt to really apologize for misleading people except with a simple “Sorry, our bad.”\n\nIt wasn’t until Square crafted a playable demo for FINAL FANTASY XIII that they were finally gaining some ground on how to develop the game further. This was possibly the biggest problem here. The demo, being a demo, is linear and in no way reflects the final product. But Square felt it did and based the entirety of FFXIII on this one, dare I say, “passable” build on an unfinished game. The demo, as I said before, was linear and only gave the player control over one character. Being an RPG and in clear defiance of the previous eleven games in the series, barring FINAL FANTASY X, this was clearly not the way to go for the next installment of a once venerated series with a rich legacy behind it. When Motomu Toriyama tried to defend the game’s linearity he said reviewers, and by extension gamers, were approaching the game from “a Western point of view” were players are used to playing games with open world environments and are given a bit more freedom in what they do from the start. That’s not the case at all, Toriyama. Again, I call upon the previous games in the series, this time including FFX. From the start players are given so much to do and see and people expected this from FINAL FANTASY XIII. If The Elder Scrolls or MASS EFFECT deviated like this there would be just as much backlash for it. Even FINAL FANTASY X raised a few eyebrows when it was revealed it was to be linear much in the same way that FINAL FANTASY XIII is. The difference between the two however is very quickly down the line FFX gave you some options. You were able to pick up certain items and interact with people from the start. You could even go back to previous areas if you wanted to. You couldn’t progress the story in that way but it was an option. You couldn’t even do that in FFXIII. What makes this worse is that the level of exploration was almost zero in the game. Again, if you were at least allowed to return to any previous area it could have made the game much more enjoyable. But because that isn’t there there is so much lost potential and the game once again suffered because of that. And unlike FFX, FFXI, and FFXII there wasn’t even an accessible airship to use at least, which really should have been there. After trying to defend FFXIII’s linearity after so long Toriyama finally had to admit that the complaints were valid after all.\n\nOne more thing regarding the game’s linearity, there was a lot of cut content form the game such as the NORA base, Serah and Lightning’s house, and even a zoo. There was so much cut content in fact that it was commented that the cut content alone was enough to make another game. Which they did. Unnecessarily. People complained about there being nothing to do or to explore and Square claims their removal of certain locales was justified to lower the volume of the game and shorten it and implied the cut contend would be used in the case of a sequel, which it wasn’t. Why would a developer make an RPG smaller and shorter? What logic is there in that decision especially considering its a FINAL FANTASY game.? Better yet, why exactly is Motomu Toriyama still allowed to make decisions at the company? Simple. To create, as I’ve always described it as, a sequel no one wanted to a game no one liked.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII-2 is what happens when everyone hates FINAL FANTASY XIII and they expect FINAL FANTASY Agito XIII and FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII to be delivered. When Square, or rather Motomu Toriyama, was questioned on why they decided to develop XIII-2 and not Agito XIII and Versus XIII at the time they claimed it was because there was a large fan demand for the game across the world. There wasn’t. We all know there wasn’t. For Toriyama to even attempt to mask his intentions to create another game for himself is despicable, selfish, and underhanded. Its not as if Agito XIII and Versus XIII were mere concepts Square was mulling over and only ever mentioned once or twice (though by the way they act you’d think this was the case). FIANL FANTASY Agito XIII for mobile phones and PSP and FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII for PS3 were announced to the world as part of a big project involving FINAL FANTASY XIII. We all know about them and yet Square has chosen to put off developing them to satisfy Toriyama’s own fantasy in an attempt to “repair” the damage done by FFXIII.\n\nThough FFXIII-2 improved the gameplay from the previous game and gave players more options for exploration the game suffers from trying to bog players down with these new elements. In past games in the series side-quests and areas of interest were given to players as the came across them on their own, allowing them to approach them at their leisure. With FFXIII-2, coupled with the bad pacing and incoherence of the story it served to detract from the experience of being able to truly traverse something open world. Only a few locations were new to the game and even though Toriyama claimed the game built upon what was created in FFXIII like with FFX-2, XIII-2 failed in that regard instead tossing out everything that was established in the first game and introducing new elements never even hinted at in FFXIII. This is not “building on”. This is completely crafting something separate from the original and only barely related to it. FFX-2 took characters and locations and expanded them to fit the evolution of the world its predecessor began. People were met again and locales were revisited. Everything was changed in fitting with the plot from FINAL FANTASY X. FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 didn’t do this. The game’s plot was basically an entirely new game set in what might as well have been a completely separate world.\n\nAnother damning thing about the game was how much Square played it up to be a big deal. As if fans everywhere wanted the game to be made and not the other two games Square revealed. As I have already established and as you yourself could find out this was a complete lie on Square’s part with Motomu Toriyama leading the lies and carrying out his own fantasy involving Lightning. The previous sequels in the series were mostly downplayed and in no way negatively impacted future titles. The only possible exception to this may have been FINAL FANTASY VII: Advent Children. Being a film sequel to the most popular game in the series was of course something to publicize. FINAL FANTASY X had the sales and universal critical acclaim to garner a sequel. FINAL FANTASY XII: Reventant Wings was a small game used to continue “The Ivalice Alliance” side series and pick up in the middle of Vaan’s time as a sky pirate and on top of that takes place completely separate from the original game and crafts a plot unique from FFXII. FINAL FANTASY IV: The After Years and subsequently FINAL FANTASY IV: Interlude were small games given to fans as a bit of fanservice. And again, the plots were completely separate from FFIV. XIII-2’s plot was clumsily shoe horned into FFXIII’s continuity and actually negatively affected the plots for FINAL FANTASY Agito XIII and FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII since the three games share a common mythology. One of the deities of Versus XIII, who plays a pivitol role in the game’s plot mind you, was added to FFXIII-2 as little more than a backdrop for the characters. Much like Lightning herself in the game the goddess Etro served almost no purpose other than to retcon FINAL FANTASY XIII’s plot.\n\nWhy? Because Motomu Toriyama wanted to continue using Lighting even though she didn’t make a big impression on people and the way the story of FINAL FANTASY XIII played out she wasn’t even the main character of the game. FINAL FANTASY XIII had no central protagonist. The story instead revolved around all six people in your group and how their own storylines intersect with one another. This made for a truly character driven story unseen in previous iterations of the series. A player driven story does not work they way Square thinks it does and FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 is a glaring example of this. If you really want to damn Toriyama for his single minded “vision” for the series you have to look back and recognize that Toriyama said he wanted to do XIII-2 so he could make a story where Lightning “ended up happy”. Why? She wasn’t the main character. She DID end up happy when she and the others save the world. What more needs to be done? The game is over and fans want the other two games you guys mentioned before but have been almost completely silent about since their introduction.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that FINAL FANTASY Agtio XIII was renamed FINAL FANTASY Type-0 because it “didn’t resemble” FINAL FANTASY XIII and FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII in terms of story anymore. Square was telling us this five years after the initial announcement of the game so they could reintroduce it and Versus XIII to the public while at the same time announce FINAL FANTASY XIII-2. With all of the cut content (not) being used and a “unified” vision for the game XIII-2 was made in roughly one-and-a half years. Which is Square’s way of telling us they had almost two years to work on Type-0 and Versus XIII but they didn’t. Instead they indulged Toriyama once again to work on a game that advertized Lightning as a central figure in the story, even featuring her in the game’s logo and on the cover by herself, yet made minimal impact on the story and had almost no interactions with the actual player controlled characters. Then Square had the audacity to end XIII-2 the way they did despite the claims to make Lightning “happy” at the end and forced a DLC ending for players to buy if they wanted to see how everything “truly ends”. The DLC did nothing for the story. It was the same ending from before but from Lightning’s point of view. It changed absolutely nothing and still left players with a “To be continued…” message. Toriyama claimed the message didn’t signify another entry, just that it was the end of XIII-2. Several key people from Square reaffirmed this stance until Toriyama himself decided to contradict what he told people (sound familiar?) and work on a third game with Lightning in it.\n\nSide note, DLC was promised for FFXIII. Square also stated you could control the camera during cutscenes on the PS3 version. Can anyone tell me where I can find these features? Because they are sorely missing from my copy of the game.\n\nLightning Returns: FINAL FANTASY XIII is a title dripping in pseudo-nepotism on Toriyama’s part. No one asked for one sequel, why do a second? Especially since that previous sequel got even lower sales and reception than the original game itself. The game pretends to be an action RPG further distancing itself from its predecessors when in reality its still turn based. Being able to control Lightning’s movement during encounters does not immediately nullify the very blatant ATB gauge on the screen. LR is an open world game in an attempt to “beat [The Elder Scrolls V:] Skyrim” according to Toriyama. He actually said this in an interview. He also said the costumes that Lightning gets in game were done because a lot of people bought costumes for FINAL FANTASY XIII-2. That’s their reasoning. They are basing half of the game’s gameplay on the fact that out of all DLC bought for XIII-2 most of it were costumes. The point of the plot? To make a story where “Lightning ends up happy.” That was your reasoning for doing XIII-2 was it not? And that was something you failed at spectacularly. Toriyama seems adamant at getting this point across to people because he’s slid the topic into interviews for no reason other than to direct attention to his own intents for the story. In several interviews he’s brought this up just as things were wrapping up and there were no more questions to be asked. During the reveal for LR Toriyama actually compared Lightning to a vase of roses. And he’s working on several scenarios to display aspects of Lightning’s character that didn’t exist until this game existed.\n\nLightning was a flat character with somewhat weak motivations in FFXIII. But in XIII-2 and LR her personality has been changed and her motivations no longer match the person Toriyama originally introduced. In FINAL FANTASY XIII Lightning and her companions were determined to fight their fate and not bow down to a higher force just because it wanted them to. In FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 that’s exactly what Lightning does. She bows down to a higher force because it wants her to and she doesn’t fight it or question it. Was this the strong willed and independent woman we met in the first game? No its not. And in LR Lightning views herself as a “savior” and as a warrior for the gods. None of this matches up at all. Lightning went from strong willed and independent to subservient and quiet to crusader and “savior” over the course of three different games in a row. Her character is completely changed each time just to fit the plot of the new game. If these installments were made years apart from one another it could be argued that the new characterization was done to fit the times and reintroduce the character and setting to audiences (see DmC). But the so-called “Lightning Saga” (I have to hack every time I say it) was done consecutively. There was no reason to change what Square was trying to pass of as the main character of a game with no main character and as “the face of Japanese gaming.” Yeah. They actually said that last part themselves.\n\nAnd on top of this, when Square finally got of their asses and actually worked on FINAL FANTASY Agito XIII it was finished in no time. And released solely in Japan despite being localized for other territories and with Square commenting they developed the game specifically to appeal to Western gamers to begin with. Another bit of irony here is that Type-0 was the first PSP game to be developed on two UMDs but because of the protracted development cycle, the second to release on two UMDs. Even then a third multi-UMD game was released afterward. A prequel was recently done, borrowing the original game’s original name. And you guessed it, its not leaving Japan anytime soon.\n\nMeanwhile FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII was relabeled FINAL FANTASY XV and was moved from PS2 to PS3 and finally to PS4. You read that correctly. Versus XIII and FFXIII were both originally planned for PS2 as early as 2004 and early development had started for FFXIII at least. But because of the huge reception of the “FINAL FANTASY VII Technical Demo for PS3”, Yoichi Wada, in all his infinite stupidity, order the development team for FFXIII to move it over to PS3. Subsequently Versus XIII was also moved (twice) and for some reason Square decided to scrap everything they did for FINAL FANTASY XIII thus far and start over from scratch. Why? Who fucking knows. All of this snowballed into the clusterfuck development of FFXIII. The protracted development time of the game also negatively affected FINAL FANTASY XIV which was being developed at the same time and as I’ve said before, Versus XIII. Things were so bad that FFXIV languished because more people were working on XIII-2 than it even though FFXIV was the second MMO in the series and should have taken priority above all else. This forced Square to forgo subscriptions from players to make up for the lackluster game and forced them to delay the PS3 version for three years and relaunch the entire thing as FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn with a PS4 version to follow as well. Doing this again forced Versus XIII on the back burner and made Square turn it into FINAL FANTASY XV and move development again. This time to the PlayStation 4.\n\nFabula Nova Crystallis: FINAL FANTASY XIII was a major failure for Square Enix. The project devolved into focusing on Lighting, a character not too many people outside of Japan are fond of, caused several key people to leave the company, and even severely tarnished not only Square’s but Motomu Toriyama’s reputation. Before he became director for “The Lightning Saga” *hack* *cough* he was responsible for several key moments in FINAL FANTASY VII such as the bombing mission, Cloud’s cross dressing, and the fall of Sector 7. He was also responsible for all event scenes in FINAL FANTASY X as well as the character’s back stories in the game. Both games are heralded as some of the best in video game history and to have him go from those masterpieces to the massacre of events that is FINAL FANTASY XIII’s “legacy” is atrocious. Sure, Square tried to change the projects name by dropping the “XIII” due to Type-0’s name change but that itself should have been an early warning sign of things to come.\n\nThe project was designed to have three games, each bearing the moniker FINAL FANTASY XIII, exist in a shared mythology much more than the earlier entries in the series. Though the games’ stories were wholly independent from one another, (you wouldn’t see Lightning paling around with Ace from Type-0 or see Noctis from FFXV running around Cocoon) crystals, gods, and even l’Cie were supposed to bind the three games together in a way completely unique to them alone. But this failed. FINAL FANTASY Agito XIII became FINAL FANTASY Type-0, FINAL FANTASY Versus XIII became FINAL FANTASY XV effectively removing it from the project all together and FINAL FANTASY XIII, the flagship title produced lukewarm reactions and even colder received sequels. Obviously being the flagship game FFXIII to precedence over its two brothers-in-arms but once it was finished, good or bad, that should have been the end of it. But it wasn’t. Square fumbled the ball greatly and the fans had to pay the price. Lies, constant delays, and the overall feeling of mediocrity from a once greatly respected company.\n\nDespite what I have said here, as I mentioned briefly above, I have a copy of FINAL FANTASY XIII and I honestly really like it. Its not perfect and there are glaring flaws with it but I like it. I also have a copy of FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 and I’ve made my point on that game already. My disappointment here is not with FFXIII itself but with the situation surrounding it and Square’s refusal to see reason. IF FFXIII-2 were to still exist it should have been done after both Agito XIII (Type-0) and Versus XIII (FFXV) were done and out the door. The whole mythos they tried to create could have been given a better treatment in the game after everything was established and therefore the story could have flowed better. Or actually have been good.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XV is on its way to PS4 at some point soon. Lightning Returns is finished so there should be no excuse. And FINAL FANTASY Type-0 is still nowhere to be seen for fans outside of Japan. On the plus side, FINAL FANTASY XIV is doing well and its a step in the right direction for the series and for Square Enix. If Dragon Quest X were up to snuff then maybe things would be complete for Square but that’s another story entirely.\n\nNo matter what, FINAL FANTASY XV is my number one priority for PlayStation 4, with Kingdom Hearts III a very close second. I have been waiting over seven years for it and even if Square decides to milk it and whore out Noctis for all they’re worth the same way they’ve been using Lightning (she was practically the main character of Dissidia 012: FINAL FANTASY; why was Tifa praising her fighting style?) I for one will buy into them. And if by some stretch of the imagination FFXV and God forbid KHIII are not what we all hoped they’d be then I suppose I may truly be done with Square Enix once and for all. It would take something pretty big to win back everyone after that. At least there’s FINAL FANTASY X/X-2 HD Remaster to look forward to. And I already know that those two games will be spectacular."
