        "text": "<–The State of the Gamer: 7/11/17 The State of the Gamer: 7/25/17\n\nA weekly post updated every Tuesday detailing my current gaming projects. I have quite a backlog of games to either play or watch, and I’m hoping a weekly article will assist with my progress as my other accountable posts have done with reading and writing.\n\nI have an account at Grouvee, which is a essentially Goodreads for gamers, so please feel free to friend me there!\n\nOriginal source of the banner art is located here.\n\nCurrently Playing: 4\n\nTitle: Final Fantasy Type-0\n\nSeries: Final Fantasy/Fabula Nova Crystallis\n\nGenre: Action RPG – Fantasy\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nPlatform: PlayStation 4\n\nRelease Date: October 27, 2011\n\nDate Purchased: May 18, 2017\n\nDate Started: June 18, 2017\n\nProgress: Chapter 2\n\nNo progress this week. I’m still at the school and still trying to find time to play.\n\nTitle: Final Fantasy V\n\nSeries: Final Fantasy\n\nGenre: RPG – Fantasy\n\nDeveloper: Square\n\nPlatform: PlayStation\n\nRelease Date: December 6, 1992\n\nDate Purchased: Unknown\n\nDate Started: June 17, 2017\n\nProgress: Walz Castle\n\nI’m still at Walz Castle, but I managed to loot the basement and snag myself 3000 GP and an Elf Cloak. That stupid harpy down there attacked me three or four times, but I was able to run away, though it killed/knocked out two of my characters. I attempted to fight/obtain Shiva, but she and her cohorts kicked my ass even though I took the advice on GameFAQS of switching everyone to a Black Mage and casting Ice. I’m going to do some leveling and give it another try. I might look up another walkthrough and see if there are any more tips, or I may just continue on to Walz Tower and come back for her later.\n\nTitle: Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius\n\nSeries: Final Fantasy\n\nGenre: RPG – Fantasy\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nPlatform(s): iOS, Android\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2016\n\nDate Purchased: March 21, 2017\n\nDate Started: March 27, 2017\n\nProgress: Rank 28\n\nI had some trouble yesterday with the game crashing during one of the new Vortex missions, the Aquapolis, even after I restarted the Kindle. There was a nice long while where I wasn’t having this kind of trouble, but it seems like the instability is back. I drew a TON of new characters though. I’m going to keep Gau (FFVI), Freya (FFIX), and maybe Sabin (FFVI).\n\nNot much to say about the story line. I’m on Dinardo, but I’m just traveling through the caves at the moment hoping to find a town. I have a few Missions that center around this continent.\n\nTitle: The Room Three\n\nGenre: Puzzle, Mystery\n\nDeveloper: Fireproof Games\n\nPlatform(s): iOS, Android\n\nRelease Date: 2015\n\nDate Purchased: May 28, 2017\n\nDate Started: May 28, 2017\n\nDate Finished (1): July 4, 2017\n\nPlaying Duration: 37 days\n\nProgress: First ending completed\n\nI looked up how to get the other endings, and it was as I suspected. I haven’t had time to go back and obtain the items I need for it, but I’ll try to do that this week.\n\nGames Currently Watching: 2\n\nTitle: Phantasy Star\n\nSeries: Phantasy Star\n\nGenre: RPG – Fantasy/Science Fiction\n\nDeveloper: Sega\n\nOriginal Platforms: Sega Master System\n\nOther Platforms: Sega Genesis, Wii Virtual Console\n\nOriginal Release Date: December 20, 1987\n\nLet’s Player: Hungry Goriya\n\nDate Started: March 24, 2017\n\nProgress: Ongoing\n\nI haven’t watched any of this this week D: I think I’m like three videos behind so that will be a nice half hour or so of catch up.\n\nTitle: Mass Effect III\n\nSeries: Mass Effect\n\nGenre: Action RPG – Sci-Fi\n\nDeveloper: BioWare\n\nOriginal Platform(s): Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3\n\nOriginal Release Date: March 6, 2012\n\nLet’s Player: Olizandri\n\nDate Started: January 23, 2017\n\nProgress: 88%\n\nI have my progress at 88%, but I really only have one more video to watch for the main story. The rest of them are DLCs. I’m kind of heartbroken about what happened in the last video. *Spoiler* Admiral Anderson died ;_; I loved his character, and I loved his father-like relationship to Shepherd. His final line to her “You did good child…” ripped me apart. I’ll have more to explore about this in my review, but yeah, the feels were real ya’ll *end spoiler*\n\nGames Added to Backlog: 2\n\nTitle: Never Alone/Kisimi Ingithchuna\n\nDeveloper: Upper One Games\n\nRelease Date: November 18, 2014\n\nDate Added: July 13, 2017\n\nRecommended By: The Well-Red Mage\n\nI’m happy the WRM’s review reminded me about this. I saw the trailer for it game years ago (far longer ago than when I started doing these status posts), so of course I forgot about it. The graphics look beautiful, and there’s a chapter that features the northern lights *dreamy eyes*\n\nTitle: Until Dawn\n\nDeveloper: Supermassive Games\n\nRelease Date: August 25, 2015\n\nDate Added: July 16, 2017\n\nRecommended By: N/A\n\nMy husband started playing this the other day, and I looked like something I could get into, even though it’s a horror game. It seems to be more point, click, and choice as opposed to action. So long as I’m not being chased by anything that I myself need to run from (aka so long as I can close my eyes) I think I can handle it. If not, to a Let’s Play!\n\nTotal Games in Backlog: 121\n\nChange from Last Week: +2\n\nGames Added to Watch List: 0\n\nTotal Games on Watch List: 32\n\nChange from Last Week: 0\n\nGames Purchased This Week: 0\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nI think I found a prospect for a new banner, so I’ll try to work on that this week. Also, you’ll notice I have more details on the games I’ve added this week. I’ve started updating this in draft daily, so I have more time for those details. I’ve been trying to find a decent game organization app, but that appears to be nigh on impossible. Most of them either want to charge you up front or charge you on the sly after you already have the app. It’s irritating. I like Grouvee, but I wish there was an app for it that tied in with the website similar to Goodreads. Any suggestions would be most welcome!\n\nSo I watched Castlevania on Netflix at the recommendation of my big brother who has yet to steer me wrong! Holy shit was it amazing. This is how a video game should be adapted to visual media, because games are generally far too involved to be fully explored in at most a three hour time frame. It’s been green lit for another season with 12 episodes, which guarantees I’m not getting rid of Netflix anytime soon. Also Alucard…\n\nI didn’t know that his actual name is Adrian Tepes, which just makes him a thousand times cooler, because everyone with the name “Adrian” no matter how it’s spelled is awesome. And he has a really long sword ♥♥♥\n\nWhat are you currently playing and/or watching? Is it something new or old? Is it a first time run or a replay? What’s the genre? Would you recommend it? What’s on your radar to play next?\n\n<–The State of the Gamer: 7/11/17 The State of the Gamer: 7/25/17\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave"
