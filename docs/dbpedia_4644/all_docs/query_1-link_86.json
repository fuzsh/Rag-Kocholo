Here is a small list of some popular monsters, and what mythology they are taken from:\n\nBehemoth - Jewish mythology. A huge monster and a symbol of evil.\n\nAhriman - Persian mythology. Personification of evil (In Final Fantasy games, ahrimans are one-eyed flying creatures, looking like bats).\n\nAsura - Hindu mythology.

A wicked spirit, also known as Jinn.\n\nShiva - Hindu mythology. One of the greatest gods, sometimes regarded as the God. Unfortunately for all fans of the Final Fantasy version of Shiva - he is a man.\n\nRamuh - \"Ramuh\" is maybe a form of \"Rama\", the incarnation of Vishnu in Hindu mythology.\n\nPhoenix - Greek mythology. A bird that resurrects itself after dying (the item \"phoenix down\" also comes from there). The Asian phoenix (Chinese fenghuang is a different creature that might have been the inspiration for the monster as well.\n\nTitan - Greek mythology.
