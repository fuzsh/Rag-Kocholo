        "text": "Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIIIDeveloper(s)Square EnixPublisher(s)Square EnixYear introduced2009Genre(s)RPG, Action-adventureParent seriesFinal FantasyWebsiteOfficial site\n\nFabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII (ファブラ ノヴァ クリスタリス ファイナルファンタジーXIII, Fabura Nova Kurisutarisu Fainaru Fantajī Sātīn ) is the collective name of a series of games made under the Final Fantasy XIII label by Square Enix. Made in the same vein as the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and the Ivalice Alliance, Fabula Nova Crystallis (which means \"the New Tale of the Crystal\" in Latin) is based on various worlds and different characters, but each game will be \"ultimately based on and expand upon a common mythos.\" According to Square Enix, they all take place in the same universe, but are not directly related to each other.\n\nPlot and setting[edit | edit source]\n\nThe compilation appears to revolve around \"crystals that lead the world towards the future.\" Appearing as normal objects, the Crystals are an integral part of each world as represented in the games, although they will not be the central focus; instead, they will provide a background to other, more specific plots. However, the functionality of the Crystals has led the series' designers to pay special attention in creating the visual look of these worlds.\n\nCo-producer Shinji Hashimoto says \"Consider that development is simultaneously ongoing for three FFXIII's—each not only on different platforms (advertised as PS3 for FF Versus XIII and FFXIII (as well as Xbox 360 for FFXIII in the USA and Europe only), and PSP for FF Agito XIII), but [featuring] different worlds and stories that are bound by a common mythology [of the crystal]. By gaining inspiration from the mythology, these independent FFXIIIs evolve uniquely. The Fabula Nova Crystallis project is not a collection of sequels or ports but several original titles that exist alongside each other\".\n\nDevelopment[edit | edit source]\n\nThe current games in development within Fabula Nova Crystallis are:\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII (PS3, Xbox 360)\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 (PS3, Xbox 360)\n\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 (PSP)\n\nLightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII (PS3)\n\nThe development for each title is being handled within Square Enix through separate teams. This is reflected in the approach to making each title independent from the others while sharing a common backdrop. However, the character designs for the three officially revealed games are by Tetsuya Nomura, who is also the director of Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Each title will have its own style of gameplay: Final Fantasy XIII is an RPG, Final Fantasy Versus XIII is more action-oriented like Kingdom Hearts, and Final Fantasy Agito XIII is an online game."
