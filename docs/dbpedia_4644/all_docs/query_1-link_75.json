A coupon packaged with Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy will allow you to buy Final Fantasy half price, while a similar coupon included with The 3rd Birthday will halve the price of the sequel.\n\nFinal Fantasy received an impressive Silver Award from Pocket Gamer, with Ed Fear calling it “a much more tempting prospect than it has been for years”."
