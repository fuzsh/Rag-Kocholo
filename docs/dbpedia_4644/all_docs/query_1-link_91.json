The game is no longer \"Final Fantasy Versus 13.\" Instead, the developer has rebranded (or, quite possibly, reimagined) the mysterious video game as \"Final Fantasy 15.\"\n\nSquare Enix re-revealed the game at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference Monday, showing a \"Final Fantasy 15\" trailer â€” the first public demonstration of the game since 2011, when the last trailer was debuted.\n\nThe game was originally announced at E3 back in 2006 (yes, you read that right) as one portion of the three-part \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" games, which were loosely set in the same story world. The other two titles in the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" saw the light of day as \"Final Fantasy 13\" and \"Type-0,\" while \"Final Fantasy Versus 13\" continued to hide out in obscurity. By June 2012, the video game site Kotaku had begun to report that the game had been quietly cancelled.\n\nOn Monday, however, Square Enix revealed the game has indeed survived, and will be released for the PlayStation 4. It even showed footage claiming to be actual gameplay which, like most of the recent \"Final Fantasy\" titles, is far more fast-paced and action-heavy than the turn-based tactical games of the series' past. The developer didn't explain how \"Final Fantasy's\" legendarily convoluted storyline and lore have been adjusted to suit the shift in, well, the number of \"Final Fantasy XV.\"\n\nWatch the new trailer for the newly renamed \"Final Fantasy XV\" below.\n\nYannick LeJacq is a contributing writer for NBC News who has also covered technology and games for Kill Screen, The Wall Street Journal and The Atlantic.
