        "text": "This coming holiday season, it will be 5 years into the PS3’s life cycle. With the recent price drop announced at GamesCom in Germany and the release of the new handheld, the Playstation Vita, it is clear that we are reaching the end of the Playstation 3. The PS2 was in its sixth year when the PS3 was released, and despite the promised ten year life cycle, it doesn’t mean that a new home console won’t be announced and released before the tenth year is reached.\n\nSo! I’ve compiled a list of what I would love to see in the next iteration of the Playstation home console and why. Perhaps there are better suggestions out there, and if you are reading this and have such suggestions, I’d love to hear them.\n\nPSN advancements\n\nThe Playstation Network has done what it is suppose to do. Provide an online gaming experience, a store, and player communication. Pretty much the bare minimum. It’s no secret that XBOX Live is, leaps and bounds, a better online experience. Not only is the online experience so much better than PSN’s, but so is the multiplayer experience. Things such as game invites, communication and the UI (user interface) make everything interact almost seamlessly on the XBOX.\n\nSo what is SONY to do about this? In my opinion, copy the hell out of Microsoft!!! Why Not!? If your competitor clearly has the upper hand in a particular experience, make sure you achieve that same experience as closely to the competitor as possible. It won’t be the first time one company copies another companies successful ideas. The iPad now has numerous imitators as does the iPhone and iPod. But focusing on the game industry, Call of Duty 4 had the very best controls in a console FPS. Because of this, every FPS developer is using, if not a carbon copy, a very similar controller scheme for their games. CoD 4 also introduced kill streaks, which are not being implemented in such multiplayer games as Resistance 3, Medal of Honor, and Uncharted 2.\n\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter who did it first. What matters is who does it BEST. SONY can copy the Live experience, then iterate it to what is best for the Playstation brand.\n\nRAM (memory)\n\nMORE MEMORY!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRAM or memory in the PS3 currently stands at 256 megabytes for Main XDR RAM and 256 megabytes of GDDR3 VRAM. So what the heck does this mean? RAM? VRAM? XDR? GDDR3? WTF!?!?!?!? The following is MY understanding of how memory works. Keep in mind, I have NO idea what I am talking about. I did my own research and here is how I understand it to be.\n\nApparently, XDR RAM is very fast, very efficient and does this at less power than the GDDR3. This memory in the PS3 also runs at 3.2 Ghz, just like its Cell processor. That means that once the processor is overwhelmed with information, it can then access the XDR at the same speed the processor was already running. The GDDR3 memory isn’t quite as advanced as XDR but it is cheaper. At the time the PS3 came out, XDR was very expensive. That may be the reason why SONY went with a split memory instead of a unified one like the X360.\n\nTechnically, both systems have 512 megabytes of memory, but both systems use them differently. Just recently, Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Worldwide Studios, came clean and admitted that the PS3 cannot have Cross Game Chat due to the memory. This is where I get lost. How is it that the PS3 who has the same amount of memory as the XBOX 360 and the main XDR RAM is much faster and more advanced than the memory in the 360, cannot handle cross game chat? Clearly, the issue lies deep within the details of how memory is handled in each system in which I cannot explain myself.\n\nFor the PS4, I would love WAY more high quality memory. At least 2 Gigabytes (preferably 4 Gb) of XDR or XDR2 RAM would be awesome. Having more memory than needed is always a safe way of “future proofing” the system. SONY claimed this for the PS3 but clearly did not live up to that statement since it is confirmed it can’t handle cross game chat because of lack of memory. More memory would solve this along with any other possible problems or restrictions it may have to deal with down the road.\n\nProcessor\n\nWhen it comes to the Cell Processor, I don’t think SONY has to change much at all. Yes, it is difficult to code for but after 6 years and over 50 million consoles sold, I think it would be in the developers best interest to learn how to code for the Cell Processor properly and stop complaining. At 3.2 Ghz, it is still a pretty fast processor and because of the Cells unique architecture, it not only makes it difficult to code for but it has a tremendous upside. Sony’s first party developers still say they have yet to tap into the complete power of the Cell. Let’s give the Cell a second chance. There are rumors that SONY may be abandoning the Cell for something more “main stream” but, in my opinion, I say stick with it.\n\nUSB ports\n\nI am the proud owner of an original 60Gb PS3, which is now deceased :’( . For those of you unaware, that model had 4 usb ports. Currently, the slim models only have 2. I, personally, used all 4 ports. One for my PS Eye, one to charge a controller, one to charge my bluetooth ear piece and one to charge my iPod touch. It was very handy to have all 4 ports. Now, when I will be purchasing a new PS3, I will be limited to only 2 ports. This isn’t a big complaint on my part, but it does pose and inconvenience. Going back to 4 ports would be a good thing, especially with people who have the PS Move.\n\nManufacturing (Lead Solder)\n\nThis is very important, but the least likely to happen. Have you ever wondered, “Why are the current systems dying so much more than any previous console generations?” Well, I’ve got your answer.\n\nIn July of 2006, a directive called Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS took effect in the European Union. What this directive does is it banned the use of lead in electronics due to possible health hazards. All electronics are put together using solder (pronounced to americans as “sawder”). In the early days and as recent as the PS2 and original XBOX days, lead solder was used for the systems. For the current generation, lead FREE solder had to be used in order to do business in Europe. This wouldn’t be a problem except that lead solder is much stronger and resilient than lead free solder. Solder with lead can handle fluctuations of heat very well and remain undamaged by this. Lead free solder doesn’t handle heat fluctuations as well and can become weak and brittle, which leads to system failure. Important chips and connections become loose or broken all together. As a result, you will get either the Red Ring of Death (X360) or the Yellow Light of Death (PS3).\n\nWhile it is true that the fail rate of the PS3 is much better than that of the 360, it is still susceptible to failure none the less. I would want SONY to bring back the lead solder for the North American and Asian regions. Sorry Europe but you’re on your own…still love you guys.\n\nCross game Chat\n\nAs I mentioned earlier in the “RAM” section, it is impossible for the PS3 to have Cross game chat due to memory restrictions. As I said earlier, add more memory and give us this option that the 360 has had since the beginning.\n\nNew Web Browser\n\nI really appreciated having a web browser on my PS3. It was great in the early days when I would go to Hulu.com and watch my anime on my tv. As we all know, Hulu has since denied the PS3 browser from doing this because of the deal between SONY and Hulu…assholes! Even though I enjoyed the web browser, it was clearly inferior to the browser on my laptop or desktop computer. I think it would be in SONY’s best interest to include a high quality browser. Why, you ask? (if you didn’t ask, continue reading anyway). Perhaps including small ads of what is available in the PSN store will boost sales. Aside from the gaming websites I normally visit, I wouldn’t be aware of what is available in PSN. If I have to go to my computer to use the internet, I would stop paying attention to my gaming for that bit of time. If I could simply switch to my browser after I play a game, then noticed some PSN ads and became aware of what is available, I may be more inclined to make a purchase.\n\nNew UI (user interface)\n\nThe user interface in the PS3, known as the XMB (cross media bar), is a sleek and good looking interface. As good as I think it looks, I would like every other option to be easier to find. I was a fan of the original “blades” menu of the 360 because I was able to see all of my options immediately.\n\nBackward compatibility\n\nI am now very sad that my original, launch day PS3 had died. I am no longer able to play my PS2 games that I love so much. Why SONY removed this option, I have no idea. As a PS3 owner, I have spent WAY more money on games than ever before. I have a decent disc based and downloadable games library now that I don’t want to lose. Especially for my downloadable games, I want the PS4 to play my games. Once the PS4 is launched, the PS3 is still going to be getting new games which I want to be able to purchase and still play without having to connect an old console. Again, a matter of convenience.\n\nHard Drive\n\nIt started with 60 gigs and is now up to 320 gigs. I easily filled my 60 gigs to the point of having to delete things to make room for game data and new games. Hard drives are so cheap now that I fully expect a 1 Terabyte drive. That is one thousand gigabytes. With that much space, I won’t have to think twice if a game I want to buy will fit on my system or not.\n\nSeamless PS4/Vita intercommunication\n\nWith the recent announcement of the PS Vita, it was revealed that it will have features that will make it communicate with the PS3. Some Vita games can be played along with the PS3 version of the game. That is amazing! One person playing on the Vita and being able to play with his/her friends that are playing that same game on the PS3 is quite an achievement. Also, with the recent announcement of the Wii U, I think SONY has a great opportunity to create a similar experience by having the Vita and PS4 sync up and play together.\n\nComplete mouse and keyboard support\n\nCurrently, the PS3 has mouse and keyboard support, but is very limited. If the PS4 were to have mouse and keyboard for all of its games, it can give PC players good alternative. Many games are already made for consoles and PC’s. So why would PC gamers care? With new titles that push PC’s to their limit, gamers have to upgrade their desktops with new expensive memory and video/graphics cards. That alone can cost as much as a new console. Also, many console gamers only know the controller experience. A mouse and keyboard offers a lot more options at a fingers reach. If it means that a player can be better at a game by using a mouse and keyboard, people may be curious enough to, at least, try it out. This can be a gateway to more PC gaming.\n\nComplete cross platform (PC) compatibility\n\nAs I mentioned on the previous statement, their are still plenty of PC gaming happening in the world. For SONY, having PS4 to PC compatibility can benefit its games, such as, DC Universe. It was released for the PS3 and PC. Having more people play that game with a variety of gamers can increase the popularity of such games and increase their life span.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! That is all I can think of. I have high hopes that SONY will learn from their mistakes and come out swinging to retake the title it once held with the PS2 as best selling console."
