He was elected to the Royal Society for discoveries in chemistry. He produced his famous waterproof material by combining naphtha - a by-product of tar - with rubber and obtained a patent for the process in 1823. 'Mackintosh' remains a popular name for a raincoat to this day.\n\nBirth in 1766\n\nCharles Macintosh (registered as Mcintosh) was born on 29 November 1766, the son of George Mcintosh, merchant, and Mary Muir.The entry in the Old Parish Register for Glasgow includes the names of two witnesses to the baptism which was held on 10 December.\n\nBirth and baptism entry for Charles Macintosh (11 KB jpeg)\n\nNational Records of Scotland, OPR 644-1/14, page 338\n\n1841 Census\n\nIn 1841, Charles Mcintosh, aged 74, merchant in Glasgow, was living at Antermony House in Campsie in the county of Stirlingshire.
