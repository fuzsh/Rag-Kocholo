Three children: Ann Hutton, Enoch Hutton, and Sarah Elizabeth Hutton. Died in 1832 in Montgomery County, Maryland.\n\nCharles B. Hutton was a farmer and laborer who lived near the town of Brookeville in Montgomery County, Maryland for most of his adult life. It is likely that he was raised in nearby Anne Arundel County, where he married Mary Gardner in 1794.1 By 1800, Hutton and his family had moved to Montgomery County, where they lived with their two daughters.2 In December of 1803, Hutton began working for Brookeville resident Gerard Brooke, hauling food and supplies from the surrounding area into Brookeville, and cutting wood for the town's residents. Brooke would pay Hutton for his services in cash, food, and other crops including corn, straw, potatoes, and tobacco.3\n\nUnlike most of his neighbors in Brookeville, which was predominantly populated by members of the Quaker faith, Hutton was a slave owner. In 1800, Hutton owned thirteen slaves, although his slave ownership was reduced to five slaves by 1810. He continued to own slaves until his death in 1832, with his estate inventory indicating that he owned six slaves, including two children.4\n\nHutton continued to work in Brookeville until at least 1815. By that year, Hutton was able to purchase a 93.25 acre tract of land from Gerard Brooke that bordered one of the roads out of Brookeville.5 In 1828, Hutton took out a mortgage of $1,207.50 from Gerard Brooke's son, Richard, for which he used the 93.25 tract as collateral.6 The following year, Hutton purchased an additional 120 acre tract of land on \"Addition to Brooke Grove,\" a sprawling tract of land which several other prominent Brookeville residents also owned parts of.7 Hutton remained in Montgomery County until his death in 1832.8 At the time of his death, Hutton had acquired a considerable amount of wealth, with his estate valued at $1,777.98.9\n\nKyle Bacon, DAR Research Fellow, 2013\n\nNotes:\n\nANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY COURT (Marriage Licenses) April 6, 1794, Charles Hutton and Mary Gardner [MSA C113, 01/01/11/27].\n\nSecond Census of the United States, 1800, Population Schedule, District 3, Montgomery, Maryland for Charles Hutton, Roll 11, p. 186, Image 145.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTIONS (Mary Farquhar Green Collection) Account book of Gerard Brooke, 1802-1821 [MSA SC 566-1-98, 00/09/06/06].
