        "text": "We tried to give you the world, but God gave you heaven instead.\n\nHutton Thomas Walker of Garden City, was born June 27, 2020 in San Angelo, Texas to Blaine and Brittney Walker. He was called home to heaven on February 15, 2024. We were blessed to have three and a half action packed years to love and cherish our sweet Hutton.\n\n“As soon as I saw you, I knew an adventure was going to happen.” –Winnie the Pooh. What an accurate description for the boy who stole our hearts and filled our lives with movement! Hutton thrived on adventure, exploring, digging in his sandbox, climbing (then jumping), sprinting in his “runnin’ shoes”. He was always up for a race or a chase, hide-n-go-“peek,” or a little dance move. Family, friends, and friends he hadn’t met yet–he was always ready to play! He was fearless and free, and he certainly packed as much as he could in his years here. Hutton was all boy and all heart.\n\nHutton was so inquisitive and smart. He loved building, creating, and would always say, “I have an idea! I know! Maybe this will help!” He noticed the little things in his life and loved them big. A tractor in the field, a construction “excamator” on the road, his favorite song “You are my sunshine”, Paw Patrol or Blaze and the Monster Machines on the television, his favorite book, “Boo!”, or any book! These things brought him such absolute joy. He loved his little brother Hayes with a fierce brotherly love. Hutton loved waking him up in the morning, snuggling on the couch in the afternoons, and a quick wrestle any time! His incredible life gave us the magic, memories, and adventures that we will rely on and treasure for the rest of ours.\n\nHutton is survived by his parents, Blaine and Brittney, and his loving brother, Hayes. His grandparents: Henry and Shelley Chudej, Bart and Charlene Belew, and Stuart and Kathy Walker. Great grandmothers: Deborah Schraeder, Mary Kate Belew, and Alva Jean Walker. His aunts, uncles, and cousins: Kelley, Luke, and Koryn Galovich; Lindsey, Christopher, Henry, and Charles Kubes; Blake, Summer, and Nora Chudej; Morgan and Caroline Fowler; Brett, Brittany, Berkley, and Bristol Chudej; Dusty, Brianna, Cooper, and Sadey Walker; Colton, Shaelin, and Baby Belew; Cassidy, Grady, Barrett, and Baby Bergquist.\n\nHe is proceeded in death by great grandparents: Jerome and Carrie Chudej, Jerry and Katherine Black, Dennis Schraeder, Edward Belew, and Donald Walker.\n\nFuneral services and rosary will be held at St. Lawrence Catholic Church. The rosary will be Wednesday, February 21, 2024 at 6 pm, with the funeral on Thursday, February 22, 2024 at 10 am.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, we would be honored if you supported Noah’s Mark at noahsmark.org. “Noah’s Mark is a foundation formed to support families who have suffered the loss of a child unexpectedly.”\n\nArrangements are under the direction of Nalley-Pickle & Welch Funeral Home of Big Spring. Online condolences can be made at www.npwelch.com"
