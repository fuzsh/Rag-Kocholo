Solely co-written with and produced by Shane Weisman, Gabe calls this EP “the beginning of a new era of his musicality, songwriter and performer.”\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS:\n\nABOUT CLARK BECKHAM\n\nClark Beckham started singing in a gospel trio with his mother and father when he was 8 years old. He started playing Instruments around the same age. Today, he is as much of a profound instrumentalist as he is a vocalist. In 2015, his soulful, bluesy vocals along with his incredible talent on the piano and guitar took America by storm and Beckham finished as American Idol’s Season 14 runner-up. Since then he has performed with the Nashville Symphony, written with Brian McKnight, has been nominated for a Teen Choice award as Music’s Next Big Thing, and spent 3 years under Quincy Jones’ wing as an artist signed to his management company. He’s finished 4 national tours and planning for the next.\n\nJust years ago Beckham made his money playing and singing on the streets of Nashville. Whether practicing scales, learning songs, or just listening, he considers music the most major part of his life. In regards to music, Beckham states, “I think it, I speak it, I live in and around it, I make it and I do it.” He continues “I feel like music is as much a part of me as my own heart.”\n\nABOUT PETER COLLINS\n\nPeter Collins effortlessly melds R&B, Gospel, Folk, and Jazz with a sincerity and tenderness that will take your breath away.

Some of Country music’s best join our Southern Rounds stage at ANALOG in NASHVILLE on SEPTEMBER 18th: SEAN MCCONNELL, SONIA LEIGH, RUTHIE COLLINS, WESLEY DEAN, with host Dave Kennedy. Make sure to come out and check out these incredible songwriters who have written hits for ZAC BROWN BAND, BRETT YOUNG, and RASCAL FLATTS.\n\nSean McConnell\n\nSinger, songwriter, and producer Sean McConnell’s latest collection of songs A Horrible Beautiful Dream approaches the difficult task of asking questions of what one really thinks they know, in the simultaneous struggle of not being afraid of the answers that emerge. Musically, the project wraps McConnell’s rich voice in moments of dark intimacy as well as vivid brightness, and guests such as The Wood Brothers, Natalie Hemby, Audra Mae, and Dan Tyminski underscore McConnell’s versatility as creative partner and commentator. McConnell’s goal in the creation of A Horrible Beautiful Dream was an album reflecting the chaotic time in which it was made, but still striving for timelessness. “You can look at the suffering of the world and you can look at the beauty of the world and you can hold them in your hands and just be present with that and not have to even understand it,” he says.\n\nYou can learn more about Sean here:\n\nhttps://www.seanmcconnell.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sean_mcconnell/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/officialseanmcconnell/\n\nSonia Leigh\n\nSonia Leigh’s musical style cannot be put in a box, from Hip-Hop to Country to Pop and Rock and Roll. Her Southern Ground debut album, 1978 December, was where Leigh made her country catapult. The first single off the album “My Name Is Money,” hit Top 40 on US Country Radio. She also co-wrote the Zac Brown Band #1 singles “Goodbye in Her Eyes” and “Sweet Annie”. Leigh currently canopies several projects to umbrella her different styles, such as hip hop/rock duo TYGR TYGR AKA ELYVN: ELYVN with Daphne Willis (Position Music). Other projects include low-fi 90’s hip-hop duo Indica Girlz, and the mysterious grunge-pop project Rob The Man, all pending follow-up releases in 2023. Leigh has toured the world with the likes of the Zac Brown Band, Blackberry Smoke, Amos Lee, Melissa Etheridge, Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Joan Jett, and many more. Amongst all of this, Sonia Leigh has been writing and working in the studio on her next solo record. Her hard-hitting single “Thin Ice,” released in 2023, is fueled with pure rock and roll energy that calls for burning down the barriers around one’s self to realize their full potential and made Apple Music’s New In Rock and Women Who Rock new music playlists. In the top of 2024, her release in February “Beautiful Mess” featuring Rob The Man continues to showcase her rock pop side produced by Nick Furlong and Colin Brittain with a cameo on guitar highlighting guitar player Carmen Vandenberg from the rock duo Bones UK.\n\nGearing up for her full-length record release in August 2024 this artist will keep you on your toes stylistically but seems to return slightly to her Americana roots this time and ties it all together with a common thread which is all her own uniqueness.\n\nYou can learn more about Sonia here:\n\nhttps://www.sonialeigh.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sonialeigh/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sonialeighmusic\n\nRuthie Collins\n\nRuthie Collins wears her heart on her sleeve, and pretty much always has a sparkle in her eyes. Raised on a farm in Fredonia, NY, Collins blends the vulnerable, the volatile, and the serene in her music. Her songs straddle the line between Americana, Bluegrass, and modern Country, upheld by buoyant and agile vocals reminiscent of her musical icons, Patty Griffin and Emmylou Harris. Collins’ music features some upright bass and traditional bluegrass instrumentation in a style that’s both old-fashioned and completely modern. In her own words, the timeless quality of her music is simply a manifestation of her love for timeless objects, stories, and traditions: “I am drawn to things that speak of permanence.”\n\nAt home in nature as well as in Nashville’s honky tonk bars, Collins considers the Joshua Tree National Park in California the place that holds the deepest meaning for her and her music; The first single from her new album, a song called “Joshua Tree”, was inspired by the love-story-turned-tragedy between Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons. For Collins, the song feels “like a lucky charm,” infused with the special energy of a place she’s returned to many times for inspiration, recharging, and peace. “This song means many things to me now. It’s not only a snapshot of a great love story that almost was, but it’s the idea that love is never truly gone, because love cannot die. No matter where you are in the world or in time, love always exists.”\n\nYou can learn more about Ruthie here:\n\nhttps://ruthiecollinsmusic.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ruthiecollinsmusic/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ruthiecollinsmusic\n\nWesley Dean\n\nRelocating from Australia to Nashville in early 2021, Wesley Dean, previously known down under as Wes Carr, felt his arrival in the country/Americana roots rock scene required a new signature to herald the maturation of his musical identity. So, his middle name Dean quickly became the new trademark stamping success over his first, and critically acclaimed, American-produced (but sixth in total) studio album ‘Unknown’, which was considered for a Best Americana Album Grammy nomination.\n\nEarlier last year he embarked on his most recent tour, ‘Crazy Hearts Across America’, where he and his family drove over 5000 miles from Nashville to Los Angeles in an RV via towns steeped in musical history playing shows off the beaten track, from Memphis to New Orleans, Luckenbach, Marfa, Las Vegas, and more. With a director and cameraperson in tow, the tour was recorded as part of his upcoming feature ‘Crazy Hearts: The Documentary’, premiering early 2025, where the 10 tracks from his new album ‘Music From Crazy Hearts’, recorded at Nashville’s prestigious RCA Studio A, complement the soundscape to Dean’s personal story of breaking the industry mold to carve out his name independently.\n\nYou can learn more about Wesley here:\n\nhttps://www.wesleydeanmusic.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wesleydeanmusic/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wesleydeanmusician\n\nDave Kennedy (Host)\n\nDave Kennedy is a storyteller above all else, and it’s easy to see why. His songs paint a cinematic portrait of America as his characters journey through love, heartbreak, humor, sin, redemption, revenge, and perhaps even a few of the songwriter’s own footsteps along the way. Bringing these songs to life is a voice so soaring and powerful you can’t help but be swept away into his world by the end of the first chorus. He navigates his way through each story and each world with a dynamic presence of both strength and subtlety that appreciates both the peaks and the valleys, the highways and the backroads, the loves lost and lingering in his mind. It’s for all these reasons that Dave has a reputation as one of Nashville’s most respected songwriters and artists, and why artists like TRAVIS TRITT, RILEY GREEN, WHISKEY MYERS, DRAKE WHITE, LARRY FLEET, and others are eager to continue writing and performing with Dave Kennedy.\n\nYou can learn more about Dave here:\n\nhttps://www.davekennedymusic.com\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/davekennedymusic/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DaveKennedyMusic\n\nABOUT HARPER O’NEILL\n\n“Maybe it’s the wrong glass ceiling to break, but I’m telling stories about the whole human experience of being a woman.”\n\nThat’s Harper O’Neill, sharing insight into the creation of her debut project, Dark Bar Daisy. It’s a gutsy assertion. But then again, O’Neill is an artist who’s always favored her intuition over trends. The Dallas-born, Nashville-based singer-songwriter with the powerhouse voice and versatile musical chops found her way onto Music Row’s radar by trusting her gut and letting her considerable talent guide her, an increasingly rare path to success in a field crowded with hopefuls trying to recreate the sound of the moment.\n\n“I like to operate on gut instincts a lot,” O’Neill says. “I can’t always explain why I do the things that I do, but I can tell you if it feels right.”\n\nDark Bar Daisy is a bold, brassy statement from O’Neill, with an unusually singular vision for a debut project. Produced by Jake Gear (Hailey Whitters), Dark Bar Daisy is, at its heart, a country record, but one that explores and celebrates the genre’s intersection points with rock, pop, soul, and even indie music. Replete with complex, larger-than-life arrangements, Dark Bar Daisy is a striking statement from one of country music’s most exciting new voices.\n\nO’Neill grew up in Dallas, TX, where her parents ran a household brimming with music. O’Neill’s mother shared her love of rock and pop acts like the Rolling Stones and James Taylor, while her father introduced her to a bevy of women songwriters, including Carole King, Susan Tedeschi, and Bonnie Raitt. The pair’s tastes intersect when it comes to their mutual love for Texas country artists, as Hayes Carll, Robert Earl Keen, and Lyle Lovett. Both of her parents play the guitar and her sister sings choral music, while O’Neill first came to music as part of her school’s marching band, for which she played French horn and was part of the drumline.\n\n“My parents are children of the ‘60s and they love music,” O’Neill says. “Music was always on in the house. We were always going to concerts. We were always going to songwriter festivals. I was just constantly surrounded by music — and, in my opinion, good music. They loved good songwriters and storytellers. So, they were always really passionate about the art form.”\n\nHer parents bought O’Neill her first guitar, a baby Taylor signed by none other than The Chicks. In her mid-teens, she began learning to play simple chords and songs, though at the time she only considered her musical ambitions as suited to high school talent shows or bedroom singalongs.\n\n“You don’t see a way forward in music unless you know someone that’s done it,” she says. “And I didn’t know anyone that had made a career of it. So, I had no idea how. I didn’t even think it was really possible. It seemed like kind of like a pipe dream.”\n\nThough O’Neill’s family encouraged her interest in music, before pursuing a career as an artist she attended college at the University of Texas at Austin, earning a degree in communications. Upon graduation, O’Neill moved back to Dallas and took a job working in financial services, which she describes as having been “a blessing but also dreadfully boring.” She knew she needed to make a change but wasn’t sure which direction to take when she began to reflect on the weekends in Austin she’d spend performing in 6th Street bars.\n\nA brief detour for an internship in Chicago connected O’Neill, by chance, with Richard Casper, the founder of the non-profit organization CreatiVets, which helps veterans process trauma through visual art and music. O’Neill spent time working with Casper while in Chicago, and years later he called her out of the blue to suggest she move to Nashville to pursue music in earnest.\n\n“I was like, ‘What?’” she says of the phone call. “And he said, ‘Come out. Stay with my wife and I for a few days I’ll show you around town. If you hate it, I’ll leave you alone. I’ll never call you about it again.’ So, I came up here for five days in 2016, after I graduated. I was like, ‘I’ve got to move there.’”\n\nO’Neill followed her gut and moved to Nashville in 2018, a decision she remains proud of to this day. “I always call it ‘listening to the universe,’” she says of trusting her intuition. “You have to be open to that kind of stuff for it to happen. I had to take his call in order to be invited to come out. And sometimes I feel like that’s the hardest part, just letting yourself be open.”\n\nAfter putting down roots in Nashville, O’Neill began finding ways into the local music scene, trying out co-writes and finding gigs to play around town. After posting a performance video to TikTok in 2022— far from being a regular TikToker, O’Neill had only dabbled with the platform — O’Neill got a text claiming to be from Jody Williams, the renowned publishing executive and former head of BMI known for working with everyone from Maren Morris to Carrie Underwood. Williams texted O’Neill on April 1st, so she couldn’t help but think it was a prank. They arranged a meeting for the following week and Williams signed O’Neill to his Jody Williams Songs on the spot.\n\nWhile she had a stockpile of songs she’d written over the years, O’Neill didn’t feel strongly enough about the material to use it for her first project, so she started from scratch. That decision led to the gradual birth of Dark Bar Daisy. While her demos veered more closely to traditional acoustic instrumentation, O’Neill was adamant that she wanted horns on the record, which Gear made happen with the help of arranger Jordan Lehning. The addition of Lehning’s arrangements helped O’Neill fully realize the colorful, orchestral sonic vision she had for Dark Bar Daisy. “I was really excited to paint with all the brushes in the studio musically,” O’Neill says. “They’re really hip arrangements that Jordan did. We gave him tons of references, like Khraungbin, Silk Sonic, Lake Street Dive and some old soul references. That was the melting pot mix of sounds that I was that I was chasing.”\n\nDark Bar Daisy opens with “No Longer Mine,” the sole song O’Neill pulled from earlier material while making the LP. Instantly groovy thanks to a prominent, swaggering bass line, the track soon gives way to O’Neill’s dusky vocal, which lands somewhere between Ashley McBryde and Amy Winehouse. The title track is a subtle nod to Miranda Lambert’s Wildcard cut “Dark Bars,” with O’Neill’s own unique take on time spent in dives.\n\n“Guilty” finds O’Neill co-writing with Jacob Bryant and John Davidson of the Brummies, a Nashville-based band she considers to be an inspiration to her own music. After meeting at Bonnaroo a couple of years earlier, the trio got together and found kindred spirits in one another, with Bryant and Davidson creating an open, inviting atmosphere in which O’Neill could try out ideas.\n\n“A lot of people in town, if you don’t get something going in the first 30 or 45 minutes, people are like, ‘Oh, we didn’t get one today,’” O’Neill says. “And they just kind of move on. But Jacob and John, they’re just hanging out. And they’re trying to write good songs.”\n\n“When You Love Me,” which O’Neill wrote by herself, is one of the record’s most striking moments, with soulful, almost jaunty production belying the heartbreak at the track’s core. With “I’m Not Her,” O’Neill was able to team up with two renowned Music Row writers, Jim Beavers (Dierks Bentley, Chris Stapleton) and Jason Nix (Lainey Wilson, Keb’ Mo).\n\n“Somebody” will be relatable to anyone who’s nursed a crush from afar, while “You Don’t Love Me,” co-written with Melissa Fuller and Andy Skib, offers an answer to the previous track’s starry-eyed vision of idealizing romantic prospects. The album closes with the stunning “I Was Always Yours,” co-written with good friend and frequent collaborator Collin Nash, an emotional ballad told from the perspective of a woman leaving her lover.\n\n“I love hearing this perspective come from a woman,” O’Neill says. “You’re not always the one who is left. Sometimes you’re the leaver, and sometimes you’re the one who hurts.”\n\nDark Bar Daisy is an honest, clear-eyed expression of O’Neill’s remarkable artistry and a testament to trusting the process, no matter how winding the journey. O’Neill is an unapologetically fearless artist with the music to prove it.\n\nJoin us for another installment of Analog Soul featuring Will Davenport, The Smoke Show, and Boulevards!\n\nABOUT WILL DAVENPORT\n\nMore than words on a page or notes to a melody- William Davenport has had an intimate relationship with music that dates back to his childhood in Atlanta, GA.

That album culminated years of slow building and provided the Raleigh, N.C. native the breakthrough he deserved. After an 18-month, rigorous run, he wasn’t ready to take a deserved break.\n\nUpon Electric Cowboy’s release, Rashad’s creative ideas continued to flow. He reached out to friends and collaborators, like writer Gentle Nature and J.J. Whitefield of German funk group The Poets of Rhythm, and began to mold his new ideas into full-fledged songs. After the campaign for Electric Cowboy wound down, Rashad returned to his home state of North Carolina and got to work on his fifth studio album.\n\nAs the song ideas flowed, Rashad explored the importance of self-reflection and personal experiences, particularly themes of love and vulnerability. Drawing from that prism and channeling the joy of his recent engagement, the artist had plenty of positive momentum heading into the recording sessions.\n\n“After Electric Cowboy was released, I thought hard about my intentions for the next album,” shares Rashad. “The objective was to make a record that echoes the spirit of my live shows and reflects the truest ‘me.’”\n\nCarolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road is a tip of the cap to his home and will be released by the New West Records imprint Normaltown Records. At Killion Studios in Los Angeles, Rashad teamed with producer Sergio Rios (Neal Francis, Say She She, Orgone) to create an album chock full of memorable uptempo “Southern Fried Funk.” For the first time in Rashad’s career, he recorded live and straight to tape, capturing the true essence of these songs, which were brought to life by Dan Hastie (keys), Dale Jennings (bass), and Sam Halterman (drums).\n\n“Working with Sergio Rios as a producer allowed me to refine my vision while preserving the raw, infectious sound that feels most authentic to me,” Rashad adds.\n\nWith an assist from Whitefield, Rashad captured the raw, crunchy sounds he’d been hoping to incorporate into his recordings. The album also features the handy work of Mike Buckley (Daptones, Budos Band, Jalen N’gonda), who composed the horn parts, Blake Rhein (Durand Jones & The Indications), and Kendra Morris (Colemine Records). This is the album that finally captures the energy of Rashad’s high-octane live show onto wax. Black Pumas virtuoso Adrian Quesada and Will Grantham mixed Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road, giving Rashad the exact sound he sought to capture.\n\nRashad points to “What We Live For” as one of his favorite songs from the 10-song collection. In the past, he’s hidden his personal lyrics underneath the power of his groove-laden instrumentals. Not here. He admits that hearing the finished version gave him chills and he teared up a bit. At its heart, it’s what Carolina Funk is about celebrating love. As tender as “What We Live For” is, Rashad didn’t want to get too hung up on sentimentality. The song’s rhythm and melody are club-ready with its funk soul.\n\nThe same goes for “Run and Move.” Describing the fears of vulnerability in a relationship, Rashad brings an astute perspective to describing human nature. Despite it being one of his favorite songs, he admits that it was one of the toughest to track in the studio. Even so, the collection captures Rashad’s ethos as an artist and is his most well-rounded to date.\n\nLike any great artist, Rashad writes in a fashion that is true to himself, yet has the ability for his rapidly expanding fan base to relate to. With Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road, Rashad shows that he can’t stop and won’t stop channeling his creativity into funk-powered hits.\n\nABOUT JOSEPH WOOTEN\n\nJoseph Allen Wooten, aka “The Hands of Soul” a loving husband and father, keyboardist, writer, arranger, producer, educator, motivational speaker, and author, is a 3-time Grammy Award-nominated artist.
