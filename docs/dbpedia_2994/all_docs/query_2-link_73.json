Alfred Wegener was thought to be a fool because he claimed the continents were once joined together. People thought: How could solid rock move across the oceans?",

        "text": "James Hutton was considered foolish in his time because his theory of uniformitarianism, suggesting that the Earth changes slowly and continuously over time, was radically different from the prevailing belief in catastrophism. Alfred Wegener was considered foolish for proposing the theory of continental drift, as it challenged the widely accepted idea of stationary continents. Both scientists were ahead of their time, and their ideas were not widely accepted until much later."
