        "text": "Obituary\n\nTasia “Tess” Hutton, 83, of Marengo, died peacefully on May 5th, 2023 surrounded by her loving family.\n\nTasia was born March 17, 1940 in Chicago, the daughter of Theodore and Kanella Kolovos. She married Charles Hutton on October 14, 1972.\n\nTess was eighty-three years young. As the matriarch, she was the connector of all family members and was always involved in her children’s lives. She was always in “the know” and you couldn’t hide a thing from her.\n\nShe was a mother of five, and there was never a dull moment when her kids were growing up. She embraced and welcomed all their friends into her house and thrived when her home was full of chaos.\n\nTess never missed her Fox News, and loved to go shopping; she was especially fond of Bed Bath & Beyond, and will continue to grow her vacuum collection in heaven. Tess was a great dancer and had a love of all music, from Dean Martin to Adele, and even Bruno Mars and Michael Bublé. She was beautiful and had a fabulous sense of style; she was dreaming of patent leather purses throughout her last days. She was a loving mother, grandmother and great grandmother who will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nTess is survived by her children, Elizabeth Bullock, Deborah (Rick) Bowar, Victoria (Mike) Dellas, Michael Nowak and John (Dawn) Hutton, 12 grandchildren, 8 great grandchildren, her sisters, Kathryn Stanek and Frances Levy. She was preceded in death by her parents, and her husband.\n\nVisitation will be held on Friday, May 19, 2023 from 4-7pm, with a service beginning at 6:30pm at DeFiore Funeral Home-10763 Dundee Road, Huntley.
