Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nJames Hutton, often referred to as the “father of modern geology” was born in Scotland in 1726. Along with his work in geology, Hutton was also an agriculturalist and naturalist who put forward the idea of a “system of the habitable Earth.”\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the James Hutton or alternatively, you can download our 20-page James Hutton worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE OF JAMES HUTTON\n\nJames Hutton was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on June 3rd, 1726; he had four siblings.\n\nHis father died when he was only three years old.\n\nHutton took an interest in the sciences – particularly chemistry – and math while in school, and he also studied the classics.\n\nWhen he was 17, he apprenticed with a lawyer, but his interest in chemistry prevented him from getting much done!\n\nEARLY WORK AND RESEARCH OF JAMES HUTTON\n\nOnce he realized his heart lay with chemistry, he and a friend, James Davie, spent a lot of time trying to manufacture sal ammoniac from coal soot.\n\nThese experiments made Hutton realize that he needed to go back to school to study medicine, which is closely related to chemistry.\n\nJames continued his studies of medicine at the University of Edinburgh, then the University of Paris, and eventually earned his Ph.D with a thesis on blood circulation in Holland in 1749.\n\nCHEMICALS MANUFACTURING\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Hutton returned to Edinburgh to work with his close friend James Davie on chemical experiments.\n\nTheir work resulted in a profitable partnership in producing sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) from soot.\n\nThis led to the manufacturing of crystalline salt which was used for dyeing, metalworking, and as smelling salts.\n\nPrior to their experiments, these were only available as imports from Egypt.\n\nHis father’s farms in Slighhouses were endowed to him, and in the early 1750s he moved there to make improvements and experiment with animal and plant husbandry; he wrote his ideas down in\n\nwhat would become an unpublished treatise on The Elements of Agriculture.\n\nWhile working on his father’s farms, he became more and more fascinated with the composition of the Earth, its surface, and the matter that makes up rocks, soil, and minerals.\n\nHUTTON’S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE\n\nHutton let his farms to tenants in the 1760s, but still remained interested in farm improvements and scientific reading.\n\nHe traveled widely across the U.K. to study rocks and observe the actions of natural processes.\n\nWhile on his travels, he kept a catalogue of the rocks he found around the coasts, islands, and mountains of Scotland.\n\nIn addition, he also visited England and Wales.\n\nHis geological knowledge came in handy when he became involved with the construction of the Forth and Clyde canal which crosses over Central Scotland.\n\nHutton continued to investigate geologic phenomena, rocks, strata, and fossils, but his ideas continued to clash with the still-accepted belief that the Earth had been created only 6,000 years ago, according to the Bible.\n\nHe maintained the idea, from years of observation and research, that many rocks had been formed by sedimentary processes (such as erosion, compaction, and deposition, among others).\n\nHe also asserted that new land surfaces were formed by volcanism and other heat processes.\n\nHutton believed that all of these geological processes could fully explain the landforms seen all over the world (without the need for explanations from the Bible) and that these processes have been ongoing for centuries.\n\nHUTTON’S DEATH AND LEGACY\n\nHutton published these findings in his book Theory of the Earth after 25 years of work and research.\n\nHe presented his book on March 4th and April 7th of 1785 at the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nHe continued to study rocks and rock formations with fellow scientist and naturalist, John Playfair, all around the U.K.\n\nHutton received criticism upon the publishing of Theory of the Earth in 1788, for being atheistic and not logical.\n\nHe also contributed his ideas to meteorology by discussing the properties of moisture in relation to condensation and climate,\n\nas well as his suggestion that biological and geological processes are interlinked.\n\nHutton also advocated a form of evolution, suggesting that if an organized body is not in a situation that it is best adapted for, it will either depart for better conditions, or it will die, years before Charles Darwin’s famous “Theory of Evolution” was ever conceived.\n\nJames Hutton died in Edinburgh on March 26, 1797 at the age of\n\n70 as a result of complications from stones in his bladder.\n\nHe is buried in Edinburgh’s Greyfriars Churchyard.\n\nJames Hutton Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the James Hutton across 20 in-depth pages.
