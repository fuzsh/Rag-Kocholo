        "text": "Johannes Duns Scotus (c1265-1308) is believed to have studied and entered the Franciscan Order at Grey Friars Monastery, Newcastle, c1280 [1]; [2].\n\nCharles Hutton (1737-1823) was born in Percy Street, Newcastle. He began teaching in the neighbouring village of Jesmond (now the northern part of the city) in 1755, soon becoming the master of the school. He returned to Newcastle and set up a school there in 1760 at the head of the Flesh Market. In c1770, he was occupying the school-house at the foot of Westgate Street. As a consequence of a flood washing away the bridge on 17 Nov 1771, he wrote a Treatise on the Principles of Bridges. He made the first accurate map of the city [3] - but [4] says the map was drawn by Hutton's pupil John Fryer. Hutton left for London in 1773 and never returned. There is a bust and a portrait of Hutton in the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society [5]; [6]. [7]\n\nSee THIS LINK\n\nThe Literary and Philosophical Society was founded in 1793 - it was the second such society outside London, after Manchester. It has an 1822-1825 building in Westgate Road at the corner of Collingwood Street. Hutton was an early Honorary Member, along with Joseph Priestley, Matthew Boulton and Sir Joseph Banks. The Society has a bust and a portrait of Hutton. It has a considerable library in a fine room and this is open to visitors.\n\nThere is (was?) a Museum of Science and Engineering in Exhibition Park, part of the Town Moor, off the Great North Road [2].\n\nWilliam Herschel was codirector of a concert here in 1761 [8].\n\nTrinity House School, Broad Chare, has little surviving except a sundial. There is a plaque on the building. Edward Riddle (1788-1854) was master in 1814-1821. [9] He later edited Hutton's translation of Ozanam for at least four editions in 1840-1854. Andrew Tinwell (1784?-1845) also taught here - he was best known as the reviser of Tinwell's Arithmetic, by his father William Tinwell ( -1808) [10].\n\nWilliam Garnett (1850-1932) was the first Principal of Durham College of Science, which became the University, from 1884 to 1893 [11].\n\nLewis Fry Richardson (1881-1953) was born in Newcastle and attended Newcastle Preparatory School until 1893. He attended the now University in 1898-1900, then went to Cambridge.\n\nThe Institute of Physics has erected a plaque to Charles Parsons, the inventor of the steam turbine.\n\nSee THIS LINK\n\nThe telescope firm of Grubb Parsons was here, but made its last mirror for the William Herschel Telescope on Las Palmas in 1987 [12].\n\nIn Apr 1943 - Feb 1944, Ludwig Wittgenstein worked at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, assisting Basil Reeve in trauma research. He stayed in a nursing students' hostel, or at Mrs Moffat's house, 28 Brandling Park (possibly the same place??) [13]. In 1997, a commemorative plaque was erected at the hospital. [14]\n\nSee THIS LINK\n\nPeter John Wallis (1918-1992) taught at King's College, later the University of Newcastle, from c1962. He, assisted by his wife Ruth, established the first substantial bio-bibliographical database for the history of British mathematics and amassed a substantial collection of early British mathematical books which have now been transferred to the University library.\n\nIn St Nicholas churchyard, Gosforth, on the northern outskirts of Newcastle, is buried John Ramsay (1708?-1783), a local schoolteacher and mathematics master whose gravestone includes\n\nTo Mathematicks he inclined,\n\nHis Mind was always gay\n\nAn Husband good & Parent kind\n\nWas honest John Ramsay\n\n[15]."
