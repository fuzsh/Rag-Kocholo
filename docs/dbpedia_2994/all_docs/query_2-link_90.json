        "text": "Here is a copy of the Hutton Family Bible for those Hutton's who may connect with this line of Hutton's. Merry Christmas:Hutton Family Bible 23 Dec 04\n\nOther surnames mentioned: Armstrong, Blincoe, Broders, Chamberlin, Clough, Ferneyhough, Garner, Halley, Hooe, Hutchinson, Kent, Little, Nevitt, Overend, Polkinghorn, Ragan, Reid, Rushfirth, Smith, Terrett, Wagner, Walker, Yost.\n\n[The following data on the Hutton Family of England, Virginia, Missouri & other places is copied from the Hutton Family Bible on file at the Virginia State Library. It appears that Isaac Garner Hutton (1790-1858) began making the family data entries and after his death other family members continued them. According to Miss Elizabeth Kulp Hutton in a 1984 telephone conversation, her father Isaac Henry Hutton feared a house fire might destroy the valuable family information and he placed it on file at the Virginia State Library in Richmond, Virginia. I obtained a photo copy of the 15 family data pages in 1984 and I have copied this information below.]\n\n1. The Bible’s Title Page: “The Newe Testament of our Lord Jesus—Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, dwelling in Powles Churchyard at the signe of the Tigers Head, 1576.” Handwritten entries as follows: Top of page:\n\n“I. Hutton’s Book”. Bottom of page: “Joan Hutton was mayrtred 1556 for not believing the Doctrine of Transubstantiation.” (Note: There is no further information in the book on this Joan Hutton. Webster’s says that transubstantiation is a belief from the Catholic religion that the bread & wine served at Church Communion is the actual (not figurative) body & blood of Christ. In English History of 1500’s or so there were persecutions for and against Catholics and apparently this records one of those.)\n\n2. “Family Records.
