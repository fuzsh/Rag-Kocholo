It would have been easy to cross this land to see Mary Hutton in Moorside, and very likely Charles and Maria Hutton as well. Thomas named his daughters 'Hannah Maria' and 'Mary Anne'. Compare with Charles's family.

Is this still the main Hutton family home which was to become \"The Smiling Mule\". Or have they moved further along in Moorside, in which case Hutton's Yard at 100 Moorside is \"The Smiling Mule\". Sarah named her second son \"Thomas Hutton Womersley\". 191 Pottery Joseph HUTTON Head Age 31 Brickmaker Bradford Works Mary HUTTON Wife 21 Eccleshill 221 Stone Hall Charles HUTTON Head Age 26 Woolstapler Eccleshill Ann HUTTON Wife 29 Eccleshill William H.

Therefore she is also the niece of Charles Hutton who migrated to Melbourne. Furthermore David Wilson may have inherited Union Mills according to letter from an aunt - \" I believe Union Mills Eccleshill are or were in the old part at the top of Moorside Rd., & as far as I remember the Mill which now the \"Museum\" belonged to a family called Wilson who went bankrupt in the early 20's, & was then bought by a firm called Whitehead** who are still going in another area of Bradford.\" **My Aunt may have meant 'Whiteleys' who ran a another Mill called 'Stone Hall Mill'.

There is something strange here, as William appears to have handed over control to John, younger brother of Thomas who is living elsewhere. Refer to notes above Land Memorial WE31 39 dated June 2nd, 1860. A later land memorial of 1864 seems to indicate that Thomas has taken over the property in conjunction with his father William, and John is then denied rights of access to the Well. Yet the 1871 census shows that John is still the Head of the house with his father living with him.
