        "text": "National Geographic magazine, a leading authority in the travel sector around the world, is re-launching the reputation of the province of Cadiz as a travel destination, emphasising all the strengths of its brand. A few days ago we published a list of the best castles in the province: 11 hilltop and coastal fortifications that run through Cadiz from north to south, some of the great vestiges of its chequered history, especially from medieval times and the Reconquest.\n\nNow National Geographic has now fixed its sights on another beautiful town in Cadiz and recommends it for a visit this summer. It is not an undiscovered territory for tourism. It is Vejer de la Frontera, a municipality in the region of La Janda. Its first, highly peculiar feature is that it is located on top of a hill and resembles a white village in the Sierra de Cadiz, but it has a beach. And what a beach! El Palmar is a first class surfing destination.\n\nVejer de la Frontera is already on the list as one of the 100 most beautiful locations in Spain. Its legacy from invasion and occupation embellishes its whitewashed streets and gives it an air of mystery, like the 'cobijada', the traditional woman from Vejer who covers her face with a veil.\n\nDeclared an Historic-Artistic Site in 1976 , Vejer's monuments include the fortified walls with their arches and impressive, panoramic views, the church and the medieval castle (11th century), only a small part of which can be visited. The Plaza de España, a place of enjoyment and recreation for the locals, is a symbol of the town and the ideal frame for many a holiday snap.\n\nThe magazine's article mentions its similarities to Chefchaouen. As legend has it, that Moroccan town was made in the image of Vejer de la Frontera by the emir Sidi Ali Ben Rachid."
