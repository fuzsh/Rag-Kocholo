        "text": "You may know the name C√°diz as belonging to the ancient city-port of C√°diz but did you know that it‚Äôs also the name of the southernmost province in the autonomous region of Andalusia? In this article we‚Äôre going to consider what to see in C√°diz Province, the very best places to go and the best things to do.\n\nWhy should you explore C√°diz Province\n\nWhen people think of Spain, it‚Äôs images of Andaluc√≠a that come to mind. And when they think of Andaluc√≠a, it‚Äôs often the province of C√°diz they‚Äôre imagining.\n\nC√°diz has a little bit of everything. You‚Äôll find\n\nüèñ Sparkling beaches along the incredible Costa de la Luz\n\nüè∞ Gorgeous pueblos blancos (the white towns) and castles\n\nüíÉüèª Flamenco dancers\n\nüå≥ National parks, olive trees, cork trees and more\n\nüç∑ Sherry\n\nIf you‚Äôre coming to Andaluc√≠a and really want to get to know the region, you can‚Äôt miss out on C√°diz province. If you‚Äôre considering a side-trip to C√°diz from Madrid (or a trip to Madrid from C√°diz), I highly recommend that too.\n\nThere may be affiliate links in the article. If you click and make a purchase then I may, at no extra cost to you, make a small sum. Thank you!\n\nHow to explore C√°diz\n\n‚Äã‚úàÔ∏è The nearest airports to C√°diz are outside Seville, Malaga, Gibraltar and Faro (Portugal)\n\nWhat to do in C√°diz Province\n\nC√°diz ‚Äì the city\n\nC√°diz city claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in Europe having been founded by the Phoenicians in around 1100 BCE. The city is almost entirely surrounded by water, in fact, driving over the bridge into C√°diz is part of the fun. The city is on a spit of land that juts out into the Bay of C√°diz.\n\nWhat to do in C√°diz\n\nThere is so much to do in C√°diz that you absolutely can‚Äôt see it all in a day (I know because we tried) unlike the gorgeous small city of Segovia that is doable in a day.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Enjoy wandering aimlessly and getting yourself lost in the small and winding streets of C√°diz‚Äôs old town.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Teatro Romano (Roman Theatre) ‚Äì this first-century BCE theatre is partially visible from the street and the entrance is just off the cathedral square. If you wish to visit the museum with it I believe you need to book online but the partially excavated theatre can be visited without reservation.\n\nIf you love Roman cities, then don‚Äôt forget to add the Roman city of M√©rida to your list of Spanish must-see destinations.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Walk the Campo del Sur (the malec√≥n) ‚Äì this walkway follows the curve of the coast. It isn‚Äôt a beach walk, rather you look down over the water from this curved and gorgeous pathway. Apparently it was this part of C√°diz that inspired the layout of Havana.\n\nIt‚Äôs also reminiscent of the Paseo de Espa√±a in Malaga. If you‚Äôre going to be in Malaga, by the way, you can‚Äôt miss the astoundingly gorgeous mountain pueblo blanco of Mijas.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Playa de la Caleta ‚Äì this is a small beach in the old fisherman‚Äôs quarter of La Vi√±a. The beach is flanked by forts on either side. It is a popular beach that is well worth a look even if you don‚Äôt have any plans to sunbathe. In English you‚Äôll see it referred to as La Caleta Beach. La Vi√±a is a fun area to explore and here you‚Äôll find some of C√°diz‚Äôs best tapas bars.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Castillo de San Sebastian ‚Äì once you‚Äôve checked out the beach, be sure to walk the 400-metre bridge to the island-castle out at sea. While you can‚Äôt actually enter the castle, the walk itself is a lot of fun.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Castillo de Santa Catalina ‚Äì one of the two forts flanking the city beach, this fort was built in the 1600s. Today it‚Äôs free to enter and look around. When we visited it had a good photography exhibition too\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Parque Genov√©s ‚Äì walk either through this small park (there‚Äôs a small playground at one end) or walk alongside it like we did to take in more gorgeous coastal views and to let the kids ignore the park but go wild in the skate park\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Torre Tavira ‚Äì this is C√°diz‚Äôs camera obscura. It‚Äôs just a ten-minute climb to the top (despite being the city‚Äôs highest point). From the top, there is a gorgeous panoramic view of C√°diz. Note that you must reserve your admission time online.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Baluarte de la Candelaria ‚Äì we couldn‚Äôt go inside this 17th-century fort but we fell in love with the gardens (Jardines Clara Campoamor) just outside it. This was our first introduction to the astounding giant rubber trees of C√°diz. If you didn‚Äôt know about them, now you do! C√°diz is famous for its enormous rubber trees. There are some here and some just outside the university in front of the beach (playa de la Caleta).\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Yaciemento Arqueologico Gad√≠r ‚Äì this free archaeological museum is home to the ruins of a Phonecian settlement. The visit begins with a short video and then you‚Äôre given time to walk around the 3000-year-old ruins of the city of Gad√≠r and exclaim (because you will) over everything including the animal and even human remains (from a young man who was killed by fire in the seventh century BCE)\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Museo de C√°diz ‚Äì this museum is full of local artefacts and art.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è There are a myriad of excellent reasons to visit Spain, and C√°diz is just one of them.\n\n‚ÄãJerez de la Frontera\n\nPhoto taken by Lynnette of The Joy of Cakes fame ‚Äì book her for a Seville birthday cake now!\n\nThe second major city in the province of C√°diz, Jerez is famous for its sherry (jerez is the Spanish for ‚Äòsherry‚Äô), flamenco music and the school of equestrian arts.\n\nWhat to see in Jerez\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Alc√°zar ‚Äì a Moorish fortress from the 11th century\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Try sherry at a sherry bodega. Sherry can only be made in what is known as the ‚Äòsherry triangle‚Äô ‚Äì which runs between Jerez de la Frontera, Puerto de Santa Maria and San Lucas de Barrameda.\n\nI‚Äôm not a huge fan of sherry but the main bodegas to visit include Tio Pepe, Luis P√©rez and Sandeman (and yes, you can also find them in Porto with their port) ‚Üí Check the tasting options here.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Explore the old town of Jerez, enjoy a meal in a tapas bar as you wander around the narrow streets.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Visit the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Arts, one of the 4 most prestigious riding academies in the world. Here you can watch the riders training every day. Don‚Äôt miss the Museum of Equestrian Art while you‚Äôre there.\n\n‚ûï Gibraltar ‚Äì one of my absolute favourite day trips from Seville is a trip to Gibraltar, that small anomaly sitting just at the edge of C√°diz Province.\n\nIt‚Äôs an absolute must for anyone interested in history and pre-history. Did you know that the Neanderthals survived for thousands of years longer here than anywhere else in Europe.\n\nC√°diz Beaches\n\nC√°diz‚Äôs coastline is part of Spain‚Äôs gorgeous Costa de la Luz that runs all the way from Huelva Province‚Äôs border with Portugal in the west to Tarifa in the east. These beautiful beaches sit on the Atlantic Ocean. Some are wild and empty and others are flanked by chiringuitos (beach bars) and beach towns.\n\nSome of Andaluc√≠a‚Äôs most fabulous beaches are found in C√°diz Province and my personal opinion is that these beaches are more beautiful than those along the more famous and more visited by international tourists, Costa del Sol.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è The Cadiz beaches are perfect if you‚Äôre looking for an easy beach day from Seville.\n\nTarifa\n\nThe location of this small town can not be beaten. It stands at the confluence of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and is the southernmost point in mainland Europe, just 14km from the north African coast. Imagine standing between two oceans and two continents at the same time ‚Äì what a rush!\n\nWhat to do in Tarifa\n\nWhile the bulk of activities in and around Tarifa are beach based, that isn‚Äôt all this gorgeous little town offers its visitors.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Explore Tarifa‚Äôs Old Town ‚Äì as you wander around the narrow streets of the old town, visit the Castillo de Guzman el Bueno, a tenth century fortress that is one of the best preserved defensive enclosures in all of Spain.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Visit Baelo Claudia and Playa de Bolonia ‚Äì just 20 minutes from Tarifa is this double whammy of one of Spain‚Äôs best preserved Roman ruins and one of the most gorgeous beaches you can imagine. Do not miss this incredible pairing.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Take a tour of Isla de Tarifa ‚Äì only bookable through the tourist information centre. The interpretation centre on the island is incredibly informative and the views of the African coast from here are unbeatable.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Take a boat trip / dolphin and whale spotting tour ‚Äì since these incredible animals live in the Strait of Gibraltar all year round you‚Äôre practically guaranteed to see some.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Take a day trip to Morocco ‚Äì yup, really, Tarifa and Tangier are so close that you can even visit for lunch (if you love tagine enough that can be bothered with passport control of course). Take a ferry and wander on your own or take one of the many excellent official tours on offer from Tarifa.\n\n‚ÄãPlaya de Bolonia\n\nIf you love archaeological sites and beaches then Bolonia will knock your socks off.\n\nThis beach is home to not to not only the ruined town of Baelo Claudia (one of the best Roman ruins in all of Spain but also one of the biggest sand dunes you‚Äôll see in Spain with the absolute best views across to Africa. The dune is over 30 m high and 200 m wide and you can climb all the way to the top it to gaze out over the Estrecho Nature Park and the incredible views it offers.\n\nThere are chiringuitos along the beach and one end (near the dune) is a nudist area of beach.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Read more about Playa de Bolonia\n\nLos Ca√±os de Meca\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for gorgeous beaches in C√°diz province, you can‚Äôt do much better than this area. The main beaches here are Playa Faro de Trafalgar, Playa los Ca√±os de Meca and Playa el Pirata.\n\nTrafalgar, of course, is where the famous Battle of Trafalgar took place. Although there‚Äôs not much to see there, the Trafalgar Lighthouse (Faro de Trafalgar) stands proudly on the cliff. You can walk to its base but it‚Äôs fenced off and not for climbing.\n\nPlaya de Trafalgar is a wonderful stretch of beach favoured by surfers and next door (accessible from the same carpark between the two) is Los Ca√±os de Meca where you‚Äôll find plenty of kite surfers and windsurfers.\n\nCa√±os de Meca pueblo has decent hotels, campsites and some excellent restaurants including Restaurante el Pirata, which has fabulous views over the beach and incredible fresh fish plates.\n\nPueblos Blancos in C√°diz\n\nThe Province of C√°diz and the Province of Malaga are home to the Pueblos Blancos, or White Towns, that people so love to visit. There are 19 Pueblos Blancos in C√°diz alone but the following are the most beautiful and most visited:\n\nSetenil de las Bodegas\n\nThis small mountain town is famous for being home to whitewashed houses and to home built into the cliffs along the R√≠o Trejo. It has become a popular tourist destination despite its inland location.\n\nThe town extends along the course of the Rio Trejo with some houses being built into the rock walls of the gorge itself, created by enlarging natural caves or overhangs and adding an external wall. It is thought that the town‚Äôs name comes from the Latin phrase ‚Äúseptem nihil‚Äù, seven times nothing, which refers to the Moorish town‚Äôs resistance and the seven sieges apparently carried out by the Christians to get it back.\n\nWhat to do in Setenil de las Bodegas\n\n‚û°Ô∏è This is one of those tiny towns where you can pretty much see everything just by wandering around without too much of a plan. People do stay in Setenil de las Bodegas though, for the thrill of staying in a cave home.\n\nNote: there is free parking all along the sides of the road as you drive into Setenil de las Bodegas BUT I don‚Äôt recommend relying on this as it goes fast and actually the municipal carpark is better located down at the bottom of the valley.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Calle Cuevas del Sol and Calle Cuevas de la Sombre ‚Äì these two streets offer up the most famous and recognisable shots from Setenil de las Bodegas. On either side of the R√≠o Trejo these two streets are lined with restaurants, bars and shops built into the rocky walls. Calle Cuevas de la Sombre (Shadow) runs right through the rock at one point.\n\nIt was hard to move through the streets at some moments due to the large numbers of tourists milling around also wanting to get great shots.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Mirador del Carmen ‚Äì Setenil city letters are here and there‚Äôs a small playground up here too.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è B√©same en este Rincon ‚Äì (kiss me in this corner). This is a cute bench presumably erected for Instagram. I didn‚Äôt kiss anyone here (sob, poor me) but we did go into the tiny cafe just behind and enjoy a drink and a snack on the cliff-house balcony. That felt pretty special.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Calle Herrer√≠a ‚Äì here we found one enterprising old man who was letting people into his house for one Euro each. There wasn‚Äôt much to see that was any different from any other home apart from its tiny size and rocky walls but his lunch smelled good! Of course, we couldn‚Äôt turn up the opportunity to see inside a teeny rock-cave house.\n\nZahara de la Sierra\n\nZahara de la Sierra is a small mountain town located between Seville and Ronda. Originally a Moorish outpost, today it is known for being one of the most beautiful of the pueblos blancos. On the top of the craggy outcrop, there is a fascinating castle that was built as a fortress in case of attack. The town played an important part in the history of the region since its recapture by the Emirate of Granada in 1481 (after losing it in 1407) was the catalyst for Castile‚Äôs war against Granada. Zahara de la Sierra was captured by Castilian troops in 1483.\n\nToday it‚Äôs a cute small town on the ‚ÄúPueblos Blancos‚Äù route (White Towns route). A stroll through the streets is an utter delight but obviously, since it‚Äôs on a small mountain, there are a lot of steps and steep paths to take in.\n\nWhat to do in Zahara de la Sierra\n\nThis small town doesn‚Äôt need more than a day but again, it‚Äôs perfectly delightful to stay for longer should you wish to do so. I checked it out with a friend after completing a pretty arduous hike in the nearby Garganta Verde. We decided that after exhausting ourselves with steep climbs there, the only wise thing was to head into Zahara de la Sierra to climb up to the castle.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Castle and Medieval town ruins ‚Äì Tickets for the medieval town and castle are bought together from the kiosk at the entry to the site. Remember that the castle is perched atop a small mountainy-hill so it‚Äôs a good 10-15 minutes walk UP to reach the castle. The walk around the castle is gorgeous and the castle itself is pretty interesting.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Walks in Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park ‚Äì an area of utter natural beauty. The mountains can be seen from Zahara de la Sierra and quite frankly, if you‚Äôre like me, they‚Äôll call to you.\n\nIf you can‚Äôt get this far out of Seville then perhaps somewhere closer like Alcal√° de Guada√≠ra with its gorgeous parks would work for you.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Garganta Verde ‚Äì this is a huge nearby canyon offering a fairly arduous yet gorgeous trek (permissions required before walking here). Be sure to look up regularly and admire the griffon vulture colony that lives here. Nearby (ish) Monfrag√ºe National Park is home to some of the best vulture and eagle colonies in Spain.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Pinsapar Route ‚Äì a gorgeous walk through a pine forest\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Wander around the town ‚Äì check out the Santa Mar√≠a de la Mesa Church, San Juan de Letr√°n Chapel, Torre del Reloj, Palominos Bridge.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Visit the miradors (viewpoints) ‚Äì looking over the Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Artificial beach and water sports ‚Äì During the summer, the Arroyomolinos Recreation Area offers a ‚Äòbeach experience‚Äô where people swim and enjoy the other water sports on offer.\n\nArcos de la Frontera\n\nArcos de la Frontera, one of the Pueblos Blancos, is considered one of Spain‚Äôs most beautiful towns so I simply had to check it out. It‚Äôs an easy day trip from Sevilla, C√°diz or Ronda. This small town sits on top of a pe√±a (monolith ‚Äì if you‚Äôve followed my blog for a while you‚Äôll know that visiting La Pe√±a de Bernal in Mexico was one of the highlights of my existence so when I realised Arcos de la Frontera was also built on a pe√±a I was pretty excited).\n\nThe town‚Äôs name refers to the fact that it was a frontier town during the Moorish period of Spanish history. It is famous for its ten church bells, which tolled then and remain in situ now. We didn‚Äôt know about the bells when we visited but we absolutely noticed them as we wandered around.\n\nWhat to do in Arcos de la Frontera\n\nNote: I highly recommend parking in the municipal carpark at Plaza Andaluci√° and walking the fifteen minutes into the old centre of town. The roads get horribly narrow and there aren‚Äôt many parking options. The plaza is technically available for parking but even when we went on a cold Tuesday morning in November it was full.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Churches ‚Äì there are many churches to check out should you wish to do so. We didn‚Äôt. We exclaimed from outside but didn‚Äôt go in. Perhaps we should have but time was limited and neither of us is particularly excited by them.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Castle ‚Äì you can see the castle in town but you can‚Äôt visit it as it‚Äôs privately owned. Why don‚Äôt I get to live in a castle?\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Parador de Arcos de la Frontera ‚Äì this hotel offers incredible views of the surrounding area. We had a drink on the terrace, marvelling at the silence and watching the birds murmurate for us.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Birth place of the poet Julio Mariscal ‚Äì on whose facade can be seen a commemorative tile. I hadn‚Äôt heard of this guy but his poetry and sayings can be found around town. We enjoyed stopping to read them.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Jard√≠n Andalus√≠ ‚Äì a peaceful garden designed to represent the mix of Spanish and Moorish influence on the area. It was closed when we were there but looked very pretty.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Miradors ‚Äì the two primary ones are Plaza de Cabildo (next to the Parador, see above), and Mirador de Abades. Plaza de Cabildo stands next to the castle and is home to the Basilica Menor de Santa Maria de la Asunc√≠on, an enormous church with an imposing bell tower.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Convento de las Mercedarias Descalzas ‚Äì established in 1642, this is the only remaining cloistered convent in Arcos de la Frontera. The nuns here make candies that you can buy directly from them or in some of the shops around town. We were just reading the poster on the door and figuring out what we might want when the convent door slammed shut in our faces. A little reminder that we really don‚Äôt need candy perhaps!\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Look UP, see the guardacantones ‚Äì kinds of buttresses or reinforcements of the corners of old buildings ‚Äì very cool to see. The most famous and astounding is Callej√≥n de las Monjas where the buttresses were built in 1699 to prevent the walls of the church from buckling under the weight of its vaults. I read that cars can fit through this teeny tiny space and that locals love to watch visitors nervously drive through. We didn‚Äôt try it.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Ventanas con orejeras ‚Äì (windows with earmuffs) ‚Äì tiny holes in the walls of houses so people could see what was going on outside without being seen. We didn‚Äôt find any, which made me sad as I really want to know what they look like and how they differ from, um, windows.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è The Tourist Office is also home to an interpretation centre for the city.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Monumento a la Semana Santa ‚Äì erected in 2008 this is a monument to Easter week\n\n‚û°Ô∏è El Circulo Magico ‚Äì a magic circle on the floor. We didn‚Äôt find it.\n\nOlvera\n\nIt is thought that Olvera has been inhabited since the Celts lived in this region of Spain. Certainly, the town existed when Romans and Visigoths were present (for more Roman and Visigoth history in the area check out M√©rida). The town‚Äôs castle even appears to have some Roman foundations. In the 12th century, Olvera is mentioned in Muslim records as an outpost taken by King Alfonso XI from the Muslims. The town was named Olivera in 1327 as a nod to the sea of olive trees surrounding the town (they‚Äôre still there, by the way. (The ‚Äòi‚Äô was lost and the town became Olvera)\n\nOlvera was an accidental stop for us. We were driving home from Ronda and suddenly there was this amazing castle on the horizon. We‚Äôd just promised the kids we were going home and that they could relax when we got back so they weren‚Äôt super excited when we changed our plans and detoured over to answer the clarion call of this sexy, sexy castle.\n\nWhat to do in Olvera\n\nThe pueblo blanco of Olvera is tiny but it was declared a ‚Äúprotected area of artistic and historical importance‚Äù in 1983 and although there isn‚Äôt officially much to do there it has an undeniable charm and pull to it.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Parroquia de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Encarnaci√≥n ‚Äì this enormous church (the Parish of Our Lady of the Incarnation), stands next to the beautiful 12th-century Muslim castle atop a mountain with the small town spread out below.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Castle ‚Äì To visit the castle you need to climb up the steps to the right of the church and head into the tourist information/museum directly in front of you. Once you‚Äôve marvelled over the spectacular views and checked out the small but interesting museum you‚Äôll be led across the square and sent through a nondescript door that leads to the base of the castle.\n\nThe panoramic views from the castle will stay with you for a very long time, so dramatic and beautiful is the scenery. Without a doubt, this castle is one of my favourite castles in C√°diz Province, maybe even Andaluc√≠a or Spain.\n\nAnother city in southern Spain with an incredible castle-church-combo is Aracena in Huelva Province. Aracena has so much to see and do and it is perfectly possible to visit on the same trip as visiting C√°diz Province.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Olvera Letters ‚Äì between the castle and the church are the Olvera letters should you wish a photo with them.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Cemetery ‚Äì Look down from the castle and you‚Äôll see a small cemetery that you can, if you have time, explore.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Plaza de Andaluc√≠a ‚Äì the main square looks like a lovely place to spend a few lazy hours. When we were there, over siesta on a Sunday, nothing was open so we carried on home.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Pe√±on del Sagrado Corazon ‚Äì I am sad to have missed this extra climb but I suspect my kids are very grateful we didn‚Äôt head up this rock for extra views of the castle, church and town.\n\nVejer de la Frontera\n\nAnother gorgeous pueblo blanco sitting atop a hill overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar and the mountains.\n\nWhat to see in Vejer de la Frontera\n\nI haven‚Äôt yet visited but I‚Äôve done my research ready for an upcoming trip.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Old City defensive walls\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Castle (9th century) perched overlooking the town\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Plaza de Espa√±a and its gorgeous tiled fountain\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Museo de las Tradiciones y Costumbres de Vejer\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Mirador la Cobijada ‚Äì la Cobijada is a statue of a woman in typical dress\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Visit the patios in the Jewish Quarter\n\nNational parks & nature in C√°diz\n\nThere are 6 national parks in C√°diz, the 3 primary ones are:\n\nDo√±ana National Park\n\n‚û°Ô∏è While it‚Äôs not possible to stroll into the Do√±ana National Park (which straddles the provinces of Huelva and C√°diz), it is possible, from Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, to cross the River Guadalquivir and enter the ‚ÄúEtorno de Do√±ana‚Äù ‚Äì the nature park that protects the National Park.\n\nIt is also possible to take a tour into the national park from here although most tours you find online leave from Seville and head into the park via Huelva Province.\n\nParque Natural los Alconocales\n\nKnown as ‚Äúthe jungle of the Iberian Peninsula‚Äù, this natural park reaches to the C√°diz coast and even offers views over to Africa. It‚Äôs possible to go walking, kayaking, see archaeological remains, and even take balloon rides.\n\nThis park straddles C√°diz and Malaga Provinces. Its name means ‚ÄúCork Oak Groves‚Äù and the majority of trees here are, indeed, cork oak. In fact, it‚Äôs the most extensive cork forest in all of Spain.\n\nEstrecho Nature Park\n\nParque Natural del Estrecho runs between the two coastal towns of Tarifa and Algeciras (the northern side of the Strait of Gibraltar). It comprises mountains, coasts and ocean. It is the southernmost park in mainland Europe and includes the point where the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea meet."
