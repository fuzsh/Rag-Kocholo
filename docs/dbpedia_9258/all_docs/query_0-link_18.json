        "text": "Port of Algeciras Bay, one of the most important in Spain\n\nUndoubtedly, the Port of Algeciras Bay is the biggest attraction of this city and it stands out as one of the most important in Spain.\n\nOne of the largest in Europe, the port of Algeciras is the leading Spanish port in terms of total cargo traffic and the first in the Mediterranean, and is currently ranked 25th in container transport worldwide and number 6 in Europe.\n\nIt moves a large amount of goods due to its excellent strategic location at the intersection of the intercontinental lines linking Northern Europe, Asia and America. Likewise, it has excellent connections with the entire Peninsula, Ceuta and Tangier Med.\n\nIn recent years there has been an increase in passengers and vehicles due to the Operation Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar (OPE).\n\nEasily accessible, in addition to being used for commerce, it is also a sports, fishing and passenger bridge, which means that there is enormous activity every day.\n\nIn our opinion, it is one of the most interesting places to visit in Algeciras as it allows you to see different landscapes and take a walk through the historical port of the city.\n\nMaría Cristina Park\n\nAnother place to visit in Algeciras is the María Cristina Park, one of the most popular and beautiful places in the city, very close to the Plaza Alta, which stands out for being the social center of the city and the place where some of the most iconic buildings are located, such as the Chapel of Europa or the Church of Nuestra Señora de la Palma, among others.\n\nIt is a large park full of beautiful gardens, which also has various playgrounds for children and sports, ideal for a walk and relaxing in an unbeatable environment.\n\nRío de la Miel footpath\n\nIf you love nature and hiking, the Río de la Miel footpath is one of the places in Algeciras that you shouldn’t miss. It consists of a spectacular walk along the banks of the river Miel, which is very rich in both vegetation and cultural elements and, as you go along, you will find the ruins of irrigation channels, mills, cobblestone paths and even a medieval bridge.\n\nThis is an easy 50-minute trail, with a spectacular waterfall at the end, which will certainly have made the walk worthwhile.\n\nBahía Park\n\nTo end your trip, enjoy a day of family fun at Bahia Park, a spectacular water park for all ages, just 10 minutes drive from the center of Algeciras, ideal for fun and to cope with the high temperatures.\n\nWith all kinds of attractions, it comprises no less than 45,000 square meters, and is undoubtedly one of the main things to do while on vacation in Algeciras. And, in addition to attractions, we would like to tell you that it has the largest jacuzzi in Andalusia.\n\nHow to get to Algeciras?\n\nFRS has two ferry lines that go to Algeciras from Ceuta and Tangier Med, with different daily crossings that will allow you to enjoy all the attractions of this city of Cádiz in a comfortable, quick and easy way.\n\nYou can buy a ticket Tangier Algeciras or Ceuta Algeciras directly on our website, without leaving home."
