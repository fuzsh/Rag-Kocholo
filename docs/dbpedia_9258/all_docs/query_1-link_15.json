The most important of these was the provincial capital of Cordoba which had been taken by Tariq ibn Ziyad’s forces in 711.\n\nAbd al-Rahman I ibn Mu'awiya ibn Hisham (731-788) – a royal Umayyad prince, refused to recognize the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate and made himself the first Emir of an independent Córdoba.\n\nStatue of an imagined Abd al-Rahman I in Almuñeca, Spain.\n\nThe Caliphate of Cordoba (929-1031)\n\nBy the early 10th century, the Emirate of Cordoba had become the capital city of Islamic al-Andalus and had gained control of considerable portions of the Iberian Peninsula - of which a remote and still very unmentioned Gibraltar must have been part of.\n\nAbd al-Rahman III (Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad . . .) (889-961), replaced his original title of Emir in 929 to that of Caliph of Cordoba. The original emirate then became known as the Caliphate of Cordoba with the city of Cordoba as the capital of that part of al-Andalus under Islamic control.\n\nThe Caliphate of Cordoba at the beginning of the 10th century and of which Gibraltar was very small and anonymous part (Adapted from Wikipedia\n\nAbd al-Rahman III receiving an ambassador from Byzantine Constantinople (Late 19th century - Dionisio Baixeras)\n\nHammudid Dynasty – Caliphate of Cordoba (1016-1031)\n\nThe Hammudids were originally followers of Ali ibn Abi Talib (601-661), son-in law and cousin of the of the Prophet Muhammad. Their adoption of Berber mores and traditions over their years in North Africa, however, ensured that many would think of them as such.\n\nThe Governors of both Ceuta and Tangier were members of the Hammudid dynasty. Their possession of these important ports - and later of Algeciras and almost certainly Gibraltar- was part of the reason why this dynasty was able to control much of the commercial traffic across the Straits of Gibraltar and become a force to be reckoned with in the early years of the 11th century.\n\nThe Hammudid Dynasty – The Taifa of Malaga\n\nThe forbidding north face of the Rock as it may have looked like in the 11th century (Adapted from a 19th century photo)\n\nThe Abbadid Dynasty - The Taifa of Seville\n\nWhile still a Prince, al-Mu'tamid drove Al-Qasim II from Algeciras in c1054, claiming it for Seville and driving the Hammudids out of Iberia. For what it was worth, Gibraltar was now Sevillian.\n\nMeanwhile his father al-Mu’tadid became convinced that the forces of the Almoravid Dynasty who were advancing rapidly in North Africa were intent on crossing the Straits of Gibraltar with further conquests in mind. Gibraltar then surprisingly reappears in Islamic medieval literature for the first time since 711 when al-Mu’tadid ordered his governor in Algeciras to improve the fortifications in Gibraltar – The first time in well over 300 years that Gibraltar appears in the extant literature.\n\nThe Abbadid Taifa of Seville and other Taifas and Christian Kingdoms of 11th century Iberia – The Almoravid Empire had still not made its presence felt in Iberia. (Adapted)\n\nThe Almoravid Dynasty – (11th century)\n\nThe flag of the Almoravids\n\nA Berber dynasty.\n\nPossible depiction of Abu Bakr ibn Umar riding a camel in Central Africa (1413 – Detail of a plan by Mecia de Viladesdes)\n\nYusuf Tashfin (r1061-1106) took over as commander in 1061 is the Almoravid leader most associated with Iberia\n\nAbu Bakr ibn Zaydun was Tashfin's Visir as well as a well-known poet\n\nThe Almoravids were invited by the Taifas of al-Andalus – in particular by al-Mu’tamid of Seville. He landed his forces in Algeciras. giving Gibraltar a miss The Almoravids proved crucial in preventing the fall of al-Andalus to the Iberian Christian kingdoms. Led by Yusuf Tashfin the Muslims defeated a coalition of the Castilian and Aragonese armies at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086.\n\nBattle of Sagrajas – also known as the battle of Zalaca (História de Portugal popular e ilustrada)\n\nIn 1095, Yusuf Tashfin forced Al Mu’tamid into exile and took over in Seville. Algeciras became in effect an Almoravid city – and of course so did the as still unmentioned Rock of Gibraltar.\n\nThe Almohad Dynasty (c1120-1248)\n\nThe flag of the Almohads\n\nBetween 1146 – 1173 the Almohads took over control of the Moorish principalities of Iberia during which time Abd al Mu’min founded Madinat-al-Fath (the town of Gibraltar) in 1160 and changed the name of the Rock from Yabal Tariq to Yabal al-Fath – a change of name that never really caught on.\n\nOther Characters mentioned by medieval Islamic historians who were involved in the building of Madinat al-Fath were:\n\nThe Almohads were the dominant Islamic force in Iberia until 1212, when the fourth Almohad Caliph Muhammad III, \"al-Nasir\" (1199–1214) was defeated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212)\n\n1212 – The Battle of Navas de Tolosa (Francisco van Halen)\n\nWhen the Almohads then lost the great Muslim capital city of Seville in 1248 to the Christian King Ferdinand III of Castile, their role in the history of Iberia was over.\n\nFerdinand III of Castile (From a 14th century miniature)\n\nThe Marinid Dynasty (13th century)\n\nThe flag of the Marinids\n\nA few days after the loss of the Rock, Alfonso XI of Castile and Leon besieged it in a quick attempt to regain it. He failed when Mohammed IV of Granada came to give the Marinids a hand, and ended after all sides declared a 4-year truce. This affair is known as the 4th Siege of Gibraltar. Immediately after the end of the siege, Abu l-Hasan ordered a series of important improvements to its fortifications.\n\nAbu Inan Faris, another of Abu l-Hasan’s sons, overthrew his father in 1348 and became the 7th Emir of the Marinid Dynasty. (r1348-1358) He continued to intervene in the affairs of the Rock by ordering even further important defensive improvements. The Rock was now a Marinid town.\n\nIn 1340, Abu l-Hasan was asked by Yusuf I, the new Nasrid ruler of the Emirate of Granada, to return to al-Andalus to give him a hand in driving back Christian inroads into his territories. Abu l-Hasan, crossed over to Gibraltar with a large army and with the help of Yusuf I besieged Tarifa. The Christians counter-attacked and the result was the Battle of Rio Salado – also known as the Battle of Tarifa.\n\nThe Battle of Tarifa/Rio Salado (Unknown)\n\nThe loss of this battle proved a disaster for the Marinids and forced them to return to Morocco and give up any future ideas of conquests in al-Andalus. Gibraltar however, remained Marinid, if within the boundaries of the Emirate of Granada.\n\nAbu I-Hasan and Yusuf I on the left being told off by their Christian conquerors Alfonso XI of Castile and Afonso IV of Portugal\n\nThe Nasrid Dynasty – The Emirate of Granada (1239-1492)\n\nThe Royal Standard of the Kingdom of the Nasrids\n\nMohammad I of Granada with a red shield, leading his troops (Cantigas de Santa Maria)\n\nIt is often unclear as to the dates in which some of the Emirs of Granada held power, but it is safe to say that it was during that of Mohammad III (1302-1309) that the Rock was back in the news with a vengeance when Ferdinand IV of Castile besieged and took the place in 1309 after what later came to be known as the 1st Siege of Gibraltar.\n\nE luego, a pocos días desde que el rey don Fernando ovo cercado Algeciras envió . . . a cercar a Gibraltar. (Crónica de Fernando IV – (Written c 1340)\n\nCover of the 1554 edition of Crónica de Fernando IV - El Iqual Ganó Gibraltar (colours edited)\n\nIt was a first time that a mention of Gibraltar was made in Spanish Medieval literature.\n\nSeven years later in 1316 the Nasrids attempted to take it back.\n\nIsmail I (r1314-1325) allied the Emirate with the Azafid family in Ceuta and an expedition from across the Straits led by Yahya ibn Abi Talib, the governor of Ceuta at the time, laid siege to the Rock. They managed to enter the town and capture some of its suburbs but were eventually foiled by Christian land and naval forces. This affair is known as the 2nd Siege of Gibraltar.\n\nYusuf I (r1333-1354) was the 7th Emir of Granada. In 1339, after the 1333 Marinid success in retaking Gibraltar he asked them for help to stem the growing Christian successes against his Emirate.\n\nIn 1340, the Marinid Caliph Abu l-Hasan, (r1331-1351) complied. The result was the disastrous defeat of the joint Marinid and Nasrid forces by the Christians in the Battle of Tarifa/Rio Salado. Although the Marinids were forced to return to Morocco, they did hold on to Gibraltar.\n\nAlfonso XI of Castile tried once more to retake Gibraltar in what came to be known as the 5th Siege of Gibraltar (1349) The attempt failed after Alfonso died of the Black Death while camped in front of the North Face of the Rock.\n\nMohammad V (r1362-1391), however, regained it for Granada in 1374, when the Marinids ceded it back to him.\n\nYusuf III (r1404-1417) also managed to keep Gibraltar as part of the Emirate in 1411, after a successful 6th Siege against a rebelling Gibraltar garrison who favoured a return to Marinid control under Caliph Abu Said Uthman III (r1398-1420). This is the only one of Gibraltar’s many sieges between two Islamic forces. Gibraltar continued to be part of Emirate of Granada until 1462 when it finally passed out of Muslim control after the 8th Siege of Gibraltar and into that of the Christians.\n\nMuhammad XII (1482-1492) – known to the Christians as Boabdil - was the last Emir of what turned out to be the longest ruling Muslim Dynasty in Iberia. It lasted for more than 250 years until it was taken by the Catholic Kings in 1492 The last Muslim dynasty in Iberia had come to an end.\n\nFarewell to Granada by Boabdil (c1850s - Alfred Dehodencq)"
