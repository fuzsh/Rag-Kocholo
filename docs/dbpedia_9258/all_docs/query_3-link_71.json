        "text": "Exploring the region of Andalusia is a passion of mine so when the opportunity to join the A Una Hora de Cadiz, One Hour from Cadiz weekend I signed us (hubby and I) up. Leaving the mountainous olive growing province of Jaen, my adopted land, we set off westwards towards the first of our White Town visits - Olvera.\n\nThis White Town is one of those you can see for miles around due to it's imposing church and castle and being perched on the top of a hill.\n\nWe met the rest of the group up in Olvera's castle just as the sun was setting with romantic and dramatic views over the church and sierras beyond.\n\nIn the tourist office next to the castle there's a great little gift shop and an interesting museum about the life and history of the town.\n\nThen, above the Tourist Information Office, we had an extra virgin olive oil tasting with some fabulous, tangy early green oils.\n\nOur first stop the following day was at the Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir with views of our next White Town - Zahara de la Sierra.\n\nThis stunningly-sited little Moorish town is pretty from all sides and charming within. Climb up to the top of the castle for incredible far-reaching views of the aquamarine waters and mountain ranges behind.\n\nThen to our next white village - El Gastor. Not so dramatically situated but beautifully kept with some charming nooks and a street fuuuull of flowers where I want to live.\n\nThe little Mill Museum -Museo El Molino also had a local chap making and playing pipes from various cow or bull horns, an age-old tradition in these parts which was great to see it being passed down through to today's generation.\n\nNext to the quirkiest place on our route, a small town with a big impact - Setenil de las Bodegas. A town that was built in a gorge using the over hanging rock to build 'cave' houses beneath. It's wasn't our first visit and I'm sure it won't be the last.\n\nTorre-Alhaquime our next small, dazzling-white town is on the Via Serrana part of the Camino de Santiago.\n\nand our final town the picturesque Algondonales with one of the longest plazas I've seen which is the scene of a historical reenactment every year in April/May.\n\nAnother passion of mine are the beautiful fountains around Spain very often with ceramic picture tiles. A necessity of the past now a quaint photo shoot. How times have changed. And there ended another weekend exploring this fabulous region of Andalusia which I'm blessed to call home. Thanks to A Una Hora and all those who contributed (and attended) this weekend.\n\nRead my other One Hour From... posts:\n\nCordoba - Gastronomy, Jamon, Culture, History & the Camino Mozarabe\n\nJaen Province - Museums, Castles, Fortresses & Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nSee the Monday Morning Photo list for a few more pics in and around Andalucia.\n\nIf you´re heading to this area for walking you need ro read this post for about a walking guidebook\n\nor if you are looking for a lovely place to stay - Hotel Los Castaños\n\nSee an old post with a list of all the White Towns."
