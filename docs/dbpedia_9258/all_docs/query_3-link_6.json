        "text": "Our columnist, Sebastian Modak, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2019 list. Before Cádiz, he was enjoying the relaxing pace of Puglia, Italy’s boot heel.\n\nCádiz, the province and city on Spain’s southwestern edge, is an underdog — and I’m among the many travelers who have spent years overlooking it. I know Andalusia, the southern region it is part of, well. For years, it’s been a meeting point for my family who has just as much wanderlust as I do and is spread across the world.\n\nMy memories of Christmas are anchored by evenings spent gorging on plates of thinly sliced jamón iberíco on the Costa del Sol. We’ve done countless road trips through the pueblos blancos, or “white towns,” hidden in Andalusia’s hillsides, and visited all the sites in Granada and Córdoba. But Cádiz, on the other side of the Gibraltar headland, was always just a little too far. It took the province’s inclusion on the 52 Places list for me to realize what I’d been missing.\n\nPeople have been living in Cádiz for more than 3,000 years, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe: Traces of the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and North African Muslims, who once ruled these lands can all be found on a short walk through the old town. Today, those who are from that part of the city, say, facetiously, that they are from “Cádiz, Cádiz, Cádiz” — the original city of Cádiz, in the city of Cádiz, in the province of Cádiz. (Those who live in the new part of town, along the 2.5-mile Cortadura Beach, are referred to as “Bedouins” for having traveled into the “desert” to settle down.)\n\nOne of the things I noticed first is that the old town, Cádiz-cubed, feels lived in. Paint peels off the brightly colored buildings, and pharmacies and convenience stores are carved out of the ubiquitous oyster stone, in which traces of seashells can still be spotted. People walk their dogs past Cádiz Cathedral, a 19th-century monolith that dominates the horizon. Cannons dating to the Napoleonic Wars have been repurposed as guardrails, standing upright on corners to protect the buildings from turning cars.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
