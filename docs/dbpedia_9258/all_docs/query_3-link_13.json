        "text": "Cadiz, the province\n\nCadiz is the southernmost province in Spain. The rectangle formed by the cities of Cadiz, Chipiona, Sanlucar de Barrameda and Jerez de la Frontera makes up a varied, rich in natural resources, region peppered by countless delightful cities and friendly people. The are many different routes for visitors to enjoy: the sea route, the white villages’ route, the horse route, the vineyards route, and many more. Two of the most important rivers in Andalusia, the Guadalquivir and the Guadalete, cross the province.\n\nCrossing the isthmus that joins the city with the peninsula we find San Fernando and Puerto Real, which owes its name to the construction of a great port designed by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, the Catholic monarchs. As soon as we leave Puerto Real, we arrive at El Puerto de Santa Maria, a noteworthy city for many reasons: its wineries, fine seafood restaurants, and lively nightlife. The city of Rota is 15 Km away and there we can enjoy beautiful beaches and an excellent gastronomy. Chipiona offers visitors beautiful buildings and churches. Sanlucar de Barrameda is well known for its seafood, horse races in the beach, and for being the stepping stone to Europe’s most important natural resting place for migrating birds “El coto de Doñana”.\n\nFollowing the coast we can travel from Cadiz to Algeciras, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. We will find along the way extraordinary views and towns: lively Chiclana de la Frontera and Conil de la Frontera, old-fashioned Vejer de la Frontera, alternative lifestyle Caños de Meca, the fishing villages Barbate, Zahara de los Atunes, and Zahora before arriving to the windsurfer’s and surfer’s paradise: Tarifa.\n\nWe must not forget the inland routes: the sierra de Grazalema was the first area to be declared a Natural Park in Andalusia (a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1977), and is one of the most ecologically important areas of Spain. The area is famous for its spectacular limestone cliffs and landscape of gullies, caverns and gorges. The region is sprinkled with picturesque villages that are well worth the visit, such as Ubrique, famous for its views and leather manufacturing industry."
