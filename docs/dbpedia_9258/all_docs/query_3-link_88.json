        "text": "With a relaxed charm and engaging spirit, thereâs a host of wonderful things to do in CÃ¡diz, Spain. Find local bars, top attractions, and beautiful squares in this gleaming island city in AndalucÃ­a.\n\nCÃ¡diz is an island city in Spain, a medieval fortress surrounded on all sides by the Atlantic Ocean. Now heading into its fourth millennium, an influx of wealth from the Americas in the 18th century gave the city the bleached-white gleam it has today.\n\nAs one of the 10 previous capitals before Madrid (see our guide â things to do in Madrid) eventually took over, CÃ¡diz is tall, grand and graceful. Modern, yet old. Clean shiny streets and ancient stone quarters accommodate a host of wonderful things to do in CÃ¡diz.\n\nInside the walled city, the smell of the sea wafts through small plazas and long boulevards. Seagulls circle the medieval bell tower while flamenco music hangs in the air.\n\nA muted hum radiates from tiny tapas bars along uneven stone laneways. It propels tourists and locals to roam the streets searching for food; squinting in the dazzling light reflected from white-washed buildings surrounded by sea. The search leads to small squares where evenings proceed indefinitely, centred around simple tapas and local sherry.\n\nCÃ¡diz doesnât have the pull of AndalucÃ­aâs capital Seville, nor the historic fascination of CÃ³rdoba. But, perhaps the allure of CÃ¡diz is more appealing. Itâs for astute travellers, who know a good thing when they find it.\n\n1 â CATEDRAL DE CÃDIZ\n\nBuilt with American cash which eventually ran out in 1792, this hulking church dominates the city from most angles. Itâs not quite finished and a little patchy in places, which only adds to its colossal charm.\n\nThe CÃ¡diz Cathedral began life as baroque aspiration, but various delays saw neoclassical elements confuse the structure into an aesthetically pleasing mix of architectural styles. Nets drape the ceiling to stop the crumbling bits from hitting the floor.\n\nFar from being a distraction, this adds a certain âwork-in-progressâ charm.\n\nThe various chapels inside the building are stirring works of art. The free audio guide is charged correctly. Skip it and chart your own course.\n\n2 â CÃDIZ CATHEDRAL BELL TOWER (TORRE DE PONIENTE)\n\nThe CÃ¡diz Cathedral is best viewed from the seafront where the twin 131-foot bell towers preside over the old walled city. The walk up the ramp of the west bell tower (Torre de Poniente) is one of the best things to do in CÃ¡diz.\n\nBuilt after the church was completed in the cityâs golden age, the views from the tower over the old town are impressive. The golden tiles of the dome which crowns the cathedral are beautifully backed by the azure blue sea behind.\n\nWhile not as dramatic as the CÃ³rdoba Mosque/Cathedral, peering over the roof, you can still see signs of how CÃ¡diz cathedral was converted from a mosque.\n\nItâs well worth taking the climb up to check it out.\n\n3 â ORATORIA DE LA SANTA CUEVA\n\nDiscovering places like Oratorio de la Santa Cueva is one of the great things about travelling in Spain.\n\nSituated behind a very unassuming faÃ§ade, the oratorio belonged to the mysterious Spiritual Withdrawal Congregation. Leading figures of CÃ¡diz in the 18th century, they used the building to withdraw and undertake their spiritual penance.\n\nAfter descending a beautiful marble staircase, a very austere chapel with bare pillars and washed out stone walls feels dank and ominous. In contrast, the upstairs chapel, or the High Sacramental Chapel, is remarkably ornate.\n\nDeliberately designed to contrast the penitential space downstairs, the upper chapel of Oratoria de la Santa Cueva is ostentatious and uplifting.\n\nDappled with sunlight via beautiful stain glass windows, itâs a wonderful thing to do in CÃ¡diz. The high chapel also contains a secret stash of works by Goya painted into the arches above the alcoves.\n\n4 â MUSEO DE CÃDIZ â MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS & ARCHAEOLOGY MUSEUM\n\nThe Museum of CÃ¡diz combines the Museum of Fine Arts and the Archaeological Museum in one tired building.\n\nThe downstairs archaeology collection contains Phoenician and Roman artefacts discovered in AndalucÃ­a dating back to the 5th century BCE. T\n\nhe collection was built upon the chance finding of a male anthropoid sarcophagus in a nearby wharf. This now dominates the display downstairs, along with a number of other important archaeological finds.\n\nUpstairs contains the fine art collection of Spanish works from the 18th to early 20th centuries. This unassuming gallery has managed to score some big names.\n\nThe 18 canvases of angels and monks by Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡n are excellent. Murillo, Rubens and MirÃ³ have each contributed to this very good collection.\n\n5 â PLAZA DE SAN JUAN DE DIOS\n\nWithout the typical main square you might expect in places in AndalucÃ­a like CÃ¡diz, Plaza de San Juan de Dios has stepped into the void.\n\nAs the commercial centre of the city, the plaza is buzzing with local tapas bars, cafes and the usual big takeaway joints. Backing onto the harbour, the plaza is a great meeting point in the city. There is usually a craft market set up in the square, especially if cruise ships are in town. The cafÃ© terraces are a great place to escape the heat and partake in some classic people-watching.\n\nHowever, the standout feature is the beautiful CÃ¡diz City Hall. Framed by palm trees lining the square, huge Ionic columns, rising over a series of arches, support a clocktower overlooking CÃ¡diz.\n\nItâs free to enter the Town Hall but tours must be booked in advance. Unassuming from the outside, the decorative nave of the church of San Juan de Dios is also worth a look.\n\n6 â ROMAN THEATRE\n\nThe Roman Theatre of CÃ¡diz was built by Lucius Cornelius Balbus, a personal friend of Julius Caesar in an attempt to expand the city. Throughout the centuries it was built over, most recently by todayâs El PÃ³pulo neighbourhood.\n\nRemarkably it was only uncovered in 1890.\n\nIn its day, the theatre held 10,000 spectators in a horseshoe auditorium. The stage and portico have not been excavated and remain under the modern city.\n\nA museum explaining the history of the ruin and other Roman influences in CÃ¡diz is partially built over the excavated area. Glass walkways and panels provide better visibility of the theatre and how it has been consumed by city growth over the centuries.\n\n7 â MERCADO CENTRAL DE ABASTOS\n\nThe Mercado Central de Abastos is considered Spainâs oldest covered market. Built in 1839, several refurbishments have given the original neoclassic building a split personality. But itâs still doing what itâs been doing for centuries, housing a lively local market.\n\nOuter stalls are accessed through arches in the stone walls. Here, RincÃ³n GastromÃ³mico or Gourmet Corner takes place every day of the week.\n\nTempting morsels including grilled seafood, tortillas, and olives are on display, ready to eat. Other stalls provide the necessary accompaniments: cerveza (beer), vino (wine) and of course, jerez (sherry). You could also pick up a local Spanish Rum.\n\nInside the market, stalls are bursting with fruit, vegetables, meat and fish. The lively banter of locals negotiating their weekly shop fills the air with life. Mercado Central is a wonderful thing to do in CÃ¡diz. Donât miss the churros stand on the way out.\n\n8 â CASTILLO DE SANTA CATALINA\n\nCastillo de Santa Catalina is a fortress on a rocky outcrop on the CÃ¡diz harbour. It was built in the 17th century to defend the city from one of its most vulnerable fronts. As a result, it takes up a prime position overlooking the sea.\n\nThe star-shaped floor plan has survived to this day, practically intact. For a time it served as a military prison; some of the remnants of which are still visible today. The very picturesque Chapel of Santa Catalina add to the charm with excellent views over the CÃ¡diz bay.\n\nToday, the fortress is a multi-purpose recreational and cultural venue. It includes temporary exhibition rooms, educational spaces, and artistic workshops.\n\nOn our visit, there was an excellent photography exhibition upstairs and an impressionism display in the cavernous warren downstairs.\n\n9 â PARQUE GENOVÃS\n\nParque GenovÃ©s is a small peaceful park on the northwest edge of the city. Entering through the decorative gates, the park is a green sanctuary within the confines of the ancient stone walls of CÃ¡diz.\n\nThe scent of hundreds of species of trees and shrubs wafts through the air. With little stone bridges and antique benches, Parque GenovÃ©s has a romantic element. Itâs perfect for a mid-morning break from sightseeing in CÃ¡diz.\n\nGlimpses of the sea and the fortified Castillo de Santa Catalina are visible through the immaculately shaped trees and symmetrical flower beds. Take a coffee into the park and find a quiet spot to sit down and relax.\n\n10 â BARRIO DEL PÃPULO\n\nBarrio del PÃ³pulo is the oldest neighbourhood in CÃ¡diz. At just over one square kilometre between the Town Hall and the Cathedral, El PÃ³pulo is the original medieval centre dating back to the 13th century.\n\nConnected to the original walled perimeter of CÃ¡diz, entry is via one of the three remaining arches. Inside, a maze of narrow stone streets contains a host of churches, squares and interesting faÃ§ades.\n\nDonât miss the elaborate baroque palace of Casa del Almirante which dominates the tiny, secluded San Martin Square, surrounded by humble homes. Plaza de Fray FÃ©lix has an unusual drinking fountain dating back to Roman times which is also worth a look.\n\nHowever, the best way to see Barrio del PÃ³pulo is to stroll around and inspect the tiny shops and inviting tapas bars.\n\n11 â PEÃA FLAMENCA LA PERLA DE CÃDIZ\n\nCÃ¡diz, along with Jerez and Seville, is an important centre for Flamenco in Spain. Many of the bars in the city cater to tourists looking for a Flamenco fix. But PeÃ±a Folklorica at Perla de CÃ¡diz is where locals go to enjoy this expressive art form.\n\nSet next to the Atlantic Ocean, the dramatic mood outside is matched by the stomping, clapping and singing inside.\n\nWith a regular calendar of events that includes both the established stars of flamenco and a new generation of young rising talent, PeÃ±a Folklorica is one of the best places to witness flamenco in Spain. Experience the anger, sorrow and loneliness of this evocative expression in a truly local venue.\n\nThis is the real deal â thereâs no English on the menu and it can be difficult to get in. So, book in advance before you go to CÃ¡diz.\n\nFor another authentic flamenco experience, the cave performances in Granada [see our guide â best things to do in Granada] is thoroughly captivating.\n\n12 â LA CALETA BEACH\n\nThere are several great beaches south of CÃ¡diz, stretching along the coast. While they may not have the pull of the Spanish Canary Islands, they are well worth a visit while in CÃ¡diz. La Caleta is a lovely beach right in the heart of the city. Itâs a refreshing way to break up the sightseeing and a great thing to do in CÃ¡diz.\n\nLocated in the historical centre of the city, it is popular for both locals and tourists. As a result, it can get busy, but itâs well maintained, and the sunset views of the castles are some of the best in the city.\n\nAfter soaking up the rays, take a walk along the Fernando QuiÃ±ones Promenade to the gate of San SebastiÃ¡n, the 18th-century castle built to protect the city from the north.\n\nBarrio La ViÃ±a is very nearby, so when youâve sufficiently soaked up the sun, head here to find a local bar to unwind.\n\n13 â BARRIO LA VIÃA\n\nBarrio la ViÃ±a is the old fishermanâs quarter of CÃ¡diz, where the sherry flows freely from buzzing taverns and Andalusian tapas bars. Located on the western edge of the city, La ViÃ±a is filled with energy, local chatter and some of the best seafood in the city.\n\nStroll from one bar to the next catching glimpses of the seafront between the old stone laneways.\n\nTaberna Casa Manteca is a thoroughly authentic, traditional tapas bar where rustic dishes and great wines are served in a delightfully chaotic atmosphere. Taberna el Tio de La Tiza, deep in the backstreets of La ViÃ±a, has excellent seafood at great value prices.\n\nAfter getting your fill, take in the views of the beautiful church Parroquia de Nuestra Senora de la Palma.\n\n14 â PLAZA DE LAS FLORES\n\nAs one of the most colourful squares in CÃ¡diz, Plaza de las Flores is a lively plaza with a bustling flower market. Although there are plenty of tapas bars lining the square, most are quite touristy. So this is the place to have a coffee and watch the world go by, rather than settle in for lunch.\n\nFind a table at one of the cafes on the perimeter, order a coffee and watch the traders setting up their displays and locals haggling for the best prices.\n\nItâs a vibrant colourful square and one of the many things to do in CÃ¡diz thatâs all about soaking up the atmosphere.\n\nCÃDIZ TOURS\n\nCÃ¡diz is a relaxed and easy place to explore. Collecting most of the main tourist attractions can easily be done on foot. However, if you want to meet some other people along the way, or get local insights, here are a few organised tours of CÃ¡diz we recommend.\n\nBike Tours // Tours cover the main attractions of CÃ¡diz, plus the new town. Many will also venture out to the beaches south of the city. Baja Bikes has a 4-hour sightseeing tour which includes the main attractions plus Playa Santa MarÃ­a and La Caleta.\n\nTapas Tasting Tour // If your time is limited and yet you want to try a range of eating places then this tapas tasting tour is a great option. It visits 3 tapas bars over 3 hours and includes 6 dishes and 3 glasses of wine.\n\nWHERE TO EAT IN CÃDIZ\n\nWhile it doesnât have the free tapas culture of Granada (see our guide â things to do in Granada), youâll have no trouble finding great places to eat in CÃ¡diz. From cheap hole-in-the-wall tapas bars with their signature tuna almadrabas, to top-end dining on white tablecloths, CÃ¡diz has something for foodies of all tastes.\n\nBut, here are two particular places we recommend.\n\nCasa Lazo // Ideal for a local tapas lunch, Casa Lazo is CÃ¡diz relaxed eating at its best. Small, friendly and full of authentic charm, CafÃ© Lazo serves up excellent dishes at very affordable prices. Their croquetas and gambas pil pil was top notch.\n\nTaberna El Tio de la Tiza // One of the best things to do in CÃ¡diz is to dine outside in a square. Taberna El Tio de la Tiza is an ideal place to do this. They serve up a great selection of Andalusian specialities with a high focus on fresh local fish. For us though, it was the pork cheeks in PX sauce that really won us over. That and the very friendly service.\n\nHOW TO GET TO CÃDIZ\n\nCÃ¡diz is located on the coast in southwest Spain, 121 kilometres from Seville. With Spainâs excellent high-speed train network, and several airports nearby, getting to CÃ¡diz is very easy.\n\nFLY\n\nCÃ¡diz is within easy proximity of 3 international airports.\n\nJerez Airport // Jerez is 43 kilometres away from CÃ¡diz and a good option if youâre travelling to CÃ¡diz from another Spanish city. A few budget airlines also fly to Jerez from international destinations, including Ryanair from the UK. There is a direct train service from the airport to CÃ¡diz which takes about 50 minutes, but it is rather infrequent.\n\nSeville Airport // Seville is 130 kilometres away from CÃ¡diz. There are regular flights from several European cities, therefore this is probably the most convenient airport. The easiest way to get to CÃ¡diz from Seville is via a 90-minute direct train from Sevilla Santa Justa station. Read more in our guide to visiting Seville, Spain.\n\nMalaga Airport // Malaga is 230 kilometres from CÃ¡diz. Malaga has a large airport with several daily flights from many international locations. The best way to get to CÃ¡diz is to drive, which takes around 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nTRAIN\n\nCÃ¡diz is on one of Spainâs high-speed train services called Alvia, which connects the major cities in AndalucÃ­a with Madrid.

There are 3-5 services daily.\n\nThe mainline from Madrid to CÃ¡diz also stops in other popular Andalusian destinations including CÃ³rdoba, Seville and Jerez.

In winter, the average is around 13Â°C (55Â°F) while summer highs average about 28Â°C (82Â°F).\n\nCadiz is a good destination all year round, but is best from April, after the winter rains have eased, to October. If you donât like it too warm try to avoid July and August when the cityâs temperatures can reach above 30 degrees on the odd day, and it is a little busier with summer tourists.\n\nCARNIVAL OF CÃDIZ\n\nThe Carnival of CÃ¡diz is the biggest on mainland Spain. From the weekend before Ash Wednesday, and lasting for 10 days, the city is full of colour, frivolity and raucous music. Planned street processions, impromptu concerts, comedians and puppet shows fill CÃ¡diz with a carnival air.\n\nThe Carnival brings hordes of visitors to CÃ¡diz so book well in advance if youâre travelling over this time.\n\nDAY TRIPS FROM CÃDIZ\n\nCÃ¡diz is well located to take advantage of the best the region has to offer. Surfing beaches, the famous sherry triangle and world-class historical cities are all on the doorstep. Here are some great day trips from CÃ¡diz.\n\nTarifa // Tarifa is a popular surfing destination on the southern tip of Spain where the Atlantic meets the Mediterranean.
