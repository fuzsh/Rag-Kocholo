        "text": "Our travel guide to Cadiz city\n\nCádiz, commonly known among Spaniards as “Tacita de Plata”, is a jewel surrounded by the sea. Its more than three thousand years of history, rich heritage, colonial air, cuisine, festivities and people make this city a unique place to visit. In addition, it has a simply spectacular city beach. Thanks to this Travel Guide to Cadiz city you can find all the activities and the best travel tips for your trip.\n\nIt is considered the oldest city in the West. Phoenicians would make Gadir an important commercial colony in which Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths and Muslims later settled.\n\nFrom the splendid Gades, the Roman Theatre (1st century BC), in El Pópulo neighbourhood, is preserved in very good condition. A cosmopolitan and open city, Columbus chose its port as a starting point for his second trip to the New World. The city would become a port of the Indies, bringing together the commercial flow with America.\n\nThis frantic commercial activity resulted in a time of economic and cultural splendour, in which the Baroque palaces are erected with their characteristic lookout towers. In the Oratory of San Felipe Neri, headquarters in 1812 of the Cortes of Cádiz, the first Spanish Constitution was drafted, nicknamed “La Pepa” for the day of its birth (festival of San José).\n\nMust do while in Cádiz\n\nDuring your stay, the Cathedral is a must. It is visible from the sea, and its pieces of art are among the most important ones in Spain. Look at its defensive bastions and walled access to the old town. Wander the narrow streets and small squares that you can find in such popular neighbourhoods as La Viña, El Mentidero, Santa María or El Pópulo.\n\nCarnival, declared of International Tourist Interest, is the most important festival in Cadiz city. The entire town disguises itself and goes out to live the joy and laughter of this celebration amid choirs, chirigotas and troupes (comparsas) that parody and criticise, in a tone of satire, all the current events of the year.\n\nDon’t forget to stop by the beaches of Cádiz and, among them, La Caleta. This is the most representative beach of those in the capital, distributed throughout the city for several kilometres of lively promenades.\n\nMain Activities: Cuisine, Beaches, History, Shopping.\n\nContent Source: TUDESTINO.TRAVEL\n\nIt is considered the oldest city in the West.
