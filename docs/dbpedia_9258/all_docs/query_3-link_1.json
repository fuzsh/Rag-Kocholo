        "text": "Cádiz, provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southwestern Spain, fronting the Mediterranean Sea to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It was formed in 1833 from districts taken from Sevilla. The enclave of Ceuta on the Moroccan coast was administratively part of Cádiz until 1995.\n\nThe eastern part of the province is crossed by wooded spurs of the Baetic Cordillera, while the west-central part is a low plain crossed by the Guadalete and Barbate rivers and their tributaries. Along the coast are numerous salt ponds that constitute the basis for one of the province’s most important industries. The provincial coastline also has important harbours, including the Bays of Gibraltar and Cádiz. Point Tarifa (Point Marroquí), on the Strait of Gibraltar, is the southernmost cape on the European mainland. The mild climate and naturally fertile soil make fruit and vine growing the chief economic activities, though severe droughts often cause great distress. Jerez de la Frontera is famous for the production and export of sherry. Cork is obtained from the mountain forests, and fish are caught off the coast (at Algeciras and Barbate) and salted for export. Much salt is obtained by evaporation of seawater in pans near Cádiz city. The city used to be a shipbuilding centre, but now the manufacturing of parts for the oil and gas industry are prominent near the Bay of Cádiz. The petrochemical industry is dominant in Algeciras Bay. Apart from Cádiz, the provincial capital, important urban centres are Algeciras, Tarifa, Jerez de la Frontera, and Rota. Railway communication is limited in the west to a line from Sevilla to Cádiz, with branchlines from Sanlúcar de Barrameda to Jerez and El Puerto de Santa María, and in the east to a line from Sevilla to Algeciras. Area 2,871 square miles (7,436 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 1,207,343."
