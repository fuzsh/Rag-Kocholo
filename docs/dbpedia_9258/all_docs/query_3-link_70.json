Also, top 10 restaurants in Cadiz and a glimpse into Andalusia's one of the biggest Carnivals!\n\nCadiz in my opinion is the little secret of Andalusia! Being one of the oldest cities in Europe, Cadiz offers a variety of museums, art galleries, cultural events and also hosts one of the biggest Carnivals in Spain. Situated in a very appealing place, Cadiz offers many kilometre long beaches and at the same time boasts a lovely old town and city. In this, they have various restaurants, bars and bubbling nightlife.\n\nCadiz is the capital of Cadiz province, so do not mix up the city with the province. In this travel guide, I am covering Cadiz city.\n\nHow to get to Cadiz\n\nWhat to explore in Cadiz\n\nCuisine in Cadiz\n\nTop 10 restaurants in Cadiz\n\nCadiz Carneval\n\nVideo\n\nHow to get to Cadiz\n\nThe biggest and closest airport is in Sevilla. There is a closer airport in Jerez but it is not so big so fewer options. You can also fly into Malaga but that will take a bit longer than Sevilla. Spain, in general, has a great train system, so from many major and smaller cities in Spain you can get by on the train. Once you get to Cadiz, you won’t need a car much, as the old town which is the city centre is quite small so everything is within walking distance. Also, the most popular beach is almost in the centre, but more about the most popular places will be explained in the next paragraph.\n\nWhat to explore in Cadiz\n\nFirst and most importantly - THE Cathedral! It is one of the main landmarks that shape the whole old town. It is a spectacular building built in the 18th century, but funny enough it is actually the ‘new’ cathedral, as the original one is situated just on the other side of the main square - Plaza de San Juan de Dios.\n\nPlaza de San Juan de Dios is a great place for lunch. You can have traditional Spanish tapas or any other food overlooking the cathedral.\n\nTorre Tavira lookout tower. This tower although the tallest one in Cadiz city, is actually not that noticeable. I only found out about it on my 3rd visit, but once you get up there the views are incredible and you really can say you are at the highest peak of Cadiz city. Note: You have to book your visit in advance. You can do it here: https://www.torretavira.com/en/\n\nCadiz Museum in the Plaza de Mina. The museum has 3 floors and each floor explains different times. If you are a European passport holder then you definitely need to visit it, as an entrance for you will be for free!\n\nCaleta Beach is not only the central beach of Cadiz but also a popular place to gather and socialise. If you prefer more discreet beaches then you will need to take a short drive out of the city centre and you will find Playa de Santa Maria del Mar, Playa de la Victoria, Playa de la Cortadura, Playa del Chato, Playa de Santibanez and Playa de Torregorda. (Playa = Beach). All these beaches are great for beginner surfers too.\n\nCastillo de Santa Catalina is a lovely castle located on the side of Caleta beach that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. The entrance is free.\n\nGenoves Park has an incredibly beautiful garden. It is not a very big park but definitely a very fascinating one to walk through.\n\nPlaza de España is another great location. Every major city in Spain has Plaza de Espana. (Plaza = Square) In Cadiz, the Plaza de España is not as big as in other cities but definitely presents a beautiful status symbolising the city. It is definitely worth a quick visit.\n\nCuisine in Cadiz\n\nCadiz originally was a fishing town. Now grown into a massive port city Cadiz is one the biggest tuna producers in the world. Fishing is still going strong in the area so I highly recommend eating as much fish as possible while in Cadiz as the quality and freshness is suburb.\n\nAll the most popular dishes are to do with fish. 2 local dishes I have to highlight as the most traditional ones specifically in Cadiz are:\n\nTortillitas De Camarones (Shrimp Fritters)\n\nPapas con choco (Cuttlefish and Potato Stew)\n\nInteresting fact: During the time Cadiz football team plays, many bars serve food in a yellow colour, in that way supporting their team as yellow is the Cadiz football team’s colour!\n\nHere is the list of top 10 restaurants in Cadiz:\n\nAsador Puntaparrilla\n\nLa Mafia se Sienta a la Mesa - Cadiz\n\nAlmarcen Tavern\n\nBAR La Tabernita\n\nEl Fogon de Mariana - Antulo\n\nLa Punta Del Sur\n\nNebula Restaurante\n\nLa Veganesa\n\nAnca Lidia\n\nBeach Club Potito\n\nCadiz Carnaval\n\nCadiz is a great place to visit in summer but in February Cadiz organises one of the biggest carnivals in Spain gathering people from all over the world. It is a super fun time of the year in Cadiz city when everyone gathers on the streets of Cadiz to dance and sing and just have the best time. Cadiz city organises events throughout the week with a big finale on the weekend.\n\nI have been lucky to live close enough to Cadiz to visit it several times in summer and join in at the Carnival so I have put together a video for you to see a small glimpse of what the city has to offer and also some carnival moments!"
