        "text": "Every year, Lonely Planet releases its list of top travel destinations in the world. Their 2020 list, issued shortly before the pandemic, listed Cádiz province as one of the top 10 regions to check out in 2020. When the list was posted, I don’t think anyone knew that the world would come to a screeching halt and travel restricted globally. However, the upside is that personnel at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Rota are able to explore the province without a lot of tourists!\n\nThe Cádiz province spans from beautiful beaches along the Costa de la Luz, or coast of light, to the mountains of Grazalema with history and culture sprinkled throughout. Take this time to get to fully explore – and enjoy – your adopted Spanish home. Here’s a list to get you started.\n\nGastronomy Experiences\n\nLearn a bit about Spanish food and culture by better understanding the process of making various gourmet food products. Some examples would be making cheese at El Bucarito cheese factory (Rota), exploring the world of bees at the Museo de la Miel y las Abejas (Jerez de la Frontera), learning the process of flaked sea salt at Salinas de Chiclana (Chiclana de la Frontera), and viewing olive oil production in Zahara de la Sierra (more on this later in the article). Spanish cuisine focuses on quality ingredients, and learning how these products are produced will give you a greater appreciation.\n\nCooking Classes\n\nTo further enhance the gastronomy experiences, take a cooking class. Cooking classes are a great way to delve deeper into the culture, learn key ingredients and techniques, and enjoy a delicious dish or meal at the end. There are a several cooking class options in the Cádiz province such as Learning & Cooking (Rota), More than Spanish (El Puerto de Santa María), and Annie B’s Spanish Kitchen (Vejer de la Frontera).\n\nSearching for “Calabazas”\n\nThe town of Rota is known for “calabazas” or pumpkins. The city put together an art installation with 150 pumpkins – both colorful and white – hidden around the town. They are on roofs or clustered on the white-washed walls. Head downtown to seek out as many pumpkins as you can find. Don’t forget to head to one of the many local pastry/bread shops to try Rota’s mayetito sweet. The pastry is named after the traditional farmers of this area and consists of pumpkin, chocolate and almonds.\n\nSan Marcos Castle\n\nLocated in El Puerto de Santa María, the Gothic-style San Marcos castle is an easy excursion for base personnel. The twelfth-century fortress was commissioned by Alfonso “The Wise” and built on top of a Moorish mosque along the Guadalete River. The fortress and gardens are accessible by tours (for a fee) in addition to cultural events hosted by the castle. Located in the downtown area, you can easily find an outdoor terrace to enjoy a Spanish lunch afterwards.\n\nLearn about Spain’s Liquid Gold\n\nSpain is the world’s largest producer of olive oil and the Andalucian region produces a bulk of it. Olive oil is often referred to as “liquid gold” and anyone who has tried local, small batch olive oil knows why – the taste and complexity is far superior to anything in the stores! Living in Cádiz province means we have good quality local olive oil, particularly around Zahara de la Sierra. Here, you can visit a working olive press and learn more about the process from tree to bottle. The two major mills are the traditional El Molino Vinculo and the more modern Oleum Viride. Both require reservations to tour the facilities but you can purchase olive oil at their store or in specialty shops in Zahara de la Sierra.\n\nEnjoy the Sierras\n\nThe weather in Cádiz province allows for hiking year round and there are two natural parks within its borders, Parque Natural sierra de Grazalema and Parque Natural de los Alcornocales. Grazalema offers visitors outdoor adventures direct from quaint mountain villages. The hikes within los Alcoronocales are a bit more remote but the scenery is stunning. The visitor center for Grazalema natural park is located in El Bosque and the visitor center El Ajibe for los Alcornocales is located right off the A-381..\n\nTour the “Pueblo Blancos”\n\nAndalucia is speckled with “pueblo blancos,” or white villages, all over but Cádiz province has some beautiful and unique ones. While everyone has a favorite, some of the popular ones include Arcos de la Frontera, Zahara de la Sierra, Grazalema, Sentenil de las Bodegas, Ubrique, Vejer de la Frontera, and Castellar de la Frontera. Many of these can be combined into a day trip, a weekend getaway, or serve as a destination itself.\n\nDive into Cádiz’s Moorish Past\n\nThe Moors, or North Africans, lived in this area for over 700 years leaving their imprint. Delve into the Spain’s Moorish Al Andalus by relaxing at a traditional hammam, or bath, with the scent of oranges and soft music. There are several hammams within Cádiz province as well as Andalucian region. Go enjoy a Moroccan meal at the famous El Jardin del Califa or one of the many other Moroccan restaurants in Vejer de la Frontera before wandering the streets. Head to Spain’s southernmost city of Tarifa where its chill vibe is mixed with both Spanish and Arabic feels. On clear days, you can also see across the Strait of Gibraltar to Morocco.\n\nYurts, Boutique Hotels and More\n\nWhy not make your lodging the destination? Cádiz province has plenty of unique lodging options such as camping on the beach front or in the mountains, yurts, rustic houses with pools, swanky boutique hotels, houseboats, government-run Parador hotels, and everything in between. While it may not be a new destination, you can create a new experience by selecting a unique lodging option.\n\nEnjoy the Sherry Triangle\n\nRota is right in the middle of the “Sherry triangle” of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. Many bodegas in the area offer tours allowing you to check out the diversity in sherry wines and bodegas. Jerez is the heart of sherry wine with multiple bodegas within the city limits and surrounding area. Sanlúcar de Barrameda is the place to go to sample sweeter sherry wine called manzanilla, which is produced the same way as traditional sherry but nuanced by the sea air. From impressive private art collections like Bodegas Tradición to sherry-sipping mice at Bodega Gonzales-Byass “Tio Pepe,” there is sure to be a bodega and sherry wine to fit everyone.\n\nBattle of Trafalgar\n\nOne of naval history’s greatest battles, the Battle of Trafalgar, took place at Cape Trafalgar on October 21, 1805 off the coast of Caños de Mecca. The naval engagement took place between the British and a combined Spanish and French forces. Though outnumbered, Sir Nelson’s 27 British ships overtook the 33 French and Spanish ships. Head down to Cape Trafalgar to wander around this piece of history including the lighthouse, faro de Trafalgar, and the coastline trails.\n\nWhen in Rome …\n\nExplore one of Andalucia’s most important Roman archeological sites, Baelo Claudia. This cultural site is a perfect option for getting outdoors while checking out a historical beachside ruins with views to Morocco on clear days. There is a small museum at the start to provide an overview of its history and important archeological finds before entering the outdoor portion with the remains of a theater, forum, thermal baths, and steps and columns of a basilica. The museum’s hours vary so it is best to check or call prior to driving there. A visit to the museum is easily combined with a beach day or exploring a nearby coastal town.\n\nMeander Cádiz\n\nCádiz, just across the bay from Rota, is considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe. Founded by the Phoenicians in 1100BC, the bustling inner labyrinth of streets can be disorienting at times but you never get too lost! The city has a pleasant coastal boardwalk that runs the perimeter of the peninsula allowing you to enjoy the views of the ocean as well as tiny streets that spill into plazas full of cafes and restaurants. Stop by the Mercado Central de Abastos to pick up picnic goodies to enjoy on the beach, park, or boardwalk, or there are numerous restaurants with outdoor seating throughout the city. Some key sights should you wish to check them out are the Cádiz Cathedral and its Torre del Reloj, Parque del Genovés, Museo de Cádiz, and Torre Tavira. Double check openings and hours as they have been changing frequently due to COVID restrictions.\n\nArt in Nature\n\nFor art lovers or those wishing to mix culture and outdoors, a visit to Fundación NMAC located just south of Vejer de la Frontera is a must. The outdoor art installations are set against a natural setting. Currently with COVID restrictions, the outdoor path is one-way only and the indoor art installations may be closed. It makes for a perfect morning activity before heading to Vejer de la Frontera for a leisurely lunch.\n\nGo with a Guide\n\nLocal guides can help you gain a deeper appreciation for a specific destination or activity. City tours with a local guide can take you to the key tourist sites in addition to explaining the nuances of the city and getting you to the best restaurants loved by locals. Trying a new activity is not only safer but more enjoyable when you go with a knowledgeable guide, particularly for outdoor activities. Cádiz province has guided hikes, falconry, canyon descending, rock climbing, paddle boarding, and more within its perimeter.\n\nEnjoy the Beaches\n\nWhile it’s not prime sunbathing weather, the limited number of people at the beaches make it enjoyable and easy to maintain distance from others. Go on a Cádiz beach tour and check out unique ones like Caños de Mecca surrounded by cliffs, the sand dune of Bolonia, the famous La Caleta beach in Cádiz city, and kitesurfers near Tarifa. Or just head to your local beach to enjoy the fresh ocean breeze, sand in your toes, and sunshine!\n\n“Live Your Best Life” is a phrase frequently used by Naval Station (NAVSTA) Rota’s Commanding Officer, Capt. David Baird. This series of travel pieces will feature opportunities to get outside the gates and into the local culture. The series will primarily focus on destinations located within day trip or overnight from the installation.\n\nNote: Due to the current situation, this article focused primarily on open-air locations and activities. Travelers are still required to follow all host nation restrictions while exploring the province. Follow Naval Station Rota, Spain's Facebook page for current restrictions."
