Biography

Johann Gottfried Metzger was a Volga German.

Johann Gottfried Metzger was born in 1784. According to baptism records, his brother is most likely Johann George Metzger (1780).[1]

Johann Gottfried Metzger (erroneously listed as Metzler) is age 14 in 1798 Stahl am Tarlyk census in Household No. 17. He is listed with his brother Johann Georg, age 18, both listed as Elisabetha Brickmann's sons by deceased first husband Johann Georg Metzger who lived in Anton. Their mother was first married to Metzger, then married to her second husband Langmacher as his children are listed as stepchildren in the same census recording. Langmacher must have died as she is the wife to Simon Maier of Mariental (26-year age difference). They must have had a son Johann Heinrich Maier about 1791.[2]

Anton census of 1798 lists a Johannes, age 14 (born about 1784) as son to Georg Metzger (1758). The wife of Georg is listed as Anna Barbara Iezd with a ?, age 30.[3] Perhaps there was a different Johann Georg Metzger as a son to Johann Georg Metzger (1719) as it would be unusual he is listed in 1798 census in two different colonies.

He married Julianna Katharina Bessinger.

He passed away 7 Dec 1847 in Stahl am Tarlyk at age 63 years and 2 months.[4]
