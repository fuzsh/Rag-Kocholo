Biography

JOHANN “HANS” ADAM METZGER was born in 1701 in Mainzweiler, Germany. He was the son of Johann Phillip Metzger and Anna Katharina Dhom. He married Maria Catherine Scherer (1715-1748), daughter of Johann Kasper Scherer and Anna Catharina Mueller, in 1736 in Nieder-Linxweiler, Germany. They had around 5 children: George[1]; Maria[2]; Johann (1743-1807); Dorothea[3]; and Catharina[4]. It is thought that his occupation was as a weaver. German government records granted permission to both him, under the name of Hans Adam Metzger, and his Georg Valentin Metzger, to leave Nieder-Linxweiler in 1749. There is no immigration records of his family entering into Philadelphia with the other Palatines around this time period. However, there were 2 ships in 1749, “Francis and Elizabeth” and “Rachel” that no one was allowed to disembark in Philadelphia because of how many sick individuals were on the ships.[5][6][7] It is likely that they eventually did recover and were released farther along in the ships’ routes, which may have been in New Jersey or Deleware. There was a group of other Germans (Balthasar Bach, Johann Adam Beck, Nicolaus Konig, and Andreas Paulus) that are from Nieder-Linxweiler, not found on any immigration lists, but were residing in Frederick, Maryland.[8] A minister report in 1796 regarding Balthasar Bach notes “... in 1749 toward the end of the year he came to this land from Germany with some of his countrymen, here to Fredericktown.” Johann’s brother George was noted to be in Frederick Co., Maryland in 1750 when he sued another German, Nicholas Bunderick (Bunderick came to America in 1741 but he was from the same region, therefore they probably knew each other and owed a debt). Johann is noted to be a member of the Frederick Lutheran church when his son Johann (not our descendant) was baptized in 1751, with George’s wife sponsoring the baptism. His date of death and location is unconfirmed, but because his wife died in Woodbury, Pennsylvania it is thought that he died there as well.
