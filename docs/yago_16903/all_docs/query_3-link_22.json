According to baptism records, his brother is most likely Johann George Metzger (1780).[1]\n\nJohann Gottfried Metzger (erroneously listed as Metzler) is age 14 in 1798 Stahl am Tarlyk census in Household No. 17. He is listed with his brother Johann Georg, age 18, both listed as Elisabetha Brickmann's sons by deceased first husband Johann Georg Metzger who lived in Anton. Their mother was first married to Metzger, then married to her second husband Langmacher as his children are listed as stepchildren in the same census recording. Langmacher must have died as she is the wife to Simon Maier of Mariental (26-year age difference). They must have had a son Johann Heinrich Maier about 1791.[2]\n\nAnton census of 1798 lists a Johannes, age 14 (born about 1784) as son to Georg Metzger (1758). The wife of Georg is listed as Anna Barbara Iezd with a ?, age 30.[3] Perhaps there was a different Johann Georg Metzger as a son to Johann Georg Metzger (1719) as it would be unusual he is listed in 1798 census in two different colonies.\n\nHe married Julianna Katharina Bessinger.\n\nHe passed away 7 Dec 1847 in Stahl am Tarlyk at age 63 years and 2 months.[4]\n\nChildren\n\nJulianna Catharina Metzger: Birth: 21 Dec 1807 in Stahl am Tarlyk[5]\n\nJohann Heinrich Metzger: Birth: 10 SEP 1809 in Stahl am Tarlyk Death: 11 OCT 1809 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nAnna Katharina Metzger: Birth: 3 SEP 1810 in Stahl am Tarlyk Death: 30 NOV 1810 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nMaria Katharina Metzger: Birth: 13 SEP 1812 in Stahl am Tarlyk Death: 15 SEP 1812 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nChristina Elisabeth Metzger: Birth: 18 OCT 1813 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nGeorg Balthasar Metzger: Birth: 20 JUL 1816 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nGeorg Andreas Metzger: Birth: 4 AUG 1817 in Stahl am Tarlyk Death: 11 MAY 1818 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nJohann Heinrich Metzger: Birth: 29 OCT 1819 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nJohann Gottfried Metzger: Birth: ABT 1824 in Stahl am Tarlyk Death: 1852 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nKatharina Margaretha Metzger: Birth: ABT 1827 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nGeorg Jakob Metzger: Birth: JUN 1834 in Stahl am Tarlyk Death: 23 APR 1858 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nJohann Christian Metzger: Birth: 28 OCT 1836 in Stahl am Tarlyk\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1794-1861 Stahl am Tarlyk (Stepnoje), Russia Birth Records (Mueller Davenport/Brandenburg) American Historical Society of Germans from Russia (AHSGR) Lincoln, Nebraska 2019.
