        "text": "Metzger History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nBavaria, Germany is the ancestral home of the Metzger family. The Germans began using hereditary surnames in the 12th century. Metzger is an occupational name, which was derived from the kind of work done by the original bearer. It is a name for a butcher. The surname Metzger is derived from the German word metzger, which means butcher.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Metzger family\n\nThe surname Metzger was first found in Bavaria, where the name became noted for its many branches within the region, each house acquiring a status and influence which was envied and enrolled by the princes of the region. Chronicles first mention Burch vor der Mezzje of Zuerich in 1258, and Conrad hinter der Mezzje of Constance in 1259. The literal translation of the name into English would be \"butcher\" or \"meat market.\" In their later history the family became a power unto themselves, and were elevated to the ranks of nobility as they grew into a most influential family.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Metzger family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Metzger research.
