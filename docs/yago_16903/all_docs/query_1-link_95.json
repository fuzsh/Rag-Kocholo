        "text": "The literature on wine and viticulture is at least as varied and extensive as the wines of this world. Even in the Old Testament of the Bible, but also in older works, wine is a central theme and is often mentioned. Viticulture and wine culture at a professional level already existed at least 6,000 to perhaps 8,000 years ago in antiquity. The origins of cultivated grapevines and viticulture lie in Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia(Georgia) and south-east Anatolia in Turkey. Wine was already being written about at that time, but this cannot yet be described as wine literature. The oldest witness to Greek wine culture is Homer, who in his works Iliad and Odyssey around 730 BC wrote poetically about viticulture and wine enjoyment."
