        "text": "Metzler History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nBavaria, Germany is the ancestral home of the Metzler family. The Germans began using hereditary surnames in the 12th century. Metzler is an occupational name, which was derived from the kind of work done by the original bearer. It is a name for a butcher. The surname Metzler is derived from the German word metzger, which means butcher.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Metzler family\n\nThe surname Metzler was first found in Bavaria, where the name became noted for its many branches within the region, each house acquiring a status and influence which was envied and enrolled by the princes of the region. Chronicles first mention Burch vor der Mezzje of Zuerich in 1258, and Conrad hinter der Mezzje of Constance in 1259. The literal translation of the name into English would be \"butcher\" or \"meat market.\" In their later history the family became a power unto themselves, and were elevated to the ranks of nobility as they grew into a most influential family.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Metzler family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Metzler research.

Each had its own dialect and traditions, and unique variations of popular names. Low German, which is similar to contemporary Dutch, was spoken in Westphalia. German names are characterized by additions such as regional suffixes and phrases that tell something about the origin or background of its original bearer. Further contributing to the variation in German names was the fact that there were no spelling rules in medieval times: scribes recorded names according to their sound. The recorded spelling variations of Metzler include Metzger, Mezger, Metzeler, Metzler, Mezler and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Metzler family\n\nProminent among members of the name Metzler in this period include Georg Balthasar Metzger (1623-1687), a German physician and scientist, one of the four founding members of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in Schweinfurt; Joseph Mezger (1635-1683), an Austrian Benedictine of St. Peter's Archabbey, Salzburg; Francis Mezger (1632-1701)...\n\nAnother 48 words (3 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Metzler Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMetzler Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Metzler is the 3,737th most popular surname with an estimated 7,461 people with that name. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nMetzler migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of German settlers came to North America between the mid-17th and mid-20th centuries.
