O. St Clair, was born at Hurnheim, in the western part of Bavaria, Germany, September 1, 1831; his father's name was Zacharias J. HUSEL, was a manufacturer and dealer in woolen and cotton goods, and served as Town Councilor for fifteen years prior to leaving his native place. Andrew received a liberal education in the public schools of his country up to his fourteenth year; after that he received some private tuition in the higher mathematics. In 1850, his father with his family emigrated to the United States and the same year came to St Clair, and the following year bought the land which is now owned and occupied by his son, Andrew. After their settlement Andrew became a pupil in the High School at St Clair, his object was to obtain knowledge of the English language. In the winter of 1851, he entered the employ of John NICHOLS, woolen manufacturer, and the following year he with his two brothers began to clear the land his father purchased; his father died the same year, and Andrew assumed the management of affairs; he was married December 3, 1852; his wife's maiden name was Miss Maria Ann KLINGERS; she was born in Deggingen, Bavaria. Since then Mr. HUSEL has been successfully engaged in farming; during the war he enlisted and served in the Fourth Regiment Michigan Infantry, in the Army of the Cumberland, and was discharged in 1866; has served as President of the Farmer's Protective Association of China Township and is President of the German Mutual Farmer's Insurance Company; has served as member of Executive Board of County Agricultural Society, and is actively identified with the interests of the town and county. Mr. and Mrs. HUSEL have seven children-Fred, lives in the town of St Clair; Charles, at home; Mary in Dakota; Jennie, now Mrs. PARSONS; Helen, now Mrs. BATHEY, in Dakota; Andrew, now in Dakota; Laura, at home. pg. 722 China Twp\n\n- Source: Biographies from History of St Clair County by A.T.Andreas (1883)\n\nAnna Margaret Husel\n\nBorn: May 1, 1819, Huernheim\n\nEmigrated: 1850, Aristedes, Brem-NY, arrived October 21, 1850\n\nMarried: Fred Lanzer\n\n1860 Census: with children, St.Clair Ward 1\n\nChild: Mary, died May 12, 1882, age 20, died of double pneumonia\n\n1900 Census: St.Clair Ward 2, in son-in-law's household\n\nDied: September 16, 1901\n\n- German Source: GtoA Vol1 p324\n\n- US Sources: 1860, 1870 US Census; 1894 MI Census; St.Clair Marriages; GENDIS Ledger P142 Record 4282; 1894 Michigan Census; A.Husel Autobiography\n\nFrederick Husel\n\nBorn: February 23, 1829, Huernheim\n\nEmigrated: 1850, Aristedes, Brem-NY, arrived October 21, 1850\n\nMarried: \"Frederick Hersel\" - November 1850, Anna Maria Klingler, age 18, witnesses: Fredrick Turner & Andrew Hull; H H Morgan JP\n\n1880 Census: St Clair, St Clair, Michigan - Fred Husel, 27, Farmer, MI, F-Bavaria, M-Bavaria\n\n- Jennie, Wife, 20, Keeping house, MI, F-NY, M-NY\n\n- Addie B., Sister-in-law, 20, At home, MI, F-NY, M-NY\n\nDied: 1851, age 33, dies and is the 9th buried in cemetery\n\n- German Source: GtoA Vol1 p324\n\n- US Sources: St.Clair Marriages; Obituary, Mrs. Andrew Husel; 1880 US Census\n\nGeorg Joshua Husel\n\nBorn: April 20, 1822, Huernheim\n\nEmigrated: 1849, travelled with Fred Lanzer\n\nMarried: (1) November 5, 1850, Christiana Riche, age 28 (d.
