        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nMetabolic dysfunction Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) represents a heterogeneous spectrum of changes to the liver including hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), steatohepatitis [fatty liver with lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injury (ballooning)], pericellular fibrosis, and cirrhosis [1,2]. The prevalence of MAFLD is estimated at 25% globally, MAFLD is the most rapidly increasing indication for liver transplantation in the US, and it is predicted that MAFLD will soon become the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma [[1], [2], [3]]. Despite these large numbers of affected individuals, a complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of MAFLD and disease progression is lacking. Also, just a single drug has been approved (only recently) by the FDA for the treatment of MAFLD.\n\nWe recently reported on the metabolic and cognitive effects of deleting the LEAP2 gene or reducing LEAP2 expression [4,5]. LEAP2 (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2), a 40-aa long peptide hormone, and the better characterized peptide hormone ghrelin both are ligands of the G-protein coupled receptor GHSR (growth hormone secretagogue receptor). Ghrelin is a GHSR agonist; it is secreted primarily from the stomach and duodenum [6,7]. In humans and rodents, plasma ghrelin levels increase upon fasting and before meals and decline in obesity and after meals [6,8,9]. Administered ghrelin acts in the brain to increase food intake, body weight, and blood glucose, lower energy expenditure, and engage hedonic eating [6,8]. Neutralizing ghrelin and GHSR antagonist treatment lower body weight and/or food intake [10,11]. Although neither ghrelin-knockout (KO) nor GHSR-null mice exhibit obvious phenotypes under normal conditions, clear phenotypes emerge when exposed to high-fat diet early (less food intake, weight gain, and adiposity) or upon severe caloric restriction (hypoglycemia and increased mortality) [12,13]. In contrast, LEAP2 is a GHSR antagonist that potently blocks ghrelin action and decreases constitutive GHSR activity; it is primarily secreted from the liver and intestine [14,15]. Plasma LEAP2 changes inversely to ghrelin during fasting, obesity, and after meals [4,15]. LEAP2 and/or LEAP2 analogs reduce food intake, binge eating, and body weight and block ghrelin-induced food intake [16].\n\nLEAP2-KO mice exhibited greater acute food intake, c-fos induction in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus and olfactory bulbs, and GH secretion in response to administered ghrelin [4]. This suggests that plasma LEAP2 usually contributes to a state of ghrelin resistance, which is prominent in the setting of diet-induced obesity, and that lowering plasma LEAP2 and in turn, the plasma LEAP2:ghrelin molar ratio, enhances ghrelin sensitivity [4]. Female LEAP2-KO mice fed a Western-style 42% high-fat diet exhibited lower energy expenditure and locomotor activity but higher food intake, leading to a greater body weight gain, lean mass, and body length [4]. Also, lowering plasma LEAP2 in aged C57BL/6N mice to levels similar to those in younger mice using a lentiviral shRNA approach, improved cognitive performance and mitigated several age-related hippocampal deficiencies, including declines in neurogenesis and neuroinflammation [5].\n\nAs it relates to MAFLD, after 18–20 weeks of ad lib exposure to a Western-style, 42% high-fat diet (HFD), female LEAP2-KO mice exhibited significantly more % hepatic fat (29%) than wild-type littermates (20%) [4]. Although there was not an overall genotype-dependent difference in lipid droplet number, livers from LEAP2-KO mice contained marked increases in the numbers of lipid droplets sized >15,000 μm2 as compared to wild-type mice (271% and 1,464% increases in numbers of lipid droplets sized 15,000–30,000 μm2 and those sized >30,000 μm2, respectively) [4]. Although these overall findings are opposite those of Ma et al., in which knockdown of Leap2 expression via lentivirus delivery of an shRNA-Leap2 construct in HFD-fed female mice reduced hepatic oil red O staining, hepatic triglyceride content, and the liver transaminases alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) [17], several other studies are in agreement. For instance, studies by Davies et al., Li et al., and Dallak showed that 1–2 weeks of ghrelin administration induced hepatic steatosis in lean rats, lean mice, and/or diet-induced obese mice [[18], [19], [20]]. In contrast, Zhang et al. showed that knockdown or inhibition of ghrelin-O-acyltransferase, the enzyme that acylates ghrelin and thus permits it to effectively interact with GHSR, decreased hepatic triglyceride content and oil red O staining in high-fat diet-fed mice [21]. Abegg et al. demonstrated substantial decreases in hepatic fat content in diet-induced obese mice after administration of synthetic GHSR inverse agonist for 10 days [22]. In Li et al., administration of a synthetic GHSR antagonist for 1 wk markedly reduced hepatic triglyceride content, oil red O staining, and expression of several genes related to hepatic lipogenesis in diet-induced obese mice [20]. Li et al. also demonstrated reduced hepatic oil red O staining and triglyceride content in high-fat diet-fed GHSR-KO mice as compared to WT littermates [20]. Guillory et al. demonstrated that standard non-soy chow-fed ghrelin-KO mice aged 20 months-of-age had significantly less hepatic steatosis than age-matched wild-type mice [23]. Furthermore, 6 d of continuous s.c. LEAP2 administration to calorically-restricted mice reduced liver weights, although reduced liver weight was not observed when the same paradigm was repeated in ad lib-fed mice or in mice with arcuate hypothalamic nucleus LEAP2 overexpression for 12 wks as a result of AAV-LEAP2 [24,25]. Altogether, the preponderance of these studies, alongside the previously-reported robust associations of intrahepatocellular lipid measures and liver fibrosis with plasma ghrelin and LEAP2 in human subjects [15,17,26], suggests that reducing GHSR signaling mitigates development of hepatic steatosis and potentially liver fibrosis in obesogenic conditions, whereas enhancing GHSR signaling via ghrelin administration or LEAP2 deletion has the opposite effect, at least in certain settings.\n\nIn order to further clarify the link between LEAP2 and MAFLD using preclinical mouse models, we turned to the Gubra-Amylin-NASH diet [GAN diet; D09100310, Research Diets] [27]. This diet provides 4.49 kcal/g, consists of 40% kcal from fat (with 46% saturated fatty acids by weight), 22% fructose by weight, 10% sucrose by weight, and 2% cholesterol by weight [27]. While standard high-fat diets, such as the Western-style 42% high-fat diet that we used previously, often only produce hepatic steatosis, long-term exposure to a GAN diet induces other features of MAFLD, including ballooning, inflammation, and fibrosis [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. Here we examined the effects of both LEAP2 deletion and administration of a long-acting LEAP2 analog (LA-LEAP2) on the development of MAFLD in mice fed GAN diet, predicting that LEAP2 deletion would exaggerate MAFLD while LA-LEAP2 would reverse MAFLD. We included both female and male mice and both “short-term” (10 wks; Groups 1 and 2) and “long-term” (40 wks; Groups 3 and 4) exposures to the GAN diet. The “short-term” studies in males (Group 2) were extended an extra 4 wks, during which mice were randomized to receive LA-LEAP2 vs. vehicle. The “long-term” studies in females (Group 4) were extended an extra 10 d, during which mice were randomized to receive LA-LEAP2 vs. vehicle; we were unable to replicate the 4 wk treatment period used in Group 2 for reasons described below.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Animals\n\nMice were housed at 21.5°C-22.5 °C in ventilated cages with a 12-hr light/dark cycle, and free access to water. They had ad libitum access to standard chow (2916, Teklad Global 16% Protein Rodent Diet, Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) until 4 wks-of-age. Afterwards, they were individually housed and provided ad libitum access to GAN diet (except as noted). LEAP2-KO mice [4] (which carry two copies of the LEAP2-KO allele) and wild-type littermates were on a C57BL/6N background and resulted from crosses of mice heterozygous for the LEAP2-KO allele. Only mice from litters with 3–9 mice were included in these studies. Mice were weaned at 3 wks-of-age. The UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or the IACUC of the University of Cincinnati approved all experiments.\n\n2.2. LA-LEAP2 synthesis and pharmacokinetics\n\nThe long-acting LEAP2 analog (LA-LEAP2) was produced at Novo Nordisk by solid phase peptide synthesis using a Symphony X instrument (Gyros Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ. LA-LEAP2 is a truncated peptide analog of LEAP2 modified with a fatty acid, with a molecular weight = 2,137 Da. The inverse agonistic potency of LA-LEAP2 at GHSR was measured after a 45-minute treatment of BHK cells stably expressing human GHSR (hGHSR) using the Cisbio IP-One Gq HTRF kit (62IPAPEB; Revvity Waltham, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. IP-One levels using this in vitro system were compared to those of ghrelin and LEAP2, both of which were manufactured at Novo Nordisk. Each dose was tested in duplicate, on two separate occasions (n = 4 for each concentration for each drug). The pharmacokinetics of LA-LEAP2 were evaluated in 4 month-old male C57BL/6J mice. The mice (n = 8) received a single s.c. injection containing 2 μmol/kg BW of LA-LEAP2 and were split into two subgroups to collect blood samples into EDTA-containing tubes at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h post-injection (one subgroup was sampled at 0.5, 2, 8, and 48 h timepoints while the 2nd subgroup was sampled at 1, 4, 24, and 72 h timepoints). After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. The plasma concentration of LA-LEAP2 was determined by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) multiple reaction monitoring method. The chromatography was performed on a Thermo Scientific Vanquish Horizon UPLC system (San Jose, CA, USA using a Thermo Scientific Hypersil Gold Vanquish C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.9 μm) with a gradient elution of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min coupled to a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantis system (Bremen, Germany) with electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. The half-life of LA-LEAP2 was determined by non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.1 (Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA).\n\n2.3. Effect of LA-LEAP2 analog on ghrelin-induced food intake\n\nMale C57BL/6N mice, aged 8-10 wks-of-age, fed a standard chow diet were handled for 3 days before being randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) Saline-Saline, 2) Saline-Ghrelin, 3) LA-LEAP2-Ghrelin, and 4) LEAP2-Ghrelin, whereby s.c. administration of the compound listed first (either Saline, LA-LEAP2, or LEAP2) preceded s.c. administration of the second compound (either Saline or Ghrelin), after which food intake was assessed over the next 6 h. Given their known half-lives, LA-LEAP2 was administered 3 h prior to Ghrelin whereas native LEAP2 was administered 10 min prior to Ghrelin. The dose of LA-LEAP2 (2 μmol/kg BW; equivalent of 4.27 mg/kg BW) was the same dose as used in the other physiological studies in this report, and was chosen based on its IC50 relative to that of native LEAP2, as determined in the above pharmacokinetics studies. The dose of LEAP2 (2 μmol/kg BW; equivalent of 9.16 mg/kg BW) was selected based on prior reports in [14,31] showing efficacy for 3 μmol/kg BW to block ghrelin-induced food intake and 72 nmol/kg BW to reduce blood glucose. The dose of Ghrelin used (2 mg/kg BW; equivalent of 0.6 μmol/kg BW) has previously been shown to robustly induce food intake after an acute injection [32]. Of note, food was withdrawn at 7 AM (1 h after lights-on). At 8 AM, mice were injected with either Saline (5 μL/g, s.c. in the first and second treatment groups) or LA-LEAP2 (in the third treatment group). Two hrs and 50 min later, the fourth treatment group received LEAP2. Ten min after LEAP2 (which corresponded to 3 h after Saline or LA-LEAP2), mice were injected with saline (5 μL/g BW, first treatment group) or Ghrelin (second, third, and fourth treatment groups). Food was added back to the cages and consumption was measured over the next 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. A schematic of this protocol is included as C.\n\n2.4. “Short-term” GAN exposure studies\n\nFemale and male LEAP2-KO and wild-type littermates were provided ad lib access to GAN diet for 10 wks from 4 to 14 wks-of-age. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. In females (Group 1), body composition was determined using an EchoMRI-100 apparatus (EchoMRI LLC, Houston, TX, USA) and MR imaging was performed (to measure hepatic fat) by the UT Southwestern Pre-Clinical MRI Research Core with a 7T pre-clinical scanner (72 mm-volume transmitter/receiver coil, Bruker Biospec, Germany) at 14 wks-of-age, as previously described [33]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1.5%–2.5% isoflurane and were maintained at an ambient temperature of 28 °C during the procedure using an MR Compatible Small Rodent Air Heater System (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). Whole-body MR spectroscopy was acquired using a single pulse sequence with no voxel selection using the following parameters: sweep width of 25 kHz, matrix size 2048, repetition time (TR) 5000, averages 32. Spectra were analyzed using in-house-developed software in MATLAB (R2022a, MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts). A phase and baseline correction was performed on the spectra after the Fourier transformation of the free induction decay signal. Areas under the lipid (AUClipid) and water (AUCH2O) peaks were calculated within a fixed frequency window, and these, in turn, were used to calculate percentage fat mass and percentage lean mass, as in 34. Specifically, the formulas used were as follows: % fat mass = 100(AUClipid)/[1.38(AUCH2O) + AUClipid] and % lean mass = 100(0.38)(AUCH2O)/[1.38(AUCH2O) + AUClipid]. At the end of treatment period, mice were sacrificed by decapitation and blood was collected to measure ad lib-fed plasma growth hormone (GH), IGF-1, ghrelin, and LEAP2 levels.\n\nIn males (Group 2), following the initial 10 wks ad lib access to GAN diet, mice were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: Vehicle and LA-LEAP2, and they were continued with ad lib access to GAN diet. Daily between 8 and 10 AM (2–4 h after lights-on), LA-LEAP2 (2 μmol/kg BW s.c.) or vehicle (2 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 0.05% Tween-80; 6.67 μL/g BW s.c.) was administered for 28 d. Body weight and food intake were measured daily prior to each injection. At the end of treatment period, mice were sacrificed by decapitation and blood was collected to measure hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST), total cholesterol, triglycerides, growth hormone, IGF-1, ghrelin, and LEAP2. Whole livers were weighed and processed further as described below.\n\n2.5. “Long-term” GAN exposure studies\n\nFemale and male LEAP2-KO and wild-type littermate mice provided ad lib access to GAN diet for 40 wks from 4 to 44 wks-of-age. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. In males (Group 3), body composition was determined monthly using an EchoMRI-100 apparatus. MR imaging was performed (to measure hepatic fat), as above, at 44 wks-of-age. At the end of treatment period, mice were sacrificed by decapitation and blood was collected in the ad lib-fed state.\n\nIn females (Group 4), following the initial 40 wks ad lib access to GAN diet, mice were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: Vehicle and LA-LEAP2, and they were continued with ad lib access to GAN diet. Daily between 8 and 10 AM, LA-LEAP2 (2 μmol/kg BW s.c.) or vehicle was administered for 10 d. Although the original intent was to administer LA-LEAP2 vs. vehicle for 4 wks, similar to the Group 2 mice, the unexpected development of skin infections in several of the mice at the injection sites led us to shorten the treatment period to 10 d (see below). Body weight was measured daily prior to each injection. At the end of treatment period, mice were sacrificed by decapitation and blood was collected to measure hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST), total cholesterol, triglycerides, growth hormone, IGF-1, ghrelin, and LEAP2. Whole livers were weighed and processed further as described below. Notably, over the 40 wks +10 d of this study, 5 of 14 LEAP2-KO mice and 5 of 14 wild-type mice that began the study died or required euthanasia, presumably from complications related to prolonged GAN diet exposure (e.g. obesity or MAFLD) coupled in some instances to complications related to the administration of LA-LEAP2 or vehicle (see below). As such, end-of-study sample sizes were smaller than originally intended.\n\n2.6. Histology\n\nA portion of the left side of the liver was collected, submerged in 10% formalin solution at 4 °C for 2–4 d according to standard procedures [35,36]. Subsequent paraffin processing and embedding were carried out at the UT Southwestern Histo Pathology Core on a Thermo Excelsior Tissue Processor and Sakura TEC6 Embedding Center. Liver samples were processed with vacuum assist beginning in their 70% ethanol submitting solution through 6 graded ethanols, 3 exchanges of xylene, and 3 exchanges of molten paraffin over the span of 6 h. Serial 5 μm sections (each separated by at least 100 μm) were cut on a Leica RM2255 rotary microtome. Resulting sections were stained for routine histopathologic evaluation by regressive H&E on a Sakura Prisma Plus x-y-z robotic-stainer using Leica Selectech reagents (Hematoxylin 560 and Alcoholic Eosin Y 515). Liver fibrosis was highlighted in serial companion sections by Picro-Sirius Red staining performed manually according to established protocols [[35], [36], [37]]. In brief, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, run to water and color was imparted to collagen depositions by incubating sections in a solution of 0.01% Sirius-Red in saturated aqueous picric acid for 60 min at room temperature followed by two rapid differentiation acidified water washes (0.5% acetic acid/H2O). Sections were then rapidly dehydrated in 100% ethanol, cleared in xylenes, and mounted with synthetic media. Images of the stained sections were taken using the 10 × objective of a Leica DM6 B digital research microscope (Leica Microsystems Gmbh, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Leica DFC 9000 GT digital microscopy camera and LAS X software. Three-four sections, each separated by at least 100 μm, was analyzed from each liver sample. A clinical Pathologist who specializes in liver pathology scored severity of macrovesicular steatosis (defined as fat vacuoles displacing nucleus to the side), microvesicular steatosis (defined as fat vacuoles not displacing nucleus to the side), lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis in a blinded manner. Presence or absence of debris-laden macrophages and of Mallory-Denk bodies were determined in a blinded manner. Macrovesicular steatosis and microvesicular steatosis were graded based on the % of the total area affected, and severity scores were also assigned corresponding to severity (0: <5%, 1: 5–33%, 2: 34–66%, 3: >66%). Lobular inflammation was graded based on the number of inflammatory foci per field (counted at 100X magnification), and severity scores were also assigned corresponding to severity (0: <0.5, 1: 0.5–1.0, 2: 1.0–2.0, 3: >2.0). Hepatic fibrosis was graded as follows: 1a: mild, 1b: slightly more, 2: progression to portal fibrosis, 3: bridging fibrosis (equivalent to advanced fibrosis in humans), 4: cirrhosis. NASH activity score was determined by adding together the severity scores determined for macrovesicular steatosis, microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning, using a method modified from [38]; the modification consisted of incorporating hepatocellular ballooning scores instead of hepatocellular hypertrophy scores.\n\n2.7. Analyte and hormone assays\n\nBlood was collected into 3 mL ice-cold EDTA-coated vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and aliquoted into microfuge tubes containing either the protease inhibitors p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (Sigma Aldrich; final concentration 1 mM; used for ghrelin measurement) or aprotinin (Sigma Aldrich; final concentration 250 KIU/mL; used for LEAP2 measurement) or lacking protease inhibitor (used for GH, IGF-1, liver enzymes, total cholesterol, and triglycerides). The samples were immediately centrifuged at 4 °C at 1,500 g for 15 min. To stabilize the acyl-group on ghrelin, 1N hydrochloric acid was added to the p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid-treated plasma to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 N. Processed samples were stored at −80 °C in small aliquots until further analysis of plasma hormone levels. ELISA kits were used for acyl-ghrelin (#EZRGRA-90K; Millipore-Merck, MA), GH (#EZRMGH-45K; Millipore-Merck), IGF-1 (#80574; Crystal Chem, IL), and LEAP2 [#EK-075-40; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CA]. Colorimetric assays were performed using a BioTek PowerWave XS Microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT) using BioTek KC4 junior software. Measurements of plasma AST, ALT, total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured with a VITROS analyzer (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) in the UT Southwestern Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Core.\n\n2.8. Hepatic triglyceride levels\n\nThe right lobe of each liver was quickly frozen in pre-weighed microfuge tubes placed in dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Lipid extraction was performed by the UT Southwestern Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Core. After extraction, triglyceride content was measured using Infinity™ Triglycerides Liquid Stable Reagent assay (#TR22421; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Middletown, VA).\n\n2.9. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR\n\nPortions of the left lobe of the liver of Group 2 mice were collected into RNAlater (Invitrogen), stored at 4 °C overnight or up to 1 wk, after which RNAlater was removed and the tissues either immediately processed to isolate RNA or frozen at −20 °C until processing at a later date. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method by addition of RNA STAT-60 (AMSBIO, Cambridge, MA). The isolated RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Total RNA was treated with ribonuclease-free deoxyribonuclease (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and complementary DNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using the QuantSTUDIO 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems by ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA). The following TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primers were used to detect TNF-α (Mm00443258_m1), IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1), MCP-1 (Mm00441242_m1), ACC1 (Mm01304258_m1), FASN (Mm00662319_m1), SREBP1c (Mm00550338_m1), ColA1 (Mm00801666_g1), and TIMP1 (Mm01341361_m1) using Taqman technology. The mRNA levels are normalized to the invariant control gene, 18s (Mm04277571_s1), and were calculated by the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt) method. Data are presented relative to the expression of the gene in livers of the vehicle-treated wild-type mice.\n\n2.10. Statistical analysis and graph preparations\n\nThe statistical analysis and graph preparations were performed using GraphPad Prism 10.2.0 as indicated in the figure legends. Post-hoc analyses were performed as indicated in the figure legends. Outliers were detected using the ROUT test. Data with significant unequal variance as determined by an “F test” (to compare variances for datasets containing two groups) or a “Spearman's test for heteroscedasticity” (a test for homogeneity of variances for datasets including more than two groups, e.g. those analyzed by two-way ANOVA) were log-transformed prior to performing further analyses. The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to test the normality of data. For datasets analyzed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA, the “Geisser-Greenhouse epsilon test” was used instead to correct unequal variances. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Values of 0.05 ≤ P < 0.1 were considered to be evidence of a statistical trend; for full transparency, we include the actual P values in the “statistical trend” range in the graphs and in the text so that the readers can determine for themselves the significance of the findings. We specifically avoid using the term “significant” to characterize data in which the P-values fall within the 0.05 ≤ P < 0.1 range. Further, we reserved post-hoc statistical testing of 2-WAY ANOVA analyses to those datasets in which a significant interaction between the two factors was observed.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Validation of the long-acting LEAP2 analog (LA-LEAP2)\n\nA novel peptide analog of LEAP2 was generated at Novo Nordisk. It is derived from the N-terminal sequence of the native hormone and protracted by lipid to improve its pharmacokinetic properties. The half-life of s.c. administered LA-LEAP2 in the plasma of C57BL/6J mice was 5.19 h ( A and Supplementary Table 1). This is an improvement over LEAP2, which due to rapid proteolytic degradation, has a half-life in plasma of approximately 10–15 min in mice and 9.1 ± 2.5 min in humans [14,39,40]. Given the much longer half-life of the novel analog vs. LEAP2, we refer to it as LA (long-acting)-LEAP2. Next, we compared the effects of LA-LEAP2 on GHSR signaling to those of LEAP2 and ghrelin using an in vitro cell-based system and the IP-One assay. Specifically, BHK cells stably transfected with hGHSR were exposed to different concentrations of ghrelin, LEAP2, and LA-LEAP2 to determine their effects on GHSR activity, as measured by Gq-mediated accumulation of intracellular inositol monophosphate (IP-One, which is a breakdown product of the less stable IP3). Whereas ghrelin dose-dependently increased IP-one accumulation (with an EC50 = 1.15 nM), LEAP2 dose-dependently reduced IP-one accumulation (with an IC50 = 22.6 nM), reflecting ghrelin's and LEAP2's known actions as a GHSR agonist and inverse agonist, respectively [15,41]. LA-LEAP2 was slightly more potent than native LEAP2 at reducing GHSR constitutive activity with its IC50 = 9.4 nM ( B).\n\nTo confirm that LA-LEAP2 works in vivo to block ghrelin action and to compare its efficacy with native LEAP2, 8-10 wk-old male C57BL/6N mice maintained on a standard chow diet were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) Saline-Saline, 2) Saline-Ghrelin, 3) LA-LEAP2-Ghrelin, and 4) LEAP2-Ghrelin, whereby s.c. administration of the compound listed first preceded s.c. administration of the second compound, after which food intake was assessed over the next 6 h ( C). Ghrelin administration significantly increased food intake at 1 h (by ∼175%) and at 2 h (by ∼86%) compared to saline administration ( D–E). Pre-treatment with LA-LEAP2 and native LEAP2 both markedly blunted ghrelin-induced food intake, to a similar degree: LA-LEAP2 and LEAP2 limited ghrelin-induced food intake at 1 h (by ∼57% and ∼142%, respectively) and at 2 h (by ∼56% and ∼125%, respectively) ( D–E). There were no significant differences noted for LA-LEAP2 vs. LEAP2 nor was the food intake observed in the LA-LEAP2-Ghrelin and LEAP2-Ghrelin groups significantly different from the Saline-Saline group ( D–E). Ghrelin's effects to induce food intake were no longer apparent at 4 h or 6 h ( F–G).\n\n3.2. Effects of LEAP2 deletion and LA-LEAP2 treatment in mice with “short-term” exposure to Gubra-Amylin-NASH diet\n\nIn the first set of MAFLD studies, female (Group 1) and male (Group 2) LEAP2-KO and wild-type littermates were provided ad lib-access to a Gubra-Amylin-NASH diet (GAN diet) for 10 wks starting at 4 wks-of-age. The males were continued on the GAN diet for another 4 wks during which time they were randomized to receive daily administration of LA-LEAP2 vs. Vehicle. Schematic diagrams of the experimental protocols for the Groups 1 and 2 mice are included in Figs. S1A and S1B.\n\nIn female mice (Group 1), there was no effect of genotype on weekly body weight over time, weekly food intake over time, or cumulative food intake ( A–C). Final fat mass and % fat mass were 34.2% lower (P = 0.056) and 27.2% lower (P = 0.064), respectively while final lean mass and % lean mass were not different in LEAP2-KO mice compared to wild-type littermates ( D–G). Final liver weight was genotype-independent although liver weight normalized to body weight was 12.5% higher in LEAP2-KO mice ( H–I). Hepatic fat, hepatic fat normalized to body weight, hepatic fat normalized to liver weight, and hepatic triglycerides were all genotype-independent ( J–M). Determinations of final plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate transaminase) revealed all were genotype-independent except triglycerides, which was 20% lower (P = 0.087) ( N–Q). Photomicrographs of H&E stained liver sections from representative WT and LEAP2-KO mice after 10 wks of GAN exposure appear in R. Blinded analyses of the H&E-stained and Picro-Sirius Red-stained liver sections demonstrated genotype-independent amounts of macrovesicular steatosis, microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and NASH activity scores ( S–V). Portal fibrosis (Grade 3) was present in 17% of LEAP2-KO mice whereas all others, and all WT mice had mild fibrosis (Grade 1a) ( A). Debris-laden macrophages were absent from WT mice but present in 17% of LEAP2-KO mice ( B). Mallory-Denk bodies, which are cytoplasmic hyaline inclusions of hepatocytes, and are present in several types of liver diseases, were absent ( C) [42]. Plasma GH, IGF-1, and ghrelin were genotype-independent ( W-Y). Plasma LEAP2 was significantly lower in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type littermates ( Z). Notably, as discussed previously [4], the low levels of plasma LEAP2 detected in LEAP2-KO mice are presumably a consequence of cross-reactivity of the anti-LEAP2 antibody in this ELISA kit with a non-LEAP2-like signal present at low levels in plasma (that otherwise is not regulated by diet or feeding status).\n\nIn male mice (Group 2), there was no effect of genotype on weekly body weight over time, weekly food intake, or cumulative food intake for the first 10 wks of GAN diet exposure ( A–C). During the subsequent 4 wk treatment period, LA-LEAP2 reduced body weights on average by 9.36% and 7.43% in wild-type mice and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively, by the last treatment day; in contrast, although in the first several days of vehicle injections mice experienced a slight weight reduction, those body weights recovered such that by the end of the treatment period, the body weights of vehicle-treated wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice were slightly higher than at the start of the treatment period ( D). The reductions in body weight resulting from LA-LEAP2 were not an effect of reduced food intake ( E). Instead, a finding of decreased cumulative feed efficiency in the LA-LEAP2 treatment groups (by 331.8% and 201.4% in wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively) suggests increased energy expenditure ( F). Although final liver weight, liver weight normalized to body weight, and hepatic triglycerides were genotype-independent, there was an effect of LA-LEAP2 treatment to lower liver weight (by 6.5% and 19.5% in in wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively; P = 0.083) and hepatic triglycerides (by 44.3% and 45.7% in wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively) ( G–I). Plasma total cholesterol was lowered by both LEAP2 deletion (10.5–10.7%) and by LA-LEAP2 treatment (22.5–22.7%) ( J). Plasma triglycerides were independent of genotype or treatment ( K). LEAP2 deletion did not alter plasma ALT. Notably, LA-LEAP2 treatment significantly reduced plasma ALT levels (by 46.0–67.6%) ( L). AST was independent of genotype or treatment ( M). Photomicrographs of H&E stained liver sections from representative wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice after the 4 wk treatment period appear in N. Blinded analyses of the H&E-stained and Picro-Sirius Red-stained liver sections demonstrated genotype- and treatment-independent amounts of macrovesicular steatosis ( O). LA-LEAP2 treatment lowered microvesicular steatosis (by 52.2% and 74.1% in wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively), lobular inflammation (by 50.0% and 69.7% in wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively) and NASH activity score (by 18.5% and 42.8% in wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively) ( P–R). NASH activity score was also reduced by LEAP2 deletion (by 2.7–31.8%), and there also was a treatment x genotype effect on NASH activity score (P = 0.086) such that the magnitude of LA-LEAP2's effect to reduce activity score was greater in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type mice ( R). Grade 3 fibrosis was present in 17% vehicle-treated WT mice, Grade 1b fibrosis was present in 20% of vehicle-treated LEAP2-KO mice, whereas only mild (Grade 1a) fibrosis was present in LA-LEAP2-treated mice ( D). Percentages of mice with debris-laden macrophages were as follows: 17%, vehicle-treated WT; 0%, vehicle-treated LEAP2-KO; 33%, LA-LEAP2-treated WT; 30%, LA-LEAP2-treated LEAP2-KO ( E). Mallory-Denk bodies were absent ( F). Plasma GH, IGF-1, and ghrelin were genotype- and treatment-independent ( S–U). Plasma LEAP2 was significantly lower in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type mice, and moreover, LA-LEAP2 was not detected by the LEAP2 ELISA kit ( V).\n\nIncreased de novo lipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis are the hallmark features of MAFLD [[43], [44], [45]]. To investigate the status of these cellular process in the GAN diet-fed vehicle or LA-LEAP2 treated mice, we performed quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in the liver samples from Group 2 mice for genes associated with inflammation [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)], genes associated with lipogenesis [acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c)], and genes associated with fibrosis [collagen alpha-1(I) chain (ColA1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1)]. Although neither genotype nor treatment impacted expression of TNF-α, ACC1, FASN, SREBP1c, ColA1, or TIMP1, and although genotype did not affect IL-6 expression. Several previous studies has demonstrated that increased levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 are associated with increased hepatic inflammation and steatohepatitis [[46], [47], [48], [49]]. Importantly, there was an effect of LA-LEAP2 to reduce expression of both IL-6 [by 39.2–40.4%; (P = 0.066)] and MCP-1 [by 46.5–49.4%; P = 0.021)] ( A–H). Also, LEAP2 deletion reduced MCP-1 expression (by 49.7–52.4%) ( C).\n\n3.3. Effects of LEAP2 deletion and LA-LEAP2 treatment in mice with “long-term” exposure to GAN diet\n\nIn the second set of MAFLD studies, male (Group 3) and female (Group 4) LEAP2-KO and wild-type littermates were fed GAN diet for 40 wks starting at 4 wks-of-age. The females were continued on the GAN diet for another 10 d during which time they were randomized to receive daily administration of LA-LEAP2 vs. Vehicle. Schematic diagrams of the experimental protocols for the Groups 3 and 4 mice are included in Figs. S1C and S1D.\n\nNotably, although our original intent was to administer LA-LEAP2 vs. vehicle for 4 wks to Group 4 (similar to the treatment duration in Group 2), 85% (11 of 13) of mice receiving LA-LEAP2 and 11% (1 of 7) of mice receiving Vehicle developed ulcerative dermatitis skin lesions at the s.c. injection sites. These lesions, which became noticeable on average by the 4th injection day, were characterized by excoriations and/or crusting ≤2 mm, at the injection site (interscapular region). Without treatment, the skin lesions enlarged in size over the next few days, necessitating euthanasia as per our animal protocol and exclusion from data analysis. Once we determined that application of topical 1% silver sulfadiazine cream (Ascend Laboratories LLC, Parsippany, NJ) prevented enlargement of the ulcerative dermatitis lesions, we switched from a 4 wk treatment protocol to a 10 d protocol. However, as the occurrence of ulcerative dermatitis was unexpected, prior to determining that silver sulfadiazine was helpful, 2 mice had to be euthanized prior to completing the 10 d treatment period. Of the mice that completed the 10 d treatment schedule, 10 of 18 developed mild to moderate ulcerative dermatitis lesions requiring silver sulfadiazine. These ulcerative dermatitis lesions did not develop in the younger, Group 2 mice which received daily s.c. LA-LEAP2 vs. Vehicle injections for 28 d.\n\nIn male mice (Group 3), there was an effect of LEAP2 deletion to raise weekly body weight over time (by 10% after 40 wks; P = 0.053), weekly food intake (by 5.2% on average; P = 0.073), and cumulative food intake (by 6% after 40 wks) ( A–C). Monthly fat mass over time and monthly % fat mass over time were not different, monthly lean mass over time was higher (5.7% higher after 40 wks), while monthly % lean mass was not different in LEAP2-KO mice compared to wild-type littermates ( D–G). Final liver weight was higher in LEAP2-KO mice (by 13.4%; P = 0.078), but final liver weight normalized to body weight was genotype-independent ( H–I). Neither hepatic fat, hepatic fat normalized to body weight, hepatic fat normalized to liver weight, nor hepatic triglycerides differed by genotype ( J–M). Final plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT, and AST were all genotype-independent ( N–Q). Photomicrographs of H&E stained liver sections from representative wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice after 41.5 wks of GAN diet exposure appear in R. Blinded analyses of the H&E-stained and Picro-Sirius Red-stained liver sections demonstrated genotype-independent amounts of macrovesicular steatosis, microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and NASH activity scores ( S–V). Grade 2 fibrosis, Grade 1b fibrosis, and Grade 1a fibrosis were present in 50%, 33%, and 17% of WT mice, respectively, whereas Grade 1b fibrosis and Grade 1a fibrosis were present in 83% and 17% of LEAP2-KO mice, respectively ( G). Debris-laden macrophages were present in 17% WT mice and in 33% of LEAP2-KO mice ( H). Mallory-Denk bodies were present in 17% of WT mice and 0% of LEAP2-KO mice ( I). Plasma GH, IGF-1, and ghrelin were genotype-independent ( W-Y). Plasma LEAP2 was significantly lower in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type littermates ( Z). Similar to findings of higher plasma LEAP2 with longer exposure to 42% high-fat diet [15], plasma LEAP2 ( Z) and plasma LEAP2:ghrelin molar ratio (45.5 ± 13.3) in male wild-type mice treated with GAN diet for 41.5 weeks were significantly higher (by 358% and 310%, respectively) than plasma LEAP2 ( V) and plasma LEAP2:ghrelin molar ratio (11.1 ± 2.8) in male wild-type treated with GAN diet for 14 wks (which includes 4 wks of vehicle administration).\n\nIn female mice (Group 4), there was no effect of genotype on weekly body weight over time, weekly food intake, or cumulative food intake for the first 40 wks of GAN diet exposure ( A–C). Also, monthly fat mass, % fat mass, lean mass, and % lean mass were genotype-independent over the same period ( D–G). Yet, during the subsequent 10 d treatment period, LA-LEAP2 reduced body weights on average by 12.5% and 11.1% in wild-type mice and LEAP2-KO mice, respectively, by the end of the study; in contrast, the body weights of vehicle-treated wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice only changed minimally from the start of the treatment period ( H). There was an effect of LEAP2 deletion to raise final liver weight and liver weight normalized to body weight [by 12.4–29.9% (P = 0.060) and by 14.6–16.3% (P = 0.070), respectively) but not an effect of treatment ( I–J). There was no effect of genotype or treatment on hepatic triglycerides ( K). Final plasma total cholesterol was independent of genotype although it was lowered (31.4%) by LA-LEAP2 treatment in LEAP2-KO mice ( L). There also was a treatment x genotype effect on plasma total cholesterol such that the magnitude of LA-LEAP2's effect to reduce plasma total cholesterol was greater in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type mice ( L). Final plasma triglycerides were independent of genotype or treatment ( M). ALT was reduced by LA-LEAP2 treatment (by 6.4–47.4%) but was unaffected by genotype ( N). There also was a treatment x genotype effect on ALT such that the magnitude of LA-LEAP2's effect to reduce ALT was greater in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type mice (P = 0.059) ( N). AST was independent of genotype or treatment ( O). Photomicrographs of H&E stained liver sections from representative wild-type and LEAP2-KO mice after the 10-day treatment period appear in P. Blinded analyses of the H&E-stained and Picro-Sirius Red-stained liver sections demonstrated genotype-independent amounts of macrovesicular steatosis, microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and NASH activity score ( Q–T). Yet, LA-LEAP2 raised macrovesicular steatosis (by 83.3–96.3%), without effects on microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, or NASH activity score ( Q–T). Grade 1b fibrosis was present in 17% of vehicle-treated WT mice but 67% of vehicle-treated LEAP2-KO mice; Grade 1b fibrosis was present in 20% of LA-LEAP2-treated WT mice but 0% of LA-LEAP2-treated LEAP2-KO mice ( J). Percentages of mice with debris-laden macrophages were as follows: 50%, vehicle-treated WT; 67%, vehicle-treated LEAP2-KO; 20%, LA-LEAP2-treated WT; 0%, LA-LEAP2-treated LEAP2-KO ( K). Mallory-Denk bodies were absent ( L). There was an effect of LEAP2 deletion to lower plasma GH (by 24.7–81.8%) ( U). Plasma IGF-1 and ghrelin were genotype- and treatment-independent ( V-W). Plasma LEAP2 was significantly lower in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type mice and was unaffected by LA-LEAP2 treatment ( X).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study determined the metabolic effects of genetic LEAP2 deletion and administration of a long-acting LEAP2 analog (LA-LEAP2) in mice treated with the Gubra-Amylin-NASH (GAN) diet. Group 1 included females fed GAN diet for 10 wks, Group 2 included males fed GAN diet for 14 wks with LA-LEAP2 or vehicle during the last 4 wks. Group 3 included males fed GAN diet for 40 wks, and Group 4 included females fed GAN diet for 41.5 wks with LA-LEAP2 or vehicle during the last 10 d.\n\nLEAP2 deletion was associated with higher body weight (Group 3), higher weekly food intake (Group 3; P = 0.073) and cumulative food intake (Group 3), higher lean mass (Group 3), higher liver weight (Group 3; P = 0.078 and Group 4; P = 0.060), higher liver weight normalized to body weight (Group 1 and Group 4; P = 0.070), and higher prevalence of more severe fibrosis (Groups 1 and 4). These results collectively support previous work describing increased body weight, food intake, and hepatic steatosis upon activation of GHSR signaling, whether through administration of ghrelin or ghrelin mimetics or reducing LEAP2 [4,[18], [19], [20]], and newly demonstrate increased prevalence of higher grade fibrosis. Juxtaposed with those effects, LEAP2 deletion was also associated with lower fat mass and % fat mass (Group 1; P = 0.06), lower NASH activity score (Group 2), decreased prevalence of higher grade fibrosis (Groups 2 and 3), lower plasma triglycerides (Group 1; P = 0.087), lower plasma total cholesterol (Group 2), lower hepatic expression of MCP-1 mRNA (Group 2), and lower plasma GH (Group 4).\n\nLA-LEAP2 treatment also was associated with several prominent changes. To emphasize the changes induced by LA-LEAP2 in the wild-type mice, we specify the magnitude of the changes in the wild-type mice here, and refer the reader back to the Results sections for the magnitude of the changes in LEAP2-KO mice. LA-LEAP2 reduced body weight (Groups 2 and 4; by 9.36% and 12.5% respectively), lowered cumulative feed efficiency (Group 2; by 331.8%), lowered liver weight (Group 2; by 6.5%), lowered hepatic triglycerides (Group 2; by 44.3%), lowered plasma total cholesterol (Groups 2; decreased by 22.5%), lowered plasma ALT (Groups 2 and 4; by 67.6% and 6.4%, respectively), lowered microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation and NASH activity score (Group 2; by 52.2%, 50.0%, and 18.5%, respectively), eliminated fibrosis grades higher than the most mild [Group 2 (WT and LEAP2-KO mice) and Group 4 (LEAP2-KO mice only)], and lowered hepatic expression of IL-6 mRNA (Group 2; by 39.2%; P = 0.066) and MCP-1 mRNA (Group 2; by 46.5%). These results collectively point to efficacy for the LA-LEAP2 compound in reducing body weight, improving circulating lipid indices, and preventing or reversing MAFLD. Juxtaposed with those effects, LA-LEAP2 treatment was associated with higher macrovesicular steatosis (Group 4).\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to further investigate the impact of LEAP2 in the development of MAFLD. As mentioned in the Introduction, over the years, the literature has supported actions of ghrelin to promote hepatic fat accumulation [[18], [19], [20]], while a small number of studies has suggested that LEAP2 has the opposite effect. For instance, we previously reported greater hepatic steatosis in female LEAP2-KO mice than in female wild-type littermates fed a 42% HFD for 18–20 wks [4], although we did not assess nor expect inflammation or fibrosis using that diet. In contrast, 6d of continuous s.c. LEAP2 infusion previously was shown to reduce liver weight and change liver expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β mRNAs were raised, Gdf15 mRNA was lower, while TNF-α and IL-10 were unaffected) in calorically-restricted mice but not in ad lib-fed mice [24]. Further, intrahepatocellular lipid measures and/or liver fibrosis are positively correlated with plasma LEAP2 and negatively correlated with plasma ghrelin and LEAP2 in human subjects [15,17,26]. Here, we specifically used the GAN diet to investigate not only hepatic steatosis but also markers of hepatic inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Notably, upon LA-LEAP2 administration, we observed marked improvements in several histologic and biochemical markers of MAFLD. These effects were greatest in the Group 2 animals which had been exposed to the GAN diet for 14 weeks with LA-LEAP2 during the final 4 wks. LA-LEAP2 for 4 wks lowered hepatic TG (by 44.3–45.7%), lowered microvesicular steatosis (by 52.2–74.1%), lobular inflammation (by 50.0–69.7%), and NASH activity score (by 18.5–42.8%). LA-LEAP2 also eliminated fibrosis grades higher than the most mild, which otherwise were present in a subset of vehicle-treated mice. These effects on improving NASH were supported by reductions in IL-6 mRNA and MCP-1 mRNA (by 39.2–40.4% and 46.5–49.4%, respectively). Also, serology showed improved ALT (lower by 46.0–67.6%) and total cholesterol (by 22.5–22.7%). Although many of those effects were not observed in the Group 4 animals which had been exposed to the GAN diet for a longer period (44 wks), this may have been the result of treatment with LA-LEAP2 for a shorter, 10-d period, which was necessitated by the unexpected occurrence of skin infections. Also, this may have been the result of lack of power in the study. Specifically, the unexpected development of serious site injection skin infections in some mice during the latter stages of the protocol left only n = 3–6 per cohort. Nonetheless, similar to its effect in Group 2 mice, LA-LEAP2 lowered ALT (by 6.4–47.4%) and total cholesterol (by 31.4% in LEAP2-KO mice) in Group 4 mice and eliminated the higher grade fibrosis otherwise present in the majority of Group 4 vehicle-treated LEAP2-KO mice.\n\nAnother prominent effect was that of LA-LEAP2 on body weight. The weight loss was significant and present in both the Group 2 male mice exposed to GAN diet for 14 wks with LA-LEAP2 administration during the final 4 wks and the Group 4 female mice exposed to GAN diet for 41.5 wks with LA-LEAP2 administration during the final 10 d. The weight loss achieved in the older wild-type mice treated for 10 d leveled off at ∼12.5% by about day 7, whereas weight loss achieved in the younger wild-type mice treated for 4-wks reached a nadir after about 2 wks, at which time it leveled off and then reversed slightly to a final reduction of 9.4% by 4 wks. The weight loss was not the result of anorexia, and instead was associated with decreased cumulative feed efficiency (body weight gained per calories consumed), suggesting increased energy expenditure.\n\nThis overall effect of LA-LEAP2 to reduce body weight could be viewed as either unexpected or expected depending on which sets of published data are cited. In the unexpected camp, some studies have reported that administration of LEAP2 or LEAP2 analogs do not impact food intake or body weight. For instance, in [16], daily LEAP2 analog administered subcutaneously for 4 d did not reduce binge-like eating in mice. Other studies have shown that single intracerebroventricular or intraperitoneal boluses of LEAP2 or LEAP2 analogs do not reduce food intake in ad lib-fed mice, dark-phase food intake in rats, food intake in mice with time-restricted feeding, or rebound food intake during fast-refeed protocols in rats or mice [24,41,50,51]. Nor have protocols employing a 3-d continuous subcutaneous infusion of truncated LEAP2 analog to food-deprived mice or 3.5 days of twice-daily intraperitoneal LEAP2 to ad lib-fed mice demonstrated any impact on body weight [24,52].\n\nHowever, an accumulating number of reports have shown reduced food intake and/or reduced body weight as a result of administration of LEAP2 or LEAP2 analogs. Specifically, studies in rodents have demonstrated that pre-treatment or co-administration of LEAP2, truncated LEAP2 analogs, or a fluorescent LEAP2 analog attenuate the acute orexigenic effects of administered ghrelin or of ghrelin mimetics [14,24,41,50,51,[53], [54], [55]]. Intravenous, subcutaneous, and intracerebroventricular LEAP2 boluses reduce baseline food intake in mice [14,25,40]. Subcutaneous and/or intracerebroventricular boluses of LEAP2 or truncated LEAP2 analogs reduce 5 h and 24 h standard chow intake and 24 h body weights in rats or mice and/or rebound food intake during fast-refeed protocols in diet-induced obese mice, ob/ob mice, lean mice, and lean rats [[53], [54], [55], [56]]. Also, in healthy, lean men, an ∼12% reduction in energy intake and a shorter meal duration have been observed during an ad libitum meal test performed following a 255 min intravenous infusion of LEAP2 [40]. The LEAP2 infusion did not, however, alter gastric emptying rate of a liquid mixed meal provided during the infusion, impact visual analog scale ratings of hunger, satiety, prospective food consumption, fullness, nausea, comfort, or thirst during the infusion, or alter resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, or supraclavicular skin temperature [40]. An additional 3 studies incorporating longer-term administration protocols also have shown effects of LEAP2 or LEAP2 analogs on food intake and body weight. For instance, in [16], daily intracerebroventricular administration of a truncated LEAP2 analog during a binge-like eating protocol, in which ad lib-fed mice were provided 2 h access to HFD for 4 days in a row, reduced cumulative high fat diet food intake. In [24], 6 d of continuous subcutaneous LEAP2 infusion in calorically-restricted mice reduced body weight (by ∼6%), although this change was absent when repeated in ad lib-fed mice. In [25], daily intracerebroventricular LEAP2 boluses for 10 d reduced food intake and reduced body weight (by ∼5%, whereas control mice gained ∼2% body weight over the same 10-d period). Also in [25], virally-mediated LEAP2 overexpression in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus of mice reduced daily food intake, body weight (by ∼16%), eWAT and iWAT mass, and eWAT adipocyte size in mice fed either a standard chow diet or a high fat diet for 12 wks. No significant effects on liver weight were noted. Virally-mediated LEAP2 overexpression also blunted food intake and body weight gains otherwise induced by chronic ghrelin administration [25]. Future work is needed to determine if the prominent weight-reducing effects of LA-LEAP2 reported here are separable from its effects to reverse MAFLD, as improvements in MAFLD are often observed with body weight-reducing treatments [30].\n\nThe rather prominent effect of LA-LEAP2 to reduce body weight reported here is also noteworthy given a recent study reporting resistance to the acute anorexigenic effects of administered truncated LEAP2 analog in diet-induced obese mice [56]. This report of resistance to the LEAP2 analog in the setting of diet-induced obesity was a first, although several previous studies have documented diet-induced obesity as a state of ghrelin resistance [57]. For instance, ghrelin fails to induce food intake in diet-induced obese mice whether acutely or chronically administered, its effect to reduce energy expenditure in mice is also abrogated, and its ability to stimulate GH release is attenuated in obese human subjects [[57], [58], [59], [60], [61]]. We have previously proposed and then demonstrated that this ghrelin resistance is the result at least in part of endogenous elevations in LEAP2 and a high plasma LEAP2:ghrelin molar ratio in the setting of diet-induced obesity, whereby the high endogenous LEAP2 prevents ghrelin from its full capacity to activate GHSR signaling [4,15]. We have also reported a wide range of plasma LEAP2:ghrelin molar ratios in humans with obesity, and have proposed that those with relatively lower ratios might be more amenable to weight loss strategies that include administration of LEAP2 analogs or increasing endogenous LEAP2 levels [7,15]. Here, despite higher plasma LEAP2:ghrelin molar ratios in the Group 4 mice (fed GAN diet for 41.5 wks) than in the Group 2 mice (fed GAN diet for 14 wks), and despite the recent paper describing resistance to the food intake-reducing effects of a truncated LEAP2 analog in diet-induced obese mice (mice fed high-fat diet for 4, 8, or 10 wks) [56], both the 4-wk treatment protocol in the younger, GAN diet-fed mice and the 10-d treatment protocol in the older, GAN diet-fed mice led to significant reductions in body weight (albeit, not food intake when assessed in Group 2). This would suggest that resistance to LEAP2, or at very least, to this long-acting analog of LEAP2, is not apparent in this particular paradigm.\n\nGiven the prominent expression of LEAP2 within the liver, it might have been expected that LA-LEAP2 would impact MAFLD. Yet, several studies have failed to detect GHSR in the liver [[62], [63], [64]], suggesting indirect effects. GHSR is highly expressed in the brain and the pituitary, and it is via those sites that the effects of LEAP2 and ghrelin on MAFLD possibly are mediated. As just one example ghrelin's effects on peripheral tissues to its central actions, chronic central ghrelin administration increases glucose utilization by white and brown adipose tissue, increases expression of several fat storage-promoting enzymes in white adipose tissue, and decreases expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue [65]. Additionally, in a mouse model of long-term calorie restriction/starvation, ghrelin is able to prevent life-threatening falls in blood glucose via stimulating pituitary release of GH, which in turn acts via GH receptor expressed by hepatocytes to induce hepatic autophagy, preserve triglycerides, and enhance gluconeogenesis [66,67]. Another potential site through which LEAP2 and ghrelin impact MAFLD includes macrophages. Selective deletion of GHSR from cells of myeloid lineage (including macrophages) results in reduced systemic inflammation and reduced insulin resistance in the setting of diet-induced obesity without affecting food intake or body weight. Further, livers from these mice with myeloid-selective GHSR deletion show reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration, reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory genes Tnf-alpha and IL-6, and reduced lipid accumulation [68].\n\nIt is also worthwhile to highlight the sex-dependent differences or lack thereof observed upon LEAP2 deletion and LA-LEAP2 treatment. We are best able to accomplish this for LEAP2 deletion. Specifically, during 10 wks of GAN diet exposure, no effect of genotype was observed in either females (Group 1) or males (Group 2) for weekly body weight, weekly food intake, or cumulative food intake. During 40 wks of GAN diet exposure in males (Group 3), LEAP2 deletion led to an upward deflection of the weekly body weight curve (P = 0.053), weekly food intake (P = 0.073), cumulative food intake, and the monthly lean mass curve (but not the monthly fat mass curve). Yet, there was no effect of genotype on weekly body weight, weekly food intake, cumulative food intake, monthly fat mass curves or monthly lean mass curves in females exposed to GAN diet for 40 wks (Group 4). In general, LA-LEAP2 treatment reduced body weights, plasma total cholesterol, and plasma ALT in both males (Group 2) and females (Group 4). Yet, LA-LEAP2 lowered cumulative feed efficiency, liver weight, hepatic triglycerides, microvesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, NASH activity score, and liver IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA expression and eliminated high-grade fibrosis scores from wild-type mice only in males (Group 2). It must be emphasized that these differential effects of LA-LEAP2 in males vs. females may have nothing to do with sex and everything to do with differential ages and differential duration of GAN diet exposure and LA-LEAP2 treatment, all of which differed in the male (Group 2) and female (Group 4) cohorts.\n\nWe cannot easily explain the lack of consistent and occasionally counterintuitive metabolic observations in the LEAP2-KO mice fed the GAN diet. On the one hand, prior studies with female LEAP2-KO mice had demonstrated that 18–20 wks exposure to a Western style 42% high-fat diet lowered energy expenditure and locomotor activity and raised food intake, leading to a greater body weight gain, lean mass, body length, and hepatic steatosis [4]. Those observations are aligned with the observations here of higher body weight, weekly food intake (P = 0.073), cumulative food intake, lean mass, and liver weight (P = 0.078) in the male LEAP2-KO mice fed GAN diet for 40 wks (Group 3). Yet, except for higher liver weight (P = 0.060), higher liver weight normalized to body weight (P = 0.070), and more severe fibrosis in female LEAP2-KO mice fed GAN diet for 41.5 wks (Group 4), and except for higher liver weight normalized to body weight and more severe fibrosis in the female LEAP2-KO mice fed GAN diet for 10 wks (Group 1), the observations described above for Group 3 were not duplicated in the other groups. Further, the lower plasma triglycerides (P = 0.087), fat mass (P = 0.056), and % fat mass (P = 0.064) in the Group 1 LEAP2-KO mice, the lower NASH activity score, plasma total cholesterol, and hepatic MCP-1 mRNA expression in Group 2 LEAP2-KO mice (males fed GAN diet for 14 wks), and the decreased higher grade fibrosis prevalence in Group 2 and Group 3 LEAP2-KO mice seem inconsistent with the observed increased body weight, hepatic steatosis, and higher grade fibrosis prevalence observed in the other LEAP2-KO groups. Nonetheless, in our previous report, although indications of reduced ghrelin resistance as a result of LEAP2 deletion were apparent upon ghrelin administration to both chow-fed and high-fat diet-fed male mice, the exaggerated weight gain, food intake, and hepatic steatosis phenotype of LEAP2-KO mice was restricted to females fed the 42% high-fat diet (and was not observed in males or in mice fed standard chow diet) [4]. Of interest, those LEAP2-KO mice for which a higher prevalence of more severe fibrosis was observed (Groups 1 and 4) were females. Clearly, further research is needed to clarify the effects of LEAP2 deletion on these metabolic parameters, including the impact of diet and sex.\n\nFinally, we would like to emphasize some of the most novel aspects of this study. We report for the first time the metabolic effects of chronic, peripheral administration of a novel, long-acting LEAP2 analog. To our knowledge, the metabolic effects of either native LEAP2 or peptide analogs of LEAP2 have yet to be reported following such a prolonged (4 week) administration protocol. Prior reports have evaluated food intake and/or body weight reducing effects of a single peripheral dose, a 4.25 h continuous IV infusion, 4 and 10 consecutive daily ICV doses, and a 6 d continuous SC infusion of LEAP2 or short-acting LEAP2 analogs in obese and/or lean mice, rats, and humans [14,24,25,40,51]. The chronic 10 d and 4 wk administration protocols used here confirms many of these previous studies while also providing a more representative preclinical assessment of the magnitude of changes in food intake, body weight, and body composition that could be expected upon chronic treatment with a LEAP2 analog. The changes to body weight were robust. To our knowledge, we describe for the first time an effect of a LEAP2 analog to reduce feed efficiency; thus, not only does LEAP2 reduce food intake, but there is less body weight gain per food eaten, suggesting greater energy expenditure. Further, previous studies were limited in their investigations of the effects of LEAP2 on MAFLD. Specifically, a 6 d continuous s.c. infusion of LEAP2 reduced liver weight in calorically-restricted mice but not ad lib-fed mice [24]. Our mice were fed the GAN diet specifically for 10 to over 40 weeks specifically to induce more advanced stages of MAFLD not otherwise achievable with the use of standard Western-style high-fat diet. We demonstrate marked effects to reduce MAFLD upon LA-LEAP2 treatment – including effects on steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. These studies can serve as proof-of-priniciple that LEAP2 analogs show robust efficacy in reducing body weight and MAFLD."
