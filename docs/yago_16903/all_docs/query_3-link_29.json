        "text": "Academic Genealogy\n\nHaym Hirsh\n\n(b. 1963, Hollywood, CA)\n\nPh.D. Computer Science, Stanford University, 1989: \"Incremental Version Space Merging: A General Framework for Concept Learning\"\n\nAdvisor: Bruce Buchanan\n\nBruce Gardner Buchanan\n\n(b. July 7, 1940, St. Louis)\n\nPh.D. Philosophy, Michigan State University, 1966: \"Logics of Scientific Discovery\"\n\nAdvisor: Gerald Massey\n\nGerald J. Massey\n\n(b. Feb 11, 1934, Wauseon, Ohio)\n\nPh.D. Philosophy, Princeton University, 1964: \"The Philosophy of Space\"\n\nAdvisor: Carl Hempel\n\nThe Mathematics Genealogy Project lists Alonzo Church also as an advisor, but Massey's personal biography notes that Hempel was his advisor and Church was first reader of his dissertation. When I gave an after-dinner talk on Bruce Buchanan's genealogy at a festschrift in his honor that Massey attended I listed solely Hempel as his advisor, and Massey raised no objections (as opposed to what happened when I turned to Hempel's advisor - see below).\n\nCarl Gustav Hempel\n\n(b. Jan. 8, 1905, Oranienburg, Germany; d. November 9, 1997, Princeton, NJ)\n\nPh.D. Philosophy, Berlin, 1934: \"Beitrage zur logischen analyse des wahrscheinlichkeitsbegriffs\"\n\nAdvisor: Hans Reichenbach\n\nThe Mathematics Genealogy Project lists Hans Reichenbach as Hempel's dissertation advisor, and early gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler as \"Advisor 2\". As Hempel explained in the section \"Memoirs\" in his Selected Philosophical Essays: \"After my return from Vienna, I began to work on my doctoral dissertation, which dealt with the statistical concept of probability. Reichenbach agreed to be my thesis advisor (Doktorvater), and I began work with him. But in 1933 he was relieved of his position in Berlin because of his Jewish ancestry. ... Reichenbach's dismissal made it necessary for me to seek new sponsors and examiners for my dissertation project; I am grateful to Wolfgang Köhler, with whom I had done course work, and to Nicolai Hartmann, who did not know me at all, for having agreed to take on that role. I completed my dissertation on problems of the frequentist conception of probability on my own.\" So (1) much of the dissertation work was done during Reichenbach's time as advisor, (2) it is Köhler's signature on the dissertation, and (3) Hempel says he did it largely on his own. For that matter, along the way Hempel also studied mathematics with David Hilbert, logic with John von Neumann, physics with Max Planck, and spent time with Rudolph Carnap and others in the Vienna Circle. At my previously mentioned dinner talk for Bruce Buchanan, I referred to Reichenbach as Hempel's advisor, but Gerald Massey was unhappy that I did not acknowledge Köhler as advisor. I still think my decision was consistent with the spirit of \"advisor\", and I've similarly chosen to move ahead with Reichenbach as advisor in what follows.\n\nHans Reichenbach\n\n(b. Sept. 26, 1891, Hamburg, Germany; d. April 9, 1953, Los Angeles, CA)\n\nPhilosophy, Erlangen, 1915: \"Der Begriff der Wahrscheinlichkeit fur die mathematische Darstellung der Wirklichkeit\"\n\nAdvisors: Paul Hensesl, Max Noether\n\nWhen I first started researching this academic genealogy I entered into a correspondence with Hans Reichenbach's widow, Maria, who died at age 104 and outlived her husband by more than 60 years. She told me that Reichenbach's advisors were Paul Hensel and Emmy Noether, Max Noether's daughter, and as a result I had previously listed her as co-advisor. However, I was later sent a copy of the signature page by a European academic whose name I've sadly misplaced, and the dissertation is signed by Max Noether. You can also find copies online that list \"Referent: Professor Hensel\" and \"Koreferent: Professor Noether\". The latter must refer to Max Noether, since his daughter, being female, did not have a full-fledged academic position at Erlangen. It might very well have been that Emmy Noether was de facto the advisor but Max was nominally the one who signed on her behalf. Nonetheless, I am using Max Noether as co-advisor here in the absence of hard evidence to the contrary. If that name should more accurately be Emmy Noether, it would require only a minor tweak to this genealogy: instead of Max's two advisors I would list Emmy's advisor Paul Gordan, and then to the same \"grand-advisor\" as Max Noether, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.\n\nReichenbach advisor 1\n\nPaul Hensel\n\n(b. 17 May 1860, Groß-Barthen, Germany; d.11 November 1930, Erlangen, Germany)\n\nDr. phil., Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg, 1885: \"Uber die Beziehung des reinen Ich bei Fichte zur Einheit der Apperception bei Kant\"\n\nAdvisor: Alois Riehl\n\nAlois Riehl\n\n(b. 27 April 1844, Bozen, Austria; d. 21 November 1924, Neubabelsberg, Germany)\n\nDr. phil. Universität Innsbruck 1868\n\nAdvisor: unknown\n\nThis is one of the current dead ends in the genealogy. I'd love to hear from anyone who knows more about Riehl's academic genealogy.\n\nReichenbach advisor 2\n\nMax Noether\n\n(b. September 24, 1844, Mannheim, Baden, Germany; d.

Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg, 1868\n\nAdvisors: Ludwig Otto Hesse, Gustav Robert Kirchoff\n\nNot only was Hesse co-advisor, he was also the other co-advisor's (Kirchoff's) advisor, so the two lines quickly converge below.\n\nNoether advisor 1\n\nGustav Robert Kirchhoff\n\n(b.
