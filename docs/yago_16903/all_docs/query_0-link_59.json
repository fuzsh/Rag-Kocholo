        "text": "GM02 - Pennsylvania German Collection #2\n\nA Defense of the Hessians (Joseph G. Rosengarten, 1899, 28 pages)\n\nThis is an excerpt from the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography that was also published separately at a later date. It provides a historical background of the circumstances of the German people which lead some of them to participate in the American Revolution as Allies of the British.\n\nThe German Immigration into Pennsylvania Through the\n\nPort of Philadelphia 1700-1775. The Redemptioners\n\n(Frank Reid Diffenderffer, 1900, 386 pages)\n\nThis publication was written by one of the foremost authorities on German immigration. It is a discussion of the Redemptioner or Indentured servant who sold themselves to gain passage to America.\n\nPart I - The German Immigration into Pennsylvania\n\nChapters:\n\n1 - Our Sources of Information Relative to the German Immigration\n\n2 - Causes Leading to the Migration to Pennsylvania\n\n3 - Penn's own Description of his Province\n\n4 - Efforts to Secure Colonists Successful\n\n5 - The Voyage Across the Ocean\n\n6 - Pennsylvania the Favorite Home of German Immigrants\n\n7 - Glance at the Quarrels Between the Proprietary Governors and the Provincial Assembly\n\n8 - Early Demand of the Germans for Naturalization\n\n9 - The German Population of Pennsylvania\n\n10 - Their Detractors and their Friends\n\n11 - The Germans as Farmers\n\nPart II - The Redemptioners\n\nChapters:\n\n1 - Who and What They Were\n\n2 - Bond Servants a Universal Custom of the Times\n\n3 - Origin and Meaning of the Term \"Redemptioner\"\n\n4 - The \"Newlanders\" or Soul-Sellers\n\n5 - The Testimony of the Newspapers Concerning the Traffic in Redemptioners in the 18th Century\n\n6 - Redemptioners or Indentured Servants not all Germans\n\n7 - Christopher Saur's Letters to Governor Morris\n\n8 - The Mortality of Immigrants on Shipboard\n\n9 - The Traffic in Redemptioners in the Neighboring Colonies\n\n10 - Argument to Show the Redemptioner System was not Wholly Evil\n\nRedemptioners and Indentured Servants in the Colony and\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania (Karl Frederick Geiser, 1901, 127 pages)\n\nThis publication is an examination of the practice of indentured servitude which allowed many German immigrants to enter the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nChapters:\n\n1 - Introduction\n\n2 - Causes of Immigration\n\n3 - The Number and Significance of Redemtioners and Indentured Servants\n\n4 - Historical Sketch of Immigration\n\n5 - The Voyage\n\n6 - Laws and Methods of Regulating Transportation\n\n7 - The Indenture\n\n8 - The Runaways\n\n9 - Punative and Marriage Regulations\n\n10 - The Servant in the Army\n\n11 - The Social Status of the Servant\n\nThe German and Swiss Settlements of Colonial Pennsylvania.\n\nA Study of the So-Called Pennsylvania Dutch (Oscar Kuhns, 1901, 279 pages)\n\nFrom the Preface: \"The object of this book is to give a complete yet concise view of a too-much-neglected phase of American origins. The author has especially tried to be impartial, avoiding as far as possible mere rhetoric, and allowing the facts to speak for themselves. As a book of this kind can have no real value unless it is reliable, authorities have been freely quoted, even at the risk of making the number of foot-notes larger than is perhaps suited to the taste of the general public.\" This publication covers information pertaining to the German immigration to Pennsylvania and the contribution of these German immigrants to the development of the regions they settled. The appendix contains a list of the German and Swiss surnames and their meaning.\n\nStudies in Pennsylvania German Family Names\n\n(Oscar Kuhns, 1901, 45 pages)\n\nThis is an excerpt from the publication Americana Germanica Vol. 4, No. 4. It focuses on the family names of Pennsylvania Germans discussing 1) the meaning of the original German names, and 2) the changes those names underwent in America. It relates a great deal of source information on these names including an alphabetical list giving the meanings of surname parts.\n\nThe German Pioneers in Pennsylvania (George W. Richards, 1905, 31 pages)\n\nThis was an essay read before the Cliosophic Society of Lancaster, PA and the Reformed Ministerial Association of Philadelphia. This is a brief discussion of the German settlers of Pennsylvania and their part in the later development of the State and country.\n\nThe German Pioneers in Pennsylvania\n\n(George W. Richards, 1905, 31 pages)\n\nThis is a general discussion of the German immigrants to Pennsylvania; their culture, and contribution to life in the new world.\n\nGerman Religious Life in Colonial Times\n\n(Lucy Forney Bittinger, 1906, 140 pages)\n\nFrom the Preface: \"The work deals with much the same subject as that of my earlier book, “The Germans in Colonial Times.” But it is specifically confined to an account of the religious life of the same period and people. A better title would have been “Church Life,” were it not that the restriction of the term “church” to the three tolerated confessions-Lutheran, Reformed, and Catholic makes this title seem to confine the subject of the work to them, whereas the story of the sects forms a large part of it, as well in importance as in bulk. It has been my aim to make the history a connected story, not following the thread of each separate denomination’s annals, but rather trying to look over the whole field and narrate the general course of ecclesiastical life among the Germans in America during the Colonial era.\"\n\nChapters:\n\n1 - Religious Conditions in Germany\n\n2 - The Separatists\n\n3 - The Church People\n\n4 - The Moravians\n\n5 - The Methodists\n\n6 - The German Churches During the Revolution\n\nThe Dunkers - A Sociological Interpretation\n\n(John Lewis Gillin, 1906, 237 pages)\n\nThis publication is a history of the Dunkers [Tunkers] including their origins and life in Europe, but also their immigration to America and subsequent growth in their new land. Much of the information focuses on Pennsylvania where a large number of this faith resided.\n\nThe Life of Francis Daniel Pastorius The Founder of\n\nGermantown (Marion Dexter Learned, 1906, 424 pages)\n\nThis is a narrative covering the life of Francis Daniel Pastorius who was a prominent religious figure in colonial Pennsylvania. He was instrumental in the foundation and growth of Germantown and its community.\n\nThe Mennonites in America (C. Henry Smith, 1909, 497 pages)\n\nFrom the Introduction: \"Although the story of the religious life of the Mennonites may be told in few words, yet they have been the founders of the first German colony in America and have been among the pioneers in many of the frontier settlements in the westward expansion of the American people. And for this reason their history is of interest also to the student of general American history. I have attempted therefore to trace in this volume not only the history of the Mennonite church but also the complete life story of the Mennonite people...\"\n\nChapters:\n\n1 - The Anabaptists\n\n2 - Menno Simons and the Mennonites of Europe\n\n3 - Cornelisz Pieter Plockhoy and the Mennonite Colony on the Delaware\n\n4 - Germantown\n\n5 - The Pequea Colony\n\n6 - Franconia\n\n7 - Expansion of the Pequea Colony before 1800\n\n8 - The Amish\n\n9 - During the Revolution\n\n10 - The Mennonites of Ontario\n\n11 - The Mennonites During the Nineteenth Century\n\n1) Settlements in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and the Western States\n\n2) Schisms\n\n3) The Civil War.\n\n12 - The Immigration from Russia .\n\n13 - The General Conference of Mennonites\n\nThe German Element in the United States\n\n(Albert Bernhardt Faust, 1909, 1200 pages)\n\nThis book provides an extensive look into the German element of the United States, and the way it influenced American society, particularly in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio.

Von Skal, 1910, 347 pages)\n\nFrom the Introduction: \"This work is intended to be a record of all that Germans have accomplished in the United States - a record of honest endeavor, energy, perseverance, strength and achievement. It shall, in addition, show the part that the American citizen of German blood has taken in the making of these United States, in peace and war, on the battlefield as well as in the counting house, the workshop and laboratory, in the realm of science and education or in the long fight that was necessary to extend civilization and culture over a continent. It contains a history of German immigration in the United States from the first settlements to the present day, showing what the Germans were who left the fatherland, why they came, and what they did in their new country. Every incident throwing light upon the work done by the German element has been made use of to give a complete, though concise, and impartial recital of its activity, and a description of the influence it has exerted upon the development of the Union. In the second part the biographies of many Americans of German nativity or descent are given.\"\n\nChapter Titles:\n\nHistory of German Immigration in the United States\n\nA Martyr to Liberty\n\nThe Pennsylvania Germans\n\nThe Germans During the Revolution\n\nFrom the Revolution to the Year 1848\n\nThe Forty-Eighters\n\nThe Civil War and the Years Following It\n\nFrom the Franco-German War to the Present Day\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Percentage of German Blood in the American People\n\nSuccessful German-Americans and Their Descendants\n\nSurnames Indexed:\n\nAbbe, Ackerman, Amend, Ams, Anderson, Bahrenburg, Balser, Barbey, Baruch, Beck, Berger, Blank, Blun, Boldt, Borkel, Brandner, Brunn, Buchsbaum, Clausen, Conreid, Cordis, Demuth, Dennig, Diefendorf, Diehl, Dippel, Dittenhoefer, Drakenfeld, Dressel, Eggers, Ehret, Eichler, Eickemeyer, Eidlitz, Eimer, Endemann, Engelhard, Engelmann, Engler, Eschmann, Ewald, Feldmann, Finn, Foelker, Fornes, Frank, Freundlich, Frey, Froeb, Fromme, Gass, Gerdau, Giegerich, Gillig, Goepel, Goertz, Goldmann, Goldschmidt, Greenhut, Grill, Groll, Gross, Grossman, Haffen, Hardenbergh, Haupt, Hauser, Haussling, Hegner, Heide, Heidritter, Heine, Heinrichs, Heintz, Heitemeyer, Helwig, Hering, Herold, Heuman, Hexamer, Hohner, Holm, Hornfeck, Hottenroth, Hraba, Hupfel, Iden, Intemann, Janssen, Joseph, Juhring, Jurgens, Kahn, Karsch, Kaufmann, Kempner, Keuffel, Kiliani, Kleinert, Knopf, Koch, Koehle, Kolle, Koller, Krause, Kremer, Krug, Kuder, Kudlich, Kunstlich, Langeloth, Lankering, Lanzer, Lauterbach, Lentz, Leschziner, Lewinson, Lichtenstein, Loeb, Loewenthal, Lustgarten, Luttgen, Mack, Maier, Mayer, Mennen, Martens, Metz, Meyer, Mietz, Miller, Mischo, Mohr, Moser, Nahmmaker, Nissen, Nordeman, Oberlaender, Obermayer, Oelkers, Ordemann, Otto, Peter, Peters, Pfizer, Prieth, Rapp, Rappenbagen, Reichhelm, Reisenweber, Reisinger, Renken, Rice, Riefe, Rinckhoff, Ringe, Ritterbusch, Rothbarth, Ruppert, Schaefer, Schieren, Schiff, Schirmer, Schmidt, Schneider, Schnitzler, Schreiter, Schurz, Schwab, Seitz, Seligman, Siegel, Simon, Sohmer, Speyer, Stadler, Steenken, Steil, Steneck, Stern, Steuer, Strasbourger, Strauss, Stuhr, Sturhahn, Sulzberger, Sulzer, Sutro, Szussky, Thalman, Thun, Timken, Volk, Vom Cleff, Von Baur-Breitenfeld, Von Der Bruck, Von Glahn, Von Minden, Wagner, Wahle, Waldenberger, Waldstein, Walther, Weber, Wehrenberg, Wehrum, Weidemann, Weil, Weiler, Welte, Wesendonck, Wessell, Wicke, Windmuller, Windolph, Wischmann, Wissner, Wolfsohn, Zimmermann\n\nHistoric Background and Annals of the Swiss and\n\nGerman Pioneer Settlers of Southeastern Pennsylvania\n\n(H. Frank Eshleman, 1917, 389 pages)\n\n\"An authentic history, from original sources, of their suffering during several centuries before and especially during the two centuries following the Protestant Reformation, and of their slow migration, moved by those causes, during the last mentioned two hundred years, westward in quest of religious freedom and their happy relief in the Susquehanna and Schuylkill Valleys in the New World; with particular reference to the German-Swiss Mennonites or Anabaptists, the Amish and other non-resistant sects.\" The information is laid out in a timeline starting in the 11th century continuing until the late 18th century. There are many details related as to the obstacles and sufferings of religious denominations whose followers eventually settled in southeastern Pennsylvania. Most of the information is historical in nature but it is also useful for genealogical research, as many individuals are named throughout.\n\nSurnames Indexed: (with at least 4 occurrances)\n\nAbercrombie, Adams, Aebersold, Aeschbacher, Aeschlimann, Albert, Albright, Allen, Amman, Andrews, Anken, Appel, Arndt, Arnold, Arnot, Atkinson, Bachman, Baer, Baker, Barell, Bassler, Bauman, Baumgardner, Bausmans, Bender, Beck, Becker, Berger, Bernharts, Beyer, Binkley, Blaser, Bowman, Brackbill, Brancht, Brand, Brechbuhl, Brobst, Brons, Brown, Bucher, Buckwalter, Buhler, Bundely, Burger, Burkard, Burkey, Burkhalter, Burkhart, Burkholder, Bumgardner, Carpenter, Carter, Cartlidge, Christ, Christians, Coatman, Coningham, Conrads, Creamer, Davis, Denck, Detwiller, Difinderfer, Eberhart, Ebersole, Eby, Eckert, Egli, Engle, Erisman, Eshleman, Everling, Fahrm, Ferree, Fink, Fisher, Forry, Fox, Franciscus, Frank, Frantz, Fredericks, Frey, Funk, Garber, Gardner, Gaumann, Gerfer, Gerhart, Gochnauer, Good, Gordon, Graff, Graeff, Graybill, Groff, Gut, Haldeman, Haller, Hare, Hartman, Hellar, Hendrick, Hendricks, Hensel, Herr, Herman, Hermans, Hershey, Hess, Hiestand, Hoffer, Hoffman, Hollinger, Huber, Hupmeier, Immel, Jones, Kauffman, Kautz, Keith, Kellar, Keller, Kendig, Kieffer, King, Klein, Kline, Kolb, Krahenbuhl, Kramer, Krebs, Kreider, Kuenzi, Kuhn, Kuhns, Kurtz, Landis, Leaman, Lefever, Lehman, Lehmann, Leonard, Lesher, Lintner, Logan, Long, Longnecker, Ludwig, Luther, Luthi, Lutz, Martin, Manz, Mason, Meier, Meyer, Metzgar, Miller, Mitchell, Mittelberger, Moor, Moore, Morris, Moser, Mosser, Moyer, Muir, Muller, Musser, Musgraves, Mussleman, Myers, Mylin, Neff, Neuenchwender, Newcomer, Newhauser, Newswanger, Oberholtzers, Oberly, Pastorius, Penn, Pennypacker, Percy, Peters, Phillips, Preneman, Pupather, Ream, Reed, Reher, Reinharts, Reist, Richen, Ritter, Rohrer, Roth, Runckel, Rupp, Russel, Saphorin, Sattler, Sauder, Schaeffer, Scheider, Schenk, Schilt, Schmidt, Schmied, Schnebeli, Schneider, Schurch, Schwartz, Shaeffer, Shaffer, Shank, Shultz, Shuemaker, Shumaker, Simon, Smith, Snavely, Snyder, Spurrier, Stauffer, Stedman, Stehli, Stein, Steiner, Steinman, Steinmetz, Stettler, Stone, Stoner, Straub, Swartz, Taylor, Telner, Thomas, Thouen, Trussel, Wagner, Walters, Weaver, Weidman, Weher, Wenger, Wilson, Wise, Wissler, Witmer, Wolf, Wright, Young, Zahler, Zaug, Zellers, Ziegler, Zimmerman, Zugg, Zwingle\n\nThe Genealogical Record of the Schwenkfelder Families\n\n(Samuel Kriebel Brecht, 1923, 1891 pages)\n\nThis is an extensive collection of historical and genealogical data dealing with the Schwenkfelders, a group who emigrated from Europe to escape religious persecution. The account begins with a history of the group and the religious beliefs that made them different from others around them. In a period of time where there were sharp divisions between the Catholic and Protestant Churches, this group experienced the ire of both sides, ultimately forcing them to leave for the New World. Information is noted about each of the times members of the group immigrated to America, these migrations falling between the years 1731 and 1737.\n\nIn addition, there is extensive material about the settlement of the group in Pennsylvania. There is burial information from several private cemeteries, and details on the burial locations of many more of the group's members. There is also data dealing with where the various members settled.\n\nThe major portion of the data is genealogical - this publication systematically traces the descendants of the original immigrants:\n\nGeorge Scholtz (Schultz or Shultz), Anna Krauss, Melchior Hubner (Heebner), Christoph Kribel (Kriebel), David Hubner (Heebner), Balthasar Jackel (Yeakel), Melchior Kribel (Kriebel), George Anders, George Reinwalt, Hans Wiegner, George Wiegner, David Jackel (Yeakel), Gregorius Meisther (Meschter), Christoph Reinwald, George Mentzel, Melchior Mentzel, Melchior Neuman, Tobias Hartranft, George Weiss, Caspar Heydrick, Balthasar Heydrick, Matthus Jakel (Yeakle), David Seibt (Seipt), George Heydrick, Gregorius Scholtze (Schultz), George Drescher (Dresher), Melcher Meishter (Meschter), George Scholtze (Schultz), Melchior Scholtze (Schultz), Christoph Scholtze (Schultz), Caspar John, Andreas Warmer, Hans Hubner (Heebner), David Schubert (Shoebart), Susanna Heydrick Wiegner, Ursula Hoffman, Susanna Dietrich Scholtze, Susanna Seibt Wiegner, Regina Hubner Jackel (Yeakle), Anna Reinwald Anders, Abraham Heydrick, Eva Yeakel Meschter, Abraham Beer (Beyer), Anna Yeakel Wagner, Anna Wagner (Wagener), Christopher Hubner (Heebner), Maria Beyer Krauss, and Abraham Jackel (Yeakel).\n\nThis genealogical data includes information on thousands of individuals who descended from these immigrants, in some cases extending up to the latter part of the 19th century. The last section of this publication is a highly useful every-name index which spans 150 pages.\n\nSurnames listed: (Due to the number of names, only those with frequent appearances are listed)\n\nAcker, Ackerman, Adams, Alderfer, Allebach, Allen, Althouse, Anders, Anderson, Andrews, Anson, Antrim, Armstrong, Arnold, Auchy, Bachman, Bailey, Baker, Barnes, Bartholomew, Baus, Bean, Beard, Bechtel, Beck, Beideman, Bender, Benfield, Benner, Berger, Bergey, Berry, Beyer, Bieler, Biles, Billman, Bittenbender, Black, Blattner, Bobb, Boggs, Bolton, Bookheimer, Boorse, Bortz, Bosler, Bossert, Bowers, Bowman, Bradley, Brant, Breisch, Brendlinger, Brey, Brinton, Brooks, Brown, Brunner, Buchanan, Buchter, Burke, Bush, Butterweck, Butz, Cain, Campbell, Carl, Carpenter, Carson, Cassel, Casselberry, Christman, Clark, Cleaver, Clemens, Clemmer, Cole, Coleman, Comstock, Conrad, Cook, Cope, Corbit, Corson, Cox, Cramer, Crawford, Cress, Cressman, Crouthamel, Custer, Dager, Dague, Dannehower, Daub, Davidheiser, Davis, Decker, Deetz, De Haven, Deischer, DeLong, Delp, Dennis, Derr, Deshler, Dettor, Dettra, Detwiler, Dickinson, Diehl, Diffenderfer, Dimmig, Dixon, Dresher, Druckenmiller, Drumheller, Dunlap, Dunn, Eberly, Ebert, Eckert, Edelman, Edwards, Eichelberger, Elliott, Ellis, Enck, Endy, Engle, Erb, Edgar, Eschbach, Evans, Everett, Faddis, Fague, Famous, Faust, Fegley, Fetterman, Fetterolf, Fisher, Fleisher, Flick, Fluck, Focht, Foster, Fox, Frank, Frantz, Frederick, Freed, Freedman, Fretz, Frey, Freyer, Frick, Fries, Fritsch, Fulmer, Funk, Gabel, Garber, Garner, Gaugler, Gehman, Geho, Geiger, Geissinger, George, Gerhard, Gery, Gilbert, Glaes, Good, Goodfellow, Gordon, Gottschall, Gotwals, Graber, Grater, Gray, Green, Gresh, Greulich, Greisemer, Groff, Gross, Grove, Grubb, Guinn, Guyer, Haas, Hackett, Hafer, Hagenbuch, Hagey, Hagy, Hahn, Haines, Hains, Hallman, Halteman, Hamilton, Harley, Harris, Harrison, Hart, Harte, Hartman, Hartranft, Hartzell, Hauck, Hawk, Heany, Heckler, Heckman, Heebner, Heilig, Heimbach, Hein, Heist, Heller, Henderson, Hendricks, Henning, Henry, Herbst, Herman, Hersh, Herster, Hess, Heydrick, Heydt, Hiestand, High, Hildebrand, Hildenbrand, Hill, Hillegass, Hiltebeitel, Hinkle, Hoffman, Hoke, Hoover, Hopfer, Horn, Horner, Houck, Howard, Huber, Hubner, Hughes, Hughson, Hunsberger, Hunsperger, Hunsicker, Hunt, Hutchinson, Ingram, Innes, Jackson, Jacobs, Jacoby, Jackel, Johnson, Jones, Kafer, Kauffman, Keck, Keehn, Keeler, Keely, Kehl, Keiper, Keisel, Keller, Kelly, Kemmerer, Kennedy, Kepler, Kerlin, Kern, Kerr, Kerver, Keylor, Keyser, Kindig, King, Klein, Kline, Knipe, Koch, Kohler, Kramer, Kratzer, Krauss, Kriebel, Krupp, Kulp, Kurtz, Landis, Laubach, Lawall, Lee, Leeser, Leh, Leidy, Leister, Lessig, Levan, Levengood, Lewis, Lindemuth, Little, Long, Longacre, Lukens, Lutz, McElwain, Mack, Madison, Mairs, Markley, Marshall, Marsteller, Martin, Mason, Matthias, Maurer, Maxwell, Meloy, Merkel, Meschter, Mest, Metz, Metzger, Meyers, Miller, Mininger, Mixsell, Mohr, Moll, Montz, Moore, Morris, Morrison, Moser, Moyer, Murphy, Nace, Nagle, Nash, Neuman, Newman, Nice, Nichols, Norris, Nunemacher, Nuss, Nyce, Oberholtzer, Odenwelder, Osborn, Ott, Palmer, Parker, Patterson, Patteson, Paxson, Pennick, Pennypacker, Peters, Phillips, Poley, Porter, Potts, Powell, Price, Printz, Rabenold, Raesly, Rahn, Rambo, Ramsey, Rapp, Raudenbush, Reed, Reese, Reiff, Reinert, Reinhart, Reinwald, Reiter, Renninger, Rex, Rhoads, Rice, Richards, Rittenhouse, Ritter, Roberts, Robinson, Rock, Rodenbach, Roeder, Roeller, Rogers, Rose, Rosenberger, Roshong, Ross, Roth, Rothenberger, Rowland, Royer, Ruckstuhl, Rudy, Russell, Ruth, Sassaman, Sauter, Savidge, Saylor, Sayres, Schaeffer, Schantz, Scheetz, Schell, Schelly, Schlicher, Scholl, Schmidt, Schneider, Schrack, Schubert, Schueck, Schuler, Schultz, Schwartz, Schwenk, Seibert, Seipt, Shaw, Shearman, Shellenberger, Sheppard, Shoemaker, Shupe, Siesholtz, Sites, Smale, Smith, Snabel, Snyder, Speer, Spencer, Springer, Steger, Stahl, Stahler, Stahlnecker, Stauffer, Steinman, Sterner, Stevens, Stewart, Stichter, Stoudt, Stover, Strauch, Stroh, Strunk, Summers, Supplee, Taggart, Taylor, Thomas, Thompson, Treichler, Trout, Trucksess, Trumbower, Trump, Turner, Tyson, Underkoffler, Urffer, Van Fossen, Wagner, Walter, Walters, Wampole, Wanner, Warner, Weaver, Weber, Weidner, Weikel, Weiss, Weit, Wells, Wentzel, Werner, Wert, White, Wieand, Wiegner, Wile, Williams, Wilson, Wilser, Wismer, Wister, Wolf, Wolfe, Wonsetler, Wood, Worth, Wright, Yeager, Yeakel, Yeakle, Yerger, Yocum, Yoder, Yost, Young, Ziegler, Zimmerman\n\nA Collection of Upwards of 30,000 Names of German, Swiss, Dutch,\n\nFrench and other Immigrants to Pennsylvania From 1727 to 1776\n\n(I. Daniel Rupp, 1927, 522 pages)\n\nThis publication consists mostly of an extensive compilation of ship lists for European immigrants who ultimately settled in Pennsylvania. The information includes the ship name, captain, port of departure, and passenger lists for hundreds of ships which sailed from 1727 to 1776. The appendicies at the end of the book offer additional information: The Names of the first settlers of Germantown from 1683-1710, Names of early settlers of Berks, Lebanon, Montgomery & Philadelphia Counties, Swiss & German settlers in Lancaster County from 1709-1730, Names of those who accompanied Rev.
