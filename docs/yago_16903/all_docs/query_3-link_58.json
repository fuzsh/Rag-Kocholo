        "text": "Notes for SOLOMAN BUTCHER:\n\nbur. Butcher Cem., Lew. Co., WV.\n\nSOLOMON BUTCHER was the eighth child of PAULSER AND ELIZABETH\n\n(BUSH) BUTCHER. He was born April 29, 1790 and died April 12, 1879.\n\nThere is no record that he ever married and ample supposition that\n\nas a young man he ventured away to unknown destinations to later\n\nreturn to Lewis County, West Virginia where he was born - and died.\n\nHe is buried in the Butcher Cemetery at Turnertown - about three miles\n\nbelow Weston, on the West Fork River.\n\nHe was willed $30 by his father, Paulser, to be paid \" if he ever\n\nreturns. \"Nothing further is known about Solomon Butcher.\n\nOne report says he lived with aunt Caty, who was his brother Henry's\n\nwife and lived on the old Butcher homestead.\n\nFAMILY REFERENCE POINT : SOLOMON BUTCHER was the great, great, great,\n\nuncle of Galelma, Jr., and Byron Thomas Butcher - and Dana L.\n\nThomason, Sr., and his brothers and sisters.\n\nNotes for WILLIAM BUTCHER:\n\nWilliam Butcher died prior to the will of his father, Paulser Butcher, will datedJuly 19, 1829. William was not mentioned in the will.\n\nFurther, in review of the Butcher records at Weston, his name is not associated with any transaction involving any other members of his family. Therefore, he must have died early in life and in all probability is buried in the Butcher Cemetery, which undoubtedly was established by his father on the river bank, almost in sight of their home."
