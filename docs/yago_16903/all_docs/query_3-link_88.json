The other named John Michael Rider, about 5 feet 7 inches high, 25 years of age, well set, brownish hair, which he wears tied behind, red beard, whitish eye brows, large curled locks on each temple, and a large scar on the sole of one of his feet; had on, and took with him, two new tow shirts, a pair of tow trowsers, a pair of home made bearskin breeches, lined with tow cloth, a jacket of the same, with three flowered metal buttons on each sleeve, a red broadcloth jacket, half worn, blue flowered metal buttons on each sleeve, a red broadcloth jacket, half worn blue flowered damask ditto, without sleeves, and another blue ditto, bound round the arm-holes with linen; also a blue broadcloth coat, lined with red, with button-holes on each side, chiefly false holes, a pair of old leather breeches patched with new leather, a large felt hat, with a brass button, two pair of light coloured yarn stockings, old shoes, a pair of boots, grain side out, a large Dutch pillow case of stamped linen, a piece of white linen for shirts, a silk handkerchief, a stamped linen ditto, and a hogskin knapsack, with the hair on; he speaks broken English, but is a great talker, smokes much, takes snuff, plays on the fiddle and pretends to be a conjurer. They have two fiddles with them, and one of them has plenty of money; they have both been soldiers, and came last fall from Lisbon, can talk Dutch, French, and perhaps Portuguese. It is supposed they will change their clothes. They crossed the river at New-Castle, and came up towards Chester, where they were seen, and it is thought they are gone towards Lancaster or Maryland. Whoever apprehends or secures the said servants, or either of them, in any of his Majesty's gaols [jails], so that their masters may have them again, or brings them to their respective masters, or to Richard Wister, in Philadelphia, shall have Sixteen Dollars for the first mentioned, and Four Dollars for the last, besides reasonable charges, paid by us. Signed Martin Halter, Hugh Blackwood, Richard Wister, July 11, 1767.\" [This ad appeared in 20 July 1767 issue of The Pennsylvania Chronicle]\n\nEvidently Charles was recaptured and sold to another master, but ran away again the next year:\n\nVolume 26 of New Jersey Archives, Series 1, page 153: \"Run away from the Subscriber, living in Salem county, West-New Jersey, a Dutch servant man, named Charles Geisinger; he is five feet two inches high, and about thirty two years of age, has a brown complexion and black short hair. Had on, when he went away, a double breasted swanskin jacket, with black spots and brown mohair buttons, also a brown linen one over it, a pair of half-worn shoes, with brass buckles, and a very small cut hat. Whoever takes up said servant man, and secures him, in any gaol [jail], or brings him to the Subscriber shall have ten dollars Reward, and reasonable charges, paid by me.\" Signed, George Miller [This ad appeared in 9 May 1768 issue of The Pennsylvania Chronicle, it is obvious nobody knew his age, he may have in fact been younger than 32 or 27. We estimate his birth to be 1740-1743.]\n\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR RECORD: CHARLES SERVED FROM PENNSYLVANIA FHL 973 W2 smn no. 27, Some German-American Participants in the American Revolution: The Rattermann Lists, by Clifford Neal Smith, pages 21-22, 29 lists Karl Geisinger (Gysinger) taken as a prisoner of War at the Battle of Trois Rivieres [Canada]. Karl belonged to Company No. 6 under Captain David Greier, of the Seventh Continental Regiment, formerly the Sixth Battalion from Pennsylvania. Karl was also listed under Freiherr Von Ottendorf as an enlisted man who signed up 13 Jan 1777. Listed with him was Johannes Geisinger who enlisted 16 Mar 1777.\n\nKind of neat to learn what your great grandfather looked like isn't it? >From here it would be advisable to try and locate German military records of the era 1760-1766 in order to see if a Karl Geissinger was recorded. He probably was stationed in France and Lisbon with the German forces. He might have originated from western Germany near the French border. These are good clues.
