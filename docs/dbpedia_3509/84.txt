Each writer, however, must fill out and sign the online entry application and release form individually. If selected as a winner, the prize money will be split equally between them.

Submissions must be the original work of the applicant(s) and may not be based, in whole or in part, on any other fiction or nonfiction material, published or unpublished, produced or un-produced that is not already in public domain.

Each script entered is allotted one genre category in the price of the submission. Please do not enclose letters, resumes or photos with your submission. They will not be forwarded to our partners or the judges.

Writers are free to enter their submitted material to other contests; however, they must not have already received a screenwriting prize that includes a “first look” clause, an option, or any other quid pro quo involving the writer's submitted entry to Creative World Awards LLC. If a submitted screenplay becomes optioned or purchased between the time of submission and the end of the Creative World Awards judging period, the applicant must notify us and that screenplay will no longer be eligible for an award.

Scripts must be typed in English, with pages numbered; be headed by the title page, which includes title of work and WGA registration date/number if applicable; font must be 12-point Courier, Courier New or Courier Final Draft (no exceptions).

If you do not have one of the above, you may submit in a Word .doc as a last option, but it must contain the industry standard format.

Following the close of the season, the Grand Prize Winner will be given a choice to either receive $1,000 additional cash prize money, or elect to use that $1,000 as payment in full for writing a short version of their winning feature script (the short script will be fifteen pages or less). If Creative World Awards (CWA) produces the short script, it will be used by CWA as a tool to help promote the Grand Prize Winner’s feature script, and also give the writer imdb credit once it premieres at the Richmond International Film Festival. The Grand Prize Winner agrees that if they elect to forgo the additional $1,000 cash and instead choose to use that money as payment in full for their writing contribution on the short film production, that The Moving Image Xchange LLC and CWA will have ownership of the produced film, however, the writer will still retain full and ownership of their feature script. The short production will have no impact on the ownership of the writer’s feature length script; the writer will maintain complete ownership. The Grand Prize Winner also understands that should they elect to use the additional $1,000 for payment in full for writing the short version of the script rather than as cash, that they are responsible for working with the CWA Co-Founders in a timely manner to create the content of the short script. The Moving Image Xchange and CWA may elect not to produce the script if the genre or content isn't a good fit for the new short format or if the writer does not meet the deadlines in a timely fashion. If offered the opportunity to the writer, CWA Co-Founders will work with the writer to develop the short script in the months of September-October with a tentative shoot date set for December or January each year. The film will then premiere at the Richmond International Film Festival in late April, and be used for promotional purposes for the writer to garner interest in the writer's feature script as well as on the contest’s behalf. Producing the short script is at the sole discretion of CWA and The Moving Image Xchange, LLC. Should CWA and The Moving Image Xchange elect not to produce a short version of the Grand Prize Winner’s feature script, the Grand Prize Winner will still receive the additional $1,000. If the Grand Prize Winner consists of more than one writer, it is up to the writers to split the additional $1,000 between them.

Please read and understand the above Rules and Regulations. Failure to adhere to the Creative World Awards contest guidelines could result in disqualification and forfeiture of an entry fee and/or eligible prize.
