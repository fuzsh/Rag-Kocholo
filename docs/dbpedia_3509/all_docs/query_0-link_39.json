        "text": "Nadya Panfilov\n\nNadya was born in Uzbekistan and has spend the last twenty years trying to figure out how to fit into the microcosm of the United States. Her saving grace was film & television and when it came time to apply for colleges her immigrant parents “were very cool about film school.” She graduated from Chapman University with a degree in Screenwriting which is ironic because she actually hates writing. Like so much. Post college she got into TV development and went from intern to Coordinator at Parkes+MacDonald for their first look with Universal Studios. While at Parkes she helped sell two shows to NBC, one to STARZ and the last project she had the honor of working on is pending release from Amazon. After finally admitting to herself that she hated to write and that she loved to help people, she pivoted to representation and started at Writ-Large in January 2020 and quickly rose through the ranks. Now she spends her days grateful to be fulfilled in her career and not having to force herself to write. That can be left to people who actually enjoy it. But she is more than happy to share her opinions, of which she has a lot.\n\nLiz Kelly\n\nLiz Kelly is Senior Manager of Creative Talent Development & Inclusion at Disney Entertainment. In this role, she works with the network and studio to staff writers and directors across ABC, ABC Signature, Freeform, Disney Channel, 20th TV, FX, Nat Geo, Disney+ and Hulu’s scripted television shows. She manages the industry-leading Disney Writing Program and Disney Directing Program. She has staffed talent on THE GOOD DOCTOR, THE ROOKIE, A MILLION LITTLE THINGS, DAVE, HOW I MET YOUR FATHER, SINGLE DRUNK FEMALE, THE GOLDBERGS, STATION 19, RAVEN’S HOME, and BLACK-ISH, among other scripted series. Prior to Disney, Kelly worked for 6 years at Fox, most recently as Associate Director of Production and Development Labs – Film & TV, for 21CF Global Inclusion. Kelly staffed writers and directors on FOX’s scripted television shows, including THE GIFTED, THE COOL KIDS, LUCIFER, LAST MAN ON EARTH, THE EXORCIST, THE RESIDENT, and LETHAL WEAPON, among others. She managed the Fox Writers Lab, Fox Directors Lab, Fox DP Lab, and Fox Filmmakers Lab, tracked and maintained network diversity statistics regarding on-air and behind-the-camera creative talent, and managed the department’s partnerships and sponsorships with non-profits and film and TV festivals.\n\nKelly has been a judge, script reader, or panelist for numerous film and TV festivals across the country, including the Tribeca Film Festival, New York Television Festival, Austin Film Festival, ATX Television Festival, SeriesFest Denver, CAAMFest San Francisco, San Diego Latino Film Festival, NALIP Media Summit, LA Skins Fest, Outfest, BlackStar Philadelphia Film Festival, and Humanitas New Voices. In 2017, she was invited to be part of Creative Artists Agency’s “Amplify: Next Gen” group of up-and-coming entertainment artists, agents, and executives.\n\nKelly is a member of the Hollywood Radio & Television Society. She has a BA from UCLA and is a graduate of UCLA School of Theater Film & Television’s graduate-level Professional Program in Screenwriting.\n\nCraig Brody\n\nCraig Brody is the founder of Map Point Management, a boutique literary management and production company.\n\nBrody began his career in New York City as a lawyer, specializing in intellectual property law at a large corporate law firm before making his move to Hollywood. He wanted to continue representing clients, but was more passionate about advocating for creators than large corporations. Brody’s first stop was at CAA, where he spent 11 years in the motion picture literary department. As an agent, he loved discovering emerging talent and breaking writers and directors from television and theater into film. As the TV renaissance continued, and more of his clients had an interest in working in TV, Brody decided that he would be most valuable in building his clients’ careers if he could work with them in all areas. In 2016, he made the jump to become a manager at The Shuman Company. In 2019, Brody started Map Point Management to further nurture the creative visions of his clients and elevate previously underrepresented voices.\n\nCraig’s clients include writers, directors, and playwrights, such as: Academy Award-nominated writer Virgil Williams (Mudbound, upcoming The Piano Lesson), two-time WGA Award-winning writer Debora Cahn (creator of The Diplomat, Homeland, The West Wing), writer/director Ben Younger (Snowfall, Bleed for This, Boiler Room, Prime), writer/director Stephen Scaia (Tulsa King, co-creator of Blood & Treasure, Limitless), playwright/writer Zakiyyah Alexander (co-showrunner of Grown-ish, Russian Doll), playwright/writer Lauren Yee (Pachinko, Billions, upcoming Interior Chinatown, upcoming The Sterling Affairs), author/writer Sandra Chwialkowska (Alaska Daily),author/writer Sarah Cornwell (Mayfair Witches) writer/director Sherif Alabede (upcoming The Craving, Perry Mason).\n\nCraig lives in Los Angeles with his wife, their two children, and their pet turtle, Jerry.\n\nErwin More\n\nErwin More is currently a founding partner of More/Medavoy Management. As a partner at More/Medavoy he manages a wide array of talents focusing on clients who have multiple platforms in acting, writing, directing, and content creation. More has a passion for representing and inspiring talent. “Pushing the boundaries of what is attainable is my primary goal in the representation business”, says More. More co-ran the talent department at the famed William Morris Agency for seven years where he also focused on television packaging. He also spent five years at the premier talent agency, Paradigm. He got his start working for Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin’s legendary television companies T.A.T and Tandem Productions where he watched television history being made in the company that produced iconic programs such as “All In The Family”, “One Day At A Time”, “Maude”, and “The Jeffersons” to name a few.
