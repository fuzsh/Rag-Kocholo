He must travel through time, win the trust of the estranged wife of a Russian oligarch, exchange witty banter with a fellow spy (Robert Pattinson), and bend the laws of nature in order to be successful in his mission. Featuring some of the most stunning action sequences in recent cinema, Tenet demands to be seen on the big screen, and the Coolidge is thrilled to be presenting it on 35mm.\n\nAbout the Speaker"
