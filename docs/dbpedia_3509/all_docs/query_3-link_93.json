        "text": "Christopher Walkey\n\nChristopher Walkey\n\nChampagne / Sparkling Wine Consultant. Increasing Brand Awareness and Sales for clients globally.\n\nPublished May 2, 2017\n\nI believe that the title image for this piece is very much how the industry is for Champagne and Sparkling Wine, you are merely one of a very large number of other labels out there trying to get seen, trying to find the right connections and ultimately trying to win new business.\n\nThis is the case for most industry sectors out there, it's nothing new and certainly not a challenge that is unique to the wine industry, you would not be in the right business if there was not a degree of competition out there!\n\nSo just what exactly can you do to stand out from the crowd? What does it take to get the edge on your competitors, to build a reputation, brand awareness, recommendations and more?\n\nI thought I would list some key ways for smaller labels (many grand marques may read this piece I have written, but really we must take them out of the equation as their global brand awareness and extensive teams and expertise means that marketing / brand awareness is at a totally different level to anyone else in the industry) to get in front of the people that matter for your business and describe how within each you can make positive steps towards growing sales for your Champagne / Sparkling Wine labels:\n\nBranding / Design. As soon as the wine is produced and ready to be sold in their bottles it is over to the branding and marketing side of things. Have you studied your branding over your local competitors? Is it time for an update? Would you pick your wine out from a row of other similar producers as we must fully appreciate that people still choose on name / branding over what exactly might be in the bottle - Just like choosing a book at the local library based on it's cover. I agree and sympathise that going outside of the ordinary can mean more costs be it shape of bottle or design of label, but is there room for improvement in your current way you encase your wines? There are many companies / artists out there who regularly design new labels for wine producers, many branding agencies who offer a completely new look and even those who research the ideal wine label names if you are looking for a totally new direction.\n\nHow does your wine label compare to both local competitors, but also to other sparkling wines from across the globe and also compare to grand marques to gather ideas.\n\nWine Professionals. Now I want to be clear on this in that wine professionals are not just the people with MW's, WSET's or have written a book on wines a few decades ago, I include new comers to the world of wine, those with big audiences on social media, users of Vivino, lifestyle writers and more ie the kind of people who have big target and importantly current audiences you can tap in to. Being able to network with these people usually takes you to wine tasting events as this is where most gather so it is important to consider not only exhibiting at relevant events though also consider attending to taste wines where you will be able to network face to face with key individuals and of course share what you do, who you are looking to connect with and exchange business cards etc. We must also consider networking in the virtual world also, which is where most of my networking takes place and this evolves mostly around social media.\n\nSocial Media. The almighty topic within marketing, the holy grail for many, businesses launch on it and build into international empires thanks to tweets, likes, posts and updates. In my mind there is no excuse not to be on the likes of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Youtube and believe me that much business and brand awareness takes place on them, it is not just a modern way of communicating for teenagers or bored people updating you on their holiday photos. If you are clever with social media you can build target audiences who will follow your updates and engage with what you share, you can grow groups which can contain 1,000's of chefs, sommeliers, hotel owners, wine buyers and more so you have a 24/7 shop window for your wines. Social media in itself is a full time course and should really be something you are prepared to study in length so not to waste your time with ineffective actions as yet again it is a crowded market with many people desperately trying to grab peoples attention. I suggest you also research who of your competitors are using social media and what their techniques are - Find yourself a social media platform you are comfortable using and start updating news, sharing information, running competitions, commenting, liking and more. Remember that visual is very important in marketing of wines, so be tempted to use photos and videos in your updates as it will lead to more engagement.\n\nWine Merchants. Well OK, not so much marketing and branding, but still part of getting your wines seen and sold. Once again we hit the saturated market wall as the good wine merchants out there, the ones who can get your wines out to hotels, restaurants and bars will no doubt already have a list of wines to sell and many, many more on their 'waiting list'. You can go for smaller more bespoke wine merchants which is a smart smooth, but finding the ones which will not time waste is not easy, sometimes building a relationship via social media or networking at tasting events can be the best way to split the better merchants from the weaker ones.\n\nWebsite. Still very important today and the opportunity exists to become a real authority in your industry sector if you use your website to not only list the wines you have for sale, but also for it to contain educational content such as blogs to increase your chances of being found. A perfect website for me is something easy to use, clear usage of buttons to get people to their preferred pages via the one click only route, plenty of to the point facts and images. It should also contain sections dedicated to latest news, educational content, food pairings, guest writers and more. Website designing is evolving all the time, but do consider that sometimes a flashy website that has the likes of background music, intro videos and more can be less effective than a neat and simple to use website containing factual content.\n\nEvents. There are many to choose from out there these days from attending national tasting events to organising a pop up bar, a dedicated vertical tasting of your wines over lunch or attaching your wines to a specific event such as a music festival, product launch or awards evening etc.Champagne and Sparkling Wine tasting events are great, though there are many around and some which get great target attendees whereas other are just a money making exercise and no real care to who attends, but how many attend. London is always a great place to be involved with tasting events, many wine professionals live in the region and many people from outside the area of London accept they have to visit the capital in order to taste the best wines throughout the year. Holding a private dinner / lunch for a select group of wine professionals is also a great idea, but do not simply think about inviting the usual people as they are usually attending countless tastings weekly, never refuse an invitation, and your wine will soon be forgotten as they bounce from once invite to another. Instead of usual wine folk, think of fresh people to the industry, those with news columns online, large social media numbers, great photography / videography skills etc. You can also look to join forces with other events taking place, I am always asked if I know of any Champagne / Sparkling Wine labels who would donate bottles of bubbly in return for being a media sponsor to some event or another from weddings to a new watch release - This can be a great way of getting your brand out there and wines tasted, but do research who is asking, what exposure you will receive, the quality of guest list and the amount of wine you will be required to offer - People can be very thirsty at these kind of events!"
