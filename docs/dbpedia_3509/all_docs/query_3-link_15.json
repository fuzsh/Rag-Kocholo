        "text": "Greenville's 2023 Hall of Fame\n\nWilliam W. Brown\n\nPresident\n\nLegacy Advancement\n\nWilliam Brown’s passion is for education, especially for helping children from under-resourced communities realize their dreams of success.\n\nThat passion was the driving force in creating Legacy Early College, the school that Brown founded in 2009. The charter school, which educates students from pre-K through college, serves 1,700 students with an educational model based on “academic excellence, physical education, and superior nutrition.”\n\nLegacy Early College is the largest Title I school in Greenville County.\n\nBrown spent much of his career as a CPA and in the field of investment management before making his mark in the educational world of the Upstate.\n\nHe says he believes that every child can succeed, and he has helped the school to shape its dedication to educating the whole child, an approach that melds social, emotional, and relationship skills with academic excellence. The ultimate goal is to see each student through college.\n\nIn addition to serving as Legacy Early College’s board chair, Brown is the president of Legacy Advancement, which is the central management organization for Legacy Early College.\n\nBrown’s community involvement has included terms serving on the boards of the Peace Center, Greenville Tech Foundation, Greenville Symphony, and Artisphere.\n\nA graduate of The Citadel, Brown says his proudest accomplishment is “seeing young people earn their college education because I know how much it will dramatically increase their quality of life.”\n\nMatt Dunbar\n\nCo-Founder and\n\nManaging Director\n\nVentureSouth\n\nMatt Dunbar is a co-founder of VentureSouth, an investment firm that works with entrepreneurs in the Southeast, providing capital and sharing expertise in the early stages of the process.\n\nThe firm was launched in 2008 when Dunbar helped to create the Upstate Carolina Angel Network (UCAN), which has since become one of the Southeast’s largest and most active investment organizations. The network boasts more than 500 investors in the region.\n\nVentureSouth has been recognized many times as a top 10 angel group in North America and has distributed more than $82 million over 110 countries.\n\nPrior to his work with VentureSouth and UCAN, Dunbar worked as a project leader with the Boston Consulting Group in Atlanta.\n\nA Rock Hill native, Dunbar holds a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Clemson University and an MBS in education from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

He also serves on many corporate boards, including Entegra Bank, Cirtemo, and Zylo Therapeutics.\n\nDunbar says the secret to his success is, “Embrace a growth mindset, learn continuously, treat people well, and work diligently.”\n\nThe accomplishment he is most proud of is “raising three great kids with my lovely wife Katherine.”\n\nJonathan “Jon” Good\n\nCEO\n\nNAI Earle Furman\n\nJonathan Good has worked in commercial real estate for more than two decades, and he has watched Greenville’s phenomenal growth in recent years.\n\nAs CEO of NAI Earle Furman, Good oversees six offices in North Carolina, and his responsibilities include executing the firm’s strategic plan, along with individual and division goal setting and implementation, along with managing shareholder accountability.\n\nSince coming to NAI Earle Furman, Good has led the firm through many mergers and acquisitions of other firms in the Southeast.

He says the secret to his success is, “Recruit the brightest minds. Surround yourself with people who know more than you do. Define transparent expectations. Trust in their capabilities to deliver results. Acknowledge that errors are inevitable yet view each as an opportunity for growth and enhancement.
