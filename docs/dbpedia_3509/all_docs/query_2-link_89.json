        "text": "LITCHFIELD – Never on Monday.\n\nThat’s what Campbell High School boys lacrosse coach Josh Knight feels should be the rule for games, especially big ones, because his team responds better later in the week.\n\nHard to argue with him, as both the 10-2 Cougars and fellow Division III contender Pelham played a sloppy but entertaining contest on Monday. It was one that the Cougars played catchup throughout, but dominated the fourth quarter only to lose 9-8 with nearly two minutes left in sudden death OT on a goal by Python freshman Chris Swiniarski.\n\n“There’s always this Monday lull,” Knight said. “We’ve got to get out of this Monday lull thing. But it’s not an excuse that it’s Monday. We’ve just got to come ready to play.”\n\nThe Cougars recovered from giving up a goal just 32 seconds in and scored twice for a 2-1 lead, but Pelham (10-1) took control with four straight scores and led 5-3 at the half and 7-4 at one point in the third quarter. But the Cougars, sparked by Andrew Willnus’ goal with 44.5 seconds left in the third quarter,went on a run of four straight, playing more like themselves. They eventually regained the lead 8-7 on a goal by Brandon Portillo with 2:07 left and it looked like that would be the difference.\n\n“It was a good battle today,” Knight said, “but we made a good amount of just silly mistakes, either not thinking or reacting the way we’re supposed to. It’ll be a good film for us.”\n\nAnd likely the same for the Pythons, who simply couldn’t hang onto the ball. But they were also resilient, getting the tying goal by Russell Leonard with just 17.9 seconds left and being a man down to send it into overtime.\n\n“It was definitely a great game, but we struggled a bit through the third and fourth quarter, we just turned it over like 15 times in a row,” Pythons coach Brian Johnson said. “It was ridiculous. We played good enough, but we just kept giving the ball away.\n\n“I tell you, though, this team, they don’t give up.They were down five against Laconia with five minutes left and came back and won. Same thing here. They don’t let it bother them. And they believe in each other. They’re a gritty group of kids who just believe.”\n\nCampbell came up empty in the OT on three possessions, the last thanks to a save by Pythons goalie Jacob Jafe, who had seven saves. This time the Pythons, who had given the ball away earlier in OT on a too many men infraction, got the ball downfield quickly and got it to Swiniarski. All he did was blister a shot past Cougars goalie Will O’Brien (good in his own right with nine stops) to end it.\n\nWillnus and Portillo each had three goals while C. Sandquist and H. Grant had a goal apiece. Pelham was paced by three each by Swiniarski and Leonard, plus two by Mason Fredette and one by Cam Cook.\n\nPelham faceoff man Matthew Sprague tries to scoop up the ball while being pressured by Campbell’s Lucas Craig during Monday’s Division III clash in Litchfield. (Telegraph photo by TOM KING)\n\nThe battle between these two evenly matched teams started, though, with a great faceoff war between Campbell’s Lucas Craig and Pelham’s Matthew Sprague, who know each other well. “It starts there, two of the best in the state,” Knight said.\n\n“I can’t say enough about Matthew,” Johnson said. “Lucas for Campbell and Matthew are the two best faceoff guys in the state. They go to training together. For (Sprague) to come up with (a slightly higher percentage) was great.”\n\nThe significance of yesterday? It puts Pelham atop the standings, but Johnson feels there are about seven legitimate contenders. “It’s been pretty competitive this year,” he said.\n\nCampbell, meanwhile, had a taste of what it was like to make the title bout last June, falling to Hopkinton. Now they want to come home with the belt.\n\n“We have a good core group of guys that were in that final last year,” Knight said. “They know what it takes. The overtime game last week kind of helped. Now we’ve been on both sides of it, which will benefit us in the long run.”\n\nThese two teams could certainly see each other again.\n\n“One hundred percent,” Knight said.\n\nThe good news for the Cougars is if they get that far, the finals are on a Saturday.\n\nNewsletter"
