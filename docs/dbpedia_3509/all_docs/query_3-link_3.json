        "text": "For about half a century or so, people who have never bothered to read Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton have been crapping on him based on one supposedly bad line: “It was a dark and stormy night.” Some nights ARE dark and stormy, though. For the record, both Edgar Allan Poe in “A Bargain Lost” and Madeleine L’Engle in “A Wrinkle in Time” have used the exact same line, without detriment to their literary reputations. Look, if it’s good enough for Snoopy, it’s good enough for me.\n\nHere’s another famous Bulwer-Lytton line you might have heard: “The pen is mightier than the sword.” Why not praise him for THAT one? I don’t pretend that we need to resurrect the bulk of Bulwer-Lytton’s work for the masses, in the same way that we don’t need to resurrect Disraeli or George Du Maurier or George Meredith. But I wager there’s plenty of readable stuff in the Lord’s catalogue (I recall enjoying “Alice, or the Mysteries” years ago.) As a successor to Walter Scott, Bulwer-Lytton’s historical romances are considered some of the best in the English language. “The Last Days of Pompeii” remains a tour-de-force. “Rienzi, Last of the Tribunes” was adapted by Wagner and “Harold, Last of the Saxons” was adapted by Verdi. I’m saying it’s probably absurd to pretend the dude sucked, considering both his success and influence.\n\nBulwer-Lytton’s first big hit was 1828’s “Pelham” (“Or Adventures of a Gentleman”) a bildungsroman/ roman-a-clef that caused minor societal convulsions: some characters were recognizable, merciless lampoons of Victorian celebs. The novel is cosmopolitan in its frankness, far from the stuffiness one associates with an era in which, the joke goes, people covered those sexy piano “legs” out of prudishness. (If anyone did cover piano legs, it was just for an excessive love of decoration.)\n\nStill, “Pelham” is pretty out there for the 1820s! It begins with young Henry Pelham matter-of-factly reminiscing on his parents near-divorce:\n\n“The end of the season was unusually dull, and so my mother decided to elope with her new lover.” Lady Pelham’s elopement goes comically awry when, just before getting into her lover’s coach, she remembers to go back for her favorite china and her French poodle… and accidentally runs into Lord Pelham, who is forced to pretend to be upset about the infidelity in front of the servants: “Had they met each other alone, the affair might easily have been settled, and Lady Frances gone off in tranquillity. Those damned servants are always in the way!” Young Pelham has since consoled himself: “I have, however, often thought that it was better for me that the affair ended in this manner, since it is frequently inconvenient to have a divorced mother.”\n\nAnd a mother like Lady Frances Pelham is priceless, with so much endless wisdom for her son that she might as well have also birthed Oscar Wilde. Some of her lines:\n\n“In marriage a man lowers a woman to his own rank; in an affair, he raises himself to hers.”\n\n“A fool, my dear Henry, flatters himself; a wise man flatters the fool.”\n\n“It is very different with French people than with our countrymen; in France, it is acceptable to seem to have emotions.”\n\nPelham clearly benefited from his mother’s witticisms.\n\nOf a bleak, desolate, barren seashore, he says: “a spot upon which any creature would have starved, except perhaps a seagull or a Scotsman.”\n\nOf his (mis) education studying Greek and Roman classics at Eton: “I didn’t learn a syllable of English, but I spent 8 years acquiring a great amount of information which, as you can imagine, I entirely forgot by the age of 25.”\n\nHis rank as nobility earns him an “honorary” degree at Cambridge, “which is the opposite of those honorable degrees obtained by pale people with spectacles after 36 months of exertions.”\n\nWe follow Henry as he travels through France with an acquaintance, the sarcastic Lord Vincent, “one of those writers who are promising young talents well into their seventies, and who are always working on something which is going to be published any day now.” (Attack felt.) Lord Vincent has the habit of following every withering putdown with a Greek or Latin quotation; (here is hard to tell whether Bulwer-Lytton is knowingly mocking himself, or if this is a case of “Potus vocatio Kettleus nigreos” (Horace.)\n\nBut it’s Pelham’s friendship with the mysterious Reginald Glanville that gives the novel its shape: Pelham tries to solve the mystery behind his friend’s bizarre behavior, while romancing Reginald’s sister, Ellen. Also, there’s murder afoot; so much so that in “Pelham” earns the distinction of being considered, however loosely, one of the earliest “detective” novels in Stephen Knight’s “Chronology of Crime Fiction.”\n\n“Pelham” is not just a shallow social satire with mystery and romantic elements, though. The young gentleman also gets to witness the more serious intellectual exchanges of the period. Here’s some Parisian salon repartee, which might as well be Bulwer-Lytton’s meditation upon his own novel’s durability:\n\n“Works that treat man in his relation to society, can only be strictly applicable so long as that relation and that society do not change. The play which satirizes a particular class, however deep its reflections, must necessarily be obsolete when the class itself has become so. The political pamphlet admirable for one state, may be absurd in another. The novel which exactly delineates the present age will seem strange and unfamiliar to the next. These works must often confine their popularity to the age and the country in which they were written. But the work that seizes, discovers, and analyzes the human mind as it is, whether ancient or modern, savage or European, is useful to all times and all nations. He who discovers the origin of ideas must be a philosopher to every person who has ideas; but he who delineates the manners of one country or one age is only the philosopher of that country and that age. Yet Hume holds the contrary opinion to this, and considers a good comedy of manners more durable than a system of philosophy. Hume is right, of course… if a system of philosophy is understood to be a pile of guesses, false but plausible, set up by one age to be destroyed by the next. Ingenuity cannot rescue Error from oblivion; but when Wisdom has discovered Truth, she has obtained Immortality.”\n\n(The punchline, though, is that Pelham almost falls asleep listening to this exchange.)\n\nIf the era interests you at all, “Pelham” is a surprisingly fast-paced read, and superior to a lot of more “nutritional” stuff that has been prescribed by joyless literary dieticians. Kind of like a Jane Austen novel, if Jane Austen had been funny or gotten laid.*\n\n*#bookstagram, hold the fatwa."
