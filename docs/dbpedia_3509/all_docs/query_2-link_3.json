His devotion to training within the traditional formats of hindustani music have provided him with respect and love for the ever unfolding wisdom of sound while his diverse experiences across countries, genres, people and vocations have given him the conviction that art is to serve a greater purpose of spirituality and justice. Besides hindustani music he performs experimental compositions, collaborations with dance and other creative formats. He has had the privilege to work with the Pittsburgh Opera and Brooklyn Raga Massive and was awarded an Individual Artist Grant from The Saratoga Arts Council which he used to conceive and launch Folk Song, an emergent ensemble inspired by the forms of hindustani and Irish Trad.\n\n@galenpassen\n\ngamin is a distinguished NYC soloist who tours the world performing both traditional Korean music and cross-disciplinary collaborations. gamin plays piri (double reed Korean oboe), taepyeonso (double-reed horn), and saenghwang (mouth organ).
