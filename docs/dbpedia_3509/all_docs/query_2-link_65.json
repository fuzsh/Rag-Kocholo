        "text": "About the Program\n\nThe Scholastic Art & Writing Awards are the nationâ€™s largest, longest-running, and most prestigious scholarship and recognition program for middle and high school artists and writers. Since 1923, the Awards have recognized teenagers from across the country. By receiving a Scholastic Art & Writing Award, our students join a legacy of celebrated authors and artists such as Andy Warhol, Sylvia Plath, Truman Capote, Stephen King, Robert Redford, and Ezra Jack Keats.\n\nThe Alabama Awards Program received more than 300 submissions in 11 categories from students across the state of Alabama. On June 29, 2022, awards were presented at the Alabama Scholastic Art & Writing Awards Program during the Gulf Coast Conference on the Teaching of Writing, in 3 award levels: Gold Key (the very best works submitted to local programs); Silver Key (stand-out works submitted to local programs that demonstrate exceptional ability); and Honorable Mention (accomplished works submitted to local programs showing great skill and potential).\n\nThe Wiregrass Writing Project, Troy University, is pleased to present the 2022 Alabama Art & Writing Awards online exhibit. This exhibition features the awards given in each category and a selection of works for your reading enjoyment.\n\nTo learn more about the Alabama Scholastic Art & Writing Awards contact us at http://artandwriting.org or 334-670-5978.\n\nMessage from the Executive Director of the Alliance of Young Artist and Writers"
