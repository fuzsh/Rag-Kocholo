Here was a gorgeously crafted Adagio for Strings that had a new voice, but with the same hauntingly lush harmonies and intensity that makes the string orchestra such a beautiful vehicle in the concert hall. After recording it, I was even more convinced that In Memory – H.H.L. has a real place in the standard string orchestra literature. As a conductor we are often looking for that five minute adagio to fit into our programming, and now we have a second option to the Barber from a wonderful living American composer.”\n\nThe work is part of Naxos’ Symphony of Seasons and other orchestral works CD (8.559337), performed by Maestro Trevor and the Slovak Radio Orchestra.

This will be part of a concert to dedicate the church’s new David Harris organ console.\n\nThe composer writes about the new work, “My Trumpets of Light (A Suite in Four Movements for Trumpet & Organ) was composed between March and June 2011. It is dedicated to my brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Mr. & Mrs. Mark J. Welshimer, who funded the commission from The Reformed Church of Bronxville New York (Matthew Phelps, Minister of Music and Eugene Lavery, Associate Director of Music) for the Autumn 2011 dedication of the church’s new David Harris organ console. Approximately fourteen minutes in length, each movement of Trumpets of Light is extra-musically inspired by a biblical scripture. The common thread of these scriptures is light, an understandable link given the fact that the beautiful Reformed Church’s natural light sources are the 1944-1945 windows by Boston stain-glass artist, Charles J. Connick. Linking the movements together musically is one melodic idea, first heard in Proclamation, which is transformed in each movement. Economical harmonic movement is also a trait of each movement.” Trumpets of Light is published by Subito Music.\n\nThe October 23 program will also include a selection of organ masterworks.

To learn more…\n\nThe composer has written the following about the new work, “My Concerto for Organ and Orchestra is cast in three movements. Approximately twenty minutes in length, the composition is cyclic in nature with all movements being linked by that most basic of harmonic materials, the triad. Further, the 11th century plainsong melody, Divinum mysterium, is at the heart and soul of the serene middle movement. Even as the opening movement begins and ends with music of grandeur, the Concerto concludes with the highly rhythmic and driving third movement, the Toccata. I am very excited about this new concerto commission for the 2011 Region IV AGO Convention in Greensboro, North Carolina!”\n\nTickets for the June 29 concert are $15 and can be obtained by calling 336-653-0201 or visiting this site.\n\nMarch 2011\n\n» Organ Music of Dan Locklair at Memorial Presbyterian Church in St. Augustine, Florida on March 19.\n\nComposer Dan Locklair’s St. John’s Suite will be performed by organist Jonathan Easter on Saturday, March 19 – 12 noon at Memorial Presbyterian Church, 36 Sevilla Street in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nThe suite was written in 2007 and consists of four movements: 1.

The titles of each movement are taken from Mr. Herbert’s 17th century poem. Though none of the movements of this fourteen-minute suite are lengthy, Movements I, IV and VII are the longest and provide the girders of the composition. Movements II / III and V / VI are miniatures and represent dance movements that have traditionally been paired.”\n\nGlory and Peace is published by Subito Music Publishing. The piece was commissioned by the AAM for their 2009 National Conference in Los Angeles. More about the conference at"
