        "text": "The Metamorphosis (Bulgaria)\n\nDirector: Pencho Dimitrov\n\n29 min / Bulgarian / Drama, Fantasy / color / 2014\n\nOne casual morning, the daily life of Gregor Samsa takes a strange turn when he is transformed into a gigantic bug, and he is forced to endure the disparaging attitude of his family and society towards him. “The Metamorphosis” adheres rigidly to the original novella by Franz Kafka, and just as powerfully shows us how a sudden change is perceived as a monstrous metamorphosis.\n\nWatch Trailer\n\nVenue: Walhaja / Date: 27th Nov 2015 / Time: 13:00\n\nGarden of Eden (Israel)\n\nDirector: Ran Tal\n\n60 min / Hebrew, English subtitles / Documentary / color / 2012\n\nGarden of Eden is the story of Gan HaShlosha, better known as the “Sakhne”, one of the largest, most famous and most visited parks in Israel. During the spring, summer, fall and winter seasons of one full year, the film documents the park’s transformation, and with a spectacular expression of cinematic beauty, it tells the stories of the people who visit the park and work therein. Yaacov, whose wife left him and who has since been living a sad and lonely existence; Athir, who is planning to move to Canada because life in Israel does not enable him to reach his full potential; Yael, who was forced to wed at the age of 13 and suffered many years of physical and mental abuse; Itzhak, who has yet to recover from the death of his brother in war and seeks a refuge from the mourning in the cool waters. These are but some of the captivating and touching individuals which the camera encounters. Director Ran Tal studies the innermost parts of Israeli society with humor, beauty, pain and compassion in the least expected location – a recreation park.\n\nVenue: Walhaja / Date: 27th Nov 2015 / Time: 17:30"
