        "text": "Head of Film & Television\n\nDr Kingsley Marshall is Head of Film and Television at the CILECT and ScreenSkills accredited School of Film and Television, based within Falmouth University, UK. The department consists of over 40 staff working with over 700 undergraduate students across four degrees (BA Animation, BA Film, BA Post Production & Visual Effects, BA Television and Film Production), supplemented by a postgraduate community studying from MA level through to PhD, delivered online and on campus. He is an external examiner for the MA International Creative Enterprise at Edge Hill University, in addition to the online BA and MA filmmaking courses at Raindance Film School (DMU) and the on-campus filmmaking courses at Edinburgh Napier University.\n\nAs the RKE lead for Screen Practice: Research and the Development Lead and a Producer in the Sound/Image Cinema Lab, a research and film production centre at Falmouth University, Kingsley is involved in short and feature film production with partners including Bosena, Film4, o-Region, Early Day Films, BBC Films, and Storm Force Films. He was executive producer on the feature films \"Wilderness\" (Director: Justin John Doherty) and \"The Tape\" (Director: Martha Tilston), both commercially released in 2021, \"Long Way Back\" (Director: Brett Harvey) released in cinemas in 2022, and \"Enys Men\" (Director: Mark Jenkin), which premiered in Cannes and was released in 2023 through the BFI in the UK and Neon in the US. Kingsley contributed to the ScreenSkills public-facing report Hybrid Work Experience Guidelines for UK Educators (FE and HE) and Screen Industry Employers published in 2022, and to the Catalysing the Cornwall Screen Sector report, which received national press attention in 2023 in its provision of a roadmap that furthered the part that universities can play in screen production.\n\nWith his own company Myskatonic, Kingsley produced \"Backwoods\" (Director: Ryan Mackfall), included in the BluRay release of definitive horror documentary \"Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror\" (Dir. Kier-La Janisse, 2021) and completed production of \"The Birdwatcher\" (Director: Ryan Mackfall) in 2024, in addition to line producing music videos for Amon Amarth in 2022 and Bruce Dickinson in 2023. He has a number of feature film projects and a TV documentary series in development. As a composer Kingsley worked with director Mark Jenkin (\"Bait\", \"Enys Men\"), writing the score for \"Hard, Cracked the Wind\" (2019), with Rachael Jones on \"Dean Quarry\" (2021), and with Paul Mulraney on the documentaries \"From the Culch\" (2023) and the forthcoming \"Redfish\".\n\nKingsley's academic research focuses on film and television production, music and sound in film and TV, and the representation and use of emergent technologies in screen media, including Artificial Intelligence. He has published widely and speaks regularly at international conferences, including events at University of Oxford, New York University, and as an invited speaker for Screenskills, Birmingham University and the School of Advanced Studies, University of London.\n\nKingsley co-edited the collection \"Philosophical Reflections on Black Mirror\", published by Bloomsbury in 2022.\n\nForthcoming are a chapter on film music in \"Call Me By Your Name\" for a collection edited by Edward Lamberti and Michael Williams for Intellect Books, a chapter on music use for a new collection on George A. Romero, and two pieces on Enys Men, for The Soundtrack journal and a collection on climate change for Peter Lang Publishing.\n\nKingsley regularly interviews filmmakers, most recently publishing pieces on Anna Biller (\"The Love Witch\", \"Diva\") and Ukrainian filmmaker Iryna Tsilyk (\"The Earth is as Blue as an Orange\") for the MAI Journal. Prior to joining Falmouth University, Kingsley served as a critic and has written about popular culture - from film and music through to video games, the internet and literature - for over 30 publications. His writing has featured on the BBC and MTV, in Little White Lies, anthologies on hip hop and soul, and countless sleeve notes and biographies.\n\nExternal Links\n\nLinkedIn: Kingsley Marshall\n\nIMDb\n\nTwitter: Kingsley Marshall\n\nContact details\n\nKingsley Marshall 1\n\nKingsley Marshall 2\n\nphilosophical_reflections_on_black_mirror_-_vis02.jpg\n\nbigelow_interviews_1000.jpg\n\neno_obliquemusic_1000.jpg\n\nReading Westworld book cover\n\nTwin Peaks - Kingsley Marshall\n\nQualifications\n\nQualifications\n\nYear Qualification Awarding body 2023 PGCert Strategic Management & Leadership Chartered Management Institute 2018 PhD in Film: The Gulf War Aesthetic?
