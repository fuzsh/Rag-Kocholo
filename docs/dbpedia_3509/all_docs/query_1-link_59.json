        "text": "It takes an anarchist to know one. And it took Norman Nawrocki, Montreal playwright, musician, novelist and anarcho-artist-activist to create MARUSYA NIKIFOROVA: Ukraine’s legendary anarchist warrior. First mounted in 2023, at the 16th annual Montreal International Anarchist Theatre Festival, the one-act, 30-minute play is screening on YouTube until March 8, International Women’s Day, as a fundraiser for the Ukrainian resistance – feminists, environmentalists, anarchists and activists, working on the frontlines against Russian invaders and occupiers.\n\nYou can take in the teleplay on Nawrocki’s YouTube channel here: https://youtu.be/Lv05Vd9n1iY and watch for the prompts in the show credits to donate to the Ukrainian resistance group Solidarity Collectives.\n\nMaria Hryhorivna Nikiforova (1885–1919), better known as Marusya, was born in Oleksandrivsk — present-day Zaporizhzhia — a strategic location on the banks of the Dnieper River. Maryusa’s father had fought as an officer in the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878. After leaving home at 16, the androgenous teenager (actually intersex) found whatever work she could to support herself and wound up on a factory floor washing bottles in a vodka distillery. Taking up with a communist anarchist group, Maryusa engaged in terrorist acts against the Russian empire, including bombing, expropriation of property and armed robbery.\n\nImprisoned in 1908, she served time in exile in Siberia, incited a prison riot and once released, joined the international anarchist movement, saw action with anarchists in Spain, enlisted with the French Foreign Legion and fought on the Macedonian front against the Russian empire.\n\nThe outbreak of the 1917 Russian revolution forced Nikiforova back to Oleksandrivsk (Aleksandrovsk), where she took up active combat against the Bolsheviks, collaborating with other anarchist/soldiers to form the Ukrainian Peoples Republic of Soviets. She stole from the rich to support the poor, led armed militia into battle and was a chief resistor of and terrorist toward the Bolsheviks and later the White army. Nikiforova even accepted a mission to assassinate Alexander Kolchak, Supreme Ruler of Russia.\n\nMaryusa’s heroic, ceaseless fight to defend Ukrainians against the Russian state stands as profound inspiration for the Ukrainian armed forces and the brave civilian resisters acting against the ongoing Russian assault on their country.\n\nShe and her Polish anarchist husband Witold Brzostek were arrested on August 11, 1919 in Crimea, where they had planned to assassinate the White army’s commander-in-chief Anton Denikin. Court-martialed and sentenced to execution by firing squad, they were both shot to death, Nikiforova first having tearfully bid her husband good-bye.\n\nNawrocki, himself of Ukrainian-Polish descent, has created a stirring, succinct, one-hander, employing an overhead voice as narrator and projections of archival photos to set the scene. His star, Ukrainian actor Mariya Hadubyak, a Montrealer since her immigration to Canada in 2022, performs with the Ukrainian troupe Sozhary. She gives life and soul to Maryusa under Nawrocki’s spirited direction. Vancouver-based musician and composer Vivian Nawrocki (Nawrocki’s sister) created the soundtrack. Producer Babushka Theatre is a Montreal theatre laboratory dedicated to the staging of Ukrainian-Canadian[1]Polish plays.\n\nThe YouTube run ends March 8; time enough to show our solidarity with the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nMARUSYA NIKIFOROVA: Ukraine’s legendary anarchist warrior\n\nWritten and directed by Norman Nawrocki\n\nPerformed by Mariya Hadubyak\n\nSoundtrack by Vivian Nawrocki\n\nProduced by Babushka Theatre\n\nScreening on YouTube until March 8 at https://youtu.be/Lv05Vd9n1iY\n\nFor more information about the Ukrainian resistance, go to https://www.solidaritycollectives.org/en/main-page-english\n\nPhoto: Mariya Hadubyak as Maryusa Nikiforova in Paris, 1912-13, where she met with international anarchists and Russian exiles.\n\nPhil Comeau is an experienced francophone filmmaker with a long list of documentaries and features to his name. But even he looks a bit stunned by what he’s finding out about his father as he researches l’Ordre de Jacques Cartier in the NFB film The Secret Order.\n\nThe secret society established in 1926 was truly underground, its members recruited mainly through the church and its aims and rituals kept secret for life among most members.\n\nA sinister air surrounds the francophone society as Comeau recreates an initiation ceremony in a very effective dramatization. The young men, having assembled at some point, don eye-masks for a blindfolded journey to an underground chamber. They must put a hand on the shoulder of the man in front and are led then by a member of the order to submit to five “ordeals” that will determine if they have what it takes to belong to Jacques Cartier brotherhood. These tests involve holding a hand over a candle, walking a plank and having their heads held under water. In the film, one initiate decides the order is not for him. The ritual, led by a grand chief in a blue satin sash, was to show how solidarity was as important as secrecy in the operations of the order.\n\nThe Secret Order follows Comeau, a New Brunswick-born francophone, in his search through multiple archives to uncover the purpose of the secret society. The Jacques Cartier order was born of necessity: to assert the rights of French Canadians. Long before the 1963 Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, it was only through the Ordre de Jacques Cartier that francophones could establish the right to use their own language in their own country.\n\nEnglish oppression was so bad that as one Acadian former member of the order recalls, he was reprimanded by his boss at the post office for speaking French to a French-speaking customer.\n\nFor Phil Comeau, investigation into the order that his father was a member of was freighted with personal revelations. In one of the archives, he finds his father’s membership card. In another cache of materials, the actual eye coverings used in the initiation ritual. And his searches lead him to living family members as well as former members of the order, most of whom have never spoken of the secret society for a public audience.\n\nSecrecy was paramount so each chapter or cell of L’Ordre de Jacques Cartier—as many as 850 across the country comprising 72,000 members—kept to itself. The goal was representation in government, in banks and on school boards, but recruitment focused on the rural population, which was where most Canadian francophones lived in the early 20th century.\n\nBy 1965, after Quebeckers began to agitate for their rights, the order was disbanded. However, The Secret Order is a testament to the many men (only one woman was ever made a member of the order) who helped secure the French language and francophone culture in Canada on a permanent basis. Among the prominent names were onetime mayor of Montreal Jean Drapeau and the first francophone premier of New Brunswick, Louis Robichaud.\n\nNo longer secret, L’Ordre de Jacques Cartier made an important contribution to Canadian democracy.\n\nThe Secret Order https://www.nfb.ca/film/the-secret-order/.\n\nThe imagineNATIVE film + media arts festival gets better and better, morphing easily in 2020 into a cyber affair with lots to click on. Two feature films make this year’s fest a feast for readers as well as media consumers. Cree/ Métis director Loretta Todd co-wrote and directed Monkey Beach, a sensitive adaptation of Eden Robinson’s 2000 novel of the same name. It’s the story of Lisa Hill who has fled her Haisla village of Kitamaat for life in the big city of Vancouver and returns to undergo a healing process and come to terms with her personal past. What you need to know is that Lisa is gifted with the power to communicate with the dead. The script creaks a little, but performances by Grace Dove, Adam Beach, Glen Gould and especially Tina Lameman make up for such faults.\n\nThomas King wrote the book that Métis/Algonquin director actor Michelle Latimer, adapted for the screen, as Inconvenient Indian. An NFB/90th Parallel co-production, already lauded with the People’s Choice Award at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival, Inconvenient Indian is nothing short of brilliant. Latimer cast King in a starring position, as a movie-goer riding in the back of a Co-op cab. As King tells the story of Coyote and the duck feathers, his driver transforms into a grinning coyote. And so it goes, a riveting documentary that brings the undeniable truths of An Inconvenient Indian to the big screen.\n\nThe 21st imagineNATIVE festival presents work from 153 Indigenous artists from 13 countries and 97 Indigenous nations. In addition to 10 feature films, organizers have put together four short film programs, two guest-curated programs and one artist spotlight, on Cree video artist Thirza Cuthand with a screening of her video Thirza Cuthand is an Indian within the Meaning of the Indian Act.\n\nThis year’s winner of the August Schellenberg Award of Excellence is Squamish BC actor Lorne Cardinal, a well known thespian who performed in Schellenberg’s all-indigenous production of King Lear at the National Arts Centre. He’ll be presented with the award on Sunday, October 25, when all the other festival prizes are handed out.\n\nIn addition to the annual art crawl, imagineNATIVE sponsors exhibitions, industry talks, a pitch session and a keynote address from Tantoo Cardinal.\n\nHere are some films that make this year’s festival particularly appealing. Shadow of Dumont is a feature film from Métis director Trevor Cameron, who sets out from Toronto to look for his roots in the story of Gabriel Dumont, leader of the 1885 Métis uprising in Saskatchewan. Brother, I Cry, written and directed by Jessie Anthony, a Haudenosaunee woman born and raised on the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, looks at how cultural practices play a part in healing those suffering the pain of addiction. A Canadian premiere, Māori/Pasifika director/producer Kiel McNaughton’s The Legend of Baron To’a is the story of a young Tongan man dealing with the legacy of a superstar father who was a wrestler. Atua is a New Zealand film that imagines Atua Kahu, the last man standing in a world destroyed by disease. The film, directed and written by Brown Bitty Muaupoko, Ngai Tara, Ngati Raukawa and Ngati Huia, came out of NATIVE Slam, an international collaborative event that gives indigenous directors 72 hours to make a movie together.\n\nImagineNATIVE runs through Sunday October 25. For information on tickets, free events and daily schedules, go to https://festival.imaginenative.org/in2020\n\nPhoto: Still from Inconvenient Indian\n\nAt the Venice Biennale this summer visitors lingered long at the Canadian pavilion, captivated by One Day in the Life of Noah Piugattuk, as it played on three big screens, subtitled in Italian, French and English. A production of the Baffin Island Isuma collective, One Day is directed by Zacharias Kunuk and compellingly presents a story, in Inuktitut, of a day in 1961 when Noah (Apayata Kotierk) and his clan, out on the ice to hunt and trade, spy an approaching dog team and sled. This turns out to be a white man named Boss (Kim Bodnia), a Canadian government official who has come to tell Noah and his companions that they must prepare to leave their way of life and join a community where their children will go to school. Adding to the poignancy and authenticity of the film is the understood notion that the Inuit culture faces a still greater peril in the form of climate change and the melting of the polar sea ice.\n\nTonight, the film screens at Toronto’s Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema Hot Docs at the opening of the 20th edition of the imagineNATIVE Film & Media Arts Festival, 18 years after the opening night screening of Kunuk’s ground-breaking Atanarjuat The Fast Runner. imagineNATIVE, the largest indigenous festival of its kind in the world, serves as a platform, for first nations’ film and media and encompasses a professional development component, the imagineNATIVE Institute, as well as an awards program.\n\nFrom tonight through Sunday, October 27, imagineNATIVE will present 126 film and video works in 30 languages from 18 countries and 101 indigenous nations, including nine features, 13 documentary features, and 12 short film programs. Watch for The Incredible 25th Year of Mitzi Bearclaw, a touching feature directed by Shelly Niro, starring MorningStar Angeline and featuring the amazing Billy Merasty as Mitzi’s father.\n\nThe outstanding filmmaker Alanis Obamsawin returns to the festival with an NFB production, Jordan River Anderson, the Messenger. This documentary tells the story of a Cree child born with overwhelming challenges and how a dispute over his care led to major changes in access to healthcare for indigenous peoples in Canada.\n\nAmong many short films of note, the 2001 Gwishalaayt – The Spirit Wraps Around You celebrates the life and work of ‘Namgis filmmaker Barb Cranmer, who died earlier this year. She was from the important Kwakwaka’wakw family in Alert Bay, British Columbia that did so much for the continuance and preservation of their art and culture.\n\nWik vs Queensland is a 2018 feature documentary from Australia directed by Dean Gibson relates how the aboriginal people of Wik take on the Queensland government and land developers to ensure rights to their traditional lands.\n\nAmong special events in the festival is a Friday presentation at the Art Gallery of Ontario of Lisa Reihana’s In Pursuit of Venus [infected], a multi-channel projection and immersive experience followed by a conversation with curator Julie Nagam. And on Thursday, the popular imagineNATIVE Art Crawl takes in five galleries with visual art works, curatorial and artist talks and a live performance, starting at Onsite Gallery and ending at the Toronto Media Arts Centre.\n\nimagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival\n\nOctober 22-27, 2019 at Toronto locations\n\nFor more information call 416.585.2333 or visit www.imagineNATIVE.org\n\nPhoto: Still from One Day in the Life of Noah Piugattuk\n\nJustice for Colten. Emblazoned on sweatshirts, written on protest signs, shouted by demonstrators and spoken in reply to any question about what the family of the murdered young Cree man Colten Boushie is seeking, becomes the running theme of Tasha Hubbard’s riveting documentary, nîpawistamâsowin: We Will Stand Up. By the end of the film, named Best Canadian Feature at Hot Docs 2019, there is little doubt that the Canadian justice system failed in the handling of the case, a message carried all the way to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.\n\nWe Will Stand Up, which screens June 26 and 27 at Cinecenta at the University of Victoria, is an even-handed presentation of a story told from the perspective of the Cree community that gathered together to protest not just Boushie’s death but the systemic racism that resulted in the acquittal of the man who shot him in the back of the head.\n\nColten Boushie was a smart little boy who grew up on the Cree reserve of Red Pheasant, on the prairie northeast of Saskatoon. He was just 22 on the evening of August 9, 2016, when he and some friends were caught on the property of Gerald Stanley, who shot Boushie at close range with a restricted handgun.\n\nHubbard, a Cree filmmaker from the Peepeekisis First Nation in Saskatchewan, details the circumstances that led to Colten’s killing and reveals the depth of hatred expressed by the non-native rural inhabitants toward the Cree. “This is conflicted territory,” she says, “and Stanley’s actions have exposed longstanding wounds.” Red Pheasant is located on Treaty Six lands where the Cree were starved out in the late 1800s to make way for the railroad and violently suppressed when they fought in under leaders like Big Bear in what became known as the Northwest Rebellion. Eight warriors were tried, without representation, convicted and hanged in 1885.\n\nThe longstanding enmity plays out in the wake of Colten’s death. At the trial in Battleford, Stanley’s lawyers eliminate any potential jury members who are indigenous. The all-white jury declares Stanley not guilty of second-degree murder and an appeal of the verdict is turned down.\n\nTwo women emerge as the heroines of this story: Colten’s mother Debbie Baptiste and his sister Jade Tootoosis who becomes the spokesperson for the family and carries their case to Ottawa to meet MPs and Prime Minister Trudeau and then on to the UN in New York, where her testimony gets a standing ovation.\n\nJustice for Colten becomes a cry for justice for all indigenous peoples caught in a system stacked against them. Hubbard’s film stands as a remarkable testament to the calm determination, dignity and united front Colton’s family and his community exhibit in the battle to balance the scales of justice.\n\nnîpawistamâsowin: We Will Stand Up\n\nWritten and directed by Tasha Hubbard\n\nA co-production of Downstream Documentary Productions and the National Film Board of Canada\n\nScreening at Cinecenta, University of Victoria, June 26 and 27 at 7 and 9 pm\n\nPhoto of Colten Boushie driving with his mother Debbie Baptiste\n\nChristopher Auchter, creator of the brilliant Haida short film The Mountain of SGaana has strong words of gratitude for his Auntie Shelley, who gave him the opportunity to attend high school in Victoria. For medical reasons, she had moved to the city from Haida Gwaii, where Christopher’s secondary school had only 145 students. His aunt’s invitation to move in with her led to graduation from Oak Bay High School, where he’d advanced his art and woodworking skills and gained admission to Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver. There he focused on hand-drawn animation techniques. A year in the computer animation program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario gave him the 3D digital skills that the market was then looking for.\n\nAuchter got a foot in the door with the National Film Board when he was hired to do the charcoal drawings for the short animated film How People Got Fire (2008) directed by Daniel Janke. His career was launched.\n\nCompleted in 2017, The Mountain of SGaana is a wordless depiction in delightful hand-drawn imagery, of a Haida tale told to a fisherman by Mousewoman, a favourite Haida creature from the spirit world. Mousewoman knits a blanket that illustrates the story of sea hunter Naa-Naa-Simgat and his beloved Kuuga Kuns. SGaana (Haida for killer whale) captures the hunter who has been taking his prey and takes him to the underwater world. Kuuga Kuns dives in to save him.\n\n“In the original tale, it is the wife who is captured and Naa-Naa-Simgat who saves her. “I switched the roles,” says Auchter, “because I was surrounded by so many strong Haida women, especially my Auntie Shelley. I wanted to show that strength in my telling of the story.” Having made the choice to eliminate dialogue from his film, Auchter brought in music. Another of the strong women in his life, his sister Nikita Toya Auchter, sings a Haida song to accompany the animation.\n\nWhat makes this short so distinctive is the incorporation of Haida motifs. Auchter is the great-great-great grandson of Charles Edenshaw (1839-1920), the carver most associated with the preservation of Haida art forms, which had nearly disappeared after European contact.\n\nThe Mountain of SGaana has done well on the festival circuit and on Wednesday at the Capital 6 cinemas in Victoria it is coming home. Through an arrangement with the NFB, the Capital 6 Indie Film Series will present a short ahead of its feature film. Auchter’s short will precede a screening of This Mountain Life, a documentary directed by Grant Baldwin.\n\nThe Mountain of SGaana\n\nDrawn and directed by Christopher Auchter\n\nScreening Wednesday, November 14, 7 p.m. at The Capital 6, Victoria, BC\n\nThe scenes you see in Metamorphosis span the planet and are at once devastating, in the record they provide of global warming’s destruction of the environment, and heart-lifting, in showing the ways that the human imagination drives survival.\n\nMetamorphosis is the term for a biological process — an animal’s growth and maturation — during which time the creature’s physical structure can radically change; from egg to butterfly, for instance. Velcrow Ripper and his co-director and life partner Novi Ami, gave that name to their extraordinary film, now on the western leg of its Canadian launch, because when they started thinking about this film, they were inspired by the life cycle of a monarch butterfly.\n\nTheir documentary, shot on a grand, cinematic scale, charts the ways in which humans and other life forms are adapting to their changed environment and undergoing a kind of metamorphosis.\n\n“We can move this paradigm,” says Ripper, speaking of losses due to climate change. “But we have to figure out how to live in a symbiotic relationship [with changed conditions on earth]. And part of that shift is a cultural shift, a psychological and emotional shift and artists are part of that shift.”\n\nScientists, thinkers, writers, artists and architects became their collaborators and provided the narrative heard in voiceovers.\n\n“Something going from one state to another that you couldn’t have anticipated,” says Sue Halpern, author of Four Wings and a Prayer, about metamorphosis. “We actually have a choice about what that metamorphosis looks like.”\n\nRobert J. Lifton, psychiatrist and author of The Climate Swerve, reminds us we are capable of redirecting our imaginations to confront climate truths, thus replicating a form of metamorphosis in the service of human evolution.\n\nOn a budge of just under $1-million (“We use our resources wisely,” says Ami), the couple embarked on the project as co-writers and directors around the same time their son Phoenix was conceived. Now three-and-a-half years old, the little guy accompanied his parents through some of the most challenging shoots of the project.\n\nWith curiosity as their guide, Ripper and Ami made some amazing discoveries, as they travelled from the Philippines, where Typhoon Haiyan had struck, killing more than 6,000 people, to Milan, Venice, Toronto, where Alpha school students were working on a project to provide plants for migrating butterflies to stock up on, to several locations in North and Central America.\n\nIn the American southwest, they met Dennis McClung, founder and CEO of Garden Pool. He and his helpers are converting swimming pools that no one can fill anymore because of drought, into backyard biospheres, where with the right tweaking, plant and animal life can thrive.\n\n“We wanted to offer the film as a poem,” says Ami. Seamlessly integrated into the film, is the work of artists such as Jean-Paul Bourdier, photographer, painter and performance director and creator of an arresting scene near the opening of the documentary, shows painted bodies on a sandy beach.\n\nSculptor Jason DeCaires Taylor sinks his statues in the ocean, so they become the sites of coral gardens and other marine life colonies.\n\nMichael Reynolds, a New Mexico architect, is interviewed at the site of one of his Earthships, passive, self-sufficient, solar houses, designed to look as if they grew out of the earth they sit on. “If we could make it so that every human on this planet has everything they need, without anything centralized,” he says, “. . . . all of a sudden, stress is gone. Humans would morph into their next phase of evolution.”\n\nMetamorphosis opens with a caterpillar (“we’re like that,” says one commentator, “eating everything in sight”) and then we see the chrysalis, the emerging butterfly. At the end of the documentary, some very tricky photography captures the thousands of monarch butterflies at the end of their winter migration to Mexico. The words of Homero Aridjis, Mexican poet and environmentalist, are subtitled on the screen. Layered one on top of another on a big tree trunk, the butterflies, he says, “are like a single organism,” trembling with life.\n\nMetamorphosis screenings with Nova Ami and Velcrow Ripper presenting:\n\nJune 20, Globe Cinema, Calgary; June 22, Metro Cinema, Edmonton; June 24, Cinecenta, UVic, Victoria; June 26, Vancity Theatre, Vancouver\n\nPhoto of work by Jean-Paul Bourdier courtesy of the National Film Board\n\nAn important project, Solo Dance Xchange brings together 22 performers — on screen and live – from a broad spectrum of dance disciplines.\n\nIntroduced by producers Karen and Allen Kaeja, the show combines a film in which each of the dancers improvises a dance in the location of his/her choice and a staged segment when the dancers do two-to-three-minute solos accompanied by live music from Eric Cadesky, Laurel MacDonald and Phil Strong.\n\nThe outcome? Some predictably fine performances, some merely predictable and a few quite surprising delights.\n\nAllen Kaeja’s 30-minute film, XTOD: Moments in Reel Time, is a nicely edited panoply of 22 dancers doing minute-long improvised solos in locations of their own choosing. Using only natural light, DOP Hernan Morris captures some lovely movement, but the footage lacks the finesse of a studio dance film. By virtue of the subject matter, the HD video reels feels improvised.\n\nMany performers chose water settings, and even long-time Toronto residents will be surprised by the natural beauty found within the confines of Hogtown. Some are romanticized: Jasmyn Fyffe walks a watery concrete pier in a flowing robe; Claudia Moore goes pagan atop the giant rock in Yorkville; Karen Kaeja gyrates on the foredeck of a yacht, the CN Tower looming over her shoulder.\n\nSome, such as Nova Bhattacharya posing on the rim of the fountain pond amid bank towers, opt for high contrast; Delicate-boned Hari Krishnan goes gangsta under an expressway. Two indigenous performers partner with nature, Brian Solomon enraptured in the branches of an old maple tree, Santee Smith, in a long blue gown, dipping into the waters below the Scarborough bluffs. Allen Kaeja charges into a wild tumble off a bicycle down a grassy ravine slope.\n\nAs the lights go down on the Streetcar Crowsnest stage, a few dancers, who will sometimes double as stage hands, sit in a row of chairs facing the audience, the trio of musicians set up stage right.\n\nSolo Dance Xchange is in no way a competition, but mastery will out, and can’t help but draw an audience closer to the stage and inside the dancer’s moves, if only we could. The magnificent Peggy Baker in sleek jeans and grey t-shirt grasps a stick like a baton across her upper chest. In a few exquisite minutes, she strikes out with it like a warrior, uses it as a pivot point for a series of graceful floor manoeuvres, crawls hand over hand, then rises up free and strong with her mast held high.\n\nRobert Desrosiers is electric: arms spread or held tight; tiny rapid steps accelerating to the beat of drums, sculpting the air with measured, vocalizing from whispered breaths to almost silent howl. And Robert Stephen, bare-chested in blue tights, executes a breathtaking pas d’un that is all about virtuosity without showing off.\n\nOthers in this category are Bhattacharya, androgynous and fascinating in a barely Bharatanatyam, modern dance progression and William Yong in long black straight hair, holding a daisy, simpering from farce to dignified, balletic beauty. Shawn Byfield taps like a genius in white pants, adding his own rhythms to the tradition of black tap dancers.\n\nUnexpected delights of Solo Dance Xchange include: Esmeralda Enrique, girlish in a short black dress and shocking red flamenco shoes, clacking her castanets along a diagonal path of light; Ben Kamino, in nothing more than his tattoos, comically hefting a heavy folded table like frail, trembling muscleman in need of more strength; and Emily Law, who partnered with her costume, a full-length, diaphanous, kimono-like gown, its sleeves fluttering banners in her stately procession toward and away from us. Also, versatile Michael Caldwell in an Asian pointed straw hat, face obscured to the percussion of gongs and bells, moving with control toward a deliberate crumbling of his own spectacle.\n\nSo go see Solo Dance Xchange – tonight’s the last – no matter what you fancy in the way of dance. You can’t be disappointed.\n\nSolo Dance Xchange\n\nDancers: Mi Young Kim, Roula Said, Robert Desrosiers, Santee Smith, Michael Caldwell, Roshanak Jaberi, Esmeralda Enrique, Nova Bhattacharya, Allen Kaeja, Ofilio Sinbadinho, Jasmyn Fyffe, Pulga Muchochoma, Benjamin Kamino, Emily Law, Karen Kaeja, Shawn Byfield, Peggy Baker, William Yong, Claudia Moore, Robert Stephen, Brian Solomon\n\nSoundscore: SDXtet Eric Cadesky, Laurel MacDonald, Phil Strong\n\nAt Streetcar Crowsnest, Toronto, Feb 1 through 3 at 8 pm\n\nPhoto of William Yong by Aleksandar Antonijevic; Peggy Baker by Chris Hutcheson; Pulga Muchochoma by Allen Kaeja\n\n“How many have to die before you say, Enough? ENOUGH!” So says one of the Maori women in Waru, a film made in New Zealand by eight Maori female directors, each of whom contributed a 10-minute segment to a feature telling how a community comes together over the killing of a boy by his caregiver.\n\nTomorrow, Waru will open the 18th imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival, running from October 18 to 22 in different downtown Toronto locations. imagineNATIVE, now the largest festival of indigenous screen content in the world, is this year presenting 130 works, including 116 films and videos, five audio pieces and nine digital media works. Almost three-quarters of the works (72%) were made by women.\n\nPowerful imagery about powerful women, Waru is composed of eight shorts, each made in one continuous shot that, strung together, tell the story from many points of view of a boy named Waru, revealing the pain of child abuse and looking to ways of healing.\n\nThe festival closer, screening Sunday at TIFF Bell Lightbox, is The Road Forward, a Canadian-made musical documentary created by Marie Clements, a Métis/Dene playwright and filmmaker from Vancouver. The National Film Board production is based on a stage show employing first nations singing and dancing to tell the story of protest and activism by indigenous peoples in Canada from the 1930s to the present.\n\nSweet Country, another searing feature from Down Under, is a western directed by Australian filmmaker Warwick Thornton. Set in 1929 in the Northern Territory, the movie is based on an actual event: the murder of a white rancher by an Aboriginal bushman acting in self-defence.\n\nThis year’s festival is an occasion to mark the 50th film made by Alanis Obamsawin, Our People Will be Healed. The Quebec filmmaker, whose works go back to 1971, when she made her first film with the NFB, Christmas in Moose Factory, has this time turned her lens on the Helen Betty Osborne Ininiw Education Resource Centre, a Cree school near Norway House, 800 kilometres north of Winnipeg. As the 85-year-old Obamsawin told reporters in September at the time of the Toronto International Film Festival, “if you want to start talking about (native) problems, start talking about them in a positive way.”\n\nIndictment: The Crimes of Shelley Chartier, is a documentary from CBC Docs POV. “I was stupid, I was bored, I was lonely – that’s the truth,” Chartier tells the camera of her catfishing exploits. She relates how simple it was to impersonate celebrities and their fans online from her home in a remote reserve in Manitoba, Easterville. When an NBA superstar falls for Chartier’s online pose as a model who sends him nude photos of herself, the player is entrapped with the revelation the pictures were of a 17-year-old. Chartier’s extortion efforts took RCMP on a trail that led to the Playboy Mansion and other celebrity locales, before Chartier was indicted and sent to prison for 18 months.\n\nAmong the 102 short films screening at the festival are many directed by emerging indigenous filmmakers. Razelle Benally (Diné) is an alumna of the Sundance Film Institute Native Filmmakers Lab. Her 10-minute drama, Raven, screens in the shorts program Mother + Child. Beautifully shot, Raven is the wordless, heart-breaking story of a teenage suicide that derails at the last minute.\n\nTerry Jones, a Seneca artist from the United States, has made untitled & unlabeled, a three-minute experimental documentary that uses a video-game format to tell the story of how as a small boy he learned just how “different” he was.\n\nInuit filmmakers Carol Kunnuk and Zacharias Kunuk are represented at the festival with the world premiere screening of “Bowhead Whale Hunting with My Ancestors,” the first episode of a seven-part television series, Hunting With My Ancestors.\n\nThe festival’s new headquarters at 401 Richmond Street West will be the site for much of the industry component of the festival, including the imagineNATIVE live pitch sessions, workshops and panel discussions on such topics as, “Breaking the Mould: Developing Indigenous Narrative Models.”\n\nFriday night, starting at 5 pm at the Onsite Gallery, is the festival’s Art Crawl, a bus tour taking in shows and talks on contemporary indigenous art at seven gallery spaces.\n\nPartnering with Hamburg’s A Wall is a Screen, the festival presents an urban walk at 7:30 on Friday from the Art Gallery of Ontario featuring shorts projected on various wall spaces.\n\nLast but not least, imagineNATIVE presents The Beat, hosted by Jarrett Martineau at the Horseshoe Tavern on Saturday night, showcasing live performances by Mob Bounce, Kayla Briët, Ziibiwan and DJ Kookum and screenings of music videos.\n\nimagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival\n\nOct. 18 to 22 at various venues in Toronto\n\nGo to imaginenative.org for details and schedules\n\nPhotos, clockwise from top left: Sweet Country, Indictment: The Crimes of Shelley Chartier, Raven, Waru"
