Since 2005, Holy Cross has received a total of 79 Fulbrights, and has consistently been among the nation’s top producers of Fulbright students at the undergraduate level.\n\nThis year’s recipients are headed to Vietnam, Kenya, Germany, Taiwan, Spain, Greece, and Croatia.\n\nThe Fulbright Program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, is widely recognized as the most prestigious international exchange program in the world. The highly competitive grants are awarded on the basis of academic merit and professional promise.\n\nEach year approximately 1,900 U.S. college students are awarded grants through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. The Fulbright Program, the U.S. government’s flagship program in international educational exchange, awards grants to U.S. citizens and nationals of other countries for a variety of educational activities, primarily university lecturing, advanced research, graduate study and teaching in elementary and secondary schools. Since the program’s inception in 1946, more than 360,000 participants — selected on the basis of academic or professional achievement, as well as demonstrated leadership potential — have had the opportunity to observe each other’s political, economic and cultural institutions. The program operates in more than 160 countries worldwide.\n\nThis year’s recipients are:\n\nRelated Information\n\nOffice of Distinguished Fellowships and Graduate Studies\n\nPoints of Pride\n\nMedia Coverage"
