        "text": "The celebrated South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho is almost certainly best known for his multiple Academy Award and Palme d'Or-winning film Parasite, but perhaps his most critically-beloved movie to date is the 2009 noir Mother. The taut thriller, helmed by acclaimed actress Kim Hye-ja, tells the story of a woman who must become a detective to find the true killer behind the murder her son has been accused of. Fans of Bong’s later work will recognize the master’s touch in Mother‘s dark humor, careful pacing, and beautifully framed images. For one night only, Town Hall is proud to present a very special screening of this cinema classic, exclusively shown with in-person musical accompaniment. The live score concert will be conducted by Kennedy Center Honoree Tania León with a rare performance by the man who wrote Mother’s original music, the highly decorated composer and guitarist Lee Byeong Woo. Lee will be joined by an orchestra, assembled from members of the internationally renowned Harlem Chamber Players.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Town Hall, NYC\n\n123 W 43rd Street\n\nNY 10036\n\nTags\n\nFilm/Media, Music"
