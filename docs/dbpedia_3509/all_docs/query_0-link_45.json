        "text": "Beginning his second season with the Hawks is video coordinator Chris Koclanes.\n\nJoining Cindy Griffin's staff in August of 2013, Koclanes came to Hawk Hill after serving as a volunteer assistant coach at Dartmouth. While with the Big Green, he was an integral part of helping the new coaching staff with recruiting.\n\nPrior to his time at Dartmouth, Koclanes spent the 2012-13 season as director of basketball operations at William and Mary. With the Tribe, he was responsible for travel coordination, managing opponent film exchange, organizing and maintaining recruiting databases, coordinating community service events, and overseeing team managers. Off the court, Koclanes served as primary contact for alumni, family, friends and fans of William and Mary women's basketball, while directing the team's ball kid program.\n\nA 2010 graduate of Old Dominion, Koclanes served as a scout team player with the Monarchs from 2008-10. Also assisting with managerial responsibilities, he helped Old Dominion post a 36-27 record over two seasons, including a WNIT Second Round appearance in 2010.\n\nAdditionally, Koclanes led the Monarchs' club tennis team to the 2010 Club Tennis National Tournament and a national ranking.\n\nAfter graduation, Koclanes spent two years working as a financial advisor in New York City. During those two years, he remained active in basketball, working as a volunteer coach at the New Rochelle Boys and Girls Club in the summer of 2010, and as head coach of the Hooperstown Huskies AAU team in 2011.\n\nEarning a finance degree from Old Dominion, he is currently working towards a master's degree in organization development and leadership. A native of Pelham, N.Y., Koclanes currently resides in Philadelphia."
