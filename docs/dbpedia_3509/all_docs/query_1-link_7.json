        "text": "These include locations in New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1981, Cosmo and his wife Janet co-founded Amtech Software, which provides software solutions to over 30,000 business users throughout North America. In 1992, Cosmo assisted Janet in the creation and business development of Futura Services and later Futura Mobility, both national companies in the Healthcare and Enterprise Mobility space. They went on to acquire technology companies Zytek Software (Los Angeles, CA) and Hyperware Software (St. Louis, MO) in 2001 and 2003, respectively.\n\nIn 2001, Cosmo co-founded InfoLogix Inc., a leading Enterprise Mobility Solutions provider of Wireless and RFID technology solutions in the healthcare and commercial markets. He was Chairman of the company, helping take InfoLogix public in 2006. In 2011, Cosmo co-founded LogiStar Solutions, a specialized SAP services company focused on helping international SAP customers maximize their operational efficiencies and distribution velocity.\n\nIn 2006, Cosmo first entered the sports and entertainment industries, acquiring an interest in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers Arena Football (AF2) team. Cosmo became the sole owner from 2007 to 2009, and under Cosmo’s leadership the Pioneers won 57 games over four seasons and participated in two Arena Cup Title Games. In 2010, Cosmo acquired an ownership stake in the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League. In 2008 Cosmo invested with a group of well known media executives to acquire the brand and related assets of “Chicken Soup for the Soul”. Chicken Soup is a worldwide integrated media and merchandising company providing consumers with inspiring life improvement content, programming, and products.\n\nIn early March 2011, Cosmo acquired an interest in the long standing talent management firm J. Mitchell Management (JMM), and formed with Jeff Mitchell, the venture, Mitchell, Koseff, Schuster & DeNicola (MKS&D). The firm, based in New York City, has served the enter¬tainment industry for 25 years, and with the new partnership, MKS&D opened a west coast office on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California to expand the company’s services in the heart of the film and television industries.\n\nNotable past and present clients include James Gandolfini (“The Soprano’s); Robert Iler (“The Soprano’s); Bryan Greenberg (“How to Make It In America”); Molly Shannon (“Saturday Night Live”); Yin Chang (“Gossip Girl” and the Disney film “Prom”); Tristan Wilds (George Lucas’ “Red Tails [2012], “90210” and “The Wire”); Alexandra Chando (“As The World Turns” and the ABC Family series “The Lying Game”); E. J. Bonilla (“The Guiding Light” and the movie “Mamitas” ); Emma Kenney (Show¬time’s “Shameless”) Lily Pilblad (“Lights Out” on FX and “Fringe”); and many others.\n\nThe firm also represents Nikki M. James, one of the stars of the Broadway smash hit musical “The Book of Mor¬mon”. The role earned her a Tony award for Best Performance by an Actress in Featured Role in a Musical at the 2011 Tony Awards.\n\nCosmo has held many civic and trade Association board positions. He currently resides in Montgomery County, PA with his wife Janet and has two adult children, Michael and Morgan.\n\nPerfect World has over 10 subsidiaries in Europe, Asia and North America.

Prior to this, he held key positions in strategy and talent management functions of multinational companies including Motorola, Cisco System, Philips and Dell where he managed key executive areas including strategic management, leadership development, human resource development, organizational efficiency improvement, staff training, recruitment of strategic talent, employer branding, employee commitment enhancement, and organizational change management.

These experiences became the foundation for Dr. Xiao in joining a newly rising Chinese internet company - Perfect World -- in May 2008. It also helped him successfully lead the change and optimization of corporate culture and internal management system. This, in turn, led to the honor of \"best employer\" in online game industry from 2009 to 2012.\n\nSince he became CEO of Perfect World, Dr. Xiao has been building Perfect World from an ordinary Chinese public company into a global enterprise representing the highest level of online games in China. The concept of \"global development, global publishing and global partner\" long advocated by Dr. Xiao has become the company’s leading philosophy recognized by the online game industry in China. PWIE and ARC of Perfect World, a global trading platform for online games and a global standardized online game publishing platform respectively, as well as the global investment plan PWIN, etc., each play important roles in the implementation of the concept of \"Perfect entertainment for World sharing\".\n\nDr. Xiao has also proposed four possible future dimensions of next-generation internet entertainment including multi-dimensional display, vertical integration, technology revolution and global innovation. Currently, Perfect World is in the process of establishing a series of innovative research centers including a next-generation internet entertainment technology research institute, a digital arts institute, a global digital entertainment development research center and a China digital arts association. These research centers will move forward under a division of the company called Guangdong Perfect World Educational Investment Co. Ltd., a subsidiary in Zhuhai City of Guangdong Province. The purpose of these new centers of digital innovation is to train new talent in digital entertainment and promote industrial and technological revolution and innovation in digital entertainment. Under Dr. Xiao’s leadership, Perfect World is committed to developing special global strategies in an effort to become China's most competitive digital entertainment industry group, as well as an effective envoy for global cultural exchanges.\n\nPerfect World places high priority on fulfilling its corporate social responsibility. The Perfect World Employee Foundation, officially established in 2013, makes charitable contributions to public welfare works and projects including disaster relief, helping “drop out” and disabled children and building \"Perfect World” villages in the poor areas of Yunnan Province.\n\nThe Perfect World brand also enjoys strong “word-of-mouth” in China due to its contributions to the country’s national economic and social development. Dr. Xiao is often invited to visit other countries with other state leaders to deliver speeches and contribute ideas international economic development and social harmony and stability at significant international conferences such as the Davos Forum, the Boao Forum in Asia, the World Knowledge Forum, and the APEC CEO Summit etc… Dr. Xiao was named one of the \"Top 10 Influential Figures within China's Game Industry In 2013\" by State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of China, and \"Outstanding Entrepreneur of the Year 2013\" by the China Software Industry Association.\n\nMr. Xiao received his bachelor’s degree in physics in 1989 from Beijing’s influential Tsinghua University.
