        "text": "In another sign of an improving economy, developers plan to build two hotels near the intersection of Pelham Road and Interstate 85, the first hotel construction in the high-traffic area in more than a decade.\n\nPinnacle Hospitality of Spartanburg said it plans a 127-room Hampton Inn & Suites along The Parkway near Michelin North America’s headquarters, while Central Realty Holdings of Greenville said it plans a 104-room Home 2 Suites along Beacon Drive close to where a movie theater used to be.\n\nBoth developers said they plan to break ground early next year and expect the hotels to open in 2015.\n\nIn addition, JHM Hotels of Greenville said it’s renovating the Marriott Greenville, one of three hotels it owns in the Pelham/85 area, and construction has begun on a CertusBank branch in the area.\n\nRece Morgan, president of Central Realty Holdings, said it also plans to expand a shopping center it owns in the Pelham/85 area that is anchored by an Earth Fare grocery.\n\nCentral Realty, owned by the Timmons family of Greenville, will develop the $10.5 million Home 2 Suites and expand the shopping center on 11 acres that the company has held back from development while waiting for the retail market to recover from the Great Recession, Morgan said.\n\nHe said Central Realty now plans to expand the shopping center by as much as 77,000 square feet, with groundbreaking for the first 21,500 square feet set for June.\n\n“The leasing so far is giving us a fair indication that we’ll move on with consequent phases,” Morgan said.\n\nAlong The Parkway, Pinnacle Hospitality plans a restaurant on the same site as the Hampton Inn & Suites, but hasn’t picked a brand yet, said Phil Simmons, the company’s broker-in-charge.\n\nBefore the recession struck, Pinnacle Hospitality had planned to use the three-acre site at the intersection of The Parkway and Parkway East to develop a 155-room, full-service Sheraton hotel.\n\nBut when the downturn came, Simmons said, “Hospitality lending pretty much dried up for new construction, so we just decided to hit the brakes on that project.”\n\nPinnacle Hospitality’s holdings include a five-story office building directly across The Parkway from where it plans the Hampton Inn & Suites and two hotels on Woodruff Road, a Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites and Microtel Inn and Suites.\n\nAt the Marriott Greenville next to the Michelin headquarters, owner JHM Hotels has begun a multimillion-dollar renovation that includes new carpet, paint, upholstery and linens for the lobby, meeting spaces, corridors and guest rooms, said Heather Meadors, JHM’s community relations director.\n\nShe said the renovation also will include additional meeting space and new branding for the hotel’s restaurant.\n\nJHM Hotels built the newest hotel currently in the Pelham/85 area, the Courtyard by Marriott along The Parkway, in 2000, Meadors said.\n\nEmily Ledbetter, a spokeswoman for Greenville-based CertusBank, said it plans to open its 36th branch in the Pelham/85 area in the spring.\n\nThe planned Hampton Inn & Suites and Home 2 Suites would be the 12th and 13th hotels for the Pelham/85 area, which has long been a strong hotel market because of its proximity to the interstate and major business operations, said Chris Stone, president of visitgreenvillesc, formerly the Greenville Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nCorporate operations in the Pelham/85 area, in addition to the Michelin headquarters, include the headquarters of ScanSource Inc., major offices of Synnex Corp. and a Bausch & Lomb contact lens solution plant.\n\nIn addition, BMW Manufacturing Co., General Electric Co.’s Greenville campus and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport are a short drive away.\n\nThe area also has a “really nice little cluster of restaurants, so that makes it a really good travel stop,” Stone said.\n\nHotels and restaurants in the Pelham/85 area also benefit from youth sports tournaments at the MeSa Soccer Complex along Anderson Ridge Road a short drive away.\n\nThe 16-field complex is scheduled to host high school athletes from around the South for an ultimate tournament in May and a lacrosse tournament in late May and early June."
