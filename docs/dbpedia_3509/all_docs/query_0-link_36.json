        "text": "[lounge music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Narrator] On Story is brought to you in part by the Alice Kleberg Reynolds Foundation, a Texas family providing innovative funding since 1979.\n\n\"On Story\" is also brought to you in part by the Bogle Family Vineyards, six generation farmers and third generation winemakers based in Clarksburg, California.\n\nMakers of sustainably grown wines that are a reflection of the their family values since 1968.\n\n[waves] [kids screaming] [wind] [witch cackling] [sirens wail] [gunshots] [dripping] [suspenseful music] [telegraph beeping, typing] [piano gliss] From Austin Film Festival, this is \"On Story.\"\n\nA look inside the creative process from today's leading writers, creators, and filmmakers.\n\nThis week's \"On Story,\" Chris Fedak discusses \"Ambulance\" and the art of writing the action sequence.\n\n- The action movie is related to musicals and comedies, especially silent comedies.\n\nAnd so when you think about the way movies worked back in the day, it's that they worked in 1,000-foot reels and that's 10 minutes.\n\nI think that there's still something in that kind of natural evolution of what makes a movie is that like if a movie kind of works within like these 10-minute kind of intervals, it keeps the audience's attentions, they're involved.\n\n[paper crumples] [typing] [carriage returns, ding] [Narrator] In this episode, Chris Fedak uses his feature screenplay \"Ambulance,\" which he wrote for Universal Pictures and which was directed by Michael Bay, as a case study on writing complex action sequences that drive the plot forward.\n\n[carriage returns, ding] It feels like it should have had a warning card at the beginning of the movie- - Why?\n\n- About the adrenaline.\n\nLike it's the ultimate, ultimate car chase, sort of that who knew you could do it for, what was the run time?\n\n- It's over two hours, yeah.\n\n- Right.\n\nI'd love to hear sort of the beginnings of the development of how, you know, this script came about.\n\n- It actually took about 10 years.\n\nI was finishing \"Chuck\" and it was the final season of the show and I have a Danish manager and Mikkel calls me, he says, \"I just saw a movie\" and this is how he talks.\n\n\"I saw something you have to, you have to watch it.\"\n\nAnd it was like, \"Okay.\"\n\nAnd it was this small movie, a European film, \"Ambulancen\" from Denmark.\n\nAnd it is a taut 80-minute thriller with also a lot of like really cool European touches, like ethereal touches.\n\nIt's like it actually has an angelic EMT character and it's these two brothers and it was a very interesting thing.\n\nAnd what I liked about this movie was it was this tight little thriller, was really three characters inside a van.\n\nAnd then my thought was, \"What if you take that van, you put it in Los Angeles and you just [bleep] blow up half of the city?\"\n\n[audience laughing] You know, just like lay waste to the city 'cause like it's also one of those things, like every time I sit in traffic, I'm like, \"What the [bleep] keeping me from getting to where I want to go?\n\nIt better be something good.\"\n\nSo I want bodies, I want blood.\n\nNow, I take that idea and I go meet with my friend Jamie Vanderbilt.\n\nAnd I had this notion of, it was a fusion of a bunch of things that had happened back when we were in school.\n\nThere was a number of robberies in Los Angeles.\n\nThen there was another robbery, it was a giant, it was a big, it wasn't as dramatic, but it was a giant robbery where $32 million were stolen.\n\nSo I was like, \"I wanna fuse all those things together and I wanna take a bunch of these pieces of this and that.\"\n\nAnd also at the end of the North Hollywood shootout, there was a picture in \"The L.A. Times\" the next morning and it was of one of the robbers bleeding out on the ground.\n\nHis eyes open.\n\nNow, he might have been dead, but the story was did they let him bleed out 'cause of what had just happened?\n\nAnd so I was like, \"I want a story where the EMT, who spent this entire movie trying to save this cop in the back and these two guys have [bleep] you know, I wanna see her try to have to save him.\n\nI want to get to that point, where we're all the way through the looking glass emotionally, we've gone through all these crazy, you know, moves and that she now has to do simply her job.\"\n\n'Cause I love that notion of it's like when you get out into the world, it's like fireman's got one job, cops got another job, EMTs got another job, doctors got a different job.\n\nAnd I love when they all run into each other.\n\nAnd I think that's so cool.\n\nThat feels like Los Angeles.\n\nIt feels like the world we live in.\n\nAnd I love when they don't quite agree.\n\nSo I pitched that to Jamie.\n\nHe's like, \"Cool\" 'cause like we're just all writers now.\n\nSo instead of it being like executives and you gotta go convince people, it's just like \"Cool.\"\n\nI was like, \"Great.\n\nIt'll be great.\"\n\nAnd so I kind of got to a point years later, \"Jamie, I got the script.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nSend it to him and then he's like, \"Oh wow, okay, yeah.\"\n\nAnd then we started just, you know, we started and I developed it with a number of different directors over the years.\n\nAnd I was always working on other TV shows.\n\nAnd it was fun though 'cause like, okay, I'll go sit down with this director and we would talk about it and we'd work on the script.\n\nEveryone had their own kind of influence of what they wanted to do with it and we'd get close and then something would happen.\n\nBut the pandemic rolls around and I was doing the second season of \"Prodigal Son,\" but I got a call, which was like, \"Michael Bay needs a movie and he needs a movie that's COVID-friendly.\"\n\nLike something that they could do with the protocols.\n\nAnd we were thinking \"Ambulance.\"\n\nI'm like, \"Really?\n\nWe blow up half of Los Angeles with the ambulance?\n\nBut it was like, but there was, but the fact that we shot so much of it inside of a contained location, it was actually kind of made a bit of sense.\n\nSo Jamie, my friend, we send off the script to Michael Bay and then you'd go like, \"That's not gonna [bleep] happen, that's crazy.\"\n\nWell, next thing I know it's like, \"Oh, he read it, he's in.\"\n\nAnd then it's like, \"All right, well let's see what in looks like.\"\n\n\"Jake's signing on too.\"\n\n\"What the [bleep] is going on here?\"\n\n[typewriter dings] - So we're actually gonna be starting to look at some of the clips- - Oh, God forbid.\n\n- That you have chosen.\n\nThis is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.\n\nThe one, the bank scene, walking into the bank scene.\n\nWhich because of so much that's in it, that gives you the stuff for later, the payoff part.\n\n- Kim, you have a visitor.\n\nBut make it quick.\n\n- Hi.\n\nHello.\n\nThis is gonna sound a little crazy.\n\n- What is it?\n\n- Well, I, I've, I've been in here, in the bank a few times.\n\nWow, it's really just me in here.\n\nI, I was personally gonna, gonna try and play it a little cooler, but my, my partner in there, he's, he's right out there in this, in the car.\n\nHe just wanted me to come and say something to you.\n\n'Cause I told myself that if I ever got the chance to that I would ask you out on a date.\n\n- Like right now?\n\n- Doesn't have to be.\n\n- It's the worst timing on the planet for that guy, right?\n\nAll he wants to do is hook up.\n\n- In the original movie \"Ambulancen,\" it's like one shot where the guys just rush out of a bank and they get into an ambulance and there's a person having a heart attack in the back.\n\nAnd I was like, \"I know it has to be a police officer in the back of the ambulance and that's gonna make it much more like it's going to, it's important.\"\n\nI remember knowing that this scene would be in this part of the story and that a coincidence, a small thing of like, just like a guy wants to go ask a girl out on a date is gonna literally lead to so much freaking chaos.\n\nThat's what I love.\n\nLike your inciting incident doesn't always have to be like, you know, some huge thing or like, you know, pulling a sword out of a stone.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nBut like, it can be a guy just wants to go out on a date.\n\n'Cause like this movie was also going to pull from a lot of the films that I grew up loving, you know, being \"Die Hard\" or another really important one is the original \"Taking of Pelham 123.\"\n\nAnd so when you look at those movies, there's always these small incidents, these small things, these little twists and turns.\n\nAnd so, the tension is like, like you can do all these different things and we do a lot of explosions and whatnot and that's all in there.\n\nBut like I love that tension is you don't know what movie you're in yet.\n\nLike, there's a moment early in \"Die Hard\" where I remember watching like the truck pull up and it's the first time I, when I was a little kid and I just remember watching that.\n\nI was like, \"I bet this is a movie where someone's gonna get run over by that truck.\"\n\nAnd I was like, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nAt a certain point you realize that's not what this movie is going to do.\n\n- Let's go, let's go, let's go.\n\nLet's go, Will, come on.\n\n- Move.\n\n[dramatic music] [guns firing] [dramatic music] [people screaming] [bleep]!\n\n- What'd you do, man?\n\n[guns firing] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - You so quickly got rid of a bunch of people in a really gruesome way that I was honestly not expecting.\n\nThere's so many formulaic action films that get made and it was like, \"Whoa, whoa.\n\nI wasn't expecting that guy to go and that guy to go.\"\n\nThe feeling that I had when I was watching this was Michael Bay was saying, \"These guys are getting assaulted.\n\nI want you to feel assaulted too.\"\n\n- It's all about maximum impact.\n\nIt's all about like, how do we take this thing on the page?\n\nYou know, you're trying to like tell a story.\n\nSo that's, there's a difference between you're trying to sell the script and then when you're in it with your director, now you're in like, it's almost like you're speaking a language that only he or she needs to really understand.\n\nIt's like you're trying to make it their movie.\n\nYou're trying to, so when they're looking at it, they know what they're going to do with it.\n\nIt was really about translating it into like this movie which could have been directed by a number of different people had to turn into a movie that was going to be directed by a very specific filmmaker who thinks about action in a very specific and knowledgeable way in regard to \"I know how to do this, I know how to shoot this, and I know how to do it in the smallest amount of time.\"\n\nBut the genius of Michael is that he knows exact, he's been doing this for so long and has made so many of these types of movies.\n\nHe's like, \"I can take all that and I can put it into these days.\"\n\nAnd so the script began to reflect that, which is like, that's how you take the, you know, what was, you know, them escaping from the bank robbery and turn it into this kind of compressed action sequence where you could have, it was all these things kind of working together to kind of maximize, you know, what was actually gonna show up on screen, you know?\n\nAnd also that it was important that Will shoot the cop.\n\nThat had to be him having made this terrible mistake.\n\nThe thing he could, like his worst day was compounding on top of itself.\n\nEverything's compounding constantly.\n\nSo for Will, it had to be him, you know, 'cause for Danny, I'm gonna go back to the holy text, \"Die Hard.\"\n\n[audience laughing] There is one holy text, I go back to it often.\n\nThe first time John McClane comes up against a terrorist, what does he do?\n\nHe tries to arrest him.\n\nYou're under arrest.\n\nIt's so important because it means he's not an action star yet.\n\nHe's not like in, you know, in like one of the sequels.\n\nIt's like, \"I'm gonna try to do my job.\"\n\nAnd so for here, it was important to watch Will's beginning his evolution from home, trying to, you know, save his wife to now having done this terrible thing.\n\n- We got it, baby.\n\nInsurance coming through.\n\n- I lose faith in this world on a daily basis.\n\nNot in you though.\n\n- I mean, we gonna be all right.\n\nYou think you can handle him for a few hours?\n\n- Oh yeah, we're gonna sleep, right?\n\n[baby crying] Maybe not.\n\nAnother interview?\n\n- Yeah, a warehouse job.\n\nForklift driver.\n\n- That's good, baby.\n\nYou can drive anything.\n\n[soft music] [door creaking] [door shutting] Celebrate when you get back.\n\nSomebody called from a blocked number earlier.\n\n- I know what you're thinking.\n\nIt's not Danny.\n\n- Good.\n\nI know you love him.\n\nI know why.\n\nBut we don't need your brother.\n\n- I got all I need right here.\n\nTurn on the alarm.\n\n- I wanna backtrack for a real quick second and ask about the relationship of the brothers and how that is really this architectural piece of the whole film, they're so opposite each other.\n\n- There was brothers in the original movie.\n\nIn 2011, when I first heard the idea, somewhere it fused into my mind the VA was going through this terrible, you know, bureaucratic problems, and we had servicemen not getting, you know, medical care.\n\nAnd I was like, \"But that's [bleep] up.\"\n\nAnd for me, that realness of like some real thing that like is happening in the world is like usually you don't put that into an action movie for a mass audience.\n\nI was like, \"That's a perfect setup for a character who we are are going to identify with.\"\n\nYou go and you serve for your country and then you come back and your wife isn't gonna get the medical care that she needs.\n\nWill did come up, you know, on the wrong side of the tracks.\n\nAnd that you know, that he had a brother who he wasn't supposed to be talking to.\n\nAnd it's one of those things that like as you're working on your story and there was always a scene where his wife would say, \"I got a call from a blocked number\" and we know it's the older brother that he's not supposed to be talking to.\n\nAnd it's like, even as you write it, the mystery in your head is you're starting to fill in like, \"Well, why wouldn't you talk to your brother?\n\nAnd who is that, you know, what is that dynamic between the two of them?\"\n\nAnd then Michael included like this notion of like, \"Well, let's seek glimpses of their past.\"\n\nAnd it's one of those examples, like as a writer I'm like, \"Scenes are scenes\" and you know, I didn't see that, I didn't think to include that.\n\nBut when you're a director who's done as much as, you know, it's like he knows what he can do and it works.\n\nIt's like it's this neat kind of ethereal element kind of infused into the story.\n\n- Well, but when you go back to the Bible, John McClane is clearly our protagonist.\n\n- Right.\n\n- In here, I would not go into this and say that any one of them is clearly our protagonist, right?\n\nYou may.\n\nI didn't watch it that way.\n\nIt was like- - No, I like it, I like criticism here up on stage, it's great.\n\n[audience laughing] No, it's great.\n\nHere's the thing, it's like this was, this movie was designed to be messy.\n\nIt's not here to say it's like \"Will's a good guy and he does everything the right way.\"\n\nNo, he shoots a police officer.\n\nIt's like, this is not okay.\n\nThe notion that the good guys show up and they shoot the bad guy and then everybody succeeds and wins and walks away, that doesn't always happen, you know?\n\nAnd I thought that was such an interesting thing to explore is like sometimes when the cops show up, it's like, you know, it's bad, more bad things happen.\n\nAnd it's not because they're not trying to do something, it's just because they don't have the information.\n\nThey don't know who is, who's dangerous or if even if the cop's alive in the back of the ambulance.\n\nI think that's what's neat.\n\nJohn McClane though is like, going back to the holy text, but in that movie it's like, behind it is the husband-wife relationship.\n\nIt's about a guy trying to get back to his wife to apologize for being a [bleep].\n\nWhereas in this one, it is about Will trying to get back to his wife, but he's doomed.\n\n- So let's go into this, which should have almost gotten an X rating, I think.\n\n- Skin is open.\n\n- Then you and your criminal friend right there put both of your hands in the wound and I need you to spread the muscle apart.\n\n- Man, the way people drive in this city.\n\n- Stop yelling.\n\n- Slow down.\n\nYou cannot do this at 60 miles an hour.\n\n- That was just an amazing, amazing layered like something.\n\nSo again, also rewound that one a couple of times when I watched it 'cause it was like so much stuff in there, the whole layering of the guys on the cell phone.\n\n- I always go back to Elmer Leonard and I went to see him speak at the WGA a million years ago and he was just like, \"You know, people are always asking like how do I come up with this stuff?\n\nOr how am I funny or witty?\"\n\nIt's just like, or quick.\n\nAnd I'm like, \"I'm not,\" but I write it and then I come back to it when I have that quick thing and I put it in there.\n\nSo what happens in this story is that this scene was always in the script, but then what you realize is that as you kind of lay the thing out, you start to compound it and compress it and then you can have three or four things going on.\n\nBecause not only is this the coolest scene where she saves the guy, but it's also because the doctors don't see it, it's the inciting incident for the next sequence.\n\nIf you're thinking about 10-inute reels, the next sequence will be the sniper sequence where the cops think he's dead.\n\nWe're also setting up our next 10-minute problem, which is, you know, how we're gonna get into that.\n\nAnd this also would speak to Cam, it would speak to her character, it would speak to who she wanted to be.\n\nOriginally, she wanted to be a doctor, you know, and she's good at it.\n\nAnd there was a moment in the script, it's not in the movie, but it was where it was like the surgeons are watching and they're like, \"She's got good hands.\n\nBecause this is the type of thing that only some people can do.\n\nI can't pull somebody's guts out of them.\n\nAnd now it's, what's interesting is the criminal friend, that line is improv by the guy on the golf course who's a real surgeon.\n\nThose are real surgeons.\n\nAnd it was shot in Florida.\n\nSo Michael had gone back to Florida and we were like, \"Okay, we'll pick up this scene in a hospital somewhere in Florida.\"\n\nBut of course, it's COVID.\n\nSo I'm like, \"Why don't we just put it on a golf course?\n\nYou know, doctors are there too, you know?\"\n\nAnd so he had his, he had, you know, friends who were surgeons.\n\nSo they were like, \"Well, yeah, we can do this.\"\n\nAnd so it's the two of them out there on a real golf course.\n\nAnd then, you know, and everything happening inside the van is that kind of contained thriller.\n\nThat's the original contained thriller that was COVID-friendly.\n\nSo it's about compacting and taking tensions and kind of putting them all on top of themselves and setting up your next problem that is gonna be coming down the road.\n\n- Well, so let's talk about that part, that 10-minute thing you're talking about.\n\nThis 10-minute reel.\n\nI mean, is this how you approached the entire film?\n\nIt's like in these modules.\n\n- The action movie is related to musicals and comedies, especially silent comedies.\n\nAnd so, when you think about the way movies worked back in the day, it's that they worked in 1,000-foot reels and that's 10 minutes.\n\nSo one reeler would be 10 minutes.\n\nSo I think that there's still something in that kind of natural evolution of what makes a movie is that like, if a movie kind of works within like these 10-minute kind of intervals, you know, like how Charlie Chaplin would've like learned how to make a movie, then it keeps the audience's attention sitting in a theater, especially in more painful seats back in the day, is like they're involved.\n\nThey know that you have to keep kind of moving the problem and changing the story and also kind of like, you know, twisting it, you know, twisting it constantly along the way.\n\nSo I do sometimes view things in ten-minute intervals.\n\n- You know, I mean, you really are always setting something else up that's crucial to the rest of the story, right?\n\n- But I think one of the things that you notice with writers that write scripts that are, that you wanna read, that you find yourself enjoying as you're going through them is that they're doing a lot of setup, especially at the beginning of the story.\n\nBut then, you know, they probably have written the 200 page draft of this thing and then what what they do is they start to shrink it and they start to kind of know that if I'm gonna keep somebody's interest, if I'm going to kind of drive that story along, then you're kind of like, oh, all the layers can kind of be on top of themselves.\n\nYou can be doing two, three, four things at the same time in a scene.\n\n- Let's take scene five.\n\n- Green to go.\n\nTake, take the shot if you got it.\n\n[suspenseful music] [Man] Target one green.\n\n- Kill shots.\n\nNothing gets in the back.\n\nWe've got friendlies.\n\n- On my call.\n\n[Man] Target two red.\n\nTarget two not clear.\n\n- What about Zach?\n\nI can't protect him.\n\nCan you?\n\n- What are you talking about?\n\nHe's alive?\n\n- Yes, he's alive.\n\n- Hey, he's alive.\n\nOur cop's alive.\n\n- God.\n\n- Three.\n\n- No.\n\n[Danny] Cam.\n\n- No.\n\n- Two.\n\n[suspenseful music] - Snipers.\n\n[Driver] What?\n\n- Snipers.\n\n- Where?\n\n- Black building.\n\n- One.\n\nEngage.\n\n[guns firing] [tires screeching] [cars exploding] - That's also just one of those moments where it feels like everybody is just trying to do their job, but nobody really knows what's going on.\n\n- There's no bad guys.\n\n- Yeah, there's no bad guys.\n\n- I mean, there are bad guys, but there's also no bad guys, in the sense that, well, there are bad guys.\n\nI'm not saying it's okay to rob banks.\n\nI'm not not saying it's okay to rob banks.\n\nBut just like, just think about your problems that the scene before leads to the sniper sequence.\n\nNow the sniper sequence leads to Danny losing it.\n\nAnd so now the guy who is emotionally volatile, psychopathic, he is in a bad state.\n\nSo now it leads to the next sequence.\n\nNow it's pushing us back to Cam's gonna become the possible victim.\n\nThat Cam is now, even though she saved them, she becomes the representation of authority for Danny and now he's gonna focus on her.\n\nSo we're now going into an even darker place of like, \"Is he gonna lose it?\"\n\nBecause we've set up in the dynamic of the brothers, there's one brother who left.\n\nGoing to the military was Will getting out, getting away from their poisonous father.\n\nDanny stayed, he's a criminal.\n\nHe was destroyed by his father.\n\nHe's the powder keg now.\n\nSo now the story kind of folds back inside into the ambulance and it's about the powder keg is gonna blow, it's gonna be an emotional thing.\n\nIt's gonna be about Danny and Jake and his incredible performance.\n\nBut all those things are set up.\n\nThey're all moving and causing new problems to form.\n\n- Will!\n\nSomebody help him.\n\n- Ma'am.\n\n- Will!\n\nWill!\n\n- Come on.\n\n- Don't let him die.\n\nPlease, don't let him die.\n\nWill!\n\nWill!\n\nSomebody help him.\n\nWill!\n\nPlease somebody help my husband.\n\n- You need to forget him.\n\n- No.\n\nI didn't finish the job.\n\n- He's gonna die.\n\nHe's my husband, please.\n\n[man gasping] - Hey, stop, this is a crime scene.\n\n- Get off of me.\n\nBack up.\n\nBack off.\n\n[dramatic music] Will.\n\nCome on, Will, come on.\n\nCome on.\n\nHey, look at me.\n\nLook at me.\n\nYour wife is right here.\n\nYou can do this.\n\nYou can do this, Will.\n\nWill, you got this.\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nOh my God.\n\n- We'll get to him soon.\n\n- He'll be dead soon.\n\nHelp me now.\n\n- All right, it's the teary part of the action film.\n\n- It's an action film with emotions.\n\n- Yes, I'm actually even worried about how long he's going to jail and when the kid will see him again and stuff, so.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nOr is he is even gonna survive?\n\nIt's like, and it's interesting because there was iterations of the story where it ended pretty much here.\n\nA lot of the things that were added, even the money, like in the first drafts of the script, there was no money being placed into a baby carrier.\n\nYou know, those were all things that as I worked on it with different directors, you know, we found opportunities for like there to be these, it's not like we're saying everything's okay, but we're just saying that there's a part of this story which is there can be some reconciliation, there can be some hope.\n\nAnd it was interesting, especially with Michael that in our first conversation, like, you know, talking to him, he had like a couple of ideas and one of the ideas was \"I want to go back to the six-year-old girl at the end of the story.\"\n\nAnd it's an emotional thing.\n\nYour gut says, \"I know what the story is, I know how to tell that story.\"\n\nI didn't know how to tell this story until I figured out Cam.\n\nAnd when Cam, in the original \"Ambulancen\" the Cam is a almost an angelic character.\n\nIt's very cool, but it wouldn't work for this story.\n\nAnd then once I realized that Cam was the best EMT in that she had this drive that she could keep anybody alive for 15 minutes.\n\nAnd once I had that, I knew that, you know, her saving Will was the north star of the movie.\n\nI was gonna head toward that.\n\nAnd then what's great is that that's her technical, like I can physically do this thing, but then going back to see the little girl at the end of the movie, it means she cares.\n\nLike she is touched emotionally.\n\nYou know, she does have this heart that she hides from everyone.\n\n'Cause like even if we can kind of intellectually say to ourselves that like, \"You know, I don't, I'm fine, I'm fine.\n\nI don't have feelings or emotions, stuff like that.\n\nYou do.\n\nThey're beneath there.\n\nAnd that's what I loved about it.\n\nSo Michael was like another addition where you're just like, \"That's great.\"\n\nYou know, it's like it allows you to have hope and it also tells you something about the character.\n\n- But so that would be my argument as to the conflict over the protagonist because I would call her the protagonist.\n\n- Yes.\n\nBut, and I agree with that and I think that was also one of the reasons why the movie didn't get made originally.\n\nBecause when you go out to kind of like put together a movie, you usually start with your leads.\n\nAnd I think a lot of actors looked at that script and they were like, \"I think Cam's the main character.\"\n\nAnd what's so awesome about Yahya and Jake is that they fully commit to characters who are flawed.\n\nAnd that's the kind of amazing thing for me is to hand the script over and to watch, like these people all at the top of their game, fully commit to characters who are flawed and then secretly, the female lead is the hero of the story.\n\nYou know, and that for me, is awesome.\n\nThere's a lot of action movies and I love action movies, all of them.\n\nNot all of them.\n\nBut you know what's gonna happen.\n\nAnd I think that, hope that anyone who went into the theater, you don't know how this movie's gonna end.\n\n[typewriter dings] [Narrator] You've been watching \"On Writing Action: Ambulance with Chris Fedak\" on \"On Story.\"\n\nOn Story is part of a growing number of programs in Austin Film
