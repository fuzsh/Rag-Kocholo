        "text": "TITLE. Title of the film under which the application for New York State license was made. The TITLE is usually identical to the film's original release title. For foreign films, the TITLE is given in the language of the original release.\n\nFILE NO. As applications for licenses were received by the Division, they were assigned sequential case file numbers. The case files are maintained in this numerical order.\n\nDATE. The year in which the application for license was filed. Usually this is the same year that the film was released in New York State. This DATE may be later than the year the film was actually produced, particularly for foreign films.\n\nCOUNTRY. The country where the manufacturer was located at the time of application. Most films were American-made, but approximately 17,000 were foreign productions.\n\nFOOTAGE. Length in feet of the film submitted for licensing, before any eliminations were made.\n\nDETERMINATION. The licensing decision made by the Division. The entries indicate one of four possible options:\n\nAPPROVED --- the film was licensed as submitted, without any eliminations ordered.\n\nELIMINATIONS --- the film was licensed only after specified changes or deletions were made by the producers or exchanges.\n\nREJECTED --- the film was denied a license because of the large amount of objectionable material.\n\nNONE --- the application was withdrawn by the applicant and no license was issued.\n\nNOTES Indicates either that the film is SILENT or that its case file is part of a SPECIAL CASE FILE series.\n\nSILENT --- indicates that the license application form stated that the film was silent.\n\nSPECIAL CASE FILE --- indicates that the case file for the film is part of a separate series arranged under sensitive topics such as obscenity, burlesque, social hygiene, narcotics, and nudity. These files were segregated to assist Division reviewers in deciding especially controversial or precedent-setting cases.\n\nMANUFACTURER. The company that produced the film. (Abbreviation used in the index are: ASSOC---Associations; CO--Company; CORP--Corporation; DIST--Distributors(s), Distributing; INC--Incorporated; PROD--Productions(s).)\n\nEXCHANGE. The company applying for the license. The exchange was usually the primary distributor of a film within the State. (Abbreviations are identical to those used in the MANUFACTURER category.)\n\nSCRIPT. Applicants were required to submit a copy of all dialogue contained in the film. Entries contain one or more of the following indicators of the type(s) of scripts in each case file:\n\nDIALOGUE --- All dialogue contained in the film. Credits are not usually given.\n\nCUT CONT (Cutting Continuity) --- Typically includes all dialogue, reel numbers, scene numbers, description of scenes, number of frames within scenes, footage for each reel or scene, description of action, camera directions, and a complete list of credits.\n\nTRANS (English Translation) --- English translation of all foreign language dialogue.\n\nSUB SCRIPT (Subtitles Script) --- English subtitles that were superimposed on a foreign-language film.\n\nDUB SCRIPT (Dubbing Script) --- English dialogue for a foreign language film submitted in a dubbed english language version. (In many cases, the index will contain another entry for the same film in a foreign language version.)\n\nTIT SCRIPT (Title Script) --- Titles that appear in a film, usually in silent films. Very few exist in the case files.\n\nSHO SCRIPT (Shooting Script) --- Typically contains all dialogue with general scene descriptions. Very few exist in the case files.\n\nNONE --- Indicates that the case file contains no script material.\n\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL. Indicates that the case file contains one or more of the following:\n\nCORRES (Correspondence) --- Letters written between the Division and exchanges or producers. Correspondence may cover changes in titles or footage, descriptions of eliminations ordered, or other aspects involving the review and licensing process.\n\nREV (Reviews) --- Reviews clipped from newspapers or magazines to assist the Division in it review procedures.\n\nPLOT SUM (Plot Summary) --- Brief descriptions of the film plot. Many were written by the Division to justify a decision to deny a license. Of particular importance are the many plot summaries for films rejected during the 1920's --- little information exists elsewhere about these films. In addition, there are summaries clipped from the Motion Picture Daily for many films produced in the 1950's and 1960's.\n\nADVER (Advertising) --- A few case files contain photos of objectionable theatre marquees, cards used in lobbies of theatres, posters, press books, and clippings from newspaper advertisements.\n\nAPP (Appeal Documentation) --- Correspondence and legal papers relating to appeals by exchanges of the licensing determination of the Division. Appeals could be made to the Director of the Division, the Board of Regents, or the courts.\n\nNONE --- indicates the case file contains none of the additional materials listed above.\n\nWRITER.

Provided for serials and short subjects appearing in a continuously numbered series. For each entry, the TITLE (category 1, above) indicates the series title and number of the film, while the EPISODE TITLE category provides the title of the individual episode (e.g., for the film HEROES OF THE WEST #8 \"FRONTIER JUSTICE,\" the TITLE is HEROES OF THE WEST #8 while the EPISODE TITLE is FRONTIER JUSTICE). NA indicates that the film is not part of a series.\n\nALTERNATE TITLE. Indicates any alternate or variant titles of a film. These include working titles (used during the filming but changed before the film was released); script titles (found on the script but not used as a release title); title changes (releases of the film under a title other than the one for which the license was issued); and subtitles or abbreviated versions of the original title, e.g., for the film THE JONES FAMILY IN \"BORN TROUBLE,\" the ALTERNATE TITLE is BORN TROUBLE. NA indicates there is no alternate title.\n\nTITLE IN ENGLISH. English translations of a foreign language title, if contained in the case file. NA indicates there is no English translation of the title.\n\nIV. Arrangement of Sets in Index\n\nThe index is divided into eight separate sets. Each set contains entries arranged by a different information category. These information categories are:\n\nSET No. of MICROFICHE Title 81 Country 69 Date 69 Manufacturer 69 Exchange 69 Writer 27 Director 25 Determination 9 Total 418 Microfiche\n\nThe various sets are described below:\n\nTitle. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged alphabetically by the original release title of the film. This set of fiche includes \"see\" references for variant titles, e.g., if a user only knows the script title of a film but not the release title, he would find a \"see\" reference in this set under the script title instructing him to look under the name of the release title. Note: Titles beginning with numbers, e.g., \"8 1/2,\" sort at end of title set.\n\nCountry. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged by country of production. For example, all entries of films made by French companies are arranged alphabetically by title of the film under the heading FRANCE.\n\nDate. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged first by year, secondly by country of production, and thirdly alphabetically by title of film. For example, all films produced by French companies in 1959 are arranged alphabetically by title of the film under the heading 1959 FRANCE.\n\nManufacturer. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged alphabetically by name of manufacturer and, under each manufacturer, alphabetically by title of film.\n\nExchange. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged alphabetically by name of exchange and, under each exchange, alphabetically by title of film.\n\nWriter. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged alphabetically by name of screenwriter and, under each screenwriter, alphabetically by title of film. When multiple screenwriters occur, full entries are repeated under the name of each writer. As previously mentioned, entries are included only for writers identified on the scripts. If the screenwriter was not identified on a script, there will not be an entry for the film in this set.\n\nDirector. In this set of microfiche, entries are arranged alphabetically by name of director and, under each director's name, alphabetically by title of film. When multiple directors occur, full entries are repeated under the name of each director. As previously mentioned, entries are included only for directors identified on scripts. If the director was not identified on a script, there will not be an entry for the film in this set."
