        "text": "I think I like the first Silent Hill movie more than most. I’m still entranced by this movie 14 years later. I love the look, I love how it almost entirely uses several of Akira Yamaoka’s songs from the first few games (that’s like half the reason why I like the film), and I love the emotion poured into the movie. In my opinion, it’s faithful to the spirit of Team Silent’s games, if not the letter. We’ll be getting to that issue soon, and how it relates to the sequel.\n\nIt’s not a movie that can be fully taken in once. Movie YouTuber Chris Stuckmann alluded to such in his review, saying that he disliked the film when he first saw it, but it still stuck with him (no pun intended), so he saw it again to review it, and he saw more to appreciate.\n\nAlmost every time I watch this movie, I discover some new story element, or foreshadowing, or a visual element that I didn’t notice before. I’m not implying that people who dislike or are neutral to the movie are wrong, man, just because they didn’t give it enough of a chance to watch it more than once, but if you are interested in it, I encourage you to check it out.\n\nThere are some issues to discuss about how the movie turned out the way it did, however. What do we mean when we say that an adaptation is faithful to the spirit, but not the letter, of its source material? The movie made some major changes instead of being 100% faithful to the first game, and not all of them were necessary in my view. The most obvious one is a change of protagonist. Instead of dopey but resourceful single dad Harry Mason, we now have the married, but still resourceful Rose Da Silva. Director and original writer Christophe Gans explained that, when he was analyzing Harry’s character, he realized that Harry “was a woman”. This has to be the most controversial change from game to movie, and I can see why. Harry was a perfectly fine character on his own, hampered only by mediocre voice direction typical of games at the time. I like Rose, but I wouldn’t have swapped Harry out for an original character if I wrote an adaptation of the first game, and certainly not for the same reasons that Gans did.\n\nBut then again, this is a movie about motherhood, and specifically Dahlia’s failed motherhood, and Harry wouldn’t have fit in with that. There’s also an opinion that the movie was scarier with female leads instead of male ones.\n\nThe issue of replacing a father character with a mother was compounded by studio demands. In the original script, Rose was a single mother, putting her more in line with Harry, ironically enough. This left the movie with no main male characters. The studio didn’t think that the movie would be successful with a primarily female cast, so the character of Chris was created, and Thomas Gucci, a cop killed by the Order cult in the game, was added to guide Chris (sort of) through Silent Hill. Sean Bean and Kim Coates are good in this movie, and Coates especially seemed passionate about it judging from the behind the scenes featurette, so it pains me to agree that not much would have been lost if they were cut entirely. Though I do wonder how the ending would have changed.\n\nThis wasn’t the only instance in which the studio meddled with the film, which will be discussed soon.\n\nThe other major change was with the villains of the story. For the movie, we have some extremist religious cult instead of the crypto-Satanic Order of the games. Instead of being the leader of the cult, Dahlia seems to be ignorant of their ritualistic murders of “sinners” until she learns the truth at devastating cost. I don’t really have any issues with these changes, but I may some with what the sequel does to Alessa. That is a discussion for another day.\n\nAlessa being abused by Colin is an unnecessary change to her backstory. Her being burned alive is a good enough motivation for revenge. It would appear that Colin was added just to have a new and creepy monster for the movie, and admittedly, it was effective. Colin is a disgusting creature, before and after death.\n\nI finally realized when recapping the film that Colin being bound by barbed wire? That’s foreshadowing to Alessa’s preferred method of murder. I don’t know how she got a hold of Colin, but not the rest of the cult members until Rose and Sharon came around.\n\nI’m a bit confused by some aspects of the backstory, and changes from the original script are partially to blame. Did Alessa cause the coal fires beneath the town? How did the cult survive for 30 years cut off from the outside world? Did they die in the fire, but survive in an undead state in a purgatory created by Alessa until she could exact her revenge, giving them their final deaths? Why didn’t Dahlia just tell the other who Alessa’s father was? Couldn’t she have lied to get them off of her back? Was Alessa’s father an outsider, which the cult wouldn’t take kindly to either? It could have been interesting to imply that it was Michael Kaufmann. My craziest theory is that it was an immaculate conception. Perhaps speculation doesn’t matter, though, because it doesn’t seem like there was any way for Dahlia to keep Alessa safe. I also wonder why Dark Alessa and Alessa waited 20 years to create Sharon and send her out into the world. Perhaps it took that much time and power to do so. “We can wait.”\n\nSpeaking of which, the original script implied that Alessa had psychic powers, like in the game. The breaking of the chain holding Alessa to the ceiling and Lisa getting very upset at seeing her in her oxygen tent were going to be due to these powers. The first time was probably her power working instinctively, but the second time was Alessa doing it on purpose (like Dark Alessa said, Alessa hurt someone who was just curious). The loss of these implications muddle the plot slightly. Kind of like how the English translation of the first game made the story even more confusing.\n\nThe movie has some plot holes, but I overlook them because the parts of the story that work give me feels.\n\nOriginally, the ending was going to be pretty different, but had to be changed due to budget and time constraints (curse you, budget constraints!). Alessa was going to kill the cultists in a totally different way by summoning multiple Pyramid Heads to execute them. I’m pretty lukewarm on the usage of PH outside of Silent Hill 2, but that would have been rad as fuck.\n\nThe compromise was inspired by… hentai. Gans, you weeb.\n\nI can understand why including more monsters from the second game would be questioned, but I think it can be justified by the film crew not knowing whether or not they would get to make another SH movie. Considering how the second one turned out, I’m even more glad that they included the monsters that they did in the first.\n\nI can’t say enough how much I love the credits and the music used. They open with “Hometown” (Silent Hill 3) before transitioning to the quieter and more sorrowful “Tears of…” (SH1), and finishing with “Theme of Laura” (Silent Hill 2). That feels so deliberate, but not manipulative.\n\nYamaoka being one of the producers on the movie helped make the atmosphere more consistent with the games. He was not a producer on the second movie, which also lacks a lot of his original music from the games, and it’s all the poorer for it.\n\nI like the character of Rose. She has a toughness that reminds me a little bit of Heather. Like Stuckmann says in his review, I like Radha Mitchell and wish that she had more roles. Alas, Gans didn’t like working with her because she took several takes to get into character.\n\nTo be honest, the first movie was the last time I was truly passionate about anything SH-related.\n\nTrivia\n\nIt took Gans five years to get the rights to make the film. To convince Konami, he filmed an interview of himself talking about how much the game meant to him, and he filmed some scenes that he made on his own dollar with some of the songs from the games.\n\nThere are over 100 different versions of Rose’s outfit because its color changes over the course of the film. At the end, Rose’s outfit is blood red.\n\nTo provide extra verisimilitude, Radha Mitchell didn’t wash her hair once during filming. That, I did not know before researching this article.\n\nWhen Rose is running around in search of Sharon at the start of the film, she runs through a tunnel that has the name “Cheryl” on the wall, a reference to Sharon’s inspiration.\n\nOriginally, Rose was going to have dark hair, and the Da Silva family was named De Salvo, just like Andrew in Silent Hill 4: The Room. That was a weird choice considering that Andrew was a douche that was A-OK taking a job torturing children in a cultists’ water prison. SH4 is a weird game.\n\nAnna may have been influenced slightly by Angela from SH2 with their similar names and association with knives.\n\nThe original script, if filmed faithfully, would have totaled three and a half hours of screentime.\n\nAlice Krige didn’t enjoy her role very much because of how evil and manipulative Christabella was.\n\nGans originally wanted Cybil to be played by… Cameron Diaz. No. She looks the part, but no. I’m happy with Laurie Holden.\n\nDuring the fight scene with the cultists, one of Holden’s hands were injured. Despite this, the scene was her favorite to film.\n\nA novelization of the film exists, but was only released in Japan. It was written by Paula Edgewood.\n\nThe ending in the original script was happier.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nRecently, it was revealed that Gans is coming back for a third movie, and it seems that he is going to work within the continuity of the first two movies instead of rebooting it. This was a big surprise to me because I read or otherwise got the impression that Gans was heavily burnt out on Hollywood after the first film, and the changes made to it. Victor Hadida is back on as one of the producers; sadly his brother Samuel passed on a few years before the new project began. But I wonder how long it will take for the movie to come out with the pandemic messing everything up. I hope that Gans will be able to put his passion into the new movie as well as he did the first."
