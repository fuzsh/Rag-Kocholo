        "text": "Reviewed On PlayStation 3\n\nAlso Available on Xbox 360\n\nSilent Hill 2 is a video game that’s often spoken of in reverential tones. From it’s dark and taboo subject matter, to its oppressively thick atmosphere and iconic enemy design, Silent Hill 2 is cited as one of the most influential survival horror titles of all-time. With a game of this pedigree, it would be easy to listen to all of the praise and adoration it’s garnered over the years and let that outside influence become a larger focus than the game itself, but that’s thankfully not the case here. While Silent Hill 2 may be beginning to show its age, there’s enough here to prove that, even after 20 years, it’s still worth diving into.\n\nFor starters, it’s worth noting that my experience with Silent Hill 2 has been with the HD Edition on the PS3, not the original PS2/Xbox release from 2001. This version of the game (part of the HD Collection alongside Silent Hill 3 HD) is often criticized for messing with the visuals in a manner that destroys the original intent. The iconic fog permeating the town has been drastically scaled back and there’s also the issue of newly recorded VO, which many consider to be inferior to the original. While patches were eventually released that address some of the issues regarding the fog, and the option to play with the original voices is still there, the HD Edition is not a perfect reflection of the original release, which is worth keeping in mind if you wish to play this game as originally intended.\n\nSilent Hill 2 begins with a man named James Sunderland receiving a letter from his wife, Mary, asking him to come find her in the town of Silent Hill. The catch? Mary has been dead for three years. Playing as James, you spend your time exploring the dark and grimy locations of Silent Hill while crossing paths with a handful of mysterious individuals. Is Mary actually alive? Why is she calling you to this town? Who are these people, and why have they also been summoned here? These are the questions you’re faced with as you descend into the increasingly dark and disturbing world of Silent Hill.\n\nThe characters and story are where most of Silent Hill 2’s acclaim is drawn from. The mystery of what happened to Mary and whether or not she’s actually alive is the main driving force of the plot, but each character James stumbles across has a fascinating and often tragic story of their own. Angela is a young woman searching for her mother, but her aversion towards others makes it hard for her to ask for help. Eddie is an insecure victim of bullying with a penchant for lying and boasting to influence how people view him. Laura is an eight year-old child who seems to have knowledge about Mary, but always runs from James whenever their paths cross. And then there’s Maria, a woman with the exact same face and voice as Mary, but a different hairstyle and a more aggressive personality. As for James himself, he’s a bit of a quiet and detached character who is made more important and interesting by the way his interaction with the others play out, often leading to new revelations that draw more of his personality to the surface.\n\nThere’s some incredibly heavy subject manner in this game, ranging anywhere from depression and suicidal tendencies to harassment and sexual abuse and, for the most part, it handles these subjects in a mature and respectable manner. However, there are a few instances where it feels like things go slightly too far and it uses visual symbolism in a way that feels tacky and tasteless. A lot of these themes are used to not only explore the background of these side characters, but also give insight on James and his own personal history and struggles. On one hand, it’s a fascinating exploration of trauma and the pain people hold on to, but it doesn’t feel like every theme is approached with the same level of maturity.\n\nWhile the way Silent Hill 2 handles all of these characters and weaves their stories through and around each other is fascinating, it can also feel convoluted and hard to follow. There’s a lot of threads in this game to keep track of and several of them are never fully explained, leaving large chunks of the story entirely open to speculation and interpretation. This can be frustrating after a first run through the game, but the inclusion of multiple endings inspires multiple playthroughs, which leads to new information, offers alternate ways to view things, and even recontextualizes your previous playthroughs. The inclusion of multiple endings gives plenty of reason to play through the game again (I’m currently on my fourth playthrough) and the thrill of discovering a new way to interpret a story element is arguably one of the greatest strengths of the game.\n\nWhen it comes to actually playing Silent Hill 2, this is where things get a little more complicated. One of my biggest complaints about the first game was that the difficulty level didn’t match the horror genre it was set in. Enemies weren’t much of a threat and supplies bounced back and forth between too much and too little, making the game feel uneven and the horror element feel neutered. While supplies are more evenly distributed this time around, the game ultimately feels even easier. Enemies are sluggish and easy to bypass, so combat quickly becomes an afterthought. Most enemies can also take a decent amount of damage, so it becomes smarter to run past everything and hoard your supplies.\n\nHowever, even if there was more of an incentive to fight, it wouldn’t change much. Melee combat is available for when you’re low on ammo or completely dry, but it feels just slightly off and the dull thud of whacking an enemy with a wooden stick or metal rod is far from satisfying. On the plus side, firearms feel more accurate and reliable than the first game. They allow for greater range and deal more damage, but since most of the enemies are bullet sponges and easy to get around it feels like fighting them is a waste of time and resources. Similar to how I felt about the first game, Silent Hill 2 is a game that should be played for its story and characters, not its combat.\n\nWhile the enemies might not serve as much of a threat, their designs are terrifying and memorable. From the likes of the acid-spewing walking sacks of flesh called Lying Figures, to the erratic movement of the sexualized Bubble Head Nurses, the enemies in Silent Hill 2 are equally grotesque and visually striking. Of course, there’s also the most iconic enemy in the game: Pyramid Head. This hulking monstrosity has the body of a man, but a giant metal pyramid where its head should be. Encounters with Pyramid Head are rare and extremely dangerous. He wields a giant cleaver that can kill you in a single hit, so distance is key if you wish to survive his encounters. He only shows up in a handful of scripted scenarios, but it’s always shocking when his menacing visage appears. His presence is so unbelievably bold and striking that it makes perfect sense that his image is basically synonymous with the words “Silent Hill”.\n\nOne of the greatest aspects of the first game was its clever use of puzzles. In Silent Hill 2, the puzzles have been slightly downplayed, but they’re still immensely satisfying. Most puzzles come in two parts: finding the actual puzzle and then finding the clues to solve it. While there are a few exceptions, the vast majority of the puzzles can only be solved by carefully reading and analyzing different notes and letters hidden throughout the environment for clues. It’s not always immediately clear how the information from a note will help you solve the puzzle, so sometimes you have to read over the notes multiple times and break things down to figure out how they fit in to the equation. They don’t always hit the highs of the puzzles featured in the first game, but playing on different difficulties will change the solutions, which adds an extra layer of replayability.\n\nSadly, not all of the features that made the first game great are present here, but that has more to do with the HD edition than the actual game itself. When I played the first Silent Hill last month, the creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere of the town impressed me, largely due to the way the thick fog added to the experience. While the original version of Silent Hill 2 still contains that heavy iconic fog, it’s so subdued in the HD edition that it practically feels nonexistent. This version was eventually patched to try and preserve some of the fog effects, but the update is so minimal that it feels less like a thick blanket and more like a fuzzy Instagram filter. Looking at footage of the two versions side-by-side makes it clear that even though the resolution is increased for the HD edition, the older PS2 version simply looks better due to a more detailed atmosphere. Things are considerably better when exploring indoor locations, but whenever I hit the streets I couldn’t help but constantly be reminded that I was playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nThe last big change specific to the HD edition is the inclusion of the new voice overs. I’ve done a complete playthrough with both the original and new voices and while I don’t think the new voices are as bad as some of the diehard fans of the original claim, I do think they miss the intent of the characters. There’s supposed to be an awkward dreamlike aspect to these characters, which the original voices capture perfectly, but the new voices sound so clean and professional that just the voices alone make some of these characters feel entirely different. Don’t get me wrong, I think Silent Hill 2 is solid game with a captivating story, memorable characters, and iconic enemies, but when the downgraded fog and new voice overs are thrown into the equation, it makes the HD edition hard to recommend unless it’s your only way to play the game."
