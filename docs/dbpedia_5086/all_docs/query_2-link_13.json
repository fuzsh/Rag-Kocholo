        "text": "Hey! ?\n\nI'm currently working by my own in a horror game inspired by resident evil and silent hill.\n\nStill haven't decided on the plot, since i'm more into programming.\n\nBut already made some gameplay mechanics, and worked in the enviroment\n\nI'd like a lot, if you guys just share here what you think about it.\n\nThere is a bunch of videos in my youtube channel : Nytion Wings - YouTube\n\nThe game is being made in UNITY\n\nIt has a weapon mechanic added to it, currently with 4 weapons : Handgun , Magnum, Assault Rifle and Submachine Gun ( the worst i've made ).\n\nI'm not sure though if it will have action elements, just added it because i like guns\n\nThe game looks different on each video because i've changed my mind several times about the graphics.\n\nIt started with simulating PS1 Shaders.\n\nLater I changed to CARTOON.\n\nAnd now photorealism.\n\nFor all the videos about the project, just visit the channel : Nytion Wings - YouTube\n\nThere are also videos of the project that preceded this one.\n\nFeel free to leave your HONEST opinion please, this is a HELLO WORLD from my game ?\n\nThank you for your attention :)\n\nLooks ok, and seem to be working decently. If it is an early stage, I think is a good result. But I would add more elements before asking for opinions. Try making a small vertical slice (akin to a playable demo), so you can showcase what you want to achieve. Make a simple level, showing some enemies and a single puzzle, so you can test the combat, exploration and the survival horror aspect (key parts of the games you mentioned). Don't overdo it. A simple 4~6 room building, were you need to find 3 keys or combine 2 items do get out, is more tha enough. Take a look at the Resident Evil 3 Remake demo, where you need to find a hose to put a fire out. A simple task, but it shows what the game is.\n\nnytionwings@gmail.com said:\n\nBut already made some gameplay mechanics, and worked in the enviroment\n\n(…)\n\nI'm not sure though if it will have action elements, just added it because i like guns\n\nYou need a goal. To turn these isolated mechanics into the core gameplay, and see if they work. Do some game design, decide what you want to achieve, put it into paper and develop it. Change it if you don't like it (or based on feedback). Without a goal, you will just be “experimenting” without achieving much.\n\nnytionwings@gmail.com said:\n\nAnd now photorealism.\n\nWhat is your understanding of “photorealism”? When people say that, they tend to mean things (characters and environments) that look as real as possible (think Red Dead Redemption 2). From your videos, your project is not close to photorealistic, so I would avoid calling it photorealistic, to avoid confusion (and, possibly, harsh criticism).\n\nThe current cartoon/cellshaded look you have now is ok. If you keep in this route, a few tweaks will make it better. The character and the environments need some work to be in a more similar art style, to keep things more consistent."
