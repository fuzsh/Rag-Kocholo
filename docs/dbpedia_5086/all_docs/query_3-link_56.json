        "text": "Review Copy provided by Boss Fight Books\n\nFirst off, I want to say thank you to Boss Fight Books for giving me an advanced copy of this title for review. This is my first time receiving this sort of opportunity for my blog, so I’m extremely grateful. I also want to say thank you to the author, Mike Drucker, for making me play Silent Hill 2. He begins the book with an introduction that recommends buying and playing through a copy of the game before reading any further, so I did. Sadly, the $80-100 for a used PS2 copy was steeper than I was willing to pay, so I had to go against his wishes and settle on the weaker (but much more affordable) version via the HD Collection on PS3. Sorry, Mike. While I was still able to enjoy my time and experience a game full of weird-ass monsters, WTF moments, and a great soundtrack, I had issues with the visual jank of this version and found the storyline to be rather confusing. However, like a creature hiding in the fog, Mike Drucker appeared (not literally) with a book that answered the questions I had, made me look at the game in a different light, and appreciate it on a whole new level. Thanks, Mike!\n\nSilent Hill 2 tells the story of a man named James Sunderland who receives a letter from his dead wife beckoning him to come find her in the town of Silent Hill. If that sounds weird to you, just wait until you see what else this game has in store for you. James meets a complex cast of broken people, a pyramid headed monster with an unhealthy sexual attraction to mannequins, and discovers a town full of dark secrets. It’s a game full of weird and vague plot points, dialogue, and visual design and to be completely honest, I felt lost through the majority of my playthrough. Some elements made sense, but I found myself thinking “Man, I really hope Drucker’s book explains this” multiple times. Thankfully, Drucker’s book explains… pretty much everything?\n\nSeriously, God bless Mike Drucker. His ability to dive into the deep emotional and mental themes of this game while maintaining a fun sense of humor enriched my own experience with it. Silent Hill 2 is the type of game where few things are simply as they first appear and everything has a double, or even triple, meaning. While this book is full of funny little quips about things such as Florida strip clubs, or the comparisons between a character and a Dateline suspect, Drucker also has a smart and profound way of explaining symbolism and covering some of the more taboo subjects of the story in a respectful manner. He also takes things a step further by opening up about personal experiences of his own that helped him connect to and understand some of the characters in the game. His ability to weave between humor, insightful analysis, and personal experience makes for a highly memorable and powerful read.\n\nThere’s also some really fun historical information about the franchise that’s fascinating to read about. Everything from the nonsensical marketing strategies, how the game was received in its time, and even how it went on to influence other titles in the genre can be found within these pages. As someone who is endlessly intrigued by video game history, I found these elements of the book to be wonderfully insightful and I could honestly read an entire book about the philosophical differences between Japanese and American horror.\n\nIt’s a fairly short read, but that’s by no means a bad thing. It comes in at 176 pages and was the perfect length for me to read through in a single afternoon. Drucker is a concise writer who knows how to say what needs to be said without cranking out bloated and pretentious drivel. It also helps that he’s really damn funny and makes reading his work so fun. Whether you’re playing Silent Hill 2 for the first time or returning to it after many years, Mike Drucker’s book feels like an essential companion piece to the game and shouldn’t be missed.\n\n– Zack Burrows"
