        "text": "MY FIRST PROYECT\n\n(PSYCHOLOGICAL SURVIVAL HORROR GAME)\n\nA game inspired in silent hill.\n\nWikipedia Quote:\n\nHi everyone, first of all I want to clarify that I do not speak very good English, (im from Argentina), but I do the best I can to answer all their questions.\n\nThis is my attempt to make a game inspired in Silent Hill´s series, Silent Hill 1 to be exact, (my favorite one), i love the ambient, the atmosphere that this game have, the loneliness can feel in every corner, that’s the feeling I get every time i play it, the background music helps a lot to make this feeling bigger too of course. I always wanted to make a game like this with better graphics but different, i mean, a game with this kind of ambience, isolated rooms full of rust and dirt, make the player feel nervous while walking along a corridor without using any monster or enemy in escene, you know, the silence is also a sound, and you can make a lot of things with those combinations if you know how to do it well.\n\nThis is something that i did using G.Sketchup, Photoshop and Unity 3d:\n\n-The whole Building was made entirely in G.Sketchup.\n\n-The objects in scene were made separately in G.Sketchup and then exported to Unity.\n\n-All the textures were made by me using Photoshop.\n\n-The textures were added in G.Sketchup too, (i did not make any UVMAPS).\n\nI know that G.Sketchup it´s not the best 3D modelling program, but i like the simplicity for making buildings, and you can make good things if you know how to use it.\n\nWell, you can see some screens here that i take from the game:\n\nDOWNLOAD TEST LEVEL\n\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/90483179/TestDemo/TestDemo.rar\n\nCOMPRESSED: 73.3MB\n\nDECOMPRESSED: 173MB\n\n================================================================================================\n\nYou can see some early works that i made using G.Sketchup and Unity:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMMRkhsMAR8\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1drsHXUPM\n\nThis is the early level show in the upper video in UnityWebPlayer:\n\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/93388363/AHTEST45Web/WebPlayer.html\n\nHope you like, and any criticism are welcome\n\nWell, this is quite a scary level indeed. The sound, the atmosphere, everything bodes ill will. The only thing I noticed out of place in the level is the bathroom, the objects aren’t all of them dented and had a “dirt” pass over them. I guess that is still work in progress. I liked that sudden image that appears when you enter the bathroom as well. Nonetheless, when I was playing, I did feel I was in a Silent Hill game, the only exception is the loads of blood and gore effects that Silent Hill uses aren’t here yet.\n\nI’d say if you are going for such atmosphere, I strongly recommend you take a look at this The Cradle. I think the level designer did exactly what you are doing right now in your game; at the end of the document there is an interview with the level design where he explains the thought process on how he designed the level.\n\nOverall, great design really.\n\nWoops! Sorry about that, I didn’t know that both aren’t in sync together; I thought you updated both.\n\nI have played the demo and it is quite nice, I take back that bathroom thing. Though, I’d still recommend the same link as before. Nonetheless, I love the atmosphere and as fano_linux mentioned, the overall design has the Silent Hill feeling. I liked what was written on that board, not sure if it is linked to Sri Chinmoy or not.\n\nI am not sure how you are designing your level, but the feeling of anticipation is obvious throughout the play time I had, that was the thing that took over me. If there are enemies spawning what am I to do now?\n\nThat and of course the looming question what is going on here? What am I supposed to do? I guess however that is because it is in development.\n\nAnother thing is the layout of the hospital itself… it seems so small with no rooms to enter and it is all about going down. There isn’t much of a place to discover. For instance, each floor has only 1-2 rooms to check and the rest is to go down staircases. I spent more time on the stairs than anything else. Probably that is because it still in development, but that is something to keep in mind. The real world hospital layouts focus more on horizontal plane rather than the vertical plane.\n\nNonetheless, magnificent work with the assets modeling and texturing. I applaud your skill in doing all of this in SketchUp, that wheelchair is no simple thing in that program to be honest, for example. I tried it myself before but had to go back to 3DS Max right away. Is that SketchUp Pro?\n\nAll in all well done and am really waiting for more updates keep up the good work (Make it less scary :P, shhhhh!).\n\nEDIT: By the way, I played that on the “Fastest” setting and tried the “Normal” setting; performance wise, I didn’t feel there is a huge difference to be honest. Only when I changed the game to 640x480 and checked off windowed that I felt slight performance increase (sorry I have an old laptop)."
