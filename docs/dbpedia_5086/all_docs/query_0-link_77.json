        "text": "By: Dusty Green\n\nI know that there’s been way too much written about Christophe Gans’ 2006 Silent Hill film. But, I also know that any Silent Hill fan worth their weight in lead pipes is willing to have this tired old conversation again.\n\nIt seems like fans of the movie and fans of the video games are two different factions of people. I happen to be a huge fan of both, and I’d like to throw my brain into the ring and let you know why I love them so much. People who aren’t Silent Hill fans, I’m sorry (not sorry), this article is going to be painful for you.\n\nWhen social obligations force me out of my lair, and into a party or something, you can usually find me in the corner talking to a cat, or weeping while polishing off a bottle of Carlo Rossi.\n\nWhen I’m not drunk and talking to cats, I’m looking for the one other nerd at the party. Once in a blue moon, you find that nerd, and if the stars align, they also like Silent Hill…. but it’s either the game or the movie, not both. For me, finding someone that likes both is like finding a unicorn…a sweaty unicorn with whom I can eat Fritos and talk about Silent Hill.\n\nEveryone loves the SH series for pretty similar reasons; its beautifully crafted atmosphere, the compelling, emotional, and engaging stories, and because there’s no feeling like having to throw your controller at the power button because you’re too scared to get off of the couch.\n\nThe series reinvented the horror genre, and despite losing its way with modern iterations, see Book of Memories, the current standard of horror video games owes itself to the trailblazer that is the 1999 Silent Hill [as well as Resident Evil, and a number of others… but that’s another article].\n\nBut, to get to the issue at hand, the Silent Hill movie.\n\nIt seems like the main concerns that the haters have are the following: Harry was turned into a woman, Jodelle Ferland (Alessa/Sharon) can’t act worth beans, and the story wasn’t true enough to the game/was confusing (depending on if you’re a Silent Hill fan, or Roger Ebert, respectively).\n\nThe argument against “turning Harry Mason into a woman,” I think, is a flawed one. People often misquote Christophe Gans as saying that the characteristics of Harry are that of a woman, and I can see how people could interpret the quote that way:\n\n“…when we decided to adapt the first game, we decided to have the hero of the first game, a guy named Harry Mason, but when we put him on the paper and tried to be very close to the original character of the game, we noticed that he was almost never acting like a man, but much more like a woman… we decided to make him a woman”\n\nIt’s important to note that Gans says that when they put the character on paper, it ended up being a woman. As they developed the character for the movie, they felt that it was more like a woman than a man. I’ve heard people rage at length from a lot of different perspectives like, “who says what a man or a woman should act like”; or “if you cared so much about Harry’s character, then you would have kept him a man”.\n\nBut I honestly believe that Gans just viewed the character that he was making, in his own film adaptation, was a woman. Ask any writer, and they will tell you that characters always take on a life of their own; I feel like this is no different, and the way that Rose Da Silva developed in the script lead her to be a female. I understand that SH fans are attached to the protagonists of each game, I still get choked up at the end of SH2 (I cant believe the dog was behind it all!), but you really do have to separate the game from the movie.\n\nRose Di Silva isn’t supposed to be a Harry Mason with boobs, and Silent Hill (2006) isn’t supposed to be a clone of Silent Hill (1999).\n\nOn to the grim topic of Jodelle Ferland’s acting ability.\n\nThis is one thing that even the most die-hard fans of the film have to be willing to bend on. People always point out her crummy meowing abilities at the start of the film, but I feel like there are better examples of her terrible acting.\n\nThe line “Look, I’m burning,” makes me cringe, not because I’m freaked out, but because it’s one of the worst line deliveries I’ve ever heard.\n\nThere isn’t a whole lot to say about Ferland’s lackluster performance, beyond the fact that she was like 15 years old when the movie was made, and practically no one can act when they’re 15. If we’re being honest, even now I’d be hard pressed to out-act that kid from Troll 2. I know this isn’t a great excuse, but seriously, if you can name 10 child actors who gave a competent performance in the last million years of cinema, I will give you an internet-high-five. George Lucas couldn’t find a good child actor to play young Anakin Skywalker, so what chance is Christophe Gans have?\n\nFinally, the story.\n\nI can almost understand why the layman (non-SH fans) wouldn’t be able to follow the plot of the movie, but who cares about those peasants. Us noble nerds already know the story, and a large group of us are upset that the story was taken in a different direction than the game.\n\nReally though? If the PS1 Silent Hill were copied verbatim, I think that people would be even more confused and upset. The first game really doesn’t do much explaining until the end, where we are treated to an exposition of Dahlia and the Order abusing young Alessa. Something similar happens in the film, but people seem a lot more upset by it. Silent Hill has never been a series that strips away all of the mystery. Half of the fun of the series, for me, is interpreting the horrors that the protagonists encounter.\n\nSimilarly, I think it is Gans’ right to interpret Silent Hill in a way that he sees fit. He is clearly a fan of the series as there are countless homages to the games, such as the camera angles, music, mythology, and the excellent use of atmosphere. The changes made to the plot and the characters are an interpretation of Silent Hill by a fan of the series.\n\nUs fans are a hard crew to please, and Silent Hill continues to be a divisive issue. Maybe I’m giving the movie too much credit, or maybe I’ve gone mad from watching it more times than I can remember, but I honestly think that if people can get past these few minor issues, there is an excellent horror movie to enjoy.\n\nSilent Hill is easily a contender for the best video-game-to-film adaptation, as the majority of those have gamers holding their heads in shame/rage.\n\nEven if you hate the original Silent Hill movie, and no amount of my quackery can convince you otherwise, I think we can all agree on this: at least it’s not as bad as the sequel."
