The first four mainline video games in the series, Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill 3, and Silent Hill 4: The Room, were developed by an internal group called Team Silent, a development staff within former Konami subsidiary Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo.\n\nThe later four mainline games, Origins, Homecoming, Shattered Memories and Downpour, were developed by other, mostly Western developers. The Silent Hill franchise has expanded to include various print pieces, two feature films, and spin-off video games. As of 2013, the game series has sold over 8.4 million copies worldwide.[2]\n\nSilent Hill is set in the series' eponymous fictional American town. The series is heavily influenced by the literary genre of psychological horror, with its player characters being mostly \"everymen\".[3]\n\nInstallment overview\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease timeline\n\nMain series in bold\n\n1999Silent Hill20002001Play Novel: Silent HillSilent Hill 220022003Silent Hill 32004Silent Hill 4: The Room20052006The Silent Hill CollectionSilent Hill (mobile game)2007Silent Hill: The ArcadeSilent Hill: OrphanSilent Hill: OriginsSilent Hill: The Escape2008Silent Hill: Orphan 2Silent Hill: Homecoming2009Silent Hill: Shattered Memories2010Silent Hill: Orphan 320112012Silent Hill: DownpourSilent Hill HD CollectionSilent Hill: Book of Memories20132014P.T.201520162017201820192020202120222023Silent Hill: Ascension2024Silent Hill: The Short MessageSilent Hill 2 (remake)TBASilent Hill fSilent Hill: Townfall\n\nMain series\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill (1999)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill (video game)\n\nThe first installment in the series follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the mysterious New England town of Silent Hill. Stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, Harry discovers his daughter's true origin. Multiple game endings are possible, depending on in-game actions taken by the player. It was released in 1999 for the PlayStation. In 2009, the game became available for download from the European PlayStation Network store for the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable, and later, in the same year, from the North American PlayStation Network store.[4][5]\n\nSilent Hill 2 (2001)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill 2\n\nThe second installment in the series follows James Sunderland searching for his deceased wife in Silent Hill after having received a letter from her informing him that she is waiting for him there.

An extended version of the game was released for the Xbox in December of the same year as Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams in North America and Silent Hill 2: Inner Fears in Europe, and for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as Silent Hill 2: Director's Cut, with a port of Director's Cut to Microsoft Windows released in February 2003.[6]\n\nSilent Hill 3 (2003)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill 3\n\nThe third installment in the series follows a teenage girl named Heather as she becomes caught in a conflict within Silent Hill's cult and discovers her true origin. It was released in May 2003 for the PlayStation 2, with a port to Microsoft Windows released in October of the same year. Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first installment in the series.[7]\n\nSilent Hill 4: The Room (2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fourth installment in the series follows Henry Townshend, who finds himself locked in his apartment as strange phenomena begin to unfold around him and other residents of the building. It was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows and it also marked the end of Team Silent's contributions to the series.\n\nSilent Hill: Origins (2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: Origins\n\nThe fifth installment in the series is a prequel to Silent Hill that follows trucker Travis Grady, who becomes trapped in Silent Hill after rescuing a girl from a burning house. During his quest to find the fate of the burned girl, he encounters characters from the first game and is forced to face his past.[8] It was developed by Climax Studios and released in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable, with a port for the PlayStation 2 released in 2008 and was also the first Silent Hill title developed outside Japan.[9] It is known as Silent Hill Zero in Japan.\n\nSilent Hill: Homecoming (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: Homecoming\n\nThe sixth installment in the series follows Alex Shepherd, a soldier who has returned from a war overseas. Alex discovers upon his arrival that his father has gone missing, his mother has become catatonic, and no one can provide the whereabouts of his younger brother, Joshua. The game chronicles Alex's search to find his missing brother.[10] It was developed by Double Helix Games and released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and in 2009 for Microsoft Windows.\n\nSilent Hill: Downpour (2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: Downpour\n\nThe eighth installment in the series follows Murphy Pendleton, a prisoner who is stranded in Silent Hill after his prison transport vehicle crashes. Formerly announced in April 2010[11] and developed by Vatra Games for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the game was released on March 13, 2012. It is the only game in the series that can be played in 3D (stereoscopic).\n\nSilent Hill ƒ (TBA)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill f\n\nA new mainline game, entitled Silent Hill ƒ, was announced in October 2022. Developed by studio NeoBards, with creative contributions from writer Ryukishi07, character designer \"kera\" and producer Motoi Okamoto.[13] It is a story set in Japan during the Shōwa period.[14] The story is being written by Ryukishi07, who wrote the When They Cry visual novel series.\n\nRemakes\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill: Shattered Memories (2009)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: Shattered Memories\n\nA reimagining of the first installment. Developed by Climax Studios for the Wii in December 2009, ports for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable were released in January 2010.[15] Shattered Memories retains the premise of the original game—Harry Mason's quest to find his missing daughter in the American town of Silent Hill—but is set in what appears to be a different fictional universe, following a different plot, with characters from the first game appearing altered alongside new ones. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session with an unseen patient, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, periodically interrupted by the occurrence of an environmental shift where he is pursued by monsters.\n\nShattered Memories' gameplay focuses on completion of psychological tests which alter in-game elements while in the first setting, and exploration, puzzle solving, and monster evasion when in the second setting. The game's developers avoided integrating combat into the second setting's gameplay, centering instead on a weaponless player character attempting to rescue himself from powerful opponents, as they considered this to be more fear-inducing. The game received generally positive reviews, with its graphics, storyline, voice acting, soundtrack, and use of the Wii Remote as the Wii version's controller praised by reviewers; Shattered Memories' chase sequences were criticized by some reviewers, because they deemed them potentially frustrating and short.\n\nSilent Hill 2 (2024)\n\n[edit]\n\nA remake of Silent Hill 2 was announced in October 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and PC. It will be console exclusive on the PlayStation 5 for the first 12 months but will also be released for PC.[16] Akira Yamaoka, the original composer, returns to write the score.\n\nAdaptations and collections\n\n[edit]\n\nPlay Novel: Silent Hill (2001)\n\n[edit]\n\nPlay Novel: Silent Hill is a visual novel adaptation of the original Silent Hill, released exclusively for the Game Boy Advance in Japan on March 21, 2001.[17] It has been fan translated into English.\n\nThe Silent Hill Collection (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Silent Hill Collection is a re-release of the first four mainline video games in the series for the PlayStation 2. The European release contains Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill 3, and Silent Hill 4: The Room, while the Japanese release also includes the first Silent Hill.[18]\n\nSilent Hill (mobile game) (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill (mobile game) is a mobile game adaptation of the original Silent Hill. It was released in Japan for the FOMA phone on July 5, 2006 and for Java on January 17, 2007.\n\nSilent Hill HD Collection (2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill HD Collection\n\nSilent Hill HD Collection is a high-definition re-release of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring high-resolution visuals, new sounds, new voices and Trophies/Achievements for both games. Silent Hill 2 features the option to use both the old and new voices; however, Silent Hill 3 features only a new voice track, with the old voices unavailable for legal reasons. Silent Hill 2 features both the main scenario and the Born from a Wish sub-scenario seen in later re-releases, such as the Director's Cut.[19]\n\nThis pack marked the first time Silent Hill 3 was playable on an Xbox console. The collection got mixed to negative reviews due to severe issues with both games, such as severe framerate problems, lockups and more. While the PlayStation 3 version was patched, the Xbox 360 patch was cancelled and Konami offered refunds to all Xbox 360 owners of the game.[19]\n\nSpin-offs\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill: The Arcade (2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: The Arcade\n\nSilent Hill: The Arcade is an arcade game that deals with two characters, Eric and Tina, who have entered the town of Silent Hill and must battle monsters while uncovering the mystery behind Eric's nightmares about a girl and a steamship.[20] The Arcade has a multiplayer element, where each player can choose to be either Eric or Tina.[21] A second player can join the game at any time.[22]\n\nSilent Hill: Orphan (2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: Orphan\n\nSilent Hill: Orphan is a mobile game. The game is set in an abandoned orphanage and is played through first-person, point-and-click gameplay.\n\nSilent Hill: The Escape (2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill: The Escape\n\nSilent Hill: The Escape is a mobile game. It was released in Japan for the FOMA phone December 19, 2007, and was released for the iOS internationally in 2009. The goal of the game is to guide the player through ten stages by finding a key and opening the locked door. The game is played in a first-person perspective. The game achieved mixed reviews due to lack of storyline and poor execution.[23]\n\nSilent Hill: Orphan 2 (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill: Orphan 2 is a mobile game, and a sequel to Silent Hill: Orphan.\n\nSilent Hill: Orphan 3 (2010)\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill: Orphan 3 is a mobile game, and a sequel to Silent Hill: Orphan 2.\n\nSilent Hill: Book of Memories (2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill: Book of Memories was released for the PlayStation Vita.[24][25][26][27] Book of Memories utilizes an overhead isometric view, follows a different storyline and features returning creatures from the series' fictional universe, as well as cooperative gameplay;[28] the game is the first installment in the series to feature multiplayer gameplay, apart from The Arcade.[28][29] According to series producer Tomm Hulett, Book of Memories' gameplay is largely different from the one established in previous installments in the series, focusing on cooperative multiplayer action rather than traditional psychological horror.[30]\n\nP.T. (2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: P.T. (video game)\n\nDuring Sony Computer Entertainment's presentation at Gamescom 2014, an interactive teaser titled P.T. (initialism for \"playable teaser\") was released on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4. The teaser revealed a new Silent Hill game entitled Silent Hills, being developed by Kojima Productions using the Fox Engine, and a collaboration between Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, featuring actor Norman Reedus. On September 1, Sony revealed during its pre-TGS press conference that P.T. had been downloaded over a million times and had been viewed over 30,000,000 times across platforms.[31] P.T. was pulled from the PlayStation Store and is no longer available for download.[32] Numerous remakes of P.T. have spawned as a result of the game's extremely limited availability; it remains unavailable on the PlayStation Store, and has since been blocked from running on the PlayStation 5.[33]\n\nSilent Hill: Ascension (2023)\n\n[edit]\n\nAn interactive media experience known as Silent Hill: Ascension was announced in October 2022. It was developed by Genvid Technologies, Bad Robot Games and Behaviour Interactive. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive game where viewers can vote on the direction of the story in real time, allowing them to have agency in how the singular canon progresses similar to other horror contemporaries such as Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and the 2020 continuation of Ben Drowned. The first episode was broadcast on October 31, 2023 which acted as the so-called \"series premiere\" of the interactive series. The series was broadcast daily at 9:00 PM ET/ 6:00 PM PT for \"the next several months\", with the last episode airing on April 24, 2024.[34]\n\nSilent Hill: The Short Message (2024)\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing messages from her friend Maya, Anita finds herself at a crumbling apartment block, infamous for rumors of suicides. Drawn inside, Anita soon finds her sense of reality shattered as she encounters bizarre, otherworldly spaces, haunted by a twisted monster. Maya's message was clear — \"\"can't leave til you find it\"\" — but what is it that Anita is really looking for?\n\nSilent Hill: Townfall (TBA)\n\n[edit]\n\nA new game, Silent Hill: Townfall, was announced in October 2022 with a reveal trailer. It will be developed by No Code and published by Annapurna Interactive.[35]\n\nCancelled projects\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill (Com.X graphic novel)\n\n[edit]\n\nInitially planned for release in November 1999 from publisher Com.X, a 70-page original graphic novel adaptation of the original game (ISBN:978-1903286005) was written by Jon Murphy and penciled by Neil Googe.[36] Com.X founder Eddie Deighton explained in 2008:\n\nNeil originally came for an interview as a designer at the design agency Russell and myself ran, but as soon as we saw in his portfolio that Neil had trained as a comic artist and had worked on 2000AD, we ended up talking for about 4 hours about comics and the industry in general. By the time we finished, we felt that Neil's talent would have gone to waste if we'd taken him on as a designer, so we decided instead to propose to our client, Konami, that we should work with Neil on a graphic novel for the computer game Silent Hill. They felt it would be a cool thing to do, so Neil came on board and we began developing the project. Very quickly, we found that we all got on really well and by about the third week of working together, we felt we had a lot to contribute to the comic industry in terms of enthusiasm and creativity.\n\n[37]\n\nGooge was assigned six months to finished the full colour art for the graphic novel. Although it was completed and an advertisement was featured in a European catalogue, the adaptation was never released by Konami. He took an experimental approach to the comic layout, but because of his inexperience and lack of planning at the time, felt that not everything he tried worked.[38]\n\nSilent Hill 3 (alternative versions)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original plans for Silent Hill 3 were much different than what was released. The story would have continued the \"inner fears\" concept used for James Sunderland, Angela Orosco, and Eddie Dombrowski in Silent Hill 2. However, Konami was not pleased with the slow sales of Silent Hill 2 and pushed Team Silent to turn the game into a more commercial arcade-style rail shooter spin-off (not to be confused with the later-released Silent Hill: The Arcade). This plan was rejected by the team, but the process wasted much of the budget and development time for Silent Hill 3.[39][40][41][42] Silent Hill 2 was also criticised on the internet at the time for not focusing on Alessa Gillespie and not having the same art style, characters, and creatures as the first game.[43][44] As a result, Team Silent did not immediately move forward with their original Silent Hill 3 plans, instead opting to conclude the Alessa story from the original Silent Hill and tie up loose ends to appease fans. Not every Team Silent member agreed with this decision, though Akihiro Imamura stated that they also did not want to use a similar template for two games in a row.[45]\n\nRoom 302\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Silent Hill 3 was released, Team Silent wanted to create a sequel.[1][2] In actuality, Silent Hill 3 and 4 were developed around the same time, \"almost simultaneously\".[3]\n\nDespite what has been popularized around the Internet, Silent Hill 4: The Room, in all stages of development, was always meant to be connected to Silent Hill at least as a \"spin-off of Silent Hill\". An interviewer asked:\n\n\"Is it true that The Room was not originally going to be part of the Silent Hill series and that this was only changed part way through development?\"\n\nIn response:\n\nIn a sense this is true because the game began life as simply Room 302. However, it was always at least a spin-off of Silent Hill and the most important thing was simply that it be different to the previous games. Certainly if Silent Hill had not existed we would not have gotten the idea for The Room, so in that sense they have always been together.\n\n—Interview with Masashi Tsuboyama and Akira Yamaoka[4]\n\nIt is false that this original conception (Room 302) was a completely separate horror game unrelated to Silent Hill that did not have Silent Hill in mind.\n\nFor example, the idea that 50% or more into development, Room 302 was transformed into Silent Hill 4 and that developers merely sprinkled and inserted some Silent Hill references near the final months of the development is incorrect. It's likely that before even 5-10% of the game's development, it was decided and finalized that Room 302 would be a proper Silent Hill game.\n\nSome of the different gameplay mechanics and change, such as Room 302 as a hub world, were intentional because the developers wanted \"change\" and \"new\" as the focus. There is no proof that a single idea in the final version of Silent Hill 4 (such as invincible ghosts, no flashlight, or not visiting the town of Silent Hill for much of the game) was the result of Room 302 being a spin-off or \"Silent Hill 4 never being meant to be a Silent Hill game\". Similarly, around the first half of Silent Hill 3 isn't set in the town of Silent Hill.\n\nWe wanted to make a sequel after Silent Hill 3 and you could say that was the initial concept, but upon that we needed to implement a lot of new flavor to the sequel, otherwise it would have been the same old Silent Hill. So for that, we created \"The Room\" as the concept for the game...\n\n—Interview with Masashi Tsuboyama[5]\n\nEven though the Silent Hill 4 project was a proper sequel to the Silent Hill series, our top objective for the game was \"change.\"\n\n—Interview[6]\n\nConfusion is likely due to an interview which said \"SH4 was not originally suppose to be a Silent Hill.\"[7] This is likely referring to the very early stages of Room 302 when the developers were uncertain if they wanted Room 302 to be an official Silent Hill game; this is likely not referring to when the actual development of the Silent Hill 4 project seriously began.\n\nSilent Hill 5\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore Silent Hill: Origins was made, Team Silent was tasked with working on a fifth installment in the Silent Hill series, simply titled \"Silent Hill 5\", and development started as early as Silent Hill 3. The game was delayed due to demand from fans wanting to get proper closure for the first game.[46] The planned story of Silent Hill 5 was to focus on a damaged human being summoned to Silent Hill for a certain reason. Akira Yamaoka described the story as \"the darkest story we have come up with\".[47]\n\nAnother unique feature of the game was to be the fact that it started off in Silent Hill as an everyday town with people going about their lives, which would slowly begin to rot away as players progress in the game.[48]\n\nBroken Covenant\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore Climax Studios started working on what would later become Silent Hill: Origins, they had originally pitched a different game idea to Konami in 2006. Intended to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive, the proposed game would have taken place in Arizona and starred protagonist Father Hector Santos. The priest would have utilized water, a major motif in the game, to perform \"holy rites and rituals\". The proposal never received a greenlight from Konami, and it was reimagined as an original title called Broken Covenant, but that too was eventually shelved.[49]\n\nSilent Hill (remake)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original plan for Silent Hill: Origins was to remake the original game for the PSP. But after learning how much work it would take to redo the graphics from the ground up, Climax Studios thought it would be better to create something new instead.[50] In July 2019, Masahiro Ito of Team Silent was asked if he would be willing to work on a remake of the original game. He declined, stating \"It will take about 3 years to build that. And you only live once. So repeating the same thing is just only a waste of time. Also I get bored easily.\"[51]\n\nSilent Hill: Original Sin\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Silent Hill: Origins was being developed by the LA subsidiary of Climax Studios, it was going to be a dark comedy inspired by the TV show Scrubs, using the Ghostwriter engine and an over-the-shoulder camera system. Monsters such as the Straightjackets and Butcher were still present, as well as new creatures such as the Miners, Afflicted, a wheelchair monster, Piercer, and Meat. The player would be able to place barricades to protect themselves from threats. Rather than using a Radio to alert the player of enemies, the initial game used a more visual \"chilled breath\" que instead. If there were many enemies, the edges of the screen would freeze over. Much of the map was altered in the final version of the game. Locations include a burned debilitated hotel, the Doyle Asylum for the mentally ill (which once housed Dahlia Gillespie), the Orphium movie theatre, a meat packing plant, catacombs, and the Order's lair.[52][53] The opening scene is similar to the final game's, except for Travis Grady (modelled after Norman Reedus during development)[54][55] pulling his truck over to stop Mister Twilight instead of Alessa. Twilight flees at the sight of Alessa, who turns the town into its Fog World state. Travis then loses consciousness and awakes in a hospital room, trapped in the Otherworld. Alessa makes a deal with Travis – if he helps her obtain the Flauros, she will help him escape the town. Michael Kaufmann, who works at the hospital, is studying a drug called White Claudia and believes that it is linked to the weird events happening in Silent Hill. Mister Twilight acts in the background, pulling the strings on the game's events. Travis must make his way to the cult's lair, survive traps and otherworldly threats, and separate the Real World and the Otherworld. His plan succeeds, but unleashes Alessa's nightmare onto the town. Mister Twilight is revealed to be Michael Kaufmann. In a bad ending, Travis goes insane and becomes Pyramid Head.[53]\n\nClimax was not satisfied with the direction the game was going in, citing mismanagement and fearing that it might be a disaster. The game was subsequently transferred and overhauled by Climax's UK studio.[52][53]\n\nNintendo DS titles\n\n[edit]\n\nWayForward Technologies, developers of Silent Hill: Book of Memories, worked on a series installment for the Nintendo DS in 2006. They developed a one-room prototype demo using the lead character and assets from Silent Hill 2 before the game was cancelled.[56]\n\nRenegade Kid pitched their DS title Dementium: The Ward as a Silent Hill spin-off title. It was rejected by Konami for various reasons involving Konami not wanting to trust a small company with the Silent Hill license. Renegade Kid later pitched a modified version of Dementium II which was also rejected, but for Konami simply not wanting to enter the DS space with a horror title at the time.[57]\n\nThe Box\n\n[edit]\n\nSilicon Knights announced the titles in production when the company ceased development in 2012. One of these games was called Silent Hill: The Box,[58] but later became known as The Box, which could have been the codename for the title after a publishing deal fell through given the company's financial status. Some early conceptual screenshots from the game can be seen in the Silent Hill Memories website.[59]\n\nBrahms PD\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter creating Silent Hill: Origins, director Sam Barlow and his team at Climax Studios wanted to create a new Silent Hill game on PSP. However, Silent Hill's US producer suggested a Nintendo Wii release of a first-person shooter set in the universe of the series. Climax started a project called Brahms PD, a spin-off to the main franchise with an amnesiac police detective searching for his partner as the protagonist. Apart from the shooting gameplay, transition sequences featuring sessions with a police psychiatrist were to be implemented, making this game \"the world's first truly interactive psychological horror\". This project did not receive Konami's approval, and was abandoned.\n\nSilent Hill: Cold Heart\n\n[edit]\n\nSilent Hill: Cold Heart was the originally planned version of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.[60] The game would have followed a female protagonist called Jessica Chambers as she decides to take a trip to visit her parents. However, in doing so she becomes trapped in an enormous snowstorm. To save her herself, she follows an ambulance in hopes of finding a safe place, which would leave her to suddely end up in Silent Hill.[61] Compared to Shattered Memories where running is the only way to avoid enemies, the game would have retained the use of Melee Combat from previous games. These combat moments were meant to take advantage of the Wii controller to create a real and intense experience using improvised weapons.[60]\n\n2013 sequel\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2013, Masahiro Ito was involved in a direct sequel to Silent Hill 3. Ito was displeased with the way the character Pyramid Head was used in later installments of the series[62] and wanted to reintroduce the antagonist Valtiel. An opening scene in the Otherworld involving a baby carriage was also envisioned, in which Valtiel would slaughter Pyramid Head.[62] The game was eventually cancelled, but as late as 2017, Ito has stated that if he ever makes a new game, he would carry out his plan to kill Pyramid Head or just not use him.[63]\n\nSilent Hills\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hills\n\nDuring Sony Computer Entertainment's presentation at Gamescom 2014, an interactive teaser titled P.T. (initialism for \"playable teaser\") was released on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4. The teaser revealed a new Silent Hill game entitled Silent Hills, being developed by Kojima Productions using the Fox Engine, and a collaboration between Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, featuring actor Norman Reedus.\n\nDuring the 2015 San Francisco Film Festival on April 26, del Toro revealed that he would no longer be involved in the project with Kojima, presumably due to Kojima leaving Konami.[31] Konami later released a statement confirming the departure of Reedus but clarified the series would continue to be developed, with no mention of the current status of Silent Hills.[64] Days later, Konami confirmed that Silent Hills was cancelled, but was open to future collaborations with Reedus and del Toro.[65]\n\nThe cancellation of the game was met with significant backlash from fans, who later started a petition on Change.org asking for Konami to continue the project. The petition has received 194,651 signatures as of 11 August 2024 .[66]\n\nSilent Hill anthology (Supermassive Games)\n\n[edit]\n\nKonami began soliciting pitches for new Silent Hill titles in 2018, including for an episodic series. Supermassive Games were among the developers to pitch the title, but Konami ultimately turned them down in favor of collaborating with Annapurna Interactive. Supermassive's Silent Hill proposal was repurposed as the framework for their Dark Pictures Anthology series.[67][68][69][70][71]\n\nSilent Hill 2 (remake) (HexaDrive)\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite interest in the Silent Hill franchise within Konami, it remained dormant for years due to internal disagreement on what direction it should take. Motoi Okamoto, who left Entersphere in 2018, subsequently joined the company and became the series producer in 2019.[72][73][74] The film Return to Silent Hill, developed by Christophe Gans, ultimately served as the catalyst for Konami's decision to revitalize the brand.[75]\n\nMany independent and third party horror games had taken inspiration from Silent Hill during its absence. Konami's staff, including Okamoto, felt they needed to reaffirm the core identity of the series in order to stand apart from other titles. They concluded that what makes Silent Hill unique is how it embodies \"true psychological horror\" and chose to reboot Silent Hill 2 for that reason. Some of the staff disagreed with this decision and lobbied to remake the first installment instead, which had been previously reimagined as Shattered Memories in 2009.[72]\n\nKonami originally reached out to HexaDrive about potentially porting the Silent Hill series for the current-gen consoles, specifically Silent Hill 2, but HexaDrive instead chosed to remake.\n\nKonami invited HexaDrive to a meeting around 2019, alongside several competing studios, in which they were asked to create a pitch demo for a Silent Hill 2 remake. Out of the studios, their proposal was ultimately turned down in favor of collaborating with Bloober Team.[75]\n\nHexaDrive later went on to co-develop with Konami a PS5-exclusive Silent Hill spin-off titled, Silent Hill: The Short Message.\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2022, in an interview with French gaming website JeuxVideo.Com, Christophe Gans (director of the 2006 Silent Hill movie) confirmed that he had completed a script for a third Silent Hill film, and was aiming for a 2023 release for the project. He later reiterated this in an interview with JeuxActu, and elaborated that the third film project is to be part of what will be a \"relaunch\" of the Silent Hill brand, accompanied by new video games.[76]\n\nIn October, Gans spoke once again about the upcoming relaunch and his third film, stating during an interview at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival that \"I know a bit about the [next Silent Hill game]. I work with Team Silent, the original creators. I work in collaboration with Konami\", suggesting that members of the original development team, Team Silent, are involved with the upcoming game(s).[77][78] On October 19, Konami released a video revealing a new film, Return to Silent Hill, and several new Silent Hill games: a Silent Hill 2 remake, Silent Hill: Townfall and Silent Hill f.[79][80] Both Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito are confirmed to be returning for the Silent Hill 2 remake; Yamaoka as composer and Ito as the lead concept artist.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nRecurring elements\n\n[edit]\n\nPlot traits and symbolism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe plots of the installments in the Silent Hill series, except Shattered Memories and The Room, share a common setting: the foggy rural American town of Silent Hill, which is a fictional location set in the northeastern United States: some games specifically reference the town as being located in Maine, whereas in the film the town is set in West Virginia. The town in the first three games was inspired by concepts of a small town in America as depicted by various media from various countries of origin. While some of the development planning is more reminiscent of that of a Japanese village, indirect influence comes from perhaps two factual American towns in particular: Cushing, Maine[b] and Snoqualmie, Washington.[c] The town from the film series, however, was inspired by Centralia, Pennsylvania.[d] Silent Hill is depicted in Shattered Memories as a heavily snow-covered town in the midst of a blizzard, while the events of The Room primarily occur in the fictional neighboring city of South Ashfield, with the player venturing forth to smaller locales around Silent Hill.\n\nThe series' player characters experience an occasional dark alteration of reality called the \"Otherworld\".[81] In that reality, physical law often does not apply,[82] with varying forms but most frequently ones whose physical appearance is based on that of Silent Hill, and the series' characters experience delusions and encounter tangible symbols of elements from their unconscious minds, mental states, and innermost thoughts when present in it,[82][83] manifested into the real world. The origin of these manifestations is a malevolent power native to Silent Hill, which materializes human thoughts; this force was formerly non-evil, but was corrupted by the occurrence of certain events in the area.[82]\n\nSome recurring monsters include the Nurses, who are included in almost every Silent Hill game, typically due to the sexual frustration or health conditions many of the protagonists experience during the course of the game's events; Pyramid Head, another recurring monster who became the series mascot, whose canon appearances have been contested; and Robbie the Rabbit, an amusement park mascot. A dog named Mira is also included in many joke endings. Another recurring plot trait in the Silent Hill series is a fictional religious cult known only as The Order. The organization has certain members who act as antagonists in most of the series' installments (such as Dahlia in the first and prequel, Claudia in 3, Walter in The Room, and Judge Holloway in Homecoming), and operates the \"Wish House\" (also called \"Hope House\"), an orphanage for poor and homeless children built by a charity organization called the \"Silent Hill Smile Support Society\".[84]\n\nThe religion followed by the Order is focused on the worship of a chief deity,[85] who is named Samael in Origins,[86] but simply referred to as \"God\" in the previous games. The group's dogma is derived from a myth: the deity set out to create paradise, but ran out of power during the process; she will someday be resurrected, thus becoming able to finally create paradise and save mankind.[85] The town's cult repeatedly participates in illegal acts: ritual human sacrifices whose purpose is the deity's resurrection,[87] illegal drug trade,[88] and kidnapping and confinement of children in a facility to teach them its dogma through brainwashing, while presenting the facility as an orphanage.[84] Also repeatedly featured are various religious items with magical properties, appearing widely in the games of the series.[89]\n\nThree thematic elements consistently drive the narratives of Silent Hill games: the theme of a main protagonist who is depicted as an \"everyman\" (with the exception of Homecoming, where the protagonist is thought to be a soldier and the game's mechanics operate as such),[90] and the everyman's quest, either a search for a missing loved one[91] or a situation where the protagonist wanders into the town apparently by accident but is in fact being \"summoned\" by a spiritual force in the town.\n\nMultiple endings are a staple of the series, with all installments featuring some, the realization of which often depends on in-game actions performed by the player.[92][93] In all but three of the series' games, one of these endings is a joke ending in which the main protagonist comes in contact with unidentified flying objects: there is no joke ending in Silent Hill 4: The Room, and the only joke ending in Downpour is a surprise party for the player featuring characters from previous installments of the franchise, with a similar joke ending in Book of Memories.[94]\n\nThe installments in the Silent Hill series contain various symbolism. The symbols are images, sounds, objects, creatures, or situations, and represent concepts and facts, as well as feelings, emotions, and mental states of the characters.[95][96][97][98][99]\n\nGameplay\n\n[edit]\n\nThe installments in the Silent Hill series use a third-person view, with occasional fixed camera angles. While visibility is low due to the alternating fog and darkness, all of the series' player characters, except Henry Townshend of Silent Hill 4: The Room, are equipped with a flashlight and a portable device which warns the player of nearby monsters by emitting static (a transistor radio in Origins and the first three installments, a walkie-talkie in Homecoming and Downpour, and a mobile phone in Shattered Memories).[103][104]\n\nThe player characters of every Silent Hill game have access to a variety of melee weapons and firearms, with Origins and Downpour also featuring rudimentary hand-to-hand combat.[105] Shattered Memories is the sole exception: it is designed without combat and based around evasion of the creatures. Another key feature of the series' gameplay is puzzle-solving, which often results in the acquisition of an item essential to advance in the games.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nConcept and influences\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment of the Silent Hill series started in September 1996 with the beginning of the development of its first installment, Silent Hill.[106] The game was created by Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio.[107][108][109] The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be successful in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for it. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.[110]\n\nThe first installment's scenario was created by director Keiichiro Toyama.[111] The story of the second installment, Silent Hill 2, was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on the novel Crime and Punishment, with individual members of the team collaborating on the game's actual scenario;[112][113][114] the main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato.[112][113][115]\n\nThe first game, Silent Hill, utilizes real-time 3D environments. To mitigate limitations of the hardware, developers liberally used fog and darkness to muddle the graphics.[3]\n\nSato estimated the budget of the first installment at US$3–5 million and Silent Hill 2's at US$7–10 million.[113] He said that the development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature.[110]\n\nThe games are known to have drawn influence from media such as Jacob's Ladder; Phantoms; Session 9; Alien; Stephen King's The Mist; and the art of Francis Bacon, largely through cultivating a technique of inducing fear through more psychological levels of perception. Many sequences and tropes from these films share identical concepts.[116][117] The films and television series of American filmmaker David Lynch are also acknowledged to have influenced Team Silent during the initial games' production,[118][119] especially that of Silent Hill 2.[119]\n\nAnother major influence is Japanese horror, with comparisons made to classical Japanese Noh theatre and early 20th-century fiction writers such as the Japanese Edogawa Rampo.[120] The town of Silent Hill is a small rural American town imagined by the creative team. It was based on Western literature and films, as well as on depictions of American towns in European and Russian culture.[110] The version of the town from the film adaptations of the first and third games is loosely based on the central Pennsylvania town of Centralia.[e]\n\nThe Order's religion is based on various characteristics of different religions, such as the origins of Christianity, Aztec rituals, Shinto shrines, as well as Japanese folklore. The names of gods in the organization's religion were conceived by Hiroyuki Owaku, but they have Aztec and Mayan motifs, as Owaku used pronunciations from these civilizations as a reference.[85] Certain religious items appearing in the series were conceived by the team and for some others various religions were used as a basis: the evil spirit-dispelling substance Aglaophotis, which appears in the first installment and Silent Hill 3, is based on a herb of similar name and nature in the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism); the name of the talisman called \"Seal of Metatron\" references the angel Metatron.[89]\n\nAudio\n\n[edit]\n\nThe installments in the Silent Hill series feature various sound effects,[95][121] some of them being ambient, as well as silence;[121] the sound effects have been added with the intent of inducing certain emotions and feelings in the player,[95][121] such as urgency, displeasure,[121] or a sense of disturbance of their psyche.[95] According to the series' former sound director Akira Yamaoka, atmosphere is an emphasized element of the series, if which had not been given importance, the series' production would have been impossible.[121] The games also feature soundtracks scored by Yamaoka.[122][123][124][125][126][127][128]\n\nThe genres of the musical pieces range from industrial to trip hop to rock, and some pieces include vocals by voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.[91][124][125][126][127][128] The music of Silent Hill 3 and 4 also contains performance and songwriting contributions from musician and voice actor Joe Romersa.[129] Downpour and Book of Memories feature soundtracks scored by composer Daniel Licht;[28][130] Downpour includes music belonging to the industrial genre and vocals by McGlynn as well as by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn.[130][131]\n\nReception and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nAggregate review scores Game Metacritic Silent Hill (PS1) 86/100[132] Silent Hill 2 (PS2) 89/100[133]\n\n(Xbox) 84/100[134]\n\n(PC) 70/100[135] Silent Hill 3 (PS2) 85/100[136]\n\n(PC) 72/100[137] Silent Hill 4: The Room (PS2) 76/100[138]\n\n(Xbox) 76/100[139]\n\n(PC) 67/100[140] Silent Hill: Origins (PSP) 78/100[141]\n\n(PS2) 70/100[142] Silent Hill: Homecoming (PS3) 71/100[143]\n\n(X360) 70/100[144]\n\n(PC) 64/100[145] Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (Wii) 79/100[146]\n\n(PS2) 77/100[147]\n\n(PSP) 73/100[148] Silent Hill: Downpour (X360) 68/100[149]\n\n(PS3) 64/100[150] Silent Hill HD Collection (PS3) 70/100[151]\n\n(X360) 69/100[152] Silent Hill: Book of Memories (Vita) 58/100[153] Silent Hill: The Short Message (PS5) 53/100[154]\n\nThe Silent Hill franchise has been praised for its graphics, atmosphere, and narrative. While the first three installments received critical acclaim, and the fourth game received general praise from critics, later games in the series were less well received.[155]\n\nThe first installment in the series, Silent Hill, received a positive response from critics on its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, moving away from B movie horror elements toward a psychological style of horror emphasizing atmosphere.[3]\n\nSilent Hill 2 received critical acclaim. It was named the fourteenth best game of the PS2 by IGN, saying that \"it preserved most of the original game's what-might-be-out-there fear, but with major advances to the graphics and sound, the game was able to deliver a far more immersive, frightful and compelling storyline\".[156] Silent Hill 2 is considered one of the best horror games of all time by many, as it features on several \"best games ever\" lists by critics.\n\nPraise was particularly aimed at the dark, cerebral narrative and storytelling, exploration and handling of mature themes and concepts, such as mental illness and domestic abuse, the sound design and musical composition, the atmospheric and frightening tone and direction, fear-inducing and tense gameplay, along with the graphics, and the symbolic nature of the monster designs. Silent Hill 2 is widely considered to be the best installment in the Silent Hill game series and is considered by many to be a masterpiece of the horror game genre.\n\nSilent Hill 3 was well received by critics, especially in its presentation, including its environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes that are continued from past installments.[157][158] The game received praise for its story, which was a continuation of the first game's story.[159][160]\n\nIn comparison to the previous three installments, Silent Hill 4: The Room was met with a mostly positive reception, though lower than that of the game's predecessors; many reviewers disliked the increased emphasis on combat, lessening the focus on the horror aspect of gameplay, while praise was aimed at the atmospheric tone and direction, the sound design, graphics and the storyline, while the changes from the series' conventions were met with a range of responses, varying from positive to negative. 1UP.com said that Konami went \"backwards\" with this game,[161] though reviewers such as GameSpot still praised the game's atmosphere.[162]\n\nOrigins received positive reviews despite some criticism. It was praised for going back to the old gameplay formula—according to IGN, Origins does justice to the series as a whole. However, some criticized the series' increasing predictability. GameSpot stated that \"this old fog needs to learn some new tricks\".[163]\n\nHomecoming received mixed reviews. It was praised for its graphics and audio, but the horror and gameplay have been met with mixed reactions. Some critics, such as GameSpot, felt that it lost \"the psychological horror factor that the series is so well-known for\".[164] Some critics were harsher; IGN called the game a \"letdown\".[165]\n\nShattered Memories received more positive reviews. GameSpot praised the game's effort at reinventing the first game's plot, rather than being a simple remake.[166]\n\nDownpour received mixed reviews. While certain critics praised the soundtrack and story elements, it has been let down by \"sluggish combat\" and \"occasional freezes\".\n\nHD Collection has also received mixed reviews. Critics criticised towards many technical issues plaguing both games and artistic changes made to the games. Book of Memories, while receiving mixed reviews, has been the least well received game in the series, with most criticism regarding the game's shift in genre.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers have cited Silent Hill as an influence on their 2016 television show Stranger Things. They noted that it inspired the Upside Down, a parallel dimension in the series.[167]\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nPrint media of the Silent Hill franchise include a series of comic book adaptations;[168][169][170] the novels Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 by Sadamu Yamashita, which are novelizations of their eponymous video games;[171] the guide book Lost Memories; and the art book Drawing Block: Silent Hill 3 Program.\n\nSpin-off video games based on the series include the arcade game Silent Hill: The Arcade,[172] and the mobile games Silent Hill: Orphan and Silent Hill: The Escape.[173]\n\nKonami has announced Silent Hill-themed pachinko machines, one in 2015 and another two titled Silent Hill: Return and Silent Hill: Escape in 2020.[174][175]\n\nDownloadable content for the video games Dead by Daylight and Dark Deception: Monsters & Mortals, were released in June 2020 and March 2021 respectively.\n\nFilm series\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Silent Hill (film series)\n\nA film adaptation of the first game in the series, Silent Hill, was released in 2006. It was adapted and directed by French film director, producer and writer Christophe Gans. Gans himself is a big fan of the Silent Hill game series. A second film adaptation, titled Silent Hill: Revelation, written and directed by M. J. Bassett and based on Silent Hill 3,[176] was released in 2012. Christophe Gans expressed an interest in making a third film in a 2020 interview, stating that a script is being developed centred on puritanism.[177] In October 2022, a sequel to the first film was announced to be in early development, referred to as Return to Silent Hill, with Gans returning to direct and the film being based on Silent Hill 2.[178]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Axis of Perdition, an industrial black metal band, recorded Physical Illucinations in the Sewer of Xuchilbara (The Red God), a 2004 EP named after a god from the franchise. There's also a reference to being recorded \"in the confines of Toluca Prison\", a location from Silent Hill 2. The track lists and tracks themselves also reference Silent Hill and feature music and voice samples, most notably of Claudia Wolf, the main antagonist of Silent Hill 3.[179]\n\nDementium: The Ward, a survival horror game for the Nintendo DS, was originally pitched as a Silent Hill game, though it was turned down by Konami.[180]\n\nDementium II, a survival horror game for the Nintendo DS, was originally pitched as a Silent Hill game, though it was turned down by Konami.[57]\n\nThe \"Upside Down\", a location in the Netflix 2016 horror TV series Stranger Things, is inspired by the series' namesake foggy town.[181]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
