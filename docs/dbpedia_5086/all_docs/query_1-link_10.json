She descends into the center of the twisted reality of a town's terrible secret. Pursued by grotesquely deformed creatures and townspeople stuck in permanent purgatory, Rose begins to uncover the truth behind the apocalyptic disaster that burned the town 30 years earlier.\n\nDare to step inside the horrific town of Silent Hill, where darkness preys on every soul and Hell's creations await around every corner. But know that once you enter ... there is no turning back. This stylish horror film was directed by Christophe Gans (Brotherhood Of The Wolf) and co-stars Sean Bean (Game Of Thrones), Alice Krige (Star Trek: First Contact) and Laurie Holden (The Walking Dead)."
