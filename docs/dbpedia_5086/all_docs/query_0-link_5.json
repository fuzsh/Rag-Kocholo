The only one. Screw Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, and whatever that game on the Gamecube was (can't place the name.)\n\nRE started it, but damn, it's nothing scary now. It's just seeing if you can solve the puzzles, and mutilate the zombies as much as possible.\n\nI hope the SH movie doesn't suck as much as the RE one totally did.\n\nNew Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 21, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n346\n\nBest answers\n\n0\n\n#9\n\nHOW CAN IT SUCK ALL the game is WALK AROUND AND THEN HOLY **** AHHHHHH, Something jumps in front of the guy.

They totally ditched the horror aspect of the game, and went for hardcore action.\n\nNew Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 28, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n58\n\nBest answers\n\n0\n\n#12\n\nsure the GAME was scary, but u know there is gonna b some flaw in the movie (i.e. mario movie, tomb raider movie, re movie, etc.) all video game movies turn out bad, but who knows, this one could break the pattern, but the odds r against it....still i'll go c it.\n\np.s. u know their makin a dbz movie? its gonna look dumb...how r they gonna do the hair?\n\nNew Member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 29, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n331\n\nBest answers\n\n0\n\n#13\n\nOriginally posted by Checkplease\n\nYES, WARNER BROS HAS ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A SILENT HILL MOVIE.....All i gotta say is.......MOMMY HELP ME....If they do this right this could be the scariest movie EVER!

I saw it in the International channel once. Goku was called Monkey Boy.\n\nAnyways, I thought Resident Evil games were pretty scary during the zombie surprise scene hah or in RE Nemesis when Nemesis suddenly pops out and yells out \"STARS!\"\n\nIve never tried Silent Hill, but you guys got me thinking about it."
