        "text": "Darkknight2149\n\nBan made permanent due to harassment of staff\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\n6,401\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#1\n\nAs you may recall, Christophe Gans expressed an interest in making a new Silent Hill film in 2020 and stated that he was working on a script.\n\nI have two horror film projects with Victor Hadida. I'm working on the adaptation of the video game Project Zero (known as Fatal Frame in the United States, editor's note) . The film will take place in Japan. I definitely don't want to uproot the game from its Japanese haunted house setting. And we're also working on a new Silent Hill. The project will always be anchored in this atmosphere of a small American town, ravaged by Puritanism. I think it's time to make a new one.\n\nWhat did you think of the sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation ?\n\nHonestly ? I never saw it. I had to direct it, but when I understood that the producers wanted to make the film a kind of Resident Evil , I refused. I wanted to stay true to my orthodoxy. For example, Crying Freeman and Beauty and the Beast remain very close to their original works. These are works of art that were developed in a different medium so I can't assume the right to damage it. Unfortunately for the Silent Hill sequel , the audience verdict was stark, so again, no regrets ( laughs ).\n\nGérardmer 2020 : un nouveau Silent Hill, le fantastique, les séries... Christophe Gans nous dit tout\n\nMembre du jury de la 27e édition du festival de Gérardmer, le réalisateur Christophe Gans s'est laissé aller à quelques confessions sur son amour pour le cinéma de genre et ses futurs projets.\n\nWell, per French magazine Jeuxvideo, Christophe Gans just gave an update and Silent Hill 3 might be further along than we suspected.\n\nthepenguin55\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n12,552\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#2\n\nHim? Again? Why? Like, the first movie wasn't awful but almost none of the changes that were made to SH1's story were an improvement and were mostly bad. The best things about that movie were when they just recreated stuff from the games 1:1. I get you can't necessarily just translate the game to a film with making adjustments but they could've adapted that story more 1:1 than they did and it would've been significantly better for it.\n\nToadPacShakur\n\nProphet of Truth\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,528\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#3\n\nGoddamnit they're making another one??\n\nPlease, Konami.. you milked and ruined Silent Hill's teets dry with terrible game after terrible after terrible movie after terrible remaster collection after terrible movie after terrible handheld game after terrible game\n\nPlanetSmasher\n\nThe Abominable Showman\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n121,660\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#4\n\nHis first movie was bad, so I don't really think I need to see how his take on Silent Hill has \"evolved\" after 15 years when the series has been mostly dead the entire time since his film came out.\n\nLaneDS\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,771\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#5\n\nIt's far from perfect but I really enjoyed his (to a point) very faithful original Silent Hill movie- I don't think there are many directors out there that would have, say, used Akira Yamaoka's soundtracks directly.\n\nEspecially at the time of its release it was nice to see a video game adaptation that seemed to (at least sort of!) understand and appreciate its source material.\n\nAbaddonn\n\nDec 4, 2018\n\n289\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#6\n\nI kinda liked the first Silent Hill movie too, there's definately room for improvement but it was enjoyable, unlike most other videogame adaptations.\n\nJJD\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n4,681\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#7\n\nGans is not a bad film maker and has a good eye he still is a good fit. I just hope they have a better script.\n\nLazyLain\n\nJan 17, 2019\n\n6,695\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#8\n\nThe first movie wasn't great and there were a number of questionable changes, but it did have some strong points and Christophe's passion for the series seems genuine. It'll surely be much better than the 2nd movie at the very least.\n\nBut, uh, I'm definitely more interested in a Fatal Frame movie.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nDarkknight2149\n\nBan made permanent due to harassment of staff\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\n6,401\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#9\n\nIt's far from perfect but I really enjoyed his (to a point) very faithful original Silent Hill movie- I don't think there are many directors out there that would have, say, used Akira Yamaoka's soundtracks directly.\n\nEspecially at the time of its release it was nice to see a video game adaptation that seemed to (at least sort of!) understand and appreciate its source material.\n\nI honestly have to disagree that the film was faithful (aside from the aesthetics and music). Most of the story/lore was changed in weird ways, and the movies and games are also different genres of horror. The Silent Hill films are slasher movies with fantasy elements, while the games are closer to a David Lynch or Lars Von Trier film.\n\nIn fact, a lot of what Gans says about the Silent Hill games is inaccurate.\n\nNotes from the Director - Silent Hill Memories\n\nSilent Hill movie: information, review, cast, props, media, photos, videos\n\nbastardly\n\nNov 8, 2017\n\n10,754\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#10\n\nman SH just because the premier monkey paw franchise on all fronts\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#11\n\nFirst movie was pretty good tbh. Not great, but good. He's a director with a style and an eye and the atmosphere was great.\n\nThat second one (that he wasn't involved with) is a huge fucking piece of trash.\n\nshaneo632\n\nWeekend Planner\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n29,794\n\nWrexham, Wales\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#12\n\nNot convinced it will get made, at least with Gans directing.\n\nfontguy\n\nOct 8, 2018\n\n16,627\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#13\n\nGans is not a bad film maker and has a good eye he still is a good fit. I just hope they have a better script.\n\nBut he was one of the writers for the first movie.\n\njroc74\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n30,025\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#14\n\nThis is the first time i've heard of this.\n\nToadPacShakur\n\nProphet of Truth\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,528\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#15\n\nThe first movie is good if you never played the games and all you know of the series is foggy town with pyramid guy\n\ndpanim\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,603\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#16\n\nI'm happy he's returning. You can tell Gans has a passion for the franchise that would not be there if they got basically any other director, which I think is important. First movie was pretty good. Aesthetically it was pretty on point, I just hope the script this time is way better.\n\nWanderer5\n\nProphet of Truth\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n11,164\n\nSomewhere.\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#17\n\nFirst movie definitely had a great feel for being Silent Hill, although the pacing could had been better, and wasn't really fond of Gans's reason for not having Harry.\n\nMilfanito ~\n\nApr 1, 2022\n\n155\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#18\n\nGreat. The first movie was definitely not perfect but it was a good movie, especially compared to the second one. In almost any list about best movies based on videogames his Silent Hill is always there.\n\nI respect Christophe Gans a lot, I feel him very genuine in his words. A few weeks ago he was at the Cannes Film Festival presenting an extended and remastered version of Le Pacte des Loups ( Bloodborne took a lot from it), 21 years after its release, by the way a very good movie if you haven't seen it.\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#19\n\nThe best parts of the movie were the ones he didn't touch :/\n\nblackw0lf48\n\nJan 2, 2019\n\n3,259\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#20\n\nAlways wondered how much of the film was Gans vision and how much was the studios. For example we know that the studio forced him to include Pyramid Head, which was one of the worst parts of the movie.\n\nP-Bo\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nJun 17, 2019\n\n4,405\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#21\n\nDoes he still think male characters being vulnerable isn't very \"masculine\"? If so, hard pass on seeing anything SH-related with his involvement.\n\nJJD\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n4,681\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#22\n\nBut he was one of the writers for the first movie.\n\nYes? With Avary.\n\nEveryone can improve, do better, etc.\n\nMinusTydus\n\nJul 28, 2018\n\n8,407\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#23\n\nThat Fatal Frame movie has been in development hell for\n\nTWENTY\n\nFUCKING\n\nYEARS\n\nIn May 2002, Tecmo announced via press release that they were negotiating with DreamWorks to create a movie based on Fatal Frame.[1]​ A year later, they announced that the movie was in pre-production; screenwriters Robert Fyvolent and Mark R. Brinker had been hired to write the screenplay, and shooting would begin in 2004.[2]​ John Rogers, screenwriter for The Core, was slated to be the producer.[3]​ In October 2003, a further press release stated that production was being fast-tracked, and Steven Spielberg had taken a personal interest in the project. John Rogers was quoted as saying that the story would remain set in Japan.[4]​\n\nKDC720\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,562\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#24\n\nHis movie was decent enough, at least by the standards of video game adaptations at the time which admittedly was not a high bar. There's certainly a lot of room for improvement and he seems to have a genuine interest in the franchise so I don't mind him getting a second shot.\n\nI always thought Silent Hill would work far better adapted as a television series. Especially nowadays in the age of prestige TV, put it on HBO and make it a limited anthology series, each season would follow a new character or something.\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#25\n\nI read the name Cristophe Gans and it was inevitable to remember why he removed Harry from the film and was replaced by Rose da Silva lmao. Those were different times, but still.\n\nLet's see how \"faithful\" his new project will be, since the first movie changed a lot of things.\n\nfontguy\n\nOct 8, 2018\n\n16,627\n\nJun 7, 2022\n\n#26\n\nYes? With Avary.\n\nEveryone can improve, do better, etc.\n\nHey I'd love to believe that.\n\nFuddyDuddy\n\nNov 4, 2019\n\n119\n\nJun 8, 2022\n\n#27\n\nThe first movie was shot well but had lots of other questionable decisions to say the least.

In an interview you mention that the main character was changed to a woman because you believed Harry's qualities were feminine but isn't the protection and well being of a child the responsibility of every parent?\n\n- Stuart A.\n\nI think when Roger Avary and Nickolas Boukhrief and I started to work on the project we assumed, because we are all fans of the game, that we would start writing with Harry Mason as our lead.\n\nIt quickly became clear however Harry never acted like a masculine character. He was constantly dizzy, fainting, talking to himself, screaming and in fact was very vulnerable. We didn't want to betray the nature of the game by changing the character's feelings and motivations, so we felt it was better to change to a female protagonist and retain all those important qualities. I don't want people to think that I have been \"politically correct\" because we changed Harry into Rose. There is no political correctness in Silent Hill.\n\nIt's important to mention that we were conscious that allowing the Gamers to have to face a new character would help in the transition from Silent Hill the Game to Silent Hill the Movie.\n\nInfiniteKing\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n2,290\n\nJun 8, 2022\n\n#36\n\nYeah, from the link that Darkknight2149 posted above\n\nno Political correctness in silent hill. This guy is garbage.\n\nthe ironic part is actually, Harry always had the calmest voice to me, he never screams outside of yelling Cheryl's name.\n\nModest_Modsoul\n\nLiving the Dreams\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n25,041\n\nJun 8, 2022\n\n#37\n\nThat Fatal Frame film is new to me.\n\nI somehow thought that it already have film adaptation, but maybe I mixed it with other films/games?\n\n🤷\n\nBut a new Silent Hill film by Gans again...\n\nEh... 🙄🤷\n\nLast edited: Jun 8, 2022\n\nSesha\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n10,081\n\nJun 8, 2022\n\n#38\n\nThe movie got the aesthetics and music right and basically nothing else.
