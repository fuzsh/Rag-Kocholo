        "text": "VIDEO: Trailer - Silent Hill\n\nSilent Hill is more deadly than silent. People talk way too much, and a lot of what the characters have to say in this admittedly creepy video-game-to-horror-movie adaptation is mind-numbingly stupid.\n\nRadha Mitchell, as Rose DaSilva, has lost her adopted daughter Sharon in a ghost town in the mountains of West Virginia (as you do). The town sits atop an abandoned coalmine that has been burning for 30 years. There's a permanent flutter of snow-like ash, and the fumes are toxic. Every so often, an air raid siren blares, the sky goes black and the known world turns into Armageddon, populated by hairless, faceless, grey blobby mutants of the flesh-eating kind.\n\nA leather-clad motorcycle cop of the female kind called Cybil (Laurie Holden) joins Rose in her search for Sharon, after first arresting her. Soon Rose's hubby, Christopher (Sean Bean), comes charging up the hill to rescue all, but he's stopped by a local policeman (Kim Coates), who knows some things. They converge on the school, where Rose and Cybil are being attacked by a semi-naked CG giant with a metal pyramid where his head should be. He thrusts a three-metre-long knife blade (and metaphor) through the metal door, behind which our heroines are hiding. Insects as big as rats swarm in through the hole to attack them. Mysteriously and fortuitously, they all turn into ash and the metal-headed dude withdraws.\n\nRose then tells gun-toting Cybil to calm down. \"Hey, it's gonna be OK,\" says Rose, a statement which qualifies her for both optimist of the year and the nearest psychiatric institution.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it was meant to get a laugh. It's hard to tell with Silent Hill. Some of the dialogue is so bad and the situations so silly that you know someone was laughing while thinking them up.\n\nTechnically, that is supposed to be the writer, Roger Avary, but I have my doubts about much of the dialogue. The man who co-wrote Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs is unlikely to have been happy with Rose's speech to religious maniac Christabel, played by Alice Krige: \"You burned in the fire that you started and nothing can save you, because you're already damned.\" And the horse you rode in on, I said to myself.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of a very successful Japanese computer game, but directed by a Frenchman, Christophe Gans, and that may explain it.\n\nObviously, they put the Japanese computer game dialogue through an auto-translator into French, and then into English. That's why Alessa, the alter ego of Sharon, the missing girl (both played by Jodelle Ferland) can say, when the film is reaching its fiery climax: \"And now the dream of this life must end and so, too, must the dreamers within it - for 30 years they have lied to their own souls, for 30 years they have denied their own fate, but now is the end of days and I am the reaper.\"\n\nOmigod, shut up, will ya?\n\n\"Burn them,\" cries Christabel and, for once, I had to agree. If this is what witches sound like, I'll bring the wood.\n\nWithout the dialogue, some of the film would be effectively chilling. It looks superb, with our own comely Radha stumbling through the foggy, ash-covered streets of small-town America, deserted and nightmarish. Gans knows how to unsettle us with a slow-moving camera and how to build a suspenseful sequence. The production design makes your flesh creep, too - dark halls, damp floors, subterranean mazes.\n\nI gather a lot of this is faithful to the video game, and that will please the target audience. Plot, character, dialogue and especially logic are less important to the game boys and girls. They want to see a bigger, scarier version of the world they imagined in front of their computer screens. This kind of movie adaptation is a communal thing, in that sense, a place for the initiated to gather and figuratively gnaw on each other's limbs for 125 long minutes.\n\nI'd rather eat my own liver with a nice chianti than sit through it again, but that's just me."
