        "text": "Silent Hill is said to be one of the greatest horror video games ever created. And the franchise, created in the late 1990s on PlayStation, is making a comeback.\n\nKonami and Bloober Team reinvent the horror classic Silent Hill for PS5\n\n“To bring Silent Hill back to life, we felt it was essential to work with fans of the series,” explains Motoi Okamoto, producer at Konami Digital Entertainment. “The Silent Hill saga has been silent for many years. However, during this dormant period, we received many pitches for new games and remakes. This is a franchise that many fans love.” In a press release, Konami Digital Entertainment they will mark the occasion for Silent Hill Transmission. Silent Hill 2 will be getting a remake, developed by Bloober Team, a studio of enthusiasts, specialised in horror games and most importantly, great fans of the Silent Hill universe.\n\nThe main objective for Mateusz Lenart, creative director and lead designer of Bloober Team? “To preserve the atmosphere that made Silent Hill 2 so exceptional, while modernising many aspects of its gameplay”: “We are working hand in hand with the original creators, notably Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito, to keep the Silent Hill feel intact. Part of the new elements revealed in the presentation trailer is the use of a handheld camera point-of-view. With this angle, we want to immerse players even deeper into the game, making them feel like they’re part of this supernatural world and providing an even more visceral experience in every way.”\n\nWhile fans of the video game series will be delighted with the care shown with this remake, this new release is also an opportunity to refamiliarize oneself with the history of this cult horror franchise, and in particular with the history of its settings taken almost straight out from reality. Because while the environment of Silent Hill is crafted to evoke only the very worst of your nightmares, it is, as it happens, a very real place, with a particularly regrettable history.\n\nCentralia, the Pennsylvania town that has been burning for 60 years"
