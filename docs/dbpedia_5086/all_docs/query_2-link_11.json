For aesthetic to me SH is about feeling an overwhelming atmosphere of isolation, desolation, and a general feeling of purgatorial futility. Fog helps but it doesn't need to be about just that ;)\n\nA sense of unreality and dream logic goes a long ways towards making this work too. Indies have been mining these kinda vibes for awhile so here's a few standouts that I think fit the bill:\n\nOrgan Quarter:\n\nView: https://youtu.be/qY0G1YVvC8A\n\nConcluse:\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0eQiMUZBIE\n\nThis is an upcoming game but seems to completely nail the third person SH style presentation down to inventory management and general environment interaction details:\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-v8Ro08dks\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E61eAeYgp6w\n\nShare your own examples!\n\nRE7 & 8's atmosphere is incredible when you're in a small room for example. Hearing the wind, creaks of the floorboards and sounds in through the walls creeped me out\n\nThe guest house in RE7 alone has such amazing sound design progression. The subtle transition to nightime as you get further in with the rain pattering against the window panes and pitch black outside before the Mia batshit Evil Dead tier encounters is sublime.\n\nThe examples can be both aesthetic based and/or the psychological themes. For aesthetic to me SH is about feeling an overwhelming atmosphere of isolation, desolation, and a general feeling of purgatorial futility. Fog helps but it doesn't need to be about just that ;)\n\nThats not really what silent hill means for me personally but going by your description, definitely Pathologic\n\nSignalis really felt like it came the closest to nailing that sort of SH vibe. It's hard to explain, but it knows when to simply just be creepy and unnerving and when to go all out.\n\nVisage is probably one of the most genuinely scary games I've played in years. It's more PT than traditional SH but the DNA is there for sure.\n\nHere's another forthcoming one I almost forgot about, there's a demo for this one you can get here:\n\nPost Trauma Demo by robertoserrag\n\nPost trauma is a horror game inspired by the old classics with fixed camera angles and today's graphics.\n\nPost Trauma on Steam\n\nPost Trauma is a horror game inspired by genre-defining classics of the past decades. Play as Roman, a middle-aged train conductor trapped in a terrifying twisted reality. Explore the unknown, unravel mysteries, and try to survive the unspeakable horrors that lurk in these threatening surroundings.\n\nFixed camera angles, SH3 vibes (subway environment), and classic item collecting/puzzle design. Really looking forward to this one based on the demo, and the solo dev making it got a publishing deal with Raw Fury as of December to finish it.\n\nSanitarium\n\nView: https://store.steampowered.com/app/284050/Sanitarium/\n\nThis actually predates Silent Hill, but they draw upon the same influences and end up sharing A LOT in common. I highly recommend watching a video of the first levels or a review or even just playing it if you are a fan of adventure games. There is some highly disturbing stuff, but that might be needless to say in this topic.\n\nWhile i do enjoy Sanitarium and understand the comparison, it really starts veering into way different things\n\nafter you leave the village with the kids. the superhero and aztec god parts are totally not SH at all\n\nWhile i do enjoy Sanitarium and understand the comparison, it really starts veering into way different things\n\nafter you leave the village with the kids. the superhero and aztec god parts are totally not SH at all\n\nAfter the village the similarities get more general but I think they're pretty strong in the ways they use symbolism and uncovering a mystery that ties into the character's past. Obviously Sanitarium wasn't trying to capture \"Silent Hill vibes\" but they both were trying to capture David Lynch and Jacob's Ladder vibes.\n\nwhen it comes to short indie horror games that have the uncanny vibe and psychological horror while not being a jump-scare-fest\n\ni recommend MOTHERED\n\nView: https://youtu.be/BunjS8WR4wc\n\nMOTHERED is sooo good. Shoutout to sn00zer for cluing me into some of the game's secrets. On the PC version there's things you do in the 'demo' that affect the full version save file, but I assume the dev integrated both into the console release. One of those true ending type deals where when you discover it for the first time its a legit holy shit moment. Great game that more people need to experience.\n\nThat same dev has two other games set in the same universe, The Enigma Machine and the forthcoming [ECHOSTASIS], the latter has a demo on Steam:\n\nTHE ENIGMA MACHINE on Steam\n\nENIGMA TECHNOLOGIES invites you to delve into the mind of an AI. Seamlessly blending first-person exploration with point-and-click mechanics, THE ENIGMA MACHINE's completely unique presentation offers an increasingly unnerving atmosphere.\n\n[ECHOSTASIS] on Steam\n\nTHE AWARD-WINNING CONCLUSION TO THE [ENIGMA] TRILOGY, [ECHOSTASIS] presents a world where our reality is not only curated by algorithms, but created by them."
