        "text": "In 1999, Konami released a survival horror video game that not only spawned a subsequent franchise but also generated one of the most creepy and haunting aesthetics in the history of the visual arts. Three further games arrived before an inevitable film adaptation was released in 2006, perhaps with the hopes of replicating the Capcom horror series Resident Evil.\n\nChristophe Cans and Roger Avary’s Silent Hill, starring Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean and Laurie Holden, was certainly not the best-received horror film from a critical perspective upon its initial release, though later considerations have painted it in a better light. Still, the film aimed to capture the eerie atmosphere of the original games and also took inspiration from a real-life place.\n\nIn the strange town of Centralia, Pennsylvania, there are a number of parallels that have a distinct influence on the first Silent Hill movie. A thick fog often hangs over the streets of Centralia, perhaps obscuring horrors from the views of its residents, and a tale of genuine tragedy also lurks in its history.\n\nCentralia was one a wealthy mining town due to its underground coal reserves, but in 1962, a fire suddenly ignited in the labyrinth tunnels underneath the town. Desperate efforts were made to extinguish the fire, but eventually, the fire won and began to spread unrelentingly across Centralia.\n\nThe result was a release of toxic and deadly gases and a newfound unstableness of the ground on which the residents of Centralia walked. In 1981, after nearly two decades of fighting the fire, the federal government decided to relocate the townsfolk and condemn Centralia as inhabitable. Only five residents remain, and the fire continues to burn underground.\n\nBoth aesthetically and symbolically, Centralia is an utter ghost town haunted by the reminder of the disaster. Overgrown and cracked streets are covered by a plume of fog and stream, and it’s easy to see where Konami got their inspiration for Silent Hill, which itself mimics the eerie horrors of the once-thriving Pennsylvania town.\n\nNarratively, as the protagonists of Silent Hill become wrapped up in stories of guilt, redemption, torment and sorrow, making their way through the horrors of the titular town, they find a kinship with the former residents of Centralia, who had themselves been forced to come to terms with their tragic history.\n\nSo Centralia’s history not only provided a warning about the dangers of environmental disasters but also gave deep inspiration to one of the most influential horror franchises of all time. Silent Hill continues to inspire various artistic enterprises, from films to video games to fashion and beyond, and its nightmarish world is even more eerie as it holds resonance in a real-world place."
