        "text": "When thinking about the nightmarish world of Silent Hill 2, Madonna's 1998 album, Ray of Light, seems the least likely comparison. However, if not for the sixth song on the album, \"Nothing Really Matters,\" Silent Hill 2 wouldn't be the creepy game that fans love to this day.\n\nMasahiro Ito, monster designer and art director for Silent Hill 2, said that the eerie music video for Madonna's \"Nothing Really Matters\" influenced the haunting atmosphere of the game. The dingy psychiatric hospital in the music video looks very similar to the one in Silent Hill 2, and the unsettling movements of the patients are reminiscent of how the monsters behave in the game.\n\nPop music lovers of the 1990s will instantly recognize who Maria is wearing in Silent Hill 2. From the pink, long-sleeved shirt to the leopard skirt, it appears Christina Aguilera's appearance in the 1999 Teen Choice Awards was used as the visual inspiration for Maria's design.\n\nAnd fashion isn't the only thing Maria has in common with the American singer. Christina Aguilera's middle name is also Maria!\n\nFor a series that loves including secret endings of the main character being taken by aliens, it's not too surprising to see Silent Hill hide a few sci-fi references here and there. One poster found in the game has the words \"The Martians have arrived,\" but another says \"A Woman Came Down from Planet Vulcan.\"\n\nStar Trek aficionados will instantly get the reference, as Vulcan is the home planet of science officer Spock.\n\nContinuing the trend of American pop culture references, the original Silent Hill features mock posters of two Hollywood blockbusters: Die Hard and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, neither movie goes by its authentic name.\n\nInstead, the Die Hard movie goes by Crusher Dan and Raiders is simply titled Shoot.\n\nReferences to L. Frank Baumâ€™s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz appear in both the original Silent Hill and Silent Hill 3. Just like Dorothy Gale, Harry Mason is transported to another world filled with unbelievable creatures. And just like the famous novel and 1939 movie, Harry needs the assistance of a scarecrow, tin man, and lion to progress.\n\nIn this case, the lion, tin man, and scarecrow are depicted as keys that grant access to the western side of Silent Hill."
