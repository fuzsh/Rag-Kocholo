        "text": "‘Musical biography’, write Christopher Wiley and Paul Watt, ‘has historically held something of a problematized or, to borrow Philip Olleson's words, an “untidy” place within music history.’Footnote 1 Aimed for the most part towards a public rather than specialist readership, it is a genre that has ‘long stood outside the musicological arena’. That Wiley and Watt acknowledged this complication in 2019 – thirty-seven years after Maynard Solomon's probing reflection on the musicologically critical position that he felt biography should occupy – is an indication that the biographical genre remains in some ways the black sheep of the music history family.Footnote 2\n\nEmerging as it did in 1982, Solomon's article came at a time of radical change in musicology that saw a seismic shift in emphasis towards musical context – essentially, towards what are often dubbed ‘extra-musical’ factors – and away from positivism.Footnote 3 Targeting the ‘analogy of artistic to divine creation’ and the notion that ‘the artist is a more or less passive medium through whom speaks some incarnation of an ideal’, Solomon's argument was not so much that prior biographical knowledge of musicians is essential to understand their music, but rather that we ‘approach every work of art with a more or less extensive set of preliminary assumptions’:\n\nInstead of seeing this as in some way threatening to or distracting from the musical ‘ideal’, Solomon's point was that this kind of knowledge should be explicitly considered valuable to our aesthetic and scholarly discourses.\n\nThe fingerprints of the ‘new’ musicology are evident in Solomon's work, and a certain amount of historical distance has since put the issues at stake into much clearer relief. Jolanta T. Pekacz's diagnosis is that the ‘assumption of the autonomy and self-referentiality of music implied that musical works must be approached and understood through the analysis of their inner structures, exclusive of extra musical factors’, and that this ‘effectively relegated the genre of biography to the margins of the discipline of musicology’.Footnote 5 One task for more recent musical biographers has centred on revisiting the very foundations of the biographical traditions that we have inherited, which – as Wiley points out – owe much to the ‘hagiographical climate of the later nineteenth-century’.Footnote 6 A larger issue which has re-emerged, however, one with all kinds of musicological implications, is ‘the difficulty of incorporating such biographical knowledge into music analysis and criticism’.Footnote 7 Indeed, Solomon has suggested that ‘the primary area of dispute about the value of biography appears to centre on the vexed question of how – or whether – the pathways between life and art can be mapped, whether a “personal” factor in creativity can be identified’.Footnote 8 How, in other words, are we to interrelate a musician's life and work convincingly?\n\nThis article attempts not so much to answer this question as to bring it to bear on the treatment of the classical performer as a historical subject in musicology. Transferring these historiographical perspectives to the literature on twentieth-century classical performers reveals a musicological domain that compartmentalizes the lives and work of performers quite considerably. Before the emergence of performance studies as a field of musical inquiry in its own right, the detailed study of individual performers was for the most part restricted to the genre of popular biography, one which is rich in contextualization but light on rigorous engagement with the performer's ability as it is captured, for instance, in recordings. With the rise of performance studies, the use of empirical methods to quantify and discuss what is termed performer ‘style’ has become prevalent, but often without any attempt to embed that style within the context of said performer's life or cultural surroundings. In short, the literature on performers exhibits the kind of sharp divide between life and work that has persistently been questioned by the likes of Solomon, Pekacz, and Wiley. What all this amounts to is a historiographical problem in the writings of histories and biographies of performers, one which is particular to the twentieth century at least in part due to the varying treatment of the special heritage of recordings that we have which documents what and how performers played. In what follows, I demonstrate the entrenchment of this divide. First, I examine the relatively neglected strand of music biography that focuses on performers before assessing the values and alternatives offered by empirical approaches to recordings. I conclude by asking how the opposing positions taken in these bodies of literature might usefully be brought together, drawing on perspectives from artistic research and popular music studies in doing so."
