        "text": "TIME was, when divas were as innumerable as dinosaurs. They devoured one another for real, without animatronics. Today there is only one true diva, and she does not stalk opera houses. Aretha Franklin has created what can only be called gospel bel canto.\n\nProof that Ms. Franklin is of the blood came on the ''Divas Live'' telecast last month on VH1. She proceeded to eat six other female pop stars, including Mariah Carey, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain and Celine Dion as though they were Cream of Wheat. Only Birgit Nilsson, 30 years ago, would have done it with such relish. Ms. Nilsson didn't need a microphone. Surely, Ms. Franklin was using hers merely to be polite.\n\nLike any true diva, Ms. Franklin is huge. She wore pants, white pants. Not even Montserrat Caballe in her prime would have dared. At the end of the evening, Ms. Franklin, who has always acknowledged her gospel roots and the influence of the great Clara Ward, announced, ''Now we're going to have church.'' She proceeded to deafen the other ''divas'' by trumpeting ''Testimony.'' The show's producers panicked and cut to credits.\n\nMs. Franklin was in her soar-till-you-crash mode. She wrested control of the proceedings and sang on and on, something Luisa Tetrazzini used to do. The other women backed off, except for Celine Dion, who, with a bravado that can only be described as Canadian, fought Ms. Franklin. She lost.\n\n''Diva,'' the word, has been appropriated by lots of people, including the crossover cross-dresser Ru Paul. Ms. Franklin returned the term to its true meaning on the Grammy telecast in February. She sang Puccini's, ''Nessun dorma,'' from the opera ''Turandot.'' The words say, ''Nobody had better sleep.'' Nobody did.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti, who was to have sung this, his signature piece, fled at the last minute. Ms. Franklin had to sing in the tenor's key, with his conductor. None of which fazed her one bit. Had Maria Callas possessed that kind of grit, she wouldn't have unraveled at 40. Ms. Franklin's flirtation with opera enraged many cognoscenti, particularly since many knew that Renee Fleming, a Grammy nominee in the classical vocal category, was in the audience and had offered to serve as understudy for Mr. Pavarotti. But a few years ago, when she was to make her debut in Bayreuth, Germany, Ms. Fleming voiced one regret. ''I know Aretha Franklin is coming to New York, and I won't be here,'' she said. ''I'd die to hear Aretha live.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
