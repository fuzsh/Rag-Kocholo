        "text": "Mascagni is again busy on his opera, “Vistilia,” which he began when eighteen years of age. The plot is drawn from a novel of Rocco De Zerbi which has been done into a libretto by Targioni-Torzetti, also the li­brettist of “Cavalleria Rusticana.” It is built about a passionate love story of the old imperial Roman life.

At a recent concert she played her own Pianoforte Concerto in D Minor, of which the critics say, “It is an exceptional work in the fact that it is one of the few real concertos, that is, works in which the solo instrument joins with the orchestra and does not merely alternate, since the days before the virtuoso got the upper hand in the concert room.”\n\nA $200,000 Temple of Music and Art is being provided for Tucson, Arizona, by popular subscription aided largely by two prominent business men of the community.

P., of Maidenhead. Now in his eighty-third year, he has been in the choir more than forty years.

The Navy musical organizations “cannot be used except in playing for the general public, where no admission is charged and where there is no incidental motive for the gathering, such as entertainments, club luncheons or private parties, where the bands are really substi­tutes for paid bands, thus interfering with civilian musicians gaining a livelihood.”\n\nPaul Paray has been unanimously elected by the Society of Lamoureaux Con­certs of Paris, to succeed the late Camille Chevillard as their conductor.\n\nChildren’s Concerts by several leading orchestras of Europe are the result of their conductors’ visits to America.
