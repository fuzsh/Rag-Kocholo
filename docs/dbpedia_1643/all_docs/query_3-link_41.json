        "text": "WE HAVE BEFORE US, ladies and gentlemen, a new recording of Schubert's much-recorded \"Winterreise,\" two dozen songs, two dozen solitary way stations of despair (Angel CDC 49846; CD only). It begins on a winter's night when a down-at-heel young wayfarer passes for the last time by the house of the burgher's daughter who has jilted him. It ends when he meets a barefoot old organ grinder, cranking out broken tunes on the ice, noticed only by growling curs.\n\nIn between, the disappointed lover scours snow-swept meadows for his beloved's footprints, trails will-o'-the-wisps into rocky ravines, staggers exhausted past a deserted graveyard, and weeps to see one last leaf, like the last of his hopes, fall from a bare tree to the ground. The wayfarer on this occasion is Miss Brigitte Fassbaender, and to get straight to the point, this is no material for a woman.\n\nCan we discuss this like civilized people?\n\nAt the ballet, men in the prime of life dance old hags. At the opera, dowagers cavort as knights in armor. At the playhouse, a strapping black actor can portray a deformed king of England. On Broadway, with $25 million at stake, a Welshman may even play a Eurasian. Wars break out over whether such things should be allowed, encouraged, forbidden or required, but under the paper moon of theatrical illusion, they come to pass.\n\nOutside the theater, no such moon shines. A singer alone in the spotlight has no alternate self -- no character, no role -- to hide behind, so certain lines are harder to cross. Oh, sure, a chanteuse in a cabaret can purr \"Lili Marlene\" to the soldiers. But in the usual course of things, men don't sing \"Bill\" or \"Mary\" or \"My Man,\" and women pass up \"Maria\" and \"Man of La Mancha\" and \"Just Like a Woman.\" No one needs to tell you why. Anyone who likes can do \"Amazing Grace,\" \"You're the Top\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" But except for purposes of travesty, where the lyrics call for a man rather than a woman or the other way around, what the lyrics say goes. The sexes are equal but separate, and vive la difference .\n\nIn classical song, the picture is different, in mostly unexamined ways that turn out to be revealing. Anyone who listens to lieder recitals soon finds out that, lo and behold, women are forever singing songs that presuppose a male speaker, whereas the opposite case is practically unheard of. Yet practically the entire repertory of art songs, from Monteverdi to Berio, consists of lyrics by men set to music by men. Here as elsewhere in our culture, men presume to put words in the mouths of women, and women validate the presumption by lending men's creation their voices.\n\n\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi!\" declared Flaubert, misleading readers and critics for generations. In truth, a novelist or a playwright is never one character or another character but a presence dispersed through the work at hand. The poet's \"I,\" where one exists, is different. To come into being, it requires an act of unconditional identification.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
