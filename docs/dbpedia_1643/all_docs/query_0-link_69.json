        "text": "Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that comprise around 40% of mammalian genomes (Beck et al., 2011; Hancks and Kazazian, 2016; Richardson et al., 2014a). Retrotransposons are a source of genetic variation that shape genome evolution and mammalian development, but their mobilization can also cause mutations associated with a variety of genetic diseases and cancers (Beck et al., 2011; Hancks and Kazazian, 2016; Richardson et al., 2014a; Garcia-Perez et al., 2016). New retrotransposition events are estimated to occur in around 1 in every 20 human births, and represent around 1% of genetic disease-causing mutations in humans (Kazazian, 1999; Hancks and Kazazian, 2016). Retrotransposons can be classified into two major types depending on their genomic structure and presence of LTR (long terminal repeat) sequences: LINEs (long interspersed elements) and SINEs (short interspersed elements) lack LTR sequences and end in a polyA sequence, while LTR retrotransposons are similar in structure to retroviruses (Beck et al., 2011). In humans, all new retrotransposition events are catalysed by LINE-1 (L1) elements. Active L1s encode two proteins strictly required for retrotransposition (Moran et al., 1996): ORF1p is an RNA binding protein with nucleic acid chaperone activity (Martin and Bushman, 2001; Hohjoh and Singer, 1997), and ORF2p is a multidomain protein with reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities (Feng et al., 1996; Mathias et al., 1991). Both these proteins interact directly or indirectly with various cellular factors and are incorporated into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) along with the L1 RNA (Beck et al., 2011; Goodier et al., 2013; Hancks and Kazazian, 2016; Richardson et al., 2014a; Taylor et al., 2013). While these proteins exhibit a strong cis-preference to bind to and catalyse mobilization of their encoding mRNA, they can act in trans on other RNAs, including those encoded by SINEs (Kulpa and Moran, 2006; Wei et al., 2001; Dewannieux et al., 2003; Esnault et al., 2000). Some human L1s also encode a trans-acting protein, ORF0, that stimulates retrotransposition, although its mechanism of action is currently poorly understood (Denli et al., 2015). Host restriction mechanisms that regulate the activity of these L1-encoded proteins will impact on the stability of mammalian genomes and the incidence of genetic disease.\n\nRegulating retrotransposon activity is particularly important in the germline as de novo retrotransposon integrations that arise in these cells can be transmitted to the next generation (Crichton et al., 2014). The mammalian germline encompasses lineage-restricted germ cells including primordial germ cells, oocytes, and sperm, and their pluripotent precursors in early embryos (Ollinger et al., 2010). L1 mobilization may be more prevalent in pluripotent cells in pre-implantation embryos rather than in lineage-restricted germ cells (Kano et al., 2009; Richardson et al., 2017), and regulation of L1 activity in the pluripotent phase of the germline cycle is therefore likely to have a significant effect on trans-generational genome stability. Repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation typically suppress transcription of retrotransposons in somatic mammalian cells (Beck et al., 2011; Hancks and Kazazian, 2016; Richardson et al., 2014a; Crichton et al., 2014), but many of these transcriptionally repressive marks are globally removed during pre-implantation development and during fetal germ cell development in mice (Hajkova et al., 2008; Popp et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2002; Fadloun et al., 2013). DNA methylation in particular plays a key role in transcriptionally repressing L1 in the germline (Bourc'his and Bestor, 2004), and it is not clear how L1 activity is controlled in pluripotent cells and fetal germ cells while they are DNA hypomethylated. However, evidence suggests that L1 mobilization is tightly controlled in pluripotent cells to reduce trans-generational genome instability (Wissing et al., 2012; Marchetto et al., 2013).\n\nIn fetal germ cells, loss of DNA methylation correlates with relaxed transcriptional suppression of retrotransposons (Molaro et al., 2014), but also induces expression of methylation-sensitive germline genome-defence genes that have roles in post-transcriptionally repressing these elements (Hackett et al., 2012). The methylation-sensitive germline genome-defence genes include components of the PIWI-piRNA pathway. This pathway promotes de novo DNA methylation of retrotransposons in male germ cells, cleaves retrotransposon RNAs, and may also interfere with retrotransposon translation (Fu and Wang, 2014; Xu et al., 2008). However, while mice carrying mutations in the PIWI-piRNA pathway can strongly de-repress L1-encoded RNA and protein during spermatogenesis (Aravin et al., 2007; Carmell et al., 2007), increased L1 mobilization has not yet been reported in these mutant models. Indeed, the level of L1 expression at different stages of the germline cycle does not completely correlate with the ability of L1 to mobilize, and post-translational control mechanisms have been proposed to restrict the ability of L1 to mobilize in the mouse germline (Kano et al., 2009). However, the molecular identities of these post-translational L1 restriction mechanisms have not yet been elucidated.\n\nWe have previously shown that programmed DNA hypomethylation in the developing mouse germline induces expression of a group of genes that are involved in suppressing retrotransposon activity (Hackett et al., 2012). One of the retrotransposon defence genes induced in response to programmed DNA hypomethylation, Tex19.1, suppresses specific retrotransposon transcripts in spermatocytes (Ollinger et al., 2008; Reichmann et al., 2012), however its direct mechanism of action remains unclear. Tex19.1 is expressed in germ cells, pluripotent cells and the placenta and is one of two TEX19 orthologs generated by a rodent-specific gene duplication (Kuntz et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2001; Ollinger et al., 2008). These mammal-specific proteins have no functionally characterized protein motifs or reported biochemical activity, but mouse TEX19.1 is predominantly cytoplasmic in the germline (Ollinger et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2010). Here we show that Tex19.1 regulates L1-ORF1p levels and mobilization of engineered L1 elements. We show that mouse TEX19.1, and its human ortholog TEX19, physically interact with L1-ORF1p, and regulate L1-ORF1p abundance through stimulating its polyubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation. We show that TEX19.1 likely controls L1-ORF1p abundance in concert with UBR2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that we show also physically interacts with and regulates L1-ORF1p levels in vivo. We also show that loss of Tex19.1 results in increased L1-ORF1p abundance and increased mobilization of engineered L1 constructs in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting that Tex19.1 functions as a post-translational control mechanism to restrict L1 mobilization in the developing germline.\n\nThis study identifies Tex19.1 as a host restriction factor for L1 mobilization in the mammalian germline. We have previously reported that Tex19.1 plays a role in regulating the abundance of retrotransposon RNAs (Ollinger et al., 2008; Reichmann et al., 2012, 2013), which appears to reflect transcriptional de-repression of specific retrotransposons (Crichton et al., 2017a). Although loss of Tex19.1 results in de-repression of L1 RNA in placenta (Reichmann et al., 2013), L1 RNA abundance is not affected by loss of Tex19.1 in male germ cells (Ollinger et al., 2008) or, in contrast to a previous report (Tarabay et al., 2013), in mouse ESCs (Figure 7). Indeed here we show that Tex19.1 has a role in the post-translational regulation of L1-ORF1p steady-state levels in these cells. Thus, Tex19.1 appears to regulate retrotransposons at multiple stages of their life cycle. It is possible that Tex19.1 is affecting different E3 ubiquitin ligases, or different E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates, in order to repress different stages of the retrotransposon life cycle. However, loss of Tex19.1 results in a 1.5-fold increase in the rate of mobilization of L1 constructs in pluripotent cells. Since L1 mobilization mostly takes place in the pluripotent phase of the germline cycle, and new L1-dependent mobilization events are thought to be inherited by one in every twenty human births (Kazazian, 1999), TEX19 activity could be having a significant impact on L1-derived mutations during evolution. Retrotransposons appear to provide functions that are advantageous for mammalian development and evolution (Garcia-Perez et al., 2016), and the activity of restriction mechanisms like the TEX19-dependent mechanism we have described here, that control the ability of retrotransposons to mobilize, rather than eliminate their transcriptional activity altogether, could potentially allow retrotransposons to participate in and drive the evolution of key gene regulatory networks in pluripotent cells while minimising their mutational load on the germline genome.\n\nOur data suggests that L1-ORF1p is post-translationally modified by ubiquitylation in somatic and germline cells. Phosphorylation of L1-ORF1p has been previously reported in somatic tissues and is required for L1 retrotransposition in these cells (Cook et al., 2015). However, we are not aware of any previous reports that post-translational modifications of L1-ORF1p are present in the germline, particularly in the pluripotent phase of the germline cycle when L1 retrotransposition is thought to primarily occur (Kano et al., 2009). There are 32 lysine residues in human L1-ORF1p that could act as potential ubiquitylation sites (deHaro et al., 2014), and 42, 47 and 39 lysines in mouse Tf, Gf and A subtypes of L1-ORF1p respectively that could act as potential ubiquitylation sites. It will be of interest to determine which of these lysines are ubiquitylated in somatic and germline tissues, and how variant these residues are between retrotransposition-competent L1s. Post-translational regulation of L1 potentially provides an additional layer of genome defence that could be particularly important during periods of epigenetic reprogramming in early embryogenesis or in the developing primordial germ cells when transcriptional repression of retrotransposons might be more relaxed (Molaro et al., 2014; Fadloun et al., 2013). Indeed, the sensitivity of Tex19.1 expression to DNA hypomethylation (Hackett et al., 2012) will allow post-translational suppression of L1 to be enhanced during these stages of development. Post-translational regulation of L1s is also likely important to limit the activity of L1 variants that evolve to escape transcriptional repression by the host and will provide a layer of genome defence while the host adapts its KRAB zinc-finger protein repertoire to these new variants (Jacobs et al., 2014). Analysis of L1 evolution shows that regions within L1-ORF1p are under strong positive selection suggesting that host restriction systems are targeting L1-ORF1p post-translationally and impacting on evolution of these elements (Boissinot and Furano, 2001; Sookdeo et al., 2013). Although this evidence for post-translational restriction factors acting on L1-ORF1p has been known for over 15 years, to our knowledge no host factors have been identified that directly bind to L1-ORF1p and restrict L1 mobilization in germline cells. It is possible that the physical interactions between L1-ORF1p and TEX19:UBR2 that we describe here are contributing to these selection pressures acting on L1-ORF1p. While UBR2 is able to target L1-ORF1p in the absence of TEX19, evolution of a less constrained TEX19 adapter to provide a further link between UBR2 and L1-ORF1p could potentially resolve the contradictory pressures on UBR2 to maintain interactions with some endogenous cellular substrates while targeting a rapidly evolving retrotransposon protein for degradation.\n\nOur data strongly suggest that TEX19.1 likely exists in a complex with UBR2 in ESCs, and that TEX19.1 stimulates a basal activity of UBR2 to promote polyubiquitylation of L1-ORF1p (Figure 8). Ubr1, a yeast ortholog of UBR2, has different binding sites for different types of substrate (Xia et al., 2008). Ubr1 participates in the N-end rule pathway that degrades proteins depending on their N-terminal amino acids, and can bind to and ubiquitylate proteins containing specific residues at their N-termini (N-end rule degrons). Ubr1 also binds to and catalyses ubiquitylation of proteins that have more poorly defined non-N-terminal internal degrons (Xia et al., 2008; Sriram et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2014). Full-length human L1-ORF1p does not have a potential N-end rule degron at its N-terminus (Kim et al., 2014; Sriram et al., 2011), and we speculate the interaction between UBR2 and L1-ORF1p likely reflects an internal degron in the retrotransposon protein. One of the known internal degron substrates of yeast Ubr1 is CUP9, a transcription factor that regulates expression of a peptide transporter (Turner et al., 2000). Binding and polyubiquitylation of CUP9 by Ubr1 is allosterically activated by specific dipeptides binding to the N-end rule degron binding sites in Ubr1 (Du et al., 2002; Xia et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2000). The effect of these dipeptides on Ubr1 activity in yeast strongly resonates with the effects of TEX19 orthologs on UBR2 activity in mammals: TEX19 orthologs binds to UBR2 and inhibits its activity towards N-end rule substrates (Reichmann et al., 2017), but stimulate polyubiquitylation of L1-ORF1p. The direct interaction between TEX19 orthologs and L1-ORF1p could further enhance L1-ORF1p binding to UBR2 by stabilizing the highly flexible L1-ORF1p trimers (Khazina et al., 2011) in a conformational state that exposes an internal degron and favors their ubiquitylation. Thus, TEX19 orthologs appear to function, at least in part, by re-targeting UBR2 away from N-end rule substrates and towards a retrotransposon substrate. However, the direct interaction between TEX19 orthologs and L1-ORF1p means that it is possible that TEX19 orthologs are interfering with L1-ORF1p function in multiple ways in order to restrict L1 mobilization. Thus, while one outcome of this interaction appears to be increased polyubiquitylation and degradation of L1-ORF1p, the interaction between TEX19 orthologs and L1-ORF1p could also interfere with the nucleic acid chaperone activity of L1-ORF1p (Martin et al., 2005), or its interactions with either L1-encoded or host-encoded molecules (Taylor et al., 2013; Goodier et al., 2013).\n\nThe constellation of L1 sequences in the genome (Chinwalla et al. 2002) makes it difficult to quantitatively determine how much each L1 locus contributes to the cellular pool of L1 RNAs, and how much each L1 RNA contributes to the amount of L1-encoded proteins in the cell. We have been unable to detect effects on bulk transcription of L1 in the absence of Tex19.1, and Tex19.1 could be potentially regulating endogenous L1-ORF1p abundance in testes and ES cells entirely post-transcriptionally. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that transcriptional or translational de-repression of specific variant copies of L1 are contributing to the increase in the abundance of L1-ORF1p species detected in Tex19.1−/− ES cells and testes. Our data using tagged copies of L1-ORF1p have allowed us to link transcription and protein abundance from a single defined L1 sequence suggesting that Tex19.1 can act, at least in part, at post-transcriptional level to regulate endogenous L1-ORF1p abundance in the germline.\n\nOur data are consistent with TEX19.1 playing a role in promoting polyubiquitylation of mL1-ORF1p in mouse ESCs, thereby reducing the steady-state abundance of mL1-ORF1p in these cells (Figure 7). Quantifying the amount of the transient heterogeneous mixture of polyubiquitylated mL1-ORF1p endogenously expressed in control and Tex19.1−/− mESCs cells is technically challenging. This is partly due to the activity of deubiquitylases present in the ES cell lysates, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of endogenously expressed mL1-ORF1p, which may be recognised with multiple different affinities by anti-mL1-ORF1p antibodies, particularly when present in different ubiquitylated states, and partly because this experiment would likely require ESCs to be treated with proteasome inhibitor to allow polyubiquitylated species to accumulate. This treatment can stabilize E3 ubiquitin ligases like UBR2 itself (An et al., 2012), or other proteins that can regulate L1-ORF1p abundance independently of TEX19.1. Cell-based ubiquitylation assays (Figure 4) circumvent these challenges by assessing the effect of TEX19 on a single epitope-tagged copy of L1-ORF1p in the absence of intervention with proteasome inhibitors and under denaturing conditions that inactivate deubiquitylases in the lysate. Taken together, the protein interactions, gain-of-function cell-based ubiquitylation data, and loss-of-function phenotyping in ESCs and in mouse testes indicate that TEX19.1 plays a role in regulating the polyubiquitylation and stability of mL1-ORF1p.\n\nThe data presented here suggests that programmed DNA hypomethylation in the mouse germline extends beyond activating components of the PIWI-piRNA pathway (Hackett et al., 2012) to include enhancing the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system towards retrotransposon substrates. Recent data has suggested that TEX19.1 physically interacts with components of the PIWI-piRNA pathway (Tarabay et al., 2017), although it is not clear whether these proposed interactions have functional consequences for retrotransposon suppression in vivo. Activation of post-translational genome-defence mechanisms may allow mammalian germ cells to safely transcribe retrotransposons by preventing these transcripts from generating RNPs that can mutate the germline genome (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). The retrotransposon transcripts can then potentially be processed into piRNAs and used to identify retrotransposon loci where epigenetic silencing needs to be established. De novo establishment of epigenetic silencing at retrotransposons in the Arabidopsis germline involves transfer of small RNAs between a hypomethylated vegetative cell and a germ cell (Slotkin et al., 2009), whereas these processes happen sequentially in the same germ cell in mammals (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Therefore the ability to enhance post-translational control of retrotransposons may be a key feature of epigenetic reprogramming in the mammalian germline that limits the trans-generational genomic instability caused by retrotransposon mobilization."
