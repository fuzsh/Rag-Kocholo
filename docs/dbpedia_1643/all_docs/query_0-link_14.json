        "text": "Today marks the 153rd birthday of Australia’s most famous opera singer, Dame Nellie Melba (19 May 1861 – 23 February 1931). Melba was born Helen Porter Mitchell in Richmond, Melbourne, later changing her name in honour her native city. After studying singing in her home town she travelled to Paris in 1886. Her talent was recognised by the influential Mathilde Marchesi who became her teacher and ardent supporter.\n\nMelba made her operatic debut in 1887 at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels. This was to be the beginning of an auspicious international career.\n\nMelba performed in the great opera houses of the world – the Paris Opera, La Scala in Milan, the Metropolitan Opera House and Manhattan Opera House in New York, and most notably the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London. She became Covent Garden’s prima donna, returning season after season. Throughout her career, Melba worked with prominent musicians and composers including, Enrico Caruso, Giacomo Puccini and Giuseppe Verdi.\n\nMelba remained a loyal Australian and Melbourne was always her home. She returned to her beloved country for several triumphant concert tours and eventually collaborated with J.C. Williamson Theatres to form the Melba-Williamson Opera Company, bringing great opera to the people of Australia.\n\nDuring World War I, Melba began teaching at Melbourne’s Albert Street Conservatorium (later the Melba Memorial Conservatorium), encouraging and promoting local talent. She also performed in many charity concerts to raise funds for the war effort. For this patriotic work, Melba was awarded a D.B.E. in 1918.\n\nArts Centre Melbourne’s Performing Arts Collection holds a significant collection of performance costumes and accessories worn by the singer, which were donated by her grand-daughter Lady Pamela Vestey in 1977. Melba’s most famous operas are represented, including Otello, Rigoletto, La Traviata, Faust, La Boheme, Romeo and Juliet and I Pagliacci. The most elaborate item is a gold cloak, hand-painted and sewn with jewels, which was worn by Melba in Lohengrin and designed for her by the Paris-based couturier, Jean-Phillipe Worth.\n\nSince the time of this generous donation, many additions have been made to the Performing Arts Collection. Original photographs, many of which are signed by Dame Nellie, illustrate her life and career. Programmes, some printed on silk, trace her Australian and international opera performances and concerts. Letters and cards written by Melba to friends and pupils provide an insight into the personality of this great performer. Opera scores (including Madame Butterfly signed by Puccini), books, monogrammed items, and records are also part of this important collection.\n\nThis week Arts Centre Melbourne and Opera Australia announced a new acquisition agreement that will see the Opera Australia Archive become part of the Performing Arts Collection.\n\nArts Centre Melbourne and Opera Australia’s agreement will ensure the preservation of Opera Australia’s substantial archive of production, performance and company material – including costumes from the Dame Joan Sutherland Archive – through a new ongoing donation agreement with Arts Centre Melbourne’s Performing Arts Collection. The new agreement will ensure that the history, repertoire and stage magic of Australia’s pre-eminent opera company will be preserved in perpetuity.\n\nTo celebrate the new agreement, five significant items from the initial acquisition – including two Joan Sutherland costumes – have been selected to be displayed in the Smorgon Family Plaza until 28 July.\n\nChosen to indicate the extraordinary depth and personality of Opera Australia’s repertoire, the display includes:\n\nThe iconic L’amour sign created by Academy Award-winning designer Catherine Martin for Baz Luhrmann’s staging of La Boheme (1990)\n\nElettra costume, worn by Dame Joan Sutherland for the 1979 staging of Idomeneo, designed by Oscar winner John Truscott\n\nAnna Glawari costume, worn by Dame Joan Sutherland for the 1978 production of The Merry Widow, designed by Kristian Fredrikson\n\nCountess Almaviva costume created by worn by Joan Carden for the 2001 staging of The Marriage of Figaro created by British designer Michael Stennett\n\nTwo props designed by Dan Potra for the 2001 Opera Australia commissioned production of Batavia\n\nAn additional costume from the 1995 production of Nabucco, currently on loan to RMIT Gallery, will join the collection in June.\n\nAt the launch of this new display on Monday, Victorian Minister for the Arts Heidi Victoria MP said, “This new partnership adds another dimension to Arts Centre Melbourne’s impressive Performing Arts Collection, Australia’s largest and most significant collection of performing arts history and a treasure of our state. It will bring with it memories of many years of great performances and productions for all to enjoy. Opera Australia couldn’t have chosen a better place to house part of its history, and I thank them for sharing and entrusting these treasures with the people of Victoria and Australia.”\n\nArts Centre Melbourne Chief Executive Judith Isherwood said, “Our new acquisition partnership with Opera Australia is an important milestone and really cements the national significance of our Performing Arts Collection as Australia’s largest collection of performing arts history and traditions. While we already have 200 items in the Performing Arts Collection archives are associated with past Opera Australia performances, these have come from individual donations and other collections. Through our new agreement, the Performing Arts Collection will be directly connected to the archives of one of Australia’s most important performing arts companies and we will be able to better document and preserve the history of opera performance in this country.”\n\nOpera Australia’s Artistic Director Lyndon Terracini said, “Opera Australia is not just about singers, we are also about creative artists working in design fields including costumes, sets and props. These artists produce a staggering amount of carefully crafted materials that have to be both spectacular and durable – they get quite a beating over the course of a production run! We are very happy to be sharing some of these with Arts Centre Melbourne, and are appreciative of their care and curatorial expertise. We hope that audience members coming to see some of the operas we have at Arts Centre Melbourne this season, will enjoy the opportunity for a sneak peak at the pieces on display, ahead of the performances.”\n\nArts Centre Melbourne presents: Opera Australia Archive Acquisition Display Arts Centre Melbourne, Smorgon Family Plaza 15 APRIL – 28 JULY, 2013 FREE\n\nWelcome to the first in an occasional series celebrating the career of Australia’s many unsung heroes. Today we celebrate the life and times of Linda Parker. Born in 1912 in Kongwak, a small town in South Gippsland, Parker’s rich and varied career as singer, musician and folklorist was buffetted by both the Depression and World War II.\n\nAs a young girl Parker showed promise as a pianist, won many competitions and scholarships including admittance to the Melba Conservatorium in Melbourne where she studied under director Fritz Hart. A true musician Parker showed great promise not only as a pianist but with many musical instruments, from the violin and viola to the organ at St Patricks Cathedral. Fritz Hart, who was also conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, suggested she experience some orchestral sound and, much to her delight, asked her to play bass drum, triangle and tambourine in the orchestra.\n\nWhile at the Melba Conservatorium she attended classes with Nellie Melba who would give occasional interpretation classes. When in Melbourne Melba would also attend the student’s concerts and visit them backstage, and even invite them to her Australian home, Coombe Cottage, for the student’s annual picnic. As Parker recalls, Melba would don a chef’s hat and apron and proceed to help with the barbeque.\n\nLinda recounts how Melba took hold of her hands and commented on their strength. Linda refrained from mentioning that their strength was probably due to all the cows she milked as a child.\n\nBy the late 1920s, it had become clear to her mentors that Parker should head overseas to further her music training. Funds were raised through concerts and at the age of around nineteen she sailed for London in July 1930.\n\nShe took a scholarship in Paris with renowned pianist Ferdinand Motte-Lacroix and absolutely reveled in the cultural life Paris had on offer. Unfortunately, she had to return to London due to her Australian savings being drastically devalued when England left the Gold Standard. Here she attempted to make ends meet capitalising on the international interest in all things Russian by joining a psuedo-Russian folk group followed by time as the lead singer in a group of sixteen musicians called Don Rico and His Gypsy Girls who dressed in gypsy costumes and sang songs in broken English. After touring the United Kingdom for six months she managed to save enough money to go to Leipzig to study lieder with the famous lieder singer Elena Gerhardt. During her time in Leipzig she lived with a Jewish family during Hitler’s rise to power. Parker remembers being shocked by the anti-Semitic messages on park benches and buildings, and the incredible hysteria that followed Hitler and the Third Reich.\n\nBy 1934 Parker was back in London where she found work wherever she could, including work in cabaret and radio before forming a close harmony trio, The Radio Graces. Parker’s big breakthrough came in 1939 when she sang in a concert at Wigmore Hall which produced brilliant reviews leading to widespread professional booking. Unfortunately these concerts were not to be. War was declared on the 3rd of September 1939. All contracts were automatically cancelled. Devastated Parker offered her services to the Women’s Land Army but was rejected as not ‘robust enough’ to work in the field. As fate would have it Parker was again rescued by music when the BBC invited The Radio Graces to be stationed at their new studios in a country mansion in Worcestershire. Despite this regular work including solo parts designed to entice her to stay, Parker was encouraged by Australian opera star Joan Hammond to pursue her ambitions to become an opera singer.\n\nWith renewed confidence she sent her glowing press notices from her Wigmore Hall recital to Sadler’s Wells Opera Company. Following a successful audition she received a contract in 1942 to sing Mimi in La Boheme and Paminia in The Magic Flute. This was the breakthrough she had been working towards for so long.\n\nShe received impressive reviews including this one by Edwin Evans from the Daily Mail who wrote:\n\n“The cast, a good one all-round includes one very successful newcomer in Linda Parker, an Australian girl who starts with the inestimable advantage of being able to look the character. There have been Mimis of all shapes and sizes, yet not many in whom one could believe in the theatrical sense – but here is one whose demure charm makes one ready to accept the story as it stands – and she sings the part admirably.”\n\nIn 1945, the War in Europe over, Sadler’s Wells was sent to Germany to entertain the occupation forces. Touring under the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), they performed for survivors of a concentration camp and Parker recounts how she would never forget the sight of these people with a “not of this world” look in their eyes. Having survived the War in England with its bombs and doodle bugs, and having witnessed indescribable destruction on both sides, Linda Parker returned to Australia in 1947 having appeared in over 300 performances with Sadler’s Wells.\n\nBack in Australia, she featured in broadcast recitals with the ABC before returning to England for a short stint which included concerts and broadcasts in Germany during the Berlin Air Lift in 1948. Although she returned to Australia to marry, she became increasingly frustrated by the lack of professional opportunities in Australia and spent much of the 1950s performing and travelling throughout the world.\n\nA new chapter in her life began when she brought a Spanish guitar in Barcelona where she took lessons and set about collecting traditional folk songs. On her return to Australia in the early 1960s she appeared in her own television series with the ABC called Linda Parker and Her Guitar and in 1965 recorded ‘Folk Songs Round the World’. During this period she was also offered a position in charge of music at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) where she relished the opportunity to pass on her expertise and to encourage students to learn singing as an extra string to their bow.\n\nLinda Parker-Warmsley passed away in 1994 having lived a full and adventurous life during a turbulent time in history. Through her tireless drive, bravery, and talent she became a star in her own right and although no longer a household name, this collection donated by Parker’s niece Maureen O’Halloran provides a tantalising glimpse into an extraordinary life.\n\nEarly last week the Melbourne performing arts community came together to celebrate the life and arts of Nigel Triffitt who died in Melbourne on 20 July, aged 62.\n\nTriffitt was a hard man to pin down. Always on the move, Triffitt travelled extensively and enjoyed ‘living on the run’. As a writer, designer, director he was similarly peripatetic finding inspiration in the fields of dance, music, opera, puppetry and visual theatre. So it was fitting that the tributes on the day covered various aspects of his personal and professional life. Speakers included Sarah Triffitt who spoke about growing up in awe of her exciting and adventurous cousin Nigel and Lola Pinder (Nigel’s god-daughter) who read words penned by her father producer John Pinder who took a gamble presenting Triffitt’s first major work Momma’s Little Horror Show at the Last Laugh in the early 1980s. Puppeteer and close friend Andrew Hansen spoke movingly about Triffitt’s relationship with his ‘family of choice’ especially during his illness.\n\nDuring the last ten years or so of his life Triffitt embarked upon a very different journey researching the Triffitt family history and travelling the world exploring notions of spirituality. His friend and agent Hilary Linstead accompanied him on many journeys including to the Bungles Bungles where they first discussed a concept for Tap Dogs. Triffitt was drawn to the Australian outback again visiting central Australia with sharman Greg Snowden who also spoke on the day.\n\nNever one to be upstaged, Triffitt had the last word as the audience sat entranced watching him in full flight as keynote speaker at the National Puppetry and Animatronics Summit held at Arts Centre Melbourne in 2002 (you can see it here.)\n\nIn 1998 Triffit donated 30 set models to Arts Centre Melbourne’s Performing Arts Collection reflecting his work on over 17 productions from 1974 to 1995. Productions represented include Momma’s Little Horror Show (1978), Secrets (1983), High Flyers (1985), the Men At Work World Tour (1983) and Tap Dogs (1995). A selection of Triffitt’s perfectly executed balsa wood models is currently on display at Arts Centre Melbourne in the Smorgon Family Plaza as a tribute to one of Australia’s most influential theatremakers.\n\nNellie Stewart as Nell Gwynne in ‘Sweet Nell of Old Drury’, c1902. Arts Centre Melbourne’s Performing Arts Collection.\n\nThis week marks the anniversary of the horrific 1906 SanFrancisco earthquake and fire that left much of the city in ruins and an estimated 300,000 people homeless. Caught in the mayhem that followed were Australian entrepreneur George Musgrove and Nellie Stewart, star of pantomime, light opera and drama, whose beauty and talent won the hearts of the Australian public at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nNellie Stewart was a star of the Williamson, Garner and Musgrove’s Royal Comic Opera Company and throughout the 1880s performed in many of their productions including Patience, La Mascotte, HMS Pinafore, Iolanthe, Dorothy and Princess Ida. When Gilbert & Sullivan’s The Mikado premiered in Australia in 1886, Nellie Stewart was the obvious choice to play the lead.\n\nBuoyed by her singing success, Nellie Stewart attempted to make the transition to grand opera in 1888 taking on the role of Marguerite in Gounod’s Faust. Her success in the role was unfortunately marred by severely strained vocal chords, the result of unwisely singing the role for 24 consecutive nights. Vocal problems continued to plague her and the damage was compounded by further years of singing.\n\nAt age 43, Nellie Stewart decided to reinvent herself, this time as a dramatic star. As fate would have it her first non-musical role would also become the one for which she is best remembered. The play was Paul Kester’s Sweet Nell of Old Drury which premiered on 15 February 1902 at the Princess Theatre. The role was that of Nell Gwynne, a real-life rags-to-riches story of a poor ‘orange seller’ turned actress who became mistress of King Charles II.\n\nApron worn by Nellie Stewart as Nell Gwynn in ‘Sweet Nell of Old Drury’, c1902.1931. Arts Centre Melbourne’s Performing Arts Collection.\n\nNellie’s gamble paid off with sell-out performances and rave reviews following around the country. On the back of its success Nellie and her partner, entrepreneur George Musgrove took the ambitious step of sailing to San Francisco to undertake an American tour of Sweet Nell of Old Drury. They arrived early in 1906 with a full dramatic company, stagehands, scenery, costumes and props. The production and its star were an immediate success and following a successful season, Nellie and daughter Nancye travelled on to Colorado Springs while George remained in San Francisco organising further tour dates.\n\nWhen the city was struck by an earthquake and ensuring fire on 18 April, Musgrove was caught in the midst of the devastation. A week later, ragged and battered, he made his way to his worried family. Scenery was destroyed in the disaster and the Sweet Nell tour had to be abandoned. It was a financial loss from which George Musgrove and Nellie Stewart never fully recovered. To enable the company to return to Australia, they sold their home in England and Nellie sold all her jewellery."
