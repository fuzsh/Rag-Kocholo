Allegro molto vivace / Elena Gaponenko, pianist & cellist / Oehms Classics OC 1884\n\nElena Gaponenko is so talented that neither the classical music biz nor the record companies know what to do with her. In addition to being a world-class pianist, she is also a first-rate cellist and has given recitals on both instruments (sometimes switching between them in the middle of a program). She also loves to play a wide range of music that focuses as much on modern works, which are virtually taboo in the classical world, and this, too keeps people from being able to pigeonhole her. Yet these two recital discs are really “WOW factor” recordings that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nGARDEN, MARY\n\nBIZET: Carmen: En vain pour eviter. CHARPENTIER: Louise.

MASSENET: Le Jongleur de Notre Dame: Fidelité! / Mary Garden, soprano w/various accompaniments, available for free streaming at Internet Archive\n\nSoprano Mary Garden (1874-1967), once considered to be one of the finest singing actresses of her day—she was often compared the Sarah Bernhardt—is now virtually forgotten except by collectors of old records. Part of the reason is that only some of the effect she made on audiences through her voice, via subtle shadings and coloration, survives on records. Her magnetic stage presence is lost to history. Yet she was a major star of Hammerstein’s opera house in New York and, between 1910 and 1929, she sang a great deal in Chicago, even becoming director of the Chicago Opera from the late 1910s through the ‘20s.\n\nPart of the reason for her problems may be seen in the choice of material she recorded. She only made a handful of operatic aria recordings, and very often, as in the case of the scene from Alfano’s Resurrection and (not included here) her Columbia recording of “Ah fors’ e lui…Sempre libera” from Traviata, were recorded in French instead of Italian. Most of her recorded legacy consists of songs, both Scotch and drawing-room ballads, and while she may have enjoyed performing such material (Cadman’s At Dawning was one of her few favorite records), this is material that virtually any good soprano of her time could have sung (and did). Yet there are indeed flashes of brilliance here; her recorded legacy isn’t nearly as bleak as that of Olive Fremstad.\n\nGAUTHIER, EVA\n\nJACQUES-DALCROZE: La chère maison.

WATTS: The Wings of Night. TURINA: Rima / Eva Gauthier, mezzo-soprano w/various accompaniments / available for free streaming on Internet Archive\n\nAlthough she is not alone among singers from the early 20th century for being forgotten, Éva Gauthier was once considered a major artist in her promotion of indigenous French and Canadian songs, modern music (including Milhaud, Hindemith, Bartók, Stravinsky’s Perséphone and Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes’ Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan), plus the music of Java, to which she moved in1910, not returning to North America until 1915 at the outbreak of World War I. From that point forward she became an important recital singer, mesmerizing her audiences with her bright and powerful mezzo voice and energetic interpretations.\n\nThe recordings listed above are from my own personal collection, cleaned up as much as I could. The 1938 electrical recordings, unfortunately, all have a strange delayed reverb on them; this is how they came to me; but they are so rare that they merit inclusion.\n\nGAUVIN, KARINA\n\nFAURÉ: Mandoline.

VIVALDI: Roseanne: Addio caro / Karina Gauvin, soprano; Arion Orchestre Baroque; Alexander Weimann, conductor / Atma Classique ACD2 2648\n\nThe great Canadian soprano Karina Gauvin, unfortunately, wastes much of her time singing that ol’ Baroque junk that just toodles along and goes in one ear and out the other, but she sings it with so much energy and such a bewitching voice that one is left stunned by the results (and one wonders why Cecilia Bartoli hasn’t used her in one of her own recordings). The recital of French songs shows that Gauvin can also deliver fine interpretations in much that has a bit more depth.\n\nGEDDA, NICOLAI\n\nADAM: Le Postillon de Lonjumeau: Mes amis, ecoutez l’histoire.

Evening Bells / Nicolai Gedda, tenor; Capella Russian Chorus; Balalaika Orch. / available for free streaming on Internet Archive\n\nNicolai Gedda was one of the most famous, popular, and recorded tenors of his time, yet nowadays he is somewhat neglected if not forgotten as Fritz Wunderlich’s legend continues to grow. This is unfortunate. Gedda was a superb musician and a phenomenal linguist who spoke ten languages fluently (Swedish, Russian, French, Italian, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian and Czech) and recorded in eight of them. He had a fine voice but was often out of form as he suffered from neuroses which affected his voice, After 1973, his singing became less and less focused as his nervous condition continued, but when he was good he was very good.\n\nLIEDER DER WELT / VERACINI: Roselinda: Meco verrai.

Concerto for Piano & Wind Instruments w/Alexander Toradze, pianist. PROKOFIEV: Scythian Suite: Parts 1 & 2; Part 3. / Valery Gergiev, conductor; Rotterdam Philharmonic Orch. / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking titles above\n\nOnce upon a time, Valery Gergiev was one of the most exciting conductors on earth. Then he went to London, where the Brits told him what-for and made him tame his music-making down. So now he is merely a shell of his former self. These live performances, dating from 1997, are by his former self.\n\nGERHARDT, ELENA\n\nSCHUBERT: An die Musik. Die schöne Müllerin: Wohin? Du bist die Ruh’.

Und willst du deinen Liebsten sehen? / Elena Gerhardt, mezzo-soprano; Arthur Nikisch, pianist / available for free streaming on YouTube\n\nElena Gerhardt (1882-1961), long famous as the greatest lieder singer in the world until Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau arrived on the scene, actually had two careers: one between 1903, when she turned 21 years old (the recordings listed here were made in 1907 and 1911), and 1920, when her voice was in pristine condition, and the other from 1925 to 1932 on electrical recordings, by which time both her vocal quality and breath control had deteriorated prematurely. She was still a fascinating interpreter even on those later records, and in some cases more musically exact—some of these early performances are sung and played too slowly and use a broad legato phrasing when a somewhat more conversational approach to the words seemed more appropriate—but she never again had this beauty of voice, which included floated head tones, masterful breath control and a ringing, non-shrill top range. It should also be noted that that her 1907 recordings from this series was the first time a noted, famous pianist—in this case none other than conductor Arthur Nikisch—acted as accompanist to a singer on discs.\n\nGIELEN, MICHAEL\n\nFrom MICHAEL GIELEN EDITION, Vol. 4: SCHUMANN: Szenen aus Goethes “Faust” / Günter Reich, bar (Faust); Judith Beckmann, sop (Gretchen/Solo); Robert Holl, bs (Mephistopheles/Böser Geist); Margrit Neubauer, alto (Martha/Schuld/Mater gloriosa/ Maria Aegyptica); Anthony Rolfe-Johnson, ten (Ariel/Pater Ecstaticus); Doris Soffel, mezzo (Sorge); Mitsuko Shirai, sop (Not/Magna Peccatrix); Tadao Yoshie, bar (PaterSeraphicus, Dr. Marianus); Tolzer Knabenchor; Chor der Norddeutschen Rundfunks Hamburg / DVOŘÁK: Violin Concerto in A min. w/Josef Suk, vln; Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart des SWR/ SCHUMANN: Manfred Overture.

Artur Rodziński continued to be great until his untimely death in 1958, and Charles Munch was similarly great until his death a decade later, but of those who I remember well only Carlos Kleiber, Klaus Tennstedt, Valery Gergiev (until about 2010, when he went to London and changed and softened his style) and Michael Gielen were consistently so, and of these Gielen had by far the widest-ranging repertoire as the contents of the above collections will attest. I was extremely fortunate to be living in Cincinnati during his years as our symphony’s music director; his concerts were consistently interesting and for the most part very intense. These recordings cover much of his career in Germany, which is where he spent most of it, and the above recordings—in addition to my recommendations within the composer section of this guide—are, in my view, indispensable souvenirs of his outstanding artistry.\n\nGIGLI, BENIAMINO\n\nLEONCAVALLO: Mattinata.

BUZZI-PECCIA: Lolita. DI CHIARA: La Spagnola. DONAUDY: O del mio amato ben / Beniamino Gigli, tenor / available for free streaming on YouTube\n\nNo tenor of his time, not even the great Caruso, had such a perfect vocal placement as that of Beniamino Gigli, and rare are the tenors from any era who could match him in conveying joy, sadness, anger or grief strictly through the voice, but as Nicolai Gedda pointed out, with Gigli’s voice you also get his incredibly sloppy and over-emotional musical style. He nonetheless did a superb job in his complete operas of Un ballo in Maschera (because it suited his style) and Andrea Chenier (because, for the first and only time in his career, he sang cleanly and stopped all the sobbing and glotting). In this program of mostly Neapolitan songs—if you overlook the constant sobbing and glotting and listen to the way he sings—Gigli is at his sloppy-but-lovable best.\n\nGIRAUD ENSEMBLE CHAMBER ORCHESTRA\n\nGULDA: Concerto for Myself w/Mischa Cheung, pianist; Janic Sarott, drummer; Stanislaw Sandronov, electric guitarist.

MERKUR: Stardust / Anthony Goldstone, Caroline Clemmow, pianists / Divine Art 25089\n\nNormally, I avoid duo-piano acts like the plague, and especially when classical piano duos deign to attempt playing “jazz,” but Caroline Clemmow and her late husband, the indefatigable Anthony Goldstone, were happy exceptions to this rule. Of course, one must accept the fact that these particular jazz-influenced pieces came relatively early, in the 1920s, and of the various composers presented here only Darius Milhaud and George Gershwin had any idea what real jazz of that time sounded like, so often what you get here is closer to ragtime, but they capture the rhythms and the spirit of the music wonderfully.\n\nGOLDSCHEIDER, BEN\n\nWIDMANN: Air for Solo Horn.

Everyone else thought that he played with “the wrong tone” or “the wrong technique” or whatever, mostly because they hated the deep, rich, woody tone he could get in his lower register and the brilliance of his upper range, but nowadays he’s considered an icon. Go figure. Anyway, these recordings represent the best of his playing in classical music, and all but the Brahms and Debussy pieces were made with the composers accompanying him.\n\nGORR, RITA\n\nWAGNER: Lohengrin: Entweihte Götter!

Available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking titles above.\n\nFor a period of a little over a decade, from 1956 to 1970, Belgian mezzo-soprano Rita Gorr was one of the hottest properties in the opera world. Her bright but beautiful, sharply cutting voice was ideal for Verdi, Gluck, Saint-Saëns, and Wagner’s Ortrud in Lohengrin; indeed, she was such a solid seller on records that EMI even used her in the bit part of Martha Schertlein in their 1957 stereo remake of Faust with de los Angeles, Gedda and Christoff. But then she ran into vocal difficulties and disappeared for almost a decade, and when she returned she stuck to more vocally conservative roles such as the mother in Louise and Giulietta in Les contes d’Hoffmann. You can hear a little bit why this happened in some of her top notes in the second recital disc, where she doesn’t quite lose control of the voice but is still a bit raw-sounding. She just pushed that upper range too hard for too long a time. But these recordings, always highly sought by collectors, will give you a good idea of what all the fuss was about.\n\nGOULD, GLENN\n\nTHE YOUNG MAVERICK / J.S. BACH: Goldberg Variations.

After all, in addition to having one of the creamiest mezzo-soprano voices in history, an ironclad technique that has sustained her voice throughout a 27-year career despite having first been a pianist for several years, and first-class musicianship that has drawn living composers to write for her, she is also extraordinarily beautiful and has a magnetic personality. Although I sometimes find her interpretations rather cool when compared to such firebrand mezzos as Rita Gorr and Tatiana Troyanos, she is never less than interesting thanks to her subtle but fully engaged identification with the characters she sings. In this well-filled 6-CD set, you may find a few performances that are less that fully satisfying interpretively and some music that is less interesting than most on these discs,, but so few that it won’t matter. An indispensable set chronicling the wide range of a superior singer.\n\nGRAVEURE, LOUIS\n\nARNOLD: Castle of Andalusia: Flow thou regal purple stream. PUCCINI: La Bohème: Che gelida manina.

LISZT: Liebesträum / Louis Graveure, baritone/tenor except for track 3 / available for free streaming on Internet Archive\n\nFew singers in history were like “Louis Graveure,” the self-styled Belgian baritone-turned-tenor who began his career as a British baritone named Wilfrid Douthitt. In addition to presenting himself under a false nationality (in part to avoid being drafted by Great Britain to fight in World War I), he was a cad, a four-flusher, a a liar, and one of the more interesting artists who ever took the stage. In addition to switching his vocal range from baritone to tenor, he revamped his entire repertoire not once, not twice, but four times. He was a combination of David Bispham, Peter Dawson, Jan Kiepura, W.C. Fields and The Great Imposter. Coming to New York in 1914, he landed the leading male role in a musical titled The Lilac Domino under his real name. He married the show’s leading lady, soprano Eleanor Painter, who came from a ealthy family and so wore the purse strings. After The Lilac Domino closed, Douthitt took three months off, grew a beard and mustache, shaved his hairline back to make himself look older, then changed his name to Louis Graveure and began singing as a “Belgian baritone”—one who could not speak French, sang French with a British accent but sang English flawlessly. Some of the critics saw through his ruse but, having no real reason to claim him a fraud, just dropped hints in their reviews. Around 1924 he began teaching voice and in the process learned that he could extend his own range up to tenor, so up he went to all the starring roles.\n\nThere’s a lot more to the Douthitt-Graveure story, including his moving to Berlin around 1930 and establishing himself as a German opera and movie star, marrying yet again while over there (the beautiful German actress Camilla Horn) but then ditching wife #2 just as he unceremoniously dumped wife #1, then packing all of his records into a steamer trunk and getting the hell out of Germany just before all hell broke loose in 1938 and going back to England, where he admitted being Wilfrid Douthitt, British citizen, and working in the code room during the war.\n\nAs a singer, Graveure-Douthitt had a very dry voice with no overtones, very typical of British baritones of that era, but it’s easy to hear his other excellent qualities such as a firm tone, crystal-clear diction and a lively sense of interpretation. Included in this set are recordings of some of his recital repertoire as both baritone and tenor as well as some of his German film songs of the 1930s. I’ve also included one recording by wife #1, Eleanor Painter, because her discs are actually rarer than his.\n\nGRÜMMER, ELISABETH\n\nMOZART: Warnung. Der Zauberer. Der Sylphe. Das Veilchen.
