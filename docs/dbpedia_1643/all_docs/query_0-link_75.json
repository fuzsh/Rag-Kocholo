        "text": "Tudor Davies, the famous Welsh operatic tenor, was born in Pen-y-Wern Cottage, later to become 173 High Street in the Cymmer district of Porth on November 12 1892. One of twelve children born to Sarah and David Davies, a number of his siblings died in infancy. The entire family were uncommonly talented and his father, a surface mechanic at the colliery known as “Gaffer Yard”, possessed a fine singing voice. The children followed the example of their father and were accomplished singers or instrumentalists in their own right from a very early age.\n\nUnfortunately owing to a general shortage of money the children were restricted in receiving professional musical training and only Tudor was allowed the privilege. He attended the local schools in which he was given the opportunity to perform in concerts and stage plays which displayed his natural singing voice. During this time he also became proficient at playing the violin. By this time Wales had already long-since gained its reputation as the “Land of Song” and the Rhondda Valley was certainly a typical example of this, becoming something of a jewel in the proverbial cultural crown."
