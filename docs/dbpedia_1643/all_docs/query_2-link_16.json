        "text": "Singing and other Sins was broadcast on Hawaii Public Radio until 9 April 2022. You can read more about the history of the program and its name. Previous programs are not being broadcast, but you can listen to many of them in the archive below.\n\nThe archive contains shows from 2011 (and earlier) to 2022.\n\nListen to as little or as much of a program as you like. If you have requests, comments, or suggestions, please let us know.\n\nFor Rilke fans you’ll find that there are many art songs to his words in this program from 2006.\n\nAlso from the past, here’s a quiz program that will test your knowledge of art song composers and singers.\n\nHere are a few other suggestions of my favorite programs: Beethoven Lite: 11 May 2019 The scowling Beethoven is not heard on this edition of Singing and other Sins. Rather, his light-hearted Lieder, folk songs, and instrumental works. You’ll hear Hermann Prey, Lotte Lehmann, and many other singers and pianists with special Beethoven talents.\n\nLiszt/Petrarch: 25 November 2012. Liszt was inspired by Petrarch’s sonnets to write songs, then pianos pieces based on the songs, and finally a revision for low voice of the original songs. We’ll hear all of these! The tenor is John Aler, the baritone is Thomas Quastoff.\n\nFor those who don’t like art song, there are plenty of introductory programs such as: Alma’s Songs/Art Songs for People Who Don’t Like Art Songs: 12 January 2019. Gary’s good friend Alma McGoldrick has known him for over 35 years, loves opera, symphonic music, etc., but has never come to enjoy art songs. Gary assembled the songs on this program to prove to her that, deep down, she really does love art song.\n\nJump ahead to:\n\n2022\n\nFarewell Program: 9 April 2022. After guiding first Great Songs, then Singing and other Sins, since 1988, I decided to stop producing art song programs for HPR. In this final program I trace my radio history, from 1972 WBAI in New York City, to HPR in 1988. You’ll hear excerpts from my interviews with Lotte Lehmann, Hermann Prey, and Ned Rorem. There are songs performed by two winners of the Art Song Contest that Great Songs sponsored: Jordan Shanahan and Quinn Kelsey. Both of these baritones are making their mark on international opera stages.\n\nOn this farewell programs I include many songs of goodbye. It has been a joy for me to share art song with listeners, whether in New York City or throughout the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nUkraine Potpourri: 2 April 2022. Sadly Ukraine continues to be in the news. This program offers many aspects of Ukraine’s music. You’ll hear Vladimir Horowitz and Emanuel Ax, both born in what is now Ukraine, as well as Prokofiev and other composers born there. There’s a section of folk music of Ukraine with the support of vigorous choral groups.\n\nAndré Schuen: 26 March 2022. As part of our interest in providing programs that present recent releases, you can hear portions of baritone Schuen’s two Avi CDs offering Lieder by Schubert and Schumann.\n\nUkrainian Composer Yakiv Stepovyi: 17 March 2022; originally broadcast 5 October 2019. One of the best-known composers of Ukraine, Stepovyi (1883-1921) wrote beautiful songs. Though not influenced by folk songs, his music is tonal and easily enjoyed on first hearing. You’ll hear solo, duet, and trio songs with such renowned singers as Pavlo Hunka, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and Michael Colvin.\n\nErnest Chausson: 12 March 2022. Though his mélodie tend to be laid-back and even melancholy, there’s a lot of beauty to enjoy. I begin the program with the orchestra version of Chausson’s Poéme de l’amour et de la mer. Individual songs follow, performed by Ann Murray, Christine Schäfer, Nathalie Stutzmann, and Gérard Souzay.\n\nUkrainian Composer Kyrylo Stetsenko: 5 March 2022; originally broadcast: 5 October 2019. With our focus on the war there, this is a chance to enjoy one of the best-known composers of Ukraine, Kyrylo Stetsenko (1882-1922), who wrote beautiful songs. Though not influenced by folk songs, his music is tonal and easily enjoyed on first hearing. You’ll hear these songs performed by such renowned singers as Pavlo Hunka, Benjamin Butterfield, and Russell Braun. The foremost Ukrainian poets inspired Stetsenko’s songs, so you’ll hear their language. You’ll even hear the Ukraine national anthem, composed by Stetsenko.\n\nMy Lotte Lehmann Memories: 26 February 2022. A personal memoire, in sound, of my Lotte Lehmann life. I first met her in 1961 when I was 20 and she 73. Besides being one of the few geniuses that I’ve known, Mme Lehmann became a kind of “grandmother” figure to me, writing me encouraging letters as I traveled the world as a bassist. And, after a lot research following her passing in 1976, I’ve become somewhat of a Lehmann expert. I hope you’ll understand all this better after hearing this program.\n\nArt Songs of Ukraine: 19 February 2022: originally 4 March 2017. Ukraine is very much in the news, so it’s appropriate that we offer the songs of Ukraine (from the Ukrainian Art Song Project), beginning with their most famous composer, Mikola Lysenko.\n\nBernstein’s SongFest 2nd Half: 12 February 2022: originally 6 July 2014. This set was commissioned for the country’s bi-centennial, but wasn’t finished until 1977. The comparisons continue on this second half of the SongFest and ends with Bernstein conducting his Chichester Psalms.\n\nBernstein’s SongFest First Half: 5 February 2022: originally 29 June 2014. This wonderful set of songs deserves to be heard more often. I offer comparison recordings including one conducted by the composer himself.\n\nLorraine Hunt-Lieberson: 29 January 2022. You’ll hear mezzo-soprano Hunt Lieberson live in recital performing Lieder of Brahms, Debussy, Mozart, and Mahler: his Rückert songs. Her pianists are either Peter Serkin or Roger Vignoles.\n\nShostakovich: 22 January 2022: originally: 22 September 2013. By popular request, I play the two amazing recordings of the Blok songs of Shostakovich. One with Joan Rogers and the other with its dedicatee, Galina Vishnevskaya. Blok Translations\n\nSolo Pianists As Accompanists Part Two: 15 January 2022: Most solo pianists seem happy to remain in that position, but there are those who occasionally record with an art song singer. This is the second of two programs to share these artists’ pursuits, including a sample of both genres. You’ll hear: Garrick Ohlsson, Stephen Hough, Alicia de Larrocha, Alexis Weissenberg, Leif Ove Andsnes, and Christoph Eschenbach.\n\nFun German Songs: 8 January 2022: Many people assume Germans and their Lieder to be serious, without fun. You’ll hear many silly, crazy, and funny songs that include composers such as Haydn, Beethoven, Loewe, Brahms, and Hugo Wolf.\n\nComposers’ Choice: 1 January 2022: I asked composers to send their favorite art song (of theirs) and here’s what went into the program: Larry Alan Smith’s “Lia” from his set called Epigrams; Lori Laitman’s “Orange Afternoon Lover”, from her cycle Against Still Life; Tom Cipullo’s “Of a Certain Age” from his cycle called The Garden; Arthur Keegan-Bole chose his setting of Thomas Hardy’s “The Walk”; Ricky Ian Gordon chose his “Lullaby,” from a set called Way Back to Paradise; Libby Larson sent us her song called “Boy’s Lips”; Donald Womack chose the song called “You” from his 23 Chinese Proverbs; Juliana Hall sent “Sonnet” from her set called Night Dances; Bill Bolcom chose “Amor”; Jake Heggie’s chosen song was “The Gossips” from his set called Camille Claudel: Into the Fire; Paula Kimper chose “Looking Back”; Garth Baxter sent “Nights without Sleep”; Bob McCauley sent “The Steps” from his A Seven of Sonnets; Larry Desner chose “She Walks in Beauty.”\n\n2021\n\nChristmas Carols Sung by the Greats: 25 December 2021: I’ve designed this program to not only feature wonderful singers, but to also engage the listener by having them guess each soloist. I divulge their names after they carol is over. Naming a few here, won’t spoil the game, because one doesn’t know the order: Joan Sutherland, Kiri Te Kanawa, Placido Domingo, Marilyn Horne, Leontyne Price, etc., etc.\n\nBach Christmas Oratorio: 18 December 2021: The whole oratorio takes too long, so I combined selections from the first three cantatas, which include many of the most appreciated music of the work. I used Harnoncourt’s recording with the Arnold Schoenberg Choir, and soloists: Christine Schäfer, Bernarda Fink, Werner Güra, and Gerald Finley.\n\nSolo Pianists As Accompanists Number One: 11 December 2021: Most solo pianists seem happy to remain in that position, but there are those who occasionally record with an art song singer. This is the first of two programs to share these artists’ pursuits, including a sample of both genres. Here are the pianists on this program: Richter, Browning, Cortot, Ashkenazy, Brendel, Lupu, and Shelley.\n\nBartok: 4 December 2021: Based on a program from 2012, this one continues to offer both the folk and art songs of Bartok.\n\nEdita Gruberova Memorial: 27 November 2021: Best known as a coloratura opera soprano, luckily for us Lieder-Lovers, Gruberova also recorded many art songs. You’ll hear all eight of Dvorak’s Love Songs (in her native Slovakian), as well as Lieder by Brahms, Schubert, and Strauss.\n\nThanksgiving 2021: 20 November 2021: This program combines a contemporary composition of songs of translated Indian words that I contrast with Christian art songs, choral works, etc.\n\nNathalie Stutzmann: 13 November 2021: We celebrate Stutzmann’s appointment as the next music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra with her recordings of mélodie of Debussy and Lieder of Brahms, Schubert, and Schumann.\n\nSchubert/Rott: 6 November 2021: Using the Hans Zimmerman “creative exploration” of Schubert’s Winterreise as comparison, you can hear a set of songs that the contemporary composer Enjott Schneider developed from the Romantic Lieder of Hans Rott.\n\nHalloween 2021: 30 October 2021: Death in its many manifestations seems to be the focus of this program. Many 21st Century composers contributed their art songs to the creepy episode: “Ah, are you digging on my grave,” words by Thomas Hardy, music by Ellen Mandel; Charles Norman Mason set words of Gerard Manley Hopkins: “I Feel the Fell of Dark”; “The Conquerer Worm” by Benjamin C.S. Boyle, to a poem by Edgar Allen Poe; Scott Gendel’s “Mad Song”; “Night without Sleep” to poetry of Paul Henry Ford, composed by Paul Bowles; Steven Stucky’s “Buffalo Bill” to a poem by e. e. cummings; “The Self-Unseeing,” a Thomas Hardy poem set by Michael Murray; Bill Bolcom’s “Black Max”; “this one Lavender Disaster,” words of Mike Alexander, music of Robert McCauley; Edgar Allan Poe’s, “Spirits of the Dead” set by Eric Schwartz; “And death shall have no dominion,” poetry by Dylan Thomas and music by Stephen Louis Bayne.\n\nBrahms/Strauss: 23 October 2021: A chance to hear the last great works of two important composers of art song: Brahms’ Four Serious Songs, performed by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald Moore in a live 1958 Salzburg Festival. and Strauss’ Four Last Songs, in a classic 1954 recording of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Otto Ackermann.\n\nDiary of One Who Vanished: 16 October 2021: A Great Songs program of 2002 provides the introduction and complete recording of this masterpiece of a cycle by Janacek. You’ll hear tenor Ian Bostridge in the complete cycle and then Nicolai Gedda in the last half of the cycle. The latter tenor is more operatic in approach, but both are excellent.\n\nCanadians Gauvin and Hamelin: 9 October 2021: Soprano Karina Gauvin and pianist Marc André Hamelin team up to present an all mélodie recital. Fauré, Debussy, Ravel, Poulenc and Honegger are their composers.\n\nSchwanengesang: 2 October 2021: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings Schubert’s “cycle” with Gerald Moore. I provide brief introdutory comments.\n\nFinal Ravel and Fauré Song Cycles: 25 September 2021: Two great song cycles were composed by these French masters shortly before their deaths. By an historic coincidence two excellent baritones (Panzera and Singher) recorded their interpretations, so you can hear those as well as modern recordings of L’horizon chimerique and Don Quichotte á Dulcinée.\n\nKindertotenlieder: 18 September 2021: Though a morbid thought today, in Mahler’s time and even more so in the time of Rückert, the poet of this cycle, the death of children was commonplace. In any case, the music is beautiful and we hear it sung by the sensitive baritone Thomas Hampson and in the iconic recording with Bruno Walter by Kathleen Ferrier.\n\nConductors as Accompanists: 11 September 2021: Some conductors drop their batons to sit at the piano and accompany singers in art songs. You’ll hear historic combinations of Lehmann and Ferrier with Bruno Walter at the piano. Furtwängler accompanies Schwarzkopf, Arthur Nikisch with Elena Gerhardt, etc.\n\nStrauss Accompanies Strauss: 4 September 2021: Luckily for history, Richard Strauss was recorded as the pianist as far back as 1920 and with many excellent singers: Heinrich Schlusnus, Peter Anders, Julius Patzak, Anton Dermota, and Hilde Konetzni. These are compared with modern recordings of the same songs.\n\nDuets 2021: 28 August 2021: Duets from the master Lieder composers: Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Brahms sung by Julia Varady, Peter Schreier, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Hermann Prey, Felicity Lott, Ann Murray, Christine Schäfer, John Mark Ainsley, Lynne Dawson, Michael Schade, Hidenori Komatsu, Kurt Moll, Juliane Banse, Brigitte Fassbaender, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Pierrette Alarie, and Leopold Simoneau.\n\nHiddenTreasures: 21 August 2021: You’ll enjoy Spanish style songs by Rossini, Tom Cipullo’s contemporary sound, and Hans Gál’s Romantic Brahms-like Lieder. Excellent singers and recordings offer you the best possible listening experience.\n\nBryn Terfel: 14 August 2021: You’ll hear Bryn Terfel sing folk and Welsh songs, Schubert, and Schumann Lieder and of course, English songs such as John Ireland, Arthur Summervell, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. There’s also duets with Cecilia Bartolli in Marriage of Figaro and Barber of Seville.\n\nTranscriptions 2021: 7 August 2021: On this program you’ll discover the many ways that songs of Schubert and Saint Säens can be arranged. There’s versions for horn, oboe, or even four horns that compete with the originals.\n\nComfort in Death & Mourning: 31 July 2021: I have arranged this program to cover what seems to me a consoling look at the inevitable end of our lives. The beginning of this edition of Singing and other Sins, includes Copland’s songs based on Emily Dickinson’s poems, such as “Going to Heaven.” You’ll also hear Richard Hundley’s “Come ready and see me.” “Abendempfindung” by Mozart, fits in well. “Auf dem Kirchhofe” or at the Churchyard by Brahms is sensitively sung by Christa Ludwig. The Sanctus from the Berlioz Requiem and the Ravel version of Kaddish offer a religious segment. “O Tod, wie bitter bist du” /O death, how bitter you are by Brahms is played toward the end. Please let me know your reaction to this sensitive topic.\n\nMy Favorite Recordings: 24 July 2021: These are personal favorite recordings, that for me, bring together the combination of pianist, singer, poet, and composer to produce what I deem “just right.” Some of the examples include: Elgar’s “Where corals lie” with Janet Baker, Schubert’s “Die Liebe hat gelogen” with Karl Erb; Phidylé by Duparc with Gérard Souzay and Dalton Baldwin; Kathleen Ferrier singing Mahler’s “Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen,” or Kathleen Battle with Christopher Parkening in Dowland’s “Come again sweet love.”\n\nAve Maria: 17 July 2021: The Catholic prayer has been set as art songs, choral works, and even appears in Verdi’s Otello. We’ll sample many of these genres and enjoy some beautiful singing. The composers include Schubert, Gounod, Joaquin, Dvorák, Cornelius, Mendelssohn, Bruckner, and Rachmaninov.\n\nBastille Day 2021: 10 July 2021: Blair Boone-Migura joins Gary Hickling to present a celebration of the French national day using mélodie based on the poetry of Victor Hugo. You’ll hear Blair read Hugo’s poetry, and enjoy the many settings of songs such as “O, quand je dors,” “S’il est un charmant gazon,” and “Comment, disaient-ils.” The singers include Elly Ameling, Gérard Souzay, Thomas Hampson, John Mark Ainsley, Ann Murray, Felicity Lott, Janice Taylor, and John Aler.\n\nIndependence Day 2021: 3 July 2021: A chance to celebrate the 4th of July (one day early) without bombs bursting in air. No, this program will offer all the comforts of the American home, hearth, family, and nature in 21st Century art songs by American composers. There’s one 20th Century work, that’s Barber’s “Knoxville summer of 1915” which served as my inspiration for the program. Here are the other composers: Paula Kimper, David Heuzer, Gregory Hall, Lori Laitman, Robert Fleischer, Philip Schroeder, and Kenton Coe.\n\nHistory of the Lied: 26 June 2021: A brief sampling of Lieder from Bach to Strauss in one hour. I chose the voice of Lotte Lehmann as the demonstration, but made one huge mistake. See if you can discover which major Lieder composer I left out.\n\nCarl Loewe: 19 June 2021: An introduction to the scary, funny, and enchanting ballads of this composer, who was called the “Schubert of the North.” Loewe was born about the same time as Schubert (and lived a whole lot longer), and was famous for singing his own ballads while accompanying himself at the piano. We’ll hear a broad range of his songs; you won’t be disappointed.\n\nItalian Songs: 12 June 2021: From Baroque through Romantic and into the 20th century, you’ll hear some beautiful songs with singers who range from Cecila Bartoli to Placido Domingo.\n\nDie schöne Müllerin: 5 June 2021: The Beautiful Miller-maid by Schubert is heard without interruption. Sanford Sylvan, baritone and David Breitman, pianoforte (an instrument that sounds a lot like the keyboard of Schubert’s time), perform the cycle with joy and agility.\n\nSongs for Curiousity: 29 May 2021: You are to guess what the singers have in common, besides being carbon-based organisms. Here are some of the names: Elisabeth Schumann, Heinrich Schlusnus, Lotte Lehmann, Frida Leider, Tito Schipa, Friedrich Schorr, Mariano Stabile, Maggie Teyte, Oda Slobadskaya, and Elisabeth Oems. Good luck!\n\nHerman Prey Program Number Two: 22 May 2021: See the information below. On this second program Prey discusses how important it was for him to hear playbacks of his recordings. It was his best teacher! He also discusses his longing for singable contemporary opera and art song. You’ll hear him sing Lieder by Brahms, Schubert, Beethoven and Strauss. There’s also an excerpt from a Lortzing operetta.\n\nHermann Prey Program Number One: 15 May 2021: In 1973 while living and working in Munich I interviewed Prey. He’d just about finished the huge project of recording the history of the Lied. On this first program that’s the main topic of discussion. This leads to many examples of his singing of Lieder from the Middle Ages until modern songs with the composers accompanying. Along the way, you hear Prey sing Rossini, Mozart, Schubert, and many more favorites.\n\nMélodie Exotique: 8 May 2021: Many fine French composers were fascinated by the Near and Far East. They found poetry that fit their interests and it is those songs that comprise this program. Fauré, Debussy, Berlioz, Delage, Paladilhe, Ravel, and Bizet are the composers for this program.\n\nChrista Ludwig Memorial: 1 May 2021: We recognize the passing of one of the great voices of the recent past with examples of her singing opera, Lieder, and cantata. We have included many excerpts from our 85th birthday interview with Mme Ludwig, that will provide background and a lot of her laughter.\n\nNature Songs: 24 April 2021: In celebration of Earth Day, I’ve assembled appropriate American songs including by Copland, Laitman, Barber, Cipullo, Bowles, and many more. Songs you know and some you may not, but all with the theme of the outdoors.\n\nName the Composer 2021: 17 April 2021: This is your chance to sharpen your listings. I provide hints, you guess the name of the mystery composer.\n\nLullabies for Jessica: 10 April 2021: My grand niece gives birth this month and I figured that with three kids under the age of three, she might need all the cradle songs possible. All of these are sung by Montserrat Figueras and range from Rennaisance to modern songs. The accompaniments are authentic to whatever era lullaby she sings.\n\nEaster Songs: 3 April 2021: A huge range of Good Friday and Easter songs or choruses can be enjoyed on this program. Schubert, Wolf, Barber, Poulenc, and Mahler, are just some of the composers represented.\n\nA Passover Seder 2021: 27 March 2021: A musical Passover Seder featuring tenor Jan Peerce. A chorus of children as well as a professional chorus and a narrator make this a satisfying experience for those of any faith or culture.\n\nChrista Ludwig Sings Romantic Songs: 20 March 2021: Part of the Recordings of the Century, you’ll hear Ludwig in many of the songs that she’s famous for singing: Wagner’s Wesendonck Lieder, Mahler’s Rückert songs, and more.\n\nBorrowed From His Own Lieder: 13 March 2021: replay of 3 August 2019: Gary offers the chance to hear how composers have used their art songs in other works, whether opera, symphonic, chamber music or solo piano. The examples range from Mahler to Liszt.\n\nRecently Composed American Songs: 6 March 2021: Enjoyable art songs by Erik Franklin, Lori Laitman, Julianna Hall, Rachel Fogarty, and Paula Kimper include a duet, solo and solo accompanied examples. These songs are performed by talented singers with excellent pianists.\n\nLotte Lehmann Birthday: 27 February 2021: You’ll hear Lehmann sing followed by one of her students in the same song. Many of them also speak about studying with her. You’ll hear Marilyn Horne, Grace Bumbry, Benita Valente, Mildred Miller, and others.\n\nRoland Hayes: 20 February 2021: This wonderful tenor sang first in 20th century acoustic recordings and throughout his long life was able to make recordings until the 1960s. Son of emancipated enslaved parents, Hayes studied in the U.S., but made his name in Europe before returning to tour the States for years. You’ll hear live and studio recordings of German, French, and English art songs, as well as his own arrangements of spirituals. There’s a portion in which he speaks of his devotion to singing these last mentioned songs.\n\nValentines Day: 13 February 2021: replay of 14 February 2016. Though there are songs in English, the heart of the program is Fauré’s La bonne Chanson in two versions: with Gérard Souzay and Suzanne Danco. Translations\n\nLiszt/Petrarch: 6 February 2021: replay of 25 November 2012. Liszt was inspired by Petrarch’s sonnets to write songs, then pianos pieces based on the songs, and finally a revision for low voice of the original songs. We’ll hear all of these! The tenor is John Aler, the baritone is Thomas Quastoff.\n\nThomas Hampson: 30 January 2021: replay from Great Songs of July 2008. Amy Healey joined Gary in a program of Hampson’s recordings as well as an interview with the baritone recorded earlier in that year. You’ll hear a discussion about the original score to Dichterliebe and listen to a comparison between the edited version and the original of the first song.\n\nSandrine Piau Recent Release: 23 January 2021; Called “Si j’ai aimé” the soprano is joined by a chamber orchestra that performs the original orchestration for fin de ciecle songs by Saint-Saëns, Bordes, Berlioz, Massenet, Dubois, Vierne, and Guilmant. Her voice is ravishing to the ear and the gentle accompaniments suit both her voice and the composers’ intentions.\n\nDebbie Kelsey Memorial: 16 January 2021; This tribute to soprano Auntie Debbie centers on the recordings of Hawaiian ballads that she made in 1991. Since she’s the mother to Quinn and Blythe, you’ll also hear them sing.\n\nAlma’s Songs/Art Songs for People Who Don’t Like Art Songs: 9 January 2021: replay of 12 January 2019. Gary’s good friend Alma McGoldrick has known him for over 35 years, loves opera, symphonic music, etc., but has never come to enjoy art songs. He assembled the songs on this program to prove to her that, deep down, she really does love art song.\n\nMystery Composer: 2 January 2021: replay of 21 October 2017. All I’ll say is that there’s a lot of beautiful music, especially art songs, written by this Russian composer.\n\n2020\n\nSibelius: 26 December 2020: replay of 9 December 2017.
