        "text": "His purpose was, he explained, to put to bed the old notion that men sing\n\n‘men’s songs’ and women sing ‘women’s song’, whatever those categories may\n\nmean. The time is ripe for change, and he wanted to encourage all singers\n\nof whatever gender to believe that the entire art song repertory was theirs\n\nto explore, perform and enjoy.\n\nIn the 19th century, repertoire gender-polarity was not a\n\nsignificant issue, but it’s true that, as Lawrence Kramer has suggested (in\n\na 2011 article, ‘Sexing Song: Brigitte Fassbaender’s Winterreise\n\n’), ‘the more professionalized the performance of art song became, the more\n\nthe rule of gender asymmetry prevailed. By the turn of the twentieth\n\ncentury it had become rigid.’ It’s generally been more common for women to\n\nadopt male personae in art song than vice versa. In 2017, Janet Wasserman\n\n(founder and executive director of the Schubert Society of the USA)\n\npublished a list of 59 female singers who had recorded Winterreise from soprano Maria Ekeblad in 1910 to mezzo-soprano\n\nIngeborg Hischer in 2014, which includes Kirsten Flagstad, Lotte Lehmann,\n\nBarbara Hendricks, Christa Ludwig, Margaret Price, Christine Sch‰fer and\n\nothers. And, there are many more who have sung individual songs from\n\nSchubert’s song-cycle in concert and on disc.\n\nBut, if there has been no shortage of ‘courageous’ women – Alice Coote, who\n\nsang the cycle at Carnegie Hall in 2017, was thus ‘praised’ – eager to sing\n\nSchubert’s songs, and while some have been well-received, the views\n\nexpressed by Matthew Gurewitsch – who asked in the New York Times\n\nin 1990 ‘Can a Woman Do a Man’s Job In Schubert’s Winterreise?’,\n\nand judged Fassbaender to have evoked ‘the adolescent hysterics of Octavian\n\ntoward the end of Der Rosenkavalier’s first act’, were not\n\natypical.\n\nWilliams would profoundly disagree with Gurewitsch’s conclusions: ‘At any\n\nrate, however astutely or partially Mozart, Goethe, Mendelssohn, Chamisso,\n\nSchumann and Loewe have penetrated the feminine psyche, no man would dream\n\nof presenting their insights in public, any more than they would\n\nimpersonate the coy nymph of Debussy’s Arcadian Chansons de Bilitis.’ You just have to empathise with the\n\nprotagonist’s feelings and experiences, and be able to communicate them in\n\nsong, argued Williams – words not so dissimilar from Elena Gerhardt’s\n\ncomment about Winterreise, ‘You have to be haunted by\n\nthis cycle to be able to sing it.’\n\nI’m absolutely on Williams’ side on this one, but there is one obvious\n\ncounterargument that might be raised with respect to his Wigmore Hall\n\nprogramme. That is, barring one short song by Clara Schumann, the female\n\nexperiences embodied in the songs he sang are not ‘female experiences’ at\n\nall, but rather male speculations and representations of imagined – perhaps\n\ndesired? – female experiences. Whether poet or composer, these men cannot\n\nescape the prevailing ideology of Romantic subjectivity. The eight songs of\n\nSchumann’s Frauenliebe und -leben are narrated by a woman but some\n\nmight argue that is the man she loves and loses who is the actual\n\n‘protagonist’ of the cycle.\n\nOne could argue this way and that for eternity, so it’s probably best just\n\nto focus on the singing itself, and this recital offered us all the\n\npleasures and comforts that we associate with Williams’ singing: a general\n\nimpression of sincerity, thoughtfulness and care; well-considered, natural\n\ndiction; a lovely fresh vocal tone, by turns light and dark, but never\n\ninsubstantial or overly weighty; a true and innate sense of poetic phrasing\n\nand meaning. The BBC cameraman perched in the balcony enabled us to marvel\n\nat the relaxed sensitive of Joseph Middleton’s fingers as they delicately\n\narticulated accompanying textures, sought out harmonic nuances in support\n\nof semantic inflections, and inhabited an understated but telling\n\nnarratorial role throughout, but especially in the summative piano\n\npostludes, by turns restful and agitated, tragic and consoling. What I\n\nfound most striking about this performance was the flexibility of\n\nthe phrasing. The expressive freedom was sometimes quite marked but it\n\nnever felt anything other than entirely ‘right’, indicative of a mutual\n\nappreciation of the union of poetic and musical meaning, and how to\n\ncommunicate this to an audience – even one far away, peering into laptop\n\nscreens or reclining in an armchair beside a radio.\n\nWilliams began with three songs by Schubert and, in some ways, it seemed to\n\nme that he was most ‘himself’ here. Perhaps it was the dark tone which\n\n‘Gretchen am Spinnrade’, ‘Der Tod und das M‰dchen’ and the less well-known\n\n‘Die junge Nonne’ share, but the rich colours of Williams’ mid to low range\n\nwere complemented by Middleton’s plunging resonance in all three songs.\n\n‘Gretchen’ was perhaps the most overtly ‘dramatic’ song of the recital and\n\nWilliams swept us immediately and magnetically into its agonies. The\n\nvarying tempi, rubatos and fermata of ‘Der Tod’ were consummately handled,\n\nand here Williams was a chilling figure of Death, enticing and commanding\n\nthe maiden to take the hand of her ‘Friend’ and sleep in his arms.\n\nMiddleton’s energising staccato bass injected ‘Die junge Nonne’ with\n\ncompelling urgency while Williams’ taut but quiet baritone captured the\n\nprotagonist’s fear of the night, as dark as the grave. The harmonic shifts\n\nwere brilliantly shaped by Middleton, and Williams’ major-key, even,\n\nself-composed closing “Allelulia”s suggested spiritual transfiguration\n\nrather than earthly fulfilment.\n\nIn the six songs by Brahms, Williams was appropriately lighter of voice,\n\ncapturing something of the protagonist’s naivety and vulnerability. At\n\ntimes I wondered if the inevitable octave transposition of the vocal\n\ndisturbed the registral relationship of voice and piano: in ‘An die\n\nNachtigall’, for example, a woman’s voice would be cushioned within the\n\ngenerally high-lying, gentle piano rocking, whereas Williams’ baritone\n\nformed a ‘bass line melody’ in a way. I’m not sure if this matters, but it\n\ncame to mind especially in the closing episodes as Middleton’s falling\n\ncascades rippled with graceful tenderness. I loved the way Williams\n\nexpanded the breadth of his tone and emotive suggestiveness in the final\n\nstanza of ‘M‰dchenlied’ – “Die Tr‰nen rinnen/ Mir ¸bers Gesicht -/ Wof¸r\n\nsoll ich spinnen?/ Ich weiss es nicht!” (The tears go coursing/ Down my\n\ncheeks—/ What am I spinning for? I don’t know!), powerfully conveying the\n\nagony of burgeoning, not yet understood, passion and desire.\n\nIn contrast, ‘Das M‰dchen spricht’ pushed forwards with impetuousness and\n\ncuriosity – and with subtle temporal nuances, a certain wryness – as the\n\nyoung girl questions the swallow about its marriage plans! Middleton’s\n\ndancing dotted rhythms were light as air and one could imagine the girl\n\ntossing of her tresses with the staccato snap of the final terse cadence. I\n\ndon’t think I’ve heard ‘Salamander’ before, and though it was brief it made\n\na mark, in no small part due to the perspicacity of Williams’ exploitation\n\nof the text but also the piano’s concluding tumult. The contrast between\n\nthe chirpy song of the insouciant nightingale at the start of ‘Nachtigall’\n\nand the slightly ‘spiky’ melodic and rhythmic disintegration of the bird’s\n\nsong at the minor-key close, as the protagonist urges the nightingale to\n\ncease tormenting them with ‘love-kindled songs’ – “Fleuch, Nachtigall, in\n\ngr¸ne Finsternisse,/ Ins Haingestr‰uch,/ Und spend’ im Nest der treuen\n\nGattin K¸sse;/ Entfleuch, entfleuch!” (Fly, nightingale, to the green\n\ndarkness,/ To the bushes of the grove,/ And there in the nest kiss your\n\nfaithful mate;/ Fly away, fly away!) – was wonderful. One could surely hear\n\nin Middleton’s playing in this song the Brahms of the late piano\n\nintermezzos.\n\nClara Schumann’s ‘Liebst du um Schˆnheit’, though flowing and sweet was\n\nslightly lost, embedded as it was within these Brahms songs. Perhaps if\n\nWilliams had really wanted to take some risks, he would have included all\n\nof Clara’s contributions to this Op.12 set? But, Clara’s was the prevailing\n\nspirit in the recital’s main work, Schumann’s Frauenliebe und -leben. This really was stunning singing and\n\nplaying. If the martial spirit of ‘Er, der Herrlichste von allen’ always\n\nleaves me feeling a little uncomfortable at Schumann’s self-representation,\n\nas he manipulates the beloved’s thoughts and feelings to accord with his\n\nRomantic sense of ‘self’, then Middleton’s brilliantly shaped and defined\n\nbass line, never heavy, always singing, balanced the books in that song!\n\nTrue partnership characterised ‘Ich kann’s nicht fassen, nicht glauben,\n\nwhich needs to be simultaneously fast and precise, without heaviness, and\n\nwas – with the added expressivity of some well-considered ebbs and flows of\n\nthe tempo.\n\n‘Du Ring an meinem Finger’ is one of my all-time favourite songs – nothing\n\nto do with the sentiments and everything to do with memories of playing\n\nthrough Schumann’s songs as a student in order to understand harmonic\n\nstructure, nuance and meaning – and the duo did not disappoint, conjuring a\n\nmood of peace and solemnity. The bright energy of ‘Helft mir, ihr\n\nSchwestern’ conveyed the bride-to-be’s impatience and joy; in the closing\n\nstanza she takes leave of her ‘sisters’ with both sadness and joy, and\n\nMiddleton’s beautifully placed cadence, closing on a first-inversion chord,\n\nwonderfully both confirmed her happiness and suggested her movement\n\nforwards into a new life. After the almost delirious rapture of ‘An meinem\n\nHerzen, an meiner Brust’, Wiliams’ baritone was firm but intense in the\n\nfinal song of the cycle, ‘Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan’.\n\nMiddleton wrought every drop of harmonic inference from Schumann’s\n\ntwisting, shifting colours, before the final piano postlude reminded us,\n\nwith bittersweet beauty, of that innocent love, now lost, forever, along\n\nwith life itself: “Ich zieh mich in mein Innres still zur¸ck,/ Der Schleier\n\nf‰llt,/ Da hab ich dich und mein verlornes Gl¸ck,/ Du meine Welt!”\n\n(Silently I withdraw into myself,/ The veil falls,/ There I have you and my\n\nlost happiness,/ You, my world!)\n\nThe first performance of Frauenliebe und -leben was given by\n\nbaritone Julius Stockhausen, and, further suggesting that he, and perhaps\n\nhis contemporaries, had no notion of a gender-dichotomy in art song, in\n\n1873 one of his pupils, Johanna Schwartz, sang songs from Winterreise in a recital that Stockhausen had organised for his\n\nstudents. Recalling his own student days, Williams described having learned\n\nBrahms’ ‘Sapphische Ode’, which was loved and recommended by one of his\n\nfirst teachers. It was the song that ‘kicked the whole thing off’,\n\nhe explained: having submitted Brahms’ song as part of a competition\n\nprogramme, he was told that he could not perform it. Why? It was a ‘woman’s\n\nsong’. He dedicated his encore to his first two teachers, Valerie Heath\n\nDavis and Janet Edmunds.\n\nClaire Seymour\n\nThis recital is available to view at:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtU4lsVcHas\n\nThe series continues for two more weeks, until 26th June.\n\nFor further information and to view previous concerts in the series\n\nclick\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nRoderick Williams (baritone), Joseph Middleton (piano)\n\nFranz Schubert – ‘Gretchen am Spinnrade’ D118, ‘Der Tod und das M‰dchen’\n\nD531, Die junge Nonne’ D828; Johannes Brahms – Vier Lieder Op.46\n\nNo.4 ‘An die Nachtigall’, F¸nf Lieder Op.107 No.5 ‘M‰dchenlied’,Sieben Lieder Op.95 No.1 ‘Das M‰dchen’; Clara Schumann –3 Songs Op.12 No.2 ‘Liebst du um Schˆnheit’; Johannes Brahms –F¸nf Lieder Op.107 No.3 ‘Das M‰dchen spricht’, No.2 ‘Salamander’,Sechs Lieder Op.97 No.1 ‘Nachtigall’; Robert Schumann – Frauenliebe und -leben Op.42.\n\nWigmore Hall, London; Friday 12th June 2020."
