No Reizen, no\n\nPirogov, no Mikhailov, no Sibiriakov, no Kastorsky. Even \"Classic\n\nCD\" should have learned about those at school!\n\nNo Heinrich Schlusnus, no Pavel Lisitsian.

Fine, they don't know Russians and French and Canadians and\n\nare not too good with Italians but what about Kim Borg and Salminen.\n\nPerhaps someone has published the name of the author of this list.\n\nI certainly would be curious to know who that genius was - and that he\n\n/she hopefully kept their day job before taking up this business of\n\nmusic-opera expert!\n\nDisgusting!\n\nIn article <Rvs83.9762$Nc.1...@nntpserver.swip.net>,\n\n\"Lars Henriksson\" <agnetha.h...@swipnet.se> wrote:\n\n> I found this list of the greatest singers of the 20th Century\n\nin \"Classic\n\n> CD\" (like the magazine, I put the names in reverse order)\n\n--\n\n<SNIPPED>\n\nVictor Han\n\nvh...@interlink.net\n\n\"Great Russian Voices\"\n\nhttp://russia.uthscsa.edu/Music/GRV/\n\nSent via Deja.com http://www.deja.com/\n\nShare what you know. Learn what you don't.\n\nI for one would choose not one of the American singers Neil mentions if\n\ncompiling a list of the 100 greatest singers of the century and I can't\n\nimagine that any serious estimate of great singing would include any of them\n\n(though dull old Morris seems to take some people in as much as the even\n\nmore mediocre-voiced Tomlinson does). There have been a great many fine and\n\neven great British singers, but that does not alter the fact that the\n\nmusical press there tends to be parochial (\"our own such-and-such\") in a way\n\nnot found in a large multinational country like the United States. Americans\n\ncan be and are parochial about many things, but opera singers do not tend to\n\nbe one of them, perhaps especially not for those who really know anything\n\nabout opera. If anything native singers have usually been treated\n\nautomatically as inferior to European imports. See the chapter on Eleanor\n\nSteber in Peter G. Davis' THE AMERICAN SINGER for a good example. Beverly\n\nSills (to whom Davis is BTW grossly unfair) is a rare counterexample,\n\nsomeone who was able to use her Americanness to boost her popularity and\n\nexposure here.\n\nI don't think even Malfitano's wildest admirers at Lyric Opera of Chicago\n\nwould pretend that she has a great Verdian instrument; go back through old\n\nissues of OPERA magazine and see the claims made for Barstow, Glossop,\n\nShuard, Fretwell, Bryn-Jones, Dennis O'Neill and the rest.\n\nThis is a magazine about CDs, right? These people are supposed to be\n\nprofessionally aware of the recorded legacy? Many of the world's great\n\nsingers unmentioned on this craven list have performed in London, and Tower\n\nRecords in Piccadilly seems well stocked with CDs of even more of them. I\n\nthink they could be reasonably be expected to know of many finer lyric\n\nsopranos than Ileana (\"Oh, but she was a Glyndebourne discovery! Her Tatiana\n\nat the Garden opposite Tom Allen and Gillian Knight lives on in the mind and\n\nheart\") Cotrubas.\n\nI think the list is unfair even to many British-based singers. I'd say\n\nHeather Harper and Joan Cross are more important historically and had better\n\nvoices than Cotrubas. And while Emma Kirkby may deserve a place in the\n\nhistory of classical music *marketing*, aren't Margaret Marshall and Lynne\n\nDawson her superiors in nearly every way?\n\nI'm sorry, but this is a brave stab only at reifying a particular set of\n\nreceived opinions; some of which will certainly please the advertising\n\nbuyers at Decca.\n\nDavid Shengold\n\n----------\n\nIn article <a1Bm4CAM...@fisher-family.demon.co.uk>, Neil Fisher\n\n\n\n>Subject: Greatest singers in Classic CD\n\n>From: \"Lars Henriksson\" <agnetha.h...@swipnet.se>\n\n>Date: Sat, 12 June 1999 08:36 AM EDT\n\n>Message-id: <Rvs83.9762$Nc.1...@nntpserver.swip.net>\n\n>\n\n>I found this list of the greatest singers of the 20th Century in \"Classic\n\n>CD\" (like the magazine, I put the names in reverse order)\n\n>\n\n>100 Nat King Cole\n\n>99 Kiri Te Kanawa\n\n>98 José Carreras\n\netc. etc.\n\nI suspect that this \"list\" is a compilation of a number of experts each picking\n\nhis/her own top twenty, say, (without ranking them) , and then counting up the\n\nvotes and assigning points. In this way a performer who made 1/3 of the top\n\ntwenty lists (but wouldn't have made the top 200 of the other experts) would\n\nscore fairly well, while a singer who only one expert picked in the top twenty,\n\nbut all of whom might have picked in the top forty, say, would score very\n\nbadly. That is very likely the reason for these ridiculous rankings.\n\nIt would be interesting to hear the mathematical basis (to use the term\n\nextremely loosely) for the rankings, Lars, if they are given in the article.\n\nThe devil is in the details, when one examines statistics.\n\nPat Finley\n\nDer Reine Tor\n\nDear Pat Finley, I haven't got the entire magazine, I only made photocopies\n\nof the pages with the list.\n\nThe mag. says that the contributors are \"two dozen\" of their leading\n\ncritics.

I think the most fatal error was not to include the basso of the\n\ncentury (here I go again...) Nicolai Ghiaurov. He deserved Chaliapin's place\n\nat number 16 (at the least).\n\nOther huge errors are the exclusions of Cappuccilli, Gruberovà and Nicola\n\nGhiuselev.\n\nI agree with you that the exclusion of Merrill was a scandal, but I don't\n\nthink the same goes for Corelli and Siepi.

Still, this is so much fun. . .\n\n.\n\nIn order of (temporary) preference from top favorite to hundredth favorite\n\n(and, yes, I do like even the ones in the bottom ten quite a bit -- it's\n\namazing how very *small* the number 100 really is!):\n\nTauber;\n\nRobeson;\n\nFerrier;\n\nLeider;\n\nLudwig\n\nSoederstroem;\n\nVickers;\n\nDe Gaetani;\n\nL.Hunt;\n\nJ.Baker\n\nSchorr;\n\nSalminen;\n\nVarady;\n\nVon Stade;\n\nDernesch;\n\nJo\n\nMuzio;\n\nCalve;\n\nPinza;\n\nTibbett;\n\nM.Anderson;\n\nVerrett;\n\nFarrell,\n\nE.Schumann;\n\nCrespin;\n\nDonath;\n\nHaefliger;\n\nLo.Lehmann;\n\nKipnis;\n\nJournet;\n\nR.Raimondi;\n\nVan Dam;\n\nRysanek;\n\nSiepi;\n\nLloyd;\n\nSchiotz;\n\nPatti;\n\nZyllis-Gara;\n\nR.Ponselle;\n\nBerini;\n\nRebroff;\n\nOlivero;\n\nStratas;\n\nSeefried;\n\nPatzak;\n\nManuguerra;\n\nCrooks\n\nPlancon;\n\nCaruso;\n\nAmato;\n\nOberlin;\n\nTourel;\n\nLemnitz;\n\nR.Hayes;\n\nSayao;\n\nCallas;\n\nSupervia;\n\nStracciari;\n\nSeinemeyer;\n\nChkonia;\n\nSembrich;\n\nJurinac;\n\nNovotna;\n\nSimionato;\n\nSchipa;\n\nSimoneau;\n\nTaddei;\n\nKonya;\n\nMilanov;\n\nWelitsch;\n\nGarden;\n\nLisitsian;\n\nFreni;\n\nDella Casa;\n\nDe Los Angeles;\n\nTeyte;\n\nThorborg;\n\nTucci;\n\nIvogun;\n\nLitvinne;\n\nBrandt;\n\nFleming;\n\nMelchior;\n\nBarbieri;\n\nTamagno;\n\nTraubel;\n\nChaliapin;\n\nBattistini;\n\nSchoene;\n\nMattila;\n\nGueden;\n\nVallin;\n\nSchumann-Heink;\n\nWlaschiha;\n\nHeppner;\n\nWunderlich;\n\nSteber;\n\nStreich;\n\nShicoff;\n\nScotto\n\nAnd even with the deep admiration I have for Scotto (at her youthful best,\n\nmind you), I find myself recalling some other names already that ought to\n\nhave been considered at least: (in no special order) Caniglia, Stignani,\n\nPasero, Cigna, Cerquetti, Stevens, Hempel, Tetrazzini, Galli-Curci, Caballe,\n\nCorelli, Di Stefano, Tucker, Ralf, Ramey, Cole, L.Price, Bergonzi, Carreras\n\n(in his youth), J.

An ecxelent soprano\n\ntoo bad she sang roles that didn't suited her. And Jose Cura; listen to him. He is a great tenor. Why didn't they\n\ninclude him. They included here Joseph Shabala ??

In case of a tie, what tilted the ranking in favor of one or\n\nanother singer? Coming from a magazine dedicated to a technology in\n\ncommercial existence for a bit over 20 years, was the ranking of those\n\nsinging only in that time frame? What factors weighed in favor of those\n\nor against those much represented by recordings, or rarely so? What\n\nconsiderations were accorded singers ill-represented in the first half\n\nof the century?\n\nPost scriptum: what halfwit dreamed up the idea of rankings, and what\n\nidiocy prompted Terry Blain, Geoffrey Crankshaw, Neil Evans, Andy\n\nHamilton, Barbara Hammond, Malcolm Hayes, Julian Haylock, Adrian Jack,\n\nMichael Jameson, Robert Layton, Erik Levi, Jeremy Nicholas, Michael\n\nOliver, Michael Quinn, Paul Riley, Michael Scott Rohan, Tom Sutcliffe,\n\nJoanne Talbot, Michael Tanner, Simon Trezise, Jonathan Webster, Terry\n\nWilliams and Barry Witherden to take part in and have their names\n\nassociated with such a garbage-driven enterprise?\n\n\"why am i taking on like this? my kid ain't even been born yet?\"\n\n--o. hammerstein II, \"Carousel\"\n\ndft\n\nDear Gail-- \"What about our own Frank Sale, Walter Midgely, Edgar Evans and\n\nTom Swift???\"\n\nBut seriously: if you can bear to keep yourself from those James Morris CDs\n\nfor a day or two, do investigate the recordings (esp.
