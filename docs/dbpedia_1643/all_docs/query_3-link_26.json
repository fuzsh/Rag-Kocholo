        "text": "A cautiously worded paragraph of justification in the program notes for Deutsche Grammophon's new ''Winterreise'' recording (423 366-2) reminds us that in recent decades it has been considered unusual or inappropriate for a female singer to perform this work. Christa Ludwig is not the first woman to record Schubert's great cycle in the postwar era, but she is certainly the most celebrated, and hers is the first to be issued on a major label. For most of the four decades spanned by her career, the general view has been that women should sing lieder whose ''ich'' is either indeterminable or feminine.\n\nThis writer once heard the composer and accompanist Hermann Reutter recall his disputes with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf over the issue. Like many of her predecessors, she often programmed songs written from a masculine point of view. Reutter objected: ''Elisabeth,'' he would insist, ''you are not a man.'' That is unarguably true, but (to borrow a line from Churchill) not exhaustive.\n\nThe fact is that for most of the history of song - and of opera, for that matter - it has been acceptable for a woman to portray the feelings of a man. Jenny Lind, over a century ago, did much to further appreciation for ''Die Schone Mullerin'' (a cycle whose protagonist is not the titular miller-maid but the young apprentice who loves her). Sopranos and mezzo-sopranos sang heroic roles in Italian opera long after the castrati vanished from the stage.\n\nThis century's most celebrated public performances of ''Winterreise'' before the appearance of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau were probably those of Elena Gerhardt in England and Lotte Lehmann in the United States. Lehmann was still singing the cycle when Christa Ludwig's career began in 1946; like Miss Schwarzkopf, she stands firmly within tradition.\n\nIt is quite possible to mount a critique of that tradition along lines that feminism has made familiar. The converse procedure - men portraying women in song or on stage - has generally been acceptable only in parody (like Feodor Chaliapin's hilarious peasant girl in ''Down the Petersky'' or Hugues Cuenod's aging nymphs in Baroque opera). In the 19th century, men did perform ''female'' lieder more than they do now, but it would always have been thought repulsive - and I don't sense a change in the air - for a man to interpret Schumann's dramatically explicit ''Frauenliebe und -leben'' cycle. This double standard echoes all the other ways in which history and society suggest that while women may aspire to manliness, men are shamed and degraded by womanliness.\n\nBut a different double standard argues, pragmatically rather than abstractly, for Miss Ludwig's revival of tradition. Female classical singers are working with a repertory overwhelmingly drawn from times when only men were allowed the professional life of composing. Male points of view predominate in lieder; female ones are filtered through the sensibility (sometimes condescending) of the men who wrote the music and, usually, the words.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
