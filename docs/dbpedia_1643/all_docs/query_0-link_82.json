        "text": "Irish peace organisation Afri has joined with the Choctaw people – renowned for their respect and reverence for the planet – to call on artists everywhere to raise awareness and inspire urgent action on global warming ahead of the December climate change conference in Paris.\n\nThe effects of global warming are increasingly clear: ecosystems are being lost at an alarming rate; species extinction is occurring on an unprecedented scale and communities, especially those who are already suffering, face decimation and displacement. Unless we make radical changes, things are going to get a lot worse.\n\nBut resistance is also on the rise. In 2014, a coalition of native Alaskan tribes, backed by green campaigners, won a court victory against Shell’s drilling for oil in the Arctic. Indigenous groups in the Amazon have been holding back plans to cut down more forests to facilitate oil exploration.\n\nThese artists have already pledged to act. Will you? Damien Dempsey, Liam Ó’Maonlaí, Steve Wall (The Walls/The Stunning), Colm Mac Con Iomaire (The Frames), Dónal O’Kelly, Noirín Ní Riain, Theo Dorgan, Paula Meehan and more. Full list below and more to be announced soon. Are you an artist? Add your name to the list of supporters here.\n\nJoin Neil Young, Pharrell Williams and others\n\nArtists are helping lead the change. Neil Young launched a Canadian tour in 2014 under the title ‘Honour the Treaties’, backing the struggle of Canada’s indigenous nations against environmentally destructive tar sands extraction. Pharrell Williams recently announced a series of Live Earth Concerts around the globe on June 18th of this year.\n\nIn Ireland, renowned violinist Colm Mac Con Iomaire of The Frames (and ex Swell Season and Kila) will soon launch his new solo album ‘and now the weather’ which takes in the theme of our relationship with the planet. What we need now is a constant, continuous and multi-dimensional effort from now until the Paris Summit in December 2015 and beyond.\n\nWe are calling on artists, musicians, poets, painters, writers, crafts people, designers, dancers and all creative souls everywhere to use their creative genius to awaken the super-power of world opinion. Imagine the impact, if artists and those who love art, those who love Earth were to rise up and make their voices heard with one clear message: Stop killing our planet… save our world.\n\nPlease join our call by creating art that helps awaken, activate and inspire. Share your creations with your friends, fans and followers and be part of a movement of movements that is determined to forge a new world for our children and grandchildren.\n\nJoe Murray, Afri – Action From Ireland (Patron, Archbishop Desmond Tutu)\n\nGary White Deer, Choctaw artist\n\nThe teachings of all First Nations tell us that all people share a common Mother Earth,\n\nwho takes care of us and we are born knowing this.

But this isn’t a wedding or a festival. The residents of this drought-stricken village are celebrating nightfall, because it means they can finally emerge from the shelters that have been protecting them from the extreme heat of the day and carry on with their lives.\n\n“The ‘day’ has started and people are out of their hideouts ready to attend to their daily chores,” says community elder Abdi Abey. “Don’t mistake the celebration for a traditional festival. It’s a celebration of the changing weather.”\n\nOver the past decade, Atheley and other villages in northern Kenya have suffered through a series of every-worsening droughts that have made normal life increasingly difficult. This year, for the first time, temperatures hitting over 40 degrees Celsius during the day have made farming, schooling, healthcare and other daily activities a struggle. Continue reading “Northern Kenyans adopt nocturnal life to escape extreme heat” →\n\nPress Release\n\nStop Climate Chaos, a coalition of environmental, development and faith-based organisations, has today said the Government is operating double standards when it comes to the draft climate legislation. The Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, tasked with consulting and reporting on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill before it goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, is failing to provide stakeholders and the public with an inclusive and transparent process.\n\nStop Climate Chaos, as well as some members of the Committee, has been calling for the publication of the submissions received by the Committee at the end of April, a request that has been flatly rejected by the Chair of the Committee. With the hearings due to be held in two weeks time, there is no indication of who will be invited to present to the Committee or what their proposals are. Continue reading “Stakeholders accuse the Government of double standards on the Climate Bill” →\n\nFriends of the Earth Press Release\n\nFriends of the Earth today launched an analysis of what stakeholders think are the key elements of effective climate legislation. Last week the Government delayed the publication of its draft climate Bill by two weeks. The environmental justice organisation launched its “Six Tests for the Government’s Climate Change Bill” to coincide with a briefing for TDs in Leinster House on the threat of climate change locally and globally.\n\nSpeaking before the event, Friends of the Earth Director, Oisin Coghlan said:\n\n“The Government seems unsure of the merits of its own Bill and has delayed publication. In the interests of clarity and fairness we’re laying out today the six things stakeholders have identified as essential to an effective climate law”\n\n“Many of them appear in the Labour Party Bill from 2009 and the All-party Bill from 2010. They have the backing not only of environmental organisations but many overseas aid agencies and the Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change”.\n\nThe six tests and who supports them are as follows:\n\n1. Is there a 2050 target? Is it 80%?\n\nSupported by:\n\nFriends of the Earth Stop Climate Chaos Environmental Pillar Irish Corporate Leaders on Climate Change Labour Party Bill 2009 All-Party Bill 2010 FF/Green Bill 2010\n\n2. Are there interim targets? Are they “Carbon Budgets”?\n\nSupported by:\n\nFriends of the Earth Stop Climate Chaos Environmental Pillar Corporate Leaders\n\nLabour Party Bill All-Party Bill\n\n3. Is there an independent expert advisory council?\n\nSupported by:\n\nFriends of the Earth Stop Climate Chaos Environmental Pillar Corporate Leaders\n\nLabour Party Bill All-Party Bill FF/Green Bill\n\n4. Does the Bill place overall responsibility for climate policy on the Taoiseach? (Or move climate from the Dept of Env. to Dept of Energy?)\n\nSupported by:\n\nLabour Party Bill Corporate Leaders All-Party Bill Friends of the Earth\n\n5. Does the Bill provide for a limit on the use of carbon credits (offsets)?\n\nSupported by:\n\nFriends of the Earth Stop Climate Chaos Environmental Pillar Corporate Leaders\n\nLabour Party Bill All-Party Bill FF/Green Bill\n\n6. Does the Bill cover emissions from the whole economy (including ETS)?\n\nThe proposal that the 2050 target cover the whole economy is supported by:\n\nFriends of the Earth Stop Climate Chaos Environmental Pillar Corporate Leaders\n\nLabour Party Bill All-Party Bill FF/Green Bill\n\nThat this should also apply to interim targets is emphasised by\n\nFriends of the Earth Environmental Pillar FF/Green Bill\n\nNotes\n\n1.

The briefing is being hosted by Brian Stanley TD, Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on the Environment.\n\n3. The Irish Corporate Leaders Communiqué on climate legislation can be downloaded here."
