        "text": "NAMARA, MARGUERITE\n\nBUZZI-PECCIA: Morenita (self-accompanied on castanets). MARTINI: Plaisir d’amour (duet with her mother, mezzo-soprano Margaret Banks). DELIBES: Lakmé: Sous le dome épais (same) Mischa Levitzki, pianist. DE FALLA: El pano meruno. Seguidilla murciana. IBERIAN FOLK SONGS: Copla de Colúmpio. Soléa. Sévillañas. Granadinas. Galician Street Cry “Alálá.” Malagueña. BIZET: Carmen: Près de remparts de Seville / Marguerite Namara, soprano/pianist (all tracks from De Falla on) / available for free streaming on Internet Archive.\n\nThere were several famous American sopranos in the early 20th century, but none more glamorous or more eccentric than Marguerite Evelyn Banks who renamed herself “Namara” after her mother’s maiden name, McNamara. She made a sensational debut in 1908, then sang at the Paris, Chicago and Metropolitan Opera houses for the next two decades. Stunningly beautiful with shiny black hair and bright blue eyes, she “got around” as they say in between her three marriages. And was friends with everyone, including Claude Monet, Enrico Caruso, Charlie Chaplin, Isadora Duncan, Albert Schweitzer, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Rudolph Valentino, with whom she made the silent film Stolen Moments in 1920. Despite his being gay, she developed a crush on him that was not returned, and after his death she held séances in which she tried to contact his spirit. When she and her husband moved to California, she lived in a mansion where she raised cockatoos and monkeys in addition to entertaining gentleman callers with her singing, accompanying herself at the piano or spinet (the latter built for her by Arnold Dolmetsch). Again, despite still being married, in the early 1950s she developed a crush on director Leonard Stillman. There exists a photo of Namara and a pretty young ballerina, Peggy Lou Neary, crying their eye out, the first because she was too old for Stillman and the second because she was too young. In 1931 she made the first sound film based on Carmen, Gipsy Blood, which remains a classic to this day, and although I’ve never heard it, she made her last recording in 1968 at the age of 80!\n\nAstonishingly, she made very few recordings, her most famous being a small collection of songs and arias in 1953-55 for William Seltsam’s IRCC label, none of which, alas, I currently own. The recordings listed above were made between 1918 and 1953, most of them for small labels, but despite the eccentricities in her delivery she was still an amazingly vital and exciting performer, and her voice remained in surprisingly good voice despite her age. Truly one of a kind!\n\nNEVEU, GINETTE\n\nSTRAUSS: Violin Sonata in Eb. TARTINI: Variations on a Theme of Corelli (both w/Gustav Beck, pno).

American violinist Guila Bustabo was every bit as dynamic and exciting as French violinist Ginette Neveu, but her “hypnotic” eyes in performance and her early death in a plane crash made the latter a legend and the former forgotten. Nonetheless, she was a very intense interpreter. This CD is the best compilation of her non-orchestral recordings.\n\nNEWELL, LAURA\n\nCASELLA: Sonata per arpa: I. Allegro vivace; II.

Newell’s failing was that she didn’t pursue a career as a solo star harpist; she was just the finest all-around musician on her instrument of her day, which was the 1940s and ‘50s, and this recording proves it.\n\nNEW YORK PRO MUSICA (ANTIQUA)\n\nAlso see under composers: Banchieri, Monteverdi, Rossi.\n\nDUFAY: Kyrie Eleison.

Well, here it is…the New York Pro Musica, sometimes with Antiqua at the end of its name and sometimes with The Primavera Singers at the beginning. This legendary ensemble, created and conducted by one of the strangest men ever to enter the early music scene—Noah Greenberg had been a Merchant Marine, a longshoreman and a Communist cell block leader, but never a musician until he suddenly fell in love with this music—and two of the finest voices ever to sing this repertoire, the TRUE countertenor Russell Oberlin and the (very) high tenor Charles Bressler. Other long-standing members of the group were soprano Jean Hakes and bass Brayton Lewis, who didn’t have a lot of voice but plenty of heart. Some of the earliest recordings, alas, have been “reprocessed” with “electronically enhanced stereo,” which in those says simply meant a ton of reverb which somewhat obscures the fine singing, but no major label has ever shown an interest in remastering and re-releasing these treasures. (Also see Oberlin, Russell under Collections – O.)\n\nNEW YORK WOODWIND QUINTET\n\nFRANÇAIX: Quintet for Winds. TAFFANEL: Quintet for Winds / New York Woodwind Quintet: Samuel Baron, flautist; Jerome Roth, oboist; David Glazer, clarinetist; Arthur Weisberg, bassoonist; John Barrows, French hornist / available for free streaming on Internet Archive\n\nIt’s not so much that there have never been any wind quintets since them that could play better—there are—so much as that this legendary group set incredibly high standards for both technique and musicality at a time when there weren’t any other woodwind quintets that could equal them, let along surpass them. And this is the album that was considered their very finest.\n\nNEZHDANOVA, ANTONINA\n\nGLINKA: A Life for the Czar: No, that is not my sorrow. RUBINSTEIN: The Demon: Warm night.

TYROLEAN FOLK SONG: Musetta / electrical recordings, 1937-41 w/Nikolai Golavanov, pianist / Antonina Nezhdanova, soprano / available for free streaming on Internet Archive\n\nOf the four most famous opera singers born in 1873—Nezhdanova, Enrico Caruso, Leo Slezak and Feodor Chaliapin—Nezhdanova was the longest-lived as well as having the longest career, giving her last performance in 1943 and surviving to the age of 77. She was also the least known in America and Western Europe; aside from a couple of appearances in Germany and one famous 1912 performance of Rigoletto at the Paris Opéra with Caruso and Titta Ruffo, she confined her singing to Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia, thus she really only became famous in the West through her recordings. But what recordings! Her voice was so full of overtones that even with the restrictive frequency range of acoustic recordings, one could hear it ring out and reverberate as if they were made with a microphone. She was not a dramatic interpreter, either of opera or lieder, but she was a very conscientious musician and an even better vocalist who spent hours trying to get exactly the right vocal color and timbre on each note. These recordings, divided between her acoustic and electrics (made in the Soviet Union with poor equipment ad pressed on inferior shellac), prove how well her voice held up through a career lasting nearly 45 years.\n\nNIELSEN, VLADIMIR\n\nSCHUMANN: Waldszenen.

CHOPIN: Piano Sonata No. 3, Op. 58: I. Allegro maestoso; II. Scherzo: Molto vivace; III. Largo; IV. Finale: Presto non tanto. SCHUBERT: Moments musicaux No. 4. Impromptu, D. 899 No. 2 / Vladimir Nielsen, pianist / available for free streaming on YouTube (live: Leningrad, Dec. 20, 1957)\n\nIn the pantheon of great Russian/Soviet pianists, Vladimir Nielsen (1910-1998) got the rawest deal. Considered to be the “poet of the piano,” he had a much larger reputation in his native country than did Emil Gilels, whose career flowered outside the Soviet Union. Aside from ONE commercial recording of works by Mozart and Schubert, all that exists of him are these live concert performances and, to be honest, his playing is a little bit scrappy in the live performance of the Schubert sonata. But this is all we have. Ironically, the Soviets loved him so much that they only let him tour in Eastern bloc countries. and then for only two years (1957-59).\n\nThese live recordings go a long way to explaining what all the fuss was about. Nielsen combined the delicate tracery and floating sound of a Paderewski with a Russian sense of musical structure. He also possessed a musical sensibility that allowed him to create entirely new vistas in overly-familiar works. Nielsen takes you to another realm. Despite the limited radio broadcast sound, no one has ever played Schumann’s Waldszenen,r Ravel’s Gaspard de la Nuit as well as he did, and he even makes the over-exposed Chopin Sonata No. 3 sound magical. He was sort of a reverse mirror-image of Dinu Lipatti, but so meticulous and serious in his approach that it was clearly valid.\n\nSometimes fate decides who becomes a legend and who doesn’t. American violinist Guila Bustabo was every bit as dynamic and exciting as French violinist Ginette Neveu, but her “hypnotic” eyes in performance and her early death in a plane crash made the latter a legend and the former forgotten. Nonetheless, she was a very intense interpreter. This CD is the best compilation of her non-orchestral recordings.\n\nNIKISCH, ARTHUR\n\nBRAHMS: Hungarian Dance No. 6 / Arthur Nikisch, pianist (Welte piano roll) / MOZART: Le nozze di Figaro: Overture. LISZT: Hungarian Rhapsody No. 1 / London Symphony Orch. / BEETHOVEN: Egmont Overture. Symphony No. 5: Mvt I; Mvt II; Mvt III; Mvt IV. BERLIOZ: Roman Carnival Overture / Berlin Philharmonic Orch.; Arthur Nikisch, conductor . available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking links above\n\nI rarely, if ever, recommend acoustic orchestral recordings because of their extremely limited sound, but I had to make an exception for Arthur Nikisch because 1) he was universally acknowledged as the greatest conductor of his time (even such polar opposites as Furtwängler and Toscanini admired him!), and 2) it’s the only way he recorded since he died in 1922. You may have to clean up these recordings and add just a touch of reverb to make them listenable—Nikisch recorded for Polydor, which had (along with Odeon) the boxiest sound of all the acoustic classical labels—but they ARE worth having. Brilliant musical conceptions, artfully realized. (FYI: Nikisch was also the teacher of conductors Albert Coates and Adrian Boult, among others.)\n\nNU:BC COLLECTIVE, THE\n\nCHANG: Beyond Shadows.

What a shame that recordings like this are the exception and not the rule.\n\nMACKENZIE, HARRIET\n\n21st CENTURY VIOLIN CONCERTOS / PATTERSON: Allusions for 2 Solo Violins & Strings.* D.

FOKKENS: An Eventful Morning Near East London.# DOOLITTLE: falling still for Violin & Strings / Harriet Mackenzie, *Philippa Mo, violinists; English String Orchestra, #English Symphony Orch.; Kenneth Woods, conductor / Nimbus Alliance NI 6295\n\nWhat’s that you say? You’ve never heard of violinist Harriet Mackenzie? Well, of course not…because she specializes in modern repertoire, thus she is a pariah in the classical world. But she is a superb artist, and this CD contains some truly fascinating music.\n\nMARLOWE, SYLVIA\n\nMedley: MOZART: Variations on a Folk Theme, “Ah, vous dirai-je, maman”/MARLOWE: Marlowe’s Boogie Woogie.

BERGER: Intermezzo. Bagatelle / Sylvia Marlowe, harpsichordist *with Claude Monteux, flautist; Harry Shulman, oboist; Bernard Greenhouse, cellist / available for free streaming on YouTube\n\nSylvia Sapira, who performed under the name Sylvia Marlowe (1908-1981), was one of the most important harpsichordists of the 20th century and, after Wanda Landowska, who inspired her, one of the first on the scene. But there was even more to this remarkable woman. Between 1939 and 1945, she played—and recorded—jazz pieces (mostly boogie-woogie) and jazz arrangements of classical works, making her one of the first harpsichordists to play such music. Nor was this meant as a publicity stunt; Marlowe remained a staunch champion of American composers as well as contemporary European composers, founding the Harpsichord Music Society in 1957 to promote new works for her instrument and to award scholarships for the advanced study of the harpsichord and its repertoire. There was scarcely anything she could not do, but her highly diverse repertoire made her somewhat unpopular in the classical world, which looked down their noses at her playing boogie-woogie and pretty much ignored the modern works she commissioned. By the time she died in 1981, she was virtually forgotten by the establishment in favor of such players as Gustav Leonhardt, Igor Kipnis and Trevor Pinnock, who stuck to the Baroque repertoire—proving once again that the formal classical world is an inbred bunch of snobs who don’t want to rock the boat with anything resembling innovative repertoire if they can help it. These two collections, however, will give you a superb overview of just how good she was in addition to preserving some of the very few recordings made by one of the greatest flautists of the 20th century, Claude Monteux.\n\nMARQUEZ, SILVIA\n\nMARCO: Herbania.

SÁNCHEZ-VERDÚ: Palimpsestes / Silvia Marquez, harpsichordist / IBS Classical 122019\n\nSo you’ve never heard of Silvia Marquez either? I’m shocked. Really truly shocked. Again, what do you expect when you won’t toe the line and play the old-timey stuff over and over and over again? But she’s a lively, energetic interpreter, and most of these are superb pieces.\n\nMARSH, LUCY ISABELLE\n\nSTERN: Printemps (rec. 2-23-1911). DELL’ACQUA: Chanson Provençale (rec. 11-7-1912).

HERBERT: Naughty Marietta: Italian Street Song (rec. 10-31-1927) / Lucy Isabelle Marsh, soprano; available for free streaming on the Internet Archive.\n\nBy nature somewhat shy and not very attractive, soprano Lucy Isabelle Marsh nonetheless had a perfect soprano voice and recorded very well for that era, which made her a valuable asset to Victor Records, who signed her to a long-term contract as a studio singer in 1909, continuing to use her on records both under her own name, as “Anna Howard,” and as a member of the Victor Opera and Light Opera Companies (not to mention the Trinity Choir) until 1932. She wasn’t a dramatic artist, although her 1911 recording of the Rossini “Inflammatus” is quite exciting, but she had the basic requirements of those days: “Voice, voice, and more voice.” Her repertoire, as this selection shows, was also quite wide, ranging from such 18th-century composers as Cesti and Pergolesi through Verdi’s Aida, all of it sung exquisitely.\n\nMARSHALL, MARGARET\n\nPURCELL: The Blessed Virgin’s Expostulation: Tell me, some pitying angel.

His early career at the Metropolitan Opera was concurrent with Enrico Caruso’s last years; by the time he left in 1946, two generations of opera singers had come and gone. The voice was exceptionally bright with no real “bottom” to the sound, and records never fully captured its quality, but his electrical recordings of the late 1920s are considered his very best. This collection includes three real rarities: the soundtrack for a Vitaphone short as Elezear in La Juive, a 1929 broadcast of the love duet from Otello with the legendary soprano Claudia Muzio, and excerpts from a 1941 broadcast of Pagliacci.\n\nMATHIS, EDITH\n\nMOZART: Das Veilchen.

He had discursive tastes and thus flitted about from Irish songs to German lieder, French chansons and popular songs of the day in addition to his more famous repertoire. He made classics of “Il mio tesoro,” “O sleep, why dost thou leave me?” and “I Hear You Calling Me,” recorded numerous songs and arias with violinist Fritz Kreisler, and always communicated. He was, in fact, the first crossover artist in classical history, and although his voice thinned out in quality by the mid-1930s his ability to sing as if he were telling a story remained intact.\n\nMEHTA, BEJUN\n\nHANDEL: Messiah: If God be for us; How beautiful are the feet.

Ask any truly knowledgeable professional, and they’ll tell you flat out: Rafael Mendez was the world’s greatest trumpet player, hands down. So why isn’t he better known? 1) He was a Mexican immigrant, 2) he played a LOT of pop music (although he could also play jazz), and 3) his career came at a time when even a fabulous virtuoso such as he was had to make a living as an entertainer first and foremost. But if you can find me ANY other trumpet who could knock off these pieces, Flight of the Bumble Bee or the Haydn Trumpet Concerto with his combination of great tone, utterly flawless technique and brio, drop me a line. I’d like to hear him or her. Mendez was, quite simply, the greatest classical trumpet player in the world.\n\nMENGELBERG, WILLEM\n\nSTRAUSS: Ein Heldenleben. BERLIOZ: Roman Carnival Overture.

Amsterdam / BEETHOVEN: Egmont Overture / New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orch. / Willem Mengelberg, conductor / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking titles above.\n\nDespite a hardy minority of collectors who admire him and keep his name alive, Willem Mengelberg’s stock has pretty much tanked as a musician, which is a pity. Although his performances sometimes lacked technical polish, he was an intense and interesting interpreter of the older classics. There are those who consider his 1928 New York Philharmonic recording of Strauss’ Ein Heldenleben to be the ultimate performance, but I think that is only because the New York musicians played with greater polish and precision; as an interpretation, this 1941 performance with his own Concertgebouw Orchestra simply cannot be beat. Neither can his 1929 recording of Liszt’s Les Preludes, a performance so intense that it still astounds listeners.\n\nMengelberg’s personality flaws were similar to those of his German rival Wilhelm Furtwängler: an overweening ego, the belief that he was the greatest conductor in the world, and an extremely naïve view of politics, but whereas Furtwängler merely kept conducting in Germany and was never a member of the Nazi Party, Mengelberg embraced the Nazis wholeheartedly when they invaded Holland. He not only became a party member but toasted the German invasion with a glass of champagne. He paid a heavy price for this after the war, being banned from conducting in the Netherlands for six years. He died in 1951, a few months before the ban would have been lifted. Yet the recordings listed above are all outstanding and show what a great interpreter he could be.\n\nAmerican violinist Guila Bustabo, who performs the Bruch Violin Concerto with him here, also performed heavily in Nazi-occupied countries both before and during World War II, but this wasn’t her choice. It was a decision that her mother made to promote her name at all costs, which eventually led to her having a nervous breakdown and playing in the violin sections of minor American orchestras after the war. This was a pity, however, as she was politically blameless as well as one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century, an interpreter on the level of intensity of Ginette Neveu.\n\nMELI, FRANCESCO\n\nBRITTEN: 7 Sonnets of Michelangelo.

Like her brother Yehudi, Hephzibah was born in America, but unlike him she spent most of her life in the U.S.A. with periods in Australia. She gave her first recital at age eight, then studied with Rudolf Serkin, but as time went on her public performances become sporadic. Yet she and her brother had a kinetic relationship when they played together; it was almost like two brains thinking as one, which made her an ideal partner for him. Although their most prolific period together was from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, she continued to play with Yehudi into the 1970s. Her early death in 1981 at the age of 60 robbed him of a very valuable musical partner. As a result of their unusually sympathetic communication, I feel that their recordings together are the high water mark of Yehudi’s career.\n\nMERDINGER, SUSAN\n\nAMERICAN MELTING POT / M.

In addition, Merola has somehow managed to combine his love of jazz improvisation with both Italian folk rhythms and a feeling of Klezmer music, which of course informed a great many of the early jazz clarinetists. And despite its being based on jazz, the pieces on this album are fairly complex, demanding one’s attention.\n\nMEYER, MARCELLE\n\nCHABRIER: Habanera. Bourée fantasque.

She played in the then-accepted French style of straightforward readings of the scores with only what interpretation was given in them, but there is still a hypnotic quality about her recordings that no one else has ever captured. Highly recommended.\n\nMIT WIND ENSEMBLE/FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA\n\nG. KLEIN: Solar Return Suite. COREA: From Forever.* D.

These recordings, though sometimes deficient in sound quality, make up for that in terms of superb orchestral balance and outstanding musical style.

Maria Callas was undoubtedly the most famous because she sang the old-timey Italian repertoire that most people wallow in, but there were also Inge Borkh, Astrid Varnay, Res Fischer and the one most highly prized of all, Martha Mödl. Mödl amazingly worked as a bookkeeper until she was 28 years old, then studied voice for two years and made her debut in 1942 as Hansel in Humperdinck’s Hansel und Gretel. She gave a few other performances as Cherubino, Mignon and Azucena, but then retreated from performing until the war was over and the Nazis were gone. After the war she resumed her career, singing such mezzo soles as Dorabella, Octavian, Eboli, Carmen, Klytemnestra and Venus in Tannhäuser. Wieland Wagner was highly impressed by the latter and invited her to come to Bayreuth, where she sang for about a decade in both mezzo-soprano (Kundry) and soprano roles (Sieglinde, Isolde, and all three Brünnhildes). Mödl told interviewer Bruce Duffie that her switch to the soprano repertoire wasn’t all that difficult for her because she was “a very high mezzo,” but the high Cs in the roles of Isolde and Brünnhilde eventually took their toll, and by 1961 she had to abandon the soprano repertoire completely.\n\nBut Martha was a real “stage animal” and didn’t care. As long as she could sing roles that called for outstanding vocal and stage acting, she was there, no matter who the composer or how difficult the music was, thus she was able to keep on going well into her early 80s, and when she couldn’t sing any more, she did speaking roles. This album captures her in live situations, where she gave her best, and goes a long way to explaining the furor over her for more than 40 years.\n\nMOISAN, ANDRÉ\n\nKOVACS: After You, Mr. Gershwin!

Yet there is something unusual and riveting about these records. You don’t feel so much that you’re listening to a singer on a record so much as you feel that you’re hearing a great artist “live,” interpreting this music in a way that no one until Maria Callas came along was ever able to duplicate. In fact, if you make a direct A-B comparison between Muzio’s performances of the arias from La Sonambula and Norma with Callas’, you may very well find yourself preferring Muzio despite her breath control issues and the lack of a trill. I suppose the best way to compare the two is that Callas sang her characters theatrically and dramatically while Muzio sang hers as if the emotion was coming from somewhere deep inside her. Only the limited sound quality keeps me from giving these recordings a six-fish rating.\n\nMYSZ-GMEINER, LULA\n\nSCHUBERT: Der Tod und das Mädchen. Die Forelle. Der Einsame. Frülingsglaube. Erlkönig.

Although she sang for decades, she made all her records in the 1920s for Polydor, both acoustically and electrically, with a few songs recorded in both formats, but there doesn’t seem to be a lot of them, perhaps 26 or 28 titles in all. The selection above is, I think, the best representation of her work.\n\nMYTHOS TRIO\n\nMARGOLA: Piano Trio. GHEDINI: 2 Intermezzi.

But no one really took her place; her interpretive skills were nearly the equal of Callas’ in the generally insipid Bel Canto repertoire, and she sang a fairly wide range of tonal operas from Monteverdi to Strauss. But if you think Larmore got a raw deal, consider her soprano partner on this CD, Hei-Kyung Hong, who sang at the Metropolitan Opera for at least a decade but got very few Saturday broadcasts—and this is her only commercial recording.\n\nLÁSZLÓ, MAGDA\n\nA.

MEYERBEER: Robert le Diable: Robert, Robert mein Geliebter. Les Huguenots: O beau pays [in German] / Lilli Lehmann, soprano w/various accompaniments, available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking links above\n\nThe recordings of German soprano Lilli Lehmann, one of the original Rhinemaidens at Bayreuth and a later interpreter of many of Wagner’s finest soprano roles, are among the greatest treasures left us from the distant past, and this in spite of the fact that they have really poor sound even by 1906-07 standards. This was because she would only record for one of her “hometown” labels, Odeon, which had notoriously dry, boxy sound even into the early electrical era, by which time they were part of the Polydor group. (Don’t let the occasional Columbia labels you may see online fool you; these were reissues in the 1920s, when Columbia had a reciprocal contract with Odeon.)\n\nYou will notice three things about these recordings. The first is a more liberal use of portamento than singers use nowadays. Although Lehmann’s portamento was not as exaggerated as in the case of some Italian singers, it was a part of her singing style because it was considered to be highly artistic at that time. The second is that, for a dramatic soprano who sang both Isolde and Norma, the voice sounds not only light but extremely flexible—note the coloratura runs and trills that she sings in Handel and Mozart. The third thing is occasional liberties taken with the music, particularly in Constanze’s I”Ach, ich leibte” from Die Entführung. This was, of course, the actual performance practice of the 18th century, which had pretty much stopped or at least slowed down quite a bit by the time she made her records. In the later 20th century, some singers have attempted to revive this practice, but since it is not a living part of these singers’ style it often sounds artificial and mannered.\n\nBut make no mistake, Lilli Lehmann had a very large voice and was also considered to be one of the greatest artists of her day, and you can still hear many of the things that made her great, even though she was nearly 60 when he made these records/\n\nLEHMANN, LOTTE\n\nSTRAUSS: Der Rosenkavalier: O, sei er gut, Quinquin.

Lilli had a very large voice, impeccable technique and was essentially an opera singer though she did sing songs. Lotte had a moderately-sized, bright lyric voice, a somewhat flawed technique (she generally took too many breaths in her phrases), and was essentially a song and lieder singer although she did perform a little over a dozen roles on the opera stage, including the Wagnerian roles of Eva in Die Meistersinger, Elisabeth in Tannhauser and Sieglinde in Die Walküre. But Lotte was luckier than Lilli. She made a lot of recordings and sang on the radio, most of it during the era of electrical recording, which gave us a more realistic impression of her voice. The recordings listed above are among her very finest.\n\nLEIBOWITZ, RENÉ\n\nMUSSORGSKY: A Night on Bare Mountain. MOZART: Symphony No. 41, “Jupiter”: I. Allegro vivace; II. Andante cantabile; III.

Although a staunch proponent of the 12-tone school, he, like his friend Pierre Boulez, had an extremely wide repertoire as the above recordings will show. Also recommended, if you can find them, are his recordings of Schoenberg’s Chamber Symphony and highlights from Massenet’s Manon with Rosalind Elias, Cesare Valletti and Gérard Souzay with the Rome Opera Orchestra.\n\nLEIDER, FRIDA\n\nWEBER: Oberon: Ozean! du Ungeheuer.

Despite some stiff competition from Florence Austral and Nanny Larsen-Todsen, she managed to become the most celebrated Wagnerian soprano of her day, but fate was not kind to her. Kirsten Flagstad, who had a much bigger and more beautiful voice (but not greater dramatic instincts) came along in 1935 and, by 1937, had overshadowed the older soprano, who retired in 1943. These recordings, however, will give you a good idea of her many excellent qualities.\n\nLEWENTHAL, RAYMOND\n\n1951 CARNEGIE HALL CONCERT: Scarlatti: Sonata in C, K. 132. Sonata in e min., K. 198.

Lipatti was a relentless perfectionist who spent years working on any works he performed before actually playing them; between that tendency plus his battle against leukemia, which eventually took his life at the young age of 33, he left only these recordings (plus an alternate version of the Schumann concerto), all of which have been revived in the catalog over the past 70 years. They are all in mono sound, but mostly good, clear mono, and particularly in the music of Chopin his no-nonsense approach was a revelation which influenced a number of later pianists who rejected the ultra-Romantic view of that composer.\n\nLIVERMAN, WILL\n\nDREAMS OF A NEW DAY / SNEED: Dream a World.

ABDIMOMYN: “Yerke Sylkym” / Kazakh State String Quartet / Divox CDX-21501-6\n\nTo say that this album flew under the radar of most classical music lovers would be an understatement; except for my review, it was virtually ignored by everyone; yet thee Kazakhstan composers, ranging from mid-19th century to the present, have written some extremely interesting and original music which is played superbly by this little-known string quartet.\n\nKEMPE, RUDOLF\n\nBRAHMS: Tragic Overture. SCHUMANN: Manfred Overture / Berlin Philharmonic Orch. J. STRAUSS, Jr.: Leichtes Blut Polka. PONCHIELLI: La Gioconda: Dance of the Hours / Vienna Philharmonic Orch. BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 4 / Münchner Philharmoniker. DEBUSSY: Prelude à l;après-midi d’un faune / Dresden Staatskapelle / TCHAIKOVSKY: Symphony No. 5 / London Symphony Orch. / Rudolf Kempe, conductor / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking links above\n\nWhen Herbert von Karajan told Walter Legge that he was leaving EMI to sign with Deutsche Grammophon, the label hurriedly signed Dresden conductor Rudolf Kempe to a long-term contract. Kempe’s personality couldn’t have been more different than Karajan’s; where the latter was nervy, aggressive and sometimes abrasive, the former was as quiet as a churchmouse but highly talented. Kempe could elicit the mot exquisite sounds from an orchestra that one could ever hope to hear, and although he was not a constant visitor to Abbey Road he left a pretty fair amount of recordings when he died in the 1970s. Unfortunately, what most people remember about him is his large output of Richard Strauss’ orchestral music, which he liked but did not really love. The music listed in this collection will give you a much better idea of what all the fuss was about. He was one of the few conductors besides Furtwängler who could make some sense out of Bruckner’s monstrous symphonies, and his Tchaikovsky has a much lighter touch than that of most conductors. I was devastated when he died and still miss him.\n\nKENTNER, LOUIS\n\nBALAKIREV: Piano Sonata in Bb min. Rêverie. Mazurka No. 6 in Ab. Islamey (Fantaisie Orientale). LISZT: Piano Sonata in B min.

These recordings of mostly offbeat repertoire show that he was indeed a fine artist when the spirit moved him.\n\nKESUMA, MARTIN\n\nGRANADOS: Allegro de concierto. VINE: 5 Bagatelles. GINASTERA: Piano Sonata No. 1. SUPRANA: Temband Alit. TAKEMITSU: Rain Tree Sketch. KAPUSTIN: Variations, Op. 41. OQUIN: Detours / Martin Kesuma, pianist / Centaur CRC 3636\n\nWhen this recital disc first appeared in July 2021, I gave it a rave review and rightly so. For a pianist you’ve never heard of before, Kesuma us simply fabulous in every respect, technically, emotionally and in his choice of unusual material, all of which he apparently has an affinity with.\n\nKIM, JONAH\n\nKODÁLY: Solo Cello Sonata. ABEL: Approaching Autumn. GRIEG: Cello Sonata / Jonah Kim, cellist; Robert Koenig, pianist / Delos DE 3585\n\nA half-century ago, a talent as phenomenal as Jonah Kim would be ranked among the world’s best cellists, but standards have risen so high in that time that only a few reviewers like myself seemed to notice just how good he is. This unusual program covers works from three different eras, all of which he plays superbly.\n\nKIM, MIHI\n\nGIESEKING: Flute Sonata. PIERNÉ: Flute Sonata. MILHAUD: Sonatine for Flute & Piano. TAKTAKISHVILI: Flute Sonata / Mihi Kim, flautist; Bertrand Giraud, pianist / Anima ANM 130700001\n\nThis recording is proof positive that not all flute recitals are created alike. Mihi Kim plays here an entire program of unknown or little-known works by 20th-century composers, one of whom—the great German pianist Walter Gieseking—took even me by surprise, and her playing is lively and engaged.\n\nKIPNIS, ALEXANDER\n\nGOUNOD: Faust: Le veau d’or; Vous qui faites l’endormie.

WELDON: Nature Framed Thee / Emma Kirkby, soprano; Anthony Rooley, lutenist / United Classics T2CD201313028 or available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking titles above\n\nContrary to what many people may think, Emma Kirkby’s voice as such wasn’t too terribly different from several British sopranos who preceded her. The difference was that she was able to sing both early Baroque and later Baroque techniques as well as singing with more energy and interpretation than those of the past. The first CD listed above covers her early years; the second came quite a bit later, yet there was no deterioration of her voice or style.\n\nKLEIBER, CARLOS\n\nBEETHOVEN: Coriolanus Overture. MOZART: Symphony No. 33. BRAHMS: Symphony No. 4 w/Bavarian State Orch. BEETHOVEN: Symphony No. 4 / Concertgebouw Orch. MOZART: Symphony No. 36, “Linz.” w/Vienna Philharmonic Orch. J. STRAUSS: Die Fledermaus: Overture w/South German Radio Orch. / Carlos Kleiber, conductor / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking links above\n\nThe only drawback that Carlos Kleiber had to being the dominant conductor of the 1960s through the late ‘70s, when Klaus Tennstedt came along to rival him, was his fairly small repertoire, but these performances show what a dynamic force he could be when he wanted to.\n\nKNAPPERTSBUSCH, HANS\n\nWAGNER: Die Meistersinger: Act I Prelude. LISZT: Les Preludes / Berlin Philharmonic Orch. MOZART: 6 German Dances. LISZT: Mazeppa. J. STRAUSS: Freuet euch des Lebens. STRAUSS: Salome: Dance of the Seven Veils w/Berlin State Opera Orch. ROSSINI: Guillaume Tell Overture w/Munich State Opera Orch. / Hans Knappertsbusch, conductor / available for free streaming\n\nHans Knappertsbusch became so iconic for his Wagner performances, particularly those of Parsifal, that many collectors don’t even know that he once had a much wider repertoire and conducted at a much faster clip than in his later years. These recordings show how good he was in his prime.\n\nKOMSI, ANU\n\nBRITTEN: Les Illuminations.* HENZE: Being Beauteous. SCHOENBERG: Herzgewächse. CASTIGLIONI: Terzina.

She ticks off lovers of avant-garde classical music by singing several standard soprano arias, then annoys more conservative listeners by singing many modern works, but she has a beautiful voice, outstanding musicianship and great interpretive skills.\n\nKOPATCHINSKAJA, PATRICIA\n\nLECLAIR: Tambourin in C.

LIGETI: Hommage à Hilding Rosenberg. KODÁLY: Duo for Violin & Cello. J.S. BACH: Prelude No. 15 in G / Patricia Kopatchinskaja, violinist; Sol Gabetta, cellist / Alpha Classics 757\n\nIn addition to all her many outstanding recordings as a solo artist, Patricia Kopatchinskaja’s duet CD with cellist Sol Gabetta is as wild a romp as you are likely to find in an album that includes many modern works side-by-side with several established classics.\n\nKOSMOS ENSEMBLE\n\nTRAD.

VAUGHEN WILLIAMS: The Lark. BEY: Longa. PETERSBURSKI: Polish Tango. TRAD.: “Ukrainian” Dances. PIAZZOLA: Liberkiezango (Libertango) / Kosmos Ensemble / Nimbus Alliance NI6378\n\nWhen I reviewed this album in 2019, I described it as “featuring a bevy of traditional and through-composed tunes from the Middle East and Eastern Europe along with their own ‘takes’ on such classical standards as Ralph Vaughan Williams’ The Lark Ascending and Astor Piazzola’s Libertango… feel-good music with a strong classical bias and a near-perfect fusion with folk, klezmer, Arabic music and jazz.” And it still holds up today.\n\nKOUSSEVITZKY, SERGE\n\nSIBELIUS: Pohjola’s Daughter. RACHMANINOV: Isle of the Dead. PROKOFIEV: Peter and the Wolf w/Eleanor Roosevelt, narr. COPLAND: Appalachian Spring / Boston Symphony Orch.; Serge Koussevitzky, conductor / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking titles above\n\nOnce one of the most famous names in the conducting world, Serge Koussevitzky was already being forgotten by most classical lovers by the time I came of age in the early 1970s for two reasons: 1) he was long dead, and 2) although he promoted a great deal of modern American music, most of it wasn’t recorded by conservative RCA Victor. He could also be quite stodgy in his performances; even though he was the one who commissioned Maurice Ravel to orchestrate Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition, his recording of it was absolutely miserable. These performances, however, are considerably livelier and give one a good idea of how the Boston Symphony sounded during his quarter century as its music director.\n\nKRÄNZLE, JOHANNES MARTIN\n\nDIE MITTERNACHT ZOG NÄHER SCHON / LOEWE: Edward.

BUSONI: Flohlied / Johannes Martin Kränzle, baritone; Hilko Dumno, pianist / Oehms Classics OC815, also available for free streaming on Spotify\n\nOne of the greatest baritone recitals you’ll ever hear in your life, sung by a man whose biggest claim to fame is that he is the go-to guy to sing Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger! Yet he has a rich, beautiful voice and is an exceptional interpreter.\n\nKRAUSS, CLEMENS\n\nMOZART: Così fan tutte: Overture. STRAUSS: Also Sprach Zarathustra. BEETHOVEN: Piano Concerto No. 5, “Emperor” w/Wilhelm Backhaus, pno. Missa Solemnis w/Trude Eipperle, sop; Luise Willer, alto; Julius Patzak, ten; Georg Hann, bs / Clemens Krauss, cond; Vienna Philharmonic Orch. / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking links above\n\nClemens Krauss, once considered one of Germany’s greatest conductors, was overshadowed in the 1940s and ‘50s by Furtwängler and Toscanini, both of whom he came to detest (he was an excellent conductor, but a very jealous man!). These performances show him much closer to the latter than the former in his interpretive skills, as does his superb late-1940s performance of Salome with Maria Cebotari in the title role which is in my composers’ guide. Alas, he only made it as far as both of his rivals did, dying in 1954.\n\nKREISLER, FRITZ\n\nCADMAN: At Dawning. SMETANA: Bohemian Fantasy.

GRIEGL Violin Sonata in C min. w/Sergei Rachmaninov, pno. / available for free streaming on YouTube by clicking titles above\n\nWell, here he is, folks: Public Enemy No. 1 as far as violinists are concerned. The first violinist to play with constant vibrato throughout his range in every note on his instrument. Boo! Hiss!! Damn him to oblivion! Well…except for one thing. People still listen to and love his playing, even today. And one other thing. Not ONE violinist who has recorded his very popular pieces – I say not ONE – has ever been able to duplicate his sound or his innate Viennese schmaltz, which tells you how bogus the Historically-Informed Performance movement is (among several other examples I could cite). Yet beneath all of his schmaltzy portamento effects and throbbing strings, Kreisler was a first-class musician, and he tweaked the culture snobs of his day by writing pieces in the style of such older composers as Corelli, Tartini, Couperin etc. and passing them off as his own. And not one music critic or musicologist caught him out on it because the pieces sounded 100% authentic; the only way we know that he wrote them is that, in the late 1920s, he finally admitted it publicly, so that’s when the record labels were suddenly revised to list him as composer.\n\nKUFFERATH, ELISABETH\n\nTWO! / ZIMMERMANN: Solo Violin Sonata.

Déssacord for 2 Violins / Elisabeth Kuffer, violinist/violist / CAvi-music 8553109, also available for free streaming on Spotify\n\nWe live in an extraordinary age, where some classical musicians are so incredibly gifted on two instruments that they pursue active careers in both…and, occasionally, show off a bit by playing both on a single CD, sometimes double-tracking themselves. Elisabeth Kufferath is one such, and what makes this album so special is that, instead of re-treading the same old repertoire, she has filled the disc with contemporary works, all of which she plays splendidly.\n\nKULMAN, ELISABETH\n\nMUSSORGSKY: Gopak.

The above is one of his finest albums. I’m not sure if it’s still available as a physical CD—the record companies just love to delete things that don’t sell a half-million copies—but at least most of the Copland songs from it are available on YouTube by clicking the titles above.\n\nBERLIOZ: Irlande: La belle Voyageuse; Adieu, Bessy!; Le Coucher du soleil; L’Origine de la harpe; Elegie.
