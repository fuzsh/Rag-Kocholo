        "text": "“I thought what you could do with video which nobody had done, was to make paintings that happened to change, and that’s where all my sky films came from. They were at natural speed. They weren’t sped up or slowed down. They were of what I saw out of my window. And it was very interesting, when I used to make those things people would come round to my flat sometimes, they could sit looking out of the window if they wanted to but they always sat looking at the video of the view outside the window…” – Brian Eno 1\n\n2 Fifth Avenue has never been released on any kind of home media. There also do not appear to be be any fan uploads available.\n\nEno’s role: video artist, music\n\nEno is popularly known for his musical endeavors but he is also a prominent visual artist, working primarily with installations that include video, light, sound, or some combination thereof. While he was clearly involved with the visual arts during his time at art school in the late 1960s, joining Roxy Music in early 1971 pushed him in a different direction. In 1979, Eno made his official return to fine art with the first of several video art pieces.\n\nEno’s forays into video were brought about, like so many of his creations, by chance. In Eno’s words:\n\n“I was working in a studio in New York with Talking Heads on the album MORE SONGS ABOUT BUILDINGS AND FOOD. The band Foreigner were in the next studio. One of their road crew popped his head into our studio and asked if anyone wanted to buy a video camera and recorder. Colour. Those were pretty rare at the time, and, since he wasn’t asking much for it, I took a chance on it. 2\n\n“That’s always been the way I’ve bought equipment. I didn’t know about cameras or anything, and it just happened that the camera was a real beauty, the best one I could have bought.” 3\n\nMore Songs About Buildings and Food was primarily recorded and mixed in the Bahamas with only a small amount of work done in New York in April, 1978. A couple sources (including a 1980 interview with Eno) suggest this camera purchase may have occurred during the Fear of Music sessions instead, which would put it in mid-1979. Either one is technically possible given when Eno exhibited his first video works but More Songs seems to be the common consensus.\n\nEno brought the camera home and tried it out. Not having a tripod, he sat it on his windowsill, which was also difficult because the camera had a curved bottom; he had to lay it on its side so it wouldn’t fall over. In order to properly view what he had filmed, he ended up turning his TV on its side as well, and according to Eno, “That was the moment of revelation. In portrait format the television stopped being ‘TV’ and became a painting. Looking at it, you stopped thinking of it as television and thought of it instead as living painting.” 4\n\nThis became the impetus for Eno’s first video pieces. They generally feature long shots out of his apartment window of whatever he could see: primarily buildings and sky. Using manual controls on the camera, he could manipulate the color, saturation, and other visual elements to create slow, gradual changes. The end results are calm and still. In Eno’s words,\n\n“Nothing much happens and they’re very slow, but they’re amazingly beautiful colours, like a massive building against a green sky with brilliant ultramarine windows and pink clouds moving across behind it….\n\nWhat’s interesting about these things is that they have a feeling of incredible silence about them, ’cause there’s nothing really moving in them except sometimes you see a reflection of a cloud, or a bird flies very quickly by, or a curtain moves a little bit. But it’s this strange feeling of this building which you know is located in the most bustling city in the world, but it’s just still and silent and it has this sort of crystalline, really weird quality. 5\n\nEssentially, Eno was creating ambient videos, on par with the ambient music pieces which he had begun not long before. According to Eno, “Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.” 6 Showing a strong parallel, he notes that his early video work was meant to answer the question, “What type of image would not presuppose the time and attention characteristically accorded a narrative structure?”7\n\nIn many ways, Eno’s ambient video work was also meant as a contrast to other early ‘Video Art’ works of the period. He states:\n\n“it was… a reaction to what was called Video Art, which it seemed to me was entirely enslaved by Hollywood, either by trying to be like Hollywood or desperately resisting being like it in any way at all. So you got terrible Video Art shows where some not very attractive looking artist was staring at a camera, flabby and naked for forty-five minutes… of course in black and white because colour was Hollywood, y’know…” 8\n\nEno’s first publicly displayed video piece was 2 Fifth Avenue, originally shown at renowned New York underground arts center The Kitchen in 1979. Video artist Tom Bowes was a curator for The Kitchen at the time and is credited with producing the original installation; he was also responsible for editing the piece.\n\n2 Fifth Avenue was presented on 3-4 televisions, each turned 90 degrees on its side per Eno’s early experiments. The arrangement of the TVs varied at different locations: at The Kitchen, they were stacked vertically on top of one another; at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, each TV had its own individual cart and they were arranged horizontally. At the Walker Art Museum in Minneapolis, a custom wall installation was created to align the images vertically while showing only the screens rather than the entire bulky TV sets.\n\nAccompanying the piece was Eno’s recent solo album, Ambient 1 / Music for Airports. In keeping with the inherent ideas of this piece, 2 Fifth Avenue was originally intended to be shown at New Jersey’s Newark Airport, as sometimes indicated in a subtitle to the work. While it never made it to Newark to my knowledge, it was shown in La Guardia Airport in mid-1980.\n\nThe press release for 2 Fifth Ave’s first showing gives a good feel for what it was like:\n\n“In his installation at The Kitchen, Eno applies his concept of ‘ambient music’ to visual work. Four discrete channels of video all draw on the same source material. Each channel depicts an angular composition of the same New York building, 2 Fifth Ave. Eno varies the channels by manipulating color distortion, light variations, sequence in timing and framing. The editing sequence of these variations is fugue-like in its slowly-evolving composition.” 9\n\nReviews of its first showing at The Kitchen were mixed. The Soho Weekly News seemed rather nonplussed by the “tedium” 10 of the video but was more impressed by the music. The Village Voice, on the other hand, appreciated the video, likening it to “seeing Monet’s Rouen Cathedral series happening in real time” 11 while praising the music even further. An Omni reviewer of 2 Fifth Avenue’s appearance at La Guardia was clearly enraptured by the piece, praising it at length. The other airport patrons were rather mixed, “ranging from enraptured enthusiasm to impatience and total nonchalance.” 12\n\nEno clearly relished the piece being displayed in an actual airport. In his words:\n\n“In an airport you have this captive group of people who don’t really have options; so you can create a place where you can introduce some sort of meditative calm for a while. I guess what I want to do with this piece is give you the feeling of being alone again. Most of us spend nearly all our time with others. And we forget we’re always tailoring ourselves for others, always adapting and modifying our behaviour…. I guess I’m looking for some feeling of luscious silence, a feeling of solitariness.” 13\n\n2 Fifth Avenue was shown several times between 1979-1981 at multiple locations. Known exhibitions include The Kitchen, New York, NY, July 1 – Sept 29, 1979; Paul Ide Gallery in Brussels, Feb 28 – April 12, 1980; Hallwalls, Buffalo, NY, May 16-26, 1980; La Guardia Airport, New York, NY, summer 1980; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN, June 1980; New Gallery of Contemporary Art, Cleveland, OH, Aug 1980; Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, TX, Aug 8 – 30, 1981; and St. Louis Arts Museum, St. Louis, MO, Aug/Sept 1981.\n\nBibliography\n\nSpecial thanks to More Dark Than Shark for their incredible database of Eno-related articles.\n\nBerkeley Art Museum. “Brian Eno MATRIX/BERKELEY 44.” Retrieved from Berkeley Art Museum & Pacific Film Archive, Nov. 26, 2022: https://bamlive.s3.amazonaws.com/MATRIX_44_Brian_Eno.pdf\n\nBrutvan, Cheryl A. “Brian Eno: Video and Music,” Contemporary Arts Museum (1981).
