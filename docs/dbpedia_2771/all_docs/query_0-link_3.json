        "text": "18 East 79 Street (Madison-Fifth)\n\nAcquavella Galleries is pleased to present “Wayne Thiebaud: Summer Days.” The exhibition, organized in collaboration with the Wayne Thiebaud Foundation, presents works from multiple decades of the artist’s career and tracks his sustained interest in recurring subject matter, here offering a nostalgic look at American life passing through the heat of summer. In “Summer Days” the artist’s many paintings play with both present and past, tasking the viewer to relax amongst scenes of warmth, indulgence, and distant serenity. Rendered in candy-colored impasto, the exhibition includes examples of Thiebaud’s paintings of sweets, hot dogs, bathing suits, and whirling beach scenes, among other subjects.\n\nGallery Talk\n\n2pm & 3pm: A review of the exhibition on view.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-5pm.\n\n1018 Madison Avenue, Fl. 3 (78-79)\n\nAlexander Berggruen is pleased to present our second solo with the painter Anna Kunz, whom the gallery represents. Kunz makes luminous, vibrant paintings with an emphasis on color, material, and process. Her practice thoughtfully considers the viewer’s experience, taking into account—with deep awareness and intentionality—how each work, each gesture, affects the exhibition space and, by extension, the viewer.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n24 East 81 Street (Madison-Fifth)\n\nEnrico Baj: Alter Ego and Other Hypotheses – Celebrating the Artist’s Centennial. With a passion for the eccentric and a strong iconoclastic impulse, Enrico Baj (1924-2003) was one of the central figures of the Italian Neo-Avant-Garde. Born in Milan, his art and writings played an instrumental role in influential movements, from Dada and Surrealism to Art Informel and CoBrA, as well as the Nuclear Art movement.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n744 Madison Avenue (64-65)\n\nEnchanted Reverie: Klee and Calder is organized in collaboration with the Calder Foundation. The exhibition brings together over forty paintings, sculptures, and works on paper to present Klee and Calder in dialogue, illuminating their shared metaphysical understanding of the universe’s unseen forces.\n\nGallery Talk\n\n3pm: Please join us for a guided tour of “Enchanted Reverie: Klee and Calder”.\n\nGallery Hours: Other than the Gallery Talk, which should be booked via the Madison Avenue Gallery Walk booking engine by clicking here, Madison Avenue Gallery Walk guests must book their visit via Di Donna’s own booking site at https://didonna.com/reserve.\n\n43 East 78 Street (Madison-Park)\n\nAnh Duong: The Incoherences of a Gentlewoman: Galerie Gmurzynska showcases Anh Duong’s work in an comprehensive exhibition spanning self-portraiture, portraiture, and still lifes. The show runs in concurrence with Dolce and Gabbana’s new exhibition, From The Heart to The Hands, at the Palazzo Reale in Milan, where Duong’s 24 commissioned works are featured in a stunning floor to ceiling display\n\nArtist Talk\n\n3pm: Anh Duong visits us from Paris to discuss her life, her influences, and, of course, her body of work on display. Veristic in style and uncompromisingly theatrical in substance, the pieces play with the complicated ideas of identity, self-expression, and gender.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-5pm.\n\n23 East 67 Street, 2nd Floor (Madison-Fifth)\n\nGoodman Gallery presents In Focus: Kapwani Kiwanga, a presentation of select bodies of work by the artist. The presentation opens alongside Kiwanga’s solo exhibition, Trinket, currently on view at the Canada Pavilion in Venice. Kapwani Kiwanga’s practice centers around a keen sense for the inherent properties of materials and in turn their ability to communicate multiple layers of meaning.\n\nGallery Hours: 10am-4pm.\n\n41 East 57 Street, 9th Floor (Madison-Park)\n\nColin Hunt: The Land is a Body – In Colin Hunt’s new paintings in egg tempera and watercolor, the artist expands on previous themes of passage and memory, with the recognition that environments – the land itself – also hold memories and experience loss. These paintings refract figures and their relationship to place but also suggest how the landscape might do that as well, encompassing not only human time, but earthly time. Hunt deftly combines the traditions of portraiture and landscape painting, veering from the conventions of each. Neither person nor place, these new paintings sit “at the crossroads of memory, loss, and ecology.”\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-5pm.\n\n41 East 57 Street (Madison-Park)\n\nJoel Meyerowitz (b. 1938) was born in New York City and began taking photographs in 1962. Although he has always seen himself as a street photographer in the tradition of Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank, he transformed the mode with his pioneering use of color. As an early advocate of color photography (mid-60’s), Meyerowitz was instrumental in changing the attitude toward the use of color photography from one of resistance to nearly universal acceptance.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-5pm.\n\n31 East 72nd Street (Madison-Park)\n\nThe prevailing view of photography as a medium designed to express facts and freeze moments in time is given a new dimension in Min Yeon Sik’s work. Instead of relying on abundant natural light to illuminate his subjects, Min consciously confronts the absence of light, choosing to reveal a reality that remains hidden from casual observation. This intentional engagement with darkness redefines the traditional role of photography by transforming it into a means of uncovering the intrinsic nature of subjects when stripped of their luminosity.\n\nGallery Talk\n\n2pm & 4pm: The talk will highlight the artist’s methodology and agenda. This will be an opportunity for attendees to learn about his practice and the steps in which he took to capture and develop these dreamlike works.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n35 East 76 Street (Madison-Park)\n\nDiscover Didier Guillon’s ” Ivo in Japan” an exhibition of contemporary design with Japanese atmospheres.\n\nGallery Tours:\n\nHourly, 10am to 5pm: A tour of the private Fondation Valmont collection and newest “Ivo in Japan” is available while also shopping for your Swiss skincare. Available is a film created by Valentine Guillon to represent “Ivo in Japan” and her trip to Japan with her father, Didier Guillon.\n\nGallery Hours: 10am-6pm.\n\n23 East 73 Street, 7th Floor (Madison-Fifth)\n\nLes Enluminures is proud to present an important group of manuscripts, miniatures and jewelry from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\n\nCurator Talk\n\n12pm & 3pm: The curator of the exhibition will lead viewers into a deep dive of the Middle Ages and how works of art, from manuscripts to jewelry, had a place in the burgeoning societies of Europe.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-5pm.\n\n17 East 67 Street, #1A (Madison-Fifth)\n\nFounded in 1889, the National Association of Women Artists (NAWA) is the oldest women artists’ collective in the United States. This exhibition celebrates historic members from the early-mid 20th century for the organization’s 135th Anniversary.\n\nGallery Talk\n\n2pm: Join us for a tour of the exhibition on view.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n595 Madison Avenue, 6th Floor (57-58)\n\nThe exhibition Art Handling: An Installation Play by Liz Magic Laser is conceived as a theatre piece, revolving around a group of 20th century artworks that rely on unconventional installation protocols or links to performative enactments. With works by Robert Rauschenberg, Claes Oldenburg, Gino De Dominicis, Esperanza Mayobre and Liz Magic Laser.\n\nArtist Talk\n\n2pm: Luxembourg + Co. will host an artist-led tour of the exhibition with Liz Magic Laser and Esperanza Mayobre.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n813 Madison Avenue (68-69)\n\nEnjoy a special residency of Arlene Angard Designs & Fine Arts at Max Mara. “In our world, Renaissance art blossoms, weaving a tapestry of multimedia enchantment. Our emotions into tangible forms, freezing fleeting moments through the lens of our photography. A personal symphony of boundless creativity in the form of Art.”\n\nCurator’s Tour:\n\n11am-2pm: A special tour of the Exhibition on View.\n\nGallery Talk:\n\n3pm: Discussion by the curator followed by cocktail reception.\n\nExhibition Hours: 11am-6pm\n\n58 East 79 Street (Madison-Park)\n\nOver 100 years ago, on November 20, 1923, Otto Kallir’s (1894 – 1978) Neue Galerie opened its doors in Vienna with an exhibition of paintings by Egon Schiele. Kallir played a key role in establishing the posthumous reputations of Schiele, Gustav Klimt, and Richard Gerstl. His exhibitions of Edvard Munch (1924), Paul Signac (1924), Caspar David Friedrich (1926), Vincent Van Gogh (1928), and Auguste Renoir (1931) awakened Vienna to the avant-garde. Kallir supported the Hagenbund artists’ association and artists such as Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. After emigrating in 1938, he made significant contributions to the international recognition of Austrian modernism through exhibitions, sales, and donations to American museums.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n958 Madison Avenue (75-76)\n\nNathan Brujis has developed a visual language that mirrors a sensation of the expressive power of the subconscious and the spiritual. Starting from simple geometric forms and gestural brushstrokes arranged in layers, Mr. Brujis’ voyage solidifies into a multidimensional discovery of opposing forces, an embodiment of the universal fabric as seen through the eyes of the artist.\n\nArtist Talk\n\n12pm & 3pm: Nathan will give a tour of his exhibition, and discuss his creative process.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm\n\n23 East 67 Street, Third Floor (Madison-Fifth)\n\nLeitmotif: a solo exhibition of seminal works by Osvaldo Mariscotti. The show features new paintings and a sculpture by the artist. Osvaldo Mariscotti’s art is an art of fundamentals: color, line, and the possibilities inherent in their variation and repetition. Using this economy of means, Mariscotti creates an expressive world that draws on sources as diverse as nature, classical music, and the early pioneers of abstraction\n\nGallery Talk:\n\n2pm & 4pm: Join us for a tour of the exhibition on view.\n\nGallery Hours: 11am-6pm.\n\n1002 Madison Avenue (77-78)\n\nWhite Cube is pleased to present ‘AERIAL’, an exhibition by Antony Gormley, in which the artist considers sculpture as an instrument for proprioception – the body’s innate capacity to sense and perceive its position, movements and orientation in relation to itself and the environment. The exhibition features two recent developments in Gormley’s practice: one explores physical proximity in mass and scale, where two over-life-size bodies merge as one, while the other endeavours to catalyse space almost without mass.\n\nGallery Hours: 10am-6pm."
