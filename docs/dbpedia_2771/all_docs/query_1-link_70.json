        "text": "First Responders Benefit from WPS Foundation Grants\n\nPublished on 08/27/2024 under News Local first responders will be better equipped during emergency responses thanks to the continued support of the Wisconsin Public Service Foundation. Like Christmas in August, the Foundation will be visiting law enforcement, fire, EMS and rescue agencies around the Northwoods this week to provide funding for crucial equipment, safety gear, and training. One of their first stops was with the Vilas County Sheriff's Office in Eagle River Monday afternoon. The Sheriff's Office utilized this funding to purchase a thermal imaging device which will help locate individuals during low visibility situations such as night, weather, and in heavily wooded areas. This is expected to be useful during search & rescue and tactical situations Chief Deputy Patrick Schmidt says the WPS Foundation has stepped up and filled a void that they were unable to budget for. Other local recipients including the Minocqua Police Department, Nokomis Fire Department, Rhinelander Police and the Oneida County Dive Team. We'll have a bit more on these grants in the coming days. Over the past decade, the WPS Foundation has awarded more than $600,000 through Rewarding Responders. -Photos provided by Wisconsin Public Service Foundation-\n\n+ Read More Fatal ATV Crash in Oneida County Sunday\n\nPublished on 08/27/2024 under News One person is dead following an ATV crash in Oneida County over the weekend. According to the Oneida County Sheriff's Office, responders were called to Lakewood Road near Sand Lake Road in the Town of Cassian. The call came in at shortly after 6pm Sunday evening. According to the preliminary investigation, the deputy determined the operator failed to negotiate a curve, left the roadway, and struck a telephone pole. Witnesses attempted life saving measures, however, the operator, a 66 year old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. His name is being withheld pending notification of family. No other information on the crash has been provided. According to DNR data, there have been 23 fatal ATV/UTV crashes in Wisconsin this year.\n\n+ Read More Overnight Storms Lead to Scattered Power Outages\n\nPublished on 08/27/2024 under News Following Monday's heat and humidity, a storm system passed across Northern and Central Wisconsin overnight and into Tuesday morning. The storm brought some gusty winds, leading to reports of downed trees and branches. That led to power outages across the region. At day break, there were approximately 2,000 customers without power across the WPS footprint, with those outages very scattered. Crews have already been busy this morning, and those numbers have been steadily dropping during the sunrise show. People are reminded to always stay at least 25 feet from a downed power line and report them.\n\n+ Read More Students Back on Nicolet Campus; Welcome Week\n\nPublished on 08/27/2024 under News It was back to school day yesterday for one group of Northwoods students. Nicolet College kicked off their traditional fall semester on Monday. Coinciding with the first day of class, Nicolet is also hosting 'Welcome Week' It's an opportunity for students to build a sense of community and connection to the campus, meet new people, and get involved in campus activities and organizations. That's especially important for Nicolet, comprised of commuters who come and go throughout the day. Throughout the Welcome Week activities over the next few days, they've got a busy schedule with lawn games, student resources, information on student organizations, and other networking opportunities. They've even brought in some food trucks and were hosting a Coffee Talk on Tuesday morning. And while Monday kicked off the fall semester, Nicolet's flexible scheduling has several additional opportunities for students to enroll through the Nicolet My Way program.\n\n+ Read More Severe Weather Can Impact Red Cross Blood Drives Nationwide\n\nPublished on 08/27/2024 under News The American Red Cross continues to experience a national blood shortage, and severe weather often plays a role in collection efforts. Snow, tornadoes, flooding and wildfires can all result to the cancellation of blood drives. The latest example, Hurricane Debby, led to nearly 60 canceled blood drives up the East Coast. While Wisconsin wasn't affected this time around, the Red Cross reports 36 Wisconsin-based blood drives have been canceled this year, resulting in an estimated 1,300 uncollected blood donations. The Red Cross says, \"Because blood has a short shelf life and can only come from volunteer blood donors, any disruptions in the ability to collect lifesaving blood can have serious consequences for hospitals and patients.\" With September National Emergency Preparedness Month, their latest campaign will focus on how a strong blood supply is a key in preparedness. The next donation opportunity here in Tomahawk is on September 10 at their regular location at Grace Lutheran Church.\n\n+ Read More Northwoods Dealing with Heat, Humidity on Monday\n\nPublished on 08/26/2024 under News Summer's not quite over here in the Northwoods. With a couple of hot and humid days to start this work week, officials are reminding people to remember their heat safety. High temperatures are expected to flirt with 90 degrees on Monday. Coupled with elevated humidity, it will feel even warmer. As a result, the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for a number of neighboring counties including Marathon, Price, and Taylor Counties. While Lincoln County isn't included in the advisory, residents and visitors should still be mindful of their activities. We shared some of those tips at the start of the summer. Stay hydrated, limit strenuous activity, and take plenty of breaks and find some shade. Never leave little ones in an unattended vehicle; keep pets in mind as well. And it's also a good idea to check in on vulnerable populations. According to the National Weather Service, these hot, humid conditions may also lead to strong or severe storms late. We could have another hot day Tuesday, before relief on Wednesday.\n\n+ Read More Merrill Resumes Street Sign Dedication-Roger 'Budda' English\n\nPublished on 08/26/2024 under News Last year the City of Merrill began an honorary street sign project to recognize those who've left an indelible mark on the community. Those efforts resume today with a tribute to Roger 'Budda' English. Coming up this afternoon, city leaders, members of the Merrill Historical Preservation Committee, friends and family will gather to unveil the new honorary street sign at West Main and Wright Street. That location was selected as English was employed by Lincoln County Bank in Merrill for more than four decades and passed that intersection nearly every day walking to and from work. The city offered a few other highlights that led to English receiving the honor. The Merrill High School grad attended UW Stevens Point before serving in the US Army during the Korean War. After returning to Merrill, English also served as an alderman on the City Council for 25 years. He was also involved in Blue Jay athletics as both a referee and coach, and served with the VFW and Merrill Lions. The sign unveiling is scheduled to take place at 4pm today, and the public is invited to attend. Four new signs are being dedicated this year.\n\n+ Read More Northwoods Unemployment Estimates Up Slightly in July\n\nPublished on 08/26/2024 under News Local unemployment estimates continue small fluctuations over the summer. According to the latest data released by the Department of Workforce Development, the numbers ticked back up last month locally while it was a mixed bag around the state.

Now people have access to a new online tool allowing them to check the water quality of local lakes, rivers, and streams. This past week, the DNR announced the website known as Wisconsin Water Explorer. The goal is to make scientific data analysis more accessible to the public by automating the process of finding and analyzing data. The tool is able to provide insights into current water conditions and trends through printable or shareable graphs, maps and reports. The Citizen Lake Monitoring Network is among the groups that both utilize and contribute data to the program, as they can now access and share automated annual reports from their respective lakes. Paul Skawinski, statewide educator for the Citizen Lake Monitoring Network, highlighted the ease in using the program. He says, \"Both volunteers and staff use Wisconsin Water Explorer to quickly generate and download PDF reports and graphs to understand how a lake's water quality has changed over time.\" It's available on the DNR website.\n\n+ Read More Lac du Flambeau Township Holds Meeting on Disputed Roads\n\nPublished on 08/26/2024 under News Four roads in Lac du Flambeau will remain open for another month as town leaders continue to seek state or federal help in reaching a solution to the ongoing dispute. The township and the Lac du Flambeau tribe have been at odds over town roads that pass over tribal lands without an easement agreement. While the dispute dates back further, the situation escalated in January 2023 when barricades were placed to block the roads. Eventually, an arrangement re-opened the roads, with the township paying the Tribe on a monthly basis. It's seen as a temporary solution that is not financially viable in the future. That led to Friday's meeting which included invitations to a number of elected officials. Attendance included: State Senator Mary Felzkowski and Assemblyman Rob Swearingen; along with US Congressman Tom Tiffany and representatives from the offices of Senators Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin. Town leaders are looking to the state or federal government to help find a compromise. While there wasn't an immediate solution from the meeting, they had constructive dialogue. In the meantime, town officials made another payment this past week that will keep the roads open until the middle of September.\n\n+ Read More"
