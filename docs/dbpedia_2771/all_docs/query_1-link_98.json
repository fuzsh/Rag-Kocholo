        "text": "To make golf for everyone by delivering a dynamic, entertaining, and inclusive way to experience golf. Five Iron has quickly re-shaped urban golf culture by putting a modern spin on an old classic. We began our story in 2017 from humble beginnings with one location on Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron District, the origin of our name (created by taking the “Five” from Fifth Avenue and the “Iron” from the Flatiron District.)\n\nFast forward to present day, Five Iron Golf has expanded nationwide across ten major U.S. cities and over 20 locations and counting, with international franchise locations in Singapore and India.\n\nHelping the masses to get their swing on, the 5i way is about access to play, practice and party, inclusivity to bring out the golfer in everyone and unforgettable experiences.\n\nFor the serious golfer, Five Iron hosts high-tech Trackman simulators, access to teaching professionals, practice time, leagues, club storage, showers, top-of-the-line clubs that are free to use during your booking, and in-house club fitting services.\n\nFor the less-than-serious golfer (and let’s be honest, most of the serious golfers too), Five Iron offers flexible event spaces, a full-service bar, locally-crafted food menus, table games like ping pong and shuffleboard, and widescreen TVs perfect for watching your favorite game.\n\nSlow your roll and up your game with Five Iron Golf."
