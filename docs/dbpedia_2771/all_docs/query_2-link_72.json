Floyd Yewell, American, 1885–1963\n\nArchitect\n\nShreve, Lamb & Harmon, New York, New York, 1929–1979\n\nCatalogue Status\n\nResearch in Progress\n\nDescription\n\nDepiction of a tall, rectangular skyscraper that appears to be an office building. The building is located at 500 Fifth Avenue at the corner of 5th Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan, and was designed by the architectural firm Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. The architecture is characterized by a setback or ziggurat style, becoming narrower as it reaches the sky. Other buildings appear to the left, in the background, and in the right foreground. The darkness of the foreground contrasts with the lighter space in the rest of the picture. The New York Public Library, identified by the two lion sculptures out front and its classical architecture, is shown in the left foreground facing 5th Avenue. Trees, small figures, cars, and a bus appear on the street level in front of the building.\n\nCredit Line\n\nGift of Edith H.
