        "text": "Academics & Instruction: In 9th grade, teachers use the Writing Revolution, a structured approach that is especially helpful for struggling writers. Teachers in all academic subjects use the same vocabulary and techniques in their classes, whether it’s a math teacher discussing how students should explain their approach to solving a problem or a history teacher critiquing an essay.\n\nThe school’s dual focus on academics and fashion careers means students juggle a lot. To minimize stress, the school has adopted a compassionate grading policy. Students may resubmit work after receiving feedback from the teacher so they can learn from their mistakes and try for a higher grade. Every two weeks all classes hold a “no new work day” so students may catch up on their assignments, review material, or tackle challenging enrichment activities.\n\nAdvanced and college level courses are open to students ready for the challenge. In addition to in-person tutoring for students, the school uses an online program for students needing extra help in algebra and geometry.\n\nCulture & Environment: Teachers take care to pronounce students’ names correctly and address them by their correct pronouns. Every 9th-grader takes a class to help them adjust to high school where they get support from upper grade student mentors.\n\nEach grade has a wellness team comprised of at least two guidance counselors, a social worker and an attendance teacher who keep tabs on students’ social and academic needs.\n\nThe school holds celebrations in honor of Black History, Women’s History and Hispanic and Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Months. Students may participate in Asian Culture, Black and Latina Empowerment, Black Student Union, Intersectional Feminist, Muslim Students Association and Rainbow Project clubs.\n\nNearly 90 percent of the students are female.\n\nThemes & Programs: Fashion Industries offers programs in three key areas: fashion, visual and digital art, and business. Within each area, students choose a path to major in: fashion design, photography, visual and digital art, fashion marketing and management, visual presentation and design, or web and software development.\n\nThe school has an advisory board of fashion industry professionals who help students network and secure internships and jobs.\n\nSpecial Education & English as a New Language (ENL): The school offers ENL classes for students learning English, and after school support. Students with disabilities are served in small special needs classes and ICT (integrated co-teaching) classes staffed by two teachers—one specializing in the subject and the other in special education—alongside on-site psychologists and social workers.\n\nBuilding & Facilities: The school is housed in a 10-story building, which can be hectic to navigate. Students use elevators and stairs. All classrooms have high ceilings and air conditioning. There’s a state-of-the-art fashion design lab and a photography dark room. The 1600-seat auditorium has a fashion show runway. An on-site health clinic provides free medical, dental and mental health services."
