        "text": "This is an unzoned school, meaning students who attend may come from across your school district, your borough, or sometimes the entire city. Anyone is welcome to apply, but look into your chances for admissions. To see if your address is in the district for this school use our Elementary School Guided Search.\n\nWhy might this school be a good fit for you? It offers another option. Some unzoned schools were designed as an alternative to traditional neighborhood schools, some were simply created to ease overcrowding at zoned schools, and some were founded with a magnet grant designed to foster integration through special programs (such as art, science, drama or law). If being at a school where most students are from your neighborhood is a higher priority, your zoned elementary school may be a better fit.\n\nAll schools in districts 1, 7 and 23 are unzoned.\n\nWondering \"What to Look For\" in your school selection process? Check our suggestions here.\n\nFor more information about school enrollment and advice on how to find a program, please visit our New to NYC page.\n\nIf you are a parent or staff member at this school, please tell us more about it in the Comments Section below.\n\nRead more"
