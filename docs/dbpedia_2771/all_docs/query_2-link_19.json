These neighborhoods, rooted in a vibrant and colorful past, promise opportunity where a mix of uses can occur in a single corridor, in a manner sensitive to residential occupancy and scale so that residential and commercial uses can exist and thrive together. Additionally, Fifth Avenue Pleasant Street contains an invaluable inventory of some of the most striking styles of vernacular Gainesville architecture found the city. Pleasant Street in particular boasts such a fine collection of historic structures that it has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. These neighborhoods contribute enormously to Gainesvilleâ€™s arts and culture with their annual activities and festivals, location within the City, and rich local history.\n\nDetailed Map FAPS Community Redevelopment Plan"
