        "text": "Get ready for the most wonderful time of the year with the best NYC events in December 2023. This season's highlights include, well, you already know what they are. You can really get into the spirit when you visit one of New York's many holiday markets boasting great gifts for your friends and family as well as tasty provisions. Looking for something less festive? Check out terrific seasonal theater shows and pop-up holiday bars.\n\nIn addition to rounding up Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa events, we've also included some non-holiday things to do when you need a break from the holiday cheer. Keep scrolling to the bottom for those, including art shows, walking tours and immersive theater.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Full NYC events calendar for 2023\n\nCheck out our Winter Village video\n\nGingerBread Lane—the world's largest gingerbread village—will return to Manhattan with NYC-inspired designs. Artist Jon Lovitch has been working on the detailed gingerbread display all year long.\n\nYear after year, Lovitch whips up thousands of pounds of icing and bakes hundreds of pounds of gingerbread to create massive gingerbread towns. Expect to see about 1,000 gingerbread houses, stores, breweries, dance studios, pizzerias, bakeries, ice cream parlors and more at the display. Look for pink nutcrackers drawn from the decor at Essex House, an ice rink as a nod to Rockefeller Center, a few homes that resemble those in Forest Hills, Queens, and lots of other NYC-inspired details.\n\nFind GingerBread Lane at Chelsea Market in Manhattan through January 7 near the hallway with the twinkling lights. It'll be on view during market hours, 8am-9am daily.\n\nRockefeller Center, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Bronx Zoo, the Apollo Theater and more iconic New York City landmarks have been shrunken down and sugar-fied into gingerbread re-creations. Twenty-three gingerbread houses comprise this year's \"Gingerbread NYC: The Great Borough Bake-Off\" at the Museum of the City of New York.\n\nThe display is now on view through January 15 at the museum on the Upper East Side. The exhibition is included with general admission, which costs $20/person. Local judges awarded honors to the top-placing entries, but everyone can vote on their favorite for the People's Choice award.\n\nAdvertising\n\nYou’ll get a kick out of this holiday stalwart, which still features Santa, wooden soldiers and the dazzling Rockettes. In recent years, new music, more eye-catching costumes and advanced technology have been introduced to bring audience members closer to the performance.\n\nIn the signature kick line that finds its way into most of the big dance numbers, the Rockettes’ 36 pairs of legs rise and fall like the batting of an eyelash, their perfect unison a testament to the disciplined human form. This is precision dancing on a massive scale—a Busby Berkeley number come to glorious life—and it takes your breath away.\n\nThe Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree (NYC’s pride and joy) is a beaming and brilliant symbol of the holiday season. Tourists and native New Yorkers alike sure do love this towering tree.\n\nThe tree will be lit daily from 5am to midnight. On Christmas Day, the tree is lit for 24 hours and on New Year’s Eve it is lit from 5am to 9pm. The tree goes dark for the season at 10pm on January 13.\n\nMore than 50,000 multi-colored LED lights wrap around the branches. It's topped with a three-dimensional Swarovski star that weighs 900 pounds and sparkles in 3 million crystals. Architect Daniel Libeskind designed the stunning star in 2018.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Winter Village at Bryant Park is back in all its holiday glory. On the grounds you can peruse more than 180 shopping and food kiosks—all at one of the best NYC parks. Expect loads of handmade, unique and New York City-specific gifts for your family and friends. Work up an appetite at the 17,000-square-foot ice-skating rink and then fill up at the rinkside pop-up restaurant called The Lodge for festive cocktails and hearty food.\n\nDon't miss the Small Business Spotlight booth, which features local minority-owned businesses.\n\nThe Winter Village will be open through March 3, 2024.\n\nAn institution housing a colossal blue whale, massive dinosaur skeletons and thousands of glittering gemstones couldn't display just any ordinary holiday decor, of course. Instead, the American Museum of Natural History proudly presents a spectacular origami holiday tree each year.\n\nAbout 2,000 colorful origami animals decorate the 13-foot-tall tree, a tradition dating back more than 50 years. Volunteers from around the world carefully fold the intricate ornaments, focusing on a theme that relates to the museum. This year's theme, \"Proboscideans on Parade,\" was inspired by the new exhibit \"The Secret World of Elephants.\"\n\nA cast of characters joins the elephants, including woolly mammoths, dinosaurs, blue whales, butterflies, zebras, birds and many others representing iconic museum exhibits.\n\nFind the tree in the Ellen V. Futter Gallery on the first floor. Visiting the tree is included with museum admission.\n\nAdvertising\n\nTurns out, getting to the North Pole isn't so tough after all. \"The Santa Clauses' Winter Wonderland,\" a portal to Santa Claus' hometown, has opened at The Rooftop at Pier 17 in the Seaport.\n\nTypically a concert venue, the rooftop has been transformed into an immersive holiday experience inspired by Disney's \"The Santa Clauses.\" Expect hot cocoa, skating and plenty of fun photo opps.\n\nFind all the fun at 89 South Street through January 7, 2024. Tickets start at $25/person. Most activities are hosted outdoors, so be sure to bundle up in your coziest winter attire.\n\nThe Oculus is getting into the holiday spirit with a new activation called Christmas House NYC. Visitors can walk through more than a dozen themed rooms featuring snow, holiday movies, karaoke and more.\n\nThis all-ages walk-through experience has tickets available through January 2 priced at $40/adult and $35/child.\n\nInteractive activities include The Snowball Fight Room, where visitors can revel in snowfall and even toss snowballs. Inside the Snow Lodge Movie Theater, Elf plays on repeat on a 25-foot screen. The Blockbuster Video Room stirs nostalgia with its lifelike movie counter and VHS tapes. Other rooms include the Christmas Karaoke Party Room and The Holidays Inn Hotel, all decorated in Christmas splendor.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe holiday decor experts at American Christmas have opened their doors to the public for a holiday extravaganza featuring 100,000 lights, 100 captivating animatronics and figurines in nine uniquely themed areas. This larger-than-life display is sure to dazzle. Tickets are on sale here for the experience just outside of NYC in Mt. Vernon.\n\nThis is the third year that American Christmas has hosted its public Holiday Lane event, and this year promises to be bigger and brighter than ever. Twice the size of last year's display, this iteration of Holiday Lane at American Christmas begins with a chance to write a note to Santa. Then, meet some reindeer, visit a land of sugar plum fairies, peek into the elves' quarters and explore the icy beauty of the Arctic.\n\nFinally, end the trip at an area called Santa's Take Off where Santa's sleigh gets ready for its journey around the world. Santa himself will even be there on select days.\n\nNew York City has plenty of on-the-reindeer’s-nose holiday pop-up bars to immerse yourself in the spirit of the season—with spirits—throughout the most wonderful time of the year. From a tropical tiki theme to a Hanukkah pop-up bar, get into the holiday spirit(s) at these spots.\n\nAdvertising\n\nHalf the fun of holiday shopping in New York is ogling the tricked-out window displays along Fifth Avenue that pop up to coincide with the merriest, spendiest time of the year.\n\nEvery year, stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Macy's and Bloomingdale's create magical holiday window displays. Tourists aren't the only ones who can enjoy these festive showcases in Herald Square and Fifth Avenue—even for locals, they hold a dreamy nostalgia that only comes once a year.\n\nMiracle on 9th Street and Sippin' Santa's decked-out editions are popping up with delectable drinks, holiday cheer and lots of fun.\n\nIn NYC, Miracle on 9th Street is now open at The Cabinet Mezcal Bar in the East Village, and Sippin’ Santa is at Lower East Side neighborhood bar Thief.\n\nAnd as usual, the Miracle and Sippin' Santa holiday mug collections will also be making their return, with limited-edition glassware available for purchase exclusively at the pop-ups.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Dyker Heights Christmas Lights display has definitely earned its stripes as one of the best New York attractions. What’s not to love about all that razzle-dazzle to get you in the Christmas spirit?\n\nThe Brooklyn neighborhood is home to the most over-the-top Christmas light decorations with life-sized Santas, sleighs, snowmen and some houses even bump Christmas carols from loudspeakers. Crowds of all ages flock to the Kings County neighborhood to wander down the multiple blocks and avenues.\n\nFor the first time ever, Luna Park in Coney Island will be open during the winter for a new event called Frost Fest.\n\nThe park will be open on select dates through January 7 with legendary rides on site, a skating rink, holiday lights, shopping and Santa.\n\nTickets for the experience—offered on select weekdays and holidays, plus Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays—are now available here.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNYC is packed with holiday markets every fall with holiday spirit and unique gifts. While fancy Christmas window displays may entice you, NYC's holiday markets offer a chance to shop local. With everything from clothing to holiday ornaments to artwork, there's something for everybody on your holiday shopping list.\n\nShopping for the perfect gift doesn't have to be stressful; make it fun at these holiday markets.\n\nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year. New York lights up into a winter wonderland each year with Christmas trees, holiday window displays and Christmas lights. Even the most tourist-averse New Yorkers have to admit that it’s a pretty spectacular sight. Get the most out of the holidays with our guide to the best holiday sales and holiday gift ideas, Christmas movies to watch with the family and plenty of festive things to do including Bryant Park ice skating, tree lightings and more.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe pressure is always immense to have a good time on New Year’s Eve—and have a good time you will. Ring in 2024 with a raucous amount of drinks and a good dinner with a champagne toast, or a New Year’s Eve fireworks display. You’ll find these celebrations and more with our essential guide to New Year’s Eve in New York. Keep checking back for ticket announcements—we’ll be updating this page with new events from now through December 31.\n\nThe McKittrick Hotel is home to the world-famous production of Sleep No More, a “site-specific, immersive experience” that blurs the line between audience and actor, stage and seating. It began previews in March 2011 and has been continuously extended over the past decade.\n\nBut as the lights fade out on its 5,000th performance, in January 2024, Sleep No More will conclude its nearly 13-year run. The pioneering performance has hosted over two million guests and has a sister run still ongoing in Shanghai, China.\n\nGo see the show this month before it closes; here's our guide to making the most of the experience.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute’s fall 2023 exhibition will be a celebration of female designers and women-led fashion houses, curated from the museum’s permanent collection.\n\nOn view at The Met from December 7, 2023, through March 3, 2024, the exhibit will showcase about 80 objects documenting the fashion work of more than 70 makers, tracing the history of influential women-led fashion houses from the 20th century until today.\n\nExpect to learn about pioneering female designers and their more famous successors, with work from Rei Kawakubo for Comme des Garçons, Adèle Henriette Nigrin Fortuny, Gabriela Hearst, Ann Lowe, Claire McCardell, Pia Davis and Autumn Randolph for No Sesso, Miuccia Prada, Madeleine Vionnet, Vivienne Westwood, and many more, on view. Iconic pieces by well-known designers will also be on display, including garments by Sarah Burton, Gabrielle Chanel, Ann Demeulemeester, Elizabeth Hawes, and Jeanne Lanvin.\n\nInside a venue dating back 100 years into the past, a new art show explores a question of the future: How can human creativity and artificial intelligence coexist?\n\nARTECHOUSE, located inside an old boiler room at Chelsea Market, is set to debut its latest digital art exhibition, “World of AI·magination,” on December 1; tickets are on sale here starting at $21/person. To create the exhibition, ARTECHOUSE Studio developed original visual elements with generative AI systems. Designers hope to inspire visitors to consider AI as a \"creative associate rather than a mere tool for innovation.\"\n\nWorld of AI·magination centers around a 20-minute cinematic experience with six scenes. One scene, called the Library of Magical Portals, features colossal books brimming with dreams and algorithms. Another scene called Symphony of Illusions constantly morphs, while the Infinite Maze immerses visitors into multiple parallels.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAndy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, two figures that all but defined the city's downtown art scene in the 1980s, are in the spotlight at this new gallery show. In 1984, the artists' collaboration officially kicked off, one that yielded close to 160 canvases.\n\n\"Basquiat x Warhol,\" a traveling show from Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, France, focuses on the unique collaboration between the two. See it at Brant Foundation in the East Village (421 East 6th Street) November 1 through January 7, 2024.\n\nTickets are now on sale right here.\n\nPainter Marc Chagall's lusciously vibrant works of art come to life in a new immersive experience at Hall des Lumières. Titled \"Chagall, Paris-New York,\" the exhibition explores the prolific painter who defied labels.\n\nHis works are projected in a larger-than-life scale, taking over walls, ceilings and even the floor of the ornate bank-turned-exhibition hall located at 49 Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan. “Chagall, Paris-New York” is now on view through 2024 with adult tickets starting at $30. In addition to the Chagall works, Hall des Lumières is also displaying works by Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nAdvertising\n\nMany museum-goers simply breeze through this brown room, barely giving a second thought to the unusual-looking walls around them. But if you go, take a moment to pause, to look more closely—and to even smell. Because this room is tiled entirely in chocolate.\n\nEd Ruscha, an artist known for his Pop and conceptual works, first created “Chocolate Room” in 1970 as part of the Venice Biennale. He found local chocolate paste and screen printed it onto hundreds of sheets of paper. Then he hung each one like tiles or shingles from floor to ceiling. Ruscha was doing “immersive art” before that was even a buzzword.\n\nIn addition to Chocolate Room, don't miss the rest of Ruscha's work presented as part of MoMA's retrospective titled \"ED RUSCHA / NOW THEN.\" The exhibition is the most comprehensive retrospective of the artist's work ever shown. It's on view through January 13, 2024.\n\nWhen Komal Shah starting collecting art more than a decade ago, she noticed something startling: \"The art world does not treat women artists equally\" compared to male artists.\n\nShe decided to do something about that by founding the Shah Garg Foundation with her husband, Gaurav Garg. The organization champions artwork by women and seeks to remedy the imbalances facing marginalized artists. Nearly 100 pieces of art from their collection are now on view in a powerful and diverse show called \"Making Their Mark: Art by Women in the Shah Garg Collection\" in Chelsea (548 West 22nd Street). It's free to visit through January 27, 2024; hours are Tuesday-Saturday, 11am-6pm.\n\nThe expansive exhibition fills two stories with stunning works by artists including Firelei Báez, Cecily Brown, Judy Chicago, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Mary Weatherford, Anicka Yi, and many others. The show features paintings, drawings, textile works, sculptures and mixed media pieces by significant artists from the last eight decades.\n\nAdvertising\n\nLong before Pablo Picasso's works made it to major American museums, an art collector in Brooklyn identified the artist's talents and believed his works should be displayed. In fact, he wanted to hang Picasso's works on his very own walls.\n\nIn 1910, Hamilton Easter Field commissioned Picasso to adorn a room in his Brooklyn Heights home with murals, but Picasso didn't finish the works before Field died. Now, for the first time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is bringing together six paintings linked to the commission. \"Picasso: A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn\" is now open and runs through January 14, 2024.\n\n\"It's an important aspect of Picasso's work that has been not researched on that level, has been not known before we embarked on this project,\" The Met's director Max Hollein said. \"I hope the exhibition will be as revelatory to our audience as it has been to us.\"\n\nFor three months in the summer of 1921, Pablo Picasso worked out of a makeshift garage studio in Fontainebleau, France, where he created both cubist and classical masterpieces. Now, for the first time since then, the works are reunited in a sprawling new exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nMoMA's \"Picasso in Fontainebleau,\" on view through February 17, is the latest show in NYC presented as part of the international Picasso celebration marking 50 years since his death.\n\nA garage space measuring in at 20 by 10 feet served as Picasso's studio that summer. Using the exact dimensions, MoMA created a room with the garage's footprint, so museum-goers can step inside and imagine creating such large paintings in a small space.\n\nIn that garage, Picasso created the cubist \"Three Musicians\" with colorful geometric shapes as well as the classical \"Three Women at the Spring\" with references to Greco-Roman antiquity. For the first time in more than a century, MoMA has reunited these works.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIf scrolling through social media to see pictures of cute dogs and hilarious cats is a favorite pastime of yours, then this new exhibit at Fotografiska is a must-see. Titled \"Best in Show,\" the exhibition explores the role of furry and feathered friends in our culture through more than 100 incredible photographs.\n\nPhotos show dogs in a variety of situations, like getting baths, posing, partying, shaking their heads and even dressing up in fancy “cones of shame.” Cats, rats, bunnies, birds, reptiles, turtles and fish get their moment in the spotlight, too, at this exhibition on view in the Flatiron District through January 2024.\n\nThe show showcases works by 25 renowned photographers. That includes William Wegman's famed Weimaraner portraits, pictures by Sophie Gamand of dogs taking baths and images by the world's first professional cat photographer Walter Chandoha. From candid photos of pets at home to posh portraits of pups at the Westminster Dog Show, each image explores the unbreakable bond between humans and their pets.\n\nFollowing successful runs in Madrid, Milan, Paris and Rome, the Balloon Museum is officially set to take over Pier 36 in The Seaport this fall.\n\nSet in and outside of the 80,000-square-foot space, the new cultural destination is making its debut with an exhibit titled “Let’s Fly,” scheduled to run through January 14, 2024.\n\nVisitors are encouraged to interact with the installation, touching and feeling the various pieces exhibited. In terms of actual pieces, you can expect a 4,000-square-foot ball pit, inflatable lava lamps and the sorts of infinity rooms that you'll itch to post about on Instagram.\n\nTickets for the show are available right here.\n\nAdvertising\n\nBeneath the cobblestone streets of the Seaport, secrets hid underground for decades—until now, that is. A new walking tour led by the South Street Seaport Museum unearths the neighborhood's freaky and fascinating facts.\n\nThe museum's \"Sinister Secrets of the Seaport\" whisks visitors back in time for a 90-minute walking tour full of true crime tales about theft, organized crime, murder and even pirates. Tours are available on December 9, 10, 16, and 17 for $40/adult. Whether you're a true crime buff or you're just soaking up the Halloween spirit, these tours make for a memorable afternoon in a historic neighborhood.\n\nMajestic, incredible elephants are getting the spotlight in a new exhibit at The American Museum of Natural History. \"The Secret World of Elephants\" showcases both modern and ancient elephants, offering visitors a chance to see a full-scale model of a woolly mammoth, learn about what elephants eat, touch an elephant's tooth, listen to elephant calls and more.\n\nThe exhibition is now open in the museum’s LeFrak Family Gallery.
