        "text": "The Department of Environmental Conservation is asking that the federal Environmental Protection Agency design and conduct remedial efforts to eliminate contamination of storm sewers which lie outside of the barrier drain system. In effect, the storm sewer lines would be plugged in the vicinity of the four corners of the Love Canal. Contaminated sediment would be removed for burial in a chemically secure landfill and the sewer lines would be tied to the existing barrier drain to create an expanded leachate collection system. The surface waters would be directed to storm sewer lines in neighboring streets.\n\nOther problems still to be addressed include the clean-up of toxic contamination (including dioxin) in Black and Berkholtz creeks near the canal; evaluation of new disposal technologies for destruction of waste sludge generated at the Love Canal treatment facility and currently stored on-site; and site restoration, including demolition of vacant homes directly abutting the landfill.\n\nRelocation Of Residents\n\nThe State Department of Transportation, with assistance from other task force agencies, coordinated the Love Canal relocation process, including temporary relocation of residents and purchase of area homes.\n\nThe day following the Commissioner of Health's August 2, 1978, Order recommending temporary relocation of pregnant women and children under two years of age from the first two rings of homes, interviewers from the regional offices of the departments of Transportation and Social Services opened an on-site relocation assistance office at the 99th Street School.\n\nOn August 7, the Governor expanded the State's relocation effort, directing permanent evacuation of all homes in the two rings immediately adjacent to the Canal regardless of family makeup. This directive called for the immediate relocation of 239 families to interim housing, a subsequent move to permanent housing of their choice, and provision of all relocation benefits which normally accompany State acquisition of right-of-way. The relocation effort was to be carried out with minimum economic burden to the affected families.\n\nTo accomplish this unprecedented undertaking, personnel with real property experience from around the State were called in to inventory available housing, interview residents to determine housing needs, survey and appraise homes, arrange for families to rent and move into temporary housing, provide security for the empty houses, purchase the 239 Love Canal homes in Rings I and II at fair market value, and help families make the move to permanent housing. The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the United Way of Niagara Falls also assisted in the relocation.\n\nBy January 1979, virtually all families living in Rings I and II had been temporarily relocated, and 232 purchase agreements had been signed by the State with the owners of eligible Love Canal properties.\n\nTo further assist Love Canal homeowners and help stabilize the area, the State approved a $1.2 million support program, including $1 million in State aid for a five-year graduated property tax relief program and a $200,000 contract with United Way of Niagara Falls to provide psychological and family counseling for area residents.\n\nBased on continuing evaluation of environmental and health data, the Department of Health, on February 8, 1979, issued a supplemental order recommending that all pregnant women and children under the age of two (residing between 97th Street and 103rd Street and from Frontier Avenue north to Colvin Boulevard) be temporarily relocated away from the area. The Governor modified the order to apply to entire families with pregnant women or young children and to include residents of the LaSalle Development, a low income housing project west of the Love Canal. Approximately 49 families became eligible for this temporary relocation and, of these, 45 were temporarily moved from the area at their request.\n\nIn response to a Show Cause Order filed by the Homeowners Association, a State Supreme Court Justice, in June 1979, ordered temporary relocation at State expense for area residents who claimed to be suffering illness or having breathing difficulties associated with site excavation work to lay the peripheral drains around the landfill. Throughout the summer and fall, particularly on smoggy days, varying numbers of area residents requested and were given temporary relocation to hotels or to nearby Niagara University because of such alleged illness or discomfort.\n\nDuring July 1979, heavy rains, accompanied by hot, humid weather resulted in widespread chemical odors emanating from the landfill. The remedial construction project was proceeding in the central and northern sectors and extensive repair work was being done on the southern sector.\n\nOn August 24, the Homeowners Association Board of Directors met with the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation to discuss their concerns that, as a consequence of the remedial construction, chemicals were being volatilized into the air, causing many area residents to experience acute respiratory symptoms. The Commissioner agreed to modify the site safety plan and to restrict the time during which contaminated soils would be exposed to the atmosphere during excavation work.\n\nIn the following few days, 45 persons checked into area hotels complaining of illness. By September 1, 1979, the number of Love Canal residents in hotels had grown to over 200; a total of 230 people spent all or part of Labor Day weekend at the Stella Niagara House, while an additional 100 people reportedly stayed with relatives.\n\nThe State attempted to establish a policy, effective September 11, requiring a written physician's statement pertaining to illness for any resident seeking 48- hour relocation due to Love Canal remedial construction work. Residents subsequently complained that area doctors refused to provide such written statements. The State Health Department rejected 112 statements signed by the same physician on the same day, all citing \"acute depression\" as the reason for relocation.\n\nOn September 13, the State Supreme Court instructed the State task force to continue relocating elderly and severely ill Love Canal residents without the required medical certification and to extend temporary relocation to September 18, 1979, for the 112 individuals whose physicians' statements had been rejected to allow such individuals to obtain and submit credible physicians' statements.\n\nThe number of persons in hotels stabilized by September 19 at about 425 individuals, all of whom had submitted physicians' affidavits which were acceptable to the State Health Department. The cost to the State for food and lodging of these individuals reached approximately $7,500 per day during September.\n\nBy mid-October 1979, three relocation programs were in progress at the Love Canal, with the following status:\n\nPermanent Relocation Program for Rings I and II: of the 239 families eligible, 237 closings on property parcels had been completed.\n\nTemporary Relocation Program for Families with Pregnant Women or Young Children: of the 49 eligible families, 33 sought and had been placed in apartments or other, longer term housing.\n\nTemporary Relocation Based on Illness Associated with Remedial Construction Work: 91 families were being maintained in temporary accommodations.\n\nOn November 5, the last of the deep excavations at the construction site was completed and the temporary relocation program ordered by the Supreme Court was terminated; residents in hotels were notified that temporary housing in hotels would no longer be provided at State expense.\n\nIn response to a request from the Governor, President Carter declared a second federal emergency at Love Canal on May 22, 1980, paving the way for federal aid to relocate the more than 700 families who still lived near the former toxic waste dump. Under the terms of the presidential order, the federal government would pay for the evacuation and temporary housing of such families until it was determined whether the area was safe for their return.\n\nStating that the federal declaration did not go far enough, the Governor again asked for outright federal purchase of Love Canal homes. The White House responded that permanent relocation was not provided for under the Federal Disaster Relief Act and the cost of temporary housing could be borne only up to one year. There was also a provision for State sharing of costs.\n\nOn May 23, temporary relocation of Love Canal families to area hotels began for the third time. Within three days, the State Department of Transportation relocation team, again activated, reported that 338 applications for relocation had been received; 184 families had been relocated into hotels and 10 more into private accommodations.\n\nOn July 3, 1980, the U.S. Congress approved emergency appropriations allowing the President to spend up to $20 million on relocation of Love Canal area families. The measure was an amendment to the Emergency Appropriations Bill (co-sponsored by Senators Javits and Moynihan of New York) which removed legal barriers to federal participation in permanent relocation. Following several weeks of negotiations, terms of a State/federal financial agreement were finalized. The federal government would provide a $7.5 million grant and a $7.5 million advance to New York State for the acquisition of Love Canal properties. The $15 million total would be administered by the previously created Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency, which would act as agent for purchase of eligible properties and direct the revitalization of the area.\n\nThis unprecedented agreement was signed by the Governor and President on October 2, 1980, at ceremonies in Niagara Falls. On November 14, 1980, the third temporary relocation program ceased and on the following day the first closing under the State/federal buy-out program of Love Canal homes took place. By April 16, 1981, 257 homes out of a possible 550 had been purchased and 132 families who formerly lived in the LaSalle Housing Development had been permanently relocated.\n\nLitigation\n\nIn the aftermath of the Love Canal environmental emergency, numerous lawsuits were filed by people claiming to have suffered health and financial losses as a result of the landfill.\n\nMore than 640 residents of the Love Canal area have filed lawsuits against Hooker Chemical & Plastics Corporation in the Supreme Court, Niagara County. The dollar claims in these lawsuits total between $12 and $14 billion dollars in damages.\n\nAbout five percent of these claimants also have filed Notices of Intent to File Claim in the New York State Court of Claims, a preliminary step in claiming monetary damages from the State of New York; 50 of these Notices of Intent claim a specific amount of damage from the State, which alone totals $232,000,000. Most of these claims are based on alleged negligence and nuisance conditions, including allegations of the State's failure to inspect specific sites or conditions or to warn residents of potential health hazards.\n\nPrior to the commencement of each phase of the Love Canal remedial construction work, a group of individual residents and the Love Canal Homeowner's Association sought to obtain an injunction against the State to preclude construction work until all residents were moved from the area. These actions were largely unsuccessful, however, temporary relocation was ordered for residents who presented physicians' statements certifying health problems which could be aggravated by construction activities.\n\nIn December 1979, the U.S . Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Hooker Chemical & Plastics Corporation for damage to the environment due to Love Canal as well as financial damages incurred by the United States for necessary emergency measures. The claims asserted by the federal government cite violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Federal Common Law of Nuisance, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act. In addition to monetary damages the case seeks injunctive relief which would require Hooker Chemical Corp. to clean up toxic substances which have migrated from the landfill and to prevent further chemical migration from the site.\n\nThe State of New York initially filed its claims against Hooker Chemical on April 29, 1980, in New York State Supreme Court. The original $635 million State suit was seeking recovery of up to $95 million incurred by New York State in taking emergency action at the Love Canal; $250 million for injury to air, land and water resources of the State; and an added $250 million in punitive damages.\n\nAs a result of a joinder motion by Hooker Chemical, granted in U.S. District Court, the State of New York and others became parties to the federal action. This ultimately resulted in the State lawsuit being stayed, pending resolution of similar issues in the federal action.\n\nThe Love Canal action now pending before the U .S. District Court for the Western District of New York is currently in the discovery phase. New York State, initially joined as a defendant in the federal suit, is now a co-plaintiff with the United States Government as a result of its motion to realign being granted in U.S. District Court. The current status of parties in the joint action is as follows:\n\nIn February 1980 the United States government served a subpoena duces tecum upon the State Health Commissioner requiring him to produce numerous documents related to the Love Canal, including health records of Love Canal residents obtained under promise of confidentiality for use in Health Department health studies. The Department of Health objected to the production of these records on the grounds that such would constitute a breach of the promise of confidentiality. While the U.S. District Court has not decided the issue, the judge has granted the Health Department a time extension to seek permission from the residents themselves for release of their confidential medical records."
