        "text": "Like so many good stories, this one began at a dinner party. In 1917, socialite Maisie Plant was seated next to Pierre Cartier, scion of the esteemed jewelry house and architect of the brand’s American expansion. As legend has it Mrs. Plant cooed over the double strands of natural South Sea pearls she had ogled in the Cartier store window, lamenting she couldn’t possibly spend $1.5 million on a necklace. So savvy Mr. Cartier negotiated a trade: the pearls (and $100) in exchange for the Plant family’s Fifth Avenue manse—now the brand’s U.S. flagship.\n\nDesigned by Robert W. Gibson in 1905 and adapted as retail space by William Welles Bosworth in 1917, the Cartier mansion has undergone few transformations in the century since that fateful swap. (AD100 Hall of Famer Thierry Despont oversaw the most recent update in 2016.) But today, Cartier is celebrating a top-to-bottom reimagination by longtime collaborator Laura Gonzalez. “I try not to feel trapped by the history of a place but embrace it and build from it,” says the Parisian designer, who commissioned artists and artisans, both repeat and new partners, to contribute. “This building stands out between skyscrapers, frozen in time.”\n\nThe goal, explains Mercedes Abramo, Cartier’s North America president and CEO, was to create a more welcoming environment—less commercial, more convivial. Gonzalez, for her part, envisioned the space as a grand yet inviting apartment, in the spirit of the building’s residential origins. Windows were enlarged and revealed, while woodwork was whitewashed or upholstered in sumptuous fabrics. All throughout, bespoke sinuous seating invites visitors to stay awhile—and just maybe buy that Tank watch.\n\n“Each level has its own universe,” reflects Gonzalez. From the ground floor, guests climb the sweeping central staircase like the prancing panthers who grace the emerald carpeting (a wink to the brand’s famed Panthère collection). On the second floor, the coffered ceilings of Mr. Morton Plant’s onetime music room crowns the hospitality suite, which ushers VIPs to a private dining room. In the third-floor bridal rooms, accents of pink velvet match lightsof rose quartz—a symbol of love. The neighboring engagement jewelry VIP salon is appropriately Champagne-hued, with a glass light fixture that evokes a celebratory coupe and plaster walls that reinterpret the house’s joyful Tutti Frutti concept. The fourth floor boasts the most glamorous customer-service suite, featuring straw marquetry panels re-creating motifs from Cartier cigarette and vanity cases.\n\n“There are little ‘Easter eggs’ scattered throughout that reference Cartier flora and fauna, a one-of-a-kind Cartier Collection piece, or our beloved New York City skyline,” notes Abramo. A wall sculpture by Brooklyn-based ceramic artist Peter Lane, for instance, pays homage to Plant’s necklace, with pearl-like orbs that seem to hover midair, as if escaped from their strands. A mosaic of hand-cut travertine and quartz by French artist Béatrice Serre, meanwhile, evokes both an archival Art Deco bracelet and the nearby Chrysler Building.\n\nGonzalez was inspired by iconic depictions of Manhattan, from Stanley Donen’s Singin’ in the Rain to Martin Scorsese’s After Hours, as well as her own long walks through Central Park. Four client salons each conjure a season in the city. In the bridal suite, a neo-impressionist painting by François Mascarello depicts a poodle and a terrier on their morning constitutional in the urban Eden, the towers of the San Remo building rising behind them. “The final result strikes the perfect balance between elegant historical references and modern comfort,” Abramo says with admiration. “Everything tells a story.” At 653 Fifth Avenue; cartier.com"
