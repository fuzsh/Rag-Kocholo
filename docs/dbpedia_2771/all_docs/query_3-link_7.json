        "text": "The Harlem Renaissance had an indisputable impact on American culture, but chances are that you probably didn’t spend much time learning about it in school. That’s because, even though it shaped global literature, music, and art, Black Americans’ historical contributions have been systematically erased or gone unacknowledged for centuries.\n\nA groundbreaking exhibit opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art hopes to be a part of rectifying the erasure and celebrating Black artists and intellectuals in its newest exhibit. \"The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism.\"\n\nThe exhibit presents 160 works by Black artists from the Harlem Renaissance and delves into many different aspects of the movement, mostly through the lens of paintings and sculpture. You can get your tickets here; the show's on view through July 28.\n\nThe author and illustrator who ignited our childhood imaginations with tales of cuddly bunnies, mischievous squirrels and daring ducks is getting a well-deserved spotlight in NYC.\n\nThe wholesome and beautiful works of beloved children’s author and land conservationist Beatrix Potter are now on view at The Morgan Library & Museum through June 9.\n\n“Beatrix Potter: Drawn to Nature” is the most darling show in the city right now. The exhibition even features a delightful recreation of Potter’s home that you can actually sit and read in.\n\nNeed a laugh? The Second City—the renowned comedy club with locations in Chicago and Toronto—just opened in Brooklyn, and you will definitely laugh out loud there. The New York City venue, which opened on the legendary club’s 65th anniversary, offers hilarious live comedy every single night of the week.\n\nSome of the funniest names in comedy got their start at Second City. Just a few Second City alumni include: Bill Murray, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Amber Ruffin, Keegan-Michael Key, Chris Farley, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, and Aidy Bryant. You might just see the next comedy star on this stage.\n\nThe venue offers sketch shows and improv performances, along with a great restaurant and no drink minimums in a beautiful venue. Tickets start at $39.\n\nEat your way through Japan without ever leaving New York City at JAPAN Fes, the massive foodie festival, which is back and bigger than ever for 2024. The organization is hosting 30 outdoor events this year stretching from March through November in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. Event organizers say it's the largest Japanese food festival in the world, attracting 300,000 visitors and featuring 1,000 vendors every year.\n\nExpect dishes including takoyaki, ramen, matcha sweets, yakisoba, karaage, okonomiyaki, and lots more. They're even hosting a ramen contest and a konamon contest this year to crown the best of the bunch. Vendors hail from New York City, as well as other states and other countries.\n\nThe first JAPAN Fes of the season is on March 23 in the East Village.\n\nThe Easter Bonnet Parade & Festival is one of the highlights of Easter in NYC.\n\nThis parade is all about the hats—lavishly decorated, from the exquisite to the outlandish. Anyone is welcome to join, just show up near St. Patrick’s Cathedral at 10am on Easter Sunday to watch or saunter with the group up Fifth Avenue. The free tradition dates back to the 1870s, so you might even see some participants in period costumes. But the highlight is the elaborate bonnets, some of which are truly over-the-top.\n\nIf you want to participate, put on your creative thinking cap and get started on your work of chapeaux art ASAP.\n\nA historic performance venue is on the brink of making history again with its reopening.\n\nBrooklyn Paramount will officially reopen on March 27, with a new capacity of 2,7000 guests following a multi-million dollar renovation of the 100-year-old space.\n\nThe venue originally opened in 1928, as the world’s first theater to show talking movies and a hotspot for world-famous performers. Now, for the first time in 60 years, the venue will be a hub for live music again. Here's more info on upcoming shows tickets.\n\nBoard the gigantic aircraft carrier docked along the Hudson River for a trip to space this spring. The Intrepid Museum will soon host \"Apollo: When We Went to the Moon,\" the largest temporary exhibition in its four-decade history.\n\nThe exhibit, which runs from March 26 through September 2, blasts off into an exploration of the space race, both as a scientific feat and as an inspiration for millions. The new exhibit is included with museum admission.\n\nVisitors can climb aboard a lunar rover model, leave footprints on the Moon via a virtual moonwalk, and see Apollo artifacts. \"Apollo: When We Went to the Moon\" spans 9,000 square feet in the museum’s Space Shuttle Pavilion where it'll join the Space Shuttle Enterprise.\n\nWe predict a lot of tasty pasta in your future. That is if you snag tickets to this event.\n\nThe Standard East Village has partnered with the food-themed futuristic card deck, The Pasta Tarot, for red sauce celebrations throughout March.\n\nEvery Tuesday, the hotel's restaurant will become an Italian American oasis with red checkered tablecloths, flickering candelabras, and plenty of nosy nonna vibes for a four-course meal.\n\nReservations for the recurring event on March 5, 12, and 26 are open from 5pm-10:30pm via Resy.\n\n\"Giants,\" the Brooklyn Museum's latest exhibition, fits its name in many facets. First of all, the show relies on the art collection of two titans in the music industry, Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz (Kasseem Dean). Much of the artwork itself is massive, taking over major swaths of the museum. The exhibition features artists who have made and continue to make a significant impact on the art world and contemporary culture.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the exhibit encourages big conversations that celebrate Blackness, critique society, and imagine a collective future.\n\n\"Giants: Art from the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys\" runs through July 7, 2024. The show features 98 artworks by Black American, African, and African diasporic artists including Gordon Parks, Kehinde Wiley, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Mickalene Thomas, Hassan Hajjaj, Barkley L. Hendricks, Lorna Simpson, and Amy Sherald.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance changed the trajectory of American culture, and no other artist encapsulates the spirit of that era better than poet Langston Hughes. He wrote unapologetically about Black life at a time when segregation was law and few Black artists were allowed into the American cultural zeitgeist.\n\nThe Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture is honoring Hughes and his friendship with photographer, filmmaker, and U.S. Foreign Service Officer Griffith J. Davis in its exhibit \"The Ways of Langston Hughes.\" The free exhibit at the Schomburg Center's Latimer Gallery in Harlem will include photographs of Hughes and Davis, who met in Atlanta, as well as more of Hughes' friendships through letters, artwork and other memorabilia. See it through July 8.\n\nWhen Komal Shah starting collecting art more than a decade ago, she noticed something startling: \"The art world does not treat women artists equally\" compared to male artists.\n\nShe decided to do something about that by founding the Shah Garg Foundation with her husband, Gaurav Garg. The organization champions artwork by women and seeks to remedy the imbalances facing marginalized artists. Nearly 100 pieces of art from their collection are now on view in a powerful and diverse show called \"Making Their Mark: Art by Women in the Shah Garg Collection\" in Chelsea (548 West 22nd Street). It's free to visit through March 23, 2024; hours are Tuesday-Saturday, 11am-6pm.\n\nAs she donned the black robe for her role on the Supreme Court, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was known to adorn the traditional garment with a wide array of collars and necklaces.\n\nNow, her fashion is getting the spotlight in a new photography exhibit called \"RBG Collars: Photographs by Elinor Carucci.\" See it at The Jewish Museum on the Upper East Side through May 27, 2024.\n\nThe installation features two dozen photographs of the late justice’s collars and necklaces taken shortly after Ginsburg died in 2020. This is the first time the Carucci’s photographs are being shown at the Jewish Museum since the images were acquired in 2021.\n\nMiranda Priestly once famously said, \"Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.\" But at Color Factory, florals for spring are actually groundbreaking as the interactive art experience in Soho takes flowery themes to immersive new levels.\n\nColor Factory's \"Colors in Bloom\" is now open—exactly at the time when we could all mercifully use a break from the gray landscapes and cold nights.\n\nAt this all-ages venue dedicated to the art and science of color, visitors can stroll through a variety of different rooms, all decked out for spring. For example, there's the Central Park Confetti Room, complete with larger-than-life pink cherry blossoms inspired by the city's first sign of spring.\n\nTickets start at $38/person for the experience, which runs through mid-May.\n\nForget the gown, tux, and fancy shoes. For this new concert series at Carnegie Hall, stretchy pants, cozy sweaters, and comfy footwear is welcomed.\n\nThe iconic venue is hosting five intimate concerts this winter that combine elements of mindfulness and meditation with world-class musical performances. These hour-long Well-Being Concerts cost between $15-$30 and run through April.\n\nDuring the show, audience members are encouraged to get comfortable while reclining on floor mats and cushions. A host will share prompts, lead breathing exercises, and ask guests to share thoughts and reflections with their fellow audience members. Guest may even be encouraged to sing.\n\nThis month, bear from Grammy-nominated performer Nathalie Joachim who works in genres of pop, electronic, classical, and beyond. Tickets cost $15 for the show on March 15.\n\nInside a venue dating back 100 years into the past, a new art show explores a question of the future: How can human creativity and artificial intelligence coexist?\n\nARTECHOUSE, located inside an old boiler room at Chelsea Market, has debuted its latest digital art exhibition, \"World of AI·magination;\" tickets are on sale here starting at $21/person. To create the exhibition, ARTECHOUSE Studio developed original visual elements with generative AI systems. Designers hope to inspire visitors to consider AI as a \"creative associate rather than a mere tool for innovation.\"\n\nWorld of AI·magination centers around a 20-minute cinematic experience with six scenes. One scene, called the Library of Magical Portals, features colossal books brimming with dreams and algorithms. Another scene called Symphony of Illusions constantly morphs, while the Infinite Maze immerses visitors into multiple parallels.\n\nExplore \"The End of Fossil Fuel,\" the latest pop-up from the NYC Climate Museum. It's free to visit in Soho and offers a bevy of eye-opening activities for all ages.\n\nInside the gallery, a collection of maps will put climate change issues into perspective, alongside text panels about the history of the fossil fuel industry. The exhibits trace the origins of the climate and inequality crises and how we got to where we are today. Other activations include a sticker wall where visitors commit to specific climate actions and a kids' corner with books and drawing materials.\n\nFind the pop-up at 105 Wooster Street in Soho through April 30. The museum is free to visit and open to all. It's open Wednesdays-Sundays from 1-6pm.\n\nNew York City is full of free outdoor art that you don't even have to go to a museum to see. Sculptures, murals and photographs can be found in its parks, sidewalks and on its buildings!\n\nBest of all, it costs you nothing to pay a visit. Below, find the best outdoor art in NYC to brighten up even the coldest winter day.\n\nIt’s no secret that New Yorkers are stressed, but when it comes to unwinding, we’re pretty competitive about that too—that’s where the best spas in NYC come in. The city boasts some of the most luxurious spas in the country, but affordable spa treatments also abound. So get inspired with birthday party ideas in NYC or date night ideas in NYC and book yourself a treatment at one of our favorite New York City spas."
