To learn the identity of registered sex offenders on or near campus, or anywhere in Illinois, visit the Sex Offender Database. Once there, you can search by city, county or ZIP code. Our main campus is in River Grove (2000 N. 5th Ave., River Grove, IL 60171).\n\nTo locate offender addresses in relation to the campus you can use mapquest.com to identify surrounding streets.\n\nThe Triton College Police Department maintains a file on registered sex offenders who have disclosed that they are a student or staff member at Triton College. Any employee, student, prospective employee, prospective student or interested college community member may request to see a specific file. One must make an appointment with the Chief of Police or his/her designee, Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. - 4 p.m., not on holidays, to view a specific file.\n\nThe \"Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act\" (section 1601 of Public Law 106-386) is a federal law enacted on Oct. 28, 2000, that provides for the tracking of convicted, registered sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher education, or working or volunteering on campus. It was sponsored by U.S. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona and supported by Security On Campus Inc.\n\nThe Act amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require sex offenders already required to register in a state to provide notice, as required under state law, of each institution of higher education in that state at which the person is employed, carries on a vocation or is a student. The law requires that state procedures ensure that this registration information is promptly made available to law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction where the institutions of higher education are located and that it is entered into appropriate state records or data systems. These changes took effect Oct. 28, 2002. These requirements are tied to state eligibility for certain types of federal grant funding and must be implemented through state law.\n\nIt also amends the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act to require institutions of higher education to issue a statement, in addition to other disclosures required under that Act, advising the campus community where law enforcement agency information provided by a state concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained. These changes took effect Oct. 28, 2002, and this notice became a requirement beginning with the annual security report due Oct. 1, 2003.\n\nLastly, the Act amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 to clarify that nothing in that Act may be construed to prohibit an educational institution from disclosing information provided to the institution concerning registered sex offenders; and requires the Secretary of Education to take appropriate steps to notify educational institutions that disclosure of this information is permitted. This amendment took effect on Oct. 28, 2000."
