Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Every building and school I went to before the age of 13 has since been torn down,\" Gill told Business Insider. \"That's what gave me the feeling that I wanted to save whatever I could save. What actually interests me the most, rather than famous buildings that find their way into these paintings, are uncelebrated, unlandmarked, unremarkable buildings that otherwise would've been lost to history.\"\n\nGill sketched her streetscapes in pencil first, then loosely outlined the shapes with watercolor paints. Ink lines followed in a spontaneous process that she likens to scat singing.\n\n\"I can't tell you how I do them. It just happens,\" she said. \"It's amazing to me.\"\n\nGill's 16-year-old grandson, Declan, recently visited 10 of the same locations she painted decades ago to document how they've fared in the ever-changing city. Viewed together, the images present a fascinating portrait of streets that are never stagnant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJill Gill is an artist, author, and lifelong New Yorker whose watercolor paintings span 70 years of the city's history and streetscapes.\n\nHer grandson, Declan, visited 10 of the locations from paintings in her book, \"Site Lines: Lost New York, 1954–2022,\" to capture how much they've changed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGill painted Zabar's, an Upper West Side grocery store known for its bagels, smoked fish, and baked goods, in 1979.\n\nAs Declan's recent photo shows, Zabar's remains in the same location today, and has expanded into the neighboring storefronts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1969, the corner of 55th Street and Madison Avenue featured a haberdashery, a stationery store, and a needlepoint shop.\n\nNow, the block has been overtaken by 550 Madison Avenue, a 37-story office building made of pink granite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTenement buildings and local businesses spanned Third Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets in 1981.\n\nThe elliptical Lipstick Building, which was constructed between 1984 and 1986, replaced them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Helen Hayes Theatre on 46th Street once featured a bright, colorful facade decorated with terra cotta tile.\n\nThe theater was demolished in the 1980s during the construction of the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square, though it eventually found a new home in a theater on 44th Street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1968, Gill painted the east side of Third Avenue between 55th and 56th, including the original P.J. Clarke's bar and restaurant dating back to 1884.\n\nP.J. Clarke's is still around today. The owners refused to sell the building to the developer who built the neighboring 919 Third Avenue office tower. \"It fascinates me,\" Gill told BI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe corner of Park Avenue and 56th Street used to house the Drake Hotel, a four-story townhouse, and the American Bible Society.\n\nAt 96 stories tall, 432 Park Avenue has dominated the block since its completion in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGill painted the Museum of Modern Art as it looked in 1979 on what she called a \"charming block\" featuring brownstones and mansions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGill's 1979 painting of Fifth Avenue depicts the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, the General Motors Building, and Tiffany & Co.\n\nMany of the buildings remain in place today, aside from the luxury department store Bonwit Teller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonwit Teller was a famous Fifth Avenue landmark when Gill painted its storefront in 1979.\n\nDonald Trump bought the building for $15 million in 1979 and razed it in order to build Trump Tower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLascoff's, New York City's first licensed pharmacy, once occupied a four-story brownstone row house on 82nd Street and Lexington Avenue.\n\nWarby Parker took over the building, painting it charcoal grey but keeping the original sign advertising prescriptions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGill says \"Site Lines\" is her gift to New York, telling BI, \"New York is the city of my birth and of my life, and it will go on long after I am no longer here.\"\n\nRead next\n\nNew York City Then and Now Artist\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
