        "text": "With lounge access, built-in credits and many travel perks, The Platinum Card® from American Express is ideal for frequent travelers.\n\nThe card also has various lifestyle benefits that increase its worth and offset the sting of the annual fee. For instance, you can get up to $100 in Saks Fifth Avenue statement credit awarded every calendar year — up to $50 of which is awarded from January to June and another up to $50 of which is issued in the year's second half. (Enrollment is required.)\n\nThis use-it-or-lose-it credit resets at the end of this month and starts fresh July 1 for the second half of 2024.\n\nNow is your last chance to use your credit if you haven't already. Several shopping portals offer bonus cash back or points on Saks purchases. Some airline shopping sites also have bonus mileage awards for Saks purchases.\n\nIf you don't regularly browse the aisles at Saks Fifth Avenue, you might be afraid the racks are only filled with $1,000 sequined dresses and the like.

While these items are not always less than $50, some things from these brands are often discounted and fall within the $50-$100 range. Additionally, you can try the Saks sale section and sort from low to high prices to see items that start at $9.\n\nWhen shopping at Saks, don't forget to double dip by starting your purchase at a shopping portal, which can give you bonus points for every dollar spent.\n\nIf you haven't used your Amex Platinum Saks Fifth Avenue credit for the first half of 2024, do so soon before it resets July 1. Don't wait until the last few days, as items typically need to have shipped before your card is charged and the credit is registered on your statement.\n\nUntil then, happy shopping.\n\nRelated reading:"
