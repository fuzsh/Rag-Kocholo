        "text": "Academic Advisement\n\nYour advisor plays a significant role in helping you develop a plan of study that will enable you to achieve your academic and career goals. Be sure to consult with your advisor on a regular basis.\n\nStudents should ensure that all prerequisites have been met prior to taking advanced courses by checking with their program advisors. Sequencing requirements will vary depending on the degree program and concentration.\n\nSemester Course Load\n\nIt is strongly recommended that students not take more than eighteen (18) credits each semester; an advisor’s formal authorization is required to take more than eighteen (18) credits in a given semester. In addition, permission to take more than eighteen (18) credits per term is limited to students who have completed at least thirty-two (32) credits of work while matriculated at NYUSPS and who have maintained a minimum cumulative GPA (CGPA) of 3.0 or better. All students taking over eighteen (18) credits in a given semester are subject to extra tuition and fees. (DAUS students should refer to the Bursar's website for all tuition-related information.)\n\nAttendance Policy\n\nAlthough the administration of NYUSPS does not supervise attendance of classes, students are expected to attend all classes. Please be aware that some faculty take attendance into consideration in final grades. Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substantially met the requirements of the course, or who have been excessively absent, may be considered to have withdrawn unofficially and may be given the final grade of \"F.\" Students who miss class for medical reasons are required to notify their instructor of their absence and may be asked to produce a doctor’s documentation of treatment at the next class.\n\nStudents who plan to miss class for religious reasons are expected to inform instructors beforehand and to be responsible for assignments given during their absence.\n\nGrades\n\nGrading for undergraduate programs is by letter grade: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, and F.\n\nCourse and assignment grades will be made according to the following NYUSPS guidelines.\n\nComputing the Grade Point Average\n\nThe grade point average (GPA) can be obtained by determining the total of all grade points earned and dividing that figure by the total number of credits completed. For example, if a student has completed an 18-credit schedule and receives grades of A, A-, B, and C+, respectively, in four 4-credit courses and a B+ in a 2-credit course, the student’s semester GPA would be computed as follows:\n\n4.000\n\n(A)\n\nx\n\n4 credits\n\n=\n\n16.0\n\n3.667\n\n(A-)\n\nx\n\n4 credits\n\n=\n\n14.668\n\n3.000\n\n(B)\n\nx\n\n4 credits\n\n=\n\n12.0\n\n2.333\n\n(C+)\n\nx\n\n4 credits\n\n=\n\n9.332\n\n3.333\n\n(B+)\n\nx\n\n2 credits\n\n=\n\n6.666\n\nTotal grade points\n\n=\n\n58.666\n\nGPA=58.666 divided by 18=3.259. The total grade points (58.666) are divided by the number of credits earned (18) to obtain the GPA (3.259).\n\nNote: There are no A+, D-, or F+ grades.\n\nPass/Fail Option\n\nStudents can take a maximum of sixteen credits (16) on a Pass/Fail basis, and no more than one (1) course per semester. The grade of Fail “F” is calculated into the GPA. The grade of Pass “P” has no impact on the GPA.\n\nIn addition, the following restrictions by program are as follows:\n\nDivision of Applied Undergraduate Studies:\n\nThe Pass/Fail option applies only to elective courses.\n\nJonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality\n\nCourses with the TCHT1-UC prefix cannot be taken as Pass/Fail. All other courses can be taken as Pass/Fail.\n\nPreston Robert Tisch Institute for Global Sport\n\nCourses with the TCSM1-UC prefix cannot be taken as Pass/Fail. All other courses can be taken as Pass/Fail.\n\nSchack Institute of Real Estate\n\nCourses with the REBS1-UC prefix cannot be taken as Pass/Fail. All other courses can be taken as Pass/Fail.\n\nSpring 2021:\n\nA student who takes a semester-long course on a Pass/Fail basis must elect to do so by Wednesday, April 28, 2021. Once a student elects to take a class as Pass/Fail, the decision is binding and no letter grade will be issued. Students must meet with their advisors to complete the Pass/Fail form.\n\nFor summer sessions and short-session terms, please see your advisor for Pass/Fail declaration deadlines.\n\nStudents should adhere to pass/fail global policies and program deadlines when attending global study away sites. Contact your advisor via email to take the Pass/Fail option.\n\nIncomplete Grades\n\n\"Incompletes\" are reserved for unavoidable circumstances which prevent a student from finishing a course in a given term, and the nature of the course permits the faculty member to allow late completion. Incompletes are given at the discretion of the instructor in consultation with the department. The \"grade\" of Incomplete is thus subject to approval and is never automatic; it can only be issued to students who have completed at least 50% of the course work. The faculty member will determine what constitutes 50% of the course work.\n\nIn addition, an Incomplete Contract must be signed by the student, the instructor, and the academic chair. Students must submit a written request for an “Incomplete” to the instructor and secure a signed contract prior to the last day of class; if the written request is not made, the instructor will submit a final grade based on work completed to that point.\n\nIf the student's request for an incomplete is approved, the student must complete the necessary work by the date specified by the instructor: this date can be no later than the end of classes in the following full term (i.e., by the end of the spring term for a fall or January course; or by the end of the fall term for a spring or summer course).\n\nIf the required work is not completed and submitted by the deadline indicated on the Incomplete Contract, the grade of \"I\" will become an \"F.\"\n\nStudents who are out of attendance in the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one additional semester to complete the work. When a grade defaults to an “F”, students need to register and pay for the course again.\n\nStudents cannot graduate if they have an Incomplete in any course.\n\nRepeating a Course\n\nOnly courses with a grade of \"C-\" or lower may be repeated.\n\nIn the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who began their studies at NYUSPS prior to spring 2015: only the second grade, whether higher or lower, is computed into the cumulative grade point average. The initial grade, however, remains on the transcript.\n\nIn the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who began their studies or were re-admitted to NYUSPS in spring 2015 and thereafter: both grades will be recorded on the transcript and both grades will be computed into the cumulative grade point average.\n\nStudents may repeat a required course only once and will be dismissed from the program if a required course is not passed after the second attempt. In order for the grade of a repeated course to be included in the GPA and to be recorded on the transcript, students must register and pay for the course. Credit is earned one time only.\n\nRegistration and Schedule Changes\n\nAdding Courses\n\nThe deadline for adding a course for the fall and spring semesters is the end of the second week of the semester. For short-session terms, see the Registrar's Calendar.\n\nStudents adding courses during this time are expected to make up any work missed during the initial classes.\n\nTo make any changes to your academic program, including dropping or adding courses given at other schools at the University, you must access ALBERT. You can make scheduling changes to your program on ALBERT until the end of the second week of the semester. After the second week of the semester, you must visit the advising office to obtain authorization for any changes.\n\nDropping/Withdrawing from Courses\n\nThe deadline for dropping a course is the end of the second week of the semester. If you need to drop a course after the second week of classes, you must see your advisor. To find out the drop/withdrawal deadlines for short-session terms, see the Registrar's Calendar.\n\nOccasionally, students may withdraw from a course if, because of reasons beyond their control, they cannot continue. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript. Those courses dropped from the beginning of the third week through the ninth week of the term will be recorded with a grade of \"W.\" The grade of \"W\" is a Registrar's grade, without numerical value and is assigned when a student officially withdraws from a course. It is not computed in the student's GPA but may significantly impact the student's progress toward degree completion as well as the student's financial aid eligibility. Please be sure to consult with the Office of Financial Aid.\n\nA grade of \"F\" will be assigned at the end of the semester if a student ceases to attend a course without officially withdrawing. In addition, students who are ill or have a serious personal problem should contact their advisor immediately.\n\nA student is not officially withdrawn from a course until the Registrar's Office has been notified and the withdrawal recorded.\n\nFor the Refund Schedule, refer to the Bursar's Website.\n\nComplete Withdrawals\n\nStudents wishing to withdraw from all classes in the spring and fall semesters must log into ALBERT by the end of the ninth (9th) week of the semester. For the \"Complete Withdrawal\" deadlines for shorter-session terms, see the Registrar's calendar.\n\nA student who officially withdraws from all courses in a term may register for the following semester. If the student is unable to attend the semester following withdrawal, the student may request a Leave of Absence from the advising office.\n\nGraduate Course Registration\n\nA degree-seeking undergraduate student may be granted permission to enroll in graduate courses to earn credit applicable towards the undergraduate degree. The availability of a graduate course to undergraduate students is determined by the academic unit offering the graduate course\n\nStudents must meet all eligibility requirements as stated below in order to qualify for graduate-level coursework.\n\nEligibility Requirements:\n\nUndergraduate students may take a maximum of 16 credits at the graduate level. Graduate coursework used to meet undergraduate degree requirements may not also be counted to meet masters degree requirements.\n\nUndergraduate students must have an earned GPA of 3.0 to take graduate level courses, with 60 credits earned. Of these 60 credits, students must have completed at least 16 credits at NYU.\n\nUndergraduate students are required to meet any prerequisites for the course, or obtain permission of the department.\n\nUndergraduate students must work with advisors to determine how graduate level courses will apply to their current degree curriculum, and to facilitate registration in the course.\n\nThe number of credits taken as an undergraduate student–that are not being counted towards any degree requirement (major, minor, total credit) and can be counted towards future graduate work–is dependent on the admission and degree requirements of the graduate program. It is strongly recommended that if you want to utilize graduate courses taken as an undergraduate for a future graduate degree you contact advising in that program before enrolling in a course.\n\nEnrollment in courses outside of the School of Professional Studies must also observe the academic and registration policies of the host school.\n\nGrade Changes and Appeals\n\nGrade appeals are handled by the schools at New York University and will not be considered at the University level. It is the faculty's responsibility to evaluate the student's work in the classroom. To appeal a grade in an NYUSPS course, the student must objectively demonstrate that his/her grade is in error or that some documented extenuating circumstance was not taken into consideration.\n\nOnly final grades can be appealed.\n\nIf you receive a final grade in a course that you wish to appeal, you must first:\n\nReview the syllabus to ensure that you fulfilled the course requirements as to how the grade was calculated: assignments, attendance, final exam, etc., and the percentages assigned to each component.\n\nObjectively assess your attendance record. As partners in learning, students are expected to attend class.\n\nObjectively assess the quality of your class participation. If a student's grade appeal is based solely on a difference of opinion about class participation which, for example, may have been listed on the instructor's syllabus as worth 10 percent, only the instructor's evaluation will be considered.\n\nCheck that the work you submitted met the requirements enumerated by the instructor. For example, if you submitted a well-written and well-researched paper on the life of Plato for \"Issues in Philosophy,\" but the instructor specifically asked for a comparative study of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, the grade appeal would not be reviewed since you did not follow instructions as to what was required.\n\nIf after taking these steps, you believe a grade appeal is justified, the following levels of appeal are available at NYUSPS:\n\nLevel 1: Faculty\n\nContact the instructor within thirty (30) days after the grade is posted and discuss concerns before beginning the official grade appeal process. Students can reach their instructor by email or telephone number as given on the syllabus or, when available, by leaving a note in the instructor's departmental mailbox. If you do not receive a response from the instructor within two (2) weeks, notify your advisor.\n\nLevel 2: Written Appeal to the Director of Your Program\n\nIf the conversation with the instructor does not resolve the dispute, the student may begin the formal grade appeal process by writing a letter to the director of the program within 45 days of the grade being posted. The Academic Director or the Director's Designee will read the appeal, investigate, and determine a final grade, which may be the same as that determined by the instructor, higher or lower. A written decision will be rendered approximately one month after receipt of all required documentation for the appeal.\n\nLevel 3: Written Appeal to the Associate Dean\n\nIf after receiving the decision in writing from the Academic Director or Designee, the student remains in disagreement, the final step is to submit an appeal in writing to the Associate Dean within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Director's Level 2 Appeal response letter. Appeals must include:\n\nA memo to the Associate Dean indicating why the decision rendered by the program is being appealed.\n\nA copy of the decision letter received from the program.\n\nA copy of the supporting materials submitted to the program.\n\nThe final decision, which will be rendered by the Associate Dean within three weeks, will be the grade that appears on the student's official New York University transcript. The student must be prepared for a final decision that either preserves the original grade, is a higher grade, or lowers the original grade, since no further grade appeals of the same course will be considered.\n\nOnce a student has graduated and a degree has been awarded by New York University, a grade appeal will not be considered.\n\nDean's List\n\nThe Dean's List is an academic honor awarded to undergraduate students who achieve a semester GPA of 3.7 or better while taking a minimum of 8 credits. Incompletes are not permitted.\n\nSatisfactory Academic Progress\n\nGood Standing\n\nAt SPS students are in good academic standing during semesters in which their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is 2.0 or greater and they have completed at least 50% of the term hours attempted. Federal financial aid requires students to complete at 67% of the term hours attempted.\n\nAn inability to make Satisfactory Academic Progress will have an impact on your Financial Aid award. Be sure to contact the Office of Financial Aid and click on the link below to review the Financial Aid Eligibility Requirements.\n\nStudents must be in good academic standing for every semester in which they are enrolled or they are subject to being placed on academic probation. Students should discuss any questions they have regarding their academic progress and academic standing with their advisors.\n\nAcademic Probation\n\nStudents whose cumulative grade point average (CGPA) falls below a 2.0 or who do not successfully complete at least 50% of the cumulative hours attempted during a semester will be placed on Academic Probation and receive formal written notification. Students return to good academic standing and are removed from Academic Probation when they raise their CGPA to a minimum of 2.0 or better and successfully complete the required cumulative attempted hours by the end of the semester in which they are on Academic Probation.\n\nProbationary Status: If a student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum required cumulative GPA for more than one semester, either consecutive or nonconsecutive semesters, the student will be dismissed from the program.\n\nRestrictions While on Academic Probation: Students on Academic Probation are subject to certain conditions and restrictions. These restrictions will remain in place until the student's academic performance results in their returning to good academic standing.\n\nStudents on probation will not be allowed to register for classes for the semester following their probationary term, unless they have succeeded in achieving a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better during the probationary term. Additional restrictions include the inability to hold student government positions; needing permission to participate in competitions, study away, and any and all extracurricular activities outside of advisor-approved courses.\n\nStudents on probation:\n\nmust achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better during the term on probation with an advisor-approved course load;\n\ncannot receive any grade below a C or any grade of Incomplete;\n\nmay not withdraw from any course;\n\nmust meet with their academic advisors on a monthly basis.\n\nAll undergraduate students receiving federal or state financial aid or other forms of external financial aid are subject to specific regulations tied to terms of their award requirements.\n\nAcademic Dismissal\n\nA student whose performance falls into probationary status a second time in his/her academic career, either consecutive or nonconsecutive semesters, will be dismissed from the School. The Associate Dean of the program will make the dismissal decision and inform students in writing, as soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the semester. In addition, a student who fails a required course twice will be dismissed from the School.\n\nWhen students are academically dismissed, the Registrar will be notified and the designation \"Academic Dismissal\" will appear on their transcripts. Students who receive notice of academic dismissal after they have begun attending classes will be withdrawn from those classes and tuition and fees will be cancelled.\n\nStudents are not permitted to register for or attend classes while appealing an academic dismissal.\n\nAppeal of Academic Dismissal\n\nA student may appeal the academic dismissal decision to the Senior Assistant Dean of Student Affairs if they believe the dismissal was the result of an administrative error or if the student can offer compelling reasons for their falling out of good academic standing. The student must appeal to the Senior Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, in writing, within fifteen (15) days from the date of the dismissal decision letter. The written appeal must include a personal statement explaining the student's poor academic performance, reasoned argument why the academic dismissal decision should be reversed, and original documentation to corroborate all extenuating circumstances. Anticipated grade changes from outstanding Incompletes do not constitute evidence for an appeal to be granted.\n\nOnce the written appeal is received, the Senior Assistant Dean of Student Affairs has the sole discretion to determine whether an appointment or interview is necessary and, in any case, will communicate a written decision within fifteen (15) days after receiving the written appeal.\n\nStudents are not permitted to register for courses while appealing an academic dismissal.\n\nAppeal of Academic Dismissal to the Associate Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Success of the School (Final Decision)\n\nOnly after the dismissal has been appealed to the Senior Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and the dismissal upheld, may an appeal be submitted to the Associate Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Success of the School. The student must request an appeal to the Associate Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Success of the School within fifteen (15) days from the date of the appeal decision made by the Senior Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. The written request must include a copy of the original dismissal letter and a copy of the response upholding the dismissal from the Senior Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. Any new information in the student's defense must be submitted at the same time. Once the written appeal is received, the Associate Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Success or the Associate Dean's authorized Designee has the sole discretion to determine whether an appointment or interview is necessary and, in any case, will forward a written decision within thirty (30) days after receiving the appeal. Academic dismissals by the Associate Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Success of the School are final and there are no further avenues of appeal.\n\nAcademic Integrity Policy\n\nAll NYU School of Professional Studies students are expected to familiarize themselves with, and to comply with, the rules of conduct, academic regulations, and the established policies and practices of the University and the School. Student disciplinary matters are the jurisdiction of the Dean, or his/her Designee, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs.\n\nAcademic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy\n\nAll students are expected to be honest and ethical in all academic work. This trust is shared among all members of the University community and is a core principle of American higher education. Any breaches of this trust will be taken seriously. A hallmark of the educated student and good scholarship is the ability to acknowledge information derived from others. Students are expected to be scrupulous in crediting those sources that have contributed to the development of their ideas.\n\nIn the process of learning, students acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This development occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected—often required—to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do, and they must give credit for ideas, suggestions, and information that come from other sources. Since the standard of good academic, creative, and scholarly work is to incorporate one's own ideas, analysis, and synthesis along with the proper recognition of the work of others, students are expected to practice the skill of attribution in their writing. Students are expected to quote accurately and identify the origin of citations from others, as well as to acknowledge when ideas are dependent upon concepts developed from other sources. This process of attribution and referencing allows each individual to demonstrate how her or his understanding and ideas relate to an existing body of knowledge—and add to them. It demonstrates the values of academic integrity and systematic reflection and intellectual development. To do otherwise and not reveal sources constitutes plagiarism. And plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty.\n\nPlagiarism involves borrowing or using information from other sources without proper and full credit. Students are expected to demonstrate how what they have learned incorporates an understanding of the research and expertise of scholars and other appropriate experts; and thus recognizing others' published work or teachings—whether that of authors, lecturers, or one's peers—is a required practice in all academic projects. Students' own scholarly and creative work is strengthened when full and appropriate acknowledgement becomes routine.\n\nStudents must master the standard procedures for citations and using footnotes, endnotes, parenthetical references and/or bibliographies, as determined by the character of their assignments. It is an expectation that faculty members impress upon students that whenever their work is dependent upon the ideas, suggestions, phrasing, and data found in sources, a failure to acknowledge them and reference their influence—whether intentional or not—may be considered evidence of academic dishonesty and/or plagiarism. The NYU School of Professional Studies does not tolerate such behavior; and substantiated cases of plagiarism will result in serious sanctions including dismissal.\n\nConsequently, it is essential for every student to develop the habits of identifying sources and to learn and use the proper forms of citation.\n\nAny of the following acts constitutes an offense of plagiarism:\n\nUsing a phrase, sentence, or passage from another person's work without quotation marks and attribution of the source.\n\nParaphrasing words or ideas from another person's work without attribution.\n\nReporting as your own research or knowledge any data or facts gathered or reported by another person.\n\nSubmitting in your own name papers, tests, examinations, or reports completed by another person.\n\nSubmitting creative works, including images or reproduction of the creative works, of another person without proper attribution.\n\nSubmitting oral or recorded reports of another person without proper attribution.\n\nDownloading documents in whole or part from the Internet and presenting them as one's own.\n\nCiting a source that does not exist.\n\nOther offenses against academic integrity include the following:\n\nCollaborating with other students on assignments without the express permission of the instructor.\n\nGiving one's work to another student who then submits it as his or her own.\n\nSharing or copying answers from other students.\n\nCopying material from any digital resource/website during examinations (unless expressly authorized).\n\nUsing notes or other sources to answer exam questions without the instructor's permission.\n\nDestroying library or reference materials.\n\nSubmitting as one's own work a paper or results of research purchased or acquired from a commercial firm or another person.\n\nSubmitting original work toward requirements in more than one class without the prior permission of the instructor/s.\n\nStudents can assure the integrity of their work by:\n\nUsing quotation marks to set off words not your own.\n\nLearning to use proper forms of attribution for source materials.\n\nDoing your own original work in each course, without collaboration, unless otherwise instructed.\n\nCrediting use of published sources, the work of others, or material from the Web.\n\nAsking your instructors if you have questions about an assignment or the use of sources.\n\nTaking the NYUSPS Academic Integrity Tutorial at https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cXOWpY2UHSZyjAN\n\nTaking a class about proper citation/research skills at the Bobst Library. See nyu.libcal.com/\n\nReviewing relevant information at Bobst Research Assistance.\n\nAcademic Integrity Disciplinary Procedures\n\nStudents are subject to disciplinary actions for the following offenses which include but are not limited to:\n\nCheating\n\nPlagiarism\n\nForgery or unauthorized use of documents\n\nFalse form of identification\n\nAcademic Integrity Sanctions\n\nOnce a violation of the policy is detected, the faculty member will not issue a grade on the assignment or for the course until the case has been resolved. Students may not withdraw from a course once there has been an allegation of plagiarism.\n\nAfter a violation of the Academic Integrity and Plagiarism policy is confirmed, one or more of the following sanctions can be issued:\n\nRequired participation in a noncredit workshop or seminar on ethics or academic integrity.\n\nRequirement to take or retake the Academic Integrity Tutorial\n\nAn assigned paper or research project related to ethics or academic integrity\n\nStudent is issued a written warning or reprimand\n\nRequirement that the student redo the assignment\n\nIssue the grade of \"0\" on the assignment\n\nIssue the grade of \"F\" on the assignment\n\nIssue the grade of \"F\" in the course\n\nIssue the grade of \"F\" for the course; student cannot drop the course and the grade of \"F\" cannot be eliminated by retaking the course\n\nSuspension or dismissal\n\nSanctions cannot be appealed.\n\nAcademic Integrity and Plagiarism Judiciary Process\n\nI. Authority\n\nThe expectation of sound ethical behavior is of paramount importance at the NYU School of Professional Studies (\"NYUSPS\"). To uphold these standards, the School has established the NYUSPS Policy on Academic Integrity and Plagiarism (the \"Policy\") and the NYUSPS Judiciary Committee (the \"Committee\"). Students have the right to a fair and timely hearing in accordance with the NYUSPS Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Judiciary Process. The Dean of NYUSPS (or his/her designee) has the right to suspend a student at any time for cause.\n\nII. Jurisdiction\n\nA. The Committee has jurisdiction over academic disciplinary matters involving all students—whether visiting, matriculated, or noncredit—taking classes at NYUSPS in graduate, undergraduate, and continuing education academic programs. This jurisdiction includes, without limitation, any violations of the Policy.\n\nB. Upon entering NYUSPS each student is bound by the Policy. If there are questions of jurisdiction in any particular case, they shall be referred for decision to NYU's Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nIII. Membership of the Judiciary Committee and Panel\n\nA. The Chair of the NYUSPS Faculty Council’s Student Affairs sub-committee and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or his/her appointee, will establish the Committee to oversee issues of academic integrity and plagiarism cases. The Committee will consist of the following members:\n\ni. The Chair of the NYUSPS Faculty Council's Student Affairs sub-committee (the \"Committee Chair\");\n\nii. The Associate Dean of Student Affairs or his/her appointee (the \"Committee Designee\"); and\n\niii. Three members of the NYUSPS faculty.\n\nCases will be adjudicated by a panel, (the \"Panel\") which will be appointed, on a case-by-case basis, by the Committee Chair and the Committee Designee, and will consist of the individuals named above.\n\nB. If the Chair of the NYUSPS Faculty Council's Student Affairs sub-committee is unfilled or absent, the Committee Chair will be determined as follows:\n\ni. The Chair of the NYUSPS Faculty Council will select the Chair of the Committee from members of the NYUSPS Faculty Council’s Student Affairs sub-committee.\n\nIV. Procedure for Suspected Academic Integrity Policy Infractions\n\nA. The Associate Dean or Director of each academic program area/division will appoint an administrator of each respective academic program area/division (the \"Departmental Designee\") to review all allegations of Policy violations according to Section IV B (ii and iii) below.\n\nB. Once a faculty member suspects a violation of the Policy, the faculty member will immediately discuss the suspected violation with the student. After the faculty member has discussed the suspected violation with the student, there are three courses of action:\n\ni. If the faculty member determines that the student did not violate the Policy, the matter is closed and no further action is taken.\n\nii. If the faculty member determines that a violation of the Policy has occurred and the student immediately admits wrongdoing, the faculty member promptly informs the Departmental Designee verbally and also provides, in writing, a detailed account of the academic integrity infraction describing all relevant facts and circumstances.\n\niii. If the faculty member determines that there is a violation of the Policy and the student denies wrongdoing, the faculty member will immediately inform the Departmental Designee verbally and will also provide, in writing, a detailed account of the alleged academic integrity infraction describing all relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nC. After the Departmental Designee has received the evidentiary report from the faculty member, the Departmental Designee will make a final determination as to whether or not a policy violation has occurred. If the Departmental Designee concludes that no violation has occurred, the matter is closed and no further action will be taken. If the Departmental Designee concludes that a violation has occurred, he/she meets with the student and presents the alleged violation of the Policy. The student has two options:\n\ni. Complete the Academic Integrity Determination of Responsibility form, acknowledging the alleged policy violation. Within five business days, the Departmental Designee will then recommend sanctions in writing to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs that align with the scope and severity of the case based on NYUSPS sanction guidelines. The Departmental Designee will also provide all records to the Office of Student Affairs in accordance with Section IX herein.\n\nii. Complete the Academic Integrity Determination of Responsibility form, denying the alleged policy violation. The Departmental Designee will submit the alleged violation (the \"Case\") for Committee review in accordance with Section V.\n\nV. Submitting a Case for Committee Review\n\nThe Departmental Designee submits the Case and all evidence to the Committee Chair and the Committee Designee for formal review. After submitting the Case to the Committee Chair and the Committee Designee for formal review, the Departmental Designee is no longer involved in the judiciary process.\n\nVI. Preliminary Procedure\n\nA. The Committee Chair and the Committee Designee gather evidence that will be provided to the Panel. The following steps are taken in the evidence-gathering phase:\n\ni. The Committee Designee contacts the party alleging the violation (the \"Complainant\") and the person alleged to have committed the violation (the \"Respondent\") within five business days to explore the nature of the offense.\n\nii. The Committee Designee then asks the Respondent and Complainant to provide supporting documents and evidence within five business days. Examples of materials include:\n\n1. A copy of the course syllabus.\n\n2. A copy of all communications that address the allegations.\n\n3. A copy of the questionable content with highlights or other indications of sections of concern.\n\n4. A copy of original sources with highlights or other indications of authenticity.\n\n5. Correspondence.\n\n6. Other evidence that the Respondent or Complainant may deem relevant.\n\niii. The Committee Chair and the Committee Designee appoint a Panel (see Section III).\n\niv. The Committee Chair and the Committee Designee set a hearing date no later than 30 days after the case has been received for committee review.\n\nv. The Committee Designee prepares a Compilation of Findings report in approximately five business days after receiving materials from the Respondent and Complainant. The Compilation of Findings report is then shared with the Panel.\n\nvi. The Committee Designee notifies the Respondent and Complainant of:\n\n1. The specific violation;\n\n2. The Panel membership; and\n\n3. The date of the hearing.\n\n4. The Respondent and Complainant have two business days to send email notification if he/she feels that any Panel member is biased and should not serve on the Panel. An explanation of biases (positive or negative) should be included in the email statement.\n\nVII. Official Hearing\n\ni. Notice of the hearing date will be sent to the NYU email account of the Respondent and Complainant. Alternative hearing date requests should be directed to the Committee Chair and the Committee Designee with an explanation of unavoidable extenuating circumstances. The Committee Chair and the Committee Designee will consult to determine whether or not an alternative hearing date can be arranged.\n\nii. Respondents and Complainants have the option to bring Witnesses to the hearing: witnesses are defined as those individuals with first-hand knowledge of what has occurred. All witnesses (the \"Witness\" or Witnesses\") must be approved by the Committee Designee. The identity and relationship of Witnesses to the Respondent or Complainant should be provided to the Committee Designee no later than five business days prior to the hearing. A Witness roster will be shared with involved parties and the Panel.\n\niii. The Committee Designee invites the Respondent and Complainant to the hearing and notifies the Respondent and Complainant that they are responsible for notifying Witnesses of hearing details.\n\niv. In the event that a Panel member has a personal relationship with or bias against the Respondent or Complainant, the Panel member shall recuse him or herself.\n\nv. Attendance at the hearing proceedings is not required. The Panel has the power to render decisions based on the Compilation of Findings report, available testimony, and/or any supporting evidence.\n\nvi. Attendees at the hearing proceedings may include the Respondent, the Complainant, the Panel, Witnesses, advisor to the Respondent, advisor to the Complainant, the Committee Chair, and the Committee Designee.\n\nvii. A staff member will take the minutes, and the Committee Chair will convene and administer the proceedings in collaboration with the Committee Designee.\n\nviii. At the commencement of the hearing proceedings, the Committee Chair reads the allegation(s) statement, and the Respondent is offered the opportunity to respond to the allegations. After the Respondent responds, Panelists ask the Respondent questions based on evidentiary materials and commentary.\n\nix. Next, the Complainant has the opportunity to respond. After the Complainant responds, Panelists ask the Complainant questions based on evidentiary materials and commentary.\n\nx. Notarized Witness statements may be provided in lieu of physical attendance. Notarized statements must be provided five business days prior to the hearing date.\n\nxi. The Respondent and Complainant are each allowed to have one advisor present at the hearing for support and guidance. The advisor is not allowed to directly address the panel or directly participate in the hearing. The Committee Designee must be notified of the identity and relationship of the advisor at least five business days prior to the hearing.\n\nxii. The hearing deliberations proceed immediately after the hearing concludes. Each Panel member has one vote. A majority vote constitutes a valid decision.\n\nxiii. Unless additional information is required, the Panel makes a decision based on the preponderance of credible evidence. If the Panel finds the Respondent in violation of policy, the Committee Chair and the Panel will provide a sanction recommendation based on NYUSPS sanction guidelines to the Office of Student Affairs and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs will make the final decision.\n\nxiv. The Panel makes every effort to render a decision within three business days.\n\nxv. The staff member prepares the meeting minutes within five working days and delivers them to the Committee Designee and the program’s Academic Director.\n\nxvi. The Committee Designee informs the Respondent, the Academic Director of the student’s program, and the Complainant, when appropriate, of the decision by NYU email within two business days of the decision being rendered.\n\nVIII. Sanctions\n\nShould the Panel find the Respondent in violation of Policy, the Panel identifies proposed sanctions that align with the scope and severity of the case based on NYUSPS sanction guidelines. Proposed sanctions strike a balance between austerity and development. Proposed sanctions are submitted by the Panel to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs who makes the final determination. The Associate Dean of Student Affairs will determine the final sanction for the Respondent within 10 business days after receiving the proposed sanctions from either the Departmental Designee or the Panel.\n\nIX. Record-Keeping\n\nThe Committee Designee provides all records of disciplinary cases, proceedings, and sanctions to the NYUSPS Office of Student Affairs. The NYUSPS Office of Student Affairs will maintain records and files of all Cases and proceedings in a confidential manner. Confidentiality must be maintained in accordance with the Federal Educational Rights and Protection Act (FERPA). Documents will be retained in accordance with the timeline specified by the NYU Office of General Counsel.\n\nX. Rights and Obligations of Respondents and Complainants\n\ni. The Respondent is innocent until the Panel finds the Respondent in violation of Policy.\n\nii. The Respondent has the right to be informed of allegations.\n\niii. The Respondent and Complainant may have viewing access only to the Compilation of Findings report two business days prior to the hearing. Viewing access is granted in person, and by appointment only, during regular business hours. Requests to view the Compilation of Findings report must be sent to the Committee Designee.\n\niv. The Respondent and the Complainant have the right to be present during any testimony. The Respondent, Complainant, or Witnesses are not permitted to communicate directly during the hearing. Questioning will be directed to and posed by the Committee Chair.\n\nv. The Respondent and the Complainant have the right, but not the obligation, to testify at the hearing. The Respondent’s decision not to testify will not presume guilt upon the Respondent.\n\nvi. The Respondent and Complainant may consult with an advisor to assist in preparation for the hearing.\n\nTime to Complete a Degree\n\nStudents studying at the Schack Institute, the Tisch Center, and the Tisch Institute have eight (8) years from initial enrollment to complete their bachelor's degree. Failure to do so may result in academic dismissal. For students to complete a degree in four (4) years, it is recommended that students take thirty-two (32) credits per year.\n\nStudents studying in the Division of Applied Undergraduate Studies have five (5) years from initial enrollment to complete their associate's degree or ten (10) years to complete their bachelor's degree.\n\nResidency Requirement\n\nTo earn a bachelor’s degree at NYUSPS students must complete a total of 128 credits. A minimum of sixty-four (64) credits, must be completed at New York University.\n\nDivision of Applied Undergraduate Studies associate degree students, upon matriculation, must complete their degree requirements by taking all their courses from the DAUS associate degree curriculum.\n\nDivision of Applied Undergraduate Studies bachelors degree students, with an advisor's approval, may take a total of sixteen (16) credits of course work in other undergraduate schools or divisions of the University provided they are in good academic standing.\n\nAdvanced Standing\n\nAdvanced Placement Credits\n\nUndergraduate students may receive Advanced Placement or Higher Level International Baccalaureate credits toward the 128-credit degree requirement. If test results are a 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination, the student may receive college credit toward the degree and, if college credit is received, will not have to take the corresponding college-level course for credit. To qualify, the course must have an NYU course equivalent and be approved by the student's academic advisor. Courses used to fulfill any high school graduation requirements are not eligible. Students should see their advisor for details.\n\nIf a student registers for a course after receiving AP credit in that area, the student will lose the AP credit on the transcript. AP credits do not satisfy any major requirements.\n\nFor the International Baccalaureate (IB) examination, the School of Professional Studies recognizes higher level examinations passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard level examinations. Students must have official IB Examination scores sent directly to NYU Undergraduate Admissions from the International Baccalaureate Organization.\n\nStudents studying at the Schack Institute, the Tisch Center, and the Tisch Institute who are considering taking AP examinations should seek clarification of the policies in regard to a particular subject at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nStudents studying in the Division of Applied Undergraduate Studies should contact their academic advisor for more information regarding AP or IB examinations.\n\nNote: a 4 or 5 on any foreign language AP satisfies the Humanities Requirement or a free elective requirement.\n\nCollege Level Examination Program and Foreign Language Proficiency\n\nStudents studying in the Division of Applied Undergraduate Studies may also earn college credit by examination by completing the College Board Examination Program (CLEP) testing or by assessment through the SPS Foreign Language Proficiency Testing.\n\nFor details, please follow the link below.\n\nTransfer Credits\n\nCredit for courses taken at other colleges will be considered if the courses were completed at a regionally accredited college and the grade received was a minimum of C. Courses must have been taken prior to enrolling in any School of Professional Studies program. Course work taken ten (10) years or more prior to matriculation at this School may be transferable only if approved by the Associate Dean. Courses that are transferred carry no grade point value at New York University.\n\nFor students studying at the Schack Institute, the Tisch Center, and the Tisch Institute, a maximum of sixty-four (64) advanced standing credits (including transfer credits and AP credits) will be accepted towards the bachelor's degree.\n\nFor students studying in the Division of Applied Undergraduate Studies:\n\nAssociate's Degree: A maximum of thrity-two (32) credits (including transfer credits, AP credits, CLEP, Prior Learning Credits) will be accepted.\n\nBachelor's Degree:\n\nFor students who began their degree prior to Spring 2024, sixty-four (64) advanced standing credits will be accepted.\n\nFor students beginning their degree in Spring 2024 or later, eighty (80) advanced standing credits will be accepted.\n\nCredit for Prior Learning\n\nStudents in the Division of Applied Undergraduate Studies may earn credits for college-level learning obtained outside of the classroom. Students wishing to explore detailed policies on credit for prior learning by examination or experience, are encouraged to review the detailed Credit for Prior Learning Assessment Policy.\n\nLeave of Absence\n\nNYU expects its students to maintain continuous registration in an academic program with the exception of summer. However, it is sometimes necessary or desirable for a student to take a Leave of Absence. Such leaves may be voluntary or involuntary and will be handled in accordance with the NYU Student Leave Policy.\n\nStudents should consult with their advisor and must complete the Leave of Absence form available on Albert. Failure to do so may jeopardize your continued registration with the University.\n\nVoluntary Leave\n\nMatriculated students who wish to withdraw from school for one or two semesters, not including summer, for national service, serious medical or psychological illness, or compelling personal reasons are required to talk with their academic advisor and then submit their request for leave by logging into Albert.\n\nNote: If students are on Academic Probation when the leave is granted, they will return on Academic Probation.\n\nIf students study at another institution during a voluntary leave, normally no credits can be accepted for transfer. Only under extraordinary circumstances are students allowed to enroll for courses at another regionally accredited college or university while on leave and receive transfer credit. Such a request must be made at the time of applying for the leave, and must be approved by the Associate Dean or their representative. Up to sixteen (16) credits may be approved for transfer, subject to submission and evaluation of an official transcript.\n\nLeave for medical or psychological conditions.\n\nAn evaluation by the NYU Student Health Center may be required at no charge to the student.\n\nDuration of leave\n\nExcept where a leave is mandated by compulsory national service, leaves may be granted for a maximum of two (2) consecutive semesters (not including summer) in any undergraduate program.\n\nAbsence on leave does not extend the stipulated period of time to degree completion, unless a waiver is specifically granted by the program.\n\nThe notation \"Leave of Absence\" will be entered on the student's transcript.\n\nIf requested, students on an approved leave will need to return the NYU student identification card and will not have access to the NYU campus, the School of Professional Studies, or department facilities.\n\nInternational Students with an F-1 or J-1 Student Visa Are Additionally Subject to these Federal Government Requirements\n\nInternational students on a Personal Leave of Absence may not remain in the United States.\n\nInternational students requiring a Leave of Absence or permission to take less than a full course load for medical reasons are eligible to stay in the United States, subject to conditions set forth by the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with information provided by a physician. For questions, please consult the Office of Global Services.\n\nInvoluntary Leave\n\nThe NYU School of Professional Studies may place a student on an involuntary Leave of Absence when that student: (1) poses a direct threat to the health and safety of self or others and (2) is not able or not willing to take a voluntary Leave of Absence. With regard to involuntary leaves, SPS will follow the NYU Student Leave of Absence Policy.\n\nStudy Away Policy\n\nApplication to study at an NYU campus abroad must be made at NYU's Office of Global Programs. Students are eligible to study away once they have achieved sophomore status, are in good standing, and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Prior to applying for study away, please consult with your advisor.\n\nArrears Policy\n\nThe University reserves the right to deny registration and/or graduation and withhold all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain.\n\nDiploma Arrears Policy\n\nDiplomas of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the Bursar. Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Bursar's Office to clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University.\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\nID Cards\n\nStudents enrolled in career advancement courses, seminars, and conferences, or those with undeclared status in a certificate program are issued a Building Access Pass that provides access to classroom buildings.\n\n*Students who have declared candidacy in a certificate program are issued a photo ID which provides benefits such as access to NYU Library services, NYU Computer Store discounts, and access to the Kimmel Center for University Life. Replacement cards/policies are subject to NYU policies.\n\nArrears Policy\n\nThe University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain.\n\nGrading\n\nGrades are issued to students by the faculty of record to provide a measurement of:\n\nHow much the student has learned of the delivered body of knowledge\n\nHow effectively the student is able to use that knowledge, and\n\nOther optional standards, such as class participation and, if essential to course work, actual class attendance/lateness record (such attendance requirements are established by the faculty).\n\nAll grading criteria should be completely explained by the instructor in the course syllabus, which will either be distributed or available for download from NYU CLASSES at the beginning of the course.\n\nGrades\n\nLetter grades are issued for some continuing education courses. Students have the ability to opt out of receiving a letter grade by completing the non-evaluative (NE) form. (See link below.)\n\n*Courses completed as non-evaluative (NE) cannot be applied toward a certificate.\n\nIncomplete Grades\n\nThe grade of Incomplete is reserved for extenuating and unavoidable circumstances such as illness or other emergencies which prevent a student from finishing a course in a given term. Incompletes are given at the discretion of the instructor, in consultation with the department, when the nature of the course permits the faculty member to allow late completion.\n\nThe assigning of an Incomplete is thus subject to approval and is never automatic. Students are able to request the grade of Incomplete by contacting the program director, filling out a form and providing supporting documentation. The grade of Incomplete can only be issued to students who have completed at least 50% of the coursework. The faculty member will determine what constitutes 50% of the coursework.\n\nCoursework must be completed by the end of the following semester. A grade of Incomplete (I) that is not resolved by the end of the following semester becomes a terminal grade of “F”.\n\nThe University Registrar posts grades to student records by their student identification number within four weeks of course completion. (The student ID number begins with “N” and is printed on the student’s course schedule.) Final grades should be submitted by the faculty member for all students registered in continuing education courses within 72 hours of the last session of class.\n\nPass/Fail Option\n\nStudents have the option to take courses on a Pass/Fail basis.\n\nThe Pass/Fail form must be submitted to your academic department within the first week of the start date of your class.\n\nAll Pass/Fail decisions are irrevocable. No grade other than P or F will be recorded on the student’s transcript.\n\nStudents considering the Pass/Fail option for a degree credential at another school should first consult with that institution.\n\nPrior to selecting this option, students who are to be reimbursed by their employers should confirm that a weighted grade is not required.\n\n*Courses used to fulfill the requirements for a certificate may not be taken as Pass/Fail.\n\nGrading Scale\n\nCourse and assignment grades will be made according to the following NYU SPS guidelines.\n\n**All courses to be applied toward a certificate must be completed with a weighted letter grade (A, B, C or D). Courses that receive a failing (F) grade, a passing (P) grade, or a non-evaluative (NE) grade cannot be applied toward a certificate. Students are able to apply to request the grade of incomplete; see above.\n\nPlease note: Final grades are not mailed to students.\n\nDeclaring Certificate Candidacy\n\nTo earn a certificate, students must declare their candidacy prior to completing their course work. (Students are encouraged to declare candidacy prior to the start of the program).\n\nCertificate candidacy entitles students to important benefits: see Photo ID Card above. To apply for certificate candidacy, use the application for Certificate Candidacy Form.\n\nTime to complete a certificate varies with each program. Please check requirements with your program of study.\n\nStudents are welcome to take as many individual courses from a certificate program as they wish, but they will not receive a certificate or be eligible for the benefits detailed unless they declare candidacy and complete all requirements. Undeclared students may request a transcript showing course completion and grades, but that transcript will not indicate certificate completion.\n\nObtaining Grades\n\nGrades are posted throughout the semester as courses end. Students can access their grades online through ALBERT, NYU's web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT, you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time visit the NYU Start Page. After logging into NYU Home click on the \"Academics\" tab and then click on \"Albert Login.\" Once in ALBERT, click on \"Student Center,\" and in the drop-down menu on the left, select \"Grades.\" If you encounter a problem, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at 212-998-3333 or email askits@nyu.edu.\n\nThe Office of the University Registrar maintains individual records of students enrolled in the School's continuing education courses and is the only department authorized to record an official grade.\n\nPlease note: Final grades are not mailed to students.\n\nGrade Reviews and Changes\n\nOnce recorded, grades cannot be changed unless some omission or error occurred in the grading process.\n\nA student may petition for a grade review only after making an objective review of their performance in the course. The grade review should be initiated and completed no later than ten (10) days after the grade is issued.\n\nThe student asks the faculty for an evaluation of the grade who verifies that no calculation error has been made.\n\nIf the student is not satisfied and wishes to pursue the grade review process, the student submits a letter to the program director detailing objections to the grade along with supporting documentation.\n\nThe program director will investigate and submit a written response to the student generally within twenty (20) days of receiving the appeal with a final response. There is no further avenue of appeal. Please call Continuing Education Registration at 212-998-7200 if you need to know the contact information for your program.\n\nContinuing Education Units (CEUs)\n\nContinuing education courses do not carry credit that can be applied toward an NYU degree. If you are unsure whether or not a course carries credit, please contact the appropriate department.\n\nJust as credits have made it possible to carry degree work from one school to another, the CEU is used nationally to document the type, quality, and duration of continuing education work. A CEU is generally equal to 10 class hours (50-minute hours) in a course where grades are issued. To earn CEUs, the grade must be A, B, C, D, or Pass.\n\nThe NYU School of Professional Studies is a qualified sponsor for New Jersey Continuing Professional Education and holds a continuing education sponsor agreement with the New York State Department of Education, which authorizes the granting of continuing education credit (CEU) in the following subject areas: accounting, auditing, taxation, advisory services, and specialized knowledge and applications related to specialized industries. Courses outside of these areas will not be recognized for credit under this agreement. For the acceptability of courses offered in Finance and Accounting; Law, Taxation, and Paralegal Studies; Architecture, Engineering, and Construction; and Real Estate, call 212-998-7200.\n\nAdditions, Withdrawals and Refunds\n\nAdding/Enrolling\n\nStudents can make changes to their registration by completing the Request Form or in person at 7 East 12th Street, Room 133.\n\nDropping/Withdrawing\n\nRequests to withdraw from courses can be done by completing the Request Form or in person at 7 East 12th Street, Room 133. The request form includes the refund schedule. Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. Cancellation of payment does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce indebtedness to the University; students may be charged a penalty by the Bursar for stop payments\n\nRefund Policy\n\nRefunds are computed based on the date and time the request is received by the Office of Continuing Education Student Services. In addition, refunds for continuing education courses are based on the number of class sessions and not on the number of class sessions a student has attended.\n\nFor continuing education courses (containing the designation \"CE\")\n\nStudents are eligible for a 100% tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. The registration fee is nonrefundable.\n\nIf the class has already started, the refund schedule is as follows:\n\nFor courses with six or more sessions—75% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.\n\nFor courses with four or five sessions—60% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.\n\nFor courses with one to three sessions—no refund is given after the first scheduled session.\n\nRefunds for Online Courses\n\nRefunds for online courses are calculated differently from on-site courses.\n\nStudents are eligible for a 100% tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date.\n\nStudents are eligible for a 60% tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before having logged into the course four times or within the first week of the course.\n\nAfter the fourth log in, or the second week, students are not eligible to receive any tuition refund.\n\nCourse Cancellation\n\nNYU SPS reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel or reschedule courses up to 24 hours prior to the start date. In the event a course is cancelled, students will be notified by email.\n\nArrears Policy\n\nThe University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears with the University for as long as any arrears remain.\n\nAcademic Integrity Policy\n\nAll NYU School of Professional Studies students are expected to familiarize themselves with, and to comply with, the rules of conduct, academic regulations, and the established policies and practices of the School.\n\nAcademic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy\n\nAll students are expected to be honest and ethical in all academic work. This trust is shared among all members of the University community and is a core principle of American higher education. Any breaches of this trust will be taken seriously. A hallmark of the educated student and good scholarship is the ability to acknowledge information derived from others. Students are expected to be scrupulous in crediting those sources that have contributed to the development of their ideas.\n\nIn the process of learning, students acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This development occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected—often required—to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do, and they must give credit for ideas, suggestions, and information that come from other sources. Since the standard of good academic, creative, and scholarly work is to incorporate one's own ideas, analysis, and synthesis along with the proper recognition of the work of others, students are expected to practice the skill of attribution in their writing. Students are expected to quote accurately and identify the origin of citations from others, as well as to acknowledge when ideas are dependent upon concepts developed from other sources. This process of attribution and referencing allows each individual to demonstrate how their understanding and ideas relate to an existing body of knowledge—and add to them. It demonstrates the values of academic integrity and systematic reflection and intellectual development. To do otherwise and not reveal sources constitutes plagiarism. And plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty.\n\nPlagiarism involves borrowing or using information from other sources without proper and full credit. Students are expected to demonstrate how what they have learned incorporates an understanding of the research and expertise of scholars and other appropriate experts; thus recognizing others' published work or teachings—whether that of authors, lecturers, or one's peers—is a required practice in all academic projects. Students' own scholarly and creative work is strengthened when full and appropriate acknowledgement becomes routine.\n\nStudents must master the standard procedures for citations and using footnotes, endnotes, parenthetical references and/or bibliographies, as determined by the character of their assignments. It is an expectation that faculty members impress upon students that whenever their work is dependent upon the ideas, suggestions, phrasing, and data found in sources, a failure to acknowledge them and reference their influence—whether intentional or not—may be considered evidence of academic dishonesty and/or plagiarism. The NYU School of Professional Studies does not tolerate such behavior; and substantiated cases of plagiarism will result in serious sanctions.\n\nConsequently, it is essential for every student to develop the habits of identifying sources and to learn and use the proper forms of citation.\n\nAny of the following acts constitutes an offense of plagiarism:\n\nUsing a phrase, sentence, or passage from another person's work without quotation marks and attribution of the source.\n\nParaphrasing words or ideas from another person's work without attribution.\n\nReporting as your own research or knowledge of any data or facts gathered or reported by another person.\n\nSubmitting in your own name papers, tests, examinations, or reports completed by another person.\n\nSubmitting creative works, including images or reproduction of the creative works, of another person without proper attribution.\n\nSubmitting oral or recorded reports of another person without proper attribution.\n\nDownloading documents in whole or part from the Internet and presenting them as one's own.\n\nCiting a source that does not exist.\n\nOther offenses against academic integrity include the following:\n\nCollaborating with other students on assignments without the express permission of the instructor.\n\nGiving one's work to another student who then submits it as their own.\n\nSharing or copying answers from other students.\n\nCopying material from any digital resource/website during examinations (unless expressly authorized).\n\nUsing notes or other sources to answer exam questions without the instructor's permission.\n\nDestroying library or reference materials.\n\nSubmitting as one's own work a paper or results of research purchased or acquired from a commercial firm or another person.\n\nSubmitting original work toward requirements in more than one class without the prior permission of the instructor/s.\n\nStudents can assure the integrity of their work by:\n\nUsing quotation marks to set off words not their own.\n\nLearning to use proper forms of attribution for source materials.\n\nDoing one’s own original work in each course, without collaboration, unless otherwise instructed.\n\nCrediting use of published sources, the work of others, or material from the Web.\n\nAsking instructors if you have questions about an assignment or the use of sources.\n\nAcademic Integrity Disciplinary Procedures\n\nStudents are subject to disciplinary actions for the following offenses which include but are not limited to:\n\nCheating\n\nPlagiarism\n\nForgery or unauthorized use of documents\n\nFalse form of identification\n\nAcademic Integrity Sanctions\n\nWhen a violation of the policy is detected, the faculty member will not issue a grade on the assignment or for the course until the case has been resolved.\n\nOnce plagiarism is detected or suspected, the faculty member will immediately discuss the matter with the student. If, after this discussion the faculty member determines there is no violation, no further action is taken. If the violation is minor, a written warning is issued by the faculty member, and no further action is taken.\n\nIf it is determined there is a serious violation of policy, the faculty member informs the Program Director, and provides a written, detailed account.\n\nThe Program Director reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether or not a violation has occurred. If the Program Director concludes there has been no violation, the matter is closed. If the Program Director concludes that a violation has occurred, the Program Director, in consultation with the faculty, determines a sanction and then notifies the student.\n\nOne or more of the following sanctions can be issued:\n\nRequirement that the student redo the assignment\n\nIssue the grade of \"0\" for the assignment/student cannot redo the assignment\n\nIssue the grade of \"F\" for the assignment/student cannot redo the assignment\n\nIssue the grade of \"F\" for the course\n\nIssue the grade of \"F\" for the course; student cannot drop the course and the grade of \"F\" cannot be eliminated by retaking the course\n\nSanctions cannot be appealed.\n\nStudent Conduct Procedures\n\nStatement of Policy\n\nThe following procedures are those by which alleged violations of the NYU University Student Conduct Policy by SPS continuing education students will be reviewed and resolved.\n\nPolicy and Procedures\n\nI. APPLICABILITY OF PROCEDURES\n\nThese procedures do not apply to allegations of sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or stalking. Such allegations are administered under the University’s Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy. Allegations of conduct that could constitute a violation of both the University Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy and the University Student Conduct Policy will be administered according to the Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy.\n\nStudents with disabilities may request reasonable accommodations to facilitate their participation in the conduct process by contacting New York University’s Moses Center for Student Accessibility at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.\n\nII. FORUMS FOR RESOLUTION\n\nUpon receipt of a report of alleged misconduct, the program’s associate/divisional dean or designee will determine whether or not any violation of policy has occurred. If a violation of policy has occurred, the associate/divisional dean or designee shall review and address the behavior with the student, explain why the behavior is unacceptable, and issue a warning that if the unacceptable behavior continues, the matter will be referred to the Office of Student Affairs. In cases where the behavior is violent, threatening or in cases where the student repeats the offense, or where the misconduct might warrant suspension or dismissal, the matter will be referred immediately to the Office of Student Affairs.\n\nAll forums, as outlined below, are administered to ensure that any student accused of violating the NYU Student Conduct policy (the “respondent”) is afforded a fair and impartial process. A respondent shall not be considered responsible for any violation of policy until after the appropriate process has concluded, including any appeals as permitted by policy.\n\nA. INFORMAL RESOLUTION\n\nIn cases that are referred to the Office of Student Affairs, a conference will be arranged with the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Director of Student Affairs and/or their designees. Outcomes in this forum may include, but are not limited to, mentoring and coaching, conflict mediation, restorative justice, non-disciplinary intervention, and no contact directives.\n\nB. CONDUCT CONFERENCE\n\nThe conduct conference is a meeting between the respondent and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Director of Student Affairs or their designees. Written notice will be sent to the respondent detailing the date and location of the incident, nature of the alleged conduct, and applicable policies alleged to have been violated. The letter shall also provide the date, time and location for an individual meeting between the respondent and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Director of Student Affairs or their designees. If, despite being notified of the date, time, and location of the conduct conference, the respondent is not in attendance, the administrator/s may proceed based on the information available and sanctions may be imposed.\n\nDuring the meeting, the matter will be discussed and the student will share their perspective. The administrators may conduct such additional investigation as they deem appropriate. After the meeting, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or designee will make a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, as to whether the respondent violated the NYU Student Conduct policy. If a violation of policy has been found, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or designee shall then determine appropriate sanctions. The Associate Dean of Student Affairs or designee shall issue a written decision to the respondent generally within ten (10) days of the conduct conference. Sanctions issued after a conduct conference may include the full range of sanctions, including dismissal.\n\nIII. SANCTIONS\n\nAs outlined below, sanctions may be issued by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or designee upon the finding of a violation of the NYU Student Conduct policy. Sanctions are not intended to be solely punitive and should be issued with a thoughtfulness toward educational outcomes. Sanctions shall be crafted in consideration of:\n\nthe seriousness of the conduct,\n\nthe corrective and learning opportunities for the respondent,\n\nthe prior conduct record of the respondent (if applicable),\n\nthe safety and well-being of harmed individuals and the community,\n\nthe desirability of treating similar conduct similarly, and\n\nthe behavioral standards and values of New York University. Sanctions that may be imposed include, but are not limited to:\n\nWritten Warning: A notice to the student in writing that continuation or repetition of conduct violations shall be a cause for further disciplinary action.\n\nNo Contact Directive: A directive ordering a student to refrain from any effort to contact, communicate or interact with another individual or group. This includes, but is not limited to: in person, in writing, by phone, by email, by texts or other electronic messaging, through social media, or through a third-party acting on the student’s behalf.\n\nMandatory Health Referral: A mandated assessment with qualified health professional to evaluate a student’s well-being and promote responsible decision making.\n\nRestitution: Reimbursement for damage to or misappropriation of property. Reimbursement may take the form of appropriate service to repair or otherwise compensate for damages.\n\nUniversity Disciplinary Probation: A defined period of time during which further violation of any University policy will result in more serious disciplinary sanctions.\n\nTranscript Notation: A notation affixed to a student’s transcript indicating their involvement in a disciplinary proceeding. The notation may be permanent or for a designated time period. Transcript notation options may read as follows: (a) censured after the finding of a code of conduct violation (b) suspended after the finding of a code of conduct violation.\n\nDismissal from the University: Termination of student’s enrollment and all related privileges with permanent exclusion from future enrollment; this option can be implemented with or without a Persona Non Grata (PNG) status.\n\nWhere the conduct found to have violated the Student Conduct Policy also constitutes a “crime of violence” as defined under New York State Education Law § 6444(6) and where the sanction(s) imposed included either a suspension or dismissal, or where a respondent withdraws with such charges pending and the disciplinary process is not completed, NYU shall impose the transcript notations as described above. In such circumstances, dismissal notations are permanent and suspension notations cannot be removed until at least one year following the conclusion of the suspension.\n\nIV. APPEAL\n\nA respondent shall have the right to appeal a decision arising from a conduct conference to the Dean of the school or designee, only if the appeal falls under one of the following two categories: (1) a material procedural error; (2) previously unavailable relevant evidence that could affect the outcome. Appeals to the Dean of the school or designee must be submitted within five (5) days after the sanction has been issued by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or designee.\n\nV. RECORDS\n\nStudent conduct records are maintained in accordance with the University's Policy on Retention and Destruction of Records. Students may request to view their student conduct records by contacting the Office of the Registrar.\n\nGrievance Policy and Procedures\n\nStudents who have grievances that relate to academic or non-academic matters should follow the procedures outlined below. If a student wishes to appeal a grade, there is a specific appeals process for grades: go to Grade Reviews and Appeals above.\n\nInformal Resolution\n\nStudents wishing to grieve an alleged violation of the School's policies shall first contact the person he/she believes to be responsible for the matter being grieved (the respondent). The grievant will contact the respondent within ten (10) days of any occurrence giving rise to the grievance and will attempt to resolve the grievance informally. For example, if the complaint involves the instructor of a course, the student should contact the instructor to attempt to resolve the issue. If the complaint is not resolved at this level, the student should contact the Associate/Divisional Dean or their designee for the next level of review.\n\nFormal Complaint\n\nIf the grievance is not resolved informally within ten (10) days, a student may obtain additional review by submitting a written letter of complaint to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs.\n\nThe letter of complaint will:\n\nstate the policy that allegedly has been violated,\n\ndescribe the facts and evidence supporting the alleged violation,\n\nindicate what redress the grievant seeks, and\n\nprovide a brief history of the attempts to resolve the grievance.\n\nThe Associate Dean of Student Affairs and/or the Designee will determine whether a meeting is necessary and, if so, meet with the complainant and other persons as they deem appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the facts and attempting to resolve the complaint.\n\nAfter completing the investigation, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, or the Designee may dismiss the complaint if it has been determined that there has been no violation of the School's policies, even if the facts alleged by the grievant were true. The Associate Dean of Student Affairs, or the Designee will render a written decision generally within fifteen (15) days. There is no further avenue of appeal.\n\nRecord Keeping: The Office of Student Affairs will retain a copy of the letter of complaint, any amended complaint, and the decision rendered, for five full calendar years following the year in which the grievance was resolved.\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\nBias Response Line\n\nThe New York University Bias Response Line provides a mechanism through which members of our community can share or report experiences and concerns of bias, discrimination, or harassing behavior that may occur within our community."
