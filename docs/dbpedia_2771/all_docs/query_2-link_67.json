        "text": "Description\n\nThe process of creating textiles has long been a springboard for artistic invention. In Weaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art, two extraordinary bodies of work separated by at least 500 years are brought together to explore the striking connections between artists of the ancient Andes and those of the 20th century.\n\nFeaturing more than 50 works, including major loans and new acquisitions, this cross-historical exhibition offers new insights into the emergence of abstract imagery. Each of the four modern artists featured developed innovative approaches to an ancient medium through deep study of Andean techniques. Shown together, these ancient and modern weavings reposition the place of textiles in global art history.\n\nThe exhibition displays textiles by four distinguished modern practitioners—Anni Albers, Sheila Hicks, Lenore Tawney, and Olga de Amaral—alongside pieces by Andean artists from the first millennium BCE to the 16th century.\n\nDetails\n\nOn display from March 5–June 16, 2024\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum Of Art –Gallery 913 [website link]\n\n1000 Fifth Avenue\n\nat 82nd Street\n\nNew York, NY, 10028\n\n[map link]\n\nPublication\n\nThis exhibition is accompanied by an issue of The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin: Weaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art: The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, v.81, no. 2 (Fall, 2023).\n\nCuration Credits"
