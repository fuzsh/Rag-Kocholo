        "text": "Turning her gaze to Fifth Avenue, Stettheimer treats the spectacles of high society and consumerism with affectionate humor. A newly wedded couple emerges from a church, ready to begin a life of excess and acquisition. Floating above them are the names of New York’s most exclusive shops and food establishments; \"Tiffany’s\" is spelled out in jeweled letters, and \"Altman’s\" is shaped from fine home furnishings. At right, Stettheimer and her sisters exit a limousine near Augustus Saint-Gaudens’s gilded Sherman Monument. Like the other three paintings in the series (see MMA 53.24.1, 53.24.2, and 53.24.3), a gilded frame of the artist’s design surrounds the canvas."
