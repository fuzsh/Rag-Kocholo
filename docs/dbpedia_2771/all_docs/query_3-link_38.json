        "text": "IN THIS SECTION\n\nActivity Requiring a Special Event Permit\n\nRequired Processing Time\n\nActivity Requiring a Special Event Permit\n\nNot all events in the Seattle of Seattle require a Special Event Permit. Many events in City parks may only require a Seattle Parks and Recreation parks use permit. Small events on sidewalks, residential streets, or other public places may only require a Seattle Department of Transportation street use permit. Some event activity may not require a permit at all.\n\nHowever, many events require coordinated City services and/or have a substantial impact on a park, public or private place. Such events, called Special Events require considerable advance planning by more than one City department, sometimes in conjunction with other governmental agencies, in order to adequately protect public safety and property and to reduce adverse impacts on the public place and upon neighbors and other users of our public places. These events are subject to the City's Special Events Ordinance 124860 (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.52).\n\nBelow are some general guidelines on when a Special Event Permit is required, arranged by event location.
