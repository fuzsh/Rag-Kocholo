        "text": "Disclosure: This site may receive compensation from some link clicks and purchases.\n\n500 what who?! 547 miles? I have more miles on a pair of slippers that I just got a month ago. This incredible time capsule 1979 Chrysler New Yorker 5th Avenue has just 547 miles on it, you read that right. Did I read that right? The seller has it listed here on Hemmings in Wellsville, Ohio and they’re asking what seems like a reasonable $11,500 for this car. Thanks to markhagans for this tip!\n\nI think that this era of Newport and New Yorker is by far the most unusual and interesting. Are they the best? No, I think that’s almost a universal answer, but they are really unique and even when they were sold for the three years that Chrysler made the tenth-generation cars, I barely saw any on the streets. This is an amazing car but I’m assuming that there will be little things to fix and many of the rubber and tune-up parts will need to be changed due to age rather than wear. A light two-tone beige was the only color offered on the Fifth Avenue version in 1979.\n\nI cringe thinking of a 547-mile car being parked on dirt, or mud, or grass, or whatever combination this one is parked on, even for a minute. If this car is as nice in person as it appears to be in the photos and it truly has 547 miles on it, it belongs in a museum. Or in my garage, yeah, I like that idea much better. Chrysler made them for 1979, 1980, and 1981 as R-body four-door sedans. They weren’t available in a two-door or convertible or station wagon or anything other than a four-door sedan. Although, a two-door… hmm… (scratching gray whiskers)\n\nThe photos are all over the board with a few of them being verticals! AHHH!! (running, screaming into the darkness) There are basically no photos of the dash other than a couple of cropped, small detail photos, or the trunk or the underside or many other parts of this beauty, but maybe the seller would send photos to any serious parties. The beautiful leather seats look literally like new and I’m just assuming that everything works, at least the power equipment. This car was owned by one family and it’s incredibly sad that they never got a chance to enjoy it over the last 42 years. If you look at the photos, you’ll see some big gaps in things, I’m not sure if that’s from temperature change over the decades or just late-1970s Detroit build quality – or both?\n\nThe engine is Chrysler’s 360 cubic-inch V8 which came in three flavors with two-barrel or four-barrel and horsepower ratings from 150 to 170 or 195-hp. According to the VIN, this is the base engine, the 150-horsepower two-barrel 360. The seller says that it runs and drives and the family is losing their indoor storage which is why it’s for sale. How fantastic would it be to have basically a brand new 42-year-old New Yorker? Any thoughts on this one?"
