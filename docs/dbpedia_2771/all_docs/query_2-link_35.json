Built by the prolific developer Anthony Campagna, 834 [Fifth Avenue] has a high preponderance of duplexes, with no more than three units to a floor, and was known for many years for housing senior members of the Rockefeller family. A little-known fact is that it was planned as a smaller mid-block building, but after the steelwork was already in place, the developer unexpectedly was able to purchase the grand mansion on the corner. That elegant, almost-new residence was summarily taken down and 834 Fifth Avenue was extended 25 feet to the corner of East 64th Street.
