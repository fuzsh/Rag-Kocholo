        "text": "(a) Locating size standards and North American Industry Classification System codes.\n\n(1) SBA establishes small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis. Small business size standards and corresponding North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are provided at 13 CFR 121.201. They are also available at https://www.sba.gov/​document/​support--table-size-standards .\n\n(2) NAICS codes are updated by the Office of Management and Budget through its Economic Classification Policy Committee every five years. New NAICS codes are not available for use in Federal contracting until SBA publishes corresponding size standards. NAICS codes are available from the U.S. Census Bureau at https://www.census.gov/naics/.\n\n(3) SBA determines the size status of a concern, including its affiliates, as of the date the concern represents that it is small to the contracting officer as part of its initial offer, which includes price.\n\n(4) When an agency uses a solicitation for a multiple-award contract that does not require offers for the contract to include price, SBA determines size as of the date of initial offer for the multiple-award contract, whether or not the offer includes price or the price is evaluated. (See 13 CFR 121.404(a)(1)(iv)).\n\n(b) Determining the appropriate NAICS codes for the solicitation.\n\n(1) Unless required to do otherwise by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, contracting officers shall assign one NAICS code and corresponding size standard to all solicitations, contracts, and task and delivery orders. The contracting officer shall determine the appropriate NAICS code by classifying the product or service being acquired in the one industry that best describes the principal purpose of the supply or service being acquired. Primary consideration is given to the industry descriptions in the U.S. NAICS Manual, the product or service descriptions in the solicitation, the relative value and importance of the components of the requirement making up the end item being procured, and the function of the goods or services being purchased. A procurement is usually classified according to the component that accounts for the greatest percentage of contract value.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) For solicitations issued on or before October 1, 2025, that will result in multiple-award contracts, the contracting officer shall assign a NAICS code in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n(ii) For solicitations issued after October 1, 2025, that will result in multiple-award contracts, the contracting officer shall–\n\n(A) Assign a single NAICS code (and corresponding size standard) that best describes the principal purpose of both the acquisition and each subsequent order; or\n\n(B) Divide the acquisition into distinct portions or categories (e.g., line item numbers, Special Item Numbers, sectors, functional areas, or equivalent) and assign each portion or category a single NAICS code and size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the supplies or services to be acquired under that distinct portion or category.\n\n(3)\n\n(i) When placing orders under multiple-award contracts with a single NAICS code, the contracting officer shall assign the order the same NAICS code and corresponding size standard designated in the contract.\n\n(ii) When placing orders under multiple-award contracts with more than one NAICS code, the contracting officer shall assign the order the NAICS code and corresponding size standard designated in the contract for the distinct portion or category against which the order is placed. If an order covers multiple portions or categories, select the NAICS code and corresponding size standard designated in the contract for the distinct portion or category that best represents the principal purpose of the order.\n\n(4) The contracting officer's designation is final unless appealed in accordance with the procedures in 19.103.\n\n(c) Application of small business size standards to solicitations.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall apply the size standard in effect on the date the solicitation is issued.\n\n(2) The contracting officer may amend the solicitation and use the new size standard if SBA amends the size standard and it becomes effective before the due date for receipt of initial offers.\n\n(a) It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. The Small Business Administration (SBA) counsels and assists small business concerns and assists contracting personnel to ensure that a fair proportion of contracts for supplies and services is placed with small business.\n\n(b) Heads of contracting activities are responsible for effectively implementing the small business programs within their activities, including achieving program goals. They are to ensure that contracting and technical personnel maintain knowledge of small business program requirements and take all reasonable action to increase participation in their activities’ contracting processes by these businesses.\n\n(c) The Small Business Act requires each agency with contracting authority to establish an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (see section 15(k) of the Small Business Act). For the Department of Defense, in accordance with section 904 of Public Law 109-163 ( 10 U.S.C. 144 note), the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization has been redesignated as the Office of Small Business Programs. Management of the office is the responsibility of an officer or employee of the agency who, in carrying out the purposes of the Act—\n\n(1) Is known as the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, or for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs;\n\n(2)Is appointed by the agency head;\n\n(3) Is responsible to and reports directly to the agency head or the deputy to the agency head (except that for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs reports to the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee);\n\n(4)Is responsible for the agency carrying out the functions and duties in sections 8, 15, 31, 36, and 44 of the Small Business Act;\n\n(5) Works with the SBA procurement center representative (PCR) (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) to identify proposed solicitations that involve bundling and work with the agency acquisition officials and SBA to revise the acquisition strategies for such proposed solicitations to increase the probability of participation by small businesses;\n\n(6)Assists small business concerns in obtaining payments under their contracts, late payment interest penalties, or information on contractual payment provisions;\n\n(7) Has supervisory authority over agency personnel to the extent that their functions and duties relate to sections 8, 15, 31, 36, and 44 of the Small Business Act;\n\n(8)Assigns a small business technical advisor to each contracting activity within the agency to which the SBA has assigned a representative (see 19.402)—\n\n(i)Who is a full-time employee of the contracting activity, well qualified, technically trained, and familiar with the supplies or services contracted for by the activity; and\n\n(ii)Whose principal duty is to assist the SBA's assigned representative in performing functions and duties relating to sections 8, 15, 31, 36, and 44 of the Small Business Act;\n\n(9) Cooperates and consults on a regular basis with the SBA in carrying out the agency's functions and duties in sections 8, 15, 31, 36, and 44 of the Small Business Act;\n\n(10) Makes recommendations in accordance with agency procedures as to whether a particular acquisition should be awarded under subpart 19.5 as a small business set-aside, under subpart 19.8 as a section 8(a) award, under subpart 19.13 as a HUBZone set-aside, under subpart 19.14 as a set-aside service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns eligible under the SDVOSB Program, or under subpart 19.15 as a set-aside for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concerns or women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program;\n\n(11) Conducts annual reviews to assess the—\n\n(i) Extent to which small businesses are receiving a fair share of Federal procurements, including contract opportunities under the programs administered under the Small Business Act;\n\n(ii) Adequacy of consolidated or bundled contract documentation and justifications; and\n\n(iii) Actions taken to mitigate the effects of necessary and justified consolidation or bundling on small businesses.\n\n(12) Provides a copy of the assessment made under paragraph (c)(11) of this section to the Agency Head and SBA Administrator;\n\n(13)Provides to the chief acquisition officer and senior procurement executive advice and comments on acquisition strategies, market research, and justifications related to consolidation of contract requirements;\n\n(14) When notified by a small business concern prior to the award of a contract that the small business concern believes that a solicitation, request for proposal, or request for quotation unduly restricts the ability of the small business concern to compete for the award–\n\n(i) Submits the notification by the small business concern to the contracting officer and, if necessary, recommends ways in which the solicitation, request for proposal, or request for quotation may be altered to increase the opportunity for competition; and\n\n(ii) Informs the advocate for competition of such agency (as established under 41 U.S.C 1705 or 10 U.S.C. 3249) of such notification;\n\n(15) Ensures agency purchases using the Governmentwide purchase card that are greater than the micro-purchase threshold and less than the simplified acquisition threshold were made in compliance with the Small Business Act and were properly recorded in accordance with subpart 4.6 in the Federal Procurement Data System;\n\n(16) Assists small business contractors and subcontractors in finding resources for education and training on compliance with contracting regulations;\n\n(17) Reviews all subcontracting plans required by 19.702(a) to ensure the plan provides maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns to participate in the performance of the contract; and\n\n(18) Performs other duties listed at 15 U.S.C. 644(k).\n\n(d) Small business specialists shall be appointed and act in accordance with agency regulations.\n\n(1) The contracting activity shall coordinate with the small business specialist as early in the acquisition planning process as practicable, but no later than 30 days before the issuance of a solicitation, or prior to placing an order without a solicitation when the acquisition meets the dollar thresholds set forth at 7.107-4(a)(1). See also 7.104(d).\n\n(2) The small business specialist shall notify the agency's Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, and for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs, when the criteria relating to substantial bundling at 7.107-4(a)(1) are met.\n\n(3) The small business specialist shall coordinate with the contracting activity and the SBA PCR on all determinations and findings required by 7.107 for consolidation or bundling of contract requirements.\n\n(a)\n\n(1) The SBA regulations on small business size and size protests are found at 13 CFR part 121 .\n\n(2) An offeror, the contracting officer, SBA, or another interested party may protest the small business representation of an offeror in a specific offer for a contract. However, for competitive 8(a) contracts, the filing of a protest is limited to an offeror, the contracting officer, or the SBA.\n\n(b) Any time after offers are received by the contracting officer, or in the case of bids, opened, the contracting officer may question the small business representation of any offeror in a specific offer by filing a contracting officer's protest (see paragraph (c) of this section).\n\n(c)\n\n(1) Any contracting officer who receives a protest, whether timely or not, or who, as the contracting officer, wishes to protest the small business representation of an offeror, or rerepresentation of a contractor, shall promptly forward the protest to the SBA Government Contracting Area Director at the Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located.\n\n(2) The protest, or confirmation if the protest was initiated orally, shall be in writing and shall contain the basis for the protest with specific, detailed evidence to support the allegation that the offeror is not small. The SBA will dismiss any protest that does not contain specific grounds for the protest.\n\n(3) The protest shall include a referral letter written by the contracting officer with information pertaining to the solicitation. The referral letter must include the following information to allow SBA to determine timeliness and standing:\n\n(i) The protest and any accompanying materials.\n\n(ii) A copy of the size self-certification.\n\n(iii) Identification of the applicable size standard.\n\n(iv) A copy or an electronic link to the solicitation and any amendments.\n\n(v) The name, address, telephone number, email address, and fax number of the contracting officer.\n\n(vi) Identification of the bid opening date or the date of notification provided to unsuccessful offerors.\n\n(vii) The date the contracting officer received the protest.\n\n(viii) A complete address and point of contact for the protested concern.\n\n(d) In order to affect a specific solicitation, a protest must be timely. SBA’s regulations on timeliness are contained in 13 CFR121.1004. SBA’s regulations on timeliness related to protests of disadvantaged status are contained in 13 CFR124, Subpart B.\n\n(1) To be timely, a protest by any concern or other interested party must be received by the contracting officer (see paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section) by the close of business of the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions) or receipt of the special notification from the contracting officer that identifies the apparently successful offeror (in negotiated acquisitions) (see 15.503(a)(2)).\n\n(i) A protest may be made orally if it is confirmed in writing and received by the contracting officer within the 5-day period or by letter postmarked no later than 1 business day after the oral protest.\n\n(ii) A protest may be made in writing if it is delivered to the contracting officer by hand, mail, facsimile, e-mail, express or overnight delivery service.\n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a protest filed by the contracting officer or SBA is always considered timely whether filed before or after award.\n\n(3) A protest under a Multiple Award Schedule will be timely if received by SBA at any time prior to the expiration of the contract period, including renewals.\n\n(4) A protest filed before bid opening, or notification to offerors of the selection of the apparent successful offeror, will be dismissed as premature by SBA.\n\n(e) Upon receipt of a protest from or forwarded by the Contracting Office, the SBA will-\n\n(1) Notify the contracting officer and the protester of the date it was received, and that the size of the concern being challenged is under consideration by the SBA; and\n\n(2) Furnish to the concern whose representation is being protested a copy of the protest and a blank SBA Form355, Application for Small Business Determination, by certified mail, return receipt requested.\n\n(f)\n\n(1) Within 15 business days after receipt of a protest or request for a formal size determination or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer the SBA Area Office will determine the size status of the challenged concern. The SBA Area Office will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the challenged concern of its decision by a verifiable means, which may include facsimile, electronic mail, or overnight delivery service.\n\n(2) Award may be made to a protested concern after the SBA Area Office has determined that either the protested concern is an eligible small business or has dismissed all protests against it.\n\n(3) If SBA’s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) subsequently overturns the Area Office's determination of eligibility or dismissal, and contract award has not been made, the contracting officer may apply the OHA decision to the procurement in question.\n\n(g)\n\n(1) After receiving a protest involving an offeror being considered for award, the contracting officer shall not award the contract until the SBA has made a size determination or 15 business days have expired since SBA’s receipt of a protest, whichever occurs first; however, award shall not be withheld when the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest.\n\n(2) If SBA has not made a determination within 15 business days, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may award the contract after determining in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.\n\n(3) SBA may, at its sole discretion, reopen a formal size determination to correct an error or mistake, if it is within the appeal period and no appeal has been filed with OHA or, a final decision has not been rendered by the SBA Area Office or OHA.\n\n(4) If a protest is received that challenges the small business status of an offeror not being considered for award, the contracting officer is not required to suspend contract action. The contracting officer shall forward the protest to the SBA (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) with a notation that the concern is not being considered for award, and shall notify the protester of this action.\n\n(h) An appeal from an SBA size determination may be filed by any concern or other interested party whose protest of the small business representation of another concern has been denied by an SBA Government Contracting Area Director, any concern or other interested party that has been adversely affected by an SBA Government Contracting Area Director’s decision, or the SBA Associate Administrator for the SBA program involved. The appeal must be filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Small Business Administration, Suite 5900, 409 3 rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416, within the time limits and in strict accordance with the procedures contained in Subpart C of 13 CFR 134. It is within the discretion of the SBA Judge whether to accept an appeal from a size determination. If a post-award appeal is submitted to OHA within the time limits specified in Subpart C of 13 CFR 134, the contracting officer shall consider suspending contract performance until an SBA Judge decides the appeal. SBA will inform the contracting officer of its ruling on the appeal. SBA’s decision, if received before award, will apply to the pending acquisition. If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (g)(1) or (2) of this section, the contract has been awarded, the SBA rulings is received after award, and OHA finds the protested concern to be ineligible for award, the contracting officer shall terminate the contract unless termination is not in the best interests of the Government, in keeping with the circumstances described in the written determination. However, the contracting officer shall not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders.\n\n(i) SBA will dismiss untimely protests. A protest that is not timely, even though received before award, shall be forwarded to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section), with a notation on it that the protest is not timely. A protest received by a contracting officer after award of a contract shall be forwarded to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office with a notation that award has been made.\n\n(j) When a concern is found to be other than small under a protest concerning a size status rerepresentation made in accordance with the clause at 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, a contracting officer may permit contract performance to continue, issue orders, or exercise option(s), because the contract remains a valid contract.\n\n(a) Definition. As used in this section-\n\nInterested party has the meaning given in 13 CFR 126.103.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) For sole-source procurements, SBA or the contracting officer may protest the prospective contractor's certified HUBZone status; for all other procurements, SBA, the contracting officer, or any other interested party may protest the apparent successful offeror's certified HUBZone status (see 13 CFR 126.800).\n\n(2) The Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program will determine whether the concern has certified HUBZone status. If SBA upholds the protest, SBA will remove the concern's HUBZone status in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS). SBA's protest regulations are found in subpart H “Protests” at 13 CFR 126.800 through 126.805.\n\n(c) Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of 19.302. An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests. Protests relating to small business size status for the acquisition and the HUBZone eligibility requirements will be processed concurrently by SBA.\n\n(d)\n\n(1) All protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest ( i.e., why the protested concern did not meet the eligibility requirements at 13 CFR 126.200 at the time of the concern's application to SBA for certification as a HUBZone small business concern or at the time SBA certified or last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern). Assertions that a protested concern is not a HUBZone small business concern, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by SBA (see 13 CFR 126.801(b)).\n\n(2) Protests filed against a HUBZone joint venture must state one or, if applicable, both of the following:\n\n(i) Why the HUBZone small business party to the joint venture did not meet the eligibility requirements at 13 CFR 126.200 at the time of its application to SBA for certification or at the time SBA certified or last recertified the concern as a HUBZone small business concern.\n\n(ii) Why the joint venture did not meet the requirements at 13 CFR 126.616 at the time of submission of its offer for a HUBZone contract.\n\n(e) Submission of a protest.\n\n(1) An interested party shall submit its written protest to the contracting officer-\n\n(i) For sealed bids-\n\n(A) By the close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening; or\n\n(B) By the close of business on the fifth business day from the date of identification of the apparent successful offeror, if the price evaluation preference was not applied at the time of bid opening; or\n\n(ii) For negotiated acquisitions, by the close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparently successful offeror.\n\n(2) Any protest received after the designated time limits is untimely, unless it is from the contracting officer or SBA.\n\n(3) SBA will consider protests for HUBZone set-aside or sole-source service contracts or orders, if a HUBZone prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in 13 CFR 125.1, or if such subcontractor performs the primary and vital requirements of the contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at 19.302, and 13 CFR 121.103(h)(2), which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the “ostensible subcontractor rule”).\n\n(f) The contracting officer shall forward all protests with a referral letter to the Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program, by email to hzprotests@sba.gov. The referral letter shall include the following—\n\n(1) The solicitation number;\n\n(2) The contracting officer's name and contact information;\n\n(3) The type of HUBZone contract ( i.e., sole-source, set-aside, full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference, or reserve for HUBZone small business concerns under a multiple-award contract);\n\n(4) For a procurement conducted using full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference, whether the protester's opportunity for award was affected by the preference;\n\n(5) For a HUBZone set-aside, whether the protester submitted an offer;\n\n(6) Whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror;\n\n(7) Whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures;\n\n(8) The bid opening date, if applicable;\n\n(9) The date the protester was notified of the apparent successful offeror;\n\n(10) The date the contracting officer received the protest;\n\n(11) The date the protested concern submitted its initial offer or quote to the contracting officer; and\n\n(12) Whether a contract has been awarded, and if so, the date of award and contract number.\n\n(g) SBA will notify the protester and the contracting officer of the date SBA received the protest.\n\n(h) Before SBA decision.\n\n(1) After receiving a protest involving the apparent successful offeror’s status as a HUBZone small business concern, the contracting officer shall either-\n\n(i) Withhold award of the contract until SBA determines the status of the protested concern; or\n\n(ii) Award the contract if—\n\n(A) SBA does not issue its decision within 15 business days after receipt of the protest; and\n\n(B) The contracting officer determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting for SBA's determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.\n\n(2) SBA will determine the merits of the status protest within 15 business days after receipt of a protest, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer.\n\n(i) After SBA decision. The SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of the SBA determination. The determination is effective immediately and is final unless overturned on appeal by SBA’s Associate Administrator, Office of Government Contracting and Business Development (AA/GC&BD).\n\n(1) If the contracting officer has withheld contract award and SBA has determined that the protested concern is an eligible HUBZone or dismissed all protests against the protested concern, the contracting officer may award the contract to the protested concern. If the AA/GC&BD subsequently overturns the initial determination or dismissal, the contracting officer may apply the AA/GC&BD decision to the procurement in question.\n\n(2) If the contracting officer has withheld award and the HUBZone Program Director has determined that the protested concern is ineligible, and a timely AA/GC&BD appeal has not been filed, then the contracting officer shall not award the contract to the protested concern.\n\n(3) If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, awarded the contract, and the Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program's ruling sustaining the protest is received after award—\n\n(i) The contracting officer shall either—\n\n(A) Terminate the contract; or\n\n(B)\n\n(1) Make a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government; and\n\n(2) Not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders under the contract.\n\n(ii) SBA will remove the concern's designation as a certified HUBZone small business concern in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS). The concern is not permitted to submit an offer as a HUBZone small business concern until SBA issues a decision that the ineligibility is resolved; and\n\n(iii) After SBA updates the concern's designation as a HUBZone small business in DSBS, the contracting officer shall update the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) to reflect the final decision of the HUBZone Program Director if no appeal is filed.\n\n(4) If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, awarded the contract, SBA has sustained the protest and determined that the concern is not a HUBZone small business, and a timely AA/GC&BD appeal has been filed, then the contracting officer shall consider whether performance can be suspended until an AA/GC&BD decision is rendered.\n\n(5) If the AA/GC&BD affirms the decision of the HUBZone Program Director, finding the protested concern is ineligible, and contract award has occurred—\n\n(i) The contracting officer shall either—\n\n(A) Terminate the contract; or\n\n(B)\n\n(1) Make a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government; and\n\n(2) Not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders under the contract;\n\n(ii) SBA will remove the concern's designation as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS. The concern is not permitted to submit an offer as a HUBZone small business concern until SBA issues a decision that the ineligibility is resolved or the AA/GC&BD finds the concern is eligible on appeal; and\n\n(iii) After SBA updates the concern's designation as a HUBZone small business in DSBS, the contracting officer shall update FPDS to reflect the AA/GC&BD decision.\n\n(6) A concern found to be ineligible during a HUBZone status protest is precluded from applying for HUBZone certification for 90 calendar days from the date of the SBA final decision.\n\n(j) Appeals of HUBZone status determinations. The protested HUBZone small business concern, the protester, or the contracting officer may file appeals of protest determinations with SBA’s AA/GC&BD. The AA/GC&BD must receive the appeal no later than 5 business days after the date of receipt of the protest determination. SBA will dismiss any untimely appeal.\n\n(k) The appeal must be in writing. The appeal must identify the protest determination being appealed and must set forth a full and specific statement as to why the decision is erroneous or what significant fact the HUBZone Program Director failed to consider.\n\n(l)\n\n(1) The party appealing the decision must provide notice of the appeal to-\n\n(i) The contracting officer; and\n\n(ii) The protested HUBZone small business concern or the original protester, as appropriate.\n\n(2) SBA will not consider additional information or changed circumstances that were not disclosed at the time of the HUBZone Program Director's determination or that are based on disagreement with the findings and conclusions contained in the determination.\n\n(m) The AA/GC&BD will make its decision within 5 business days of the receipt of the appeal, if practicable, and will base its decision only on the information and documentation in the protest record as supplemented by the appeal. SBA will provide a copy of the decision to the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested HUBZone small business concern. The SBA decision, if received before award, will apply to the pending acquisition. The AA/GC&BD's decision is the final decision.\n\n(a) Definition.\n\nInterested party, as used in this section, has the meaning given in 13 CFR 134.1002(b).\n\n(b)\n\n(1) General. For sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), or SBA may protest the apparently successful offeror’s service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) status. For all other acquisitions, any interested party may protest the apparently successful offeror’s service-disabled veteran-owned small business status.\n\n(2) SBA’s protest regulations are found in 13 CFR 128.500 and 13 CFR part 134.\n\n(c) Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of 19.302. An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and service-disabled veteran-owned small business status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests.\n\n(d) All protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest.\n\n(1) OHA will consider protests challenging the SDVOSB status or the ownership and control of a concern if—\n\n(i) For status protests, the protester presents evidence supporting the contention that the owner(s) cannot provide documentation from the VA to show that they meet the definition of “service-disabled veteran” or “service-disabled veteran with a permanent and severe disability” as set forth in 13 CFR 128.102; or\n\n(ii) For ownership and control protests, the protester presents evidence that the concern is not 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans. In the case of a veteran with a permanent and severe disability, the protester presents evidence that the concern is not controlled by the veteran, spouse, or permanent caregiver of such veteran; or\n\n(iii) For set-aside or sole-source service contract or order ostensible subcontractor protests, the protester presents credible evidence of the alleged undue reliance on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in 13 CFR 125.1, or credible evidence that the small non-similarly situated entity is performing the primary and vital requirements of the contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at 19.302, and 13 CFR 121.103(h)(2), which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the “ostensible subcontractor rule”); or\n\n(iv) For joint venture protests, the protester presents evidence that the managing SDVOSB joint venture partner does not meet the requirements at 13 CFR 128.402.\n\n(2) Assertions that a protested concern is not a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by OHA (see 13 CFR 134.1005).\n\n(e) Protest by an interested party.\n\n(1) An interested party (except contracting officers should see paragraph (f)(1) of this section) shall submit its protest to the contracting officer—\n\n(i) To be received by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions);\n\n(ii) To be received by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparently successful offeror (for negotiated acquisitions);\n\n(iii) To be received by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee for an order that is set aside for SDVOSBs under a multiple-award contract that was not totally or partially set aside or reserved for SDVOSB concerns. This paragraph (e)(1)(iii) does not apply to an order issued under a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract; or\n\n(iv) To be received by the close of the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee for a blanket purchase agreement that is set aside for SDVOSBs under a multiple-award contract that was not totally or partially set aside or reserved for SDVOSB concerns. This paragraph (e)(1)(iv) does not apply to a blanket purchase agreement issued under a FSS contract.\n\n(2) Any protest received after the designated time limits is untimely, except—\n\n(i) The VA or SBA may file an SDVOSB status protest at any time; and\n\n(ii) The contracting officer, SBA, or VA may file an SDVOSB status protest at any time after the apparent awardee has been identified or after bid opening, whichever applies.\n\n(f) Forwarding protests to SBA.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall forward all protests to the U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 409 Third Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416, or by email at OHAfilings@sba.gov, marked “Attn: SDVOSB Status Protest”.\n\n(2) The protest shall include a referral letter written by the contracting officer with information pertaining to the solicitation.

OHA will notify the protester, the protested concern, SBA’s Director of Government Contracting (D/GC), SBA Counsel, and the contracting officer of the date OHA received the protest.\n\n(h) Before OHA decision.\n\n(1) After receiving a protest involving the apparent successful offeror's status as an SDVOSB concern, the contracting officer shall either-\n\n(i) Withhold award of the contract until OHA determines the status of the protested concern; or\n\n(ii) Award the contract after receipt of the protest but before OHA issues its decision if the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest. The contracting officer shall notify OHA and SBA D/GC in writing of the determination and a copy shall be included in the contract file.\n\n(2) OHA will determine the merits of the status protest.\n\n(3) OHA does not have a standard timeline for issuing decisions.\n\n(i) After OHA decision. OHA will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of its decision. The decision is effective immediately and is final.\n\n(1) If the contracting officer has withheld contract award and OHA has determined that the protested concern is an eligible SDVOSB or dismissed all protests against the protested concern, then the contracting officer may award the contract to the protested concern.\n\n(2) If the contracting officer has withheld contract award, and OHA has sustained the protest and determined that the concern is not an SDVOSB, then the contracting officer shall not award the contract to the protested concern.\n\n(3) If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, the contract has been awarded, and the OHA decision to sustain the protest is received after award-\n\n(i) The contracting officer shall terminate the contract, unless the contracting officer has made a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government. However, the contracting officer shall not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders;\n\n(ii) The contracting officer shall update FPDS to reflect the final OHA decision; and\n\n(iii) The concern must remove its designation in the System for Award Management (SAM) as an SDVOSB concern within 2 days of the OHA decision. SBA will update the concern’s SDVOSB status in SAM if the concern fails to do so. The concern shall not submit an offer as a SDVOSB concern or an SDVOSB concern eligible under the SDVOSB Program, until the concern is designated as an SDVOSB by SBA in the SBA Veteran Small Business Certification Program database at https://veterans.certify.sba.gov.\n\n(4) A concern found to be ineligible may not submit future offers as an SDVOSB concern until the concern is designated as an SDVOSB by SBA in the SBA Veteran Small Business Certification Program database at https://veterans.certify.sba.gov.\n\n(a) Definition. Interested party, as used in this section, has the meaning given in 13 CFR 127.102.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) For sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer or SBA may protest the offeror’s status as an economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concern or as a WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program. For all other acquisitions, an interested party (see 13 CFR 127.102) may protest the apparent successful offeror’s EDWOSB or WOSB status.\n\n(2) SBA’s protest regulations are found in subpart F \"Protests\" at 13 CFR 127.600 through 127.605.\n\n(c) Protests relating to small business size status are subject to the procedures of 19.302. An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and WOSB or EDWOSB status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests.\n\n(d) All protests shall be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest.\n\n(1) SBA will consider protests challenging the status of a concern if-\n\n(i) The protest presents evidence that the concern is not at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are United States citizens;\n\n(ii) The protest presents evidence that the concern is not at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more economically disadvantaged women who are United States citizens, when it is in connection with an EDWOSB contract; or\n\n(iii) For WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source service contracts or orders, the protest presents evidence that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small entity subcontractor that is not a similarly-situated entity as defined in 13 CFR 125.1, or a protest alleging that such subcontractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of a set-aside or sole-source WOSB or EDWOSB contract. For allegations that the prime contractor is unduly reliant on an other-than-small subcontractor, see size protests at 19.302, and 13 CFR 121.103(h)(2), which treats the pair as joint venturers for size determination purposes (the “ostensible subcontractor rule”).\n\n(2) Assertions that a protested concern is not an EDWOSB or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, will not be considered by SBA (see 13 CFR 127.603(a)).\n\n(e) Protest by an interested party.\n\n(1) An offeror shall submit its protest to the contracting officer-\n\n(i) To be received by the close of business by the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions); or\n\n(ii) To be received by the close of business by the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror (in negotiated acquisitions).\n\n(2) Any protest received after the designated time limit is untimely, unless it is from the contracting officer or SBA.\n\n(f)\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall forward all protests to SBA.

This determination shall be provided to the SBA Director for Government Contracting and a copy shall be included in the contract file.\n\n(i) After SBA decision. SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of its determination. The determination is effective immediately and is final unless overturned on appeal by OHA pursuant to 13 CFR part 134.\n\n(1) If the contracting officer has withheld contract award and SBA has denied or dismissed the protest, the contracting officer may award the contract to the protested concern. If OHA subsequently overturns the SBA Director for Government Contracting’s determination or dismissal, the contracting officer may apply the OHA decision to the procurement in question.\n\n(2) If the contracting officer has withheld contract award, SBA has sustained the protest and determined that the concern is not eligible under the WOSB Program, and no OHA appeal has been filed, then the contracting officer shall not award the contract to the protested concern.\n\n(3) If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (h)(1)(ii) or (h)(3) of this section, awarded the contract, and SBA’s ruling is received after award, and no OHA appeal has been filed, then-\n\n(i) The contracting officer shall terminate the contract, unless the contracting officer has made a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government.

The appeal must identify the protest determination being appealed and must set forth a full and specific statement as to why the EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB program protest determination is alleged to be based on a clear error of fact or law, together with an argument supporting such allegation.\n\n(l) The party appealing the decision must provide notice of the appeal to-\n\n(1) The contracting officer;\n\n(2) Director, Office of Government Contracting, U.S. Small Business Administration, by email at wosbprotest@sba.gov ;\n\n(3) The protested EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB program, or the original protester, as appropriate; and\n\n(4) SBA’s Office of General Counsel, Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416, or e-mail at OPLService@sba.gov.\n\n(m) OHA will make its decision within 15 business days of the receipt of the appeal, if practicable. SBA will provide a copy of the decision to the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested EDWOSB concern or WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB program. The OHA decision is the final agency decision and is binding on the parties.\n\n(a) Applicability.\n\n(1)This section applies to small business set-asides above the simplified acquisition threshold and orders issued directly to a small business in accordance with 19.504(c)(1)(ii) above the simplified acquisition threshold.\n\n(2)This section applies, regardless of dollar value, to the following awards under subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15:\n\n(i)Contracts that are set aside.\n\n(ii)Contracts that are awarded on a sole-source basis.\n\n(iii)Orders that are set-aside as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).\n\n(iv)Orders that are issued directly in accordance with 19.504(c)(1)(ii).\n\n(v)Contracts that use the HUBZone price evaluation preference to award to a HUBZone small business concern unless the concern waived the evaluation preference.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) Limitations on subcontracting. A small business concern subject to the limitations on subcontracting is required to comply with the following:\n\n(i)For a contract or order assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for services (except construction), the concern will not pay more than 50 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the concern's 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract.\n\n(ii)For a contract or order assigned a NAICS code for supplies or products (other than a procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies or products), the concern will not pay more than 50 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the concern's 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. When a contract includes both supplies and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract.\n\n(iii)For a contract or order assigned a NAICS code for general construction, the concern will not pay more than 85 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the concern's 85 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.\n\n(iv)For a contract or order assigned a NAICS code for construction by special trade contractors, the concern will not pay more than 75 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the concern’s 75 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.\n\n(2) Compliance period. A small business contractor subject to the limitations on subcontracting is required to comply with the limitations on subcontracting—\n\n(i)For a contract that has been set aside, either by the end of the base term and then by the end of each subsequent option period, or by the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract, at the contracting officer's discretion; and\n\n(ii)For an order set aside under a contract as described in 19.504(a), (b), or (c)(1)(i) or an order issued in accordance with 19.504(c)(1)(ii), by the end of the performance period for the order.\n\n(c) Nonmanufacturer rule. The nonmanufacturer rule applies to nonmanufacturers in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and to kit assemblers who are nonmanufacturers in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n(1) Nonmanufacturers. Any concern, including a supplier, that is awarded a contract or order subject to the nonmanufacturer rule, other than a construction or service acquisition, but proposes to furnish an end item that it did not itself manufacture, process, or produce (i.e., a “nonmanufacturer”), is required to—\n\n(i)Provide an end item that a small business has manufactured, processed, or produced in the United States or its outlying areas (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for determining the manufacturer of an end item);\n\n(ii)Not exceed 500 employees, or 150 employees for information technology value-added resellers under NAICS code 541519;\n\n(iii)Be primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sell the type of item being supplied; and\n\n(iv)Take ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practice; for example, providing storage, transportation, or delivery.\n\n(2) Kit assemblers. When the end item being acquired is a kit of supplies—\n\n(i)The offeror may not exceed 500 employees, or 150 employees for information technology value-added resellers under NAICS code 541519; and\n\n(ii)At least 50 percent of the total cost of the components of the kit shall be manufactured, processed, or produced in the United States or its outlying areas by business concerns that are small under the size standards for the NAICS codes of the components of the kit.\n\n(3) Identification of manufacturers. For the purposes of applying the nonmanufacturer rule, the manufacturer, processor, or producer is the concern that manufactures, processes, or produces an end item with its own facilities (i.e., transforms raw materials, miscellaneous parts, or components into the end item being acquired). See 13 CFR 121.406(b)(2).\n\n(4) Waiver of nonmanufacturer rule.\n\n(i)The SBA may grant an individual or a class waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule to allow a nonmanufacturer to provide an end item of an other than small business without regard to the place of manufacture, processing, or production.\n\n(A) Class waiver. An agency may request that SBA waive the requirement at paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section for a specific product or class of products. See 13 CFR 121.1202 for an explanation of when SBA will issue a class waiver.\n\n(B) Individual waiver. The contracting officer may also request a waiver of the requirements at paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section for an individual acquisition once the contracting officer determines through market research that no known small business manufacturers, processors, or producers in the United States or its outlying areas can reasonably be expected to offer an end item meeting the requirements of the solicitation. This type of waiver is known as an individual waiver and would apply only to a specific acquisition.\n\n(ii) Waiver requests. Requests for waivers shall include the content specified at 13 CFR 121.1204 and shall be sent via email to nmrwaivers@sba.gov or by mail to the—Director, Office of Government Contracting, Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416.\n\n(iii) List of class waivers. For the most current listing of class waivers, contact the SBA Office of Government Contracting or go to https://www.sba.gov/document/support-non-manufacturer-rule-class-waiver-list.\n\n(iv) Notification of waiver. The contracting officer shall provide potential offerors with written notification of any class or individual waiver in the solicitation. If providing the notification after solicitation issuance, the contracting officer shall provide potential offerors a reasonable amount of additional time to respond to the solicitation.\n\n(5) Multiple-item acquisitions.\n\n(i)If at least 50 percent of the estimated contract value is composed of items that are manufactured, processed, or produced by small business concerns, then a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule is not required. There is no requirement that each item acquired in a multiple-item acquisition be manufactured, processed, or produced by a small business in the United States or its outlying areas.\n\n(ii)If more than 50 percent of the estimated acquisition cost is composed of items manufactured, processed, or produced by other than small business concerns, then a waiver is required. SBA may grant an individual waiver for one or more items in an acquisition in order to ensure that at least 50 percent of the cost of the items to be supplied by the nonmanufacturer comes from small business manufacturers, processors, and producers in the United States or its outlying areas or are subject to a waiver.\n\n(iii)If a small business offeror is both a manufacturer of item(s) and a nonmanufacturer of other item(s) for an acquisition, the contracting officer shall apply the manufacturer size standard.\n\n(a) [Reserved]\n\n(b) [Reserved]\n\n(c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, in solicitations and contracts involving total small business set-asides. This includes multiple-award contracts when orders may be set aside for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3), as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F). Use the clause at 52.219-6 with its Alternate I when including FPI in the competition in accordance with 19.502-7.\n\n(d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-7, Notice of Partial Small Business Set-Aside, in solicitations and contracts involving partial small business set-asides. This includes part or parts of multiple-award contracts, including those described in 38.101. Use the clause at 52.219-7 with its Alternate I when including FPI in the competition in accordance with 19.502-7.\n\n(e) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, in solicitations and contracts—\n\n(1)For supplies, services, and construction, if any portion of the requirement is to be set aside for small business and the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and in any solicitations and contracts that are set aside or awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, or 19.15, regardless of dollar value. This includes multiple-award contracts when orders may be set aside for small business concerns, as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F), and when orders may be issued directly to a small business concern as described in 19.504(c)(1)(ii). For contracts that are set aside, the contracting officer shall indicate in paragraph (f) of the clause whether compliance with the limitations on subcontracting is required at the contract or order level;\n\n(2) Using the HUBZone price evaluation preference. However, if the prospective contractor waived the use of the price evaluation preference, or is an other than small business, do not insert the clause in the resultant contract.\n\n(f)\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-13, Notice of Set-Aside of Orders, in all solicitations for multiple-award contracts under which orders may be set aside for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3), and all contracts awarded from such solicitations.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-13 with its Alternate I in all full and open solicitations and contracts for multiple-award contracts under which orders will be set aside for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) if the conditions in 19.502-2 are met at the time of order set-aside, and the specific program eligibility requirements, as applicable, are also then met.\n\n(g)\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.219-31, Notice of Small Business Reserve, in solicitations for multiple-award contracts that have reserves.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-32 Orders Issued Directly Under Small Business Reserves, in solicitations and the resulting multiple-award contracts that have reserves.\n\n(h)\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.219-33, Nonmanufacturer Rule, in solicitations and contracts, including multiple-award contracts, when orders may be set aside for small business concerns as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F), and when orders may be issued directly to a small business concern as described in 19.504(c)(1)(ii)), when—\n\n(i)the item being acquired has been assigned a manufacturing or supply NAICS code, and–\n\n(ii)\n\n(A)Any portion of the requirement is to be–\n\n(1)Set aside for small business and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold; or\n\n(2)Set aside or awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, or 19.15, regardless of dollar value; or\n\n(B) Using the HUBZone price evaluation preference. However, if the prospective contractor waived the use of the price evaluation preference, or is an other than small business, do not insert the clause in the resultant contract.\n\n(2)The contracting officer shall not insert the clause at 52.219-33 when the Small Business Administration has waived the nonmanufacturer rule (see 19.505(c)(4)).\n\nAny contractor receiving a contract with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that small business, veteran-owned small business (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), and women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns will have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with its efficient performance. It is further the policy of the United States that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their subcontracts with small business, VOSB concerns, SDVOSB concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, SDB concerns, and WOSB concerns.\n\n(a)\n\n(1) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, section 8(d) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637( d)) imposes the following requirements regarding subcontracting with small businesses and small business subcontracting plans:\n\n(i) In negotiated acquisitions, each solicitation of offers to perform a contract that is expected to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting possibilities, shall require the apparently successful offeror to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan. If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award. For a multiple-award contract with more than one North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, see paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n(ii) In sealed bidding acquisitions, each invitation for bids to perform a contract that is expected to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting possibilities, shall require the bidder selected for award to submit a subcontracting plan. If the selected bidder fails to submit a plan within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the bidder will be ineligible for award. For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, see paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n(iii) Each contract modification that causes the value of a contract without a subcontracting plan to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction), shall require the contractor to submit a subcontracting plan for the contract, if the contracting officer determines that subcontracting opportunities exist. For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, the solicitation referenced in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall require the apparently successful offeror to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan for either the distinct portion(s) or category(ies) of their proposal for which the offeror is other than small or for the entirety of their proposal, at the offeror's discretion. When determining the need for a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall consider the cumulative dollar value of the portion(s) or category(ies) of the offeror's proposal for which the offeror is other than small.\n\n(ii) For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, the modification referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section shall require the contractor to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan for either the distinct portion(s) or category(ies) of the contract for which the contractor is other than small or for the entirety of their contract, at the contractor's discretion. When determining the need for a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall consider the cumulative dollar value of the portion(s) or category(ies) of the contract for which the contractor is other than small.\n\n(b) Subcontracting plans (see paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section) are not required–\n\n(1) From small business concerns;\n\n(2) For personal services contracts;\n\n(3) For contracts or contract modifications that will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas; or\n\n(4) For modifications that are within the scope of the contract and the contract does not contain the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns.\n\n(c) As stated in 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(9), any contractor or subcontractor failing to comply in good faith with the requirements of the subcontracting plan is in material breach of its contract. Further, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) directs that a contractor’s failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages.\n\n(d) As authorized by 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(12), certain costs incurred by a mentor firm in providing developmental assistance to a protégé firm under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor-Protégé Program, may be credited as if they were subcontract awards to a protégé firm for the purpose of determining whether the mentor firm attains the applicable goals under any subcontracting plan entered into with any executive agency. However, the mentor-protégé agreement must have been approved by the Director, Small Business Programs of the cognizant DoD military department or defense agency, before developmental assistance costs may be credited against subcontract goals. A list of approved agreements may be obtained at https://business.defense.gov/Programs/Mentor-Protege-Program/.\n\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, to be eligible as a subcontractor under the program, a concern must represent itself as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern.\n\n(1) To represent itself as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern, a concern must meet the appropriate definition (see 2.101 and 19.001). For subcontracting purposes, a concern is small if it does not exceed the size standard for the NAICS code that the prime contractor determines best describes the product or service being acquired by the subcontract.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) The prime contractor may accept a subcontractor's written representations of its size and socioeconomic status as a small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or a women-owned small business, if the subcontractor represents that the size and socioeconomic status representation with its offer are current, accurate, and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontracts; or\n\n(ii) The prime contractor may accept a subcontractor's representation of its size and socioeconomic status as a small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or a women-owned small business in the System for Award Management (SAM) if–\n\n(A) The subcontractor is registered in SAM; and\n\n(B) The subcontractor represents that the size and socioeconomic status representations made in SAM are current, accurate and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontract.\n\n(iii) The prime contractor may not require the use of SAM for the purposes of representing size or socioeconomic status in connection with a subcontract.\n\n(iv) In accordance with 13 CFR 121.411, 126.900, 127.700, and 128.600, a prime contractor acting in good faith is not liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors regarding the subcontractor's size or socioeconomic status.\n\n(b) The contractor, the contracting officer, or any other interested party can challenge a subcontractor's size status representation by filing a protest, in accordance with 13 CFR 121.1001 through 121.1008.\n\n(c)\n\n(1) In accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1626, the following procedures apply:\n\n(i) Subcontracts awarded to an ANC or Indian tribe shall be counted towards the subcontracting goals for small business and small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, regardless of the size or Small Business Administration certification status of the ANC or Indian tribe.\n\n(ii) Where one or more subcontractors are in the subcontract tier between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate the appropriate contractor(s) to count the subcontract towards its small business and small disadvantaged business subcontracting goals.\n\n(A) In most cases, the appropriate contractor is the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe.\n\n(B) If the ANC or Indian tribe designates more than one contractor to count the subcontract toward its goals, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate only a portion of the total subcontract award to each contractor. The sum of the amounts designated to various contractors cannot exceed the total value of the subcontract.\n\n(C) The ANC or Indian tribe shall give a copy of the written designation to the contracting officer, the prime contractor, and the subcontractors in between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe within 30 days of the date of the subcontract award.\n\n(D) If the contracting officer does not receive a copy of the ANC's or the Indian tribe’s written designation within 30 days of the subcontract award, the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe will be considered the designated contractor.\n\n(2) A contractor acting in good faith may rely on the written representation of an ANC or an Indian tribe as to the status of the ANC or Indian tribe unless an interested party challenges its status or the contracting officer has independent reason to question its status. In the event of a challenge of a representation of an ANC or Indian tribe, the interested parties shall follow the procedures at 26.103(b) through (e).\n\n(d) Protests challenging the socioeconomic status of a HUBZone small business concern must be filed in accordance with 13 CFR 126.801.\n\n(a) Each subcontracting plan required under 19.301-2(e) and 19.702(a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) shall include-\n\n(1) Separate percentage goals for using small business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian tribes) and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors;\n\n(2) A statement of the total dollars planned to be subcontracted and a statement of the total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian tribes) and women-owned small business concerns, as a percentage of total subcontract dollars. For individual subcontracting plans only, a contracting officer may require the goals referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to be calculated as a percentage of total contract dollars, in addition to the goals established as a percentage of total subcontract dollars;\n\n(3) A description of the principal types of supplies and services to be subcontracted and an identification of types of supplies or services planned for subcontracting to small business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), and women-owned small business concerns;\n\n(4) A description of the method used to develop the subcontracting goals;\n\n(5) A description of the method used to identify potential sources for solicitation purposes;\n\n(6) A statement as to whether or not the offeror included indirect costs in establishing subcontracting goals (for commercial plans, see paragraph (d) of this section), and a description of the method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with small business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), and women-owned small business concerns;\n\n(7) The name of an individual employed by the offeror who will administer the offeror’s subcontracting program, and a description of the duties of the individual;\n\n(8) A description of the efforts the offeror will make to ensure that small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts;\n\n(9) Assurances that the offeror will include the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns (see 19.708(a)), in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities, and that the offeror will require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) that receive subcontracts in excess of $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction) to adopt a plan that complies with the requirements of the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (see 19.708(b));\n\n(10) Assurances that the offeror will-\n\n(i) Cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required;\n\n(ii) Submit periodic reports so that the Government can determine the extent of compliance by the offeror with the subcontracting plan;\n\n(iii) After November 30, 2017, include subcontracting data for each order when reporting subcontracting achievements for indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts with individual subcontracting plans where the contract is intended for use by multiple agencies;\n\n(iv) Submit the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR), and the Summary Subcontract Report (SSR) using the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) ( http://www.esrs.gov), following the instructions in the eSRS.\n\n(A) The ISR shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period. When a contracting officer rejects an ISR, the contractor is required to submit a revised ISR within 30 days of receiving the notice of the ISR rejection.\n\n(B) The SSR shall be submitted annually by October 30 for the twelve-month period ending September 30. When an SSR is rejected, the contractor is required to submit a revised SSR within 30 days of receiving the notice of SSR rejection;\n\n(v) Ensure that its subcontractors with subcontracting plans agree to submit the ISR and/or the SSR using the eSRS;\n\n(vi) Provide its prime contract number, its unique entity identifier, and the e-mail address of the offeror’s official responsible for acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISRs to all first-tier subcontractors with subcontracting plans so they can enter this information into the eSRS when submitting their ISRs; and\n\n(vii) Require that each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan provide the prime contract number, its own unique entity identifier, and the e-mail address of the subcontractor’s official responsible for acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISRs, to its subcontractors with subcontracting plans;\n\n(11) A description of the types of records that will be maintained concerning procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the plan, including establishing source lists; and a description of the offeror’s efforts to locate small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns and to award subcontracts to them;\n\n(12) Assurances that the offeror will make a good faith effort to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials, or obtain the performance of construction work from the small business concerns that the offeror used in preparing the bid or proposal, in the same or greater scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal. Responding to a request for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or proposal. An offeror used a small business concern in preparing the bid or proposal if–\n\n(i) The offeror identifies the small business concern as a subcontractor in the bid or proposal or associated small business subcontracting plan, to furnish certain supplies or perform a portion of the contract; or\n\n(ii) The offeror used the small business concern's pricing or cost information or technical expertise in preparing the bid or proposal, where there is written evidence of an intent or understanding that the small business concern will be awarded a subcontract for the related work if the offeror is awarded the contract;\n\n(13) Assurances that the contractor will provide the contracting officer with a written explanation if the contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services or materials or obtain the performance of construction work as described in (a)(12) of this section. This written explanation will be submitted to the contracting officer within 30 days of contract completion;\n\n(14) Assurances that the contractor will not prohibit a subcontractor from discussing with the contracting officer any material matter pertaining to payment to or utilization of a subcontractor; and\n\n(15) Assurances that the offeror will pay its small business subcontractors on time and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subcontract, and notify the contracting officer if the offeror pays a reduced or an untimely payment to a small business subcontractor (see 52.242-5).\n\n(b) Contractors may establish, on a plant or division-wide basis, a master plan (see 19.701) that contains all the elements required by the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, except goals. Master plans shall be effective for a 3-year period after approval by the contracting officer; however, it is incumbent upon contractors to maintain and update master plans. Changes required to update master plans are not effective until approved by the contracting officer. A master plan, when incorporated in an individual plan, shall apply to that contract throughout the life of the contract.\n\n(c) For multiyear contracts or contracts containing options, the cumulative value of the basic contract and all options is considered in determining whether a subcontracting plan is necessary. If a subcontracting plan is necessary and the offeror is submitting an individual subcontracting plan, the individual subcontracting plan shall contain all the elements required by paragraph (a) of this section and shall contain separate statements and goals based on total subcontract dollars for the basic contract and for each option.\n\n(d) A commercial plan (as defined in 19.701) is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial products and commercial services. The subcontracting goals established for a commercial plan shall include all indirect costs with the exception of those such as the following: Employee salaries and benefits; payments for petty cash; depreciation; interest; income taxes; property taxes; lease payments; bank fees; fines, claims, and dues; original equipment manufacturer relationships during warranty periods (negotiated up front with the product); utilities and other services purchased from a municipality or an entity solely authorized by the municipality to provide those services in a particular geographical region; and philanthropic contributions. Once a contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service. The contractor shall—\n\n(1) Submit the commercial plan to either the first contracting officer awarding a contract subject to the plan during the contractor’s fiscal year, or, if the contractor has ongoing contracts with commercial plans, to the contracting officer responsible for the contract with the latest completion date. The contracting officer shall negotiate the commercial plan for the Government. The approved commercial plan shall remain in effect during the contractor’s fiscal year for all Government contracts in effect during that period;\n\n(2) Submit a new commercial plan, 30 working days before the end of the Contractor’s fiscal year, to the contracting officer responsible for the uncompleted Government contract with the latest completion date. The contractor must provide to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract subject to the plan, the identity of the contracting officer that will be negotiating the new plan;\n\n(3) When the new commercial plan is approved, provide a copy of the approved plan to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract that is subject to the plan; and\n\n(4) Comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (a)(10) of this section by submitting one SSR that includes all indirect costs, except as described in paragraph (d) of this section, in eSRS, for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report will be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the contracting officer who approved the plan. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government’s fiscal year.\n\n(a) Insert the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, in solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold unless-\n\n(1) A personal services contract is contemplated (see 37.104); or\n\n(2) The contract, together with all of its subcontracts, will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) Insert the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations and contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities, are expected to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction of any public facility), and are required to include the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, unless the acquisition is set aside or is to be accomplished under the 8(a) program. When-\n\n(i) Contracting by sealed bidding rather than by negotiation, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I;\n\n(ii) Contracting by negotiation, and subcontracting plans are required with initial proposals as provided for in 19.705-2(d), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II;\n\n(iii) The contract action will not be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System pursuant to 4.606(c)(5), or (c)(6), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate III; or\n\n(iv) Incorporating a subcontracting plan due to a modification as provided for in 19.702(a)(1)(iii), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate IV.\n\n(2) Insert the clause at 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages-Subcontracting Plan, in all solicitations and contracts containing the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or the clause with its Alternate I, II, III, or IV.\n\n(c)\n\n(1) The contracting officer may, when contracting by negotiation, insert in solicitations and contracts a clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program, when a subcontracting plan is required (see 19.702), and inclusion of a monetary incentive is, in the judgment of the contracting officer, necessary to increase subcontracting opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, and is commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract; unless the conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are applicable. The contracting officer may vary the terms of the clause as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) Various approaches may be used in the development of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns’ subcontracting incentives. They can take many forms, from a fully quantified schedule of payments based on actual subcontract achievement to an award-fee approach employing subjective evaluation criteria (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). The incentive should not reward the contractor for results other than those that are attributable to the contractor’s efforts under the incentive subcontracting program.\n\n(3) As specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the contracting officer may include small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontracting as one of the factors to be considered in determining the award fee in a cost-plus-award-fee contract; in such cases, however, the contracting officer shall not use the clause at 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program.\n\nThrough their cooperative efforts, the SBA and an agency match the agency's requirements with the capabilities of 8(a) participants to establish a basis for the agency to contract with the SBA under the program. Selection is initiated in one of three ways:\n\n(a) The SBA advises the contracting activity of an 8(a) participant's capabilities through a search letter and requests the contracting activity to identify acquisitions to support the participant's business plans. In these instances, the SBA will provide at a minimum the following information in order to enable the contracting activity to match an acquisition to the participant's capabilities:\n\n(1) Identification of the participant and its owners.\n\n(2) Background information on the participant, including any and all information pertaining to the participant's technical ability and capacity to perform.\n\n(3) The participant's present production capacity and related facilities.\n\n(4) The extent to which contracting assistance is needed in the present and the future, described in terms that will enable the agency to relate the participant's plans to present and future agency requirements.\n\n(5) If construction is involved, the request shall also include the following:\n\n(i) A participant's capabilities in and qualifications for accomplishing various categories of construction work typically found in North American Industrial Category System subsector 236 (construction of buildings), subsector 237 (heavy and civil engineering construction), or subsector 238 (specialty trade contractors).\n\n(ii) The participant’s capacity in each construction category in terms of estimated dollar value (e.g., electrical, up to $100,000).\n\n(b) The SBA identifies a specific requirement for one or more 8(a) participant(s) and sends a requirements letter to the agency's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, or for the Department of Defense, Office of Small Business Programs, requesting the contracting office offer the acquisition to the 8(a) program. In these instances, in addition to the information in paragraph (a) of this section, the SBA will provide-\n\n(1) A clear identification of the acquisition sought; e.g., project name or number;\n\n(2) A statement as to how the required equipment and real property will be provided in order to ensure that the participant will be fully capable of satisfying the agency's requirements;\n\n(3) If construction, information as to the bonding capability of the participant(s); and\n\n(4) Either-\n\n(i) If a sole source request-\n\n(A) The reasons why the participant is considered suitable for this particular acquisition; e.g., previous contracts for the same or similar supply or service; and\n\n(B) A statement that the participant is eligible in terms of its small business size status relative to the assigned NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets; or\n\n(ii) If competitive, a statement that at least two 8(a) participants are considered capable of satisfying the agency's requirements and a statement that the participants are also eligible in terms of their small business size status relative to the assigned NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets. If requested by the contracting office, SBA will identify at least two such participants and provide information concerning the participants’ capabilities.\n\n(c) Agencies may also review other proposed acquisitions for the purpose of identifying requirements which may be offered to the SBA. Where agencies independently, or through the self marketing efforts of an 8(a) participant, identify a requirement for the 8(a) program, they may offer on behalf of a specific 8(a) participant, for the 8(a) program in general, or for 8(a) competition.\n\n(a) The contracting officer shall assign contract administration functions, as required, based on the location of the 8(a) contractor (see Federal Directory of Contract Administration Services Components (available via the Internet at https://piee.eb.mil/pcm/xhtml/unauth/index.xhtml )).\n\n(b) The agency shall distribute copies of the contract(s) in accordance with part 4. All contracts and modifications, if any, shall be distributed to both the SBA and the 8(a) contractor in accordance with the timeframes set forth in 4.201.\n\n(c) To the extent consistent with the contracting activity’s capability and resources, 8(a) contractors furnishing requirements shall be afforded production and technical assistance, including, when appropriate, identification of causes of deficiencies in their products and suggested corrective action to make such products acceptable.\n\n(d) For 8(a) contracts exceeding 5 years including options, the contracting officer shall verify in DSBS or SAM that the concern is an SBA-certified 8(a) participant no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract. If the concern is not an SBA-certified 8(a) participant, the contracting officer shall not exercise the option (see 13 CFR 124.521(e)(2)).\n\n(e) An 8(a) contract, whether in the base or an option year, must be terminated for convenience if the 8(a) contractor to which it was awarded transfers ownership or control of the firm or if the contract is transferred or novated for any reason to another firm, unless the Administrator of the SBA waives the requirement for contract termination (13 CFR 124.515). The Administrator may waive the termination requirement only if certain conditions exist. Moreover, a waiver of the requirement for termination is permitted only if the 8(a) contractor's request for waiver is made to the SBA prior to the actual relinquishment of ownership or control, except in the case of death or incapacity where the waiver must be submitted within 60 calendar days after such an occurrence. The clauses in the contract entitled \"Special 8(a) Contract Conditions\" and \"Special 8(a) Subcontract Conditions\" require the SBA and the 8(a) subcontractor to notify the contracting officer when ownership of the firm is being transferred. When the contracting officer receives information that an 8(a) contractor is planning to transfer ownership or control to another firm, the contracting officer shall take action immediately to preserve the option of waiving the termination requirement. The contracting officer shall determine the timing of the proposed transfer and its effect on contract performance and mission support. If the contracting officer determines that the SBA does not intend to waive the termination requirement, and termination of the contract would severely impair attainment of the agency's program objectives or mission, the contracting officer shall immediately notify the SBA in writing that the agency is requesting a waiver. Within 15 business days thereafter, or such longer period as agreed to by the agency and the SBA, the agency head must either confirm or withdraw the request for waiver. Unless a waiver is approved by the SBA, the contracting officer must terminate the contract for convenience upon receipt of a written request by the SBA. This requirement for a convenience termination does not affect the Government's right to terminate for default if the cause for termination of an 8(a) contract is other than the transfer of ownership or control.\n\n(a) Once a requirement has been accepted by SBA into the 8(a) program, any follow-on requirements (see definition at 13 CFR 124.3) shall remain in the 8(a) program unless—\n\n(1) SBA agrees to release the requirement from the 8(a) program for a follow-on, non-8(a) procurement in accordance with 13 CFR 124.504(d) (see paragraph (b) of this section); or\n\n(2) There is a mandatory source (see 8.002 or 8.003; also see paragraph (f) of this section).\n\n(b) To obtain release of a requirement for a follow-on, non-8(a) procurement, (other than a mandatory source listed at 8.002 or 8.003), the contracting officer shall make a written request to, and receive concurrence from, the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development.\n\n(c)\n\n(1) The written request to the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development shall indicate\n\n(i) Whether the agency has achieved its small disadvantaged business goal;\n\n(ii) Whether the agency has achieved its HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, or small business goal(s); and\n\n(iii) Whether the requirement is critical to the business development of the 8(a) contractor that is currently performing the requirement.\n\n(2) Generally, a requirement that was previously accepted into the 8(a) program will only be released for procurements outside the 8(a) program when the contracting activity agency agrees to set aside the requirement under the small business, HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs.\n\n(3) The requirement that a follow-on procurement must be released from the 8(a) program in order for it to be fulfilled outside the 8(a) program does not apply to task or delivery orders offered to and accepted into the 8(a) program, where the basic contract was not accepted into the 8(a) program.\n\n(d)\n\n(1) When a contracting officer decides that a requirement previously procured under the 8(a) program is a new requirement and not a follow-on requirement to an 8(a) contract(s), the contracting officer shall coordinate with and submit a written notice to the SBA District Office servicing the 8(a) incumbent firm and to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) indicating that the agency intends to procure the requirement outside the 8(a) program (see 19.810(a)(4)).\n\n(2) The written notice shall include a copy of the acquisition plan, if available; the performance work statement (PWS), statement of work (SOW), or statement of objectives (SOO) for the new contract requirement; and the values of the existing 8(a) contract(s) and the new contract requirement.\n\n(e)\n\n(1) When a contracting officer decides to procure a follow-on requirement to an 8(a) contract using an existing, limited competition contracting vehicle that is not available to all 8(a) participants, and the current or previous 8(a) contract was available to all 8(a) participants, the contracting officer shall coordinate with and submit a written notice to the SBA District Office servicing the 8(a) incumbent firm and to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) indicating the intent to do so.\n\n(2) The written notice shall include a copy of the acquisition plan, if a"
