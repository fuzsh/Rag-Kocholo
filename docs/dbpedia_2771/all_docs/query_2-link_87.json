        "text": "The New Yorker name is widely associated with opulence and extreme luxury. As the Chrysler brand’s flagship sedan, the New Yorker had been around since 1939. It had gradually grown larger in size and weight with each new generation, until peaking in the 70’s.\n\nDefiant in its response to the fuel crisis of the time, the New Yorker resisted the downsizing trend that GM and later Ford gave in to. Chrysler would gradually downsize starting with the 1979 models, but it was hardly a concession to fuel economy. The ninth generation New Yorker “R –body” was a short-lived blip on the Chrysler radar as it struggled to make do with the realities of a pending bankruptcy and the need to modernize its aging platforms.\n\nThe 1979 to 1981 model years would be the last of the truly big rear wheel drive New Yorkers. The classic American luxury car proportions were handsome enough that Chrysler sold very similar versions of this car under names like Newport, St. Regis and Gran Fury.\n\nThese cars competed with Chevrolet’s Caprice/Impala and Ford’s Crown Victoria. The New Yorker in its top new Fifth Avenue trim competed directly with the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham and Lincoln Continental.\n\nWhile lesser cars like the St. Regis could be had with six cylinder engines, V8 power had always been a hallmark of the New Yorker. Unfortunately by the late 70’s the once powerful engines were merely shadows of what they once were. Buyers could choose from a 5.2 or 5.9 L, but the most powerful 4- barrel version of the nearly 6 liter could only muster 170hp.\n\nThis sad tale could be told by any number of American car manufacturers in the early post fuel crunch years. With Chrysler and the New Yorker, moving slowly had its price in the quickly evolving luxury marketplace.\n\nLate or not, the New Yorker’s looks were right on time. The hidden headlights and crisp modern lines were very much the direction Cadillac and Lincoln had been moving in with their downsized models. The New Yorker was further distinguished from similar models like the Newport by its distinctive landau roof.\n\nExterior appearances aside, the New Yorkers of this era still used old world technology, like carburetted engines and multileaf rear suspensions. The 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission was the only one available and could trace its roots to the 60’s. As the 80’s dawned, the competition had begun flirting with electronic fuel injection, independent suspensions and digital dashes, making the Chrysler feel dated, although it looked contemporary by American Big Three luxury car standards..\n\nChrysler would embrace some new technologies with a vengeance (digital dashes for instance) in later New Yorkers, but no significant changes would occur until 1982. The interiors were lush with leather and vinyl on many models. All models featured individually adjustable seats with a folding center armrest. All the luxury features of day were standard while Chrysler did offer simple new or current technologies like digital clocks and cassette stereo sound systems.\n\nThe need to dart out of a jam in traffic reminded the New Yorker driver that a bit of luxury was lost under the hood, but performance was well within expectations of the luxury buyer of the day. The top versions of the New Yorker with the 5.9L were down right spritely at 12 seconds to 60 mph compared with base models that featured the 5.2. with only 110 hp.\n\nWith about 3700 lbs to tow, acceleration in the least powerful models was closer to a bus needing more than 16 seconds to reach highway speeds. 1979 would be the best year sales wise, as the new design struck a cord with buyers.\n\nVery few changes occurred beyond a new grille in 1981 and the reshuffling of engine tuning and colors. Sales had taken a dramatic plunge after 1979, falling to just under 7,000 units sold by the end of 1981.\n\nA downsized 82’ would arrive. Still with rear wheel drive, but this time with a single smaller V8 engine offered. The changes would get more dramatic after that. The New Yorker did not recover from all the desperate changes until the debut of the LH versions of the early 90’s."
