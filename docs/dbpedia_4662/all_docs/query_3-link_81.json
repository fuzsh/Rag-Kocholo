        "text": "The London School of Economics main teaching campus is based right in the heart of central London.\n\nThe LSE campus is comprised of a mixture of new and more traditional architecture, suitable for films set in any time period over the last 100 years.\n\nThe Sir Arthur Lewis Building was originally constructed in 1905 and is a Grade II listed building. The Sir Arthur Lewis Building is one of LSE's more traditional buildings and has already been the location for filming of television period dramas.\n\nThe LSE is also known for it's continually developing campus, bringing in new, innovative and modern architecture.\n\nThe Cheng Kin Ku Building was intially constructed in 1912 but was redeveloped in 2008. Therefore whilst maintaing it's traditional exterior face, the building is completely modern on the inside with modern teaching spaces and central areas.\n\nThe teaching spaces in the Cheng Kin Ku Building have also been the location for films requiring lecture theatre or University teaching space setting.\n\nThe Cheng Kin Ku Building 8th floor roof terrace offers views across the London Skyline, which makes it an ideal location for filming interviews.\n\nEven the iconic entrance of LSE's oldest building has been the feature of Hollywood action movies.\n\nAs the LSE is a busy University campus, filming times would be limited to weekends and vacation times.\n\nFor more information or if you have a filming enquiry, please email event.services@lse.ac.uk or call 0207 955 7461."
