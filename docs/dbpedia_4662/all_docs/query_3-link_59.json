Explore the ancient cloisters that became the snow-covered quadrangle where Harry magically releases Hedwig in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and walk in the footsteps of Harry, Ron and Hermione in The Chapter House, which appeared in the Chamber of Secrets as the setting for Professor McGonagall's transfiguration classroom. We doubt you'll be able to turn animals into water goblets though.\n\nFind out more\n\n2\n\nAlnwick Castle\n\nAlnwick\n\nExplore the grounds of Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and imagine you’re part of Madame Hooch’s flying lesson by joining the resident wizarding professors for broomstick training sessions on the very spot where Harry had his first lesson in the first film.

Studio Tour\n\nLeavesden\n\nWizards, squibs and even muggles can discover the magic of Harry Potter on the Warner Bros Studio Tour.

Leadenhall Market in the City of London was used as Diagon Alley in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, whilst the entrance to wizard’s pub, the Leaky Cauldron, is in real life an optician in Bull’s Head Passage.\n\nFind out more\n\n6\n\nGloucester Cathedral\n\nGloucester\n\nVisit one of the oldest stars of the Harry Potter films with a trip to Gloucester Cathedral. Its beautiful cloisters, complete with awe inspiring fan vaulted ceilings, lead to the Gryffindor Common Room, and have also been stormed through by a troll and graced by the fat lady.\n\nFind out more\n\n7\n\nGoathland Station\n\nGoathland\n\nClimb aboard the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where you can enjoy a ride through picturesque countryside before pulling into Goathland Station, which doubled as Hogsmeade station in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nFind out more\n\n8\n\nKing's Cross Station\n\nLondon\n\nThe Hogwarts Express departs from Platform 9¾ at King’s Cross Station, which is in the arched wall between platforms 4 and 5. If that seems short on magic, head towards the real-life entrance to platforms 9, 10 and 11 on the west side of the station where you’ll find a trolley disappearing into the magical realm through a wall with the sign: Platform 9¾.\n\nFind out more\n\n9\n\nChrist Church College\n\nOxford\n\nWander around the cloisters and quadrangles of Christ Church College where many of the Hogwarts scenes in the first movie were filmed.
