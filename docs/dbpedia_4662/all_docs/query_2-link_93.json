        "text": "A24 and Imax have teamed up to bring past A24 titles to large format fans in a new monthly screening series kicking off March 27. The Imax debut of Alex Garland’s 2014 sci-fi classic Ex Machina is first up with the presentation including an “exclusive sneak peek” at Garland’s upcoming Civil War.\n\nCivil War, also from A24, premieres at SXSW tomorrow and debuts in theaters, including Imax, April 12.\n\nThe initiative, which looks to serve both partners well, calls for Imax to digitally remaster films from A24’s library of 140+ features for the screening series, which will run once a month for the next year. Ari Aster’s Hereditary (2018) is next up on April 24 followed by the Safdie Brothers’ Uncut Gems (2019) on May 22.\n\nScreenings will be held at more than 300 Imax locations nationwide and some international theaters.\n\nA24 and Imax most recently partnered on the Imax-exclusive launch of the 1984 Talking Heads’ concert film Stop Making Sense launched by a live event Imax event at TIFF last year with the iconic band’s first reunion in 20 years."
