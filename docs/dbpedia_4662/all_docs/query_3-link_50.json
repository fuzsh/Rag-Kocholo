        "text": "Have you ever had a first-class upgrade turn into a whirlwind romance in London?\n\nThen you‚Äôre overdue, aren‚Äôt you?\n\nThe London rom-com Upgraded, starring Camila Mendes and Archie Renaux, hit Amazon Prime‚Äôs streaming service in February, sending us swooning for a meet-cute with a UK backdrop.\n\nCamila Mendes in Upgraded. Image Credit: Paul Stephenson/Amazon MGM Studios\n\nWhere was Upgraded (2024) filmed?\n\nUpgraded was shot exclusively in England, including various locations in London, though not all of the ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù scenes were actually filmed in the UK capital.\n\nWe‚Äôre treated to a lovely aerial shot of the Thames with Tower Bridge in full focus. We also get a good look at Westminster Palace, Buckingham Palace, The Shard, and St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral as Ana drives into London.\n\nUpgraded filming locations in London\n\nWalk in Ana‚Äôs (or ‚ÄúClaire‚Äôs‚Äù) shoes at these Upgraded filming locations across London.\n\nTate Modern\n\nClosest station: London Bridge\n\nTwo kisses in the same spot. The first, a steamy kiss outside of the Tate Modern, facing the iconic art gallery. The second is featured in the same montage, but doesn‚Äôt show the Tate; rather, the Tate Modern is behind the camera and the smootchers are set with their backs to the Millennium Bridge.\n\nBank Station\n\nClosest station: Bank (London Underground)\n\nAna couldn‚Äôt have picked a better tube station to have her down-and-out suitcase drag through London. Bank Station connects to the Circle, Northern, Waterloo & City, and DLR lines that‚Äôll get you nearly anywhere you want to go in central London.\n\nBow Lane\n\nClosest stations: Mansion House (London Underground) | Cannon Street (London Underground)\n\nAna‚Äôs first errand takes her through the streets of London, with a backdrop of Bow Lane‚Äôs narrow street of shops and caf√©s.\n\nCamila Mendes in Upgraded. Image Credit: Amazon MGM Studios\n\nUpgraded filming locations in England\n\nUpgraded left London behind for a handful of scenes.\n\nThe Mercer Art Gallery\n\nClosest station: Harrogate\n\nAna had quite the speed-walk ahead of her when she had to go from her hotel in ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù to the London Erwin Auction House. The auction house scenes were filmed at The Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate, which is north of Leeds and roughly 3 hours from London King's Cross.\n\nRoyal Suite at Grantley Hall\n\nClosest station: Harrogate\n\nThe scene where Ana pays a visit to Will‚Äôs mom‚Äôs home is depicted as taking place at the fictitious Carlton Hotel in London, but the scene was actually filmed in the Royal Suite at Grantley Hall in Ripon, North Yorkshire.\n\nDoubleTree by Hilton Harrogate Majestic Hotel & Spa\n\nClosest station: Hornbeam Park\n\nIn Upgraded, the hotel Ana stays at may look like one of the best hotels in London, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äî because it‚Äôs not even in London. The DoubleTree by Hilton Harrogate Majestic Hotel & Spa in Harrogate was used.\n\nTeesside International Airport\n\nClosest station: Teesside Airport\n\nWe‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs more impressive: the fact that they found a small airport north of Leeds to double as a New York City airport or that the flight operations continued alongside the production schedule. Teesside International Airport outside of Middlesbrough was the set piece for Ana‚Äôs NY airport scenes.\n\nCamila Mendes and Archie Renaux in Upgraded. Image Credit: Paul Stephenson/Amazon MGM Studios\n\nWhat to know about Upgraded\n\nUpgraded should not be confused with the movie Upgrade starring Logan Marshall-Green, also available to view on Amazon Prime. These are two very different date night movies‚Ä¶\n\nWhen was Upgraded (2024) released?\n\nUpgraded premiered on Amazon Prime on February 9, 2024, just in time for Valentine‚Äôs Day. This new London rom-com is a great popcorn pick whether you‚Äôve got a love of romantic comedies or if you‚Äôre just a fan of Camila Mendes.\n\nUpgraded cast: who stars in the movie?\n\nUpgraded stars Camila Mendes and Archie Renaux as the two characters who share a meet-cute. Marisa Tomei, Lena Olin, Anthony Head (Ted Lasso), and Thomas Kretschmann are featured in the supporting cast.\n\nWhat is the Upgraded movie plot?\n\nUpgraded finds overworked assistant Ana (played by Mendes) on a work trip to London. On the flight there, her seat is upgraded to first class where she meets the charming Will (played by Renaux). The two share a flirty flight in which Ana tells a little white lie; that she‚Äôs the director of an art auction house ‚Äî the very same art broker that Will‚Äôs mother has hired for this trip to London.\n\nDoes Ana tell Will the truth in Upgraded?\n\nYes, Ana tells Will the truth in Upgraded, but only after she‚Äôs caught in her lie. A photo of Ana and Will‚Äôs mother is posted online with Ana labeled as the director of Erwin‚Äôs. Caught, she spills the beans to Catherine, then to her son Will, who feels justifiably betrayed and used. Would Ana have confessed the truth to Will had she not been outed online? We‚Äôll never know.\n\nDo Ana and Will end up together in Upgraded?\n\nTry to act surprised: Ana and Will do end up together in Upgraded, as is the result of most meet-cutes in rom-coms. We‚Äôll give it to the writers, though; Ana went back to New York and found career success while Will initially turned down a job offer in the Empire State. Six months after they parted ways in London, Will shows up at the 11th hour during her gallery opening, telling her that he took the New York job, but did so to be with her.\n\nUpgraded ending explained\n\nUpgraded ends as many of your favorite romantic comedies do: the lead gets their lover. After Ana‚Äôs exposed as the assistant, and not director, of Erwin‚Äôs auction house, Catherine cancels the auction, which then causes Claire to fire Ana. Catherine and Ana have a heart-to-heart, with Ana taking responsibility for her actions, and Catherine decides to go forward with the auction only if Ana heads the auction (which will net her a big pay day). The auction is a success; Ana‚Äôs confession to Will... not so much. He planned to move to New York for a new job and to be with her, but calls it all off after hearing the truth. Ana returns to New York alone and we fast forward six months to her first art gallery opening. Just before it ends, Will shows up, tells Ana he‚Äôs here to be with her, and they share a kiss before the credits.\n\nUpgraded movie trailer\n\nWill Upgraded (2024) get a sequel?\n\nWith the on-screen chemistry between Mendes and Renaux, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the two paired again. No spoilers here: from a story standpoint, there‚Äôs definitely room to continue the tale should Amazon Prime want to.\n\nUpgraded and upgrades with Trainline\n\nLooking to experience Europe like a first-class art broker?
