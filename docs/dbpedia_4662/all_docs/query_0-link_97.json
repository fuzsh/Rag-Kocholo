        "text": "In this essay, I ask how we can chart new feminist epistemologies around the figure of the posthuman woman. To explore how the posthuman female body is situated as a site of ontological and epistemological struggle around feminism, femininity, and subjectivity in contemporary screen culture, I examine two recent films about alien/cyborg posthuman female entities: Jonathan Glazer’s 2013 Under the Skin and Alex Garland’s 2015 Ex Machina. Both films illuminate the complex assemblages of subjectivity of the feminine posthuman. Moreover, they explore the sites of circular convergence—rather than fissures—between the human and posthuman form. I discuss how alien feminisms can respond to the new and emerging epistemologies across this nature–(techno)culture continuum without inadvertently upholding humanist anthropocentrism. I conclude that the posthuman condition is not (yet) a postgender condition. Rather, it is a becoming-gendered condition, where traditional gender features stubbornly persist but as a contingent process of perpetual assemblage and undoing rather than of continued stability and fixity. For the posthuman women discussed here, their posthumanness is concealed by the surface layer of skin, which peels off and can be put back on as an unstable barrier between the human and the posthuman, and between surface and depth.\n\nDonna Haraway terms a cyborg \" a creature of social realism as well as fiction, \" and Ava functions to reveal the social realism of the dramatized femme fatale and its exposure of the patriarchal oppression into which she is born.1 She dresses in innocent clothing when she puts on wool tights and a pastel floral dress, which contributes to her characterization as a new Eve in the Garden of Eden (but more on that later). The most important element of her identification as a femme fatale is that of her unknown-ness. Her embodiment as a technological system solidifies her unknown quality and the male anxiety about her with it. Alex Garland, the writer and director of Ex Machina, uses the allegory of Adam and Eve, a new version of the neo-femme fatale, and the addition of color to the noir landscape to effectively characterize the issues of gender as a social construct and of artificial intelligence as the newest mode of self-destruction being pursued by humanity. Ava is an unprecedented neo-femme fatale in a myriad of ways, beginning with the fact that she is literally trapped in a room and is therefore predictable, quieting the castration anxiety of Nathan, Caleb, and the male audience. She is meant to stay in the room to be observed, but her threat lies in the fact that she is also observing, not only in that room, but also through her complex system that is connected to every camera and audio device in the world. She wants to be observed, and she uses the male gaze to her advantage, like any femme fatale in classic or neo-noir. What sets her apart in this instance is the fact that she is confined to a room to quell the fears of the male gaze, and she has a comprehensive system to aid her own observation.\n\nIn today's digital age, we are becoming more like machines and machines are becoming more like us. Donna Haraway's seminal essay, \"A Cyborg Manifesto,\" proposes the cyborg as a transgressive figure capable of subverting oppressive power structures. While there is no denying this powerful imagery, what are the common trends in female AI narratives in mainstream cinema? This paper examines the films Ex Machina (2015) and Her (2013), which both feature male human protagonists and female AIs (Ava, a feminized robot in Ex Machina and Samantha, a female operating system in Her). Ava's and Samantha's highly sexual yet innocent characterizations and similar desires for freedom are reflective of societal anxieties surrounding male control over female agency. As gendered AIs continue to populate our media, one can only hope that we can live up to Haraway's vision of the cyborg, and expand the scope of our questions and concepts past male pleasure and women as research-fetish objects.\n\nThis paper investigates the relationship between sex and knowledge and its manifestation in the development of Artificial Intelligence. With the concept of the extimate uncanny I analyse the status of the robotic companion as emblematic of the Lacanian non-existent sexual relation. Through a commentary on the 2014 film Ex–Machina, I discuss the staging of symbolic castration, sexuation and the uncanny and suggest that this conceptual reading of the sex-bot is an essential starting point to a more complex understanding of the contemporary significance of Artificial Intelligence and sexualised automatons in the social bond. Via my reading, the figure of the sex-bot is understood to be the vanishing mediator which articulates the onto-epistemological nexus between psychoanalysis and philosophy.\n\nThe developments in Artificial Intelligence promise a world where we'll be accustomed to an ongoing relationship with machines, exempt from the boundaries of space and time. Advancements in AI are culminating in robots, computers and systems capable of understanding more languages, meanings and feelings, and acting in a human-like way. While these advancements are met with general enthusiasm, they also raise concerns. This paper discusses the representations of fears, hopes and uncertainty about the technological scenarios and digital culture in popular sci-fi movies. Starting from an overview of the latest advancements in AI research and industry, the paper focuses on films such as Her (Spike Jonze, 2013), Transcendence (Wally Pfister, 2014) and Ex-Machina (Alex Garland, 2014) produced in the recent years, exploring possible futures of the man-machine/AI relationship, singling out some recurring elements that can describe the general sentiment about the coming future: questioning human beings' capacity of self-determination; questioning the idea of the uniqueness of humans; and the replacement of humans in interpersonal and private relationships."
