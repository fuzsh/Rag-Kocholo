        "text": "Category: Films\n\nHetain Patel Shorts\n\nHetain Patel Shorts at David Lean Cinema - September 2024\n\nA series of screenings curated by artist Hetain Patel to coincide with Come As You Really Are, a free exhibition commissioned by Artangel currently open to the public in Croydon. Each film (see further below) has been selected for its’ personal resonance to Patel and is paired with a short film of his own, which relates thematically to the feature film. For more information and to book a visit to the exhibition (located in the old Grants buiilding) visit artangel.org.uk\n\nHetain Patel is a London-based artist and filmmaker, whose work challenges reductive categorisations of identity and art. Often rooted in personal experience, and that of his immigrant family, Patel’s work invites us to see identity as multi-dimensional and complex, linked as much to what we choose to do, as to that which is assigned by birth, heritage, social norms, and conventions.\n\nPatel’s films, sculptures, live performances, paintings and photographs have been shown worldwide in galleries, theatres and on iconic public screens, including Piccadilly Circus, London, and Times Square, New York. His works have been presented at the Venice Biennale, Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art, Beijing and in London at institutions including Tate Modern and Sadler’s Wells.\n\nPatel’s works are in public and private collections in the UK and internationally, including Tate, British Council, Arts Council England, Government Art Collection, Manchester Art Gallery, M+ Museum Hong Kong, KNMA New Delhi, and Fondazione In Between Art Film, Rome.\n\nRegarding this series at The David Lean Cinema Hetain Patel says:\n\n“Each of the 3 feature films have been hugely influential to my identity and also how I make films. Behind the fantastical thrill of them are deeply relatable approaches to learning how to become yourself – from imitation and wearing disguises, to faking it until you make it, they show there isn’t just one way to try this, and that its ok to get it wrong along the way”.\n\nCROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON\n\n2000 | Dir Ang Lee | 120m | Taiwan | Hong Kong\n\nSaturday 07 September 2024 at 2.00pm\n\nAn Artangel presentation preceded by Hetain Patel’s short film DON’T LOOK AT THE FINGER – 2017 (Council Cert PG), – 16m\n\nAng Lee’s classic wuxia tale is the story of a legendary sword, the Green Destiny, which is stolen by an audacious thief, and the quest to return it to its rightful owner.\n\nPlay Video\n\nWinner of 4 Oscars, Ang Lee’s classic wuxia tale tells the story of legendary swordsman Li Mu Bai, his partner Lu Shu Lien and the Green Destiny sword, which is stolen by an audacious thief.

Battling entrenched tradition, and ripping down the fences, they allowed intensively-farmed land to return gradually to its natural condition, entrusting its recovery to a motley mix of animals both tame and wild. It began a grand experiment that has become one of the most significant rewilding experiments in Europe.

While initially successful, a policeman who was involved in shooting one of the women’s brothers is on their trail. As the women add to the loot, their tastes and interests begin to change and their suspicions of each other increase on the way to a climactic robbery.\n\n“Set It Off is a lot more than a thriller about four women who rob banks. It compares with WAITING TO EXHALE, but with a strong jolt of reality. It creates a portrait of the lives of these women that’s so observant and informed.” The movie surprised and moved me; I expected a routine action picture and was amazed how much I started to care about the characters.
