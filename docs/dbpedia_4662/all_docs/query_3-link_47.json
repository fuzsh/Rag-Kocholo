        "text": "In the wake of the festive period, these are eight exciting productions taking place around the UK and Ireland to look forward to.\n\n2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for film and television. With blockbusters like Dune: Part Two and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire getting ready to fill cinemas and Masters of the Air and the second season of House of the Dragon gracing our TV screens, it’s sure to be a fantastic year for all things entertainment.\n\nHere’s a look at a few of the brand-new shows and films taking place in studios and on location up and down the country and across the Irish Sea:\n\n‘How To Train Your Dragon’\n\nSpotlight member Lucy Bevan is casting the live-action remake of the popular animated film series, which is currently in production at Titanic Studios in Belfast. Recently confirming the return of Gerard Butler to the role of ‘Stoick’ – the same character he voiced in the 2010 Dreamworks film – this brand new adaptation of the Viking and dragon-filled adventure is sure to be a favourite for the whole family. How to Train Your Dragon is being directed by Dean DeBois – who wrote the original trilogy – for Universal Pictures.\n\n‘The Diplomat’\n\nKerri Russell stars in the Emmy-nominated Netflix series that follows the life of ‘Kate Wyler’, as she starts a high-profile job during an international crisis. The Diplomat is returning for its second season and is currently filming in and around London. Russell is joined by Spotlight members Rufus Sewell and Rory Kinnear, and if season one is anything to go by, season two will be an exciting ride as we watch thrilling events unfold. Spotlight members Lucinda Syson, Natasha Vincent and Julie Schubert provided the casting for The Diplomat.\n\n‘Black Doves’\n\nKeira Knightley and Spotlight members Ben Whishaw and Sarah Lancashire lead the cast of this thrilling new series for Netflix, directed by Joe Barton. Black Doves tells the story of ‘Helen’ (Knightley) as she embarks on a passionate affair – while keeping her real identity a secret from her lover. Directed by Joe Barton and cast by Spotlight member Robert Sterne, Black Doves is currently filming in various locations around the UK until March 2024.\n\n‘Tornado’\n\nIn this exciting new survival thriller, Academy Award-nominee and Spotlight member Tim Roth is joined by Takehiro Hira and Spotlight member Jack Lowden. Set in 1790s Britain, Tornado tells the story of a Japanese girl and her father’s travelling puppet show, who soon find themselves entangled with a dangerous underground gang. Produced for Lionsgate and directed by BAFTA-winner John Maclean, Tornado is currently filming in various locations around Scotland throughout January and February. Casting was carried out by Spotlight member Colin Jones.\n\n‘Department Q’\n\nAlthough plot details are being kept under wraps for this new Netflix series, we know that Spotlight member Paul Candelent is leading the cast as an unnamed detective who becomes consumed by a case involving a devastation to his police force. Department Q is currently filming in Edinburgh and various other Scotland locations throughout the next couple of months.\n\n‘Outlander: Blood of my Blood’\n\nAfter eight successful seasons, Outlander will have its season finale later this year – but don’t fear: the popular Scottish period drama is getting a 10-episode prequel series. Outlander: Blood of my Blood is expected to be set 20 years before the first season of the original series – and may feature some familiar faces. No release date has been announced yet, but filming will take place around Glasgow and other locations in Scotland over the next couple of months.\n\n‘Too Much’\n\nMegan Stalter and Spotlight member Will Sharpe star in this upcoming romantic comedy mini-series for Netflix, written and directed by Lena Dunham. Currently filming in and around London, Too Much follows a woman who moves to London from New York City in an attempt to get over a break-up. Famous model and actress Emily Ratajkowski is also in talks to play the ex-girlfriend of Sharpe’s character ‘Felix’.\n\n‘Heavyweight’\n\nChristopher Anthony’s directorial debut, Heavyweight stars Spotlight members Jason Isaacs, Jamie Bamber, Nicholas Pinnock and Sienna Guillory and tells the story of an underdog boxer and his coach preparing for a championship match – while battling with the pressures of life.\n\nCast by Spotlight members Julie Harkin and Nathan Toth, Heavyweight is currently filming in London for Blackwater Pictures.\n\nOther productions that are coming to the end of their shooting dates and are scheduled to be released later in 2024 are:\n\nAndor (Season 2): the highly anticipated sequel to the Star Wars spin-off series.\n\nWicked: Part 1: the on-screen adaptation of the Broadway musical.\n\nAmateur: an action thriller starring Rami Malek.\n\nHedda: an adaptation of the classic play, Hedda Gabler."
