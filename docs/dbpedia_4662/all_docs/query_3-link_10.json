        "text": "This has baffled me as to what film producers do to film a movie or an episode based on an entire city.\n\nExamples of this is as seen in the movie Day after tommorrow where a tsunami hits the city itself, and the city is caught on camera from above being submerged.\n\nIn White House Down, this is another prime example because the White house itself is in the city of Washington DC. How did they manage to film something like this in a settlement that looks just like the city itself?\n\nIn Charmed(series), this is another one because demons roam the streets and the surroundings is a city. The film producers use proportion of the city. I do believe the opening scene of the large proportion of the city was just shot in either a plane or a helicopter that flew around the place.\n\nDivergent (and the other movies in the same story) is also filmed in the *Chicago City Experiment (basically the city of Chicago) and the people inside it.\n\nHow do film producers film movies based on entire or a proportion of towns and cities?\n\nIn addition to HorusKol's excellent answer, I want to point out that the wide shots showing the entire city do not make up the entire movie. Just a few \"establishing shots\" of the whole city at the start of the film, or at the start of various scenes, gives the audience a sense that that is where the following action is taking place. Then, the film can cut to shots of actors in front of generic locations that look like cities - whether they are actual cities, the back lot of a movie studio, or even an indoor set on a sound stage that is built to look like it's outdoors.\n\nSo, to use an example from the OP's question, The Day After Tomorrow showed a lot of establishing shots of New York City ... and then moved the actors into the public library. I can almost guarantee that what looked like the interior of the public library was actually a set. But the audience watching the film sees them running through New York City to avoid the wall over water coming towards them, and sees the actors run into the public library, so they believe that the actors are now in a building in New York City. Even though it's a set they built in Hollywood.\n\nanswered Sep 22, 2017 at 18:49\n\nBrettFromLABrettFromLA\n\n23.7k2020 gold badges8585 silver badges151151 bronze badges"
