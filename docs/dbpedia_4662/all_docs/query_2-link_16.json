        "text": "The following post is a cinematographic analysis I completed as a final project for my Digital Cinematography course at UCLA.\n\nEx Machina is an underrated cinematic masterpiece released by the joint efforts of director Alex Garland and the indie trailblazers of A24, which tells the story of Caleb, an engineer who wins a contest to visit the home of his firm’s successful CEO, Nathan. However, Caleb later learns that he is the subject of an experiment by his boss in which he must interact with a cunning AI robot, Ava, with whom he begins to fall in love. Not long after, both men learn the unexpected intelligence and deception of Ava herself.\n\nThis film’s admirable cinematography was executed by British cinematographer Rob Hardy, BSC. Hardy’s cinematography style has recently focused primarily on action or science fiction films, with his abundant portfolio detailing films like Annihilation, Mission Impossible: Fallout, and the upcoming Marvel movie Black Widow. He tends to focus his camerawork in a dramatizing manner to emphasize the emotions of the film, as seen in his work on Euphoria, as well.\n\nEx Machina is composed of mainly stationary shots with shallower depths of field to represent the distance between the audience and the characters–there is a story to be told, a story we will only learn from the cryptic messages of the somewhat untrustworthy characters onscreen.\n\nHardy noted how some members of the crew were extremely averse to using film stock for the movie so they skipped that option entirely and moved on to testing different lenses and cameras. According to Hardy, the crew “shot in a film-style test environment, with different textures, surfaces, colour temperatures, light sources and contrasting exposures, and screened it at all” and the choice for an F65 became apparent. However, in some handheld shots, the camera was switched out for an F55 in order to accommodate certain VFX needs as the supervisor was onsite during the entirety of the shoot. The DP’s crew consisted of ten people who overlooked every single detail on the film, from CCTV coverage to GoPro shots of the Norwegian landscape to creating LUTs even in the pre-production stages, which took four weeks to complete.\n\nThere are many scenes in which shots are framed from the perspective of a security camera rolling in the house; in the beginning, this is intentional. We see certain things through the perspective of either Nathan or Caleb’s screens. However, as the film progresses and the AI grows stronger–more intelligent–the CCTV frames become more prevalent, and not necessarily through the perspective of a human. As Ava increasingly becomes her own being, the rest of the technology becomes the eyes–in this case, the security cameras. These stationary, high canted angles were evidently manipulated by different filtering and color to create a hazier and less resolute feel, and this was done with a purpose.\n\nAn abundance of the scenes is filmed through glass, meaning the camera itself is placed behind a glass screen, creating distance between the audience and the characters. In a Bladerunner choice of style, this perspective creates an eerie unknown of whether or not Caleb is actually human or if he, too, is an AI. (In fact, he goes through this hallucinogenic paranoia with himself as well.) The camera movement contributed greatly to this feeling, as Hardy himself noted that “during the Ava Sessions [he] purposefully positioned and moved the camera to make the audience question who’s trapped and vulnerable? Is it Caleb or Ava?” He noted the subtle lean-ins and forward motions of the camera which almost elicited a subconscious feeling of claustrophobia that was not outwardly evident to the viewer, but still felt overall.\n\nHardy chose to use a set of Cooke Xtal Express anamorphic lenses for this film, meaning the shots were softer and rounder as compared to more precise lenses. A direct quote from Hardy himself, “Choosing a pair of lenses is like choosing a new best friend for the next few weeks,” and this best friend certainly did not disappoint. Cooke Xtal lenses are hand-built, so no two lenses will be equal to one another. To Hardy, this imperfection was a win. Therefore, after much deliberation, Hardy and his crew decided to stick to a 32mm lens set with a less precise look, that of which would flaw the keen story of Ex Machina.\n\nWhile detailing his conversation with VFX supervisor Andrew Whitehurst, Hardy recalls to Filmmaker Magazine how the special effects team was extremely keen on choosing more faulty lenses for the film rather than extremely precise and new lenses to tell this story. The realism in sci-fi is unimaginable, and it contributes greatly to the narrative of the film. However, the older anamorphic lenses detailed the scenes with Ava in a personable way, allowing the audience to feel sympathetic as if they were in the room with every character while the story progressed. In addition, the anamorphic lens allowed for a more claustrophobic feeling as if we were trapped in a labyrinth of a mansion that was large and never-ending but suffocated us with every new menacing detail we learned about Nathan’s research.\n\nBecause the camera movement was extremely fluid in this film, Hardy explained how the crew decided to use embedded practicals as their main lighting strategy to accommodate the camera’s 360º movements around the room. In his interview with Filmmaker Magazine, Hardy reveals that the set was lit with many smaller Tungsten bulbs as opposed to longer and larger Kino light tubes. From a practical standpoint, Kino lights would have been more efficient in lighting the set–less lights, less work, less crew. However, Hardy explained his reasoning for choosing this lighting style by describing the incorporation of an abundance of smaller lights as “[emanating] from the frame rather than being placed there… It elicits much more emotion. It doesn’t draw attention to itself the way a source-y light does.” In essence, Hardy is correct; sprinkling many smaller lights around a room creates a softer image rather than shining one hard, large light across the scene. For a film like Ex Machina, this natural look contrasts the futuristic home; this image is vital.\n\nIn a different interview with British Cinematographer, Hardy further commented that he wanted to convey the message “that Ava is effectively trapped, a slave.” The reflective light panels shown in the glass masked the appearance of the camera reflection and were strategically placed by the gaffer in order to maintain that reflective and bright look consistent in every shot.\n\nA visual inspiration drawn from director Alex Garland and passed onto Hardy was the photographic details from Saul Leiter. As shown in the samples given, Leiter’s photography was particularly niche in a sense where his style was based heavily on softer glows that either occurred naturally through weather or were manipulated by props and location. Most importantly, many of Leiter’s more recent works were focused on a lens through glass–windows, signs, anything that was glass. Ex Machina was shot almost entirely through glass in the scenes between Ava and Caleb–it is not until Ava escapes that Caleb comes face to face with her, literally. To summarize Hardy’s comments, he claims that although Ex Machina relies heavily on the science fiction realm to drive the story, the crew did not want to lose a classic look in the film.\n\nEx Machina reigns as one of my favorite movies of all time. In all honesty, I am not the biggest fan of sci-fi, but this film delve into a part of my mind that allowed me to explore the story beyond the scope of its outward skin. In laymen’s terms, the film was about the threat of AI to man, but after a deeper analysis, the story actually implies the death of god and humanity as a whole. One of my favorite parts about this film other than its intricate storyline was the visual elements that contributed to its progression–the anamorphic lens, dimmer lights, hazy coloring, and use of impractical tools such as glass screens and CCTV monitoring all elicited the exact feelings the director and cinematographer intended. The love story between Caleb and Ava was enviable–so real and raw, almost as if it were between two loving human beings. Overall, I have grown an even larger appreciation for the film after reading about all its technicalities, especially considering the fact that I felt every emotion for which the crew intended."
