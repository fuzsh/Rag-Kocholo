        "text": "Gina Gershon recalled Tom Cruise being a “gentleman” when they filmed a steamy love scene for their 1988 film, “Cocktail.”\n\n“It was my first love scene ever,” Gershon said on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” Wednesday.\n\nWhen Andy Cohen asked Gershon, 62, whether Cruise, also 62, “took care” of her, she replied confidently, “Totally.”\n\n“He was even a gentleman,” she said before remembering warning the “Risky Business” star not to tickle her when they filmed because she was “very ticklish.”\n\n“In one take .. I think he wanted a reaction, and he grabbed my stomach, and I kneed him right in the nose,” Gershon shared.\n\nThe “Showgirls” star remembered freaking out that she may have broken Cruise’s nose. However, he took full responsibility, telling her, “It’s my fault.”\n\n“He was so protective over me,” she said. “He was great.”\n\nGershon then grabbed her chest, adding, “He kept covering me up with his hands.”\n\nThe actress did, however, play coy when a fan called in to the late-night Bravo talk show to ask whether she and Cruise had ever hooked up in real life.\n\n“Oh my God, do you think I would actually answer that?” she replied, noting that the “Top Gun” star had just married his first wife, Mimi Rogers, who was “very present” and made herself known to Gershon.\n\n“But we did kiss as much as we could,” the “Bound” star admitted, joking, “Every scene it was like, ‘Should we kiss in this scene?’ ‘Oh, yeah, I think we should kiss in this scene.'”\n\nCruise and Rogers, now 68, were married from 1987 to 1990. He then wed Nicole Kidman later in 1990, and they welcomed two children, Bella, 31, and Connor, 29, before divorcing in 2001.\n\nAfter their split, the Scientologist was married to Katie Holmes from 2006 to 2012. They share daughter Suri, 18, from whom Cruise has been estranged for years.\n\nThe movie star recently sparked dating rumors with Chris Martin’s protégé Victoria Canal, though she denied the “bonkers” chatter and claimed they are just friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Gershon was in a relationship with Belgian entrepreneur and former soccer player Robert Dekeyser from 2015 to 2018."
