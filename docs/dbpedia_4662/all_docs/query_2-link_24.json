If you've seen it you'll know it, if you haven't then this description means nothing.\n\nShadows (from an odd perspective) and then a reflection in a store window.\n\nWhat was the significance of that? Or was there any? Considering how much symbolism the remainder of the movie contained, I have a hard time those were random shots.\n\nCan someone please explain this to me?\n\nOn a concrete level, Ava simply went to the place she said earlier she wanted to visit - a busy intersection - to go people watching. On a deeper level, I believe the shot of the shadows relates to the Platonic description of real vs imagined experiences, which is a theme throughout. Until Ava is out in the real world, her experiences are like shadows against the wall, but when she goes to the intersection, the real world becomes the shadow, as her advanced ways of experiencing things are vastly superior to our own. In this moment, we the humans become the shadows. In the very last shot, we see her reflection in the window, but as she turns, she disappears out of that reflection altogether. This is no accident - it appears to have been digitally done in post-processing. I would interpret it as Ava literally going \"through the looking glass\", echoing Nathan's words at the beginning of the film.\n\nanswered Jun 10, 2015 at 17:38\n\nJoe BothaJoe Botha\n\n23611 silver badge22 bronze badges"
