        "text": "One of the year's best films, the sci-fi thriller Ex Machina, expands into wide release Friday, after a limited run in less than 40 domestic theaters during which it took impressive per-screen hauls and racked up $8 million worldwide heading into the weekend. Early Friday box office figures show the film more than doubled its North American take to nearly $3 million from more than 1,500 screens, pushing its global numbers toward $10 million (not counting the most recent foreign receipts). The film appears headed for a healthy weekend total of more than $4 million and a worldwide total near $15 million when overseas numbers roll in.\n\nCritical reception has remained strong, with Ex Machina earning widespread acclaim and being one of the best-reviewed films of 2015 so far. Likewise, audiences word of mouth is strong, and should help the film build viewership and garner increased attention moving forward. With a budget of just $16 million, it won't take much to help the film into profitable territory. Which it surely deserves, as it's a thoughtful, intelligent, gripping science fiction story with more heart than most other films currently in theaters.\n\nEx Machina is directed by Alex Garland, a novelist and screenwriter perhaps best known for penning the zombie horror film 28 Days Later, the sci-fi thriller Sunshine, and the adapted sci-fi drama Never Let Me Go. He also scripted the marvelously entertaining comic book sci-fi film Dredd, which was one of 2012's most underrated films so you should definitely check it out.\n\nI had a chance to sit down with Garland to discuss his film, and it was a fascinating conversation...\n\nYour films typically deal with themes of isolation and loneliness, of disconnect from the outside world, and of how humans are driven to transcend our internal isolation through connection to other people to validate our own humanity and emotions and sense of self.\n\nAG: All of that, absolutely, and also I think people who have been cut free of the sort of modifying factors of other people and of going on a spiral, in some respects.\n\nAnd I also felt there was a subtext to it regarding gender, and gender privilege and exploitation. But there've been complaints here or there, whereas I think a lot of the complaints missed what the subtext was saying. Is that me just reading into it? Or is there an intentional themes about the danger of it extending to technology and will that extend into our creating new life in A.I.?\n\nAG: Those things are completely intentional and they're absolutely in there. My basic principle is, if you're going to put that stuff in a movie — in what is basically an ideas film — then the responsibility is to be thoughtful about it. And I'm aware that some of the things are contentious, and I'm aware that it can be read in different ways.\n\nI have to say it doesn't really bother me, though. Well, it bothers me a bit, sometimes -- if I get accused of misogyny. I don't want to be accused of being misogynistic, I don't want to be accused of being racist, and I don't want to be accused of being things I don't feel I am. And there is a thesis within the film that I would say is reasonable.\n\nBut I also know that when you put a story out there, it has room for interpretation. Supreme Court judges spend a lot of time figuring out the meaning of short sentences that were written in order to be clear. And within a narrative — forget about a statement of law — within a narrative, the level of ambiguity that blows up is exponential. You're using language that isn't as clear as legal language. You're using ideas and themes, and being provocative and ambiguous — and ambivalent sometimes, because you might hold two conflicting positions at basically the same time. So of course people are going to take it in different ways.\n\nWhat I have to do is satisfy myself that I have been reasonable according to my own terms, to the best of my ability. And I did do that with this film. I haven't always done it that with films previously, it's a learning process, but I did do it with this film. And after writing the script, I then showed it to people… friends of mine or people who'd written books I thought were interesting, who I thought would give me an insight or I thought they would have an insight into this. I sent it to them — some of them were interested in or working on A.I., and some of them the philosophy of mind, and some of them gender politics — and said, \"I want you to read this from the perspective that you have about this issue.\"\n\nA lot of times I feel like some of the comments and interpretations at least recognize those things exist, even if they're coming at it from a different direction than you intended. But it's interesting that they're interpreting it as having these gender issues and that it’s a problem, but they aren't interpreting it as the film intentionally presenting them as a problem within the story.\n\nAG: I know. It's slightly odd, that, for me. Because it sort of says that if you made a film that contained a National Socialist then you would be a Nazi. But it might be saying National Socialism is pretty uncool.\n\nThe 1993 film Stalingrad is about the experience of German troops when the Russian winter hits, and they're trudging through the ice and snow. And there were some complaints about that film from some people, that it humanized the Nazis.\n\nAG: I've never heard that, but of all the complaints you could level, that would be one of the stupidest complaints. Because if there's anything really important to understand about Nazis, it's that they're human, because if you make them not human then it means you don't have to guard against it. The whole point is that it's normal people who do this s**t — not these weird monsters that come out of the void, but us.\n\nIt's more comfortable for people to think, \"They're monsters, they're something I could never be.\" It makes them feel more comfortable, and then they don't see it in themselves and don't recognize it happening around them.\n\nAG: Well, quite. But you would really have to be fantastically stupid to level the accusation. I mean, I do think this thing about interpretation and subjectivity is kind of— Yeah, you just have to allow for it, but sometimes it's just plain stupid.\n\nYour film achieves some marvelous special effects, but none of the scenes rely on the effects. You were able to use it as an extra layer instead of having effects define a scene or having anyone talk to a green screen.\n\nAG: I think there's a particular reason for that, personally. The way the effects were set up — and this was organized by the VFX team run by Andrew Whitehurst — was that there was no green screen, and there were no tracking markers. What they said was, \"The only way you're going to be able to do this is to be able to shoot really, really fast [because we had six weeks to shoot]. Don't think about the VFX, just shoot the drama.\" So when we were shooting, we were never really thinking about exploiting the beautiful mechanics that Ava can put on display. It was about responding to Alicia's performance.\n\nSo the process simple is, in come the actors, me and the actors rehearse the scene and block the scene, bring in the crew to all watch the scene together, and we can respond from a filmmaking point of view to what Alicia Vikander is doing. Do we want to be tight on her face when she's doing this, or does this want to be a mid? Do we want to sit in a wide through this whole thing? And we can make decisions like that, and be governed by the actors and not the visual effects.\n\nThis is your first time directing a feature film, but it demonstrates such a confidence and a professionally mature hand so to speak.\n\nAG: But I've been working in film for about 15 years. And I've cut several movies, and I've been on the set every day, so it's not like I'm just out of high school.\n\nExactly. But I kept falling into that thinking — and meaning it in a complimentary way — that this does not feel like somebody's first film, this feels like a tenth film that someone has directed, like every decision was right.\n\nAG: Well thank you, because I get that that's very complimentary. I think, though, that is because we see the filmmaker as the director, and actually in my experience that's not how it works. There's a group of filmmakers on given film, and they really do include — this isn't just lip service — the production designer is incredibly important, the producer, the actors, the sound designers, and so it goes on.\n\nThe way I see it, and I know other people wouldn't necessarily agree with this, it's not my first film. I feel like I was one of the filmmakers on 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Never Let Me Go, Dredd, and Ex Machina. It's not like this suddenly became mine and I took possession of it. I was a participant previously and I'm a participant now.\n\nYou subvert a lot of expectations in this story. Modern film is so obsessed with plot twists, and there's a great moment where Caleb panics about his own sense of personal humanity. It's not an \"ah ha!\" moment twist, it’s just a natural psychological extension of the story you're telling, and the themes about humanity. It's just a moment that happens, and it's wonderful.\n\nAG: I think it's because, in some respect, Caleb plays a surrogate audience member often in the film. So the thing that he's worrying about is what the audience will be wondering. It seemed to me highly likely that audiences would be working under an expectation almost that Caleb would be a machine.\n\nBut even forgetting that, just within the constructs of the story, at a certain point I think if you were a young person in that environment you’d have to start questioning yourself. Are these memories mine or are they implanted? Just what is at stake here and what is being played out?\n\nWhich ties into themes of Blade Runner, which is one of the things I loved. The whole concept of self-identification and doubting your own memory.\n\nAG: I assume that anyone watching this film has seen Blade Runner. I really think like 99% of people who watch this film will have seen Blade Runner, and would be familiar with that and Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThanks to Alex Garland for taking time to speak with me about his film Ex Machina!\n\nRead my detailed analysis of the brilliant ending of Ex Machina, and of the film's issues of gender and privilege discussed in this article, in my post here at Quora.\n\nAll box office figures and tallies based on data via Box Office Mojo and TheNumbers."
