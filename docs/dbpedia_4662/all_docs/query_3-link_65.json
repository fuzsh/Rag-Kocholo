Well the chances are you probably have!\n\nRSA House is a renowned London filming venue and when it comes to location filming, we are best known for having an exterior similar in date and style to the iconic 10 Downing Street door. We’ve seen some major film and TV sets outside our front doors and there’s nothing more exciting than watching the scenes back when they’ve had their big debut.\n\nSituated in the heart of Westminster and within a five-minute walk to Embankment and Charing Cross stations you can find our striking Georgian townhouse; rich in history and contemporary in style. But the door is just the starting point; inside RSA House you’ll find eleven event spaces spanning four floors. What lies beneath is the industrial and atmospheric subterranean Vaults, boasting exposed brick throughout, perfect for the likes of music video shoots, filming interviews and nightclub scenes.\n\nThe original Georgian features of the building make it an ideal venue for filming period dramas. Our event spaces can be booked on an exclusive hire basis for London location filming, or room by room.
