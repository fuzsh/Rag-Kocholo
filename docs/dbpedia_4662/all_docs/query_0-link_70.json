Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘5 to 7’ (R, 1:37) Boy meets woman in this New York romance set at the intersection of nostalgia and wishful thinking. The mismatched stars Anton Yelchin and Bérénice Marlohe don’t make any sense as a couple, but that doesn’t stop the writer and director Victor Levin from throwing them together. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n★ ‘About Elly’ (No rating, 1:59, in Persian) The Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi’s powerful drama, made before “A Separation,” suggests a contemporary update of Michelangelo Antonioni’s “L’Avventura,” with its story of a young woman who disappears during a festive weekend outing at a coastal resort on the Caspian Sea. The movie is a subtle critique of a society in which the disparity between tradition and modernity is irreconcilable. (Stephen Holden)\n\n‘American Sniper’ (R, 2:14) In this film, based on the memoir by Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL sniper who served four tours of duty in Iraq, Clint Eastwood’s direction is as blunt and effective as ever, and Bradley Cooper’s performance as Kyle is a remarkable feat of transformation. But as a movie about recent history, the film is troublingly blurry, and heavy with unacknowledged political bias. (A.O. Scott)\n\n★ ‘Black Souls’ (No rating, 1:48, in Italian) This ominous, well-acted portrait of an ingrown feudal society of mobsters in extreme southern Italy is the antithesis of a sensationalist splatter movie. There is not an operatic flourish to be seen in a film whose killings are executed with a coldblooded efficiency. This isn’t entertainment; it’s life and death. (Holden)\n\n‘Broken Horses’ (R, 1:41) A violinist, Jakey (Anton Yelchin), returns home to visit his simple-minded friend Buddy (Christopher Marquette) in a violent border town in this wonkily plotted story of corrupted innocence. The Indian director Vidhu Vinod Chopra embraces visual bombast — white horses, C.G.I. flames — in this deeply silly drama. (Nicolas Rapold)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
