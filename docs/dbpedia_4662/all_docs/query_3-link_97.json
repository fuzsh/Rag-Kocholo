Honestly one of the smoothest shoots I’ve ever done. I can’t recommend the National Theatre enough!\n\nASOS\n\nI cannot recommend the NT team enough, throughout pre-production the communication was precise and prompt and on set they could not have been more helpful to ensure the day ran smoothly. To be able to capture such an iconic location elevated our story and I look forward to shooting with the team again in the future.\n\nYOU Magazine\n\nThe National Theatre team was efficient and responsive to deal with, they did exactly what they said they would do, and the location worked well for us.\n\nSky Arts, Portrait Artist of the Year 2022"
