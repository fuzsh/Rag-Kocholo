        "text": "Introduction\n\nA standard practice in commercial, narrative filmmaking is the use of establishing shots. An establishing shot is a long1, wide shot that prefaces a scene and depicts the location in which the scene will take place. A scene “takes place in one location over a continuous but relatively small amount of time” (Cutting et al., 2012, p. 3); thus, a change in scene is generally linked to a change in location. Pincus and Ascher (2012) succinctly describe an establishing shot as “a long shot that defines the basic space or locale where events will take place” (p. 323).\n\nThe present study makes use of three different types of establishing shots. The first is an establishing shot where actors are depicted in a long shot within the space in which they will be acting during the scene. This type of establishing shot, in theory, helps the viewer become accustomed to the fact that they are now occupying a new environment and displays how the characters are positioned at the beginning of the scene. An establishing shot might instead depict the exterior of the building or vehicle where the scene will take place. This could be the front façade of an office building or the outside of a boat or spaceship. In such a shot, the actors often are not depicted, as the following shot usually cuts to an interior space where the action takes place, a space presumably inside the building or vehicle shown in the previous shot. This is an instance that usually does not provide the arrangement of characters, but should, however, cue the viewer to the fact that the location of the narrative has changed. The final type of establishing shot is a long shot of the larger geographic context in which the scene will take place. This type of shot is usually a landscape or cityscape, but it might also take the form of a shot of a planet’s surface. Again, actors are often not depicted in this type of establishing shot.\n\nOne thing that all the forms of establishing shot have in common is that they are meant to indicate to the viewer that the location of the action has changed in the film’s ongoing narrative. Cutting and Iricinschi (2015) note that the establishing shot helps a viewer become acclimated to a new location. This “functional” aspect of an establishing shot’s definition makes intuitive sense. One would expect that a long shot of the surroundings before the action of the scene begins in earnest would help the viewer adjust to a shift in location, as it would, in theory, give the viewer a moment to process this shift before focusing on the extension of the narrative delivered in the subsequent scene. Indeed, it is likely that this intuition has helped ensconce the establishing shot as standard filmmaking practice. However, the establishing shot has been argued to be superfluous when it comes to the task of guiding the viewer through a narrative (Bordwell, 2002; Ballester, 2005).\n\nCutting et al. (2012) found that new units of action tend to be prefaced with wider shots that take in more of the surroundings before moving to closer shots as action unfolds. This study also found that these initial shots were relatively longer in duration than the following shots that made up the scene. The pattern of beginning a scene with a relatively longer shot that is also relatively longer in duration compared to the rest of the shots in the scene was interpreted to be indicative of the usage of establishing shots. In addition, of the various formal aspects of film (features other than place, time, characters, and other narrative content), initial shot scales and initial shot durations were among the variables most consistently linked with the perception of a new event beginning. The research of Cutting et al. suggests that the establishing shot could play an important role in helping the viewer determine that a new event is occurring in the film. However, it is important to note that this research analyzed “subscenes,” which are meant to represent meaningfully distinct events in a narrative (Cutting et al., 2012, p. 3). These can include entrances and exits of characters or shifts of tone. Therefore, the shifts analyzed do not necessarily refer to changes in scene (i.e., changes in location), although such shifts are included in this analysis. So, while Cutting et al.’s results do not specifically represent shifts in locations, they may provide some insight into the importance of the establishing shot for cuing shifts in the narrative, including locational shifts. Indeed, it has been theorized that the establishing shot is kept at a longer duration to give the viewer a chance to take in the novel information being presented, which often takes the form of a shift to a brand new location (Cutting et al., 2012; Cutting and Candan, 2013; Cutting, 2014).\n\nPast studies have found that reading time slows at the beginning and ending of scenes in written stories (Zwaan et al., 1995a,b). These results can be explained by an increased consumption of cognitive resources caused by the transition between scenes (Cutting et al., 2012). Indeed, Zwaan et al. (1995b) have found that general discontinuities in temporal, spatial, and causal elements of a written story lead to increases in reading time, a result that has been interpreted as being reflective of increased difficulty in incorporating new information into preexisting conceptions of the story. It has been postulated that shifts in scenes require heightened executive functioning and place a heavier cognitive load on comprehension (Cutting and Iricinschi, 2015). If narrative shifts such as changes in location in written stories increase processing difficulty, it is possible that such narrative shifts increase processing difficulty in filmic stories as well. Given the seeming influence of the establishing shot on the cognitive distinction between events in films, it is also possible that establishing shots may help reduce the difficulty with which changes in events are processed.\n\nOne measure of how difficult it is for a person to process information is known as cognitive load, a term used to refer to the amount of effort required to process information (Cooper, 1990; Zagermann et al., 2016). The current study used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure cognitive load via hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex, specifically Brodmann Area 10. Brodmann Area 10 is defined as the medial prefrontal cortex and has been shown to become increasingly activated with increasing cognitive load (Arsalidou et al., 2013).\n\nFunctional near infrared spectroscopy has been utilized in a variety of clinical and research settings, and has been validated against other neuroimaging techniques such as PET (León-Carrión and León-Domínguez, 2012). Ayaz et al. (2012) was one of the first studies that established fNIRS as a monitor of cognitive workload. Herff et al. (2014) utilized fNIRS to quantify mental workload activity in the prefrontal cortex during a series of n-back tasks. The fNIRS data showed an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex as the n-back task increased in difficulty. Workload was evaluated by comparing each n-back trial to one another and to relaxation periods. It was concluded that measuring hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex using fNIRS provides a reliable quantification of mental workload, supporting the findings of Ayaz et al. (2012). Izzetoglu et al. (2004) also found that blood flow in the prefrontal cortex, as measured by fNIRS, correlated with increases in cognitive load. Participants engaged in a naval warfare management simulator task. Blood flow changes as measured by fNIRS were found to be significantly correlated with task difficulty.\n\nIn order to be activated, neurons require substances such as oxygen and glucose. Such materials are sent to neurons via blood transfusion through the capillaries. The metabolic needs of neurons during activation results in increased oxygen consumption, local cerebral blood flow, and oxygen delivery (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2010). An increase in blood flow and total hemoglobin to certain regions of the cerebrum is considered to be indicative of increased metabolic demands of the neurons in that region, and therefore, increased activation of those neurons in response to cognitive tasks (Izzetoglu et al., 2004). When hemoglobin is transporting oxygen in the blood, it is referred to as oxygenated hemoglobin; once it releases oxygen to be metabolized, it is referred to as deoxygenated hemoglobin.\n\nFunctional near infrared spectroscopy uses infrared light to measure the amount of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in areas of the cerebral cortex; in this study we measured activity specifically in the anterior portion of the cerebral cortex. Biological tissue becomes translucent to light under a specific spectrum of 700–900 nm wavelengths, or the near-infrared portion of the light spectrum (León-Carrión and León-Domínguez, 2012). Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin exhibit different absorption properties when exposed to near-infrared (NIR) light, thus allowing levels of these forms of hemoglobin to be differentiated from one another based on the way NIR light is scattered when it is reflected back from the brain (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2010). A typical hemodynamic response to the activation of cortical neurons in an adult brain takes the form of an increased flow of oxygenated hemoglobin and a relatively smaller decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin, resulting in an increase in total hemoglobin (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2010). Through measurements of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, oxygenation levels in the brain can be deduced. fNIRS has a number of advantages; it is a low-cost system that is quiet, non-invasive, portable, and has relatively good temporal resolution (Ferreri et al., 2014).\n\nTo date, there are no known studies investigating the hemodynamic response of adults to film editing techniques using fNIRS. Using EEG, Francuz and Zabielska-Mendyk (2013) found that cuts between unrelated scenes caused higher attention, arousal, and cognitive load than cuts between shots depicting the same scene but from different angles. They note that such heightened mental involvement is often correlated with increased activity in the frontal lobes, particularly the prefrontal cortex. This study did not use unrelated scenes from the same video, however; the clips stitched together were different enough in terms of form and content that the changes between scenes resembled changing channels on a television. Using fMRI imaging and the children’s film The Red Balloon, film viewers’ responses to various types of edits have been analyzed (Magliano and Zacks, 2011). Discontinuities in space or time while a character continued an action were found to be associated with decreases in activation of the right lateral superior frontal cortex. However, no changes in brain activation were reported at major scene breaks in the foremost regions of the brain. It is not clear what effect the use of establishing shots had on these results.\n\nSmith (2005) writes that discontinuities, which can include abrupt changes in location or scene, have been shown to cause increases in self-reported arousal as well as physiological responses indicative of greater arousal and attention being directed toward a cut. He also writes that a cut to a new scene or location or other discontinuities of comparable cognitive difficulty can lead to cognitive overload. It is worth noting, however, that there are many forms of discontinuities, and so these results may not necessarily be specific to locational/scenic shifts.\n\nTransitions between unrelated video images have been shown to require greater attention from subjects than shifts between video images that remain within one unaltered narrative scene taking place in one location (Geiger and Reeves, 1993). However, those unrelated clips were from a variety of sources, and therefore transitions between them may not necessarily represent transitions between scenes or locations within one continuous film. Using a similar distinction between related and unrelated images, Lang et al. (1993) found that unrelated cuts consumed more processing capacity.\n\nPupil diameter is an additional measure that can gauge cognitive load, and has been used for this purpose in a variety of settings (Laeng et al., 2012; Chen and Epps, 2014; Zagermann et al., 2016). Chen and Epps (2014) note that pupil diameter has been found to be a reliable indicator of cognitive load in a wide range of situations. Pupil diameter has also been used as a measure of cognitive load during film viewing (Smith et al., 2006; Swallow et al., 2009; Magliano and Zacks, 2013). Pupil diameter has been found to increase with increasing cognitive demands of a task (Beatty and Lucero-Wagoner, 2000; Zagermann et al., 2016), and around points in films that viewers identified as boundaries between events (Magliano and Zacks, 2013). In addition to measuring cognitive load, pupil diameter can be used as a measure of arousal, with larger pupil sizes indicating greater arousal (Laeng et al., 2012). Cognitive load, arousal, and pupil diameter all seem to be correlated with one another, and their functions may be psychologically integrated. Thus, we intend to infer cognitive load and arousal based on pupil diameter.\n\nWe hypothesize that the use of an establishing shot will decrease arousal and cognitive load experienced during the following scene compared to the use of no establishing shot. We anticipate that this effect will be most pronounced for actors establishing shots, moderate for exterior establishing shots, and least pronounced for geographic establishing shots. This is because actors establishing shots are closest to the action that follows in the next scene in terms of scale, while exterior establishing shots are further from the action and geographic establishing shots are the furthest. It is expected that the greater the difference in scale between the establishing shot and the following scene, the greater the logical leap that must be made to connect the two, resulting in more cognitive load and arousal.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe goal of this study was to determine the degree to which the use of the various forms of the establishing shot help a viewer process shifts to new interior locations within a film by measuring oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex and pupil diameter. It was hypothesized that the use of actors establishing shot would cause the lowest levels of oxygenation and pupil diameter, followed by exterior, geographic, and finally no establishing shot. However, for average pupil diameter, geographic establishing shots caused significantly lower average pupil diameter than all other establishing shot types and no establishing shot. In addition, the actors establishing shot caused significantly lower average pupil diameters than no establishing shot. Initially, no main effect of establishing shot type was found for maximum or average oxygenation values in a scene. However, there was a group-by-condition interaction for both of these measures caused by the values from group 3. When group 3 was removed from the analysis, however, both the maximum and average oxygenation values for the actor establishing shot condition were significantly higher than for the exterior establishing shot condition.\n\nThe average oxygenation values corroborate the findings of the maximum oxygenation values. Both average and maximum oxygenation values associated with exterior establishing shots were significantly lower than those associated with actors establishing shots. Thus, it appears that exterior establishing shots are better at reducing cognitive load during scene transitions than actors establishing shots. In contrast, there is no difference between exterior establishing shots and the use of no establishing shot in terms of arousal. In terms of workload, none of the establishing shot types were found to differ from no establishing shot. The addition of the establishing shot does nothing to help make the film transition easier to process. Thus, the advantage of the use of the establishing shot is through its ability to reduce arousal, not its ability to reduce the recruitment of cognitive resources needed to process a scene transition.\n\nThe differences between the results of the pupil diameter and fNIRS data may indicate the difference in the way establishing shots affect arousal versus cognitive load. Pupil diameter is thought to measure arousal and cognitive load, while fNIRS only measures cognitive load. It was found that the data diverged across the two measures: actor establishing shots caused greater oxygenation than exterior establishing shots, but no such pattern was found with pupil diameter. Instead, pupil diameter was minimized with geographic establishing shots, and the use of no establishing shot caused higher average pupil diameter than the use of actors establishing shots. Because the measures disagree, it would seem that scene changes prefaced by exterior actor establishing shots are easier to process than actor establishing shots, but that actors establishing shots elicited less arousal than no establishing shots and that geographic establishing shots cause less arousal than all other establishing shot conditions.\n\nThe divergence of arousal and cognitive load might be explicable through neuroanatomy. Perhaps arousal and cognitive load are mediated by two completely different brain systems: arousal by the limbic system, and cognitive load by cortical areas. This might explain why the eye tracking data and fNIRS data do not coincide.\n\nThere was a group-by-condition interaction in the pupil diameter data, and in the fNIRS data when group 3 was included. This could indicate that the order in which a particular establishing shot was presented affected the results. It is also possible that the specific pairing of the establishing shot and scene had an effect as well. In addition, the specific shots used for each type of establishing shot differed across groups. For instance, a different building is featured in the exterior establishing shot in each group. This was because the importance of having an establishing shot that could plausibly be paired with the following scene’s location was prioritized over having consistency in the image presented across groups. In the case of group 3, the particular images selected as establishing shots may have created especially jarring scene transitions, which may explain its influence on the fNIRS results. Pupil diameter values may have also been influenced by differing levels of luminance in different establishing shots or scenes, causing the group-by-condition interaction.\n\nGeographic establishing shots as well as actors establishing shots were both found to cause less arousal than using no establishing shot, seeming to indicate that using these types of establishing shots can indeed create smoother transitions between scenes. This would indicate that filmmakers’ and film theorist’s intuitions have been partially validated; for specific types of establishing shot, the use of the establishing shot as a means of smoothing scene transitions has been upheld. Specifically, geographic establishing shots seem to be best at performing their intended function, and may be worth using more often in future films. However, the establishing shot’s effect may be because the sample in this study is accustomed to scenes in novel locations being prefaced with actors and geographic establishing shots, and so the absence of these types of shots during scene transitions seems jarring. Indeed, Schwan and Ildirar (2010) suggest that comprehension of the establishing shot technique is not naturally intuited by first-time film viewers, but is conditioned through repeated exposure to film. It is also possible that, despite being jarring, the transitions using no establishing shot may not have needed enough cognitive resources during their processing to be associated with any detectable increase in cognitive load.\n\nFrom these results, it is concluded that having an actors establishing shot or geographic establishing shot can smooth transitions between scenes by decreasing arousal but not by decreasing cognitive workload. Exterior establishing shots have no effect on arousal or cognitive load compared to forgoing the establishing shot.\n\nThis study had several important limitations. The first was sample size; each group only had seven to eight participants, which limits the amount of confidence that one can invest in the significant results found. Further, since the experimental stimulus was not designed to have a coherent narrative, it does not wholly resemble a commercial, narrative film. Thus, future studies may want to explore the effect of the establishing shot while participants are watching a widely distributed feature-length commercial film as a means of generalizing the results found in this study. Future studies may also want to investigate the different areas of the brain responsible for arousal and cognitive load."
