        "text": "Filming has begun in London on In the Shadows, the true story of refugee Ramla Ali who, without her parents’ knowledge, secretly pursued boxing to become the first Somali-British professional boxing champion.\n\nThe film is presented by Civic Studios, a global media company that creates entertainment with social impact. It is directed by Anthony Wonke (Dettori, Syria: Children on the Frontline, Ronaldo) who will make his narrative fiction film debut.\n\nThe screenplay is written by playwright and screenwriter Ursula Rani Sarma (Bodkin, Delicious).\n\nProducing is Lee Magiday (The Favourite, The Lobster) for Sleeper Films and Madeleine Sanderson (Being AP, Fighting for a City) for Affine Films. Christopher Aoun (Capernaum) is the cinematographer and Kharmel Cochrane (A Quiet Place: Day One, Saltburn, Rye Lane) is casting the film.\n\nRamla Ali’s determination to succeed against all odds enabled her to overcome significant challenges in and out of the boxing ring, breaking through gender barriers and shattering cultural stereotypes. Her tenacity led her to historic achievements, including being the first boxer, male or female, to represent Somalia at the 2020 Olympic Games and winning the first-ever professional female boxing match in Saudi Arabia. In 2023, Ali clinched her first professional IBF intercontinental title at Superbantam weight at Madison Square Gardens and was recognized as one of TIME magazine’s 2023 Women of the Year.\n\nJasmine Jobson (pictured), best known for her role as Jaq in Netflix’s Top Boy and upcoming in Andrea Arnold’s Bird, is set to portray the trailblazing Somali-British professional boxer, model, and UNICEF Ambassador. Finn Cole (Last Breath, Peaky Blinders, Fast & Furious 9) will star alongside Jobson as her husband, Richard Moore, while Gershwyn Eustache Jr (Andor, Small Axe, Fortitude) plays her boxing coach. Ramla Ali and Richard Moore will serve as executive producers.\n\nThe film is executive produced by Zygi Kamasa for True Brit Entertainment, Will Clarke, Andy Mayson and Mike Runagall for Altitude, Anushka Shah for Civic Studios, Richard Fearn and Jane Reid Fearn at Affine Films, Natasha Mudhar for The World We Want Studios, Anne Sheehan, Ramla Ali and Richard Moore.\n\nTrue Brit Entertainment, the leading distributor of independent British feature films, will release the film in 2025 in cinemas across the UK and Ireland, with Altitude handling International Sales. Zygi Kamasa, CEO of True Brit Entertainment said: “As the nation is gripped by a summer of sport, we’re delighted to announce we’re bringing Ramla’s inspiring true story and British sporting triumph to the big screen. The film brings together some of the UK’s most exciting talent both on and off screen to tell this remarkable tale of grit and determination.”\n\nAnthony Wonke said: “There is no doubt Jasmine Jobson is one of Britain’s finest and most exciting actors out there today and brings an incredible intelligence and emotionally raw honesty to her roles. Ramla’s story is one of perseverance and bravery against the odds and we couldn’t be more delighted to have an actor that so connects and empathises with Ramla’s story in such a profound way.”\n\nDiscussing her vision for In the Shadows, Lee Magiday said: “Ramla’s journey is a deeply inspiring tale of self-belief and commitment. From a young refugee to Boxing Champion and founder of her charity Sisters Club, Ramla has forged a path for future generations of young women. In bringing her story to the screen, our hope is to ignite passion and courage in everyone who dares to dream.”\n\nSharing her insights on the film, Madeleine Sanderson said: “Wherever someone starts in life, whatever cards they are dealt, with enough belief they can change the world. Ramla’s story is one of endeavour and determination…which becomes a celebration of women, individuality, family and belonging.”\n\nAnushka Shah, CEO of Civic Studios commented: “Ramla’s story is truly inspiring and deserves to be heard by audiences around the world. It’s a story of perseverance in the face of adversity, the immigrant experience, and most importantly, of a champion boxer.”\n\nSpeaking about Jasmine Jobson portraying her on-screen, Ramla Ali said: “I, along with everyone else, fell in love with Jasmine after seeing her incredible performance as Jaq in Top Boy. She understands more than anyone the true experience of growing up in London and fighting for yourself and your place in this world. She brings with her an incredible amount of authenticity, rawness, and real emotion that can’t be taught. I couldn’t be more excited to see her embody me on the screen.”\n\nIt was at the boxing club where Ramla trained that she met her future husband, Richard Moore, who converted to Islam – a testament to his profound love for her. At its heart, “In the Shadows” is a unique love story woven into a rich family drama that showcases the challenges and triumphs of Ramla and Richard, a mixed-race couple. As they navigate racial and cultural barriers, their shared strength and mutual support sets them apart as role models for a new generation.\n\nReflecting on the film’s extensive social impact, Natasha Mudhar, Executive Producer and Founder of The World We Want Studios, a mission-driven entertainment hub that produces powerful stories to inspire positive social change, said: “In the Shadows is more than a movie; it’s the potential start of a movement. I am inspired by how Ramla’s journey – a profound testament to the power of self-belief and the strength derived from one’s roots – inspires us to enact real change through storytelling.”\n\nThe coming-of-age film traces Ramla’s extraordinary journey within a strict Muslim family in London’s multicultural East End, capturing her pursuit of self-discovery and empowerment. This helped her step out of the shadows to claim her identity and voice amidst her own religious and cultural frameworks. The film also illuminates the collective challenges faced by Somali British Muslim women and similar diaspora and refugee communities globally, demonstrating the power of perseverance against cultural and societal odds.\n\nimage: Jasmine Jobson by Jurga Ramonaite\n\nPippa Considine\n\nShare this story"
