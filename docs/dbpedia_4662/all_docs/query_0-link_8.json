        "text": "We will miss seeing everyone at the Sidewalk Cinema for the next two weeks and wanted to pass along themed programming selections. Should you be in quarantine or simply spending more time at home/secluded because of the current situation, we hope that these suggestions are helpful. Plus we need to keep our programming skills sharp so that we can continue to bring stellar films and cinematic opportunities to Birmingham once we all get through this.\n\nBelow is a list of categorized film suggestions, many with notes and some with additional resources, for your at-home film viewing. We hope you enjoy the selections and would love to keep in contact and hear what you think via social media and/or email.\n\nIf you don’t have Netflix, Stay Tuned – We will be releasing lists from Amazon Prime Video and Hulu!\n\nWATCH IT NOW FILMS ON NETFLIX – Click any title to watch it on Netflix!\n\nThe + means the film can be considered an indie.\n\nThe * means that the film is a festival selection.\n\nThe # means the film was a cinema selection,\n\nThe / means the writer and/or director was a Sidewalk Film Festival alum.\n\nStraight Up Stellar Films:\n\nFRANCES HA+ /\n\nCo-written and starring Sidewalk Film Festival alum Greta Gerwig and directed by Noah Baumbach (MARRIAGE STORY).\n\nA couple of fun facts, the film was shot mostly covertly in New York and Frances’ parents are played by Greta Gerwig’s real-life mom and dad. If you’re a Gerwig fan you’ll be extra happy, as she’s in every scene of the film. Should you get major cabin fever we suggest re-enacting the David Bowie dance on an empty sidewalk.\n\nHere’s a terrific companion article to the film written by Gerwig about, well, messing up a lot: link.\n\nMORRIS FROM AMERICA + *\n\nPart of the 18th Annual Sidewalk Film Festival line-up, MORRIS FROM AMERICA.\n\nCraig Robinson landed his role in MR. ROBOT because Sam Esmail, the creator of the series, saw early footage from MORRIS FROM AMERICA.\n\nGREEN ROOM + /\n\nSidewalk alum director Jeremy Saulnier’s follow up to the amazing BLUE RUIN (also included in this list). GREEN ROOM is Anton Yelchin’s last film to be theatrically released before his death in June 2016.\n\nBeware, if you’re looking for something less intense skip this title, as well as BLUE RUIN, and head to some of the more comedic suggestions in our lists.\n\nHere’s a terrific Anatomy of A Scene with Saulnier: link\n\nBLUE RUIN + /\n\nAlso from Sidewalk alum director Jeremy Saulnier.\n\nROUNDERS\n\nA 90’s flashback that will inspire poker playing. Thanks to a Howard Stern interview, it’s been rumored that ROUNDERS was based on Norm Macdonald. Here’s an article with Macdonald about the film (and poker): link\n\nTHE CRAFT #\n\nYou never know how long a film will stick around on Netflix, so be sure to catch a screening of THE CRAFT while it’s on the service.\n\nTake this opportunity to visit Fairuza Balk’s website: link\n\nYes, there’s a store…\n\nOTHER PEOPLE + *\n\nA selection of the 18th annual Sidewalk Film Festival, SNL writer Chris Kelly based OTHER PEOPLE on his own personal experience moving home to care for his mother as she was suffering from cancer. The film has a lovely and sharp balance of humor and sentiment.\n\nCHLOE\n\nWith strong, intentional b-movie vibes, CHLOE is super entertaining and highly likely to take your mind of the current state of things.\n\nSLING BLADE +\n\nA southern classic (shot in Arkansas) that is worth revisiting, SLINGBLADE is the product of advice that Billy Wilder passed along to Billy Bob Thornton, stating that he was too ugly to be an actor and should be a writer instead. A trivia mention that will enhance your viewing of the film: in an effort to make the character’s walk more awkward, Thornton put crushed glass in his shoes. Here’s a great companion piece to the film via Mental Floss: link.\n\nHOMECOMING: A FILM BY BEYONCÉ #\n\nCo-directed by Beyoncé and featuring her 2018 Coachella performance, including behind-the-scenes glimpses.\n\nDid You Miss It At The Cinema?\n\nTHE IRISHMAN #\n\nHere’s an incredible, albeit somber, article penned by Martin Scorsese, himself: link.\n\nTHE TWO POPES #\n\nThe film was a 2020 Academy Award nominee for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role and Best Adapted Screenplay\n\nMARRIAGE STORY + #\n\nAn interesting article with a marriage therapist regarding MARRIAGE STORY, It contains spoilers, so its best to read after viewing: link\n\nGOOD TIME + # /\n\nThe 2017 film screened as part of the Sidewalk Cinema 20 For 20 Series, featuring 20 of the best films of the last 20 years.

JOHNSON + *\n\nA 2017 SHOUT selection\n\nAMERICAN FACTORY +\n\n2020 Academy Award Winner, Best Documentary Feature\n\n20 FEET FROM STARDOM +\n\nPremiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nJOAN DIDION THE CENTER WILL NOT HOLD +\n\nDirected by actor Griffin Dunne (AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON).\n\nWomen In Film Week puts the spotlight on female filmmakers. In this inaugural year, we are focusing specifically on female directors and writers.\n\nAs is reflected in the 2020 Academy Award Best Director nominations, there exist clear barriers for women in the film industry. Such is true historically and remains today. Despite the odds, women manage to consistently innovate film art. At our annual film festival and throughout the year at the Sidewalk Cinema we seek out interesting, innovative, important cinematic works that are directed, written, edited and/or lensed by women and we wanted to put a specific, singular focus on such annually at the Cinema. Therefore, we have launched Women In Film Week and are excited about our inaugural line-up.\n\nHere are a few words from our programmers about our selections:\n\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE\n\nArguably the best film of the year – written and directed by Céline Sciamma.\n\nMarianne is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of reluctant Héloïse, the appointment is more of an undertaking than Marianne anticipated, her and Héloïse get to know one another throughout the process and, eventually, start hardcore crushing. It’s 18th century France though and Héloïse is about to get arranged married, both of which really complicate things… to say the least.\n\nFeaturing gorgeous cinematography, immaculate direction, and flawless performances, we’ve been waiting for more than half a year to program this one and are intensely proud to land it with perfect timing during Women In Film Week. This film will change your life.\n\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE won the Queer Palm at Cannes, it is the first film directed by a woman to win the award.\n\nTHE FITS\n\nIn Anna Rose Holmer’s feature film debut, 11-year-old Toni stumbles upon a rec center dance team and is drawn to join. Her arrival marks the start of the team’s strange fainting spells and violent fits. Dreamy and mysterious, THE FITS, is a poetic, surreal exploration of femininity. Holmer recruited real-life, Cincinnati-based drill-dance team, Q-Kidz, for the film, including lead heroine Royalty Hightower – the team was provided part ownership of the film. We couldn’t resist an opportunity to project THE FITS on the big screen with all of its perplexity and enchantment.\n\nNIGHT CATCHES US\n\nEx-Black Panther, Marcus, returns to the racially divided Philadelphia neighborhood for his reverend father’s funeral. Having been accused of being an informant in regards to the slaying of a fellow Panter, Marcus grapples with place and past.\n\n10 years in the making, writer-director Tanya Hamilton combined historical facts with creative liberty to develop NIGHT CATCHES US. The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and the same year was an Indiewire Critics’ Poll nominee, Gotham Awards nominee and a 2011 Film Independent Spirit Awards nominee, Alliance of Women Film Journalists nominee and NAACP Image Awards nominee in multiple categories.\n\nHALF THE PICTURE\n\nThis documentary lays out the fact that straight-up women in the film industry are not offered equal opportunities as compared to their male counterparts. Featuring interviews with Ava DuVernay, Catherine Hardwicke, Brenda Chapman, Caroline Libresco, Jamie Babbit, Rosanna Arquette, Kimberly Peirce, Lena Dunham, Martha Coolidge, Lynn Shelton, Penelope Spheeris and more… damn. HALF THE PICTURE is directed by Amy Adrion and premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nGIRLS TRIP, BRIDESMAIDS and ROUGH NIGHT\n\nFriday night, March 13th we wanted to celebrate female friendship and put together a super fun “best friend” triple feature with heavy-hitters GIRLS TRIP, BRIDESMAIDS and ROUGH NIGHT.\n\nWritten by Erica Rivinoja, Kenya Barris & Tracy Oliver, GIRLS TRIP is the first film produced, written, directed by and starring African-Americans to cross the $100-million mark.\n\nFour longtime friends travel to New Orleans for the annual Essence Festival and it gets crazy.\n\nWhile female-led comedies are consistently considered risky financial endeavors, BRIDESMAIDS is the most financially successful Judd Apatow production. Written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, BRIDESMAIDS was a game-changer in regards to the successful financing of future female-led comedies. It’s also really fun to watch and consider this, Melissa McCarthy based the look and characterization of Megan in part on Guy Fier. A maid of honor and a bridesmaid compete for the attention of their mutual BFF and it’s freaking hilarious.\n\nDirected and co-written by Lucia Aniello, ROUGH NIGHT joins the forces of Jillian Bell, Scarlett Johansson, Zoë Kravitz, Ilana Glazer, and Kate McKinnon. Daaaaang.\n\nA well-intended Miami bachelor party goes way, way, way off the rails with the appearance of a male stripper.\n\nThe focus of all films in the triple feature is on the importance and weight of friendship and the acknowledgment that women should have each other’s backs. All three films are super fun to watch with an audience and we’re excited to bring them back to the big screen and celebrate all the women who made these re-watch worthy films possible and special.\n\nBOOKSMART\n\nTurning the focus again to the importance of friendship and the intricacies of such, BOOKSMART is sharp, hilarious, honest, bright and, above all else, fun as hell. One of the greatest buddy comedies of all time, Olivia Wilde’s critically acclaimed directorial debut was written by Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel, and Katie Silberman.\n\nAfter four years of academic excess, over-achieving besties Amy and Molly decide to finally throw down on the eve of their high school graduation and chaos ensues. We wanted to be sure to include a film that places the focus on young women and BOOKSMART perfectly captures the magic, surprise and exciting uncertainty of a late high school evening out.\n\nWithout a doubt, BOOKSMART should have received an Academy Best Director nomination.\n\nWANDA\n\nWritten, directed and starring Barbara Loden, WANDA is an impressive accomplishment. Shot on location in eastern Pennsylvania and Connecticut with a tiny crew of seven people (sometimes as few as four) and featuring a great deal of improvised dialogue and numerous non-actors, WANDA is a unique, innovative, complex feminist masterpiece. The film is Loden’s directorial debut and her only feature works.\n\nOverlooked upon its release and virtually forgotten for decades, the last few years have seen masterwork, WANDA, begin to acquire the recognition that it deserves. Including the 2017 selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress and a new restoration (completed in 2018) followed by a weeklong run at the Metrograph theatre in New York.\n\nBarbara Loden once wrote, “I tried to be independent and to create my own way. Otherwise, I would have become like Wanda, all my life just floating around.” WANDA is a hardworking product of that deliberate independence.\n\nAfter leaving her job and her husband and relinquishing custody of her children, Wanda Goronski splits town. After a number of unfortunate run-ins, Wanda finds herself on the run with a volatile bank robber.\n\nBUFFALOED\n\nWe’re excited to screen Tanya Wexler’s so-called “late-capitalism comedy”, BUFFALOED, as part of Women In Film Week. Starring Zoey Deutch, the film premiered at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival and is currently in theatrical release. In an effort to pay for Ivy League tuition, Peg gets involved the shady debt collection underworld.\n\nVARDA BY AGNÈS\n\nPioneering feminist French film director Agnès Varda passed away last March. Among many things, her work was highly influential in the French New Wave movement. In VARDA BY AGNÈS, Varda, herself, uses photos and film excerpts to reflect on her career. We are honored to celebrate her great work.\n\nValentine’s sure is a divisive day. Love it or hate it, most don’t land between, plus it can clearly be circumstantial.\n\nWe wanted to do something for folks who fall on both sides of the Valentine’s coin and, either way, we definitely wanted to make it fun! What we’ve come up with is our official Kiss ‘Em or Diss ‘Em Valentine’s Day Spectacular event.\n\nSo… if you’re happily in love (even if only with Leo) we have Baz Luhrmann’s stylish 90’s-core ROMEO + JULIET in one cinema room and, for those heartbreakers or heartbroken, the ridiculously fun 80’s-era MY BLOODY VALENTINE will be screening across the hall. Of course, we’re not requiring proof of partnership or singletude, so catch the film of your choice, after all, what’s better than yelling at an ax-wielding mass murderer with your sweetheart or broken-heartedly basking in the glow of young Leo’s collagen?\n\nValentine’s Day seems like the perfect excuse to throw a party, so we’re going to really be pulling out all the red and pink stops with astrology readings, junior high school style carnation shout outs, photo ops, drink specials and more – as you know, we think film is best when it’s experiential. If you’re a total scrub we’ll have surprises in the lobby so bring a date, a friend or your shadow and hang out with us, we promise not to let them know you’re a cheapo.\n\nBut – if you’re NOT a cheapo and you’re up for pulling all the strings – check out our VIP package upgrade for any of the night’s ticket purchases! For an additional $20 to your ticket purchase, this upgrade comes with a drink ticket good for any beer, wine or valentine’s specialty cocktail (21+ only!), plus a custom iced cookie and a limited edition I ♥️ Sidewalk magnet.\n\nA little more about our film selections:\n\nMY BLOODY VALENTINE is an obvious choice, c’mon it’s Quentin Tarantino’s all-time favorite slasher. Who can resist a film that contains the Valentine’s poem, “Roses are Red Violets are Blue One is Dead and So Are You”. Released on February 11, 1981, according to the film’s producer, MY BLOODY VALENTINE was “cut to ribbons” in order to achieve an R-rating, such didn’t prevent it from becoming a massive 80’s home video rental favorite. We appreciate the slumber party vibes that MY BLOODY VALENTINE gives off and the film being shot on location in mines with limited lighting makes the production value, alone, worth a big-screen viewing. Also, Valentine is right there in the title!\n\nWe loved the idea of countering the 80’s slasher classic with a hyper 90’s style piece and what better than the basis for half the cinematic romances of all time? According to Luhrmann, he developed ROMEO + JULIET from the premise of making a film in a manner “in which Shakespeare might make a movie of one of his plays if he was a director. Shakespeare was a relentless entertainer and a user of incredible devices and theatrical tricks to ultimately create something of meaning.” We’re not sure about all that, but Luhrmann did manage to make a strange, overly stylish 90’s time capsule that is, at moments, dreamy and at others cringe-worthy in the best way. Fun fact: Key hair stylist Aldo Signoretti was kidnapped by gang members during production and held for $300 ransom which Baz Luhrmann paid – now that’s true love.\n\nClick Here to Purchase Tickets to Kiss ‘Em or Diss ‘Em\n\nWe wanted to be sure to cater to ALL audiences this Valentine’s Day, so later in the evening, we’re hosting a very special Valentine’s GAY Spectacular!\n\nThere are so few LGBTQ+ centric Valentine’s Day events! Join us Valentine’s night for screenings of the award-winning CALL ME BY YOUR NAME and cult classic BUT I’M A CHEERLEADER plus lots of fun surprises.\n\nA few words about the films:\n\nWe know there’s an army of people out there who want to spend Valentines gazing upon the oh so precious Timothée Chalamet and such being balanced by the sheer weight of Armie Hammer makes is a no-brainer… so CALL ME BY YOUR NAME was an obvious choice. Plus it was the 2018 Oscar Best Picture nominee and winner of Best Adapted Screenplay, pretty impressive for mainstream Hollywood to acknowledge an Italian directed film about a May-December romance between two annoyingly attractive men. Join us for the seasonally appropriate opportunity to watch Armie Hammer awkwardly dance and not-so-awkwardly make out with Timmy Chalamet.\n\nHad enough of Timothée Chalame’s hair? Not to worry, the ridiculous (in the best way) and fun BUT I’M A CHEERLEADER is just a few steps away. 1999 was a weird year and one that joined the forces of Natasha Lyonne, Michelle Williams, Mink Stole, Clea DuVall, RuPaul, and Cathy Moriarty (thank you, director, Jamie Babbit)! In case you didn’t know, BUT I’M A CHEERLEADER is about a high school cheerleader (played by Natasha Lyonne) whose parents send her to a conversion therapy camp to cure her lesbianism. I know, we had you at Michelle Williams.\n\nThe 12 Days Of Christmas Sidewalk line-up is about as diverse as holiday line-ups get, from the brilliant to the… well, bad. After all, ‘tis the season to celebrate all things great and small. From one of the most skillfully nuanced masterpieces of the century to a PTSD-fueled killer Santa… to Dolly. Here are a few thoughts on a handful of our selections from the series.\n\nMore vibe than strict holiday fare, the Douglas Sirk masterwork All That Heaven Allows is the story of a well-to-do widower, Cary Scott, who falls for the not-so-well-to-do hunk Ron Kirby. Cary’s college-age kids are brats and demand that the relationship ends. No surprise, the country club crowd isn’t too kind either. In addition to a number of beautifully captured holiday scenes, what better a season to question societal norms and acknowledge just what a pain in the ass family can be? Plus Technicolor has never looked so damn good, dozens of frames from the film also work just as well as paintings. All That Heaven Allows perfectly captures the seasonal spirit and holiday landscape with all of the wonder, sadness, melodrama and beauty that it brings.\n\nDo you ever feel like the 1 percent are gambling with your livelihood? In 1983, director John Landis made a comedy that suggests that it might not be entirely just paranoia. In Trading Places, Dan Aykroyd’s uptight stockbroker and Eddie Murphy’s streetwise hustler swap lots in life one holiday season, thanks to manipulation by the wealthy Duke brothers (Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy). But when the two find their lives have been experimented upon, they team up with Jamie Lee Curtis’s free-spirited sex worker to bring the wealthy brothers down. Filled with quotable one-liners, memorable performances, and deeply silly screwball action, Trading Places stands still as one of the most enjoyable Saturday Night Live star vehicles, cementing Murphy’s status as one of the most important stars of the 1980s.\n\nDirector Todd Haynes is no stranger to melodrama, having crafted his own take on All That Heaven Allows in 2002’s Far From Heaven and more recently adapting Patricia Highsmith’s The Price of Salt as his brilliant 2015 love story Carol. Set during the holiday season in 1950s New York City, Carol is the story of the whirlwind romance between shopgirl Therese (Rooney Mara) and the titular socialite (Cate Blanchett). Featuring a memorably lush score from Carter Burwell and period-appropriate Super 16mm film by cinematographer Ed Lachman, Carol is top-notch on every possible level — one of the best films of the decade, featuring some of its strongest, most sensitive performances.\n\nLooking for a little misanthropy this holiday season? Sick of peace on earth and want anything but goodwill towards men? Terry Zwigoff’s Bad Santa, from a story, originated by Joel and Ethan Coen, is the film for you. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Willie, a drunken lout of a thief posing as a mall Santa to pull off a holiday heist — despite being terrible with children, addicted to sex and generally the most unpleasant person alive. Despite his best efforts, an annoying youngster named Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) bonds with the dissolute Willie. And the local mall’s chief of security (Bernie Mac) catches wise to his plan. Definitely, non-PC antics ensue. This one’s definitely not for the kids; there’s something in Bad Santa to bother everyone, which is what makes it such an off-kilter holiday classic, in its own perverse way.\n\nCelebrate the holidays with two transgender sex workers in Sean Baker’s marvelously warm and propulsive Tangerine, set on and around the streets of Hollywood on one sunny Christmas eve. An uncontrollable force of nature, Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) gets out of jail and catches word that her boyfriend/pimp, Chester (James Ransone) has been cheating on her. Despite her closest friend, Alexandra (Mya Taylor), warning her to relax, Sin-Dee goes on a Hollywood rampage to find the woman her boyfriend has been seeing. Baker shot the entire film on the iPhone 5S; each frame is soaked in the vivid colors of a Los Angeles sunset. The result is an intimate and raw but lovely story about friendship and grace in a subculture that rarely gets such a humane portrayal.\n\nWhat’s Christmas without Dolly Parton?! We’ll take any excuse to include Dolly in a film series, or any series for that matter, but, of all years, Dolly sure is having a moment. We highly recommend binge-listening to the NPR podcast Dolly’s America and then joining us for one of our handful of free screenings of A Smoky Mountain Christmas and celebrate the living legend and our wintery neighbor – the Smoky Mountains. Fun fact, it was directed by Henry Winkler aka The Fonz.\n\nSilent Night, Deadly Night – we couldn’t resist. Come on, have a little fun this holiday season. What do you do when your senile grandfather warns you to watch out for Santa and then your parents are killed by a dude in a Santa suit? Why you grow up, get buff, work in a toy store and get Christmas triggered into throwing on a Santa suit and going on your very own murderous, ax-wielding holiday rampage. Duh.\n\nThis year marks the release yet another remake of Black Christmas so we thought we’d put a spotlight on the OG classic that got all this Christmas-sorority-house-stalking-killer stuff started, the 1974 cult classic Black Christmas starring Margot Kidder and Olivia Hussey. Oh and, yes, directed by that Bob Clark, the same dude who directed A Christmas Story (and Porky’s). After all, we need a little break from all the Christmas time life lesson, Grinch turns nice (we’ve got that too!) stuff.\n\nReady to get out of the house (with or without your family) this Thanksgiving? Throw on your stretchy pants and come to Sidewalk Film Center +Cinema! We’re celebrating the holiday all weekend long with drink specials, free screenings, and more! Here is a little more information on the films we have playing.\n\nThanksgiving Day Screenings\n\nHopefully, your Thanksgiving will be free from familial disagreements, but if you find yourself in conflict with your loved ones, take solace that however badly your dinner may have gone, at least your family isn’t like the one in Blood Rage. We’re screening this controversial and super satisfying slasher late in the evening on Thanksgiving, so wake up from your turkey-induced nap to check out the wild, gory tale of a homicidal maniac and the twin brother framed for his crimes. So put that carving fork to proper use this holiday, and if you see something red and sticky, remember… it’s not cranberry sauce.\n\nNotorious for being what Kevin Costner thought was going to be his big break (his scenes were cut and he ended up only as a faceless corpse), The Big Chill was nominated for 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film has been included among the “1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die” (Steven Jay Schneider) and is a member of the Criterion Collection. Shot in Beaufort, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia, the story of a group of former college friends gathering due to the tragic death of one of their classmates, The Big Chill makes for perfect, albeit non-traditional, Southern Thanksgiving cinematic fare. In addition to friendship gathering and an on-screen Thanksgiving-specific scene, off-screen the cast was made to cook big meals together in character during the rehearsal phase of production, such has been said to have greatly contributed to the dynamic connection between actors/characters, as well as the film’s overall tone. Click here for a fun article about The Big Chill.\n\nContinuing our cinematic celebration of Thanksgiving and in the spirit of giving, we’ll be screening a secret, free, PG-13 retrospective Thanksgiving film on Thanksgiving Day. Join us and be surprised, if you don’t like it, we’ll give you a refund.\n\nDo you love Thanksgiving TV episodes as much as we do? If so (or even if you don’t, but just want a fun break from or with family and friends), join us in the Sidewalk Cinema lobby on Thanksgiving Day. Starting at about 1:30 pm we’ll be showing classic television Thanksgiving episodes all day and evening long – sitcoms, dramas and more. The line-up is packed with surprises and will be screening throughout the lobby bar so that you can relax and grab a drink (we’ll have plenty of seasonal specials) and enjoy a diverse line-up of seasonal classics. Lobby programming is always free at the Sidewalk Cinema.\n\nBlack Friday Screening Series\n\nFor Black Friday we have a doorbuster of a series, featuring all films about shopping – Personal Shopper, Mallrats and for the blackest of all Black Fridays, Chopping Mall.\n\nWe’re proud to show the 2017 supernatural drama Personal Shopper which reteams Kristen Stewart with her Clouds of Sils Maria director Olivier Assayas. In it, Stewart stars as a personal shopper for a demanding actress who moonlights as a medium. Having recently experienced the loss of her twin brother, she exists in a kind of emotionally detached limbo, searching for proof of an afterlife — and when she begins receiving mysterious text messages that may or may not come from the beyond, she may have found it. During the 2010s, Stewart became one of the most reliable actresses in independent and international cinema, and she grounds the spooky, mysterious and at times Hitchcockian Personal Shopper in tangible heartbreak and her trademark introverted charisma. It’s a star-making performance in a deeply strange movie that flirts with the great questions and suggests the only answers we can find are those we provide for ourselves.\n\nThe year was 1995, and director Kevin Smith was still reeling from the massive Cannes and Sundance success of his no-budget film Clerks (he shot overnights in the convenience store where he worked to make the movie). Ben Affleck was virtually unknown. Jason Lee was a professional skateboarder who was only dabbling in acting. Shannen Doherty was can’t-go-to-a-store-without-being-mobbed famous and had recently left the cast of Beverly Hills, 90210, at the height of her “difficult to work with” reputation. This pre-WiFi perfect storm of weirdness created the zeitgeisty Mallrats. Supposedly taking place 24 hours before the events featured in Clerks, two best friends seek refuge in the local mall after being dumped by their girlfriends. Does the film stand the test of time? You be the judge. It does take place almost completely in a mall, plus there are tons of fun easter eggs throughout the film… and no other movie in the world features Shannen Doherty, Stan Lee and an orangutan. Click here for a fun article about the film.\n\nMeanwhile, the Black Friday horror selection Chopping Mall has it all: killer robots, Barbara Crampton, and… um… well, that’s really all you need. It’s the story of a state-of-the-art shopping mall (in 1986) with a robotic security system that goes haywire after an electrical storm. Now malfunctioning and murderous, the robots target eight young people who snuck into the mall to party overnight. Gory mayhem ensues, with cameos from ‘80s schlock luminaries like Paul Bartel, Mary Woronov, Gerrit Graham and Dick Miller. Chopping Mall, from master B-movie purveyor Jim Wynorski, is exactly the movie you think it is: killbots on a rampage in a 1980s mall. And you can’t beat that."
