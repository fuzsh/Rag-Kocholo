        "text": "After recently viewing Ex Machina, I realized that I really liked the VFX used in this film (as the VFX in the film looked so realistic). So in this blog post I’m going to be talking about the Movies backstory and discuss some of the VFX used in the movie that I really liked.\n\nStoryA programmer named Caleb wins a one-week visit to the secluded home of Nathan, the billionaire CEO of the software company for which Caleb works. The only other person there is Kyoko, a housemaid who doesn’t speak English. Upon Caleb’s arrival, Nathan reveals he has built a humanoid robot named Ava with artificial intelligence (AI), and wants Caleb to administer a Turing test, which tests an AI’s ability to appear human.\n\nAva is an android with a face and extremities that resemble those of a female human, with portions of transparent mesh that reveal her inner mechanisms. During the course of the Turing tests, she is confined to her apartment. Caleb grows close to her, and after corresponding with Ava on a number of personal matters (such as the death of Caleb’s family and the nature of art) she tells him she wants to go on a date with him. She reveals she can use her battery charging facility to trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system that Nathan uses to monitor their interactions. The power outages also trigger the building’s security system, locking all the doors. During one such outage, Ava says Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted…\n\nAgain I don’t want to get into too much detail as I don’t want to spoil the film for others, but I really enjoyed the film and even though this wasn’t a thrilling action movie like Mad Max: Fury Road or Ant Man, Its VFX was inspirational and the Storyline was excellent. This is definatley worth a watch if you haven’t seen it already! Anyway, the main VFX in this is based around Ava, the AI that has been created in the film. I thought since the majority of the films VFX is based on Ava, I thought that I would talk about the VFX used on Ava and how the VFX company working on her VFX (Which was Double Negative), managed to achieve the VFX standard they did.\n\nDesigning Ava Ava’s final look came from art department concepts and DNeg art, including depicting where real skin would end and where the CG would begin. “I was conscious that I didn’t want to push for super realistic concept paintings,” says Whitehurst. “We had to stop and then go and build it – it’s a sculpting and engineering problem – and then we did turntables. At the start of the shoot we had concepts that featured just clean metal and no textures, and then during the shoot our team would be painting up textures.”\n\n“We made the decision to try and keep the shoulders and armpits in plate for the simple reason that rigging shoulder blades is not that much fun,” notes Whitehurst. “Similarly, we wanted to keep the hands and feet and face because that was the main method of interacting with the environment and the main method of expression. The arms and legs are full CG because we see through them, and the same with the back of the head and neck.”\n\nThe one thing that I really thought was clever about this, was that every single muscle and bone shape in Ava was based on human reference. When designing Ava, Whitehurst had printed 3D prints, that were made for a scene in a lab where another version of her is being constructed. Whitehurst came to a conclusion that when put together, the prints fit together mechanically and just so happened to work therefore staying with the design that you see in the end film.\n\nShooting of Ava\n\nMost of Ex Machina takes place inside Nathan’s house – an isolated building in the mountains filled with glass-lined walls. “The set was really like an enclosed glass box,” describes Whitehurst. “That meant the camera was either inside or outside, and there’s nowhere to hide really, because it meant later on we had to body track things three or four times because the reflections are all different from lens and mirror distortion.”\n\nThat location challenge was exacerbated by the style of the film – Ex Machina isn’t intended to be an action adventure, but a more cerebral and intimate piece. This, in my opinion, is what makes Ex Machina a masterpiece, as before hand I thought the film would be boring and make me fall asleep, however the graphics and VFX used on Ava and used in the film, completely amazed me, which really made the film enjoyable for me (not to mention the great storyline).\n\nBuilding AvaDesign and texturing of an Ava model continued at DNeg during principal photography, after which it was clear the rig had to be ‘astonishingly flexible’. “This was because of the different distortions that the anamorphic lens applies,” explains Whitehurst. “If she’s not perfectly in focus, the lens warps the space, so we have to shift her to counteract that. It’s not just a question of de-lensing it to try and get the lines straight – you have issues, as soon as it goes out of focus, it’s still actually distorting things back and forwards of the focal point.”\n\nTo ensure the CG elements would perfectly match to the live action photography, Vikander was initially photobooth scanned in pre-production so her equivalent CG model could be built. Once the final costume was ready on set, the actress was scanned again and the model refined.\n\nOverall I think this movie is amazing as not only does the film have a fantastic and interesting storyline, but the VFX included in the film is amazing, considering the amount of work that was put into creating one character. Therefore I really liked how the film looked from a story based perspective and a VFX perspective and the VFX used in this movie truly is inspiring!"
