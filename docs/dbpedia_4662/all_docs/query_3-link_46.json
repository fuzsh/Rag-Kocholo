        "text": "Benefits of Filming in London\n\nLondon is a hub for the film industry and is home to some of the most iconic film studios and production houses in the world. Filming in London offers a range of benefits, including tax breaks, a diverse range of architecture and culture, a film-friendly culture, and access to a vibrant film industry.\n\nFilm Friendly Culture\n\nLondon’s film-friendly culture is a major advantage for those considering the city for their next location. The capital has a long history of supporting the film industry, and the local authorities are well-versed in working with filmmakers to ensure that productions run smoothly.\n\nUK Government Incentives\n\nAnother big advantage of filming in London is the tax incentives that are available to filmmakers. The UK government offers a range of tax breaks and incentives to encourage filmmakers to shoot in the country. These include the Film Tax Relief and the High-End Television Tax Relief.\n\nAn Existing Film Industry\n\nLondon’s existing and internationally recognised vibrant film industry is also a major draw for filmmakers. The capital is home to a range of film crews, studios, post-production facilities, and film festivals.\n\nStudios & Stages\n\nPinewood Studios and Leavesden Studios located in, and just outside of London, are some of the largest and most iconic film studios in the world, and has been the home of many blockbuster movies.\n\nPost Production\n\nBesides the film studios and stages, London also has a range of post-production facilities that can provide support for filmmakers. These include various options in Soho’s post-production district such as Lucky Cat Post or Curious Productions which is just a side step away in Farringdon.\n\nFilm Festivals\n\nLondon is also home to a range of film festivals, including the BFI London Film Festival and the Raindance Film Festival. These festivals provide a platform for independent filmmakers to showcase their work and can be a great opportunity for networking and building relationships within the industry.\n\nSmaller Scale Productions\n\nFor smaller scale corporate film and video productions studios such as the Drum Labs or Espero Studio could be considered, and if sound isn’t imperative and filming for more visual based content, Sunset studios in Peckham is a brilliant option as the studio is flooded with natural light and has a really distinctive look. But as they are located right next to the train line, there’s a fair bit of noise pollution. But our recent photography project at Sunset should give you a good idea of what can be achieved in this space.\n\nLastly on our short list of recommendations is the amazing Paper Mill, especially for food related films. With their incredible kitchen space, it’s hard not to fall in love with the place! Check out one of the films we created in this space below;\n\nThe Practicalities & Challenges of Filming in London\n\nWhile London is a popular filming location, it presents certain challenges that filmmakers should note ahead of time. If you’re considering facilitating a video production in London, there are several practical elements ranging from insurance, having relevant permissions and permits, ensuring you don’t disrupt local communities and challenges such as traffic, congestion and, of course, the weather. Luckily, as mentioned above, the film friendly culture makes many of these easily manageable.\n\nWhere you film matters\n\nUnder UK common law, technically filming on public streets or highways is generally free and has minimal restrictions, providing you do not obstruct other users’ rights of free passage and respect the local community and general legal requirements. That being said, it is very easy to come unstuck and fall foul of issues you may not have considered. It is likely that you will need permission or, at the very least, to notify of your intention to film. Reasons include:\n\nLocations that may appear ‘public’ may not in reality be such. Examples include Trafalgar Square, Train & Tube Stations, Housing Estates, Shopping Centres or The Royal Parks.\n\nDepending on where you shoot from and the camera angle you opt for, you may have to seek permission from specific sources due to copyright issues, especially with certain identifiable buildings.\n\nThe local authority may not manage certain streets, but they could be managed by Transport for London’s Street Traffic Control Centre and subject to restrictions\n\nLuckily, each of London’s 33 separate boroughs has its own Borough Film Service to deal with all‌ local authority managed locations including streets, estates, public or common land, schools, public buildings and more. They can also be a substantial source of information and help with obtaining necessary permissions or permits.\n\nInsurance\n\nAll filming and production for commercial or corporate film purposes, including that of students, requires Public Liability Insurance. The amount required will vary on the location, size of production and what your filming will entail. Again, The Borough Film Services will advise on this.\n\nHealth & Safety\n\nYou will be required to adhere to UK Health & Safety Regulations and all that this entails.\n\nGeneral Legal Regulations\n\nYour filming will be required to adhere to many other legal regulations. Luckily, the British Film Commission has a quick guide covering some of the basic legal regulations that may affect your production.\n\nTraffic & Congestion\n\nLondon is a bustling city with millions of residents and visitors, and this can make transportation and logistics for filming quite challenging. The city’s narrow streets, heavy traffic, and limited parking can make it difficult to move equipment and personnel around efficiently. You can work with experienced location managers and transportation teams to plan the most efficient routes and schedules for equipment and personnel, and to ensure that filming locations are accessible and properly secured. You should also work closely with the local authorities and their Borough Film Service to ensure that you have the permits and permissions to film in specific areas, and to avoid any potential traffic hotspots.\n\nCommunity & Noise Restrictions\n\nThe millions of residents that live in London mean you may face noise restrictions or issues from the local community. After all, the capital city is home to millions of people, and ‌you need to respect this.\n\nThe Weather\n\nNo guide would be complete without mentioning the variable and unpredictable nature of the weather in London. The capital city is notorious for its rainy and cloudy weather, which can make outdoor filming challenging to manage. You should prepare and have contingency plans in case of rain or changes in weather, and should have alternative indoor locations lined up in case outdoor shooting is not possible, especially when the conditions are likely to be less favourable. We rely on BBC weather and Google weather for most accurate reports as well as using the sun position app. to give us the best chance of capturing the most flattering natural light.\n\nOur Advice\n\nFilm London and the British Film Commission have some amazing resources you should check out, but for on the ground know-how you can’t beat the borough film services and local film partners and crews."
