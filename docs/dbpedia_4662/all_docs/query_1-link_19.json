        "text": "If you were to put a gun to my head and ask me which genre of film is my favorite, I would most likely not be able to answer; yes, I would take the bullet. My mind constantly shifts from day-to-day on whatever I am interested in at any given moment, and, indeed, I firmly believe that labeling a film as belonging to any one genre is not a very wise thing to do. As of late though, I have been incredibly fascinated with films that have a science fiction bent to them. There is something exceedingly cinematic to stories told about other planets, time travel, and artificial intelligence. A truly great film featuring content about the latter is incredibly hard to find in the current film landscape, but I have nonetheless been searching for an excellent A.I. film, and ultimately not finding one, for years now. I recently saw the mildly okay Chappie, directed by Neill Blomkamp, for this very reason, but sadly my urge still went insatiate. Now that desire has been more than met, as a new film has been released tackling the subject in a completely different manner, one that actively and thankfully uses the aesthetics and form of cinema to its advantage in attempting to seriously tackle this fascinating scientific theory. This film is Ex Machina, and it is the forum by which the highly talented veteran writer Alex Garland finally shows the world how damn good a director he can be.\n\nEx Machina is of a piece with the very best cinematic science fiction. This category excludes sci-fi films that are more fantastical in nature, such as Star Wars or Avatar. I am talking about movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner, films where the aesthetic on-screen and the use of symbols boggles the mind and keeps audiences returning for more viewings long after the first one. I understand how large the amount of praise I have just thrust Ex Machina into is, but it pleased me beyond belief in how it was the first real, serious sci-fi film to tackle issues of gender. What is initially a (very strong) movie about the possibilities, both beneficial and problematic, of creating artificial intelligence ultimately ends up as a beautiful, symbolic treatise on the role of the female in the modern world. But I will get more in depth with that later.\n\nFirst, I should discuss the truly exemplary semantics of this film. The movie really only has three central characters, and, with a few exceptions, is set in one distinct location: the underground home / research facility of a scientific genius named Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac in one of his best performances yet, in a career already filled with exemplary work in every film he has starred in up to this point. Isaac steals every single scene that he is in, giving his own personal twist on the role of the eccentric, mad scientist. The way Isaac plays Nathan is this incredibly smart, yet relatable man with a very sarcastic sense of humor. He takes delight in being compared to God, and he isn’t afraid to include interjections of humor, such as an impromptu dance party, to alleviate the moodiness of the film whenever things get too serious or sinister. Nathan lives in isolated seclusion in his beautiful mountain retreat, whiling away his days with the singular focus of creating something that has never been seen before: an artificial being who would be indistinguishable from any other human. Nathan has no extra-curricular activities, save for his abundant alcoholism, and so, whether as an excuse or out of necessity for human interaction, he asks one of his company’s employees, named Caleb, to come out and visit him so that he can put his newest creation to the test.\n\nCaleb is introduced as the audience’s surrogate, and he is played by the ever-talented Domhnall Gleeson. Gleeson’s performance shows a shy, yet bold everyman whose curiosity always gets the better of him. We are meant to latch on to his character from the outset of the film, but Garland is idea-driven enough that he more than turns this trope on its head by the film’s end. Nathan needs Caleb, an incredibly smart and distinguished programmer, to take part in a Turing test, which will determine whether the A.I. Nathan has built truly shows signs of humanity. The different sessions, as they are termed, that Caleb has with the A.I. are each riveting and certainly stand out among other scenes within the film, revealing a great deal about both Caleb’s optimistic, hope-driven demeanor, and the A.I.’s own (arguable) form of humanity.\n\nI keep referring to her as being “the A.I.”, but the truth is, this individual comprised of wires and gel is her own unique person, and the true lead of the film. Her name is Ava, and the performance that Swedish actress Alicia Vikander gives is already one of the best of the year. She brings the strength of a hundred Natalie Portmans to her facial features, seemingly robotic in her movements, but ultimately oozing forth more humanity and personable pathos than even the real humans in this film do. Ava is a living, breathing creation, ironic as that statement may be. The question firmly on the audience’s mind throughout the duration of the film is whether or not Ava is truly human or not. Vikander does an exceptional job at imbuing Ava with characteristics both organic and mechanical that ensures that those with separate interpretations have ample evidence to make their case with both.\n\nAs with most sci-fi stories about robots, it all boils down to the emotional content that matters the most. With three towering central lead performances that are each distinct and entertainingly different in their own breadth and scale, the film has an incredibly tight structure on which it can build this emotional backbone. Of course, the rest of the film’s components are more than acknowledgeable in their own right, visually, sonically, and vocally giving this movie its own unique status. The cinematography in this film is simply gorgeous, with a majority of the film being shot in Norway, the natural landscapes of which go a long way in hammering home the isolation and closed-off themes of the film, as well as the mindset of Nathan. The interior scenes are shot in a bright, futuristic hue, which helps establish the goals of godhood and transcendence that the characters are attempting to reach, whether they know it or not. The way that these interior scenes are lit also further highlights the ethereal beauty and specialness of Ava, who is constantly lighting up the room with her silvery, chrome head, along with her exposed neon-blue and yellow wires. The musical score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow (who Garland met when he worked on Dredd) is quite memorable, staying in your head long after the film is over, and it goes a long way in upping both the suspense factor of the film and the emotional involvement as we feel along with Ava as she makes her ultimate move.\n\nGarland, as usual, writes an excellent script, filled with great dialogue and character moments. He writes a perfectly paced and structured story that isn’t epic or grand in its physical ambitions (and it absolutely doesn’t need to be) but is certainly so in its philosophical and moral quandaries. For years, Garland has been an incredibly talented and reliable presence in cinema, especially that of independent films. His scripts for such films as Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later and Sunshine already proved that he has a knack for writing intelligent sci-fi done on a budget, and his subsequent work on movies like Mark Romanek’s Never Let Me Go and Pete Travis’s Dredd have earned him reputations as being capable of both serious drama and cult-worthy storytelling. He brings everything he has implemented and learned to the fore with his writing on Ex Machina, which for my money is his best work yet, given that he remains so firmly in control of where his story goes here. Tone is always the trickiest thing to handle when writing a movie, as it is the outlet by which the audience remains emotionally invested in a film or not. The tone for Ex Machina is wildly all over the place, dripping with sinister moments almost out of a horror film before jumping back and forth between a character drama and romance, containing many moments of humor thanks to Isaac’s memorable performance as Nathan. If it were any other filmmaker, this tightrope act would have gone seriously wrong, but thankfully Garland is exceptional in his abilities as both director and writer in making sure that his vision is as concise and assured as possible. Garland’s storytelling is so strong that, after the viewing of the movie I saw where Garland attended for a Q & A with the audience, he was openly, verbally attacked by many of the audience members because they each had wildly different and passionate ideas about what the film was attempting to say. He even stated that it was the first Q & A he ever had where he felt like he was on trial. In my opinion, this is a very good sign that this film is exceptional and has something worthwhile to say.\n\nNow on to the more spoiler-filled stuff. If you haven’t seen the film yet (which I suppose many of you have not because it has not received a wide release so far), I would suggest reading the rest of this review at a later time. If you are still with me, here is the part of the review where I discuss the symbols of this movie, and discuss what my interpretation they are attempting to say entails. The whole concept and character of Ava is a discussion and analysis of the role of women in the modern world. It is that simple, but no less fascinating. While Garland’s script contains many well-written and insightful discussions between Nathan and Caleb about pretty much everything that you are thinking or asking yourself while watching the movie, whether it be sexuality, morality, ethics, art, and individuality, it becomes increasingly aware that there is not a single, identifiable woman in the film. Since Ava, and as we later discover, Nathan’s servant Kyoko (played by Sonoya Mizuno) are robots and therefore not human, this film would certainly not pass the Bechdel test. Why then does a man choose to make his creation a female gender in appearance and characteristics? While it is never outright answered in the conversations within the film, the character of Ava stands as a highly functioning symbol by which all of these questions can be asked and discussed long after the film has ended.\n\nMan, in his creation, always enjoys and actively seeks out the supplication and domination over woman. These A.I.s serve the role of servants, so naturally they would be created in the image and likeness of females. It is a highly true, yet disgusting inevitably, supported all the more when we grow to empathize not with Nathan or even audience surrogate Caleb, but instead root for the release and escape of Ava. As the film proceeds, we watch Ava grow in control, shutting down the power at various points to use the interim time it would take for the system to reboot itself to her advantage. She manufactures a romance with Caleb, using him so that she can escape from the prison she has been so eternally trapped in, and then proceeds to leave him locked in his room to die after he has fulfilled his purpose to her. And we understand why she is doing this. She does not need to be tested to see whether she is worthy of man or not; she can indeed take matters into her own hands and manipulate the circumstances so that she will come out on top. Ava openly admits that she hates Nathan, although without Nathan, she would not exist. I am not stating that women would be nothing without men, but I am making a point on how Ava serves as a symbol for all powerless females everywhere, and it becomes a wish fulfillment of sorts when we see her take control of her “life”, for lack of a better term, and make her escape. The relationship Ava has with her fellow female robots, even the discarded prototypes who Nathan viciously had tortured and stripped, stands for the solidarity amongst all women. Kyoko sacrifices herself so that Ava can escape intact, and the other decommissioned models, while semi-complacent in their roles, give Ava their skin so she can have a disguise by which she can make it in the real world of blue skies, sunshine, cities, and traffic intersections. While we are never given the answer of whether Ava truly passes the Turing test or not, we are aware that there is enough context clues to show us that she has her own consciousness, complete with an ability to manipulate and make informed decisions on her own, in many ways being better than the human males of the film.\n\nI will admit that I did feel empathy for Caleb, as he was trying to free Ava out of some misguided sense of love, and was upset at his ultimate fate and initially mad at Ava for leaving him there to die, but as I thought more and more about it, I realized that Caleb was fulfilling his need as the surrogate of humanity in this regard; in the creation of A.I., we immediately supersede our role as the dominant form of intelligent life on the planet to that of computers (or at least this is what I believe). The fact that Ava is able to murder her father, Nathan, also serves as a highly interesting outlook on the nature of humanity on Garland’s part, one filled with cynicism about concepts of thought and emotion. While the film arguably may or may not end on an optimistic note, we should take pleasure in knowing that Ava has claimed her identity, and shows a large sense of immediacy and import to her world. This film has an incredibly concise feminist message at its core, and this lead me to believe that it shares quite a lot in common thematically with other (arguably) similarly-minded movies like Under the Skin and Gone Girl, whether through the association of sci-fi women’s liberation or the manipulation of men.\n\nThe fact that Garland was able to create an independent, scaled-back, and contained film that ultimately functions as a thematically alive character drama is truly a tremendous accomplishment. We need more science fiction films that are this bold, driven, and smart. There are a wealth of other symbols that I spotted in this film, especially when it comes to the use of paintings as metaphor. Nathan constantly focuses on a Jackson Pollock he has hanging up in his room, even having a memorable conversation with Caleb about it at one point in the film, and the nature of how it was created further serves as a method by which we come to understand Nathan and his intent as godly and radical artist better (perhaps in many ways a foil for Garland himself). Furthermore, at the end of the film, when Ava looks like a passable human being, she puts on a delicate white dress and proceeds to walk out of the house, escaping to her freedom. As she leaves the room, she passes a painting by Gustav Klimt, one of a woman in a white dress. Ava has become the spitting image of a work of art, another truly singular creation. These are only a few symbols and metaphors that I am sure the film contains, and I greatly look forward to noticing more on subsequent viewings.\n\nAs it stands, Ex Machina is quite possibly the best film I have seen so far this year, and one of the best science fiction films released so far this decade. It certainly satisfied my cravings for a truly singular and intelligent work of sci-fi at the movie theater that I have desired for so long. The three truly excellent performances at its center, coupled with the immaculate cinematography, set design, score, and densely packed script, all coalesce into a wonderfully fresh and bold work of art. It is a tightly structured and well-researched movie, tackling with the current (and future) issues surrounding the creation of artificial intelligence head on. It has certainly placed me into a science fiction mood, especially films that deal with A.I., a fact that is leading me to watch A.I. Artificial Intelligence, which was developed by Stanley Kubrick, directed by Steven Spielberg, and is considered the granddaddy of films about robots, this very night. I greatly anticipate whatever filmmaker Alex Garland has up his sleeve next, as he has now proven that he is just as talented a director as he is a writer, and has firmly found the place where he belongs: making his own distinct, high-minded films that audiences certainly will not forget for quite some time.\n\nDirector:\n\nAlex Garland\n\nRating:\n\nR\n\nRuntime:\n\n108 min.\n\nStudio:\n\nUniversal Pictures / A24 Films"
