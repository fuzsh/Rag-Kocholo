        "text": "It’s hard to find a place in London that hasn’t featured in a film. From the sweeping city skyline to the side streets, the UK capital has starred in countless movies and TV shows. I love stumbling across spots that have appeared on the silver screen. If you’re the same, today I bring you A Lady in London’s guide to 15 film locations in London.\n\nFilm Locations in London\n\nThis list includes my favorite London film locations, but there are so many more that I could fill an entire blog with them. I hope they inspire you to re-watch your most loved London films and get out to explore where they were shot.\n\nIf you’re like me, you might even stumble upon live filming in London. I once watched John Krasinski run along the top of Somerset House as he acted in scenes for Jack Ryan. It’s always exciting to see the action in progress.\n\n1. Notting Hill Film Locations\n\nNotting Hill is one of my favorite film locations in London, not least because its streets and shops look so pretty on screen.\n\nI love all the scenes in the movie Notting Hill, from the ones shot in Portobello Market to the ones outside the house with the blue door at 280 Westbourne Park Road.\n\nAnd that’s to say nothing of the bookshop on Blenheim Crescent, which I still love popping into when I’m in the neighborhood.\n\n2. Waterloo Station Film Locations\n\nWaterloo station is another classic London film location. My favorite movie shot here is The Bourne Ultimatum.\n\nThe scene where Matt Damon’s character tries to help someone exit the station without being shot by snipers is one of the most suspenseful in all the Bourne films. Even now I can’t walk through Waterloo without thinking about it.\n\n3. Leadenhall Market Film Locations\n\nAnother of my favorite film locations in London is Leadenhall Market. This beauty in the City of London is famous for being Diagon Alley in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.\n\nThe entrance to the Leaky Cauldron, the famous wizard’s pub that leads to Diagon Alley, was also filmed in Bull’s Head Passage in Leadenhall Market.\n\nIf you want to see more Harry Potter filming locations in London, you can do my free self-guided Harry Potter walk. It will take you to places like St Paul’s Cathedral, the Millennium Bridge, Borough Market, and more.\n\n4. MI6 Film Locations\n\nBack to action movies, the MI6 Building in Vauxhall features in the James Bond films. The headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service is famously blown up in Skyfall as Judi Dench’s character, M, watches from a distance.\n\nThe exterior of the building also features in GoldenEye, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, and Spectre. It’s one of the more popular filming locations in London for James Bond movies, and for good reason.\n\n5. Hatton Garden Film Locations\n\nOn the other side of the law, Hatton Garden has featured in a number of crime films. The Ye Olde Mitre pub featured in the Guy Ritchie movie Snatch, and is one of the easy-to-visit film locations in London.\n\nThe streets in and around the famous diamond district appear in The Hatton Garden Job, a true story of the 2015 burglary of nearly £200 million from the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company by four elderly men.\n\n6. South Bank Film Locations\n\nLondon’s South Bank has been used in countless movies, and is one of the most memorable filming locations in London. The bonding scene between Liam Neeson’s character and his on-screen stepson, Sam, in Love Actually is one of my favorites.\n\nOther memorable scenes shot on the South Bank include ones from Four Weddings and a Funeral, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Closer.\n\n7. Westminster Bridge Film Locations\n\nJust off the South Bank, Westminster Bridge is another of the most famous film locations in London. This bridge has Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament in the background, making it a classic London setting.\n\nIt’s been the London filming location for movies like 28 Days Later and the James Bond film Spectre, where Blofeld’s helicopter crashes into the bridge after being shot down by Bond.\n\n8. Borough Market Film Locations\n\nBorough Market is not only one of my favorite markets in the UK capital, but also one of the most memorable filming locations in London.\n\nThis area serves as the site of Bridget Jones’s home in Bridget Jones’s Diary. Her flat is situated above The Globe Tavern in Bedale Street, and many of the scenes in the movie were filmed in streets and buildings in the surrounding area.\n\n9. Trafalgar Square Film Locations\n\nTrafalgar Square is not only an iconic site, but also a filming location in London for a number of classic movies. The square was used for VE Day celebrations in Captain America: The First Avenger.\n\nIt also featured in mob scenes at the apex of V For Vendetta. A crowd marches through the square before going to destroy the Houses of Parliament.\n\n10. The Tube as a Film Location in London\n\nThe tube has featured in countless movies, and is one of the most iconic film locations in London.\n\nSkyfall and The Bourne Ultimatum both include tense sequences set in the Underground, and the entire plot of the Gwyneth Paltrow classic Sliding Doors hinges on whether she makes it into a tube carriage as the doors are closing.\n\nThe futuristic Canary Wharf tube station also features in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and the abandoned Aldwych Tube Station serves as a filming location for many movies.\n\n11. London Mews Film Locations\n\nI love a good London mews, and thankfully so do a lot of location scouts. These pretty streets are used as filming locations in London for a lot of movies and TV shows.\n\nThe pink house in St Luke’s Mews in Notting Hill features as Keira Knightley’s character’s home in Love Actually, and the house at the end of Stanhope Mews South in South Kensington is Harry’s house in Kingsman: The Secret Service. Holland Park Mews is also used in an episode of The Crown.\n\n12. Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich\n\nThe Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich is one of the most beautiful film locations in London. The stunning interiors make it perfect for period dramas, royal films, and wedding specials.\n\nThe Old Royal Naval College has been used in everything from Cinderella to The King’s Speech, The Duchess, The Queen, and Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\n13. Temple Church Film Locations\n\nThe 12th-century Temple Church is not only one of London’s most historic religious buildings, but also a film location for The Da Vinci Code.\n\nThis is where Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu come to try to solve a riddle, believing that the the stone effigies of the Knights Templar will help them do it.\n\n14. Hampstead Film Locations\n\nHampstead is my favorite London neighborhood, and it’s been used as a film location in London for a lot of movies.\n\nKenwood House in Hampstead Heath stars in Notting Hill when Julia Roberts’ character acts in a Henry James adaptation. The nearby bathing ponds feature in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\n\nScenes from the film Hampstead were also shot on Flask Walk, Hampstead High Street, Church Row, and Perrin’s Court.\n\n15. King’s Cross Station Film Locations\n\nKing’s Cross station is one of the most beloved film locations in London, not least because it’s the home of Platform 9 3/4 from the Harry Potter films.\n\nThis fictional platform has been made a reality, and visitors and locals alike can pose for photos with a baggage trolley disappearing through the wall of the station into the fantasy world of the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nFilm Locations in London\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed seeing some of the places these classic London movies were shot.\n\nThere are so many amazing film locations in London that you can keep exploring them for a long time to come. I can’t wait to see what movies are filmed in the city next.\n\nFind this post helpful? Buy me a coffee!\n\nNew here? Join thousands of others and subscribe to the A Lady in London blog via email."
