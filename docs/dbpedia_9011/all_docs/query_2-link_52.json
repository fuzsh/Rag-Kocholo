Executive Summary In the beginning, our group had sixteen possible topics, but we narrowed them down to just four for milestone one. We agreed as a group that we wanted to learn more about eating disorders – specifically in the United States, and so we chose that as our final topic in milestone two. We did a lot of research on the topic for milestone three and found that eating disorders are more likely to affect women than men. We learned that eating disorders in the United States affect women (as well as men) of every race, age and walk of life. For milestone four, our group analyzed the problem in more depth and learned that eating disorders aren’t always about food and appearance – sometimes they are about deeper issues linked to control and abuse. We also realized that eating disorders have a very long history, but they have only recently (in the last century) been recognized as an illness. For milestone five, our group began to prepare for possible solutions by creating decision criteria. It was important to our group that all possible solutions consider the greatest number of those involved, be legal and within moral reason, and respect an individual’s basic human rights. We also agreed that eating disorders, based on the research we did, are not curable and therefore any solution we came up with would need to be flexible and enduring. Some of the solutions we came up with for milestone six were to avoid criticizing others, know when to admit that one has a problem, change through mass media and education as a solution. All four of those solutions met with our decision criteria in milestone seven, but we decided for milestone eight that we would go with education as our solution.\n\n4. Milestone One – List of Topics Originally our group came up with sixteen possible topics, but we worked together and narrowed them down to these four: • The affects of bullying on adolescents • Animal Cruelty • Tobacco usage disagreements on college campuses • The Prevalence of eating disorders in the United States http://mrg.bz/Tee2dZ\n\n5. Milestone Two – Finalized Topic • There is a large prevalence of eating disorders among women in the United States. • We chose eating disorders as our final topic because it is something we feel is an ongoing issue in our society. The feedback from our group members was very enthusiastic surrounding this topic and all members appeared to be interested in working on it together. We also felt that this is an issue that we would enjoy working on finding a solution for, or rather finding a plan for improvement. http://mrg.bz/fHo09l\n\n6. Milestone Three – Research on Topic No matter your race, ethnicity, age or culture – eating disorders are extremely common amongst women in today’s society. The six sources listed on the next slide all share common information regarding the problem, and the bottom line is that the problem doesn’t discriminate. The following sources dive deeper into the matters surrounding eating disorders. Depression, social disorder, family issues, and trauma are just some of the issues discussed alongside eating disorders. There are many psychological factors involved with eating disorders, and it is crucial as a society we are aware and educated of what nearly half of all women today are going through.\n\n7.

Milestone Four – Problem Analysis Eating Disorders cause extreme emotions and behaviors, and often cause life time threatening illnesses for females and males. Our environment, culture, genetics, and psychology are the common factors that contribute to an individual that has an eating disorder. Society’s standards, media’s motivation on thinness, and a heightened importance on appearance, are all environmental factors that lead to complex eating behaviors. Genetics have a substantial contribution and may pre dispose individuals to eating disorders; many do not choose to have an eating disorder. (Lifeline, 2015.) Self-esteem issues, hopelessness, impulsivity, and anxiety, are what we as a society, associate with an eating disorder. The problem that needs to be stressed is that an eating disorder doesn’t always necessarily mean there is an issue with food. It is a coping method and an outlet for an individual that has trouble handling their real mental health issue. They feel binge eating and/or throwing up is a comfort and rely on that feeling to justify for their inner problem. Support groups and hotlines are available for not only the suffering individual, but their family members who are actively involved.\n\n9. Milestone Four – Problem Analysis (continued) There are many different stakeholders involved in the prevalence of eating disorders in the United States. These stakeholders include specific organizations and institutions involved in defeating and easing the strain of this disorder but they generally include hospitals, schools, psychological services, and everyone in society in a way. As a society, eating disorders are sometimes viewed as a deficiency or shameful. Generally speaking, most of the stakeholders in the prevalence of eating disorders view society’s representation of the “ideal body” as the root of eating disorders combined with different psychological factors. \"Corset1878taille46 300gram\" by Anonymous - second-hand source: Le Corset by Libron. 1933.

Milestone Four – Problem Analysis (History) In 1873 a personal physician to Queen Victoria, Sir William Gull, coined the term anorexia nervosa when he published a paper on the subject. Having Greek origin, the term anorexia nervosa translates to a nervous loss of appetite, which has since been determined as inaccurate in relation to the illness. The earliest proposed examples of anorexia are seen in the religious fasting that exclusively women and young girls would undergo during the Hellenistic through Medieval periods for purification. This form of anorexia has also been termed anorexia mirabilis, a term that translates to miraculous lack of appetite and is disputed in its correlation to anorexia nervosa by some religious entities and medical professionals. The earliest accepted work in anorexia nervosa however is by the physician Richard Morton, who in 1689 published a paper detailing a number of illness that were at the time otherwise ignored by doctors despite contributing to over 18% of deaths in London. The paper recognized an illness then known as the wasting condition, which would later be named anorexia nervosa by Sir William Gull.\n\n11. Milestone Four – Problem Analysis (History - continued) Anorexia nervosa is just one facet under the complex umbrella of eating disorders. Bulimia nervosa is anorexia’s sister and ties as the top eating disorders within the variety of related illnesses. Characterized as a binge / purge process, bulimia nervosa was first recognized in 1979. Despite its more recent recognition, the behavior is thought to have been an element in many ancient cultures as well. One such example is found in ancient Egyptian culture where the practice of purging was considered part of a balanced health routine and recommended once a month for three days. Ancient Romans of elite status also practiced purging before banquet parties where large amounts of food would be consumed. http://mrg.bz/BiTY6G\n\n12.

Milestone Five – Decision Criteria • Solutions to the problem must consider all involved and attempt to satisfy the greatest number of those involved. • Solutions to the problem must be legal and within moral reason. • Solutions to the problem may not impede on an individual’s basic human rights. • Understanding the problem (eating disorders) is not a curable illness, the solution to the problem may not necessarily be an end-all solution to the problem, so the solution must be flexible and one that is enduring.\n\n14. Milestone Six – Brainstorm Solutions • Avoid criticizing others' food choices and diet patterns. If you are concerned with a friend or family member's diet, focus on encouraging healthy habits such as choosing foods with a high nutritional value and adequate portion sizes rather than directly addressing the person's problem. • Mass media (and entities like the fashion industry) on an international level should take a look at France’s recent move toward addressing their role in eating disorders. Media intentionally aims to sway public opinion on matters and has an ethical responsibility in the messages it spreads. Recognizing this factor, the media could take great strides in redefining acceptable body image, especially for women and young girls. • Admitting one has a problem as well as knowing how to ask for help. If the person is unable to recognize their problem then they won't be able to effectively receive treatment. By admitting they have a problem then they will be more motivated to ask for help. • Education as a solution - all-encompassing in a variety of solutions. By proposing that we implement required curriculum in high schools and colleges (like in Health Ed classes), it would gain media attention and help students (young and old) understand the prevention and treatment of eating disorders. It would build general public awareness and overtime change society’s opinion on the matter. Recovering women (and men) that have dealt and coped with an eating disorder could also give seminars at schools.\n\n15. Milestone Seven – Analyze Solutions We considered all four of our possible solutions against our decision criteria and found that all the solutions were in keeping with our set guidelines. Considers all involved Legal and within moral reason Respects basic human rights Flexible and enduring\n\n16. Milestone Eight – Choose a Solution • We choose education as a solution to the social issue of eating disorders. Our plan is to implement preventative information about eating disorders in public schools and colleges as part of the required curriculum. • We feel that this solution is the best choice because it is all-encompassing in all of our solutions. Education is something that can reach people of all ages, across a variety of walks of life. Through education, we can target young women and men at a crucial age when they are most at risk of developing an eating disorder. Equipping the public with more information about eating disorders will aid individuals in determining whether or not their loved ones have an eating disorder, and how to handle the illness when they are able to confirm it. Education will provide a general awareness of eating disorders associated with a negative attachment, which may help eradicate the issue from our culture. • In order to create awareness and implement education around eating disorders, we feel it would be an asset to have guest speakers who have suffered from this disease at schools, starting in Junior High. Schools will be provided with detailed curriculum regarding the dissemination of information about eating disorders. Students will be taught why it is important to steer clear of eating disorders, that thinness is not above health, how to spot eating disorders in their loved ones and how to handle it when they know someone is suffering (how to get them help and how not to make the situation worse).\n\n17. Group Correspondence • Our group chose to communicate outside of blackboard on Facebook. We created a group page that was closed to Ohio University students only and there is where we discussed the details of each milestone. Below are some examples of our dialogue."
