His Wife and Her Lover, the wife, Georgina,\n\nurges her husband, the thief Spica, to eat her lover,\n\ngrandiosely roasted at her direction by the cook. The\n\npatrons and employees of Le Hollandais restaurant, where\n\nthe film is set, led by those characters most abused by the\n\nboorish and cruel Spica, watch in fascination as a fork\n\nmoves hesitantly toward the lover's baked penis. Georgina,\n\nthe most tormented character, revenges herself by\n\nthreatening to gun Spica down if he refuses to eat. When\n\nhe succumbs and consumes, she calls him a cannibal and\n\nshoots him dead.\n\nThe scene is remarkable in several respects.\n\nVisually, its elements are stunning and excessive.\n\nGeorgina's cage-like black gown with its long train—\n\ndesigned, like all the costumes, by Jean-Paul Gaultier—\n\nparodies a wedding dress; she stalks the dining room like a\n\nhaute couture Miss Havisham, her bereavement inspiring\n\nunusual behavior. The other characters sport less\n\nelaborate, but no less peculiar, color-coded fashions and\n\nare arranged to invoke the compositions of Dutch paintings.\n\nTheir elegant clothes and coiffures contrast with the\n\nmedical equipment— bandages, crutches, a wheelchair— which\n\n2\n\nare the marks of Spica's physical abuse. Astonishing, in a\n\nmainstream film, is the extended male frontal nudity of the\n\nlover. The fact that this character is dead and baked may\n\nor may not make this nudity more surprising.\n\nThe true disruption of the scene resides not in the\n\nexposure of the actor, but in the transgressive moment of\n\ncannibalism— perhaps the ultimate crisis of consumption.\n\nThis scene is the paradigmatic moment in a film obsessed\n\nwith appropriate and inappropriate consumption. What\n\nshould be put into the body, the film asks, and what should\n\nnot? Punishment takes the form of forced consumption— of\n\ndog shit, buttons, books, kitchen utensils, and human\n\nflesh. Pleasure, on the other hand, does not necessarily\n\ncorrelate with appropriate consumption. Despite the fact\n\nthat the film is set in a fancy restaurant, no one has a\n\nsatisfying meal; characters sneak off to the kitchen and\n\nthe bathroom to enjoy themselves. Only the production of a\n\nmeal or its expulsion can satisfy.\n\nWhile these concerns with production and expulsion—\n\nwith a corollary anxiety about the act of consumption\n\nitself— are features of what has come to be called\n\npostmodernism, they suggest another contemporary crisis of\n\nconsumption: the eating disorders anorexia nervosa (self-\n\nstarvation) and bulimia (bingeing and purging). The\n\nvictims of these disorders ask the same questions: what\n\nshould be put into the body and what should not? Like the\n\ncharacters in The Cook, the Thief, anorectics and bulimics\n\nare described as having \"an intense preoccupation with\n\nfood, which may result in bizarre patterns of behavior\n\nrelated to food preparation and consumption\" (Kennedy,\n\nGarfinkel 76). Although anorexia nervosa was first named\n\nby Sir William Gull in 1874, and has been retrospectively\n\ndeduced back to the Middle Ages, its incidence, or its\n\nrecognition, has more than doubled in the past 2 0 years\n\n(Kennedy, Garfinkel 75). The contemporary prevalence of\n\nthis psychiatric illness along with the specific female\n\ngendering of its victims— approximately 95 percent (Walker,\n\nBrown 17)— make it a frustrating and provocative object of\n\nstudy. These factors invite an analysis which would place\n\nthe syndrome in an historical, cultural perspective.\n\nAside from its actual clinical picture, anorexia\n\nnervosa and bulimia provide a metaphor for a society\n\nobsessed with consumption. Hilde Bruch begins Eating\n\nDisorders: Obesity. Anorexia Nervosa and the Person Within\n\nby noting: \"There is no human society that deals\n\nrationally with food in its environment, that eats\n\naccording to the availability, edibility, and nutritional\n\nvalue alone\" (3). The word hunger is used \"as a symbolic\n\nexpression of a state of need in general, or a simile for\n\nwant in other areas\" (47). One of those areas, the one\n\n4\n\nwith which this study will deal, is the cultural. We can\n\nspeak of the production, consumption and even expulsion of\n\nart. This analysis argues that the metaphors arising out\n\nof the central fact of eating can be extended; the function\n\nof eating disorders and distortions can usefully discuss a\n\ncrisis of artistic production.\n\nWith the term bulimic cinema, I refer not to the very\n\nreal afflictions of anorexia and bulimia, but to a set of\n\ninterrelated factors associated with the characteristics of\n\neating disorders. The bulimic text is: taxonomic rather\n\nthan unified; without borders or limits rather than\n\ndiscrete; created by conspiracy rather than the Author/God;\n\nresistant to judgment rather than interpretable; excessive\n\nrather than moderate; a destruction rather than an\n\nimmortalization; a murder without a solution. These\n\nqualities can be used as a framework to discuss a wide\n\nrange of cultural production: avant-garde, experimental or\n\nalternative texts; more conventional, widely distributed\n\nart cinema; texts which don't address issues of consumption\n\nexplicitly, but which use consumption metaphorically; and\n\ntexts which directly consider eating, food or digestion.\n\nTo varying degrees, Greenaway's work has operated in\n\neach of these categories. Cinema and video, in which\n\nGreenaway has produced his most compelling work, are the\n\nsites of the bulimic text. His work reiterates a familiar\n\n5\n\nobservation: that cinema is capable of consuming the other\n\narts. Other media— such as painting, the medium in which\n\nGreenaway first worked— are vulnerable to cinema's\n\nincorporation. Because of its history of production and\n\ndistribution, cinema, whatever its current manifestations,\n\nis associated with mass consumption by a mass audience.\n\nCinema and video, in their reliance on the image (above the\n\nword, logos), foreground the material nature of the\n\nartwork.\n\nGreenaway's films are also an apt field for an\n\nanalysis based on eating disorders because of his thematic\n\nand formal concerns. His films frequently raise questions\n\nassociated with the consumable nature of the medium: What\n\nhappens to the artist when the art work becomes a\n\nconsumable object? What should go in the film and what\n\nshould be rejected? Who controls the work of art? What is\n\nthe significance of the filmic organization? What is the\n\nnature of the filmic body?\n\nGreenaway's concern with consumption is frequently\n\nimplicit, but just as frequently right on the surface. The\n\nCook. the Thief takes place almost solely in a restaurant;\n\nthe only detour takes the viewer to a biblioteque— a\n\nlocation presented as superior to the restaurant, a place\n\nwhere the mind can feed. These settings announce a concern\n\nwith consumption on the part of the film's characters which\n\n6\n\ncan be seen in many Greenaway films: The Draughtsman's\n\nContract begins at a meal and ends when a character bites\n\ninto a pineapple; in A Zed and Two Noughts a character is\n\nforced to eat a rotted prawn and ultimately the two main\n\ncharacters will be left dead in a field experiment to be\n\neaten by maggots, worms and snails; Bellv of an Architect\n\nhas a long scene of restaurant feasting at the beginning\n\nand a long scene of the same restaurant's destruction at\n\nthe end; Drowning by Numbers shows a woman being sexually\n\naroused by a popsicle. While this thematic concern with\n\nconsumption exists on a character and plot level, it is not\n\nthe characters who are anorectic or bulimic. Rather I\n\nwould argue that the features of anorexia nervosa and\n\nbulimia help us to understand how Greenaway's texts\n\nthemselves— which fluctuate between starvation (minimalism,\n\nstructuralism) and gluttony (excess plot, visuals)—\n\noperate. These films, like so many postmodern art objects,\n\nare stuffed with references and allusions which they cannot\n\ndigest. In Greenaway's work, the female body, the most\n\ncommon site of anorexia nervosa and bulimia, is replaced by\n\nthe body of an artist's work.\n\nIn Illness As Metaphor Susan Sontag analyzes the\n\nmetaphoric employment of tuberculosis and cancer and\n\nsuggests that it may not be \"morally permissible\" to use a\n\nfatal illness in a metaphoric sense.\n\nSince the interest of the metaphor is\n\nprecisely that it refers to a disease\n\n[cancer] so overlaid with mystification, so\n\ncharged with the fantasy of inescapable\n\nfatality. Since our views about cancer,\n\nand the metaphors we have imposed on it,\n\nare so much a vehicle for the large\n\ninsufficiencies of this culture, for our\n\nshallow attitude toward death, for our\n\nanxieties about feeling, for our reckless\n\nimprovident responses to our real \"problems\n\nof growth,\" for our inability to construct\n\nan advanced industrial society which\n\nproperly regulates consumption, and for our\n\njustified fears of the increasingly violent\n\ncourse of history. (84)\n\nSontag implies that metaphor is connected to fantasy\n\nor frivolity and somehow removed from everyday life, that\n\nmetaphoric intervention fosters \"a shallow attitude\" which\n\nkeeps us from knowing things as they are. For Sontag,\n\nmetaphor may lead to anxiety, recklessness and the\n\ninability to think clearly. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson\n\nchallenge this view of metaphoric thought by arguing that\n\n\"metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in\n\nlanguage but in thought and action\" (Metaphors We Live Bv\n\n3). Orientational metaphors, ontological metaphors, and\n\nstructural metaphors form coherent conceptual systems and\n\narise physiologically as well as culturally. In this view,\n\nmetaphoric concepts \"structure what we perceive\" and \"play\n\na central role in defining our everyday realities.\" We can\n\nidentify the systemic coherence of the illness as\n\nconsumption metaphor in Sontag's account; she observes that\n\ncancer was, without medical basis, thought of as consuming.\n\n8\n\nThe metaphorically perceived function of disease extends\n\nbeyond what is actually known about a particular illness to\n\nstructure thought about all illness.\n\nIn this application, consuming is read negatively as\n\nan action contained within but uncontrolled by the body.\n\nThis reading is consistent with the structural metaphor of\n\nconsuming as it applies to activities from eating to\n\nbuying. The food and eating basis of the \"consumer\" in\n\nconsumer culture structures our perception of the concept.\n\nThe expressions \"I can swallow that\" and \"I'11 buy that\"\n\nboth imply acceptance or acquiescence. Discomfort and\n\nanxiety about eating translates into similar attitudes\n\ntowards material accumulation and, as we have seen, is\n\nassigned to other phenomena, such as disease, which are\n\nassociated with the compromise of the body, lack of\n\npersonal control and mortality. In The Denial of Death.\n\nErnest Becker makes this connection in a discussion of\n\nanality. Of the product of consumption, Becker says:\n\n\"Excreting is the curse that threatens madness because it\n\nshows man his abject finitude, his physicalness, the likely\n\nunreality of his hopes and dreams\" (33). Human knowledge\n\nis always ultimately a knowledge of mortality— a knowledge\n\nwhich at its limit becomes associated with another kind of\n\neating: \"What does it mean to be a self-conscious animal?\n\nThe idea is ludicrous, if it is not monstrous. It means to\n\n9\n\nknow that one is food for worms\" (Becker 87). The final\n\ndisposition of bodies— drowned in rivers, buried in\n\ncemeteries, thrown in moats, eaten by worms, of course, and\n\neven by human characters— is a prevalent theme in\n\nGreenaway's work. This thematic obsession is inseparable\n\nfrom the way in which the consumer in \"consumer society\"\n\nfunctions metaphorically.\n\nThe metaphoric function of their disease is fully\n\nrecognized by many anorectic and bulimic patients, often in\n\ntheir reaction to treatment. The therapist can propose an\n\ninterpretation which the patient may \"swallow\":\n\nThe contents would be good; they would be\n\nexpected to convey pleasure and interest.\n\nBut there would be a fury, too. The\n\ncontents were not to be refused. The\n\npleasure would be inflicted. Imposed\n\npleasure!. . . Then I imagined this all\n\nturning upside down and backside front.\n\nNow Ms. F. would switch her identification\n\nfrom the projector of food-cum-truth-\n\npleasure into a fellow feeling with the\n\nrecipient of this infliction. How awful to\n\nbe forcefed— how helpless, how humiliating,\n\nlike the victim of a rape. (Boris 105)\n\nIn this case, the patient reduces the interpretation\n\nmetaphorically to the food which she has persistently\n\nrefused; she must refuse the interpretation as well. R.D.\n\nLaing recognizes this anxiety and refusal in other cases of\n\npsychotherapy and uses a variation of the same metaphor:\n\n\"To be understood correctly is to be engulfed, to be\n\nenclosed, swallowed up, drowned, eaten up, smothered,\n\n10\n\nstifled in or by another person's all-embracing\n\ncomprehension” (Laing 45) . The strange resoluteness of\n\nanorexia nervosa and bulimia patients which obscures\n\ndiagnosis and frustrates treatment is an often noted\n\nfeature of the disease. Although the anorectic may\n\noutwardly agree with her therapist— may even appear to\n\ncomply with the diagnosis and treatment plan— with\n\nintractable deception and resolution, she will persistently\n\nnot eat. In their symbolic refusal, these patients are\n\nfrequently described as \"recalcitrant” (Boris 89).\n\nThe metaphoric function of eating disorders can be\n\ncompared to another malady primarily ascribed to women:\n\nhysteria, which has been particularly resonant in\n\ntheorizing melodrama. The application of this psychiatric\n\ncategory to film is based on Freud's description of\n\nconversion hysteria \"in which the psychical conflict is\n\nexpressed symbolically in somatic symptoms of the most\n\nvaried kinds\" (Laplanche, Pontalis 194). Laplanche and\n\nPontalis' description stresses the economic and symbolic\n\naspects of this process: \"through bodily symptoms,\n\nrepressed ideas 'join in the conversation,' although they\n\nare distorted by the mechanisms of condensation and\n\ndisplacement\" (Laplanche, Pontalis 90). The excess\n\nlibidinal energy which cannot be expressed verbally is\n\n11\n\ntranslated into the body. The body \"join[s] in the\n\nconversation,\" speaking what the mouth cannot utter.\n\nGeoffrey Nowell-Smith locates this process in the body\n\nof the melodramatic film text. As these films strive for\n\nrealism and a happy resolution, they generate an excess\n\nwhich \"cannot be accommodated within the action\" (73).\n\nMusic and mise-en-scene substitute for the emotionality\n\nthat the plot cannot convey. \"It is not just that the\n\ncharacters are often prone to hysteria, but that the film\n\nitself somatizes its own unaccommodated excess ...\" (74).\n\nThe film speaks indirectly, with its body so-to-speak, what\n\ncannot be said directly through the plot or characters.\n\nIn a chapter that deals principally with characters\n\nwithin films that feature a medical discourse, Mary Ann\n\nDoane also argues that \"the logic of the symptom might be\n\nused to read the film texts differently\" (44). Doane,\n\nhowever, presents a more critical perspective on the\n\n\"association, within patriarchal configurations, of\n\nfemininity with the pathological\" (38). Despite the fact\n\nthat men can suffer from hysteria, the syndrome, beginning\n\nwith its name, is read as feminine and links femininity\n\nand aberrance. Doane locates the site of this association\n\nin the woman's body. \"Represented as possessing a body\n\nwhich is overpresent, unavoidable, in constant sympathy\n\nwith the emotional and mental faculties, the woman resides\n\n12\n\njust: outside the boundaries of the problematic wherein\n\nWestern culture operates a mind/body dualism\" (39). The\n\neffect of the ensuing hysteria is a doubled relationship to\n\nnarrativity, \"in its relation to its cause (excessive\n\ndaydreaming) and its treatment (the 'talking cure')\" (66).\n\nThe solution to the body's participation in the\n\nconversation lies in the discourse of confession. In\n\nDoane's conception, the female spectator must give up\n\nidentification with the ill body (female) and take up\n\nidentification with the knowledgeable doctor (male).\n\nThis crucial moment of treatment is one of the points\n\nat which eating disorders differ greatly from hysteria.\n\nThe hysterical patient allies herself with the doctor to\n\nspeak her cure; the \"recalcitrant\" anorectic patient\n\nrefuses to swallow food, advice or interpretation and\n\nthereby refuses to be swallowed/understood.\n\nIn my theoretical application of anorexia and bulimia,\n\nI will argue that eating disorders provide a better model\n\nfor contemporary film than hysteria. The shift from\n\nhysteria to bulimia is compatible with what Brian MacHale\n\nhas mapped as the shift from the epistemology of modernism\n\nto the ontology of postmodernism. MacHale argues for the\n\ndetective genre as the genre par excellence of modernism.\n\nFreud, in his persistent analysis of clues and obdurate\n\ndetermination to solve the case, acts as a detective. In\n\nher discussion of medical discourse films, Doane notes:\n\n\"most of these films situate the psychoanalyst as a kind of\n\nepistemological hero, as the guarantor of the final\n\nemergence of truth. . .\" (47). The description,\n\ntreatment, indeed the possibility of hysteria depends on a\n\ntruth about the symptoms which can be known. When the\n\npatient knows what the doctor has discovered— when they\n\nknow together— the cure has been affected, the case has\n\nbeen solved. This strategy, as noted above, has been\n\nsingularly ineffective in treating eating disorders. The\n\ndoctor can not simply persuade the patient to adopt his or\n\nher knowledge. Bruch critiques what she calls \"outmoded\n\nconcepts of psychoanalytic treatment\" which are applied to\n\nanorexia and bulimia:\n\nMany [therapists] stress the symbolic\n\nmeaning of the non-eating and the\n\nunderlying unconscious problems, fantasies,\n\nand dreams, and interpret their unconscious\n\nmeaning to the patient. When the\n\ntraditional psychoanalytic setting is\n\nexamined in transactional terms, one can\n\nrecognize that for these patients it may\n\nsignify the reenactment of some damaging\n\nexperience in their past ....\n\n[Anorexics] experience 'interpretations' as\n\nindicating that someone else knows what\n\nthey truly mean and feel, that they\n\nthemselves do not understand their own\n\nthoughts. (The Golden Cage 123)\n\nNot understanding her own thoughts is linked, for the\n\nanorexic, with ontological confusion: \"They act and talk\n\n14\n\nas if they and their body were separate entities\" (Eating\n\nDisorders 91).\n\nThis refusal of knowing with a focus on being can be\n\nlinked to MacHale's argument that \"the dominant of\n\npostmodernist fiction is ontological\" (10). Here, the key\n\ngenre is science fiction, which features the creation and\n\nintersection of alternative worlds. The postmodern\n\nontological fiction doesn't require a solution even if it\n\nposits a mystery: Who killed Mr. Herbert? Was Caspasian\n\na criminal or a compassionate friend? Did the Colpitts\n\nwomen drown their husbands and why? Greenaway's films\n\neither offer no solutions or mutually-plausible solutions.\n\nUnlike the ambiguity of modernism, here this lack of a\n\nconclusive answer implies that an explanation is\n\nunimportant.\n\nThe postmodern fiction accepts alternative worlds and\n\nalternative states of consciousness existing\n\nsimultaneously. In The Cook, the Thief. Georgina's dress\n\nchanges color— from green to red to white— as she passes\n\nfrom one room to another. The film never suggests a real\n\nworld; the dress has no one true color. The promise of\n\nsolution and cure through knowledge that hysteria presents\n\nno longer has validity. The character of Georgina can't be\n\nknown or diagnosed. She has no psychological consistency—\n\nno one true color.\n\n15\n\nThe question of basic ontological insecurity raises an\n\nissue crucial to a conception of bulimic cinema: control.\n\nWhatever other explanations are presented to account for\n\nthe existence of eating disorders, one persists— from\n\nRaymond Bell's description of anorexic medieval female\n\nsaints to Susie Orbach's investigation of contemporary\n\nwomen: the issue of control. When asked by her doctor\n\nwhether she considered herself crazy, one patient answered,\n\n\"Am I what? Normal? No. Crazy? I don't know. Out of\n\ncontrol? Yes. Out of control so I'm not crazy? Maybe\"\n\n(Boris 96). Out of control feelings related to eating are\n\npart of the condition's official description: \"The DSM-\n\nIII—R criteria require the presence of recurrent binge-\n\neating episodes, a feeling of lack of control during eating\n\nbinges, and persistent overconcern with body shape and\n\nweight\" (Mitchell 94). Inability to maintain control over\n\nwhat she eats and how her body appears leads paradoxically\n\nto rigid and ritualized feeding. Anorectics will often\n\ninsist on eating the same items at the same times each day.\n\nA stick of gum or a single grape may be divided into many\n\nsmall pieces and doled out according to an inflexible\n\nschedule. \"In the early stages, this state of self-imposed\n\nstarvation seems to produce a sense of personal control not\n\npreviously experienced\" (Kennedy 76).\n\n16\n\nThe paradox of out-of-control feelings conquered\n\nthrough excessive and ultimately uncontrollable control can\n\nbe seen on several levels of Greenaway's work. A Film\n\nQuarterly review of The Draughtsman's Contract, sees\n\nassertions of power in the film's absurdism, its structure\n\nand its resolution:\n\nThe Draughtsman's Contract, by preventing\n\nboth protagonist and audience from, in the\n\nbroadest sense, 'understanding,' affirms\n\nthe power of the film-maker and, within the\n\ntext, the power of the socially dominant\n\nclass, which controls the 'true meanings'\n\nbehind the presented reality of the film.\n\n(Malcomson 39)\n\nExcessive control is also apparent in visual design, when\n\nthe work of other painters is faithfully recreated, and\n\nthrough cinematic conceits: not moving the camera in The\n\nDraughtsman's Contract. withholding close-ups in A Zed and\n\nTwo Noughts.\n\nRather than \"affirm[ing] the power\" of the filmmaker,\n\nhowever, I would argue that this extremely realized formal\n\ncontrol demonstrates just the opposite. Artists and artist\n\nfigures in Greenaway's films almost inevitably come to an\n\nunfortunate end. A sense of abundant autonomy is gradually\n\nreplaced by powerlessness; this powerlessness operates in\n\nthe realm of the self, the created art object and even\n\nchildren. The artist's confidence in his artistry,\n\nsexuality and paternity inevitably erodes. The tension\n\n17\n\nbetween control and powerlessness here functions in a way\n\nsimilar to that in eating disorders.\n\nWe can see this loss of control, which is really an\n\nabasement, in the shift from the creative role of the\n\nartist to that of the father. The Deuce brothers, Storley\n\nKracklite and Mr. Neville begin by asserting creative\n\nauthority over a documentary, an architectural\n\nretrospective and a series of drawings, respectively; they\n\nend by grasping for the paternity of their children before\n\nthey die. Ernest Becker defines the causa-sui of the\n\ncreative personality as: \"the narcissistic self-inflation\n\nthat denies dependency on the female body and on one's\n\nspecies given role and the control and harboring of the\n\npower and meaning of one's individuality\" (119). To\n\nsuccumb to the species imperative of biological\n\nreproduction is a lesser feat than the god-like project of\n\ncreating the self. Beginning in aspiration, the artists in\n\nGreenaway's films find themselves battling to maintain a\n\ndebased role. The metaphor of bulimic cinema— which\n\ninvokes a wild fluctuation between regulation and abandon—\n\nprovides a model to analyze this crucial issue of artistic\n\ncontrol.\n\nBulimic cinema also illuminates Greenaway's response\n\nto a crisis of consumption in consumer society connected to\n\nwhat has come to be called postmodernism, especially the\n\n18\n\npostmodern tendency to collapse oppositions. In this\n\ncontext, the most prominent opposition is that between high\n\nart and mass culture which, as Andreas Huyssen argues, is a\n\ncrucial feature of modernism:\n\nOnly by fortifying its boundaries, by\n\nmaintaining its purity and autonomy, and by\n\navoiding any contamination with mass\n\nculture and with the signifying systems of\n\neveryday life can the art work maintain its\n\nadversary stance: adversary to the\n\nbourgeois culture of everyday life as well\n\nas adversary to mass culture and\n\nentertainment which are seen as the primary\n\n[focus] of bourgeois cultural articulation.\n\n(Huyssen 73)\n\nFor a modernist sensibility, a collapse of high art into\n\nmass culture can only mean indiscrimination. The ability\n\nto identify valuable— transgressive, adversary— art and\n\ndistinguish it from pointless trash is compromised. Jurgen\n\nHabermas— who seeks to continue the project of modernity—\n\ninterprets the collapse of high art into mass culture as\n\nleading to political reactionism because of the inability\n\nof the work to be transgressive and oppositional.\n\nHowever the collapse of the high/low split is\n\ninterpreted in its effects, its basis can be identified in\n\na mind/body dualism from which an array of oppositions\n\nflows including masculine/feminine, word/image. This is\n\none of the areas where a metaphor of anorexia and bulimia\n\ncan be useful in understanding art in a period of mass\n\nconsumerism. Consumerism is itself not a concept fully\n\n19\n\nunderstood because its basis is obscured. Eating confounds\n\nthe barriers between subject and object, perpetually\n\nundermining a mind/body dualism. If you are what you eat,\n\nand what you eat is invariably dead, inert matter, what is\n\nthe human subject? The function of eating in many art\n\nworks is simply displaced onto the problems of sexuality or\n\nclass, a movement which displaces the truly disturbing\n\naspects of eating. An examination of aberrant eating can\n\nhelp us to understand the threat that all eating poses. As\n\nGreenaway's films consistently illustrate, no act of\n\ndigestion is innocent whether the object consumed is an\n\napple, the seed of a pomegranate, or a portion of human\n\nflesh.\n\nBefore I continue, I would like to clarify two points\n\nabout my use of a metaphor of eating disorders and my use\n\nof textual material.\n\nIn Feminism Without Women. Tania Modleski raises a\n\nwarning concerning the increased use of anorexia in\n\ncultural writing. She critiques some theorists for\n\n\"finding in anorexia a laudable feminine rejection of the\n\nbody\" (110). Instead, she urges feminists to \"refuse the\n\nromantic impulse to celebrate a disease that only reflects\n\npatriarchy's paradoxical image of woman (\"transcendence in\n\nimmanence\") back to itself. . .\" (110). Modleski's refusal\n\nto celebrate as liberating for women what is in fact a\n\n20\n\npainful, debilitating, often lethal illness is a position I\n\nshare. It may be satisfying to think of anorexia as\n\npositive resistance, but it is less so when we consider why\n\nwomen's struggle should take such a self-abusive turn.\n\nAnorexia and bulimia as personal strategy lack a crucial\n\naspect of effective political resistance: autonomy. The\n\nperson in the grip of disease, even a disease about\n\ncontrol, is surely not in control. Instead of valorizing\n\nmental illness as a technique, we need to analyze a culture\n\nthat foments this kind of response— that offers many women\n\na sense of control only in the form of the most profound\n\ndisturbance and denial.\n\nBut if the real historical incidence of eating\n\ndisorders in real historical subjects cannot be seen as\n\nresisting or liberating, the conceptual use of these\n\nproblems poses a number of questions and suggests some\n\npossible ways to consider them. What is the relationship\n\nof eating and sexuality? What is the basis of our\n\ndiscomfort with consumption? How can we understand\n\ncultural cycles of incorporation? And why has the topic of\n\neating become so prevalent in contemporary art?\n\nAlthough my discussion of bulimic cinema will be\n\nprimarily confined to film and video projects written\n\nand/or directed by British filmmaker Peter Greenaway, I\n\nwill argue that what I identify as a quality of bulimia can\n\n21\n\nbe found in a wide range of cultural products. No artist\n\nworks in a vacuum, and Greenaway has been particularly\n\nforward in stuffing his work with references both explicit\n\nand obscure to art, science and philosophy. Among the most\n\nobvious influences are Jorge Luis Borges' essays and short\n\nstories, and I have included some mention of these. I also\n\nmake use of other prose texts and films for which I do not\n\nmake a case of direct influence either on Greenaway or from\n\nhim. I include them because, I will argue, they share\n\nqualities of what I will call bulimic cinema. By \"bulimic”\n\nI refer to the whole continuum of eating disorders which\n\nincludes anorexia, and by \"cinema\" I recognize the medium\n\nmost susceptible to these characteristics. It is the art\n\nform which has eaten the traditional arts, and is now in\n\nthe process of being eaten itself, by television.\n\nFinally, I would like to note the particular\n\nchallenges that Greenaway's texts offer to the critic and\n\nhow I have responded to them in my use of his texts. To\n\ntake just the example of the scene with which I began this\n\ndiscussion: the cannibalism scene of The Cook, the Thief.\n\nWe could identify, we could even become entrapped in\n\nidentifying, how certain details of the scene reproduce\n\nthemes of Greenaway's work. The scene includes references\n\nto: literature (John Ford's 'Tis Pity She's A Whore.\n\nDickens); pictorial art (17th century Dutch painting); the\n\n22\n\nFrench Revolution (the downtrodden rise up to slay their\n\noppressors); consumption (Spica, the man who can buy\n\nanything and understand nothing, forced to eat his victim);\n\nrevenge; as well as interconnectedness to other Greenaway\n\nfilms (Spica is the name of a star in Drowning By Numbers,\n\netc.).\n\nGreenaway's references create a ceaselessly repeated\n\npattern. The whole is contained in a fragment; the same\n\ntropes reappear on different scales. This quality\n\ndiscourages horizontal analysis, just as a crystal would,\n\nand instead spawns a series of endlessly spiraling lists.\n\nA discussion of Greenaway's work can quickly devolve into a\n\npointless recitation of vertical categories. The issues I\n\ndiscuss— forgery, excess, eating and nakedness, gender,\n\nparent/child relationships, television, and interpretation-\n\n-can be applied to all of Greenaway's films and videos.\n\nAlthough I concentrate on one or two films in each chapter,\n\nthe same features perpetually re-occur across a corpus\n\nwhich, in many ways, can't be clearly delimited into\n\nseparate art objects.\n\nWithin \"cannibal,\" the final word in The Cook, the\n\nThief. is contained a range of associations that permeate\n\nGreenaway's work. It also invokes one of the most crucial\n\nideas in that corpus: the problem of classification. How\n\ndo we classify cannibalism? As aberration? As punishable\n\n23\n\ncrime? Or is it simply an extreme example of the fact that\n\nall eating is highly ritualized, used for a variety of\n\nsocial purposes, and never simply nutritive? With the\n\nconsumption of human flesh the problems of eating and\n\nclassification come together in a broad and impossible\n\nquestion: What is the nature of humankind? Of what is it\n\nmade and how can it be classified? More specifically, but\n\njust as impossibly, what is the nature of the artistic mind\n\nthat must eat and be eaten?\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nHow do you forge a film?:\n\nCriminal Conspiracy in A Zed and Two Noughts\n\nBorges' short story Pierre Menard. Author of the Don\n\nQuixote describes its hero, a 20th-century Frenchman, as\n\nwanting to write the Don Quixote.\n\nIt is unnecessary to add that his aim was\n\nnever to produce a mechanical transcription\n\nof the original; he did not propose to copy\n\nit. His admirable ambition was to produce\n\npages which would coincide— word for word\n\nand line for line— with those of Miguel de\n\nCervantes. (48)\n\nThe narrator offers this analysis of passages from\n\nt\n\nCervantes' version and from Menard's— passages which are,\n\nneedless to say, identical:\n\nEqually vivid is the contrast in styles.\n\nThe archaic style of Menard— in the last\n\nanalysis a foreigner— suffers from a\n\ncertain affectation. Not so that of his\n\nprecursor, who handles easily the ordinary\n\nSpanish of his time. (53)\n\nOne way in which the story amuses is in the attempt to\n\nwrest away the ownership of Don Quixote from Cervantes, but\n\na Don Quixote which is then no longer what it was because\n\nit is no longer written by Cervantes. The work may be\n\nricher or more impressive, but it is also less valuable.\n\nIn this strange case of plagiarism, as in the cases of\n\nforgery and appropriation, a vital area of discussion is\n\nthe relationship between the artist and the work. Borges\n\nhere imperils that relationship to the extent that he makes\n\nit a joke. Cervantes becomes a grouping system, a category\n\nof analysis.\n\nAccording to Michel Foucault:\n\nAn author's name is not simply an element\n\nin a discourse (capable of being either\n\nsubject or object, of being replaced by a\n\npronoun, and the like); it performs a\n\ncertain role with regard to narrative\n\ndiscourse, assuring a classificatory\n\nfunction. Such a name permits one to group\n\ntogether a certain number of texts, define\n\nthem, differentiate them from and contrast\n\nthem to others. (107)\n\nThis author function also acts to reduce the danger of\n\ndiscourse:\n\nThe question then becomes: How can one\n\nreduce the great peril, the great danger\n\nwith which fiction threatens our world?\n\nThe answer is: one can reduce it with the\n\nauthor. (118)\n\nBy attributing the discourse to a single individual—\n\nfallible and vulnerable as well as limited— it becomes less\n\npowerful and less prolific. While Foucault recognizes the\n\n\"'ideological' status of the author\" and how it disarms\n\ndiscourse, he also suggests that the discourse might\n\nendanger the author. The author \"assumes the role of the\n\ndead man in the game of writing\" (Foucault 103). It is the\n\ndanger to the artist in the artist-*work relationship which\n\nI would like to discuss, particularly how it is\n\nconceptualized differently in forgery and appropriation.\n\nIs it even possible to speak of forgery without the\n\npresence of an original creative persona? In Umberto Eco's\n\nThe Limits of Interpretation, the \"Fakes and Forgeries\"\n\nchapter minutely categorizes the forging of paintings,\n\ndocuments, essays, the Parthenon, but not films. Cinematic\n\nborrowings are described in another essay, \"Interpreting\n\nSerials.\" In this chapter, Eco points out that the\n\ninsistence on originality is a romantic— modernist idea;\n\nthat postmodern imitation realized in film and television\n\nis entirely in the spirit of Aristotle's Poetics; and that\n\nreally one can't avoid correlations between Balzac and\n\nDallas. although, Eco implies, Balzac is more interesting.\n\nBut Eco's appreciation of postmodern appropriation is not\n\nunambiguous. For Eco, the divide between high art/low art\n\nhas shifted from the art object to the reader. The reader\n\nof aesthetic objects which imitate or borrow is either\n\nnaive— someone who doesn't understand from what sources the\n\nwork borrows— or critical— someone who does understand. Of\n\nthe first category, there is an \"unhappy many,\" who fail\n\nto understand that there is an original author much less\n\nwho he or she may be. Of the latter, a \"happy few,\" who\n\nenjoy \"a neobaroque pleasure\" by knowing the ancestry of\n\nthe aesthetic object (Eco 99).\n\nIt becomes clear why Eco discusses cinema and\n\ntelevision in terms of seriality rather than forgery, why\n\nhe opposes the name of the object, Dallas. to the name of\n\n27\n\nthe creator \"Balzac,\" why, in fact, if there is no Homer,\n\none must be invented.\n\nEco's organization implicitly recognizes the creator's\n\nobliteration, or at least disconnection, from the body of\n\nthe film text, a disconnection established early in cinema\n\nhistory. Directors, as well as actors, were not commonly\n\ncredited for their contributions to silent films until the\n\nmid-teens. D.W. Griffith, for example, made more than 400\n\nfilms for the Biograph Company without director credit.\n\nWhen he left Biograph for Mutual in 1913, Griffith took out\n\ntrade ads to assert creative ownership over his work.\n\nAlthough currently the director's name occupies a place of\n\nhonor closest to the body of the text, the extensive array\n\nof names which accompany it in the credits emphasizes\n\ncinema's traditionally collaborative nature, its multiple\n\nauthorship.\n\nWhile Eco distinguishes the forging of paintings from\n\nthe appropriations of cinema— with the division of chapters\n\nsubstituting for a clear rationale— Greenaway has collapsed\n\nthe two issues in several of his films and videos. In\n\nparticular, Greenaway's second feature, A Zed and Two\n\nNoughts, deals explicitly with the forging of paintings and\n\nthe production of cinema and is, itself, an assemblage of\n\nappropriated parts. Although the varieties of artistic\n\nactions in the film are characterized by intent and\n\n28\n\naccomplishment, all artistic operations are carried out\n\nunder a dark cloud of criminal conspiracy. The\n\nobliteration of the artistic personality appearing\n\nsimultaneously with the depiction and perpetration of\n\nconspiracies may itself not be a coincidence.\n\nExamples of forgery and appropriation with\n\nconspiratorial intent appear in A Zed and Two Noughts so\n\nfrequently and variously that it is difficult to catalog\n\nthem. Most obviously, the presence of the seventeenth-\n\ncentury Dutch painter Vermeer, an historical figure\n\nassociated with spurious reproductions, permeates the film.\n\nThe historical Vermeer had a maternal grandfather who\n\ncounterfeited Dutch coins in the Hague (Montias 17). Three\n\nhundred years later Vermeer's paintings were involved in\n\nthe most notorious art history scandal of the twentieth\n\ncentury. A Dutch art dealer named Hans van Meegeren forged\n\nseveral Vermeers, some of which he then sold to the Nazis.\n\nLater, fearing war crimes charges, he confessed his\n\nforgeries to outraged critics who had accepted the\n\npaintings as genuine. Some of these canvasses are still in\n\ndispute (Bianconi 87). One character in Greenaway's film\n\nis named for this famous forger. The film's Van Meegeren\n\nis an evil surgeon and hobbyist painter who wants to paint\n\nlike Vermeer. Greenaway's \"homage\" to Vermeer, as he puts\n\nit, also has a formal aspect: lighting and composition\n\n29\n\nmimic that found in Vermeer paintings, and Greenaway's\n\nmise-en-scene includes objects— maps, trumpets, letters—\n\ncommonly depicted by Vermeer.\n\nWhile Van Meegeren works at forgery, the heroes of the\n\nfilm are just as obsessed with appropriation. Oliver and\n\nOswald Deuce— separated Siamese twins— lose their wives in\n\na freak car accident. To assuage their grief, they embark\n\non a project to discover— through cinema— what happens to\n\npeople after they die. Their \"documentary” is based on the\n\ninfluential BBC documentary by David Attenborough, \"Life on\n\nEarth\" (1979), snippets of which.are shown, unnamed and\n\nuncredited, but presumably recognizable. Attenborough\n\ndescribes the process of evolution with segments showing\n\nincreasingly more complex forms of life. The Deuce\n\nbrothers appropriate the same organization, but show the\n\ndisintegration of increasingly more complex forms—\n\nbeginning with an apple and ending with themselves. The\n\nact of creation leads, in their case, to the personal\n\nannihilation of the artists.\n\nThe Deuce brothers' creative act of film production is\n\nechoed by their creative act of fatherhood. One or both of\n\nthem impregnates Alba Bewick, and their struggle to produce\n\nthe film runs concurrently with their struggle to assert\n\npaternal control over the prenatal twins.\n\n30\n\nThe association of the art object with a child,\n\napparent in this concurrent struggle, is also implicit in\n\nGreenaway's depiction of the character Van Meegeren, who\n\nenters the story as a surgeon and appears, frequently,\n\nattempting to paint the other characters, forcibly costumed\n\nin seventeenth-century garb and arranged like the figures\n\nin Vermeer paintings. The surgeon, in this way, lays claim\n\nto Vermeer's posterity. He also conspires to adopt the\n\nunborn children of Oliver and Oswald Deuce. With this\n\nattempted usurpation, Van Meegeren lays claim to the\n\nposterity of Oliver and Oswald.\n\nVan Meegeren's mistress in the film shares a name with\n\nVermeer's wife, Catherina Bolnes, but unlike her\n\nseventeenth-century model, who bore Vermeer fourteen\n\nchildren, the film's Bolnes is barren. Their other common\n\nmistress— painting— was also fertile for Vermeer, but\n\nbarren for his imitator. Van Meegeren can't create—\n\nbiologically or artistically. He must steal babies as well\n\nas inspiration.\n\nIn A Zed and Two Noughts. Greenaway depicts the figure\n\nof the forger as particularly destructive; when he is not\n\npainting or bullying the Deuce brothers, Van Meegeren\n\nperforms unnecessary leg amputations. Forgery is aberrant\n\nand criminal because it attempts to steal the posterity of\n\nthe artist and defile it. The undiscovered forgery\n\n31\n\nimplies the potential to taint the artist's reputation— to\n\ninfect it with spurious meanings. As a category of\n\nanalysis, however, undiscovered forgeries don't really\n\nexist. The revealed forgery, the only forgery we can ever\n\nknow, serves only to bolster the reputation and importance\n\nof the originating artist. By striving for maximum\n\nfidelity to the original, the forger reinforces the unity\n\nand integrity of the art object and simultaneously the\n\nunity and integrity of the artist. Pursuit of the greatest\n\n\"authenticity\" leads inevitably back to the \"author.\" The\n\nartist's relationship with the work is therefore\n\nreaffirmed.\n\nIn his analysis of the historical Van Meegeren's most\n\nfamous forgery, Alfred Lessing asserts: \"Paradoxically, The\n\nDisciples at Emmaus is as much a monument to the artistic\n\ngenius of Vermeer as are Vermeer's own paintings. Even\n\nthough it was painted by van Meegeren in the twentieth\n\ncentury, it embodies and bears witness to the greatness of\n\nthe seventeenth-century art of Vermeer\" (Lessing 76). This\n\nconception of the artist-work relationship posits the\n\nartist as the model for the work— as the parent is the\n\nmodel for the child and the teacher is the model for the\n\npupil. A forgery recreates the artist, perpetuating the\n\noriginal self-creation of artistic production. This\n\noriginal causa-sui of the creative personality is, as\n\n32\n\nErnest Becker points out, \"independent of the female body\n\nand on one's species given role\" (Becker 119).\n\nThe possibility of non-biological reproduction is also\n\nraised in Greenaway's presentation of appropriation,\n\nparticularly through the figures of twins Oswald and\n\nOliver. Otto Rank links the twin with the artist through\n\nprecisely this self-reproductive quality: \"As the twins\n\nappear to have created themselves independently of natural\n\nprocreation, so they were believed to be able to create\n\nthings which formerly did not exist in nature— that is,\n\nwhat is called culture\" (The Double 92).\n\nOliver and Oswald's artistic enterprise— a film about\n\ndecay— is presented as the recovery of loss, initially the\n\nloss of their pregnant wives. Ultimately, their loss is\n\npresented as an earlier separation; the plot reveals that\n\nOliver and Oswald were originally Siamese twins, separated\n\nin babyhood. This separation replaces the more usual\n\ntrauma of the separation of mother and child, a loss that\n\nalso leads to the creation of culture. Like Becker's\n\nartistic causa-sui. this substitution gives the brothers an\n\nillusion of being \"independent of the female body.\"\n\nAs in all of Greenaway's films, however, this illusion\n\nof independence, as well as the illusion of artistic\n\ncontrol and autonomy is revealed to be a sham. A stable\n\nattitude toward the art object becomes impossible. For\n\n33\n\nOliver and Oswald, the art object is not associated with a\n\nchild or son; it is not an unambiguous object capable of\n\nperpetuating the artist, instead, art is associated with\n\nfemininity. The art object is both venerated as an ideal—\n\nmadonna— and debased as a commodity— whore. The two major\n\nfemale characters in A Zed and Two Noughts provide an\n\nexample of each of these roles. Alba Bewick functions as a\n\nmother in her relationship with her daughter Beta and also\n\nin her maternal attitude towards the Deuce brothers; she\n\nalso becomes the mother of Oliver and Oswald's children.\n\nAlba consistently submits, although reluctantly at times,\n\nto male authority when she poses for paintings and, at the\n\nurging of her doctor, allows her second leg to be removed.\n\nWhere Alba represents a madonna, useful only for admiration\n\nand reproduction, another female character— Venus de Milo—\n\nis an industrious, capitalist career woman with several\n\nprofessions. Milo's name suggests that she too is\n\nlimbless, but she is, instead, well-armed as a seamstress,\n\na prostitute, and a writer zealously pursuing publication.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, her industry and\n\nresourcefulness, she is treated throughout the film with\n\ncontempt.\n\nIn forgery, the extremes of admiration and contempt\n\ncome together when the economic value of art, the venial\n\nmotive, comes to the aid of veneration. The forgery \"is as\n\n34\n\nmuch a monument to the artistic genius of Vermeer, as are\n\nVermeer's own paintings.\" It is only in the process of\n\ncutting the imitated object off from its author that we\n\ndiscover appropriation and, for this reason, appropriation\n\nis far more damaging to the conception of the artist. The\n\nsimulacrum is not interested in \"authenticity.\"\n\nIn a Zed and Two Noughts, the Deuce brothers— each the\n\nsimulacrum of the other— make no claims to authenticity,\n\nbecause they do not recognize or admit that they have\n\nsources, artistic or biological. Their film, which depicts\n\nan apple, prawns, an alligator, a swan and a zebra\n\ndisintegrating in time-lapse photography, mimics in reverse\n\nAttenborough's Life on Earth— but Attenborough is never\n\nacknowledged or even mentioned. Oliver and Oswald are\n\nappropriators in yet another sense: they obtain the animal\n\ncorpses needed for their film from a group of shady\n\ncharacters. Not only do they refuse to do their own\n\nkilling, they refuse to acknowledge that the animals have\n\nbeen slaughtered on their behalf.\n\nDespite their differences, the singular forger and the\n\nplural filmmakers have common interests and points of\n\ncontact. Although they express mutual animosity, Van\n\nMeegeren and the Deuce Brothers come close to an uneasy and\n\nimpossible deal. When Oliver and Oswald are wounded by a\n\ntiger they visit Van Meegeren for treatment. While trading\n\n35\n\ninsults, the brothers and the doctor negotiate for what\n\nthey want and what they feel the other party could provide.\n\nOliver and Oswald want to be re-attached as Siamese twins.\n\nVan Meegeren, more accustomed to amputating limbs, says he\n\nwill oblige if, in recompense, he could be allowed to adopt\n\nAlba's unborn twins.\n\nIn this scene, as in the rest of the film, Greenaway's\n\nvisual references to Vermeer are obvious: two Vermeer\n\npaintings hang on the wall; the floor is checkered; a low\n\nlight source emanates from the left side of the frame; the\n\nhuman body is shown at a \"full-shot\" distance; figures hold\n\nobjects. Van Meegeren— \"no Vermeer\" as the brothers point\n\nout— no longer strives for his own artistic or patriarchal\n\nsuccess. Oliver and Oswald are no better off. Their\n\ndesire to be re-attached— to annul their traumatic\n\nseparation— may indicate a need to abdicate the artist's\n\nrole. Greenaway's depiction of Oliver and Oswald makes his\n\nown position extremely complex. Even as he destroys his\n\nheroes, he has put himself in their place. The Deuce\n\nbrothers use another artist, Attenborough, for inspiration,\n\nas does Greenaway with Vermeer. The Deuce brothers use\n\ncinema to mourn their losses; Greenaway does as well. But\n\nunlike his fictional characters, the director seems willing\n\nto take responsibility for the dead bodies his acts of\n\ncreation generate.\n\n36\n\nIn Greenaway's work, film and video become the media\n\nthrough which the traditional arts become known—\n\narchitecture and sculpture in The Belly of the Architect;\n\ndrafting, painting and landscaping in The Draughtsman's\n\nContract: literature in A TV Dante. Cinema repositions\n\nthese other art forms and, in doing so, cuts them off from\n\ntheir original authorization. Like the character Bolnes,\n\nthe mistress of the film's Van Meegeren, painting is now\n\nbarren. It can no longer lead to the re-creation of the\n\nartist— the art object as child. Cinema has infected\n\npainting's reputation, rendering it sterile. If we look at\n\nit in an evolutionary sense, which A Zed and Two Noughts\n\nseems to invite, cinema accomplishes the murders of both\n\npainter and painting.\n\nIn \"Introjection— Incorporation, Mourning or\n\nMelancholia.\" Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok consider two\n\nresponses to grief. Their distinction can be interestingly\n\napplied to how cycles of appropriation create and destroy\n\nart objects. Abraham and Torok consider the condition of\n\nmourning by distinguishing between introjection— a process-\n\n-and incorporation— a fantasy. Introjection allows a\n\ntopographical alteration in the psychic system, an\n\nacknowledgement of loss. Incorporation uses fantasy to\n\nconserve a secretly maintained topography. The difference\n\nbetween the two corresponds to the difference between\n\n37\n\n\"learning a language and buying a dictionary\" (Abraham 5).\n\nOr to put it in terms pertinent to Greenaway, the\n\ndifference between eating with digestion and without it.\n\nOswald avoids \"swallowing\" his loss by swallowing instead\n\nshattered glass from his wife's fatal accident. Oswald and\n\nOliver fail to resolve their grief; but, I would argue,\n\nGreenaway successfully introjects Vermeer— acknowledging\n\nthe loss of painting.\n\nThe introjection of Greenaway's film is perhaps\n\nclearer when contrasted to Jon Jost's recent All the\n\nVermeer's in New York and the way it incorporates Vermeer.\n\nThe characters in Jost's film visit the Metropolitan Museum\n\nand gaze reverently at the original framed Vermeer\n\npaintings on the wall. These paintings are swallowed\n\nwhole. The admired canvasses represent an idealized\n\nalternative to the venality which characterizes all the\n\nother human relationships in the film.\n\nThe connection of swallowing and grief reaches its\n\napotheosis in Greenaway's feature The Cook, the Thief. His\n\nWife and Her Lover, where the cook explains that he charges\n\nmore for black food because patrons can then say, \"Death, I\n\neat you.\" That film culminates in murder, mourning and,\n\ninevitably it seems, cannibalism. Cinema, paradoxical in\n\nso many ways, murders and mourns in the same instance.\n\n38\n\nDebates about forgery seem to devolve into one\n\nquestion: if two objects are identical, how can one— the\n\noriginal— be more valuable, in an aesthetic sense, than\n\nanother— the forgery? When film imitates, however, there\n\nis no possibility of perfect identity, no point in striving\n\nfor authenticity and no need to remain loyal to the author.\n\nBy its nature, film rules out fidelity. The very\n\npossibility of faithfulness has been obscured.\n\nWhat are the implications of this impossibility?\n\nForgery, which perpetuates and validates the aspirations of\n\nthe creative persona, is, in fact, an activity necessary to\n\nthe conception of an artist. The loss of forgery is, for\n\nthe artist, the loss of one testimony to mastery, and this\n\nis only one of many contemporary encroachments on the\n\nartist's position.\n\nFoucault has argued that the concept \"author\" is used\n\nby readers to control the danger of the discourse.\n\nGreenaway's films ask, and attempt to answer, Foucault's\n\nother point. How do authors— authors not only of film but\n\nof other arts such as painting— authors who are there, but\n\nnot there— how do these authors control their mortal danger\n\nfrom the cinema discourse?\n\nThere is yet another related question lurking for the\n\nreaders of texts: do any repercussions or dangers— to the\n\nreader— attend the annihilation of the author? Roland\n\n39\n\nBarthes— a prime suspect in, but hardly the sole\n\nperpetrator of, the artist's annihilation— addresses this\n\nissue in his influential essay, \"Death of the Author?\"\n\nBarthes observes the father/artist, child/art object\n\nmetaphor at work:\n\nThe Author is thought to nourish the book,\n\nwhich is to say that he exists before it,\n\nthinks, suffers, lives for it, is in the\n\nsame relation of antecedence to his work as\n\na father to his child. (145)\n\nThe implications of this relationship extend beyond the\n\nrealm of either fathers and children or the production of\n\nthe work of art. The father/author becomes aligned with\n\nthe idea of God through his creative function. The death\n\nof the Author then is also the death of God:\n\nIn precisely this way literature (it would\n\nbe better from now on to say writing), by\n\nrefusing to assign a 'secret', an ultimate\n\nmeaning, to the text (and to the world as\n\ntext), liberates what may be called an\n\nanti-theological activity, an activity that\n\nis truly revolutionary since to refuse to\n\nfix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God\n\nand his hypostases— reason, science, law.\n\n(147)\n\nBut if the author didn't do it, who did? If God\n\ndoesn't exist, what consciousness orders the universe?\n\nBarthes concludes that \"a text's unity lies not in its\n\norigin but in its destination\" (\"Death of the Author\" 148).\n\nThis is, of course, the same shift to the reader that Eco\n\ndescribes in his discussion of how high art and low art\n\nhave been replaced by the high or low skills of the reader.\n\n40\n\nMeaning resides in the reader, and \"the birth of the reader\n\nmust be at the cost of the Author\" (148). If we extend\n\nBarthes' metaphor, is the birth of the human being at the\n\ncost of the death of God? Certainly the birth of the child\n\nis at the cost of the death of the father, but the prior\n\nexistence of the father seems to be a presupposition of the\n\noperation. If the analogy holds, the Author does not\n\nsimply not exist, he must first exist so as to be killed as\n\na sacrifice to the reader's birth.\n\nThe same may be said of the notion of God who must\n\nalso, it seems, be dispatched with malicious intent. This\n\nparticular murder pervades contemporary society, as, for\n\ninstance, in the Death of God theology movement of the\n\n1960s which:\n\nclaimed that meaningful talk about God is\n\nimpossible for two reasons: modern people\n\nrequire empirical evidence and the idea of\n\na benevolent ruler of the world is morally\n\nrepugnant in light of such events as the\n\nHolocaust. (Carse 212)\n\nThe specter of murder is crucial to this thinking which is,\n\nafter all, not the Non-existence of God movement.\n\nNietzsche's madman had much earlier announced this\n\nimportant crime, the perpetrator and the resulting\n\nemotions:\n\nDo we not hear anything yet of the noise of\n\nthe grave-diggers who are burying God? Do\n\nwe not smell anything yet of God's\n\ndecomposition? Gods too decompose. God is\n\ndead. God remains dead, and we have\n\n41\n\nkilled him. How shall we, the murderers of\n\nall murderers, comfort ourselves?\n\n(Nietzsche 105)\n\nAttempting to solve such a murder touches off an endless\n\nchain of speculation which, perhaps, can never end, but\n\nonly get more convoluted. If God is dead, first, who\n\nkilled Him and, second, what entity can arise to fill the\n\nvacuum of functions and qualities traditionally assigned to\n\na creative power?\n\nIn Greenaway's films, the controlling sensibility—\n\nwhich can never belong to a single artist— belongs, not to\n\nthe reader, but to a conspiracy. Readers don't kill the\n\nartist, although they may, perhaps, collude. Mysterious,\n\nconspiratorial forces always perpetrate the worst crimes.\n\nThey trample the concept of a creative God through the\n\ndestruction of the artist, His structural equivalent. They\n\nthen usurp the controlling and ordering functions of a\n\ndeity.\n\nIn A Zed and Two Noughts, van Meegeren in league with\n\nhis mistress Bolnes creates his forgeries, but this is not\n\nthe only criminal conspiracy in the film. A band of zoo\n\nworkers run a black market operation in animal corpses.\n\nWhile pulling a dripping crocodile corpse out of his\n\nraincoat, Joshua Plate notes how easy such an operation can\n\nbe: \"In a zoo community of seven thousand animals there\n\nare deaths every day. Crocodiles are not immortal.\" The\n\n42\n\nconspiracy simply usurps the life and death powers of God;\n\nthe crime is easily concealed.\n\nAn etymological connection exists between the concept\n\nof a deity and that of a conspiracy. To conspire means to\n\nbreathe with someone; the conspirators form a connection by\n\nbreathing together in their plots. The deity also forms\n\nrelationships through a breath, the spirit that enters the\n\nbeliever (con spirito sanctus). This penetrating breath\n\nmight carry the inspiration to which the artist aspires.\n\nThe concept of conspiracy contains many of the same\n\nfunctions and qualities that we ascribe to the concept of a\n\ndeity. Both create order and meaning. Possessing an\n\ninfectious quality, for good or ill, both have the ability\n\nto inspire or provoke action. Although their presence may\n\nbe sensed indirectly, both remain secret and\n\nincomprehensible. Unknowability is essential to the very\n\nnature of God and serves to distinguish Him from His human\n\ncreation. Conspiracies hide their existence out of\n\ncriminal necessity, but this very disguise becomes an\n\nimportant activity of the conspiracy and sometimes its main\n\nrationale. The concepts of both God and conspiracy imply\n\nan entity without known borders or limits.\n\nThe existence of a pervasive conspiracy figures in\n\nalmost every Greenaway film. A conspiracy is implied in\n\nevery atypical ordering pattern, and Greenaway's films are\n\n43\n\ndesigned around atypical ordering patterns. By shifting\n\nthe emphasis from one ordering pattern to another, the\n\nmeaning and interpretation of the narrative can shift\n\nradically.\n\nIn the example with which we began, \"Pierre Menard,\"\n\nBorges plays with the ordering pattern of authorship. In\n\n\"Three Versions of Judas,\" Borges provides another example\n\nof an alternative ordering pattern, one that evokes\n\nquestions of authority, criminality and conspiracy. The\n\nstory purports to describe the New Testament research of\n\nthe \"deeply religious\" 20th century scholar Nils Runeberg.\n\nNoting, as had others, that Judas' act was superfluous, but\n\nthat an act in such a crucial drama could not be haphazard,\n\nRuneberg concluded that \"the treachery of Judas was not\n\naccidental; it was a predestined deed which has its\n\nmysterious place in the economy of the Redemption\" (152).\n\nRuneberg assigns to Judas the ultimate heroic role, that of\n\nthe Word made flesh Itself, God made man Himself. Judas is\n\nthe character who ultimately sacrifices the most. \"The\n\nascetic, for the greater glory of God, degrades and\n\nmortifies the flesh; Judas did the same with the spirit.\n\nHe renounced honor, good, peace, the Kingdom of Heaven, as\n\nothers, less heroically, renounced pleasure\" (154). Borges\n\ntransforms the great Easter drama from a simple, open\n\ntriumph of the Word over the flesh to a conspiracy, a\n\nsubterranean mystery the power of which depends on its\n\nnever being solved. The co-conspirators God, Judas, and,\n\nperhaps, Jesus— are never found out; the conspiracy\n\ntheorist Runeberg is consigned to oblivion and dies of an\n\naneurysm.\n\nA Zed and Two Noughts is not the only Greenaway film\n\nrife with layers of secret, paranoiac, criminal patterns; a\n\ncatalogue of conspiracies would include examples from every\n\nGreenaway film. In Dear Phone, mysterious forces cause the\n\ntext of the printed narration to break down into profound\n\nsloppiness. In Vertical Features Remake, a conspiracy led\n\nby Gang Lion impedes the reconstruction of Tulse Luper's\n\nstructuralist film. The Falls suggests an extraterrestrial\n\nevent which mysteriously, but definitively degrades the\n\nlives of its uncomprehending victims. Mr. Neville, in The\n\nDraughtsman's Contract. is murdered by members of the\n\nnobility and every other character in the film, except\n\nperhaps the murdered Mr. Herbert, is implicated. Storley\n\nKracklite, in Bellv of an Architect, is driven to suicide\n\nby a variety of factors which includes a group of money-\n\nlaundering fascists and, perhaps, his own wife. The water-\n\ntower conspiracy of Drowning Bv Numbers. although motivated\n\nby a sincere desire to investigate the deaths of friends\n\nand relatives, is presented as a betraying and malevolent\n\ngroup, at odds with the film's heroines, the three cissie\n\n45\n\nColpitts. In The Cook, the Thief, the downtrodden rise up\n\nto trap their victim, and their leader, the wife Georgina,\n\nliterally wears a web of conspiracy.\n\nGreenaway's films suggest that all film is a criminal\n\nconspiracy. Cinema announces the impossibility of forgery\n\nwhich is also the impossibility of fidelity to a creative\n\nfigure— artist or God. The creative persona is not single,\n\nunified, inscrutable, all-powerful and omnipresent, but\n\nrather multiple, conflicted, and without motive, having\n\nvariable and undetermined powers and borders. The\n\nontological status of the out-of-control figure of the\n\nartist is in continual flux. This lack of control, this\n\nuninsurability of being, is at the core of bulimic cinema.\n\n46\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nExcess\n\nAn important feature of hysteria, both as a clinical\n\ndisorder and in the way it has been used to theorize film,\n\nis excess. This concept is also crucial to the metaphor of\n\neating disorders that I propose. Nevertheless, as Kristen\n\nThompson has noted, \"the critic is also faced with the fact\n\nthat excess tends to elude analysis\" (Thompson 133).\n\nTypically the concept of excess implies not a sufficiency,\n\nbut a superfluity. The opposite of excess is not absence,\n\nor even paucity, but moderation, a concept that has proven\n\ndifficult to quantify in terms of cinema. Although the\n\nconcept of \"excess\" is used often in film theory, no one\n\nhas ever established how much \"filmness\" is normal, against\n\nwhich standard, filmic superabundance can be read. In\n\npractice, \"excess\" frequently denotes not-enough-ness as\n\nwell as too-much-ness.\n\nIn the theory of excess posited by bulimic cinema, the\n\ninsufficiency of anorexia exists at the opposite end of a\n\ncontinuum to the excess of bulimia, but both can be\n\nidentified with the issue of control. In the clinical\n\nafflictions of anorexia (not enough) and bulimia (too\n\nmuch)— frequently exhibited sequentially— the woman's body\n\nbecomes the site of extreme fluctuations motivated by a\n\nperceived lack of control. The central anxiety: who\n\n47\n\ncontrols the woman's body? In the films of Peter\n\nGreenaway, there exist extremities of not-enough-ness and\n\ntoo-much-ness on several filmic levels such as narration,\n\nvisual design, acting and the incorporation of other arts;\n\nthe issue is: who controls the body of the film?\n\nIn the analysis that follows, I will argue that we can\n\nperceive Greenaway's films as excessive and that this\n\nexcess is related to other aspects of bulimic cinema— the\n\nlack of artistic control, confusion over the boundaries of\n\nthe art object, rejection of interpretation; consumption of\n\nother arts and anxiety about that consumption, the female\n\ngendering of the art object, and the use of structuring\n\npatterns which reject narrative. I will also examine how\n\nthis conception differs from other theories of excess, and\n\nspeculate on the reasons for this shift.\n\nDue to the nature of film, definitions of excess are\n\nparticularly difficult to articulate. There exists such a\n\nmultitude of qualities to compare, with so many variables\n\nto consider, in such a variety of contexts, that it becomes\n\nimpossible to define absolutely whether any single element\n\nis excessive or not. Because of these difficulties, I\n\npropose to start with two examples— from two of Greenaway's\n\nfilms— that are clearly excessive and arrive at some\n\nconclusions from their description. In The Bellv of an\n\nArchitect, the architect, Storley Kracklite, fears that his\n\n48\n\nwife has been poisoning him with tainted figs. In fact, he\n\nsuffers from terminal stomach cancer. He suffers as well\n\nfrom an over-identification with both the architect\n\nBoullee, whom he seeks to commemorate, and the Emperor\n\nAugustus, whom he is about to follow into death.\n\nKracklite's fear of dying manifests itself in ceaseless\n\nwandering through Rome, postcard writing, and a belligerent\n\nattitude towards all the other characters. Most\n\nobsessively, he repeatedly photocopies representations of\n\nstomachs— his own, that of the statue of Augustus, that of\n\na putative drawing of Boullee. A museum display of\n\npostcards— of Augustus and a building— shown early in the\n\nfilm, foreshadows this reproduction. In this common\n\ndisplay, there is no longer simply a statue of Augustus,\n\nbut limitless multiples of a photograph of a statue of\n\nAugustus, reduced in size, sold for a pittance, effectively\n\ndiminished. Kracklite steals one.\n\nLater in the film, after he has begun to feel the pain\n\nin his stomach, Kracklite photocopies and enlarges this\n\npostcard until it is life-sized and holds it up to his own\n\nstomach. He projects his discomfort onto the photocopy; he\n\nuses it as a map, upon which he draws the guilty figs,\n\nmarks his pain, and guides the doctor's diagnosis. This\n\nenlarged, stolen, reproduced stomach of Augustus becomes\n\nKracklite's main object of contemplation while\n\n49\n\nsimultaneously collapsing many of the film's themes. These\n\ninclude: the debased nature of the artwork as a result of\n\nreproduction, and— reinforcing the link of debasement and\n\nreproduction— the ambiguous nature of the engorged cavity.\n\nThis cavity may be a pregnancy or a cancerous stomach; it\n\nmay be Boullee's buildings or Augustus' tomb, birth or\n\ndeath, artistic inspiration or annihilation. The postcard\n\nof Augustus also demonstrates the tenuous control which can\n\nbe exerted over the artwork's circulation. In this case,\n\nthe postcard has been stolen. The original statue of\n\nAugustus has already been reproduced as a postcard in a way\n\nunanticipated and unsanctioned by its carver; now,\n\nKracklite manipulates the postcard in a way similarly\n\nunanticipated and unsanctioned by the postcard's printer.\n\nThe excessive scene— representations of a belly\n\nspewing out of a photocopying machine— is repeated\n\nthroughout the film. While Kracklite's reproductive act\n\nserves a narrative function— it demonstrates that he is\n\nworried about his stomach pain and is becoming increasingly\n\nupset— its visual impact and repetition clearly transcend\n\nthis rationale. Both in their individual manifestations\n\nand in their cumulative impact, the shots of the\n\nphotocopied bellies operate as excess.\n\nThis example of excess includes components of both\n\nform and content. An example of excess from The Cook. the\n\n50\n\nThief. His Wife and Her Lover relies more heavily on a\n\nsingle formal element: a long, lateral tracking movement.\n\nEarly in the film, the camera tracks from a parking lot,\n\nthrough the kitchen of Le Hollandais restaurant, past the\n\nentry and cloakroom, and into the restaurant's dining room.\n\nThe rooms and hallways, in their vast scale and artful\n\ndecoration, themselves provide examples of excess which\n\ncontribute to the pleasure of the camera movement. What\n\nvisual delight will the camera reveal next? Where will\n\nthis journey end?\n\nThe extended tracking shot operates inter- and intra-\n\ntextually. It will be repeated several times throughout\n\nthe film, and it visually quotes from previous Greenaway\n\nfilms— for instance, The Draughtsman's Contract— and\n\nanticipates others— Prosoero's Books. The nature of the\n\nshot signals a break with traditional cinema— Hollywood\n\ncinema— which typically avoids such an extended camera\n\nmovement. But, despite the immensity of space revealed in\n\nthe shot, the one-dimensionality of the movement evokes the\n\ntwo-dimensionality of painting rather than a space\n\nconstructed to suggest realism. The shot, in its duration,\n\nits rejection of Hollywood three-dimensional space and its\n\nrepetition within and without the film, functions as\n\nexcess.\n\n51\n\nWhere the example from Belly of an Architect is\n\nreductive and isolating, the tracking shot from The Cook.\n\nthe Thief is comprehensive and all-encompassing. Kracklite\n\nacts out a metaphor of self-absorption and inward, single,\n\nfocus: contemplating his own navel. Conversely, the mobile\n\ncamera of The Cook, the Thief, by investigating every\n\ncorner of the restaurant regardless of narrative action,\n\ndemonstrates all-inclusiveness. In their extremity, they\n\nboth operate as excess. How can we account for them?\n\nDefinitions of excess inevitably tend to be defined\n\nagainst a standard of filmness set by pre-WWII classical\n\nHollywood Cinema, whether this standard is consciously\n\ninvoked or not. A Fritz Lang film noir can be read as\n\nexcessive by virtue of its stylized sets or exaggerated\n\nlighting which exceed in some measure the classical\n\nstandard (too-much-ness). An Andrei Tarkowski drama, on\n\nthe other hand, may be excessive for the use of long takes\n\nor restrained acting styles (not-enough-ness) in comparison\n\nto the classical standard. At all times, this classical\n\nstandard is guided by a steady devotion to the development\n\nof the story. This devotion is often repeated in\n\ntheoretical accounts of excess.\n\nIn \"The Concept of Cinematic Excess\" Kristin Thompson,\n\nsynthesizing the approaches of Stephan Heath and Roland\n\nBarthes, connects excess to the materiality of film:\n\n52\n\nStyle is the use of repeated techniques\n\nwhich become characteristic of the work;\n\nthese techniques are foregrounded so that\n\nthe spectator will notice them and create\n\nconnections between their individual uses.\n\nExcess does not equal style, but the two\n\nare closely linked because they both\n\ninvolve the material aspects of the film.\n\nExcess forms no specific patterns which we\n\ncould say are characteristic of the work.\n\nBut the formal organization provided by\n\nstyle does not exhaust the material of the\n\nfilmic techniques, and a spectator's\n\nattention to style might well lead to a\n\nnoticing of excess as well. (132)\n\nIn this conception, \"material aspects of the film\" are seen\n\nin opposition to narrative or plot elements— the word of\n\nthe father— pater— pattern— plot. What is not the father's\n\nword, what is image, is the mater— material (Goux). All\n\nimagery is therefore implicated in the struggle against\n\nnarrative pattern. Since the materiality of the image\n\nalways exceeds that of the written word, all film— in its\n\nmateriality— is excess.\n\nA tension develops between narratively-motivated\n\nelements which unify— words— and excessive elements which\n\nlie outside and struggle against the narrative. Thompson\n\nfurther implies that images function differently than words\n\nin that there is less control over their deployment:\n\n[N]arrative function may justify the\n\npresence of a device, but it doesn't always\n\nmotivate the specific form that individual\n\nelement will take. Quite often, the device\n\ncould vary considerably in form and still\n\nserve its function adequately. . . .The\n\nactual choices are relatively\n\narbitrary. ...\" (135)\n\n53\n\nAlthough Thompson approaches the question of excess\n\nfrom a neo-formalist perspective, her discussion is\n\ncompatible with a psychoanalytic framework. Thompson's\n\nconception of how the material functions accords with how\n\nthe clinical disorder of hysteria has been used to\n\nconceptualize film. The hysterical symptom is not stable\n\nin its manifestations, and it doesn't fall within the\n\npatient's control. The hysterical symptom signifies\n\nthrough representation rather than through the word. It\n\nlacks, therefore, the unity, the linearity, and, most of\n\nall, the fixity of words. The inability to communicate\n\nwith words/plot characterizes those films— melodramas,\n\nwomen's films— most associated with hysterical expression\n\nin visual design and acting. The inability to communicate\n\nwith words also appears within these films; muteness is a\n\nparticularly favored hysterical symptom in the hysterical\n\nwoman's film of disease (Doane 166).\n\nHysteria is excess, which \"forms no specific\n\npatterns,\" rather than style, because style \"is the use of\n\nrepeated techniques which become characteristic of the\n\nwork.\" Through organized repetition, material aspects of\n\nthe film can express unity, wholeness, pattern. Lyotard\n\nputs this idea into economic terms:\n\nNo movement, arising from any field, is\n\ngiven to the eye-ear of the spectator for\n\nwhat it is: a simple sterile difference in\n\nan audio-visual field. Instead, every\n\n54\n\nmovement put forward sends back to\n\nsomething else, is inscribed as a plus or\n\nminus on the ledger book which is the film,\n\nis valuable because it returns to something\n\nelse, because it is thus potential return\n\nand profit. (53)\n\nThis analysis leaves open the nature of the pattern, the\n\nstructure of return which is signaled by repetition. Some\n\nelements, for example, displaying only narrative\n\nsignificance when presented singly, can be repeated to the\n\npoint of excess. Thompson suggests a pattern based on\n\nnarrative motivation \"by which the work makes its own\n\ndevices seem reasonable. At that point where motivation\n\nfails, excess begins\" (135).\n\nIn the case of Greenaway, the primacy of narration as\n\nan organizing principle is frequently called into question.\n\nIt isn't that the films lack narrative elements— often\n\nthere is too much plot. However, organizing patterns,\n\nother than narration, typically exert more control over the\n\nfilms' development. Such patterns include: the numbers\n\nfrom one to an hundred; the alphabet; the seven hills of\n\nRome; the twelve drawings of Mr. Neville; the first four\n\nletters of a last name.\n\nIn Anatomy of Criticism. Northrup Frye posits a\n\ncategory of fiction which, like a Greenaway film,\n\nprivileges taxonomy as an organizing principle. P. Adams\n\nSitney calls Greenaway's The Falls (1979) \"an instance of\n\nthis rare genre in its purest and most extravagant form\"\n\n55\n\n(45). Like Thompson, Frye analyzes the relationship of the\n\nwork's materiality to narrative drive as a way of drawing\n\ndistinctions between forms of prose. Frye doesn't describe\n\na perpetual tension between the narrative— unified and\n\nstable— and the material manifestation— diffuse and\n\nchangeable. Instead, he uses the quality of foregrounded\n\nmateriality as a way of defining a category.\n\nSeparating and dividing critical categories, Frye\n\nargues, makes it possible to properly appreciate a work in\n\na way not possible with a monolithic category of fiction in\n\nwhich all works come to be judged by the standards of the\n\nmost dominant category (novel). In addition to novels,\n\nromances, and confessions, Frye identifies what he at first\n\ncalls Menippean satire: extroverted and intellectual;\n\n\"deal[ing] less with people as such than with mental\n\nattitudes\" (309); most likely to be critically\n\nmisunderstood; and least likely to conform to narrative\n\nexpectations.\n\nAt its most concentrated the Menippean\n\nsatire presents us with a vision of the\n\nworld in terms of a single intellectual\n\npattern. The intellectual structure built\n\nup from the story makes for violent\n\ndislocations in the customary logic of\n\nnarrative. . . . (310)\n\nFrye suggests Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy as the\n\nparadigmatic example of this category and adopts the word\n\n\"anatomy\"— defined as a dissection or analysis— to replace\n\n56\n\n\"Menippean satire.\" The significance that Frye gives this\n\nform, and a telling example, is provided by the title of\n\nhis own critical work: Anatomy of Criticism. By choosing\n\n\"anatomy\" to designate the form, Frye connects the body to\n\nthe tendency to \"expand into an encyclopedic farrago\"\n\n(311), a connection on which Greenaway obsesses.\n\nThe Falls is such a collection: encyclopedic in\n\nlength— 185 minutes— and a farrago of references—\n\ni\n\nHitchcock's The Birds, avant-garde animation, documentary\n\ncinema, the French Revolution, Genesis, Greenaway's other\n\nfilms past and future, etc. The imaginary project which\n\nThe Falls pretends to depict is both isolating and\n\ncomprehensive. The film consists of ninety-two, almost\n\ncompletely discrete, segments which provide a capsule\n\nsketch of 92 \"victims\" of the VUE (Violent Unknown Event).\n\nThe subjects of the film's study, a portentous narrator\n\ninforms us, have been chosen because the first four letters\n\nof their last names are F-A-L-L. A conceit of the film is\n\nthat the chosen letters are purely arbitrary, although of\n\ncourse the word they form clearly evokes Adam and Eve's\n\nfall from grace. The film studies the effects of the VUE\n\nthrough changes traced on the bodies and speech of their\n\nvictims. They assume some physical characteristics of\n\nbirds and begin to speak in idiosyncratic languages. In\n\n57\n\ncontradistinction to Adam and Eve, they realize that they\n\nhave been rendered immortal.\n\nGreenaway provides another catalogue of bodies in his\n\nshort film Death in the Seine. Twenty-six corpses\n\nrepresent all the bodies pulled from the Seine during the\n\nFrench Revolution. Like the victims of the VUE, these\n\nvictims are isolated through a peculiarity: the discovery\n\nof the corpse. But the video also demonstrates\n\ninclusiveness. While the camera examines each naked and\n\ninert character, a voice-over narration lists every thing\n\nthat is known about the person and how they came to be\n\nfound dead in a river.\n\nThe Falls and Death in the Seine synthesize isolation\n\nand comprehensiveness, attributes that we have identified\n\nseparately in the two examples with which we began. These\n\nopposing qualities are basic to the anatomy which strives\n\nto be both discrete and all-encompassing.\n\nCertainly, Greenaway could be that Menippean satirist,\n\nwho,\n\ndealing with intellectual themes and\n\nattitudes, shows his exuberance in\n\nintellectual ways, by piling up an enormous\n\nmass of erudition about his theme or in\n\noverwhelming his pedantic targets with an\n\navalanche of their own jargon. (Frye 311)\n\nThe anatomy, through its very name, implies a taxonomy.\n\nAside from \"overwhelming his pedantic targets,\" to what\n\n58\n\npurpose does the Menippean satirist put this \"vision of the\n\nworld in terms of a single intellectual pattern\"?\n\nTaxonomy, in Greenaway's films, is associated with the\n\nappearance of excess and motored by a demonstration of\n\ncontrol. One of the most powerful examples of taxonomy and\n\ncontrol can be seen in the story of Adam and Eve, a story\n\nto which Greenaway, in films such as The Falls and The\n\nCook, the Thief, makes frequent and explicit reference. It\n\nis interesting to note Adam's first chore:\n\nSo out of the ground the Lord God formed\n\nevery beast of the field and every bird of\n\nthe air, and brought them to the man to see\n\nwhat he would call them; and whatever the\n\nman called every living creature, that was\n\nits name. (Genesis 2:19)\n\nHaving been granted dominion over \"every creeping thing\n\nthat creeps upon the earth\" (Genesis 1:26), Adam constructs\n\na taxonomy. As Lacan points out, this operation of naming\n\nassumes a dual function:\n\nThus the symbol manifests itself first of\n\nall as the murder of the thing, and this\n\ndeath constitutes in the subject the\n\neternalization of his desire. (104)\n\nAdam names to control all other entities, to fix them\n\n(although they might be dead, decayed, or debased in the\n\nprocess). This action is at once limiting— it reduces the\n\nobjects in the world to a single intellectual idea— and\n\ninfinite— it is capable of including everything and\n\nanything.\n\n59\n\nBulimic cinema disconnects what Adam's taxonomy\n\ncollapses. Anorexia reduces life to a single intellectual\n\nidea: avoiding fat. Bulimia, on the other hand, can\n\nencompass anything and everything, although all substances\n\nmust eventually be expelled.\n\nIn this conception of bulimic cinema and in Frye's\n\nanatomy, the taxonomy is traced on a body, the symbolic\n\nbody of the work of art. Who names this body? Who\n\ncontrols what can enter and what must be expelled, where\n\nit begins and leaves off, who has access and who is denied?\n\nIn Bellv of an Architect and The Cook, the Thief, the\n\nfigure of the artist has been undermined to the point\n\nwhere he can assert himself on none of these questions.\n\nThe architect Kracklite loses his exhibition and his baby\n\nto the fascist moneyman Caspasian. The cook Richard can\n\nmake mischief in the kitchen, but the loquacious moneyman\n\nSpica rules the dining room. Good intentions and good\n\ntaste don't accomplish much. In bulimic cinema, control\n\ncan only be achieved in extremity and outside the realms of\n\nlogic and capital.\n\nWhat are the organizing patterns of Bellv and The\n\nCook, the Thief? We might say, a love triangle and a\n\nrevenge drama, but the material in the films which lie\n\noutside these plots can't productively be classified as\n\nstylistic excess. Systems other than plot, taxonomies and\n\n60\n\nlists, create their own single-minded meaning. With these\n\nsystems in mind, we can more interestingly consider some\n\nfeatures which occur in Greenaway's films as well as many\n\nother contemporary films. These include: characters\n\nlacking psychological plausibility; non-resolution of story\n\ncomplications; a deficiency of plot motivation for formal\n\nelements; a breakdown of borders between the film and other\n\nartworks; and, finally, a general resistance of the film to\n\ninterpretation. These are all components of what I would\n\ncall bulimic cinema.\n\nThe paucity of the organizing pattern may seem opposed\n\nto the exorbitance of the images, but both function as\n\nexcess and, like the problems of eating disorders, together\n\nthey lead us to the issue of control. These films react to\n\nthe barriers to achieving control without the benefit of\n\nwords, and without the appeal to reason and meaning,\n\nfixedness and finitude, that a reliance on words implies.\n\n61\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nFilm as Body\n\nThe body, as a symbol of organization, is crucial not\n\nonly to Greenaway's films, but to the concept of\n\npostmodernity. Frye has suggested that the literary form\n\n\"anatomy\" links the body metaphorically to a literary\n\norganizational system. George Lakoff, a cognitive\n\nlinguist, argues that the body functions not only as a\n\nmetaphor but as the basis of metaphors. These metaphors of\n\nthe body are often realized more vividly and\n\nstraightforwardly than human bodies themselves whose\n\ndepiction and significance is often masked. Body\n\nmetaphors, according to Lakoff, also structure how we\n\norganize and think about other objects in the world— all\n\nother objects— but frequently in an unconscious or obscured\n\nmanner.\n\nThe significance of the body is central to Greenaway's\n\nfilms, and he presents issues of the body on different\n\nlevels. Greenaway depicts the body as metaphor: as a\n\nsystem of organization and as an analogy to art objects.\n\nIn this chapter I will consider how the postmodern body\n\noperates as the basis of expanding conceptual metaphors.\n\nBut Greenaway also depicts actual human bodies; this\n\ndepiction emphasizes the materiality of bodies through the\n\nrevelation of nakedness and through an emphasis on physical\n\n62\n\nprocesses— particularly eating (with its digestive\n\ncorollary excreting). These concepts— eating and\n\nnakedness— are both shown to intersect with sexuality, but\n\nunlike their existence within a psychoanalytic account,\n\nthey are not subsumed within or explained by sexuality. In\n\nGreenaway's films, eating and nakedness suggest a nexus of\n\nmeanings including knowledge, mortality and exclusion. The\n\nsecond and third sections of this chapter will consider\n\nthese meanings through the concepts of eating and nakedness\n\nin more detail.\n\nUsing Lakoff's discussion of metaphoric thought, we\n\ncan better understand the implications of naming an\n\nartist's output his or her \"corpus,\" body of work\" or\n\n\"oeuvre.\" A body or bodies are always implicated when this\n\nmetaphor is applied to objects. What is of interest in\n\npostmodernity is how explicit the embodiment of the work\n\nhas become. The corporality of the postmodern art object\n\ncontrasts with the disembodied nature of the modern art\n\nobject. Although it is often distinguished by a\n\nforegrounding of the materials of production, the modern\n\nart object transfigures those attributes associated with\n\nmateriality: mortality, transience, mutability,\n\ncontingency. The brush stroke, the flatness, the color of\n\npainting; the tone, the tempo, the repetition of music; the\n\n63\n\nzoom, the grain, the sprocket of cinema: these qualities\n\nare isolated and abstracted, propelled into transcendence.\n\nI will argue, conversely, that the body of\n\npostmodernity is not only explicitly mortal and mutable,\n\nbut has assumed the characteristics of the only body that\n\nthere ever has been in Western representation— the woman's\n\nbody: plural, conflicted, inconsistent, threatening, naked\n\nand eating.\n\nEXPANDING METAPHORS\n\nIn Women. Fire and Dangerous Things. Lakoff\n\ncontrasts a traditional view, which he terms objectivist,\n\nwith a cognitive approach, which he calls experiential\n\nrealism. Lakoff tries to deny a totalizing relativism,\n\nwhich might be suggested by his rejection of objectivism,\n\nby noting some shared characteristics between the two\n\nviews:\n\n(a) a commitment to the existence of the\n\nreal world, (b) a recognition that reality\n\nplaces constraints on concepts, (c) a\n\nconception of truth that goes beyond mere\n\ninternal coherence, and (d) a commitment to\n\nthe existence of stable knowledge of the\n\nworld. (Women. Fire xv)\n\nDespite these similarities, Lakoff argues that the\n\ndifference between the two approaches articulates a\n\nsubstantial philosophical rift. One of the main\n\n64\n\ndistinguishing characteristics between the two views is the\n\nsystem of category formation:\n\nOn the objectivist view, things are in the\n\nsame category if and only if they have\n\ncertain properties in common. Those\n\nproperties are necessary and sufficient\n\nconditions for defining a category. (xiv)\n\nAlternatively, Lakoff's experiential realism, or\n\nexperientialism, depends on the idea that \"thought\n\nfundamentally grows out of embodiment. . . . reason is made\n\npossible by the body. . . \" (xv).\n\nThe capacity to reason is usually taken as\n\ndefining what human beings are and as\n\ndistinguishing us from other things that\n\nare alive. If we understand reason as\n\nbeing disembodied, then our bodies are only\n\nincidental to what we are. (xvi)\n\nLakoff rejects this disembodiment, viewing the human body\n\nas a central determinant of our conception of the world.\n\nAlong with the body, Lakoff would add imagination—\n\nmetaphor, metonymy, and mental imagery— as elements which\n\nare vital to categorization, but which are often left out\n\nof the process of reason.\n\nAs Lakoff makes clear, this argument has profound\n\nimplications for the project of categorization, a project\n\nwhich is inseparable from reason. \"To change the concept\n\nof category itself is to change our understanding of the\n\nworld\" (9). What also changes is the possibility of\n\nexpressing control over things in the world. An\n\nobjectivist approach to the problem of categories allows\n\n65\n\nsome validity to Adam's project of domination through\n\nnaming and categorizing. However, in Lakoff's cognitive\n\nview, no category exists absolutely, even within so-called\n\nobjective scientific language. What is a zebra? Lakoff\n\nwonders. In an argument based on the conflicting standards\n\nof biologists, Lakoff concludes that \"There is no true\n\nbiological category that consists of all and only the\n\nzebras\" (119).\n\nLike Lakoff, Greenaway sees the problem of\n\ncategorization as basic. The characters in Greenaway's A\n\nZed and Two Noughts are also stymied in their attempts to\n\ncategorize zebras. What is a zebra? A black animal with\n\nwhite stripes, a white animal with black stripes, a black\n\nand white animal for a special zoo, a type of horse, an\n\nobject of scientific study, a sexual partner, a suicide\n\nmachine? How is it possible to control the animals in this\n\ncategory, or lack of a category, of zebras? In A Zed and\n\nTwo Noughts, animals persistently find their way out of\n\ntheir assigned enclosures— through rescue, theft, and\n\ndeath— and humans find their way in. Each character\n\neventually forms a personal menagerie based on some\n\npersonal idea: stolen black and white animals; animals in\n\npornographic stories; animals in children's songs; dead and\n\ndecomposing animals. Your zoo is a reflection of your\n\nself. Oliver says of the child Beta's \"brand new\n\n66\n\ntaxonomy\": \"Only an innocent would put a spider and a fly\n\nin the same cage because they were both brown.\" Categories\n\nfor Lakoff and for Greenaway— like zoo cages— are variable\n\nand permeable, if not completely unstable; they are absurd,\n\nnot universally accepted, artificial.\n\nIf categories can't be fixed through an objectivist\n\nview, how are they formed? Lakoff's model remains\n\nfundamentally based on the human body. He argues that all\n\ncultures refer to basic-level categories which are \"human­\n\nsized\" (51) and which have \"no objective status external to\n\nhuman beings\" (38). Abstraction arises out of body\n\nexperience in two ways: \"By metaphorical projection from\n\nthe domain of the physical to abstract domains\" and \"By the\n\nprojection from basic-level categories to superordinate and\n\nsubordinate categories\" (268). The body becomes the\n\nordering element of human reason: \"It must be assumed that\n\nour bodily experience itself has structure, that it is not\n\nan unstructured mush\" (267).\n\nThere are two apparent problems with this conception:\n\nnot only does it seem obvious to the point of\n\nmeaninglessness, there seems to be a dangerous appeal to\n\nbiologism. If we assign terms to concepts and objects\n\nbased on how our bodies are oriented in space— upright\n\nwhile healthy and vital, prone in sickness and death— what\n\nroom is there for cultural determination or artistic\n\n67\n\nmanipulation? The interest of the concept arises when we\n\nconsider how these metaphors extend beyond the body and\n\nform connections which are not physically determined— the\n\n\"metaphorical projection from the domain of the physical to\n\nabstract domains.\" Extended bodily experiences, for\n\ninstance \"up\" and \"down,\" can create new categories of\n\nperhaps strange conceptual bedfellows. Many of these\n\nextensions are not obvious, but are embedded in a system\n\ncharacterized by obviousness. Connections between\n\nconcepts— categories— are naturalized through the body as a\n\nsystem of organization.\n\nThe problem of categories is one that also pervades\n\nGreenaway's work. I have already mentioned the zoo cages\n\nin flux of A Zed and Two Noughts. This film continually\n\nevokes evolution, the theory of which seriously confounds\n\nprevious systems of categorization. Organisms in an\n\nevolutionary scheme are all part of a vast continuum from\n\nwhich one might distinguish branches, but never true\n\nisolated character. \"The very nature of the evolutionary\n\nprocess ensures that the limits we set on each group of\n\nrelated species are arbitrary\" (Futuyma 59). In this\n\nrespect, the possibility of a creative, omniscient God—\n\nwhose categories could be, theoretically, clearly\n\ndetermined— -is challenged on yet another front.\n\nGreenaway demonstrates that even as it is impossible\n\nto categorize all objects in the material world, it is as\n\nimpossible to assign stable categorization to subsets of\n\nobjects. The categories of individuals, for instance,\n\nwould seem to be obvious, but Greenaway consistently blurs\n\ntheir boundaries. In Drowning Bv Numbers, three women bear\n\nthe same name— Cissie Colpitts— and use the same modus\n\noperandi— drowning a husband. The character of Ariel, in\n\nProspero's Books, is played simultaneously by four actors—\n\nidentically dressed in red diapers and curly blond wigs,\n\nbut varying in age from a small boy to an adult man. In\n\nThe Falls, characters who have lost their identities are\n\nadvised to choose a new one from a group of ten which\n\nincludes David's Marat in the bathtub, Tippi Hendren in The\n\nBirds and Greenaway's own recurring orthinologist character\n\nTulse Luper.\n\nAnother problematic category of categories is the set\n\nof works of art. In Greenaway's films, a single\n\ncharacter's consciousness never determines every aspect of\n\nany art object depicted. The category of a particular art\n\nobject is permeable, variable and subjective. Mr. Neville\n\nof The Draughtsman's Contract includes in his drawings\n\nobjects which are not part of his design and which\n\neventually betray him by their presence. These\n\nincriminating objects have invaded the limits of his\n\n69\n\ndrawings. The death of the artist Neville at the end of\n\nthe film reflects the lack of power to which this incursion\n\nattests. In Prosperous Books. Greenaway's primary\n\ndivergence from Shakespeare's Tempest provides another\n\nexample of how art works can exist with indeterminate\n\nborders. The books Prospero treasures are re-created as\n\nbooks of infinitude: the book of colors, of mirrors, of\n\nmovement, of minerals. These books include all the\n\ninfinite possibilities of the category they represent.\n\nWithin the finitude of a book, of course, this is an\n\nimpossibility. All books imply a selection and separation\n\nperformed by a reasoning consciousness. Prospero's books\n\ncould not have been written by any artist other than an\n\ninfinite God.\n\nGreenaway's obsession with taxonomy intersects with an\n\nobsession with bodily processes through what Lakoff has\n\nsuggested as the determining element of organization: the\n\nhuman body. Greenaway explicitly invokes the same concepts\n\nof bodily experience which Lakoff has identified as a\n\nstructural constant. However, Greenaway's use of the body\n\nas system of organization is never absolute and is always\n\nfiltered through a tradition of Western culture. It is\n\nthrough the body that Greenaway perpetually re-plays the\n\nconfusion of categories which are arbitrary, absurd,\n\nvariable and, ultimately, disintegrating.\n\n70\n\nThe metaphor of up and down and the metaphor of the\n\nbody as container, are, according to Lakoff, two principal\n\nstructuring concepts that extend, or chain, through human\n\nconceptual systems forming their own fluctuating categories\n\nof meaning. Lakoff and Mark Johnson describe a cluster of\n\nimplications that attend the concepts of up and down:\n\nhappy is up, sad is down; conscious is up, unconscious is\n\ndown; health and life are up, sickness and death are down;\n\nhaving control or force is up, being subject to control or\n\nforce is down, good is up, bad is down; virtue is up,\n\ndepravity is down; rational is up, emotional is down\n\n(Metaphors We Live By 15).\n\nGreenaway acknowledges the Western significance of the\n\nup and down orientational metaphor through his use of a\n\nspecific image: Mantegna's painting of the Dead Christ.\n\nGreenaway consciously invokes the painting: briefly in\n\nDrowning By Numbers: as the main visual structuring element\n\nin Death in the Seine: and again in Prospero's Books.\n\nMantegna's Christ lies on his back with his feet\n\nprominently in the foreground. Because of the artist's\n\ncelebrated foreshortening technique, the feet appear large\n\nand in the foreground, more prominent than the head. This\n\nChrist, represented during the period after death, but\n\nbefore resurrection, expresses the human, earthly aspect of\n\nHis dual nature— the capability to suffer and die— through\n\nhis foot. To assume this capability Christ had to descend\n\nfrom heaven to earth. He will descend further, into hell,\n\nand will eventually re-ascend. A chain of associations are\n\nset in motion by these holy feet, a chain that ends in\n\ndeath.\n\nIn his 1929 essay on \"The Big Toe\" Georges Bataille\n\ncomments similarly on the significance of the lower body\n\nparts:\n\nAlthough within the body blood flows in\n\nequal quantities from high to low and from\n\nlow to high, there is a bias in favor of\n\nthat which elevates itself, and human life\n\nis erroneously seen as an elevation. The\n\ndivision of the universe into subterranean\n\nhell and perfectly pure heaven is an\n\nindelible conception, mud and darkness\n\nbeing the principles of evil as light and\n\ncelestial space are the principles of good:\n\nwith their feet in mud but their heads more\n\nor less in light, men obstinately imagine a\n\ntide that will permanently elevate them,\n\nnever to return, into pure space. Human\n\nlife entails, in fact, the rage of seeing\n\noneself as a back and forth movement from\n\nrefuse to the ideal, and directed against\n\nan organ as base as the foot. (20)\n\nIn Death in the Seine (1989) this back and forth movement\n\nis articulated through a camera movement. This short film,\n\nlike The Falls, is segmented into capsule sketches of\n\nindividuals connected by a single criteria. The conceit in\n\nthis case is that the 26 characters profiled, or rather\n\ntheir corpses, were pulled from the Seine during the French\n\nRevolution. The camera tracks up their naked bodies from\n\nthe foot to the head— from refuse to the ideal— as the\n\n72\n\nvideo recounts what little is known about their lives and\n\nthe manner in which they died. These individuals\n\nthemselves demonstrate the oscillation from refuse to the\n\nideal. Found floating, discarded, unnamed and unmourned,\n\nas refuse in the river, they are reconstructed as the\n\nideal, the human individual which is named, unique, and\n\nsocially connected. The video functions as memorial, a\n\nremembrance of the dead. This in itself is an\n\nimmortalization or, in terms of up and down, an elevation.\n\nDeath in the Seine suggests those memorial photographs of\n\ndead bodies which sought to arrest the body at the cusp of\n\ndecay. The agency of that arrest: representation and\n\nremembrance.\n\nThe French Revolution, a prevalent theme in\n\nGreenaway's work, here, as the film's setting, provides\n\nanother exa"
