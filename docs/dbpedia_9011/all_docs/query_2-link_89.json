        "text": "Navigating holiday conversations can be challenging in even the best of years. In a year of a pandemic that has dominated our lives and interactions with others, it may feel even more so.\n\nWhat is there to talk about with family, friends, and acquaintances this year? How can we meaningfully engage in yet another video call, or make new conversation among our small, in-house pods?\n\nWhen the goal is connection—and it often is, especially for those struggling with the isolation of an eating disorder—the topics of conversation ought to be thoughtful and appropriate.\n\nAs an eating disorder treatment organization, we often recommend what not to talk about in social settings: food, diet, body, weight, and appearance. For those struggling with eating disorders or disordered eating, these food- and body-centric comments are often highly triggering. They exacerbate eating disorder thoughts and feelings, sparking urges to restrict, binge, purge, or engage in other disordered behaviors. They serve to disconnect those struggling with food or body concerns from the present moment.\n\nInstead of small talk about holiday food, weight changes, and/or diets planned, we hope you and your loved ones can engage this year in conversations of connection. To that end, we’ve prepared 15 conversation-starters or topic-changers to help steer your holiday dialogue in a safe, nurturing direction. Use them to initiate or redirect conversations in order to respect and protect those currently experiencing or recovering from an eating disorder.\n\nWhat is everyone’s favorite holiday/winter tradition?\n\nWhat is the best holiday gift you have ever given and/or received?\n\nWhich holiday songs do people enjoy—and which make them cringe?\n\nWhich holiday movie is a must-see every year?\n\nWhat does everyone remember about the holidays as a child?\n\nIf you could instantly add anyone to this video call (or home dinner table), who would it be and why?\n\nReal or artificial tree—and white lights or colored ones?\n\nWhat trip would you most like to take once it’s safe to do so?\n\nWhat is everyone most proud of this past year?\n\nWhat shows, movies, music, or podcasts have kept people entertained lately?\n\nHas anyone picked up any new hobbies?\n\nWho has a funny video call moment to share?\n\nWho has a pet to show us?\n\nAny bizarre quarantine purchases to report?\n\nWhat is everyone most looking forward to in the year ahead?\n\nThis holiday season and always, recovery should be a top priority for those struggling with and healing from eating disorders. If you are supporting someone with an eating disorder this year, consider these suggestions in addition to these conversation topics. For more guidance on navigating the holidays in recovery, check out this post and this podcast episode."
