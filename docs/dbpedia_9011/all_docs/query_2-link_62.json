A good sports nutrition program provides the fuel athletes need to improve their performance and meet their goals. In our sports nutrition clinic we see athletes of all ages serving pee wees to pros and all athletes in between.\n\nI have experience at all levels of sports to include team and individual sports. In my professional life, I worked for the Houston Texans for 12 years and the Houston Ballet for 15 years. I am starting my fifth year for the Houston Astros. I am also proud to be part of the team taking care of the Rice Owls. I enjoy taking the science of sports nutrition and translating it to the food you eat. We have the ability to do advanced body composition measures at Texas Children's Sports Medicine using a BODPOD.\n\nMy current research interests have been in the area of vitamin D deficiency in athletes and the modification of body composition.\n\nWebsites\n\nSelected Publications\n\nWillard SG, Anding RH, Winstead DK \"Nutritional counseling as an adjunct to psychotherapy in bulimia treatment..\" Psychosomatics. 1983 Jun;24(6):545-7, 550-1.
