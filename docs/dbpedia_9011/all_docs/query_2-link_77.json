        "text": "JRSM News and Events\n\nDawsey slated to give annual Norm Brewer Lecture March 13\n\nJosh Dawsey\n\n(Feb. 27, 2024) The University of Memphis Journalism and Strategic Media faculty and students are invited to attend the 12th annual Norm Brewer Lecture on March 13 in the Maxine A. Smith University Center Ballroom A (320A) on campus.\n\nJosh Dawsey, who is a political enterprise and investigations reporter for The Washington Post, will give this year’s lecture. Dawsey was part of The Post team that won the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its coverage of the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nBefore joining The Post staff in 2017, Dawsey covered the White House for Politico.\n\nWhile covering the White House, Dawsey won the White House Correspondents Association’s Award for Deadline Reporting in back-to-back years, 2018 and 2019.\n\nDawsey began his career as a reporter with The Wall Street Journal covering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nThe event is sponsored by the UofM Department of Journalism and Strategic Media in honor of Memphis journalist Norm Brewer. The evening will begin with a reception at 5:30 p.m. before the lecture at 6 p.m. The event is free and open to the public.\n\n- Aaliyah Brown\n\nJRSM students in Nashville\n\n(Jan. 18, 2024) University of Memphis journalism students Stevie Paige and Symone Maxwell join students from nine other Tennessee universities for Gannett’s Tennessee Journalism Academy, held in Nashville Jan. 9-11.\n\nTaylor Ackerman joins permanent JRSM faculty as assistant professor of practice\n\nTaylor Ackerman\n\n(Oct. 6, 2023) Professor Taylor Ackerman has joined the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media as an assistant professor of practice in the fall 2023 semester as part of the public relations faculty.\n\nAlthough the position is new for Ackerman, she is not new to the department. She earned her Master of Arts in Journalism and Strategic Media in the spring of 2021from the University of Memphis, and she previously taught for three years both an adjunct professor and a visiting professor in the JRSM Department.\n\nPrior to joining the JRSM faculty, Ackerman worked as a marketing and public relations manager for Aloha Pools. She earned her BA in the JRSM department in 2016.\n\nAckerman said she wanted to continue in the department because of the mentorship she received in being part of the department.\n\n“People are so positive and inviting here,” she said. “Our department is special in the fact that it really does get our students ready for their career. We really do make a difference here.”\n\nSince joining the faculty as assistant professor of practice, Ackerman has pioneered the construction of multiple undergraduate public relations courses, including Intro to Strategic Media, Ethics and Advocacy and Event Planning.\n\nWith this award, the department plans to roll out more diversity-oriented programs in the coming academic year, Arant said.\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nFirst research colloquium focuses on the media’s connection to vaccine hesitancy\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Assistant Professor\n\nAmanda Bradshaw\n\n(Oct. 2, 2023) University of Mississippi Assistant Professor Amanda Bradshaw kicked off the fall JRSM graduate student colloquium series on Sept. 19 with a presentation on the influence of social media and anti-vaccine documentaries on vaccine hesitancy.\n\nBradshaw discussed three of her recent academic studies, the first focusing on how anti-vaccine advocates influence questioning pregnant, first-time, and new mothers on Facebook. The second study analyzed the documentary series Vaccines Revealed, and the third explored the effect that the anti-vaccine propaganda video “Vaxxed” had on college students’ opinions on the MMR vaccine.\n\n“A strong need exists to preach to the choir,” Bradshaw said. “Positively reinforcing pro-vaccine decisions, and not taking it for granted that people are just going to vaccinate based on recommendation or the fact that they’ve done it before.”\n\nBradshaw is an assistant professor of integrated marketing communications, and her research centers on the impact that social network interactions have on maternal health decision-making.\n\nMuch of her research focuses on vaccine hesitancy, which is the inclination to delay or even totally avoid vaccinations for themselves and their children. Vaccine hesitancy has major implications for public health, Bradshaw said.\n\nThe JRSM graduate student colloquium series is conducted each semester to connect students with researchers. It continues at 4 p.m. Oct. 11 and Nov. 8.\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nJRSM Department recognized with national award for its diversity, equity\n\n(Oct. 2, 2023) Journalism and Strategic Media Department Chair David Arant accepted an award with national significance for the department’s efforts promoting diversity and equity during a Sept. 20 ceremony at the UC River Room.\n\nPresenting the award on behalf of the Association of Educators in Journalism and Mass Communication was Professor Deb Aikat of the University of North Carolina, president of the association.\n\n\"Fifteen years ago, we started the AEJMC Diversity Award. I have lost a lot of friends because it is so competitive, and this year was no different,” Aikat said. “There was an intense competition, and the University of Memphis Department of Journalism and Strategic Media was above everyone else.\"\n\nThe award aims to highlight academic departments making significant strides in diversity and inclusion. Aikat said the department has led initiatives to foster a more inclusive environment and to offer courses and workshops focusing on diverse narratives and voices within journalism.\n\nThe ceremony was part of the department’s annual Freedom of Information Congress event sponsored by student chapters of the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nDuring the award ceremony, Professor Emeritus Otis Sanford discussed the importance of diversity in journalism education.\n\n“Making the Case for Diversity isn’t just a slogan; it’s a mission,” Sanford said.\n\nThis is not the JRSM department’s first rodeo in pushing the envelope for diversity, Sanford said. Over the past few years, the department has implemented programs aimed at promoting diversity, from scholarships for underrepresented students to organizing public lectures that address the challenges of an ever-diversifying media landscape.\n\nAlso participating in the ceremony that attracted about 70 people was student Redding Jackson, president of the Society of Professional Journalists, who introduced Sanford.\n\nWith this award, the department plans to roll out more diversity-oriented programs in the coming academic year, Arant said.\n\n- Kittie Baldwin\n\nFreedom of Information Congress on Thursday to make the case for diversity\n\n(Sept. 19, 2023) Journalism and Strategic Media students and faculty are invited to attend the 35th annual Freedom of Information Congress at 5 p.m. Thursday in the University Center River Room on campus.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Otis Sanford, who served 12 years as the JRSM Department Hardin Chair of Excellence before his retirement in the spring, will discuss “Making the Case for Diversity” starting at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe event is sponsored by the U of Memphis Society of Professional Journalists and National Association of Black Journalists chapters.\n\nThe event also celebrates the JRSM department for receiving the 2023 Equity and Diversity Award from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. AEJMC President Deb Aikat from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill will present the Equity and Diversity Award to Department Chair David Arant.\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nJRSM students encouraged to participate in national public relations conference\n\n(Sept. 15, 2023) An” ICONIC” national event is being hosted by the University of Memphis’ Public Relations Student Society of America Chapter on Oct. 13 to 17 at Nashville’s Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center.\n\n“This event transcends ordinary conferences,” said Oakley Weddle, conference director for PRSSA. “I have designed an event tailored to today’s strategic communicators. Get ready to elevate your networking, learning, and industry connections.”\n\nSome of the companies that will be represented at the 2023 ICON Conference include Amazon, Delta, Lyft and The New York Times, Weddle said. The saver registration deadline is Sept. 8. The conference is a great opportunity for any media professional, and it allows students to connect with potential employers.\n\nThe chapter is seeking volunteers to attend at a reduced rate and encourages participants to register before the saver rate ends. The student registration rate is $360 for PRSSA members and $410 for non-members.\n\nThe Graduate Student Organization offers travel funds for events such as ICON, Weddle said. The priority deadline for the funds is also Sept. 8.\n\nThe U of M chapter was chosen to host the event back in January, and the group has been planning since that time.\n\nMore information is available at the U of M PRSSA website.\n\n- Kittie Baldwin\n\nDepartment welcomes three students from Mainz, Germany, for fall semester\n\n(Sept. 15, 2023) The Department of Journalism and Strategic Media welcomed three German students into the program for the fall 2023 semester as part of its longstanding exchange program with the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz.\n\nLennard Hirsch, 25; Paula Hütten, 22; and Celine Keller, 22; all study communications at their home university. Both Hirsch and Hütten are majoring in film studies while Keller majors in communication science.\n\nWhile at in the JRSM Department, the exchange students are taking several courses which are more practical than they expected. Both Hirsch and Keller are enrolled in Broadcast Reporting with Professor Chalise Macklin.\n\n“I really, really like that,” Hirsch said. “It’s more practical than I’m used to. It tries to prepare you for your job search, and that’s really new to me. … I really enjoy that.”\n\nKeller also said she is getting plenty of practical experience in her courses.\n\n“It’s also nice because it gives you a lot of work references,” Keller said. “And I’m getting better at speaking in front of the camera.”\n\nKeller said she plans to become a political foreign correspondent and said that her time abroad in the United States will aid her.\n\n“I think that studying abroad is a great way to experience living in another country, trying to adapt to another culture and understand the flow of information in that country,” she said. “You also get to know the people here, but you also get to know how journalism works in the United States.”\n\nBoth Hirsch and Hütten said their goal is to get into the film industry post-graduation. Hütten plans to become a camera operator while Hirsch focuses on documentary filmmaking.\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nGrad Student Social a success after a three-year hiatus\n\n(Sept. 15, 2023) JRSM faculty members hosted the annual graduate student social on Sept. 6 at RP Tracks to kick off the fall 2023 semester.\n\nThe function brought in 13 attendees, a group comprised of graduate faculty, students and friends of the department. The group gathered for food, drinks and conversation — with attendees meeting in person for the first time, as many students operate exclusively online.\n\nThe 2023 social marked the first year of the event’s continuation since its cancelation last year because of a mass shooting and the previous two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“It was great that we could get together finally for our graduates and faculty to get to know each other,” said JRSM Graduate Director Tom Hrach. “Our goal is to make our students always feel welcome, and we are planning other such events later in the semester.”\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nDepartment welcomes new faculty member with interest in public interest communication\n\nJasper Fessman\n\n(Aug. 28, 2023) Jasper Fessmann has joined the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media as an assistant professor in the fall 2023 semester as part of the faculty teaching public relations.\n\nFessmann has a doctorate in Mass Communication from the University of Florida, and he previously taught at West Virginia University’s Reed College of Media. Fessmann primarily conducts research that explores public interest communications. He also explores areas such as international public relations and crisis communications.\n\nOutside of academia, Fessmann has more than 15 years of experience in the field of international public relations, having owned his own public relations firm in his home-country of Germany.\n\nThrough his work in public relations, Fessmann gained the opportunity to work with high profile figures including former German First Lady Doris Schröder-Köpf and former Russian President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nSince joining the university, Fessmann said that he feels excited about his new position in the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media.\n\n“I love Memphis,” Fessmann said. “The food is great, and everybody has been really nice. This is the place I want to be.”\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nKena Price joins the department as administrative associate in July\n\nKena Price\n\n(Aug. 28, 2023) The Department of Journalism and Strategic Media welcomed Kena Price as the department’s new administrative associate on July 10.\n\nAs administrative associate, Price is the key person running the department and assisting with journalism and strategic media students.\n\nPrice received her Bachelor of Arts in business administration from the University of Memphis and her Master of Business in Administration from Strayer University. Price also has more than 20 years of combined experience in the areas of accounting, banking, finance and entrepreneurship. Prior to joining the department, she owned and operated a childcare center, in addition to acting as the director of operations at her local church.\n\nSince joining the department, Price said that she is looking forward to helping the department grow, and that she enjoys seeing her fellow faculty members do the same.\n\n“Journalism and Strategic Media is a great department to work for,” she said. “Everyone has been welcoming and helpful.”\n\nOutside of her work at the department, Price enjoys continuing her entrepreneurial work in the areas of event coordinating and interior design. She also enjoys traveling and attending her children’s sports events.\n\n- Abby Dearing\n\nDepartment mourns the loss of Administrative Associate Teri Hayslett\n\nTerri Hayslett\n\n(Aug. 28, 2023) The Department of Journalism and Strategic Media is mourning the death of Administrative Associate Teri Hayslett, who died suddenly and unexpectedly at her home on May 6.\n\nHayslett, 53, served the department in administrative roles for more than 10 years. The loss has left her JRSM colleagues, students and department alumni stunned and in shock. She was eulogized at a memorial service in her honor on May 19 at the Greater Imani Church in Memphis.\n\n“Teri always had a smile in her voice when she greeted faculty and students,” said JRSM Department Chair David Arant. “After the other staff member relocated to Texas, Teri became the department’s only administrative staff member for many years. Teri and I had to work closely together to get all the tasks done. Given the additional responsibility, we promoted her to administrative associate. We will miss Teri so much. Her contributions to the success of the department will long be remembered.”\n\nAt the memorial service, Hayslett was remembered as a colleague and friend who touched the lives of hundreds of students in the department since her hiring in 2012. She was described as the colleague and friend who made the department the loving and welcoming place it has been for the past decade.\n\nSpeaking to eulogize Hayslett at the service were JRSM faculty members Jin Yang, Joe Hayden, Otis Sanford, Candy Justice and Tom Hrach. The service was presided over by Pastor Donna Edwards. It was attended also by her family and friends.\n\n“She will be remembered for her kind heart and generosity. Teri’s life was a blessing to all who knew her,” was the common sentiment at the service.\n\nHayslett was born at Fort Ord in California, and she was described as an Army brat. She attended four different schools before graduating from Osbourne Park High School in Manassas, Va. She accepted Christ at a young age and was baptized at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. She received her B.A. in English from Fisk University in Nashville. Prior to her work in the JRSM department, she worked for 15 years at The Commercial Appeal as a library assistant, copy editor and multimedia editor.\n\nTo honor Haylsett, donors have established a fund to create the “Teri Hayslett Student Service Award. The award will annually recognize the JRSM student who provides exemplary service to the JRSM department. The award was approved by the faculty on Aug. 21.\n\nAfrican journalists discuss the perils, limits of a free press at Meeman event\n\n(Aug. 29, 2023) Journalists from 14 African nations joined the Institute for Public Service Reporting on July 28 to discuss everything from freedom of the press to the perils of reporting news in a dangerous political climate.\n\nThe U.S. Department of state brought the group to the Meeman Journalism Building in Memphis as part of an effort to familiarize African journalists to the United States. The contingent started its 10-day American tour in Washington, D.C., came to Memphis and then concluded it in Missoula, Montana.\n\nThe group was headed by S. Najlaa Abdus-Samad, media relations officer with the U.S. State Department, who said the goal was to discuss how American journalists report news and learn about how press freedoms are respected in the U.S.A.\n\nParticipating in the panel discussion were Marc Perrusquia, institute director; David Waters, assistant director; Chris Fulton, former intern at the institute, and Otis Sanford, retired JRSM faculty member.\n\nIt was an eye-opening discussion as journalists discussed with the panel the difficulties of reporting news in Africa, along with the dangers many journalists face. The journalists came from some of the most populous nations of Africa including Nigeria, Ethiopia and Uganda.\n\nSome of the issues they discussed were mostly foreign to American journalists such as official government censorship, night time raids of newsrooms and fear of being photographed in public.\n\n“Because our Constitution protects freedom of the press, it's hard for us to relate to the threats to life and livelihood African journalists face every day,’’ Waters said.\n\nDepartment recognizes star students, scholarship winners and Otis Sanford at awards ceremony\n\n(May 1, 2023) The Department of Journalism and Strategic Media honored its top students and awarded more than $25,000 in scholarships at the J+SM Awards ceremony on April 26 at the Hall of Fame building on campus.\n\nThe event attracted about 180 students and their family members.

Professionals from different fields also joined the event.\n\nThe advertising professionals who attended were Rebecca Phillips, freelance communication designer; Katie Mars, a partner at Pretty Useful; and Richard Fudge, a senior artist at Baptist Memorial Health Care.\n\nThe journalism professionals included John Klyce; reporter for the Memphis Business Journal; Soni Halmon, executive producer at Fox13; Christian Fowler, senior writer and content producer for Bluff City Media; David Royer, digital executive producer for WREG TV; Colin Cody, sports reporter for WREG TV; and Lucas Finton, reporter for the Commercial Appeal.\n\nIn the public relations filed, attending were Beth Wilson, founder and chief PR officer for Wilson PR; Courtney Ellett, owner of Obsidian PR; and Alisha Tillery, public relations director for KQ Communications\n\nIn the creative mass media field, attending were Patrick Lantrip, photographer for the Daily Memphian; Vanessa Exernieks, art director for Fox13; Cameron Gray, senior graphic designer for Neon Canvas; and Curt Crocker, creative director for Neon Canvas.\n\nThe event had a great turnout with nearly 50 students in attendance for the one-on-one sessions with professionals.\n\n“It’s so important for the department to create opportunities for our students to connect with industry professionals, said Associate Professor Robby Byrd. “ProDay is particularly special because it gives students a chance to network with local pros, but it also gives them the opportunity to get feedback on their resumes and portfolios. My hope is that this becomes an annual event for the entire department.”\n\n- Ilaria Pisoni\n\nPulitzer Prize winner Cara Owsley discusses importance of visual journalism\n\n(April 17, 2023) The University of Memphis hosted the 11th Annual Norm Brewer First Amendment Lecture on April 6 in the UC Theater featuring Pulitzer Prize winner Cara Owsley, director of photography for the Cincinnati Enquirer.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Owsley has been a photojournalist, whose photos have appeared in publications across the world. She was a member of the Cincinnati Enquirer team that won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for local reporting for its coverage of the opioid crisis in Ohio.\n\nOwsley and her team created a compelling package called “Seven Days of Heroin: This is what an epidemic looks like.” The multimedia package focused on the heroin crisis in greater Cincinnati showing how the addiction destroyed families and communities.\n\nOwsley’s reporting for the series included a profile of Stephanie, a woman struggling with heroin addiction.\n\n“One of the saddest moments of my career is before (Seven Days of Heroin was published), Stephanie overdosed and died,” Owsley said.\n\nDuring her lecture, Owsley focused on the importance of multimedia storytelling. Visual media is an essential act of making a point through images. Images enhance the reading experience by giving words life and assisting the reader in understanding the plot.\n\n“Cara’s talk hits right at what our students need to learn: multimedia skills. News industries are changing every day because of multimedia. It’s exciting, and she got me excited about so many new ideas and opportunities,” Professor Matt Haught said.\n\nAbout 60 faculty, students and guests attended the event. The Brewer lecture series was launched 11 years ago by Professor Otis Sanford to recognize Norm Brewer, a Memphis journalist and television commentator.\n\n- Ilaria Pisoni\n\nDepartment to honor student achievement, scholarships at JRSM awards event on April 26\n\n(April 7, 2023) The Department of Journalism and Strategic awards ceremony, which recognizes student achievement and scholarships is set for 5:30 p.m., Wednesday, April 26 at the Penny Hardaway Hall of Fame building on campus.\n\nNo tickets are required to attend this free event, but students and their family members planning to attend are encouraged to RSVP.

There was one student Sanford remembered being a bright young man who needed mentoring and direction. He took a few classes with Sanford throughout his time in the department. When that student got to graduation, he came to Sanford’s office a few days before the ceremony to tell him that he really appreciated the impact that Sanford had on him.\n\nSanford also had an impact on the broader university community. Throughout his time on campus, he established the annual Norm Brewer Lecture Series and organized many other speakers and panels for UofM students and the greater Memphis community.\n\nThrough regular newspaper columns and TV and radio appearances, Sanford also connected the greater community to Memphis' history and politics. In 2017, he wrote the book, “From Boss Crump to King Willie: How Race Changed Memphis Politics.”\n\nJRSM Department Chair David Arant said that for several years before he hired Sanford as chair in 2010 the chair of excellence position was a one-year visiting professor position that had limited impact on the department. With Sanford, Arant reestablished the chair of excellence as a long-term position with the expectation that the chair would make a greater contribution to the university and the Memphis community.\n\nBefore Sanford joined the department, Arant knew Sanford well after working extensively together on The Teen Appeal, the citywide, high school newspaper partnership of the department and The Commercial Appeal.\n\nUpon joining the department, Arant assigned Sanford the critical role of teaching the required Introduction to Media class, which serves as a major recruitment tool for the department.\n\n“I wanted to offer the students a welcoming front door into the department so I continued to assign Sanford to teach the class,” Arant said.\n\nWith his rich and deep knowledge of journalism and his experience and connections in the field, Sanford offered his students an inside look into the media professions.\n\nArant said that it’s difficult finding someone to fill the many roles that Sanford plays in the department.\n\nSanford’s one parting message to students is that there is still a future in journalism — however you choose to describe it.\n\n“You have to have passion in order to be successful in this job,” Sanford said. “You have to want to do it, and you have to want to constantly get better every day.”\n\nSanford said he was not the same journalist he was in 1975. He is a better journalist today because he was able to learn along the way.\n\n“It’s all about learning and growing, taking risks, accepting challenges, and being singularly committed to doing the best job that you can do as a journalist,” Sanford said.\n\nSanford has more than 40 years of experience in the journalism field. Since earning his journalism degree from the University of Mississippi in 1975, Sanford worked at The Clarion-Ledger (Jackson, Mississippi), The Commercial Appeal, The Pittsburg Press, The Detroit Free Press, back to The Commercial Appeal, and finally the University of Memphis.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nJRSM grad students, faculty present research at Southeast Colloquium in Murfreesboro\n\n(Mar. 24, 2023) Five graduate students and three faculty members participated in the 2023 Southeast Colloquium of the AEJMC research conference on March 2 to 4 at the campus of Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro.\n\nThe conference brought together students and academics from many parts of the country to present research and share ideas on journalism and strategic media education. A student at the event was JRSM grad student Oakley Weddle, who presented a research paper and three research-in-progress abstracts.\n\nWeddle presented a research-in-progress titled “Eliza Fletcher: The Media Framing of a Fatal Abduction in Memphis, Tennessee” to the Newspaper and Online News Division. He also presented “My ED Story: The Narrative of Bulimia Nervosa in YouTube Videos by Male Content” to the Community Journalism Division. He presented “The Simplification of Brand Logo Design and Typography from 2012 to 2022” as a research-in-progress to the Visual Communication Division and presented “#freepervispayne: How Social Media Discourse Affected a Capital Punishment Case in Tennessee” in the Open Division.\n\nOther graduate students who participated were Audrey Firrone, Israel Henry, Ilaria Pisoni, and Mikhelle Taylor.\n\nFirrone presented “Visualizing Diplomacy: A Content Analysis of Visuals from Official State Twitter Accounts” to the Visual Communication Division. Taylor presented “When Realities Collide: Mixed Reality Freedom of Speech versus Public Property Rights” to the Media Law Division. Henry presented “Monkey See. Monkey Do: A Content Analysis of Media Framing of 2022 Monkeypox Virus Outbreak” to the LGBTQ Division. Pisoni presented “Social Media Influencers and the Luxury Fashion Industry: Communication Through Influencer Marketing” to the Open Division.\n\nAssistant Professor Chalise Macklin presented “A Theoretical Thematic Analysis Aimed at Improving Media Messages Through Gatekeeping and Muted Group Theory” to the Newspaper and Online News Division. Professors Matt Haught and Tom Hrach served as moderators and discussants.\n\n- Tom Hrach\n\nJRSM online master’s degree ranked 4th in the nation by national website\n\n(Mar. 24, 2023) The Department of Journalism and Strategic Media, which launched the country’s first online journalism and mass communication master’s degree in 1995, was ranked fourth in the nation for its online master’s degree by the website, onlinemastersdegrees.org.\n\nThe 2023 rankings were announced in January. The website is a resource for graduate students seeking online degrees. It examines factors such as tuition affordability, online component availability, student/faculty ratio, and the accessibility of student and career support services.\n\n“I am pleased that our master’s program is being recognized,” said Tom Hrach, JRSM graduate director. “We were the first school to offer an online master’s program more than two decades ago, and we have continued to tailor our program to people who are outside of Memphis or unable to come to campus,”\n\nRankings can be useful during the college search process as students and parents may also look at national and regional college ratings to determine how schools stack up against one another – and why some are rated more highly than other institutions.\n\nMoreover, the right master’s degree can help everyone, regardless of their age, achieve higher career and salary goals, Hrach said. Being able to do an online master’s can make the whole process easier, as students can reach their goals from anywhere, anytime.\n\n“Teaching in our graduate program is one of the most fulfilling parts of my job because I get to help students push their boundaries to think in critical, big-picture ways,” said Matt Haught, JRSM assistant chair. “The fact that we can do that kind of learning in an online setting creates options and access for our community.”\n\n- Ilaria Pisoni\n\nNew reporting course focuses on social justice, civil wrongs in Memphis and Mid-South\n\n(Mar. 23, 2023) Laura Faith Kebede of the Memphis Institute for Public Service Reporting is teaching JOUR 4185, a new course on social justice reporting focused on researching past cases of racial terrors and connecting them to present-day injustices.\n\nThis spring the course is taking a deep dive into the Memphis Massacre of 1866.\n\n“It’s such a forgotten piece of history that hasn’t gotten a lot of attention, especially considering the historical significance of it,” Kebede said.\n\nThe Memphis Massacre of 1866 was one of the incidents that pushed the nation toward the passing of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Kebede said the goal of the course was to highlight the painful history of America and to discuss why such stories matter today.\n\nKebede said that the students have been incredibly engaged in the class this semester. She has 13 registered students in the course, which meets every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.\n\n“I think the biggest takeaway that I’ve had is that they’re curious and eager to learn about history that has been denied to them in their own education,” Kebede said. “Especially in the first week or so. I think there was so much shock that they have never heard about this — especially those who were from Memphis or from near Memphis.”\n\nThat has been a recurring theme throughout this semester — why have we never heard of these cases that are significant events both locally and federally?\n\nBy the end of the semester, Kebede said that her class will publish a podcast. The first season of the Civil Wrongs podcast was published in the fall by the Institute for Public Service Reporting.\n\nThe course also has students from outside the department. In the future, she said she hoped to open it up to students from other disciplines. With the way the course is set up, there are ways to bring together multiple majors such as journalism, history, sociology, and political science.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nProfessor Jin Yang’s research shows changing racial attitudes in Japan\n\n(Mar. 17, 2023) JRSM Professor Jin Yang is back on campus after spending the fall 2022 semester on a professional development assignment, where she spent two months in Japan conducting a research project about racial attitudes.\n\nDr. Jin Yang\n\nYang presented her research paper “Can Osaka Naomi Represent Japan? An Exploration of Values in Japanese College Students’ Attitudes towards Interracial Relationships” to the faculty and graduate students on March 1. The conclusions from her research showed that Japan is changing and moving to a more tolerant and diverse society compared to 50 years ago.\n\nUsing quantitative methods, Yang spent 25 days on the J. F. Oberlin University campus conducting in-person surveys of Japanese young people. The campus is a private, liberal arts university in Tokyo.\n\nThe project used tennis star Naomi Osaka’s lighting of the torch for the 2020 Olympic games, which were held in 2021, as a guidepost for measuring interracial relationships. Osaka is half-Japanese and half-Haitian. She was also born in Japan but spent the majority of her life being raised in the United States.\n\nOverall, Yang found that most people viewed Osaka positively. More than half of respondents said that they would engage in an interracial relationship, and one-third would not engage in one but approve of others doing so.\n\nYang said that her research shows that Japan is changing economically, socially, and culturally. Young people in the country are no longer fitting into the old picture of the Japanese attitude toward interracial relationships. More young people believe in universalism and self-direction. Yang also found women to be a strong contributing factor to the changes in attitudes. She found that women are a major force in pushing for Japan’s blending.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nJRSM students well represented at Tennessee Press Association annual convention\n\n(Mar. 17, 2023) Five U of M journalism department students participated in the Feb. 23 Tennessee Press Association winter conference in Nashville, an event that featured newspaper journalists and students from around the state.\n\nStudents at the event were Rebecca Garland, Kameron Scott, Justin Braden, Sheronda Braxton and Giovanna Rodriguez. Also representing the U of M were Journalism and Strategic Media faculty members David Arant, Tom Hrach and Otis Sanford.\n\nThe annual conference at the Holiday Inn hotel in downtown Nashville was conducted in person this year for the first time since 2020. Speakers at the event were Allison Gerber, editor of the Chattanooga Free Press; Mark Humphrey, photojournalist; and Amanda Little, founder of media platform for teenagers.\n\nThe conference also brought Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Tennessee Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally as the post-lunch speakers. The two leaders answered questions from students and journalists about school funding and support for higher education.\n\nThe students were sponsored by the Tennessee Press Association Foundation, which is dedicated to helping students connect with newspaper media professionals. The association represents newspapers from across the state and lobbies on behalf of the newspaper industry.\n\n- Tom Hrach\n\nJRSM alum, Tiger athlete gets premier spot on Memphis sports talk radio\n\n(Feb. 28, 2023) Gabe Kuhn, University of Memphis JRSM department alum and former Tiger football player, has started a new role at 92.9 FM ESPN Sports Radio in one of the premier spots for drive-time sports talk radio in Memphis.\n\nStarted on Feb. 6, “The Gabe Kuhn Show” airs from 4 to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday. Kuhn replaced long-time host Gary Parrish, also a JRSM alum.\n\nKuhn graduated with a degree in journalism in 2016. He played football for the Tigers from 2014 to 2017 as an offensive lineman.\n\nJournalism runs in Kuhn’s family — his father and brother were both journalism majors. When he got to campus, he knew journalism was something that he wanted to do. The general area of broadcast was always something that Kuhn was interested in, so radio came naturally to him.\n\nImmediately after graduation, Kuhn didn’t enter into the journalism world. He continued with football playing in a rookie minicamp with the New Orleans Saints and ended up with the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football. After he was released from the Express in 2019, he joined WHBQ Sports56 in Memphis as an intern.\n\nAfter about three weeks of his internship with Sports56, he landed a full-time position as a producer. He spent two and a half years as a producer before becoming a host of an afternoon show. He worked as a host for Sport56 until he was hired at his current position on 92.9 ESPN.\n\n“I’m not trying to replicate his style,” Kuhn said when asked about the station’s switch from Parrish to himself. “I’m going to do my brand of radio.”\n\nOne of the advantages Kuhn brings to his new position is being not too far removed from the locker room. He does not just want to talk about sports. He wants to show the inside world of sports through interviews with coaches and players.\n\nBrad Carson, station manager of 92.9, said Kuhn has found his voice in just a few weeks on the air.\n\n“If there were expectations, I think he’s knocked it out of the park,” Carson said. “If you’ve heard him on the air, he sounds great.”\n\nCarson said Kuhn relies on the things he is good at. He cited several examples of former athletes and coaches whom Kuhn has had on his show, including Joey Magnifico, a former tight end with the Tigers.\n\nTo keep up with Kuhn, you can follow him on Instagram and Twitter (@g_kuhn71).\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nTwo JRSM grad students named to Memphis Flyer’s list of top upcoming citizens under 30\n\n(Feb. 27, 2023) Two JRSM graduate students were named to the Memphis Flyer’s “20 under 30 list,” which recognizes young people making a positive difference in the city of Memphis.\n\nOakley Weddle\n\nKirsten Desidero\n\nThis year’s list came out in the magazine on Jan. 25. It recognized Oakley Weddle and Kirsten Desiderio as two “outstanding young people who are doing their best to make the Bluff City a better place.” The list is a review of people who likely will shape Memphis in the future.\n\nDesiderio was described as a full-time marketing coordinator for a commercial real estate company while pursuing integrated strategic media as part of her MA in Journalism and Strategic Media.\n\n“It kind of encompasses journalism, public relations, marketing, advertising — all of the things that I like in one very long name,” Desiderio told the Flyer.\n\nDesiderio also serves as vice president of communications for the U of M Graduate Student Association.\n\nWeddle was described as a young man who started his own public relations firm and working full-time as a marketing manager for an IT firm.\n\n“I majored in public relations as an undergrad, and I’m getting my master’s right now in journalism and strategic media. So I’m all about communications,” Weddle told the Flyer. “I think it’s incredibly important.”\n\nU of M reporting institute hires grad student intern for spring 2023\n\n(Feb. 27, 2023) The Institute for Public Service Reporting at the University of Memphis recently hired Jake Lankford as its new student intern for the spring semester.\n\nLankford is an alum of the university, and he is starting his first semester of graduate school in the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media.\n\nJake Langford\n\nLankford first heard about the work that the institute does after reading about the Civil Wrongs series put together by the institute. After some research into the organization, he wanted to support the effort and be a part of it.\n\nBefore joining the institute, Lankford also wrote for DH.com, where he mostly covered event stories. He’s still with DH.com in addition to being a show host for The ROAR, the U of M’s radio station. To read some of his stories, click here.\n\n“I’m mostly looking forward to just being able to really feel like working in a real professional newsroom,” Lankford said. “Learn this new beat, learn this whole new style of journalism and really just take my time at the Institute and use it to go on to bigger and better things.”\n\nThe institute was created in 2018, and its office is in 316 Meeman. While housed in the same building as the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media, the institute functions as an independent entity. In addition to getting real-life experiences, institute interns are also compensated for their work.\n\nTo keep up with all the stories coming from the Institute visit its website and sign up for its email newsletter.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nThe ROAR streaming radio moves to new home in Meeman Journalism building\n\n(Feb. 21, 2023) The University of Memphis’ streaming radio station, The ROAR, has moved its location to the first floor of the Meeman Journalism building from its former home in the basement of the Theater building.\n\nThe station currently has about 16 or 17 shows running and about 30 students participating and providing content for listeners 24 hours a day every day of the week. The new studios are in 113 Meeman.\n\nTK King, assistant professor of practice and faculty advisor for The ROAR, said she is pleased ROAR made the move.\n\n“I think it’s just a really, really good idea to have all of us — all of the media outlets — in-house,” King said.\n\nKing said being in the journalism building is a win for the department faculty and students because of increased visibility.\n\nMany students that King advises at The ROAR have taken her Intro to Radio course, so they are already familiar with the station’s equipment and how it works. King is always there to train students who wish to join.\n\nStudents working for The ROAR have a lot of freedom in the content that they produce. Most of the students do a one-hour show, and some students have 30-minute shows as a way to help them dip their toes in the water.\n\nIn addition to running 24/7 online, The ROAR also has a partnership with WYXR 91.7 FM. This partnership gives students a chance to get experience with a broadcast radio station.\n\nStudents interested in joining The ROAR can contact TK King at tsking@memphis.edu or fill out an interest form online.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nThree new exchange students from Germany in JRSM department for spring\n\n(Feb. 21, 2023) Three students from Germany have joined the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media for the spring 2023 semester as part of its exchange program with Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz.\n\nThe three students are Hannah Bitzer, 23; Greta Hüllman, 25; and Daniel Thoma, 23. All three are enrolled in journalism and strategic media courses such as TV news producing and multimedia storytelling, which they said will help them achieve their career goals.\n\n“The journalism classes I have are really interesting,” Bitzer said. “You work very practical here, and we learn a lot about journalism in the US compared to Germany. Some topics are quite difficult because we didn’t really talk about them at our home university, but then it’s even more useful to learn it.”\n\nStudents often are interested in a university experience that is globally focused so they can learn and be exposed to different cultures. Therefore, universities are investing more in global engagement to stay competitive.\n\nThe journalism department has a regular exchange program with the university in Mainz, Germany, which is named after Johannes Gutenberg, inventor of the movable type printing press. The department is again planning to send UofM students to Mainz in May as part of the exchange program.\n\nExchange programs open doors for participants to learn, grow and collaborate with others to find solutions to common issues and assure a bright future. Future leaders who innately recognize the importance of international cooperation, understanding, and empathy are produced by exchange programs.\n\nThat is true for the three students from Germany this spring semester.\n\n“Learning how to adapt to new surroundings, getting in contact with many people and practicing my English will also help me later when looking for a job in TV journalism” Bitzer said.\n\nFun fact about Mainz: every February the city celebrates “Fastnacht,\" a special carnival where people dress up and there are different celebrations all over the city.\n\n- Ilaria Pisoni\n\nU of M’s public relations student group awarded bid to host international conference\n\n(Feb. 21, 2023) The University of Memphis Public Relations Student Society of America chapter has won its bid to host PRSA’s 2023 International Conference, which will take place in Nashville on Oct. 15 to 17.\n\nThe conference will take place at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. It will be a great networking opportunity for students as hundreds of public relations professionals will be there to share insights and help the students develop their careers.\n\n“As one of the most involved and fastest-growing student organizations on our campus, I have full confidence that UofM PRSSA will exceed the expectations that come with putting on such a prestigious event,” said U of M President Bill Hardgrave in a statement.\n\nFour U of M graduate and undergraduate students studying strategic media are going to be responsible for planning this once-in-a-lifetime event — Oakley Weddle, conference coordinator; Angel Williams-Federick, program director; Kirsten Desiderio, logistics director; and Taylor Ann Carpenter, communication director.\n\nThe 2022 conference was hosted by Texas Christian University in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWeddle and his team spent hours working on the 40-page proposal that eventually won them the bid. Since the minute they heard they secured the bid, Weddle said they hit the ground running. Some of the steps they have taken include getting sponsorships, planning programming, working and meeting with the national PRSSA conference team, and talking through the logistics.\n\n“It’s intense, but it’ll be an incredibly rewarding process,” Weddle said.\n\nWhen he met with Professor Kim Marks-Malone, the U of M PRSSA advisor, last spring, they made it one of their goals to build the chapter big enough the host the international conference.\n\n“As the president, I’m extremely proud of the whole team,” Weddle said. “This is one of, if not the biggest, achievements a PRSSA chapter can accomplish, and I’m honored to be a part of that legacy.”\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nPanel examines media coverage, policing issues in Tyre Nichols tragedy\n\n(Feb. 15, 2023) A panel discussion sponsored by Professor Otis Sanford and the JRSM Department examined the news coverage issues surrounding the beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis and featured four prominent area journalists along with a former Memphis police chief.\n\nMore than 100 students and faculty members attended “Covering the Nichols Tragedy: A Real-time and Historical Perspective” Feb. 9 in the Meeman Journalism Building.\n\nNichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was beaten by Memphis police officers on Jan. 7 and later died from his injuries. The death and subsequent Jan. 27 video release of the beating attracted nationwide attention to Memphis and the issue of police brutality.\n\nThe panelists were reporters Julia Baker of the Daily Memphian, Rebecca Butcher of ABC Local 24 and Lucas Finton of The Commercial Appeal. Also participating were Jerome Wright, former police reporter for The Commercial Appeal, as well as Toney Armstrong, former Memphis police director.\n\nThe discussion centered on how the local news media reports police brutality. Panelists offered advice on how the local media can continue to report on the Nichols tragedy. Armstrong even offered advice to future journalists reporting on news stories with high emotional impact involving police.\n\n“Tell the truth. Don’t sensationalize. Don’t add to it. Don’t take away from it. Don’t\n\nput a slant on it,” Armstrong said. “I don’t care as long as you tell the truth. I don’t care if it is a negative story. I don’t care if it puts me in a bad light, as long as you tell the truth. We are at a point now where that’s the issue – who’s telling the truth, and who’s not telling the truth. So just as people want to have confidence in their police department, they want to have the same level of confidence in you too.”\n\nInfo session on JRSM study abroad to Mainz set for Tuesday\n\n(Feb. 3, 2023) Department of Journalism and Strategic Media students who want to study abroad in May at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, should join Dr. Matt Haught for an information session about the trip at 4 p.m., Tuesday, Feb. 7, in Meeman 108.\n\nHaught will teach the course “Science Journalism” in Mainz May 5-26. Six spots have been allocated for UofM students to participate in the course, which also will involve students from the university in Mainz.\n\nThe three-week program includes a weekend trip to Amsterdam. The deadline for students to apply for the program is March 1.\n\n“We’re celebrating the 20th anniversary of the program this trip, so students will get to see a bit more of the history of the program on this trip,” Haught said. “We’re planning a special celebration with our partners at JGU and with ZDF television.”\n\nStudying abroad allows students to experience valuable new cultures and extend their worldview.\n\nMore information is available on the University's Study Abroad in Mainz website.\n\n- Ilaria Pisoni\n\nJRSM grad student named Student Communicator of the Year by Memphis public relations society\n\n(Jan. 24, 2023) Denzel Alexander, a JRSM alum and current graduate student at the University of Memphis, has been named the 2022 Student Communicator of the Year by the Memphis chapter of the Public Relations Society of America.\n\nDenzel Alexander\n\nIn addition to pursuing his graduate degree, Alexander is a social media manager at KQ Communications.

When presented with the possibility of funding a new social media lab, Ellett loved the vision and thought it was a good fit for her support.\n\n“I’m just happy that maybe this contributes to another student’s experience here and really prepares them for post-graduation life,” Ellett said. “If there’s anything I believe in, it’s about preparing students to have a really successful transition into the profession.”\n\nEllett said that the lab will help give students real-world knowledge of social media listening and how it relates to strategy.\n\nThe Obsidian lab gives the department’s faculty and students access to sophisticated social media listening tools for use in their research. Students using the lab’s social media listening tools in their class projects will be better prepared for their strategic media careers.\n\n“Our students now are going to be able to get hands-on, real-world experience using industry-standard tools,” said Kim Marks Malone, JRSM assistant professor of practice.\n\n“So when they go out and they apply for internships, or they apply for jobs, they can with confidence say that they know how to do social media listening, that they’ve used analytical tools, that they know how to do research to help inform decisions in an agency environment,” Marks said. “I think it’s going to give them a leg up compared to some of their peers from other schools.”\n\nIn addition to teaching students to social media listening skills in class projects, faculty can use the lab in doing their own academic research.\n\nThe Obsidian Lab classroom will also be the official home of Meeman 901 Strategies, the department’s student-run strategic communications firm.\n\nDepartment leadership plans to open the lab to faculty and students in other university programs with the hope of stimulating more interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nSocial media labs like this have been launched at many universities in the last three to five years. In developing the Obsidian Lab, Professor Marks and JRSM assistant chair Matt Haught visited social media labs at Clemson University, the University of South Carolina, and FedEx.\n\nMarks added, “I think having this lab is going to help us put ourselves on the map and become a resource region-wide—not just for schools and universities and programs, but for media and other agencies and nonprofits and all those kinds of people who need this kind of information to do their jobs.”\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nDepartment welcomes experienced journalist as new assistant professor of practice\n\nProf. Casey Hilder\n\n(Oct. 27, 2022) Casey Hilder, a former magazine and newspaper journalist, this fall joined the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media as an Assistant Professor of Practice.\n\nHilder received both his B.A. and M.A. from the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media and while a student here served as The Daily Helmsman’s editor-in-chief.

The mixer took place at Loaded for Bear offices at 673 Cooper St. Students were able to tour the space and see the actual environment of an agency while networking and discussing their career goals with professionals.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nNew skills, insights offered to high school students as part of statewide press event\n\n(Oct. 19, 2022) The University of Memphis hosted the Tennessee High School Press Association’s West Tennessee journalism workshop at its FedEx Institute of Technology on Sept. 26.\n\nThe approximately 50 students attending White Station High School, Bartlett High School, and St. Mary's High School are staff members of their high school newspapers and yearbooks.\n\nWorkshop sessions taught by UofM Journalism faculty members include media writing by Chalise Maclin, photojournalism by Casey Hilder, media design by Michael Robinson, and social media and podcasting by Robby Byrd.\n\nThe workshop ended with a panel on the challenges of being a journalist, moderated by Laura Faith Kebede, coordinator of the Civil Wrongs Project for the Institute for Public Service Reporting.

On a broader scale, her research interests can be defined as diversity and inclusivity in newsrooms and news coverage with an emphasis on cultural influence and potential risks to the public.\n\nOutside of academia, Macklin loves to travel, read and spend time with her friends and family.\n\n- Haley Hale\n\nExchange program with Mainz, Germany, brings three students to the UofM\n\n(Aug. 29, 2022) Three students from Germany have joined the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media for the fall 2022 semester as part of its exchange program with Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz.\n\nExchange programs enable students to study abroad at one of their university’s partner institutions, and every semester the department hosts students from Germany. For the fall semester, the department has been joined by Marlene Lutz, 25; Leander Xynogalas, 25; and Stefan Schüür, 23.\n\n“It was a big dream of me to study at a U.S. college since I started university in Germany,” Xynogalas said. “So, this program was the perfect opportunity to get this experience.”\n\nStudying in the United States is a desire that a lot of students share in Europe as it is such a different reality from what they are used to.\n\nA big difference is campus life. College in the United States has a robust campus culture that revolves around residence halls, sports, fraternities, sororities, and clubs. Whereas in Europe, activities are rarely centered around the university itself and more just around the city in general.\n\n“One of the first big differences we talked about after our arrival in Memphis is the food,” Lutz said. “On our campus in Germany, it is nearly impossible to get any kind of fast food.”\n\nStudying abroad is overall a great opportunity for young adults as it allows them to develop highly valued skills such as intercultural communication, foreign languages, and problem-solving.\n\nStudying abroad can also be beneficial for the future. It has been linked to increased ability to be hired and higher starting salaries.\n\nThe department is again planning to send UofM students to Mainz in May 2023 as part of the exchange program.\n\nLocated in west-central Germany, Mainz is the birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, inventor of the movable-type printing press. It is also home to the Gutenberg Museum as well as five universities. One of Mainz’s most defining features is its 1000-year-old Romanesque cathedral.\n\n- Ilaria Pisoni\n\nGrad student social event set for Sept. 8 at RP Tracks\n\nRP Tracks is located at 3547 Walker Ave.\n\n(Aug. 29, 2022) The Department of Journalism and Strategic Media is inviting all graduate students to join the staff and faculty at the annual Grad Student Social at 7:30 p.m., Thursday, Sept. 8 at RP Tracks to kick off the fall 2022 semester.\n\nThe event, which had to be canceled the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is back on the calendar, thanks to Department Chair David Arant.

The Grad Student Social is a good way for that to happen.\n\nThe department is offering to spring for snacks, while drinks will be on your own. RP Tracks is located at 3547 Walker Ave. near the U of M campus.\n\n- Tom Hrach\n\nNominations needed by Aug. 29 for top faculty award\n\n(Aug. 23, 2022) Students, alumni and staff of the Department of Journalism and Strategic Media are asked to consider nominating their favorite faculty member for the D.

While at CBU, he also worked at WKNO-FM as a news and classical music announcer.\n\nAs part of the internship, Pickey will return to WKNO where he will anchor newscasts and report from the field. He also will contribute to news coverage for the institute’s digital print partner, the Daily Memphian.\n\nPickey previously worked at local TV stations in Kirkersville, Mo.; Syracase, N.Y.; Wilmington, N.C.; and Odessa-Midland, Texas.\n\n“I'm looking forward to stepping out of the news director's office for a while and getting back to my reporting roots,” Pickey said.“This internship will allow The Institute and myself the opportunity to cover local stories you won't see anywhere else in town. It’s an honor to be accepted into the internship and I greatly appreciate the opportunity.”\n\n-Tom Hrach\n\nMeeman Matters: The Department Newsletter\n\n2020 AEJMC Southeast Colloquium\n\nThe 45th annual AEJMC Southeast Colloquium, March 19 -21, 2020, is to be hosted virtually by the University of Memphis.
