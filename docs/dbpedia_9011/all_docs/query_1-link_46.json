        "text": "Hello… my name is Owen. I have been licensed since 2018. I completed my undergrad work at Castleton State University and a master’s in psychology from the University of Phoenix and a master’s in counseling from Argosy University. The beginning of my career was focused on recovery work, completing my CSAC and working for Phoenix House and North Spring Behavioral Healthcare. I have been focusing my more recent clinical work on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) approaches, as well as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Solutions Focused approaches. I have recently had the pleasure of constructing and licensing an ACT team, using the hospital without walls model in my home town in upstate NY. I like challenges. While working for Discovery Behavioral Health, I have further improved utilization of DBT and ACT approaches in the treatment of adolescents and families. I have more recently been successful in helping several residents pass their exam for licensure, which was a rewarding experience. I have been hosting group supervision and look forward to doing this more in the future. When I am not working, I enjoy running, painting, cooking, working on cars, going to Caps games (Go CAPS!), concerts and getting out into the community. On a personal note, I love this work and generally have a can-do attitude, so if help is needed, I am willing to pitch in.\n\nHello! My name is Julia and I am a Master’s Level Social Worker currently under supervision towards becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. I received Master\\’s in Social Work with a clinical concentration at Virginia Commonwealth University. Before moving to Virginia, I lived in Michigan and received my Bachelors in Social Work with minors in Psychology and Spanish from a small liberal arts school. Within the therapeutic relationship, I am passionate about building a collaborative space where clients are free to address current struggles, process past events, celebrate successes, and work towards identified areas for growth. I practice from a person-centered and trauma-informed lens and draw from various therapeutic approaches including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Motivational Interviewing. Prior to working at Youth for Tomorrow, I have worked with a wide variety of populations in different settings including youth and adolescents in home-based counseling, adults experiencing domestic violence, and court-mandated adults. I now work primarily with adolescents and adults and have experience addressing a variety of concerns including depression, anxiety, trauma, self-injury, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties, and adolescent challenges. Outside of work, I enjoy trail running and hiking as well as knitting, reading, and traveling.\n\nHello my name is Aubrey! I am a Master’s Level Social Worker currently under supervision towards becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. I received my Master’s in Social Work from Salisbury University in 2021 as well as my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 2017. I specialize in eating disorder diagnoses as well as anxiety, depression, mood disorders, and trauma.\n\nMy goal is to help my clients feel understood while providing them skills to overcome their challenges. I have worked with children, adolescents, teens, and young adults. I like to teach my clients self-compassion as well as how to challenge negative thoughts.\n\nOutside of work I enjoy spending time with friends and family, going to the movies, finding ways to mindfully move my body, and doing different art projects! Fun fact about me is that I have bungee jumped from the 2nd highest bungee bridge in the world!\n\nHello, I am a Master’s level Therapist and Art therapist under supervision towards becoming a Licensed Professional Counselor and a Registered Art Therapist.

I came to Virginia from South Korea in 2021 and received Master’s in Art therapy from George Washington University in 2023. I practiced Person-centered and Mindfulness-based therapy, and various therapeutic approaches including Cognitive Behavioral therapy.\n\nMy goal is to create a safe place for clients and assist them in exploring diverse coping mechanisms, fostering their flourishing and enhancing overall well-being. I have worked with a diverse population mainly with anxiety, depression, and trauma, low self-esteem and/or motivation in various settings. Also as an art therapist, I am passionate about integrating artsy elements into sessions. I have witnessed clients experiencing significant benefits in the process, motivating me to continue integrating art within my sessions.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy music (both listening and singing), cooking, baking, exercising, spending time with my friends and family.
