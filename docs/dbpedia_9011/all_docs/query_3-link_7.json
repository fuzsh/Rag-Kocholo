        "text": "Has the history of eating disorders always been defined as harmful? If so, when was the shift to our present view of society? The origins of disordered eating date back to the rise of civilization to the present urban complex.\n\nBefore announcing harsh physical restrictions and purging as disorders it was seen in cultural norms and expectations. Dating back to 700 BC, the wealthy in the Roman empire would purge the food consumed so they could ingest more at banquet gatherings. The action accompanied no ill intent since it wasn’t known to be a danger to vital organs at the time. The origin of purging is also shown in hieroglyphics written by Ancient Egyptians showcasing its use to cleanse the body from any illnesses likely to be contracted; this act was performed monthly. Moving to restrictions, the main source was religious fasting to become closer to their believed higher power, which has continued for multiple religions in the present as well. Restriction is still common in the cultural sense of keeping resources plentiful for a longer amount of time in scarce countries. This included tribes in Africa trying to keep the youth healthy, but after their resources became more abundant fasting became an addiction (MentalHelp 1).\n\nThe terms associated with disordered eating stayed consistent as restricting, fasting, and purging until 1873, as claimed in “The Eating Disorder Timeline”. This is when Doctor, William Gull placed the term anorexia nervosa on a patient of his. Anorexia is paired with long periods without the consumption of food providing malnutrition to the body. This was the first step in history toward classifying these harsh physical treatments as dangerous and promoting such to the public. Anorexia was still not an official disorder and wouldn’t be until 1976. The reasoning for participating in fasting was for the most part still correlated with religious ties. Those who cut off societal roles also cut the value of food to become Saints (Pearce 1).\n\nIn the modern day, it is often thought that eating disorders originate from societal pressure to look the part of a defined beauty. The more someone aligns with the qualities of conventional beauty the more likely they are to obtain easier access to an increase of status. It wasn’t until 1967 that society put a value on thinness to equate with conventional beauty standards. This change came from a European model, Lesley Hornby, who went by the name Twiggie. The United States clothing producer, Calvin Klein made her popular stating, “…the move was a reaction to many women getting breasts and butt implants… ‘something so distasteful about all that. I wanted someone who was natural, always thin’” (McCann 1). The turn to media began when models were cast with the same figure as Twiggie, advertised in magazines. Shifting from advertising healthy body image to an immensely difficult standard was hard mentally on not just developing bodies, but the models themselves. Twiggie herself stated, “The way I looked when I started modeling- I was a skinny schoolgirl, stuffing tissues into my little 32A bra. I wasn’t trying to be that thin, I was perfectly healthy — but still that look is a total impossibility for women over the age of 20. Fashion has a lot to answer for, doesn’t it?” (McCann 1).\n\nHow extreme was the outcome turn for those in the spotlight of athleticism? After the turn of beauty standards, many famous athletes and models were faced with enormous pressure to not only perform skills in their profession perfectly but also to look thin to appear healthy in the public eye. The media became a source of awareness to the public. In 1992, Princess Diana of Whales broadcasted her struggles with bulimia. As was mentioned in Privileged Romans, the wealthy have a generational history with purging spanning different countries over time. Diana was an influencer in the spotlight as a role model representing an entire country. The pressure of representing an entire country from everything on the outside provides long-term stress. The stress accompanied by societal standards of body image produced an eating disorder. After Diana publically broadcasted her struggles the deaths of those faced with pressure around the world made the media. In 1994 a gymnast, Christy Henrich passed away from anorexia nervosa due to organ failure. In 1997 ballet dancer, Heidi Guenther in the Boston Ballet passed from a heart attack related to eating disorders. Jumping to 2006 a model, Luisel Ramos had passed off a heart attack due to the effects of anorexia. She was found without eating for several days before her death. After all those years of facing an increase in mortality, what came out of it? The research to provide adequate recovery for those in need. The research provides details on biological and social factors working together to form disorders such as bulimia and anorexia. Biological research in 2002 proved that specific genes increase the risk of future diagnosis of anorexia nervosa if aided by environmental influence. In the environmental sense itself, a 2007 study performed by the journal, “Pediatrics”. The study lasted 5 years indicating weight loss magazines read by developing bodies are more likely to indulge in fasting, vomiting, or laxative usage.\n\nEven though we’ve created awareness of the various disorders and created research to aid in steps for recovery, the presence of these disorders is still prevalent today. It has been shown that chronic stress in mental health has a large impact on the onset of these disorders. In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 increased the calls of the U.S. eating disorder hotline by 30%, causing a large decline in progress for change. Not only America, but the Great Britain National Health Service reports a 53% increase in hospital admissions regarding minorities with disordered eating. As the timeline before urban civilization to the present progresses there seems to be a worsening effect on the mental health of developing adolescents. It’s important to use the media as a resource for recovery rather than as an antagonist of the human body. Conventional beauty has jeopardized the lives of many individuals and it’s time for real progress."
