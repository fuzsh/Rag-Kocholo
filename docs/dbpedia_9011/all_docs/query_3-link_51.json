        "text": "Aim: The objective of this study was to point out abstinence knowledge in decreasing unhealthy ageing with reference to physical and mental health, with justification to evaluate athlete’s abstinence knowledge from eating disorders like Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge Eating Disorder (BED) as health education method in decreasing unhealthy ageing with reference to physical and mental health among athletes at Njala Campus. Method: Behavioral Health Risk Modified Survey Questionnaire (BHRMSQ) was the research instrument for the survey. The variables of the findings were proved at level of significance p<0.05 through an inferential statistical instrument called Dependent t-test (t). The researchers interviewed mainly undergraduate athletes with an average number of one hundred and fifty (n=150), of which 37% (n=55) female and 63% (n=95) male, were selected using the stratified random sampling. Also stratified were 43.2% (n=65) from the School of Agriculture-to-Environmental Science; 57% (n=85) from the School of Education-to-Technology; 83 % (n=125) from level (100-to-200); 17% (n=25) from level (300-to-400); 60% (n=90) within the age circle of (18-to-25); 40% (n=60) within the age circle of (26-to-30+) in years. Results: Analysis shows negative skewedness in all three variables as placed in tabulated values (t-scores of 0.237, 0.452 and 0.318)of 5, 7 and 9 when proved at p < 0.05. Conclusion: The findings demonstrated that majority of athletes’ lack abstinence knowledge from eating disorders like Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge Eating Disorder (BED) regarding health education method in decreasing unhealthy ageing with reference to physical and mental health among athletes at Njala Campus.\n\nPrevious research has indicated a strong association between bulimia and affective disorder at the time of initial clinical assessment. To investigate this relationship from a long-term perspective, 30 normal weight female bulimics were evaluated 2 to 5 years posthospital admission with psychometric measures and clinical interviews. Contrary to previous reports, the depression scores of the bulimics were surprisingly low, even though 26 of the 30 continued to fulfill DSM-III criteria for bulimia. Higher depression scores were associated with more intense bulimic symptomatology and attitudes, and greater psychiatric disturbance at followup. Although these data demonstrate a relationship between bulimic symptomatology and depression at long-term followup, they do not support recent assertions that bulimia is a variant of an underlying affective disorder.\n\nThis review examines eating disturbances in adolescent girls, the predisposing causes and medical complications that are related to these disturbances. The keywords, eating disorders, body dissatisfaction, medical complications and risk factors of eating disorders were used in the electronic database. Articles addressing these issues were selected for reviewing. Adolescent girls are preoccupied with their body weight and shape because of pubertal changes, social and cultural norms as well. This preoccupation has initiated eating and body image disturbances. Interventional methods addressing eating disorders in adolescent girls are needed, which should focus on both, behavioral and environmental changes."
