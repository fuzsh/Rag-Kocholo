        "text": "English competitive eater and YouTuber\n\nAdam Moran, better known as BeardMeatsFood, is a British competitive eater and YouTuber from Leeds.[2][3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMoran is a former banker, and a Yorkshireman hailing from Leeds.[4] He is a qualified personal trainer and says that competitive eating together with two hours' weight training per day has improved his body fat ratio over five years.[5] He did his first eating challenge around 2014-2015 as a follow-up to a diet where he got his body fat down to 8%; he started his YouTube channel in 2015, and began competing professionally in 2017.[6] In 2016, he was given a position as food tester by the owner of an American-style diner chain in Yorkshire, who took out £1 million in insurance on his stomach and tastebuds.[4]\n\nHe has competed in Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2019 and placed 10th.[7]\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nMoran's YouTube channel generally features him travelling around the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, the United States, and Canada to restaurants or other establishments that offer food challenges, and attempting to beat said challenges; during the challenge, he frequently chats with the other patrons and waiting staff, often profusely apologizing for his messy eating, and has a second \"TABLE CAM\" camera facing away from himself to record the reactions. In the final edit he also provides a sarcastic voiceover commentary track, which he sometimes starts with an excited gibberish exclamation that's vaguely meant to resemble \"Let's get it!\":[8] he stated it's a \"nonsensical yet energetic way of announcing the beginning of the commentary\".[9] He has admitted a dislike towards mushrooms and Brussels sprouts, although it's not a deal breaker;[10][11] he does actively dislike spicy food, however.[12] He often gets Diet Coke with his meals, as he claims the carbonation of the soft drink helps getting some of the trapped air out of the stomach, and the sweetness helps break up the monotony of the savory flavor.[13] Despite the size of the challenges, he often orders a dessert once he has finished.[10]\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nPodcast\n\n[edit]\n\nMoran co-hosts the \"Breaking Beard\" podcast with Josh Gudgeon. This podcast is also available on YouTube in video format.[14]\n\nChristmas parody singles\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in 2020, Moran has released a song every December, in which a pop-punk song's lyrics are rewritten with a food theme. All the proceeds from the sales of downloads and streaming royalties are donated to the Stroke Association, a cause which is close to him since his father's death from a stroke. A music video is made for each of these songs, produced by his friend and fellow Breaking Bread Podcast co-host Josh Gudgeon, who has also appeared in videos on the Beard Meats Food YouTube channel.\n\nOn 18 December 2020, Moran joined the race for the Christmas Number One. The single \"Garlic Bread (I Think I'm In Love)\" was a parody version of Mystery Jets' 2008 indie hit \"Two Doors Down\".[15]\n\nThe following year, on 17 December 2021, he released the follow-up single \"I Want Chicken Wings\".[16] The song was a parody of Canadian pop-punk band Simple Plan's \"I'd Do Anything\".\n\nOn 16 December 2022, Moran's third single \"I Got Cheesecake\" was released.[17] This one featured Adam performing a duet with his sister Jenna, who sometimes appears in his videos as \"Sister Beard\", parodying English band Creeper's song \"Ghosts Over Calvary\".\n\nIn 2023, Moran explained that he wanted to stop making these songs, but the popularity of \"I Got Cheesecake\" and the amount of money it generated for charity compelled him to do it again, and, on 15 December, he released \"Grab the Mince Pies\", his take on the UK band My Awesome Compilation's song \"Sirens\".[18]\n\nEpisode list\n\n[edit]\n\nUpload date Title Location Restaurant Challenge Approx Weight of Food Allotted time Previous Record Beard time Win / Loss Prize Notes YouTube Link February 25th, 2017 The 35,000 Calorie Cheat Day Beat ErikTheElectrics 24 Hour Cheat Day record of 30,000. 36,647 calories 24 hours 30,000 calories Won 1 lg Domino's stuffed crust meateor pizza, 2 grilled cheese donuts, 2 Ben and Jerry shakes, 2 bowls of granola, 2 cups of coffee (one twice as big as the other), double sausage & egg mcmuffin, sausage egg & cheese bagel, 3 pancakes, Egg Benedict, 3 hash browns, and a piece of bacon, double sausage croissantwich, glazed donut, caramel latte, red's BBQ donut burger, cornbread, frickles, fries, peanut butter pancakes and a Hershey's cookies n cream bar.
