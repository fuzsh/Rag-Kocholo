        "text": "Mateuš Conrad Apr 2019\n\npre-scriptum:\n\nno polyglot would experience this sort of \"paradox\", it's not even a paradox of a \"paradox\" off a 'paradox', bilingualism has its methodology, as Kant could explain, extracting his methodology off the page into a meticulous day-to-day activity... the sage / if not the clock of Königsberg... i can imagine this obsessive-compulsive mini-rituals that would always escape the throng on a Sunday... the Sunday eucharist wasn't enough for the man, there were so many rituals to take care of, having famously not married, while Kierkegaard having: infamlusly not married... i appreciate their strategy... reading them while also reading Nietzsche, these two gentlemen, by comparison, if not in work, certainly in life gravitate above the popularity of Nietzsche... why? Nietzsche appears as an incel... fan boy, are you? *******... but you need some sort of structure if you're not going to marry... Kant found his daily routine an eternal mass... so many routine daily tasks seemingly mundane to some, can enlarge themselves to become out of proportion pillars of preserving sanity in face of standing before god and a post-life scenario... hell is not so much a place of suffering... i can tell you of the most \"mild\" form of suffering... an extrovert becoming drunk... constant talking, lack of purpose as in: lack of direction culminating in: lack of concentration, pandemonium is the heaven of a flickering light for a moth... again... this always bewilders me... why did Sisyphus have to drag the stone up the hill? was there some overlooking demon with a whip looking over him? couldn't he just... sit, and concentrate on the stone, create pleasure, from thinking? is that really so odd... i suppose so... given the grand h'american export of the freedom of speech... few people will find pleasure in thinking... Kierkegaard, which Nietzsche didn't read... said: why do people concern themselves with the freedom to speak, when they already possess a freedom to think? is this, me speaking, because it's the internet and it's a public space... surely i don't have an eloquent speech, i speak too quickly, i sometimes mumble, this is an extension of thinking, it's not an invitation to speak... rhetoric is an art designated for people who joked about philosophy and took sophistry seriously... i don't like Nietzsche... i still think of the man as the esteemed bachelor... apparently being freed from women allowed him to write his Critique with the sort of clarity that comes, in a cascading form, at the end, in the methodology of transcendence... which reads, like a page-turner tabloid narrative... once the formalities / difficulties are established... i'm no polyglot though, but i do succumb to some eccentricities... as any entrenched bilingual might... notably linguistics... how there are no diacritical markers in english, but there are: in other latin script based languages of continent europe... how i've never heard of dyslexia outside of the realm of spoken english... how orthography does not exist in the english language, which creates all these silly english questions of: what is reality, what is perception... with no orthography: metaphysics runs rampant... and \"another\" thing... i really can't read a philosophy book in english, i always have to revert back to my mother tongue, to Polish... i can't read a philosophy book in english... i looked at Plato once in english... the aesthetic is lost on me... but the Irish know of the Slavic aesthetic when it comes to dialogue, i.e.:\n\n(a) the english standard for dialogue weaved into a narrative -\n\n\"i want this,\" she said,\n\n\"as i want that,\" he said...\n\n(b) the slavic standard for dialogue weaved into\n\na narrative...\n\n- so?\n\n- what?\n\n- will we try to speak without\n\nthe reiteration of who said what?\n\n- we could.\n\n- no, we should.\n\nsmoother... James Joyce noted this,\n\ncasual - no point adding descrptions of\n\nhow the puppet-master lost power\n\nover his puppets with \" \" ditto markers of\n\ndialouge of a: he, he really did say...\n\nno, not he, the narrator...\n\ni simply cannot read the genre of philosophy in english, too much easy access points of pop culture with that umbrella overreach... matrix, memes, darwinism, blah blah... too much focus on images and very little focus on words, esp. etymology, that other component of history that focuses on: a universal application of words, beside status king, or status pauper... both the word bread can succumb to the king's tongue, as to the pauper's... but with an origin story? anything beside **** similis, the monkey, will do me just fine... then again... there's no one strand of monkey to begin with... a bit like looking up your own *** for too long, you decide that there's a coherent, \"bigger picture\" and it begins with chimp- and ends with -rilla... doesn't anyone else just tire of looking up a monkey *** to peddlestool the importance of darwinism for so long? i mean... at least chemistry is a playground among the science... there's no worry for a beginning... there's only play... no... i can't read a philosophy book in english... i have to read it in Polish... which is also a... january, february, march, april, may, june, july, august, september, october, novermber, december... you'd think i'd be able to recite you the months in my mother tongue... styczeń, luty, marzec, kwiecień, maj, czerwiec, listopad, grudzień... english alphabet? a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, m, n, l, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v... **** gets scrambled... pointless rubrics... give me the practical! - i've just picked up a copy of Plato's republic... straight away i know that i'm finding my gensus in Plato rather than Aristotle...\n\noch ty, pijaku z psim pyskiem,\n\na za to z sercem jelenia...\n\noh you, drunkard with a dog's snout,\n\nnonetheless, with a stag's heart...\n\nagain, Nietzsche: Kant is an idiot, Plato is boring...\n\nperhaps in German, for a German,\n\nlooking for Germany while roaming parts of Italy...\n\nwell... Plato, really seems appealing in\n\nhigh slavic (western), the conversations breed\n\na sense of clarity, about fog, about darkness,\n\nor any akin metaphor to boot...\n\nbetween Nietzsche's maxims,\n\ni'll take la Rochefoucauld succinct observations\n\nbefore i succumb to pop-nietzsche modern\n\ncult meme fucklords...\n\nRoger Moore... prime example\n\nof a bachelor, Kant, the same, Kierkegaard...\n\nas for myself? if i married?\n\nwould i still have the same sort of access to new\n\nmusic, that i currently enjoy?\n\nfor god's sake... i have to fall asleep while\n\nlistening to music, if i spend a day without\n\nat least 5 hours of music on the headphones\n\ni start to lose the plot...\n\nmy drinking is merely a side-note...\n\na p.s., given that now i'm a reformed drinker?\n\nhaving cut my dosage in half...\n\ni'm still a music *****...\n\nwomen don't like music junkies...\n\nand when my ex- started reading me\n\na qustionnaire from a russian cosmopolitan\n\nmagazine on the train to moscow from\n\nst. petersburg... i thought i was going to shoot\n\nmyself in the head...\n\nperfect girlfriend this,\n\nperfect girlfriend that...\n\nbob dylan saved me...\n\nbut not for long...\n\nwomen aren't feline...\n\nat least with a cat you can ignore it...\n\nhe's pretending to be a solipsist and\n\nyou pretend to be: caring...\n\nfood on the table,\n\na clean litter tray... besides that?\n\nfuckoffski!\n\nand i write this from a perspective of endearment,\n\nnothing beats the zenith moments in a hetrosexual\n\nrelationship... the odd

anaesthetic with regards to the past...\n\ni needed to visit the brothel to also visit\n\nthe butchers...\n\ni needed to become meat,\n\nto **** meat... and stop concerning myself over looks:\n\nthey

bulimia,\n\nclassical roman bulimia:\n\ntraining the oesophagus with first *******\n\ninto the mouth... then with no fingers\n\ndown the mouth?\n\nbeauty... is not worth the trouble\n\nwhen you really tempt yourself with the expansive\n\ntemporal canvas...\n\n21 was my peak... after that...\n\nvoluntary celibacy...\n\na **** here and there...\n\nbut no... it's not for me...\n\ni guess i looked up to the right sort\n\nof men... with regards to staying a bachelor...\n\nto be highly invested in something,\n\nlike Kant in a transcendent methodology...\n\nlike Kierkegaard invested in the arts...\n\nlike Nietzsche invested in waiting for\n\nthe fruition of his prophesies...\n\nyou have to be born to want to live\n\nthe simple happy life...\n\nthe \"expected\" life...\n\nthe whole Hiob

stereotype...\n\nthe smalls dogs bark... the big dogs bite...\n\noh sure, when i visit my grandparents\n\nback \"home\"... the older generation put\n\nthe pressure questions to the test:\n\neven women from Warsaw...\n\nso where's your girlfriend?\n\nto the old folk i reply: well i can't exactly force\n\na woman to be with me...\n\nto the women of Warsaw?\n\ni'm practially a monk...\n\nwhy?\n\nyou

beyond...\n\nit doesn't require a genius to figure out\n\nwhat's worth cherishing without having\n\nto feel obliged to the whole of humanity for...\n\noffspring - many already figured this out before me:\n\nyou learn to give birth to your self (reflective,\n\nand yes, not yourself - the reflexive)...\n\nwhich brings death to having to stand on its head...\n\n... isn't Sisyphus the son of Atlas?\n\ncouldn't Sisyphus just sit beside the stone\n\nand... well yeah: think up the philosopher?\n\n.em... looking back at the british empire, and the loud-mouth former colonial people... by god, i've never seen such leeches, i've never seen a people, so proud of being colonialißed! what's there to be proud of?! looks like in a post-colonial world, these former colonial busy-bodies had to, had to: step up and move their markers for Aladdin being performed in the West End... *******... never in the history of the world, were post-colonial people endowed with so much pride, the whole m'ah bwee'dish *******... to counter herr zeppelinmann with the pakistani in the p.s. framework of the british empire... rotherham... ring a pakistani blue?! have a guitar on y'ah?! see... i don't like these former colonial states, with their people migrating to england, having their overlord say it now, say it clear bollocking... i don't mind a top hat, tux donning ******* giving me directions... but when a ****- does it?! sorry... i'm so sorry... will you please excuse me?! i just don't like *******, i don't like the sort of people who celebrate being colonial subjects, esp. after the whole post-colonial celebration of \"libertion\"... i don't like ****** / pakis who have to find their \"past\" by playing the cricket ball of, \"the former\" colony! i hate copper skinned ******* of ****- origins! former colonial raj-vizier... how can you breed these sort of people, who find pride in being under colonial power?! the **** didn't understand freedom, only understood it when being subject to its lack?! well... so much for english women... i guess they were only going to go for pakistani grooming gangs... drowning in the ganges... i have as much of jesus christ on the cross in me, as i have plenty and enough of pontius pilate's worth of soap to mind the next few years; never in my life would i have to witness the former colonißed to bribe their way, into an acceptance \"speech\" methodology... the ****- to fable the englishman for his, \"tea\"... no conquered people, no colonißed people should ever glorify their conquerers or colonißers... i guess the british achieved a double subversion... why do the ****- (stanis) still play cricket... i don't want to know... i'm new here... but... but... when a ****- attempts to displace a european from europe? that's my breaking point... i don't like being displaced from europe... the next ****- that will? well... the obvious target, a northern english teenager girl readied for grooming. i said! next ****- that tries to displace an european from europe... well... i guess.. given the power of the current politicians... nothing! ha ha!\n\nwell, with the e.u. article x, y and z...\n\nherr zensor just flew over\n\nLondon
