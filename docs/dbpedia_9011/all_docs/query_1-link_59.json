        "text": "Western culture has a schizophrenic (conflicted) relationship with food – we cannot decide whether it delights or disgusts us, whether it is sacred or abject, magical or biological, so we treat it as all of these and more. An attempt to explain these schizophrenic attitudes towards the act of eating in western culture, this project examines representations of eating in five works of contemporary French literature by Amélie Nothomb, Muriel Barbery, and Joy Sorman. It specifically examines the individual’s experience of the act of eating within these works: ‘how’ do we conceptualize the function this act fulfills in our singular being, in our own subjectivity? And furthermore, ‘why’ do we conceptualize eating in this way – that is, schizophrenically? The ‘how’ is addressed by demonstrating the abundance of conflicting sentiments present in these authors’ representations of eating. The ‘why’ is treated through recourse to the philosophical underpinnings of western thought, demonstrating how these ideas actually structure our discussion of and attitude towards food and embodied subjectivity – how we understand ourselves as eating subjects. In short, this is an attempt at a conceptual architecture of the act of eating in western culture. The argument consists in demonstrating how conflicting theories of materiality in the western philosophical tradition undergird our understanding of eating. On the one hand, the legacy of philosophers like Plato, Plotinus and religious belief systems like Christianity, advance a notion of transcendence, where we distance ourselves from materiality and corporeality and aspire towards a superior immaterial dimension. On the contrary, philosophies of material immanence reflecting the ideas of modern science teach us that we are wholly material beings, prompting us to embrace materiality and corporeality. This project concludes that in contemporary discussions of eating, we are forced to grapple with both of these conflicting philosophical frameworks at once – we must reconcile our simultaneous impulse to transcend materiality with our impulse to locate ourselves within it. We resolve this conflict by synthesizing a new framework – immanent transcendence – where we relocate transcendence to matter itself. Food matter thus becomes mystified, endowed with creative powers and divine qualities.\n\nThe authors test the popular thesis of some of the most influential theorists of contemporary societies about the erosion of the social structuring of consumption choices and their consequent individualisation in westernised societies, using the example of food practices. The analysis is based on data obtained from a random sample of the Slovenian population within a research project entitled ‘Lifestyles in a Mediated Society.’ The aims of the analysis were: (a) to explore the role of socio-demographic variables in food practices, and (b) to discover the inherent logic that motivates each particular set of food practices and which makes them meaningful for the individual, by studying an association of respondents' food practices with their worldview and cultural consumption. A cluster analysis revealed six food cultures (Male traditionalists, Yes-sayers, Male modernists, Weight-watchers, Carefree hedonists, and Health-conscious hedonists) lying along a continuum where traditionalism occupies one end and post-traditionalism the other. The authors conclude that although two out of six food cultures crosscut socio-demographic affiliations and transform food consumption into a constituent part of a lifestyle as an identity project, there is still a significant influence of socio-demographic characteristics (particularly gender and formal education) on food practices in contemporary Slovenia. Furthermore, significant associations exist between food practices, on the one hand, and the respondent's worldview and cultural consumption, on the other.\n\nThis investigation of a point of connection between aesthetics and ethics unfolds in the context of a larger project on food, philosophy, and a reinterpretation of the relationship between the two. More specifically, my goal is to take food as a starting point for rethinking some of the basic categories of philosophy, with the understanding that the rather humble position afforded to the proximal (i.e., lower) senses by the tradition—and here I am thinking primarily of taste, but also of touch and smell (both of which, incidentally, are a major component of taste and tasting as a means of encountering the world)—constitutes a site whereupon we might begin to think seriously about why food matters, and for this discussion, how the event of eating as an aesthetic experience—food as art—might lead us not only to rethink an ethics of food, but also to rethink the very foundations of ethics more broadly construed. The impetus for this project has three rather distinct origins. The first is a prompt I employed while teaching my \" Food and Philosophy \" course: Monty Python's skit \" Art Gallery \" (watch it), which features the actual ingestion of works of art. 1 The second is my involvement in the planning of a recent exhibit \" A Feast for the Eyes \" at the Suzanne H. Arnold Gallery on the campus of Lebanon Valley College, which featured artist's renderings of food from traditional still life paintings to Warhol and Dali. The third, which provides the theoretical backdrop for this essay, is the recent work of Jacques Rancière on aesthetics and politics. My reflection on the aesthetics of eating thus places these origins within the horizon of what might be described as a general proliferation and even democratization of gastronomic experiences since the early nineteenth century. Such phenomena include, but are not limited to, the industrialization and mechanization of methods of food production from the farm all the way to the table, the acceptance of gastronomic taste as a metaphor for judgments of subjective taste in the arts and beyond (Korsmeyer 103-115), the rise of restaurant culture as a pleasurable and accessible possibility for the middle and working classes (Sweeney), the globalization of food economies and tastes, and more recently, the explosion and ubiquity of fast food, the rise of the chef as a cultural figure and icon, and the dissemination of food culture and knowledge through television programming dedicated to food. Such democratization, however, cuts both ways, and through my investigation I hope to expose the degree to which a particular distribution of sensible"
