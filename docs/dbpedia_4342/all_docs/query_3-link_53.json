It highlights that the analysis of translation practices is pivotal to unraveling the intricacies of inter-legal communication under imperial rule. Although part of the corpus analyzed in the article was originally written in the Maya Yucatec language, it can be viewed as the result of a process of translation in which two legal cultures were finding ways to be intelligible to one another. The article shows, moreover, that oral exchanges and nonverbal communication – through posture or clothing, and gift-giving – were also crucial in expressing consent in the Spanish empire.

        "text": "1In the Spanish empire, consent was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it was pivotal in legitimizing the imposition of Christianity and imperial rule on indigenous people –whatever the circumstances in which such “consent” might have been granted during the military conquest of America. On the other hand, in the writings of Friar Bartolomé de las Casas and other Spanish intellectuals, consent was an efficient tool to articulate and defend the exercise of jurisdictions by indigenous town councils (Cárdenas Bunsen 2014). But how did the Natives understand this concept when dealing with Spaniards? And, more importantly, how did they take advantage of it in specific political struggles? Two case studies of Maya actors’ negotiations in sixteenth-century Yucatan, New Spain, show that the notion of consent circulated not only through written practices, but also thanks to nonverbal communication and concrete actions. In section 1, I examine two letters that the Maya caciques sent to King Philip II in March 1567 and January 1580. In section 2, I analyse a series of records that were produced by both Mayas and Spaniards in the empire’s borderlands. This archival material offers an avenue for exploring how the caciques expressed the notion of consent in their own words and how they made use of it in their negotiations under imperial rule. I argue that the philological analysis helps unravel the intricacies of inter-legal communication, or the dialogue between actors for whom translation was a pivotal issue.\n\n3The knowledge accumulated through these multiple experiences of translation was collected and systematized in the first dictionaries of the autochthonous languages that the missionaries produced throughout America from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries (Hernández 2018; Surallés 2023). Obviously, this process evolved over time and was never completely fixed, since power relations and political issues were pivotal in translating legal terms from one language to another (Cunill and Glave Testino 2019; Payàs and Zaslavsky 2023). It is therefore true that the “reduction” of Native languages was part of an imperial project aimed at imposing a new religious and political order on the Natives (Melià 1993; Hanks 2010). Nevertheless, intelligibility was also at stake in inter-legal communication, since both the Spaniards and the Natives’ main concern was to understand each other beyond their eventual cultural differences. As Brian Owensby and Richard Ross (2018, 2) put it, settlers and indigenous peoples “misconstrued the other’s legal commitments while learning about them; and each strained to use the other’s law as a political, strategic, and moral resource. In doing so, each changed its own practice of law and dialogue about justice”. Some degree of tolerance towards the other’s views was therefore part of the linguistic equivalences that were drawn to achieve mutual understanding and legal translation (Arzápalo Marín 2016). This space of compromise could also give rise to misunderstandings (Lockhart 1999). For these reasons, I view the philological analysis of texts written by indigenous actors either in an autochthonous language or in Castilian as a means to grasp how Natives understood some Spanish legal concepts and made use of them to pursue their own political agenda.\n\n1. Expressing Consent in Two Letters to Philip II\n\n5My analysis, however, only builds upon the 9 March 1567 and 8 January 1580 letters. They were indeed longer and contained elements that can be related to the notion of consent. In the following lines, I argue that the caciques thought about consent as an acquisition of knowledge historically situated and contingent upon political circumstances. They used this concept as a means to appeal to the King’s royal grace, which was thought to be inspired by God’s mercy. Although the 9 March 1567 letter has been known since the 1970s, it has not received full attention from historians until recently. Stella María González Cicero (1978, 232-234) was the first scholar who published the Spanish version of the letter. Matthew Restall (1998, 160-164) published an English translation of the Maya text, but did not include the Maya original version nor its Spanish sixteenth-century translation. William Hanks (2010, 322) provided a bilingual (Maya-English) version of some short fragments of the missive. Zoraida Raimúndez Ares (2016) offered, for the first time, a complete transcription of both the Maya and the Spanish texts in her Master dissertation. As for the 1580 letter, it was unpublished until I edited it along with the 9 March 1567 one (Cunill 2023). This edition includes the facsimile of the original records, the transcription of both the Maya and the Spanish texts, and an analysis of the historical context in which they were produced.\n\n7More broadly, I consider the Maya caciques’ letters as part of the above-mentioned process of legal translation. In Yucatan, the Franciscans, with the help of Maya intellectuals, wrote the Calepino de Motul, one of the first Maya-Castilian dictionaries known to this day, around 1580 (Bolles 2004). Legal knowledge, however, might also have been circulating through formal and informal translation practices as early as the 1540s (Cunill 2015). In 1567 and 1580, the Maya caciques could thus build on this knowledge to write their letters. Though written in Maya words, the authors of the letters had a Castilian horizon. They aimed to formulate their arguments in a way that they thought was likely not only to be understood by the king and his counsellors, and to convince them of the legitimacy of their claim. When thoroughfully examined, the Maya words chosen by the caciques might also reveal their own understanding of the concepts on which imperial power was built, and the degree of political agency they were granted (and were willing to negotiate) under the Spanish rule.\n\n12In the following lines, the caciques added:\n\n15Interestingly, at the end of the letter, the caciques translated into Maya Yucatec the Castilian expression tus vasallos que besan las manos de tu Majestad as follows:\n\n17At the first lines of the 1580 letter, the caciques also began their text by expressing the way in which they conceived their relationship with the monarch. They stated:\n\n18According to the Calepino de Motul, cћuylic meant “cosa que depende y esta colgada de otra” (something that depends on and hangs from another). In order to illustrate this concept, the following example was given: “Dios ca cħuylic, ca cħuylicil tac lacal”, that the dictionary’s authors glossed by “de Dios dependemos y estamos colgados todos, que él nos sustenta” (we all depend on and hang from God, because He sustains us) (Calepino 1995, v. 1, 269). Thanks to intertextuality, a parallel could be drawn between the protection that the Christian god and the Spanish king were supposed to provide to their faithful vassals. A Maya word, cћuylic, and the imagery associated with it, was adapted to a new colonial context to express the nature of the political relationship that bound Maya people to their monarch. This idea of protection might have had roots in precolonial imageries. In his Arte para aprender la lengua mexicana (1547), Friar Andrés de Olmos, with the help of indigenous experts, dedicated a few pages to the metaphorical language used in the Valley of Mexico.\n\n2. Consent through Acts on the Frontiers of the Empire\n\n3. Conclusion\n\n28The 1567 and 1580 letters open avenues to explore the ways in which Spanish and Maya political cultures dialogued with each other. Their analysis indicates that the caciques systematically associated consent to Christianity with consent to imperial rule. In doing so, they showed that they understood the theological foundation of the Spanish monarchy and that they were able to use this argument to emulate the Spanish king’s Christian virtues, especially his mercy. Moreover, the caciques formulated the notion of consent in terms of the acquisition of rational knowledge that took place during the conquest of America. In this sense, it can be argued that they viewed consent as the result of a historical process in which each party came to compromise with the other. Namely, the caciques and their people were willing to serve God and the Spanish king in exchange for the divine mercy and the royal protection that both figures had the obligation to grant to their indigenous faithful vassals. The letters thus show how the caciques appropriated some legal concepts, reformulated them in their own words, and used them in the political negotiation with the Spanish crown. Consent supported the caciques’ claim that their language would continue to be used in evangelizing the indigenous people of Yucatan. It is also true that the lexicon and phrasing referred to a universe with roots in ancient times. The chosen vocabulary offers an avenue to unravel some of the gaps that characterized inter-legal communication. The caciques expressed consent in Mesoamerican tropes such as the parallel phrasing yalan auoc yalan akab, ‘under your foot, under your hand’.\n\n29The physical posture of bowing and kissing, which found an echo in the visual organization of the page, was central in expressing consent. The caciques metaphorically placed themselves and their writing under the sign of cross and the King’s name. By bringing together the analysis of the letters and the conquest of the Acalan, it becomes clear that acts, objects and words were closely intertwined when expressing consent in the Spanish empire. Although consent was mainly expressed through words and used in a negotiation with the Spanish monarch in the 1567 and 1580 letters, it is also true that these words referred to ritual actions, namely to bow before the royal authority and to kiss the king’s hands or feet. The very act of sending a letter to the king can also be viewed as an action, since it was a material document written, transported, and presented by concrete persons. Moreover, the letters had to follow a series of “ritualized” steps before arriving to the Council of the Indies and, eventually, to the monarch."
