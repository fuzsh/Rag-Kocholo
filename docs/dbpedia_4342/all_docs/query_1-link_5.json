        "text": "José Gálvez, marquis de la Sonora\n\nSpanish colonial administrator\n\nJosé Gálvez, marquis de la Sonora (born 1720, Vélez-Málaga, Spain—died 1787, Aranjuez) was a Spanish colonial administrator particularly noted for his work as inspector general (visitador general) in New Spain (Mexico), 1765–71. Among his important accomplishments were the reorganization of the tax system, the formation of a government tobacco monopoly, the reorganization of the defenses of the northern frontier of the Viceroyalty, and the occupation of Upper California. On completion of his inspection, he recommended further administrative and fiscal reforms, the most important of which, the intendancy system, was introduced in 1786. Subsequently, he was named minister of the Indies (1775) and was granted the title of marqués de la Sonora (1785).\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
