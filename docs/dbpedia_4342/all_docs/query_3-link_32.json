        "text": "1770s:Captain Gabriel de Rivera, Spanish first envoy from the Philippines and Manila's Attorney-General Captain1770s.\n\nHe was Spanish commander, who had gained fame in a raid on Borneo and the Malacca coast, was the first envoy from the Philippines to take up with the King of Spain the needs of the archipelago.\n\nAlready in 1575, we find a handful of Augustinian missionaries who were laboriously trying to preach the Faith among Pangasinenses. Their early arrival in Pangasinan was occasioned by a Spanish military expedition in hot pursuit against the Chinese corsair, Limahong, who made two attempts to conquer Manila. Failing in his undertaking, Limahong left Manila Bay and retreated northward until his party reached an islet near the mouth of the Agno river (between what is now Salasa and Lingayen) where he established his headquarters and began to rule the province in tyranny. Accompanying the forces of this expedition (1) under Juan Salcedo were some Augustinians, among them, Fr. Martin de Rada and Fr. Pedro Holgado, who took the opportunity to spread the Faith in the province.\n\n1 It is said that Juan Salcedo was accompanied by Captain Pedro de Chaves and Gabriel de Ribera and the expedition consisted of about 250 Spanish troops and 2,250 Filipino natives. (Cfr. GONZALES, Jose Ma. Op. Labor Evangelica Y Civilizadora de los Religiosos Dominicos en Pangasinan. University of Santo Tomas Press. Manila. 1946. P.12).\n\n1770: The will of Jose Miguel de Ribera about 1770. Know all who shall see this memorandum that I, Joseph Miguel Rivera, resident of this villa of Santa Fe, and the legitimate son of Alferez Don Juan Phelipe de Rivera, deceased and Doña María Estela Rendon Palomino, find myself ill in bed and make this last will in the following manner.\n\nI declare that I have been married according the church to Doña Manuela Olgin for a period of four years, more or less, during which time we had two children one girl named Juana Antonia, and one boy named Agustin de Jesus, who I acknowledge as my legitimate children.\n\nIt is my will that my brother and compadre, Salvadór Matias de Rivera, is my executor.\n\nI declare as my goods 200 ewes, which are united with those belonging to my mother and they are in possession of Jose Chabes, resident of Atrisco; with a share of twenty out of a hundred and half of the wool. It is my will that they remain with him the one hundred with the profit that belongs to it, to my wife Manuela Olgin; and the other hundred to my daughter Juana Antonia, in the same conformity with the profits.\n\nI declare as my goods, three beasts belonging to the mule family, two jacks and one mule, with four pack saddles with full equipment.\n\nI declare as my goods three horses, my riding saddle, bridle, spurs, little cushions, shield, gun with its case, ammunition pouches, which, together with the two cows and one little bull, are in possession of his grandfather, Antonio Sandobal, it is my last will to leave to my son, Agustin de Jesus, that he may enjoy it with Gods blessing and with mine.\n\nI declare a house which I have built at the rear of the one belonging to my mother, and it composed of three rooms, with free ingress and egress.

Rivera came from Compostela. His father, Don Cristobal de Rivera y Mendoza, held office in Compostela, first as public and royal notary and then as alcalde ordinario, or municipal magistrate. When Fernando was about 9, his father died. This changed the family financial status. The estate was divided among eleven children. The family need for money probably influenced his military enlistment at an early age.\n\nChronology\n\n1725  Born in or near Compostella, Mexico and baptized with the name, Fernando Javier.\n\n1742  Began military career at Loreto, Lower California at the age of 17.\n\n1752  At the age of 27 Fernando de Rivera named Captain of the Loreto presidio after 10 years dedicated service on the frontier.\n\n1767 - Serving with the Jesuit explorers, Fernando de Rivera established several missions in northern Baja from 1752-1767. In November of 1767 Captain Fernando de Rivera worked closely with Portola to affect the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries without stirring natives into rebellion.\n\n1769  Receiving high praise of Galvez and Portola for his handling of Jesuit expulsion, Captain Fernando de Rivera was chosen to lead the first overland party for the founding of Upper California. Captain Fernando de Rivera, comandante of the company of Loreto led 25 leather jackets and 40 Indians to San Diego over nearly 300 miles of unexplored northern Baja territory. Riveras men were declared to be the best horsemen in the world having attained that honor ironically in service of Jesuit explorers.\n\n1769: Captain Fernando de Rivera accompanied the expedition to discover the port of Monterey in May of 1769.\n\n1771: By 1771 Captain Fernando de Rivera had made at least 3 expeditions to Lower California to gather supplies, soldiers, and cattle for the Upper California. Rivera returned to the mainland and purchased a small farm near Guadalajara where he intended to retire with his family.\n\n1773  Captain Fernando de Rivera appointed military governor of Upper California. Rivera left for his new post in Monterey traveling via Guadalajara where he recruited 51 settlers for California.\n\n1774 - Captain Fernando de Rivera with Fray Francisco Palou explored the San Francisco area to select sites for a presidio, town, and two missions. Although the expedition was successful, nearly 2 years elapsed before any settlements were established. Rivera could not spare soldiers for founding the new posts. The same was true for mission San Buenaventura that was to be established near the Santa Barbara Channel. Captain Fernando de Rivera had only 60 soldiers available for service in Alta California. With some difficulty Fray Junípero SerraFerrer, O.F.M.and Captain Fernando de Rivera compromised by founding San Juan Capistrano between San Diego to the south and San Gabriel to the north.\n\n1776  Fray Luís Jaime was killed in an Indian uprising at San Diego. Junípero SerraFerrerand Captain Fernando de Rivera quarreled over Indian treatment following the uprising. Rivera was overruled in his desire for vengeful reprisals. Rivera traveled south and enlisted the aid of Juan Bautista de Anza who had arrived to found San Francisco to quell the uprising in San Diego. Rivera experienced health problems at the time, which resulted from a poorly set fracture. (This same fracture helped identify his bones after his death at Yuma). Rivera was also much disturbed that Fray Vincente Fuster excommunicated him on grounds that he had violated ecclesiastical asylum by removing the chief culprit of the San Diego uprising from the mission warehouse serving temporarily as a church. Riveras conduct alienated Juan Bautista de Anza. Rivera was deeply offended because Anza belittled his merits. Both military leaders wrote numerous reports to the viceroy, each blaming the other; and both receiving severe rebukes for delaying the founding of San Francisco.\n\n17771779  Captain Fernando de Rivera turned over the governorship of California to Felipe de Neve who assumed command of both Upper and Lower California with headquarters at Monterey. At Neves request, Teodoro de Croix, Captain General of the Interior Provinces ordered Captain Fernando de Rivera, to recruit soldiers and settlers for the founding of Los Angeles.\n\n1780  By late 1780, Captain Fernando de Rivera had recruited many soldiers and settlers needed for the new settlements in Alta California. The settlers were sent by sea to Loreto in Lower California and then to San Gabriel where they arrived safely on August 18, 1781.\n\n1781  In May of 1781 Captain Fernando de Rivera advanced across the desert with a vast herd of animals, nearly 1000 head. Over ¼ of them were too weak to ford the Colorado. He sent on to the coast the Santa Barbara recruits and their families together with part of the herd that could cross the river. Rivera himself camped near the eastern bank of the river opposite Conception with a small contingent of soldiers and the animals left behind. On Tuesday July 17th Rivera and his men were all killed by the Yumans in a surprise attack.\n\n1775: Juan Bautista de Anza and Francisco Tomas Graces explored a route from the Presidio of Tubac, Arizona, where de Anza was commander, overland to California. De Anza also founded the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose.\n\n1775: Juan Perez sailed from Port San Blas, Mexico up the coast of North America, turning around by northern Vancouver Island.\n\nIn 1776, Spain decided to create the new Viceroyalty of the Río de La Plata in part of South America. With its capital at Buenos Aires, the new viceroyalty was made up of territories formerly governed under the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\n1776 -1777: Fathers Silvestre Velez de Escalante and Francisco Dominguez along with 12 other men formed an expedition to attempt a route to Monterey from Santa Fe. They traveled into Colorado, discovered and named the Dolores River, then got lost until Utes guided them to the Uncompahgre River, north to Rangeley Colorado, then west into Utah, across the Wasatch Mountains through Spanish Fork Canyon, and to Utah Lake. That winter they traveled south as far as Cedar City before returning to Santa Fe, crossing the Colorado River en route. They were the first Europeans in Utah.\n\n1777: Teodoro de Croix (17301792) was a soldier and government official in New Spain. He was born in Prévoté castle near Lille, France, on June 20, 1730. He entered the Spanish army at age seventeen and was sent to Italy as an ensign of grenadiers of the Royal Guard. In 1750 he transferred to the Walloon Guards, bodyguards of the Bourbon kings of Spain. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1756 and was decorated in Flanders with the Cross of the Teutonic Order, which gave him the title of caballero. In 1760 Caballero de Croix was made a colonel in the Walloon Guards. In 1766, when his uncle Francisco, Marqués de Croix, went to New Spain as viceroy, Teodoro accompanied him as captain of the viceregal guard. The viceroy shortly appointed him governor of Acapulco. He became inspector of troops for New Spain with the rank of brigadier in December of that year and served in that capacity until 1770. The next year the Marqués de Croix ended his term as viceroy, and Teodoro sailed with him for Spain in company with José Bernardo de Gálvez Gallardo, who was retiring as inspector general. Poor sailing weather held up the voyage for five months in Havana. Thus Gálvez's young nephew, Bernardo de Gálvez, fresh from his first frontier command in Chihuahua, was able to overtake him and join the group for the rest of the voyage.\n\nCroix's career undoubtedly benefited not only from his uncle's status but also from the close alliance of the Gálvez and Croix families. The subsequent careers of both the two older men and their nephews-which followed a well-planned course-testify, if not to a Croix-Gálvez power scheme, at least to their tremendous influence at court. While the elder Croix became commandant-general of the Spanish Army, José de Gálvez advanced to the important post of minister of the Indies. Don José thus was able to implement his recommendation for separating New Spain's northern provinces form the viceroyalty to deal more effectively with the Indian problem. Teodoro de Croix was named commandant general of the new Provincias Internas jurisdiction and assumed his duties on January 1, 1777, the same date that Bernardo de Gálvez became acting governor of Louisiana.\n\nAs commandant general Croix found himself facing the animus of the reigning viceroy, Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa, who had been deprived of a portion of his jurisdiction. Croix saw little improvement in frontier conditions from the work of Hugo Oconór, a Bucareli appointee, who had undertaken a reshuffling of presidios to establish a new defense line to conform with the Royal Regulations of 1772 (see NEW REGULATIONS FOR PRESIDIOS). The staggering toll of Indian depredations all across the frontier convinced him of Oconór's incompetence. Croix faced the necessity of reorganizing the presidial line again. He ultimately returned some of the forts to their original position and buttressed them with a secondary line of fortified towns. In August 1777 Caballero de Croix left Mexico to inspect his jurisdiction. The entourage crossed the Rio Grande near San Juan Bautista on December 24 and remained in what is now Texas until January 22, 1778. At Monclova, San Antonio, and Chihuahua, Croix convened war councils to discuss with frontier officers the means of confronting the Apache menace that was common to all the Interior Provinces. Out of the juntas came a request for the new governor of Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez, to join Croix in the Apache campaign, uniting a Louisiana force to 2,000 troops the commandant general hoped to obtain from the crown. Such plans, which might have enhanced the stature of both men, were doomed by the prospect of Spain's entry into the war that the North American colonists were waging against England.\n\nCroix built up a more extensive military establishment over the entire northern frontier than any that had existed previously, with 4,686 militiamen and presidials under arms from Texas to Sonora. With his departure, however, the bulk of his policy was abandoned. On February 13, 1783, he was promoted to lieutenant general and relieved of his duties to become Viceroy of Peru. Two years later his friend Bernardo de Gálvez, having achieved notable successes in the war with England, was appointed viceroy of New Spain to succeed his late father, Matías de Gálvez. If the Croix and Gálvez families had achieved a colonial dynasty, it was short-lived. Bernardo died in office in November 1786. Caballero de Croix served as Viceroy of Peru from April 6, 1784, to March 25, 1790. In 1791 he was made a colonel in the king's bodyguard and a commander in the Teutonic Order. He died in Madrid in 1792.\n\n1779-1783: New Mexico Spanish soldiers under arms from 1779 until 1783 while Spain, along with the American Colonies, was at war with England.\n\nAlfonso Ribera/Rivera ( ). 1a. enl 29 Mar 1777, Sonora Exped, 1780/81, disch 28 Oct 1790, 21:811. 1d.

Although trade between Spain and its American colonies increased, Spain was unable to prevent other nations from trading with them, and smuggling of foreign manufactured goods increased. The Spanish government increasingly drained American treasure and resources, and the colonists resistance grew, with Creole leaders of the colonial society seeking more control and freedom to trade in other markets.\n\n1783: Spain permitted Americans to settle a portion of it, Arkansas, in 1783.\n\n1784: New Mexico Marriage Records for Miguel Geronimo de Ribera (My Progenitor) married María de la Luz Gurulé in 1784, at Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nApril 20, 1784, María de la Cruz Gurulé (daughter of Jose Gurulé and María Rita Montoya) and Miguel Rivera (son of Salvadór Rivera and Tomasa Rael) - married at La Castrensa in Santa Fe [SF-92]\n\nFrom 1760 to 1859, La Castrense Church (the Military Chapel), stood on the south side of the Santa Fe Plaza across from the Palace of the Governors. The churchs official name was Nuesta Señora de la Luz (Our Lady of the Light), however, most of the locals preferred to call it La Castrense.\n\nNew Mexicos Spanish Gov. Francisco Antonio Marin del Valle (1754-1760) paid 8,000 pesos to have the church built and, at its completion, locals and visitors marveled at its appearance and at the artistry of the churchs altar screen. The altar screen, which is made of limestone, depicts Jesus, Mary and various saints. Carved by santero and cartographer Don Bernardo Miera y Pachéco, the altar screen measures 18-by-14-feet and is recognized as a masterpiece from the Spanish Colonial era. The altar screens inscription credits Gov. Valle and his wife for donating the money to build the church (the altar screen was later moved to Cristo Rey Church in Santa Fe).\n\n1761: Miguel Geronimo (Jerónimo) Rivera (My Progenitor)\n\nBEF 30 SEP 1761 - ____\n\n·BIRTH: BEF 30 SEP 1761, Santa Fe, New Mexico [55414]\n\n·BAPTISM: 30 SEP 1761, Santa Fe, New Mexico [55415] [55416]\n\n·EVENT: Farmer, 5'2\" married\n\n·Military: 21 AUG 1789, Santa Fe, New Mexico [55417] [55418]\n\n·DEATH: Y (After 1805)\n\nFather: Salvadór de Rivera\n\nMother: Tomasa Rael de Aguilar\n\n[55415] Padrinos: Juan Ortiz y María de Rivera.\n\n[55417] Light chestnut hair and eyebrows, dark eyes, straight nose, heavy beard, fair skin, scars on outside of left ear and under chin.

The war party of 500 to 1,000 Navajos find the village's three foot thick, ten foot high wall difficult to breach. After a four day siege, with numerous casualties on both sides, the Navajos leave the area. The thirty Spanish families who have settled the village in 1800 see many more raids in the future.\n\nJanuary 17, 1805, - Spanish troops with Indian auxiliaries, Zuñi guides, and citizen militia, numbering more than 300 in all, commanded by Lt. Antonio Narbona invaded the stronghold of Canyon de Chelly.\n\nAttacking the Navajos who had entrenched themselves behind fortifications, they killed 93 Navajo warriors and 25 women and children. Three warriors, eight woman, 22 children, and one Moquino (Hopi) were taken prisoners; 350 sheep and goats, and 30 horses and mules were captured during the two-day battle. Included among the prisoners were Chief Segundo, his wife, and two children. Cristóbal, another Navajo Chief, asked for peace. According to custom, 90 pairs of ears from the slain Navajo warriors were taken, but six were lost in transit to Santa Fe.\n\nSpanish losses consisted of one Lieutenant of the Opata Nation, one man dead from pneumonia, 64 among the soldiers, citizens, and Indian allies wounded, and 85 horses which Lt.

She married Juan Rivera.\n\nChildren of Candelaria Crespin and Juan Rivera are:\n\n+Jose Luís Rivera, b. 1810 (One of my progenitors)\n\n1786: Each spring they formed small caravans and set out for the Llano Estacado, the high plains of eastern New Mexico, to barter at the Indian camps. Gov. Juan Bautista de Anza had made this possible back in 1786, when he arranged a permanent Comanche peace with chiefs visiting Pecos Pueblo.\n\nThe American Southwest owes its expansion partly to the Spanish carreta. The carreta was a crudely constructed two wheeled wagon pulled by oxen. The design of the carreta with its spring less axles and peg construction provided for a rough cargo ride.\n\nThe carreta's distinctive screeching wheels forewarned people of its arrival. \"The wheels are never greased, and as they are driven along they make an unearthly sound...\" wrote U. S. Attorney for the New Mexico territory William Watts Hart Davis in the 1850s. The driver feared if the wheels were oiled, that evil spirits would interfere with his trip, while screeching sounds scared them away.\n\nThere were many uses for the carreta. Women carried laundry to the river in them, and they were used to haul timber, trade goods, and supplies. The carts traveled over deeply grooved trails, so the very large wheel construction helped the carreta ride more smoothly. The carreta found its way with the Hispanic population to the Southwest, California, Colorado, Louisiana, and as far east as Kansas.\n\nOne of the romantic figures of New Mexico's early history was the Comanchero, a name that meant, literally, \"he who trades with the Comanches.\" Men who took up this dangerous occupation came from all the villages of the upper Rio Grande, from Taos and Santa Fe southward through Albuquerque, Belen and Socorro.\n\nThe caravans were made up of heavy two-wheeled carretas, the typical New Mexican ox carts manufactured of cottonwood from the Bosques River in Central Texas. They were loaded for the outward bound journey with such merchandise as tobacco, metal arrow points, guns, knives, calico, hats, beads and wine.\n\nVery hard, sweet bread was another common item, since it was much favored by the meat-eating Plains Indians. Having none of their own, they craved anything made of wheat. The New Mexican dried horno bread was so durable, however, that the Comanches had to break it up with their tomahawks and soak it before chewing.\n\nThe customers invariably demanded whiskey. So the Comancheros usually included several kegs in their carts. But from experience they knew to bury the liquor several miles before reaching the villages. This was a safety measure.\n\nAfter all the trading was done and the whiskey sold, the New Mexicans started swiftly for home, leaving one of their own behind as hostage for the kegs. When a half-day had passed, he would guide the Comanches to the burial site and then ride like the wind. He wanted to be far away when the drunken revelers forgot that the traders were their friends.\n\nOrdinarily, the Comanches were quite protective of the roving merchants from New Mexico. But this was not true of their allies, the Kiowas, who would attack on sight.\n\nIn the early 1850s a Kiowa war party came upon a Comanchero train from San Juan Pueblo. The Kiowas were on the point of butchering the lot when some Comanches arrived, intervened and saved the lives of the San Juans.\n\nFirst the Spanish government, and after independence the Mexican government, tried to regulate the Comanchero trade by issuing licenses to those wanting to participate. Following U.S. acquisition of the territory, American officials continued the policy but did so reluctantly, because of growing abuses.\n\nFrom the 1850s onward, the Comanches raided the new Anglo settlements in Texas, making off with thousands of horses and cattle. They knew that the Comancheros would gladly buy them all. Texas rancher John Hittson, who had suffered major losses, staged a raid of his own. In 1872, with 60 gun-toting cowboys, he swept through eastern New Mexico, seizing 11,000 head of stolen stock carrying his brand and that of his neighbors.\n\nThe Indian superintendent at Santa Fe wrung his hands in despair and considered suppressing the Comanchero activities altogether. But he long hesitated because of the traders' access to the Indian camps, which made them excellent go-betweens for ransoming captives taken in both Texas and Chihuahua.\n\nNevertheless, as the U.S. Army moved in the mid-1870s to end Indian hostilities on the plains, the Comanchero trade was outlawed.\n\nOne old-line merchant, Jose Tafoya of Mora, refused to quit, but he was soon arrested with his carts near Tucumcari, closing a story that had begun in Spanish colonial days.\n\n1789: Juan Manuel Rivera ____ - ____ Event: Farmer 5'1 Military: 1 AUG 1812, Santa Fe, Santa Fe County, New Mexico Event: Military Census: 1826, Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\n1790:\n\nTheir home soon became one of the most representative of the Buenos Aires society sites.

In Africa, in different periods, Spain held possessions on the coast of present-day Equatorial Guinea, including the island of Fernando Póo (now Bioko), and occupied territories in the Western Sahara (occupied by modern Morocco). In Asia, Spain ruled the Philippine Islands. In Oceania, Spain held the Maríana Islands and later the Caroline Islands. It is true that in some areas, especially in the Americas, Spanish sovereignty was more official than factual, with large tracts of wild and sparsely populated land remaining unexplored until the 1800s.\n\nBut despite the difficulty to control such a vast domain, Spain maintained much of the empire until the 19th Century. Today only the North African exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands, off the African coast, remain under the Spanish flag.\n\n19th Century: One out of every three cowboys (Caballero, the Spanish word for \"knight\" or \"gentleman\") in the late 1800s was the Mexican vaquero. In the Southwest, two decades before the pilgrims landed in 1620 on Plymouth Rock, when adventurous criollos (Spanish-born Americans) and Mestizos (mixed Spanish and Indian settlers) pushed past the Rio Grande River to take advantage of land grants in the kingdom of New Mexico, which included most of the western states.\n\nThey were called caballeros, \"One of the highest stations you could have in life was to be a caballero,\" said Chavez, a resident of New Mexico whose lineage can be traced to the Don Juan de Oñate colony, the caballero who was among the first cowboys in the U.S.\n\nVaqueros: All of the skills, traditions, and ways of working with cattle are very much rooted in the Mexican vaquero. If you are a cowboy in the U.S. today, you have developed what you know from the vaquero. This uniquely American figure (the cowboy), did not begin in America. He had his origins in the Old World. His principal antecedent was certainly the vaquero, who had seen centuries of development in Spanish North America before Anglos and their black slaves moved into the eastern United States.\n\nVaqueros were hard-working Mestizos who were hired by the Criollo caballeros to drive cattle between New Mexico and Mexico City, and later between Texas and Mexico City. The title, though denoting a separate social class, is similar to caballero, and is a mark of pride. \"Vaquero is a transliteration of the words 'cow' and 'man.' Vaca means 'cow,'\" said Chavez. \"Interestingly enough, in Spanish, we call ourselves cowmen; in English, it was demoted to cowboys.\"\n\nWhat we term the western saddle, Americans of the first half of the nineteenth century generally referred to as the Spanish saddle. Thus they showed their awareness of its place of origin. Americans of that time commonly used the term \"Spanish\" to distinguish whatever related to New Spain-Mexico and her provinces to the north: Texas, New Mexico and California. And within the locus of the New World, it was specifically in Mexico, (which included modern day New Mexico), that the western saddle originated and underwent a great deal of its development. By the outset of the nineteenth century the saddle used by the horsemen of New Mexico was founded upon a saddletree incorporating practically all the elements of design by which the western saddle tree is distinguished today. By the time Spain had set sail for the West Indies in 1492, two basic styles had been adopted and brought to the Americas with the horse, a la estradiota, and la jineta.\n\nFrom the 11th century West European institution of \"chivalry,\" (which originally had the same meaning as \"cavalry\") evolved the age of knighthood. The saddle of chivalry, (a la estradiota) consisted of two large rigid bows, the rear end couching the pelvis of the rider, connected by wooden planks. The seat was padded on both sides between the rider and the horse. The fork swell or pommel rose high in front of the rider so as to protect the stomach from the force of the opposing jouster's lance. The cantle was high enough to secure the rider from being forced over the rear of the horse and close enough to the pommel to further snugly secure the rider.\n\nIt was from the 'a la estradiota' and 'la jineta' styles and the saddles designed around those styles that the first vaqueros developed an American saddle to suit their own needs and preferences. From their research the saddle experts have a reasonably good idea how the western stock saddle evolved and appeared. However, because there are no surviving fully documented saddles from the colonial American Southwest and Mexico (1521-1821), other than a few inconclusive illustrations and literary references to the estradiota, jineta and later vaquero type saddles, there is no consistent agreement between authorities on exactly what the first vaquero saddle looked like. Given the old maxim that \"necessity is the mother of invention,\" it is a reasonable assertion that, there were as many prototypes as there were inventors, and they began with the examples of the Spanish import, la estradiota, and la jineta, and blended the most practical features of each and allowed the personal experience and the conditions of the deserts of northern Mexico and Southwestern U.S. to shape what eventually began to look like a \"functional\" prototype for what became the Spanish American, then Mexican, and later American western saddle.\n\nComments\n\nTo understand my mother's family, the de Riberas, one must appreciate the Iberian history of these Spaniards who came to the New World and were left to their own devices for survival. These colonists and later settlers were products of a warrior race which had come to see themselves as the only hope for a Christian world. Tempered by almost eight hundred years of war for independence, the Spaniards became strong and certain of their destiny. Having overcome the African Islamic Moors and gained freedom, they sought to explore and conquer the remainder of the world. Positive of their special relationship with God, these Spaniards went forth to spread His message. No other message would be tolerated, only His. The world view and mind-set of these Spaniards of 1595 would change little from their historical New World beginnings to their end as Spaniards and becoming Americanos.\n\nHer father, Isidro Ribera y Quintanas, family came from that beautiful peninsula to the south of the rest of Europe and a short distance across the water from Africa. War and conquest had been visited upon that land since the earliest times.\n\nThe de Riberas claimed their lineage from the Celts, early Galicians, Romans, Visigoths other Germanic tribes of Spain, although they were also Jewish. Each tribe had conquered and settled their area of the Iberian Peninsula. Each of the tribes was fiercely independent and proud of their heritage. The Romans were by far the most successful of the lot and eventually took the entire peninsula.\n\nBy the time Columbus sailed the Ocean and quite by accident found the Americas, Spain was a unified kingdom. Once claimed by Spain, the Americas became the latest lands for conquest and proselytizing. The indigenous peoples were quickly defeated and fell victim to not only the sword and the cross, but also to European diseases. Their numbers declined quickly and they were soon vassals of the Spaniards. As the Spanish explored, conquered, colonized, and settled all of Mexico, Central and South America they brought with them their culture, religion, state bureaucracy.\n\nAs each Iberian tribe had left its cultural imprint on what had become a unified Spain, with time, the tribes would share the Christian faith and values. Much of this would happen as a result of empire and those disparate groups being brought together by the transition of New World settlement.\n\nOver the course of 300 hundred years the Spaniards had accomplished as much as they could in the New World. They may have been the first to explore and exploit, but the world moved on. Their great empire was in decline. Too many wars and a failure to grasp the needs of their colonies left Spain unable and its people unwilling to expend the resources and energy necessary to maintain the Empire. It gradually fell. Not all at once, but like the Empire of Rome it experienced a slow agonizing death. The causes of this decline will be discussed in greater depth in Chapter Four.\n\nBy the 19th Century Spain was a hollow caricature of its once great past. The French and English had beaten her. The Americans were now in their ascendency. This century would spell the end of the Spanish in the New World. The Americans would take the North American Continent, the other colonies would each rebel and claim their own nation-state status, and the Spanish Empire would be no more.\n\nThe pride of Spanish heritage that the de Ribera family once reveled in was now coming to an end. The newly established Mexican Republic of 1821 would claim New Mexico and other areas of the old Viceroyalty of New Spain. Then in 1846, the Americanos would covet the land and its riches, take it, and exploit it to their ends. The once proud New Mexicans would become a people of little significance, no longer guardians of Spains most northern borders, just farmers and ranchers.\n\n1810:\n\n1810: Jose LuísRibera (My Great-Great Grandfather)\n\nBorn: 1810 in Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\nDied: October 1, 1891 in Pecos, New Mexico\n\nHusband of: María I.

One governor would be permissive and the next far from friendly. American traders never knew what to expect. Only after 1821, when Mexico secured her independence, did Santa Fe break away from the colonial trading system and become the major center for Mexican-United States commerce.\n\nThe year 1821 marked the end of Spanish rule in New Spain, and of course, New Mexico. In that year Agustin de Iturbide, raised the banner of rebellion and drove out the Spanish. A new nation called Mexico was born. The Spanish were removed from Santa Fe and a Mexican governor was appointed.\n\nNew Mexico became a different province. Trade was opened and the route between Santa Fe and Saint Louis became permanent. Americans came and went. For the first time in its history, New Mexico was able to develop her economy through trade. The conditions for New Mexico's citizens improved for the first time in a hundred years.\n\nYet New Mexico did not experience Mexican rule for long. In 1846 the United States declared war against Mexico over the Texas annexation question. New Mexico was taken by Stephen Watts Kearny in a relatively bloodless military operation. The Americans, like the Spanish, found that the land, the climate, and the great distances may have been too great for them.\n\nAs the Spanish period drew to a close, New Mexicans could look back at a history that originated some 300 years before. Back to 1540 and Coronado's first probing of the arid, hostile land that was so remote. From the outset New Mexico provided nothing but bleak prospects. There was no gold. There were no cities. The parched countryside, relieved only by the muddy Rio Grande, was so uninviting, so unpromising that it languished for another fifty years until colonists breached its hostile interior.\n\nProdded by the Church, authorities at Mexico City sent Juan de Oñate north in 1598. At this point New Mexico became a colony. The Spanish had the opportunity to remove themselves forever from New Mexico in 1680. The moral power of the Church and a fear of losing land to foreign powers brought the Spanish back. In 1692 the heroic figure of Diego de Vargas retook the whole of New Mexico. By 1695 Vargas had restored all areas of the province.\n\n1776 marked the greatest change in New Mexican governmental and military affairs since the days of Vargas. In that year, the Regulations were published. New Mexico was incorporated into the Provincias Internas. The Marques de Rubi's report, one of the most sensible ever written about New Mexico, brought many of its woes to the attention of the crown. It is a credit to King Charles III, his ministers, and various viceroys, that Rubi's perceptive ideas were implemented.\n\nDuring the 300 years of Spanish control, New Mexico can be said to have been a land in which Spain found itself entrapped. The forbidding land, its native peoples, the harsh climate, and other factors contributed to this Spanish entrapment. A century later, the United States, too, found this strange land to be a place of disappointment.\n\n1823: María Luisa Rivera Will 1823\n\nKnow all who see this testament that I, María Luisa Rivera, finding myself sick in bed, but in sound mind and judgment, order this will made in the following form:\n\nI declare that I have been married to:\n\nRetired soldier, Juan Garcia, we lived together for 28 years; in which time\n\nWe had raised eight children, five of those having died; and they were\n\n·Jose Santiago\n\n·Jose Antonio\n\n·Jose Luís\n\n·Juan Jose, who are children;\n\n·María de Loreto, married, living;\n\n·María Josefa\n\n·María del Carmen\n\n·Juana María\n\nI confess they are my legitimate children and heirs.\n\nI declare the house where we reside as my property and it is composed of five rooms and a porch; and a piece of land measuring 300 yards, leaving my bedroom to pay for twelve masses for the repose of my soul.
