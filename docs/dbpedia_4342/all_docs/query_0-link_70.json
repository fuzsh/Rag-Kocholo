Representatives from some states were not present.\n\nWelcome and Opening Remarks\n\nDr. Gerald Arkin welcomed the group via a conference call from his office in Griffin, GA. He could not attend the S9 meeting due to an urgent meeting on Monday evening relating to potential funding of a project on the Griffin campus. Dr. Arkin commended Gary Pederson, the curators and staff, and the S9 Committee for the germplasm repository functioning at its best in many years. He also commented about the relatively stable funding support that the SAES directors have provided over the past few years for conservation and utilization of the germplasm collections. Dr. Arkin reported that the S9 project is the only off-the-top SAES funded project in the southern region. He reviewed the role of the S9 Committee as being (1) providing annual state reports as accountability to the local AES director of germplasm utilization in their state, (2) advise Dr. Pederson and the curators on use and conservation of germplasm, and (3) lobby the local state AES director for continued investment in this program.\n\nDr. Mary Duryea, Assistant Dean for UFL/IFAS, welcomed the group to campus and to Florida. She stated that agriculture was a major source of revenue to Florida, $60 billion annually in agriculture products, second only to tourism. She also stated that IFAS was firmly committed to plant breeding and to germplasm use and conservation. She also stated that UFL had plans to add a $10 million building dedicated to genetic research and education.\n\nKen Quesenberry, 2004 host for the meeting, added his welcome to the group and covered local arrangement details.\n\nPGRCU Overview\n\nGary Pederson gave a presentation (Appendix 1)* covering the activities and improvements of the Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit (PGRCU) at Griffin during the past year. He reviewed the mission of PGRCU as well as the progress that had been made in backing up the various plant collections since 1996. Dr. Pederson also reported on the domestic and foreign distributions of germplasm from the unit during the past year. Additionally, he reported on the status of funding, staffing, equipment purchases, facilities acquisitions, repairs and maintenance. The committee commented on the continued positive leadership and improvements to the unit under Dr. Pedersons tenure as research leader.\n\nLegumes and Miscellaneous Crops:\n\nBrad Morris made a presentation (Appendix 2)* on status of regeneration and backup on various specialty uses (e.g., ornamental and human health) of some legume species such as winged bean, sesame, castor bean (ricin), water chestnut, and Crotolaria (protein and fiber).\n\nVegetable Crops and Sweetpotato\n\nBob Jarret described (Appendix 3)* the addition of an enhanced descriptor process of taking digital photos which embody 37/42 descriptors such as whole plant, fruit, and flowers regenerating. He reported that his program was regenerating ~150 accessions/year. He highlighted some of the work being done with okra (digital images), sweet potato (tissue regeneration), and watermelon (regeneration of heirloom varieties for storage in CO).\n\nMolecular Lab\n\nRob Dean reported (Appendix 4)* that the most recent molecular marker work had been focused on morphological traits and disease resistance genes in sorghum germplasm. The core collection of sorghum has been characterized for several traits.\n\n* Appendices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are located with the 2004 minutes on the S-9 website at http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/SoAtlantic/Griffin/pgrcu/reports/min2004.pdf\n\nExamples of Germplasm Use in University of Florida Programs\n\nEileen Kabelka, Cucurbit Breeding & Genetics, presented background information on important cucurbits in FL such as watermelon, cucumbers, squash and pumpkins. She reported that the market is driven by consumer preferences of size, color, flavor and seedless fruit (watermelon). Traits important in breeding new varieties to meet consumer preferences are disease resistance, fruit quality, uniformity, yield, and nutritional attributes. She cited an example of exotic germplasm utilization in the FL watermelon breeding program of using wild bitter gourd and wild species to obtain disease resistance. Another example she cited was using attributes of squash germplasm accessions and pedigree information to decide which material to use in crosses aimed at new variety development.\n\nKen Quesenberry, Forage Legume Breeding, distributed copies of three publications, New Plants for the South (1961), Value of University of Florida Forage Legume Cultivars to Livestock Production (1999), and New Plants for Florida (2003) that reviewed some of the history of the use of germplasm accessions in crop improvement and variety development for numerous crops that are important in Florida agriculture. Dr. Quesenberry briefly discussed the impact that plant breeding programs have had on FLs agricultural economy.\n\nDr. Barry Tillman, Peanut Breeding, discussed some of the history and goals of FLs peanut improvement program. He reported that the genetic base of the runner type varieties trace back to approximately 13 PIs. He indicated that the market demands flavor and uniformity and as such the market is dominated by a few varieties such as Florunner and GA Green. These have been driving factors for a narrow genetic base. Dr. Tillman reported that much of the utilization of plant introductions in breeding come through sources of disease and pest resistance (e.g., PI 209336 used as a resistant parent for tomato spotted wilt virus in peanut).\n\nNational Overview\n\nDue to flight delays and cancellations, Dr. Peter Bretting was unable to be present for the afternoon meeting but joined the group later in the day. Dr. Ann Marie Thro gave a general overview of the National Plant Germplasm System as follows:\n\nI. Background: The National Plant Germplasm System, NPGS, includes:\n\n- 4 multistate projects (S-9, W-6, NE-9, NC-7) which are multi-crop collections\n\n-6 more single crop collections\n\n-the National Center for Genetic Resources Conservation, in Ft. Collins CO\n\n-the Genetic Resources Information Network\n\n-and many other sites and units.\n\nThe NPGS is funded primarily by ARS (>90%). ESCOP* participates in the NPGS through regional funds to the 4 multi-state projects and off-the-top funds to one of the single-crop collectors (potatoes, NRSP-6). **ESCOP participates in planning and management of the NPGS via SAES directors who serve as Administrative Advisors: one director per region for the multi-state projects and four directors who serve as AA=s for NRSP-6. Collaboration between ESCOP and ARS provides increased management options and flexibility to the projects, and leverages additional funding and in-kind support.\n\n*ESCOP: Experiment Station Committee on Policy. ESCOP is composed of directors of State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES).\n\n**ESCOP funding varies from 8% to 22% depending on the project\n\nII. The NPGS is more valuable today than at any previous time.\n\nMolecular tools improve management efficiency and give new power to gene discovery using the collections\n\nConsumers are increasingly interested in variety and quality in foods. NPGS collections will be the source of new consumer traits to take advantage of this new market.\n\nMore restrictions and costs apply to international collecting of plant germplasm; international inventions will limit access in future.\n\nGermplasm is recognized by the Federal Government as important for national food security\n\nIII. Current challenges\n\nFederal funding is expected to be flat or declining for some time.\n\nESCOP interest in making funding available to new initiatives\n\nPotential for piece-by-piece dis-investment of ESCOP=s participation in NPGS before there is a long-term plan for ESCOP=s engagement with NPGS in future (may limit opportunities)\n\nIV. ESCOP and the NPGS - future and long-term\n\nShould ESCOP continue to be engaged with planning and management in the NPGS? If so, what mechanisms are available to ESCOP for continued involvement? The present system (4 multistate projects and 1 NRSP):\n\nHas strong regional support for some projects\n\nHas proven to be an effective way for SAES involvement to add value to the germplasm collections and get them into plant breeding programs and other research, producing benefits for science, educators, farmers and consumers\n\nMay be the optimum mechanism for the future - or - there may be other options that fit ESCOP's long-term plans\n\nTuesday, August 3, 2004\n\nThe group traveled to Citra, FL and toured the Plant Sciences Research and Education Unit. The tour highlighted the peanut, sorghum, cotton, corn, perennial peanut, pigeon pea, horticultural and ornamental research being conducted on the station as well as some of the research facilities and equipment.\n\nS9 RTAC Meeting Resumed\n\nChairman Jorge Mosjidis reconvened the group at 11:10 a.m., August 3, 2004 in room 1151 McCarty Hall. Dr. Peter Bretting presented the National Program Staff Report with the activities at the national level (Appendix 2). He reviewed: (1) the general budget situation for NPGS sites, (2) NP reviews, (3) public stakeholder meeting results, and (4) international germplasm issues. He announced that all of the RTACs would be invited to meet with the National Program group in Ames, IA in 2006.\n\nCommittee Members Discussions\n\nDiscussion focused on suggestions that could help the unit and the whole system make an even more efficient use of the resources available. (1) Dr. Tom Zimmerman recommended that the CGC reports be sent to S9 TAC members at least one week prior to the annual meeting. This would allow time for committee members to review the accomplishments and status of each project and be in a better position to make helpful suggestions. Dr. Pederson stated that attempts would be made to meet this request in the future. (2) Dr. Tom Stalker asked Dr. Pederson about upcoming constraints for the overall program. Dr. Pederson addressed four areas: (a) Land availability on the Griffin campus is on a year-to-year basis. The solution may be to lease 17 acres across from existing land on the Westbrook farm. On that property there is a need for well for irrigation, pump house and fencing. Dr. Pederson stated that there is land available in Bryon and at some other stations in GA, but the problem is distance. (b)Equipment - some need for additional pollination cages, (c) Additional herbarium specimens of species, especially for grasses. (d) Lists of major priority needs for each curator- needs vary by curators. Some use equipment that reduces labor loads; however, many labor needs are met by shifting farm crew members from one project to another at peak labor demands.\n\nDr. Stalker requested that next year Dr. Pederson provide the committee with a list of priorities for equipment and other needs of the program. Dr. Mosjidis commented that this would be very useful for the S9 TAC members to provide support for the Unit and helping the Unit stay on course. Dr. Stalker reiterated that the purpose of the TAC is give advice.\n\nDr. Mari Marutani asked if the digital photos could be entered into the GRIN network. Dr. Pederson reported that the GRIN data information was entered by a separate group in Beltsville, MD.\n\nTobacco Germplasm Collection\n\nDr. Tom Stalker brought up the issue regarding the tobacco germplasm collection that is being maintained at NC State University. For the past several years, NCSU has maintained the collection of ~2000 accessions + 200 species. The current dilemma is that the person who has served as the curator is departing and there is no person or program to take over the collection. The U.S. Congress has taken the stand that no federal money can go to support tobacco research, even though most of the basic research focuses on tobacco as a model plant or focuses on medical - pharmaceutical research using tobacco as a bio-factory. After some discussion a motion was made by Hussey and seconded by Allen that the S9 TAC recommend that the USDA take back the tobacco collection from NC State. The motion passed. The USDA-ARS representatives abstained from the vote. It was recommended that the Director of NC State Experiment Station take the action item to the next SAES directors meeting for their thoughts and action (especially the tobacco states).\n\nBusiness Session\n\nK. Quesenberry moved to approve the minutes as distributed and Zimmerman seconded. The motion passed. Mosjidis moved and Zimmerman seconded that Emerson Shipe be elected as secretary and Fred Allen as chair for the 2005 S9 TAC meeting. The motion passed. The location for the 2005 meeting was discussed and F. Allen volunteered to host the meeting in 2005. Quesenberry moved and Shipe seconded that the meeting will be held in TN in 2005, preferably during the first week of August.\n\nThe group thanked Dr. Quesenberry for hosting the meeting, and the participating FL faculty for their presentations.\n\nYearly reports from the S-9 TAC were distributed. State representatives were encouraged to complete one if they hadnt done so. Each report should include yearly activities, impact and publication.\n\nMeeting was adjourned 12:15 pm (Hussey/Stalker)\n\nAccomplishments\n\nThe complete accomplishments section for the 2004 S-009 annual report is located at the S-009 website (www.ars-grin.gov/ars/SoAtlantic/Griffin/pgrcu/s9.html). A brief summary of the accomplishments is listed below.<br /> <br /> USDA, ARS, Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit: Plant genetic resources collected or obtained from throughout the world are valuable sources of genetic diversity for use in agronomic and horticultural crop improvement programs in the U.S. This project forms part of a comprehensive nationwide program, National Plant Germplasm System, to preserve plant genetic resources for use today and for use by future generations.<br /> Two cowpea lines were identified with resistance to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) by Graves Gillaspie. These resistant lines could lead to development of cowpea cultivars with improved CMV resistance. Digital images of cowpea flowers and seeds were prepared for inclusion on GRIN. Twenty-five wild peanut accessions collected in Paraguay in 2003 were identified, vegetatively increased, and distributed to the Arachis Research and Evaluation Group by Roy Pittman. Researchers in FL, GA, TX, and Puerto Rico are evaluating the accessions for possible forage and horticulture use. A total of 775 cultivated peanut accessions were selected for regeneration. The entire seashore paspalum grass collection was fingerprinted by Melanie Newman and Ming Li Wang using transferred simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for more efficient curation of the collection and to aid in marker assisted breeding of this grass. Digital images were taken of grass and bamboo accessions. Genetic variability among genotypes of a lectin from hyacinth bean and sesamin and tocopherol from sesame was determined by Brad Morris in collaboration with AgResearch Consultants (hyacinth bean) and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (sesame). Fall regeneration of short-day African clovers was successfully conducted in the greenhouse. Regeneration of 2,100 sorghum accessions in St. Croix and Puerto Rico were conducted by the sorghum curator, John Erpelding. The Sorghum CGC plans to conduct a photoperiod sensitivity evaluation next year of 9,000 sorghum accessions maintained only at Ft. Collins and all accessions insensitive to photoperiod will be moved to Griffin. Accessions insensitive to photoperiod are in most demand by U.S. grain sorghum researchers. Bob Jarret characterized chile pepper species germplasm collections via digital images and descriptors. More than 1,500 vegetable crop accessions were grown for seed regeneration or maintained in tissue culture (sweetpotato). Almost 600 of the 700 sweetpotato accessions in tissue culture have been backed up in Ft. Collins, CO. SSR markers from common legume and grass databases were transferred for use to other legume and grass species including peanut, cowpea, clover, lablab, guar, seashore paspalum, bamboo, and bermudagrass by Ming Li Wang. An HPLC was purchased to characterize variation for phytochemicals among genetic resources within the collection.<br /> The -18 C cold room was upgraded with moveable storage shelves to maximize seed storage space in 2003 and maximize seed longevity. Germination tests were conducted on almost 8,000 pepper, sorghum, and 16 other crop accessions. Over 3,000 accessions were sent to Ft. Collins for back up samples. A 60 x 100 metal machine shed was purchased for storage of farm, regeneration, and irrigation equipment. 100 pepper regeneration cages were purchased by ARS.<br /> <br /> Alabama: Current work focuses on evaluation of the sunn hemp, clovers and Vicia species. Sunn hemp germplasm is being used for development of cultivars for the continental U.S. that can be used as fodder and as cover crops. <br /> <br /> Florida: Dan Gorbet and Barry Tillman, Marianna, evaluated peanut PIs for resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and other diseases (536059, 512249, 540866, 497358). Other PIs were evaluated as parents in our peanut CRSP project. Ann Blount and colleagues released two sexual tetraploid lines of bahiagrass, Q4188 and Q4205 (PI 619631 and 619632). Ken Quesenberry and Ann Blount evaluated Wilmington type bahiagrass (PIs 315732, 315733, 315734, and 434189) for forage and turf potential. Ken Quesenberry is evaluating native warm and cool season legumes for forage potential. Gordon Prine collected seed from tall ecotypes of castor bean to preserve adapted Florida genotypes for future research. Dr. Prine plans to release ornamental perennial peanut (Arachis glabrata) PI 262839 (Abrlick) and PI 262840 (Ecoturf) this year and three populations of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan).<br /> <br /> Hawaii: Quality and performance trials of HAES macadamia selections are ongoing at the Univ. Hawaii Expt. Station in Kona. Evaluation of the newest HAES selections (862, 879, 887, 896, 900, and 932) is ongoing at the Univ. Hawaii stations in Hilo and Kainaliu. Nutrient content of fruits for two longan cultivars (Biew Khiew and Sri Chompoo) growing at 3 different locations on the island of Hawaii are reported in the complete S-9 report.<br /> <br /> Louisiana: Blair Buckley, LSU screened the Vigna core collection for reaction to the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vignicola. Wink Alison, LSU, tested alfalfa varieties at the Southeast Station. John Veremis, USDA/ARS, Houma acquired exotic sorghum relatives to make crosses with Saccharum species to improve sugarcane. He planted the core collection of sorghum (2,000 accessions) and evaluated to provide yield data to potential growers. Stephen Boue, USDA, New Orleans will be screening samples soon for unique estrogenic compounds in legumes and other plants. Don La Bonte and Chris Clark evaluated sweetpotato accessions for genetic variability in uptake of Fe and Zn to enhance micronutrient levels to lessen nutritional deficiencies in developing countries. <br /> <br /> North Carolina: Plant breeding and genetics faculty at NC State University are conducting research on strawberry, blueberry, brambles, tree crops, ornamentals, maize, soybean, peanut, cotton, tobacco, small grains, turfgrass, knead, sweet potato, cucurbits, and other crops. Interdisciplinary teams are incorporating disease resistance, quality factors, or abiotic stress resistance from introduced plant accessions into their improved breeding materials and cultivar development. Germplasm collections include cultivated and/or wild species accessions of Nicotiana and Arachis species, South American maize, soybean, blueberries and sweet potato. Specific projects are reported in the complete S-9 annual report.<br /> The curator of the Nicotiana collection recently left the Department of Crop Science and maintenance of this collection may be problematic in the future unless additional resources can be obtained. The collection consists of approximately 2000 cultivated, 200 wild species, and a monosomic series for N. tobaccum. To adequately maintain the collection, a full-time technician and operating support is needed. <br /> <br /> Oklahoma: C. M. Taliaferro reported bermudagrass accessions have contributed to the breeding of new seed- and vegetatively-propagated cultivars. Yukon and Riviera are new seed-propagated and Patriot is a new vegetatively-propagated turf bermudagrass. Switchgrass accessions (110) were assessed for descriptors and many incorporated into breeding populations for studies of genetic variation and geographic adaptation. Shashi B Sharma, De-Yu Xie and Richard A. Dixon, Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Ardmore are working on condensed tannin biosynthesis in legumes including Desmodium uncinatum to introduce condensed tannin biosynthesis in alfalfa leaves. David Porter and Yinghua Huang, USDA-ARS, Stillwater screened 29,541 sorghum accessions from Griffin, GA for their responses to greenbug feeding. The germplasm is a rich gene pool for breeding insect resistance in sorghum.<br /> <br /> Puerto Rico: Resistance to sorghum anthracnose was identified for 196 accessions from Mali at TARS, Puerto Rico and College Station, TX in collaboration with Louis Prom. Stable anthracnose resistance over multiple locations will provide a more durable source of resistance. TARS-PT03-1, a small seeded pinto dry bean was released. In collaboration with Graves Gillaspie, Griffin, GA, 12 cowpea lines are being screened for yield and tolerance to cowpea chlorotic mottle, CMV, and blackeye cowpea mosaic virus. The regeneration of 2100 sorghum accessions with low seed viability was conducted at the Germplasm Introduction Research Unit, St. Croix. A total of 220 sorghum, 50 cowpea, 12 cucurbits, 15 winged bean, and 15 Leucaena accessions were planted at Isabela, Puerto Rico, for seed increase. Also, 420 sorghum and 42 corn accessions were planted at St. Croix for seed increase and release from quarantine. Photographs of 1500 sorghum panicles and 200 images of cacao pods, banana racemes, and mamey sapote fruits were entered into GRIN.<br /> <br /> South Carolina: A total of 29 watermelon accessions were distributed to Judy Thies and 364 cowpea accessions to Paul Berland, USDA Vegetable Laboratory, Charleston. Soybean PIs 548316 (Cloud), 548658 (Lee 74), 548402 (Peking), 88788, 89772, 90763, 209332, and 437654 were used in a greenhouse bioassay to categorize two South Carolina populations of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). A glyphosate-tolerant soybean line, SC00-1075, was released in 2003 by the South Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station and is marketed as AGS 825 RR. <br /> <br /> Tennessee: The following projects are being conducted at the University of Tennessee in which novel or exotic germplasm lines are being utilized. Fred Allen and Richard Johnson crossed a soybean fibrous root line, PI 416937, and cultivars with differing leaflet orientation to develop recombinant inbred isolines with different leaflet orientation and root trait combinations and compare their water-use relative to seed yield. <br /> Vincent Pantalone is developing new soybean populations with enhanced genetic diversity. The TAES registered the soybean variety 5002T (PI 634193), developed from the cross Holladay x Manokin. Four new cross hybridizations are being initiated to expand diversity for applied variety development. Early generation lines from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project, coordinated through the USDA Maize project at Iowa State University, are crossed with elite adapted corn lines. Dennis West, Univ Tenn and Major Goodman, NCSU have 891 experimental hybrids from the GEM project in yield trials in Tennessee. They also have 377 nursery rows of GEM material for inbreeding and selection. Janice Zale and Ludmila Ohnoutkova, Univ. Tenn., and Camille Steber, USDA/ARS, Pullman , WA have transformed one wheat germplasm line and one millet accession using the floral dip. Neal Stewart is evaluating the biosafety of genetically modified plants using the crop canola (Brassica napus) as a model to assess transgene flow, persistence and consequence to free-living wild relatives. He is evaluating the molecular mechanisms conferring tolerance in glyphosate-tolerant horseweed (Conyza canadensis).<br /> <br /> Texas: Peggy Thaxton and Wayne Smith, College Station, derived converted race stocks (CRS) of cotton from photoperiodic, primitive Gossypium hirsutum accessions collected in Mexico and Central America. With David Stelly, advanced interspecific backcross populations BC1F3 and BC1F2 between G. hirsutum with G. tomentosum or G. mustelinum were developed and are being evaluated. 116 CRS are being screened for resistance to fleahopper, aphid, and whitefly, seed and seedling disease complex, and nematodes. Studies were initiated with the CRS or their BC progeny for salt tolerance, drought tolerance, seed-seedling disease resistance, and fleahopper resistance. Selections were made in 2003 from a large population of F4 PR of G. hirsutum and sea island (G. barbadense). This material produced several very high fiber quality lines. John Gannaway, Lubbock, is increasing seed to initiate screening of wild cotton germplasm from collections at College Station (8500), Russia (6500), and CIRAD in France (2500) for insect resistance (aphids, lygus, thrips), disease (black root rot) as well as drought and salinity tolerance. Yin-Tung Wang reports that Phalaenopsis orchids for summer and fall flowering must be grown in air-conditioned greenhouses. Phalaenopsis Will Bates, Phalaenopsis Alameda, and Doritaenopsis Cherry Bates orchid hybrids were registered with the Int. Orchid Reg. Authority, Kew, England. Mark Burow reported wild peanut species were used to generate interspecific breeding lines that developed COAN and NemaTAM. These materials are currently being used to develop leaf-spot resistant peanut cultivars. In addition, Bolivian landraces are being examined for early maturity and an African accession is being used for developing early maturity Spanish and runner populations to combine earliness with high yield and a high oleic/linoleic ratio.<br /> <br />\n\nPublications\n\nUSDA Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit<br /> <br /> Wang, M.

This is the greatest number of accessions distributed in one year from the Griffin location since the plant genetic resource collection was established in 1949.\n\nThe germplasm collection at Griffin, Georgia has increased to 83,601 accessions of 246 genera and 1,432 species. In the last year, 87% of the collection is backed up at the National Center for Genetic Resource Preservation and 84% of the accessions are available for use by the research community.\n\nAll accessions were requested from the Griffin location directly by researchers and distributed in 582 orders to users in 44 states and 35 foreign countries. The demand for genetic resources from Griffin has grown from an average of 13,000 accessions distributed per year in the 1990s to an average of over 35,000 accessions distributed per year since 2000.\n\nAdditional impact statements and future plans are noted within the complete 2004 S-009 annual report located at the S-009 website www.ars-grin.gov/ars/SoAtlantic/Griffin/pgrcu/s9.html\n\nBack to top\n\nDate of Annual Report: 09/15/2005\n\nReport Information\n\nAnnual Meeting Dates: 08/02/2005 - 08/03/2005\n\nPeriod the Report Covers: 08/01/2004 - 08/01/2005\n\nParticipants\n\nTAC Members:\n\nFred Allen, Chair (allenf@utk.edu) University of Tennessee, TN\n\nThomas G.

Representatives from some states were not present.\n\nWelcome and Opening Remarks: Dr. Gerald Arkin welcomed the group and stated his responsibility as representative for S-9 to the Southern Agricultural Experiment Station Directors. He stated that the S9 project is an off-the-top SAES funded project in the southern region. He then encouraged each state committee member to communicate with his/her experiment station director about the importance of the S-9 project and how it serves each state in the region. He commented briefly on a report to be released soon by a national germplasm task force committee. The objective of the task force is to strengthen U.S. germplasm programs. Dr. Quesenberry and Dr. Bretting also commented briefly about the task force and the outcome of their deliberations. It is anticipated that a National Germplasm Coordinating Committee will be formed with membership from ESCOP, CSRES, and ARS. Dr. Arkin has been asked to be one of the committee members from the ESCOP group (state agricultural experiment station directors). It was suggested that a link to the task force report be added to the S-9 web page.\n\nFred Allen, 2005 host for the meeting, added his welcome to the group and covered local arrangement details.\n\nMr. Buddy Mitchell, Interim Vice-President, Institute of Agriculture, Univ. of Tennessee welcomed the group to campus and to Tennessee. He gave a brief overview of agriculture in Tennessee emphasizing the states diverse geography and agricultural commodities. He high-lighted the success of U.S. farmers by showing a graph depicting dramatic corn yield increases and relatively flat corn prices from 1900 through 2000. Other graphs illustrated the relatively small percentage of income that Americans spend on food and the increasing importance of agricultural research to allow farmers to compete in a global economy. He also discussed the importance of continued adequate funding for individual state research and extension priorities.\n\nNational Overview: Dr. Peter Bretting presented three written reports: (1) 2005 National Program Staff Report for Program 301 - Plant, Microbial, and Insect Genetic Resources, Genomics, and Genetic Improvement, (2) June, 2005 Report from the National Germplasm Resources Laboratory and Plant Exchange Office and (3) The GRIN 2005 Report to Regional Technical Advisory Committees. Highlights of the report included:\n\n- Retirements of Allan Stoner (Beltsville) , Loren Wiesner (Ft. Collins) , and Ed Percival (College Station)\n\n- The NGRL supported fifteen plant explorations and one plant exchange expedition in 2004.\n\n- Despite recent increases, budgets at some NPGS sites are still strained. The FY05 budget contained modest increases for plant genetic resource management in maize genetic enhancement. Future outlook is somewhat bleak since the budget for USDA-ARS is in the discretionary dollars category.\n\n- Assessment for NP301s first five-year cycle (2000-2005) is underway. An accomplishment report will be developed which will serve as the basis for an assessment conducted by an external review panel. A report from the panel will be presented at the second NP 301 Customer-Stakeholder Workshop scheduled for November, 2005.\n\nPGRCU Overview: Gary Pederson gave a presentation (Appendix 1)* covering the activities and improvements of the Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit (PGRCU) at Griffin during the past year. He reviewed the mission of PGRCU as well as the progress that had been made in backing up the various plant collections since 1996. A total of 84,446 accessions are held at Griffin as of June, 2005. Dr. Pederson also reported on the domestic and foreign distributions of germplasm from the unit (24,102) during the past year. A total of 8,260 digital images (plant, flowers, leaves, seed, etc.) have been entered in the GRIN system for seven different crop species. Additionally, he reported on the status of funding, staffing, equipment purchases, facilities acquisitions, repairs and maintenance. A list of needs and priorities related to equipment and personnel were presented as requested by the S-9 Committee in 2004.\n\nVigna: Graves Gillaspie made a presentation (Appendix 2)* on the status of regeneration and distribution of Vigna species. He also described an extensive effort to provide digital images of flowers, seeds, leaves, and pods through the GRIN system and demonstrated how to access in the GRIN system.\n\nGermination Lab: Dave Pinnow described ongoing work in the germination laboratory (Appendix 3)*. Since 2001, over 27,000 germination tests have been conducted at Griffin. Germination test results for seed from new regenerations and seed in cold storage were presented for sorghum, pepper, peanut, Vigna, and watermelon.\n\nMolecular Lab: Noelle Barkley (Appendix 4)* described the molecular procedure known as TILLING (target induced local lesions in genomes). She described several advantages of TILLING including cost benefits and ability to screen large numbers of individuals rapidly to assess natural genetic variation. Specific goals are: (1) to assess natural genetic variation in 100 mung bean accessions (within and between), identify SNPs, and design SNP markers; and (2) assess diversity in the peanut collection, develop SNP markers, and assay the collection for disease resistance...\n\nSorghum: John Erpelding, located at Mayaguez, Puerto Rico reported on research efforts (Appendix 5)* in (1) screening for ergot resistance, (2) screening for anthracnose resistance, (3) germplasm regeneration, (4) wild sorghum species regeneration, and (5) germplasm characterization. Digital imaging of panicles is being utilized to characterize accessions from Ethiopia.\n\n* Appendices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are located with the 2005 minutes on the S-009 website\n\nwww.ars-grin.gov/ars/SoAtlantic/Griffin/pgrcu/s9report.html\n\nUniversity of Tennessee Programs: Tim Rials, director of the Univ. of Tennessee Forestry Products Center made a presentation describing the importance of the forestry industry in Tennessee. He reviewed some of the research projects his group is working on to enhance wood processing and development of new wood products in the U.S.\n\nVince Pantalone, soybean breeder, described the importance of plant introductions in his breeding program. His primary goals are improvement of seed yield and seed quality. Plant introductions have been utilized for modification of fatty acid levels and drought tolerance. Recent cultivar releases include 5002T and 5601T.\n\nWednesday, August 3, 2005\n\nThe group traveled a few miles south of campus on Hwy. 129 to the East Tennessee Research and Education Center, Plant Science Unit. Presentations were made by John Hodges, superintendent, Dennis West, grains breeder, Fred Allan, and Richard Johnson. Dr. Hodges gave an overview of the Plant Sciences Unit. Dr. West discussed his work in corn breeding and showed some progeny of hybridizations between corn and teosinte. Richard Johnson discussed his research with Dr. Allen on soybean leaf orientation/root morphology trait combinations as related to water use efficiency.\n\nS-9 TAC Meeting Resumed: Chairman Fred Allen reconvened the group at 11:00 a.m., August 3, 2005 in room 128 Ellington Plant Sciences Building.\n\nCommittee Members Discussions\n\nTobacco Germplasm Collection: At the 2004 meeting the S9 TAC voted and recommended that the USDA take back the tobacco collection from NC State. The USDA-ARS representatives abstained from the vote. It was recommended that the Director of NC State Experiment Station take the action item to the next SAES directors meeting for their thoughts and action (especially the tobacco states). Apparently, there has been no action taken on this issue. There was considerable discussion as to what action the Committee might recommend. It was suggested that committee members from those states where tobacco is an important economic crop take the 2004 recommendation to their respective experiment station directors. It was pointed out that a considerable portion of the current tobacco germplasm collection is used for purposes other than variety development. This discussion has implications for other state-maintained germplasm collections as well including the wild Arachis spp. collection in Texas, a clover collection at the Univ. of Kentucky, and the tropical/subtropical forage collection (mainly legumes) in Florida.\n\nBusiness Session: Tim Phillips was elected secretary and Emerson Shipe chair for the 2006 S-9 TAC meeting. Dr. Peter Bretting stated that a national meeting of regional germplasm committees is scheduled at Ames, Iowa on June 6-8, 2006. It will be hosted by the North Central Regional PI Station and organized by Candice Gardner, research leader. The likely agenda is a two day meeting with one-half day allotted for a tour, national presentations, and individual regional committee meetings, respectively. A motion was made by Ken Quesenberry and seconded by Tom Zimmerman that the S-9 committee participate in and hold our annual meeting in conjunction with the national meeting at Ames. Motion passed. The incoming chair was urged to send out a reminder email to committee members early in 2006 providing the dates of the 2006 meeting.\n\nThe group thanked Dr. Allen for hosting the meeting, and the participating University of Tennessee faculty for their presentations.\n\nYearly reports from the S-9 TAC were distributed and each state representative present gave a brief summary. Reports should include yearly activities, impact and publications. Melanie Newman, grass curator at PGRCU, Griffin, gave a brief report on her work with warm season grasses. Gary Pederson requested guidance as to how to incorporate long state reports into the S-009 annual report on the National Information Management and Support System (NIMSS) website since it will not accommodate a long report. The Committee preferred to continue to put the longer, more complete state reports on the S-009 website and a shorter condensed version on NIMSS.\n\nMeeting was adjourned 12:05 pm.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nThe complete accomplishments section for the 2005 S-009 annual report is located at the S-009 website (www.ars-grin.gov/ars/SoAtlantic/Griffin/pgrcu/s9.html). A summary of the accomplishments from the Griffin location and S-009 cooperators is listed below.<br /> <br /> USDA, ARS, Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit: Plant genetic resources collected or obtained from throughout the world are valuable sources of genetic diversity for use in agronomic and horticultural crop improvement programs in the U.S. This broad genetic diversity enables research programs to efficiently produce new cultivars, develop new knowledge, discover value-added uses, and preserve food security for the general public. The germplasm collection at Griffin, GA has increased to 84,446 accessions of 244 genera and 1,437 species. In 2004, a total of 24,102 seed, tissue culture, and clonal accessions were distributed to users for their research use. All accessions were requested from the Griffin location directly by researchers and distributed in 918 orders to users in 41 states and 31 foreign countries. In the last year, 91% of the collection is backed up at the National Center for Genetic Resource Preservation and 85% of the accessions are available for use by the research community. Backing up safely secures these plant genetic resources for future use by researchers and good availability provides users with a wide array of currently available germplasm. A cowpea line was identified and released with resistance to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) by Graves Gillaspie. This resistant line could lead to development of cowpea cultivars with improved CMV resistance and increased yields. Roy Pittman, in cooperation with researchers in Georgia, Florida, and Bolivia, identified two advanced cultivated peanut lines for possible release. The lines have new sources of disease resistance for tomato spotted wilt virus, early and late leaf spot, and rust. Seed increases were successful for 807 cultivated peanut accessions. A total of 124 accessions of cultivated peanuts were processed through quarantine to be available for researchers. The entire finger millet collection (671 accessions) was regenerated by Melanie Newman and a core collection including additional descriptor data was formed. Regeneration of the entire bahiagrass collection (178 accessions) was initiated at Byron, GA, in 2004 and seed harvesting initiated in 2005. Based on results from a molecular study of the bamboo collection, two contaminated plots were identified and will be renovated to remove contaminants. Amounts of four phytochemicals (daidzein, genistein, quercetin, and kaempferol) were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from 36 guar accessions. Genetic variability of 96 guar accessions was determined using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and morphological data. Regeneration of 45 Trifolium tembense, a short-day African clover, accessions was successfully conducted in the greenhouse during the fall. Regeneration of sorghum accessions in St. Croix and Puerto Rico continued in coordination with the sorghum curator, John Erpelding. Over 1,100 accessions were sent to St. Croix for regeneration and seed from the first set of regenerations has arrived at Griffin. Bob Jarret characterized 700 accessions of the Capsicum annuum (chile pepper) germplasm collection. Almost the entire U.S. sweetpotato collection (96%) maintained in tissue culture has been backed up in Ft. Collins, CO. In 2001, only 12% of the collection was backed up. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from wheat, rice, maize, and sorghum database were transferred for use to other grass species including finger millet, seashore paspalum, and bermudagrass by Ming Li Wang. Germination tests were conducted on over 9,100 accessions in 2004. Over 5,500 accessions were sent to Ft. Collins for new back up or replacement of other back up samples. Over 7,200 accessions were put into -18 C storage. Currently, almost 58% (over 48,500 accessions) of the entire collection has at least one sample in -18 C storage.<br /> <br /> Alabama: Work continues on evaluation of sunn hemp, sericea lespedeza, clovers and Vicia species. Sunn hemp germplasm is being used for development of cultivars that can be used as fodder and as cover crops. Evaluations are being done in cooperation with colleagues at Auburn, GA, LS, AR, and USDA at several locations. Evaluation of the TX collection of upland cotton (G. hirsutum) for resistance to reniform nematode, and tolerance or resistance to heat and drought stress is being conducted to find resistance and incorporate it into adapted cotton germplasm. Evaluations are in cooperation with colleagues at Auburn. Phylogenetic relationships of Citrullus were studied using DNA sequences from several chloroplast regions.<br /> <br /> Florida: In 2004, 418 PIs of 20 different plant species were distributed to 37 different individuals representing private breeders, USDA and University of Florida scientists, and the general public. Some examples of those uses are listed below. Dr. K. H. Quesenberry, Univ. Florida, is evaluating bahiagrass PIs for forage potential and native forage legume germplasm (Desmodium incanum and Lotononis bainesii) for use in mixtures with bahiagrass. Four PI selections of Arachis glabrata are being evaluated for possible cultivar release. Dr. Ann Blount, Univ. Florida, is selecting bahiagrass for increased fall and spring growth in bahiagrass, leaf tissue tolerance to moderated frost events, and resistance to dollar spot disease. Dr. Kevin Kenworthy, Univ. Florida, is evaluating various plant introductions of zoysiagrass and bermudagrass. Dr. Jay Scott, Univ. Florida, has found resistance to bacterial spot race T4 in PI 114490 and PI 126932 of tomato. The inheritance of T4 resistance is the main subject of a Ph.D. students dissertation. Dr. Barry Tillman, Univ. Florida, reports that PI 576623 is the grandparent of some peanut breeding lines that in field testing have the highest level of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) resistance that we have seen to date. Dr. Eilene Kabelka, Univ. Florida, reports that the Cucurbita and Citrullus PI material obtained from S-9 during 2004 is being utilized as sources of beneficial genes for introgression into squash and watermelon, respectively. Beneficial genes that may be obtained from this material include resistance to papaya ring spot virus, watermelon mosaic virus, zucchini yellow mosaic virus, phytophthora blight, and powdery mildew.<br /> <br /> Georgia: More than 50 different requests for a total of 855 plant accessions were supplied to University scientists, USDA scientists, consultants, seed companies, gardeners, and numerous individuals. The most requested crops were peanut, pepper, various legumes, and bamboo. The University of Georgia has strong plant breeding and advanced molecular biology programs that supply new crop cultivars and associated technologies to our agricultural sector and rely heavily upon the plant materials maintained within the S-9 unit. UGA currently has active cultivar development programs in soybean, peanut, small grains, turfgrasses, forages, blueberries, and numerous ornamental crops that frequently utilize the plant genetic resource collections. In addition, research programs in crop science, horticulture, plant pathology, entomology and other disciplines utilize the genetic resources of the S-9 unit in both basic and applied research projects.<br /> <br /> Guam: Field evaluation of hot peppers (Capsicum annuum) and large tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) was conducted for their adaptation to tropical environment, pest resistance, and consumer preference in Guam. The consumers preferred local very pungent peppers than high yielded Taiwan cultivars. A new large tomato cultivar Solar Fire developed at the University of Florida performed well and comparably with the other heat tolerant cultivar Solar Set. The phenetic analysis of sweetpotato accessions indicated that germlines from Guam and Rota were very similar. Germplasm collection, conservation and distribution continued.<br /> <br /> Hawaii: Evaluations of six new macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) selections are in progress at two Univ. Hawaii Research Stations. Selection 932 exhibits greater precocity compared to the standard industry cultivars. Longan (Dimocarpus longan) trials showed that flowering in three cultivars was stimulated within 2 months after trees were treated with soil drenches containing calcium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite. In commercial rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) orchards in Hawaii fruit set is often limited by the production of low numbers of male flowers for pollination. Earlier we showed that the potassium salt of NAA (K+NAA) at 90 ppm could stimulate the development of male flowers on rambutan panicles which are comprised primarily of functionally female flowers. Experiments treating 11 rambutan cultivars with the potassium salt of NAA stimulated male flower production and induced male flowers to produce viable pollen for pollination.<br /> <br /> Louisiana: Accessions of sweetpotato were obtained to screen germplasm for iron and zinc uptake potential. Initial results show about a 50% variation among accessions in their ability to uptake these micronutrients. Additional germplasm was requested for on-going work towards developing resistance to various sweetpotato viruses. The Vigna collection is routinely assessed for resistance reactions to the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vignicola. The sorghum collection is being used to make crosses to improve sugarcane. Work on legumes is focused on identifying other sources of isoflavones other than soybean.<br /> <br /> Mississippi: The kenaf (Hisbiscus cannabinus L.) breeding program at Mississippi State University is selecting for altered leaf-shape and yield and anticipate a cultivar release in 2005. The USDA corn host plant resistance program is developing sources of resistance to Aspergillus flavus and various corn insects. A proposal for the release of a new germplasm (Mp717) with enhanced tolerance of aflatoxin has been submitted for review. The USDA Cotton Breeding program at Mississippi State University has been evaluating the use of random mating among diverse cultivars to obtain recombination among desirable yield and fiber quality traits in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). This group also released 14 upland cotton, primitive-derived germplasm lines with improved fiber strength and 21 BC4-F4 noncommercial flowering day neutral germplasm lines of upland cotton involving Gossypium hirsutum L. race accessions in 2004. <br /> <br /> North Carolina: Faculty in the Crop Science and Horticultural Science Departments at NC State University conduct research on strawberry, blueberry, brambles, tree crops, ornamentals, maize, soybean, peanut, cotton, tobacco, small grains, turfgrasses, sweet potato, cucurbits, and other crops. In tobacco, a new burley tobacco cultivar, NC 103, was released with high levels of resistance to multiple viruses and diseases. In small grains, four germplasm lines were released with significantly more freezing tolerance than the most winter hardy oat. A new hulless oat, cultivar NC-Hulless, was released with superior performance for the horse industry. High yielding peanut lines N98003 and N00090ol were proposed for cultivar release; N00090ol is the first large-seeded peanut with high oleic acid content. Three new peanut cultivars were developed for the boiling market. In cotton, 9,239 EST sequences representing genes expressed during the secondary wall phase of cotton fiber development were deposited in GenBank. Soybean lines were identified with resistance to soybean cyst nematode. A total of 19 corn breeding lines were released. Transgenic tall fescue plants were obtained with more tolerance to water deficiency than other known tall fescue genotypes. Additional cultivar releases have been made in the peach and blueberry programs. Dr. Jennifer Levin, Assist. Professor of Crop Science, is the curator of the national Nicotiana collection. The collection has about 2,000 cultivated and 200 species accessions maintained by the NC State Univ. College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Technical and operating support will be needed for proper maintenance in the future.<br /> <br /> Oklahoma: <br /> Yinghua Huang, USDA-ARS, is identifying new sources of genetic resistance to greenbug (i.e. aphid) pest through evaluation of all available sorghum germplasm. Over 40,000 accessions received from NPGS are tested against greenbug feeding through artificial infestation in greenhouse. Twain Butler, The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, is evaluating 7 PIs of Strophostyles helvula (trailing wild bean) to select lines with desirable maturity and agronomic characters suitable for summer reseeding legume in permanent pastures. He is also comparing PI 215298 Strophostyles leiosperma (smooth-seeded wild bean) with local ecotype collections to select lines with desirable reseeding ability. Tim Springer, USDA-ARS, is increasing seed of little bluestem PIs (Schizachyrium scoparium) to develop a larger population of plants to select for seed and forage production.<br /> <br /> Puerto Rico: In 2004, three researchers in Puerto Rico requested a total of 322 seed samples of Sorghum (302), Vigna (4), and Desmodium (16) from the Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit in Griffin, GA. Numerous research studies were conducted by the University of Puerto Rico scientists. Field studies of quenepa (Melicoccus bijugatus) clones; guava (Psidium guajava) accessions; plantain and banana (Musa sp.) clones; yam (Dioscorea sp.), cassava (Manihot esculenta), and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) collections; sweet cherry pepper (Capsicum chinense) accessions; citrus plantings with various rootstock/scion combinations; mango (Mangifera indica) clones; fresh market tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) variety trials; maize (Zea mays) populations were conducted at numerous locations in Puerto Rico. USDA, ARS, Tropical Agricultural Research Station scientists evaluated sorghum accessions from Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Mali for anthracnose resistance. Cultivars and rootstock of lychee (Litchi chinensis), rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum), longan (Dimocarpus longan), mamey sapote (Pouteria sapota), and sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) were surveyed for susceptibility to root-feeding pests. Mamey sapote supported the most root pests and longan supported the fewest. All 84 accessions in the banana (Musa spp.) collection will be evaluated for phenotypic and agronomic traits as well as molecular marker data to estimate genetic diversity in the collection. The regeneration of 1680 sorghum accessions with low seed viability or number was conducted at GIRU, US Virgin Islands. A total of 230 cultivated sorghum accessions and 10 wild species were transplanted to the field in Isabela for seed regeneration. Also, 50 cowpea, 20 maize, 15 winged bean, 5 cucurbits and 15 Leucaena accessions were regenerated. A total of 1785 distributions of more than 40 plant species of tropical germplasm were distributed to researchers and cooperators at the local, national and international level.<br /> <br /> South Carolina: A total of 612 germplasm accessions of watermelon, pepper, sweetpotato, cowpea, zoysia, and eggplant were distributed from PGRCU in Griffin, GA to scientists and individuals in South Carolina in 2004. Seed of soybean (Glycine max) germplasm line, LG00-3372, was obtained the Soybean Germplasm Collection, USDA-ARS, Urbana, IL, and crossed with two elite South Carolina glyphosate-tolerant experimental lines to combine diverse genes for seed yield with genes in the adapted lines which provide nematode resistance and agronomic characteristics suitable for the southeastern U.S.A. F2 plants from both crosses are currently being grown at Clemson, South Carolina. PI 594651-L2, with a high level of resistance to peanut root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne arenaria) was crossed with an adapted South Carolina cultivar, Dillon, to combine an improved level of M. arenaria resistance with high seed yield and acceptable agronomic traits.<br /> <br /> Tennessee: The following projects are being conducted at the University of Tennessee in which novel or exotic germplasm lines are being utilized in research projects. Recombinant inbred lines (RIL) are being developed from a cross between a prolific rooting line, PI 416937, and a high leaflet orienting cultivar, USG 5601T, to determine the effects of combinations of fibrous root and leaflet orientation on water-use efficiency in soybeans. Four new cross hybridizations have being initiated by the TN program to expand diversity in elite soybean germplasm for applied variety development. Several populations are being grown by soybean breeders throughout the U.S. to select adapted lines for local conditions as potential new cultivars, or use the lines as parents in crosses to introgress new germplasm into breeding programs. Early generation lines from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project, coordinated through the USDA Maize project at Iowa State University, are crossed with elite adapted lines and evaluated for field performance. The best lines from these hybrid trials are entered in breeding programs, using traditional breeding methods, to develop new maize parental lines. Three accessions of teosinte were obtained from NCRPIS at Ames, Iowa in 2004 and crossed with adapted corn. F1 hybrids will be backcrossed to adapted corn lines during the 2005 growing season.<br /> <br /> Virgin Islands: There are two native orchid species remaining in St. Croix; Epidendrum ciliare and Psychilis macconnelliae, both of which are on the VI endangered species list. Current research includes media comparison studies to determine the most appropriate method for micropropagation of the plants by seed and developing acclimatization protocols for species which are more difficult to harden off than conventional hybrids. Preliminary results indicate that the Epidendrum ciliare germinates best on a modified Knudson-type media whereas the Pyschilis macconnellia prefers a modified Orchid replate/maintenance media. Greater production of in vitro grown native orchids, through the use of specific media for the species, has reduced the cost to local growers. Papaya strains obtained from Venezuela, Columbia and Bangladesh are being evaluated with eight selected lines grown in the US Virgin Islands. The new papaya lines are being assessed for disease tolerance, production potential and fruit quality under the semi-arid tropical conditions found in the US Virgin Islands. <br /> <br /> <br /> Virginia: Several accessions from the USDA plant germplasm collection were used for studies of systematics and genetic diversity. Legume cover crops are under investigation for their potential in meeting nitrogen needs of various summer crops. Peanut accessions acquired from the Plant Germplasm Conservation Unit in Griffin Georgia were used in development of newly released cultivars and germplasm. These activities document the distribution and utilization of plant genetic resources, a primary objective of the regional project, the study of genetic relationships among crop plants and their wild relatives, and the release of new cultivars of crop plants, the cornerstone of agriculture.<br />\n\nPublications\n\nUSDA Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit<br /> Morris, J.B., K.
