        "text": "In 1742, a highland Andean named Juan Santos led a group of mainly Asháninka and Yanesha warriors against a handful of isolated Franciscan missions in the central high jungle of Peru. Over the next ten years the rebellion smoldered, occasionally sparking to life, as Santos's forces pushed the missionaries based out of the College of Santa Rosa de Ocopa (near Jauja, Peru) back to the highlands. The uprising culminated in a brief foray into the highlands, but never effectively reached beyond the security of the densely vegetated high jungle, known locally as the central montaña region. Despite its modest accomplishments, the rebellion secured autonomy for the combatant nations during the rest of the colonial period.\n\n3. There has been much debate about when exactly the Bourbon reforms started in Spanish America. John Fisher uses 1750 as the starting point in his masterful work, Bourbon Peru (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2003). He argues that inconsistencies of early reform made any real impact on Peru impossible during the first half of the eighteenth century. Elliott, John, in Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America, 1492-1830 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006)Google Scholar, contends that the Americas were largely unaffected by the Bourbon Reforms until after the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763). He posits that, despite the creation of the new viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717 and its permanent establishment in 1739, commitments in Europe made it impossible to impose reform in the American possessions. More recent scholarship has considered the extent to which the Bourbon state began to enact reform in the Americas prior to the Seven Years’ War. In Shaky Colonialism: The 1746 Earthquake-Tsunami in Lima, Peru, and Its Long Aftermath (Durham: Duke University Press, 2008), Charles Walker argues that, for Bourbon reformist ministers, the 1746 Lima earthquake exposed the baroque backwardness of the city. This realization inspired Bourbon officials in both Spain and Peru to enact a series of reforms aimed at creating a more modern, enlightened city. The most promising work on the early Bourbon reforms to date is probably Adrian Pearce's 1998 doctoral dissertation, “Early Bourbon Government in the Viceroyalty of Peru, 1700–1759” (University of Liverpool). Pearce argues that the early Bourbon period is the foundation of the later reforms in the Americas, noting that the major administrative structures necessary for later reform were created during the early Bourbon period (for example, the Secretariat of the Indies) and that the crown during that period attempted financial, mining, military, and ecclesiastical reforms with the colonies themselves. While, like Walker, Pearce believes that early Bourbon reforms were intermittent, he argues that they “followed a consistent, enlightened agenda.” Citing Pearce and others, Allen Kuethe and Kenneth Andrien begin their most recent work on the Bourbon reforms in 1713: Kuethe and Andrien, The Spanish Atlantic World in the Eighteenth Century: War and the Bourbon Reforms, 1713-1796 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014)Google Scholar. See also Godoy, Scarlett O'Phelan, ed., El Perú en el siglo XVIII. La Era Borbónica, (Lima: Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Instituto Riva-Agüero, 1999)Google Scholar.\n\n8. Most of the previous scholarship on the rebellion has focused on its revolutionary nature within a regional Peruvian context. Excellent anthropological studies such as Varese, Stefano, Salt of the Mountain: Campa Asháninka History and Resistance in the Peruvian Jungle (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2002)Google Scholar, originally published in Spanish as La sal de los cerros: resistencia y utopía en la Amazonía peruana (Lima: Universidad Peruana de Ciencias y Tecnología),1966), and Santos-Granero and Barclay, Selva Central, examine the possible causes of the rebellion in regional context from the perspective of the Ashánika and Yanesha, but look very little at factors outside of the central montaña. Nationalist historians in the mid twentieth century, such as Loayza, José, Juan Santos, el Invencible (Lima: Editorial D. Miranda, 1942)Google Scholar, and Arenas, Mario Castro, La rebelión de Juan Santos (Lima: C. Milla Batres, 1973)Google Scholar, attempted to tie the rebellion to the mainly creole-led independence movements of the 1820’s. More recently, Stern, Steve, “The Age of Andean Insurrection, 1742–1782: A Reappraisal,” in Stern, Steve, ed., Resistance, Rebellion, and Consciousness in the Andean Peasant World, 18th to 20th Centuries (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987)Google Scholar, argued that the rebellion was the first manifestation of a larger consciousness of resistance throughout the Andes that culminated in the Great Andean Revolts of the 1780’s. While historical records do not seem to support the type of direct relationship between the rebellions that Stern suggests, all of the rebellions were caused in some part by the significant shift in the way that historical actors distant from the metropole interacted with the state. For more on Andean revolts in the eighteenth century, see Godoy, Scarlett O'Phelan, Rebellions and Revolts in Eighteenth-Century Peru and Upper Peru (Köln: Böhlau, 1985)Google Scholar."
