        "meta_description": "An online exhibition of copies of Mesoamerican facsimiles, 16th through 18th century first editions of European/Nahuatl books, and 20th century artists’ books inspired by a far-from-forgotten culture. Nahuatl was the language of the Aztec and is spoken by approximately 1.5 million people today. The Latin American Studies Program at the University of Utah began teaching Nahuatl in fall 2012. The University of Utah is the only academic institution teaching Nahuatl on a regular basis. The Rare Books Division holds one of the largest collections of Mesoamerican codex facsimiles in the United Sates, thanks to Prof. Charles Elliott Dibble (1909-2002), one of the world’s leading experts on Mesoamerica. Dr. Dibble taught at the University of Utah in the department of Anthropology for four decades. He donated his extensive book collection to the J. Willard Marriott Library. The Rare Books Division continues to build on this legacy.",
