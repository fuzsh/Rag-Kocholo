        "text": "Chapter II\n\nSancho Dávila:\n\nthe champion of Catholic Spain\n\nA Spanish hero\n\nWithin Spain, Sancho Dávila (sometimes written as D’Avila) is undoubtedly the most famous military commander of the first phase of the Revolt, and perhaps even of the whole early modern history of the Spanish army. His fame started with the very positive judgement offered by the Duke of Alba and his secretary, Juan de Albornoz, in his own time: “without downplaying anybody, he is the best soldier His Majesty has in his service”.1 A first biography of Sancho was published as early as 1713, written by his direct descendant, Gerónimo Manuel Dávila y San Vitores. The title of his book, El rayo de la guerra (the Lighting Bolt of the War), acknowledges his fame as an extraordinary military hero. In 1857 another of the commander’s descendants, Manuel Pando Fernández de Pineda, Marquis of Miraflores, and “holder of the house and goods of that famous military leader”, deemed it necessary to write another biography, and this nobleman was also involved in the publication of sources about Sancho in the influential national series Colección de Documentos Inéditos para la Historia de España. In 2010, finally, a new and annotated biography of the commander was published, this time by a specialist in the history of Ávila, Gonzalo Martín García. In between, historian Enrique Martínez Ruiz published several articles on this commander between 1968 and 1976, while in 2007 he also produced a historical novel with Sancho as its protagonist, to which we shall turn at the end of the chapter.\n\nIn contrast to this overwhelming attention to Sancho Dávila in Spain, he remains a mere footnote in the history books of the Low Countries and, if mentioned at all, usually solely in relation to the famous Battle of Mookerheyde in 1574 and the infamous Spanish Fury of Antwerp in 1576.3 There are no specific articles or books published in the Netherlands or Belgium that use Sancho Dávila as their main protagonist. The only Dutch or Belgian biographical dictionary paying attention to him is that of 1852 by Van der Aa, who erroneously has him die during the siege of Maastricht in 1579.\n\nIn this chapter we will try to understand these two diverging historiographical traditions and to connect them as much as possible, looking for a middle ground that gets us as close to Sancho Dávila as possible. We are aided in this task by the availability of a wide array of publications on his life and deeds, and a large body of preserved letters from him, which makes possible a chapter that is built less on chronicles and more on historiography and correspondence than the previous chapter on Julián Romero.\n\nA hero in the family\n\nNobleman and politician Gerónimo Manuel Dávila y San Vitores stated on the title page of his 1713 biography of the commander that he was Sancho’s great-great-grandson, dedicating his book to King Philip V, a direct descendant of King Philip II through the female line, but above all the first Spanish King from the Bourbon dynasty. In the short preface to the book he explains that he was a servant of the last Habsburg King, Charles II, but now he was poor: “I do not have anything to eat, or anything to do good with”. Using Sancho as the perfect example of a good royal servant he hoped to obtain royal favour from the new Bourbon King, “that Your Majesty makes amends and supports me”.6 Though the subject of the book is war, the author makes clear he hates “our wars, that have put us into so much danger”, referring to the violent Wars of Spanish Succession between the followers of the Habsburg and Bourbon pretenders (1700-1714). From the licences and privileges we learn that the book was already under official scrutiny from August 1710, but it was three years before the official royal corrector gave his final approval to the edition. By that time the war was coming to a close. In 1710 the outcome of the succession wars was not yet clear, giving Sancho’s biography a role in the complicated political landscape during these chaotic years. Was Gerónimo perhaps changing loyalty at the time and did he need the help of his famous ancestor in order to succeed, or was he merely a poor nobleman trying to survive in dangerous times?\n\nThe author also frames his work as destined specifically for Catholic readers, introducing the famous locally born Saint Teresa of Ávila, “my defending counsel and relative” and a declared enemy of heretics. In this way the author connects the wars in which Sancho participated with fighting heresy in general. An engraving of Teresa can be found at the end of the book, balancing the engraving of Sancho at the beginning. In 1713 it was not yet public knowledge that the female patron saint of Spain came from a converso family, and the author would probably have omitted this family relationship had he known.7 Together, Teresa and Sancho symbolise the struggle against heretics, the saint armed with her books and Sancho with his sword.\n\nAccording to Gerónimo, Sancho’s father, Antón Vázquez, had gone to Worms in 1521 to meet Charles V on behalf of the rebellious Castilian Comuneros. In his book Gerónimo tries to defend the Comuneros as people looking for the “good government of these realms”, but he has to admit that the Emperor had him briefly incarcerated.9 Sancho was born on 21 September 1523 out of Antón’s marriage with Ana Daza.\n\nHis son, Fernando Dávila, would become a page to Philip II, marrying twice in Ávila, first to Teresa de Toledo, with whom he had a young son, Sancho, who died at an early age, and a daughter, Catalina, who entered a convent; and secondly to Luisa de Guevara, with whom he had many children, among them his successor, also named Sancho. This Sancho became a knight of the Order of Alcántara and a governor of the province of Zacatecas in New Spain. In Ávila he married his cousin, Francisca del Peso y Guevara. Their son, again called Sancho, and also a knight of Alcántara, served both Philip IV and Charles II, and married three times. His first marriage was to Francisca de San Vitores from Burgos, who was related through her mother to the famous Maluenda merchant family. Besides the author of the 1713 biography they also had another son called Sancho Joseph, who became a Jesuit, and a son, Antonio, who died a captain during the war of Messina. Gerónimo ends his biography with a long genealogy of all the branches of his family, turning the biography of his most famous ancestor into a family memorial. His uncle on his mother’s side, Diego Luis de San Vitores, the last family member he mentions in his book, was an important but controversial Jesuit missionary in Guam, who died there in 1672.11\n\nUsing Sancho’s service memorial (‘memorial de sus servicios’), Gerónimo stated that Sancho had been one of the ten Spanish soldiers who crossed the river Elbe in 1547 by swimming with their swords in their mouths, leading up to the famous Battle of Mühlberg.12 We will later see that an identical story is told about Cristóbal de Mondragón. The same source puts him in the city of Africa (Mahdia) in 1550 and with the fleet that accompanied Prince Philip to England to marry Queen Mary Tudor. Subsequently, Sancho, by then an infantry captain, served the Duke of Alba during the wars in Italy. We find in this book the complete transcription of the official appointment, dated 15 July 1561. Here the story does not follow a strict chronological line, as the author continues with the disastrous attack on Djerba in 1560, during which Sancho, together with his commander Álvaro de Sande, was supposedly taken prisoner by the Ottomans.\n\nAfter inspecting the fortresses in Valencia, he was appointed governor of the important Italian castle of Pavia, as evidenced by a document of 24 December 1562.16 Using the work of Gil González,\n\nHe gave death to a giant in Moncalvo in single combat, though with unequal arms, as the giant fought with an enormous two-handed sword, and Sancho Dávila with his usual sword and his shield, of which Sancho Dávila came out victorious, like David to Goliath.18\n\nThough clearly Sancho’s first biographer, Gerónimo was not the first family member to take Sancho’s history to the printing press. Somewhere between 1629 and 1637, Sancho’s grandson, Sancho Dávila y Guevara, prepared a printed version of the Memorial de los servicios del General Sancho Davila.19 He considered that both his grandfather and his father had not been sufficiently rewarded for their services to the crown, and now asked for “the government of New-Biscay, or the government (corregimiento) of Zacatecas, any other government, or a similar function comparable to such important services”. Grandfather Sancho was highly praised as “an oracle” in matters of war and a defender of the faith. In order to achieve its goals, the document offers a series of quotations from letters by Philip II and official dignitaries from between 1568 and 1575, as well as a short paragraph on his earlier deeds, here quoted in full:\n\nHe served in the expedition to Germany, found himself in Africa and in the war in Lombardy. He accompanied Philip II during his journey to England, who gave him the title of captain and he served with him in the wars of Piedmont, Naples and the taking of Africa.20\n\nThis published memorial may have been the document Gerónimo used in his book, but there is as yet no mention of the Battle of Mühlberg. The memorial shows that the 1713 biography followed up on an earlier printed document, already asking for advancement for the author based on his ancestor’s deeds, and making use of official letters to prove his valour. In 1637 Sancho was indeed appointed the new governor of the rich mining city and region of Zacatecas (Mexico). Being the descendant of a hero was a valuable part of one’s inheritance.\n\nIn 1857 Manuel Pando Fernández de Pineda, Marquis of Miraflores (1792-1872) and also a descendant of Sancho, decided to follow the lead with a new biography. This high nobleman was an important royalist and conservative politician, ambassador to Paris, London and Rome, cabinet minister in various governments, and twice even briefly Prime Minister of Spain.21 In 1850 he had become a member of the Real Academia de la Historia. In his introduction the author highlights an interesting combination of three important developments from the sixteenth century: religious reform, the Jesuits and communism. Before the sixteenth century there was “a clear supremacy in the hands of kings”, but then a new society, defined by the “disturbing flag of free choice”, had come into being.\n\nThe Enlightenment and the French Revolution are both explained by the author through this growing influence of communism. The Paris revolution of 1848 figures, of course, as the worst moment in history: “really mournful was the spectacle that France presented in 1848”.25 The anti-revolutionary aristocrat wished to demonstrate the sterility of revolutions in history, turning the directly following biography on Sancho Dávila and his activities during the Revolt in the Low Countries into an exemplary story of the continuing struggle against communism by a defender of the old order. However, it is important to remark that the Marquis had in his youth fought against the domination of the French imperial forces in Spain and had been both a refugee in and an ambassador to Paris. It takes the Marquis almost a hundred pages to start the actual biography of his ancestor. On the period up to Sancho’s departure to the Low Countries no new information is offered compared to Gerónimo’s in 1713, and he attempts to hide Sancho’s father’s Comunero past, instead highlighting that Sancho’s father had served the king against the French at Fuenterrabía in 1521.\n\nThe 2010 biography, on the other hand, calls Sancho the son of a Comunero immediately on the first page of the presentation by the provincial president of Ávila, and their revolt makes up one of the nine chapters of the book.27 In twenty-first-century Castile, Comuneros are regarded more as patriots avant la lettre than as rebels.\n\nAn international soldier (1554-1567)\n\nSancho’s first moment of fame – if we leave out the duel with the giant – is the crossing of the river Elbe as one of ten Spanish arquebusiers who swam the span. His 1713 biographer Gerónimo was sure his forefather had been one of them, and the 2010 biographer follows this lead: “It is possible. We do not have data or motives to doubt the truthfulness of the information”.30 However, the most recent biographer is mistaken. The fact that the same story has also been fabricated around Cristóbal de Mondragón makes it already less probable, but neither man is mentioned in a chronicle written by a witness to the events who lists all the eleven (!) Spaniards who actually performed the hazardous crossing.\n\nIn the case of Sancho Dávila this means that we do not have any reliable evidence of his presence during the wars in Germany, and considering the fact that the first Italian period is also solely based on one quotation from Gerónimo in 1713, we are left completely without reliable evidence about his military life for this early period. What to do with the 2010 affirmation that Sancho in Germany “participated in many skirmishes, ambushes and suprise actions ordered by the Duke [of Alba?]”?32 Apart from Gerónimo’s biography we have only a short description by Antonio de Cianca, and this might well have been a main source for the biographer:\n\nOne of the valiant and prudent soldiers that the Spanish nation has had, as is well proven by his deeds and exploits, from the war Emperor Charles V, our lord of good memory, fought against the rebel princes and their allies in Germany, where he became a soldier, and afterwards in the conquest and the destruction of the city of Africa, and from there to the wars in Lombardy, Piedmont and the Roman countryside, where he became a captain of Spanish infantry.33\n\nThe next military stop in the 1713 biography was the expedition to the city of Africa (Mahdia). And, again, the 2010 biography does not offer any additional documentation. Of course, Gerónimo was his descendant and he quotes a memorial of his services, but the fact that the Mühlberg story does not hold good makes us wonder about all the other information on Sancho’s early career. This reservation also extends to his participation in Philip II’s journey to England in 1554.34 This last unproven fact coincides with the theatre play on Romero in which – and once more unproven – he was said to have participated in the English journey. It seems that Philip II’s English expedition was another good story to use both in memorials and plays.\n\nThe first documentary proof Martín García provides dates from 1559, when the Duke of Alba recommended Sancho Dávila to Philip II:\n\n[…] Captain Sancho Dávila, carrier of this letter, has served Your Majesty for many years in all the journeys that have presented themselves, and, as from five years, with an infantry company, proving himself as a good soldier on the occasions that have arisen […].35\n\nThe letter proves that he was an infantry captain from around 1554, at that time under Maestre de campo Sancho de Londoño of the tercio of Lombardy, and that he had been fighting in many other expeditions before that date. As Philip II lived at the time in the Low Countries, Sancho must have travelled there in 1559. But the document does not place him directly at famous historical events like those in Mühlberg, Africa and England. And we must also question his presence in Djerba, as even here his last biographer is quite negative:\n\nHowever, it is not clear that Sancho Dávila was at Djerba [los Djelves] nor that he was one of the captured men. This is only affirmed by Gerónimo Dávila, who is always inclined to sing the praises of his ancestor, and by father Juan de Mariana in his Historia General de España. And we do not have any other source of information that can prove this.36\n\nAfter Alba’s letter from 1559, the next piece of documentary evidence can be found in a royal letter from June 1561, with Philip II already back in Spain.37 The letter proves that Dávila had been serving with his company in Naples during the government of the Duke of Alba in Italy. There is nothing to be found on Djerba. In June 1561 Sancho was probably in Spain, as Martín García has found him present at a procession in April of that year in his home town. He may have used his stay to secure payment of his wages at court. According to seventeenth-century local historian\n\nGonzález Dávila, he had returned to Spain, having “decided to lay down his arms”, but at court the Duke of Alba convinced him “to return to [military] service”.\n\nIn this new office Sancho’s first task was the control of the fortresses on the Valencian coast and the construction of a new fortress in Bernia, a task comparable to Julián Romero working on Ibiza during those same years. We know of these activities from letters written by Sancho to the Duke of Alba in 1562.40 For the first time we hear from Sancho directly, making it possible to offer a better picture of his career from this moment onwards. For the period up to 1562, the first almost forty years of his life, we have nothing but second-hand stories and a few scattered pieces of documentary evidence that have been preserved. The history of this early period was fabricated mainly after he had become an important military commander. Connecting him to important events in history including royal visits and crucial heroic battles may have been part of the myth-making process of a military hero. In part the same process took place around Julián Romero. However, in both cases it seems probable that they had acquired experience both in Italy and the northern territories of the Habsburgs.\n\nAfter asking the Duke of Alba for a new posting in a letter from June 1562, he was nominated as the new governor of the fortress of Pavia, a wonderful promotion, most surely the result of the Duke’s protection. On 17 February 1563 Sancho was back in Madrid where he swore an oath as an infantry captain, before travelling to Italy to occupy his post.41 In 1566 his cousin, Rodrigo Orejón, became his lieutenant in the fortress, and he stayed there quietly for a few years between 1563 and 1567. Martín García found only one letter that showed some tension when the city guards and the soldiers from the castle had been fighting, using arquebuses and pistols. In October 1566 he informed the Duke of Alba that he was bored and begged for action:\n\nWhen Your Excellency favoured me by giving me the government of this castle of Pavia, I did not think this was to stay behind, but I saw it as an intermediate period until an opportunity or journey presented itself in which I could be employed similar to my services, as these have always been, thank God, with so much caution as suits a soldier worthy to be called a servant [criado] of Your Excellency.42\n\nSancho wanted to join the Duke of Alba on the expedition he was preparing:\n\nThis has made me dare to ask Your Excellency, understanding that there will be a journey on which Your Grace will go, to employ me in his service and go with him, as the whole world understands that I am a servant [criado] of Your Excellency and it would give me great shame if I were to remain stuck over here.43\n\nWe hear the voice of a commander who wants to be part of the action. Until then his career had been succesful but not extraordinary, he having become an infantry captain around the age of thirty and having got his tenure as governor of an important fortress in Italy when he was not even forty. But still, until then there had not been much evidence to suggest that he would become a famous early modern military commander, least of all a national hero. Brantôme wrote that people were surprised that the Duke took Dávila with him as he was not yet considered an important captain.44 When looking back at his departure in 1567 for the Low Countries, he was described by the famous poet, Pedro de Padilla, in 1583 as “a highly esteemed man, fortunate and valiant”.\n\nBattling against the rebels (1568)\n\nThe Duke of Alba asked Sancho to raise a company of light cavalry that could serve as his personal guard, and it was in this capacity that he left Italy for the Low Countries in 1567, with one hundred lancers and fifty men armed with arquebuses. We can presume Sancho stayed close to Alba during these first years, in part because we do not have any correspondence between Sancho and the Duke until 1569. His company was at first lodged in a village five miles outside Brussels, as in general cavalry regiments remained in the countryside for reasons of provision and accommodation. 47\n\nThe first episode Sancho played a part in concerns the imprisonment of the Count of Egmont on 9 September 1567, very shortly after the arrival of Alba and his troops in Brussels. It is one of the most dramatic moments in the early history of the Revolt. Egmont was invited to Alba’s residence to discuss the defence works of Thionville and Luxembourg with other noblemen, but then at the end of the meeting Sancho Dávila told Egmont very politely to hand him his sword and he was then taken prisoner. However, in Hogenberg’s engraving of the event it seems that Alba approached Egmont himself.48 Chronicler Mendoza tells that Alba:\n\nhad ordered that the Count of Egmont and the Count of Horne were to leave through two different doors; at one door there was Sancho Dávila, captain of the Duke’s guards, with orders to apprehend the Count of Egmont, and at the other door captain Jerónimo de Salinas, governor and castellano of Puerto Herculis, to apprehend the Count of Horne.49\n\nHooft, of course, made the most of this dramatic moment:\n\nAnd then, with the closure of the meeting, Egmont, leaving the room, was told that the Prior [Fernando de Toledo] was waiting for him to continue the game. Then he turned around through a certain room, where he was met by Sancho Dávila, who, as captain of the ducal guard, and by order of the King, took away his weapon, taking him prisoner. The count, not understanding what was happening to him, wanted everything that was said repeated. Then, finding it hard to separate himself from his sword, he stated that it had so often loyally served the King. However, he had to hand it in and remain there, complaining about the force and violence used, and referring to the freedom of the Order [Golden Fleece] and the laws of the country, stating that he did not need to remain. However, the Spaniard’s ears remained deaf to his complaints.50\n\nIn a letter written from Brussels and sent on 11 September we find another description of the event that had taken place only two days earlier:\n\nWhen they were all standing, they said to Egmont that the Prior [Fernando de Toledo] had asked if he wanted to play piquet, and going towards the room of the Prior, Sancho Dávila, the captain of the guards of Your Excellency, approached him, telling him that he was arrested by His Majesty and that he had to enter the room. On entering, he told him to hand over his sword, which he did much against his will, saying that with it he had always served Your Majesty, defending these lands.51\n\nThe story we find in Hooft’s history reflects the same dialogue as the Spanish letter written only two days after the event. An interesting new detail is the name of the game they were presumably going to play, ‘los cientos’, also called piquet, a fashionable card game of probably Spanish origin that had reached England in 1554 with the wedding of Philip II and Mary Tudor, and that can already be found in Rabelais’ work.52\n\nSancho would in 1568 be involved in various battles and skirmishes, including three major battles: the Battle of Dahlem, the Battle of Jemmingen and the Battle of the river Gete. He would also be hurt in one of the lesser battles taking place between the armies of William of Orange and the Duke of Alba.\n\nWe find Sancho with his guards at Maastricht on 23 April 1568, and in the following days he was involved in the fighting near Roermond under Maestre de campo Sancho de Londoño. In Londoño’s description of the events, Dávila clearly stood out, together with some others like Francisco de Valdés. Near Dahlem he attacked the enemy, “and though the country was filled with fences, ditches and woodland, Sancho’s attack made their cavalry abandon the battle and start running”. Alba sent Londoño’s letter with one of his own to Philip II, and the King congratulated Sancho on his brave behaviour, writing, “I will keep this in mind for when the occasion comes to reward you”. This important letter containing a royal promise was preserved in the family archive.53 In another letter, to paymaster Castellanos in Antwerp, written in June 1568 while the promised royal reward had not yet arrived, Sancho spoke of “the success that God has given to me in Dahlem against those heretics and rebels”, further emphasising the fact that he had not received royal rewards for the last twenty-five years.\n\nHe would also be present at the Battle of Jemmingen on 21 July of that same year, together with other Spanish army commanders like Julián Romero. And again he could be found among those who had done particularly well “up front only he [Lope de Figueroa] and Sancho Dávila, who were in the vanguard of all the army”.56 As in Dahlem, the enemy ran away and many were killed. And, again, a victory was a good moment for Sancho to ask for rewards. Again he spoke of a large victory given to them by God. About his own activities at Jemmingen he was rather modest: “I only shall say that I did in this day like in all others where I have participated, as much as possible”. However, and probably supported by the victory at Dahlem, he was less modest about deserving a good reward: “a reward worthy of my services, that if I was not confident that I really deserved it, I would not dare to put it in this way”.\n\nBernardino de Mendoza’s chronicle also shows Sancho as the most active commander at Dahlem and describes how he had the honour of taking the most important prisoners to Brussels. Just before the Battle of Jemmingen, Sancho caught up with some enemies, “taking one with his own hands”. However, his further role during the battle was minimal. During the Battle of the river Gete on 20 October he is mentioned as leading four hundred cavalry, but nothing more is said of him. It is surprising that this last battle is little known in the historical literature of the Low Countries, though Mendoza claims that some three thousand enemies were killed, counted by the villagers that had buried them.58 Chronicler Antonio Trillo also highlights Sancho’s cavalry attack at Dahlem, but leaves him out of the stories of Jemmingen and the river Gete.\n\nAnother Spanish chronicler, Pedro Cornejo, turned Sancho into the great hero of Dahlem, and even as one of the main heroes of his book:\n\nThis was the first time Sancho’s valour was made known in these states, for his qualities as a commander and for his spirit, courage and his fortune in fighting and defeating the enemy, elements that in our days very seldom are found together in one man, but all came together in this knight, as you shall see in the continuation of this history.60\n\nDutch Protestant historian Emanuel van Meteren mentions Sancho as leading commander at Dahlem, but clearly does not see him as a hero; “continuing his victory he did a lot of evil in the land of Julich and its vicinity”. Van Meteren tells that just before the Battle of Jemmingen Sancho went on a reconnaissance mission with thirty horsemen and later on he engaged in combat with Louis of Nassau and his army, commanding 1,400 horsemen.61 Historian P.C. Hooft also mentions Sancho at Dahlem as one of two outstanding commanders and states how they captured the Lords of both Villers and Huy,\n\nThere is a clear difference in his importance and role during these three main battles, depending on the sources. The Spanish letters and accounts from 1568 place him in a prominent light, while some of the Spanish chroniclers pay less attention to him, as a secondary figure, and the Dutch even less. However, the hero of Dahlem is one of the favourite soldiers of chronicler Pedro Cornejo, publishing between the events themselves and the chronicles of Mendoza and Trillo. It proves that his fame as a good commander of horsemen on the field of battle was constructed during this year. In an account of all the Spaniards who had served well during this first campaign he was, strangely enough, mentioned for his participation at Jemmingen, and not for the victory\n\nat Dahlem.64\n\nFollowing Orange’s army in the direction of France, Sancho stayed with the Duke of Alba’s army. Near Binche the troops engaged by the end of 1568 with some of the enemy infantry, “whom they slaughtered close to a village, although not without danger for captain Sancho Dávila, who was hurt in his thigh by a halberd”.65 According to the Marquis of Miraflores, after having “his thigh pierced by a halberd and his face splashed with his own blood” he shouted to his soldiers, “this blood that stains my face is blood that bleeds from my own face because of the shame of seeing you flee”. In the 1713 biography we already find the same story with beside it in the margin “noticias de su padre”, indicating that this was perhaps a family story that was passed down from generation to generation.\n\nWhile chronicler Bernardino de Mendoza does not make much of the encounter in which Sancho received his wound, there is a different version of this story that has turned the event into a real battle. The ‘Battle of Le Quesnoy (1568)’ has its own page on Wikipedia in which Sancho stars among the wounded. During this victory of the Prince of Orange on 12 November, “the Spanish commander Sancho D’Avila, along with his officers Francois de Tolede and Ruy de Lopez, was wounded, and the son of the Duke of Alva Don Rufille Henriques died in the action”.67 In Mendoza’s chronicle there were two confrontations: Sancho received his injury during an earlier confrontation, followed by the fighting in which Ruy López de Ávalos, captain of light cavalry, died, and Francisco de Toledo, a brother to the Count of Orgaz, was wounded.\n\nPerhaps the connection between Sancho’s injury and this encounter on 12 November originates with the Italian seventeenth-century historian Famiano Strada, who combined two events that had in reality occurred a day apart:\n\nThey arrived around Quesnoy, and as Alba was following him from a close distance, it occurred that in a more than normal skirmish, he dispersed some Spanish and High German banners, and Sancho Dávila, with César Dávalos, who in vain tried to keep their men together, were seriously hurt, serving at least partially as revenge for his [Orange’s] earlier defeat.71\n\nIn particular, the detail of their attempt to keep the troops together coincides with Sancho shouting to his troops in his biography. But who invented the story that the Duke of Alba’s son had died in the fighting, a fictitious story that was already circulating in 1680 and was subsequently forgotten, but that has fairly recently made its reappearance on Wikipedia? It shows how episodic narratives can resurface in totally unexpected\n\nplaces.\n\nThe castellano of Antwerp (1568-1572)\n\nAlba was well aware of Sancho’s skills as governor of the citadel of Pavia as well as of his abilities as a good commander in the field, and therefore promoted him around May 1568 to captain of Antwerp and governor (castellano) of its citadel which was under construction, as can be understood from a letter from Morillon, Granvelle’s confidant in the Low Countries. At this time, Morillon still saw this nomination as “la préservation de la ville”, putting his faith in the Spanish commander as he had also done with Romero, and probably reflecting the general opinion of Catholic Netherlanders at the time.72 However, a modern American historian described Sancho at this same point in his book anachronistically as “of all his race the most hated in Antwerp”.\n\nBeginning on 1 January 1569, there has been preserved a whole series of letters from Antwerp from Sancho to the Duke and to Albornoz, the Duke‘s secretary. In a letter to the Duke he thanked him again for his new position, “whether it is a good or a bad life to be governor of the citadel, I put myself completely in the hands of Your Excellency”.74 One Spanish soldier poet even dedicated to the new castellano a sonnet which was published in Antwerp in 1569 together with sonnets praising other military commanders: “fame moves in a swift and fast flight, lifting your name up to heaven”.\n\nThe Duke of Alba had visited Antwerp for the first time by the end of October 1567, with, according to local chronicler Godevaert van Haecht, three hundred Spanish horsemen. Sancho must have been among them. The burghers complained about the new taxes that were needed for the construction of the citadel, although Alba tried to defend his decision by stating that once it was finished the soldiers could live in the citadel and would no longer be quartered in the inhabitants’ houses.76 In September 1568 six hundred Spanish soldiers came to stay in the citadel. Van Haecht describes how in October four out of nine banners left again, but soon afterwards another six hundred new Spaniards arrived; “these were lodged in the city, though there was enough room in the castle. And all arrived naked, and were dressed here as noblemen (jonkers)”. By the end of October most of these Spaniards did move to the citadel, as their beds and mattresses had arrived. Some of the officers took with them much household equipment from the houses they had stayed in and when the burghers complained, they just said “it is all ours” (“‘t hoort al ons”). By early December another 250 Spaniards had arrived in the city, “skinny and naked wretches” (“hamels”). The cold winter meant that some Spaniards froze to death “as they are not accostumed to such cold”.\n\nVan Haecht never mentions Sancho’s appointment or any other news about the new governor in his chronicle. Painter Godevaert van Haecht was born in Antwerp in 1546, and except for a long stay in Paris between April 1570 and September 1571 he seems to have remained in the city. It makes him an excellent eyewitness to most of the events up to 1574, especially since his work resembles loose notes penned directly after the events themselves.78 For a young man of some twenty-three years the appointment of the new castellano, however, was not worth mentioning. The Duke of Alba absorbed all his attention, as in May 1569 the citadel prepared for a visit by the Duke, “and the castle walls all around were filled with cannons, as he would come to inspect it, and there existed differences between the masters of the castle as how to finish it”. The Duke arrived on 27 May “and in the castle cannons were fired and also the Spaniards fired besides their weapons some rockets; on the 28th day he drove around the castle, and during this triumphal ride he was almost hit with a wooden cannonball”.\n\nMeanwhile, Sancho used his experience with the citadel of Milan, where he had resided for some time, to evaluate what was needed in Antwerp. So it was not only the Italian architects who brought with them their experience of the Italian citadels, as Sancho also understood what was necessary for a citadel to function properly. A detailed comparison found among his letters to Albornoz explains that he needed a doctor and a surgeon, but also an auditor, “very necessary, and there is no castle that does not have one”.80 He was an experienced Spanish commander well versed in the art of war as it was practised in Renaissance Italy.\n\nOne can even study the contruction works on the citadel using these letters, as when in April 1569 it is stated that “the bullwarks are already high, and we have to put the arms of Your Majesty and the Duke, my lord, on them”.81 However, the final touch would come much later. In a letter of 18 March 1571 to Prior Fernando de Toledo, Alba’s natural son, whom Sancho clearly considered as a close patron and protector, he described “the statue that has to be put here in this citadel of the Duke my lord; it is said that it is the best thing in the world and with God’s help, by Easter we can install it here”.\n\nUntil this moment in his story, the local chronicler had not yet mentioned Sancho, who had been in Antwerp at least from February 1569. It will finally be in August that he writes:\n\nAlso in this time, the governor of the Antwerp castle named Sanxo Daver was a bridegroom, as he married the daughter of a Spaniard in Bruges, and as one heard, the father was a banker. There was a very pompous celebration, even though he had been just a drummer. It was heard that the Duke of Alba had given him a present of 2,000 crowns; and around the 15th day he called for a tournament in Antwerp, as he wanted to return home to the castle by that time, and for this reason, by the first of the month the preparations started to prepare the lodgings for the Spanish lords that would come to the tournament.84\n\nAgain we find in this description the idea that the Spanish commanders were of low birth, it calling Sancho somebody who had started off as a ‘drummer’, a description that was also used for Sancho in a Beggar’s song and for Julián in a play by Lope de Vega. This second mention of Sancho as a drummer may indicate that this image of Sancho had spread through the Low Countries. The preparations for the wedding can be found in several of Sancho’s letters, for example on the question whether to celebrate the wedding in Bruges or in Antwerp. Sancho was marrying Catalina Gallo, the daughter of Juan López Gallo, one of the great Spanish financiers from Bruges, who served as a financial factor for Philip II from 1557, and baron of Male from 1560.85 Juan López Gallo was the son of Spanish merchant Luis López Gallo Vega who had by the end of the fifteenth century already possessed a house in Bruges. Juan had married Catalina Pardo Garrido, the daughter of Silvester Pardo and Josine López, also very important members of the Spanish merchant colony in Bruges. A grandson of Silvester’s, Juan Pardo, Lord of Frémicourt, would become Mayor of Bruges in 1574.\n\nBarbara, a sister of Sancho’s future bride, would marry Alonso López Gallo, born in Burgos in 1533 and Governor of Culemborg and Colonel of Walloon troops during the Revolt. Barbara was Alonso’s niece and Alonso was definitely not Juan’s son, as has often been suggested in the historical literature.87 In 1567 Alonso had still been a servant of Governess Margaret of Parma, and in that capacity he had gone to Spain in February to inform the King on matters she did not want to put down on paper.\n\nAlso involved in the marriage plans was Spanish merchant Hernando de Frías from Antwerp, who seemed to act as an intermediary and whose house in Antwerp might have been used for the celebrations.89 After Alba’s embargo on English goods in December 1568, the Duke had sold everything for a reasonable price to the same Frías.\n\nOn 14 January 1569 Prior Fernando de Toledo visited Antwerp where he was very well received by the Spanish and Italian merchants, the city government, the captains of the German troops in the city and the captains of the ten Spanish banners in the fortress. He went to visit the citadel on the 16th “and then they fired all the cannons with blanks, but the community (gemeynte) did not celebrate his arrival very much”.94 Again, on 11 August 1569, Fernando returned to Antwerp for Sancho’s tournament, described by Van Haecht in great detail, in an exception to most of his very concise entries, thus showing the importance he gave to these events. The young man must have been impressed by the glamour of the celebrations, albeit at the same time very critical of the participants and reflecting the dissatisfaction of the people:\n\nAnd they demanded that around the 15th day the golden rooms around the market square and the rooms of the largest guilds had to be opened, to dress and serve all those who came to the tournament. When those of the city had turned this down, they demanded the building of the silversmiths.\n\nAnd on the 13th day the bride of the castellan came sailing from Bruges to Antwerp with the cities’ barge, and a banquet was held on the quay. There were shots fired from the castle as if a queen had arrived and when a cannon burst, it left a Spaniard dead. The bride entered through the back gate of the monastery of Saint Michael, forced open by the Spaniards because Colonel Count Albrecht Ladron, who had to safeguard the city with his German soldiers, had refused to give them the keys….\n\nOn the 15th day in the morning, it started to rain again, and the same happened in the afternoon, ruining their celebrations and making them very angry. On the market square there were buried more than 330 small barrels with gunpowder, tied with iron strips and covered with wood and sand. … At four o’ clock it was fair weather again and the gentlemen came out to play, covered in silk and velvet, with feathers and other ornaments, but all on foot. Their small lances were as strong as glass as not to hurt each other, and the people did nothing else but mock them for not jousting on horseback.\n\nOn the 17th they arrived on horseback on the Meir, tilting at the ring, and in the end a man sat down on a wooden horse, gaining money by breaking up to two hundred lances on his armour. By then they had changed their dress, again very richly. There were also some brawls between their followers and the common people (‘den gemeyn volke’).\n\nOn the 18th after noon they tilted again at the ring inside the castle, but before noon it had rained again as heavy as the day before, with thunder and lightning. That night the corner of one of the walls of the castle collapsed.95\n\nThere seems to have been a very good relationship between Sancho and Prior Fernando de Toledo, both belonging to the circle of the Duke of Alba, but perhaps also because of their functions within the cavalry. Fernando often visited Antwerp, and his presence at the wedding festivities must have been very important for Sancho. And Fernando would return more often to enjoy himself in the city, as in February 1570 the Antwerp chronicler noted, “And it is known that the son of the Duke of Alba, now present in Antwerp, called the Grand Prior, lost ten thousand guilders in one night”.96 In a letter from March 1571 to Fernando, Sancho reminds him of their good times together:\n\nOf this city, I only have to tell Your Excellency that every day the absence and solitude that Your Excellency is making to the ladies is felt more strongly, be it widows, married ones or those still to be married. They are very pretty and have celebrated Carnival lacking in parties and people. The game has been stopped completely, as the players have neither credit nor money. That is a great loss for me as well, as there is no money for the construction of the citadel and it is a great pity that such an important work cannot be finished.97\n\nAlso in 1569, Alba tried to convince Philip II to reward Sancho with a place in one of the knightly orders in Spain:\n\nI have written to Your Majesty several times about how much Sancho Dávila, castellan of Antwerp, has served here, and how much he deserves to be rewarded. For this I beg Your Majesty to reward me by sending him a habit, for I would appreciate it as much as if Your Majesty would hand it to myself.98\n\nOnly a few months later Alba received a positive answer from the King:\n\nFor what Your Majesty has done regarding the habit of Sancho Dávila, I kiss his feet many times, and I can affirm to Your Majesty that he is one of the men of most service of all those he has in his estates.99\n\nIn a next letter he thanked the King on Sancho’s behalf: “Sancho Dávila is grateful for the habit he has been given”.100 It is uncertain whether Alba knew it had not been a simple decision for the King. In his letter to Alba informing him of Sancho’s habit the King had simply stated that “based on the services rendered by Sancho Dávila and your mediation, I have approved giving him the habit of Santiago, as you asked me to”. However, the minutes [draft] of the King’s letter had another sentence in between the lines, which had been struck out: “Although it was the idea to close the door to the habits for some time, but for things you want and request so wholehartedly, I could do nothing else than keep the door open”.\n\nBy 1570 Sancho Dávila had become a very important Spanish officer in the Low Countries, highly esteemed by the Duke of Alba, in part because of his decisive role in several battles against the rebels in 1568; he stood in close relation to the Duke’s son, Fernando; he was the official commander of Alba’s personal guard and castellano of the important citadel of Antwerp; the King had agreed to nominate him to become a knight of the order of Santiago; he had recently received a large payment for his office as infantry captain; and on top of all that he had married the daughter of a very rich Spanish merchant from Bruges, and the celebrations of his marriage had been the talk of the town. In 1570 he even had a son, an heir, called Fernando, surely in honour of the Duke and/or his natural son.103 Could life get any better?\n\nHowever, below the surface matters were not all that perfect. The knighthood still had to be approved by the order itself; relations between the Spanish troops and the burghers of Antwerp continued to worsen; there were people who wanted to take Antwerp citadel away from him; and, on top of everything, he was soon to lose his wife.\n\nThe local chronicler often reports on problems between the Spanish troops and the inhabitants of the city, now clearly criticising the behaviour of the Spaniards. For example:\n\nOn 4 April [1570] a Spaniard who was standing watch on the walls of the castle shot dead a burgher who, according to him, was walking too close to him. And recently, a Spaniard was kicked in the city for what he had said, and his companion escaped and ran to the castle shouting “Spani, Spani”; and a group of soldiers came out of the castle ready to enter the city, but then they wisely decided to remain.104\n\nAt another time they entered the city’s gardens:\n\nAt the end of this month, on the day of Saint John the Baptist, very early, some two hundred Spaniards had left the castle, breaking with their feet and swords, all the trees, fruits and herbs, standing around the castle in the Markgravelei ruining all the gardens and shelters, and dragging the trees behind the roads.105\n\nWas this last action perhaps related to the bonfires the Spanish build even today to celebrate the feast of Saint John the Baptist? In any case, it seems the chronicler did not understand their behaviour. The only other possible explanation could be that they wanted to have a better view from the citadel. But the idea of a celebration is plausible, as also on the day of Saint James we find the Spanish celebrating their national saint.\n\nRemarkably, we also have reports by Sancho of the difficult relations with the inhabitants of Antwerp: “Yesterday those of the city came to talk to me about the order to bring the keys for the night to the castle and the discomfort that this would entail for them”. They also complained about the new taxes and they wanted to give the keys to only two gates close to the citadel as two other water gates had to be opened every night “for cleaning the city”. Sancho hoped Albornoz would send an order to obey him “because they come up with more than a hundred thousand things, like those in Aragon”.106 In this quotation we see that complaints of the Antwerp mayors were being compared to the complaints of the officials of Aragon about their privileges. Sancho clearly did not welcome too much influence on his government from below.\n\nIt is possible that Sancho’s difficult relationship with the inhabitants may have been the reason for the Duke of Medinaceli, who had come to take over the government from Alba, suggesting that Sancho relinquish his post as castellano of Antwerp, “to take the castle of Antwerp away from Sancho Dávila and give it to another knight”.107 When he heard of this plan, Alba was furious and called it “una monstruosidad”. The Duke’s letter shows how strongly he defended his own men: “it would be such a great insult that I would not know where to hide for the people not to see me”. Alba understood Medinaceli was attempting to remove the men he himself had put in important places. He praised Sancho for all his services, and especially for the victory at Dahlem, one of his claims to fame up to 1571. The Duke’s anger is visible even through his rather dramatic formulation: “He [Sancho] is resting from his works and from the sweat and all the blood that he has shed, as he is such a man that if he were at the very end of the world, one should throw out the Duke [Medinaceli] and beg on our knees to His Majesty that he would make him come over here”. Alba had seen him fight “a million times”. Fortunately for Sancho, Medinaceli never really took over the government from Alba. And although Philip II had decided at some point to follow Medinaceli’s idea, this plan did not actually materialise at the time.\n\nHis most important setback, however, was the death of his wife in this period, leaving him with a new-born child, just as would happen to his friend and colleague Cristóbal de Mondragón. Young Fernando – “he was a beautiful child” – would be raised in Bruges in his deceased wife’s rich family. However, death struck again, as we find Sancho in October 1571 writing about the death of his father-in-law, Juan López Gallo.109 He had been to Male where he had also found Alonso López Gallo, one of the heirs. Most of Juan’s belongings, however, went to his eldest son. In the same letter Sancho expressed his wish to go home: “I desire to go to Spain as I have written to Your Honour, and now more than ever”. These last three tiny words (“y ahora mas”) are the only evidence of his personal feelings about his pitiful situation. His sentiments had changed, though the professional soldier was not spilling too many words on the subject.\n\nAfter the death of his wife and his father-in-law, relations with the Spanish merchants continued, as with the already mentioned Juan Pardo, a cousin of his wife Catalina and at the time an important member of the Bruges government as its first alderman. In December 1571 Sancho wanted to put this in-law forward as the new commissioner of Bruges within the four Estates of Flanders, and for this he needed a letter from Alba.110 As has been said, in 1574 Juan Pardo would become Mayor of Bruges. Based in Antwerp, Sancho was perfectly situated to connect to the rich Spanish merchant families of Antwerp and Bruges.\n\nThe relief of Middelburg (1572-1573)\n\nAfter the taking of Brielle by the rebels on 1 April 1572, the Revolt entered its second phase. When Spanish troops tried to enter Flushing to defend the town against the rebels, the inhabitants started firing at their ships and took one Spanish captain, Hernando Pacheco, prisoner. The city had changed sides. In early May, the town of Veere also joined the Revolt.112\n\nAround midnight on 6 May a fleet left Bergen-op-Zoom’s harbour with some 540 Spanish troops and seven hundred Walloons. The leader of the expedition was Sancho Dávila. It seems that Fadrique de Toledo, who himself was present in the harbour, did not agree with his father regarding Sancho’s appointment: “I harbour doubts about his old age and experience in warfare”.113 This seems a strange remark. The commander was 48 years old at the time and very experienced. It may reflect a troublesome relationship between the Duke’s son, Fadrique, and Sancho, while we have already seen that Sancho seems to have been very close to the Duke’s natural son, Fernando. Sancho, however, speaks highly of Fadrique’s military capabilities in a letter to Albornoz: “señor Fadrique is such a good warrior”.\n\nThe expedition has been recently described in detail by Clasien Rooze-Stouthamer. After disembarking the troops headed for the besieged Middelburg. The Walloons went first, with the Spaniards behind them, as they feared the burghers might not want to let Spanish troops in. Even Sancho himself was dressed as a Walloon. They succeeded in defeating the small rebel army around Middelburg and afterwards they also managed to conquer the port town of Arnemuiden (Ramua in Spanish sources) after a fierce confrontation resulting in many deaths.115 Cornejo even mentions the fact that Sancho had wished to continue towards Flushing, but his plans were thwarted by the governor of Zeeland.\n\nIn a very long letter Alba informed the King of the “cosas de Holanda y Gelanda”, giving the main credit for the expedition’s organisation to his son Fadrique. The Duke also wrote about the Walloons and the Spanish troops and how they went “so alike as if they were from the same nation”, probably referring to their clothing. According to the Duke, when they had all landed successfully at ten o’clock in the evening, Sancho told the troops that “nobody was to be disobedient in sacking or doing anything else”, threatening them with death. Alba informed the King about the plan to put the Walloons in the van “so that those of Middelburg will not be disturbed by seeing Spaniards”. However, in this version, the Spanish were essential to the fighting: “slaughtering a large number of them”. The Duke also used this letter to praise his beloved Sancho:\n\nI do not want to leave unsaid to Your Majesty that in all his estates he does not have a better soldier than Sancho Dávila, and as good, only very few… Besides actual fighting, like nobody has ever done, he has good fortune (“fortuna”) and therefore I took him out of Antwerp castle for this.\n\nOf course, it all revolved around remuneration: “to reward him and to thank him, for winning a battle over here and serving as he did in the expedition to Frisia [Jemmingen] in which he played a major role, as until now he has not been given any reward”.117 Does this mean that the earlier promises had not materialised yet, or is the Duke exagerrating Sancho’s needs?\n\nIn a Spanish account from the same day it was clearly Sancho’s decision to put the Walloons in the van, and this story can also be found in other reports of the event. One of these even mentioned Sancho as the principal actor in its heading. In this version Sancho also hides the Spaniards including himself “in Walloon dress”. On the fighting near Ramua we read about “slaughtering an enormous number of enemies”.118\n\nThe 1713 biographer uses the histories and chronicles of Bentivoglio, Trillo and Mendoza to create a completely different story, including a long speech by Sancho just after landing on the island of Walcheren: “We are going to attack sailors and fishermen, who hardly know the names of the weapons”.119 This narrative, mostly based on Trillo, is almost the complete opposite of the Spanish accounts. In this version Sancho wants to fight and he puts his Spanish troops in the van, and does not warn them to refrain from plunder. Trillo even adds that around Arnemuiden four hundred of the enemy were killed against only twenty wounded on the royal side. The fact that Trillo speaks of German troops fighting together with the Spaniards demonstrates his poor knowledge of the events.\n\nTo this can be added that, according to the author of the 1713 biography entitled El rayo de la guerra, it is precisely the very quick relief of Middelburg that gave Sancho the reputation of the Lighting Bolt of the war.121 Poet Pedro de Padilla, describing Sancho’s actions in Arnemuiden, specifies that “he massacred three companies of the enemy”.\n\nThey go about the streets greatly lamenting that in Arnemuiden not only were the men killed after surrendering, but also all the women and children, and this is what the English believe, saying that we are tyrants.123\n\nA Spanish manuscript chronicle however explicitly contradicts this version: “in less than one hour more than five hundred rebels died and nobody was left alive, except the women, children and the clerics who remained in the church”.124 Is this manuscript trying to counter the circulating negative views on the events at Arnemuiden?\n\nA few of Sancho’s letters from Arnemuiden are preserved, and they can contribute to reconstructing the situation. The writer says he is not very satisfied with his new place of residence, calling it “a very unhealthy place”. Hitherto he had had little experience in the wetter parts of the Low Countries. Sancho shows himself in these letters as a man drawing a clear distinction between good and evil. The Lord of Beauvoir (Babues in his letters), Philip of Lannoy, was highly praised: “he is such a good nobleman, has rendered important services and has upheld this island, and I am very pleased to be his soldier”.125 On the other hand, his opinion of the rebels was quite the opposite: “it is rabble, they use the same type of boats as the indians”. On Fadrique he writes positively though quite reservedly to Albornoz: “I think his presence here would be of much relevance”, but the comments on Fernando de Toledo seem more personal and might again relate to their shared banquets. Regarding himself he informs Albornoz that “my feet are feeling a little better, as I have not been able to walk for I do not know how many days”. The Lighting Bolt of the war had hardly been able to stand on his feet during the events that gave him his heroic nickname. He was by then almost turning fifty.\n\nAfter this first expedition to Zeeland Sancho returned to his citadel in Antwerp, at least as from early July 1572. He was busy organising the citadel, asking for more men and more artillery. It is striking that from this moment onwards the enemy is almost systematically called “the heretics”, unlike by other commanders like Mondragón and Valdés, who generally speak in a more neutral tone of ‘the enemy’.126\n\nAntonio Trillo describes that around that time Alba ordered Sancho to help out the besieged city of Goes in Zeeland. In his name Sancho sent his Antwerp Sargento Mayor, Francisco de Salvatierra, with gunpowder and rope for fuses. It was a very difficult undertaking as enemy ships had the island closed off, and “not even a bird could pass”. Salvatierra, however, told Sancho he would enter or die, to which Sancho answered, as was quoted literally in the chronicle, “it is not about entering or dying, but about entering or not going”. One morning before the end of July, Salvatierra left Bergen-op-Zoom disguised as a fisherman with two sailors and a servant, with the ammunition hidden under straw and fishing nets. Their expedition in disguise proved successful.127\n\nSancho then left with the army for Mons in Hainaut, where the army besieged the city which had taken sides with the rebels led by Count Louis of Nassau. Here again Sancho played a key role as a good practical commander. In the vicinity of Jemappes, Sancho ordered that nobody fire until the enemy was at close range, so no shots would be lost.128 However, in Trillo’s description of the siege of Mons Sancho’s role was limited to this brief appearance.\n\nIn October 1572 it was Sancho himself who successfully liberated Goes from the siege by the rebels, together with the Colonels Cristóbal de Mondragón and Arrieta. This is the famous crossing through the water that will be discussed in the chapter on Cristóbal de Mondragón. In Sancho’s letter to the Duke he described the situation just before the action:\n\nThe Sergeant Major of Colonel Mondragón and a soldier from the castle over here went on a reconnaissance mission, reporting that it was possible to execute the crossing, and for this reason Colonel Mondragón was now leaving in order to arrive at seven in the morning at the crossing where according to the information during low tide it was possible to walk in three hours up to the dykes, taking with him all his men and those of Colonel Arrieta and a company of Germans and a hundred Spaniards coming from elsewhere and from the castle over here, with more than twenty measures [quintales] of gunpowder in three hundred leather bags. Information about the outcome will be sent to Your Excellency\n\nand if it turns out as hoped, Your Excellency may decide whether they have to go ahead or if they have to return after liberating the island.129\n\nThough Mondragón was really the main protagonist of the expedition to relieve Goes, Sancho also received some of the praise. Alba and Albornoz sent him letters of congratulation. Alba even seems to put him before Mondragón; “so much satisfaction as was to be expected with you as the one guiding the relief of Goes”.130 Albornoz showed in his letter that he completely understood Sancho’s feelings: “the affairs are going so well that with the help of God, we will soon be able to see each other in Madrid”.\n\nThat Sancho may have had a strong personality and harsh character can be discerned through other sources. We know that Jean de Hangest, Lord of Genlis, had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Quiévrain on\n\n17 July 1572, and by January 1573 he was in Antwerp in Sancho’s custody. In a letter Dávila described how this French Huguenot leader, who had already served Orange in 1568, had bribed a musician in an attempt to escape, and now Sancho wanted to execute this musician for treason, “leaving his head as an example on the scaffold of the castle square”. Sancho also wanted Genlis dead, and if he could not be executed for trying to escape, “it is possible to burn him as a heretic, and this would be of great service to God and to His Majesty”.133 Though Sancho wrote that he wanted to send him to the famous prison of Vilvoorde, history has it that he died secretly strangled in his prison cell in Antwerp citadel.\n\nAfter orders came to take away Genlis’s irons, I am left totally confused by the copy of the letter that states not to lengthen his stay in prison … I think of letting him go, Your Honour should tell me what to do. If the Duke wants him to be put in another room with a guard at his cost, I do not refute that if this is what one wants to give him, this would not be a sad prison, being alone without anybody else, and more, he deserves it, although he says he has returned to being a christian and many other nice words.136\n\nBecause he was based in Antwerp, the conflict in Zeeland, and especially the preparation of an armada, took up a large part of Sancho’s attention.137 While Albornoz had his doubts “whether it was convenient to risk this armada”, Sancho wrote to him with a firm “if one does not risk, one is not to gain much”. In another letter he elaborated on his views:\n\nIf one does not fight, it is impossible to know whose would be the victory, and being the affair of the relief of Walcheren so very important, even though there would be a great risk of losing this armada, I think that, if one does not try to relieve them, it is as if the armada were lost anyway.138\n\nWe appreciate the precision in his preparations. He also suggests that it would be good to reward the sailors who wanted to serve in the fleet. In the end he seemed satisfied because though there were not enough sailors available, there were very good Netherlandish and Spanish seamen to serve in the expedition.139 In another letter he notes that many sailors did not wish to serve and tried to make others do the same.\n\nIn April a new fleet had been prepared, “as this relief has to be done because it is so important… I have great faith in God that we will succeed”.142 But this did not mean that he put his trust solely in God. To Alba he explained why he thought they were going to be successful: “Our ships are provided with good weapons and cannons, with good sailors and with many of our warriors”.\n\nThese expeditions are also described in Trillo’s chronicle, and here Sancho clearly appears as the protagonist of the action. One problem was the shallowness of the water, and on another occasion a thick fog prevented Sancho from seeing the enemy fleet. Trillo also describes the intense fighting and the fact that a cannon killed four soldiers, “taking the head of Colonel Arrieta”. However, besides the elements, the enemy fleet was also too strong. Trillo presents us with the heroic commander Sancho, who ordered “that everybody follow him and that they either die or destroy the enemy and pass”, but also with the experienced commander who was “well aware of what was needed”.147 Alba also defended Sancho in a letter to the King: “he fought for almost three hours with the enemies, and though they had more men, if the wind and the sea had not been against him, he would have passed with the ships of his armada”.\n\nIn April, Sancho’s expeditions even reminded the Duke of an event five years earlier: “for having occured in April, and almost on the same day you broke the heads of the rebels at Dahlem”.150 One Spanish unpublished chronicle mentions that by accident Sancho’s ship caught fire “and Sancho and sixty soldiers returned home with burned hands and faces”.\n\nIt is in the letters of this period that Sancho consistently started to use the word ‘herejes’ (heretics) as his most common name for the enemy, although ‘rebeldes’ is also used.153 We do not find this early confessionalisation of the conflict in the letters from the other commanders in this book, though Mondragón also used the word ‘heretics’ around the time he was in Antwerp with Sancho. It is remarkable that Sancho also uses the word ‘amigo’ more often than the other commanders,\n\nOne of the friends who appeared in the letters of this period was Antonio del Río, again a member of the Spanish merchant elite in the Low Countries, writing to him from Bruges on matters related to the war in Zeeland.155 Sancho tried to help him become the new commissioner of the confiscated goods. He started by pleading with Albornoz that “I do not have the wherewithal to pay those who show me their friendship”, and that only favours from the secretary could help him out. Del Río was “a person who merited so much and whose wishes were so deserved… a trustworthy person”. This he further explains by stating that “though he is Spanish, he understands the language of this country”. Hernando de Frías, who would also plead for his appointment, was also a friend of\n\nDel Río’s, “amigo suyo”.\n\nIn June there was a female visitor in the citadel, simply called doña Juana in the letters to secretary Albornoz:158\n\nMy lady doña Juana has stayed in the house of Fernando de Sevilla, so well attended by his wife and his children as possible. The day before yesterday she came to the castle at lunchtime without informing both me and Mondragón though we were serving the table. I asked her to stay in this house anywhere she wanted, as there are sufficient rooms. However, she decided to go to a house over here in the citadel, situated above the gate by the river. I think she will feel very alone there, though she has with her Hernández [?] who is so elegant and beautiful that it is a pleasure seeing her. Thank God that my lady doña Juana is recovering her health.159\n\nOn the feast of Santiago [25 July] doña Juana was still around: “my lady Juana is alternating good and bad days”.160 Sancho was writing here to Albornoz about Albornoz’s own sister and the wife of Sancho’s cousin, Rodrigo Orejón, his lieutenant in 1566 and during the Revolt the castellano of the important citadel of Valenciennes. Juana Albornoz had lived in Antwerp since 1571 and had fallen ill there. She refused to use the medicine prescribed by the famous humanist Benito Arias Montano and did not keep to her bed. By the end of August she had left for Spain, to die that very same year in Valencia.\n\nThe news that Haarlem had been won by the royal army in July 1573\n\nmakes Sancho dream about the complete surrender of the County of Holland: “Haarlem is now ours, with God’s help, with more time and money, all of Holland will be ours…. I wish this war to be over\n\nnow”. 162 It is possible that Alba then asked Dávila to join him in Utrecht, as suggested by a letter from the Duke.\n\nIn October 1573 we find Dávila in the city of Breda, where he had arrived with troops and artillery on 5 October.165 However, he returned to Antwerp before the end of the month. In between, Sancho was involved in the attack on the castle of Oosterhout and the town of\n\nGeertruidenberg. The eighty defenders of the castle tried to flee during the night, but at dawn Sancho‘s cavalry reached them “and cut them all to pieces, without anybody escaping”. During the fighting at\n\nGeertuidenberg “a good horse on which Sancho Dávila was fighting was wounded and died”.\n\nAn Albista under Luis de Requesens (1574)\n\nBy the end of the year the Duke of Alba was leaving the Low Countries and Luis de Requesens (1528-1576), Grand Commander [Comendador Mayor] of the Order of Santiago, would take over as the new Governor-general. He was the son of Juan de Zúñiga, former tutor to the young Philip II. It was the last opportunity for the military commanders to secure benefices from the old Duke and hopefully a passport to return with him to Spain, while at the same time the Duke himself was busy trying to convince them to remain in the Low Countries. In early December 1573 Alba wrote a long letter to Philip II in which he criticised the King for his treatment of Sancho, “who is very dissatisfied seeing that after so many years of service, Your Majesty has not given him any rewards, not even ordered to write to him”. Alba is clear in his opinion of Sancho: “Your Majesty has in these estates not one soldier like this one”.167 Again the question is whether the Duke was exaggerating Sancho’s needs in order to support his demands.\n\nSancho accompanied the Duke all the way to Namur in the south, and on 23 December he wrote a letter to Albornoz, who almost certainly was also present in the same city, beginning directly with an open and frank “the rewards Your Honour has to make me in Spain, with God’s help”.168 As the governorship of Antwerp was a very difficult position, complicated by the officials of the city government and the presence of many heretics, if the King wanted him to continue “he has to give me a very good reward of a continuous rent and raise my salary”. He seemed to understand that a knightly order would be a difficult reward to achieve, also suggesting the governorship of the castle of Milan,\n\nen la rrota de Dalem (Dahlem)\n\ny la de Frisa del conde Ludovico (Jemmingen)\n\ny en la escaramuça de la Yasa (river Gete; in Walloon: Djaçe)\n\ny en el socorro de Guelandia (Zelanda)\n\nde Bergas (Bergen-op-Zoom)\n\ny en los de Anberes (Antwerp)\n\na Balquem (Walcheren)\n\ny en la escaramuça sobre Mos (Mons)\n\ny en la rrota de la corneta de herreruelos sobre Santibitinbergue\n\n(Geertruidenberg)\n\ny la toma del castillo de Hostraat\n\n(Oosterhout; not Hoogstraten).\n\nAnd, of course, he had also served when his life had not been in danger, as he had been a soldier for thirty years. And he wanted to have permission to go to Spain.170 Did Sancho in Namur still try to join the Duke in his return to Spain? It is more than likely. Alba had to write explicitly to Requesens to inform his successor that he had sent Dávila back from Namur to serve the new governor.\n\nSancho was indeed right about the influence the change of governor would have on his career. For example, already by the end of January he was complaining that everybody else had received letters from Albornoz except him, though “nobody would be more happy with your letters than I would”.172 But of course he now received letters from Requesens.\n\nDuring Requesens’s first months in office another naval attempt was undertaken to lift the siege of Middelburg, with Sancho as the admiral of one of the relief fleets, the other one under Julián Romero. However, hardly any of Sancho’s letters from this period are preserved and more attention to this expedition has already been given in the chapter on Julián Romero. In a letter Requesens explained why he had chosen Sancho:\n\n“although he is not a sailor, he is a smart soldier with much courage and he has gone several times on these armadas”.174\n\nThe day before boarding his ship for this naval expedition, hoping to help out the besieged Cristóbal de Mondragón, Sancho was realistic about his own chances: “I don’t think we can relieve them, but we can divert the enemies by going to fight against them close to Flushing, so the ships that are loaded here can go from Bergen-op-Zoom to take the relief goods”.175 He even feared for his life and used a well-known expression to hide his emotions, thus revealing his philosophy: “a jug that often goes to the well will break its handle or spill the water”.\n\nThe new government literally knocked at his door, as councillor Gerónimo de Roda came to visit him to discuss Albornoz’s position. Sancho directly explained to Roda “la amistad” he had with Albornoz. It seems that the conversation dealt with accusations of theft, but Sancho defended his old friend as a good servant of the King. He accused others of “finding faults in everything from the past”. In Spain Albornoz was imprisoned, but in the end all charges of corruption were dropped.179 He would inform Requesens about “the truth and the dirty tricks”. At this time Sancho was still very positive about the new governor:\n\nThe lord Comendador Mayor [Requesens] rewards me much and I almost think he wants to reward me even more in secret, as he understands that there are many who do not like me. Until now he shows great worship for the affairs of the Duke [Alba].180\n\nSancho also reflected on the future: “if the King would not give more to my children than to me; if God gives me glory this would mean more than anything”. Does the use of the plural form regarding his progeny imply that young Fernando had siblings, as Sancho could never have lied about this to somebody like Albornoz who knew him so well? Furthermore, as we have seen, they were even family, as Sancho’s cousin, Rodrigo Orejón, the castellano of Valenciennes, was Albornoz’s brother-in-law.181 Or is he simply speaking in general terms and maybe thinking of future\n\noffspring?\n\nAt the beginning of March 1574 Sancho headed for the surroundings of Maastricht. Trillo informs us in his chronicle that Sancho had been appointed Captain-general of the whole army that would be gathered there to stop the new invasion from Germany. According to the French ambassador, a first attack by Sancho on the enemy camp had ended in disaster, with three captains dead and between three and four hundred dead soldiers.182 Trillo, however, attempts to portray Sancho as victorious during these confrontations.\n\nIn affairs of such importance I wanted to govern myself as a captain of Venetians, because it is certain that all of us here seem to be men of republics, because although I am the eldest here, until now there is not a better one.184\n\nSancho knew with certainty that a battle was approaching: “we could go and attack these heretics and I thought that with God’s help we could break them… our soldiers are good-spirited and the heretics are very fearful”. 185 The same martial tone can be detected in Trillo’s chronicle: “General Sancho Dávila always had a great desire to battle with the Count of Nassau”. Here, the reality of the letters coincides perfectly with the tone of the chronicler. Even Requesens lost his mostly reserved tone: “it was a good occasion to break the heads of these villains”, further speaking of “breaking these heretics”.\n\nThe Battle of Mookerheyde (1574)\n\nBernardino de Mendoza, captain of light cavalry, belonged to Sancho‘s impressive army that had to thwart the invasion from Germany under Count Louis of Nassau, together with Maestres de campo like Gonzalo de Bracamonte and Fernando de Toledo, and other experienced commanders such as Cristóbal de Mondragón.187 Maestre de campo Francisco de Valdés was still on his way from Leiden. The royal army crossed the Maas looking for the enemy. Eyewitness and participant Bernardino de Mendoza has left us a detailed description of the events, in which Sancho clearly comes to the fore as the main commander of the army taking all the important decisions, and Bernardino himself, present in the third person, as one of the main protagonists of the battle in his role as commander of the cavalry. On 14 April the rebel army lost 2,500 men, “according to what\n\nthe villagers said, without counting those who remained at the battlefield and those who drowned”.\n\nTrillo calls him “the very brave Sancho Dávila”, and his excellent tactics were “extremely prudent (prudentíssima), … copying the ancient Romans. In this Sancho Dávila there was so much valour and military prudence that among all the nations he was seen as a very important captain”.191 In Trillo’s chronicle, Sancho decided that some German prisoners were not to be killed but instead gave them some money after making them swear they would not serve Orange for the next two years. Compared to the mostly strategic comments on the battle from Mendoza, we find more small details in Trillo’s description, like the story of a wounded soldier asking a barber to cut off his arm, offering him his own dagger. They buried the arm and after six hours of bleeding he was cured. In Trillo’s history the ordinary soldiers were also heroes.\n\nThe Battle of Mookerheyde was international front-page news, and many pamphlets on the events in German, Spanish, French and Italian flew off the printing presses.192 In the French version Sancho even made it into the title of the publication, while in the others only the defeated Louis of Nassau was prominently mentioned. While both the Italian and the French texts agree on the number of deaths on the rebel side (five thousand infantry and 1,500 cavalry) and on the fact that Louis had escaped alive, information which was not at all accurate, they differ greatly in style. The pamphlet in French is strongly religious and dedicates most pages to voicing a Catholic vision of the situation in the Low Countries. Sancho is praised as “accort et vaillant”, and the text even precisely records the places where Louis was hit (ribs; thigh). This text was written in Antwerp on 18 April 1574. On the other hand, the Italian pamphlet is much more military in its content, mentioning the names of all important commanders, including Mondragón and Bernardino de Mendoza. Nothing special is mentioned about Sancho, and Requesens is seen as the great victor. This text was written in Brussels on 17 April. The title of the Spanish pamphlet reveals that it is closely related to the Italian one.\n\nLooking at other sorts of sources we encounter different echoes. The French secretary of Louis of Nassau, for instance, described Sancho as a “bon cappitain” who at the battle “was resolved to prefer dying to failing”.195 The tone of a published pamphlet and a letter could therefore strongly diverge in their message, even if they came from the same side of the conflict: a valiant enemy did not fit the pamphlet, but emphasising the cruel deeds of the Spaniards did. Interestingly, a more nuanced military author such as Mendoza found it unproblematic to praise Louis of Nassau in his published chronicle.\n\nThe victory of Mookerheyde has in subsequent centuries generated an important memory culture in both Spain and the Netherlands. Many of the banners, among them the banner of Count Louis of Nassau, would end up in the central chapel of the church of John the Baptist in Ávila, where Sancho and his descendants would be buried, and some of these banners remained there until the War of the Spanish Succession (1700-1714). The mast of Louis of Nassau’s banner was still in the possession of the Marquis of Miraflores when he wrote his book in 1857, together with parts of his armour and paintings of Sancho and his family members.196 Both the paintings and a piece of the mast of Nassau’s banner still remain in the possession of Sancho’s descendants.\n\nIn the nineteenth century a fierce debate on the commemoration of the Battle of Mookerheyde emerged in the Low Countries. It was the period of Catholic emancipation, and several Catholic authors from the eastern regions of the country refused to see the battle according to the Protestant and Hollandocentric vision of the war in which the Nassau brothers were considered national heroes defending the patria. Local historians, such as Catholic priest Meulleners, disagreed in their articles with the views of eminent academic professors such as Robert Fruin and P.J. Blok. In 1891 a commemorative plaque was unveiled, attached to the wall of a Protestant church in Heumen, a village within the province of Gelderland, as those from the adjacent province of Limburg did not want to participate in the celebrations. Maastricht city archivist and historian H.H.E. Wouters attempted to bridge the divide during a speech in Mook at the 1974 commemoration, but there is still even today a large gap between the understanding of the war in the often Catholic regions of the south-eastern parts of the country and the dominant Hollandocentric and Protestant master narrative, a historiographical dichotomy that also resurfaced during the commemorations of the beginning of the Eighty Years’ War in 2018.199\n\nIn the context of historical reevaluation an educational programme for schoolchildren has recently been developed to provide a better understanding of the Battle of Mookerheyde. In this manner Dutch children may learn about Sancho’s ‘trick’, leaving his trumpeters and drummers on a small island in the river. At night they started making lots of noise, depriving the rebel troops of sleep, but also leaving them unaware of the real location of the royal troops. In Mendoza’s words, “soldiers that everywhere and all the time were restlessly sounding the call to arms, both on the river in small boats and on the other side”.200 Gasparus de L’Agarge, possibly the chaplain of the Lord of Hierges, has left a description of the battle in which he highlights the great deeds of his lord, but also mentions the remarkable noise-making, as the Spaniards were “cunning as ever”.\n\nClose to the scene of the battle (in Bisselt) there are roads called Mendozaweg, Mondragonweg and Avilaweg, named after three of the Spanish commanders involved in the battle. Nonetheless, Sancho remains quite unknown within the Dutch context. A Dutch author who recently wrote a long article on the battle failed even to mention Sancho’s name, as Mookerheyde is mostly seen in Dutch historiography as the battle of the Nassau brothers. However, there is also a recently published Dutch historical novel on Mookerheyde in which Sancho is described as a very experienced commander who was a hero and celebrity in his own country because of his victories. According to this book, Sancho had not dared to start the battle until he knew reinforcements were on their way, and he outsmarted Louis of Nassau on the battlefield.202 Such positive descriptions of a Spanish commander against the backdrop of the Revolt in the Low Countries are not obvious for most Dutch authors, since the Black Legend narrative still plays a role in perpetuating historical\n\nstereotypes.\n\nThe victory at Mookerheyde would, however, become a bittersweet one, as the soldiers would start a mutiny directly afterwards. In the long letter Sancho sent to Requesens on 14 April he still told him just about the victory, describing the heroic deeds of his men and of the most important officers. He also reported on the death and wounded: “We have only a few dead and wounded men, though it still weights heavily for concerning such good soldiers”.203 Three days later, Requesens forwarded this letter to the King together with one of his own: “I hope this [victory] offers the occasion and the start of a different way of managing the affairs of these states, completely different from the way it has been proceding until now”.\n\nRequesens’s letter to Philip II was successful as the King would reward Sancho with an annual income of two thousand florins from the confiscated goods. He would also be sent the official papers of his\n\nposition as castellano of Antwerp citadel as he would now finally receive this office in full possession.206 Royal secretary Zayas also congratulated him on the victory a few days later.\n\nI may say that I have raised you all at my breast, and especially Your Honour as we have been walking together for many years in this office, and so they have congratulated me for your exploits, and for a good reason, as nobody deserves this more than me.208\n\nThe great mutiny (1574)\n\nThe story of the mutiny would overshadow Sancho’s heroic victory at Mookerheyde. Mendoza informs us how Sancho spoke to the mutineers directly the morning after the mutiny:\n\nSancho Dávila addressed them, saying what an ugly thing they were trying to do, and that they should see that with it they obscured the honour that their nation had received the day before and that they cut the thread of the victories and exploits that were expected of them, eradicating the rebels from the states.209\n\nThe mutiny took the glory of the victory away: “I am shocked that they so voluntarily wish to lose the fruits and the honour of the victory”, wrote\n\nRequesens to Sancho.210 Requesens explained that he had always paid his troops well, but now there was no money left: “I am Spanish, and I love and appraise my nation so much, as all those who were born in Spain, and the more I suffer for giving others a reason for undervaluating us”. He would forgive the mutineers without any punishment, and even offered “his silver and the jewels from his house, leaving me with nothing, and I would even hand them my own person”.\n\nOn 22 April Sancho arrived from Mookerheyde at Antwerp’s city gate with a company of cavalry. Those of the city let only Sancho’s servants enter and not the soldiers, until they had received orders from Governor Champagney to let them in. However, before Champagney arrived, Sancho had already entered with all of his men through the citadel, which had its own outside gate, “sounding the trumpets and dragging along the banners they had won at Mookerheyde”.211 Champagney and Dávila found themselves now clearly on two opposing sides, though both serving the interests of the King: “it was heard that there had been a conflict or hate between the castellan and Champagney, and it is to be feared that the burghers will have to suffer the consequences”.\n\nAt the end of April Dávila wrote a letter about Mookerheyde to his old master, the Duke of Alba, but it was all about the mutiny. He explained how the mutineers had entered the city of Antwerp and “stuck to the wall until the junction with the castle”. Dávila was critical of the mutineers in his letter to Alba since they had entered while Requesens was in the city, but he remarked that he still thought they were behaving decently: “until now they have not created more disorder”. Because Requesens did not have enough experienced men around him, “it is not possible he [Requesens] is without confusion”.216 No doubt he was accusing Champagney, but he did not mention him explicitly.\n\nThe very same day he wrote a much longer, and much more personal, letter to Albornoz, now directly attacking Champagney and criticising Requesens’s strategy: “He is so inclined to comply with Champagney that even the other day when he came from Brussels, though I [Sancho] had not kissed his hands after the journey [Mookerheyde] I did not succeed in doing so, and at the quay where he disembarked he did not speak a word to me, but only slightly removed his hat”.217 This moment must have certainly hurt Sancho. The hero of Mookerheyde had just returned from his victory and his Governor-general did not receive him with the necessary honours: “the lord Commander [Requesens] knows how\n\nhe [Champagney] really is, but for some reason he has to treat him with kid gloves”.\n\nChampagney wanted to use force against the mutineers, while Sancho tried to avoid any violence: “he [Champagney] wanted to take some cannons from the armada and put them on the wall against the soldiers. To this I replied that it would not be a bad thing to remove the cannons that were facing the Prince [Orange] and put them facing the Spaniards”. This is the most sarcastic remark to be found in Sancho’s correspondence with Albornoz. Sancho also told Alba’s secretary the story about Champagney refusing him entry to the city.220 And while he still hoped the mutineers would remain calm, for himself his objectives were clear: “to go to Spain”.\n\nChampagney wrote a long letter in French (in cipher) to Requesens in which he tried to convince the Governor-general of his side of the story.222 He stated that regarding Sancho “I have no particular feeling”, though he was not a friend of his. But he had learned that Sancho had written letters against an important figure, “subtlely to sow dissension”. But he had calmed everything down in order not to fuel the “hate and enmity between the nations”. He even said that if the highly placed Netherlanders knew of Sancho’s letters, they would all try to kill Sancho “even if he possessed a hundred lives”.\n\nAfter this general characterisation of the situation, Champagney entered into more detail. Sancho had already promised his men before the battle that they could enter Antwerp afterwards, “where they would be paid by the burghers”, a story also to be found with Van Haecht and Morillon. Sancho had also taken no action against the mutineers. Champagney wanted only to return to Antwerp with enough soldiers of his own, “otherwise I would merely serve as the subject of mockery and laughter, for both Sancho Dávila and his fellows, and as object of their growing insults”. He had always been a friend of the Spaniards, but only of those who feared both God and King.\n\nMatters got even worse in Antwerp, and in the words of Requesens, “this mutiny of those from the castle has been the worst evil in the world”. Requesens would later even blame the mutineers for losing the Low Countries, as quoted in a famous letter by Hernando Delgadillo:\n\nHe [Requesens] insisted that it was not the Prince of Orange who had made them lose the Low Countries, but the soldiers born in Valladolid and Toledo, because the mutineers had driven money out of Antwerp and destroyed all credit and reputation, and he believed that within eight days His Majesty would not have anything left here…He continued for almost three hours.223\n\nThe situation was now out of control. The mutineers even tried to kill Francisco de Valdés and Julián Romero during the course of the mutiny. In a long letter, Requesens, who had preferred to wait to write to the King until after the mutiny was over, had no choice but to inform the King while the mutiny was still in full swing.224\n\nRequesens’s brother, Juan de Zúñiga, discussed Sancho’s position in a letter to his brother:\n\nRegarding Sancho Dávila there has to be taken much consideration, as he is such a good soldier, and Your Excellency has so few who can really help out, that there has to be great care taken not to stain him with being the one behind the mutiny.225\n\nJuan could not believe that Sancho was the instigator of the mutiny, but he did agree that Sancho had not done enough to stop the mutineers. A good option would be to take him with the army that summer and then send him to Spain on some commission. The King could then use him somewhere else: “he is so hated by those of these lands that it would cause much damage if he were to stay”. Juan also discussed with his brother the possibility of giving Sancho the command of the light cavalry and Alonso de Vargas the Antwerp citadel, but Juan thought the citadel would be better for Gaspar de Robles or Cristóbal Mondragón “as they are such good soldiers and so accepted by those of these lands”. The command of an infantry tercio for Sancho would be unfair compared to his governorship of Antwerp citadel, because “with his reputation he could not accept it”.226\n\nRequesens explained the situation to the King: “[Champagney] serves with such disgust and controversy that it is impossible to reconcile both him and Sancho Dávila, although I have tried my very best with both of them, and it will create great inconveniences”.227 Little would Requesens know that after his death the conflict between these two men would escalate severely, leading up to the Spanish Fury. The Governor-general clearly supported Sancho, “the soldier with the most services that Your Majesty has in these estates”, but he still thought it better to use Sancho somewhere else because of the ‘general opinion’ that he had played a role in the entry of the mutineers into Antwerp.\n\nMorillon offers the most terrible description of the mutiny in his letters to Granvelle. The Spanish mutineers awakened the inhabitants at night screaming as if they were going to kill everybody, and in this way an infinity of pregnant women aborted or gave birth before their time, and many old people died or were sick with fear, “and more than two or three thousand women went to [the County of] Flanders”. All the foreign merchants, Portuguese, German and English, were leaving the city as they wanted security “and they don’t want to trust a barbarian castellan, saying that the castle, that should protect them is the origin of the danger”. Together with barbaric castellan Sancho as the main cause of the disaster, Mondragón is also attacked by Morillon: “And it is certain that Sancho Dávila and Mondragón, through their imprudence (témérité) and insolence (oultrecuidance), have caused the robbing of this city”. It is clear to Morillon that “if the said Sancho Dávila remains in the castle, it is everybody’s opinion that the merchants will abandon the city”. He even feared Sancho would become the new governor of the whole city, as this would cause its complete ruin, “as he is not a politician, but brutal and superb as a lion, he would prefer to tyrannise, something the people in the long run will not support”. The inhabitants would then even welcome the enemy into the city. At a more general level he blamed the Duke of Alba who had permitted the soldiers to do what they wanted, and “all those who have had offices under him are frauds and robbers, getting pleasure out of destroying the country”. They should send them all to Italy and bring back “better disciplined soldiers”.228 In a letter somewhat later, Morillon defined his views on the situation in a one-liner: “Sancho d’Avila, who on his own is the source and cause of all our trouble”.\n\nThe fact that the Spanish soldiers from the citadel had not fired on the mutineers when they were getting in also meant that there were people who wished to have Sancho removed as castellan and his place taken by somebody from the Duchy of Brabant. This story also reached the French court.230 But it may even have been the case that Sancho never actually received the official patent of castellan. In a letter written several months after Sancho’s victory at Mookerheyde in 1574, the King told Governor-general Requesens that “I have decided that he may receive the office of castellan of Antwerp as his property, though for the moment it seems to me more convenient not to send him the official papers, out of respect for the pretentions of those from Brabant against giving offices to foreigners, but you can say it to him from my part, although he has to keep silent about it until the right time comes”. The mutiny made the whole situation too complicated: “the papers will be sent when the time is ripe and the present problems are gone, most of all those with the Estates of Brabant”.\n\nThe ongoing war (1574-1576)\n\nSancho remained in Antwerp after the mutiny had ended. However, it was clear that the tide had turned, perfectly demonstrated by the fact that Requesens had removed Alba’s statue from the citadel’s central square and placed it in a room in the citadel. Sancho wanted to know from the Duke how to send it to Spain as it was “a pity to destroy it”. The plinth, which was very heavy, could be buried in a bulwark for the time being. A few days later, Sancho suggested the statue could go to Alba’s palace in Alba de Tormes or to La Abadía, now calling it “such a lovely piece”.233 The idea that it was sent to Spain also circulated in the Low Countries.\n\nRequesens had informed Sancho that the King had decided to reward him with an income of a thousand escudos, but the commander was not satisfied as he had hoped for more. His deeds at Mookerheyde, his new and most important claim to fame, in his eyes justified his higher expectations. However, he did acknowledge that Requesens had given him many favours and gifts “out of respect for the Duke my lord” and had also invited him to meetings of his war council on the expedition to support Zeeland. His main wish was to receive a licence to go to Spain: “I don’t want a castle nor more rewards than that what they have to pay me”, and even more poetically, “I am already [too] old to always eat kisses”. But his patron could not help him: “I cannot become accustomed to the fact that the Duke my lord lacks the power to support me”.235\n\nMorillon reports on a party in the Antwerp citadel when Requesens came to visit on 19 August:\n\nIn general it was taken badly that instead of chasing out Sancho Dávila, as according to everbody’s opinion he rightly deserved, His Excellency [Requesens] went to have dinner with him at the castle… Where there was a great feast, with the most beautiful ladies of Antwerp, leaving their husbands at home. There was nobody from the Low Countries at the party.236\n\nNotwithstanding the ladies from Antwerp, Sancho regretted the fact that he had lost most of his friends in the Low Countries: “it makes me sad to see so many people and friends leave these estates”, using a famous quotation to underline this idea: “it seems that one might use the words of Carvajal, that the wind is removing strands of my hair, two at a time”.237 In the chapter on Mondragón we will see somebody quoting this same saying.\n\nAgain we find traces of Sancho’s special relationship with merchant Hernando de Frías: “He has given his friends all the sorrow in the world as we received news that he had been killed in France”. Only later did they learn he was held prisoner. Sancho showed how he valued his friendship wih Frías: if he did not have the money for his ransom, his friends would give it to him. “Until now I have not heard that he has been set free and returned home, something I wish with whole my heart (en estremo)”.238 In another letter to Albornoz he was even more explicit: “he is the best friend we have… he is so passionate for what is important for us… one of the most honourable men I have ever met”.\n\nIn June 1574, Sancho suddenly speaks of a second marriage, although it is difficult to judge whether he really meant what he was writing:\n\nI have decided to get married and it has been accorded to take place within ten to twelve days; they say the lady is not very beautiful, as I have not looked at her very well; she will be virtuous as she also has no possessions; God will approve and separate us from sin.241\n\nBy August 1574 they were already marrried, but again Sancho was not lucky with the health of his new wife: “the lady Violante is so sick and so thin that the only thing to say is that she has to remain in bed without moving for eight or nine months”.242 Was she pregnant? The next year he had to give Albornoz the sad news: “God has been served by taking the lady Violante to heave"
