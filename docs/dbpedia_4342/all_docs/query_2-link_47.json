University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 2008\n\nShort Bio:\n\nI am a theoretical condensed matter physicist and material scientist, that specializes in computational - physics/materials science/chemistry/engineering, and many-body theory. In other words, I study methods for solving the Schr√∂dinger's or Dirac's equation, machine learning equations, among others. These methods include development of computational algorithms and their mathematical properties.\n\nDr. Mendoza's research has been featured in Forbes magazine, CNBC, Public Radio, MRS Bulletin, C&ampEN News, Laser Focus World magazine, and the DOE Highlights. His research has been disseminated through 53 invited talks both nationally and internationally. Dr. Mendoza's research has received funding from NSF, DOE, DOD, APS, Sloan Foundation, to name a few.\n\nDr. Mendoza was awarded the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) Newcomb Cleveland Award, this Society's oldest and most prestigious award; the International Center for Material Research (ICMR) fellowship; and the Roberto Rocca Fellowship. More recently, he has been awarded the ONR Faculty Fellowship (2017), and the Carl Storm Fellowship (2018). In 2018, he was named an Emerging Investigator by the Royal Society of Chemistry and was named a 2020,2021 and 2022 Scialog Fellow.\n\nDr. Mendoza has made significant contributions to the understanding of structure in 2D-materials, energy storage, catalysis, and how to use data-mining and machine learning on the physical sciences. More specifically, he has provided significant advances on understanding defects in 2D-materials, future 2D-materials, next-generation Li-batteries, hydrogen storage, and catalysis for clean energy (CO2 reduction, water splitting, and hydrogen evolution), materials design principles, machine learning force fields, and material databases for data mining.\n\nBecause of graduate and post-graduate studies advisors, Dr. Mendoza-Cortes' academic great grand parents are Marie Curie and Paul Dirac.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\nScialog fellow, 50 faculty/year including both USA and Canada, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.\n\nEmerging Investigator by the Royal Society (RSC), 2018.\n\nCarl Storm Fellowship, Gordon Research Conference, 2018.\n\nONR Summer Faculty Research Fellow, 2017.\n\nCRC assistant professor award, 2016.\n\nCaltech Graduate Student Travel Award, 2010.\n\nRoberto Rocca Graduate Fellowship, 2009.\n\nInternational Center for Materials Research fellowship, 2009.\n\nAAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize, 2007; AAAS's oldest award (AAAS = American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS is the 'The World's Largest General Scientific Society')\n\nSnyder Research Fellowship (UIUC), 2005.\n\nScientific pedigree:\n\nPh.D.\n\nJ.L.
