        "text": "In December 1511, on successive Sundays of Advent, the Dominican friar Antonio de Montesinos delivered a series of rousing sermons from the pulpit of the main church of Santo Domingo in which he took the Castilian colonists of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola to task for their treatment of the Indians. The protests of Montesinos and his fellow Dominicans prompted King Ferdinand of Aragon (r. 1479–1516) to convene a junta in the Castilian city of Burgos in 1512 to examine the legality of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and the attendant treatment of the region’s inhabitants. One result of the meeting at Burgos was that the jurist and law professor Juan López de Palacios Rubios was commissioned to codify the Requerimiento, the document Castilian conquistadors were to read to indigenous peoples upon first contact. In no uncertain terms, the Requerimiento demanded of its listeners “that you acknowledge the Church as the Ruler and Superior of the whole world and the high priest called Pope, and in his name the King and Queen Doña Juana our lords, in his place, as superiors and lords and kings of these islands and this Terra Firme.”\n\nAside from this prescription, the Requerimiento contained numerous other bewildering stipulations, such as the contradictory assurance that the Indians would not be compelled to convert to Christianity and yet that, like others who had already converted voluntarily, they were “held and obliged to do the same.” The confounding logic of obligatory voluntary conversion was grist for the mills of a bevy of critics, the most vocal of whom was Bartolomé de Las Casas. This “defender of the Indians” immediately labeled the doctrines espoused by the Requerimiento as heretical and interpreted the text as a cynical cloak for a land grab. Indeed, viewed in its American context, the Requerimiento contains an inscrutable logic, a fact noted by many critics and scholars over the past five centuries. When analyzed in a broader context, however, one that encompasses early modern Spanish expansionary ventures in the Old World as well as the New, the Requerimiento becomes more intelligible, and indeed, the text can be taken as an indicator of the (often messy) legal and moral quandaries Spanish jurists attempted to resolve as they faced the contingencies presented by a Spanish monarchy that, nearly overnight, had become a global empire.\n\nDuring the same years that Castile established the earliest European colonies in the Caribbean, the Spanish Crown directed a series of conquests 5,000 miles to the east: Castilian forces completed the conquest of Nasrid Granada in 1492; beyond the Peninsula, Castile conquered the last two of the Canary Islands (La Palma and Tenerife, 1492–96), and between 1497 and 1510, Castile and Aragon conquered or annexed a string of African cities and fortresses in a venture dubbed the empresa de África. By 1510, the realms of Castile and Aragon were masters of a network of presidios along a 2,500-mile stretch of Maghribi coastline, from Cape Bojador on the Atlantic to Tripoli on the Mediterranean.\n\nSpain’s initial success in the empresa de África was viewed through a lens of unbridled optimism. Numerous examples of this can be seen in the reactions to the Spanish conquest of Tripoli in 1510. On August 13, 1510, the Italian humanist Peter Martyr, at that time with the court of King Ferdinand of Aragon, composed a letter to his friend Iñigo López de Mendoza, the second Count of Tendilla, in which he could barely contain his enthusiasm: “Concerning Africa,” he wrote, “listen to this piece of news, impossible to believe accounting only for human agency. You will have heard that Tripoli is a city of Barbary, the richest emporium of Africa, defended by impregnable walls and towers, surrounded by sea and land, fortified by nature as well as the artifice of man, and under the rule of the king of Tunis. Leading an armada that departed from the Aeolian Isles, Count Pedro Navarro has arrived at the city and subjugated it.” Seven months earlier, following the surrender of the city of Bougie to Spanish forces, Martyr had exuberantly proclaimed, “From now on, nothing will be difficult for the Spaniards; they will undertake nothing in vain. They have sown panic throughout Africa.”\n\nMany in King Ferdinand’s inner circle subscribed to Martyr’s view of these events, interpreting Spanish expansion across the Maghrib as predestined and as a prelude to the imminent acquisition of all of Mediterranean Africa. It was projected that Spanish forces would then use Africa as a base from which to launch a series of Levantine conquests that would soon encompass Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and the Holy Land. The same day Peter Martyr wrote to López de Mendoza, King Ferdinand composed a letter to Cardinal Francisco Ximénez de Cisneros, claiming that Navarro’s victory (achieved July 25, the day of Saint James, the patron saint of Castile) demonstrated God’s clemency, and that the path (camino) was being opened for the completion of the “holy enterprise,” a term that referred to the recovery of Jerusalem.\n\nThe understanding of Spain’s victory at Tripoli as but one component of a wider crusading strategy prevailed outside Spain as well. On September 8, 1510, Emery d’Amboise, the master of the Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, based at Rhodes, wrote to Ferdinand congratulating him on recent Spanish victories in the African cities of Bougie and Tripoli. The Knights of Saint John had ordered solemn processions to mark the conquest of Tripoli, he related, and he expressed confidence that the Spanish would soon reach Egypt, where Amboise’s military order would join forces with them to “liberate” the Holy Land:\n\nMay it please God that all Christians, following Your Majesty’s example, take up arms against the infidels who have afflicted the Christian nation for so long. And in their lands may we raise the banner of the cross and recover the Holy Land, a task that will not be as difficult as many ignorant people believe. … [M]ay God Almighty carry out Your Majesty’s wishes and allow you to proceed with and complete the conquest of Africa as far as Egypt, where … we hope to join forces with Your Highness’s army and serve God in this worthy endeavor.\n\nAlthough this process of Mediterranean expansion is less well known today than the contemporaneous incursions into the Americas, in the early sixteenth century it occupied a position of utmost importance in royal policy and, not unlike its American counterpart, Spain’s Mediterranean expansion required legal buttressing in order to fend off European competitors. On occasion, the two expansionary processes were even addressed in the same text. Following the junta at Burgos, Palacios Rubios composed a legal tract titled De insulis that elaborated the full legal and theological arguments underlying the Requerimiento. The jurist’s primary aim in De insulis was to present a legal grounding for Castilian claims to the islands and mainland of the Americas. The treatise, however, includes a number of passages in which the author develops arguments justifying Spanish claims to a variety of Old World locales. As part of his argumentative strategy, Palacios Rubios invokes Spanish claims to the formerly Islamic Kingdom of Granada, and he includes a ten-page excursus in which he defends Spanish expansionary ventures in North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. The Requerimiento is thus but a small part of a significantly broader corpus of work, whereby Spaniards attempted to craft legal doctrines that would justify conquest and imperial claims in a variety of lands, including the Islamic Mediterranean, Catholic Navarre and Naples, as well as the gentile-inhabited Canary Islands and Americas. It is only by analyzing the Requerimiento against the contemporaneous arguments deployed in De insulis and other related sources that the document’s bewildering prescriptions are made somewhat more intelligible. Doing so produces a more complete understanding of Spanish doctrines of just war in a variety of locales, Muslim and gentile alike.\n\n•\n\nThe reading of the Requerimiento could only have aroused confusion, perhaps among the readers as much as among the auditors. King Ferdinand apparently stipulated that the text be read with an interpreter present. Las Casas, however, implies that this protocol was rarely, if ever, followed. Even in cases where linguistic comprehension presented no barriers, the Requerimiento must have been conceptually incomprehensible. The text’s early passages relate a biblical history of the earth and humankind, in which five millennia are telescoped into seven sentences. The Requerimiento recounts that God bequeathed all dominion to the papacy, thus giving the pope universal jurisdiction: “God our Lord gave charge to one man, called St. Peter, that he should be Lord and Superior of all men in the world, that all should obey him, and that he should be head of the whole human race, wherever men should live, and under whatever law, sect, or belief they should be; and he gave him the world for his kingdom and jurisdiction.” Since then, Peter’s successors have all inherited this jurisdiction over the world, and one of these, Pope Alexander VI (r. 1492–1503) (although he is unnamed in the text), donated the western lands to the monarchs of Spain, entrusting them with the task of spreading the gospel to this part of the world. The document thus implies that non-Christians may not exercise dominium, a position that accords with that of Hostiensis, the thirteenth-century canonist who made this argument with respect to the Muslim rulers of the Holy Land. The text of De insulis is more nuanced on whether non-­Christians could possess dominium. Here, the jurist elucidated the theological foundations of universal papal dominion: all the world had been Christ’s, and he bestowed full jurisdiction, temporal and spiritual, upon Peter. As legitimate heir to Peter, the pope now possesses this dominion over the entirety of the world, including all its inhabitants, Christian as well as infidel. In acknowledgment of all the territories of the world that, in fact, did not recognize the authority of the pope, Palacios Rubios wrote that through a tacit arrangement (un consentimiento precario) the church allows certain infidels to continue to exercise jurisdiction in their lands. The jurist stressed, though, that this does not result in the transfer of dominion or possession to the infidels. The pope may therefore abrogate this “agreement” in order to dispense lands anywhere in the world.\n\nPalacios Rubios’s elaboration in De insulis, then, affirms the doctrine expressed in the Requerimiento that the pope may donate lands not ruled by Christians and, in theory at least, that the pope may do so anywhere in the world. Palacios Rubios, however, adds a wrinkle to this line of reasoning. The jurist poses the question of whether, in some remote past, Christianity had ever been preached in the Americas. He concludes that either Christianity had never reached American shores or, if it had, so much time had elapsed that all vestiges of that evangelization had disappeared and it should be considered that the gospel had never been preached in the Americas.\n\nIf Palacios Rubios argued that infidels could not hold dominium, thus defending the papal donation of lands not under Christian rule, then why include the excursus hypothesizing, and then ruling out, an earlier Christian presence in the Americas? Simply put, the lack of some early Christian presence that had ultimately been subjugated by later invaders or conquerors had the effect of absolving the American Indians of the charge of usurpation (or apostasy). For Palacios Rubios, the fact that they were not usurpers endowed the Indians with a sort of quasi dominium. For certain Spanish writers, including Martín Fernández Enciso, the fact that the Indians were idolaters sufficed to justify their conquest and enslavement. Palacios Rubios made no such argument. Indeed, he maintained that the Indians might legitimately defend themselves before they were informed of the truth of Christianity by the Spanish. On the basis of the precepts of natural law, Palacios Rubios held that up until they were notified of the arrival of Christianity, the Indians’ defense of their lands against the Spanish constituted a just war.\n\nAnd this brings us to the crux of the legal and ideological work that the Requerimiento was designed to perform: the act of reading the text to the inhabitants of the American islands and mainland served as an announcement of Christianity to the gentiles: “we … notify and make known to you, as best we can, that the Lord our God, Living and Eternal, created the Heaven and the Earth, and one man and one woman, of whom you and I, and all the men of the world, were and are descendants, and all those who come after us.” In addition to informing the Indians of Christianity, the performance of the Requerimiento was, in theory, supposed to operate as a proffer of peace. While the Requerimiento itself makes no explicit mention of this, in De insulis Palacios Rubios was clear that an olive branch must be extended before an act of war could be committed. Here Palacios Rubios was following a prescription laid down in Deuteronomy 20:10–14, a text that was profoundly influential on medieval theories of just war.\n\nFor Palacios Rubios, the proffer of peace was rescindable, should the infidels refuse to admit preachers. Under those circumstances it would be licit for the Christians to take up arms. The importance placed on non-Christian rulers admitting Christian missionaries, known as the ius praedicandi, or the “right to preach,” was an established tenet of canon law in the later Middle Ages. The Requerimiento is consistent with the principles of canon law on the ius praedicandi, noting in several instances that the Indians were required to admit preachers: “that you consent and give place that these religious fathers should declare and preach to you the aforesaid.” Since the Requerimiento was drafted at the moment that Spaniards were embarking on the conquest of the American mainland, the text invoked the previous two decades of Spanish experience in the Caribbean islands as precedent. In regard to the islanders who had already come under the rule of the Spanish monarchy, the Requerimiento noted that they had “received and obeyed the priests whom their Highnesses sent to preach to them and to teach them our Holy Faith.”\n\nAt this point the text offered an unspecified length of time during which to consider the terms set forth in the document: “Therefore as best we can, we ask and require you that you consider what we have said to you, and that you take the time that shall be necessary to understand and deliberate upon it.” In De insulis, Palacios Rubios is no clearer on how much time might be offered for deliberation. The jurist wrote simply of a “reasonable amount of time”—a “plazo prudencial”—in which to consider the terms. If the Indians did not agree by the specified time to admit preachers, it would be just to invade their lands, seize their goods, and enslave their persons.\n\nThe objective of allowing the admission of priests was ostensibly the conversion of the Indians to Catholicism. Voluntary, rather than coerced, conversion was held to be a more sincere embrace of the faith. The text of the Requerimiento provided the reassurance that the Indians would face no coercion: “and they shall not compel you to turn Christians, unless you yourselves, when informed of the truth, should wish to be converted to our Holy Catholic Faith, as almost all the inhabitants of the rest of the islands have done.” On this point, however, the logic of the Requerimiento attains the acme of incoherence (or cynicism). Again alluding to the precedent of the Caribbean islanders, Palacios Rubios wrote, “and all these, of their own free will, without any reward or condition, have become Christians.” And then, in the very same sentence, the text stipulates, “and you too are held and obliged to do the same.”\n\nThe consequences, should the Indians not comply, would be severe: “But if you do not do this, and wickedly and intentionally delay to do so, I certify to you that, with the help of God, we shall forcibly enter your country and shall make war against you in all ways and manners that we can, and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of their Highnesses.” It is not clear what “this” refers to in the first clause of this sentence. If you do not admit priests? Or if you do not convert? De insulis offers modest clarification on this point, insofar as the lengthier juridical tract’s language seems to refer specifically to the admission of priests: “they are obliged to admit priests, that they might explain to them the mysteries of our faith. And if, after a reasonable amount of time in which to decide, they choose not to do it [admit priests], they may be invaded and taken through an act of war.”\n\nThe Requerimiento and De insulis thus seem to transmit rather muddled messages concerning the demands the Spaniards placed on the Indians vis-à-vis the admission of priests or conversion to Christianity. De insulis, composed in Latin, was never published or propagated in the Americas. And as Las Casas sardonically noted, the Requerimiento was usually pronounced in Castilian, a language the Indians understood no better than they did Latin. While Palacios Rubios clearly had no control over the language in which his composition was read on American soil, the lack of clarity in the text itself suggests that the jurist did not care terribly much about the spiritual salvation of the Indians. Rather, his objective seems to have been to broadcast to the papacy (and probably to other European powers as well) that Spain’s actions in the Americas were primarily geared toward the peaceful and voluntary conversion of the Indians. In this regard, Spain was in compliance with the terms stipulated in the papal bulls of donation, particularly Inter caetera. In the donation, Pope Alexander VI had written, “we earnestly require, that, since you intend to prosecute such expedition at all and to undertake it with a mind wholeheartedly zealous for the orthodox faith, you should endeavour and feel obliged to induce the peoples living in such islands to accept the Christian profession, that no perils nor labours should deter you.” Through the reading of the Requerimiento, then, Spaniards demonstrated that they were actively prosecuting the evangelizing mission that Alexander VI had stipulated. Neither Portugal nor France nor any other polity could impugn Spanish claims to America on those grounds.\n\nHere it is instructive to consider the parallel process of Spanish expansion in the Mediterranean. Spanish claims to Africa, like those to America, had been sanctioned by a papal bull of donation. Less than two years after promulgating Inter caetera, Alexander VI issued Ineffabilis et summi, a bull remarkably similar in content to Inter caetera. As with the bull to the Americas, Alexander VI exhorted Ferdinand and Isabella to undertake a mission of evangelization: “and I exhort you that if, with God’s favor, you should acquire Africa or a portion thereof, you work with all diligence and effort, as befitting Catholic princes, that the name of our Savior be honored there and that the Catholic faith be augmented, so that in this way, in addition to the eternal reward, you should merit our blessing and that of the apostolic see as well as other benedictions.”\n\nSome Spaniards, most notably Cardinal Francisco Ximénez de Cisneros, did hold evangelizing aspirations in Africa and worked toward that end. And as we saw in Ferdinand’s letter to Cisneros quoted earlier in this article, Ferdinand was happy to represent the empresa de África as a crusade, as a war undertaken for the faith and one that led inevitably toward a Christian recovery of the Holy Land. This, of course, allowed him to make use of the funds that were raised through the cruzada levy. For at least fifteen years, this continued to be the light in which Ferdinand’s African enterprise was cast. In March 1510 Pope Julius II (r. 1503–13) issued the bull Sacrosanctae Romane, in which he praised Ferdinand’s efforts “to bring an end, through blood and fire, to the perfidious sect [of Islam].” Julius went on to express optimism that the African expedition that Ferdinand was planning for that summer would lead, eventually, to the ultimate “destruction of all vestiges of the impious superstition [of Islam].”\n\nPope Julius’s words do not indicate whether he envisioned the conversion of African Muslims and the salvation of their souls or merely their death or subjugation as the geographical boundaries of Christendom were extended. For all the lip service Ferdinand paid to the ideals of crusade and (possibly) evangelization, in practice on the ground the Aragonese king proved flexible and pragmatic, ever willing to work out an ad hoc system to preserve his conquered territories, even if that entailed abdicating the evangelical responsibilities imposed by a papal bull. Two months following Julius’s Sacrosanctae Romane, Ferdinand wrote to Pedro Navarro, giving the commander instructions on how to negotiate terms with Muley Andalla [sic: read Abdallah], the emir of recently conquered Bougie. What Ferdinand proposed was a condominium of sorts: Ferdinand suggested that he would populate the African cities along the coast with Christians, but that the defeated emir would be allowed to control as much of the interior as he desired, maintaining control over his subjects, as well as all “rents, goods, and jurisdiction” (rentas, bienes, jurisdicción, etc.), while the coast should belong to Ferdinand and his successors. Along the coast, Ferdinand would enjoy complete jurisdiction over both the Christian and Muslim populations. Ferdinand would now be king of Bougie, meaning that Muley Abdallah would need to use a different title. In recognition of his vassalage, the Muslim ruler would pay an annual tribute to Ferdinand. The arrangement the Aragonese king proposed allowed for the possibility of Ferdinand’s acquiring new Muslim subjects. While Spanish men of the cloth may have held evangelizing aspirations in Africa, such a mission does not appear to have been a priority for Ferdinand. If one were to look for Iberian analogues to this arrangement, it might be useful to think of Muley Abdallah as a ta’ifa king entering into a relationship of vassalage with Ferdinand.\n\nSeven months later, in December of the same year, Ferdinand wrote to Navarro again, this time giving him instructions to execute an attack on Tunis the following summer (1511). Ferdinand expressed hope that Navarro’s expedition might conquer a large swath of land stretching into the interior. In the event that that should occur, wrote the king, he would receive the Muslims of the interior as mudéjar subjects. The summer of 1511 brought no such Spanish conquest of Tunis, but if Ferdinand’s plans had come to fruition, this would have represented a significant departure from the injunctions to evangelize that were present in Sacrosanctae Romane and the earlier Ineffabilis et summi. It seems that, by late 1510, Ferdinand had opted for a more traditionally medieval Iberian custom of allowing ongoing Islamic practice, by a mudéjar population now subject to a Christian ruler. As Bougie was incorporated into the Crown of Aragon and Tunis lay within the region that would go to Aragon if conquered, Ferdinand’s policy vis-à-vis Muslim subjects was really no different from his policy within the Crown of Aragon proper. That region of eastern Iberia would have a Muslim population up until Charles V applied the edict mandating conversion or exile in 1526. Even as it accorded with his policy in Aragon, Ferdinand’s approach in Africa stands in sharp contrast to the policies being simultaneously implemented in Granada, and it clearly circumvents the injunctions laid out in the bull Ineffabilis.\n\n•\n\nFerdinand’s circumvention of the papal injunctions to evangelize is echoed in Palacios Rubios’s defense of Spanish claims to Muslim-ruled lands in the Mediterranean. Because De insulis was completed sometime between 1512 and 1515, the jurist is here offering a post facto defense of those conquests that Spain had already effected in Africa, but his wording makes it clear that he envisions more conquests to come. In his excursus on Spain’s rights to Granada, Africa, and Palestine, the jurist makes no reference to Ineffabilis or a policy of conversion. Indeed, Palacios Rubios’s argument differs in significant ways from the doctrines justifying conquest in the Americas that he espoused in the Requerimiento and in De insulis. Palacios Rubios invoked the recent Spanish conquest of Nasrid Granada as a point of departure from which he could draw conclusions about the perduring nature of Christian political rights in lands that had at any time been under Christian rule: “A prince may licitly defend his patrimony or recuperate it if he has lost it. … From which it may be inferred that the conquest of all territories held by infidels that were at one point subject to Spain belongs to the king of this nation, in his capacity as universal heir to the Kingdom of Spain.” As far as Palacios Rubios was concerned, however, the immutable nature of these rights was rooted not only in the dynastic history of Iberian monarchy but in the shifting religious power relations of the medieval Mediterranean: “From this it may be argued that if any region, province, or kingdom was ever possessed by Christians and later occupied or usurped by infidels, the former may recover the land by their own authority.” Palacios Rubios thus concluded that Ferdinand and Isabella’s decade-long campaign against Granada qualified as a “just and holy war.”\n\nPalacios Rubios extrapolated from the case of Granada to propound a similar argument in support of Spanish claims in Africa, an expansionary process that, as we have seen, had been under way for at least fifteen years when he wrote De insulis. “Africa, in the time of Saint Augustine, bishop of Hippo, was under the dominion of the Christian kings of Spain. … Later this land was occupied, as it currently is, by the infidels, and it ought to be subjugated by one who comes from a royal line.” It is true that the Visigothic kings of late antique Hispania claimed suzerainty over the African province of Mauretania Tingitana, and it is this fact to which Palacios Rubios appeals when he issues the patrimonial side of his argument. But the legal principle the jurist invokes is as rooted in the early Christian presence in Africa as it is in the recovery of lost patrimony. The emphasis on Africa’s Christian past is implicit in Palacios Rubios’s reminder that it had been the native land of Saint Augustine, and he describes sixteenth-century Africa as “occupied” by the same infidels, prone to violence and tyranny, who had occupied Granada for eight centuries. Palacios Rubios thus argues that Spain’s rights in Africa are essentially equivalent to those in Granada. This rendered Spanish conquests, such as that of Tripoli, like Granada, a “just and holy war.”\n\nIn De insulis, Palacios Rubios also articulated Ferdinand’s right to conquer the defunct crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. While this was merely an aspirational conquest (and would remain so), Palacios Rubios wrote that for political and religious reasons, Ferdinand (more than any other Christian prince) possessed the right to execute the crusading enterprise. Through Ferdinand’s conquest of the Kingdom of Naples (1503), the Aragonese monarch had obtained the title to Jerusalem. In addition to this, however, Palacios Rubios impugned the Mamluks’ right to rule over the Holy Land on the grounds of their religious identity. Following centuries of early Christian history in the eastern Mediterranean, wrote the jurist, “the infidels violently occupied [the Holy Land] and now rule it as tyrants.” This was but one of numerous factors that, for Palacios Rubios, legitimated a Christian assault on Palestine.\n\nTo the modern reader, the passage of eight centuries of Islamic rule stretches the parameters of what might reasonably qualify as a just war of recuperation. Palacios Rubios, however, insisted that the passage of time makes no difference: “nor can [the land’s] current rulers defend themselves on the grounds that so much time has passed, for since they took possession of the land unjustly [in bad faith, de mala fe], no statute of limitations applies to them.”\n\nThe arguments that Palacios Rubios offers in De insulis in defense of Spanish claims to Muslim-ruled lands in the Mediterranean do not include a protocol for conquest such as applied in the Americas. Nowhere does the jurist mention an offer of peace as part of the process of declaring war against Granada, North Africa, or Palestine. Nor does the jurist address the admission of priests to Muslim lands or a period of deliberation during which the invaded were invited to consider terms. Evidence does point to at least one of these conventions being practiced in Spanish interconfessional warfare in the Mediterranean. The Castilian chronicler Andrés Bernáldez, in his Memorias del reinado de los reyes católicos, describes Pedro Navarro’s negotiations with the “sheikh” of the island of Djerba, off the coast of Tunisia, during 1510. In this case, the sheikh, a Castilian renegade, asked for a period of deliberation during which he might consult with his subjects, a request that Navarro granted. But in the case of Djerba, there was no need to read anything like the Requerimiento. There was no formal announcement of Christianity, nor does Bernáldez (or any other chronicler) refer to the ius praedicandi as a demand to be made in these negotiations. In this case, after all, the sheikh originally hailed from Castile and was a Catholic apostate. While this is admittedly an extreme example with which to make my point, nowhere in the Mediterranean world or its hinterlands was a formal announcement of Christianity deemed a necessary prelude to war.\n\nPalacios Rubios’s tract suggests that in the Mediterranean religious landscape other conditions obtained, making the proffer of peace unnecessary. In all three Mediterranean cases that he cites, the fact that the lands had at one time been Christian rendered military action an act of defensive war. As such, presumably, it was not necessary to first offer peace. Rather, the basis of Spanish claims to these territories rested on the illegitimacy of Muslim rule due to their status as usurpers and tyrants.\n\nThere is no question that the Spanish experience in Granada and North Africa informed the ways in which conquistadors understood and recounted their experiences in the Americas. While the influence of these recent (in some cases contemporaneous) episodes of warfare against non-Christian foes is undeniable, I believe it bears emphasizing that the Dar al-Islam occupied a different space in Spanish political thought than did the novel lands of the Americas. Bartolomé de Las Casas articulated this distinction when he wrote that Spanish rights in America were not the same as those in Africa, where Spaniards had the unfettered right to make war and to subjugate the inhabitants. What Las Casas meant by this statement was that the Turks and Moors of Barbary and the eastern Mediterranean had an open and declared war against Christendom. Las Casas argued that, in the case of the Muslims of the Mediterranean, there was no doubt that Spain was engaged in a “just war,” and even that these actions qualified as a “legitimate defense.” Las Casas also weighed in on the papal donation of lands, drawing a contrast between donations of Mediterranean territories such as Africa or Jerusalem and the donation of the Americas. He noted that different conditions applied in the Mediterranean, because the Moors and Turks, as “open and declared enemies, persecutors of us and of our Catholic faith,” had usurped Christian lands and ruled them tyrannically.\n\nFor Las Casas, it was the act of usurpation that invalidated the rights of Muslims to exercise dominium. And while Las Casas’s juxtaposition of innocent American gentiles against aggressive Muslim infidels is well known, a rarely cited passage in his Historia de las Indias confirms that it is their usurpation, rather than their confessional identity, that rendered Mediterranean Muslims guilty. In the portion of the Historia chronicling the actions of the Portuguese in Guinea, Las Casas asserts that their enslavement of the Muslim inhabitants of that region was unjustified, as those lands had never been Christian, and their rulers, therefore, could not be guilty of charges of usurpation. In this light, Palacios Rubios’s determination that the Americas had never been Christian, even in some remote past, takes on new significance.\n\nIn drawing attention to the legal distinctions rendering Spanish actions in Mediterranean Africa different from those in the Americas, Las Casas asserted that some of the confusion on these points had arisen from a tendency to conflate different “types” of infidels, thus understanding the innocent gentiles of the Americas as equivalent to the violent usurpers of Christian lands in the Mediterranean. Las Casas suggested that the tendency to elide different types of infidels arose from a reading of Hostiensis, the canonist who in the thirteenth century, Las Casas suggested, could not have been familiar with innocent gentiles but knew only about the infidels who had “tyrannically usurped the Holy Land, Spain, and Africa.” For Las Casas, and for many of his contemporaries, there was a sharp distinction between different types of infidels. The friar Matías de Paz, who, along with Palacios Rubios, was present at the junta of Burgos, wrote a treatise in 1512 on Spanish rights of dominion over the American Indians. In this text, Paz elucidated what he perceived to be the “positive” sin of denying Christianity (of which were guilty the Jews, Saracens, Turks, and Christian heretics) and the lesser sin (if it even qualified as a sin) of which were guilty the American gentiles.\n\n•\n\nThroughout De insulis, Palacios Rubios employs the term “infidel” indiscriminately to describe Berbers, Arabs, Turks, and the gentiles of the Americas. And yet, the jurist is in fact acutely aware of the significant differences that demarcate these “infidels” in the legal thinking of his day. The Requerimiento implicitly recognizes the difference, and De insulis, in its postulations on whether Christianity had ever reached the Americas in the distant past, is even more explicit on this point. Ostensibly, the Requerimiento served to announce to Catholic Europe that Spain’s actions in America accorded with the terms of Inter caetera, and that the Spanish monarchy was engaged in an evangelizing mission geared toward achieving the conversion of the Indians. Fundamentally, however, the performance of the Requerimiento accomplished something quite different: through the announcement of Christianity, the demand that preachers be admitted, and the presentation to the gentiles of a choice to be made, the reading of the text removed the Indians from a state of “innocent” pagan “gentility.” For certain Europeans, this step was not a necessary prelude to a declaration of war. For instance, for Martín Fernández Enciso the Indians’ idolatry (among other putative violations of natural law) sufficed to justify the use of force against them. Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda followed a similar logic at the Valladolid debate of 1550–51 when, drawing on Aristotelian notions, he declared that the Indians met the criteria of “natural slaves.” Members of what might be considered a more moderate school of legal thought (of which Las Casas is the most prominent exponent) interpreted the Indians’ status as gentiles as protection against acts of war and enslavement (de jure, if not de facto). The act of reading the Requerimiento removed the protection afforded by the Indians’ lack of exposure to Christianity. As Palacios Rubios wrote in De insulis, citing Saint Augustine, “once the truth is made manifest, old traditions must yield.” During the approximately six minutes that might transpire during the notary’s reading of the Requerimiento, eight centuries of Mediterranean interconfessional relations were effectively telescoped, in order to arrive at the same circumstances that governed European just-war arguments concerning Africa, Palestine, and Granada. In this brief span of time, what Paja Faudree has labeled the “discursive rupture” separating the Spaniards from the Indians fundamentally altered the legal conditions that obtained, thereby justifying acts of violence under any circumstances other than the Indians’ admission of priests.\n\nWhile the papal bulls donating lands in both Africa and the Americas stipulated the evangelizing mission that Spain was expected to undertake, in the case of the Mediterranean, Spanish jurists found ways to circumvent the papacy’s demands. This was due, in part, to the fact that there existed a variety of means of articulating claims of sovereignty in the Mediterranean that were not predicated on conversion and, indeed, that could be articulated in ways that bypassed the expansive powers the papacy claimed. Palacios Rubios, who clearly supported these sweeping powers in the context of the bulls of donation pertaining to the Americas, actually went so far as to imply that the papacy’s powers were more limited in the Eastern Hemisphere. In addressing Ferdinand’s rights to make war in Granada and in the Canary Islands (both of which, Palacios Rubios argued, constituted part of ancient Hispania), the jurist wrote that Spain was justified in resorting to force to “reclaim” these lands, “because there exists no higher authority before whom to plead for justice [in this case].” This statement suggests that Palacios Rubios believed that in Old World locales the ancient precedent offered by the religious and political history of the region afforded wider latitude in which to articulate legal claims. The just-war argument Palacios Rubios appealed to as justification for Spanish aggression in the Mediterranean was predicated on those campaigns qualifying as a defensive war. As such, there was no need to announce Christianity or to offer peace. In the context of the Caribbean, the lack of any evidence of Christian history in the region rendered the defensive-war argument absurd. It was this distinction that necessitated the codification of the Requerimiento and the bewildering demands the document made of the Indians. Only once the Indians had refused to recognize the sovereign authority of the Catholic Church, or refused to admit preachers within the stipulated time, could the Spaniards enter into conflict that would meet the criteria of a just war.\n\nThis brings us back to the letters pertaining to the Spanish conquest of Tripoli that I cited earlier in this article: Ferdinand of Aragon employed diplomatic correspondence and the patronage of chroniclers to broadcast domestically and internationally that Spanish incursions into Africa were undertaken as a crusade for the faith. This was a crusade predicated, not on the conversion of Muslims or the salvation of souls, but on the conquest of territory and the extension of the limits of Christendom. Indeed, ideologies of holy war were not necessarily predicated on the conversion of the vanquished.\n\nAs such, Spanish actions in Africa might not have accorded perfectly with the injunction in Ineffabilis et summi that the Spanish monarchs evangelize in Africa. What is clearly elucidated in juridical texts such as De insulis and in the writings of Las Casas is the fact that Spanish monarchs did not feel dependent on the papacy to recognize their claims in Africa and Palestine to the extent that they did in the Americas. Spanish political thought on war against a Muslim foe, and on political claims to lands that could be proved to have at one time been under Christian rule, differed from thinking on the question of just war, conquest, and enslavement in lands that had never been exposed to Christianity. The two expansionary ventures, Mediterranean and Atlantic, and the legal arguments they engendered no doubt informed one another. And in their abuses and disregard for human life they might have borne a strong resemblance the one to the other. But at the level of legal and theological doctrine, the two processes were in fact quite distinct. And it was this distinction that demanded the performance of the Requerimiento. Cynical the text may have been, but the codification of the Requerimiento reveals the nuances of Spanish political thought on conquest and just war in lands inhabited by a variety of non-Christian peoples."
