Cet article examine comment les discours liés à la défaite du corsaire Francis Drake à Panama (1596) furent négociés, censurés et réélaborés suivant les intérêts des groupes politiques en place à la cour à cette époque. L’allusion récurrente à la dernière expédition de Drake dans les histoires espagnoles de la première moitié du XVIIe siècle invite à penser les enjeux historiques et politiques de l’écriture de l’histoire récente de l’Empire Ibérique. Les trajectoires politiques de ces deux médiateurs politiques de la connaissance historique soulignent aussi la complémentarité des pratiques historiographiques des historiens royaux sous les règnes de Philippe II et Philippe III avec celles des mercenaires de l’histoire qui sous le règne de Philippe IV (1621-1665) contribuèrent à la mise en œuvre des grandes politiques d’histoire visant à optimiser les prises de décision politique au sein de l’Empire Ibérique.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n4Francisco Caro de Torres was the agent sent to Madrid to defend reputation of the Capitan General of Tierrafirme, Alonso de Sotomayor y Valmediano's (1545-1610) The parallel analysis of his version of Drake's defeat in Panama, and that of Antonio de Herrera as part of the elaboration of a global narrative of recent deeds, is fundamental to understanding the nature of the politics of history at the end of the reign of Philip II and the projection of that politics of history during the first part of the seventeenth century. At the end of the sixteenth century political action and prudence relied in a substantive part on historical analysis. Monarchs and their councilors were well aware that history was a necessity for politics, and the convergences of the information provided by agents like Caro de Torres with the work of historiographers like Herrera became indispensable for illustrating the good administration and prudence of the Monarchy.\n\nOfficial Historiography and the Fight for the Present: The Need for Political Information\n\nThe president ordered that Antonio de Herrera should say the following in front of Tomás de Angulo:\n\n11By giving this statement and insisting on his willingness to follow the king's command, Herrera's exile was wiped clean from the official record.\n\nUnofficial Historians and the Need for Global Historical Expertise\n\n19Political experts like Caro de Torres, whether officially appointed or employed on an ad hoc basis, provided important political counsel and educational materials for the royal household. Historical information, including the history of the present, could also be used to fuel the rivalries between different political factions attached to the court, whose partisans tried to take advantage of the historical information which had a privileged place in the royal attention in order to communicate strategic versions of events. The studies of Elizabeth Wright and Antonio Sánchez Jiménez concerning La Dragontea of Lope have shown that Caro de Torres and Antonio de Herrera's accounts of Alonso de Sotomayor's conflict with Drake was directly linked to the personal and professional disagreements that had arisen between Sotomayor and the alcalde of the city of Nombre de Dios, Diego Suárez de Amaya. Both of these men, Sotomayor and Suárez de Amaya, tried to vindicate the defeat of Drake in Panama by sending the King their own account of the events in order to assure their promotion within the Indies cursus honorum. Ultimately it was Sotomayor who would win the coveted position as head of the Audiencia of Panama.\n\n24As he fashioned himself into a global political and historical expert, Caro de Torres's mission went far beyond his trip to Spain in 1596 and its consequences lasted at least until the middle of the reign of Philip IV. Caro de Torres's career reveals the scope of the Political Turn in historiography at this time and underlines the limits of the contributions of royal historiographers like Herrera or the would-be historiographer Lope to the writing of the global and political history of the Iberian Empire.\n\nThe Afterlife of History: The Legacy of Herrera\n\n25The telling and re-telling of the Drake episode throughout the reigns of Philip II and Philip III demonstrates how the rivalries between royal officials in the Indies, the reports made by their agents across the Atlantic, the censorship of the historiographers who wanted to block access to new candidates, all converged at the court in Madrid. The networks of circulation of historical and political information were highly heterogeneous. The case of Drake in Panama is only one example of how the same historical material could be used as a traditional narrative dedicated to vindicate the deeds of the King and his subjects, as a mirror for Princes made for educational purpose, or as legal evidence to support the competing claims to jurisdiction of Sotomayor or Amaya in Panama which was then deployed as a political tool in the factionalism at court.\n\n26The many ways in which history circulated at the Court reflected how official history was unable to monopolize the political dimension of the past. The multiplication of many historical accounts similar to that of Caro de Torres, proceeding from the four parts of the world, retained the attention of the monarch and his counselors and fostered the activity of Herrera as a specialist trained to sift through and select the accounts that would be incorporated to his historical works.\n\n27The mission of Caro de Torres might have remained only an anecdote if it were limited to the polemics that occurred at the end of the reign of Philip II. However, after his return to Panama and his final trip to Madrid with Alonso de Sotomayor in 1604, Caro de Torres continued to vindicate the memory and the rights of Alonso de Sotomayor using the Drake episode. Alonso de Sotomayor was later appointed as one of the counselors of Indies, and from that position he was well placed to facilitate the work of Caro de Torres with official documents. After the death of his patron in 1610, Caro de Torres became the executor of Sotomayor's will (albacea) and pursued the vindication of his former master's deeds at court in Madrid in order to help Sotomayor's sons access the benefits of their father's services.\n\n28As discussed above, in Madrid in 1620, Caro de Torres published the Relación of his 1596 mission in order to prove and make public the services of his patron for a new generation and new groups of power. The edition of such a Relación was not a novelty, but Caro de Torres made innovative use of all the typographical recourses that were available to him in order to sustain the claims of his text, including the publishing official documents with their official signature, assuring that even if they were copies they carried the record of their certification. These typographical strategies, though motivated by the personal interests of the Sotomayor family, helped establish Caro de Torres's printed Relación as the most authoritative account in Spanish historiography of Drake's final expedition.\n\n29Between its initial oral delivery in 1596 and its printed publication in 1620, the Relación demonstrated the development of an alternative approach to official historiography, one which was produced outside official court circles by a series of people who had mastered techniques of publication in order to criticize official historians and use historical accounts for their own ends. Caro de Torres argued that:\n\nConclusion\n\n38Meanwhile, the publication of the Relación of Caro de Torres in 1620 helped situate its author in the list of candidates who hoped to gain a title as royal historiographer. Lope de Vega was also running for the same post and Caro de Torres’ Relación was meant to renew the attacks against Lope as an unfaithful historian, by highlighting the differences between the two representations of the Drake episode and asserting that Caro de Torres's version was the more politically reliable. In any case, neither Caro de Torres nor Lope was appointed as royal historiographer of the Indies despite the fact that Caro de Torres continued to compete for the title of Herrera after his death in 1626.\n\n39Herrera learned to deal with information agents like Caro de Torres, many of whom were moving on the edge of the political legality as defined by the most powerful groups at this time like the factions of Lerma or Olivares. Caro de Torres was well read and became one of the most active historians and historical censors, alongside Olivares’s famous « hired pens » at the court of Philip IV, like Virgilio Malvezzi or the French Jesuit Librarian of the Escorial, Claudio Clemente. More than a reaction against royal historiography, the apparition of « hired pens » that is linked with the politics of history of Philip IV’s reign was the result, on the one hand, of the political orientation of royal historiography at the court that had been incarnated by Antonio de Herrera, and, on the other hand, of the dynamics of information transmitted by men like Caro de Torres, used to crossing from the furthest reaches of the empire into the heart of the court's historiographical debates."
