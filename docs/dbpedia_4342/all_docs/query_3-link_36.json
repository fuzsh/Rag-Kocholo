        "text": "Chapter I\n\nCaptain Julián: the hero of the battlefield1\n\nThe myth of Captain Julián\n\nCaptain Julián was already an international celebrity in his lifetime. A legendary duel, fought in the summer of 1546 at the royal court at Fontainebleau in the presence of the French royal family and the envoy of the English King, first made the name of this hitherto completely anonymous soldier a famous ‘nom de guerre’. And this would not be all. In 1557 he was one of the most important Spanish heroes at the heroic struggle for Saint-Quentin between the French and the army of King Philip II. Between 1567 and 1577 he served as commander (Maestre de campo) of a regiment (tercio) of Spanish infantry troops sent to suppress the Revolt in the Low Countries.\n\nWe find the name of Captain Julián very frequently in chronicles and correspondence from his own time, both in Spanish and Netherlandish sources, and remarkably he is generally referred to as simply “Captain Julián” even after he had already been promoted to Maestre de campo. Cardinal Granvelle,2 Governess Margaret of Parma, and even King Philip II all tended to refer to him in their letters solely by his first name. When he was nominated as the new Maestre de campo of the tercio of Sicily, the Viceroy knew the King would perfectly understand whom he meant by “Maestre de campo Julián”.\n\nThe same occurred in Netherlandish literary sources as, even for his sworn enemies, the protestant Beggars, his first name was sufficient. In the famous Beggar song ‘the safe-conduct to hell’ he is scornfully called “our best friend captain Julian”, with the verses wishing him to “the peat-cellar”.5 It was not uncommon for Spanish military men to be addressed simply by their first name, but with Julián Romero the omission of his family name occurred much more frequently. Apparently, he had developed into a special character when he was still a captain and “Captain Julián” turned into a fixed form of identification.\n\nThere is no doubt that Julián himself contributed to a large extent to the creation of his own myth. He must have been an incredibly captivating and gifted storyteller. The famous French author Brantôme (a combination of war correspondent and chronicler of court life) declared that he hung on every word during their walk through the Sicilian harbour of Messina (in August 1565), where the French knight Brantôme had joined the Spanish army to support the liberation of Malta from Ottoman occupation. A few years later he travelled to Lorraine specifically to admire the Spanish army on its passage from Italy to the Low Countries, with Julián as Maestre de campo of the tercio of Sicily. Brantôme praised his eloquence “in the style of soldiers”: never had he heard a soldier speak so well.6\n\nRomero’s fame lived on during the seventeenth century. Historian P.C. Hooft uses him regularly as a speaking protagonist in his Nederlandse Historiën, the unparellelled and magisterial epic on the Revolt, though he is not always as reliable as we would wish. It seems that Hooft uses Romero as a literary figure, who stands out as the prototype of the Spanish military man in the Low Countries, and possibly ascribes to him deeds that may have been the work of others. He even puts dialogues into his mouth to vivify his accounts. The Julián as created by Hooft is a dubious character: a brave warrior, but at the same time a typical Spaniard full of vanity and hypocrisy.\n\nSpanish playwright Lope de Vega considered Julián to be the greatest Spanish hero of his time: “the brave Julián Romero, the bravest Spaniard born in our times”. He may have even dedicated a whole comedy to him, simply called the Comedia famosa de Julián Romero, but there is uncertainty about the attribution. We also find Julián in two other plays by Lope de Vega: “the brave Romero, of whose rare virtues the books are full”.7 In El Buscón (ca. 1605-1608), the picaresque novel by Francisco de Quevedo, Julián Romero is quoted as an exemplary military\n\nhero.\n\nHis remarkable image led to the publication of a voluminous biography in 1952. The author, Antonio Marichalar (1893-1973), Marquis of Montesa, was a complex character: the eternal bachelor, an intellectual dandy surrounded by beautiful and elegant women, a supporter of the Republic in the 1930s, and afterwards a mixture of liberal and conservative. Initially, he tried to enter the international literary avant-garde. His first attempts at writing were received with benevolence by literary masters such as Miguel de Unamuno and José Ortega y Gasset, and Marichalar became the international ambassador of the Spanish literary generation of 1927. He even published an article in T.S. Eliot’s leading journal, Criterion. However, after the Spanish Civil War he decided to switch from literature to history.11 His sizeable book on Romero, of more than five hundred pages, is one of the most prominent fruits of his historical labour.\n\nIn the work of Geoffrey Parker, without any doubt the single most important contemporary historian on the Spanish army in the Low Countries, Captain Julián plays little more than a modest supporting role. In The Dutch Revolt he is not even mentioned at all. In The Army of Flanders and the Spanish Road he is mentioned twice, first in the same sentence as Cristóbal de Mondragón and Francisco Verdugo as examples of career soldiers from the gentry, and on another occasion related to the rewarding of the Spanish military. In the reworked edition of this book, from 2004, Parker adds to this how Captain Julián Romero had lost in battle an eye, an arm and a leg (a correct list of injuries, though he failed to mention the loss of an ear).14 Parker now also mentions the existence of his portrait, and he points out that these three Spanish commanders – the other two being Sancho Dávila and Francisco de Valdés – were officers who, notwithstanding their service of several decades, still had not earned the right to put the title Don in front of their names. That’s it. Also in recent works on the Revolt Captain Julián does not play a significant role.\n\nHow does the Julián from the sixteenth-century chronicles compare to the later hero of Hooft and Lope de Vega? How do Netherlandish and Spanish authors differ from each other? There is even an English Julián. The hero of the 1546 tournament was characterised by Hume in 1896 as a “swashbuckler”. Another English historian, Walsh, described him in 1937 as a “romantic and resourceful fire-eater”.17 The French Julián is mainly the Julián from Brantôme: not only an excellent soldier, but also a very gifted storyteller.\n\nWe have fewer letters from Romero himself, when compared to those from Sancho Dávila, Cristóbal de Mondragón and Francisco de Valdés, but it is still possible to characterise his specific style as testimonies of a very eloquent soldier and somebody who had worked his way up from the lowest echelons of the army to the highest attainable level of commander. His letters are very direct, untainted by any rhetorical or humanist education: he writes as somebody who has learned everything through practice. Though the letters offer the image the hero wanted to show of himself, we also see him struggling with his difficult life in the Spanish military during the Revolt in the Low Countries. In short, there are sufficient sources available for one to produce a sketch that shows him as a military man of flesh and blood, within the context of the continuously changing practices of early modern warfare.\n\nWas Julián the best soldier of his time, as Lope de Vega considered him? Maybe not. “Without downplaying anybody, he is the best soldier His Majesty has in his service”, wrote Alba’s secretary, Juan de Albornoz. However, he was not refering to Julián but to his eternal rival Sancho Dávila, ‘the Lighting Bolt of the war’, who will be studied in the second chapter.18\n\nThe hero of a duel\n\nJulián Romero was born around 1520 in the village of Torrejoncillo del Rey, situated in the hills close to the city of Cuenca in what nowadays is the region of Castilla-La Mancha.19 He was the son of mason and builder Pedro de Ibarrola and Juana Romero. The family lived near the village where Juana had been born and where Pedro had moved to from his native region of Biscay. As all inhabitants of Biscay were considered free burghers, Pedro was counted among the hidalgos. Besides fiscal advantages, this gave him the right to bear a sword and possess a coat of arms. As the story goes, father Pedro is supposed to have died from fatal wounds suffered in a bullfight, a truly fitting death for this father of a ferocious Spanish hero. His mother remarried.\n\nAround Christmas 1534 young Julián decided to join the army. We do not know why he did so. Perhaps he had been impressed by the 1528 visit of Charles V who, with his no doubt very impressive court, had spent the night in Julián’s small village.21 The first ten years of his military career remain completely obscure, until he appears in 1545 in a Spanish chronicle as a mercenary of the King of England. However, his first decade as a soldier can be reconstructed. Around 1534, Charles V was gathering troops to join his large expedition fleet against the pirate base of Tunis, ruled by the feared Barbarossa. In a play about his life Julián is described as a member of this international naval expedition that resulted in a much acclaimed victory by the Emperor. Young Julián could have been one of the boys we find on the famous tapestries by Willem de Pannemaker from Brussels, based on the cartoons by Jan Cornelisz. Vermeyen from Beverwijk, working at Charles’s court in Spain.\n\nIt is more than likely that Julián subsequently remained with the Spanish troops in Piedmont and that he joined the Emperor’s international army when he went to the Low Countries in 1543. Thousands of Spaniards were used in the wars against the Duke of Guelders and the King of France. It was in these years that the Duchy of Guelders finally fell into Habsburg possession. The small city of Düren was completely destroyed during the hostilities; the city went up in flames, and all soldiers and inhabitants without exception were mercilessly killed. At the time this was an unusual form of retribution, and the Duke of Alba in 1572 could perfectly recall the treatment of Düren, even though he had not been present. The harsh treatment of Düren forced the whole of the Duchy of Guelders to surrender unconditionally, and the Duke of Alba expected the same to happen after the ruthless treatment of Zutphen in 1572.22 In November 1544 the Spanish troops were dismissed; they had to board ships near Bruges that would take them back home. The presence of these Spanish soldiers in the Low Countries caused conflicts with the local population, and there are stories reporting plundering and violence.\n\nSeveral ships arrived in the port of Plymouth, and around seven hundred Spanish soldiers entered the service of the English King, Henry VIII. In itself this was not a new phenomenon: King Henry had often used Spanish troops against the Auld Alliance of France and Scotland. In a chronicle on this period, Julián is one of the main protagonists of the story. He finally rises from obscurity as a mercenary in foreign military service.24 In April 1545 Julián went to Newcastle, together with some one thousand other Spaniards under the command of Pedro Gamboa, to fight the Scots. Gamboa was a famous captain who had left home because of a murder he had committed. In 1550 he would himself die at the hand of a murderer. His light cavalry of Spanish and Italian horsemen, armed with arquebuses, played a key role in the war against the Scots. The presence of so many foreign soldiers caused problems in Newcastle. A British chronicler remarked about the foreign garrison\n\nIt was a sad sight to see the ungodly beastly lives they led defiling and corrupting the purity of the girls and women of the town and country until the men of the town rose against them and killed them when any one of them was caught astray.25\n\nJulián survived the vengeance of the population and became a captain under Gamboa. Together they fought the French in 1546, being active in the region between Boulogne-sur-Mer and Calais, fortified towns that had remained in English hands for more than a century after the end of the Hundred Years’ War.26 Here Gamboa came into conflict with another Spanish captain, Cristóbal de Mora, who, after many years in English service, had defected to the French, taking with him some men and sixty brand new muskets.\n\nNear the royal palace at Fontainebleau a closed space was prepared for the duel, and people came from afar to watch. The overwhelming interest even created a run on post horses, and the English envoy made it only just in time. Both Kings were closely involved with the duel, as it also concerned their own honour. Francis I and the future Henry II of France were personally present at the duel which took place on 15 July 1546. The French King even served as judge. This is also the story as Julián personally told it to Brantôme when they saw each other in Sicily. The famous Dutch Hispanist Johan Brouwer dedicated four pages to this legendary duel in his book on Spanish military chronicles related to the Revolt in the Low Countries.29\n\nBoth gamecocks were to fight on horseback, each with a sword, a foil and a dagger. They each had two holes in the back of their armour, each the size of two fists. This way Mora hoped to stab his opponent in the back, as he had a faster horse at his disposal. It turned out to be a very unchivalric encounter, though Mora did throw away his sword after Julián had lost his. Mora’s tactic did not work, so he decided to kill Julián’s horse. At that point Julián also lost his foil, leaving him with no more than a dagger. For three hours Mora circled around Julián, who was hiding behind his dead horse, but Mora was unable to hurt him. Mora continuously shouted to Julián to surrender, but the latter did not utter a word. Dusk had started to fall when Julián cut his spurs and he was able to hurt Mora’s horse. Mora, now on foot, still had his spurs. Julián ran towards him and they fell to the ground. When Julián was able to cut the straps of his opponent’s helmet with his dagger, Mora surrendered.\n\nAccording to the story, during the duel Mora taunted Julián three times, “no te quiero, segnor Juliano” (“I don’t like you, segnor Juliano”), hoping that he would leave his shelter behind his horse. Brantôme states that this Spanish sentence became a popular phrase at the French court every time somebody tried to avoid a confrontation. Brantôme got his story not only directly from Julián, but also from accounts he had heard from much older French noblemen who had been present at the duel. They informed him that the duel had been considered more a joke, a “risée et mocquerie”. At the time, duelling was a noble occupation, even though non-noble military were taking over this custom during the sixteenth century. The opposition between the nobility and officers of low birth can also be found in the Spanish plays of the seventeenth century. But this particular victory had turned Julián into a kind of European cult hero and had given him mighty protectors at both courts.30 Also the people back home in Torrejoncillo heard about the duel.\n\nThere was no disdain or contempt for his low birth directly after the duel. King Francis I and the Dauphin, both fanatical lovers of the manly competition for honour, received Julián in the royal palace. Francis I had challenged his rival, Emperor Charles V, to a duel in 1528, while the Dauphin, after he had become King Henry II of France, would even die from injuries suffered during a tournament, when the lance of the captain of his Scottish guards pierced his eye. Directly after the duel Julián received three portions of meat, served by the King’s own men, watched from nearby by many courtiers. He was also given a heavy gold chain and an expensive golden cloth. Queen Eleanor, Charles V’s eldest sister, received the hero as well, and her ladies-in-waiting arranged for the appropriate entertainment that same evening, although unfortunately we do not know its specific character.32 Julián would also have been awed by the beautiful Renaissance hall that had been finished at Fontainebleau shortly before his visit. Once the soldier returned to England, Henry VIII received him with great honour and granted him a life-long pension of six hundred ducats, though in practice it would be paid for only a few years.\n\nWithout a war going on Julián remained unemployed, hanging around London with fellow Spanish officers and, according to Hume, “quarrelling, gaming, and swaggering”. It seems he enjoyed his unexpected fame a little too much and became seriously in debt, to the point of being afraid of walking the streets. When he was on the brink of being incarcerated for his debts, Julián is said to have started raging against the English King and his Protestantisation of the Church. However, not one witness was found who was willing to testify to Julián saying that he would fight the heretics with a pike on his shoulders. But he had also insulted King Henry and his Royal Council, stating “that he preferred serving somebody else for four ducats than remaining here and earning a treasure”.33 He had to face a charge before the Royal Council and only because of his very influential friends was his punishment limited to a severe reprimand. The story is proof of his privileged position, but also of his turbulent, not to say impetuous, character. And of his failure to resist the pernicious idleness of peacetime.\n\nFortunately for him, war was never far away. After the death of Henry VIII in 1547, his successor, the young King Edward VI, was persuaded by his principal advisor Edward Seymour, the Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector, to start a new war against Scotland. Somerset intended to capture the Scottish Princess Mary to make her marry Edward. His military strategy consisted of the construction of an English pale in Scotland, like the one in Ireland. Control over this territory had to be provided by means of new fortresses, built according to the new style of the Trace Italienne, consisting of low earthen walls with angled corners, capable of resisting cannon fire. Somerset had learned about the new style from the French fortresses during the struggle around Boulogne.34 The French had imported the technique from Italy. Unfortunately, there are very few remains left of these fortresses, like the one on the Eyemouth Peninsula.\n\nDuring this new war Julián served under Peter Mewtys, commander of six hundred Spanish and Italian harquebusiers. It was a cruel war. At the siege of Thornton the defenders did not surrender directly, giving the attackers the right to kill them all. The garrison even pleaded to be executed by hanging. However, the Lord Protector decided to spare their lives. So, long before the massacres of Naarden and Haarlem, Julián had already experienced different ways of treating stubborn defenders in sieges like Düren and Thornton. The heroes of the war against the Scots were the horsemen of Pedro de Gamboa, armed with arquebuses. At the Battle of Pinkie, on 10 September 1547 (since then called Black Saturday), the Scots suffered a tremendous defeat. In the shadow of Gamboa we find Julián playing an important role during the battle, and he was also involved in the burning of nearby Leith.36 The Spanish chronicle of this period states that Julián received a knighthood after the battle, but Hume has not found any documentary evidence of that. We do know that on 28 September Gamboa and a few other Spaniards were knighted for their bravery. The first mention of Julián as a knight dates from 31 January 1549.\n\nIn 1548 many Spaniards in the border area deserted, as they did not want to live in their simple shelters made of peat and branches, unlike the English soldiers who seemingly accepted these mean conditions. The Spaniards wanted at least a tent, but preferably a real house. Another problem was the delay in their payments, which in some cases had fallen behind by seven months. Some of the Spaniards were prompted by these dire circumstances to solve the problem by trying to sell a fortress back to the Scots in order to obtain the money owed to them. We do not know whether Julián was involved in the plan. In the Spring of 1549, fresh Scottish and French troops threatened Julián’s regiment near the border in Jedburgh, but he succeeded in retreating safely to England.37 By that time he commanded a unit of 177 men, the equivalent of an infantry banner in the Spanish army. Julián and his men were also used to ending the farmers’ revolts taking place in England, and he may even have been active in Ireland, as somebody stated in 1574 that he had known Romero when he had still been a poor captain in Ireland.\n\nIn the service of the old Emperor\n\nIn 1552 Julián entered the service of Charles V for a second time, on the brink of a new series of wars between the Habsburgs and France. The fighting would be interrupted by a brief ceasefire in 1556 and then continue until the Peace of Câteau-Cambrésis in 1559 put an end to this very long and intensely violent war. In 1553 imperial troops totally wiped Thérouanne and Hesdin from the face of the earth, while a year later the French ravaged Binche, Mariemont, Bouvignes and Dinant.\n\nThe resumption of the war drew more Spanish troops to the Low Countries. Charles V had originally planned to bring six thousand fresh Spanish soldiers by sea, but experience had taught him that inexperienced soldiers from Spain did not survive well in the Low Countries. Besides, the arrival of such a large number of Spanish soldiers would raise suspicion and anxiety among the inhabitants. Therefore, the new recruits were sent to Italy, and experienced soldiers had to reach the Low Countries from Italy overland. It was a system that would be maintained during the years of the Revolt, and has been described as ‘the Spanish Road’.39\n\nIn order to assist at the Siege of Metz in the Summer of 1552, 5,600 Spanish troops had already crossed the Alps via the Brenner Pass.40 The famed siege ended in a major failure, and Charles V’s immense army had to remain in the north for the Winter. Some three thousand Spaniards lived for three months in Cambrai, accumulating large debts to the inhabitants and finally even starting a mutiny. They chased their officers from the city and chose their own leader, as would happen in subsequent mutinies during the Revolt. Other Spaniards even decided to go over to the French, becoming spies in Brussels. Chronicler Louis Brésin, originally from that region, complained about the terrible behaviour of the Spanish soldiers. The inhabitants could not walk the streets in safety, and they had lost control over their own homes.\n\nThis almost one-thousand-year-old city, see of the Bishop, would become the first victim of the renewed war between France and the Habsburgs. The bishopric fell under the French Crown, and as such it remained a hostile enclave within the County of Artois, which had been completely severed from France in 1526. There is a description of the fighting written by the father of one of Julián’s most loyal servants, Cristóbal Vázquez de Ávila. According to his own father, young Cristóbal, aged around eleven at the time, had been present at the attack at such an early age.42 Cristóbal’s presence is the only clue to Julián’s involvement in the attack. Charles V had united an enormous army, though we must always be careful not to take the numbers given by the chroniclers too literally. Brésin speaks of 1,500 Spanish light horsemen and twenty-four banners of Spanish infantry. Even if we assume the banners were no larger than two hundred men, there must have been more than six thousand Spaniards around Thérouanne. Spanish historian Sepúlveda even mentions a total of 7,500 Spaniards within an army of thirty thousand. On 11 June 1553 a first massive attack by the Spaniards did not succeed in penetrating the city’s still mainly medieval fortifications. In the end, the city fell into imperial hands by 20 June, to be completely erased from the face of the earth: the destruction included the thirteenth-century gothic cathedral, two parish churches and several abbeys and convents.\n\nThe small fortified city of Hesdin in Artois would change overlord seven times between 1477 and 1553. A Spaniard in the army camp in front of Hesdin wrote to his wife in Zamora that there were too few Spanish soldiers in the huge imperial army which was made up of thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry, “It is detrimental that there are no more than 4,000 Spaniards; if we were to have another 4,000, or even 1,000 fewer, they alone would suffice to give battle”.44 History seems to have proven this bragging letter-writer right, as the odds for success on the battlefield changed with the arrival of another three hundred Spanish arquebusiers. It is very possible that the sources are referring to the 330 Spanish arquebusiers under Julián’s command that were active around Saint-Omer a little earlier. The attack on the citadel of Hesdin lasted an impressive sixty hours, killing some seventy Spaniards. Hesdin was completely dismantled and abandoned. A few miles further on a new citadel was built. Given the name of ‘Nouvel-Hesdin’, it followed the design of the new Italian art of fortification.\n\nRomero’s last feat of arms under Emperor Charles V was the defence of Dinant in 1554.46 This city belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, at the time an imperial ally, as the governing Prince-Bishop was George of Austria, a natural son of Emperor Maximilian I, Charles’s grandfather. Julián was ordered to support the defenders against the French siege. He succeeded in resisting the French attacks four times, but by 11 July capitulation had become inevitable. In 1610 a witness, who was over a hundred years old, still remembered the fighting. He described a deceptive trick by ‘Julien Omere’ who deluded the French into believing that the castle had already been abandoned. When the French arrived at the top of the castle and shouted victory, “chasteau gaigné”, the defenders appeared from their hiding places shouting “Espaigne” and thus fending off another attack.\n\nMy Lord, if it be true, that there are no better judges of any art than the artist himself, and since there’s no lord or captain that has better handled, or more practised arms than your Excellency, I hope you will this day favour the cause of arms to the utmost of your power, with regard to us Spanish soldiers, by treating us not as vanquish’ed men, but according to our valour and courage; which, for my own particular, I chose, some years ago, at Fontainbleau in presence of King Francis, to trust to the doubtful chance of single combat, rather than suffer any deshonour or affront; cherishing my honour more than my blood, or my life, which I have always chearfully employed in so many thousand dangers, passing and repassing so many seas and lands, purely to gain glory and renown; where in fortune, a friend to the brave and the bold, has so much favour’d me, that I can reckon myself among those who have gain’d something by their efforts and their prowess, which is to me the Summum Bonum, the supreme happiness in which I hug and applaud myself; arms being the superstructure of all I have and the foundation of all I have not; and the preservation and keeping of those arms more dear to me than all things. If I must lose them, may the whole world despise me; and if such a misfortune shou’d happen, en we shou’d be forc’d to abandon them, we rather chuse, every man of us, like men in despair, if the oars fail us, to help ourselves with the sails, and fight\n\ntill we die…\n\nJulián more or less demanded to be allowed to leave without leaving any weapons behind. These haughty words spoken by Julián were not well received by Montmorency. He was surprised that the defeated tried to impose a new kind of law of war on the victors. If Julián did not surrender the castle very soon the French would attack, and if he did not die by the sword he would be hanged. The stubborn Spaniard still did not give up, and tried to organise an honourable retreat just for himself and twelve of his men. Clever Montmorency, however, had informed the defenders in the meantime that their commander had already surrendered, so they followed what they erroneously believed to be his example. French chronicler François de Rabutin characterised Julián’s behaviour towards Montmorency as “la façon espagnolle, faisant grandes exclamations”.50\n\nJulián was captured by Jean d’Estrée, Henry II’s artillery master. The ensuing negotiations on the liberation of prisoners seemed endless and laborious, finally resulting in a five-year truce, agreed on in the Abbey of Vaucelles (in Hainaut) on 6 February 1556. All prisoners could be bought free for the price of their yearly income. Commissioners went out to collect the necessary information. Only the three most important prisoners were excluded from the deal, among them the son of the Connétable and the Duke of Aarschot.51 It would take a long time for Romero to regain his freedom. Only by October 1556, more than two years after the fall of Dinant, did his release seem imminent. As D’Estrée still had to pay 4,000 écus for the liberation of his own son, he offered to pay a further 2,000 together with the liberation of “ledict conte d’Arc, Juliain et Rogrofz”. Habsburg ambassador Simon Renard expressly pointed out to his new King, Philip II, the value of the count, a ‘gentilhomme’ of the court, and it seems that Julián was nothing more than small change. The letter shows, however, that Philip II needed no more than his first name to know with whom he was dealing. By this time, Charles V had abdicated in Brussels and been succeeded by his son, Philip II, born in Valladolid in 1527.\n\nPhilibert of Savoy, Governor-general of the Low Countries, informed Renard two weeks later that he wanted to hold on to the 4,000 écus for Estrée’s son, and with it the three men, but “however, if this is not in any way possible, you should stop precisely at three thousand”.52 We do not know exactly when Julián was liberated, but in the Summer of 1557 he was again active in the resumed war against the French.\n\nIt is possible that Romero did not await the end of the complicated bargaining. According to one story, D’Estrée had wanted to take him to Laon, and during that journey Julián succeeded in escaping with the assistance of a beautiful twenty-five-year-old woman from Bouvignes who had fallen for his charms. Together they returned to Bouvignes, completely burned down by the French, and to her husband.53 It is possible that the woman in question herself told this to the anonymous chronicler who wrote down the story, but more evidence concerning this anecdote is yet to be found. When the Duke of Aarschot, Philip of Croy, escaped from the castle of Vincennes on 10 May 1556, the French complained of this deed, as the Duke had broken his word of honour by escaping.\n\nEven without taking his escape and his spying servant into consideration, it is clear that Julián was again an ambiguous hero in Dinant. His honour seems to have been greater than his sense of reality. However, the anecdote featuring Montmorency and Julián again added to his fame. He did receive a critical remark from chronicler Prudencio de Sandoval in his famous history of Charles V. According to the Spanish historian, the fall of Dinant had been caused by Julián’s incompetence; “seldom do bravery and prudence reside within the same person, although later this captain demonstrated that he possessed them both, as he was one of the famous men of our time”.56 There exists another Spanish description of the fighting around Dinant in which Julián serves as a classical Spanish hero who courageously entered the city after a bloody confrontation. He lost 170 men, who were killed, wounded or had been taken prisoner. However, the remaining 170 succeeded in entering the city and killed and wounded some 2,500 enemies. In this story, even the enemies praised his bravery. During the siege another seventy of his men died, leaving only some one hundred men out of the original 340.\n\nIn the service of the young King\n\nHostilities in the frontier region between France and the Low Countries started again after January 1557, as the ceasefire of Vaucelles had lasted less than a year. There were attacks from both sides. French Admiral Gaspar de Coligny tried in vain to occupy the ciy of Douai, while the army of the new King Philip II launched an unsuccessful attack on Rocroi. After Coligny had taken the small Artesian town of Lens and burned it to the ground, the Governor-general of the Low Countries, Philibert of Savoy, began a large counter-offensive. On 2 August his troops appeared before the walls of the strategically situated Saint-Quentin. The siege would last until 27 August, but the famous battle took place on 10 August, Saint Lawrence’s Day. In the library of the royal palace in El Escorial, dedicated to the same saint and directly related to the battle, there is an extensive manuscript on the battle and the siege of Saint-Quentin. The first Spaniard to be mentioned in this text is Captain Julián. He was one of the two people that had been able to convince the King to attack Saint-Quentin. It shows that although he was merely a captain of a banner of some 170 soldiers, he played an important role as a military advisor. Julián was also directly involved in the first attack on the town’s outskirts, and after taking possession of this suburb he received the order to organise its defence. His position is indicated in a popular engraving of the siege which even includes his name. In the manuscript text Julián happily offers to defend the Duke of Savoy’s position against the whole army of the King of France. We recognise his already well-known rhetorical use of grand gestures.58 From his outpost Julián successfully bombarded the town, but sometimes this went wrong, as on the day a cannonball landed in their own trenches, killing five Spaniards. He would suffer a leg wound while commanding a joint attack by Spanish and English troops, and it seems obvious that his long career in English service had made him especially qualified for this command.\n\nThe Battle of Saint-Quentin was the result of a French attempt to get a large relief army into the town. However, the plan was discovered, and the Duke’s cavalry succeeded in destroying a large part of the French army, taking many prisoners. Count Lamoral of Egmont, the commander of 1,200 light horsemen from Spain, Italy and the Low Countries, played a heroic part in the battle, and this would add greatly to his fame as a military hero. Among the prisoners was the Spanish Captain Carvajal, who was fighting on the side of the French. Carvajal had fled from the Habsburg army under suspicion of sodomy, but Julián defended him as they had been good friends in the past. Admiral Coligny and Connétable Montmorency were also taken prisoner, which meant that Julián could again meet the man who had defeated him at Dinant.\n\nThe storming of Saint-Quentin led to the brutal sacking of the town, with King Philip trying to protect only the possessions of the Church. In the manuscript Julián is clearly seen as one of the most important heroes of Saint-Quentin, his name being connected with one of the greatest victories of the Habsburg army in the sixteenth century. Though being a simple captain of a banner of infantry soldiers, he was already functioning as an important military commander. In 1560 news of his deeds in Saint-Quentin also reached his home village of Torrejoncillo.59\n\nIn recent years, the battle and siege of Saint-Quentin have inspired two Spanish historical novels. In 2005 Juan Carlos Losado decided to take the Count of Egmont as his main protagonist, while in 2019 José Javier Esparza put a martial Julián Romero on the front cover.60 Losado devotes several pages to a biographical description of Julián as “one of the most famous adventurers of the sixteenth century”, also calling him a mythical figure. The author, however, refuses to accept Romero’s role in the decision-making process around Saint-Quentin: “cosa absolutamente imposible”, but at the same time he is much too positive about his behaviour: “never were any unworthy deeds known of him, nor attempts to take somebody else’s property or commit cruelty against civilians”. The novelist also offers us a very romantic picture of his Nachleben: “during many years, thousands of blind men and comedians recited romances and songs around all villages praising his heroic deeds”.\n\nAfter Saint-Quentin we find Romero in Guînes, a small fortified town that had been in English hands since 1352. And again he was fighting alongside the English against the French. Philip had sent him with a few dozen Spaniards to protect this strategically important town. After a brave defence – we even have a description of the fighting in Romero’s own hand – he had to yield the town to the French.63 In the following period we find Julián involved in the taking of Ham and the Battle of Gravelines. During this last battle, Egmont was again one of the acclaimed heroes. We do not know whether Julián was involved in the violent confrontations between Spanish troops and the inhabitants of the city of Arras in 1558, when several Spaniards were killed during an affray.\n\nAfter the signing in 1559 of the Peace of Câteau-Cambrésis, King Philip decided to leave 3,200 Spanish soldiers to defend the Low Countries, as history had taught him that peace with France could be very brief. Captains Pedro de Mendoza and Julián Romero would command the sixteen banners of Spaniards, but in order to avoid complaints about these foreign troops Mendoza would officially serve under Egmont and Julián under William of Orange. In the preserved correspondence between Julián and Orange we can read about the difficult position these Spanish troops found themselves in: problems with discipline, the hatred of the local population, problems with the payment of wages, and the complicated organisation of their return to Spain. Soldiers who misbehaved were severely punished, but Romero also complained about the local population: “the inhabitants of these villages are so bad that they don’t want to bring us anything”.65 During this period Romero spent most of his time in Damvillers in the Duchy of Luxembourg, as he had in 1559 been appointed governor of its citadel. In 1561 he served for a short while as governor of the citadel of Douai, but by then he was already on his way to Spain.\n\nThe letters exchanged between Romero and Orange demonstrate the existence of a clientele relationship between the two men, as Julián was clearly writing as the submissive client of a high nobleman. When Julián wanted to take his leave of his patron the Prince, Orange had just left for Germany, but not without leaving a valuable chain with one of his noblemen who had to hand it over to Julián. In a letter Julián thanked the Prince for the gift, kissing his hands a thousand times, a well-known Spanish expression of gratitude. In a more general expression he also wrote that it had not been at all necessary as he would keep serving the Prince in the same manner, with or without gifts.68\n\nOn 22 October 1560, Romero was already in Zeeland, prepared to board ship with his soldiers. From there he wrote another short note to Orange to ask him to take into his service a Spanish soldier who for specific reasons could not return to Spain: “although I know it hurts your lordship to give it to him as he is a foreigner, I dare to ask you, being such a servant of your lordship”.69\n\nBoth Spanish captains were praised by Governess Margaret of Parma for their exemplary behaviour. They had remained on their ships to speed up the departure, even though life on board had been very uncomfortable. Her praise may have been influenced by the fact that Charles de Tisnacq in Toledo had heard that Romero was not very well at the time:\n\n“I understand that captain Julian who is at Cádiz (Cales) has fallen into a frenzy of fantasy and melancholy (as one says), I hope God will give him enlightenment”.70 Was his depression the result of the long wait in the harbour? We already know from ten years earlier in London that periods of waiting and forced idleness were a greater threat to Romero’s health than the worst conditions of war.\n\nWhatever the precise circumstances, in January 1561 Romero arrived in Lisbon, and from there he travelled to Toledo, and further in the direction of Malaga, to board ship with three banners of soldiers that he had taken with him from the Low Countries. He then stayed until at least January 1562 in the fortress of La Goleta near Tunis, the same region where his military career may have started in 1535. The region was confronted with a new struggle between Spain and the Ottoman sultan. During these Mediterranean years Romero sometimes wrote letters to Orange, for example about personal information such as the wound to his leg: – “I have been very close to death” – and about a visit by the Prince’s servants to Julián’s house in Brussels where his natural children lived with their mother.71 On that subject he had also written to Granvelle from Lisbon and Toledo. He had asked Granvelle to take care of his family in the Low Countries. His companion was pregnant again, and he feared he would not be able to return to the Low Countries before the child was born. If that happened Granvelle was to appoint godparents for the child. A few weeks later it became clear that he would indeed not be\n\nable to make it in time for the birth of his third Netherlandish child:\n\n“I am going so far away that I cannot make it”.\n\nIn another letter to Orange, he again recommended another Spanish friend, asking for him to be given a place among the Prince’s troops. He also informed Orange about the peace with the King of Tunis, whom he did not trust at all. On 8 October 1562 he wrote to Orange from Madrid, the last letter we have from this period. He had by then stayed for eight days at the royal court in Madrid, to meet Philip II – who had arrived there a year previously – and to ask him for financial compensation for his deeds. Romero called it with a certain sense of understatement “asking to get food” (“dar de comer”).73 Mondragón would use the same phrase in one of his letters. It shows that the mythical military hero perfectly realised that in order to receive new sources of income one had to go to the King in person. During this period he also visited his relatives in the villages around Cuenca.\n\nBy this time Julián’s career was quite successful. The King showed his confidence in him by sending him with a thousand men to Ibiza in 1563 to organise the fortifications. At that time the island found itself in the firing line between Philip II and the Ottomans, who were contesting the hegemony of the Mediterranean.75 He cannot have remained long on the island as we find him on 30 July 1564 getting married in Madrid to María Gaytán, the only daughter of Captain Pedro Gaytán and the rich Catalina de Vitoria y Zárate.\n\nHis star would rise even higher. In the same year, 1565, he was sent to Sicily to support García de Toledo, the Viceroy of Sicily, with the relief of Malta, which was being besieged by Ottoman troops. When, on 12 August, Melchor de Robles, the Maestre de campo of the tercio of Sicily, died after being shot when he was looking over the parapet without his helmet on, Julián was appointed his successor.77 In the correspondence between the Viceroy and Philip II on the new appointment, the first spoke about “Maestre de campo Julián”, while the King simply referred to “Julián”.\n\nDuring this period he also met Brantôme. When Romero arrived in Messina with the Spanish galleys he heard about the presence of several French knights who wanted to join the fight against the Ottomans. As “très-courtois cavallier”, Julián went to salute them, and as Brantôme was the only one who spoke decent Spanish, they entered into a conversation. Brantôme may have forgotten in his writings that Romero must have spoken French as well! Julián inquired about the wellbeing of the connétable, and he recounted his adventures to the Frenchman. He did this particularly well, “with the most beautiful words of the world, better spoken than I have ever heard, as is he very eloquent à la soldade”.80 The walk around the port of Messina is a key moment in Julián’s history: here merge together the real Romero of flesh and blood and the fictional hero of the chronicles. Here merge his extraordinary deeds on the battlefield and his remarkable and bold soldier’s tales. At the same time, a fairytale was unfolding: the soldier from humble origins had made it all the way to the top, becoming commander of one of the four large Spanish tercios in Italy.\n\nThe Prince of Orange’s dog\n\nThe joy over the relief of Malta was still being savoured in Philip II’s chambers when the first news letters about the iconoclastic fury in the Low Countries started piling up on his desk. In this sense, the war against the Protestants seamlessly followed the crusade against the Ottomans. And the King would also make use of some of the same Spanish soldiers. The iconoclastic fury brought the Low Countries back to the centre of his attention, and Philip II must have remembered his years in the north and the endless and harsh wars against the French. Soldiers like Julián Romero had also experienced those wars.\n\nThe Spanish and Italian soldiers who would leave for the Low Countries in 1567 were placed under the command of the Duke of Alba, a high nobleman born in 1507 and the most experienced general in the King’s service. He had fought all over Europe and had frequently been in the Low Countries, though strangely enough he had never actively participated in the great battles against France and the Duchy of Guelders.81 Julián and Alba most certainly knew each other, but there were no close ties between them, such as those we shall witness later with Francisco de Valdés, Cristóbal de Mondragón and, most of all, Sancho Dávila. Through the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, who had been involved in Julián’s appointment as Maestre de campo, there was a connection with the Alba family, as García was a cousin of the Duke.\n\nJulián had already become a famous hero before travelling with the Duke of Alba to the Low Countries. His great fame was the result of his duel at Fontainebleau and his heroic deeds in the wars against the French. Everybody knew who Captain Julián was, at the courts of France and England, but also in Brussels and Madrid. And they must all have had quite similar ideas about the man, as a brave and dashing soldier who had earned his promotions by his sword. It is this image we shall also find later on in seventeenth-century plays. It must have given Romero special status within Alba’s large army: he was more than just the commander of a tercio; he was an authentic Spanish war hero.\n\nThe Revolt in the Low Countries offered the opportunity for new heroic deeds, but Julián and his myth became stuck between the conflicting parties. At the beginning of the conflict, the inhabitants of the Low Countries still had respect for the hero of Saint-Quentin, but later on he was turned into the personification of the much-feared Spanish soldier, as we see, for example, in the Nederlandse Historiën, written in the seventeenth century by Calvinist author P.C. Hooft. He became the focus of war propaganda on both sides, a war hero for one and a war criminal for the other. His image also became much more defined. Already in 1567 it was clear that Julián was above all a man skilled in the practical sides of warfare, but who could get into trouble for his obstinate actions. During the struggle in the Low Countries, Romero became caught in the snake-pit of Habsburg politics. As we have many more sources for this period of his life, we see even more clearly how Julián was more than just the unselfish hero that authors would make him from the seventeenth century on.\n\nThe army that arrived in the Low Countries under Alba’s command consisted of four Spanish infantry tercios. Romero headed the tercio of Sicily, Sancho de Londoño was the Maestre de campo of the tercio of Lombardy, Gonzalo de Bracamonte Dávila was commander of the tercio of Sardinia, and finally Alonso de Ulloa led the tercio of Naples. Furthermore, the Italian Giovanluigi (Chiappino) Vitelli served as Maestre de campo general of the infantry and as artillery general, while Fernando de Toledo, Alba’s natural son, served as general of the cavalry. This army of ten thousand men consisted of 8,795 infantry soldiers, divided among 49 banners, and some 1,200 horsemen.82 On 16 June, Romero wrote from Livorno to Juan de Albornoz, the Duke of Alba’s personal secretary, discussing payment for the troops.\n\nIn order to keep all Spanish soldiers close to him, Alba decided to quarter them in Ghent (tercio of Naples), Lier (tercio of Lombardy), Enghien (tercio of Sardinia) and Brussels (tercio of Sicily), while the cavalry would remain in the vicinity of Diest. Romero’s tercio consisted of ten banners, 1,641 men when they left Lombardy, and, as said, they remained in Brussels, where he possibly still had his own house where his children lived, perhaps even still with their mother. The youngest child had survived the risky first years of his life, and this now six-year-old saw his Spanish father for the first time, even though this father was now also lawfully married in Spain. It seems that Romero sincerely tried to keep the peace between the inhabitants of Brussels and the soldiers, and when they left the city he also tried to treat the population honourably. In a letter to secretary Albornoz he informed him that his tercio had spent 6,000 ducats on food, weapons, pharmacists, doctors and the washing of shirts. Most of it had been directly paid back to the inhabitants with the payments worth almost 8,500 the soldiers had received. The burghers were very satisfied, though there was still a debt of some 5,000 ducats for goods bought by the Spanish soldiers. Romero was also very strict regarding soldiers violating the rules. Just before he left Brussels, several thieves and murderers among his men were convicted and sentenced to death or were sent to the galleys.85\n\nOn 9 September, Count Lamoral of Egmont was arrested in Brussels for his role in the disturbances during the past years. The night before his arrest, a masked Spaniard is said to have visited his palace in order to warn him about his impending apprehension. Egmont’s widow, Sabine of Bayern, later said she thought it had been Julián Romero who had come to warn his old comrade-in-arms.86 What we do know for sure is that Romero again played a role during the last day of Egmont’s life, on 5 June 1568. Together with Captain Salinas he commanded a large Spanish force that had to safeguard the place of execution, the Grand Place of Brussels. Though most sources indeed put Romero on the spot, close to the scaffold, some authors, such as Emanuel van Meteren and P.C. Hooft, make his role even bigger. In the former’s version the Count asked Romero “if there was no mercy, and he shrugged his shoulders and responded with a no”. Hooft copied this part but added “with a no, as if he pitied him”. These authors connected the event in 1567 with the old military relationship between Romero and Egmont they were clearly aware of. Van Meteren also mentions in his work Julián’s important role at Saint-Quentin where he and Egmont had gained fame and\n\nhonour.\n\nA Spanish manuscript newsletter reports another short discussion between Egmont and Julián, which took place just before the walk to the scaffold: “He [Egmont] begged Julián to cut the collar of his doublet and his shirt, so the executioner would not find any resistance”. After this was done the count asked to be allowed to close a button of the long robe he was wearing in order not to have an open neck. He promised to undo it as soon as he reached the scaffold. When Romero told him he could not do this because his hands would be tied, Egmont begged him to leave his hands untied, giving his word as a knight that he would remain calm.88 As most descriptions of the execution describe the count as having his hands free, it seems the Spanish did decide to honour the count’s last request.\n\nDuring this period Julián was also involved in several military encounters with the rebels. Strangely enough, Spanish military commander, diplomat, and chronicler Bernardino de Mendoza does mention Romero in his work, but without casting him as an oustanding hero. Hooft, on the other hand, again turns Romero into an important character, both at the siege of Mons in Hainaut and at the Battle of Jemmingen (Jemgum) in East Frisia. He was also a member of Alba’s army which afterwards pursued Orange and his troops until the rebellious nobleman had no more money left to pay his soldiers and had to disband his army. The most memorable deed we can find took place around Sint-Truiden, when Romero’s arm was wounded by an arquebus shot, and he had to recover in Maastricht. We could say that this first phase of the Revolt passed without great heroic deeds on Romero’s part. He simply did his job as a commander of one of the Spanish tercios.91\n\nHowever, we do find our very familiar Julián – the legendary Spanish storyteller – in an anecdote from Granvelle’s confidant, Maximilien Morillon. According to Morillon, Romero had brought some two hundred oxen and cows back from East Frisia after the Battle of Jemmingen. He had heard this personally from Romero himself, and he seemed as impressed by Captain Julián’s rousing soldier’s stories as Brantôme had been. The anecdote also gives us an insight into the daily reality of war, with the stealing of cattle as a legitimate action:\n\nIt was beautiful to hear him speak about the indeed miraculous defeat … this captain told that nine men could chase six hundred, and maintaining that no one from our camp ever saw the face of an enemy, except when they fell over dead.92\n\nFrom December 1568 Romero was quartered in Mechelen with five banners of his tercio, and together with Captain Osorio he lived in the house of the Lord of Berlo in the Grain Market. The city paid for twelve pieces of tapestry and ten beds with bedding. His troops also received money, housing and other supplies from the local population. Though Romero made the city pay less than Alba had wanted him to do, relations with the burghers must have been complicated. For example, there were complaints about the behaviour of one Captain Juan de Salazar. In an anti-Spanish pamphlet dated long after their stay in the city, the author cited the behaviour of the soldiers of the tercio of Sicily in Mechelen as a main reason for the later refusal to let royal troops into the city. The Spaniards had\n\nmore from premeditated cruelty and evil plans than from anything else, spoiled the furniture of the mentioned burghers, broken and taken it, and by provoking and shouting in all kinds of ways, even threatening, throwing and chasing them out of their houses, and even murderously killing them.\n\nThey had also “raped some honest women and young daughters, violated and brought to shame”, even committing nasty deeds with girls from the ages of six and seven. According to the pamphlet, the soldiers were hardly punished for their deeds, and unfortunately we do not know whether Julián in Mechelen had deviated from his normal behaviour by failing to treat harshly any misconduct by his soldiers.93\n\nMost sources agree that Julián left the Low Countries in 1570 with the fleet that would take Anne of Austria to Spain. Emperor Maximilian II’s daughter boarded ship in Zeeland on 25 September 1570 to marry Philip II, her father’s cousin but also her own mother’s brother. The Duke of Alba gave Romero a letter of recommendation to take with him in order to secure royal favour: “I do not wish to explain… everything Maestre de campo Julián Romero has served His Majesty and the Emperor, our lord who rests in peace, as this is known to everybody (todo el mundo)”.94 Again we find a reference to the international fame Julián had already achieved. The Revolt in the Low Countries had been crushed and Alba could spare his important officer for some time.\n\nDuring his journey to Spain Julián again became part of a new myth. According to rumours Philip II was organising an invasion of Ireland and Romero played a part in the story. We find this idea in the correspondence of the English ambassadors, though Alba wrote that he did not believe a word of it.95 But it was true that one Thomas Stukeley had landed in Spain and had invited the King to invade Ireland. He would need one thousand Spanish troops, but if the King gave him Julián as their commander five hundred would be sufficient. It shows that his name and fame had not been forgotten by the English.\n\nIn Spain, Romero was ordered to organise a new regiment consisting of six banners, with 1,600 soldiers in total, that would travel to the Low Countries with the new Governor-general, Juan de la Cerda, the Duke of Medinaceli. It appears that the English had feared that this armada would sail in the direction of Ireland. The new soldiers had to be experienced, as Romero was asked not to hire “boys or useless men”. The boarding of the ships in Laredo went far from smoothly, and Romero had also to be urged regularly to be prepared for sailing. The Royal Council even investigated whether he should be punished for abandoning his troops without permission. According to several witnesses, he had gone to Biscay, where he was received in his father’s ancestral region with celebrations and bullfights to honour their famous local hero. Directly after reaching Spain he must have travelled to Madrid, as his daughter would be baptised in the church of San Ginés on 29 May 1571.98 This last date raises the suspicion that Romero might have travelled from the Low Countries ahead of the royal party, not having waited for the new Queen Anne of Austria who embarked on 25 September 1570. Between her arrival in Santander in early October (on 4 or 7 October) and the baptism of Julián’s daughter less than eight months had elapsed.\n\nThe first letters on the troops’ embarcation date from April 1571, but in December Julián was still waiting to board ship, hopefully within a few days.99 Finally, Alba’s designated successor as Governor-general would sail only on 30 April 1572 and arrive in the Low Countries on 10 June.\n\nSeveral reasons can be given for the resumption of the Revolt, but it is clear that the Duke of Alba’s government was at least partially responsible for the dissatisfaction of many inhabitants of the Low Countries. The Tenth Penny, a tax on merchandise, had been introduced without the agreement of the Estates-General, and the quartering of foreign soldiers had already lasted for five years. Though they had been sent to defend the inhabitants of the Low Countries against the rebels, these much-criticised Spanish soldiers had become an important cause of the continuation of the very Revolt they had been suppressing.102\n\nIn a long letter to royal secretary Gabriel de Zayas, closely connected to the Duke of Alba, Julián extensively described the journey and the welcome they had received in the Low Countries, apologising for his verbose letter.103 Even ten sheets of paper had not been enough. It was\n\nalso a very frank letter in which he expressed his concern about the situation. He had been gone for almost two years and much had changed during that time. During the fleet’s difficult arrival, navigating between dangerous sandbanks and enemies, he had also received a wound to his leg. They were received first in Ghent and afterwards in Brussels and, according to Romero, their welcome had been very enthusiastic:\n\nIt is certain, and frightening, the joy and the receptions that were held in all territories to celebrate the arrival of the Count of Medina[celi] as they think that their remedy has now arrived… All the roads we passed through and all the cities were so full of people who wanted to see us that it is impossible to believe.\n\nThis joy was not the result of a great love for the Spaniards:\n\nThe detestation they have for the name of the house of Alba is so great that it is impossible to believe, and neither can it be put into words or be exagerated. Your honour knows how the people in this land are, that if they have been convinced of something, they all follow suit.\n\nThis combination of gullibility and stubbornness as characteristics of the inhabitants of the Low Countries can be found in many Spanish chronicles on the Revolt.104 Julián understood the essence of the problem:\n\nHow bad are the Tenth Penny and the one who invented it, as it is the origin of all this, and this they [the inhabitants of the Low Contries] said out loud in public; and it was very negligent to invent this Penny without having prepared the troops and without everything secured; it was said on the streets that people already knew about this revolt for six months, and even the children spoke of it.\n\nAlmost directly after his arrival Julián travelled from Brussels to Mons in Hainaut to join the besiegers of this city, as on 24 May Mons had joined the Revolt. According to Welsh soldier and chronicler Roger Williams, Julián led the failed attacks on a breach in the city walls and “escaped with great danger”. During the battle at nearby Quiévrain, Julián once again excelled. The royal army succeeded in intercepting a relief army of six thousand Frenchmen.105 Together with a group of some two hundred arquebusiers he was the first to make contact with the enemy; Romero was clearly not a commander who watched battles from a distance. Notwithstanding, he wanted to become more than just a fighter. A few weeks after Quiévrain he reminded the King in a letter of his earlier request to become an official member of the Council of War. The always very cautious King Philip back in Spain had given him his usual answer, replying that he would look into it. Romero had been allowed occasionally to join the Council’s meetings, but now he desired a proper seat, which would allow him really to give his opinions on the war. For the time being, he could only offer his opinions in his letters, like the one to Zayas of 3 August:\n\nHolland is still as much in ruins as before, and Frisia is in no better state, and Zeeland even worse. But this means nothing compared to Mons, that feels like it has pierced my heart, because if we can fill this hole at the frontier, everything else is like thin air. Even though we will have to sweat if we have to camp there during this winter, as this will have to be with skates on.106\n\nHis hopes were soon to be fulfilled. That very same night the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew’s Eve took place in Paris and with it in one blow the threat of Protestant support for the rebels from France disappeared. There was, however, still a large relief army of some twenty thousand men on the way to Mons, headed by the Prince of Orange. On 11 September the two armies were camped very near to each other and Julián was sent to attack the army camp in the middle of the night. According to Hooft, Julián had with him some three thousand men during this camisade, all wearing white shirts so as to be able to recognise each other in\n\nthe dark:\n\nSubsequently, Julián thrusts himself in with no less violence and after knocking down all the guards he encounters on his way he reaches the place of arms in front of the prince’s tent, so swiftly that even those of the guard had not been alarmed before seeing their own soldiers fleeing with the enemy close behind them. Afterwards, the prince often called himself lucky for the loyalty of a dog that had started to whine through the noise, then had jumped upon his face and had scratched him awake, before any of his followers had woken up. And ever since, until the day he died, he always kept the offspring of this dog as his watchdog, while his servants also had to take care of several of these dogs. Without the vigilance of this animal, he would have been taken prisoner.107\n\nHooft is here following the description by Roger Williams, who in early 1574 would enter into Julián’s service. This Welsh adventurer had since 1572 served with William of Orange, together with the English company of Thomas Morgan, but when these men returned to England after a conflict Williams decided to stay and joined Romero’s troops. The Spanish commander was not just an enemy, as Romero had been fighting in Saint-Quentin together with Williams’s old protector, Count Pembroke. The Spanish commander highly praised the deceased English Count, creating a connection between Romero and Williams. The fact that Hooft often makes use of Williams’s chronicle may partly explain why Romero is such a prominent protagonist in Hooft’s work. The Dutch author seems to have chosen him as a Spanish protagonist in order to give his Historiën colour and life. Williams, of course, also knew the Prince of Orange personally, and he had often heard the story of the dog that saved his life from Orange himself.\n\nAccording to chronicler Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spaniards stayed for over an hour in the enemy camp and left behind some three hundred dead rebels, as well as sixty men from their own ranks. However, in his chronicle we do not read anything about the dog or the possibility of capturing Orange. It seems the Spanish had not realised at the time how close they had been to capturing their most dangerous enemy.108\n\nTwo days later Alba applauded this nocturnal massacre of the enemy in a letter to the King. The Duke of Medinaceli did the same, and in his words we hear even more praise for Julián:\n\nMaestre de campo Julián acted in such a manner that Your Majesty has with him a marvellous soldier and a great executor of war, that even if he would let me wait again in Laredo – and I don’t say hours but ten years – I would forgive him and would share my cape with him.\n\nPhilip II replied to Medinaceli with great praise for Romero, and a large reward seemed to be only a question of time:\n\nAlthough the will and intentions with which Julián Romero serves me are more than enough proven by his deeds, your approval and that of the Duke will put him even more into my consideration.109\n\nThe Duke of Alba’s hangman\n\nAt the surrender of Mons on 19 September 1572, Romero was one of the royal officers who organised the free departure from the city of the defeated and very ill Louis of Nassau, Orange’s brother, and his men. He assured Louis that the treaty they had signed would not be violated.110 From Mons, Romero went with Alba’s army in the direction of the Duchy of Brabant, to punish cities that had opened their gates to the rebel troops. The Sack of Mechelen is the first of a series of atrocities committed by the royal army in the Low Countries; Zutphen and Naarden would soon follow. This would create an even worse image of the Spanish soldiers: they were described as a gang of cruel murderers whose hideous crimes did not even spare women and children. We can find this image in chronicles and pamphlets, but also in the famous Beggar songs: “Hear what the Spaniards did to the small children. They pierced them with their lances, cut them with their swords and ripped them to pieces while still alive”.\n\nOn the other hand, Spaniards defended their actions based on the current laws of war, as explained, for example, by Francisco de Vitoria of Salamanca University. The Duke of Alba and his son Fadrique made use of their own system for the punishment of rebellious cities, distinguishing six different situations. It seems that they acted according to these ideas. Under the laws of war it was seen as normal for defenders of a place that did not surrender before the placing of artillery to be left at the mercy of the besiegers. As the Spaniards also saw them as people rebelling against a lawful sovereign, severe punishment could also be defended from that angle. Spanish authors were, however, divided on the influence of religion on the severity of the punishment. For example, the influential Francisco de Vitoria did not think religious wars were justified.113\n\nIn many of the chronicles, like those by Trillo, Mendoza and Van Meteren, Julián did not play a specific role during these punishments. However, in the seventeenth century Hooft would again turn Julián into one of the main protagonists. He describes how he took possession of Mechelen with his troops, and how he did the same in Naarden and Haarlem. Hooft also tells the story about the only three houses in Mechelen that were left standing, one of which belonged to Jan van Brançion, an old friend of Romero’s. Hopefully his famous garden was spared as well!114 A description of the plundering of Mechelen written almost directly after the events seems to praise the Spanish commander for his behaviour, but this praise was ambiguous. When Spanish soldiers were ravaging a large hospital, Romero went into action:\n\nHe chased out the mentioned soldiers and all the others who were there, searching even in the beds of the nuns, but this helped the poor burghers little because this Julián kept all the furniture he could find for himself, estimated to represent a large sum of money.115\n\nWe can read about Romero’s role in the three-day plundering of Mechelen in the letters from Morillon to Granvelle. According to Morillon, Romero had in Mechelen amassed more than one hundred thousand écus and his troops had treated the population as if they were dogs. We have already seen that Morillon and Romero knew each other. Morillon was Vicar-general of the archdiocese of Mechelen, of which Granvelle was the Archbishop, while Romero had been quartered in the city for some eighteen months and had friends in the city.116 In the eyes of the Catholic royalist Morillon, Romero had changed within a few years from a sympathetic and tough hero fighting on the side of good (still in 1568) into a cruel oppressor and exploiter. His revised view on this Spanish commander might be taken as an example of that of many of the faithful Catholic subjects of Philip II in the Low Countries during these years.\n\nThough Julián must have been involved in the storming and sacking of Zutphen in the Duchy of Guelders under Don Fadrique, the mostly very brief descriptions do not attribute an active role to him. However, in the subsequent siege and sacking of the town of Naarden in the County of Holland he is the main protagonist of several anecdotes. The Duke of Alba had remained in Nijmegen due to his gout, making Julián one of the most experienced advisors of the relatively young – and inexperienced – Don Fadrique. The signs had not been good for little Naarden. At Mechelen and Zutphen the royal policy makers had noticed that the severe punishment of one town led to the surrender of many more. And though Naarden sided with the rebels, the garrison was too small and its walls not very strong. Naarden was also the first city in the County of Holland on the army’s route and thus very well situated to serve as a deterrent example. As noted, Julián is missing from the descriptions of Naarden by Spanish chroniclers like Trillo and Mendoza, but also from those by Van Meteren, Roger Williams or Walter Morgan.117\n\nIn Hooft’s work we find Romero again as a protagonist. When the burghers of Naarden realised their hopeless situation, they sent a group of seven negotiators to the besiegers in order to discuss a surrender. This delegation met Romero on their way, and the Spanish commander told them he could speak on behalf of Don Fadrique: “Here then, they hand over the keys, and pray to be forgiven. Julián at first answered very kindly but unclearly to their petition”.118 He subsequently gave his word that the burghers and garrison would be spared and confirmed this by three times shaking the hand of one of the representatives of Naarden, Hendrik Wou, who spoke French very well. Out of respect or inexperience, so Hooft argues, the delegation forgot to ask Romero for written confirmation of the treaty. Romero was received in the town with twenty-eight men who were offered a banquet, followed by another four hundred Spaniards who were also given food and drink. Subsequently, the male inhabitants were ordered to go to the town hall where they were all massacred, followed by the sacking and burning down of the town.\n\nWe can already find Hooft’s story in the work of Pieter Bor, but without many of the details. He does not mention the twenty-eight nor the four hundred soldiers and the banquet. It is also unclear what language was spoken between Julián and the negotiators, as in Bor’s account he had spoken with Wou in Spanish. In later editions of Van Meteren’s chronicle this version was included.119\n\nThe treacherous part played by Julián was thus not Hooft’s invention. Three local texts also mention him. The ‘Cort verhael van de moort…’ by Pieter Aertsz. was included by Gysius in the 1626 edition of his history of the Revolt, while a pamphlet called Moort-dadich verhael… also originated with the Aertsz family. Lambertus Hortensius, Principal of the Latin school, wrote his Latin description shortly after the events.120 Like alderman Gerrit Pieter Aertsz., Hortensius was a member of the delegation that went to discuss the town’s surrender and an eyewitness to the meeting with Romero. After the fatal ending, both Aertsz. and Hortensius had a specific interest in negating any doubts about the possible failure of their delegation.\n\nThe texts emphasise the problems around Romero’s promise. In Hortensius, Romero expressed himself at first very unclearly – and almost threateningly: “Now, he said, give me the keys to the gate. There you will be informed on how we think about pardon and grace”. He repeated those words again, and at the gate he indeed received the keys to the town. According to Hortensius, Romero expressed himself “calmly but not very clearly”. This phrase may have led to Hooft’s formulation, as Hooft certainly made use of Hortensius. The Principal states that only after insisting for quite some time, did Romero promise that all lives and goods would be spared, to be confirmed by the triple handshake between Wou and Romero. However, we do not read anything about the arguments they used to obtain such an obliging promise from the strict Spanish commander. The idea of sparing rebellious but powerless Naarden and its inhabitants without any clear reason does not fit Alba’s policy, the current laws of war or the power relations of the moment. The negotiators from Naarden, of course, were aware of this. Pieter Aertsz. adds another element to the description of the meeting. According to him, Romero had first demanded that in order to leave the burghers at peace one or two hundred Spaniards had to be allowed to enter the town and take as much with them as they could carry, and moreover all burghers and soldiers had to take a new oath of loyalty to the King. This proposition fits much better the power relations between the large army and the inhabitants of Naarden, and it also coincides with Romero’s well-known interest in material gain.\n\nThe author of the pamphlet does not mention any obscurities and spends many words on defending the idea that there was a real treaty: “the aforementioned delegates were of the opinion that by such deeds those of Naarden were sufficiently secured against any violence from the enemy towards their life and goods”. The problem, as Hooft also indicated, was that the delegation had not asked Romero for a written statement. The texts mostly try to prove, on the contrary, that the members of the delegation had not made any errors, which means that we have to take care in judging Romero’s behaviour and in accepting any harsh accusations levelled at him. These texts are written with a clear purpose, and accusing Romero of false promises could clearly have been a good solution. Did the triple handshake really mean that Romero promised to spare everybody without getting anything in return? Both his emphasis on his military honour and his lust for material gain would seem to contradict this idea.\n\nThe reliability of the local texts is also partly nullified by a very extensive and incredibly ‘atrocity marrative’ of the Spanish crimes regarding women, children and old people in these texts.121 A 70-year-old man was stabbed with a dagger in his neck, after which the soldiers drank his blood from their hands. These stories are full of the gruesome clichés related to plundering: many heads and hands are chopped off, a pregnant woman is raped four times and afterwards the unborn child is cut out of her womb and deposited in a bag, nuns are raped, heavily pregnant women are hung by their breasts, a smith sees his legs cut off with his own axes, centenarians are killed and the Spanish even steal an infant’s nappies. In the pamphlet, Hortensius’s son is stabbed to death in the presence of his father and his heart is cut out “and as some say, subsequently cooked and eaten”. Hortensius himself, in total control of his feelings, noted, “Before my very eyes, five people were killed in my house and on my yard, and among them, one who as my kin, was not strange to me”.\n\nThe treacherous breaking of his word as recorded by Dutch authors is refuted by the Spanish authors, as in their descriptions there are no negotiations. Less than three weeks after the events, Alba mentioned Romero’s presence in Naarden and, according to Alba, the Spaniards were able to get over the walls during an attack, after which they “cut the throats of burghers and soldiers without letting anybody escape”. The famous Belgian historian Léon van der Essen, who studied the historial sources from both sides, concluded that negotiations were taking place during which some defenders started shooting. The Spanish immediately attacked. Dutch sources do mention the shooting incident and the subsequent attack, but state that this concerned an earlier round of negotiations. Morillon wrote to Granvelle on 9 December, a mere eight days after the massacre, on the events at Naarden:122\n\nWhile the burghers took their keys to Don Fadrique, their excuses were not accepted, as Don Fadrique wanted to see if they would still be as brave the next day. In the morning our men entered the town without any resistance from the burghers. As soon as they had entered, Captain Julián made the burghers enter the town hall where they were all cut to pieces. After it had been sacked, fire was put to the four corners of the town. Everything was turned into ashes, and many children and pregnant women were burned. These people never do anything else and they have great pleasure in human blood and in making many widows and orphans. It was a nice merchant town, as large as Vilvoorde. It made other towns not very willing to surrender. However, this lord said he had heard that those of Leiden had taken their keys to Don Fadrique….\n\nSo Morillon does not mention the storming of the walls we find in the Spanish sources, but he also fails to mention the false promises from the Dutch texts. The delegation from Naarden had offered the town’s surrender, but Don Fadrique used his power to postpone his final decision until after his troops had entered. Morillon wrote only one week after the events, and as a royalist – but at the same time also a declared enemy of the Spanish military – he may be the most reliable source for the time being. At the same time, the stories about the treacherous Julián cannot be completely dismissed. But do they really coincide with the image we have of this Spanish commander?\n\nJulián and the Prince of Orange\n\nMorillon was right in his idea that Naarden’s fate kept the other cities in Holland from surrendering. After Naarden the royal army continued towards Haarlem, which indeed refused to surrender. On 9 December, the army arrived before the fortress at Spaarndam. Again, Julián was present at the front, and, confirming his well-known reputation for bravery and self-confidence, he declared that he would take the fortress that very same day. With four hundred arquebusiers he crossed the ice and dared the defenders to enter into combat by shooting at them. During the batttle he had already shouted that the attackers were going to win. In Spanish chronicles Julián receives the laurels of victory, though his fellow Maestre de campo, Gonzalo de Bracamonte, also received (somewhat less) praise. There were some two hundred dead enemies against thirty casualties, dead or wounded, in the royal camp. Romero’s glory, however, seems to fade in Hooft’s description, where Catholic spies informed Romero about a path across the ice, ‘the inside path’ by which one could attack the enemy from the rear. Gone is the heroism and again the smell of treason returns to the story.123 In a letter from Don Fadrique to his father, Romero is the main executor of Don Fadrique’s plans. But Don Fadrique does ask his father for a good reward for the brave Julián, describing how the commander and his men had been standing up to their knees in water. Julián’s lame leg led Don Fadrique to offer a small linguistic joke: “What a good leg is his, to go about in this manner” (“Qué buen pie el suyo para andar de esta manera”).\n\nThe siege of Haarlem would drag on for many months. During it Romero wrote a long letter to Alba in which the experienced soldier expressed his amazement at the uniqueness of the siege:126\n\nWhat happens here is worth travelling a hundred miles to see and it is not to be written down, as it has never been seen by anybody who has been born, and there are no descriptions possible of what has happened here; with only one word the whole world would be silenced.\n\nHe also gives examples of the very special nature of the conflict:\n\nThe method they have to inform others is by taking two or three pigeons, and when they arrive at their fleet, they write what they have to write, tie it to a pigeon and let it fly. Then it goes to its home ground and in this way they receive their messages.\n\nHe was also full of admiration for their great capacity to jump across the many canals:\n\nThey have a large number of poles for jumping, very light and thick, larger than pikes, and ending with an iron point just like a pike. At the bottom there is a piece of wood like a small plate to take care that the pole does not sink into the mud from the canals, and in this way they jump.\n\nHe also noticed their tactic of throwing water over the attackers, to force them to stand up to their knees in water, and also the speed with which they repaired their defence works: “You have to start bombarding at dawn, and then start the assault after dinner, and not leave it for the next day, as in one night they would make it even stronger than before”. This admiration for the adversary we also find in the work of Bernardino de Mendoza who emphasises their control of the water. Mendoza also\n\nmentions the jumping pole, along with the stories of peasant women who went to the market on skates, with baskets full of eggs on their heads, pulling sledges full of produce.127\n\nApparently, Romero was in charge of daily affairs during the siege of Haarlem, and he must have often stayed in Fadrique’s headquarters at the House of Cleves, though he may have resided at one of the monasteries outside the city.128 The anonymous captain who gives us this information affirmed in a letter of February 1573 that he had already known Romero for twenty-four years. So maybe he had even fought alongside him during the wars against the French. His opinion of the commander is ambiguous: “I have never seen him as a politician, and he certainly is not, though as a soldier nobody is better than him, and few just as good”.\n\nThe story of Julián’s eye reached the King through a letter by the Duke of Alba:\n\nHe was shot by an arquebus in his right eye, and they say he will not die of it, but I miss him very much, as Don Fadrique is very lonely as he has nobody with him to help him out, and Julián does that very well and is a man of much service.132\n\nThe French ambassador came to the same conclusion and stated that the success of the siege was now in danger, “as there is nobody in whom the Spaniards have more faith”. Don Fadrique acknowledged Romero’s importance for the outcome of the siege and insisted that Romero recover from his wound in Fadrique’s own very comfortable house in Amsterdam. If Romero refused to obey, he would burn down Romero’s residence in Amsterdam. The wounded commander received all kinds of gifts, including a jar of jam from Albornoz, Alba’s personal secretary. In a letter Romero asked Albornoz to hurry in sending another jar as the first one was already half empty. He was so well taken care of that after a fast recovery he was back in action by February.133\n\nThe anonymous captain mentioned above puts Romero’s heroic deeds in a different perspective. Julián lost one eye, so he stated, but high officers in the end all recovered from their injuries, while the poor soldiers almost always died when they received an injury, that is, if they had not already died of hunger. The lengthy siege of Haarlem was a disaster for the royal army, ending in a pyrric victory on 12 July 1573.134\n\nClose to the end of the siege, Julián is supposed to have won another major battle, the battle at the Manpad, at least if we credit the evidence of his friend, Captain Esteban Illán, who described that fourteen hundred corpses were lying around the war theatre: “and I promise your honour that Julián did as he usually does”. His letter offers us the opportunity to sense the optimistic and bellicose atmosphere in Romero’s camp, three days before the surrender of the city. Captain Illán hoped that in his next letter to Albornoz he could inform him of the surrender of Haarlem and of the killing of all heretics.135\n\nAfter the surrender of Haarlem, Julián was the first commander to enter the city, and he was also directly involved in the execution of part of the garrison. The English and Germans were free to leave, but the Scots, Brabanders, Flemings and Walloons were executed, at first by the sword, but afterwards also by throwing them tied into the river Spaarne. Among the civil population only a small group of leaders was executed, and Romero promised to protect the inhabitants from his troops. Trillo mentions the figure of three thousand deaths, “men who with so much arrogance said that Haarlem was to be the grave of the Spaniards”. Strangely enough, Hooft mentions only nine hundred excutions, but he uses his low estimate to attack the Spanish chroniclers for their higher numbers, “as if one could gain honour with the killing of prisoners”. Romero’s actions at Haarlem would survive for centuries. In a play from 1739 the famous Haarlem widow, Kenau, goes to the Spanish army camp and stabs Romero to death in front of his tent.136 In real life, Romero’s life was truly in danger in Haarlem, albeit not through the dramatic deed of a bold national heroine, but at the hands of his own men. They had not been paid for a long time, and after the city’s surrender they decided to start a mutiny. William of Orange wrote to his brother Louis that Julián had to run and climb a breach in the wall in order to escape from the mutineers. It would not be the last time. According to the French ambassador, the mutineers had willingly let Romero go free.\n\nAt the siege of Alkmaar, Romero was again among the most prominent commanders and the bravest warriors, even if information is scarce. Eyewitness Nanning van Foreest mentions him only once as a Spanish colonel in the headquarters at Oudorp, but without labelling him an important commander.138 Spanish chronicles generally do not pay much attention to this siege, as it ended in a quick retreat. Alkmaar had worked hard at improving its defences after going over to the rebel side in June 1572, but when the royal army arrived only four new bulwarks had been ready. Therefore, all artillery fire and storming took place at the old walls on the north side of the city. The size of the royal army is unclear. Numbers reach as high as sixteen thousand and as low as 6,500. The last number comes from the declaration of a Spaniard taken prisoner. On 18 September the major attack took place, costing the lives of many Spanish soldiers. Though Bor and Hooft mention some one thousand deaths, modern historians consider two hundred more likely. The chronicles report that Romero once left the war council on horseback, and he gave a good example of an old warhorse when the soldiers did not want to fight and he, “with his sword in his hand”, threw the enemy from the trenches. There is also a rather bizarre anecdote that tells how Julián during the storming of the walls got stuck in a bridge made of barrels, from which perilous situation he could barely be liberated.\n\nOn 8 October 1573, the royal army retreated from Alkmaar. It went south in order to organise a broad siege ring around Leiden. Julián travelled through the dunes past Noordwijk and Katwijk towards The Hague. From there he continued to the Duchy of Brabant, where he would be busy reorganising the Spanish tercios under the new Governor-general, Luis de Requesens. Philip II had ordered him to remain in the Low Countries to serve under the new Governor-general, and Romero had accepted, though he had “very much wished to go to Spain and had put much effort into this”. He was allowed to send Esteban Yllán in his place, taking his letter to the King.140\n\nHe played only a minor role at the famous siege of Leiden. He arrived almost at the end after fellow commander Francisco Valdés had asked for reinforcements (31 August 1574). Requesens approved of the idea, stating that even if Romero went merely on his own, this would be very beneficial. The Governor-general clearly showed his appreciation for the old hero. But when Romero and his men arrived around Leiden, it seems that Valdés thought the city would fall soon, and he did not really need him any more. According to Trillo, Julián got the impression that Valdés could finish it on his own and did not want to share the honour of the impending victory with somebody else. Romero therefore left Leiden after just one week.141 Valdés would not gain any fame at Leiden, and Romero had left in time to avoid being part of the honourless retreat on 3 October 1574. The incident shows the difficult relationship between the two high officers. The conflict will also be discussed in the chapter on Valdés.\n\nOn 4 November 1573 Romero’s troops captured Philip Marnix of Sint-Aldegonde, one of Orange’s main advisors, in the vicinity of Maassluis. Marnix’s apprehension led to a short-lived revival of the correspondence between the Spanish commander and William of Orange.142 Marnix informed Orange that he was well taken care of and called it “our fortune” that he had fallen into Romero’s hands and not into those of one of the other Spaniards. From Delft, Orange informed his brothers that Marnix had been taken as a prisoner to The Hague:\n\nHe was grateful for the good treatment he received. The said Romero has written me [William of Orange] three or four times letters full of courteous and honourful offers, to which he had responded in equal terms.143\n\nThe exchanged letters were friendly and polite, with Orange ending his letters with words like “be it that the affairs end good or bad, you will always find in me your affectionate servant”. Though Orange feared – and with reason – that Marnix would not survive were he to fall into Alba’s hands, he did not accept an exchange of Marnix for stadtholder Boussu144 as proposed by Romero, calling it “so out of reason and proportion”. As Requesens did not accept other proposals for an exchange of prisoners, the negotiations would drag on for quite some time. It is clear that Marnix was saved because the royal government really wanted to get Boussu back. After he had been taken to the citadel in Utrecht he was finally exchanged for Cristóbal de Mondragón in October 1574.\n\nHowever, Julián wanted more than just exchanging prisoners. He wanted to use Marnix to force Orange into a personal meeting with him about peace. Orange rejected the proposal. The idea was that such\n\na meeting should not be based only on the old friendship between the two men, but also their shared disgust about the cruelties of the current war. Julián wished to return to the days of the “bonne guerre”, the good war, and Orange agreed: “It would be very good to see all those cruelties and inhumanities end that were not used before”.146 We find the same idea in another letter from the Prince: “good war, that like before, has always been practised between all the others nations, stopping all the cruelties so unworthy of christians”.\n\nJulián’s initiative was not well received by Requesens, who even complained to the King about Romero and had copies made of the correspondence that were sent to Madrid.148 The Governor-general still respected him as a military hero, but at the political level Romero was more and more seen as a liability. Romero had even informed the French ambassador about his letters to Orange, who subsequently informed the French King:\n\nThis Julián says to me that he is sure the prince [Orange] would be satisfied with a pension in Germany of thirty or forty thousand écus a year if his son [Philip William] – who is in Spain – would be returned his goods and inheritance, and in the same manner dealing with the other noblemen.\n\nThe ambassador even wrote that Julián planned to go to Madrid in January to speak to the King.149 The journey never took place. Requesens would never have permitted it.\n\nLuctor et submergo\n\nIn early 1574 Julián was involved in an attempt to relieve the besieged city of Middelburg in Zeeland. Sancho Dávila would command a fleet of large vessels, while Romero would head a fleet consisting of many smaller ships for the transportation of troops. The complete failure of the expedition, near Reimerswaal and Bergen-op-Zoom, has turned into one of the most notorious episodes in his career. Already at the start the signs pointed to disaster, as the ceremonial shots with which the fleet saluted the Governor-general who was present caused the loss of one ship as fire broke out. In the continuation, Romero had to confront enemy attacks, the negative behaviour of Dutch sailors in his service, and the always dangerous sandbanks of Zeeland. Julián was defeated on 29 January and had to abandon ship.150\n\nVan Meteren described him as an “old experienced man of war” and tells us that “the admiral Julián Romero crept from a gun port and got away in a small boat”. Hooft makes the story even longer, again using Roger Williams as his source, as Williams was himself involved in the events. Romero “jumped out of a gun port, and with the men he reached land, either in a rowing boat or by swimming”. Requesens stood waiting for him on the quay in Bergen-op-Zoom – in the rain – and Julián told his governor, “quite insolently” according to Hooft, “that he was a soldier and not a boatman, and perfectly capable of making within a wink of time a disgrace of any other fleet”.151 A Beggar’s song relates how “capitein Juliaen de Romero” would have addressed his men before the struggle against the heretics, with an image of the Virgin Mary in his hand, followed by the distribution of wine. One of the wonderful tapestries from Zeeland from the late sixteenth century pictures Romero’s defeat at Reimerswaal.\n\nSpanish chroniclers try to conceal the failure of their hero. As Romero lost eight hundred men and the rebels some one thousand, Trillo even turns the battle into a royal victory. Pedro Cornejo added the presence of many spies, who had informed the enemy about the fleet. Mendoza’s chronicle may have been the source for Hooft’s famous quotation\n\nfrom Romero: “Your excellence knows perfectly well that I am not a sailor, but a soldier, so do not give me more war fleets, because even if you gave me a hundred fleets, it may be feared I would lose all of them”. However, Hooft stops here, while Mendoza’s story continues, and he relates how subsequently Romero was received as a brave hero by Requesens. It shows how Captain Julián’s fame easily protected him against the negative images surrounding the disaster.153\n\nIn reality, the situation was completely different. In a letter to the King Requesens accused Romero of gross errors and even described his actions as a “grandisimo disparate”. One did not need to be a sailor in order to navigate for three hours following very precise instructions. Morillon also attacked the Spanish commander now turned admiral: “a very big error of captain Julián to have been so reckless” and “the said captain Julián has followed them very badly”. Granvelle showed both sides of Romero:\n\nJulián has proved himself to be brave on land, but in his short time on water to attack the enemies, he made maritime errors, as he went against the wind and against the tide, while the smoke of the artillery was hiding his enemies, who at close range shot at his men, and it is said, I do not know if it is true, that on this journey he did not show his usual valour.\n\nPhilip II, however, supported his hero and asked Requesens to comfort him.154 But still, Romero’s image at the courts of Madrid and Brussels had certainly been damaged by this incident as well as by his controversial attempt to negotiate directly with William of Orange. He was still a brave hero, but the limits of his capabilities became more and more evident. The best example to demonstrate this change can be found in a letter from Requesens to his brother. The paragraph in question was written in cipher for security reasons and the Governor-general was less careful in his wording than in the official correspondence:\n\nThe Duke has very good reasons for stating that his best soldiers here are Sancho Dávila and Mondragón, and certainly it is like this, although…\n\nAnd here the cipher starts:\n\nJulián is the best man in the execution of war, but only when he is serving his general and does not have to make decisions on his own, because if he has to be guided by his own head he is worth nothing, and so he has done more than one hundred thousand things wrong for me, even without counting that of the sea, and I fear that he will keep delivering the same number of errors in the future. And as he does not remedy the chaos amongst his soldiers, they hate him worse than the devil, because he dishonours them and they hate going with him anywhere and even then they keep on playing dirty tricks on him.155\n\nRomero went into the field again, in Holland, but now he had to obey the moderate policy of Requesens, who explained this in a letter to the commander:\n\nAnd so it is necessary that most of all Your Honour must be careful in avoiding that the Spaniards, the Swiss, nor the others nations, will hurt the local people, and instead make sure that they are being treated well, so that their example will make other places surrender, something they will not do when they see that the treatment is bad.\n\nTogether with Sancho Dávila he received the power to offer pardon to places that surrendered without consulting Requesens. He also worked on the contruction of fortressses near Zevenbergen, Geertruidenberg and the Langstraat to block the entrance into Braban"
