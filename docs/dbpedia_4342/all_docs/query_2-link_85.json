        "text": "This is a study of the trajectory of a Jewish converso who had a brilliant career at the University of Mexico in the 16th century: he received degrees from the faculties of arts, theology and law and was a professor for more than 28 years. He gained prestige and earned the respect of his fellow citizens, participated in monarchical politics and was an active member of his society, becoming the elected bishop of Guatemala. However, when he tried to become a judge of the Inquisition, a thorough investigation revealed his Jewish ancestry back in the Iberian Peninsula, causing his career to come to a halt. Further inquiry revealed that his grandmother had been burned by the Inquisition and accused of being a Judaizer around 1481; his nephews and nieces managed, in 1625, to obtain a letter from the Inquisition vouching for the “cleanliness of blood” of the family. Furthermore, the nephews founded an entailed estate in Oaxaca and forbade the heir of the entail to marry into the Jewish com...\n\nThis article examines the lives of two Portuguese conversos, Gaspar Robles and Francisco Home, a nephew and his uncle, both tried by the Inquisition tribunal in seventeenth-century colonial Mexico during the decade leading up to the Gran auto de fé of 1649. However, their trajectories were vastly different. Gaspar Robles voluntarily approached the Inquisition tribunal confessing his own and his family's secret Jewish practices. He incriminated his father, his three uncles, and many other acquaintances who formed part of the converso community in New Spain precipitating the mass prosecutions of many in the converso community. In contrast, his uncle Francisco Home was also arrested soon after Gaspar's confession. He was tried and tortured, and he eventually confessed to his own crypto-Judaism. However, he protected some in the converso community in sharp contrast with his nephew's voluntary confession. Through close examination, this article explores the role of individual and community identity among conversos in New Spain to explain why the nephew confessed to the tribunal sealing the fate of his immediate family and that of a whole community. It argues that in cases such as that of Gaspar Robles familial ties proved more a liability than a protection and the final outcome was contingent on a combination of religious and ethnic identity, the process of migration, and individual circumstances. In 1641, thirty-two year old member of a Portuguese merchant family Gaspar Robles voluntarily appeared before the Holy Office of the Inquisi-tion in Mexico City denouncing himself and his kinsmen as crypto-Jews (individuals who professed to be Christian in public, but practiced Ju-daism in secret). 1 Rare was the crypto-Jew who made a voluntary self-denunciation before the Inquisition tribunal. More often, the Holy Office of the Inquisition would build a case based on information gathered from voluntary denunciations, or sometimes from testimonies provided by individuals already in the hands of the tribunal whom they questioned, at other times under the duress of torture or the threat of it. Since the religious purpose of the Inquisition was to protect the Christian community from heresy and deviant practices, the tribunal had in Gaspar Robles the perfect instrument to fulfill its duties.\n\nABSTRACT Maria Nuñez, a Cuban mulatto was accused of Judaizing, being and a follower of the Law of Moses being brought before the Mexican Inquisitorial Tribunal in 1651. Her trial transcripts are found in the Archivo Historico Nacional in Madrid, Book 1020 for the years 1630-1655. By analyzing this case, we aim to further elucidate the history of Judaizers, Cryto-Jews as well as Conversos in Cuba before a widely believed date of «Jewish» arrival on the island. Exploring the familial ties of Nuñez will highlight the significance of her case in relation to a broader view of the phenomenon of Inquisitorial accusations in the Americas. Connecting her case to the great Autos da Fe in Mexico City, we aim to insert it within the wider phenomenon of the intense persecutions of the late 17th century. Many of her relatives had been relaxed, burned or accused of being Jews by the Inquisition in Mexico City during these decades. The people and places mentioned in her case as well as the intricate web of accusers and accused which participated in her trial will allow for an exploration of heretofore unknown nexus between Jews, Judaizers and Conversos in such disparate places as London, Canary Islands, Peru, Mexico and Cuba. By reproducing the entire «legajo» as an appendix, her trial can be read in the original. We intend to emphasize the importance of a continual exploration of similar and unknown cases as a contribution to the wider discussion of Crypto Jewish history in the Circum Caribbean basin with a focus on Cuba as a locus for many of them."
