        "text": "'The Cinderella of the Colleges', which 'remains the enigma it has always been' . Thus Godfrey Anstruther described St Gregory's, Seville, in the second and third volumes of his Seminary Priests. It is to be hoped that this volume will go some way to solving this enigma, throwing light upon a hitherto obscure corner of recusant history. It may be of interest also to historians of Seville and students of Anglo-Spanish relations during an eventful period. Perhaps it will provide the materials for a more informed assessment of the legacy of Robert Persons. A glance at the notes will show that the historical skeleton contained here has had to be assembled painfully from disjecta membra. Other material may still lie buried in Spanish archives for a future historian to disinter."
