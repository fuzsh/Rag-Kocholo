        "text": "Chapter I: Introduction, 1661 AD.\n\nThe austere Felipe IV inherited the combined thrones of Spain, together with Portugal, Sicily, Naples, and a vast colonial empire on the 31st of March, 1621. He was just sixteen. He proved to be an ineffectual ruler, whose reign saw the loss of Portugal (with its vast colonial empire), Jamaica, Cerdagne, Roussilon, Artois and other parts of the Netherlands. At times he came close to losing even his native crown of Castille. His military incompetence also saw the loss of Moyenvic and Bar, the remaining possessions of his sole ally the Duke of Lorraine.\n\nAt the age of ten he had married Elizabeth of France, as part of a double marriage alliance with the Bourbons. She gave him seven children, but only one son - the Infante Baltasar Carlos. Of the six girls, only one (Maria Theresa), survived infancy.\n\nÉlisabeth's death in 1644 freed the King up to marry once more. The premature death of the Infante Baltasar Carlos at the age of sixteen in 1646, and the deaths of the King's brothers Carlos and Ferdinand in 1632 and 1642, impressed upon him the urgency of securing the royal succession. He opted for Baltasar's intended bride, the Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. The new Queen Mariana, who was only twelve when they first became engaged, was also his niece. She dutifully set about providing him with the desired heirs: Margarita Teresa (born 1651), Maria Ambrosia (who did not long survive birth in 1655), the hoped-for male heir, Felipe Prospero, in 1657, and another son, Ferdinand Thomas, in 1658. Though this last prince did not make it to his first birthday, yet another pregnancy allowed the King enough lee-way to consent to his eldest daughter's match with his French nephew as part of the disastrous peace of 1660, on the proviso she renounce for herself and her heirs any claim to the Spanish throne.\n\nUnfortunately, the succession was proving every bit as precarious as the King had feared. This fifth pregnancy proved to be the Queen's last; she expired shortly after the birth of a pudgy but sickly Infante [1]. Baptized Charles Eugene Felix, he was sickly and deformed, with herpes-like rashes on his face and atrophic genitalia [2]. His elder brother the Prince of Asturias was, comparatively, perfectly formed, but given to epileptic seizures and bouts of illness. As, if seemed likely, the two princes perished early or without heirs, the King determined to settle the succession on his younger daughter Margarita. She was promptly affianced, succession rights intact, to her uncle the Emperor Leopold.\n\nThe matter of the King's remarriage was immediately brought up. A healthy young bride of sufficient rank was sought for him in the four corners of Christendom. The fourteen year old Louisa Maria of the Palatinate was given some consideration, being favoured by both Paris and Vienna. Though destitute, she was the cousin of the Empress-Dowager Eleanora Gonzaga and of the Duke of Mantua, a loyal ally of the Empire; she also the niece of the Queen of Poland, of the Elector Palatine and of the Electress of Hanover. The Duke Alfonso IV of Modena had two sisters, Leonora and Maria, in their late teens, but the Spanish sovereign had little wish to ally himself to so loyal a servant of France. A far richer and more prestigious union presented itself in the thirteen year old Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans, a princess of the blood royal of France and cousin of King Louis XIV. She was also the niece of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who avidly promoted the union, seeing in it the surest means of recovering his patrimony. The Emperor also put forward his younger sisters, the Archduchesses Eleonora Maria and Maria Anna Josepha, though these were yet children and the half-sisters of Felipe's previous queen. Alternatively, he suggested a cousin, Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Austria, or her sister Maria Magdalena, though both were still children also.​\n\n[1] Our first POD. OTL Queen Mariana survived her husband and played a significant role in the reign of her son Charles II.\n\n[2] According to this source, Charles had a single atrophied testicle and posterior hypospadias. They seem to be basing this primarily off \"the confession of Queen Maria Luisa of Orleans that the king suffered premature ejaculation that prevented him from consummating the marriage\". For the sake of this TL, Charles' hypospadias will not be quite as severe as they have determined in their study.\n\nNo 'War of the Spanish Succession', then?\n\nBritain presumably doesn't gain Gibraltar, which => lots of butterflies (or Minorca, either, which => some), and various other changes in ownership for assorted bits of Europe don't take place around then either. Some of those other changes not happening then would definitely also have noticeable effects on later events, for example with the Spanish Netherlands not transferred to Austrian rule the 'War of the Bavarian Succession' presumably doesn't happen either.\n\nJohn Churchill, Earl of Marlborough, had already distinguished himself as a general IOTL, and if Britain gets involved in another conflict of comparable importance instead during the same general period he's probably our army's commander in that fight instead (but, of course, quite possibly with different results). However unless he does get that other opportunity at command -- and perhaps even if he does -- he might never get upgraded from Earl to Duke, and it's likely that Blenheim Palace is never built. How much this would plausibly change things for his descendants would be a matter of opinion... Maybe no WSC, for example?\n\nNo War of the Spanish Succession, at least not like OTL. As Charles II still marries Catherine of Braganza, the English still get Tangiers ITTL, so I wouldn't rule out them angling for Gibraltar at any opportunity that presents itself.\n\nAs for Churchill, unless his military career takes a drastic turn for the worse, I dare say the careers of his wife and sister will still see him becoming every bit as prominent OTL. As for WSC, I think by the time he comes around butterflies might be too considerable for him to exist in any recognisable form? Not sure on that.\n\nIf we butterfly away the War of Spanish Succession and Louis XIV doesn't get involved in a similarly massive war Absolutist France is probably in a much better position through the 18th century. War with Britain is likely over colonies in the Americas and India over the century but without the ruinous expenses and damage to the French military the war brought the French might hold onto their empire in America a lot longer and maybe expand in India. Might also be a bigger France in Europe since Louis XIV doesn't lose many of his gains in Italy, Germany and the Low Countries from previous smaller wars.\n\nInteresting, thanks for that. Without the Spanish succession in jeopardy, what would you say Louis XIV's main priorities will be abroad?\n\nSpain would be somewhat better off, but you could still expect absolutist France to fight the Habsburgs at the next opportunity.\n\nExactly. After all, if Felipe V was a disappointment, one cannot expect his \"challenged\" sons to make for significantly more competent monarchs. Wars are inevitable at this point.\n\nNice. Also just be interesting how the alliances would turn out. As Spain may not be sucked into France's orbit.\n\nBut losing the Spanish Netherlands is only a good thing for Spain.\n\nNot having a Bourbon Spain has a lot of interesting butterflies, for both Spanish and French policy, as well as dynastic marriages, which in turn affects which monarchs get born, which lines die out, etc.\n\nAs for the Netherlands, I don't think the Habsburgs would see it that way\n\nChapter II: Damsels for Spain, Part One\n\nAt the age of fifty-seven, King Felipe V of Spain decided to embark on his third matrimonial journey. The bride of choice was Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans, daughter of the recently deceased Duc d'Orléans and first cousin of King Louis XIV. She fulfilled the main pre-requisites, being of impeccable royal lineage and suitable age for the breeding of heirs. Her sister Marguerite Louise had recently received a dowry of 900,000 livres in marriage to the Grand Duke; the King of Spain could reasonably expect the same or more. Though it paled in comparison to what Felipe had recently pledged for his daughter (the grand sum of 500,000 écus), it was a standard dote for a French royal princess. Recent wars had bled both France and Spain dry; Spain was still committed to the reconquest of Portugal (whose resistance was partially funded by the French). As such, neither crown was in position to actually afford such lavish sums - let their heirs wrangle over them in future negotiations.\n\nThe Baron de Banteville was accordingly sent forward into France. The Baron had for the past months been in England, attempting to arrange a marriage between the recently restored King Charles II and the Dowager Empress. When this union failed - the English King drily commenting that the Dowager was \"poor in money, rich in years\" - Banteville promoted a union between Charles and the princess Maria Caterine Farnese of Parma. In order to make up for her inferior birth, Felipe offered to adopt the princess, providing her with the title and rank of an Infanta and the dowry of one. Charles' counter proposal that he marry a true infanta, Margarita Theresa, and that her intended spouse (and uncle) the Emperor be compensated with the hand of his sister, Henrietta, was promptly shot down. Other pro-Spanish matches with ladies of Saxony and Denmark were similarly discarded. Shortly thereafter the Princess Henrietta married her cousin the Duc d'Orléans, and Charles consented to a union with the Infanta Catherine of Portugal, who brought him a ridiculously extravagant dowry including Tangiers and Bombay.\n\nWith the Stuarts drawing closer to the French and the Braganza usurpers in Portugal, Felipe desired to counter-act this by contracting a profitable marriage to a French princess. King Louis, however, was less than enthusiastic about the union. So grand a union necessitated an equally grand dowry, which he had no desire of paying. He did not particularly feel like pledging to pay it either. Nor was he enthusiastic about any project involving King Felipe's marriage to a young fertile bride who might give him yet more sons, to the detriment of Louis and his wife's own claims. King Louis promptly consented to the Orléans girl's match to the Duke of Savoy, to the great displeasure of her mother and uncle.\n\nThe snub would have infuriated Felipe, were it not for the fact that his attention was already elsewhere. The marriage with Louise Maria of the Palatinate was increasingly favoured, at home and abroad, where it received the support of several notable sponsors. The eldest daughter of the Prince and Princess Palatine, she was well-bred and well-connected, although unfortunately related to the Haus Habsburg only distantly. Women of her house had, of late, served as royal consorts with great distinction; her aunt Marie Louise was twice Queen of Poland and her cousin Eleanora recently Holy Roman Empress. Her mother the Princess, \"whose manner and address were said to be those of a Queen, her appearance eminently graceful and majestic\", was a close friend of Felipe's sister, the Queen Dowager of France. At Felipe's behest Queen Anne interviewed the girl in order to assess her suitability for a future as consort of Spain. To her mother's barely concealed delight, she passed with flying colours.\n\nThough welcome, it was not his sister's endorsement that fanned the flame of Felipe's ardour. As fortune would have it, the girl's grandmother, Elizabeth of England, sometime Queen of Bohemia, and her uncle, prince Rupert of the Rhine, were then at the English court, where Rupert (recently made Duke of Cumberland) sat on the Privy Council and was the King's closest male relative besides his brother. This Prince wielded great influence over the King Charles. The King's recent marriage with the Portuguese infanta excited fears of hostilities between England and it's traditional ally Spain - hostilities which would certainly injure the Kingdom's highly profitable trade with the Spanish Low Countries. A marriage between the King's cousin and the Spanish King was the surest way of pacifying these subjects. A concerted effort from the girl's parents, uncle and grandmother soon convinced both the English and Spanish Kings of the propriety of the marriage.\n\nDespite his blatant disregard for Spain the past year, the English King was the first to take active steps towards promoting the marriage. He called the girl's father, the Prince Palatine Edward, to England, ostensibly for a meeting of the knights of the Garter. Though Catholic, the prince was inoffensive and affable, benefiting greatly from the popularity of his brother Rupert. Charles elevated him to the peerage as Duke of Cambridge - albeit with reserve to male heirs only - and settled upon him a healthy pension of ₤3000.\n\nFelipe was appropriately encouraged, but the matter of the girl's dowry posed the next greatest issue. Her parents had hitherto relied primarily on the generosity of the French King, their fortune now bolstered by the favour of England. Neither of these incomes were so substantial as to afford anything near a suitable dowry for a future Queen of Spain. Felipe showed himself amenable to a dowry of 860,000 livres, which was only slightly more than what had been promised for the English King's sister (she was given 840,000). King Charles was prevailed upon to provide the bulk of this sum, whereupon negotiations stalled somewhat. Banteville therefore advanced a proposal that the recently acquired port of Dunkirk, hitherto a Spanish possession, be pawned back to the Spanish crown as security for the payment of the dowry. If not Dunkirk (which the English intended to sell to the French for half a million), Felipe would accept Tangier, which he viewed as his rightful possession as de jure King of Portugal (the Braganza usurpers having no right to dispose of it as their daughter's dowry). To sweeten the deal, Felipe even showed himself amenable to recognising English ownership of Jamaica.\n\nAlarmed by this sudden re-approximation, King Louis attemped to halt, or at least delay, the concretion of this union. He proposed Felipe marry his cousin, La Grande Mademoiselle Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, elder sister of the other Orléans girl. A marriage between Felipe and La Grande Mademoiselle had been discussed before, and she had been tentatively pledged to his brother Ferdinand at the time of the Infante's death. She was the greatest heiress of her time, an educated and accomplished woman who would make a perfect choice for step-mother to Felipe's children. Most importantly (for Louis), her advanced age greatly diminished the likelihood of any extra heirs being produced.\n\nAs for Felipe, he was most interested in the potential acquisition of her vast personal fortune, complete with the sovereign principality of Dombes, which adjoined his own Franche Comté. Louis saw in the match a means of securing the bulk of Mademoiselle's vast lands and incomes for his son and brother, while simultaneously preventing his father-in-law from siring more heirs. He was, however, loathe to see the Spanish gain Dombes, and insisted that the few lands which she might retain - the Mademoiselle adamantly refused to give up certain titles and properties - be prevented from ever being held in conjunction with the Spanish crown.\n\nLa Grande Mademoiselle​\n\nOne princess - young, poor. The other, old and rich. Louisa Maria's lack of an appropriate dowry slowed negotiations with the English, which were not aided by the mixed opinions of Charles' councillors - particularly Edward Hyde, who cared little for the Spanish. Mademoiselle's whimsical disposition and Louis' fears of Spanish encroachment upon his realm did not particularly allay Felipe's uncertainty about allying himself with a barren spinster.\n\nWhile he struggled over his own matrimony, the King found it much easier to suitably bestow his eldest surviving son, the Prince of Asturias, in marriage. At the age of just five the young Felipe Prospero was pledged to his aunt, the eight year old Archduchess Maria Anna Josepha of Austria. In case of his death, she would wed his brother Charles Eugene, or his father King Felipe, whichever was available; in case of her premature death, he would wed her sister the Archduchess Eleonora Maria. In this way the ties between El Escorial and Wien were reaffirmed once more, ensuring the succession of the surviving branch should the other ever fail. ​\n\nChapter III: Damsels For Spain, Part Two\n\nAfter much careful consideration, Felipe decided to pursue the hand of La Grande Mademoiselle. Though considerably older than Louisa Maria of the Palatinate, a daughter of France outranked and surpassed the daughter of a junior Palatinate prince in every other way imaginable. She was the niece of his beloved first wife and resembled her greatly. Most rare for royal marriages, he did not have to rely on other's reports of her appearance and manner - he had met her recently, at the marriage of his daughter the Infanta with King Louis XIV. He had heard with interest her refusal of a proposal from the would-be King of Portugal, who she thought likely to lose his throne to Felipe. A marriage with her would therefore underline his own undisputed sovereign status in opposition to the questionable legitimacy of the Braganza's claimed royal status. It would also reaffirm the ties between Spain and France, hopefully driving a wedge between the French and their now rejected Portuguese allies, who would have to look elsewhere for a Queen. Mademoiselle brought with her a vast fortune which Felipe hoped to gain access too, and the principality of Dombes bordering his Franche-Comté. Lastly, she would provide a much needed mother figure for his two impaired infant sons, who would likely to be orphaned sooner rather than later.\n\nThe main issue for the marriage with La Grande Mademoiselle was her consent, which was easily obtained once the offer was officially made. The second issue was the disposition of her vast fortune and landed property within the French Kingdom. On her insistence it was agreed that she retain her beloved estate of Eu, recently purchased from the Guises to the tune of 2.55 million livres, and her mother's Duchy of Montpensier. She also retained the principality of Dombes, valued at some 3 million livres, and the counties of Bar-sur-Seine and Mortain. These properties were to be her exclusive personal possessions, independent of her husband and the Spanish crown, and a security for her in her widowhood.\n\nShe exchanged with the King the duchy-peerage of Châtellerault, together with the duchy of Saint-Fargeau, the dauphinate of Auvergne and the principality of La Roche-sur-Yon for his co-sovereignty of the tiny principality of Andorra straddling the Pyrenees. It was far from a fair trade but a gesture greatly appreciated by her intended husband. She sold the marquisate of Mézières for 180,000 livres to Hortense Mancini, niece and heiress of the recently deceased Cardinal Mazarin, and leased the rest of her counties and baronies to her cousin Philippe, the Duc d'Orléans. There was little likelihood of her receiving the promised payment, but it was a small price to pay for the dignity of the consort's crown of Spain. Her outstanding debts, which were not inconsiderable, became the responsibility of Orléans, to be abated from the owed sum. The lease also permitted her, or her heirs, to redeem the leased properties at the sale price. Finally she she nominated Orléans as her universal heir in the occassion of her childless, in accordance with King Louis' wishes.\n\nThe betrothal was solemnised at the end of June 1662, whereafter the French court travelled south for the marriage. Arriving in Bordeaux in July, she dallied there three weeks. The King of Spain met his bride on the isle of Pheasants, the traditional meeting place of the French and Spanish courts - he had met his first wife there, and most recently his daughter Maria Theresa had met King Louis. She was married by proxy to Felipe on August 5th at Saint-Jean-de-Luz and then in a Spanish service on August 10th at Fontarabia.\n\nEcstatic, vindicated, triumphant, the new Queen of Spain said goodbye to her countrymen and regressed with her gloomy husband back to his monastery-palace of El Escorial where she would - finally - preside as the undisputed mistress of her very own court.\n\nMonastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial​\n\n​\n\nSo the French match is made!\n\nAt 36 another pregnancy wouldn't be impossible...a tad risky in the 17th century but not impossible. A healthy child would do wonders infusing new blood into the Spanish Hapsburgs though...\n\nI wonder how she'll get along with John Jose (John of Austria the Younger) Philip IV's illegitimate son? That relationship is going to define Spain's course following the death of Philip IV. Given her proclivities in OTL and her attempted marriage to the duc de Lauzun I could see her falling for John of Austria the Younger (He's only 2 years younger than her...) that would certainly make things interesting!\n\nAlso how will the French Match in TTL affect the War of Devolution? Will Louis still try to make an issue of the dowry owed to him by Spain, or will he focus on his wife's claim to the Spanish Netherlands due to her birth order?\n\nYep! I struggled with it, because I'm sure Louisa Maria could have made an interesting teen queen, and her mother an interesting schemer and plotter. But ultimately I think it is far more plausible that Felipe would opt for Mademoiselle, and the butterflies from that are very interesting too.\n\nDon Juan José is away in Portugal fighting, and is likely to stay there for a while. At least initially I can see the two getting along quite well, so long as Juan is respectful of her superior status. Not having a Queen consort opposed to him from the outset is good for his career. (If I recall correctly, Queen Mariana wasn't his biggest fan and had him removed from his command in Portugal).\n\nMademoiselle being an adult woman will probably be able to command both her husband and court a lot more competently than Mariana OTL. A mésalliance or lover would be a bad move, but I think she's just about silly enough to commit that kind of mistake... Don Juan is out of bounds though, it'd be too much like Charles V's affair with his step-grandma Germaine de Foixe. I mean, it's not impossible, but it has the makings of a political minefield - so much as a rumour of it could completely ruin her position.\n\nThe main butterflies here are for the War of Devolution. Marrying Mademoiselle allows Felipe to make his daughter's dowry payments. On the other hand, Louis still wants the Spanish Low Countries, and can count on the Emperor's support/neutrality as long as the heir to Spain is a sickly little boy. For the sake of this TL I'm going on the assumption that Louis hadn't thought up the whole idea of devolution etc in 1662, at which point he couldn't be certain his wife's dowry would go unpaid.​"
