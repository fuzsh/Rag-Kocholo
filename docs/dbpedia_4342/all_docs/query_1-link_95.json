        "text": "Â p509Â Biographical Notes\n\n(continued:Â QâS)\n\nRodrigo deÂ Quiroga (d.Â 1580) was a member of a noble Galician family. He came to Peru inÂ 1535 and distinguished himself by his humane conduct in expeditions against the Indians. After joining Valdivia in Chile he filled various municipal offices in Santiago and became Valdivia's lieutenant and later the lieutenant of Hurtado deÂ Mendoza. After Valdivia's death he was helpful in settling the dispute between Villagra (q.v.) and his chief rival. Enrolled as knight of the Order of Santiago, he was appointed governor of Chile inÂ 1573 and served untilÂ 1578. â M,Â pp716â719.\n\nPablo RamÃ­rez RodrÃ­guez (1886âÂ ) received his training in private schools and at the Catholic University and became advocate inÂ 1908. As a member of the radical party he held a seat as deputy (1912â1921) and became minister of justice and instructionÂ (1919) and of the treasuryÂ (1927) while also serving (1928â29) as adÂ interim in the ministries of agriculture and of education. His attempted reforms in education and finance and his efforts in connection with Cosach (see p383Â n.) aroused much opposition. â F,Â V,Â 602â605.\n\nAlonso deÂ Reinoso (1515â156?) was born in the province of Toledo and inÂ 1535 embarked for America. His earlier services took place in Central America and Yucatan with Montejo and Alvarado, and he accompanied the latter in his last campaigns in Mexico. He joined LaÂ Gasca in his campaigns against Hernando Pizarro and came to Chile with Villagra before the death of Valdivia. Assisting the latter in his southern campaigns, he helped found various cities, including ConcepciÃ³n, Valdivia, and Imperial and under Hurtado deÂ Mendoza executed CaupolicÃ¡n, as described in the text, \"with more rigor and haste than Â p510Â forethought.\" Villagra made him lieutenant in ConcepciÃ³n. â M,Â pp729â737.\n\nManuel Rengifo CÃ¡rdenas (1793â1845) was born in Santiago. He early acquired an honorable reputation as a merchant in Chile and Peru and as such was employed by BolÃ­var at Lima to determine Peru's indebtedness to Chile. Becoming minister of the treasury inÂ 1830, he performed laudable work in organizing that ministry and in meeting the existing deficit. By making Valparaiso a port of deposit for foreign merchandise, he greatly increased its importance and enlarged the national revenue. As minister inÂ 1834 and inÂ 1837, he prepared notable memoirs during his incumbency and also served as senator and plenipotentiary to Peru, with which republic he negotiated an important commercial treaty. â E,Â I,Â 851; F,Â V,Â 614â615; Sotomayor ValdÃ©s, Historia deÂ Chile, I,Â 36â39, 201â225, 276, 447.\n\nVicente Reyes Palazuelos (1835â1918) received his title as advocate inÂ 1858 and immediately connected himself with ElÂ ferrocarril and other papers associated with the liberal party. InÂ 1861 he entered the chamber of deputies, where he was immediately recognized as an accurate and forceful debater. He participated in the reform movement of the early seventies, headed a cabinet for some months inÂ 1877 andÂ 1878, was elected to the senate inÂ 1888, and served as its presiding officer. He condemned the revolutionary movement ofÂ 1891 but remained strictly neutral during that contest. InÂ 1894 he was returned without opposition to the senate and remained a member of that body until his death â aÂ tribute to his personal integrity and high principles. In his later public life his sterling character, free from pecuniary scandal or crooked political practice, contrasted sharply with that of most of his contemporaries. â F,Â V,Â 624â625.\n\nRafael deÂ Riego yÂ NÃºÃ±ez (1785â1823) was a native of the Asturias and was educated in part at Oviedo. He enrolled in the Royal Guard inÂ 1807 and distinguished himself in opposing the French invasion of the Peninsula until he was taken prisoner. During his captivity in France, he absorbed the revolutionary principles that later made him prominent in resisting the autocratic rule of FerdinandÂ VII. Certain indiscretions subjected him to the charge of disloyalty on which he was ultimately convicted and executed. â E,Â LI,Â 513â514.\n\nGermÃ¡n Riesco ErrÃ¡zuriz (1854â1916) was born in Rancagua in a notable Chilean family of Leonese descent. His mother was a sister of the elder President ErrÃ¡zuriz. He gained the title of advocate inÂ 1875, served in a minor capacity in the ministry of justice for five years and then for ten years in the court of appeals as relator and seven years as fiscal (prosecutor), and then passed to the same office in the supreme Â p511Â court. InÂ 1809 he became liberal senator from Talca. Discreet and reserved in manner, he spoke little. His nomination for the presidency inÂ 1901 by the liberal alliance came as a surprise to the country, for he was lacking in political experience and virtually unknown. As nephew of the elder ErrÃ¡zuriz and brother-inâlaw of the recently deceased president, Riesco did not lack political insight and his character led each faction to support him in the hope of being able to profit from his family influence. His first ministry was of high caliber but speedily dissolved, to be followed by the usual ever-changing combinations that characterized the soâcalled \"parliamentary rÃ©gime.\" Despite the prevalent party indiscipline and the president's own ill-health, the Riesco administration fared well in its treaties with Bolivia and Argentina and effected some improvement in public service. In later years public opinion rendered Riesco tardy justice. â F,Â V,Â 630â632.\n\nCatalina deÂ losÂ RÃ­os (d.Â 1665) was connected with the Lisperguer family through her mother. The founder of that family came to Chile from Worms inÂ 1557 with GarcÃ­a Hurtado deÂ Mendoza. Barros Arana (B,Â IV,Â 400â401) characterizes as doubtful many of the accusations against the earlier members of this family, although noting that some later seemed to flout the laws and the authorities with impunity. SeÃ±ora Catalina was charged with poisoning her father, with murdering her lover (aÂ member of the Order of St.Â John), and with other assassinations, fourteen in all. Brought before the royal audiencia inÂ 1660, she escaped the consequences of her crimes through delay and bribery â methods which involved Governor Meneses. â B, III,Â 400â402; M,Â pp464, 747.\n\nConrado RÃ­os Gallardo (1896âÂ ) has held a prominent place in the liberal party sinceÂ 1921. His reputation, however, rests largely upon his work as journalist, especially in connection with LaÂ naciÃ³n, of which he became managing editor inÂ 1926. As minister of foreign affairs and commerce (1927â1929), he reorganized the ministry, and later served as special envoy to Spain and Peru. He was largely instrumental in bringing about better relations with Bolivia and Peru. He was one of the founders Hoy inÂ 1931. â F,Â V,Â 647â649.\n\nManuel Rivas VicuÃ±a (1880âÂ ) entered congress as deputy inÂ 1909 and became minister of the treasury inÂ 1912. He was later a member of cabinets inÂ 1922 andÂ 1926, and headed the ministry that was displaced by IbÃ¡Ã±ez inÂ 1927. Popularly known as the \"Great Rabbi of Liberalism,\" he has had a long and honorable career as journalist, law professor, and diplomat and is recognized as one of the most skillful politicians and debaters of the country. Most of his writings have appeared in the contemporary press. In politics he has been more successful Â p512Â in defeating ministries than in building up successful cabinets. While an exile in Constantinople, he arbitrated a dispute between the Turks and the Greeks. Later he was the ambassador of Chile at Rome and a delegate at Geneva. â F,Â IV,Â 663; Hoy, OctoberÂ 1, 1936, p23.\n\nGalvarino Riveros CÃ¡rdenas (1833â1892) was born in the province of ChiloÃ©, educated in the old Military Academy, and began his naval service inÂ 1848. He served well in minor positions, particularly in explorations, and became captain inÂ 1870. As a result of the encounter at Angamos during which he coÃ¶perated with Latorre, he was promoted to vice-admiral, but his course provoked much controversy, and as a result he was forced to retire. Later his comrades rendered him justice and, inÂ 1931 a monument was erected to his memory in Cunaco deÂ VÃ©liz. â F,Â V,Â 666.\n\nJulioÂ A. Roca (1843â1914) was born in TucumÃ¡n, of a distinguished Argentine family. He was a student in the Colegio Nacional of Uruguay, when at the age of fifteen he volunteered in the struggle between Buenos Aires and the confederation. He became lieutenant colonel in the war against Paraguay. InÂ 1878 he took charge of the campaign against Patagonia which added many leagues of fertile land to the Argentine Republic and made Roca president inÂ 1880. As chief executive he strove to improve communications and reorganize the army. After a mission to Europe, following his administration, he reÃ«ntered politics inÂ 190, later became minister of the interior, and inÂ 1898 was elected president for a second term. He retired to private life inÂ 1904, and his only other public service was as special embassy to Brazil inÂ 1913. â E,Â LI,Â 1083.\n\nManuel RodrÃ­guez Ardoiza (1785â1818) received the title of advocate inÂ 1809 and was one of the first to take part in the revolutionary movement. He served Carrera loyally as secretary, but after the defeat at Rancagua he temporarily sought refuge in Argentina. He was one of the most faithful supporters of SanÂ MartÃ­n while there, but saw that his presence was more necessary in Chile. He soon left Argentina for his own country, in spite of the dangers to which his enterprises would subject him. He immediately brought together a goodly number of followers, and with them carried on a guerrilla warfare in the province of Colchagua, thus paving the way for SanÂ MartÃ­n. After Cancha Rayada, his presence of mind and his forceful character, with his example of energy and enthusiasm, reacted on the people and he was able to form a nucleus of resistance which contributed to the triumph of the Chilean forces at MaipÃº. In this battle he led a troop called the \"Hussars of Death.\" Other military leaders, jealous of his popularity and prestige, charged him with adhesion to Carrera. He was arrested Â p513Â and was being conducted to trial when he was assassinated by members of his guard, supposedly under secret orders from the government. â E,Â LI,Â 1268; F,Â V,Â 686.\n\nZorÃ³babel RodrÃ­guez Benavides (1839â1901) was born in Quillota and educated in the church schools of Valparaiso and Santiago. He carried on his law studies in the university section of National Institute, receiving his degree inÂ 1864, but began writing for the press the preceding year and also published his first novel, an imitation of Cervantes. InÂ 1864 he joined with the AmunÃ¡tegui brothers and AbdÃ³n Cifuentes in publishing ElÂ independente, which soon became the leading conservative paper, and inÂ 1867 RodrÃ­guez assumed sole charge of it. In addition to twenty years' service as editor of that publication, he served as many years as deputy in congress, closely associated with the conservative leader Manuel JosÃ© IrarrÃ¡zaval (see p362Â n) . InÂ 1872 he published a study of Bilbao which aroused bitter controversy. Domingo Arteaga Alemparte characterized him as a true journalist, but one censurable for his vindictive and ironical tendency. He published a notable Diccionario deÂ chilenismos (Santiago, 1875), and Tratado deÂ economÃ­a polÃ­tica (Valparaiso, 1894), much used both in Chile and in other republics, and other economic works. â F,Â V,Â 680; Justo and Domingo Arteaga Alemparte, op.Â cit., pp121â126.\n\nLuis RodrÃ­guez Velasco (1839â1919) was the son of JosÃ© Antonio RodrÃ­guez (F,Â V,Â 676â677). Educated at the National Institute, he began his literary career inÂ 1859 as collaborator on the review LaÂ semana (see p350). InÂ 1865 he engaged in editorial work in Peru against the aggressions of Spain and on his return to Chile published his first book of poems. He edited numerous satirical and radical publications in association with the Arteaga Alemparte brothers (see p350) and produced plays that were well received. InÂ 1888 he was elected senator. His version of Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas is considered one of the best in Spanish. He composed several stirring songs during the war with Peru, and has indeed been proclaimed one of the best poets of Hispanic America. â F,Â V,Â 678.\n\nJosÃ© Santiago RodrÃ­guez Zorrilla (1752â1832) was born at Santiago. After completing his ecclesiastical studies and holding minor church and educational offices, he became bishop inÂ 1816. Because of his strong attachment to the Spanish government, he was twice exiled and died in Madrid before he could return to Chile, but his ashes were taken to Santiago twenty years after his death. â E,Â LI,Â 1322; F,Â V,Â 693; M,Â pp756â759.\n\nJosÃ© Antonio Rojas Uturguren (1732â1817) was born in Santiago and educated in the University of SanÂ Felipe, where his scientific bent Â p514Â early manifested itself. As heir to an entailed estate he was early given military rank and served with distinction on the frontiers of Chile. When President Amat was transferred to Peru as viceroy, Rojas accompanied him as adviser and also filled subordinate military and civil offices. InÂ 1770 he went to Spain to obtain royal permission to wed the daughter of a Peruvian officeholder. He achieved his purpose after eight years but the mortifying experience with official corruption and delay destroyed his loyalty to the king. He returned to Chile inÂ 1780, bringing with him a library and modest scientific equipment that gained for him a doubtful reputation among his contemporaries. Becoming imbued with liberal ideas, he took part in the conspiracy planned by the Frenchmen, Berney and Gramusset. Although on detection his two companions were seized and punished, Rojas was not molested, doubtless because the authorities hesitated to proceed against one of so high a social position. His part in the preliminaries of independence sent him into exile on Juan FernÃ¡ndez Island and the hardships suffered there hastened his death. â E,Â LI,Â 1397; M,Â p759; F,Â V,Â 703.\n\nDiego deÂ Rosales (1601â1677), born in Madrid, was already filling a university chair byÂ 1626. Coming to Peru about that time, he went to Chile inÂ 1629 and shortly thereafter took part in battles with the Indians. He then devoted himself to peaceful but dangerous missionary work and accompanied the MarquÃ©s deÂ Baides in the negotiations that resulted in the Pact of QuillÃ­n (see p90). He continued his missionary work until it was broken up by the infamous Salazar brothers (see p112). He also did heroic work at ConcepciÃ³n in the earthquake ofÂ 1657 and headed the Jesuit college there. FromÂ 1666 toÂ 1674 he was writing his most famous work, Historia general delÂ reÃ­no deÂ Chile, which was not published until two centuries after (Valparaiso, 1878), when the manuscript came into the possession of BenjamÃ­n VicuÃ±a Mackenna. Another work of his, LaÂ conquista espiritual deÂ Chile, relating to the lives and work of the Jesuits, has far less merit. FromÂ 1666 toÂ 1672 he was rector of the Colegio MÃ¡ximo at Santiago. Even old age and infirmity could not diminish his zeal in converting the Indians. His historical work is his greatest monument. â B,Â LII,Â 340; M,Â pp764â767. See also Medina, Historia deÂ laÂ literatura colonial deÂ Chile, Vol.Â II, chap.Â vii.\n\nJuan Enrique Rosales Fuentes (17?â1825) was the son of a Spanish merchant; but his mother was a Chilean, Margarita Fuentes yÂ Solar. Through his own marriage he was connected with the powerful LarraÃ­n clan. As a youth he spent several years on the Peninsula. ByÂ 1801 he was established in Santiago and in July,Â 1808, he was elected to the cabildo of Santiago as one of the twelve representatives of the Â p515Â colonial aristocracy. When named as a member of the junta inÂ 1810, his knowledge of politics and of human nature, coupled with his experience in Spain, probably made him its most brilliant member. He was a member of the tribunal that condemned Lieutenant Colonel TomÃ¡s deÂ Figueroa and was exiled to Juan FernÃ¡ndez. â B,Â VIII,Â 29, 317; F,Â V,Â 713.\n\nJuan Manuel deÂ Rosas (1793â1877), the Argentine dictator, received a mediocre education and hence always distrusted men of learning. He volunteered for service against the English during their second attack on Buenos Aires and then entered upon a training in ranch life which gave him the characteristic qualities of the Gaucho â strength, agility, and cleverness. In the welter of party strife was marked the decade of the twenties, Rosas, who had now become a leader among the plainsmen, at first followed Dorrego. After the latter's death he turned his arms against Lavalle and after defeating him became governor of the province of Buenos Aires. At first regarded with favor by those who hoped for a moderate but orderly government, he adopted a despotic course that alienated the better classes of the population. Secure in the support of the masses, he was granted the exercise of all the powers of government and, aided by his force of assassins known as the mazorca, he carried on his tyrannous regime for twenty-three years, until a combination of domestic foes, aided by contingents from Uruguay and Brazil, overthrew him in the battle of Monte Caseros on FebruaryÂ 3, 1852. He spent the remainder of his life in England. Despite his tyranny, he must be given credit for establishing the federal system of government in Argentina. â E,Â LII,Â 377. See also E.Â Quesada, LaÂ Ã©poca deÂ Rosas (Buenos Aires, 1898) and W.Â S.Â Robertson, \"Foreign Estimates of the Argentine Dictator Juan Manuel Rosas\" in Hisp. Amer. Hist. Rev., XÂ (May,Â 1930), 125â137 .\n\nGustavo Ross SantaÂ MarÃ­a (1879âÂ ) was born in Valparaiso. He is of Scotch Chilean descent and related to the Edwards family. In business from his youth, especially coal mining, he has also acquired a reputation as a speculator. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the senate inÂ 1924 and was banished inÂ 1927. InÂ 1932 his appointment as minister of the treasury aroused both hope and distrust. His friends strongly supported his financial policy and it must be said that he did much to reÃ«stablish the credit of the country. InÂ 1936 he resigned his office and went to Paris, ostensibly to push the sales of Chilean nitrate, but really to await the political campaign ofÂ 1938. In this contest he failed to gain the coveted presidency. â F,Â V,Â 717; Hoy, DecemberÂ 23, 1932, p8; AugustÂ 13, 1936, p12.\n\nMartÃ­n Ruiz deÂ Gamboa (b.Â 1531) came to America after service in Â p516Â the Levant and inÂ 1552 went to Chile. He served with varying success in the Araucanian wars, was made lieutenant by Governor Rodrigo deÂ Quiroga, and in that capacity founded the town of Castro on the island of ChiloÃ©. His patron inÂ 1577 left him as governor adÂ interim and the king, four years later, confirmed him in that post. He acquired a reputation as \"aÂ good soldier, a careful administrator, a diligent warrior,\" notable for his gallantry, courtesy, and liberality, feared by malefactors and beloved by men of good repute. The ordinance that bears his name was adopted upon the insistence of the king and provided for a personal tribute of nine pesos annually from each Indian in the bishopric of Santiago and seven pesos in the bishopric of Imperial. The greater part of this tribe was to be paid to the encomenderos. The ordinance aroused so much opposition that church penalties were necessary to enforce it, and the Indians, unable to pay in money, had their tribute reduced to a labor basis. â B,Â III,Â 8â11; M,Â pp774â776.\n\nFrancisco Ruiz Tagle Portales (d.Â 1860), proprietor of an entailed estate in LosÂ Andes, was deputy from that community in the congress ofÂ 1811 and an active participant in the program of that body. Nevertheless he was not proscribed during the Spanish reconquest, but held municipal offices in Santiago under the restored regime and as governor adÂ interim delivered the city to the patriots after Chacabuco. After MaipÃº (and a forced contribution to the cause), he again became an avowed patriot, holding various local and congressional offices during the disturbed years that followed the abdication of O'Higgins. On the eve of Lircay (see p236) he was selected by Portales as president adÂ interim, but soon resigned. Thereafter, he was not active politically. Barros Arana (B,Â XV,Â 374, etÂ seq.) discusses at some length the constitutional question involved in the election ofÂ 1828. See also F,Â V,Â 730.\n\nJosÃ© Santos Salas (18Â â) was a military surgeon who had had some practical experience in Spain beforeÂ 1920. He took a prominent part in the revolution ofÂ 1925 and after the return of Alessandri served as minister of hygiene. In this post he gained considerable popularity by favoring better and cheaper dwellings for laborers â aÂ popularity which failed to bring him into the presidency. But his conservative opponent, Emiliano Figueroa LarraÃ­n, was then elected. Under IbÃ¡Ã±ez inÂ 1927 he again served as minister of hygiene and, as adÂ interim minister of education and justice, favored educational reforms that could not be carried out because of lack of funds. He was forced out of office inÂ 1928 and has since resided in Italy. â Hoy, FebruaryÂ 19, 1936, p21.\n\nManuel deÂ Salas CorvalÃ¡n (1755â1841), Chilean politician and economist, was born in Santiago. He early filled municipal and other local offices and as a member of the tribunal deÂ consulado prepared inÂ Â p517Â 1796 a valuable memorial on the economic state of Chile, based on the views of Adam Smith. This was published for the first time inÂ 1843. Salas was well known as a sincere patriot and philanthropist of advanced ideas and of untiring activity. He worked unceasingly to encourage agriculture, mining, industry, and education, and was largely instrumental in the founding of the Hospicio (orphanage), the AcademÃ­a deÂ SanÂ Luis, the National Institute, and the National Library. â M,Â p794; E,Â LIII,Â 163; B,Â VII,Â 369, n.Â 9. AÂ portrait of him appears inÂ B, fa­cingÂ p224.\n\nDario Enrique Salas DÃ­az (1881âÂ ) was born in Imperial and educated in the normal schools of ChillÃ¡n and in the Pedagogic Institute in Santiago. InÂ 1907 he received the doctor's degree in pedagogy from Colombia University, where his daughter later obtained the same degree. The father became professor of pedagogy inÂ 1908 in the Normal School of Santiago and later in the Pedagogic Institute, and translated educational books. InÂ 1918 he became director-general of primary education, and as such was largely instrumental in securing the adoption of a law of compulsory instruction. Under his direction there was a great improvement in the quality of teaching and marked increase in enrollment in primary schools, and in the number and quality of school buildings. He was especially interested in matters of health and in the pay and training of teachers. He carried through these betterments in spite of much opposition. InÂ 1927 he sent twenty-four teachers abroad on special missions to the United States and Europe in order to make a general survey of all aspects of education. InÂ 1929 he was sent on a special tour of study to the United States and Europe, and inÂ 1931 he was elected dean of the faculty of philosophy and social sciences of the University of Chile, but later resigned. At presentÂ (1940) he is teaching in the Pedagogic Institute. â F,Â V,Â 746â748.\n\nJuan Francisco SÃ¡nchez (1757â?) was a native of Galicia. He began his military career at the age of sixteen. Twenty years later he was sent to ConcepciÃ³n, with the rank of captain. He was noted for his extreme fidelity to the royalist cause, and this quality, rather than his technical military knowledge or his general culture, led Pareja to designate him as his successor. â B,Â IX,Â 126.\n\nEulogio SÃ¡nchez ErrÃ¡zuriz (Â ?âÂ ) came into prominence inÂ 1932 as head of the Republican Militia. AÂ year after the dissolution of this force he sought to unite its elements under a new designation, AcciÃ³n nacional, opposing traditional party methods and the course of President Alessandri. â Hoy, OctoberÂ 29, 1936, p24.\n\nPedro Sancho deÂ Hoz (d.Â 1547) shared in the capture and despoiling of Atahualpa, wrote an account of that event, as secretary to Â p518Â Pizarro and then returned to his municipal post and a lucrative marriage in Toledo, Spain. InÂ 1539 he obtained permission to make discoveries in the region below the grants to Pizarro and Almagro, which enabled him to thrust himself upon Valdivia and plot against his associate, thereby bringing about his own execution (see p43).Âº â M,Â p803.\n\nEnrique Salvador Sanfuentes Andonaegui (1848âÂ ), son of the illustrious poet, Salvador Sanfuentes (see below), was born in Santiago, studied in the National Institute and the university, and received his degree in law inÂ 1870. He practiced his profession, amassed a fortune in business, interested himself in educational problems, and inÂ 1888 entered congress as deputy from Rancagua. As minister under Balmaceda he furthered many notable works of that administration. His nomination as minister of the interior inaugurated the chain of events that brought on the civil war ofÂ 1891. Nevertheless he later parted company with Balmaceda and failed to support that chief in the struggle with congress. After the war he headed the liberal-democratic party that continued Balmaceda's policy and later served as minister to France. â F,Â V,Â 766â768.\n\nJuan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui (1858âÂ ), of a distinguished Santiago family, was educated in the University of Chile and received his license as advocate inÂ 1879. After brief service in the navy during the war with Peru and Bolivia, he engaged in business and became deputy inÂ 1888. AÂ friend of Balmaceda, after the death of that leader he carried on fortunate speculations in the Santiago stock exchange, reÃ«ntered politics inÂ 1900, became senator inÂ 1903, and minister of the treasury during the Riesco administration. He was also counselor of the Caja deÂ crÃ©dito hipotecario (Mortgage Loan Bank) and the Savings Bank. An expert in financial affairs, he was also a skillful political manager, making and unmaking ministers almost at will. As president he was to take many a dose of his own medicine. Yet he succeeded in redu­cing materially the public debt, and in pushing through a program of useful public works. In the election of his successor, he maintained a strict neutrality. Never popular, despite his unaffected manners and skill in controlling others, he passed out of office with fewer friends than when he entered. â F,Â V,Â 762â765; Cabero, Chile yÂ losÂ chilenos, p244.\n\nSalvador Sanfuentes Torres (1817â1860) was the son of a Santiago merchant of Spanish connection. Educated at the National Institute and under the tutelage of AndrÃ©s Bello (see p453), he received his law degree inÂ 1842. From his youth he studied languages and literature and early became favorably known for his translations from Latin, Â p519Â English and French. AÂ painter of some note, he published texts on geography and drawing and wrote a critical analysis of Ercilla's Araucana. As an associate of Lastarria he published in ElÂ seminario deÂ Santiago inÂ 1842 a versified legend, ElÂ campanario, which marked a new departure in Chilean literature. As secretary of the university (1842â1852), he edited its memorials, twice served as minister of public instruction, during which time he strove to improve the system of public schools, and inÂ 1856 was elected dean of the faculty of philosophy and humanities in the university. In addition he held various diplomatic and judicial offices, including member­ship in the supreme court of justice, and collaborated on various scientific and literary reviews. His poetry and prose have merited high praise. â E,Â LIII,Â 1325; F,Â V,Â 765â766; M.Â L.Â AmunÃ¡tegui, BiografÃ­a deÂ D.Â Salvador Sanfuentes (Santiago, 1892).\n\nAndrÃ©s SantaÂ Cruz (1792â1865), member of an illustrious Spanish family of Villavicencio, and reputed descendant of the Incas, was born in LaÂ Paz. After serving in the royalist ranks untilÂ 1820, he joined the revolutionists under SanÂ MartÃ­n, took part in the battle of Pichincha under Sucre, and inÂ 1823 was made a general of division in Peru. As chief of the general staff of BolÃ­var, he participated in the battles of JunÃ­n and Ayacucho. Entrusted with a diplomatic mission to Chile, he was quickly recalled to military service in Peru and for a time served as president adÂ interimÂ (1826). InÂ 1829 he succeeded Sucre as president of Bolivia and devoted himself with energy and enthusiasm to the task of rehabilitating his native country, and later of incorporating it with Peru in a powerful confederation. Unfortunately his intrigues had stirred up powerful enemies as well as friends and, although he initiated important measures to improve the industries, the educational system, and the public finance of Bolivia, his opponents in Peru, aided by Chile, defeated him and forced him into exile. After an attempt to recover power inÂ 1843, he spent his remaining days in a kind of diplomatic exile in Europe. InÂ 1861 he negotiated the concordat between Bolivia and the papacy and inÂ 1863, a commercial treaty with France, in which country he died. Documents relating to his career, collected by his son, were published at LaÂ Paz inÂ 1925 under the title, ElÂ General SantaÂ Cruz, gran mariscal deÂ Zepita yÂ delÂ gran PerÃº. â E,Â XLIV,Â 180. For an unfavorable account of SantaÂ Cruz, see Sotomayor ValdÃ©s, Historia deÂ Chile, Vol.Â II, chaps.Â xix, xxiii, passim.\n\nDomingo SantaÂ MarÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez (1825â1889) was born in Santiago, in a family of distinguished Spanish and colonial lineage. Educated in the National Institute and later in the University of Chile, he first taught in the former, at the same time pursuing his legal studies and Â p520Â serving as subordinate in the ministry of justice and public instruction. He received his degree as attorney at law inÂ 1847, presenting as his thesis, Reforma deÂ laÂ ley electoral deÂ 1833 (Reform of the Electoral Law ofÂ 1833). He supported the reÃ«lection of General Bulnes with tongue and pen and as a reward was appointed, although under legal age, intendant of Colchagua. Success crowned the efforts of the precocious administrator, who thus early displayed his ability to arouse and overcome opposition and to gain popularity, but not to keep it. AÂ liberal by nature, he sought to maintain orderly progress but was inclined to change his course; his moderation, however, did not save him from proscription under Montt. During this decade, he served on the university faculty of philosophy and humanities, wrote his memoirs of O'Higgins and Infante (see p230), gained reputation as an orator, and while in exile visited Europe and pleaded the cause of a fellow countryman in the English courts. Recalled to Chile during the administration of PÃ©rez, he became minister of hacienda and later minister of the court of appeals. InÂ 1865 he was entrusted with a diplomatic mission to Europe during the war with Spain, and also helped organize the plan of defense agreed upon with Peru. PÃ©rez appointed him to the supreme court. During the War of the Pacific he held three important cabinet posts, including that of war and marine. In the last capacity he effected important changes in the commanding posts and paved the way for his own accession to the presidency. As chief magistrate he helped to liquidate the war and to push to a conclusion certain \"theological\" questions (see p339), as well as to stir up numerous other political controversies. Thus his administration was the most stormy since that of Montt. After his retirement he edited the CÃ³digo deÂ enjuiciamiento civil (Code of Civil Procedure). As a politician he was energetic, approachable, adept in management, and one who could wait patiently his turn for preferment. â F,Â V,Â 780â782.\n\nHernando deÂ SantillÃ¡n (1519â1574) was a member of the audiencia of Lima inÂ 1548 and served Hurtado deÂ Mendoza as justicia mayor and deputy inÂ 1557. Four years later he resumed his duties as oidorÂ in Lima. InÂ 1564 he was deputized to establish the audiencia at Quito where he ruled tyrannically and was subjected to a heavy fine, subsequently reduced at court. InÂ 1571 he was designated bishop of Charcas (Upper Peru) but died at Lima before he could take possession of his see. â Medina, Dic. biog., p812. The ordinance mentioned in the text does not exist in its original form but in summaries given by the chronicler Diego deÂ Rosales and SuÃ¡rez deÂ Figueroa. â B,Â II,Â 223, n.Â 19; L.Â B.Â Simpson, The Encomienda in New Spain. It established the principle of laboring in succession, the quota from a tribe being one sixth for work in the Â p521Â mines and one fifth for work in the fields. The master must furnish the laborers with meat three times aÂ week and might require limited service only from women and minors. He must furnish medical care and religious instruction for the laborers and their families. The system failed because the masters opposed it and because the Indians were naturally lazy. â B,Â II,Â 223â225.\n\nDomingo Faustino Sarmiento (1811â1888) was born at SanÂ Juan deÂ laÂ Frontera, Argentina, but was taken to Chile by his parents in the wake of SanÂ MartÃ­n. His earlier life alternated between Argentina and Chile, where for a time he engaged in trade and mining. His business experience, supplemented by his early training, his classroom activities, and his newspaper work gave him a reputation for vast learning â aÂ reputation that was increased by enforced exile and wide travel. He spent two periods of exile in Chile, where he was instrumental in founding and directing the first normal school for men and in writing for ElÂ mercurio. His interest in politics brought him into difficulty even in his adopted country. He returned to Argentina inÂ 1852 to take up arms against Rosas and later to assist in developing the political and educational systems of his native country, serving as senator, minister of state, and minister plenipotentiary in Paris and Washington. Horace Mann was an intimate friend who greatly influenced Sarmiento's educational policy and Mrs.Â Mann translated his chief novel, Facundo. InÂ 1868 Sarmiento became president of Argentina, and during his administration his chief work was still in the educational field. He died in AsunciÃ³n, Paraguay, where he had gone to regain his health. â E,Â LIV,Â 605â607; Coester, op.Â cit., pp125â135, 198â199.\n\nLorenzo Sazie (1807â1865) was born at Monpezat, France. After completing his medical studies and hospital training at Paris, where he acquired a brilliant reputation as a surgeon, he was invited inÂ 1833 to become professor of medicine in Chile. Here he became famous not only for his skill in diagnosis and in surgery, but for his preference to minister to the poorer classes. He was more renowned as a teacher than as a medical writer. His son, Carlos Sazie Heredia, was a noted specialist in nervous diseases and another son, an electrical engineer, did much to advance radio telephony in Chile. â F,Â V,Â 789â790.\n\nAlexander Selkirk (1672â1721), the proto­type of Robinson Crusoe, was rescued on JanuaryÂ 31, 1709, from Juan FernÃ¡ndez Island. InÂ 1703 he had joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas as sailing captain under Thomas Stradling. AÂ quarrel between them resulted in Selkirk's remaining on Juan FernÃ¡ndez, from which he was rescued by an English vessel under command of Dampier. After returning to England and relating his experiences, Captain Woodes Rogers wrote AÂ Â p522Â Cruising Voyage round the World (London, 1712), the second edition of which inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe. The fullest account of his adventures, based on contemporary narratives, was written by John Howell, The Life and Adventures of Alexander Selkirk (Edinburgh, 1829).\n\nIgnacio Serrano Montaner (d.Â 1879) was a native of Melipilla. InÂ 1865 he entered the Naval School, where he proved an alert and distinguished pupil. Within aÂ few years after completing his course, he became a lieutenant and served as instructor on the Esmeralda. InÂ 1879 he was serving on another vessel but was transferred to the Esmeralda in time for his glorious sacrifice. Even when mortally wounded he is credited with an attempt in his last moments to set fire to the HuÃ¡scar. His remains rest under the same monument as those of Prat. â F,Â V,Â 812â813.\n\nBartholomew Sharpe had started on his expedition inÂ 1679 and, upon his return to England inÂ 1682, he was tried for piracy in connection with the capture of a Spanish vessel, the Rosario. He was acquitted on the ground that the Spaniards had fired first and he had therefore acted in self defense. The best account of his expeditions was written by his companion, Basil Ringrose, in his Dangerous Voyage and Bold Attempts of Capt.Â Bartholomew Sharpe, 1684, which is reprinted in John Esquemeling, The Buccaneers of America (London, 1893), Pt.Â IV, pp275â502. AÂ summarized account of the operations of these pirates in the West Indies is given by ClarenceÂ H. Haring in The Buccaneers in the West Indies in the 17thÂ Century (London, 1910). Haring also lists the different editions of Esquemeling.\n\nWaldo Silva AlgÃ¼e (1820â1892) was born in Santiago. He studied in the National Institute and in the university, where he obtained his law degree inÂ 1843. FromÂ 1856 toÂ 1867 he served as minister of public instruction and during his ministry formed the library of the institute, organized instruction in sculpture and drawing, replaced the course in Spanish civil law with one in the civil code of Chile, and established various liceos and popular libraries. AfterÂ 1860 he was a member of the court of appeals in ConcepciÃ³n. InÂ 1891 as president of the senate he helped head the revolt against Balmaceda (see p346). â F,Â V,Â 817â818.\n\nJorge Gustavo Silva Endeiza (1881âÂ ) was trained in the lyceums of LaÂ Serena and Valparaiso and completed his law studies inÂ 1921. He became advocate inÂ 1929. From his earliest years he had been engaged in newspaper work and later was connected with public administration, principally connected with labor issues. While residing and working in Santiago, he contributed to the press of Valparaiso and Â p523Â ConcepciÃ³n. His articles were generally of a sociological character. By inheritance and training he has been closely allied with the literary interests of the country. â F,Â V,Â 827.\n\nJosÃ© Antonio Soffia Agromedo (1843â1886) was born in Santiago and educated at the National Institute. One of the most brilliant pupils of AndrÃ©s Bello, he published his first poems inÂ 1863 and thereafter continued to produce verse that gained recognition both in Chile and in Colombia, where he served as minister for six years, contributing widely to the press of that country, as well as his own, and influencing profoundly the literary expression of both countries. Like other contemporary South American poets he published many translations from Victor Hugo. His swift, critical, yet kindly genius captivated any social circle with which he was connected. His early promise gained for him six years in the director­ship of the National Library. Later he served in congress, and as school inspector, as oficial mayor in the ministry of the interior, as intendant of Aconcagua, and as minister to Colombia, where diplomatically and socially he made a favorable impression. He died suddenly just as he was designated minister to Argentina. â F,Â V,Â 848â849.\n\nEmilio Sotomayor Baeza (1823â1894) was born in Melipilla, educated in the Military School, and entered the artillery inÂ 1845. He supported the government in the uprisings against Manuel Montt, wrote widely on military topics, and before the War of the Pacific was sent to Europe to obtain better equipment for the army. In that conflict he contributed to Chilean success, particularly in the battle of Dolores (NovemberÂ 19, 1879) and in the fighting around Lima. He was political chief of that city while the Chilean army occupied it. â F,Â V,Â 856â857."
