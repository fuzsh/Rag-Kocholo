        "text": "Viceroyalty of New Spain, the first of the four viceroyalties that Spain created to govern its conquered lands in the New World. Established in 1535, it initially included all land north of the Isthmus of Panama under Spanish control. This later came to include upper and lower California, the area that is now the central and southwestern portion of the United States, and territory eastward along the Gulf of Mexico to Florida. The Viceroyalty of New Spain was also charged with governing Spain’s Caribbean possessions. Later, in 1565, the newly conquered Philippines were also placed under the jurisdiction of New Spain.\n\nAlthough technically superior in governing authority, the viceroy in New Spain was hampered in practice from exerting that authority by the considerable independence of governors and royal audiencias in many of the subordinate areas. His power was largely confined to central and southern Mexico—from San Luis Potosí in the north to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south. Within this territory, the viceroys of New Spain aided in converting the Native population to Christianity, developed an array of educational institutions, and oversaw an economy based almost entirely on mining and ranching. During the first 100 years of Spanish rule, the Indigenous population of New Spain declined from an estimated 25 million to 1 million as a result of maltreatment, disease, and disruption of their cultures.\n\nThe first viceroy in New Spain was Antonio de Mendoza, who ruled from 1535 to 1549, then served as viceroy of Peru, where he died after one year in office. In New Spain, he dispatched Francisco Coronado on his expedition northward while ameliorating some of the worst abuses of the conquistadores. He supported the church in its work with the Native population.\n\nAfter a period of decline in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Viceroyalty of New Spain took on new life when refreshed by two distinguished men: Antonio María de Bucareli (1771–79) and Juan Vicente de Güemes Pacheco de Padilla, 2° conde de Revillagigedo (1789–94). Wanting to strengthen Spain’s presence in California because the Russian and British governments were showing interest in colonizing the region, the former leader granted permission to Spanish explorer and military commander Juan Bautista de Anza II in 1775 to lead settlers on an overland route from the Sonoran Desert to the coast of California, and the latter leader was the last able viceroy in New Spain."
