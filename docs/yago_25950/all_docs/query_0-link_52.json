        "text": "Writer-director Frank D Gilroy’s engrossing 1971 drama Desperate Characters stars Shirley MacLaine in a very remarkable performance as Sophie Bentwood, a depressed, frigid New York housewife living in the East Side suburbs, married to the more optimistic Otto (Kenneth Mars).\n\nThough very well acted and satisfyingly articulate, this dramatic portrait of a middle-class, childless marriage in trouble and the pressures of city life, based on a novel by Paula Fox, is a depressing downer of a movie. But the quality is there on screen.\n\nIt is made in New York City, but is British-backed by Lew Grade’s Incorporated Television Company (ITC), which did not show it in UK cinemas. Home video and TV saved it from oblivion. Paramount Home Video released it on VHS in the US and CBS first showed it on American TV in 1980.\n\nAlso in the cast are Kenneth Mars, Sada Thompson, Gerald S O’Loughlin, Jack Somack, Carol Kane, Chris Gampel, Mary Alan Hokanson, Robert Bauer, Michael Higgins, Michael McAloney and Rose Gregorio.\n\nDesperate Characters is directed by Frank D Gilroy, runs 106 minutes, is made by Incorporated Television Company (ITC) and T.D.J. Productions Inc, is released by Paramount Pictures (1971) (US), is written by Frank D Gilroy, based on a novel by Paula Fox, is shot by Urs Furrer (Eastmancolor), is produced by Frank D Gilroy and Paul Leaf, is scored by Lee Konitz, Ron Carter and James Hall and is designed by Edgar Lansbury.\n\nThe $1.5 million budget was cut to $400,000, slashing costs by using lightweight cameras, halving the crew in half and persuading the main actors to take a percentage of the film in lieu of salary.\n\nMacLaine also made The Possession of Joel Delaney (1971) for Lord Lew Grade’s ITC company in return for making a TV show, Shirley’s World (1971-1972).\n\n© Derek Winnert 2020 Classic Movie Review 10,247"
