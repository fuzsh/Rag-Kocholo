        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThis collection is furnished with an introduction from the author followed by fifteen original one-act plays.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nFrank D. Gilroy is a playwright, novelist, television writer, screen writer, director, and independent filmmaker. His awards include a Pulitzer Prize, a Tony Award and Drama Critics Award for The Subject Was Roses. His play Who'll Save the Plowboy? won th eObie for Best American Play of the Year. Desperate Characters, which he wrote and directed, won two Silver Bears at the Berlin Film Festival. Born and raised in the Bronx, he graduated from Dartmouth (courtesy of the GI bill) after service in World War II. He is a past president of the Dramatist Guild.\n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nBest known for the poignant family drama The Subject Was Roses (1964), which won him the Pulitzer Prize, the Tony Award, and the Drama Critics Circle Award, eminent playwright Gilroy presents seven full-length plays and 15 one-act plays in this two-volume anthology. Aside from Roses, the six full-length plays in Volume 1 include Who'll Save the Plowboy? (1962), an Obie Award winner; That Summer That Fall (1967); The Only Game in Town (1968); Last Licks (1979); Any Given Day (1993); and Contact with the Enemy (1999), a Drama Desk nominee. These plays all center on relationships either within close-knit family, between men and women, or between friends, comrades, or colleagues. Gilroy's keen observation of human nature is seen in his unflinching search for reality without sentimentality. His quick wit and poignant dialogs enhance the dramatic impact. The 15 one-act plays in the second volume were written between 1957 and 1999, mostly for Ensemble Studio Theatre Marathon productions in New York City. These plays reflect Gilroy's personal experiences. For example, Twas Brillig (1972), Real to Reel (1987), Give the Bishop My Faint Regards (1992), and Fore (1993) dramatize his screen-writing career, The Viewing (1957) his war experience, and Getting In (1957) his effort to enter Dartmouth College on the GI Bill. For each play, Gilroy gives the cast, director, and costumes, scenery, and lighting designers of the original production, an introduction tracing the creative process of the play, and excerpts from reviews. Gilroy's comprehensive coverage and introductions to his own works make this two-volume anthology a worthy acquisition for all public and academic libraries.DMing-ming Shen Kuo, Ball State Univ.
