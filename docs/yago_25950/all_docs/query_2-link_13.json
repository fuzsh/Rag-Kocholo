        "text": "“What have you done for me recently? That’s part of the American ethic, and one just accepts it. Nothing’s old in America…It’s very tough, and if you start thinking that people owe you something, you can go around feeling very sorry for yourself.”\n\nWriter/director Frank D. Gilroy\n\nYou can file this under, “The fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree.”\n\nWhen you see the name Gilroy on a screenwriting blog the odds are good you first associate it with Oscar-nominated writer/director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) or Oscar-nominated screenwriter Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawlers).\n\nBut let’s put Frank D. Gilroy in the spotlight, because before he had two Hollywood screenwriter sons (and other—John Gilroy— who is two-time BAFTA-nominated editor) the elder Gilroy had quite a run. After serving in the Army during World War II he studied at Dartmouth College where he wrote his first plays (and ran the school newspaper) and then attended the Yale Drama School.\n\nHis play The Subject Was Roses opened on Broadway in 1964 and ran for 834 performances, and won the Drama Critics Award, the Tony Award for Best Play, and the Pulitzer Prize. (The play was also compared to Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night.)\n\nThe 1969 film version of The Subject Was Roses won actor Jack Albertson an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. While never reaching the level of success of that early play, the now 89-year-old Gilroy has written plays, novels, TV programs, and feature films for six decades. (He published a Kindle single just last year.) I don’t know if he ever passed on writing advice to his sons—say when Tony and Dan were writing The Bourne Legacy—but here’s some advice from him I found in an old interview:\n\n“The best rule I ever heard is: Please yourself, and hope you’ll please someone else. I know no other way to operate. I’m very open to opinion. In a movie, particularly, you have to be. I’ll change anything is someone can convince me that they have a better line, a better thought. But my starting point is always that I have to please myself. It stops you from going crazy, because to try to guess what critics are going to like, or what the public’s going to like, would be suicidal. I’d have nothing to cling to…Everything you do, if you do it wholeheartedly, changes you. And in the midst of changing, you should be very careful what you commit yourself to.”\n\nFrank D. Gilroy\n\nInterview with Dennis Brown published in Shoptalk\n\nP.S. If you go to Amazon you’ll find many of the elder Gilroy’s books and plays including a book on writing— Love and/or Money: Outtakes from a Life Spec, the Early Years which I’ll have to get. He writes in the introduction: “As the man introducing me at the Community College goes on about my loftier achievements and awards, the audience (kids from families straining so they can get a higher education) openly yawns. Scrapping my prepared remarks, I tell them 90 percent of my career has been failure. I’ve been dead broke six times and if I don’t sell something soon it’ll be seven.”\n\nOn the cover of that book there’s this quote from William Goldman, “The Best book on becoming a playwright since Moss Hart’s Act One.”"
