        "text": "Frank D. Gilroy was born on October 13, 1925, in the Bronx, New York, United States. He was the son of Frank Gilroy Sr., a renowned silent film and vaudeville actor, and Marie Gallagher, a stage actress. He is the grandson of Thomas Gilroy, an influential Irish-American politician. Despite his artistic background, Frank D. Gilroy initially considered a career in journalism, but soon turned to writing for theater and film.\n\nHis plays, notably “The Subject Was Roses”, “That Summer – That Fall”, and “Any Given Day” have earned him numerous awards, including the prestigious Tony Award in 1965. In addition to his career as a playwright, Gilroy has also wrote screenplays for the big screen, winning an Academy Award in 1968 for his play made into a film, “The Subject Was Roses.” He died on September 12, 2015, in Trenton, New Jersey, leaving behind a rich legacy in the world of theater and film."
