Gilroy's new film, you would consider yourself ''The Luckiest Man in the World'' - and begin to treat everyone better.\n\nWhat would you do if you had treated your friends poorly all your life, and then just missed a plane that crashed on takeoff? If you were the protagonist in Frank D. Gilroy's new film, you would consider yourself ''The Luckiest Man in the World'' - and begin to treat everyone better.\n\nBut in the film, the title character (Philip Bosco) discovers his acquaintances don't have faith in him to change. ''The Luckiest Man in the World,'' which opens Wednesday at the Carnegie Screening Room, is the exact opposite of the career of its writer-director, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his first Broadway play, ''The Subject Was Roses.'' Mr. Gilroy never changed his simple way of telling a story - and discovered the Hollywood studios didn't have faith in his stories.\n\nHe made them independently, away from the studio system. ''Luckiest Man'' is Mr. Gilroy's fourth such project, although he has written many scripts for studios. The movies he wrote and directed, such as ''The Gig'' (1985), are low profile, he says, and are not destined to be blockbusters, nor are they a mainstream producer's dream investment.\n\nMr. Gilroy laughs heartily as he explains that after the success of the first feature he directed, ''Desperate Characters'' (1971), with Shirley MacLaine, he figured everyone would clamor to produce his movies. So he wrote a screenplay about the summer he watched his second play being filmed. That script, ''Once in Paris,'' never was made by a studio, even though he took it to many producers.\n\n''I went to lunch with one guy who told me, 'I loved the script - here's why I'm not going to do it,' '' Mr. Gilroy says with a grimace. ''I told him that if a magic button could be pushed to guarantee his investment plus a sizable profit, he still wouldn't make the movie. We weren't in the same business.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
