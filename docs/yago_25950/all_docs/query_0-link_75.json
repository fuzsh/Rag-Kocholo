        "text": "One thing about Shirley MacLaine receiving the Mayor's Lifetime Achievement Award tonight at the 23rd Denver International Film Festival: Nobody could ever quibble with it.\n\nShe has, indeed, spent a lifetime in the movies. Her debut was in 1955's \"The Trouble With Harry\" and she has worked consistently since.\n\nBut she is not just being honored for her longevity and productivity. Among her credits are many influential and memorable films - \"Some Came Running,\" \"The Apartment,\" \"The Children's Hour,\" \"Two For the Seesaw,\" \"Irma La Douce,\" \"Sweet Charity,\" \"Two Mules For Sister Sara,\" \"Desperate Characters,\" \"The Turning Point,\" \"Being There,\" \"Terms of Endearment,\" \"Madame Sousatzka,\" \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Postcards From the Edge\" and more.\n\nShe has two new ones upcoming. One, \"Bruno,\" which she directed and which will be broadcast on Denver-based Starz/Encore cable service beginning Dec. 1, is screening this afternoon at the film festival. It is a comedy-drama about an 8-year-old boy; she also acts in it.\n\nThe other, which she just finished, is a comedy called \"These Old Broads,\" in which MacLaine shares billing with Joan Collins, Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n\"It's about actresses who get together after they've been stars in a huge bunch of pictures 40 years ago,\" MacLaine says during a telephone interview.\n\nWhen one of their films is re-released, it becomes a hit and they are asked to do a television special. Taylor plays the agent; the other three the stars. \"And of course we hate each other because of all kinds of things that went on before,\" MacLaine says. \"That's where the comedy comes from.\" MacLaine is gracious when asked to recall past movies. One, the obscure but powerful \"Desperate Characters\" from 1971, she remembers less than others. Written and directed by Frank Gilroy, it starred MacLaine and Kenneth Mars as a middle-class New York couple watching their world come apart from the societal rifts of the era. It went virtually unreleased at the time.\n\n\"I produced it and we did it for $200,000,\" she says. \"We had a problem with it because it was one of the first of what I guess you would say were independent (American) art films. It was really about the disintegration of cities, New York in particular, and it might have been a little ahead of its time.\"\n\nShe got her start in movies when a producer saw her in the 1954 Broadway musical \"Pajama Game.\" Soon, she was starring in Alfred Hitchcock's dark, perversely comic suspense film, \"The Trouble With Harry.\" \"I was 19, had just gotten married, was a Broadway dancer, and I didn't know anything about acting,\" she says. \"That's why (Hitchcock) liked me. He said there were less knots to undo. He didn't say much to actors. He'd often direct in Cockney, which would mean he'd walk up to me and say, \"Before you say that line, dog's feet.\" That means pause.\""
