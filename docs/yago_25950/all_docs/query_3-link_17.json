        "text": "For the Times Herald-Record\n\nWith the opening of \"Two For the Money\" tonight, a parade of former Orange County natives will light up the movie sky in coming weeks.\n\n\"Money\" was written and produced by Dan Gilroy, who graduated from Washingtonville High School. The son of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Frank D. Gilroy, he co-produced the movie with his wife, Rene Russo. The movie features Emmy-winner Armand Assante, a Cornwall High School graduate.\n\nThe parade began with \"Stealth,\" directed by Rob Cohen, who grew up in Newburgh. Although the movie flopped at the box office, even with the marquee name of Oscar- winner Jamie Foxx, there was high praise for its aerial scenes.\n\nHoward Shore isn't a native, but he's been living in Tuxedo Park for many years. A two-time Oscar-winner for composing the music for \"The Lord of the Rings,\" he's also the composer for the critically acclaimed \"A History of Violence,\" now playing at local theaters.\n\nArriving later this month on local screens, including Upstate Films in Rhinebeck, is \"Everything Is Illuminated,\" starring Elijah Wood. The luminously beautiful film has been edited by Craig McKay, a Valley Central and Orange County Community College graduate. McKay has twice been Oscar-nominated for his work (\"Reds\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\"). He's featured in an upcoming special 25th anniversary special DVD for \"Reds.\" Vogue Magazine is interviewing him next week for a special feature on the now-classic movie, which was directed by and stars Warren Beatty.\n\nAlso coming soon is \"I Walk the Line,\" the hotly anticipated movie about Johnny Cash. \"Line\" is the latest offering from director/writer James Mangold, who graduated from Washingtonville. When he was a senior in high school, Mangold created a film that was shown as part of the high school production of \"Li'l Abner.\" McKay worked with Mangold on his \"Copland,\" starring Sylvester Stallone. Mangold said he based his script on the influx of New York City cops into his hometown.\n\nAlthough not from Orange County, David Strathairn has lived near Poughkeepsie for more than 20 years. He's won advance raves for his portrayal of Edward R. Murrow in the George Clooney-directed \"Good Night, and Good Luck,\" which opens today in exclusive showings in New York before opening wide.\n\nAnd the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman is already the front-runner in this year's Oscar sweepstakes for his title portrayal in \"Capote.\" Truman Capote attended the New York Military Academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson. His famous short story \"A Christmas Memory\" was written from that perspective.\n\n— —\n\n— —\n\n— — ::::::"
