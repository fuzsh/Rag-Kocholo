        "text": "The five members of the Buck Bowers Gang ride into deserted Gladstone City. One of the men, Graham Dorsey, is unnerved by the silence, but their leader shows little concern. The gang bursts through the doors of the bank with their guns drawn, but find it empty. Two members, “The Mexican” and “Ape,” want to leave, until Buck finds an unguarded cache of money. As they ride out of town, gun barrels protrude from windows. Buck tells his men to remain calm, but when “Boy,” the youngest member of the gang, signals his horse to gallop, the guns fire. Within seconds, the entire gang is dead, except Graham, who has a gun pointed directly at him. Yelling, Graham awakens himself and the rest of his gang, realizing he was only having a nightmare. Boy asks about the dream, but Graham refuses to discuss it. The next day, as the gang rides to Gladstone City, Graham’s horse breaks its leg and has to be shot. He shares Boy’s horse until the gang happens upon an isolated Victorian mansion. The owner, Amanda Starbuck, sees the men approaching as the clock strikes twelve noon. She ignores them, hoping they will leave. However, Buck says that they saw her at the window, then asks if she can sell them a horse, but Amanda says that the servants have taken her horses for the day. When they don’t believe her, she claims that a cow is responsible for the noise coming from the barn. Graham investigates and finds a horse, but he corroborates Amanda’s story. Ape is suspicious, and Graham, angry at being called a liar, reaches for his gun. Buck breaks up the fight and tells Graham that they will be back by three o’clock. When the gang has left, Amanda thanks Graham for not taking the horse, which she describes as her “dearest pet.” Graham describes himself as a Southern gentleman who fought with General Lee, forced to become an outlaw after killing a carpetbagger. Amanda has been a widow for two years, and her only companions are her servants, Sam and Edna. When Graham asks to search the house, she complies and gives him a tour. They visit several elegantly furnished rooms, including the music room and the master bedroom, neither of which have been disturbed since Mr. Starbuck died. Graham criticizes Amanda for hiding from the world while “in the bloom of life” and kisses her. Amanda feels faint and asks for some brandy, but when Graham returns, she is holding a gun. Unfazed, Graham gradually erodes Amanda’s resolve, especially when he determines that she is expecting company. He takes her gun away and searches under her dress for hidden weapons, shredding her underwear in the process. Amanda stoically submits to Graham, declaring that she will not move until he is finished. However, the seduction is interrupted by a visit from Reverend Cabot. Amanda makes an excuse and sends him away. When she returns to the bedroom, Graham is despondent over his impotence, caused by the death of the woman he loved seven years earlier. Amanda is sympathetic and successfully reignites his desire. Afterward, they tell each other their names and both admit that they may be in love. Later, they go swimming in a pond. Graham tells of the many robberies committed by the Bowers gang, and falls into the pond while trying to pick a flower for her. She gives him access to her husband’s clothes, from which he chooses a tuxedo and a top hat. When he enters the dining room, Amanda, wearing a red gown, makes a toast “to these few hours which have redeemed my life.” After lunch, they dance in the music room as the music box plays a waltz, while Amanda offers to set Graham up in business. Their dance is interrupted by Cody Taylor, her neighbor’s son, who witnessed a failed robbery committed by the Bowers gang. He tells Amanda that the Mexican was killed and the remaining gang members are to be hanged at five o’clock. After Cody leaves, Graham smiles broadly at being free from the Bowers gang. However, Amanda believes he should try to rescue them. Graham explains that any such attempt would be suicide. Amanda offers her horse, which Graham rides toward town, still wearing the tuxedo. Once out of sight, he looks for a place to take a nap, but is chased by an approaching posse. Graham comes upon a traveling dentist named Dr. Finger and demands a clothing exchange at gunpoint. While Graham escapes, Finger is killed by the posse. Later, the posse arrives at Amanda’s door, and she faints at the sight of the corpse in a tuxedo. Mistaken for Finger while wearing his clothes, Graham is sentenced to a year in prison for Dr. Finger’s crime of stealing gold teeth. After three days, Amanda recovers from the shock and drives her carriage into Gladstone City to face the townspeople. She is greeted with disdain and insults, but responds with courage, declaring that she loved Graham, and that the experience made her life worthwhile. When she arrives home, Amanda, Sam and Edna prepare to leave town, but are surprised when the townspeople come to apologize. They admire her courage and many found her explanation moving, including a visiting writer from New York City named Mr. Foster, who offers to turn her story into a book. As Amanda tells her story, she inaccurately remembers Graham as being very tall and very handsome, and includes Graham’s own fabrications about his life and career. Foster and Amanda's completed book, From Noon Till Three, is a worldwide phenomenon, and the music-box waltz becomes the hit song, “Hello and Goodbye.” Meanwhile, in prison, Graham laughs as a fellow prisoner reads the book aloud, calling it “bullshit,” then retracts his opinion when threatened by another prisoner. Upon his release, Graham dons glasses and a beard to visit Gladstone City, now a tourist attraction. After paying admission to visit his own grave, Graham joins a tour of the Starbuck mansion grounds. Amanda happens by at the end of the tour and signs autographs. The group leaves, but Graham stays behind and asks Amanda for a drink of water. She invites him in and shows him around the house. When Graham removes his beard and glasses, Amanda does not recognize him, insisting that Graham Dorsey was a very tall, handsome Southern gentleman. After several futile attempts to convince her, Graham exposes his genitals, which sparks her memory. He is ready to resume their relationship, but Amanda believes that their legend, which she ranks with Romeo and Juliet, is more important. She threatens him with a gun, but Graham is relentless and declares his love. Amanda offers Graham a weekly stipend to keep their secret, which he takes as an insult. Amanda vows that nothing will spoil their legend, and shoots herself. Graham is horrified, but he escapes through a window. At the funeral, Reverend Cabot gives a heartfelt but fallacious explanation of Amanda’s suicide. Elsewhere, during a stagecoach robbery, Graham recognizes fellow outlaw and gang member Red Roxy. Red assumes that Graham is insane and pistol-whips him. Graham visits a brothel, where the madam is an old friend. As he is ejected, she declares, “Graham Dorsey was 6’4”. The handsomest man I ever saw.” He later has to shoot his way out of a saloon when he tries to stop a woman from singing “Hello and Goodbye.” He runs into a theater where From Noon Till Three is being performed, interrupting the show to tell his side of the story, while the actors and stagehands subdue him. In an insane asylum, Graham is led to a cell where a kindly, white-haired man immediately recognizes him and says, “We’ve been expecting you.”"
