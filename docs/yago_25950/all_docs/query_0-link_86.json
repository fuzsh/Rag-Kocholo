He wrote for TV shows Playhouse 90, Omnibus, and Studio One, screenplays The Fastest Gun Alive, The Subject Was Roses, The Only Game in Town, and From Noon Till Three, which was based on his novel.\n\nAn independent moviemaker, he wrote and directed Desperate Characters (winner at Berlin Film Festival), Once In Paris (nominated for a Writers Guild Award for best original screenplay) and The Gig.\n\nHis plays include Who’ll Save The Plowboy? (Obie winner for best play), The Subject Was Roses (winner of a Pulitzer Prize and also Tony and Drama Critics awards), and Contact With The Enemy ( Drama Desk nominee for best play).\n\nIn print and non-fiction, his work includes Wake Up Screening, Writing For Love and/or Money, and Out Takes from A Life on Spec.\n\n“Frank Gilroy’s stunning body of work, with its sure and poignant grasp of the human condition, would alone make him a worthy recipient of the Ian McLellan Hunter Award,” Michael Winship, president of the Writers Guild of America, East, said in a statement. “But in addition he has been a visionary and pioneer, forging a path for all the independent filmmakers and storytellers who have followed him.”\n\nHe’ll be honored on Saturday, Feb. 5 at a ceremony at New York City’s AXA Equitable Center.\n\nThe award was established in 1992."
