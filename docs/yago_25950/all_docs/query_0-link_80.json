        "text": "The New York Times reports that playwright Frank D. Gilroy, whose 1964 Broadway debut, THE SUBJECT WAS ROSES was the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, a Tony and a Drama Critics' Circle Award, passed away on Saturday, September 12th at his home in Monroe, N.Y. He was 89. The news was shared by his son Tony.\n\nGilroy wrote in the Golden Age of Television for such shows as Playhouse 90, Westinghouse Studio One, The United States Steel Hour, Omnibus, Kraft Television Theatre, and Lux Video Theatre.\n\nHis entrance to theatre was marked with his 1962 play Who'll Save the Plowboy? at the Off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre, which won the Obie Award. The Subject Was Roses premiered on Broadway on May 25, 1964 and closed on May 21, 1966.\n\nThat Summer, That Fall, which had a brief run on Broadway in 1967, starring Tyne Daly and Irene Papas is a version of the Hippolytus-Phaedra story. The play is set in an Italian neighborhood in Lower Manhattan in an apartment complex.\n\nGilroy's works include screenplays for the films Desperate Characters (starring Shirley MacLaine) and The Gallant Hours (starring James Cagney). He has also adapted his own plays for film, including The Subject Was Roses (starring Patricia Neal, Martin Sheen and Jack Albertson) and The Only Game in Town (starring Elizabeth Taylor andWarren Beatty). His 1985 screenplay for The Gig (starring Cleavon Little and Wayne Rogers) has been adapted as a musical, with book, music, and lyrics by Douglas J. Cohen. A 2006 Off-Broadway presentation and recording by the York Theatre Company starred Karen Ziemba, Stephen Berger, Michele Pawk, and Michael McCormick.[10]\n\nGilroy has also written fiction, including the novel From Noon Till Three, which was adapted into a film starring Charles Bronson. In addition to writing the screenplay, Gilroy also directed the film. Gilroy also contributed to several TV westerns in the late 1950s, including Have Gun - Will Travel, The Rifleman, and Wanted: Dead or Alive. His later credits include Nero Wolfe, a 1977 adaptation of Rex Stout's novel The Doorbell Rang as a television movie featuring Thayer David.\n\nA list of Gilroy's plays follows:\n\nThe Middle World (1949)\n\nThe Viewing (1957)\n\nGetting In (1957)\n\nWho'll Save The Plowboy? (1962)\n\nThe Subject Was Roses (1964)\n\nFar Rockaway (1965)\n\nThat Summer, That Fall (1967)\n\nThe Only Game In Town (1968)\n\nPresent Tense: Four Plays (1972)\n\nCome Next Tuesday\n\nTwas Brillig\n\nSo Please Be Kind\n\nPresent Tense\n\nThe Next Contestant (1979)\n\nLast Licks (1979)\n\nDreams Of Glory (1980)\n\nReal To Reel (1987)\n\nMatch Point (1990)\n\nA Way With Words (1991)\n\nA Way With Words\n\nMatch Point\n\nFore!\n\nReel to Reel\n\nGive The Bishop My Faint Regards\n\nGive The Bishop My Faint Regards (1992)\n\nFore (1993)\n\nAny Given Day (1993)\n\nGetting In (1997)\n\nContact With the Enemy\n\nThe Housekeeper\n\nThe Lake\n\nPiscary\n\nThe Fastest Gun Alive\n\n[Source]\n\nPhoto Credit: Peter James Zielinski"
