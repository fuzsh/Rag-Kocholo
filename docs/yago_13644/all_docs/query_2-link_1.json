        "text": "Former Miss Hong Kong and actress Hoyan Mok (莫可欣) is among one of the many Hong Kong celebrities who are involved in the Wai Yin Association, a charity organization. She helped planned the organization’s TES 2015 (Travel Experience Share), an educational project that aims to inspire children from lower income families to travel overseas to experience different cultures. Hoyan has been working on the project for about a year.\n\nHer husband, actor Alex Fong Chun Sun (方中信), once complained to Hoyan for always being away and neglecting their daughter. But after seeing Hoyan’s work, he became more understanding. “He really supports me. Now that he’s been to my work, he understands why I am holding meetings everyday.”\n\nAlex has been in Hengdian to film the Chinese drama Department Six <六扇門> with Raymond Lam (林峯). Earlier this year, he traveled all over the country to film the epic drama Legend of Mi Yue <羋月傳>. “He stayed in Hengdian for over three months,” Hoyan shared.\n\nSeveral actors got embroiled in prostitution scandals in Hengdian in the past year. Hoyan said she does not believe her husband to be the cheating type. “Marriage is about being faithful and trusting each other. It’s about our lives,” said Hoyan. She praised Alex to be a dedicated husband, “He has good willpower. And he’s honest.”\n\nPlease enable JavaScript\n\nWatch on\n\nAsking if Alex has encountered any beautiful woman while he was working in Hengdian, Hoyan said, “He has. He would tell me in a light-hearted way about his encounters, but I wouldn’t know if he was being completely honest or not.”\n\nSource: On.cc"
