        "text": "But Hongkong took it in its stride - no outrage, no condemnation, no moral backlash.\n\nAccording to TVB's assistant controller of external affairs, Lily Chan, the feeling among the two million fans who were glued to their television screens for the final was: ''It's not that serious, not a big deal.'' ''After the initial surprise, things went back to normal. I am from a different generation, I don't know how young people feel, but I suspect the feeling was that a lot of movie stars take off their clothes. It was all very casual really,'' said Ms Chan.\n\nA little surprisingly, this year was described by Ms Chan as ''rather quiet''.\n\nIn fact, TVB have offered Ms Mak an artiste contract. They still want her for ''teledrama and infotainment'' programmes. Ms Mak's reputation would appear to have escaped unbattered.\n\nSince the first Miss Hongkong was staged in 1973, only one contestant has been disqualified. In 1981 winner Loh Pui-chi had her title taken away from her and the reason was far from sex-sational; she had lied about her age.\n\nScandals which stand up are thin on the ground, but there is a downside to the constant attention.\n\nThe original Miss Hongkong, 1973's Elaine Sung, has taken most of the glare of publicity which comes with the crown. The strain contributed to the break-up of her two marriages, she has admitted.\n\nEach year around 2,000 starry-eyed hopefuls aged 17 to 25 throw their name into the ring. Just 20 end up as semi-finalists.\n\nTVB conducts a ''preliminary background check'' - their age is double-checked and the station makes sure that the young woman has lived in Hongkong long enough to qualify. That's it.\n\nWhile TVB reserves the right to check into their background and to disqualify them if they are guilty of any ''misconduct'', this, says TVB, does not happen.\n\nAnd while Ms Chan conceded that it would ''nice sometimes'' to have a thorough rundown on any sordid pasts, it is also ''not very realistic''.\n\n''At contest time there are a number of casual phone calls alleging little scandals, but we don't take them seriously unless they have concrete evidence,'' said Ms Chan. These ''little scandals'', however, usually make it into the pages of the Chinese showbiz press, which thrives on the glam event of the year.\n\nLike the contestant in a previous pageant who was said to have had plastic surgery. Definitely not a good rumour for her image. But to Carline Ki, who runs her own publicity and public relations agency, plastic surgery is a good idea.\n\n''$40,000 will get you a top boob job, you can get it for $20,000, but people might notice and that would be terrible. Then all you need is a manager and be prepared for an image change and a lot of hard work.'' Ms Ki knows what she's talking about - Miss Hongkongs are part of her working life.\n\nNo matter what the product a client is promoting, invariably the presence of a Miss Hongkong face is in the contract. She's very unlikely to be a real Miss Hongkong, but that doesn't matter. As a contestant, she has secured her spot on the party list.\n\nBeing an also-ran Miss Hongkong is potentially a life-changing experience - with a pretty face and a pleasant manner, young beauties can and do literally live off the attention that the mere association with the contest brings.\n\nIn fact, it's probably better than winning if you want to have any say over what offers you accept. TVB snare the first three winners in one year with water-tight contracts which allow them to dictate every move the girls make.\n\nWhile there are film, television and sponsorship deals floating around like confetti after the big event, for the also-rans there's a circuit waiting that, for at least two years, means popularity and big bucks.\n\nThey get paid handsomely for just showing up for a promotional dinner or cocktail party and being photographed with the execs. Ms Ki is used to negotiating the price.\n\n''If they are still hot, they can get $30,000 for just being there, if they are not fresh, you can get the price down to $5,000,'' explained Ms Ki.\n\n''In the first and second year after the contest, 40 per cent of them will get married to wealthy men. Men also like to get a Miss Hongkong - it's good for their image and good for business,'' explained Ms Ki.\n\nEven more clinically, there are ''mistress contracts''. These agreements are apparently drawn up between the desired Miss Hongkong entrant and a wealthy businessman looking for an ego boost. While the terms vary, the agreement usually lasts for one year and means cash, property and jewellery for her.\n\nAll sound a bit callous? ''It's business,'' explained Ms Ki simply. And no one knows that better than the girls themselves, she added."
