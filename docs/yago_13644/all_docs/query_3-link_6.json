        "text": "Would you believe Hong Kong celebrity couple Alex Fong Chung-sun and Hoyan Mok’s only daughter is already 16 and turning out to be quite an accomplished junior equestrienne? As a member of the Jockey Club’s Youth Equestrienne team, Fu Ka-ching not only bears a striking resemblance to her former beauty queen mum, she’s also known for her grace on horseback.\n\nKa-Ching shared in an interview that she began riding at the age of seven. Since shifting focus towards training for equestrian triathlons, the talented gal has gone on to place within the top 10 in competitions. Safe to say that if she continues to work hard, she’s definitely well on her way towards her goal of competing at the Asian Games. She might not have ventured into showbiz like her parents that just yet, but when it comes to talent at least, the apple does not fall far from the tree.\n\nBefore tying the knot in 2008, Alex Fong and Hoyan Mok were together for 12 years. Just two days after their wedding, the newly married couple welcomed their first child Ka-Ching."
