        "text": "Hong Kong actor Alex Fong Chung Sun is known for his love for sports cars and has owned multiple of them over the years.\n\nThe 60-year-old has participated in race events such as the FIA Formula E World Championship in 2016 and the Ferrari Challenge Asia-Pacific in 2019.\n\nIn a recent episode of an online programme hosted by TVB actress Catherine Chau, Fong revealed that he had sold all his Ferrari as he found them to be \"inconvenient\".\n\n\"Buying those two-seater cars seems exciting at first, but once that two-month honeymoon phase is over, you will just leave (the cars) there.\n\n\"There's just nowhere I can drive them to, and I can't possibly drive that kind of car when I go to the market, right?\n\n\"I tried it once and it was very inconvenient,\" he said, adding that he has learned the importance of \"letting go\".\n\nWhen asked about how many luxury cars he has owned over the years, Fong said he had lost count as he had changed cars multiple times over the years.\n\nHowever, he did mention that the longest he has kept one was for three years.\n\nAt present, the actor said he is more into \"practical family cars\" and has expressed his desire to purchase an SUV in the future.\n\nFong is best known for his award-winning performance in Burning Flame II and One Nite In Mongkok.\n\nHe tied the knot with actress Hoyan Mok in 2008 and welcomed a daughter together later that year."
