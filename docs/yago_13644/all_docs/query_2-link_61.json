A secondary objective was to perform an item-by-item analysis of the TICS scores to determine which items correlated most highly with the overall scores. Cross-sectional cohort study. The Glaucoma Consultation Service of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 472 of 565 consecutive patients age 65 and older who were seen at the Glaucoma Consultation Service between November 1, 1987 and October 31, 1988. Each subject had a standard visual examination and review of medical history at entry, followed by a telephone interview that collected information on demographic characteristics, cognitive status, health status, accidents, falls, symptoms of depression, and alcohol intake. A multivariate linear regression model of correlates of TICS score found the strongest correlates to be education, age, occupation, and the presence of depressive symptoms. The only significant ocular condition that correlated with lower TICS score was the presence of surgical aphakia (model R2 = .46). Forty-six percent (216/472) of patients fell below the established definition of normal on the mental status scale. In a logistic regression analysis, the strongest correlates of an abnormal cognitive function score were age, diabetes, educational status, and occupational status. An item analysis using step-wise linear regression showed that 85 percent of the variance in the TICS score was explained by the ability to perform serial sevens and to repeat 10 items immediately after hearing them. Educational status correlated most highly with both of these items (Kendall Tau R = .43 and Kendall Tau R = .30, respectively). Education, occupation, depression, and age were the strongest correlates of the score on this new screening test for assessing cognitive status. These factors were\n\nPhysiologic Dysfunction Scores and Cognitive Function Test Performance in United States Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKobrosly, Roni W; Seplaki, Christopher L; Jones, Courtney M; van Wijngaarden, Edwin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective To investigate the relationship between a measure of cumulative physiologic dysfunction and specific domains of cognitive function. Methods We examined a summary score measuring physiological dysfunction, a multisystem measure of the bodyâs ability to effectively adapt to physical and psychological demands, in relation to cognitive function deficits in a population of 4511 adults aged 20 to 59 who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988â1994). Measures of cognitive function comprised three domains: working memory, visuomotor speed, and perceptual-motor speed. âPhysiologic dysfunctionâ scores summarizing measures of cardiovascular, immunologic, kidney, and liver function were explored. We used multiple linear regression models to estimate associations between cognitive function measures and physiological dysfunction scores, adjusting for socioeconomic factors, test conditions, and self-reported health factors. Results We noted a dose-response relationship between physiologic dysfunction and working memory (coefficient = 0.207, 95% CI = (0.066, 0.348), p < 0.0001) that persisted after adjustment for all covariates (p = 0.03). We did not observe any significant relationships between dysfunction scores and visuomotor (p = 0.37) or perceptual-motor ability (p = 0.33). Conclusions Our findings suggest that multisystem physiologic dysfunction is associated with working memory. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms and explore the persistency of this association into later life. We suggest that such studies should incorporate physiologic data, neuroendocrine parameters, and a wide range of specific cognitive domains.

Assessments of general intellectual functioning, or global cognition, may not provide information regarding domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, and may therefore fail to detect, impaired trajectories of development within particular cognitive domains. We compare the efficacy of global cognitive scores to that of composite cognitive domain scores in detecting cognitive disorders in a sample of perinatally HIV-infected children, and a demographically matched HIV negative control group, drawn from the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC) study. All children were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Using data from that test battery, we created ten separate composite cognitive domains: general intellectual functioning, attention, working memory, visual memory, verbal memory, language, visual spatial ability, motor coordination, processing speed and executive function. Within each domain, each test bore a high level of association with each of the other tests in that domain (Cronbach's Î±ââ¥â.70 for all domains). We found that composite domain scores calculated on whole-sample data were significantly higher than those calculated using control-sample data. Our comparison of a global cognitive score to composite domain scores suggested that the latter provided more detailed information (regarding strengths, weaknesses, areas of impairment), and when compared to global scores, were more sensitive in detecting HIV-associated cognitive disorders, and were able to distinguish HIV-infected patients from uninfected controls. Hence, we recommend using this method of composite cognitive domains scores, rather than global aggregate scores, when assessing cognitive function in paediatric HIV. This method provides a convenient and relatively accurate assessment that might help with cross-cultural and cross\n\nAssociation Between Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scores and Measures of Functional Mobility in Lower Extremity Amputees After Inpatient Rehabilitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrengopoulos, Courtney; Burley, Joshua; Viana, Ricardo; Payne, Michael W; Hunter, Susan W\n\n2017-03-01\n\nTo determine whether scores on a cognitive measure are associated with walking endurance and functional mobility of individuals with transfemoral or transtibial amputations at discharge from inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation. Retrospective cohort study. Rehabilitation hospital. Consecutive admissions (N=176; mean age Â± SD, 64.27Â±13.23y) with transfemoral or transtibial amputation that had data at admission and discharge from an inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation program. Not applicable. Cognitive status was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The L Test and the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) were used to estimate functional mobility and walking endurance. The mean Â± SD MoCA score was 24.05Â±4.09 (range, 6-30), and 56.3% of patients had scores <26. MoCA scores had a small positive correlation with the 2MWT (r=.29, P<.01), and a small negative correlation to the L Test (r=-.24, P<.01). In multivariable linear regression, compared with people with the highest MoCA score quartile, there was no difference on the 2MWT, but people in the lowest 2 quartiles took longer to complete the L Test. Cognitive impairment was very prevalent. The association between MoCA and functional mobility was statistically significant. These results highlight the potential for differences on complex motor tasks for individuals with cognitive impairment but does not indicate a need to exclude them from rehabilitation on the basis of cognitive impairment alone.

The aim of this study was to survey the sleep quality of individuals with polycythemia at high altitude and determine its association with cognitive abilities. We surveyed 230 soldiers stationed in Tibet (all men; mean age 21-52Â±4.30âyr) at altitudes ranging from 3658 to 3996âm. All participants were given a blood tests for hemoglobin level and a questionnaire survey of cognitive function. Polycythemia was defined as excessive erythrocytosis (Hbâ¥21âg/dL in men or â¥19âg/dL in women). Poor sleepers were defined as having a global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (PSQI)>5. Cognitive abilities were determined by the Chinese revision of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Benton Visual Retention Test. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between the PSQI and cognitive function. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent effect of sleep quality on cognitive function. The global PSQI score of enrolled participants was 8.14Â±3.79. Seventy-five (32.6%) soldiers were diagnosed with polycythemia. The proportion of poor sleepers was 1.45 times greater in those with polycythemia compared with those without polycythemia [95% (confidence interval) CI 1.82-2.56], and they had a statistically significant lower score for cognitive function. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the global PSQI score was negatively associated with IQ (Î²=0.11, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.05) and digit symbol scores (Î²=0.66, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.44). Poor sleep quality was determined to be an independent predictor of impaired IQ [odds ratio (OR) 1.59, 95% CI 1.30-1.95] and digit symbol score (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.31) in logistic regression analysis. The present study showed that for young soldiers with polycythemia at high altitude impaired subjective sleep quality was an independent\n\nAutomated and visual scoring methods of cerebral white matter hyperintensities: relation with age and cognitive function.\n\nPubMed\n\nTiehuis, A M; Vincken, K L; Mali, W P T M; Kappelle, L J; Anbeek, P; Algra, A; Biessels, G J\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA reliable scoring method for ischemic cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) will help to clarify the causes and consequences of these brain lesions. We compared an automated and two visual WMH scoring methods in their relations with age and cognitive function. MRI of the brain was performed on 154 participants of the Utrecht Diabetic Encephalopathy Study. WMH volumes were obtained with an automated segmentation method. Visual rating of deep and periventricular WMH (DWMH and PWMH) was performed with the Scheltens scale and the Rotterdam Scan Study (RSS) scale, respectively. Cognition was assessed with a battery of 11 tests. Within the whole study group, the association with age was most evident for the automated measured WMH volume (beta = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.29-0.57). With regard to cognition, automated measured WMH volume and Scheltens DWMH were significantly associated with information processing speed (beta = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.40 to -0.06; beta = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.42 to -0.10), whereas RSS PWMH were associated with attention and executive function (beta = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.36 to -0.02). Measurements of WMH with an automated quantitative segmentation method are comparable with visual rating scales and highly suitable for use in future studies to assess the relationship between WMH and subtle impairments in cognitive function.

None of the current treatment regimens for Alzheimer's disease are effective in arresting progression. Lifestyle choices may prevent cognitive decline. This study aims to clarify which factors best predict cognitive function. This was a prospective cross-sectional analysis of 799 men and women undergoing health and cognitive testing every 1 to 3Â years at an outpatient center. This study utilizes data collected from the first patient visit. Participant ages were 18 to 88 (mean = 50.7) years and the sample was 26.6% female and 73.4% male. Measurements were made of body composition, fasting laboratory and anthropometric measures, strength and aerobic fitness, nutrient and dietary intake, and carotid intimal media thickness (IMT). Each participant was tested with a computerized neurocognitive test battery. Cognitive outcomes were assessed in bivariate analyses using t-tests and correlation coefficients and in multivariable analysis (controlling for age) using multiple linear regression. The initial bivariate analyses showed better Neurocognitive Index (NCI) scores with lower age, greater fitness scores (push-up strength, VO 2 max, and exercise duration during treadmill testing), and lower fasting glucose levels. Better cognitive flexibility scores were also noted with younger age, lower systolic blood pressure, lower body fat, lower carotid IMT scores, greater fitness, and higher alcohol intake. After controlling for age, factors that remained associated with better NCI scores include no tobacco use, lower fasting glucose levels, and better fitness (aerobic and strength). Higher cognitive flexibility scores remained associated with greater aerobic and strength fitness, lower body fat, and higher intake of alcohol. Modifiable biomarkers that impact cognitive performance favorably include greater aerobic fitness and strength, lower blood sugar levels, greater alcohol intake, lower body\n\nValidity of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised new Executive Function Scores in the diagnosis of dementia: some early findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeinik, Jeremia; Solomesh, Isaac\n\n2007-03-01\n\nThe Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised introduces 2 new executive items (Ideational Fluency and Visual Reasoning), which separately or combined with 2 executive items in the former version (word list generation and similarities) might constitute an Executive Function Score (EFS). The authors studied the validity of these new EFSs in 51 demented (dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular dementia) and nondemented individuals (depressives and normals). The new EFSs were found valid to accurately differentiate between demented and nondemented subjects; however, they were considerably less so when specific diagnoses were considered. Correlations between the variously combined executive scores and the cognitive scales and subscales studied were prevalently low to moderate, and ranged from high and significant to low and nonsignificant when the 4 executive items were correlated to each other. The ability of the executive scores to discriminate demented from nondemented individuals was lower compared with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised scores. EFS was found internally consistent.\n\nThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet, Cognitive Function, and Cognitive Decline in American Older Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerendsen, Agnes A M; Kang, Jae H; van de Rest, Ondine; Feskens, Edith J M; de Groot, Lisette C P G M; Grodstein, Francine\n\n2017-05-01\n\nTo examine the association between long-term adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet with cognitive function and decline in older American women. Prospective cohort study. The Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of registered nurses residing in 11 US states. A total of 16,144 women from the Nurses' Health Study, aged â¥70Â years, who underwent cognitive testing a total of 4 times by telephone from 1995 to 2001 (baseline), with multiple dietary assessments between 1984 and the first cognitive examination. DASH adherence for each individual was based on scoring of intakes of 9 nutrient or food components. Long-term DASH adherence was calculated as the average DASH adherence score from up to 5 repeated measures of diet. Primary outcomes were cognitive function calculated as the average scores of the 4 repeated measures, as well as cognitive change of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score and composite scores of global cognition and verbal memory. Greater adherence to long-term DASH score was associated with better average cognitive function, irrespective of apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allele status [multivariable-adjusted differences in mean z-scores between extreme DASH quintilesÂ =Â 0.04 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.01-0.07), P trendÂ =Â .009 for global cognition; 0.04 (95% CI 0.01-0.07), P trendÂ =Â .002 for verbal memory and 0.16 (95% CI 0.03-0.29), and P trendÂ =Â .03 for Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, P interaction >0.24]. These differences were equivalent to being 1Â year younger in age. Adherence to the DASH score was not associated with change in cognitive function over 6Â years. Our findings in the largest cohort on dietary patterns and cognitive function to date indicate that long-term adherence to the DASH diet is important to maintain cognitive function at older ages.

The relationship between trace elements measured in individual biological samples and cognitive function in an elderly population had not been investigated extensively. The participant population is part of a large cohort study of 2000 rural elderly Chinese persons. Six cognitive assessment tests were used to evaluate cognitive function in this population, and a composite score was created to represent global cognitive function.

Analysis of covariance models were used to assess the association between each trace element and the composite cognitive score adjusting for demographics, medical history of chronic diseases, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Three trace elements-calcium, cadmium, and copper-were found to be significantly related to the composite cognitive score. Increasing plasma calcium level was associated with higher cognitive score (p <.0001). Increasing cadmium and copper, in contrast, were significantly associated with lower composite score (p =.0044 and p =.0121, respectively). Other trace elements did not show significant association with the composite cognitive score.

High protein load precipitates hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a prevalent neurocognitive complication of cirrhosis. Because the influence of nutritional factors on the progression of cognitive impairment has not been explored in depth, this study aimed to investigate the effect on cognition of acute metabolic changes induced by breakfast consumption. Twenty-one subjects (10 women) with Child A cirrhosis and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients and controls were divided into 2 groups: those receiving a breakfast of 500 kcal and 21 g protein and those receiving no breakfast. Serum ammonia concentrations and cognitive functions were studied (Mindstreams; NeuroTrax, Fresh Meadows, NY) before and 2 h after breakfast. A mixed model was used to analyze the data. At baseline, cirrhotic patients had significantly lower total scores and significantly lower subscores (P < 0.015 global cognitive score) in 4 of 7 cognitive categories, which is indicative of MHE. Patients with hyperammonemia (>85 mug/dL) scored significantly lower for attention than did patients with normal serum ammonia concentrations (P < 0.003). After 2 h, MHE patients and controls responded differently to breakfast consumption with regard to attention and executive functions (P < 0.003 and P < 0.04, respectively). Although patients' scores improved after breakfast consumption, despite an increase in serum ammonia, healthy controls who continued to fast performed better. Chronic hyperammonemia may negatively affect attention. Eating breakfast improves attention and executive functions of patients with MHE. Prolonged periods of starvation may be partly responsible for these changes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01083446.\n\nPatient-reported sleep difficulty and cognitive function during the first year of dialysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKutner, Nancy G; Zhang, Rebecca; Huang, Yijian; Bliwise, Donald L\n\n2008-01-01\n\nResearch in the general population indicates that sleep fragmentation is detrimental for cognitive function, but little attention has been given to this issue in dialysis patients. We hypothesized that patients with self-reported persistent sleep difficulty would have an increased risk of scoring lower on a cognitive function measure at follow-up compared to their score at baseline. Sleep difficulty and cognitive function were reported by a large national patient cohort near the start of dialysis and at a 9- to 12-month follow-up. Logistic regression was used to investigate the risk of scoring lower on a cognitive function measure at follow-up as a function of self-reported sleep difficulty, controlling for patients' sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics, including depressed mood. At follow-up, cognitive function scores were lower among 35.8% of the cohort. Patients with self-reported persistent sleep difficulty had the lowest average cognitive function score. Men with reported persistent sleep difficulty, regardless of presence of depressed mood, had a significantly increased risk of a lower cognitive function score at follow-up. Women with reported persistent sleep difficulty as well as depressed mood had significantly increased risk of a lower cognitive function score. The potential impact of sleep difficulty and depressed mood on the cognitive function of dialysis patients emphasizes the importance of evaluating and treating these risks and highlights the value of continued research to improve our understanding and management of these issues.\n\nGender, Resources Across the Life Course, and Cognitive Functioning in Egypt\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYOUNT, KATHRYN M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this article, I evaluate the life-course determinants of cognitive functioning among 1,003 women and men aged 50 and older in Ismailia, Egypt. Three questions motivate this analysis: (1) Do older women have poorer cognitive functioning than do older men?; (2) Do cognitive resources accrued in childhood and adulthood have net positive associations with later-life cognitive functioning for women and men?; and (3) To what extent do differences in the amounts and effects of womenâs and menâs cognitive resources account for gaps in their cognitive functioning? Compared with men, women have lower Modified-Mini Mental Status Exam (M-MMSE) scores for overall cognitive functioning. Cognitive resources in childhood and adulthood are jointly associated with the M-MMSE score. About 83% of the gender gap in mean M-MMSE scores is attributable to gaps in menâs and womenâs attributes across the life course. Gender gaps in childhood cognitive resourcesâand especially schooling attainmentâaccount for the largest share (18%) of the residual gender gap in cognitive functioning.

We hypothesized that the continued existence of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) despite potent antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is mediated by the inability of such therapy to control this monocyte/macrophage reservoir. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted within a prospectively enrolled cohort. We devised a monocyte efficacy (ME) score based on the anticipated effectiveness of ARV medications against monocytes/macrophages using published macrophage in vitro drug efficacy data. We examined, within an HIV neurocognitive database, its association with composite neuropsychological test scores (NPZ8) and clinical cognitive diagnoses among subjects on stable ARV medications unchanged for >6 months prior to assessment. Among 139 subjects on ARV therapy, higher ME score correlated with better NPZ8 performance (r=0.23, P<0.01), whereas a score devised to quantify expected penetration effectiveness of ARVs into the brain (CPE score) did not (r=0.12, P=0.15). In an adjusted model (adjusted r(2)=0.12), ME score (Î²=0.003, P=0.02), CD4(+) T-cell nadir (Î²=0.001, P<0.01) and gender (Î²=-0.456, P=0.02) were associated with NPZ8, whereas CPE score was not (Î²=0.003, P=0.94). A higher ME score was associated with better clinical cognitive status (P<0.01). With a range of 12.5-433.0 units, a 100-unit increase in ME score resulted in a 10.6-fold decrease in the odds of a dementia diagnosis compared with normal cognition (P=0.01). ARV efficacy against monocytes/macrophages correlates with cognitive function in HIV-infected individuals on ARV therapy within this cohort. If validated, efficacy against monocytes/macrophages may provide a new target to improve HIV NCI.\n\nMidlife sleep characteristics associated with late life cognitive function.\n\nPubMed\n\nVirta, Jyri J; HeikkilÃ¤, Kauko; Perola, Markus; Koskenvuo, Markku; RÃ¤ihÃ¤, Ismo; Rinne, Juha O; Kaprio, Jaakko\n\n2013-10-01\n\nPrevious studies with limited follow-up times have suggested that sleep-related traits are associated with an increased risk of incident dementia or cognitive decline. We investigated the association between midlife sleep characteristics and late life cognitive function. A follow-up study with a median follow-up time of 22.5 (range 15.8-25.7) years assessing the association between midlife sleep characteristics and later cognitive function. Questionnaire data from 1981 were used in the assessment of sleep characteristics, use of hypnotics, and covariates at baseline. Between 1999 and 2007, participants were assigned a linear cognitive score with a maximum score of 51 based on a telephone interview (mean score 38.3, SD 6.1). Linear regression analyses were controlled for age, sex, education, ApoE genotype, and follow-up time. 2,336 members of the Finnish Twin cohort who were at least 65 years of age. N/A. Baseline short (< 7 h/day) and long (> 8 h/day) sleepers had lower cognitive scores than participants sleeping 7-8 h/ day (Î² = -0.84, P = 0.014 and Î² = -1.66, P < 0.001, respectively). As compared to good sleep quality, poor or rather poor sleep quality was associated with a lower cognitive score (Î² = -1.00, P = 0.011). Also, the use of hypnotics â¥ 60 days per year was associated with poorer cognitive function (Î² = -1.92, P = 0.002). This is the first study indicating that midlife sleep length, sleep quality, and use of hypnotics are associated with late life cognitive function. Further confirmation is needed, but sleep-related characteristics may emerge as new risk factors for cognitive impairment.\n\nSubclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRossetti, Heidi C.; Weiner, Myron; Hynan, Linda S.; Cullum, C. Munro; Khera, Amit; Lacritz, Laura H.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To examine the relationship between measures of subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function. Method Participants from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based multiethnic study of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, were re-examined 8 years later (DHS-2) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); N = 1904, mean age = 42.9, range 8â65. Associations of baseline measures of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium, abdominal aortic plaque, and abdominal aortic wall thickness) with MoCA scores measured at follow-up were examined in the group as a whole and in relation to age and ApoE4 status. Results A significant linear trend of successively lower MoCA scores with increasing numbers of atherosclerotic indicators was observed (F(3, 1150) = 5.918, p = .001). CAC was weakly correlated with MoCA scores (p = .047) and MoCA scores were significantly different between participants with and without CAC (M = 22.35 vs 23.69, p = 0.038). With the exception of a small association between abdominal AWT and MoCA in subjects over age 50, abdominal AWT and abdominal aortic plaque did not correlate with MoCA total score (p â¥.052). Cognitive scores and atherosclerosis measures were not impacted by ApoE4 status (p â¥.455). Conclusion In this ethnically diverse population-based sample, subclinical atherosclerosis was minimally associated with later cognitive function in middle-aged adults.

Eighty-eight women (mean age: 70.5Â±4.2 years) participated in a prevention program for long-term care. They completed the Square-Stepping Exercise (SSE) program once a week, 120 minutes/session, for 11 weeks. We assessed participants' cognitive function using 5 cognitive tests (5-Cog) before and after the intervention. We defined cognitive function as the 5-Cog total score and defined the change in cognitive function as the 5-cog post-score minus the pre-score. We divided participants into four groups based on age (â¤69 years or â¥70 years) and baseline cognitive function level (above vs. below the median cognitive function level). We conducted two-way analysis of variance. All 4 groups improved significantly in cognitive function after the intervention. There were no baseline cognitive function levelÃage interactions and no significant main effects of age, although significant main effects of baseline cognitive function level (P=0.004, Î·(2)=0.09) were observed. Square-Stepping Exercise is an effective exercise for improving cognitive function. These results suggest that older adults with cognitive decline are more likely to improve their cognitive function with exercise than if they start the intervention with high cognitive function. Furthermore, during an exercise intervention, baseline cognitive function level may have more of an effect than a participant's age on the degree of cognitive improvement.\n\nCorrelation between hypertension and cognitive function in elderly\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFitri, F. I.; Rambe, A. S.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHypertension and cognitive impairment are common disorders among elderly adults, and their prevalences tend to rise as the population ages. This study aimed to determine the correlation between hypertension and cognitive function in elderly. It was a cross-sectional study involving 62 elderly subjects. All subjects underwent physical and neurologic examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Indonesian Version (MoCA-INA) to assess cognitive function. This study included 62 subjects consisted of 26 males (41.9%) and 36 females (58.1%). There were 24 subjects (38.2%) with hypertension and 38 (61.3%) normal elderly subjects. The mean age was 65.71Â±4.49 years old. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics, total MoCA-INA scores, and scores based on cognitive domains between two groups, except for visuospatial and executive function (p=0.026). There was a significant correlation between hypertension and visuospatial and executive function (r=0.301, p=0.017). Hypertension is correlated with cognitive impairment mainly on visuospatial and executive function in elderly.\n\nCognitive Function in a Randomized Trial of Evolocumab.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiugliano, Robert P; Mach, FranÃ§ois; Zavitz, Kenton; Kurtz, Christopher; Im, Kyungah; Kanevsky, Estella; Schneider, Jingjing; Wang, Huei; Keech, Anthony; Pedersen, Terje R; Sabatine, Marc S; Sever, Peter S; Robinson, Jennifer G; Honarpour, Narimon; Wasserman, Scott M; Ott, Brian R\n\n2017-08-17\n\nBackground Findings from clinical trials of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have led to concern that these drugs or the low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that result from their use are associated with cognitive deficits. Methods In a subgroup of patients from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, we prospectively assessed cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The primary end point was the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (scores range from 4 to 28, with lower scores indicating a more efficient use of strategy and planning). Secondary end points were the scores for working memory (scores range from 0 to 279, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), episodic memory (scores range from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), and psychomotor speed (scores range from 100 to 5100 msec, with faster times representing better performance). Assessments of cognitive function were performed at baseline, week 24, yearly, and at the end of the trial. The primary analysis was a noninferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline in the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function between the patients who received evolocumab and those who received placebo; the noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the standard deviation of the score in the placebo group. Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (Â±SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21Â±2.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29Â±2.81 in the placebo group (P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of scores for working memory (change in raw score, -0.52 in the\n\nCognitive Impairment Precedes and Predicts Functional Impairment in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu-Seifert, Hong; Siemers, Eric; Price, Karen; Han, Baoguang; Selzler, Katherine J; Henley, David; Sundell, Karen; Aisen, Paul; Cummings, Jeffrey; Raskin, Joel; Mohs, Richard\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe temporal relationship of cognitive deficit and functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well characterized. Recent analyses suggest cognitive decline predicts subsequent functional decline throughout AD progression. To better understand the relationship between cognitive and functional decline in mild AD using autoregressive cross-lagged (ARCL) panel analyses in several clinical trials. Data included placebo patients with mild AD pooled from two multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 solanezumab (EXPEDITION/2) or semagacestat (IDENTITY/2) studies, and from AD patients participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed using AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living instrumental subscale (ADCS-iADL), or Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), respectively. ARCL panel analyses evaluated relationships between cognitive and functional impairment over time. In EXPEDITION, ARCL panel analyses demonstrated cognitive scores significantly predicted future functional impairment at 5 of 6 time points, while functional scores predicted subsequent cognitive scores in only 1 of 6 time points. Data from IDENTITY and ADNI programs yielded consistent results whereby cognition predicted subsequent function, but not vice-versa. Analyses from three databases indicated cognitive decline precedes and predicts subsequent functional decline in mild AD dementia, consistent with previously proposed hypotheses, and corroborate recent publications using similar methodologies. Cognitive impairment may be used as a predictor of future functional impairment in mild AD dementia and can be considered a critical target for prevention strategies to limit future functional decline in the dementia process.\n\nInfluence of social support on cognitive function in the elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nYeh, Shu-Chuan Jennifer; Liu, Yea-Ying\n\n2003-05-30\n\nSocial support is important in daily activities of the elderly. This study tests the hypothesis that there is an association between social support and cognitive function among the elderly in a community setting. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in a cross-sectional stratified random sample of 4,993 elderly (> or =65 years) city residents. Using multiple regression analysis, we investigated the influence of social support on cognitive function. 12% were over 80 years old. 53.28% were men. 67.14% were married. Higher Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) scores (higher score means better cognitive function) were associated with strong social support, as measured by marital status and perceived positive support from friends. Lower cognitive function was associated with older and with female respondents. Only instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were statistically and negatively related to SPMSQ. Lower functional status was associated with lower cognitive function. Elders with grade school educations had lower SPMSQ scores than did elders with high school educations. In Taiwan, higher cognitive function in community-living elderly was associated with increased social support. Life-style management should provide social activities for the elderly to promote a better quality of life.\n\nImpact of medications on cognitive function in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nLal, Chitra; Siddiqi, Nasar; Kumbhare, Suchit; Strange, Charlie\n\n2015-09-01\n\nMedications can impact cognitive function. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with cognitive impairment. There is currently a paucity of data evaluating the impact of medications on sleep architecture and cognition in untreated OSAS. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and medications on cognition by a screening questionnaire called the Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI). We conducted a retrospective chart review on consecutive adults (ageâ>â18Â years) with OSAS seen in Medical University of South Carolina Sleep Clinic between January 1, 2012 and May 8, 2013, for whom the Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI) score was available and who were not on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The correlation between different medications, sleep study variables, and MCFSI scores was studied. Univariate analysis revealed that many medications had significant correlations with MCFSI scores, including antidepressants (pâ=â0.05), antipsychotics (pâ=â0.01), anxiolytics (pâ=â0.005), statins (pâ=â0.077) and narcotics (pâ=â0.006). The mean percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (pâ=â0.04) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (pâ=â0.01) were also significantly correlated with MCFSI scores. Multivariate analysis revealed that Epworth Sleepiness Scale and use of antipsychotics, narcotics, and anxiolytics correlated with higher MCFSI scores (worse cognition) and conversely that statin use was associated with improved cognition. Medications have a significant impact on cognitive function in OSAS. Thus, medication use should be considered in future studies of cognitive function in patients with OSAS.\n\nAdjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPhillips, Kelly-Anne; Regan, Meredith M; Ribi, Karin; Francis, Prudence A; Puglisi, Fabio; Bellet, Meritxell; Spazzapan, Simon; Karlsson, Per; Budman, Daniel R; Zaman, Khalil; Abdi, Ehtesham A; Domchek, Susan M; Feng, Yang; Price, Karen N; Coates, Alan S; Gelber, Richard D; Maruff, Paul; Boyle, Frances; Forbes, John F; Ahles, Tim; Fleming, Gini F; Bernhard, JÃ¼rg\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: To examine the effect on cognitive function of adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS) for breast cancer. Methods: The Suppression of Ovarian Function (SOFT) trial randomised premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer to 5 years adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen+OFS, exemestane+OFS or tamoxifen alone. The Co-SOFT substudy assessed objective cognitive function and patient reported outcomes at randomisation (T0), and 1 year later (T1); the primary endpoint was change in global cognitive function, measured by the composite objective cognitive function score. Data were compared for the pooled tamoxifen+OFS and exemestane+OFS groups vs the tamoxifen alone group using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: Of 86 participants, 74 underwent both T0 and T1 cognitive testing; 54 randomised to OFS+ either tamoxifen (28) or exemestane (26) and 20 randomised to tamoxifen alone. There was no significant difference in the changes in the composite cognitive function scores between the OFS+ tamoxifen or exemestane groups and the tamoxifen group (meanÂ±s.d., â0.21Â±0.92 vs â0.04Â±0.49, respectively, P=0.71, effect size=â0.20), regardless of prior chemotherapy status, and adjusting for baseline characteristics. Conclusions: The Co-SOFT study, although limited by small samples size, provides no evidence that adding OFS to adjuvant oral endocrine therapy substantially affects global cognitive function.

To explore the impact of fatigue on cognitive function, while controlling for the influence of depression, disability, comorbidities, and psychotropic medications. PwMS completed a computerized cognitive testing battery with age- and education-adjusted cognitive domain scores. Disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)), cognitive fatigue, and depression were concurrently evaluated. In all, 699 PwMS were included. Both cognitive fatigue and depression were significantly and negatively correlated with the same cognitive domains: information processing speed, executive function, attention, motor function, and memory (-0.15 â©½ r â©½ -0.14 for cognitive fatigue; -0.24 â©½ r â©½ -0.19 for depression). Multivariate analysis revealed significant but small independent correlations only between depression and neuropsychological test results, while cognitive fatigue had no independent correlation with objective cognitive function except for a trend toward impaired motor function in highly fatigued PwMS. Depression and cognitive fatigue accounted for no more than 6% of the variance in objective cognitive domain scores. Cognitive fatigue is not independently related to objective cognitive impairment. Depression may influence cognitive function of PwMS primarily when it is severe. Cognitive impairment in PwMS should not be ascribed to fatigue or mild depression.\n\nSubclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossetti, Heidi C; Weiner, Myron; Hynan, Linda S; Cullum, C Munro; Khera, Amit; Lacritz, Laura H\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTo examine the relationship between measures of subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function. Participants from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based multiethnic study of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, were re-examined 8 years later (DHS-2) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); NÂ =Â 1904, mean ageÂ =Â 42.9, range 8-65. Associations of baseline measures of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium, abdominal aortic plaque, and abdominal aortic wall thickness) with MoCA scores measured at follow-up were examined in the group as a whole and in relation to age and ApoE4 status. A significant linear trend of successively lower MoCA scores with increasing numbers of atherosclerotic indicators was observed (F(3, 1150)Â =Â 5.918, pÂ =Â .001). CAC was weakly correlated with MoCA scores (pÂ =Â .047) and MoCA scores were significantly different between participants with and without CAC (MÂ =Â 22.35 vs 23.69, pÂ =Â 0.038). With the exception of a small association between abdominal AWT and MoCA in subjects over age 50, abdominal AWT and abdominal aortic plaque did not correlate with MoCA total score (pÂ â¥Â .052). Cognitive scores and atherosclerosis measures were not impacted by ApoE4 status (pÂ â¥Â .455). In this ethnically diverse population-based sample, subclinical atherosclerosis was minimally associated with later cognitive function in middle-aged adults. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, sex differences in cognitive function and obesity in cognitively normal aging Chinese Han population have not attracted much attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sex, obesity, and cognitive function in an elderly Chinese population with normal cognitive function. A total of 228 cognitively normal aging participants (males/females =93/135) entered this study. Their general demographic information (sex, age, and education) was collected by standardized questionnaire. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and serum lipid levels were measured. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess participants' cognitive function. The prevalence of obesity in elderly women (18/133, 13.5%) was significantly higher than that in men (5/92, 5.4%, P =0.009). Regression analyses showed that obesity was associated with drinking alcohol (OR =13.695, P =0.045) and triglyceride (OR =1.436, P =0.048) in women and limited to low-density lipoprotein (OR =11.829, P =0.023) in men. Women performed worse on the naming score for MoCA than men ( P <0.01). Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that education ( t =3.689, P <0.001) and smoking ( t =2.031, P =0.045) were related to the score of naming in female, while high-density lipoprotein ( t =-2.077, P =0.041) was related to the score of naming in male; however, no correlation was found between body mass index and cognitive function in both male and female ( P >0.05). Our finding suggests that there are significant sex differences in obesity and specific cognitive domains in aging Chinese Han population with normal cognitive function.\n\nDiffusion Tensor Fractional Anisotropy in the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus Correlates with Functional Independence Measure Cognition Scores in Patients with Cerebral Infarction.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoyama, Tetsuo; Domen, Kazuhisa\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis study aimed to determine the relationship between fiber tract degeneration measured by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and outcome of patients after cerebral infarction. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated by DTI in patients 14-21 days after the first infarction and were analyzed by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Mean FA values within the corticospinal tract (CST) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) were extracted from individual TBSS data. Relationships between FA ratios (rFAs, lesioned to non-lesioned hemisphere) and outcomes assessed by Brunnstrom stage (BRS) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) motor and cognition scores were examined using Spearman's rank correlation test. Forty patients (21 left and 19 right hemisphere lesions) were entered into an analytical database. BRS ranged from 1 to 6 (median, 5) for shoulder, elbow, or forearm; from 2 to 6 (median, 4.5) for hand or finger; and from 3 to 6 (median, 5) for lower extremity. FIM motor ranged from 51 to 91 (median, 79.5), and FIM cognition ranged from 16 to 35 (median, 29). rFA values in the CST ranged from .692 to 1.053 (median, .933), and those in the SLF ranged from .778 to 1.076 (median, .965). Mann-Whitney U test (Pâ<.05) revealed no significant differences between the left and the right hemisphere lesion groups. Individual rFA values in the CST correlated with BRS scores (râ=â.585-0.654), whereas those in the SLF correlated with FIM cognition scores (râ=â.409, Pâ<.05). DTI-FA values in the SLF and CST may be useful for outcome prediction of cognitive function and extremity function, respectively. Copyright Â© 2017 National Stroke Association.

In a prospective study of 5529 men enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study, we measured baseline serum phosphate, baseline cognitive function, and change in cognitive function between baseline and follow-up exams an average of 4.6Â years later using the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination and Trails B. There was no association between serum phosphate and odds of cognitive impairment as assessed by baseline 3MS score or risk of cognitive decline as assessed by longitudinal change in 3MS score. Higher baseline serum phosphate was associated with higher odds of poor executive function as assessed by Trails B with fully adjusted odds ratios 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-1.52), 1.31 (0.97-1.77), and 1.45 (1.08-1.94) for men in the second, third, and fourth versus the bottom quartile (referent group) of serum phosphate (p-trend 0.007). However, higher phosphate level was not associated with risk of decline in executive function as assessed by longitudinal change in Trails B score with fully adjusted odds ratios 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.28), 0.96 (0.70-1.32), and 1.21 (0.89-1.66) for men in the second, third, and fourth versus the bottom quartile (referent group) of serum phosphate (p-trend 0.22). Higher serum phosphate in older men was associated with a higher likelihood of poor executive function, but not with impaired global cognitive function or decline in executive or global cognition.

We predicted that neuroticism moderates the association between ApoE and cognitive function and also explored whether other personality dimensions (openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness) affect the association between ApoE status and cognitive function. Method Five-hundred and ninety-seven older adults (mean age of 78) enrolled in the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study completed the NEO-Five Factor Inventory of personality. Cognitive function was assessed via the cognitive portion of the Alzheimerâs Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), and a blood sample for ApoE genotyping was drawn. Results As hypothesized, regression analysis indicated that neuroticism moderated the relationship between the presence of ApoE Îµ-4 and cognitive function. Individuals with high neuroticism scores had significantly lower ADAS-cog scores compared with individual with low neuroticism scores, but this was true only among carriers of ApoE Îµ-4 (interaction effect Î² = .124, p = .028). There was scant evidence that other personality dimensions moderate the association between ApoE Îµ-4 and cognitive function. Conclusions Cognitive function may be affected by ApoE and neuroticism acting in tandem. Research on the underlying physiological mechanisms by which neuroticism amplifies the effect of ApoE Îµ-4 is warranted. The study of genotype by phenotype interactions provides an important and useful direction for the study of cognitive function among older adults and for the development of novel prevention programs.

However, information about whether the degree of MCI before exercise training affects improvement in cognitive function is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cut-off value in a MCI screening tool that predicts reversal to normal cognitive function after exercise training in older adults with MCI. Participants included 112 Japanese community-dwelling older adult outpatients (37 men, 75 women; mean age 76.3âyears). We administered the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) before and after exercise training. MCI was defined as a MoCA-J score <26. All participants underwent exercise training 2âdays per week for 6âmonths, according to American Heart Association guidelines. The prevalence of MCI was 65.2%. After exercise training, 46.6% of participants with MCI reversed to normal cognitive function. The MoCA-J cut-off score to predict cognitive function potentially reversible to normal was 23, with receiver operating characteristic analysis showing an area under the curve of 0.80, sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 69.2%. Multiple logistic regression analysis to predict non-MCI after exercise training showed that MoCA-J score â¥23 (OR 6.9, Pâ<â.001), female sex (OR 3.4, Pâ=â.04) and age (OR 0.9, Pâ=â.04) were independent determinants. The MoCA-J cut-off score of 23 might be useful to predict cognitive function that is potentially reversible to normal among community-dwelling Japanese older adults with MCI.

Previous smaller studies reported conflicting results on the evolution of cognitive function after TAVI. In this prospective cohort, cognitive function was measured in 229 patients â¥70 years using the Mini Mental State Examination before and 6 months after TAVI. Cognitive deterioration or improvement was defined as change of â¥3 points decrease or increase in the Mini Mental State Examination score between baseline and follow-up. Cognitive deterioration was found in 29 patients (12.7%). Predictive analysis using logistic regression did not identify any statistically significant predictor of cognitive deterioration. A review of individual medical records in 8 patients with a major Mini Mental State Examination score decrease of â¥5 points revealed specific causes in 6 cases (postinterventional delirium in 2; postinterventional stroke, progressive renal failure, progressive heart failure, or combination of preexisting cerebrovascular disease and mild cognitive impairment in 1 each). Among 48 patients with impaired baseline cognition (Mini Mental State Examination score <26 points), 18 patients (37.5%) cognitively improved. The preinterventional aortic valve area was lower in patients who cognitively improved (median aortic valve area 0.60 cm 2 ) as compared with patients who did not improve (median aortic valve area 0.70 cm 2 ; P=0.01). This is the first study providing evidence that TAVI results in cognitive improvement among patients who had impaired preprocedural cognitive function, possibly related to hemodynamic improvement in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Our results confirm that some patients experience cognitive deterioration after TAVI.

Although extrapulmonary effects of COPD are well known, effects of COPD on cognitive functions have not been evaluated sufficiently. therefore we aimed to determine cognitive functions of copd patients in the present study. 112 COPD patients with moderate, severe and very severe irreversible airway obstruction and 44 age matched healthy subjects without COPD and systemic diseases as control group were enrolled to the study. Mini mental state examination (MMSE) was performed to evaluate cognitive functions. MMSE results were compared between patient and control groups. Moreover relationship between exacerbation frequency and cognitive functions was evaluated. Total 156 subjects as 112 COPD patients and 44 healthy subjects were included to the study. Mean age of COPD patients was 65.03 Â± 7.63 years, and mean age of control group was 63.63 Â± 8.96 years (p= 0.364). Mean score of MMSE in COPD patients was 23.8 Â± 4.39, and mean score of MMSE in control group was 26.7 Â± 2.88. We determined a significant difference in terms of MMSE scores betweeen patient and control group (p< 0.0001). MMSE scores and FEV1 values were significantly different among patients with moderate, sevre and very severe airflow obstruction (p= 0.001; p< 0.0001 respectively). We found a significant negative correlation between MMSE results and exacerbation frequency during last year (p= 0.003; r= -0.239). Lower MMSE scores of COPD patients than subjects in control group indicates the impairment of cognitive functions in COPD patients. Moreover a negative relationship between MMSE scores with exacerbation frequency during last year suggests that prevention from exacerbation can decrease cognitive impairment in COPD patients. We believe that assessment of cognitive functions and preventive strategies\n\nRBANS memory percentage retention: No evidence of incremental validity beyond RBANS scores for diagnostic classification of mild cognitive impairment and dementia and for prediction of daily function.\n\nPubMed\n\nJodouin, Kara A; O'Connell, Megan E; Morgan, Debra G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRBANS percentage retention scores may be useful for diagnosis, but their incremental validity is unclear. Percentage retention versus RBANS immediate and delayed memory subtests and delayed index scores were compared for diagnostic classification and for prediction of function. Data from 173 memory clinic patients with an interdisciplinary diagnosis (no cognitive impairment, amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [AD]) and complete RBANS data were analyzed. Across diagnostic contrasts, list percentage retention classification accuracy was similar to List Learning delayed recall, but below the Delayed Memory Index (DMI). Similarly, for classifying no cognitive impairment versus aMCI or dementia due to AD, story percentage retention was similar to Story Memory subtests and below the DMI. For classifying aMCI versus AD; however, Story Memory exceeded the DMI, but was similar to Story Memory subtest scores. Similarly, for prediction of function percentage retention measures did not predict variance beyond that predicted by the RBANS subtest or index scores. In sum, there is no evidence that calculation of percentage retention for RBANS adds clinical utility beyond those provided by the standard RBANS scores.\n\nLate-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Polygenic Risk Profile Score Predicts Hippocampal Function.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiao, Ena; Chen, Qiang; Goldman, Aaron L; Tan, Hao Yang; Healy, Kaitlin; Zoltick, Brad; Das, Saumitra; Kolachana, Bhaskar; Callicott, Joseph H; Dickinson, Dwight; Berman, Karen F; Weinberger, Daniel R; Mattay, Venkata S\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe explored the cumulative effect of several late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk loci using a polygenic risk profile score (RPS) approach on measures of hippocampal function, cognition, and brain morphometry. In a sample of 231 healthy control subjects (19-55 years of age), we used an RPS to study the effect of several LOAD risk loci reported in a recent meta-analysis on hippocampal function (determined by its engagement with blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging during episodic memory) and several cognitive metrics. We also studied effects on brain morphometry in an overlapping sample of 280 subjects. There was almost no significant association of LOAD-RPS with cognitive or morphometric measures. However, there was a significant negative relationship between LOAD-RPS and hippocampal function (familywise error [small volume correction-hippocampal region of interest] p < .05). There were also similar associations for risk score based on APOE haplotype, and for a combined LOAD-RPSÂ + APOE haplotype risk profile score (pÂ <Â .05 familywise error [small volume correction-hippocampal region of interest]). Of the 29 individual single nucleotide polymorphisms used in calculating LOAD-RPS, variants in CLU, PICALM, BCL3, PVRL2, and RELB showed strong effects (p < .05 familywise error [small volume correction-hippocampal region of interest]) on hippocampal function, though none survived further correction for the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms tested. There is a cumulative deleterious effect of LOAD risk genes on hippocampal function even in healthy volunteers. The effect of LOAD-RPS on hippocampal function in the relative absence of any effect on cognitive and morphometric measures is consistent with the reported temporal characteristics of LOAD biomarkers with the earlier manifestation of synaptic dysfunction before morphometric and cognitive changes.

The burden of cognitive and physical impairment progresses over time, and may be major determinants of quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess to which degree quality of life correlates with physical and cognitive function in progressive MS. This is a retrospective study of 52 patients with primary progressive ( NÂ =Â 18) and secondary progressive MS ( NÂ =Â 34). Physical disability was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) test and 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Cognitive function was assessed using Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, and Trail Making Test B (TRAIL-B). In addition, quality of life was assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Only measures of cognitive function correlated with the overall SF-36 quality of life score and the Mental Component Summary score from the SF-36. The only physical measure that correlated with a measure of quality of life was T25FW test, which correlated with the Physical Component Summary from the SF-36. We found no other significant correlations between the measures of cognitive function and the overall physical measures but interestingly, we found a possible relationship between the 9HPT score for the nondominant hand and the SDMT and TRAIL-B. Our findings support inclusion of measures of cognitive function in the assessment of patients with progressive MS as these correlated closer with quality of life than measures of physical impairment.\n\nFactors Influencing Cognitive Function in Subjects With COPD.\n\nPubMed\n\nDag, Ersel; Bulcun, Emel; Turkel, Yakup; Ekici, Aydanur; Ekici, Mehmet\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the association between cognitive function and age, pulmonary function, comorbidity index, and the 6-min walk distance in subjects with COPD as well as to compare the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in terms of their ability to identify cognitive dysfunction in subjects with COPD. A total of 52 individuals with stable COPD were included in this study. Cognitive function was assessed using MMSE and MoCA. Age, body mass index, the Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, 6-min walk distance, arterial blood gases, and pulmonary function tests were assessed and recorded. The range and SD of scores in subjects with COPD were larger with MoCA than with MMSE. MMSE and MoCA scores are associated with 6-min walk distance and comorbidity index in subjects with COPD. General cognitive function measured by MoCA was negatively correlated with the comorbidity index but was positively associated with 6-min walk distance in subjects with COPD after controlling for possible confounding factors in the multivariate model. However, general cognitive function measured by MMSE was not correlated with the comorbidity index and 6-min walk distance in subjects with COPD, after controlling for possible confounding factors in the multivariate model. MoCA may be a more reliable screening test than MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in subjects with COPD. The addition of cognitive tests on assessment of subjects with COPD can provide further benefit.

The advent of sustainable design or green building strategies reinvigorated questions regarding the specific factors in buildings that lead to optimized conditions for health and productivity. We simulated indoor environmental quality (IEQ) conditions in \"Green\" and \"Conventional\" buildings and evaluated the impacts on an objective measure of human performance: higher-order cognitive function. Twenty-four participants spent 6 full work days (0900-1700 hours) in an environmentally controlled office space, blinded to test conditions. On different days, they were exposed to IEQ conditions representative of Conventional [high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] and Green (low concentrations of VOCs) office buildings in the United States. Additional conditions simulated a Green building with a high outdoor air ventilation rate (labeled Green+) and artificially elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels independent of ventilation. On average, cognitive scores were 61% higher on the Green building day and 101% higher on the two Green+ building days than on the Conventional building day (p < 0.0001). VOCs and CO2 were independently associated with cognitive scores. Cognitive function scores were significantly better under Green+ building conditions than in the Conventional building conditions for all nine functional domains. These findings have wide-ranging implications because this study was designed to reflect conditions that are commonly encountered every day in many indoor environments.

This study investigated whether cognitive reserve applies to the oldest-old. This has implications for cognitive interventions in this age group. Baseline and 5-year follow-up data from the Newcastle 85+ Study were used (N = 845, mean age = 85.5, 38% male). A Cognitive Reserve Index (CRI) was created, including: education, social class, marital status, engagement in mental activities, social participation, and physical activity. Global (Mini-Mental State Examination) and domain specific (Cognitive Drug Research Battery subtests assessing memory, attention, and speed) cognitive functions were assessed. Dementia diagnosis was determined by health records. Logistic regression analysis examined the association between CRI scores and incident dementia. Mixed effects models investigated baseline and longitudinal associations between the CRI scores and cognitive function. Analyses controlled for sex, age, depression, and cardiovascular disease history. Higher reserve associated with better cognitive performance on all baseline measures, but not 5-year rate of change. The CRI associated with prevalent, but not incident dementia. In the oldest-old, higher reserve associated with better baseline global and domain-specific cognitive function and reduced risk of prevalent dementia; but not cognitive decline or incident dementia. Increasing reserve could promote cognitive function in the oldest-old. The results suggest there would be little impact on trajectories, but replication is needed. Development of preventative strategies would benefit from identifying the role of each factor in building reserve and why rate of change is not affected.\n\nUsefulness of the University of California San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment for the evaluation of cognitive function and activities of daily living function in patients with cognitive impairment.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeon, Dong-Wook; Ju, Hyun-Bin; Jung, Do-Un; Kim, Sung-Jin; Shim, Joo-Cheol; Moon, Jung-Joon; Kim, You-Na\n\n2017-10-25\n\nTo assess the usefulness of the University of California San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) as a new diagnostic method and tool for the assessment of cognitive function and activities of daily living function in patients with cognitive impairment. In total, 35 patients with cognitive impairment and 35 healthy controls were recruited for this study. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were used for the evaluation of cognitive function, while the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (BADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Index (IADL), and UPSA were used for the evaluation of activities of daily living function. UPSA scores were significantly lower in patients with cognitive impairment than in controls. The UPSA total score was significantly correlated with MMSE, CDR, GDS, and IADL scores. With regard to the detection of cognitive impairment, UPSA exhibited a greater determination power (R 2 = 0.593) compared with BADL (R 2 = 0.149) and IADL (R 2 = 0.423) and higher sensitivity and specificity compared with IADL. Our results suggest that UPSA is a useful tool for the evaluation of cognitive function and activities of daily living function in patients with cognitive impairment.\n\nFeasibility study for remote assessment of cognitive function in multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGeorge, Michaela F; Holingue, Calliope B; Briggs, Farren B S; Shao, Xiaorong; Bellesis, Kalliope H; Whitmer, Rachel A; Schaefer, Catherine; Benedict, Ralph Hb; Barcellos, Lisa F\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), and affects employment and quality of life. Large studies are needed to identify risk factors for cognitive decline. Currently, a MS-validated remote assessment for cognitive function does not exist. Studies to determine feasibility of large remote cognitive function investigations in MS have not been published. To determine whether MS patients would participate in remote cognitive studies. We utilized the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M), a previously validated phone assessment for cognitive function in healthy elderly populations to detect mild cognitive impairment. We identified factors that influenced participation rates. We investigated the relationship between MS risk factors and TICS-M score in cases, and score differences between cases and control individuals. The TICS-M was administered to MS cases and controls. Linear and logistic regression models were utilized. 11.5% of eligible study participants did not participate in cognitive testing. MS cases, females and individuals with lower educational status were more likely to refuse (p<0.001). Cases who did complete testing did not differ in terms of perceived cognitive deficit compared to cases that did participate. More severe disease, smoking, and being male were associated with a lower TICS-M score among cases (p<0.001). The TICS-M score was significantly lower in cases compared to controls (p=0.007). Our results demonstrate convincingly that a remotely administered cognitive assessment is quite feasible for conducting large epidemiologic studies in MS, and lay the much needed foundation for future work that will utilize MS-validated cognitive measures.\n\nChanges in Cognitive Function in Patients with Primary Insomnia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Hui; Wei, Meijie; Ding, Wantao\n\n2017-06-25\n\nNeuropsychological evidence is not sufficient concerning whether there is cognitive impairment in patients with primary insomnia. Further study is needed in this regard. To measure the changes in cognitive functioning in patients with primary insomnia. 40 patients with insomnia (insomnia group) and 48 normal sleepers (control group) were tested using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), episodic memory test, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The insomnia group had significantly lower scores than the control group in the naming ( t =3.17, p= 0.002), immediate memory ( t =3.33, p= 0.001), and delayed recall ( t =6.05, p= 0.001) sections of the MoCA, as well as a lower overall score on the MoCA ( t =3.24, p= 0.002). Participants with different degrees of insomnia also had significantly different scores in naming ( F =7.56, p= 0.001), language ( F =3.22, p= 0.045), total score ( F =6.72, p= 0.002), delayed memory ( F =8.41, p= 0.001), and delayed recall (F=22.67, p= 0.001) sections of the MoCA. The age of primary insomnia patients was correlated to MoCA total score, immediate memory, delayed recall, and delayed recognition function, also with statistical significance. The years of education of primary insomnia patients was also significantly correlated to overall MoCA score, as well as visuospatial and executive function, naming, attention, language, and abstraction sections of the MoCA. Primary insomnia patients have cognitive impairment. The more severe the insomnia is, the wider the range of and the more serious the degree of cognitive impairment is.\n\nRelationship between financial competence and cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNiekawa, Nobuyuki; Sakuraba, Yukie; Uto, Hanae; Kumazawa, Yoshiko; Matsuda, Osamu\n\n2007-10-01\n\nThe present study examined financial competence in patients with schizophrenia and the relationship between their financial competence and cognitive function. The subjects consisted of 25 patients with schizophrenia (10 inpatients and 15 outpatients) and 22 normal controls who were community-dwelling people with no psychiatric disorders or cognitive deficit. To assess the subjects' cognitive function and financial competence, they completed the Japanese version of the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (COGNISTAT), which has 10 subtests, and the Financial Competency Assessment Tool (FCAT), which has six subordinate domains of financial competence. Patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than the controls in all scores on the FCAT. The financial scores that were significantly different between the patients and the normal controls were significantly positively correlated with the scores on several COGNISTAT subtests (e.g. comprehension). These results suggest that patients with schizophrenia have problems with financial competence and that these problems may be accounted for by deficits in several cognitive functions.\n\nCardiovascular disease biomarkers on cognitive function in older adults: Joint effects of cardiovascular disease biomarkers and cognitive function on mortality risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoprinzi, Paul D; Crush, Elizabeth; Joyner, Chelsea\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPrevious research demonstrates an inverse association between age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers with cognitive function; however, little is known about the combined associations of CVD risk factors and cognitive function with all-cause mortality in an older adult population, which was the purpose of this study. Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES were used (N=2,097; 60+yrs), with mortality follow-up through 2011. Evaluated individual biomarkers included mean arterial pressure (MAP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), HDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), A1C, and measured body mass index (BMI). Cognitive function was assessed using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Further, 4 groups were created based on CVD risk and cognitive function. Group 1: high cognitive function and low CVD risk; Group 2: high cognitive function and high CVD risk; Group 3: low cognitive function and low CVD risk; Group 4: low cognitive function and high CVD risk. An inverse relationship was observed where those with more CVD risk factors had a lower (worse) cognitive function score. Compared to those in Group 1, only those in Group 3 and 4 had an increase mortality risk. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured from the carotid to femoral (CF-PWV) and from the carotid to radial (CR-PWV) with the Complior SP System. Cognitive function was measured by 6 tests of executive function, psychomotor speed, memory, and language fluency. A total of 1433 participants were included (mean age 75 y, 43% men). Adjusting for age, sex, education, pulse rate, hemoglobin A1C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, cardiovascular disease history, smoking, drinking, and depression symptoms, a CF-PWV>12 m/s was associated with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (coefficient: -0.31, SE: 0.11, P=0.005), fewer words recalled on Auditory Verbal Learning Test (coefficient: -1.10, SE: 0.43, P=0.01), and lower score on the composite cognition score (coefficient: -0.10, SE: 0.05, P=0.04) and marginally significantly associated with longer time to complete Trail Making Test-part B (coefficient: 6.30, SE: 3.41, P=0.06), CF-PWV was not associated with Trail Making Test-part A, Digit Symbol Substation Test, or Verbal Fluency Test. No associations were found between CR-PWV and cognitive performance measures. Higher large artery stiffness was associated with worse cognitive function, and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these associations.\n\nReliability and Validity of Composite Scores from the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery in Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHeaton, Robert K.; Akshoomoff, Natacha; Tulsky, David; Mungas, Dan; Weintraub, Sandra; Dikmen, Sureyya; Beaumont, Jennifer; Casaletto, Kaitlin B.; Conway, Kevin; Slotkin, Jerry; Gershon, Richard\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study describes psychometric properties of the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) Composite Scores in an adult sample. The NIHTB-CB was designed for use in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials for ages 3 to 85. A total of 268 self-described healthy adults were recruited at four university-based sites, using stratified sampling guidelines to target demographic variability for age (20â85 years), gender, education, and ethnicity. The NIHTB-CB contains seven computer-based instruments assessing five cognitive sub-domains: Language, Executive Function, Episodic Memory, Processing Speed, and Working Memory. Participants completed the NIHTB-CB, corresponding gold standard validation measures selected to tap the same cognitive abilities, and sociodemographic questionnaires. Three Composite Scores were derived for both the NIHTB-CB and gold standard batteries: âCrystallized Cognition Composite,â âFluid Cognition Composite,â and âTotal Cognition Compositeâ scores. NIHTB Composite Scores showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachâs alphas = 0.84 Crystallized, 0.83 Fluid, 0.77 Total), excellent testâretest reliability (r: 0.86â0.92), strong convergent (r: 0.78â0.90) and discriminant (r: 0.19â0.39) validities versus gold standard composites, and expected age effects (r = 0.18 crystallized, r = â 0.68 fluid, r = â 0.26 total). Significant relationships with self-reported prior school difficulties and current health status, employment, and presence of a disability provided evidence of external validity. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery Composite Scores have excellent reliability and validity, suggesting they can be used effectively in epidemiologic and clinical studies.

The Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status is a novel instrument for assessment of cognitive function that can be administered in person or by telephone. To evaluate the determinants and utility of TICS-M (13-item modified version) for assessment of cognitive function in healthy elderly people. The utility of TICS-M was compared with more widely used MMSE and CAMCOG in a cross-sectional survey of 120 older (62 to 89 years) UK adults. The TICS-M cognitive test scores (27.97, SD 4.15) were normally distributed in contrast with those for MMSE and CAMCOG that had a negatively skewed distribution. TICS-M scores were inversely correlated with age (r = -0.21) and with the NART fullscale IQ (r = -0.35), but were independent of years of education in this cohort. TICS-M was highly correlated with MMSE (r = 0.57) and with CAMCOG (r = 0.62) scores. The time required to complete the test is comparable to MMSE and substantially less than CAMCOG. The normal distribution of TICS-M test scores suggest that this test is less constrained by the ceiling effect which limits the utility of MMSE and CAMCOG test scores in detecting early cognitive impairment. TICS-M is an appropriate instrument to assess cognitive function in both research and in clinical practice.

The system comprised (1) interaction devices, FCs and a workstation used as interactive tools for collecting and transferring data to the server, (2) a BG information management system responsible for managing the cognitive games and storing test results, and (3) a feedback system used for conducting the analysis of cognitive functions to assist caregivers in screening high risk groups with mild cognitive impairment. Three kinds of experiments were performed to evaluate the developed FC-based BG cognitive function assessment system. The experimental results showed that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the system's evaluation outcomes and the traditional Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores was 0.83. The average Technology Acceptance Model 2 score was close to six for 31 elderly subjects. Most subjects considered that the brain games are interesting and the FC human-machine interface is easy to learn and operate. The control group and the cognitive impairment group had statistically significant difference with respect to the accuracy of and the time taken for the brain cognitive function assessment games, including Animal Naming, Color Search, Trail Making Test, Change Blindness, and Forward / Backward Digit Span.

Subjects of this study were 40 elderly persons with dementia (men 14, women 26) and 37 normal elderly persons (men 5, women 32). Data were collected using questionnaires by investigator-based interview to the elderly and family caregivers. We examined their general characteristics, anthropometric data, cognitive function, and taurine index. Cognitive function was measured using MMSE-DS and higher score means better cognitive function. As dietary history of past taurine intake, taurine index was evaluated by scoring the intake frequency of 41 kinds of taurine-containing foods. Part correlation analysis (sex, age, and school educational period correction) was used to analyze associations between taurine index and cognitive function. The analysis of all data was carried out by the SPSS 20.0 program for windows. The age, height, weight, and BMI of elderly with dementia showed no statistical significance compared to normal elderly. The elderly with dementia had significantly higher school education period (7.4 years) than the normal elderly (4.8 years) (pÂ <Â 0.01). Nevertheless, the average total score of cognitive function (MMSE-DS) of the elderly with dementia (18.1 points) was significantly lower than score of the normal elderly (21.7 points) (pÂ <Â 0.05). The average taurine index of the elderly with dementia (104.7 points) was significantly lower than average taurine index of the normal elderly (123.7 points) (pÂ <Â 0.01). There were positive correlations between total taurine index and total score of cognitive function in all the elderly subjects (pÂ <Â 0.05). In particular, as taurine index was higher, there were significantly higher scores of cognitive function such as 'time orientation' and 'judgement and abstract thinking' (pÂ <Â 0.01). In conclusion, these results suggest that past taurine intake may have a positive effect on present\n\nHeight for age z score and cognitive function are associated with Academic performance among school children aged 8-11 years old.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaile, Demewoz; Nigatu, Dabere; Gashaw, Ketema; Demelash, Habtamu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAcademic achievement of school age children can be affected by several factors such as nutritional status, demographics, and socioeconomic factors. Though evidence about the magnitude of malnutrition is well established in Ethiopia, there is a paucity of evidence about the association of nutritional status with academic performance among the nation's school age children. Hence, this study aimed to determine how nutritional status and cognitive function are associated with academic performance of school children in Goba town, South East Ethiopia. An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 131 school age students from primary schools in Goba town enrolled during the 2013/2014 academic year. The nutritional status of students was assessed by anthropometric measurement, while the cognitive assessment was measured by the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II) and Ravens colored progressive matrices (Raven's CPM) tests. The academic performance of the school children was measured by collecting the preceding semester academic result from the school record. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable linear regression were used in the statistical analysis. This study found a statistically significant positive association between all cognitive test scores and average academic performance except for number recall (pâ=â0.12) and hand movements (pâ=â0.08). The correlation between all cognitive test scores and mathematics score was found positive and statistically significant (pâ<â0.05). In the multivariable linear regression model, better wealth index was significantly associated with higher mathematics score (Ãâ=â0.63; 95Â % CI: 0.12-0.74). Similarly a unit change in height for age z score resulted in 2.11 unit change in mathematics score (Ãâ=â2.11; 95Â % CI: 0.002-4.21). A single unit change of wealth index resulted 0.53 unit changes in average score of all academic subjects among school age children (Ãâ=â0\n\nFunctional and physical abilities in the early continuum of cognitive decline.\n\nPubMed\n\nShin, Joon-Ho; Lim, Jae-Young; Kim, Ki Woong; Kim, Suyoung; Lee, Jaebong; Paik, Nam-Jong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe early cognitive continuum has been emphasized recently. We sought to characterize the functional and physical aspects of the cognitive continuum in subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), nonamnestic (NA-MCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (A-MCI). Furthermore, we identified the potential diagnostic utility of specific functional tasks. A total of 702 participants, aged â¥65 years and defined as NCI, SCI, NA-MCI, and A-MCI according to the original Petersen criteria, were included. They completed the Korean basic (K-ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scales (K-IADL) and the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA). Significant differences were observed between the different cognitive status groups in three items and total scores on the K-ADL, six items and total scores on the K-IADL and POMA. Controlling for confounding factors revealed that subjects from the A-MCI group performed poorly at bathing, shopping, handling money, and the sum of assorted functional items. These findings demonstrated the declining feature of functional and physical performance according to the cognitive continuum, with A-MCI being discriminative with respect to specific functional tasks as compared to milder cognitive statuses.

However, the mechanism of these cognitive deficits remains unclear. Resting-state functional connectivity in the frontoparietal network (FPN) is associated with cognitive performance in healthy subjects. For this reason, it was hypothesized that functional connectivity of the FPN would be related to cognitive functioning in patients with glioma. To assess this relationship, preoperative cognitive status was correlated to patient-specific connectivity within the FPN. Further, we assessed whether connectivity could predict neuropsychologic outcome following surgery. Sixteen patients with diffuse glioma underwent neuropsychologic assessment and preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging using task (n-back) and resting-state scans. Thirteen patients had postoperative cognitive assessment. An index of patient-specific functional connectivity in the FPN was derived by aver"
