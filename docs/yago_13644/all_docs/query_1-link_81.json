        "text": "Stephen Graham & Hannah Walters Graham (m. 6 June 2008 - present) (2 children)\n\nStephen Graham's wife, Hannah Walters, is said to have helped him recover from a dark period in his life.\n\nStephen Graham once revealed the heartbreaking story of how his wife came into his life.\n\nThe Liverpool-born actor met his wife, Hannah Walters, at drama school in the 90s, but their relationship didn’t come to fruition until many years after that.\n\nHis now-wife of 15 years was living in Spain for a while and returned back to the UK with plans to move over there for good. It was then that the Bodies actor made a confession that she had been waiting to hear for over five years.\n\nIn an interview with Desert Island Discs in 2019, he revealed that in his twenties he didn’t quite know what he wanted in regards to relationships, but Hannah moving to Spain permanently was the wake up call he needed.\n\nHe said: “She went to Spain for a little bit and I couldn't see her, and she was going to move out there. She came back and we hadn't been on a date in these five years, six years, just talking lots. And I said 'can I take you on a date?'\n\n“She went 'what?' And we went to see Saving Private Ryan, had a bite to eat in Greenwich and we were at New Cross train station and I said 'Please don't go to Spain'.\n\n\"She asked 'why?' and I said 'Well, I love you.' She said she'd been waiting five years for me to say that. “And the next day we moved in together. And we've been together ever since.\"\n\nGraham also touched upon how his wife has helped him through some incredibly dark periods, including struggles with his mental health and a failed suicide attempt.\n\nHannah married her husband Stephen Graham on June 6, 2008. The pair met when they were in training at the Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance.\n\nGrowing closer in 2006, while filming the British drama This Is England, they chose to tie the knot two years later.\n\nStephen told Entertainment Daily that the two of them were friends before they started their relationship.\n\nMeanwhile in 2021, Hannah told The Mirror: “Twenty-eight years we’ve known each other. I’m going to be honest - the secret is that it’s me fancying my best mate.”\n\nShe added: “I want to kill him at times… but I just adore him.”\n\nThe couple got married in 2008, and now have two children together, Grace and Alfie. And the pair have actually starred in dramas and films alongside each other quite frequently - including Shane Meadows' This Is England series and the more recent Boiling Point film and series.\n\nTogether Hannah and Stephen have welcomed two children. The couple have a son named Alfie, and a daughter called Grace.\n\nThe family live together in Ibstock, Leicestershire.\n\nIn King Charles III's first New Year Honours List, Graham was appointed an OBE (Order of the British Empire) for his services to drama. But the actor decided to dedicate his prestigious honour to his mum, who passed away last year.\n\nWriting on Twitter, he said: \"This incredible, inspirational, woman & the purest heart my mum passed away. Her words as a child 'no one is above you and no one is below you all are equal' have remained with me throughout my life.\"\n\n\"I feel so honoured and proud to share this with her An OBE for both of us mum.\"\n\nThe couple often appear alongside each other, and have starred in multiple projects together.\n\nShe starred alongside him in Shane Meadows's This Is England, This Is England '88 and This Is England '90, where she played Trudy.\n\nOther productions they have both appeared in together include Boiling Point, Walk Like A Panther, Funny Cow, and Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nSpeaking of how his wife helps him prepare for his roles, Stephen told a press conference in 2020: \"I'm dyslexic so I struggle. My missus reads the script and says whether or not I'm doing it.\n\n\"She's made some good choices.\"\n\nThe couple also appeared alongside each other the gritty BBC One prison drama, Time.\n\nBut she said that she got the job as they had \"quite good chemistry\", before joking: \"It would have been shocking if we didn't!\"\n\nSpeaking in an online Q&A about Time, the actor said of his wife: “I watched Hannah back in the day at drama school and always thought she was brilliant.”\n\nOn the series, Stephen played prison guard Eric McNally, while Hannah played his character's wife Sonia McNally.\n\nSpeaking about getting the role, Hannah revealed to Radio X that she was embarrassed when her husband put her forward for the part of his on-screen wife."
