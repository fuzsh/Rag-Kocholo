        "text": "Many documents from old Hong Kong, e.g. Governmental Reports, have been digitized and are available online. Unfortunately, most of them are only photos of the old books/pages. Although available as pdf-files, they are just images. So re-typing is necessary.\n\nThe only way to convert theses images to text (e.g. word) is the use of an Optical Character Recognition software (OCR). On the internet, I found one than can be used free of charge (of course, it's full of adverts). The website is FREE ONLINE OCR SERVICE. I tested it and it works quite satisfactorily. Just upload a file (pdf or jpg), select language and desired product (Microsoft word, excel, or text), start and wait some ten seconds for the result. The converted files can be downloaded and further processed. The website allows you 15 texts per hour without any registration necessary. Here are two examples.\n\nStraight text is quite easy. This is a jpg file from the 1891 Public Works Report.\n\nAnd this is the converted word-file:\n\nRe-construction of Praya Bridge over Bowrington Canal.—The necessary wrought-iron girders for the reconstruction of this bridge having been obtained from England, a contract was entered into with Messrs. CIIAN A TONG & CO. for their erection and for the. masonry work required ; and with Messrs. FENWICK & CO. for the construction of cast and wrought-iron railings in November last.\n\nThis bridge is 19 feet wide and has three spans of 29 feet 6 inches.\n\nOn examination it was found that the foundations of the piers and abutments of the old bridge had been considerably undermined. These have now been protected with sheet piling and a concrete apron laid.\n\nThe tops of the piers have been levelled ready to receive the girders.\n\nSatisfactory progress has been made by Messrs. FENWICK & CO. with the iron railings.\n\nAlmost perfect, only one correction necessary (CIIAN is CHAN).\n\nMore complicated texts are not that easy, but still faster than re-typing. See this one:\n\nAfter conversion, the resulting word file is this one: (just for this presentation, it's a screen shot of the word file only, because there are many layout and format markers that couldn't uploaded to Gwulo without creating too much confusion)\n\nQuite ok, but the program has some problems processing the two columns of text and reading some characters. Interesting to note that even the stains on the paper are converted (consequently to stains again that can be deleted easily). Some rearrangement was necessary, I made a table for the two columns of text.

Director of Public Works, Mr. Ormsby, C.M.G., sounded a note of warning to the promotors of the scheme with regard to the large amount of rock that might be found in Morrison Hill and pointed out that such develop­ment on the Island would be a very heavy tax upon the then inadequate water sup-ply.\n\nDue to the untiring efforts of Sir Paul Chater, Kt., C.M.G., the scheme ultimately received the sanction of Government in 1921 and resulted in the resumption of Morrison Hill and the passing of the Praya East Reclamation Ordinance No. 17 of 1921. After which the work was put in hand and carried to completion in 1930 by the Public Works Department on behalf of the participants—the Government being one of the interested parties.\n\nThis Ordinance provides that any accessory works involving additions and al­terations to the original scheme shall be undertaken from time to time as in the opinion of H. E. The Governor it is considered necessary or desirable for the proper fulfilment of the Scheme. Certain accessory works cannot be undertaken until the Royal Naval Arsenal Yard is removed to Stonecutters but these have been provided for on an agreed Estimate with the Naval Authorities so that it has been possible to ascertain the final cost of the work so as to enable lot holders to obtain their Crown leases.\n\nIn addition to the construction of the sea wall and piers and the actual filling in required for the Reclamation, the whole of the old drainage system as far back as Queen's Road East which discharged at the old Praya boundary had to be lifted so as to obtain the necessary outfalls on the line of the new sea wall, this necessitated not only the raising of the roads with all sewers and storm water drains but also the ground floor levels of some of the old houses.\n\nOn completion of the Praya East Reclamation Scheme, Government had con­templated constructing a roadway from th Grand Stand at Happy Valley to Ton­nochy Road with storm water culverts to take the Wongneichong Valley Drainage. This scheme had to be abandoned owing to the obstruction caused by the large core of solid rock remaining on the site of Morrison Hill after all suitable filling for the reclamation had been removed. The drainage was accordingly carried in its original course discharging onto the reclamation area at the Bowrington Canal Bridge which had to be reconstructed to meet the new conditions. A 36 feet wide nullah—an au­thorized work under the Reclamation Scheme—provides for the drainage through the reclamation to the sea front necessitating bridge connecting the roads crossing the New Reclamation.\n\nMr. Adam Anderson, B.E., B.A., R.U.I (the Engineer who has, through-out, been associated with this Scheme and who for the most part has been the officer in charge of the work)—in his final report now submitted—gives full particulars of the various alterations necessitated during the progress of the work and the causes for the increased cost over the original Estimate due to the many difficulties met with.\n\n-2—\n\nAlthough the final cost of the land per sq. ft. to the participants viz. $2.41 is in excess of the cost originally estimated in 1921 viz. $1.505—the scheme has proved to be in every way a very profitable undertaking.\n\nThe interests of the participants have been carefully guarded throughout and they have received from time to time the full benefits from the rents obtained for lands temporarily occupied during construction and all interest on any sums lying to the credit of the Praya East Reclamation account. These credits amount to approxi­mately $457,000 and participants' contributions have been accordingly reduced by this amount equivalent to approximately $0.20 per sq. ft. of allotted area.\n\nThe supervision charges include the payments made for the services of the clerks of work and Chinese foremen employed to supervise the construction. The amount debited to the cost of the work is very reasonable and in accordance with the Ordinance.\n\nH. T. CREASY,\n\nDirector of Public Works.\n\nHONG KONG, 30th June, 1930.\n\nFINAL REPORT.\n\nPRAYA EAST RECLAMATION SCHEME.\n\nHon : D.P.W.,\n\nThe construction of the above Scheme is now completed except the works included in the Reconstruction of Buildings, Boundary Walls, &c., rendered neces­sary by the Exchange of land at R.N. Arsenal Yard, together with a small amount of surfacing to the new roadway's. The new sites for the reconstruction of the Arsenal Yard Buildings and Boundary Walls have not been selected, it is not possible therefore to put this work in hand. Agreement however has been reached with the Naval Authorities as to the cost of carrying out this work. The surfacing of road­ways is being carried out under Contract and is now nearing completion, thus enabling the cost of the uncompleted work to be ascertained definitely.\n\nThe principal works carried out and comprised in the 'Scheme are as follows :--\n\n(a) The construction of 4,995 lineal feet of sea wall founded on pell-mell rubble foundations, deposited in trenches dredged to depths ranging between 21 feet and 31 feet below Ordnance Datum.\n\n(b) The construction of 193 lineal feet of Quay Wall in sloping blockwork on the seaward limit of the old Naval Camber and at the Western extremity of the sea wall. The depth of water alongside the Quay Wall is 16 feet 10 inches at low water. The Quay Wall is connected to Admiralty wharfage by the construction of a reinforced concrete wharf 23 feet in length. The Quay Wall and wharf were handed over to the Naval Authorities on completion of construction.\n\n(c) The construction of two public piers in reinforced concrete, one of these piers is situated at the end of Fenwick Road, and is, built T shaped, it projects a distance of 41 feet 4 inches from the sea wall cope and provides at its outer face a berth of similar length; the other pier is 120 feet 8 inches long and 35 feet 4 inches wide with four flights of landing steps and situated at the end of Tonnochy Road.\n\n(d) A Refuse Boat Pier projecting 58 feet from the Cope at the end of Fleming Road. This pier is constructed in sloping blockwork and provides 60 feet of berthage on its outer face having a depth of 15 feet of water below Ordnance Datum.\n\n(e) The filling in of the reclamation area, Naval Camber and Bowrington Canal, requiring 3,111,099 cube yards of filling material. This ma­terial was obtained from Morrison Hill, East Point Hill and other sources such as the spoil from works under construction.\n\n(f) The construction of the following lengths of sewers on the Reclama­tion Area :-\n\n27\n\ninches diameter\n\n600.5\n\nlineal feet\n\n12\n\n“\n\n3,790.4\n\n“\n\n12\n\n“\n\n1,106\n\n“\n\n9\n\n“\n\n2,215\n\n“\n\n5\n\n“\n\n14,527\n\n“\n\n-4—\n\n(g) The reconstruction of the following lengths of sewers in the back areas affected by the reclamation:-\n\n21\n\ninches diameter\n\n225\n\nlineal feet\n\n18\n\n“\n\n1,005\n\n“\n\n15\n\n“\n\n4,028\n\n“\n\n12\n\n“\n\n2,590\n\n“\n\n9\n\n“\n\n7,383\n\n“\n\n6\n\n“\n\n3,762\n\n“\n\n(h) The construction of the following lengths of storm water drains on the reclamation :-\n\n9”\n\ndiameter S.W.

Of these bridges, that on Hennessy Road is 100 feet wide and carries a double line of tram track, the bridges on Lockhart and Gloucester Roads are each 75 feet wide. The level of Leighton Hill Road was raised, this involved the reconstruction of the Leighton Hill Road Bridge.\n\n(k) The reconstruction and widening of a length of about 2,300 feet of the old Praya East roadway (now Johnston Road) to a width of 75 feet and a further length of about 3,600 feet of this road (now part of Hennessey Road) to a width of 100 feet. The construction of 2,080 feet of 100 feet roadway and about 13,645 lineal feet of 75 feet roadway.\n\n(1) The water mains laid in connection with the Scheme included:-\n\n3,300 lineal feet of 15\" diameter mains.\n\n780 „ 8” \"\n\n18,700 “ 6” \"\n\n(m) The reconstruction of the old Praya East Roadway necessitated the taking up and relaying of the Tramway track for a distance of about 5,000 lineal feet.\n\nThe works referred to in items (g) and (i) and portion of the works in (f) were undertaken by the Drainage Office. The works referred to in (k) were undertaken by the Roads Office and the works under items (1) and (m) by the Water Works Office and Tramway Co. respectively.\n\nContinued with 6 pages regarding costs.\n\n[work in progress...]\n\nI've been asked a couple of times about this, so I'll jot down some ideas here. These are based on my limited experience of publishing a couple of books about Hong Kong history (volume 1 and volume 2). If you've published a book, I hope you'll add your tips in the comments below.\n\nThese are the main steps involved:\n\nWrite\n\nEdit\n\nLayout\n\nPrint\n\nPromote\n\nProcess orders\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1. Write\n\nThe first step is to create the manuscript, and gather any photos / maps / illustrations that are needed.\n\nMy books are a collection of photos and stories. The process I follow is to start by posting a photo and its story to this website, sending it out as a newsletter.\n\nThen I gather a collection of these stories into a talk, and give the talk a few times. I'll need to create a few new stories and photos to fill in gaps, and modify the talk over time to improve sections that don't work well.\n\nFinally, once I'm happy with the talk I take its script and photos, and work on them to create the manuscript that fits the format of the book. I have a specific format in mind, so I create the manuscript in Word, using the same page size as the printed page, and inserting photos so that each page's layout looks close to how it will look in the finished book.\n\n1.5 Who will do the rest of the work?\n\nWill you work with a publisher, who will take care of the following steps, or will you self-publish and do the work yourself?\n\nA couple of clarifications: First, even if you work with a publisher, you should know what's involved in each of the following steps, and be prepared to get involved. You'll certainly need to work on the \"Promote\" section yourself, whatever the publisher does to help.\n\nSecond, even if you self-publish, expect to pay for professional help on several of the following steps. The goal is that a customer can't tell that your finished book was self-published.\n\nOriginally I thought I'd work with a publisher, but I was struggling to find one that was a good fit for what I wanted. Then a friend who'd worked in publishing asked why I didn't do it myself, as I could handle promoting and processing orders via the Gwulo website.\n\nI still needed help with Edit, Layout, & Print. I am lucky to have a generous friend who is a professional editor help me out with the editing. For Layout & Print I paid a professional print broker, who handled the printing and subcontracted a designer to work on the layout.\n\n2. Edit\n\nWe all have our own bad habits when it comes to writing. A good editor will catch and correct them for you. You can certainly benefit from having friends read your text and give feedback, but it's best if at least one of the people reviewing it has editing experience.\n\nAt the lowest level, the editor is correcting mistakes in punctuation and grammar. Stepping back, they can also help make the text more readable, eg by catching repetitive styles of writing that distract from the subject. At an even broader level, they can spot inconsistencies between chapters.\n\nIt's also good to have people read the text who have knowledge of the subject, eg Hong Kong's history. I ask them to highlight anything that:\n\nisn't easy to read and understand - eg that they have to re-read two or three times before they can get the meaning\n\ndoesn't sound right - we're trying to catch any historical errors before the book is printed\n\nThe goal at this stage is to catch all the problems that will jar a reader, so there's no interruption to their reading, and no reason for them to doubt your ability.\n\n3. Layout\n\nMake sure you have an ISBN number for your book, and that the ISBN barcode is printed on the cover. If you don't, you'll limit your options for selling the book.\n\nWhen you're given drafts of the book's cover, use a mobile phone application to read the barcode and check that it works. On the first layout of both of my books, the barcode had subtle mistakes that meant it couldn't be read.\n\n4. Print\n\n5. Promote\n\n6. Process orders"
