        "text": "— Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales defrauded an Ohio couple of more than $600,000 when he served as their stockbroker in 2000, according to records of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\nAn arbitrator in 2003 ordered Bales to pay more than $1.3 million in damages to Gary Liebschner of Carroll, Ohio, and his wife. By then, Bales was already in the Army, having enlisted in November 2001, less than two months after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to an Army statement.\n\nBales, 38, is suspected of killing at least 16 civilians in Afghanistan on March 11. He may face formal charges in U.S. military court as soon as this week, his lawyer, John Henry Browne, said in an interview Monday.\n\nBales sold Liebschner’s AT&T Inc. shares without his knowledge or authorization and purchased other securities, according to Earle Frost, a Columbus attorney for Liebschner. Bales collected as much as $16,000 in commissions in a single day, Frost said in an interview.\n\nLiebschner told WCPOTV, the ABC affiliate in Cincinnati, that Bales pocketed their money after they asked him to sell shares to cover medical bills. Bales never paid the money and the couple could never find him, Liebschner said.\n\nA telephone message left with Liebschner wasn’t immediately returned, and there was no answer at his door Tuesday.\n\nBales worked in financial services in Ohio from 1996 to 2000, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records. An arbitrator found that Bales “engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, churning, unauthorized trading and unsuitable investments,” according to a report on the agency’s website.\n\nBales and the other respondents in the case didn’t appear for the hearing, said W. Sean Kelleher, a suburban Columbus attorney. Kelleher said in a telephone interview that he represented the firm’s compliance officer, who is now dead.\n\nThere was another complaint of unauthorized trading of bonds filed by an Ohio woman on June 9, 2000, according to a report provided by the state Commerce Department. The record shows Bales denied wrongdoing, Lyn Tolan, a department spokesman, said in a telephone interview.\n\nIn Bales’ response, he said the principal of the Columbus firm where he worked executed the trades after he had resigned and blamed the troubles on him, telling “the elderly client they were my responsibility,” according to the state report.\n\nBrowne declined to speak with reporters at his hotel Tuesday after meetings with Bales. An e-mail to his associate Emma Scanlan wasn’t immediately returned.\n\nResidents of an Afghan village near where Bales is alleged to have killed 16 civilians are convinced that the slayings were in retaliation for a roadside bomb attack on U.S. forces in the same area a few days earlier.\n\nIn accounts to The Associated Press and to Afghan government officials, the residents allege that U.S. troops lined up men from the village of Mokhoyan against a wall after the bombing on either March 7 or 8, and told them they would pay a price for the attack.\n\nBrowne has said that his client was upset because a buddy had lost a leg in an explosion March 9.\n\nIt’s unclear if the bombing cited by Bales’ lawyer was the same as the one described by the villagers that prompted the alleged threats.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. military declined to give any information on the bombing or even confirm that it occurred, citing the investigation of the shootings. He also declined to comment on the allegation that U.S. troops threatened retaliation.\n\n“The shooting incident as well as any possibilities that led up to it or might be associated with it will be investigated,” Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said Tuesday.\n\nBales is suspected of leaving a U.S. base in Panjwai district of Kandahar province, entering homes and gunning down nine children, four men and three women before dawn March 11 in the villages of Balandi and Alkozai. Mokhoyan is about 500 yards east of the base.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Mark Niquette, Clea Benson, David Mildenberg and Michael Shepard of Bloomberg News; and by Mirwais Khan and Deb Riechmann of The Associated Press."
