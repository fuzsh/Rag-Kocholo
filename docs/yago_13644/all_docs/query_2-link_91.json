        "text": "Religious practices and their transformation are crucial elements of migrants' identities and are increasingly politicized by national governments in the light of perceived threats to national identity. As new immigrant flows shape religious pluralism in Europe, longstanding relations between the State and Church are challenged, together with majority-faith traditions and societies’ ways of representing and perceiving themselves. With attention to variations according to national setting, this volume explores the process of reformulating religious identities and practices amongst South Asian 'communities' in European contexts, Presenting a wide range of ethnographies, including studies of Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism and Islam amongst migrant communities in contexts as diverse as Norway, Italy, the UK, France and Portugal, Migration and Religion in Europe sheds light on the meaning of religious practices to diasporic communities. It examines the manner in which such practices can be used by migrants and local societies to produce distance or proximity, as well as their political significance in various 'host' nations, Offering insights into the affirmation of national identities and cultures and the implications of this for governance and political discourse within Europe, this book will appeal to scholars with interests in anthropology, religion and society, migration, transnationalism and gender.\n\nThis article examines closely the crucial link between religious conversions of two groups of refugees from Islam to Evangelism by taking up the cases of Afghan and Iranian refugees in India and in Turkey, respectively. India hosts many refugees from different parts of the world despite the absence of international protection laws, whereas Turkey is the country hosting the highest number of refugees since 2015, mainly due to the Syrian conflict. In this article, I first analyze the reasons why Afghan and Iranian refugees decide to change religious group membership from different sects of Islam and become members of the “born-again” evangelical Christian groups operating in South Asia and West Asia. By combining forced migration and religious identity issues in two different settings, I suggest that a combination of contextual and institutional factors explain this religious change and help us understand the sociocultural and political impacts of conversions.\n\nThe authors seek to contribute to academic debates on migration studies by examining the role of Islam in the integration of Muslim migrants into a multicultural society with a long-standing Islamic component. This study examined some transformations in the religious practices of both Muslim labor migrants and Russian indigenous Muslims in the situation of large flow migration from Central Asia to Russia. The results demonstrate that these transformations take place in both directions by bringing some Central Asian practices into the life of Russian Muslims and vice versa. The authors also pay special attention to the formation of solidarity between and inside these two quasi-communities. They conclude that social solidarity on the basis of common religion is formed inside migrant communities despite ethnic differences rather than between autochthonous Muslims and migrants.\n\nThe study aims to examine the religious lives of Afghan migrants before and after migration, their religious socialization in Türkiye, the problems they face in their religious lives, and to reveal how they evaluate religious life in Türkiye. For this purpose, the Evrenseki, Çolaklı, Yavrudoğan, Gündoğdu, and Taşağıl neighborhoods of Antalya were chosen as the area for research. The study group of sixteen men and five women was formed using the snowball sampling method on Afghan migrants living in these neighborhoods and working in agricultural activities, cold storage, greenhouse cultivation, etc. The data obtained through the in-depth interview technique was analyzed using content analysis. The MAXQDA program was used for the systematic coding of the data. As a result of the coding, the article examines the subject through four themes: the pre-migration religious life of Afghans, the post-migration religious life of Afghans, the religious socialization practices of Afghan migrants, and religious life in Türkiye as seen through the eyes of Afghan migrants. Also, it discusses whether Afghan migrants are developing behaviors to protect their religious personalities or foster social integration and cohesion. As a result, it concludes that Afghan migrants have strong religious identities but generally develop integration and cohesion behavior.\n\nThe western understanding of religion has tended to be narrowly focused on certain aspects of culture (beliefs about the supernatural and moral codes, for example) to the exclusion of other societal elements. Such a narrow understanding, when applied to non-western societies, particularly those that don’t even have a word for ‘religion’, becomes conceptually problematic. This makes understanding ‘religious change’ a treacherous minefield and yet an adventurous undertaking for the scholar of religion. Assessing whether a new religious system has taken root in another cultural context is contingent on how agents of the new have robustly engaged the discrete elements they meet within the old."
