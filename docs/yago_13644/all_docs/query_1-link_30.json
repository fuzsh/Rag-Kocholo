Because of the prophecy that Achilles would die in the battle for Troy, his mother Thetis hid him at the King Licomede's Palace. Achilles stays as a lady-in-waiting and falls in love with the king's daughter Deidamia. Because another prophecy says that the Greek army can only win the war with the help of Achilles, the cunning Odysseus sets off for Skyros. He presents Achilles with a difficult decision: should he follow his desire for military honor or his love for Deidamia? The balance of honor and love, which is the focus of Metastasio's libretto Achille in Sciro, often offered itself as ideal material for baroque wedding operas. Johann Friedrich Agricola's (1720-1774) setting was premiered in Berlin on the occasion of the marriage of Prince Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia in 1765. Agricola, who came from Dobitschen near Altenburg, was appointed court composer to Frederick II in 1751.
