        "text": "8 Apr â€“ Despite earlier reports stating that actor Alex Fong is done with having more children, it does not mean that the actor is not in love with his five year-old.\n\nAccording to Popular Asians, recently, Alex revealed that he has been using his vacation to spend time with his wife Hoyan Mok and daughter Fu Ka Ching.\n\nDenying rumours that he felt burdened by his daughter, Alex revealed that after the birth of Ka Ching, he was immensely happy to go through the change from being an actor to a father, stating, \"As a father, I must give consideration to my kid. I happily welcome the change.\"\n\n\"Once I finish my shooting for the day, all I will think about is returning home to see my daughter. I'm very happy when I see her!\" the actor enthused.\n\nAlex and Hoyan was in a 12-year relationship before the latter was pregnant with Ka Ching. They were married on 7 June and Hoyan gave birth two days later. Ka Ching has been Alex's first priority since then.\n\nMeanwhile, when speaking about his wife, Alex expressed, \"[Hoyan] is in charge of the household, and she takes care of it really well. She has taught our daughter to be well-mannered and polite. I am very thankful!\""
