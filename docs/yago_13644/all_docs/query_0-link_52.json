        "text": "2023\n\nFor solo performer with computer, MIDI breath controller, automated percussion instruments, speakers, color spotlight, color LED light bulbs; duration 6 hours daily, for the duration of the exhibition period\n\n”In Refrains and variations, an open-ended composition that reoccurs in short segments in different musical and spatial variations, the artist wears a binaural microphone headset, a special set of over-the-ear mobile microphones that stream the sounds being played in the space that closely capture the way a human hears. The feed from these devices will be heard through headphones in a smaller, domestically decorated space where visitors will be able to listen and watch Young carry himself to different parts of the room through windows facing into the performance space. The familiar surroundings, yet disembodied experience of listening in the viewing space is a physical reference to Alfred Hitchcock’s film Rear Window. The viewer is both separated from the action and intimately connected to it.\n\nA program generates the composition in real time, starting with chord number 0 at the beginning of each day.

The system that underpinned the work is important insofar that it helped to sustain a process in this particular instance for longer than if I were to rely on intuition alone; but ultimately the experience - a sequencing of music and images that is sometimes ordered, sometimes (more often, actually) haphazard - is probably more important.\n\nA. I started with a chart of 96 ‘color chords.’ There are 12 hues of color within the set. Each hue is associated with a key area. Lighter tints yielded chords with fewer varieties of intervals, and as the color tone gets darker the intervallic relationships within a chord become more varied and complex.\n\nB. The work of composing involved the arrangement of notes and sounds, but also the choreography other elements, including the microphones that ‘listened’ to the sources of these sounds. We used four kinds of microphones in this work: (1) a shotgun microphone, which is the most directional and has the shortest capture range, which I think of as the equivalent of a ‘tight’ camera frame; (2) an omni-directional microphone, a kind of ‘mid-shot’; (3) binaural microphones that I was wearing over my ears, which is a kind of ‘POV image’ of the room that moves with me; (4) a XY stereo pair, which is placed at the front of the room. 1, 2 and 3 moved around the room to explore a variety of listening positions and range, while mic 4 was stationary and stayed with the front-of room camera.\n\nC. Each color chord gave rise to a short composition of either 60 or 90 seconds. Each short composition was filmed twice in the same theater, each time with a different subset of compositional elements.\n\nD. The playback program stitches the individual clips back together in different ways and shuffles their order of appearance. In half of the time, the program will trace a randomly selected array of color hue, moving from lighter tints to darker shades. Once it reaches the end it will jump to the beginning of another array, until all 12 hues / 96 colors are heard. In these array-trace sequences, we see and hear the complete set of elements of a single color chord composition. There is a fifty percent chance that an array-trace sequence will be interrupted by a color mixing event: the simultaneous playback of either four randomly selected shades of the same color hue, or two randomly selected complementary colors. In these moments, subsets from several compositions are brought together instead.”\n\n2023\n\nMedia installation-theatre, 180 mins (live version); video with 4 channels of audio, 41 mins, 3D printed PLA, custom electronics (installation version)\n\nConcept, Music and Video\n\nSamson Young\n\nLighting Designer\n\nKaki Lai\n\nSound Designer\n\nGut Lam\n\nSet and Costume Designer\n\nAyami Oki-Siekierczak\n\nVideographer\n\nLeung Ho-sing\n\nMusicians\n\nWilliam Lane, Linus Fung\n\nPerformer\n\nWoo Yat-hei\n\nTechnical Director\n\nAllen Fung\n\nDeputy Technical Director\n\nChan Wing-kit\n\nProduction Manager\n\nKatrina Chan\n\nProduction Assistant\n\nMacy Tse\n\nCreative Coordinator\n\nThomas Yau\n\nProgramme Coordinator\n\nBecky Wong\n\nDeputy Producer\n\nMeredith Wong\n\nCurator\n\nBobo Lee\n\nDocumentation courtesy of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, image credit Winnie Yeung @ Visual Voices.

The 3-hour experience consisted of two almost identitical cycles of events.\n\n‘[Walter de la Mare’s The Listeners] asks that crucial question about poetry in general: who listens, and what does it mean to listen to the silence of the poem on the page, which is a silence always still asking to be voiced […] Hearing things in that house of poetry may lead to ghosts and phantoms, or to the memorable rhythm of urgent knocks, or perhaps just to those open, unanswered questions which were our own in the first place, but are returned to us, magnified, by the hospitable acoustic openness of the poem.’ - Angela Leighton, Hearing Things.”\n\n2017\n\nSilk-screen print on vinyl cover, felt tip pen on vinyl records, 3D-printed nylon, vitrine of found objects, movable curtain system, neon, video, animation and 10-channel sound installation\n\nFeaturing Michael Schiefel, 3d-printing technical support by Cosmo Wenmen and Andrew Crowe @Meta Objects, 3d assets by sazbolcs-vanyi91 @cgtrader, Andrew Crowe, and Cosmo Wenmen; movable curtain system production by Showtex; research and production assistant Vvzela Kook\n\n”A while ago I came across a story about a group of unemployed musicians from Cape Town who called themselves the Plaster Cast. They had released a charity single in response to Band Aid’s iconic ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’ Titled ‘Yes We Do’, Plaster Cast’s single was produced by singer-songwriter Boomtown Gundane. Proceeds from its sale were ‘donated to British schools to fund instruction in discipline, literacy, and contraception’. I sought to get in touch with this Boomtown Gundane, only to find out later that he does not exist; the story was a piece of fake news, originally published by the now-defunct satirical news website Hayibo — which was similar to The Onion — and had subsequently been re-posted as fact on several websites and blogs. In Palazzo Gundane (homage to the myth-maker who fell to earth), I give shape and pay tribute to the fictional musician, and imagine the world he inhabits.”\n\n2020, revised 2021\n\nVideo with stereo sound, 15 minutes 49 seconds, pastel on repurposed printed matter, pastel on acrylic, pastel on air-dry clay\n\nPiano\n\nGeneva Fung\n\nVideotography\n\nLeung Ho Sing\n\nLeung Tin Chun Jimmy\n\nLam Sing Yau\n\nFung Yiu Man\n\nAudio\n\nChiu Ho Chi\n\nFung Ka Wai\n\nProduction management\n\nVivian Leung\n\nChan Chak Kwan\n\nJones Lee\n\nSunny Liu\n\nStanley Mok\n\nTang Wai Fung\n\nLui Lee\n\nLee Yat Ho (HKAPA)\n\nPhoto documentation\n\nDennis Man Wing Leung\n\nThe work was made possible through a residency organized by Kayo Tokuda (TOMORROW), and Ryosoku-In in Kenninji Temple, Kyoto; further research was provided by Shunya Hashizume, Akane Takahashi (TOMORROW).

Throughout the video, Young captures the ephemerality of smoke — in particular, the various sounds that accompany its fleeting appearance. He also references the religious significance of smoke through incense burning. Sonata for Smoke was created as part of an exhibition organized and conceived while Young was an artist in residence at the Ryosoku-in Temple in Japan. The video consists of a sequence of actions and images that progress with forward motion across time and space, creating a sense of directionality. However, certain motifs and choreographies of events — including ritualistic sounds and actions — repeat throughout the piece. These consecutive, meditative acts were inspired by the temple setting and its arrangement as a sequence of rooms. Objects from the temple also appear throughout the film, including ceramics that bear impressions of its architectural features.”\n\n2022\n\nSound installation (generative audio, pastel on 3d-printed PLA, LED matrix, repurposed mic stand, speaker, cables, computer with custom-software, dimensions and duration variable, set of 24); video (generative animation, duration variable; computer with custom-software); three-channels video (duration 6:41, 7:43 and 9:44); digital print on carpet (3.6 x 2.7 m); digital print on vinyl on windows (dimensions variable); 3d-printed PLA (1.45 x 0.48 x 0.89 m; 0.21 x 0.18 x 0.26 m, set of 2); repurposed printed material (Chad Hansen, Tao Te Ching: the Art of Harmony, 5.88 x 3.18 x 24.77 cm); repurposed silk flowers (dimensions variable).\n\n“In Altar music (liturgy for an indecisive believer), the system begins by downloading a news headline of the day from the reputable indepedent media Hong Kong Free Press. An artificial intelligence algorithm (known as GPT-neo, which is an open-source version of Open AI project’s GPT-3 engine) then takes the headline as a ʻprompt,’ to generate a continuous stream of counter-factual news stories. The texts of these counter-factual news in turn become the basis for the sound output, which breaks the texts down by word-type, and with each word-type a different generative sound pattern is triggered. Elsewhere, a generative animation highlights discrete words from the news story as they come in, while dissolving the whole.\n\nOther elements that complete the installation include ʻinterpassive’ rituals (the prayer wheel that ʻprays in our place’, the machine that ʻchants in our place’, and the photocopier that ʻreads in our place’), and the recurring visual motif of three interlocking eyeballs, all facing inward: the iris that looks at itself looking.”\n\nPhoto courtesy of Galleria Gisela Capitain, photo credit: Simon Vogel\n\n2021\n\n7-channel sound installation (3D printed PLA plastic on repurposed mic stands, speakers, LED matrix), 3D printed PLA plastic with embedded electronics, two-channel video (channel 1: 18’24”; channel 2: interactive, duration variable), vinyl and custom software\n\nCommissioned by Art Jameel in collaboration with the Kochi-Muziris Biennale and Burger Collection\n\nThis project is open source.

The components within this environment are derived from the processing of the Daoist text Daodejing. Insights from computational analysis on the text’s formal features are filtered through human intuition to generate a network of sonic and visual objects.\n\nA ‘filtered’ version of the Daodejing - consisted only of nouns and verbs that also function as nouns - is deployed as training data for an AI algorithm (Tensorflow). The trained-AI, which functions as a quasi-reasonable automatic-writing machine, continuously generates new ‘teachings.’ These sometimes random, sometimes almost-insightful ‘teachings’ are further abstracted into live visuals, sounds, and 3d shapes.\n\nAs formal features progress further and further along a chain of events away from their origins, they are transformed, distorted, and take on new features.”\n\nPhoto courtesy of Jameel Arts Centre, photo credit: Daniella Baptista\n\n2019 / revised 2020\n\n2 channels-video with 2-channel sound, 3d printed PLA, repurposed found objects (opium pipe, tourist instrument, original print edition of John Barrow’s Travels in China); video duration 6:17 and 25:34\n\nMusic composition, text, set design, video editing\n\nSamson Young\n\nPerformance\n\nGeneva Fung, Samson Young, the Chinese University of Hong Kong Chorus conducted by Leon Chu, and Christie Wong\n\nVoice over\n\nDr. Christian Weikop\n\nVideography\n\nIp Yiu Tung Zachary, Lau Chun Sing, Fung Kai Cheuk, Leung Tin Chun Jimmy, Lee Chun Wai, Leung Ho Sing\n\nProduction management\n\n@ Jones Lee Production: Christy Ko, Donna Loy, Vivian Leung, Chan Chak Kwan, Ray Wong, Jones Lee, “Jonathan,” Henry Fung, Edward Lau, “Rocky,” “Elephant,” “Him,” Sissy Tang\n\nSound recording\n\nSamson Young, Teeda Lee\n\n3d-printing technical support\n\nAndrew Crowe @ Meta Objects\n\n3d models\n\nModified from “Venus de Milo (Aphrodite of Milos)” & “Discobolus (The Discus Thrower)”, SMK National Gallery of Denmark @Turbosquid; “The Three Graces at the Hermitage Museum, Russia” & “Michelangelo's David in the Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence, Italy”, Peter Edwards (Cool3DModels) @Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2445605) & (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2445538), CC by 2.0; “Robin the thinker“, lampmaker @Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34343), CC by 2.0; ”The Thinker at the Musée Rodin, France“, Bruce Stevens @Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2201627), CC by 2.0; ”Marsyas“, The Metropolitan Museum of Art @Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24042), CC by-sa 3.0.\n\nSpecial thanks to\n\nAlex Rehding; Tessa Giblin; Talbot Rice Gallery, St. Cecilia‘s Hall, and the Reid School of Music at the University of Edinburgh\n\nPhotos\n\nLily Yiyi Chan\n\n”For this work, the artist conducted a research project that follows the genealogy of the Chinese folk song Molihua (Jasmine Flower), a tune of some national significance that is frequently performed in the context of cultural diplomacy - official state visits and the olympics, for instance. The tune can also be heard as a quotation in the famous opera Turandot. Molihua was ‘imported’ into Europe through the British Empire’s encounter with the imperial Qing court during the Macartney Embassy, and after a period of propagation and rearrangement in Europe, the tune was ‘re-imported’ back into China in its modified form. The artist compares and contrasts the song’s transmission history with that of the melody of Japanese Togaku - court music that was imported into Japan from China during the Tang dynasty, which has since become as one of few extant sources of Tang music. In one of the video channels, a horse lectures the audience on the complexity of musical genealogy. In another channel, we hear an original composition that is played by, among other instruments, a touristic souvenir-instrument. Through the work, the artist examines the interactions that occur when a piece of music crosses cultures, to consider what it means to hear with the ears of another, and questions the notions of cultural purity and authenticity at large.”\n\n2018\n\n3D-printed acrylic sculpture with soft pastel, four 3D-printed nylon sculptures with soft pastel and colored pencil, 3D-printed rose gold, two framed watercolour and soft pastel on paper, costume with wool thread, artificial flowers, lamé, polyester, and silk flag, feathers with dye, felt-tip pen on drumhead, video with sound, 62 min 20 sec, silent video, 40 sec, 11-channel sound installation\n\nNESS software and NESS laboratory residency courtesy of NESS, Stefan Bilbao, Talbot Rice Gallery, and Tessa Giblin at the University of Edinburgh; research supported by the Talbot Rice Gallery, St Cecilia’s Hall, and the Reid School of Music at the University of Edinburgh; 3d-printing technical support by Cosmo Wenmen, and Andrew Crowe @ Meta Objects; sound spatialization support by Stephen Moore, mouthpiece 3d model adapted from “Smooth 7C Bach Trombone” by Boesfx Cvsupo @ Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2723035), CC by 2.0; “Vincent Bach 5G Large Shank Bass Trombone Mouthpiece Lookalike” by Brine James @ Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1744070), CC by 2.0; “7C Bach Trombone/Euphonium Mouthpiece” by dellagd @ Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:114129), CC by 2.0; video performance by Shane Aspegren, photo documentation by Ji Hoon Kim and Dennis Man Wing Leung\n\n”The work, Possible Music #1 (feat. NESS & Shane Aspegren), fills a room, and incorporates drawings, ambiguous, trumpet-like forms jutting from the brightly hued walls, and multiple speakers on the floor, each one sprouting fake flowers. The music coming from those speakers—intermittent, changeable bursts of complex sound—was composed by Young using some of the most unusual instruments imaginable. Indeed, these instruments only “exist” in Young’s imagination and in the digital realm: he created them using software developed by NESS (Next Generation Sound Synthesis), a research project at the University of Edinburgh. By feeding his chosen parameters into the algorithm they created, Young was able to find out what sounds would be made by brass instruments that defy the laws of physics: a 20-foot trumpet, for instance, and a bugle that operates when blown into with breath at 300ºC.”\n\nExhibition audio guide"
