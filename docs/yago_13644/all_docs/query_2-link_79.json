        "text": "Courtesy RT TV News\n\nThe Pentagon now has to deal with accusations by Afghans that it was not an accidental shooting committed by a possibly mentally-unstable soldier, but rather a planned revenge by US troops.\n\nResidents from the villages where the rampage took place claim soon after a roadside bomb accident that happened on March 7 or 8, some US soldiers came and threatened that the habitants would be punished for what they called ƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ…-supporting anti-US forcesƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ”š‚.\n\n“The soldiers called all the people to come out of their houses and from the mosque,” Ghulam Rasool, a tribal elder from Panjwai district said.\n\nAccording to Rasool, the soldiers told the villagers: ƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ…-A bomb exploded on our vehicle. We will get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people.ƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ”š‚\n\nResident of Mokhoyan village Naek Mohammad also described how the soldiers assembled the villagers. A US soldier, speaking through a translator, told the Afghans: “I know you are all involved and you support the insurgents. So now you will pay for itƒÆ’-¡ƒ”š‚ ƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ¢¢”š¬…” you and your children will pay for this,” Mohammad told journalists.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. John Kirby, said US officials have found no record of a roadside bomb attack against any army vehicles the Afghans were talking about.\n\nIt is presently impossible to confirm these accounts as the US military does not release information on such incidents if no coalition troops are killed.\n\nNews emerges of second Bales drunken assault\n\nMore hard-hitting facts about the accused soldier continue to appear in the media as investigation is underway.\n\nA woman named Myra Jo Irish claims that an ƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ…-extremely intoxicatedƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ”š‚ Bales forced her to grab his crotch outside a Tacoma, Washington, bowling alley in 2008. This led to a brawl with her boyfriend, whom Bales beat up in a second drunken assault in 2008.\n\nIrish said she was asked by BalesƒÆ’‚¢ƒ¢-¡‚¬ƒ¢-¾‚¢ friends not to file charges against him as “he was married and in the service, and it would destroy him,” the Daily Mail quotes her as saying.\n\nThe news of the brawl follows an earlier report that Bales was arrested in 2002 for the drunken assault of a security guard at a Tacoma casino.\n\nAllegations by some US military officials have also appeared in the media that the suspected shooter was drinking on a southern Afghanistan base before he allegedly left it to shoot his 17 victims.\n\nBales in court as massacre body count mysteriously rises to 17\n\nƒÆ’-¡ƒ”š‚"
