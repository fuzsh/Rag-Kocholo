        "text": "14th November 2023 – (Hong Kong) In a candid interview that defied the boundaries of conventional celebrity narratives, Sheila Chan, a renowned 54-year-old Hong Kong actress, shared an intimate glimpse into her life, loves, and battles. Chan’s revelations during a live stream with music composers Harry Ng Chung-hang and Brian Chow made waves, offering a rare, unfiltered insight into the life of a public figure.\n\nChan, known for her bold and outspoken character, held nothing back in the three-hour session. She discussed her romantic relationships, her struggles with mental health, self-harm experiences, and collaborations with industry heavyweights like Leslie Cheung and Stephen Chow. Chan confessed that she initially turned down an invitation to star in ‘All’s Well, Ends Well’ from director Clifton Ko due to a fear of fame.\n\nOne of the more shocking admissions came when a viewer asked whether she had ever slapped Hoyan Mok, the current wife of her ex-boyfriend Alex Fong Chung-shun. Chan’s response was brutally honest. “More than once,” she said.\n\nChan, who has been single for the past five years, expressed contentment with her current life. She confessed to travelling every couple of weeks, stating, “All I need is enough money to eat, drink, and be merry!” Chan, who lives with ten pets, said she didn’t feel lonely and didn’t think she was suited for marriage.\n\nWhen asked about the number of relationships she had, Chan suggested that they could be counted on her ten fingers. She spoke openly about her past lovers, including her first boyfriend during her modelling days, who was notably wealthy. She also mentioned past relationships with celebrities like David Ki Man-kit and Alex Fong Chung-shun. Chan clarified that she maintained a friendly relationship with most of her exes and even played matchmaker for Ki’s current girlfriend. However, she firmly stated that she would never rekindle an old flame.\n\nChan’s most well-known relationship was with Alex Fong Chung-shun, whom she dated for four years. There were rumours that their relationship ended due to Hoyan Mok’s interference. When asked about this during the live stream, Chan admitted to slapping Mok in anger more than once. She clarified that her anger was directed at Fong, who she felt had deceived her.\n\nIn a heart-wrenching revelation, Chan spoke about her struggles with mental health following her father’s death in 1991. She confessed to cutting her wrists, not out of romantic despair, but due to severe emotional instability. She admitted to battling mania, depression, mild social anxiety, and a lack of enthusiasm for anything."
