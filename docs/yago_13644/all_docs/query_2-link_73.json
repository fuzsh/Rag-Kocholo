PAYPAL.ME/RODRIGUEZMATUTE2\n\nWHAT MANKIND EXPERIENCED IN 1993.-\n\nThis year the World Trade Center in New York suffers a serious terrorist attack with damage to businesses and many injuries. The Czech and Slovak Republics are officially born after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia while Eritrea achieves independence from Ethiopia. The Medellin Cartel carries out several terrorist acts with car bombs in Bogotá and Medellin that end when the Colombian police manage to kill their leader, the fugitive Pablo Escobar Gaviria. The Bosnian city of Sarajevo is besieged during the bloody war in Yugoslavia while, in Burundi, a civil war begins and, in Sri Lanka, its president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, is assassinated in a suicide attack in the middle of that country’s civil war. An earthquake in Japan causes a devastating tsunami that leaves hundreds of deaths; Another earthquake in western India kills almost 10,000 and a third with a magnitude of 7.8 shakes Guam. A snowstorm affects the eastern United States, leaving almost 200 victims. In Texas, the Waco Massacre occurs where many members of The Branch Davidians sect die. In Venezuela, the Supreme Court ruling gives merit to the impeachment against President Carlos Andres Perez for the crime of embezzlement of public’s funds so he is dismissed; Ramón J. Velásquez is proclaimed Interim President of that country; months later Rafael Caldera is elected, for the second and last time, as President of Venezuela. The “Tragedy of Tejerías” also occurs in Venezuela due to the rupture of a gas pipeline on a busy highway with many fatalities. Violent riots and bomb explosions occur in Bombay, India, the North American Free Trade Agreement is approved, and the first version of Windows is launched. Yugoslav tennis player Monica Seles is stabbed during a match in Hamburg, while the entire Zambian soccer team is killed in a plane crash in Gabon. In Guatemala, the self-coup called “Serranazo” occurs and its president Jorge Serrano resigns days later. The Royal Plaza hotel in Thailand collapses with many victims while Nelson Mandela and Frederik de Klerk win the Nobel Peace Prize and singer Michael Jackson is accused of sexual abuse of a 13-year-old boy.\n\nPuerto Rican Dayanara Torres is crowned Miss Universe in Mexico City, Polish Agnieszka Pachalko achieves the second Miss International title for her country in Japan, Irish Niamh Kavanagh wins the Eurovision Song Contest with her song “In Your Eyes” celebrated in her same country and the Spanish Ana Reverte with “Enamorarse” wins the OTI Festival held in Valencia, Spain.

In the US, “MTV” begin broadcasting and Mexico “TV Azteca” is established. In the US TV, the series “Power Rangers”, “The Nanny”, “Saved by the Bell , the New Class”, and “The Late Show with David Letterman” are broadcast, and in Mexico the soap-opera “Corazón Salvaje” is released. The radios played the songs “I Have Nothing” and “I’m Every Woman” by Whitney Houston, “Please Forgive Me” by Bryan Adams, “The Power of Love” by Celine Dion, “Somewhere over the Rainbow” by Israel Kamakawiwo’ole, “A Whole New World” by Peabo Bryson & Regina Belle, “All that She Wants” by Ace of Base, “Bad Boys” and “Sweet” by Inner Circle, “Everybody Hurts” by REM “Hero” by Mariah Carey, “I Can See Clearly Now” by Jimmy Cliff, “I Can’t Help Falling in Love with You” by UB40, “Hasta que me Olvides” and “Suave” by Luis Miguel, “Mi Tierra” by Gloria Estefan, “What’s up?” by 4 non Blondes, “Two Princess” by Spin Doctors, “Will You Be There” by Michael Jackson, “Informer” by Snow , “Ordinary World” by Duran Duran , “Never I’ll Forget You” by Christian Castro and “Como Te Deseo” by Mana. In 1993 the video game “Mortal Kombat 2” went on sale and the Colombian Miss Universe Paulina Vega, the French Miss Universe Iris Mittenaere, the Colombian model Ariadna Gutiérrez and the singer and actress Ariana Grande were born. In the other hand, the Mexican comedian Mario Moreno “Cantinflas”, the singer and host of Miss Universe Helen O’Connell, actresses Audrey Hepburn, Ruby Keeler and Helen Hayes, the Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe, the musician Dizzy Gillespie, the actors Brandon Lee, Bill Bixby (My Favorite Martian and The Incredible Hulk) and Hervé Villechaize (Tattoo), the actor and musician River Phoenix, the Italian film director Federico Fellini, King Baudouin of Belgium and the Venezuelan politician Gonzalo Barrios sadly died.\n\nFORMER MISS WORLD IS ARRESTED FOR DRUGS.-\n\nThe former Miss World from South Africa, Anneline Kriel, was arrested at her home in Johannesburg on Wednesday June 30th on drug charges. Kriel had been detained with her husband Philip Tucker, 44, according to police. According to the media, the billionaire Tucker, son of a real estate mogul and a former Miss Israel, was captured with 561 grams of marijuana at the time of being apprehended and it was he who asked that his wife Anneline also be arrested. They were released on July 15 after paying an expensive bail. Two weeks later, Tucker accused his wife of snapping his toe during a shouting match outside their Hyde Park home. The divorce and the custody battle for her daughters Tayla and Whitney dominated the headlines. Finally they were legally separated in April 1994. Tucker died on the night of Sunday May 25, 2008 when he fell off the roof of his mansion in Sandhurst to the pool where he drowned…\n\nPRIOR NEWS TO MISS WORLD.-\n\n1993 was a fairly uneventful year for the Morleys. Happily they had ensured the hosting of Miss World with a contract signed by them and the Sun International company since the previous year and the contest would be held at the Palace of the Lost City in Sun City for three more years, so they were quite relaxed due to the success of the previous year’s event in South Africa. At first, it had been published in the press that actress Kim Basinger and the “socialite” Reva Kogan, who would be married precisely in the Lost City, had been invited as judges, but this did not happen in the end. On the other hand, on Tuesday 14 September the special program recorded by journalist Alan Whicker during the making of Miss World 1992 in Sun City, entitled “Whicker’s Miss World” (in reference to the original name of his show “Whicker’s World”) was aired through ITV.\n\nMISS BESIEGED SARAJEVO, A QUEEN OF BEAUTY AS A SYMBOL OF WAR.-\n\nThirteen teenagers, some with shrapnel scars on their slim legs, strutted on Saturday May 29 to compete for the title of “Miss Besieged Sarajevo”. Participants of the beauty pageant lined the stage in front of a crowd of spectators in a Sarajevo theater. All 13 contestants held up a banner reading “Don’t let them kill us” during the contest’s opening number. There was no talent show, no evening dresses, no probing questions about the future, no awards. Promoting the youth and beauty of that day was proof that Sarajevo could not be destroyed, said Rinko Golubovic, the show’s TV host and emcee. The title went to Inela Nogic, 17, a green-eyed blonde and self-styled motorcycle fanatic, who acknowledged being embarrassed by the competition because her boyfriend was in the audience. “I have no plans,” she said after winning. “I may not even be alive tomorrow”.\n\nOne judge was an officer of the Bosnian army, dressed in a combat uniform and with a yellow scarf wrapped around his head. He sat up stoically, holding an AK-47 assault rifle in his arms. The organizers first recruited 18 women between the ages of 15 and 19 to participate, but five dropped out of the contest due to objections from their parents or boyfriends. Local fashion designers and the Bosnian army organized the contest to boost morale as Sarajevo completed its fourteenth month of death and destruction under the military siege of the Bosnian Serbs. The final was supposed to take place on Monday , May 24, but had to be postponed due to a power failure.\n\nOrganizers said they were negotiating with the organizers of the Miss World pageant to allow the winner to participate in the annual contest if they were successful in negotiating. But this did not happen. Perhaps for the same situation of war or because the girl represented only a city and not to the whole country as happened with Miss Moscow in 1988. Her participation, as “Miss Besieged Sarajevo” probably would have to have slipped her out of the city under the glare of a sniper. Most of the city’s residents were unable to leave due to the Bosnian Serb siege. Like Srebrenica and Zepa, Gorazde was one of the few remaining focus in the hands of the government in eastern Bosnia. The rest were controlled by the Bosnian Serbs. All of them has been under heavy attack in recent months when the Serbs try to expel the last government troops and thousands of residents and Muslim refugees. Serbs took up arms in Bosnia after Muslims and Croats voted to secede from Yugoslavia dominated by the Serbs in February 1992. More than 138,000 people have been dead or missing. The radio report said Gorazde’s defenders had not lost ground, but residents called for UN monitors to be dispatched to the city. In Sarajevo, some 30 miles to the west, some heavy artillery rounds shook the city in the heat of the contest and the sniper fire remained intense. A deal to demilitarize Sarajevo had stalled because Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladic decided not to attend the peace talks at Sarajevo airport. The war-defying contest reflected the character of the 380,000 people living in Sarajevo at the time, residents trying to continue normal city life despite daily bombardment and sniper fire under military siege by Serbs from Bosnia that started in 1992 and lasted almost four years.\n\nThat crown was not the typical wish of a beauty queen. Instead of asking for “world peace” when she was crowned “Miss Besieged Sarajevo”, Inela Nogic displayed a banner that read: “Do not let them kill us”. Now she is the mother of two children, lives in the Netherlands and often visits her parents in Sarajevo. For the first time in two decades, she took the stage again where she once became one of Sarajevo’s most electric symbols of resistance. “Oh my God, how weird,” she said, covering her face with her hands and trying to hold back the tears. As if seeing the audience again with her mother in the front row, Nogic recalled the feeling of victory and raised her hands in the air, waving to the rows of empty seats. The last time she was there, she faced projectiles and snipers only to get to the contest and then again to come home with her crown. “It was crazy to do it during a war. But we tried to lead a normal life. It was kind of a defense mechanism that we all had”, Nogic said. Fourteen months had already passed since the Serb siege of Sarajevo, which lasted 44 months (11,825 days) longer than the siege of St. Petersburg during World War II. At the time, Bosnia’s calls for help only resulted in food parcels that the United Nations sent together with military observers, who counted the shells and reported them to the world. Nothing else. What Sarajevo residents really wanted was an end to death and destruction, the restoration of electricity, water and heating, to stop the 330 projectiles that slammed into the city every day.\n\nMore than 11,500 civilians in what is now the Bosnian capital were killed from April 1992 to March 1996, including some 1,600 children. Defying the siege, residents staged musicals and movie screenings in basements, trying to prove to themselves and the rest of the world that they were “indestructible,” according to the organizers of the bizarre beauty pageant. “There were numerous calls to end this war; we asked for help in every possible way , but nothing worked”, she recalled. “So this was another protest to get attention and get someone to do something. We just wanted this war to end”. The smile of Nogic and the famous banner inspired the Irish rock group U2 to create a song dedicated to her and her city, “Miss Sarajevo”, which used to be played with Luciano Pavarotti. At a U2 concert in Sarajevo in 1997, two years after the war ended, leader Bono led Nogic by the hand on stage as he sang “Here she comes, heads turn, here she comes, to take her crown”. Until today, the image of a beloved 17 – year unfolding the historic banner is part of almost all videos that have been seen about besieged Sarajevo. “Mom made me enter the contest”, Nogic said, adding that she never expected anything from it. “It took me a long time to realize that I became a symbol”.\n\nNATIONAL COMPETITIONS.-\n\nThis year, the People’s Republic of China (whose election was attended by Julia Kourotchkina, Miss World 1992), Lithuania (after several years of failed attempts) and the brand-new Czech and Slovak Republics would debut in the contest, replacing the now defunct Czechoslovakia, while Zimbabwe returned to the event after a 10-year absence. Several countries canceled the rights of Miss World this year for not being able to afford it or for lack of interest. They were Antigua, Belize, Egypt, Guyana, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea. Yugoslavia also declined due to the issue of being a country accused of war crimes and isolated globally by the UN, and Bophuthatswana, which was again prevented from participating because Apartheid policies were slowly being dismantled in South Africa. In Ghana, Greenland, Hungary, Kenya, Seychelles and Zambia there were no national contests nor nomination of any candidate for Miss World, while other countries, which did not hold a national contest, appointed a representative. In the Dominican Republic they selected one of the finalists for 1992, Lynn Álvarez, who had been Miss Dominican Universities; In Argentina, Viviana Carcereri, who was the National Harvest Queen of 1992, was appointed, while in Ecuador and Honduras they did a casting where they chose Danna Saab and Tania Bruchmann for Miss World ’93.

The finalists were Tanja Krstič and Sergeja Heric. In the contest competed 12 girls, chosen as semifinalists in several rounds of eliminations.\n\n* MISS WORLD CANADA.- It was held in Toronto on Saturday, September 25 and the winner was Tanya Memme, Miss St. Catharine’s. The first runner-up was Miss Red Deer, Katherine Grefner at the event in which many contestants complained about poor organization. Some contestants charged to the organizer of the contest of starving them and to create an organizational nightmare. But the organizer Roy Pinnock said the contest was not disorganized and that he fulfilled the terms of his contract with the contestants. More than half of the 45 contestants, aged 16 to 25, accused Pinnock that he made them wait up to 17 hours for meals and did not provide them sightseeing, security at the hotel and chaperones as promised. But Pinnock denied the allegations and said he gave them all three meals a day. The girls had to pay up to $ 4 000 to enter the pageant.\n\n* MISS POLAND.- On Sunday, September 26, in the Congress Hall of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, this event was held where Alexandra Spieczynska was the winner among 20 participants, and was sent to Miss World. The finalists turned out to be Renata Gabryjelska and Ilona Felicjańska and the Top 5 was completed by Joanna Brykczyńska and Agnieszka Ciesielska.\n\n* MISS HRVATSKE.- The final of Miss Croatia was held on Sunday, October 3 in Zagreb, with Fani Capalija winning towards Miss World. The finalists were Ljuba Ljubičić and Sandra Mihaljević.\n\n* MISS UNITED KINGDOM.- After being a finalist in 1990, Amanda Johnson from Nottingham won the 1993 British pageant on Monday 4 October at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, an event in which 20 young ladies competed. The finalists were Miss Sussex, Lucy Kennet and Miss Essex, Natasha Taylor.\n\n* MISS BRAZIL WORLD.- Once again, the Ginásio do SESI in Maceió, Alagoas, was the venue for the contest on Friday, October 15, where the local candidate, Lyliá Virna Menezes Soriano, who was sent to South Africa for Miss World, won. The finalists were Érika de Oliveira Albiero from Sao Paulo and Regiane Cristina Cavalli from Paraná. The Top 5 was completed by Vanessa de Souza Gurgel from Rio Grande do Norte and Elisângela de Souza Dutra from Rondonia. 27 ladies participated.\n\n* MISS CURACAO.- It was held on Saturday October 16 at the Centro Pro Arte with six candidates. It was won by journalist Jasmine Clifton on the way to Miss Universe ’94. In second place came the stewardess Sally Daflaar (Miss World ’93) and third was Emanda Flanders.\n\n* MISS WORLD REPUBLIC OF CHINA (TAIWAN).- The election of Miss World Republic of China was held on Friday, October 29 in Taipei. It was won by Long Wei-yen who grew up in the United States and participated directly in the finals with the title of “Miss Chinatown”. The finalists were Zhang Ziying and Gu Xiangling. The beauty contest attracted students abroad to return to Taiwan to participate in the contest, but the losers questioned the triumph of Long Wei-yen because she could not express herself well in Mandarin. In mid-November 1993, Tang Rirong, president of the Beauty Pageants Association, was condemned by many ruling and opposition legislators for a photo sitting in a golden chair with the head of a tiger on his feet and accompanied by beautiful women from both sides. The photo was subsequently published in “World Geography Magazine” and “World News Report” and other international media, condemning the lack of ecological conservation concepts and calling it detrimental to Taiwan’s international image. Therefore, some lawmakers suggested that the beauty contest should be suspended, and some politicians said the government should strictly review the qualifications of beauty pageant organizers.\n\n* MISS 1993 WORLD AMERICA & MEXICO.- For the first time in history, the Miss World America and Miss World Mexico contests were held together on Thursday, November 4 at the Abraham Chávez Theater in El Paso, Texas. 43 candidates from the American Union and 19 from the United Mexican States participated. The Miss World America 1993 winner was Maribeth Brown, Miss Massachusetts and Miss World Mexico was Elizabeth Margain, Miss Sonora. The American finalists were Emily Vineyard (Texas) and Audra Wallace (South Carolina) while the Mexican finalists were Zereth Hernández (Chihuahua) and Magali Victoria Gómez Paz (Guanajuato). The semifinalists were completed by Melissa Brewer (Alabama), Angela Holbrook (North Dakota), Susan Thomas (New Jersey), Shannon Clark (Michigan), Sandra Manharres (Coahuila), Roxana Cortés (State of Mexico), Brigitte Schepers (also from the State of Mexico) and Lizeth Olivas (Chihuahua). The organizers, Guy Rex, had asked the local government for the sum of 50 thousand dollars to produce the event but that amount was rejected. In the end, the City Council awarded $ 30,000 and the County Commissioners Court gave $ 5,000 to help put on the show. The event was broadcast days later on Telemundo.\n\nCANDIDATES\n\nREPLACED:\n\nDID NOT COMPETE:\n\n“I AM NOT A HOOKER”.-\n\nIt must have seemed like a good idea at the time: the senator who defended Filipino femininity demanded an investigation into the upper-class meat trade of local models and artists in the filthy rich sultanate of Brunei. But for Senator Ernesto Maceda, the self-styled “Mr. Expose” of Philippine politics, the case of the “beauties of Brunei”, as they were called by the newspapers, seems to have failed. Far from the outrage and praise his earlier complaints of alleged wrongdoing in high places received, Maceda, on the other hand, was exposed to furious rebuttals from aggrieved actresses and counterattacks that were not alien to himself. The government was concerned that the whole affair could ruin relations with the neighboring Riyadh of Southeast Asia. The case highlights an aspect of the political system inspired in the United States that contributed to the stagnation of Congress to the Filipino style: a tendency for legislators to get bogged down in investigations that initially generated waves of publicity but often led nowhere. But the episode also exposed the apparent hypocrisy of some of the powers that be in tiny oil-producing Brunei, an increasingly strict Islamic monarchy headed by the world’s richest man. In early August, Maceda formally asked the Senate to investigate the activities of dozens of Filipino women, including some well-known actresses, who had allegedly performed as expensive prostitutes for an elite clientele in Brunei.\n\n“We have reports that more than a dozen beauty queens and several dozen other aspiring actresses and models have gone to Brunei” and returned with “instant wealth,” Maceda said. He cited reports in movie magazines and tabloids that women earned between $ 50,000 and $ 700,000 for a month in the sultanate and identified six actresses among the “beauties of Brunei”. “The reports definitely have damaged morality, decency, culture and the good image of Filipino women living in the country and around the world”, said Maceda. “In the interests of Filipino femininity, it is necessary for the Senate to investigate these persistent reports”.\n\nMost of those named denied having been to Brunei or claimed that they went there to work as models. Former star Vivian Velez, known for her roles in racy films, declared herself “surprised” by the “false and defamatory” accusation. Another named, Melissa Mendez, asked the ethics committee of the Senate in an open letter on Tuesday, August 10, to “intervene and protect a defenseless citizen against a ruthless politician obsessed with headlines”.\n\nBut the sharpest reaction came from the parents of actress and model Ruffa Gutierrez, 19, one of the winners of the recent beauty contest Bb.Pilipinas, scheduled to compete in the Miss World contest in South Africa in November. His father, actor Eddie Gutiérrez, challenged Maceda to a fist fight, while his mother, Annabelle Rama, called him a pimp. Rama remembered Maceda was accused of having procured women for the then President Ferdinand Marcos in the 1960s while serving as Marcos’ executive secretary, and accused the senator of being the conduit for a recent invitation to her daughter singing in Brunei for members of the royal family. Rama said she declined the offer because she was not allowed to go as a chaperone.\n\nMaceda, who has had long connections to the film community, called the position “absurd.” He added that some of the women have been seen boarding Royal Brunei Airlines flights in Manila, “and these are the women who denied having been to Brunei”. Senator campaigned for reelection last year as “Mr. Expose” based on several sensational campaigns denouncing irregularities against alleged corruption and misuse of government funds. But some colleagues joked that while the Senate rules provided for “investigations to aid legislation,” Maceda’s investigations were rather “investigations to aid his reelection”.\n\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, a small country on the north coast of Borneo, was ranked by Fortune magazine as the richest man in the world in 1993, with reputed assets of $ 37 billion. According to a 1989 biography by James Bartholomew, “The Sultan and his brothers had villas built with private beaches where they could have parties, as well as parties that were held in palaces that sometimes lasted all night. Women from various parts of the world they were transferred by plane to participate”. Since then, the 47-year-old sultan has shed his playboy image and adopted a more pious attitude publicly in accordance with his strict “Malay Islamic monarchy” policies, which prohibit alcohol and singing and dancing in public. But his younger brother, Prince Jefri the minister of finance, and Prince Sufri, who holds no government post, has maintained their reputation of playboys. “Basically, (the princes) need company and spectators”, said a Filipino source familiar with recruiting artists for Brunei. “They have banned alcohol; they have banned everything”, said another source. “The only place to have fun is the palace”.\n\nMeanwhile, the weeping beauty queen on Tuesday, August 24, denied prostitution charges made during a Senate hearing on allegations that some of the country’s best-known artists went to Brunei as prostitutes. Ruffa Gutiérrez, Bb. Pilipinas World said the charges could jeopardize her chances of winning the Miss World title in November. Senator Ernesto Maceda, citing newspaper reports, asked the Senate to investigate rumors that Filipino actresses, models and singers were visiting the oil-rich Sultanate of Southeast Asia as prostitutes under the guise of entertainment. Although he acknowledged that he had no proof, Maceda named Gutiérrez, an actress, and several other prominent Filipino artists, who were dubbed the “Beauties of Brunei” by the media. In addition to Gutiérrez, Velez and Mendez, Lea Orosa, Aurora Sevilla (Miss Philippines World 1984), Sheila Israel, Rachel Lobangco, Tetchie Agbayani, Maritoni Fernandez, Gretchen Barretto and Cristina Gonzales were also among the accused.\n\nOn the opening day of the proceedings, Gutiérrez denied having visited Brunei and demanded a public apology for the “malicious” charges. Maceda said his staff were still verifying the Brunei reports and would apologize if no evidence of the alleged prostitution is found. Maceda said that up to 1,000 women a year were recruited for prostitution in Brunei. Days later, Macedo, the senator responsible for the Brunei prostitution investigation, could face an investigation for making the accusation. The Philippine Film Interpreters Association asked the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Senator Ernesto Maceda following his allegations without evidence that some actresses were prostituting themselves in Brunei in exchange for a lot of money.\n\nThree weeks later, when interviewed by the media, Ruffa Gutiérrez said that “I will not resign because of the Senator’s claims”. The reigning Miss Philippines said she will participate in the Miss World beauty pageant despite widely publicized accusations that she prostituted herself in Brunei. She denied it at all times. She also brushed aside allegations that she had received $ 1.1 million for having sex with a member of the Brunei royal family. For his part, the Philippine senator named a Manila fashion designer and other individuals as alleged recruiters of film actresses for prostitution in Brunei. Maceda, who specializes in highly publicized exhibitions, said women who accepted the job used to travel to Brunei as models, when in fact they were going to commit whoredom with high officials of the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn the other hand, the Philippine President Fidel Ramos, expressed concern about the mentioned research that the Senate had been linked to Bruneians prominent with the alleged recruitment of Philippine beauty queens to serve as upper class prostitutes in the country, said an official of the palace. The official also said the investigation into prostitution could damage the country’s ties with Brunei. But the issue fell away due to a lack of evidence and diminishing public interest in the controversy. However, the Brunei scandal and similar cases of alleged prostitution opened the doors to a law that was eventually enacted against trafficking persons, especially women and children, the Anti-Trafficking Persons Act 2003 (Law of the Republic No. 9208).\n\nAFRICA CONSIDERS BEAUTY CONTESTS TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.-\n\nIn mid-July, two representatives of the Congress African National sent a secret memo to Cyril Ramaphosa, the general secretary of the congress, informing him “a breakthrough for the oppressed masses of our people”. The subject of the document was the Miss South Africa Competition. The representatives of Congress reported that they had faced the sponsors of the contest with complaints that 9 of the 12 finalists were whites. After “intensive negotiations,” the memo said they had extracted promises from a “training fund” to prepare future non-whites. The representatives drew attention to Ramaphosa to the next challenge facing the liberation movement: the Miss World contest.\n\nTo the stunned reporter who leaked the document, this was a silly and sexy distraction for an organization that was counting on being the next ruling party. Anyone else had been able to demonstrate that the African National Congress had a strange sense of what matters to South Africans. Few countries take beauty pageants as seriously as South Africa, where marital problems mundane of the Miss World 1974 still reported copiously on the covers where it was rumored once a member of the cabinet tried to fix the Miss World contest and Palesa Jacqui Mofokeng, the first black Miss South Africa, had silenced the accusations of symbolism by showing formidable poise as the African National Congress briefly contemplated the holding of its own rival pageant.\n\nThe obsession had been attributed by critics to the sexual hypocrisy of South African puritan society. It was said that South Africans adored beauty queens because they had no real nor Hollywood family. “In South Africa we don’t have celebrities as such,” said Palesa Jacqui Mofokeng, the new Miss South Africa. With the coronation of Mofokeng, South Africa had reached new levels of frenzy, most with good wishes, but much with bitterness. White conservatives claimed that the selection was a surrender to pressure from the African National Congress and even fans of the new queen said there were little doubt that this year the judges were looking for a black worthy candidate. The judges said the selection had less to do with race than substance.\n\nThe reflective comments of Mofokeng about death in the black townships outperformed the statements of the first white finalist who talked about her collection of stuffed animals. Since then, Mofokeng, who grew up in the black apartheid metropolis of Soweto, had silenced the inevitable accusations of symbolism by showing formidable poise in the face of a nasty invention: “I don’t like blacks”, one person announced when Mofokeng was invited to a radio show. She had also shown that she had more on her mind than beauty advice, the subject of at least three previous beauty queen books. In her first weeks as beauty queen, she has held strong views in favor of the right to abortion and against the African tradition of paying boyfriends, offered help to a center for women battered and led a peace march through from the black town of Katlchong. In an interview, even said she supported the right of activists black for democracy with disruption in the Miss World contest in November in Sun City, a city that was located in a black country run by a hostile dictator to the first universal elections in South Africa. The country had been readmitted to the Miss World competition in 1991 after a 13-year banishment for its racial policies. “It’s something very legitimate”, said Jacqui on the threatened protest. “This is something that can make people listen”, she said.\n\nPolitical views had generally been an obstacle for beauty contestants and especially for South Africans whose patriotic platitude was to be taken as a defense of apartheid. Anneline Kriel, Miss South Africa 1974, was trained so rigorously to avoid politics that she avoided even the most innocuous questions about her homeland. She then won the Miss World title when the original winner resigned, married two millionaires in a row, and in 1993 entertained newspaper readers with a battle to restrict her second husband’s right to visit their children. “She was the South African version of Lady Di”, said Doreen Levin, a reporter who covered 18 stories of Miss South Africa before retiring to write a book on beauty pageants. “She is still able to appear on the cover and it’s not for nothing that she says. Black finalists are rare”. Levin recalled that until 1976, South Africa sent two contestants to international competitions, a white Miss South Africa and a Miss Africa South nonwhite which was included to appease the outside world. Since then the competition has been integrated but the black finalists remained the exception. The year before, Amy Kleinhans, a mixed race woman, had become the first non-white woman to be crowned Miss South Africa.\n\nThe African National Congress participated in the 1993 debate because the Miss World pageant was to be held again in Bophuthatswana, a nominally independent black homeland where congress was prohibited. The dispute over the site soon broadened to the question of racial balance. But the coronation of Mofokeng silenced, for the moment, the debate on justice. Rocky Malebane-Metsing, one of the congressional representatives assigned to the Miss South Africa issue declined to specify what promises the sponsors had made to promote non-white contestants in the future except to say, “They promised to provide resources, facilities and exhibition”.\n\nARRIVAL IN LONDON.-\n\nThe first casualties of the Miss World 1993 contest were that of Miss BOTSWANA (Mpho Lekoko) because its organizers could not register her in time since her choice was made just days before the concentration; and Miss PERÚ (Mónika Patricia Sáez Grimm), apparently due to budget problems. The weekend of November 6 and 7 was the scheduled date for the arrival of the contestants from all over the world to the city of London, where the forty-third edition of Miss World officially began. Two of the participants, Miss USA and Miss Mexico, had to “run” and pack last minute bags as they barely had two days to prepare since they were elected for the world competition. Of the 87 girls originally expected, 81 of them arrived, two less than in the 1992 edition. Like every year, young people who had been chosen in the end could not reach the concentration. They were Miss ALBANIA (Sidorela Kola), Miss ESTONIA (Lilia Uksvarav), Miss ROMANIA (Rita Onisca Muresan), Miss TAHITI (Heikapua Thérèse Moke) and Miss UKRAINE (Irina Barabash). It was later learned from this last candidate that she won the Ukrainian national crown, apparently being married and supposedly pregnant at the time she had to travel to Miss World since months later she gave birth to her first-born. Curiously, the tricky organizers “fixed” her passport to be able to send her as a virgin and immaculate lady to Miss Universe 1995 in Namibia, being the debut of that country in the rival contest of the Morleys. And no one realized her true secular status… A final contestant, expected until the last minute, was none other than Miss PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Pan Tao Wang-Yin) who had reconfirmed her attendance at the world pageant, but that at the last minute she could not reach the contest due to visa problems. Her participation and the debut of China had to be postponed then to the following year.\n\nOn Monday, November 8, the annual Variety Club International luncheon was held at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, which served as the official launch of the 43rd edition of the world beauty competition. As usual, each of the competitors arrived with a typical gift that would be auctioned for the benefit of the children’s social works of the aforementioned club and, as every year, they wore their national costumes to the delight of the attendees and the lunch organizer, Jim Marshall, who happily received the contestants. Julia Morley was delighted to learn that more than half of the countries represented were collecting money to help children in their respective countries. And the Variety Club of Great Britain had raised about £ 7 million for its children’s charity projects the previous year. However, this presentation went unnoticed in London and the newspapers gave little or no coverage to this activity. On the night of Tuesday 9, the beauties went to Heathrow airport in the British capital to board the “royal flight” of South African Airways that would take them to the south of the black continent.\n\nARRIVAL IN SOUTH AFRICA.-\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday November 10, the 81 contestants arrived at the Johannesburg’s Jan Smuts Airport, wearing the banners of their respective countries, and being accompanied by Eric and Julia Morley, and they all were received by representatives of the hotel chain Sun International, Ina Perlman from “Operation Hunger”, Doreen Morris, as well as a group of children waving flags and banners from “Operation Hunger”, South African music groups and numerous media outlets. The children presented the girls with woven bracelets as a welcome gift while a choir sang a theme in Zulu called: “Everyone comes to see the lovely beauty queens”. The previous year, the contest had been brought to South Africa to promote the opening of the Palace of the Lost City, and this year, Sol Kerzner wanted to promote Sun City as an international tourist destination. Kerzner had decided to sign a contract with the Morleys for an additional three years for an undetermined amount, which would allow him to produce the event and, in exchange, he would receive worldwide television rights and three years of free advertising for Sun City. In addition to the Miss World contest, a massive Elton John concert in the Valley of the Waves and the 13th millionaire golf championship with 12 international golfers were planned.\n\nThe newcomers, both the candidates and the Miss World staff, were honored with words of welcome, food and music by the South African singer Thapelo Mofokeng, who delighted everyone with the song “What a Wonderful World” imitating Louis Armstrong, in a private hangar at the Johannesburg airport. Eric Morley, in his speech, addressed the beautiful participants and said: “We hope that you ladies, when you return to your countries, tell what South Africa really is … it is multiracial and will soon be booming again”. Then 65-year-old Ina Pearlman took the microphone to explain what her foundation “Operation Hunger” was before everyone left on buses for Sun City. Perlman was the third component in this alliance of the Morleys and Miss World, along with Sol Kerzner, who with his sponsorship had saved from ruin an institution that was about to die after a near-failed show in Atlanta in 1991 where the Morleys lost a lot of money. Kerzner’s company, Sun International, had promised to donate a large sum of money for rural development projects in 1994 and another to benefit Perlman’s “Operation Hunger.” “Frankly, the half a million rand that I will have after this little exercise is money I desperately need. I will not deal with blatant oppressors. But if Sun International does business in these lands, I can bear it. Investigating my donors with the utmost care is a luxury I cannot afford”, Ms. Ina Perlman told a journalist.\n\nMISS LEBANON POSES WITH MISS ISRAEL AND A SCANDAL IS FORMED.-\n\nMiss Lebanon, Ghada Turk, 21, faces a possible trial for posing for a photograph smiling shoulder to shoulder with Israel’s competitor, Tamara Porat, 18, in the Miss World pageant in Johannesburg. Lebanon was officially at war with Israel, and that “pose of friendship” between two beauties from countries at war could lead Miss Lebanon to be sentenced to three years in prison. Lebanese Tourism Minister Nicolas Fattouch said he brought charges against her for the mistake. The photo in question appeared on Thursday, November 11, on the pages of most of the nine Beirut newspapers with scathing captions. “It is a scandal,” wrote the pro-Syrian newspaper Ash-Sharq, prompting the government to order Miss Lebanon to return home immediately. “Miss Lebanon … looks extremely happy next to Miss Israel” published the conservative daily Nida al-Watan. “It appears that Lebanon has inadvertently started a normalization process with Israel”. Minister of Tourism, Nicola Fattoush, told the newspaper Al-Anwar that Miss Lebanon was “responsible for legal proceedings” because Lebanon was technically at war with Israel. Despite the progress of peace negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Palestine, the Lebanese and Syrian roads remained deadlocked. Lebanon was one of four Arab nations participating in the peace process in the Middle East sponsored by the United States.\n\nCONTEST ACTIVITIES.-\n\nThe first activities of the young contestants began the next day with their collaboration with “Operation Hunger” visiting low-income villages around Sun City (which by the way the South Africans called ‘Sin City’) and bringing food to the neediest children as part of the project and motto of the contest: “Beauty with a Purpose”. The group was joined by Zinzi, the daughter of Nelson Mandela, who was part of the “Operation Hunger” team. Asked by the press after taking a photo with Miss Australia under an acacia tree, Zinzi said “Look, I cannot give my real opinion of all this because I am here with charity”. In one of the tents that functioned as a school, a teacher tried to calm the children, who were crying waiting for their breakfast, by asking them to sing “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” to Julia Morley. Meanwhile, Miss Denmark was wandering around taking photos for which she received a scolding from Mrs. Morley: “No cameras now. We are here to learn.” While Miss Sweden, overcome by the severity of her environment, burst into tears. By the way, the Swede was one of the contestants most besieged by the press since, upon arriving at the airport, the breeze lifted her skirt and the photojournalists realized that she was not wearing underwear…\n\nA gala dinner called “Miss World Hunger Banquet” was also organized in the Royal Great Hall in Sun City on Sunday, November 14, with the presence of the beautiful contestants and some 800 people who had paid a large amount of money for the succulent and a luxurious dinner with exotic dishes, delicious desserts and where the Misses were forbidden to dance with the audience and smoke in public. “It’s not a good image for the girls if they are found with a cigarette in their hands, isn’t it?” Julia Morley said. Only on special occasions they were allowed a glass of wine, but generally there was a soda-only policy. At this dinner, a second set of national gifts that each of the contestants brought from their respective countries was also auctioned, but on this occasion, the proceeds would benefit Ina Perlman’s “Operation Hunger” foundation. Both the attendees and some of the candidates took home a “chocolate black boy” as a souvenir.\n\nIn the following days, the competitors posed in swimsuits for the press at the Amphitheater of the Lost City, filmed a central musical number in different parts of the resort, with a soundtrack composed and arranged by Bryan Schimmel for the 1993 Miss World contest. This video was created and directed by Ken Warwick and was designed to showcase the Sun City resort. They also had time to practice golf, they taped their introductions wearing bathing suits and filmed the opening with the national costumes in different locations of the Lost City and the Valley of the Waves, along with models wearing African costumes and the flags of the participating countries, as was done the previous year. Miss Venezuela wore a fancy liqui-liqui as her costume. In their free time, the candidates could enjoy the Valley of the Waves facilities, always accompanied by their chaperones, but they were forbidden to enter the casino, not even for a quick play on the slot machines. “It’s for our own good,” said Miss UK, a photographic and runway model. The contestants were divided into groups of 10 according to their languages, each with a chaperone, and each group had to be together all the time, even to go to the bathroom. And so that any “naughty” contestant would escape, there were security officers at the elevator doors and emergency stairs on each of the three floors the candidates occupied in the sumptuous Palace Hotel.\n\nThe most “complainers” were the European girls, who lamented not being able to go to the casino or go for a drink. “When I saw that big ad for ‘Entertainment’ out my window, I wanted to go, but they wouldn’t let me”, complained Miss Germany. “Being Miss World is my greatest dream” said Miss Belgium sarcastically, tired of so many prohibitions. Imprisoned in their rooms at night, some girls criticized their own imperfections. “I have the ugliest toes in the world” complained Miss Namibia, while her roommate, Miss South Africa, said “And I have the ugliest feet in the contest”. Some of the participants hurt their cheeks from smiling so much. To avoid this, Miss Philippines said following the advice of her aunt and not was none other than think of beautiful things. “That’s why I think of unicorns, flowers and sunlight and that makes me smile naturally. I read that in The Little Prince”, said the beauty queen. Others made fun of the dresses of the other candidates. “hang her from the Christmas tree” said one of the other while criticizing some of the competitors for their supposed plastic surgeries. “Some of the girls can be quite insensitive at times”, said one of the chaperones, Beatrice, who was in charge of the oriental group. She recounted an anecdote from one of her protégés: “In London I had to rescue Miss Philippines from the clutches of three Arab sheiks. One of them got her room number and called her on the phone one night”. Then Miss Philippines told her not to worry because she found the sheik was “horrible.” Later Miss Philippines contradicted herself saying that the external beauty was not the only thing that counted, but the essential thing that was invisible to the eye”… In the bookmakers, one of the great favorites was Miss Ireland with odds of 7-1. Below is the table with the data of the candidates:\n\nLAST DAYS BEFORE THE FINALS.-\n\nMany days were devoted to exhaustive rehearsals. On Wednesday, November 24, the judges evaluated the contestants who were interviewed for 5 minutes individually and then in bathing suits, in which the participants appeared in groups of three. In fact, Julia Morley decreed that girls could wear sarongs over their bathing suits if they wished. There, the panel of 10 celebrities along with Eric Morley chose their ten favorites in both presentations with the same evaluation system as always for the selection of the 10 semifinalists. This year the scores obtained by the participants neither in the preliminary round nor in the final were released. On Thursday the 25th, the candidates had a special Thanksgiving dinner and on Friday the 26th, the Dress Rehearsal was held at the Sun City SuperBowl, where the Miss PERSONALITY award was presented to Miss DENMARK (Charlotte Als) chosen by the participants themselves, and that of Miss PHOTOGENIC to Miss ITALY (Barbara Chiappini) selected by the photographers who covered the contest, awards that were not given in the finals avoiding to exceed the broadcast time. In the rehearsal, the representative of Colombia, Silvia Isabel Durán Angarita, was crowned Miss World.\n\nAs was customary, some girls came from competing in other international beauty pageants. Miss France, Miss Sri Lanka and Miss Uruguay participated in Miss Universe that same year. Miss Costa Rica was in Miss International ’93, Miss Norway in that same event but in 1992 where she was a semifinalist, and Miss Puerto Rico in 1990. Miss Uruguay and Miss Colombia competed in Miss Hispanidad Internacional 1993 and Miss Honduras in their 1992 version. Miss Norway had also participated in Miss Europe ’92, Miss Scandinavia ’92 and won the Queen of the Year ’93. Miss Guatemala was in Miss Asia-Pacific ’93, Miss France in Miss Europe ’93, Miss Sweden in Best Model of the World ’92 where she came second and Miss Philippines in Look of the Year 1992. Younger candidates were Misses Bulgaria and Malta aged 17, and the oldest, Miss Curacao and Miss Korea at 25.\n\nLESBIAN REPORTER MADE JULIA MORLEY UPSET.-\n\nThe organizers of the Miss World contest were furious with those in charge of the British television, who sent a lesbian presenter to interview the candidates for that title of beauty. The London popular press reported that Andrea Rea, known as “Huffty” and declared a lesbian, traveled to Sun City to do interviews for “The Word” on British television channel 4. The outrage started when Huffty said the contestants had “beauty, body and boobs” which angered Julia Morley and several of the entrants. “I will not allow you to talk about women in that way,” said Miss Jamaica, while Miss South Africa called the use of such expressions “rude”. However, producers of the program defended the presenter, who dressed in men’s suits and had her head shaved. For Huffty it was like a dream come true to be among so many pretty girls. “I think the organizers were a bit surprised by their sexuality”, said a spokesperson for “The Word.” Huffty, fierce-looking, was shouted, humiliated and reduced to tears by Julia Morley, after she tried to file a transmission competition of Miss World as “glamour, glitz and tits”. The aforementioned program, however, aired on British TV on Friday, November 26.\n\nPROGRAM BOOK\n\nTHE FINALS.-\n\nAt 7 p.m. on Saturday, November 27, the show began at the SuperBowl in Sun City, filled with about 6 thousand spectators, with live and delayed transmission for about 70 countries around the world thanks to M-Net, with production by Combined Artists, directed by William C. Faure and distributed to the world by Trans-World International. In the United Kingdom it was broadcast by cable through Sky One. Julia Morley said that for the following year they expected to sign an exclusive broadcast contract with one of the large US TV channels and that she hoped in the same way, that the event in Britain will be broadcast again on the BBC or ITV in the near future. In Venezuela, due to a satellite problem, the contest was not shown the same day as usual, although it was announced its transmission at 6 pm on Saturday November 27 (usually hours after broadcasting the end of the contest in primetime on the issue of time difference , but was broadcast on the Venevisión screens in January 1994.\n\nThe opening of the transmission featured a pre-recorded video with the still reigning Miss World, Russian Julia Kourotchkina, dressed in an electric blue dress, officially welcoming the event from the Sun City Bridge of Time. Then a voice invited onstage to the South African singer PJ Powers, Chrissy Caine, Vicky Sampson, Sam Marais and Jon Cecil to start opening up the contest singing the anthem of this edition, with a male ballet, and the 12-year-old child Neil Joubert, who was a member of the Drakensberg Youth Choir. The theme music chosen this year was “Let It Be Right In The World Tonight” composed by South African songwriter Duncan Faure.\n\nLYRICS OF THE SONG ” Let It Be Right In The World Tonight”\n\nLet it be love,let it be right\n\nLet it be all the people in the world\n\nLet it be right in the world tonight\n\nStarting from you, starting from me\n\nAnd everybody that we see,\n\nlet it be Right in the world tonight\n\nThe more I see the more I learn\n\nThe more I wait the more all turn\n\nTo another day of freedom\n\nAnother day of lookin in and\n\nLooking around looking out and\n\nSeeing life another way to believe in\n\nPeace on earth\n\nand they all said\n\nThat’s reality\n\nChorus:\n\nLet it be love, let it be right\n\nLet it be all the people in the world\n\nLet it be right in the world tonight\n\nStarting from you, starting from me\n\nAnd everybody that we see,\n\nLet it be right in the world tonight\n\nThe lonely man is not so alone\n\nHe’s looking out and seeing love\n\nAnother way of living life\n\nIt’s easier just to see\n\nThat you are the one\n\nIt’s clear enough for me\n\nBaby can’t you see\n\n(Peace on earth)\n\nThat’s reality\n\nChorus (5 times)\n\nThe “Parade of Nations” immediately began, showing on video the candidates wearing their national costumes in alphabetical order from the fields of Sun City and the Palace of the Lost City, accompanied by men dressed as African warriors carrying the flags of each country and a flag symbolizing the peace. While the viewer was watching the video, from a corner of the stage the girls entered wearing their national costumes and a flag bearer to go down to the stalls and parade for the audience along with the uniformed musical band of Penny Jones Promotions. The only candidates who did not appear on video but live from the stage were the contestants from Aruba, Bermuda, Curaçao, Israel, Mauritius, Paraguay and Sri Lanka, perhaps because their videos were not well recorded in the initial moment. While the parade continued in traditional costumes, singer Chrissy Caine performed the original song “Hand in Hand” of the group Koreana, while the songs “We Don’t Need Another Hero” was sung by PJ Powers, “From a Distance” by Vicky Sampson, “Love, oh Love” by Sam Marais and Neil Joubert and “Imagine” by PJ Powers, among other songs like “You are the Voice” and “Come Together”. At the end of the “Parade of Nations” all the contestants posed on stage while the guest singer George Benson arrived to conclude the opening again with the song “Let It Be Love In The World Tonight”.\n\nThe theme of this year’s event was peace, emblazoned on banners and flags and featured in songs by these South African artists and by special guest from the USA, George Benson. Such a star-studded lineup indicated how world opinion against South Africa had relaxed since President FW de Klerk launched political reforms four years earlier aimed at ending apartheid. With the country’s first multiracial election scheduled for April, virtually all punitive sanctions against South Africa had been lifted, including a cultural boycott that in the past prevented top stars from performing there.\n\nAt the conclusion of the opening number, the host of the contest, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, arrived on stage, accompanied by the South African entertainer Doreen Morris who would lead the event for the second consecutive year. After they thanked publicly Sol Kerzner for having brought the contest to South Africa again, the presenters called one of the members of the judges to the stage, the American actor Lou Gossett Jr. who announced the winner of the Best National Costume, which this year was Miss INDIA (Karminder Kaur-Virk) in a beautiful fully hand-embroidered saree. Before concluding the presentations, they called to the stage the British actress Jacqueline Bisset, who would later be in charge of presenting the previews of “Beauty with a Purpose”. The commentators this year were former Miss World Gina Tolleson and supermodel Kim Alexis, who had been a judge the year before. Gina said that her favorites were girls from Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the United States, Venezuela and, of course, South Africa, who was the crowd’s favorite at the SuperBowl.\n\nAfter the first commercial break, the comperes showed a video with the natural beauty of South Africa while on stage Mahlatini and the Mahotella Queens danced and sang along with the Miss World balllet and a group of Kids dressed in tribal costumes, the group Heia Safari Ranch and PJ Powers with the theme “Sanbonani”. The commentators explained the selection process and presented the formidable prizes that the new Miss World would take home for a value of 185 thousand dollars, among which were an Alfa Romeo Spider car with a value of 55 thousand dollars and two airline tickets in first class around the world from South African Airways to any of the 40 cities that the airline covered for a value of 35 thousand dollars; while Sun International gave a fully paid vacation for two, valued at $ 20,000 at the Le Touessrok resort in Mauritius, in addition to cosmetics for a year from the South African firm Justine worth $ 15,000 and the $ 60,000 offered by the Miss World organization for personal appearances during her year of reign. Following the awards presentation, Doreen and Pierce introduced this year’s panel of judges. They were:\n\n01- Eric Morley – Miss World Organizer and Chairman of the Judges without the right to vote.\n\n02- Christie Brinkley – American model, actress and businesswoman, wife of musician Billy Joel.\n\n03- John Ratcliff – President of Variety Clubs International.\n\n04- Dali Tambo – South African TV Personality.\n\n05- Vanessa Williams – Renowned singer and former Miss America.\n\n06- Juliet Prowse – Professional dancer with South African roots.\n\n07- Frederick Forsyth – British journalist and novelist.\n\n08- Jackie Chan – Actor and Martial Artist from Hong Kong.\n\n09- Twiggy Lawson – British model, actress and singer.\n\n10- Grace Jones – Jamaican model, singer, songwriter and actress.\n\n11- Lou Gossett Jr. – American actor.\n\nOnce the panel of judges was known, Doreen Morris invited the singers PJ Powers, Chrissy Caine and Vicky Sampson again to the stage for the segment “Women of the World” interpreting the musical themes “I’m a Woman” of the South African singer Lesley Rae Dowling and “I’m Every Woman” popularized by Whitney Houston, while the 81 contestants in their evening gowns performed in groups of ten on the stage. After the second commercial break, the presenters proceeded to announce the 10 semi-finalists in random order. They were:\n\nAs the semifinalists went backstage to prepare for their next performance, George Benson took the stage to perform his song “Give Me The Night”. Next came the parade in swimsuits of the 10 semifinalists, all the same from the Speedo brand while they were serenaded by Sam Marais and Jon Cecil with the songs “Dancing on the Ceiling”, “Dancing in the Street”, “Pretty Woman”, “Wild Women Do” and “You’re Looking Hot Tonight” to conclude the presentation with the theme “Simply Irresistible”. Miss Venezuela slipped and almost fell during her swimsuit show. Gina Tolleson commented that the best in this presentation had been Miss Croatia, Miss Venezuela and Miss South Africa, even though the latter kept physically eating hamburgers. The commentators presented the prerecorded musical video with the candidates called “You Won’t Forget Sun City” and which was filmed on the premises of the Valley of the Waves, the Lost City, the resort’s golf courses and the Pilanesberg National Park. The number concluded with all the unclassified candidates wearing swimsuits of the same color and design of the Speedo brand with sarongs on stage dancing to the aforementioned musical theme.\n\nAfter the third commercial break, came the parade in evening dress of the 10 semifinalists, again being serenaded by Sam Marais and Jon Cecil, this time with the themes “Love is a Wonderful Thing”, “Kiss”, “Everlasting Love” and “Love Will Keep Us Together” accompanied by the men’s ballet Miss World. At the end of their parade, each semifinalist told briefly what would do if became Miss World; poor Miss USA got her dress stuck on her heel and couldn’t move forward, finally being helped by Jon Cecil. Taking the microphone she said: “If I can speak after this, it would be a miracle!” The best message given, without a doubt, was Miss Jamaica’s, who said if she wins Miss World, she would “take the crown with humility and respect and try my best to be an ambassador symbolizing love and hope for less fortunate children in the world and I would endeavor to use the opportunity to become more self-sufficient to go after my career goals”.\n\nAfter a new commercial break, George Benson delighted everyone with his song “Love of My Life” from his latest album “Love Remembers”. Pierce and Doreen then called the 10 semifinalists to the stage to announce which of them would advance to the group of five finalists. The scores were audited by the South African accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand. The lucky five were Miss PHILIPPINES, Miss CROATIA, Miss SOUTH AFRICA, Miss VENEZUELA and Miss JAMAICA.\n\nEach one of them drew from a top hat the name of the judge that would ask the final question. Miss Philippines got Vanessa Williams who asked her “What would you say to a young woman who suffers from low self-esteem to make her feel better?” To which Miss Philippines replied the same thing she told the journalist days ago, citing the book “The Little Prince” that she would tell her to believe in her because physical beauty was not only important, but also the inner beauty, ‘what was essential is invisible to the eye’ and that she believed that character and personality were more important than physical beauty. Miss Croatia chose Christie Brinkley who asked her what she thought of the parade in a swimsuit and if it was something out of style, to which the Croatian girl replied that she liked it , that it was OK. Miss South Africa answered Juliet Prowse’s question regarding the important date for South Africans of April 27, 1994, and she replied that she was very hopeful for South Africa and that the reason was that both South African whites and blacks were working for unity and peace, which was the most important thing that South Africans needed at that time and that their country could always count on her. Frederick Forsyth asked Miss Venezuela the question: “When you meet someone, what human quality is the most impressive and important in a person?” She responded in English and said that sincerity and that the people should be themselves, it was very important, not trying to imitate anyone, but to be yourself anytime, anywhere. Grace Jones got Miss Jamaica and she questioned her if she ever thought that if she won the title, if she felt that another contestant deserved the title, would she give her the crown? to which she replied: “I was raised as a very humble and simple person and during the contest I have met beautiful and wonderful people and all of us are winners in some way. If by some divine intervention I manage to win the crown tonight I would say that there are other girls that I think are eligible for the title, who possess the qualities that I feel would make an excellent ambassador to the world and if another girl won, I would be very happy for her, congratulate her and help her in any way I can”. Following questions, the commentators said their goodbyes and ushered in the fifth commercial break.\n\nPierce and Doreen started the new block to talk about “Beauty with a Purpose” by introducing Julia Morley and calling South African artists to the stage for the tribute to the motto created by Julia Morley which was also joined by Lou Gossett Jr and Jacqueline Bisset who explained the work of “Operation Hunger” and the help they gave to many South African children suffering from poverty and hunger. Chrissy Caine, Vicky Sampson, Jon Cecil, Sam Marais, PJ Powers and Neil Joubert sang along with a group of children and the choir of King David High School in Linksfield the song “I Want to Live” by John Denver and finally, “Stand and Be Proud”, a song written by Sue Shifrin and David Cassidy, was the theme chosen to close this tribute with a flourish along with all the candidates in their elegant evening dresses on stage.\n\nLYRICS OF “STAND AND BE PROUD”\n\nThis is our chance\n\nNow we gotta take it\n\nWe may never get to pass this way again\n\nWe gotta be strong\n\nIf we’re gonna make it\n\nNow it’s time to dry the tears\n\nThrough the ashes hope appears\n\nAnd if we reach out for the sky\n\nWe might touch the stars\n\nStand and be proud\n\nOf who we are\n\nWe’ve come so close\n\nWe’ve come so far\n\nNow and forever\n\nOur light will shine\n\nShout it out loud\n\nStand and be proud\n\nWe have a dream\n\nNow we gotta live it\n\nIt’s gonna take some work\n\nto make this dream come true\n\nBut this is our time\n\nWe can’t waste this moment\n\nWe’re doing it with love\n\nAnd with help from God above\n\nNothing in this world can take it away\n\nStand and be proud\n\nOf who we are\n\nWe’ve come so close\n\nWe’ve come so far\n\nNow and forever\n\nOur light will shine\n\nShout it out loud\n\nStand and be proud\n\nClose your eyes and feel the pride\n\ninside your heart\n\nHowever long the road of life may be\n\nThis is the very best of you and me!\n\nStand and be proud\n\nOf who we are\n\nWe’ve come so close\n\nWe’ve come so far\n\nNow and forever\n\nOur light will shine\n\nShout it out loud\n\nStand and be proud\n\nOf who we are\n\nWe’ve come so close\n\nWe’ve come so far\n\nNow and forever\n\nOur light will shine\n\nShout it out loud\n\nStand and be proud\n\nStand and be proud!\n\nIt was time to say goodbye to Julia Kourotchkina, Miss World 1992, who was carried on a throne on the shoulders like the previous year by muscular models while she recounted her year of reign in off. Julia took the stage to await the verdict of the judges and crown her successor. After the sixth and final commercial break, Eric Morley took the stage to announce, as customary, the result in reverse order. The SECOND RUNNER-UP was Miss PHILIPPINES (Sharmaine “Ruffa” Rama Gutierrez) and the FIRST RUNNER-UP, Miss SOUTH AFRICA (Palesa Jacqueline Mofokeng). Both were crowned by Julia Morley.\n\nAnd the new Miss World 1993 was Miss JAMAICA !!!. Lisa Rene Shanti Hanna an 18-year-old teenager, whose hobbies were karate, drama and reading, who was dressed in a strapless white gown, adorned with a large necklace and half-arm gloves of the same color. She had become the third Jamaican to hold the glamorous Miss World crown after her country’s triumphs in 1963 and 1976 !!. Julia Morley gave her Miss World sash before she sat on the zebra-skin throne to be crowned by Julia Kourotchkina with the theme song “Let It Be Right In The World Tonight”. Pierce Brosnan led the brand new queen to the stalls where her red Alfa Romeo Spider convertible car was waiting for her, which was part of her awards, and mounted on the vehicle, she greeted the audience that applauded her as she toured the entire SuperBowl to conclude the two-hour broadcast.\n\nAWARDS.-\n\nAt the end of the show, the Coronation Ball was held at the Palace of the Lost City and there they announced the Continental Queens of Beauty. They were:\n\nAt the party it was also announced that Miss Croatia had been the Third Runner-up and Miss Venezuela the Fourth Runner-up. Miss World received a check for £ 10,000 and the possibility of another £ 30,000 thanks to a one-year employment contract with the Morleys. Miss South Africa won £ 2,000 for being First Runner-up and Miss Philippines £ 1,000, as did Miss Venezuela and Miss Croatia for being Continental Beauty Queens and runners-up. The remaining semi-finalists won a prize of £ 500. The contest was estimated to have been viewed by nearly 1.2 billion people in some 70 countries around the world. Proceeds from the annual event, held for the second year in Sun City, would go to charities for disabled, hungry and underprivileged children around the world. The following day, Lisa Hanna, the new Miss World, received the press in the gardens of the Lost City and celebrated her triumph with champagne, accompanied by businessman Sol Kerzner. She told the media : “This is a pleasant feeling, a happy feeling, a feeling of pride, knowing that I am from a small island and from a humble home”. “There are so many things I want to do for Jamaica”, adding that she would love to help promote her country.\n\nMISS LEBANON DID NOT WANT TO RETURN HOME.-\n\n“I will not go home in handcuffs,” the defiant Miss Lebanon told the media, adding that she may not return home if the authorities decided to take legal action against her for posing with Miss Israel the day they arrived in South Africa for Miss World. Miss Ghada Turk, 21, said: “I won’t return home”. Miss Lebanon could be tried on charges of collaborating with the enemy after posing with her Israeli counterpart, a prosecutor said on Wednesday 1st December. Munif Oueidat, Lebanon’s chief prosecutor, said investigators would question Ghada Turk about the photograph, which showed her smiling with Miss Israel, Tamara Porat, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 10.\n\nTHE REIGN OF MISS WORLD 1993.-\n\nA couple of days after her election as Miss World, Lisa Hanna traveled to London and stayed at the Morleys residence and then began her tour to Germany, Spain and Mauritius. On Thursday, December 16 at 11:15 am, she returned to Jamaica in a royal blue dress and gold accessories, accompanied by Julia Morley, where she was received with all honors at Norman Manley International Airport. Her first stop, when traveling from London, was Antigua, where she was honored. In the Jamaican airport, Burchell Whiteman (Minister of Education and Culture), Francis Tulloch (representative of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade), Chancellor Marie Atkins (Mayoress of Kingston) and Mike Henry (member of the opposition) were expecting her. There she received the keys to the city of Kingston from the Mayoress. After a press conference in the airport’s VIP Lounge, Lisa was flown by helicopter to the King House, where she met with General Governor Howard Cooke and later Prime Minister PJ Patterson at the Jamaica House. She then participated in a parade in her honor through the streets of Kingston. In the evening she attended a reception and a concert in her honor at Vale Royal invited by the Prime Minister. On Friday the 17th she visited the Maxfield Park Children’s Home and met with former Governor Florizel Glasspole before traveling to Montego Bay. There she was honored at a civic ceremony in Sam Sharpe Square, where she received the keys to the city. She was subsequently the Prime Minister’s guest of honor at the Johnnie Walker World Golf Tournament in Tryall.\n\nDuring her reign she also visited Colombia, Iceland, Israel, South Africa, Swaziland and the United States. The most memorable memories were being present at the inauguration as President of Nelson Mandela in South Africa and meeting the King of Swaziland. “Through my work, I have tried to promote mutual understanding, compassion and love for others. The satisfaction gained from trying to make a difference has given me the motivation to continue helping those less fortunate after handing over my degree”. At the end of her reign she thanked for “the love and kindness that they showed me during my travels and made my work even more enjoyable and the experience I gained contributed to my overall growth and development as a socially responsible adult. All these experiences, and the network of friends I’ve made have given me renewed emotional strength and confidence to go out into the world and take on my next challenge”. Lisa relinquished her crown to her successor in Sun City in November 1994.\n\nTHE BEAUTY QUEEN WHO WAS EXILED FOR A SMILE.-\n\nMiss Lebanon finally returned home in March 1994. Ghada Turk did not return from the Miss World pageant with a smile and a tiara, sitting in the back of a convertible and waving to a cheering crowd. She returned from a terrible exile, taken from the airport under the protection of the prime minister’s bodyguard and brought before a military judge for questioning on charges of treason. Her “crime”: collaboration with the enemy. Her feat: posing at the beauty pageant in South Africa with Miss Israel, Tamara Porat. The story of Miss Lebanon ‘s banishment for four months was an unfortunate saga full of inconsistencies. The volatile Middle East peace negotiators were moving toward a future based on trust while being dragged into a hate-filled past, and Lebanon was caught somewhere in between. Israel wanted to have open borders and start trading with Arab nations with whom in the past it only exchanged insults and bullets. For better or worse, the fate of Ghada Turk, a Christian lebanese, was tied to this world that was not really ready for peace.\n\nDespite how distant Lebanon and Israel are ideologically and politically speaking, they were geographically and alphabetically close, and that was the origin of the scandal. “All of us were taking pictures and everything we thought was to smile and look at the camera”, Turk said. “She {Porat} came and stood next to me and I only knew what happened when I looked at the newspapers the next day”. It was inevitable. In the official lineup, Israel and Lebanon, officially at war since 1948, were separated only by Italy, Turk explained in a recent interview. “I never imagined that beauty was a passport to prison,” she told the Al Hayat newspaper at the time. A week after her return to Lebanon on March 23, Turk was interrogated for two and a half hours by a military court judge. Military Attorney General Nasri Lahoud had accused her of violating Lebanon’s boycott of Israel, a crime punishable by three to 15 years in prison. The judge told her to turn the page on the incident, but to watch her movements, as she now has a court-issued residence permit. To add insult to injury, she had been told that the organizer of the contest wanted to take away her title because she did not fulfill her obligations as Miss Lebanon.\n\nThe last rays of sun touched the balcony of the house of Ghada Turk in the Christian town of Sarba. She listens the relaxing sound of the sea, but could not drown out the din of Middle East politics. “I was trying to make Lebanon proud and, in turn, they were tearing me down”, said Turk passionately, sitting on the edge of a sofa in the modest living room of their parents. The 21-year-old philosophy student was offered a job at Future TV, a private station owned by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and was worried about finishing her degree. Her final year of studies at Kaslik University was postponed due to her months of exile in London, where she was anxiously awaiting some breakthrough on her dilemma. She had a boyfriend, but her worries kept her from concentrating on him or even missing him.\n\nDo you think you did something wrong? “No, not at all,” she said defiantly, shaking her jet black hair. “I have no regrets. It was a very good experience for me”. But at the height of the Miss World controversy, Turk’s diary was filled with melancholy and bewilderment. She read aloud excerpts written after her published photo collapsed the world around her: “I was saddened by the experience when I saw that my place was not here (at an international beauty pageant in South Africa) and that Lebanon was not among these large countries because its name abroad was tinged with terror, destruction and war. They even not know where Lebanon was. A man asked: “Where is your gun?” . But I know the truth about Lebanon and its history of thousands of years”. On her last day, she wrote: “I lived 18 days in South Africa, which felt like 18 years. I cried on the last day not only because I didn’t get a ranking, but because I hated the place and didn’t know how to have fun there”.\n\nOut of fear of being arrested upon arrival in Beirut, the beauty queen sought refuge in London. She had to pay for her own plane ticket and borrow money from her maternal brother and uncle, who is a priest in charge of the Maronite Christian community in London, to pay for her stay there. The Lebanese Ministry of Tourism refused to pay the bill and the organizer of the contest, Antoine Macksoud, hiding somewhere, called her only once to ask why she was not consulting him. Turk had a large number of influential fans. Some demonstrated in South Africa, protesting the accusations made against her in Lebanon. With the help of scathing articles from London-based Al-Hayat columnist Jihad Al Khazen, who threatened if Turk suffered an even bigger scandal, she finally returned to Lebanon. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri discreetly sent a personal bodyguard to meet her at Beirut International Airport. A former member of Parliament, Edmond Edde, a Lebanese distinguished politician of seventy years of age living in Paris, ordered 40 lawyers from his own firm in Beirut to work in the case of Turk and said he was willing to go to Lebanon after almost 20 years in exile to defend her in court. To demonstrate the injustice of politics in Lebanon, Edde also announced that he would call Elie Hobeika, a former Lebanese warlord, as a witness. Hobeika was a member of parliament and a minister, although he was once a collaborator of Israel, sending his militiamen to train there. Although he now denies it, the former commander of the Lebanese Christian Forces is known to have led the 1982 Sarba and Shatilla massacre of several hundred Palestinian refugees and Lebanese slum dwellers.\n\nHowever, it was Ghada Turk who stood up to the Arab press. “It is a scandal,” criticized the pro-Syrian newspaper Al-Sharq after the famous photograph appeared. “It is anticipating normalization”, accused other newspapers. Syria declared that it was “an internal Lebanese affair”. Although resigned and perhaps hoping that an Arab-Israeli peace could undo some knots in the relationship, very few people in Lebanon were comfortable with a complete normalization of relations with Israel, a card that the Arab states really do. They didn’t want to give away before international borders forgot to draw. “They accused me of forcing normalization with Israel and dealing with the enemy,” recalls Turk, still incredulous. “It was like a thousand and one nights,” laments her mother, Dunia Turk, recalling the 140 sleepless nights during which she waited for her only daughter to return. “She is so special to us. Speak so we can hear you and walk so we can see you”, she said, quoting an old Lebanese phrase used by doting mothers. “And that would have happened all this while she was alone in a foreign country. It was like a beauty queen and had to face a war”. Dunia Turk once would have liked to compete in beauty pageants. “In my youth, my parents were too conservative,” she said , “so I cheered on Ghada. Seeing what happened, I’m glad I never entered the contest”.\n\nMiss Lebanon should have smelled trouble last September when Tourism Minister Nichola Fattoush denounced her election as illegal a week after the results. “Ghada Turk is not a beauty queen, but an impostor,” he insisted in a recent interview with The Washington Post. “She was elected despite my disapproval and it was the attorney general who accused her of great treason, not me,” he said defensively. Although previous tourism ministers had granted competition organizer Antoine Macksoud a license to host the pageant, Fattoush refused to do so. Turk and newspaper reports said he had a personal problem with Macksoud, but Fattoush claims he doesn’t even know the man. “All I heard and know about him is that he uses the choice of beauty queens as an excuse for deviant and immoral behavior and this is what prompted me to ban it and not authorize his choice,” Fattoush explained. Macksoud could not be reached for comment. “We cannot cover up an act committed in violation of the law,” he said of the photograph. “The Miss Lebanon elections were canceled by me and without a license,” the tourism minister continued. Fattoush said he had asked a Christian TV station, Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, which was formed during the war and which has not yet received the license of his own government, to organize Miss Lebanon for the next four years”. I want to have a Miss Lebanon. We still like to ogle pretty women here”, he said, comparing Lebanon to some Arab countries that would not elect beauty queens. There is no separate version of why Fattoush made such a fuss, except that “he would have liked to organize the whole thing himself”, snorted one of his many critics. Fattoush said that he was not married but was a ‘niswanji’ , which means womanizer in Arabic. “I’m single. I’m not shy around women but I have trouble communicating with them”, he added. He blurted out that he had been married twice, but then insisted it wasn’t true.\n\nIs there so little tourism in Lebanon that Tourism Minister Fattoush had nothing better to do than take on Miss Lebanon?, he criticized London columnist Abdel Wahab Badrakhan. In fact, there were no folders, papers or books inside Fattoush’s makeshift office, as the former Ministry of Tourism was being renovated. The minister refused to discuss tourism plans for Lebanon in an era of peace. “It’s an indoor kitchen,” he said, stirring an imaginary pot for added mystery. Meanwhile, luxurious hotels, restaurants, glitzy malls and theaters built by private entrepreneurs were appearing like spring flowers, bringing some shine back to a city tarnished by nearly two decades of destruction.\n\nGhada Turk arrived in South Africa on November 10, unprepared for the contest, she said, much less for what followed. She was warned by a local journalist that previous contestants from Israel had tried to “do the same trick” as 17-year-old Tamara Porat, Turk said , but organizer Macksoud “assured me that I didn’t have to worry about anything and that I would be treated like an empress”. The lineup for the fateful photograph “was a coincidence,” Turk insisted. “I was surprised and sometimes I wished I had not gone. Thereafter, put a smile to those watching, but I was crying inside”. The smile drew even more criticism. “Couldn’t you frown a bit?, Miss Lebanon looks very happy next to Miss Israel”, a magazine chided. Turk’s own lawyer in Lebanon called her in South Africa and advised her to declare that it was all an inadvertent mistake and to announce publicly that her country was still at war with Israel. She rejected his suggestion. “I refused because I had not gone there for politics, but as an ambassador of happiness and beauty”, she said. “If I had done what he said, how do you think the judges and the organizers would have reacted?”.\n\nIn a way, it echoed the words of Georgina Rizk, the Lebanese crowned Miss Universe in 1971. “We are here for the beauty, not the politics,” she said in Miami when asked how she felt about sharing the same event with Etty Orgad, then Miss Israel. Eight years later, four years after the bloody war in Lebanon, Rizk’s husband, Ali Hassan Salameh, a senior security official with the Palestine Liberation Organization, was killed along with eight other people by a car bomb placed by Israel in Beirut. Since then, the nations of the Middle East had slowly staggered towards the end of the ancient hostilities. Hajj Hassan Huballah, a member of the Hezbollah Politburo, the Shiite Muslim group most opposed to Israel and the peace process, blushed when asked about the Miss World incident and looked away in shame. “Of course it was wrong,” he said, “but others have committed far greater sins.” None, perhaps, were as photogenic as Ghada Turk. “Philosophy excluded, Ghada is beautiful,” wrote the Arabic-language daily An Nahar after her return. It is not she who betrayed Lebanon. It was Lebanon that betrayed her”…\n\nMISS PHILIPPINES AGAIN IN TROUBLE.-\n\nThe world of Philippine film soap operas plunged deeper into scandal on Tuesday, June 28, 1994 when charges were brought against the contestant from that country in Miss World 1993 and other alleged participants in a scheme to fraudulently award the two top prizes to wrong actors at the Manila Film Festival. With the country ensnared by real-life melodrama, beauty queen-turned-actress Ruffa Gutiérrez and six others were charged with fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly orchestrating a plan to identify winners in the best actor and actress categories.\n\n“In this city, crime doesn’t pay”, Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim told reporters during the arraignment at City Hall. “No one, no matter what their position in society, is above the law. They have to face the consequences of their actions”. The scandal has had all the makings of a typical Filipino film, replete with theatrics, fist fights, death threats, and personal and professional hostilities.
