Steve Bisley has been in town this weekend for Supanova Comic Con and Gaming Expo at the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre this weekend. He’s known for his roles in Mad Max and The Great Gatsby, among many Australian TV series.

Steve reveals how he regrets turning down a role in one the world’s most famous love stories and spoke about his experience on Mad Max – “I came out of drama school with Mel Gibson, we came out and went straight in to the film [Mad Max]. It probably wasn’t until we went to the premiere and I was sitting there in the front row with the other actors and being blown away by it.”
