Best known for his role in Mad Max, and later TV series including Water Rats, Steve Bisley has had a successful acting career spanning decades. He published an initial memoir in 2013 called Stillways, and has now written a follow up called "All the Burning Bridges". He chats to Wendy Harmer about being a father to six kids, the ebbs and flows of being an actor in Australia - and the time he left his mum's ashes in the glovebox of a car he sold!
