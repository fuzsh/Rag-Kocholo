Steve Bisley (born December 26, 1951) portrayed Jim Goose in George Miller's original Mad Max film.

Biography[]

Bisley was born in Lake Munmorah, New South Wales. He attended the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), graduating with a degree in Acting in 1977. He was in the same year as Mel Gibson and the pair shared a flat at one point. In Bisley's memoir [1] he describes how the principal of NIDA summoned him and Mel Gibson to his office towards the end of their time at the school. George Miller was there and was introduced to the pair. "George gives me and Mel one copy of the script each and asks us to take them away and read them to see if we have an interest in auditioning for the roles. Mel was asked to read for the character of 'Max' and I was asked to look at the role of his friend, 'Jim Goose,' the motorcycle cop. That night back at my student digs, I opened the script. This simple act would change my life forever."

Bisley continues to act to this day. Although he has appeared in some Australian films (most notably in cult 1990 teen comedy The Big Steal), he is best known as a TV actor. A stalwart of Aussie TV since the 1980s, he has clocked-up appearances on shows such as Doctor Doctor (a.k.a. The Heart Guy) Water Rats, Police Rescue, G.P., and Sea Patrol[2].

He is active on Instagram [3] and continues to attends Mad Max-related fan events.
