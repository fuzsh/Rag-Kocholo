Often appearing as a police officer on television in his native Australia, actor Steve Bisley made his big screen debut in the 1977 surfing thriller "Summer City." He had a supporting role in the film, as did a young Mel Gibson, who met Bisley while the two trained at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The next year, Bisley acted in "Newsreel," a historical drama helmed by prolific Australian filmmaker Phillip Noyce. In 1979, he reteamed with Gibson for the violent sci-fi action film "Mad Max." Bisley and Gibson played friends and fellow police officers in the film, which become internationally popular. Following the success of "Mad Max," Bisley played a gruff miner in the drama "Last of the Knucklemen" and starred in the 1980 nuclear disaster film "The Chain Reaction." Gibson had a brief role in the latter film, while "Mad Max" villain Hugh Keays-Byrne had a supporting part. Bisley worked heavily in television during the 1980s, starring as a private eye in the crime series "Call Me Mister." In the 1990s, he was a regular on the cop dramas "Police Rescue" and "Water Rats." He also starred in two "Halifax f.p." made-for-TV cop movies. Bisley had a recurring role as a Navy commander on the crime drama "Sea Patrol" in the 2000s.
