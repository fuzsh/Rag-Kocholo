        "text": "Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, a prequel to Mad Max Fury Road. Is there an end credits scene to suggest more is on the way?\n\nGenerally, the function of an end credits scene is to set up potential future installments in a movie franchise, and the Mad Max saga has no doubt developed into a bat (bleep) crazy film series since the debut of director George Miller’s first Mad Max film starring a then-relative unknown named Mel Gibson in 1979.\n\nForbesNetflix: Jennifer Lopez AI Thriller Among New Movies On Streaming Service This Week\n\nWhile there was a 40-year break between Gibson’s third film as Max Rocketansky in 1985’s Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and Tom Hardy taking over the Max role in 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, the post-apocalyptic franchise is stronger than ever.\n\nNew in theaters nationwide on Friday, Furiosa: A Mad Max saga marks for first for the franchise in that the movie doesn’t feature Max. Instead, it’s a prequel film that chronicles the harrowing plight of Imperator Furiosa (Taylor-Joy), who plays the younger version of Charlize Theron’s Furiosa from Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nNote: Spoilers from the film are discussed in the next section of the story.\n\nShould You Stick Around When The ‘Furiosa’ Credits Begin To Roll?\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max saga covers two phases of Furiosa’s life—as a child (Alyla Browne) and a young adult (Anya Taylor-Joy). The film shows how young Furiosa is stolen from her homeland known as the Green Place of Many Mothers by the warlord Dementus’ (Thor star Chris Hemsworth) menacing Biker Horde.\n\nThe bad situation becomes worse for the growing Furiosa when the Biker Horde encounters the cruel Citadel leader Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme—taking over the role from Fury Road’s Hugh Keays-Byrne, who died in 2020) while traversing across the daunting landscape known as The Wasteland. Ultimately it makes the seemingly impossible task for Furiosa to find her way home even tougher as she’s caught in between two warring factions.\n\nForbesJenna Ortega And 'Wednesday' Fans Can Soon Buy A Remote Control Thing\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga does have an end-credits scene or technically, scenes. The issue is, they are not original scenes filmed with Furiosa in mind. Instead of a new scene to bridge Furiosa to a potential future film, we skip to selected brief clips from Mad Max: Fury Road in between the main end credits where the key actors are listed.\n\nAs such, we’re getting quick clips of Charlize Theron’s Furiosa and an almost indiscernible scene of Tom Hardy as Max, as well as clips of Keays-Byrnes as Immortan Joe and Nicholas Hoult as the War Boy Nux. And yes, there’s even a shot of the Coma Doof Warrior—who plays the heavy metal guitar with a flame thrower—a character who provided one of the most entertaining appearances in Fury Road.\n\nWhile fans may be disappointed to learn that there are no original scenes included in the end credits of Furiosa, there is a brief clip—one or two seconds at most—after the credits are done rolling. It shows a shaking ornament in Furiosa’s vehicle and the meaning of it is up for interpretation. Could it signal that Furiosa rides on for more adventures?\n\nIt only makes sense considering that after a 40-year break between the original Mad Max films and the update of the series, that director George Miller will want to do more. He even hinted how there were more stories to tell during a press conference during Furiosa’s world premiere at Cannes, Deadline reported.\n\nForbesGlen Powell On How He Became 'The Blue Angels' Documentary's Wingman\n\nAfter all, Furiosa: A Mad Max saga is a prequel film, and there is plenty of time in-between the events of Furiosa and Fury Road. The key, of course, is whether Taylor-Joy wants to play Imperator Furiosa again. Or, its conceivable that Theron could come back to the role in a story following the events of Fury Road and reassume the role she originated in 2015.\n\nNo matter the case, Miller will have to get a jump on creating another Mad Max film a lot sooner than the nine years that it took between the releases of Fury Road and Furiosa.\n\nShould the venerable 79-year-old Australian filmmaker continue to direct the Mad Max saga, he will have the inspiration of other directors with filmmaking longevity to guide him. Among Miller’s contemporaries who are still making films are Martin Scorsese (81), Francis Ford Coppola (85), Ridley Scott (86) and Clint Eastwood—who turns 94 at the end of May.\n\nShowing even more mettle, prolific filmmaker Roger Corman continued to produce films until his death earlier this month at age 98 and still has a few on the way.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga, opens in theaters nationwide on Friday."
