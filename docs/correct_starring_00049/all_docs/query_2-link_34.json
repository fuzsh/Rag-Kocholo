        "text": "The trailer for Mad Max: Fury Road has hit the internet, and, there amid the post-apocalyptic desert-scape and a ferocious looking Tom Hardy as the eponymous hero, are more than a few recognisable faces.\n\nWhile Hardy's Max might take top billing, the blockbuster, which was filmed in Namibia over six months with a reported budget of $100 million, also stars a slew of famous (or soon-to-be-famous) female faces.\n\nHere are all the girls of Mad Max:\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nOscar-winning actress Charlize Theron plays the female lead Furiosa, a hero who frees captive women, has a mechanical arm, oh, and totally rocks a buzz cut.\n\nMegan Gale\n\nIf you blinked at the wrong time, you might have missed Megan Gale's appearance in the trailer. Cast as a gun-toting, unnamed character, Gale admitted via Instagram she didn't expect her scenes to make the final cut.\n\nAbbey Lee Kershaw\n\nThe Australian supermodel - she has fronted campaigns for Gucci, Chanel and Versace - makes her acting debut as The Dag. She has one of the most prominent roles in the trailer, dropping face first onto a car wearing a distinctly unglamorous set of rags. Kershaw will be appearing next in Ridley Scott's A God Of Egypt alongside Gerard Butler and Jaime Lannister, sorry, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley\n\nAbbey Lee isn't the only Victoria's Secret Model in the film. British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley also features as Splendid, a mysterious creature who heads up a trio of women called the \"Wives\". She made her film debut in the third Transformers movie, replacing Megan Fox.\n\nRiley Keough\n\nElvis's granddaughter plays Capable, one of the \"Wives\" who haunts the post-apocalyptic setting of the film. The redhead has previously been in Magic Mike and The Runaways, and was the rumoured girlfriend of Robert Pattinson post-KStew.\n\nZoe Kravitz\n\nAnother rock progeny! This time it's Lenny Kravitz's 25-year-old daughter Zoe, who has been acting for seven years with roles in X-Men: First Class and Californication. The star plays Toast, the third member of the \"Wives\"."
