        "text": "The wild man\n\n'No one, no-one, is ever indifferent to Steve Bisley'... Photo: Danielle Smith.\n\nDepending on who you talk to, Steve Bisley can be a lovable larrikin or a snarling control freak. But, love him or hate him, he's one of the best when it comes to acting.\n\nBy Sue Williams\n\nIt had been a long day on set and finally the tension exploded. Steve Bisley barked at the producer, and the producer bit back angrily. Then Bisley leapt into his old V8 Valiant, roared away backwards at 100km/h, stopped, then knocked it into gear and thundered off 500m up the road in first.\n\nThe movie producer turned to Bisley's co-star, John Jarratt. \"Why does he have to do that?\" he yelled angrily. Jarratt didn't turn a hair. \"If he didn't do that, he wouldn't be the actor he is,\" he replied. \"He'd be an accountant, and you wouldn't be getting the goods you're getting.\"\n\nFiery? Absolutely. Temperamental? Sometimes. Infuriating? Often.\n\nSome love him; some hate him. But no-one, no-one, is ever indifferent to Steve Bisley.\n\n\"He's a pig, a real control freak, who can make your life hell,\" says one director who worked with him often. \"Oh no, he's a generous, open-hearted, fun-loving wild man,\" says another director, Ross Matthews, who later became \"Bizzo's\" best mate.\n\nAnd Jarratt: \"He can be fiery but perhaps not so much now he's older. But in most ways he's hardly changed at all. He's still that strange mix of having schoolteacher parents and being a country boy, with all that country larrikin charm.\"\n\nObviously, it's all in the eye of the beholder. Today, however, there's no glimpse of any smouldering anger that, in popular myth, translates into riven intensity in front of the cameras. Today, he's just an ordinary actor, sweating over his first appearance\n\non stage in seven years, as he sits and has a beer on the veranda of the Wharf1 Theatre after another long day of rehearsals.\n\nHe's all sweetness, light and charm, those startlingly blue eyes full of warmth and interest and eagerness to please; that bulldog jaw soft with ready smiles.\n\nA starring role in a Sydney Theatre Company production, after so long away doing series TV, is a big break for Bisley, 50, and there's no way he's going to undersell that.\n\n\"I do feel panic stations, but it's great,\" he's saying. \"I've missed theatre in a way. Just having that length of time to work with other actors and spend on rehearsals.\n\n\"To have the luxury of working with a company rather than just meeting someone who's playing your wife and then going straight to a sex scene - television can't afford the budgets for taking any time.\"\n\nThe play, too, has its attractions for a man who's perhaps latterly best known for his TV gigs in shows like Water Rats, GP and Frontline. In Nick Enright's A Man With Five Children, Bisley turns the tables to play a 7 Up kind of documentary-maker who, over the years, keeps returning to follow the progress of five people whose lives he's tracking. By the end, who's being affected most by the process?\n\nDirector George Ogilvie wasn't put off by the fact Bisley hasn't done theatre for so long. On the contrary. He liked the way the actor isn't theatrical at all in the traditional sense.\n\n\"Some actors have a real theatrical flair in the theatre and Steve doesn't have that,\" says Ogilvie.\n\n\"He has, instead, an extraordinary naturalism in the way he performs. He's done a lot of TV and film, and it's imperative for actors on celluloid to make us believe they're not actors. Steve had that quality, and when he gets on stage, he still manages to maintain that persona.\n\n\"He has a really natural way about him, as well as an appealing persona to an audience. They really like him. I haven't been excited like this for a long, long time. The role is bigger than Hamlet, for God's sake.\"\n\nThat bluff, good-natured naturalness most would put down to Bisley's unpretentious start in life, at Lake Munmorah on the central coast. He did a lot of odd jobs after school, including stints as a milko and a private eye, then went off to NIDA at age 24, where he studied alongside Mel Gibson and Judy Davis.\n\nJarratt has been a close friend ever since those days, helping him to his first film break with Gibson, in the good-time surfing romp Summer City. \"He's a wonderful actor, a good jobbing actor,\" says Jarratt.\n\n\"I said to the clowns making Summer City that there were two NIDA students, mad bastards, living round the corner who were very good. They were coming up to their holidays. So they were cast.\"\n\nThen came Newsfront, The Last Of The Knucklemen (in which he had his infamous V8 spat) and then one of his finest moments, as Goose in Mad Max. Mel Gibson, of course, went on to become an A-list Hollywood star. Bisley didn't.\n\nThere's still anger about that in some quarters. \"I think [Mad Max director] George Miller was an absolute bastard to those guys,\" says Jarratt. \"They gave their blood and guts to make that movie, for nothing, and that made him who he is today. But the only one to get a gig in the second was Mel. It made Mel and left the other bastards behind.\n\n\"For my money, Steve's one of the best actors from Australia in the world. The thing is, he didn't get the luck of the draw of being cast in a big film hit. And no-one's made it in America without a successful film behind them.\"\n\nBisley agrees. \"I've never had a stand-out role,\" he says.\n\nHe insists, however, he's not bitter about losing out on the fame and fortune that have transformed the life of his former best friend. Today, he doesn't see much of Gibson - \"You get too caught up in your life and family to have much time,\" he says - and is happy doing just what he's doing.\n\n\"That's his real strength,\" says Matthews. \"He's extraordinarily down-to-earth. He's an open, warm guy, a great mate to have. It's those central coast working-class roots that have given him that.\"\n\nA couple of years ago, at the end of Water Rats, Bisley took six months out that changed his own life. For the first time he could remember, he turned down work and took a long break, sleeping in late in the morning, deciding \"to do bugger all all day if I wanted to\", and reassessing his priorities.\n\nNow, he says, he's happier than he's ever been, living with his new wife of 20 months, publicist Sally Burleigh, in a freestanding house in a quiet street in Balmain where kids play ball on the road and he can lie in bed on a Sunday morning and listen to the church bells, imagining he's in a little Italian village.\n\nBabies? He hopes so, one day, in addition to the four children, aged between 17 and 27 he has from a previous relationship. He still has his other place, too, his refuge in the Blue Mountains at Leura.\n\nProfessionally, too, he's slowed down and is quite content, trying his hand at lots of different things, including the play which opened on Wednesday (see Colin Rose's review above). In amongst those plans is a firm one to direct and write, with a project currently on the drawing board, although he won't reveal anything else about it. He's spent too much time putting it aside, using work as an excuse, he explains. This time, he's serious.\n\n\"Acting isn't the be-all and end-all of life,\" he says, lighting another cigarette. \"I do enjoy it, I thoroughly enjoy it, but I won't place more importance on it than it deserves. It's a job, no matter how you package it.\n\n\"A lot of people get hurt by it, a lot of people get corrupted, but I made decisions early on about what it meant to me, and what I'd do or not. It's a job of work, whether you're paid zillions or not much at all. There's a lot more to life than that.\"\n\nSo is there really much left of that wild man roaring away in his V8 or that leather-clad rebel racing around the mountains on a big Harley-Davidson? He smiles, with just a touch of embarrassment. And so he should. These days, he drives a soft roader, a Freelander."
