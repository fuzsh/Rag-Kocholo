        "text": "Positive Role Models\n\nvery little\n\nMax is a decent role model, if you can overlook the fact that his job requires high-speed chases, guns, and a great deal of violence. At home, he's very loving with his wife and child, and when things get tough, his first thought is to protect them. Unfortunately, without his family, he becomes just as sadistic and violent as the criminals he was pursuing. Other members of law enforcement are less admirable: For every cop who puts himself in harm's way to help someone, there's an on-duty cop spying on two people having sex. It's a bleak world, and they're portrayed as doing what they can, while they can.\n\nViolence & Scariness\n\na lot\n\nExtreme, over-the-top violence is slightly tempered by several scenes of Max's blissful home life. But the violent sequences include many explosive crashes, chases, guns, severed limbs, bloody wounds, and mangled corpses. A toddler is nearly run over by speeding cars. A man is tied to a motorcycle and dragged through town. A couple is attacked and pulled from their vehicle; rape is implied, though not shown. The woman is found by police alive but chained up and traumatized. A supporting character is burned alive inside a car -- viewers see his distress beforehand and his severely burnt hand after. A woman is stalked, threatened, and run over by motorcycles (no gore or close-up shots of body). Pet dog is killed off-screen; his mangled body is shown. In what looks like a failed attempt at a stunt, a moving motorcycle actually smacks a man in the head. Hero's violent revenge spree is portrayed as morally justified.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nParents need to know that Mad Max, the first movie in the Mad Max franchise, stars a then-unknown (Mel Gibson) as a leather-clad police officer who takes down a violent motorcycle gang in a dystopian Australia. It's a celebration and an onslaught of intense violence, including car chases, guns, and dismemberment, though not a huge amount of blood and gore. The hero, Mad Max (Gibson) is a loving husband and father, but he's outnumbered by evil, sadistic people in this more or less hopeless vision of the future. Characters are raped or burned alive, and there's a strong theme of revenge. There's brief nudity, and sexual content is implied or shown from afar. Language includes at least one use each of \"f--k\" and \"s--t,\" plus \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" and more. Some characters drink briefly and smoke in a bar. The film falls very short on diversity and has subpar, sexualized portrayals of women. It was followed by two sequels, The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and rebooted in 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road.
