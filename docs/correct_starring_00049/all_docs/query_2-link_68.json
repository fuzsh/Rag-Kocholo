        "text": "Furiosa is undoubtedly one of the greatest gifts to modern cinema and Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best movies ever made, and that's the hill we're going to die on. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron made their post-apocalyptic debut in the fourth film of George Miller's series in 2015, and since then we've been clamouring for a follow-up.\n\nFury Road came out 30 years after the previous instalments, starring Mel Gibson. Though the wait was long, it was certainly worth it. When rumblings of a prequel began, fans were a bit concerned the wait would be similarly lengthy. However, new information has been revealed about the Furiosa prequel.\n\nHere's what we know so far about the spin-off prequel which so far seems to be (imaginatively...) titled Furiosa.\n\nFuriosa release date: When is the Mad Max prequel out in cinemas?\n\nFuriosa is set for release on May 24, 2024. This, like many other movies, came after a year-long delay. However, with production already under way we can say fairly certainly that if it shifts again, it won't be a substantial one.\n\nFuriosa cast: Who will star in the Mad Max prequel?\n\nThough Tom Hardy said he was on board to return, as was Charlize Theron for her own Furiosa story, it doesn't seem like either will star in Furiosa. Instead, Anya Taylor-Joy (The Northman, Netflix's The Queen's Gambit) will star as the titular Furiosa.\n\nJoining her in as-yet undisclosed roles are Marvel's Chris Hemsworth, Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Tom Burke (Mank). While Furiosa is being billed as a spin-off, George Miller was always adamant that Fury Road was a 'reimagining' – neither a sequel nor a reboot – which has allowed for greater creativity regarding the Wasteland world he created.\n\nSpeaking of the auteur, Miller himself will co-write, direct and produce the spin-off. In addition, the Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Bevan is also returning.\n\nFuriosa plot: What will the Mad Max prequel be about?\n\nWe have received the official plot synopsis thanks to Warner Bros. It reads:\n\n\"As the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus. Sweeping through the Wasteland they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.\n\n\"While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\"\n\nSome speculate Hemsworth will take the role of Dementus, while Burke will fill the role of a younger Immortan Joe. This is total guesswork though.\n\nFuriosa trailer: When will we see Mad Max prequel footage?\n\nThere's always a chance that unofficial behind-the-scenes footage may make its way onto social media thanks to Furiosa's stars (in fact, Hemsworth himself was the one to tip everyone off when filming had begun via a post on his Instagram page). However, there is no official footage yet to be released.\n\nIf you want a journey through the wasteland, you can watch , , and on NOW TV, and Mad Max: Fury Road on ."
