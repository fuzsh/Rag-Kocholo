        "text": "George Miller may have the most fascinating filmography of any director.\n\nHis feature debut was the original “Mad Max,” which could be the most impactful first movie besides Terrance Malick’s “Badlands.” Then he doubled down the story and budget-wise with a significantly more ludicrous sequel version in “Mad Max: The Road Warrior.”\n\nHe co-directed “Twilight Zone: The Movie” with a thematic murder’s row of Joe Dante, Steven Spielberg, and Max Landis, which is an insane collection of talent to be on one flick, and went back to finish the Mad Max trilogy with arguably its strongest installment with “Mad Mad: Beyond Thunderdome.”\n\nHe dropped a couple of movies, including “The Witches of Eastwick” and “Lorenzo’s Oil,” that have been forgotten to history and, out of nowhere, became a children movie’s maker with “Babe: Pig in the City” in 1998. He waited eight years to reinvent himself once more as an animation director with the massively successful “Happy Feet” and then did it again with “Happy Feet Two.”\n\nHe would return to his career-defining Mad Max franchise in 2015, where he turned a sequel into what I believe to be the greatest action film of all time and a top-10 movie ever made full-stop in “Mad Max: Fury Road.”\n\nHe dropped a quickie one-for-me film in “Three Thousand Years of Longing” and finally now the awe-inspiring Fury Road prequel “Furiosa”.\n\nPhew! It’s a career drowning in critical acclaim, until recently box office validation, and a constant shucking of conventional norms. It’s prudent to take the time to acknowledge Miller; this might be it for him and his life’s work.\n\nMiller is 79 now — how long can this dude take on the massive ordeal of crafting any feature film let alone the burdensome Mad Max movies? Moreover, now that “Fury Road” barely got into the box office black and “Furiosa” ended up deep, deep in the red despite receiving a valuable Memorial Day weekend open, we may never get another George Miller movie, we may never get another Mad Max movie.\n\nA heart-aching shame, considering Mad Max has been the most influential, thorough, beloved world in the history of filmmaking. It has fueled a steampunk resurgence, spawned copycat wannabe movies, and a roleplaying fanbase niche culture that hosts the festival “Wasteland Weekend” with real War Boys undergoing entire initiation processing.\n\n“Furiosa” continues the tradition of excellence.\n\nChris Hemsworth’s performance as cult chief Dementus is the highlight, one so well executed that I honestly and earnestly believe he deserves Best Actor consideration when we hand out awards at the end of the year. His voice contains layers, being able to double as both charming and skeevy in all his lines. An underlying danger breathes life into the text, so much so that it induces chilling shudders. Hemsworth also makes Dementus hilarious, surprising the audience into hysterics with character choices that leave every element of storytelling touched upon.\n\nHe eventually comes to embody the theme of the populist who is unable to govern. As his faction splinters and his populace riots, he has to find a way to shift blame. So, what does the myopic conqueror do when exposed as a poor leader? He finds something else to conquer. But, we as the third-person audience see the realities of this type of dictatorship.\n\nOnce again we see stunts and concepts that are wholly unique and unbelievably inventive in both concept and scope. New ideas, far outside the box of what was previously seen as conceivable, are executed with proficiency. Captured in a single shot showing the fluidity in their moments, they are used as a way to further hollow out the world, exemplifying a lived-in universe where humans have turned into maniacs who are not only willing to risk everything for survival, but who do it regularly enough that they have gathered experience in hopping off the back of a motorcycle, skating across the sand, and parachuting upwards in pursuit of resources.\n\n“Furiosa” creates a fresh perspective on this forty-five-year-old universe. Miller skewers expectations by continuing to take new risks: The risk of casting child actors in such harsh environments but still getting them to perform, the risk of focusing on minor characters in such ways that they feel majorly important, and the risk of framing without intimacy to make the audience as cold as the wasteland.\n\nMany directors understand, but it seems that only George Miller can tap into the fact that, deep down, we all want to die gloriously bathed in chrome.\n\nCritic Score: 9.1/10\n\nJack Simon is a mogul coach and writer/director who enjoys eating food he can’t afford, traveling to places out of his budget, and creating art about skiing, eating, and traveling while broke.
