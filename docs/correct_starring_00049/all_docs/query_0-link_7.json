        "text": "Often appearing as a police officer on television in his native Australia, actor Steve Bisley made his big screen debut in the 1977 surfing thriller \"Summer City.\" He had a supporting role in the film, as did a young Mel Gibson, who met Bisley while the two trained at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The next year, Bisley acted in \"Newsreel,\" a historical drama helmed by prolific Australian filmmaker Phillip Noyce. In 1979, he reteamed with Gibson for the violent sci-fi action film \"Mad Max.\" Bisley and Gibson played friends and fellow police officers in the film, which become internationally popular. Following the success of \"Mad Max,\" Bisley played a gruff miner in the drama \"Last of the Knucklemen\" and starred in the 1980 nuclear disaster film \"The Chain Reaction.\" Gibson had a brief role in the latter film, while \"Mad Max\" villain Hugh Keays-Byrne had a supporting part. Bisley worked heavily in television during the 1980s, starring as a private eye in the crime series \"Call Me Mister.\" In the 1990s, he was a regular on the cop dramas \"Police Rescue\" and \"Water Rats.\" He also starred in two \"Halifax f.p.\" made-for-TV cop movies. Bisley had a recurring role as a Navy commander on the crime drama \"Sea Patrol\" in the 2000s."
