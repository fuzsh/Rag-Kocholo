This guy comes burstin' in here in the middle of the night from the middle of nowhere lookin like a... a front row forward spat out of a grand final scrum - and he won't tell us the score - and you tell me to settle down?!?\"\n\nMini Collab with Adam \"Mr T\" Trainer\n\nSteve Bisley: business up front, party at the back! Never knew how much I needed this stalwart of Aussie television to play a macho action hero lead until I saw it.\n\nThe Australian government is being shady and is up to no good, probably at the behest of their bad-influence best mates, the US government. They're dumping nuclear waste in the otherwise bucolic Southern…\n\nIan Barry’s debut feature film sits on the margins of Ozploitation but seems to have had higher aims, drawing inspiration from James Bridges’ The China Syndrome (1979) and George Miller’s Mad Max (1979), with which it shared several cast and crew members. Barry would go on to build a solid directing career, most of it on TV series.\n\nIn the late ‘70s, Barry was trying to raise finance for “The Sparks Obituary”, a feature film he had written. He was struggling, and producer David Elfick suggested that he shoot a short film to show potential funders. That 30 minute short film, also titled The Sparks Obituary (1978), is included as an extra on the Umbrella Entertainment DVD of The Chain Reaction. Elfick…\n\nMy referencing several people from Max Max recently inspired me to finally track down this Ozploitation picture (nevermind how) which I have been familiar with for a few years via messageboard discussion, as it has more Mad Max ties than you'd expect. It also gives me a chance to plug an awesome score that the synthwave fans will love.\n\nIt has an interesting plot: an earthquake happens at a nuclear power plant that appears to be many kilometers away from civilization aside from dingoes and kangaroos. A leak happens and a scientist gets a fatal dose attempting to fix the problem. He escapes as his superiors want to cover it up... despite the fact that it has leaked to the…\n\nMini-collab with Rob\n\nBetween 1952 and 1957 the British undertook nuclear testing in three remote parts of Australia. The indigenous community of one site, Maralinga claimed to have been poisoned by the testing, and received millions in compensation in 1994. As of a couple of years ago there was still evidence of contamination, and this is arguably why nuclear power has never been particularly popular here. We're suspicious of governments who propose it, and our disdain for our colonial oppressors' efforts to foist the nuclear age upon us still resonate. Perfect contextual fodder for a bit of paranoid and pithy Ozploitation then.\n\nPoor old Steve Bisley from Channel 9's Water Rats. He just wants to get his missus down the…\n\nLast month I watched the mediocre Keanu movie Chain Reaction from 1996, and was reminded that I have a copy of this Ozploitation film with the same name. This was one I always had on my mind because George Miller directed the car chases, and I was interested as to how they compared to the chases in Miller's Mad Max films.\n\nHeinrich(Ross Thompson), an employee in an Australian nuclear plant gets sprayed with radiation during a sudden earthquake, and escapes an conspiracy to cover up the incident. Heinrich is able to inform a friend about radioactive contamination of the nearby water supply, and stumbles into the cabin of a newly-wed mechanic and nurse(Steve Bisley and Arna-Maria Winchester) on holiday in…\n\nThe Chain Reaction is a typically mad and occasionally incoherent bit of Ozploitation whose ambition is overshadowed by its terrible attention span.\n\nIt's difficult to come away from it remembering anything but the two terrific and terrifyingly dangerous-looking car chases. If this period of Aussie cinema was good at anything, it was car stuff. They just didn't give a shit, maybe because they didn't have the budgets to give a shit. There's a reason one of them is on the poster though.\n\nIt would be slightly unfair to some of the rest of it though. Steve Bisley is typically wise-arsed and strong in the lead and Hugh Keays-Byrne is sinister as ever. It does have a plot but maybe too…"
