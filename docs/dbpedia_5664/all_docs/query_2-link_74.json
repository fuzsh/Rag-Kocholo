        "text": "Dylan Jacob Martin, age 22, passed away June 28, 2024 after complications from a radioactive spider bite that led to years of crime-fighting and a lifelong battle with the notorious criminal known as congestive heart failure.\n\nOur superhero Dylan, graduated from Pickerington North High School in 2021. He was an avid lover of Marvel/DC, Anime, Sci-fi, and Science and in the midst of writing his first book. Dylan had a deep love for his family and cherished time together. Especially if it involved food. We will always remember his infectious smile, loving embrace and caring personality. Dylan is no longer in pain, but our lives are forever changed. We will continue to get together and laugh for Dylan’s sake, that is how he wanted it.\n\nDylan is survived by his mother, Jennifer Martin. Maternal grandparents, Ralph Thurner and Susan Sandefur. Father, James Martin, Siblings, Austin (Sarah) Sandefur, Luke (Rachel) Martin, Bradley Martin, Mason Smith, Tristan Smith, Brooklyn Smith, his bonus father Jason Smith, Niece, Layla Sandefur, and many aunts, uncles, cousins and friends. Last but not least, his sidekicks Luna and Peanut.\n\nDylan was preceded in death by his Paternal grandparents, Butch and Raeleen Martin.\n\nThe family extends their heartfelt thanks to the health-care professionals for their care and commitment to Dylan over the last 22 years. Without you, those precious 22 years wouldn’t have existed."
