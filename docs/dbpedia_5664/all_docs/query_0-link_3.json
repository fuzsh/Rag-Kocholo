        "text": "NARRATOR: Tonight on FRONTLINE, a dangerous place, a critical time-- U.S. MILITARY OFFICER: This ethnic fault line is really going to start to erupt.\n\nNARRATOR: --a desperate and divided country.\n\nIraqi Businessman: If the Americans were to pull out, everybody'd be fighting everybody else.\n\nIt'd be Sunni against the Shi'ite, the Muslims against the Christians.\n\nIt's going to be a catastrophe.\n\nNARRATOR: Tonight, FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith crosses Iraq.\n\nThe people have survived Saddam, he finds.\n\nBut can they survive themselves?\n\na lousy job of covering the story here.\n\nHe said we needed to get out of Baghdad.\n\nNow it's mid-November, and we've come back to see how the U.S. plan to turn this country into a showcase for democracy in the Middle East is faring.\n\nToday I'm in the northern city of Mosul with General David Petraeus.\n\nHe's having the kind of success here that Washington had hoped for.\n\nThis was our first stop on a five-week trip across Iraq.\n\nWe're attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new free trade zone.\n\nMASTER OF CEREMONIES: We welcome all our guests in the new free zone area and-- MARTIN SMITH: Getting business rolling in the midst of constant security threats is no easy matter.\n\nBut with a combination of money well spent, tough military tactics and what Petraeus will admit is some luck, the general has made steady progress.\n\nWe've come here to get some sense of how much work there is still to do and how long soldiers like Petraeus will need to be here.\n\nPetraeus and around 18,000 soldiers moved into northwestern Iraq in late April and set up headquarters in Mosul, an ancient city on the western edge of Kurdistan.\n\nPetraeus told me the landscape here reminds him of Kansas.\n\nUnder names like Task Force Johnny Appleseed, Tom Sawyer, Easy Rider and Marcus Welby, Petraeus has launched 4,500 reconstruction projects, making Mosul a showcase for visiting congressmen.\n\nEven before Ambassador Paul Bremer set up shop in Baghdad, Petraeus held Iraq's first post-war election.\n\nI followed Petraeus to one city council meeting.\n\nCOUNCILMAN: In general, about the searching of mosques-- MARTIN SMITH: They were discussing what right the newly trained Iraqi police had to search mosques for weapons.\n\nCOUNCILMAN: They came into the mosque wearing their shoes, and they were smoking cigarettes, openly breaking the rules of Ramadan, contrary to Islam.\n\nMaj. Gen. DAVID PETRAEUS, 101st Airborne Division: If the mosques do not want somebody to go into them, then they should not store mortar baseplates, mortar-aiming circles and mortar-firing triggers in their mosques.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, we will certainly discuss this with the Iraq civil defense corps-- MARTIN SMITH: This council has met over 50 times and approved thousands of projects.\n\nThe plan is that by June, Iraqis will run it by themselves.\n\nMaj. Gen. DAVID PETRAEUS: In the past two weeks alone, over 670 RPG rounds and 333 RPG launchers were turned over to us by local citizens.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Meanwhile, security remains the biggest concern.\n\nWe drove out to the 101st's ammo dump.\n\nSo they're bringing us out to a base here, where they're collecting all this ammunition that-- every day, they get several truckloads of rockets, SAMs, grenades, explosive material, and they bring it in here to this old base, Iraqi base, and then they blow it up.\n\nIn fact, there is so much ammunition that it is piling up faster than the 101st can dispose of it.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Now, some of the IEDs, the improvised explosive devices, are made out of these very things, right?\n\nSOLDIER: Roger, sir.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: So you find these things being put into a road in attempts to kill you guys.\n\nSOLDIER: Roger.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: The problem for Petraeus now is that his very success has made him and the 101st an attractive target.\n\nMaj. Gen. DAVID PETRAEUS: About a month or so ago, we saw a sustained spike of enemy activity.\n\nWe've lost a number of soldiers during that time, had a number of others wounded.\n\nIf the enemy sees this as an example of success, then, of course, they're going to want to take it on.\n\nAnd they are.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: At the end of our first day, Petraeus joined his general staff for his nightly briefing.\n\nOFFICER: --were trying to gain entry through a non-border crossing location, sir.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: It was a PowerPoint extravaganza.\n\nHundreds of reconstruction projects were reviewed.\n\nMaj. Gen. DAVID PETRAEUS: OK, next slide.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: The 101st, I thought, runs a very tight ship.\n\nMaj. Gen. DAVID PETRAEUS: You betcha.\n\nOK, next slide.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: But then came the day's bad news.\n\nBBC RADIO: Two helicopters from the 101st Airborne Division were flying over a suburban area of Mosul shortly after nightfall when the crash happened.\n\nEyewitness accounts speak of some kind of missile striking one of the Black Hawks, which then collided with the second two Black Hawks down, and the worst single loss of life for the American military since the start of the war.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Seventeen soldiers were dead.\n\nA visit of U.S. congressmen scheduled for the following day was canceled.\n\nUntil recently, Mosul had not seen much violence, compared to Baghdad.\n\nAnd it has still not experienced much in the way of ethnic tension, though the city contains a volatile mix of Kurds, Arabs and Assyrians.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: General Petraeus told us that if we wanted to understand ethnic tensions in Iraq, we should drive to Kirkuk.\n\nTraditionally a city of Kurds and Turkomen, on the southwestern edge of Kurdistan, Kirkuk fell prey to Saddam's brutal Arabization program in the 1980s.\n\nToday the city is claimed equally by Arabs, Turkomen and Kurds, and the job of sorting out those claims has fallen largely to the U.S. Army.\n\nWe linked up with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, commanded by Colonel Bill Mayville.\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE, 173rd Airborne Brigade: This is a place that could unravel Iraq.\n\nThis is a place that could begin a spiral, a downward spiral.\n\nCivil unrest is right here.\n\nIt's at the surface.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Several times in the last few months, Kurds and Arabs have clashed in the streets.\n\nIn August, Turkomen also rioted.\n\nTurkomen and Arabs both fear that their city is being sold out from underneath them to the Kurds.\n\nHow well does Washington, or even Baghdad, understand what you're facing here in Kirkuk?\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE: First off, let me say no one can-- no one can possibly hope to appreciate the complexity of Kirkuk until you've been here and you've spent as much time as we have had the privilege of spending here.\n\nMy concern, at this point, is that one community sees itself being outmaneuvered by the other, takes steps to make sure it's not outmaneuvered.\n\nAnd then we create this momentum that consumes that city at a rate and a pace that upsets the other community.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: While we were in Kirkuk, we ran into a demonstration of Shia Arabs.\n\nThese people were angry about the make-up of the city council and the Kirkuk police force.\n\nBoth were dominated by Kurds.\n\nWe followed the demonstration to this mosque and spoke to the chief imam, Abdul Fattah al Musawi.\n\nABDUL FATTAH AL MUSAWI: This demonstration is to tell the world that the provisional government in Kirkuk is illegitimate.\n\nEveryone here is opposed to the current government, opposed to its governors, to its councils, everything.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Musawi has signed a petition demanding the city council be dissolved and seats reapportioned to reflect the fact that Arabs now make up a large proportion of the city.\n\nThey live mostly in housing projects on the south side of town.\n\nThe Kurds call them \"10,000 dinar Arabs,\" a reference to the incentive money they received from Saddam to relocate from the south.\n\nMost of them have been here for more than a decade.\n\n1st ARAB: I live in Kirkuk because it's a beautiful area and it has nice people.\n\nThe location and the climate are better than in Basra.\n\nMy father didn't have enough money to buy a home in Basra, so we came here.\n\nThey gave us an apartment and money.\n\nTRANSLATOR: The government, Saddam's government, gave us money and houses.\n\nThat's why we came here.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: What's your opinion about the fact that the Kurds, some of them, believe that this should be a Kurdish city and that you, many of you, should go back to the south of Iraq?\n\n2nd ARAB: We're all Arabs here, and we won't leave this area.\n\nSome Kurds live in Baghdad.\n\nShould we ask them to move?\n\nThere is only one Iraq.\n\nIf they want to divide Iraq, it will only create problems!\n\nTRANSLATOR: One Iraq, all the same.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Under Saddam's Arabization policy, close to a million Kurds were forced out of their homes.\n\nNow they've been coming back to cities like Kirkuk and settling in refugee camps on the city's east side.\n\nWhat motivates you to come back here?\n\n1st KURD: Because we are from Kirkuk.\n\nAnd now that it is liberated, we feel that we don't belong anywhere else.\n\nIt is our homeland.\n\nWe belong here.\n\nWe dream of Kirkuk in our sleep.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: But is this-- is this for you a better life here now?\n\n2nd KURD: Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: But you live here in tents, in what is essentially a refugee camp.\n\n2nd KURD: Yes, but we prefer to die here than live somewhere else.\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE: The Kurds believe that the war really was about their repatriation to lands that they had lost during the Arabization process of Saddam Hussein.\n\nThey believe that we will underwrite their return to this province.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: We followed Mayville to a meeting with Kurdish leaders.\n\nKURDISH LEADER: We hope you will cooperate with us in defining Kirkuk as part of Kurdistan.\n\nWe believe this is our legitimate right.\n\nWe've never said Arabs, Turkomen and Assyrians can't be in Kirkuk.\n\nThe only problem is those Arabs who, through the Arabization program, settled in Kirkuk.\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE: If they want to leave, fine.\n\nBut if we're not-- you know, if what we're doing is forcing them to leave, don't we look a lot like the regime we've just overthrown?\n\nKURDISH LEADER: Those Arabs came here to change our demographics.\n\nThey came as a tool of ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe Kurds are the owners.\n\nThe others are occupiers.\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE: If you don't recognize that the Shia, the Kurds, Turkomen and the Arabs are all victims, then you are going to be fighting one fight after another.\n\nYour children will be fighting.\n\nAnd you will see the same cycle of fighting that this land has always known because you are going down a road-- you're going down a road with this ultimatum that will be your undoing.\n\nI am really worried about what happens here.\n\nAnd to be fair to the communities that are here, I don't think they have the capacity to solve this problem themselves.\n\nThey do need outside help.\n\nWe don't even have the rules of law yet to arbitrate, mediate or even discuss compensation packages.\n\nAnd we don't-- we just-- what we have is historical forces at play here.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: This month, Colonel Mayville and his unit will rotate out of Iraq.\n\nThe work he started here will fall to another coalition commander.\n\nThat night, our hotel in Kirkuk was attacked.\n\nSomebody apparently drove by and threw a grenade right in the front of our hotel.\n\nWe were just upstairs.\n\nHe threw a grenade, right?\n\nThree members of the hotel staff were wounded by glass and shrapnel.\n\nThe staff assumed it was Ba'ath loyalists targeting a hotel that catered to Westerners.\n\nWhen police arrived, hotel security accused them of failing to adequately patrol the neighborhood.\n\nThe police tried to prevent us from filming.\n\nThen a fight broke out.\n\nWhen we kept filming, one policeman fired three rounds at the windows directly above our heads to push us back.\n\nThe other part of Colonel Mayville's job is running military operations against the resistance.\n\nOn this night, Mayville had received intelligence that a Ba'athist cell was operating from a town 40 miles south of Kirkuk.\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE: It is an area where there are constant attacks against the coalition forces-- mortar rounds, IEDs, the improvised explosive devices that hit our vehicles.\n\nWhat we're doing is coming in with a large force to let everybody know, one, to the bad guys, we're going to find you, because we're going to get a bunch of them tonight.\n\nAnd I think that you're going to see this kind of an operation going on throughout Iraq, back and forth, until finally everyone gets to realize that there's a new order in place.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: We arrived in the town, Hawijah, at dawn.\n\nDowntown, we saw many posters of Saddam and a partially restored mural.\n\nSOLDIER: Back up and pump the gas.\n\nHell, yeah!\n\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: One thousand soldiers spread out across town with instructions to move cautiously.\n\nColonel Mayville said the objective was to capture enemies, not create them.\n\nA tip brought them to this house, where they found eight tubes of C4 explosives, dozens of blasting caps-- SOLDIER: Battery and a switch.\n\nThat's all you need.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: --several AK-47s and a banner proclaiming loyalty to Saddam.\n\nSOLDIER: It says that, \"All the people are with you and we will defend you with everything we've got.\n\nWe are ready to defend the great Iraq.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH: The homeowners said the explosives, guns and banner belonged to their son.\n\nSOLDIER: This is getting extremely serious because if he's harboring terro MARTIN SMITH: But they wouldn't talk until soldiers brought in a bulldozer and began to destroy the house.\n\nThe mother then said her son was plowing a nearby field.\n\nHe was arrested that day, along with 25 other men.\n\nCol. WILLIAM MAYVILLE: A really good job on your part, your soldiers' part, and in terms of precision-- I'm realistic about success.\n\nI think we Americans want very much to earn the respect, to earn a partnership here and a friendship.\n\nI think there's enough of an idealist in me that I would hope that we could do something like that.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: After Kirkuk, we pushed south deeper into the Sunni Arab lands of central Iraq.\n\nThe roads between here and Baghdad are notoriously unsafe.\n\nA civilian contractor had disappeared on this stretch a few weeks earlier.\n\nOur driver told us there would be no stopping for filming.\n\nAmbushes are commonplace.\n\nThis is the so-called Sunni triangle.\n\nSunni Arabs have long dominated Iraqi politics, but now they have been stripped of their power.\n\nAnd being only one fifth of the overall population of Iraq, they worry about how they will fare in a democracy, nowhere more than in Tikrit, birthplace of Saddam.\n\nThis is not a place that welcomes outsiders.\n\nEven filming is difficult.\n\nWe've been warned to watch our backs.\n\nAt a downtown restaurant where I had lunch, Saddam's picture hung on the wall.\n\nAnd that very day, two coalition contractors were murdered a few blocks away.\n\nNearby is Saddam's water palace.\n\nWe've come to ask the commander of the 4th Infantry Division, now headquartered here, about the prospect of winning the loyalty of the people in the Sunni triangle.\n\nMaj. Gen. RAYMOND ODIERNO, 4th Infantry Division: Some of the problem is they expect the United States to come in and they would throw billions of dollars, and in six months, this country would be like Germany is today.\n\nYou know, it's an unrealistic expectation.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: We had come here at a critical time.\n\nIt has not been widely reported, but in October, reconstruction money, so important to winning hearts and minds, dried up.\n\nMaj. Gen. RAYMOND ODIERNO: We were just beginning to see people reacting to the successes we were having with the water treatment projects, with the school projects, with the sewage projects, with the police buildings and the courthouses being developed.\n\nWe were really starting to see some positive response to all that.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: You had momentum.\n\nMaj. Gen. RAYMOND ODIERNO: We had momentum.\n\nAnd so we've somewhat lost that a little bit.\n\nWe can regain it, but it's frustrating.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Why did nobody see that coming?\n\nMaj. Gen. RAYMOND ODIERNO: We didn't see it coming.\n\nI can't tell you why it happened.\n\nI don't know.\n\nSo we just got to-- it's done.\n\nIt's water under the bridge.\n\nWe got to move forward.\n\nI think that's my comment on that.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: It appeared to have serious consequences.\n\nAs reconstruction slowed, anti-coalition violence increased.\n\nNovember, the month we were in Iraq, turned out to be the most deadly since the war was declared over in May.\n\nThis is Baqubah, 75 miles south of Tikrit, another hard-hit town.\n\nI went to talk to the local U.S. commander.\n\nHi there.\n\nLt. SUSAN GREIG, 4th Infantry Division: Hello.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Hi.\n\nMartin Smith.\n\nHow are you?\n\nLt. SUSAN GREIG: Hi.\n\nLieutenant Greig.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Lieutenant Susan Greig says she ran out of money while trying to set up a police force.\n\nLt. SUSAN GREIG: What happened was, initially when we arrived here, I mean, we used coalition money.\n\nAnd then, you know, at some point, you know, that ran down.\n\nAnd honestly, for a few months, I mean, we were really at a standstill.\n\nI couldn't get weapons.\n\nI couldn't get uniforms, patrol cars.\n\nI have a couple police stations that only had one patrol car.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: To make matters worse, Baqubah is among the most dangerous police posts in all of Iraq.\n\nTwo days before we got here, suicide bombers struck two local police stations.\n\nEleven policemen and five civilians were killed.\n\nMany more were injured.\n\nWe talked to one of the victims at his home.\n\nINJURED MAN: We were standing by the door of the police station.\n\nThen, in a split second, the car exploded.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: And how badly injured were you?\n\nFATHER: On top of it all, no one took him to the hospital.\n\nAnd he hasn't been paid.\n\nTRANSLATOR: How long?\n\nFATHER: Two months without pay.\n\nNot a single dinar.\n\nThey say it hasn't been approved.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Will you return to being a policeman after you are healed?\n\nINJURED MAN: Yes, I will.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: He may return, but many others haven't.\n\nImmediately after the bombing, around 40 police officers in Baqubah province resigned.\n\nGreig told us that in early December, she'd been assured that money was on its way.\n\nBut she says she lost valuable time.\n\nLt. SUSAN GREIG: We cannot really work on public works if we don't have the security to protect the workers that are there.\n\nWe can ask all the contractors in the world to come out and build a sewage line and everything else, but you know what?\n\nSomeone can come right behind him, throw a couple RPGs at it, and what do you have?\n\nWe need the security first, in order to allow these civilian contractors to get out to do their job.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: It's a stubborn problem.\n\nThe more active the resistance, the slower the reconstruction.\n\nThere are security problems throughout the Sunni Triangle.\n\nThe worst are in Falluja.\n\nLess than an hour west of Baghdad, it is the epicenter of the resistance.\n\nOn the way there, we saw two U.S. Army supply trucks that had just been attacked.\n\nAs we entered the town, there was anti-American graffiti everywhere.\n\n\"Long live Saddam.\n\nDeath to American spies and cooperators.\"\n\n\"Falluja will be a graveyard for the Americans.\"\n\n\"It is lawful to steal from the Americans, even to kill thRTIN SMITH: More than 40 American GIs have been killed in this area since April.\n\n1st IRAQI: Americans came here for the oil.\n\nThe American government lied to its people and the entire world with its claims about weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhere are the weapons?\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Throughout central Iraq, it's easy to find people that complain on the streets, but the people of Falluja were especially blunt.\n\n2nd IRAQI: None of us have seen any good from the Americans.\n\nI will tell you, on television, I am ready to take on the Americans!\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Even the mayor, who says he is pro-American, is critical.\n\nMAYOR: Most of the Americans have a military mindset.\n\nThey don't bother to know or learn about our culture or customs.\n\nThey have a misinterpretation of Iraqis.\n\nWhen somebody kicks down a door to search a house, does he expect to be loved?\n\nMARTIN SMITH: There's been tension in Falluja since the end of the war.\n\nOn several occasions, American troops have mistakenly shot and killed civilians and Iraqi policemen.\n\nThe people have not forgotten, and soldiers remain tense.\n\nJust a few days before we got here, a warehouse had been raided by soldiers looking for explosives.\n\nIRAQI: There were more than 50 soldiers.\n\nhey took our weapons and held us against the wall with their guns.\n\nThey broke the locks.\n\nThey just kicked the doors in and smashed the glass.\n\nTRANSLATOR: Yeah, they kicked the doors open and they smashed-- MARTIN SMITH: As I was listening to the guard, I heard gunshots.\n\nIt was a wedding party.\n\nWe asked to go inside the warehouse and talk with the owner.\n\nSHEIKH GAZI AL ESSAWI: Somebody told them I supported the resistance, that I had weapons, invited Saddam to my house, et cetera.\n\nThey believed those false informers and confronted me.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: He is Sheikh Gazi al Essawi, the leader of the Bu Essa tribe, one of the largest and most powerful in the country.\n\nSHEIKH GAZI AL ESSAWI: Why did they do this to me?\n\nI'm not upset that they searched my house or my company.\n\nWhat upsets me is that they vandalized my company.\n\nDo the Americans want to turn me into a friend or an enemy?\n\nFalluja is a tribal society.\n\nThe way things work here, if one man slaps another, it's a big deal.\n\nIt could lead to a bigger confrontation.\n\nIt could lead to killing.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: When we asked the Americans about the raid, they admitted that they might have overreacted and are investigating the incident.\n\nWe spoke to the local U.S. Army commander, Lt.\n\nColonel Brian Drinkwine.\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE, 82nd Airborne Division: Sheikh Gazi is rumored to be one of the third or fourth richest sheikhs in Iraq.\n\nHe's a man of great political influence.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: But you were suspicious of Gazi.\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: No, I would not say we're suspicious of any one sheikh, in particular.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: One of your captains says, \"I don't like him because he wants to kill me.\"\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: Well, we've had a few threats from different people.\n\nI don't think that-- you know, Sheikh Gazi is in a position that he can be a future leader of this city in Iraq.\n\nIt should not only be the coalition and CPA providing resources to Falluja.\n\nThere are Iraqis with money that can do great good for this city.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: But he wants U.S. coalition forces out.\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: Yeah.\n\nSome sheikhs will say that, but to a man, they will tell you if we did leave and pick up and stack arms and go tomorrow, there will be a tribal war with more bloodshed than this place has ever seen.\n\nYou have to develop a representative government that can stand on its own.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: How long is it going to take?\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: I don't want to put a timetable to it.\n\nI think it's the conditions that you look for.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: When are Iraqis on the streets of Falluja going to tell me that things are better?\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: Hopefully, tomorrow they'll tell you it's a little better.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: The people that I've spoken to in the streets, they like to gesture up and down the main boulevard there and say, \"Look, where do you see any improvements?\n\nWhere is it?\"\n\nThey don't-- they don't see it.\n\nAnd frankly, it's not-- it doesn't jump out at you when you drive through Falluja that there's a lot of reconstruction going on.\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: It's-- it will take time.\n\nSOLDIER: I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: We were interrupted.\n\nA helicopter had been shot down.\n\nSOLDIER: They say they took small arms fire and they say there's two guys maneuvering on them now, so-- Lt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: OK. Let me stop-- MARTIN SMITH: Has there been an ambush?\n\nLt. Col. BRIAN DRINKWINE: It's an incident with another unit.\n\nThere's a-- so if you could give me a minute, we could stop rolling, I be right back.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Yeah.\n\nOf course.\n\nI understand.\n\nOf the 10 American helicopters shot down over Iraq, 4 came down near Falluja.\n\nThis time, the Americans were lucky.\n\nThere were no serious injuries.\n\nBefore we headed south, [our driver] told me we needed to fill our gas tank.\n\nEverywhere we went there were lines.\n\nMany of them of went on and on and on.\n\nThere was a shortage of gasoline in Iraq due to decayed pipelines and frequent attacks on oil industry infrastructure.\n\nThe people on this line have been here for much of the night and all morning.\n\nWe've been told that on average, the wait is about six hours.\n\nOur trip would have been impossible if we hadn't found an alternative source on the black market.\n\nThis enterprising seller buys it from the gas station and sells it to us at six times the market price.\n\nIn a country where unemployment ranges as high as 70 percent, few Iraqis can afford the mark-up.\n\nOn a full tank, we resumed our trip south.\n\nWe would have met with U.S. military commanders in the south, but there are none.\n\nInstead Italians, Poles, British troops and others patrol here.\n\nThe south is home to the Shia, traditionally the poorest, most oppressed and marginalized of Iraq's people.\n\nToday the Shia are experiencing a revival.\n\nShia pilgrims from Iran and elsewhere -- long prevented from coming here by Saddam -- are flooding in, to the sacred cities of Najaf, Karbala and Kufa.\n\nCommerce is booming, and contributions to the local mosques are filling their coffers, making the clerics who control them rich and powerful.\n\nThe Shia also know that they have a lot to gain in a democracy.\n\nBy some counts, they represent 60 percent of Iraq's population.\n\nThe preeminent Shia leader in Iraq, whose followers number in the millions, is the Grand Ayatollah Ali Huseini al Sistani.\n\nSistani has challenged Ambassador Bremer's complex formula for the selection of a national assembly, calling instead for direct popular elections.\n\nI just want to ask him some questions.\n\nYou translate for me, OK?\n\nWe tried to talk to him on an earlier trip to Najaf in August.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Who can we ask?\n\nWho's the secretary?\n\nIs this where Sistani works?\n\nTRANSLATOR: Yeah, he works [unintelligible] MARTIN SMITH: His spokesman refused to appear on camera.\n\nWe hope to be able to speak to Ayatollah Sistani SPOKESPERSON: The ayatollah doesn't receive anybody from any television channel or any press.\n\nHe only accepts written questions.\n\nThat is his way.\n\nPaul Bremer asked to meet with him.\n\nThe assistant to Rumsfeld [Wolfowitz] asked to meet with him.\n\nHe does not talk to Americans.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Another of Iraq's five living grand ayatollahs, Muhammad al Modarresi, is much more approachable.\n\nLike Sistani, he is considered a moderate.\n\nBut he warns if the Americans don't yield to Sistani's demands for direct elections, they risk disaster.\n\nGrand Ayatollah MUHAMMAD TAQI AL MODARRESI: The absence of elections in Iraq could lead to civil war not only between the Sunnis and Shi'ites or between the Kurds and Arabs, but also within each group.\n\nIraq is a country with many well-armed people.\n\nIraqis are not afraid of death.\n\nThey are brave.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Meeting with a group of pilgrims from eastern Iraq, the ayatollah insists on their moving closer.\n\nHe counsels patience.\n\nGrand Ayatollah MUHAMMAD TAQI AL MODARRESI: It takes three months to build a small room.\n\nBut if you want to build a skyscraper, it could take you two to three years.\n\nWe want to build an Iraq that lasts.\n\nThose that are now preaching that in a short period of time, all your wishes will be fulfilled, they are either ignorant or they are pretending to be ignorant.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: The man moderate Shia leaders fear most is Moqtada al Sadr.\n\nHe derives his power from the prominence of his late father, a much-revered grand ayatollah.\n\nDEMONSTRATORS: Long live Sadr!\n\nMoqtada is winning!\n\nMOQTADA SADR: The occupation forces are aggressing the oppressed Iraqi people.\n\nThey are being unjust and hateful!\n\nMARTIN SMITH: The most fervent of Sadr's flock wear a green banner that reads \"God's Army.\"\n\nThey are the activist paramilitary wing of his religious movement.\n\nThey have stormed mosques, thrown out moderate clerics and reportedly threatened the lives of Sistani and other moderate ayatollahs.\n\nU.S. military intelligence believes they have also organized violence against occupation forces.\n\nThe army's size is unknown, but it is active across the country.\n\nIRAQI: We Army Mehdi.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: \"We are God's Army,\" he says.\n\nAnother member is the young imam we met in Kirkuk, Abdul Musawi.\n\nWe ran into him in Najaf after he had come from a meeting with Sadr.\n\nABDUL FATTAH AL MUSAWI: So what is the question you wanted to ask?\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Oh, have you met today with Moqtada Sadr?\n\nABDUL FATTAH AL MUSAWI: Every soldier must remain connected to his commander.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: You use military language.\n\nABDUL FATTAH AL MUSAWI: Leadership is not confined to the military.\n\nEveryone can have leaders.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: But you consider you're a soldier in an army of Moqtada's.\n\nABDUL FATTAH AL MUSAWI: I'm a soldier in God's Army.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Many Iraqis are wary of Sadr and his followers.\n\nAdnan Pachachi is a secular Sunni member of the U.S.-appointed Governing Council in Baghdad.\n\nIs it a concern of yours that a person like Moqtada al Sadr can stir up trouble for Iraq?\n\nADNAN PACHACHI, Iraqi Governing Council: He's a-- have you met him, by any chance?\n\nMARTIN SMITH: No.\n\nI've been to his Friday prayers.\n\nI hope to meet him.\n\nADNAN PACHACHI: Well, from what I hear, you know, he's rather unpredictable, shall I say.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: He's young?\n\nADNAN PACHACHI: Yes, he is.\n\n[laughs] MARTIN SMITH: What constituency does Moqtada Sadr represent?\n\nABDUL AZIZ AL HAKIM: There is no general difference in the points of view that we adopt.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Abdul Aziz al Hakim is also a member of the Governing Council.\n\nBut as the political face of Iraqi Shia, he refuses to admit any differences with Sadr.\n\nI ask again, what does Moqtada Sadr represent?\n\nWho are his followers?\n\nABDUL AZIZ AL HAKIM: His followers are those who followed his father before him.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: I spoke with Abdul Aziz al Hakim about Sadr, and he was reluctant to even mention his name.\n\nADNAN PACHACHI: Yes.\n\nThey-- they-- they-- MARTIN SMITH: They don't want to recognize him.\n\nADNAN PACHACHI: No.\n\nThey dislike him.\n\nHe's challenging the established authority.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: For now, Sadr is not openly advocating a break with Sistani.\n\nHe, too, wants direct elections.\n\nIf democracy is coming to Iraq, the Shia must get their due.\n\nABDUL AZIZ AL HAKIM: This is the true meaning of democracy.\n\nWe expect America to deliver.\n\nThe voice of the people is the foundation of the future of Iraq.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Distrust of Americans runs deep in the south.\n\nIn 1991, after the first Gulf war, when Shia rose against Saddam, they were at first encouraged by the U.S. but then abandoned.\n\nThousands were slaughtered by Saddam and buried in mass graves.\n\nToday we've been invited to a memorial service in the town of Shatrah for fallen Shia martyrs.\n\nA veteran of the '91 revolt tells me their fight against the Ba'athists is not over.\n\nThere have been some killings of Ba'athists in the area recently, in the south near Basra.\n\nVETERAN: Ba'athists everywhere are under attack.\n\nWhat they did to us cannot be underestimated, and the mass graves are evidence of this.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: And who is responsible for these killings now of the Ba'athists?\n\nVETERAN: We chase the Ba'athists everywhere.\n\nFor us oppressed Iraqis, we have the right to track the Ba'athists everywhere.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Inside, we attend the memorial service for martyrs of the 15th of Shaban movement, a militant Shia Islamist group.\n\nIts leader, Hamza al Mousawi, complains that decades-old sacrifices are not being recognized by the Americans.\n\nHAMZA Al MOUSAWI: Clearly, the Americans aren't looking out for the stability of the Iraqis but are looking out for themselves.\n\nIf you listen to the American statements, they are using Iraq as a base to fight terrorism.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Mousawi says he doesn't support violence, but there are reports that his own 15th of Shaban movement has been involved in vigilante justice, terrorizing Sunnis, forcing them off their lands.\n\nOur journey had brought us far south, to the marshlands.\n\nHere the great rivers of Iraq, the Tigris and Euphrates, merge.\n\nThis is the land of the Marsh Arabs.\n\nSome people believe that this was the biblical Garden of Eden.\n\nFor centuries, the marshes were impenetrable, beyond the control of outsiders.\n\nDuring the 1980s, they provided a hideout for deserters from the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nAnd after the failed '91 uprising, Shia rebel groups used the area to organize fresh attacks on the regime.\n\nSaddam retaliated by draining the marshes, forcing up to 200,000 Shia to flee, many to Iran, others north to towns like Kirkuk.\n\nNinety percent of the marshes are now destroyed.\n\nWe saw abandoned villages, and where there once water, desert.\n\nCamel trains now cross the dry land from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n\nI traveled with 15th Shaban rebels, who took me to an old hideout.\n\nREBEL: We hid over there.\n\nThis was where we lived.\n\nThis was also a battleground.\n\nWe remained in the hideout and fought from there.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: In a nearby village, they introduced us to the tribesmen who helped protect them.\n\nThe chief of the tribe, Hussein al Jabiri, was himself jailed and tortured by Saddam.\n\nHis old cellmate had come today to visit him.\n\nAll these men have scores to settle.\n\nI talked to the chief over coffee.\n\nHUSSEIN AL JABIRI: I was imprisoned for 15 years.\n\nI was fined.\n\nMy son was imprisoned with me.\n\nAll my family and brothers were in prison.\n\nOur homes were destroyed by Saddam.\n\nWe know where all the Ba'athists live.\n\nGive us the weapons we need.\n\nWe will fight the Ba'athists until they die or we die.\n\nMARTIN SMITH: It will be a long time before the killing stops, before the cycles of revenge wind down.\n\nThere is too much history here.\n\nTraveling across the country for the past five weeks, we've been shadowed by that history.\n\nMany powers have confronted it: Ottoman Turks, British colonialists, Hashemite kings, Saddam Hussein, and now the Americans.\n\nOn our last day, as we headed south through Nasiriya, we ran across history's path again.\n\nSTREET VENDOR: Saddam Hussein!\n\nSaddam Hussein!\n\nMARCELA GAVIRIA, Producer: What happened?\n\nThey grabbed him, yeah?\n\nMARTIN SMITH: Saddam had just been captured.\n\nThis was all just-- spontaneously broke out right after the Governing Council made the official confirmation that Saddam was taken in Tikrit alive today.\n\nA year ago, this was the prize-- the reason we came here, the just ending.\n\nNow it seems like only another stop on the road, a long road.\n\nThat afternoon, we drove out of Iraq."
