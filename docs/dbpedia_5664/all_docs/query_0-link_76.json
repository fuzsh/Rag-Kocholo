        "text": "There is a particular comfort in putting down one’s daily experiences on paper—particularly if those experiences take place in a war zone. For many who served during World War I, keeping a diary offered an outlet, a place into which they could unload their fears and frustrations. Today, these diaries stand as unparalleled historic documents, providing readers with a wealth of information about the day-to-day lives of service members. Whether they consist of brief notes about the weather conditions or the chow, or more elaborate entries about losing a comrade, original diaries stand as unmediated records of the war. In the years following World War I, these diaries were often used by veterans (or their family members) as the basis for memoirs. These retrospective accounts place the events of the war in the context of what came next, and answer the question of what remains memorable many decades later."
