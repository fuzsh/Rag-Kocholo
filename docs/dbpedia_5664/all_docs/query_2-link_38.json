        "text": "Hudson Classical Theater Company is celebrating their 20th season with three exciting shows: The Importance of Being Earnest, The School for Scandal, and Margaret: Shakespeare’s Warrior Queen.\n\nOur August show is an original adaptation of Henry VI, Parts I, II, and III (known as the War of the Roses), exploring the story of Queen Margaret (Katherine Lerner-Lam), one of the strongest, cunning, and most complicated woman Shakespeare ever wrote. Conceived by Jack Kirby, our in-house fight director and adapted by Director Nicholas Martin-Smith, there will be plenty of battle scenes and blood, love and drama, as family fights against family in this historical tragedy.\n\nAll shows are Thurs-Sun at 6:30pm on the North Plaza of The Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument at W 89th & Riverside Drive in Riverside Park."
