        "text": "Editor's note: This is an unedited report of an interview published in 2006 when Owen Smith stood for Labour in a by-election in Blaenau Gwent.\n\nHe lost the election to independent candidate Dai Davies, the former assistant of MP and AM Peter Law, a Labour politician who became an independent in protest at the imposition of an all-women shortlist.\n\nIn the second section 'Owen Smith on' he addresses his views on the Iraq War, the private sector in the NHS, the use of PFI schemes and working as a lobbyist for Pfizer\n\nQ&A\n\nQ This election is taking place in extraordinary circumstances. Should local Labour parties have the right to veto all-women shortlists?\n\nA Yes, is the short answer. Labour needs to be sufficiently flexible and sufficiently big to be able to listen to local opinion. Local opinion was very clearly expressed in Blaenau Gwent, and it was not expressed in favour of an all-women shortlist - it was vehemently expressed against an all-women shortlist. We should have listened to that expression of opinion, and we should have acted upon it.\n\nQ Is that a general principle?\n\nA There needs to be flexibility and intelligence by Labour when looking to address local issues. All of us, I'm sure, think it would be a good thing for there to be more women in politics, and in constituencies where there has been no objection to an all-women list, it can be an extremely useful tool to get what we want, which is more women involved in politics. But where the people in a constituency express their views as vehemently as people did here, that they don't want it, then Labour should be flexible and intelligent and respond to that accordingly.\n\nQ Given what you said there, was Peter Law wrong to quit Labour and stand as an independent?\n\nA No. Peter Law adhered to what he thought was right. It was understandable, what he did.\n\nThere are countervailing motives that I and many other people would have felt, which is about party loyalty.\n\nThat would have led me to a different conclusion, I think - it would have led me, in spite of past misgivings about the local party's wishes not being adhered to, to stay with the party.\n\nTherefore it was regrettable Peter felt he needed to leave the party, and in that respect the events of the last year have been both a political and a personal tragedy.\n\nPeter was someone who had been a Labour Party man for his whole life, and it must have been extremely hard for him to make the decision to leave the party he loved and the party which he had served so well.\n\nQ What should happen about the expulsions of Labour members who supported Mr Law?\n\nA We think we've got to reach out to those people who left the party for the same reason as Peter Law did.\n\nQ So the expulsions should be rescinded?\n\nA I don't know about the formalities or the technicalities of how this should be dealt with, but we need to reach out. I need to explore what that means in terms of the technicalities, and they in turn need to reach out to us. They need to realise Labour has changed and hopefully they may now feel they want to come back and work for Labour.\n\nQ When I came up from Cardiff this morning I saw billboards for the local paper saying 'Furious Mayor quits Labour'. There still appears to be a fallout over the all-women shortlist, the Peter Law affair. How can Labour stabilise the position and stop senior councillors quitting?\n\nA By listening to the lesson Peter Law taught us in the most difficult of fashions. He taught us by thrashing us at the election. You've got to listen to the people and win back their trust.\n\nQ Do you think Mr Law's widow should stand in one of these by-elections?\n\nA I don't know. I'm not going to offer advice to Mrs Law. Obviously it's been a horrible time for her, a personal tragedy for her, and I wouldn't presume to offer her any advice.\n\nQ If we look at some of the socio-economic indices that exist, Blaenau Gwent does very badly.\n\nA It does, but people are sick and tired of hearing that. What they want to hear is about the great potential we've got in these Valleys.\n\nThis is a beautiful part of Wales. You've wandered around Brynmawr today - this is a beautiful stone and brick little town, and its history, its heritage, its culture, and most importantly its sense of community and its sense of place, are the envy of communities across Britain.\n\nIt's something I value hugely and it's something people value here.\n\nOwen Smith on...\n\nThe Iraq War\n\n\"We are making significant inroads in improving what is happening in Iraq.\n\n\"I thought at the time the tradition of the Labour Party and the tradition of left-wing engagement to remove dictators was a noble, valuable tradition, and one that in South Wales, from the Spanish Civil War onwards, we have recognised and played a part in.\"\n\nHe didn't know whether he would have voted against the war, as the previous MP Llew Smith did.\n\nThe involvement of the private sector in the NHS\n\n\"Where they can bring good ideas, where they can bring valuable services that the NHS is not able to deliver, and where they can work alongside but subservient to the NHS and without diminishing in any respect the public service ethos of the NHS, then I think that's fine. I think if their involvement means in any way, shape or form the break up of the NHS, then I'm not a fan of it, but I don't think it does.\"\n\nOn PFI (Private Finance Initiative) schemes, etc\n\n\"We've had PFI in Wales, we've had a hospital built down in Baglan through PFI. If PFI works, then let's do it. What people want to see are more hospitals, better services.\n\n\"City academies in certain parts of inner city Britain, where schools were failing, where children were not being well served, have made great inroads.\n\n\"I'm not someone, frankly, who gets terribly wound up about some of the ideological nuances that get read into some of these things, and I think sometimes they are totally overblown.\"\n\nOn the influx expected into Blaenau Gwent during the by-election campaign of Labour activists from all over Wales and beyond\n\n\"If Labour Party people want to work for a Labour Party victory, then that's great. But I think this campaign has been run in terms of the selection, and will be run, by the Labour Party here in Blaenau Gwent. So I wouldn't characterise people coming from Torfaen or Bridgend or Pontypridd or Swansea as an alien invasion, but as fellow comrades coming to try to return a great Labour Party seat to Labour Party control.\"\n\nWhether he is crazy to think of giving up his highly paid job as a senior lobbyist for pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer to become an MP?\n\n\"That's a really good question, and it gives a really good insight into the fact that I am genuinely committed to working in the public service of communities like Blaenau Gwent.\n\n\"It says I want to come back to Wales, I want to live and work alongside communities that I love, and I want to help them achieve the potential they have.\"\n\nChildren kept out of school to attend 'proud day'\n\nOWEN SMITH defended his decision to keep two of his children off school to attend a photo-call at Labour's office in Brynmawr yesterday.\n\nMr Smith, his wife Liz, and their children Jack, seven, Evan, five, and Isabelle, three, live in Surrey.\n\nHe said the two boys had been kept off their state primary school as \"a special treat\".\n\nAsked whether he thought it was reasonable to keep them off school, Mr Smith said, \"Frankly we came down, we had a weekend with my parents and I think occasionally, when you are seven, five and three, it's fine for them to take a day off school to see their dad on a proud day when he has just been picked to represent the Labour Party in Blaenau Gwent.\n\n\"I think they were very pleased to see me here, and I was very pleased they could be here with me.\"\n\nBut a spokeswoman for Surrey County Council said, \"This does not sound like the kind of absence from school we would encourage.\"\n\nIn Wales, Assembly Government guidance says absence should only be authorised in exceptional circumstances.\n\nBlaenau Gwent's Labour mayor Don Wilcox and his wife Moira have left the party. Mr Wilcox, who joined Labour 53 years ago, said he was appalled by the way that the party reacted to the death of Independent AM and MP Peter Law two weeks ago."
