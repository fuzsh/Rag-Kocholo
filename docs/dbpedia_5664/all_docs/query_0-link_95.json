        "text": "On the other hand, the supporters of Obama’s foreign policy on Middle East, argues that the Middle East Obama inherited was literally at war along with the extremist ideology brewing throughout the region. In fact, Goldberg gives the notion that the policies and actions taken by the administration, prevented much hostile situation in the region than it exist currently. The through negotiation of Iran nuclear deal has somewhat subjected the closed Iranian government and its nuclear experiments to the international community; it was something that previous government was able to do. As for the Egyptian uprising and Hamas is concerned, he states that it was not the Obama, but the Bush administration’s failure to ensure smooth transition within the Egyptian government as well as the American involvement in the Palestinian election which brought terrorist group into the power. Although, he does believe that America should have involved more in to support earlier and modest rebel in Syria, however he also indirectly\n\nThis paper will look at and discuss the presidency’s actions involving Iraq from Reagan to Obama. Each and every president during this time has used different strategies and formats to get their agenda across, to not only convince the public, but the international community as well. We will show how Iraq has gone from an ally to overthrowing the government, to the ensuing turmoil that this created for everyone involved, from ours and their citizenship, governing bodies, and other world leaders. With over 35 years of intervention, we will determine if there has been a consensus of actions among our presidents, and see if there is a cohesive US strategy and long term goals that have been reached for all our effort and actions to all of this.\n\nIn Obama’s Wars, the author brings out the most intimate portrait of the president as Commander in Chief. Woodward tells the inside story of how Obama makes crucial decisions related to the Afghanistan War, the worldwide fight against terrorism, and the secret campaign in Pakistan. By the use of classified documents, internal memos, meeting notes and also hundreds of hours of interviews with several key players such as top generals, diplomats and government officials, not excluding the president himself, he illustrates the critical role of the president in several wars. In his crucial outline of the story, Woodward uncovers information and insights in Obama Wars that is impartially known, covering reports on the internal debates over President\n\nChris Hedges video and readings are very fascinating in terms of understanding the contemporary war around the world. He explained the war and its outcomes from his own experiences that would be powerful massage for the conflict resolution and international war study. First: wars are deadly addicted, he says our history guided us to the war. We tend to forget the unfold story of the war, and just looking at the propagandas and myths. The argument is that war as myth, where the media and reporters has been used adversely in the war. The images, videos, and news are presented as succeed, and proudness, but very few media covers the real war field. Media carries the myth from hotel rooms, where certain edited war footage, and images have provided\n\nn ambassador Dennis Ross’ lecture on the challenges of the US in the Middle East, Ross stressed the challenges that the Trump presidency will faced with. The Trump presidency like many administrations in the past is involved with a crisis or major war. However, this presidency has been lucky enough to already be faced with two issues at the same time. This signals the most difficult presidential position since the Reagan administration. The Trump presidency will be facing two different proxy-wars. With one issue of Yemen and the other being the rising combatant conflict in Syria. Worse yet, the Syria conflict includes several components of enemies that add to its extremity. Terrorist groups such as ISIS involvement, to Assad, to the close Russian\n\nWith war, there are politics. With politics, there may be war. The perspective of man has a monumental impact even on the most minuet things to greater issues that affect society as a whole. Within the realm of politics, specifically the United States, there is democracy in which constituents choose their representatives. There is a general understanding that these representatives are elected to provide the best representation and voice of the people; however, the public’s opinion and the responsibility of utilitarianism of the country that the President must consider can sometimes collide. The rise of Osama Bin Laden and formation of the terrorist group, al Qaeda, with its terroristic\n\nRussia's intervention to support the regime says they are fighting isis but really they are targeting innocent civilians. In Aleppo, two barrel bombs were dropped in a small village with about 10 houses. The first bomb left a number of people injured; but the second one killed lots of people. In the film we met a man named Khalid Farah who has been apart of the white helmets for 3 years. He said that anyone who is killed or injured is treated as if it was his own son, because everyone should have the equal care. Teams of white helmets would leave Syria and go to southern turkey for a month and gain experience, so they could go back and teach their colleagues. We also met a man in the film who crossed the border and said it was a whole new world. This man would see planes in the sky and said if he was back home the planes would be dropping bombs. I learned that Syria is a very dangerous place for just innocent people. One of the questions I had during the film was why don't the people in Syria just leave, since Syria is only getting worse? In the film they say Syria was bad but now it's getting worse so why don't they just leave? Another question I had during the film is why do the volunteers continue what they do after all the people who have been killed in the line of\n\nSince 9/11/01 the United States has been under attack by terrorism and George W. Bush started the war against terrorism but his presidency has ended. Since then Barack Obama has taken over as president and he has a new strategy, which consists of, protecting our homeland by constantly reducing our vulnerabilities, adapting, and updating our defenses, killing Osama bin Laden and many of his top Lieutenants, and giving law enforcement new ways to counter-terrorism. President Obama believes in order to hinder terrorism the US must increase the efficacy of our law enforcement, actively seek out to take out al’ Qaeda’s leaders, and constantly decrease our vulnerabilities.\n\nOn August 4, 1961, a young African American boy was born in the state of Hawaii. Being raised by both his mother and father, this young protegee would grow up to attend Harvard University and be elected into Congress. However, it wasn’t until November 4, 2008 that this unique individual had finally broke through the trials of history. On this very day, Senator Barack Obama officially became the first African American president of the United States. This incredible individual was finally able to break through the trials of history and open a new path for our the American society. Even though Barrack had just been appointed into office, he was still able to successfully carry out his roles as Chief Diplomat and Commander in chief.\n\nOn December 1st 2009, Obama said, “Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive.” He then requested for more troops to help his commanders in Afghanistan. After a few years, he started pulling out troops from Afghanistan while the war was going on, as he once did to the war in Iraq. He kept on sending and pulling back troops out of countries that we are at war with and not at war with. He can’t come to a closing decision on what he want and that’s one of the worse quality a president can have. A president should be able to come to an agreement and stick to the choice that he has made. If there was a conflict or war that was between America and another country, America should propose a compromise that\n\nThe war in Iraq lasted for eight years and resulted in many casualties; the cost of the war was tremendous. The reason for the war changed as time went by, starting with getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and then, when the weapons of mass destruction were not found, the name changed to Iraqi Freedom. A debate between two writers that emerged of the war in Iraq shows different perspectives. Writer John Mueller, who holds the Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies at Ohio State University, makes the case against war on Iraq. Also, writer Brink Lindsey, who is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, is in favor of this war. This paper will examine the perspectives as reported by both John Mueller and Brink Lindsey as they argue about the case of the United States invading Iraq. I will conclude from the evidence that the war on Iraq was unnecessary and counterproductive because it increased not decreased the terrorism, refugee crises, cost lives and money without achieving any of its objectives.\n\nMilitary interventions result in the death of a significant number of armed personnel aimed at eliminating the conflict. There is no basis for military intervention worldwide, especially outside Europe. With no robust international framework, decisions and duties are often not adequately addressed (Pickering & Kisangani, 2006). There is no oversight of the intervention, which leads to problems. Without rules and recommendations, interventions fail time and again because of poor strategy or lack of support. In American thinking, which tends to lean towards meaningless optimism, the wrong is logically replaced with good. The reality is different and the imposition of repressive regimes sometimes leads to greater oppression (Pogge, 2000). This is a particularly painful lesson for well-intentioned Americans who believe they can free the population by smashing or tearing apart countries. President Obama displayed this type of well-intentioned behavior during his tour of Africa where he exacerbated the situation in the region with the failure of his two most ill-conceived “altruistic” interventions, in Sudan and Libya.\n\nAssad had promised his people time and again that political reforms were coming however as his presidency continued, the people’s hopes waned as serious reforms never came. In addition to the lies of reform, Assad has also made claims that his military were not responsible for the brutal crackdowns happening across the country. In an interview with ABC’s Barbara Walters, Assad also denied that Syria held war prisoners which has been vehemently proven wrong. Walter’s went on to say that it felt as though Assad was extremely out of touch with his people and that she felt as if he didn’t accept the reality of what was happening at his own hands."
