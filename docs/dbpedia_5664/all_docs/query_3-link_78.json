        "text": "Soufiane El Bakkali takes gold in thrilling 3,000m steeplechase final, US' Kenneth Rooks wins silver\n\nWhat a thrilling finale to tonight’s action here at the Stade de France!\n\nSoufiane El Bakkali charges in the final stretch to win the 3,000-meter steeplechase, chasing down Kenneth Rooks in the final stages after the American had led much of the final lap.\n\nThere’s a big concern on the western side of the track after Lamecha Girma of Ethiopia, who had been among the leaders the entire race, is being tended to by medical staff. Girma failed to clear a barrier about 200 meters from the finish line and landed extremely hard on the track.\n\nThe Ethiopian didn’t get up and laid on the track for several minutes after falling.\n\nHe’s carried off by medical personnel on a backboard and is being taken to the back.\n\nEl Bakkali rings the winners’ bell and goes off on his victory lap, celebrating with the Moroccans here.\n\nNina Kennedy of Australia tops Katie Moon of the USA to take gold in the women's pole vault\n\nAustralia’s Nina Kennedy is going to beat Katie Moon in the pole vault after the American failed two attempts at clearing 4.95 meters.\n\nMoon had failed her first attempt at getting over 4.90 meters and then opted to pass the rest of that height, which meant she only got two opportunities to clear 4.95 meters. Kennedy passed the 4.90-meter height on her first attempt.\n\nKennedy and Moon both failed on their first attempts at 4.95 meters, which meant that it all came down to Moon’s last jump. If she cleared the bar, then Kennedy would have had to match her and clear it herself. But if she missed, she handed the Aussie the gold and would have to settle for silver.\n\nMoon ran down the runway and planted her pole, but just couldn’t get her body over the bar. It fell to the ground and Kennedy began to sob as she was mobbed by her family in the stands.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Australia’s Nina Kennedy.\n\nJamaica's Rojé Stona wins the gold medal in the discus throw in a major upset\n\nRojé Stona has just ruined the Alekna family’s plan for a party in Paris.\n\nThe Jamaican has topped Mykolas Alekna, the top-ranked discus thrower in the world and the owner of the world record. Stona takes home the gold and the Olympic record that Alekna held for a few short minutes earlier tonight.\n\nAlekna had beaten his father’s Olympic record with a toss of 69.97 meters on his second throw of the competition. But just a bit later, Stona tossed the discus 70 meters even, setting a new Olympic record and doing enough to take home the gold.\n\nThe stage was set for Alekna to top Stona on his final throw, but the disappointing effort fell well short.\n\n“It’s a very special night. It’s everything I wanted, but for it to actually happen, it’s a very good feeling,” Stona said post-final.\n\nStona finished 19th in the world championships in 2023, yet became an Olympic champion one year later, a feat that surprised even the Jamaican.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Jamaica’s Rojé Stona.\n\nMohammadhadi Saravi wins men's 97kg Greco-Roman wrestling gold for Iran\n\nIran’s Mohammadhadi Saravi has beaten Artur Aleksanyan of Armenia 4-1 to take home the gold medal in the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling 97kg class.\n\nCuba’s Gabriel Rosillo and Uzur Dzhuzupbekov of Kyrgyzstan took bronze.\n\nTeam USA's Quincy Hall charges down the stretch for an incredible come-from-behind win in the 400 meters\n\nThe competitors are out for the men’s 400-meter final race and American Quincy Hall is the favorite here in an otherwise wide-open race\n\nRunning out of lane eight, Hall seemed to barely get out of a jog during qualifying for this race and feels likely to take home the gold here — possibly with a new world record.\n\nThe gun sounds and they’re off! A massive roar from the Stade de France crowd as 80,000 watch the first gold medal race of the evening.\n\nHall trails most of the race and is in sixth as they come around the final curve. But here comes Hall!\n\nCharging down the final straightaway, Hall makes up ground quickly — the effort written on his face — and he’s suddenly passing runners.\n\nIn the final meters, Hall overtakes Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith in a thrilling finish, beating the Team GB runner to the line by .04 seconds!\n\nOn his unbelievable finish, Hall told reporters afterwards: “I was just thinking, ‘Get home, sir. Get home, sir.’”\n\nAs a result, it’s a gold for Quincy Hall, silver for Hudson-Smith and bronze for Zambia’s Muzala Samukonga.\n\nHall rings the victory bell here at the Stade de France and takes off his shoes to pose for a photo.\n\nHe grabs Old Glory and goes for a shoeless victory lap around the track here, being cheered as he goes. It’s an incredible moment for the American, who ran a personal best and led for only a tenth of a second in the race, leaning across the finish line to take the gold from Hudson-Smith.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team USA’s Quincy Hall.\n\nJamaica's Rojé Stona tops Mykolas Alekna's Olympic record in the discus, minutes after it was set\n\nAn incredible moment here at the Stade de France!\n\nMere minutes after Lithuania’s Mykolas Alekna beats his father’s Olympic record in the discus throw, Jamaica’s Rojé Stona outdoes him and takes it for himself.\n\nWith an incredible 70-meter throw, Stona is now in the lead for gold and has the Olympic record. It’ll take another Olympic record to top him, but Alekna owns the world record in this competition and will feel like he can do it.\n\nPoland's Natalia Kaczmarek wins third semifinal heat in the women's 400-meter run\n\nNatalia Kaczmarek of Poland is on to the finals after winning the third semifinal heat here in the women’s 400-meter run.\n\nAmber Anning of Great Britain finishes in second.\n\nKaczmarek finishes in 49.45 seconds, Anning in 49.47.\n\nChina beats the USA to gold in enthralling team acrobatic routine final\n\nSome of the best athletes in Paris are competing right now!\n\nThe artistic swimmers representing 10 countries that have qualified for the team acrobatic routine are delighting the packed Saint-Denis Aquatic Center.\n\nJaw dropping synergy and stunts … it’s like watching swimming combined with dance, gymnastics, cheerleading and the endurance of water polo.\n\nTeam USA was thrilled with their performance scoring a 271.3166, which put them in gold medal position for a brief time.\n\nChina followed the USA with a more difficult routine and grabbed gold. USA finishes in silver. Spain in third.\n\nCanada used Snoop Dog music, so clearly the People’s Choice award!\n\nSnoop Dogg drops in on the skateboarding\n\nWe’re into the closing stages of the men’s park skateboarding final and it’s still Keegan Palmer who leads.\n\nThe Australian tops the standings with a big score of 93.11, ahead of USA’s Tom Schaar and Brazil’s Augusto Akio, who celebrated his third run by jumping off his skateboard and juggling with three juggling clubs.\n\nSnoop Dogg has also made an appearance, walking around the edge of the concrete bowl and greeting some of the competitors.\n\nHe’s been a constant presence throughout these Games, carrying the Olympic torch at the opening ceremony and also being involved with NBCUniversal’s coverage.\n\n“Amazing event,” Snoop said about the skateboarding. “I got to see Tony Hawk and the skaters. And a bunch of good kids doing their thing.”\n\nPressed to reveal his favorite Olympic sport, Snoop remained impartial: “All of them,” he responded.\n\nUS figure skating team finally receives Beijing 2022 gold medals in ceremony under the Eiffel Tower\n\nThey say good things come to those that wait – and the wait has certainly been worth it for the USA’s figure skating team.\n\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the US finished second behind the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) in the team event, with Japan coming third.\n\nHowever, after Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva had a doping test come back positive for the performance-enhancing substance trimetazidine, no medals were awarded.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) then handed down a decision to disqualify Valieva of “all competitive results” achieved since her positive test, and announced the US and Japan would move up to first and second respectively.\n\nInstead of receiving their medals in front of empty stands in Beijing, though, Team USA had their golds placed around their necks at a packed Champions Park in Paris today.\n\nA huge roar went up from the crowd as the skaters held their medals and bouquets aloft.\n\nThe Japanese team members – who were awarded their silver medals alongside the USA and emerged from the tunnel with beaming smiles while doing the conga – stepped off the platform to allow the Americans to have their gold medal moment.\n\nRead more about the controversial saga surrounding the 2022 figure skating medals here.\n\nDefending champion Keegan Palmer leads men's park skateboarding final after first run\n\nThe men’s park skateboarding final is underway at Place de La Concorde and it’s Australian Keegan Palmer, the defending champion in this event, who leads with a big score of 93.11.\n\nAs he comes out of the bowl, Palmer gets a big hug from Tate Carew, the world’s top-ranked skater who’s clearly impressed with what he’s seen.\n\nUSA’s Tom Schaar is the only other person to complete a run, scoring 90.11.\n\nEach competitor has three runs in total with their highest score counting towards the final standings.\n\nLi Fabin successfully defends men’s 61kg weightlifting title, setting Olympic record along the way\n\nChina’s Li Fabin successfully defended his men’s 61kg weightlifting title on Wednesday, as he set a new Olympic record along the way.\n\nThe 31-year-old lifted 143kg in the snatch portion of the contest for the Olympic record – Fabin also holds the world record of 146kg in that discipline for his weight category.\n\nFabin then was able to lift 167kg in the clean and jerk portion before failing at his attempt at 172kg.\n\nNevertheless, Fabin was able to hold onto his Olympic gold, which he won in Tokyo three years ago with a combined score of 310.\n\nTheerapong Silachai of Thailand won silver with 303 points while Team USA’s Hampton Morris won bronze with 298.\n\nThere was drama with the last attempt of the event as Morris, who already had bronze wrapped up, aimed for silver with a world record attempt at a 178kg clean and jerk – he holds the current record at 176kg.\n\nHaving successfully performed the clean aspect of the lift, Morris couldn’t quite maintain the jerk part. Although Morris was clearly disappointed, he left the stage with a smile and loud applause from the crowd at his effort.\n\nLéon Marchand tells CNN what goes through his mind before a race\n\nNo matter where Léon Marchand goes, a mass hysteria tends to follow.\n\nThe support reached its peak when France’s new hero was competing for medals inside Paris’ La Defense Arena, a venue which generated arguably the best atmosphere of the Games so far.\n\nBut amid all the swirling noise and electric energy, there was still a swimmer bidding to do his best against a world-class field of rivals.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, Marchand explained what went through his mind as he stood poised on the starting blocks at this year’s Olympics.\n\n“The pool was really noisy, I was trying to focus on myself, keep building my energy up,” he said.\n\n“When I got on [the starting block], I thought about what I did in the last few years. A lot of work, really hard.\n\nAustralia’s Matt Wearn retains his men's dinghy Olympic gold after weather disrupted medal race\n\nAustralia’s Matt Wearn retained his men’s dinghy sailing Olympic title on Wednesday after a weather-disrupted medal race in Marseille.\n\nWearn, who had been the overall fleet leader heading into the medal race, was made to wait after it had to be resailed due to the weather in southern France.\n\nBut when it eventually got back underway, the 28-year-old made no doubt of his gold medal by winning the medal race to finish on 40 points, finishing five seconds ahead of Cyprus’ Pavlos Kontides in second on 56 points.\n\nWearn becomes the first man to win back-to-back gold medals in this format of sailing.\n\nIt was a momentous silver medal for Kontides, who claims Cyprus’s second ever Olympic medal in any sport – Kontides won the other one as a silver medalist in London in 2012.\n\nBronze went to Peru’s Stefano Peschiera, who won the South American nation’s first Olympic medal in any sport since 1992.\n\nFrance's Léon Marchand explains why his parents didn't initially want him to pursue a swimming career\n\nLéon Marchand is arguably the best swimmer in the world right now, but it could have been so very different.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Coy Wire, the Frenchman said his parents initially weren’t keen on him starting a swimming career.\n\nBoth his mother and father swam in the Olympic Games, so were aware of how much work was required to compete at the very top level.\n\nThankfully, Marchand didn’t listen and the rest is history.\n\nSwimming superstar Léon Marchand tells CNN how the Paris crowd inspired his Olympic success\n\nThe sight of Léon Marchand flying through the pool, to the deafening sound of the Paris crowd cheering him on, will be one of the lasting memories of this year’s Olympics.\n\nSwimming’s latest superstar won a total of five medals – four gold and one bronze – at his home Games and became a household name as a result.\n\n“It was amazing. The first day was definitely the most impressive for me. I just came on the pool side and the whole pool was cheering for me,” he told CNN’s Coy Wire.\n\nOut of all his races, Marchand said the 200m butterfly final was his favorite.\n\nHe beat world record holder Kristóf Milák in a tense battle which almost blew the roof off Paris’ La Défense Arena.\n\nMarit Bouwmeester creates history with gold in women’s dinghy while men’s medal race is abandoned\n\nMarit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands became the most successful woman in Olympic sailing as she won her fourth medal on Wednesday, winning the women’s dinghy gold.\n\nShe finished fourth in the medal race – the race had been delayed until winds picked up – but her 38 points were enough to ensure she left Marseille as an Olympic champion again.\n\n“I should have probably gone for the win a bit more,” she said after the race. “It was quite hard because I’ve already seen family and I spent some time with my daughter, but it was nice being out there, nice to see the fight, and it was a good race.\n\n“It’s incredible. I’m so proud. I always say the big example is when people dominate and change the sport and not do it once, but do it multiple times, and to be one of them is incredible.”\n\nThe 36-year-old now has two golds – the other coming 8 years ago in Rio – one silver and a bronze medal to her name.\n\nDenmark’s Anne-Marie Rindom won silver with 61 points, while Line Flem Hoest of Norway claimed bronze with 75.\n\nMeanwhile, the men’s dinghy race was abandoned midway through due to weather.\n\nThe sailors were heading to the third mark when race control flew the blue and white checkered flag to signal racing should be stopped. According to Olympics.com, the resailing has been delayed due to weather.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from The Netherlands’ Marit Bouwmeester.\n\nThis 51-year-old proved that age is just a number in a field full of teenagers\n\nSkateboarding at this year’s Olympic Games has seen some of sport’s best and brightest talent shine on the world’s biggest stage.\n\nFourteen-year-old Arisa Trew won gold in the women’s skateboarding park event on Tuesday. The event also saw 15-year-old Cocona Hiraki finish second and 16-year-old Sky Brown complete the podium with a bronze medal.\n\nIn the men’s skateboarding park event, there is also a competitor defying the odds and age-based expectations – just at the complete other end of the spectrum. What he lacks in youthful exuberance, 51-year-old Andy Macdonald more than makes up for in experience.\n\nMacdonald, representing Great Britain at the Olympics, is somewhat of a skateboarding icon. He has a record 23 X-Games medals in skateboarding, has skateboarded through the White House and is also good friends with the iconic Tony Hawk – who made the trip to Paris to see Macdonald skate.\n\nWhile Macdonald did not advance to the men’s park final, he seemed to have a brilliant time skating in front of a packed crowd and proved to millions around the world that age is just a number.\n\n“Nobody can take our home.\" Ukrainian fencer talks about the extra burden when competing at Games\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered tanks and troops into Ukraine in February 2022, it triggered Europe’s largest land invasion since World War II.\n\nNearly two-and-a-half years later, the war grinds on with Ukrainians fighting a battle for survival and trying to push Russian forces out of their country.\n\nAfter missing out on a medal at the last Games in Tokyo in 2021, the world of Ukrainian fencer Olga Kharlan – and that of her countrymen and women – was turned upside down.\n\nKharlan, competing at her fifth Olympic Games, is making up for lost time in Paris.\n\nDays after the opening ceremony, she claimed a dramatic individual bronze medal, rallying from a six-point deficit to beat South Korea’s Choi Se-bin and hand her country its first medal at the 2024 Games.\n\nIt served as a tonic for her to put on a brilliant performance and lead Ukraine to a stunning comeback win against South Korea for the country’s first gold in Paris.\n\nRead more about Kharlan’s decision not to shake hands with a Russian fencer\n\nRecord-breaking 14-year-old skateboard gold medalist reveals gift she asked for if she won Olympic title\n\nWin an Olympic gold medal and some might want a new car or a new phone from their parents or sponsors. But for 14-year-old Arisa Trew, she had a different gift in mind.\n\nTrew, who won skateboarding gold in the women’s park event to become Australia’s youngest ever Olympic champion, revealed that she’d asked her parents for a pet duck if she won the Olympic title.\n\n“My dad’s been like saying yes this whole time, but my mom was saying no,” she told 10 Sport. “But then I said, ‘If I did win, could I get a duck?’ And she said yes.”\n\nWhat does someone do with a pet duck? Well, Trew already has some ideas in mind. “I’m going to take the duck to the skate park as well and take it on walks.”\n\nBut aside from the promise of a mallard mascot, just having her parents in Paris has been reward enough.\n\n“It was really cool having my parents here because I was just really excited to have them there and watch me skate because they’ve been there through all my training,” she said.\n\n“They’ve taken me to the skate park at like 9 p.m. some nights. It’s just like late night and all this effort and them supporting me through it all, taking me everywhere around the world. It’s just amazing to have them see what I’ve done.”\n\nTrew also revealed that members of her skateboarding school back in Australia, Level Up, slept out in the skate park to watch her win gold.\n\nKatie Ledecky tells CNN what she plans to do after retiring from competition one day\n\nKatie Ledecky is only 27 years old, so has many more years of racing ahead of her. But, inevitably, her reign of dominance will have to end one day.\n\nThe American swimmer, though, told CNN that she wants to stay involved in the sport for as long as possible, even after retiring.\n\nGiven she is one of the greatest swimmers in history – not to mention the most decorated female US Olympian of all time – few would be better placed to take up a coaching role in Team USA.\n\nHowever, having seen the sacrifices her own team makes to help her achieve her dreams, she’s unsure whether a career as a coach is for her. Although, she didn’t totally rule it out.\n\n“I’ll always be attached to swimming in some respect,” she added.\n\nKatie Ledecky tells CNN what her parents sacrificed to support her remarkable career\n\nBehind every Olympian stands a support network that has had to make sacrifices for their loved one to achieve on the global stage.\n\nFor Katie Ledecky, it was her parents who helped lay the foundations for her incredible career.\n\nIn her interview with CNN, the American swimmer paid tribute to those early years when her parents would wake up at the crack of dawn to ferry their child to training.\n\nLedecky comes from a family of high-achievers. Her father David is a Harvard-educated lawyer and her mother Mary Gen was a collegiate swimmer. Her uncle Jon co-owns the NHL’s New York Islanders, while her brother also graduated from Harvard.\n\nKatie Ledecky tells CNN how studying at Stanford helped influence her record-breaking career\n\nNot only is Katie Ledecky one of the best swimmers in history, she is also a Stanford alumnus.\n\nThe American studied psychology at the famed university and told CNN that the experience has helped her excel in the pool, as well as everyday life.\n\nNeedless to say that Ledecky excelled on the Stanford swim team where she won eight NCAA titles and set an impressive 15 NCAA records.\n\nStanford, naturally, hasn’t forgotten about Ledecky either. The famous ‘Stanford Tree’ – the university’s mascot – was in Paris and posed for a picture with the legendary swimmer.\n\nKatie Ledecky praises \"incredible\" atmosphere in Paris during CNN interview\n\nA number of athletes have praised the special atmosphere created by thousands of fans at this year’s Olympics, but few venues can compete with Paris’ La Defense Arena which hosted the swimming events.\n\nKatie Ledecky helped create some of those magical moments with her brilliant performances in the pool, where she won four medals – two gold, one silver and one bronze.\n\nHer success also saw her became the most decorated female US Olympian of all time.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, Ledecky said the atmosphere in Paris was made all the more impressive considering the lack of crowds in Tokyo three years ago due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n“The energy here in Paris has been incredible,” she said.\n\nWorld record tumbles twice in men’s sprint cycling qualifying\n\nFirst Matthew Richardson and then Harrie Lavreysen.\n\nThe world record was broken twice at the National Velodrome in Paris as qualifying for the men’s sprint cycling event took place.\n\nThe previous record of 9.100 seconds – held by Trinidad and Tobago’s Nicholas Paul, set in 2019 – was first broken by Australia’s Richardson with a time of 9.091.\n\nBut moments later, Lavreysen of the Netherlands went one better to best Richardson’s record, finishing at a time of 9.088 to set a new world record.\n\nIt means that of the 30 riders to take part in qualifying, Lavreysen and Richardson finished first and second respectively, with the top 24 riders advancing to the knockout stage of the competition.\n\nThe beginning of the heat stage of the men’s sprint will be held later on Wednesday.\n\nFrench runner Alice Finot proposes to her boyfriend in latest act of Olympic love\n\nParis is known as the “City of Love” for a reason.\n\nAfter claiming fourth place and setting a new European record in the women’s 3000m steeplechase, French athlete Alice Finot made sure that it was a day to remember for multiple reasons.\n\nShe headed over to her boyfriend in the stands after the race to propose to him in a heartwarming moment at the Stade de France.\n\nFinot smashed the existing European record to finish with a time 8:58.67, finishing behind medalists Winfred Yavi, Peruth Chemutai and Faith Cherotich. It was the first time in the history of the event that four women had completed the race in under 9 minutes.\n\nThis is at least the third proposal at the Games. After winning gold in the mixed doubles event, Chinese badminton player Huang Yaqiong’s was proposed to by her boyfriend and fellow badminton player Liu Yuchen. Also, two of Argentina’s athletes — handball’s Pablo Simonet and hockey’s Maria Campoy — got engaged in the Olympic Village, according to Olympics.com.\n\nAustralian hockey team member detained over suspected cocaine purchase\n\nAn Australian hockey team member is in custody after being brought in for questioning on Tuesday, the Australian Olympic Committee said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office told CNN that police on Tuesday detained an Australian man, “who is said to be a member of the Australian field hockey team,” on suspicion of buying cocaine in central Paris. The seller was also detained, prosecutors said.\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said that, due to the quantity seized, the investigation was passed on to the narcotics unit.\n\nThe Australian Olympic Committee said that “no charges have been laid” and that they are “continuing to make enquiries and arrange support for the Team member.”\n\nCamera operator almost causes further chaos in men's 5000m heats\n\nAfter the first men’s 5000m heat ended with athletes strewn across the track, the second heat almost saw a repeat.\n\nThis time, it was an oblivious camera operator who threatened to derail the race.\n\nWith four laps left to go, the athletes were bunched together as they took the first bend.\n\nHowever, seemingly focused on filming the javelin event taking place at the same time, an operator unwittingly walked straight into the path of the runners.\n\nFortunately, everyone was able to avoid a collision and stay on their feet, but it did force many to take a break in their stride.\n\nPoland's Aleksandra Mirosław wins first-ever speed climbing gold medal\n\nAleksandra Mirosław has just made Olympic history at the climbing wall in Le Bourget, winning the first-ever gold medal in speed climbing.\n\nThe Polish athlete, who set a world record in qualifying, defeated China’s Deng Lijuan in the women’s final with a time of 6.10 seconds – 0.08 ahead of Deng and 0.04 off her world record.\n\nMirosław explained that making history as the event’s first Olympic champion “means a lot.”\n\nIn the bronze medal race – here called the “small final” – another Polish climber, Aleksandra Kałucka, won the bronze medal against Indonesia’s Rajiah Sallsabillah.\n\nAn error ultimately derailed Sallsabillah’s chances, allowing Kałucka to cruise to victory in 6.53.\n\nClimbing made its Olympic debut in Tokyo three years ago, but this is the first time that speed climbing is being contested as a medal event on its own; the other discipline at these Games is boulder and lead.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Poland’s Aleksandra Mirosław.\n\nVinesh Phogat’s replacement announced after Indian wrestler is disqualified for missing weight\n\nAfter Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the gold medal match for missing her weight at the Paris Games, the Indian wrestler’s replacement in the women’s 50kg freestyle category final has been announced.\n\nCuba’s Yusneylis Guzmán Lopez will step into face American wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt in Wednesday’s final, wrestling’s international governing body – United World Wrestling – said on social media.\n\nPhogat, the first Indian woman to qualify for an Olympic wrestling final, did not make the weight required to compete on Wednesday morning, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said.\n\n“Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning,” the IOA said in a statement posted to X.\n\nCompetition rules say wrestlers must stay in their weight category on both days of the tournament. After Phogat’s disqualification, only the gold and bronze medals will be awarded in this event.\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association has lodged “a strong protest against the international wrestling federation” following the decision to disqualify Vinesh Phogat, the country’s sport minister said on Wednesday.\n\nIndia's Olympic association lodges protest on Modi’s request following wrestler’s disqualification\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association has lodged “a strong protest against the international wrestling federation” following the decision to disqualify Vinesh Phogat, the country’s sport minister said on Wednesday.\n\nState broadcaster All India Radio News (AIR News) reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday asked the head of the country’s Olympic association to lodge a protest and “explore the options India has.”\n\nPhogat, the first Indian woman to qualify for an Olympic wrestling final, did not make the weight required to compete Wednesday morning, the IOA said.\n\nCompetition rules say wrestlers must stay in their weight category on both days of the tournament. After Phogat’s disqualification, only the gold and bronze medals will be awarded in this event.\n\nPhogat, a three-time Olympian, was set to face Team USA’s Sarah Hildebrandt in today’s final.\n\nA little over a year ago, Phogat was sleeping on the streets of New Delhi as part of an athlete-led protest calling out sexual harassment allegations within her sport.\n\nThese Irish Olympic champions had planned to get the bus home. Instead, a fan offered them a ride\n\nYou might expect an Olympic champion would travel in style upon their return home with gold medal in tow.\n\nBut that wasn’t the case for Ireland’s men’s lightweight double sculls champions, Fintan McCarthy and Paul O’Donovan.\n\nHaving arriving back at Dublin Airport, the duo had planned to get the bus to Cork with all their gear, a journey of about 160 miles. But a fan who had been on the same flight from Paris took pity on them.\n\nThe man, identified only as Ciaran, offered McCarthy and O’Donovan a ride in his car after meeting them on the flight. And despite the pair acknowledging the multitude of bags they had with them, off they went.\n\nAs McCarthy put it in a comment on Dublin Airport’s Instagram post about their arrival in Ireland: “Ciaran coming in clutch.”\n\nBoth rowers are from Skibbereen in County Cork.\n\nMutaz Essa Barshim pulls up with apparent injury in high jump qualification, recovers to make final\n\nOlympic champion Mutaz Essa Barshim gave fans in the Stade de France a scare when he pulled up with an apparent injury during high jump qualification.\n\nThe Qatari athlete was attempting to clear 2.27m at the first time of asking but didn’t even attempt his jump, going to ground on the field inside the stadium clutching his right leg.\n\nWho was first to check on Barshim? His friend and co-gold medalist in Tokyo, Italy’s Gianmarco Tamberi. The two jumpers shared the gold in the Japanese capital in a historic moment where they both opted to not continue with a jump-off.\n\nThankfully, for Barshim, he was able to recover and clear the height on his second attempt, though he appeared to still be troubled by the injury, immediately grabbing at the leg after the jump.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the injury will affect his participation in the final.\n\nTamberi, meanwhile, failed to make 2.27 on all three of his attempts but still advances to the final having cleared 2.20 and 2.24 with a clean record.\n\nChaos in the men's 5000m heats as athletes tumble to the track\n\nThere is simply never a dull moment at this year’s Olympics.\n\nWhat started off as a routine heat in the men’s 5000m event, ended in utter chaos as multiple athletes were left strewn over the track.\n\nThe race had been heating up slowly and then sprung into action as the runners approached the final lap.\n\nJust as the athletes took the bell, Canada’s Mohammed Ahmed fell down, leaving him way behind the leading group which raced on frantically to the finish line.\n\nBut that was just a taste of things to come.\n\nAs the leaders swung around the bend onto the home straight, four men were sent flying to the track.\n\nThe incident seemed to start with a tussle between Team GB’s George Mills and France’s Hugo Hay, and resulted in the British runner bumping into two runners on his outside. All three men fell to the track, tripping up another runner behind them.\n\n“I got stepped out on. I was about to kick in the home straight and, boom, the French lad took me down,” Mills told BBC Sport after the race.\n\nMills was clearly annoyed at Hay and angrily confronted his rival at the finish line, shrugging off the Frenchman’s attempts at reconciliation.\n\nWhen asked what he said to his opponent, Mills added: “I’m probably not allowed to say.”\n\nHay finished seventh and was one of eight men to qualify for the final, while Mills eventually crossed the line in 18th after picking himself up off the floor.\n\nAfter a series of appeals, Mills, Mike Foppen, Thierry Ndikumwenayo and Dominic Lokinyomo Lobalu have all since been added to the final after the falls.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Team GB’s George Mills and information of appeals.\n\nJonathan Owens on \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" watching wife Simone Biles in Paris\n\nWhile Simone Biles always looks like the coolest person in the room every time she performs, it turns out watching the 11-time Olympic medalist as a loved one is a nerve-wracking experience.\n\nIn the latest episode of HBO’s Hard Knocks, Biles’ husband – Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens – headed to Paris to watch his wife represent Team USA on the world’s biggest stage.\n\nBefore he boarded the flight to the French capital, Owens video called Biles where the gymnast said hello to her dogs and reminded her husband on Europe’s rules on bringing liquids past airport security.\n\n“I try to remember her routines, so it’ll be like random times she’s on the floor and she does something, and I try to be up there [mimics a dance move] and like knowing the piece, just so I know what’s going on.”\n\nBut as for millions of spectators around the world, watching Biles on beam is a more stressful experience for the NFL player.\n\n“I’m just sitting there watching and especially when she’s on beam, oh my gosh, beam like trips me out. I’m like ‘Babe, there’s no way y’all are like doing flips, just landing on it.’ But landings, all this type of stuff and I’m just watching like [deep inhale].\n\nHard Knocks then shows Owens in the stands watching with the Biles family, keeping score of the events and cheering at every opportunity for the record-breaking star before heading back home where he supports Biles from the sofa.\n\nAs Olympic breaking debuts in Paris, a Moroccan duo is head over heels about the Games\n\nFor Moroccan b-boy Bilal Mallakh and b-girl Fatima El-Mamouny, the Paris Games will always hold a special significance. They’re the first Olympics to feature the sport of breaking, and the Moroccan pair are the only Africans competing in the discipline.\n\nMallakh and El-Mamouny earned their ticket to Paris by winning their respective finals at the inaugural World DanceSport Federation’s (WDSF) African Championship in Rabat in May 2023.\n\nEl-Mamouny says the biggest challenge so far is training with the rigor of an Olympic athlete while keeping the essence of breaking in each performance. “We’ll encounter several difficulties like any athlete on the eve of the Olympics, but I’m not going to give up. It’s both stressful and exciting,” she added.\n\nBreaking – or breakdancing, as it is most commonly known – originated on the streets of New York’s South Bronx in the early 1970s. Dancers would show off their moves during percussion “breaks” in songs played at clubs and block parties, giving the discipline its name.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBelgian triathlete who fell ill after Seine race says she did not contract E. coli\n\nThe Belgian triathlete who fell ill after swimming in the women’s race says that she did not contract E.coli.\n\nIn a post on her Instagram page Tuesday, Claire Michel said she felt the need to “clarify a few things” following “conflicting information.”\n\n“Blood tests showed that I contracted a virus (not E. Coli),” Michel said, adding that after three days of vomiting and diarrhea, she ended up needing “significant” medical attention at the Polyclinic in the Olympic village.\n\nMichel did not specify the virus she contracted.\n\nOn Sunday, the Belgium Olympic Committee announced that its team was dropping out of the triathlon mixed relay race after Michel fell ill.\n\nThe statement did not specify Michel’s illness but had pointed words that appeared to be aimed at organizers: “The COIB and Belgian Triathlon hope that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games such as guaranteeing training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes and support personnel.”\n\nMichel, who has now returned to Belgium, said she is “gradually” doing better.\n\nThe triathlon races took place in the River Seine after water quality results were deemed “very good” by the organizers. The marathon swimming races are also scheduled in the Seine for Thursday and Friday.\n\nMarathon swimmers were cleared to enter the water to train Wednesday morning in the French capital, a day after organizers canceled a training session due to “water quality concerns.”\n\nParis 2024 said in statement Wednesday that the latest test results “have been assessed as compliant by World Aquatics,” allowing for the familiarization session to go ahead.\n\nSpain wins first gold medal in athletics with victory in the marathon mixed relay race walk\n\nIt has taken until day 12, but Spain is finally in the gold medal column in an athletics event at the Paris Olympics.\n\nMaría Pérez crossed the line first in marathon mixed relay race walk to make her and partner Álvaro Martín the event’s first ever champions.\n\nThe Spanish duo eventually won by a commanding margin of 51 seconds, with Pérez extending the gap to Ecuadorian rival Glenda Morejón in the latter stages of the race to post a time of 2:50:31.\n\nThe 30-year-old confirmed that this would be his last Olympics.\n\n“I only came here without an Olympic medal and, thanks to María, I return with two,” he added.\n\nPérez became a triple crown champion with the win, having previously won gold at the European and world championships.\n\nMorejón took silver with her partner Brian Pintado, who became the first Ecuadorian to ever win two medals at the same Games – he claimed gold in the men’s 20km (approximately 12.4 miles) event.\n\nThe Australian duo of Rhydian Cowley and Jemima Montag took bronze, finishing with a time of 2:51:38.\n\nSpain won its first gold medal in the skiff sailing competition on Friday.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Spain’s María Pérez and Álvaro Martín.\n\nMarathon swimming training session held in River Seine\n\nA day after organizers canceled a training session for Paris 2024 marathon swimmers in the River Seine, athletes were cleared to train in the water Wednesday morning in the French capital.\n\nThe decision was reached at an early morning meeting on water quality attended by representatives from World Aquatics, including their Technical Delegates and Medical Delegates, Paris 2024, Météo France, DRIEAT, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the Île-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the statement said.\n\nThe training session in the Seine is being held from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. local time.\n\nAll teams participating in the swimming marathon will also be provided with a “detailed water quality report with the exact E.coli and Enterococci values,” World Aquatics said.\n\nCNN’s Natasha Maguder contributed to this report.\n\nOlympic triumph to torment for Indian wrestler who led anti-sexual harassment protests\n\nAn Olympic story of hope and perseverance quickly turned to one of heartbreak after an Indian wrestler known for her role in anti-sexual harassment protests was disqualified from the gold medal match of the women’s 50kg freestyle category.\n\nVinesh Phogat, the first Indian woman to qualify for an Olympic wrestling final, did not make the weight required to compete this morning, the Indian Olympic Association said.\n\n“Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning,” the association said.\n\nCompetition rules say wrestlers must stay in their weight category on both days of the tournament. After Phogat’s disqualification, only the gold and bronze medals will be awarded in this event.\n\nPhogat, a three-time Olympian, was set to face Team USA’s Sarah Hildebrandt in today’s final.\n\nBefore the latest cruel twist of fate, she had appeared guaranteed to come away with either a gold or silver medal.\n\nA little over a year ago, Phogat was sleeping on the streets of New Delhi as part of an athlete-led protest calling out sexual harassment allegations within her sport.\n\nIn India, she and her fellow wrestlers have become the very public face of an ongoing protest movement that has created global headlines and sparked a fierce #MeToo debate.\n\nThey camped for weeks last year demanding action on sexual harassment claims made against the president of the Wrestling Federation of India.\n\nPolice charged Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh with assault, stalking and sexual harassment. He has denied all allegations against him.\n\nPhogat’s fellow wrestlers had hailed her journey to the final as both a personal and collective triumph for India’s wrestling community.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nSimone Biles tells CNN about the viral moment she bowed to Rebeca Andrade\n\nOne of the enduring images of these Olympic Games will be Simone Biles and her USA teammate Jordan Chiles bowing to Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade as she took her place atop the podium after winning gold in the floor exercise.\n\nIt was a display of sportsmanship and humility, and encapsulated what it means for athletes to have the Olympic spirit.\n\nWithout doubt, it will go down as one of the most iconic Olympic moments.\n\n“I think it was really important for that moment,” Biles tells CNN Sport’s Coy Wire. “Obviously, it was just me and Jordan being me and Jordan, but I know it was really special and it was very impactful for kids to see that. You win with grace, you lose with grace.”\n\nDuring these Olympics, Biles faced comments online about her appearance, specifically her hairstyle.\n\nShe hit back at those critics in an Instagram post and had a message for young girls around the world who have faced similar disparaging comments.\n\n“You guys are beautiful, confident,” she said."
