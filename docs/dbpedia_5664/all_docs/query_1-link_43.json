        "text": "Historically, Iraq and other rogue states have always been security threats for the US. However, foreign policy analysts are deeply divided over the US decision to invade Iraq, and ultimately the explanations for that decision. As Iraq continues to finds itself in devastation years after the war ended and Hussein’s regime toppled, and as it became apparent that the justifying narratives for the invasion — the regime’s weapons of mass destruction — was proven to be hollow, the actual causes and motives remain intense questions for research. While the existing literature on Iraq invasion decision-making processes have tended to treat the decision as a policy fiasco (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, Smith 2008, Badie 2010), this essay will not focus on whether or not the decision to invade Iraq was a good or bad idea. Instead, it will show how certain circumstances and variables were at work in the lead-up to the invasion. This essay concludes the argument that bureaucratic politics and groupthink provide especially rigorous tools of looking at causes of the invasion.\n\nThis essay will proceed as follows: in the subsequent section, this essay will briefly conceptualize groupthink models and explain the justification for using these models in the study of Iraq invasion decision-making process. It will then apply a similar structure to explain the bureaucratic politics model. The decision-making episodes used in this essay are taken from the aftermath of the Gulf War to the War on Terror soon after the 9/11 to the eventual invasion of Iraq in March 2003. In the final part, this essay will consider the synthesis of the two models and discuss how each model symmetrically impacted each other making the inevitable decision to invade Iraq. The argument put forward in this essay is that groupthink and bureaucratic politics matter together in explaining why the US invade Iraq.\n\nGroupthink Model\n\nGroupthink is a term first coined by William Whyte (1952) to explain a phenomenon that plagues group decision making. Yet, it was only used as a comprehensive explanatory framework in foreign policy analysis when Irving Janis, an American psychologist, published Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign Policy Decisions and Fiascoes. In his book, Janis (1982) describes groupthink as ‘a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members’ striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action’. Put simply, groupthink is an in-group tendency to suppress dissenting opinions as an attempt to reach a consensus and minimize dispute. While groupthink has been effectively used to explain not only foreign policy mishaps, such as failure to anticipate Pearl Harbor attack and Bay of Pigs Invasion but also successes, such as Cuban Missile Crisis and Marshall Plan, it might not be as universally applicable (Janis 1972, Wekselberg 1997).\n\nThe decision to employ the assumptions of groupthink in investigating the US invasion of Iraq is based on a few considerations. Perhaps chief among these reasons is the ability of groupthink to uncover the ‘black boxes’ of small group decision-making processes. Arguably, unlike more regular issues, critical foreign-policy decisions are produced by small groups of officials at the top levels of government unit (Hermann and Hermann 1989, 263). Another reason to employ groupthink is Bush’s inexperience in foreign policy. To maintain his credibility, Bush deflected criticisms about his lack of expertise in foreign policy by emphasizing the notion that he surrounded himself with an eminent team of experts with years of service across various executive posts in previous administrations (Mann 2004, 1). This particularly compelled the president to depend all the more vigorously on his vice president and advisors, as opposed to other organizations and principals (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 279). This was especially enabled by the US national security decision-making structure that viably formalizes the critical role for the second-ranking bureaucrats as well as the president’s advisory system in the core element of an administration (Smith 2008, 100). For this reason, groupthink provides a more useful conceptual tool than ‘personality studies’, for instance, which only seek to link the president’s personalities with decision processes and outcomes, but do not account for the environmental context within which these processes operate (Hermann, et al. 2001).\n\nGroupthink: Iraq Invasion\n\nTo examine whether groupthink can be used properly explain the US invasion of Iraq, this essay would need to discover evidence in the information demonstrating the antecedents to groupthink, the symptoms, as well as the flawed sets of decision stemming from groupthink.\n\nAntecedents to groupthink\n\nThe presence of cohesive group is required in order for concurrence seeking to take place. As apparent in the case of Iraq, the involving policy process was led by a small, closely scrutinized group of Bush loyalists whose image, according to Mann, is best captured by the word ‘Vulcans’ (Mann 2004, Haney 2005). This cohesive group of policymakers includes Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, George Tenet and Bush himself. Although it was true that Iraq decision processes were also influenced by non-government participants and interests, they and Bush’s foreign-policy team together were tied by the same perception of US hegemony based on extensive military capabilities. And since outsider group/individuals like Iraqi National Congress and its leader Ahmed Chalabi as well as the former chairman of Defense Policy Board Richard Parle and then director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey all supported the regime change in Iraq (Haney 2005, 296), they only fueled the group cohesiveness and internalization. In short, Bush decision-making team was close-knit, shared similar beliefs, and most members actively engaged in defensive attitude in favour of President Bush.\n\nIn addition to the presence of a cohesive group, the calamities of 9/11 and the heightened levels of threats and stress devised a high-pressure decision-making situation. Bush administration was constrained to undertake an immediate response to the newly perceived terrorist threat. The need to secure the US territory from future associated with the threat posed by terrorists fixated the government to defend the US both internally and externally, thus justified the incorporation of Iraq into War on Terror. The same was true for Saddam Hussein. The threat of terrorism also solidified the group’s non-acceptance of Hussein’s regime, embedding the administration’s belief that Saddam was pro-terrorists and his possession of WMD might benefit Al-Qaeda. Admittedly, numerous individuals from Bush administration were determined to charge Hussein with 9/11 terror act, since there were basically “no good targets in Afghanistan” (Houghton 2008).\n\nSymptoms and flawed decision-making process of Groupthink\n\nWhile the psychological dimension of this reality cannot be straightforwardly examined, Janis (1982) maintains that groupthink generates a number of structural situations that can be observed. Among the most significant of these present in Bush administration are the illusion of invulnerability and discounting warnings and information. For the former condition, arguably, the US invasion of Iraq was driven by the unprecedented success in Afghanistan following the 9/11 attack (Woodward 2004). As the administration quickly defeated Taliban and Al-Qaeda, it started to feel that the similar result could be attained in Iraq. While for the latter, in spite of the available intelligence about the possibility of continuing political instability after the invasion and the general inefficacy of regime change that prominent figures, such as Powell, Tenet, and Armitage repeatedly conveyed (Feith 2008, Badie 2010), Bush and his ‘Vulcans’ dismissed this information and unquestionably believed that war with Iraq was inevitable.\n\nBureaucratic politics Model\n\nThe bureaucratic politics model can be traced back to the works of Allison (1971) and Halperin (1974). The model stipulates that government action in a given situation can be seen to a great extent as a product of negotiation among actors situated at lower levels in the bureaucracy (Allison and Halperin 1972). This is because lower-level bureaucrats are often in charge to make intelligence or to define the range of options available for their head-departments, and particularly within the context of the military, they capabilities that core policymakers have at hand (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 267). This model, however, is often criticized for largely ignoring the consequence of hierarchy within the bureaucracy and thus obscuring the significance of president as an ultimate decision-making body.\n\nIndeed, while Bush himself wanted a corporation with his decision-making team based on a clearly defined hierarchical order, his decision-making style prevented him from maintaining an orderly and hierarchically structured process (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, Haney 2005). Bush’s personal management style such as his way of settling policy dispute has been by described by some scholars as unstructured and haphazard (Mitchell 2005, Woodward 2002). Regardless, conflict and competition among advisors could happen both in highly centralized and loosely controlled advisory systems (Mitchell 2005, 187). Bureaucratic politics, therefore, remains a useful framework in identifying the decision processes and outcomes that resulted from the president’s choices of cabinet-level appointees (Bendor and Hammond 1992, Krasner 1972).\n\nBureaucratic Politics: Iraq Invasion\n\nThe conflict of policy preferences between department-heads was what informed the planning for the invasion. Notably, the architects of Bush foreign policy were carefully positioned people with a formed ideological pledge to getting rid of Saddam. These like-minded neoconservatives within Department of State and Vice President’s office including Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Feith and Bush himself, consistently advocated more aggressive foreign policy approach centered around the rationale of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) that includes the notion of regime change in Iraq as elsewhere in the Middle East (Badie 2010, 282). Dissenters of this notion were individuals within the State Department leadership, such as Rice, Powell, Armitage, Richard Haass and Anthony Zinni who pushed for what State Department is most capable of (multilateralism and diplomacy); arguing that harsh measures towards Iraq will lead to international antagonism and that the best way to deal with Hussein is through sanctions (Cahsman and Robinson 2007, Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 274). As the hawkish members of Bush administration were experienced politicians as well as officials who praised themselves for their long involvement in foreign affairs, they felt that they “were fully prepared to deal with security threats of the sorts they had confronted in the past” (Mann 2004, 293). Accordingly, the salience of Iraq questions was primarily guided by the ‘hawks’ determination to influence the policy process vis-à-vis the dissenters.\n\nWhen the case for war became thus a political agenda, particularly given the crisis situation after 9/11, the inter-department tension expended to include broader national security apparatus and intelligence notably The National Security Council (NSC) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). At this time, the ideological division between groups and members persisted: the moderates, on the one hand, demanded a United Nations (UN) resolution for inspection, and the hawkish, one the other hand, thought that cooperating with UN resolutions is worthless. To justify the Hawks’ convictions about Iraq, and at the same time, undermine the dissents, the president and his foreign-policy advisors consolidated control over military and intelligence communities (Hersh 2005). However, rather than being led by rationality, the involving bureaucratic process was highly driven by the ‘pulling and hauling’ among prominent individuals and groups within bureaucracies (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 273). Pentagon’s Office of Special Plans, for instance, was largely seen as “facilitators” of policy stemming from Bush and Cheney that aimed to garner public support of their preferred Iraq policy (Hersh 2005, Haney 2005). The result of this was the widespread grassroots opinion predominantly surrounded by the conviction that the regime’s leader would be quickly toppled and American troops are to be welcomed with flowers and chocolates (Haney 2005, 297). Iraq was eventually invaded in March 2003.\n\nGroupthink and Bureaucratic Politics: A symbiotic model\n\nAcademically, foreign policy decision-making (FPDM) explanations should be situated in each of the three levels of analysis, incorporating various models and approaches within FPA (Hudson 2007). This allows for the use of an eclectic approach to the study of FPDM. While analysis based on individual model only offer partial explanations, the eclectic approach tends to produce more rigorous and acceptable explanations of FPDM. Accordingly, this essay seeks to explain the US decision to invade Iraq using symbiotic, rather than individual, lens of groupthink and bureaucratic politics. To employ groupthink and bureaucratic politics simultaneously thus requires justifications.\n\nThe decision to employ these models together is predicated on the symbiotic nature of the two models. As small groups enmeshed in a network of organizational forces and environments (Hart, Stern and Sundelius 1997, 9), features that exist in groupthink fuels and strengthens features in bureaucratic politics. Also, present in bureaucratic politics are features that can trigger similar effects on groupthink. By treating groupthink and bureaucratic politics as a symbiotic model, one could ‘account for both the structural conditions and behavioural environment and ties them to the information processing errors’ (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 266). The US invasion of Iraq as explained in this essay is, therefore, a combined result of in-group and out-group decision-making processes.\n\nGroupthink: effects on bureaucratic politics\n\nThe in-group concurrence-seeking pattern has the ability to induce the bureaucratic infighting. The reason for this is that groupthink creates a permissive environment within which similarities becomes the norm. In the presence of a cohesive group, members always want to be seen loyal and pass group attention. They are also constrained to be more assertive when it comes to bargaining, and more often than not resort to corruptive strategies in order to satisfy their group imperatives (Kaarbo and Gruenfeld 1998). Moreover, since it is possible for advisers to place like-minded individuals close to action-channels as a part of advancing their group interests, as Garrison (1999) explains, it increases the likelihood for competition to take place in lower-levels of bureaucracy. The conflict inside the Bush administration resonated from superiors to subordinates, and particularly the second-ranking officials within each bureaucratic office. Present between Powell on one side and Cheney and Rumsfeld on the other were contradictions on policies including the handling of Guantanamo’s inmates; peace process in the Middle East; North Korea; and the approach to Iraq’ (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 273)\n\nAs for the Iraq question, the high-pressure atmosphere provided by 9/11 attack coupled with groupthink symptoms that plagued administration facilitated the president and his allies with sufficient power to define and articulate Iraq and Hussein threat perception. One way that this could happen was through the permeable political condition within which the president was at all times ready to act unilaterally and with relatively challenged authority (Haney 2005, 298). Also, as advocacy and rivalry became further socialized, Bush administration’s official conclusions about Iraq and Hussein could thus find a new sense of urgency within the wider security apparatus and intelligence community. This further led to more frequent information-processing errors in the bureaucracy. Thus, had it not been for the groupthink, it was difficult to imagine that conflicts within the bureaucracy would have taken place.\n\nBureaucratic politics: effects on groupthink\n\nOn the flip side, conflicts have consequence with increasing cohesion. The presence of bureaucratic politics could thus enhance groupthink symptoms in a small group of policymakers. As was evidenced in the case of Iraq, the president only began to get himself involved in closely with the issue when it became apparent that Iraq was the key part of a process of ‘pulling and hauling’ between officials and groups within the administration (Smith 2008, 103). Arguably, this was largely triggered by ‘hawkish’ members of the group who wanted to minimize the role of Powell and other dissenters in the policy process. As the president along with the majority members of the administration continued to put pressure on the dissenters, and since the dissenters feared alienation from the majority, alternative ideas became increasingly unlikely. The President himself personally asked Powell to conform. Bush told Powell, “I want you with me” and “Time to put your war uniform on” (Woodward 2002, 106). When the NSC frequently held “small group” meetings on Iraq after the 9/11, discussions that led a hypothetical presidential decision to invade Iraq were first directed around “if we attack Iraq,” then they quickly advanced to “when we went to war”(Tenet and Harlow 2007).\n\nFurthermore, while Newmann (2003) shows that the structure of policy-making and the administrative style changed over the period of an administration, they remained relatively intact in Bush’s first administration throughout his second term. Aside from then-Secretary of State Collin Powell, who was succeeded by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Bush’s administration continued to be led by like-minded neoconservative hawks including Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Wolfowitz (Gordon 2004, Badie 2010). Similarly, Bush administrative style, which defines the president’s approaches and objectives for foreign-policy making and the president’s convictions about what constitutes an ideal cooperation with advisers, seems to persist during his administration (Haney 2005, 291). Ultimately, this enduring policy-making structure and its accompanying behavioral consequences are what enhanced the features of groupthink in the policy process. For Mitchell and Massoud, ‘the development of in-groups and out-groups not only feeds inter-bureaucratic conflict and bargaining but is linked to intra-bureaucratic politics’ (Mitchell and Massoud 2009, 270).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as explained throughout this essay, it is clear that both groupthink and bureaucratic politics were at play in the decision process leading to the invasion of Iraq. In terms of groupthink, both its antecedents and symptoms were clearly demonstrated in the policy processes involved prior to the invasion. The planning and mainstreaming of war were systematically generated by a small group of like-minded, highly cohesive people with long-established convictions about Iraq and Hussein. The bureaucratic model, meanwhile, sheds light about the ability of group infighting to inform the decision-making process. Instead of being guided by rational processes, this model shows that decision processes were to a great extent driven by the ‘pulling and hauling’ between department leaders initially, and the broader administration eventually. In both models, the 9/11 political environment induces, rather than prevent, the defects of information-processing between the president and his advisory networks. For the political and practical reasons discussed above, groupthink and bureaucratic politics should be used side by side to explain the complex policy processes that cause the US to invade Iraq.\n\nBibliography\n\nAllison, G.
