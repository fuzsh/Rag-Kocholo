        "text": "From London to Baghdad\n\nMartin Wells, the ex-employee, told the Bureau he had no idea what he was getting into when he was interviewed for the Bell Pottinger job in May 2006.\n\nHe had been working as a freelance video editor and got a call from his agency suggesting he go to London for an interview for a potential new gig. “You’ll be doing new stuff that’ll be coming out of the Middle East,” he was told.\n\n“I thought ‘That sounds interesting’,” Wells recalled. “So I go along and go into this building, get escorted up to the sixth floor in a lift, come out and there’s guards up there. I thought what on earth is going on here? And it turns out it was a Navy post, basically. So from what I could work out it was a media intelligence gathering unit.”\n\nAfter a brief chat Wells asked when he would find out about the job, and was surprised by the response.\n\n“You’ve already got it,” he was told. “We’ve already done our background checks into you.”\n\nHe would be flying out on Monday, Wells learned. It was Friday afternoon. He asked where he would be going and got a surprising answer: Baghdad.\n\n“So I literally had 48 hours to gather everything I needed to live in a desert,” Wells said.\n\nDays later, Wells’s plane executed a corkscrew landing to avoid insurgent fire at Baghdad airport. He assumed he would be taken to somewhere in the Green Zone, from which coalition officials were administering Iraq. Instead he found himself in Camp Victory, a military base.\n\nIt turned out that the British PR firm which had hired him was working at the heart of a US military intelligence operation."
