        "text": "Guns, tanks, and bombs were the principal weapons of World War II, but there were other, more subtle forms of warfare as well. Words, posters, and films waged a constant battle for the hearts and minds of the American citizenry just as surely as military weapons engaged the enemy. Persuading the American public became a wartime industry, almost as important as the manufacturing of bullets and planes. The Government launched an aggressive propaganda campaign with clearly articulated goals and strategies to galvanize public support, and it recruited some of the nation's foremost intellectuals, artists, and filmmakers to wage the war on that front.\n\nPosters are the focus of this online exhibit, based on a more extensive exhibit that was presented in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, from May 1994 to February 1995. It explores the strategies of persuasion as evidenced in the form and content of World War II posters. Quotes from official manuals and public leaders articulate how the Government sought to rally public opinion in support of the war's aims; quotes from popular songs and sayings attest to the success of the campaign that helped to sustain the war effort throughout the world-shaking events of World War II.\n\nPart 1: Patriotic Pride\n\nPart 2: Staying Vigilant\n\nAdditional Media\n\nSong: \"Any Bonds Today?\"\n\nTranscript:\n\n\"Any bonds today?\n\nBonds of freedom\n\nThat's what I'm selling\n\nAny bonds today?\n\nScrape up the most you can\n\nHere comes the freedom man\n\nAsking you to buy a share of freedom today\n\nAny stamps today?\n\nWe'll be blest\n\nIf we all invest\n\nIn the U.S.A.\n\nHere comes the freedom man\n\nCan't make tomorrow's plan\n\nNot unless you buy a share of freedom today\"\n\nSpeech: President Roosevelt's Address\n\nTranscript: Excerpt from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Message to Congress on January 6, 1941\n\n\"The first is the freedom of speech and expression—everywhere in the world. The second is the freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want—which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants—everywhere in the world. The fourth is freedom from fear—which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor—anywhere in the world.\" (applause)\n\nVideo: Bugs Bunny\n\nVideo Description: Bugs Bunny enters stage right in front of a backdrop of Archibald McNeal Willard's painting, \"Spirit of '76\" showing three colonial soldiers with a fife, drum, and flag. Bugs wears a patriotic red and white striped top hat with a band of blue and white stars that he waves and tosses off stage left. Bugs sings \"Any Bonds Today?\", dances and throws blue papers printed with \"Bonds\" toward the audience. Elmer Fudd and Porky Pig, in Army and Navy uniforms, join Bugs onstage. The trio dances and sings in front of a backdrop showing a combat scene with ships and planes. As the song ends with a musical flourish, the cartoon fades to a gold background with a Minute Man on the left and the slogan \"For Defense Buy United States Savings Bonds and Stamps.\""
