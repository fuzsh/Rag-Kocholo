B. COFFIN, of the 128lh Regt. N. Y. S. V., now encamped near Carrollton, La., dated April 23d:\n\n\"I visited the Mechanic's Institute yesterday to see the wounded of the different Regiments who had been participants in the recent battles. I had first to procure a pass from the Medical Director, and was then admitted to the Hospital. It was a sad sight, I assure you. Here and there, scattered all over the room, lay young and intelligent-looking men upon beds, suffering from their wounds. Some were wounded in the arms, some in the body, others in the head, and several more bore the marks of Rebel liking on their hands and legs. I saw one young man belonging to the 159th N. Y. that was shot in the side, the ball passing through the body and then glancing upward, passed through the arm leaving the bone broken behind it. Among the wounded are several of my Hudson acquaintances, all of whom, (with but one exception,) are but slightly injured. This one was wounded in the side of the head by a piece of shell, and cannot long survive. It is only about three or four weeks ago that this same man was discharged from this (the Barracks) Hospital. Little did I think when I bade him good bye that I should look upon him in such a position as he is now. He recognized me and requested me to write to his cousin, who is a member of the 128th. The wounded all seemed to be in good spirits, and some were anxious to return to their Regiments. At the St. James' Hospital I found both of the Lieutenants of Co. D. 128lh—Doty and Armstrong —and a young Hudsonian with whom I was intimately acquainted. The two former left on account of disability, and the letter was among the wounded of the 159th. Well, leaving the Hospital and its heart-sickening scenes, I will look after our own regiment.\n\n\"The 128th left Camp Parapet on Saturday, and proceeded on an expedition to Pearl River. Col. COWLES was in command, and has rendered a good account of himself. They left Hickok's Landing at 2 o'clock and arrived at Fort Pike at sundown. The expedition then started for Mulatto Bayou, and arrived at a point about seven miles from its mouth at midnight. Here was landed the 128th and the 1st Vermont Battery. Here came the \"tug of war.\" Now that the troops were on shore, who was to pilot them to their destination? This was the question. Some contrabands were accordingly seized and ordered to show the way, but they informed the Colonel that the path was a very difficult one, and that they could scarcely find it in the day-time, much less at the dead of night. The Colonel was not to be out done, however, and so he drew his men up in line, and gave the order to march, and, wheeling about, embarked his command and returned to Fort Pike. From there he went up Pearl River to Napoleon, which place he reached about daybreak. Here he left a detachment of 250 men, under command of Capt. Gilford, Co. A, with orders to proceed to Gainesville by land, while he (the Colonel) with the remainder of the men proceeded up the river to the same place. Curious as it may seem the orders and plans were so minutely carried out, that at the very moment the Col. was landing his troops in front of the town, Capt. Gifford, with his command, entered the rear of the place. After forming this junction, small scouting parties were sent in various directions to look after produce, lumber, and boats, or whatever might be of value. Learning that a steamboat was lying about fifteen miles further up the river a party was sent to look her up and take possession. She was soon spied out,—although concealed by the bushes and trees along the river's bank,—and brought down to Gainesville. It was soon discovered that part of her machinery was among the missing and that without it the boat would be useless. The Colonel had a suspicion that the 'lost might be found,\" and laid his plans accordingly. First he searched for the owner's wife and, having found her, then searched the house, in which he found about $250 in gold, and a like amount in Confederate Scrip. The woman professed to know nothing about the missing machinery, or where it was placed; but upon the Colonel's informing her that he should retain the cash until the \"lost was found,\" she suddenly recollected something about their being hid away near the wharf. The missing machinery war soon found and the boat put in running order. So much for Yankee ingenuity. The steamer mentioned proved to be the A. G. Brown, a. swift going craft, about four years old. The captured money was returned to the owner's wife. While all this was going on, Capt. Hibbard, of the Vermont Battery, together with three officers and a private, discovered the schooner George Washington, which they captured and brought also to Gainesville. One of the other parties, overhauled three more schooners; but being unable to bring them away, burned them. A large number of mattresses were found and taken possession of. They were left by a section of rebel cavalry who, upon hearing of our advance, executed one of their stragetic [sic] movements—skedaddled. Besides the above mentioned property, the expedition captured 10 bales of cotton, 222 barrels of rosin, 108 barrels of tar, 1 metalic [sic] life-boat, and 21 cases of turpentine. The inhabitants are represented as having lots of money; but very little food, or clothing. Many of the whites, as well as the blacks, are suffering for the want of breadstuffs. The men had nearly all been forced ... few had fled to the swamps, and were there being hunted by rebel cavalry. Great credit is given to the 128th for their good behavior. The Colonel speaks very highly of both officers and men, and says they were active and vigilant. Capts. BOSTWICK and PARKER, and Lieutenant SINERBOX took a conspicuous part in the expedition, and they are particularly mentioned as having done their duty nobly. Who said the 128th was never going to do anything toward winding up the big clock—rebellion? Not a man was lost on our side, nor a gun fired. The expedition was a perfect success; and you may expect to hear of similar ones before long. The regiment returned to Camp Parapet yesterday—having been gone five days—in good spirits, and ready for another excursion of the same sort.\n\n\"The 159th lost in their recent encounter with the Rebels 160, killed, wounded and missing. The Regiment now musters but 300 men fit for duty, at least I am told so by a member of it.\n\n\"We have more good news from this Department to-day. Gen. Banks has taken Alexandria, La., and is still pressing upon the rebels with fair chances of driving them to Vicksburgh [sic], where he intends, no doubt, to bag the whole lot. In addition to this we have a report that six of our gunboats ran by Vicksburgh [sic] on the night of the 16th and that the bombardment of the place had commenced.\"\n\nTHE 128TH REGIMENT.—We are permitted to make the following extract, which will interest many readers, from a letter written by an officer of the 128th Regiment, under date of Saturday, June 20.\n\nThere was quite a heavy fight at Port Hudson last Sunday. Our Regiment was deployed as skirmishers on the extreme left, and our loss was one killed and 19 wounded. The wounded in my company are Henry Morris, who had the tip of his elbow taken off with a ball; Andy Silvernail, slightly wounded; Andrew Jackson, shot in the arm; George H. Fitchett, wounded in the arm. The wounds are all reported \"slight,\" so shall expect my men (I can't call them \"boys\" after going through two such fights) to be as well as ever in a few days. Sergt. Light is sick; Sergt. Nesbitt is wagon master, and Sergt. Cannon is Lieut. in one of the colored regiments. I am getting well fast, and the Docotr says that in two weeks I shall be able to do duty,—that is light duty; but I am anxious to be at Port Hudson when the final assault is made, and so shall not wait two weeks before I return.\n\nThe 128th Regiment.\n\nThe Brigade of which this regiment is a part has been ordered from Donaldsonville, and have received orders to take post at Baton Rouge, which is a much more agreeable and healthy location.\n\n128th Regiment.\n\nCapt. R. J. Mitchell will leave for New Orleans to rejoin his Regt. (the 128th) early next week. Letters or packages to be forwarded by him, must be left at the residence of A. C. Mitchell, Esq., Allen street, by noon on Saturday next.\n\nThe 128th Regiment.—We are gratified to learn that James Smith, Esq., of our city, has been promoted to be Colonel of the 128th Regiment. On the breaking out of the war Col. Smith, then a Lieutenant in the famous \"Ellsworth Grey\" corps raised a company and entered service as a Captain of Company A, 20th Regiment. In this capacity he served until the organization of the 128th Regiment, when he was offered and accepted the Lieutenant Colonelcy. So faithfully did he discharge his duties in this position that now upon the death of Col. Cowles, we find our friend Smith in command of as fine a Regiment as ever met the enemy. His hosts of friends were will rejoice with us at the well-merited advancement of a Poughkeepsian.\n\nCol. Smith reports, under date of the 18th of June, the following names of men belonging to his Regiment, who were wounded in the action of June 14:\n\nKilled.—Private Robert P. Churchill, Company C.\n\nWounded.—Capt. G. W. Van Slyck, Company E, (now on duty); Lieut. John P. Williamson, Acting Adjutant; Private Alexander Shaw, Co. A; Martin Cody, Co. A; H. W. Morris, Jr., Co. D; Andrew Jackson, Co. D; Andrew J. Silvernail, Co. D; George H. Fitchett, Co, D; Sergt. ____ Thompson, Co. E; Private W. R. Showerman, Co. E; Sergt. Daniel Warren, Co. F; Private C. McManamy, Co. G; Private Wm. Spreadbury, Co. H; Private Wm. Brundage, Co. H; Sergt. Richard Enoch, Co. L; Corp. J. H. Miller, Co. K; Private Allen Sheldon, Co. K; John Haskel, Co. K; Daniel Westley, Co. _; _. _. Miller, Co. K.\n\nDeath of Capt. Edward Gifford.\n\nBy the return of his brother James, intelligence was received last week of the death, at New Orleans on the 10th inst., of Capt. EDWARD GIFFORD, CO. A, 128th Regiment. He fell a victim to the typhoid fever, which is making such fearful havoc in the ranks of our northern soldiers.\n\nCapt. Gifford was a brave and capable officer and had already distinguished himself in the military operations against Port Hudson. His death is a severe loss to the Regiment, and will long be mourned by his many friends in this city. The remains will be brought home at some future time for interment.\n\nSoldiers of Ohio, in Rosecrans; army, are denouncing the nomination of Vallandigham with the greatest vehemence. A number of regiments have already adopted and sent home resolutions on the subject which will by no means add to the comfort of Vallandigham's supporters.\n\nNOT DEAD.—The Warren Mail says that Lieut. FRED. WILKINSON whom we mentioned a short time since as among the killed at Port Hudson is alive and well. He will have as good a chance to learn what folks intended to say about him after he was gone as did Lieut. (now Capt.) Sam. BAILEY after the battle of Williamsburg. We have often wondered if the flattering obituary ...\n\nONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHTH REGT. N. Y.

It is at a point where a bend forms almost a right angle, thus completely commanding the river both ways. On the north, for a distance of eight miles, it is protected by an impassable swamp, which is bounded on the side nearest Port Hudson by Thompson's Creek, the bank of which is a precipitous bluff, crowned by an entrenched abattis. This abattis extends from the river eastward till it joins a series of entrenchments nine or ten miles in extent, sweeping to the south in a semi-circle till they rest upon the river on a crest of a range of high hills. This was the position carried by Gen. Weitzel. The country in the rear is rolling, and possesses many natural advantages in favor of the enemy. Between Baton Rouge and port Hudson is a long stretch of territory difficult of access at all times, being covered by dense woods and undergrowth, and abounding in bayous and marshes. The place, both by nature and art, is unquestionably one of great strength.\n\nThe water defences of Port Hudson are said to consist of eight batteries, numbering between twenty and thirty guns. One of these batteries is stationed on a bluff eighty feet high. Another is planted just below the mouth of Thompson's creek. The most of the guns are 24s, 32s and 42s, but there are one or two 120-pounders. The land defences were chiefly built after the advance of the Federal forces to Baton Rouge. They mount in all some thirty or forty guns, some of them of heavy calibre, and in addition to these there are at least four field batteries which can be readily moved to any part of the works. The position seems to be entirely inclosed in a series of fortifications of the most elaborate and formidanle character. The probability is that the exterior intrenchments include others, as was found to be the case at Vicksburg. Indeed, the general plan of the defences at Port Hudson appears to be the same as at the point just mentioned, the only deviations being such as required by the variations in the surface of the country.\n\nPort Hudson district is commanded by Maj. Gen. Franklin Gardiner, a veteran soldier and an able officer, who was assigned to duty there on the 27th of December last.\n\nThe troops of the post were under command of Gen. Beal.\n\nA deserter from the Rebel army furnishes a statement of the defences of Port Hudson from which we condense the following:\n\nIn November last Beal's brigade was ordered to move with all haste to Port Hudson. There were not many troops there then, and the force now in it was hurriedly concentrated there. The troops, soon after their arrival, were put to constructing the works, and unceasing activity was rigidly enforced. In a short time the works began to assume a regularity and a strength which evinced their purpose and the use to which they would ere long be put. The more outer works consist of intrenched abattis, extending in the form of a semi-circle for some nine or ten miles. The outer entrenchments bristle with cannon of heavy calibre, which sweep all the approaches. Some forty siege guns, besides lighter field batteries, are in position here, together with two 120-pounders. Great reliance is placed on the strength of these works; but there are interior lines of defence upon which the Rebels can rally in case of being driven back.\n\nThese works are not of a continuous character, like the semi-circle of outer works, but are detached, erected on positions favorable to the Rebels in case they were compelled to fall back and abandon their outer defences. Heavy siege guns are planted on these fortifications. Between these works and the town itself are several swamps and thick undergrowth, adding considerably to the strength of the place. The water defences consist of ten batteries numbering between thirty and forty guns, some of them being 11-inch and others 12-inch bore. One of these batteries is stationed on a bluff eighty feet high. Another battery, the most westerly of the water defences, is situated below the mouth of Thompson's creek. There is also a mortar battery, intended for throwing hot shell. The guns generally, are 32s and 42s. These batteries were erected early in the war, but the land defences were principally built after the advance of the Union forces to Baton Rouge.\n\nLATEST WAR NEWS.\n\nDESPERATE BATTLE AT PORT HUDSON.—On the 27th of May a severe engagement took place at Port Hudson. Our line of investment was as follows:—The extreme right of Banks' force was commanded by Gen. Weitzel, with his own and the division of Gen. Emeroy; the right center by Gen. Grover; the left center by Gen. Auger, and the extreme left by Gen. T. W. Sherman—the artillery brigade, being under command of Gen. Arnold.\n\nThe Second Division, Gen. Sherman fought great determination and bravery, and the Sixth Michigan and One Hundred and Twenty-eighth New York, with the Second Louisiana (colored) regiments, actually carried the rebel works in their front by brilliant bayonet charge. Their supports, however, failed to come up in time and they were ultimately obliged to fall back before overwhelming numbers. This charge cost us heavily in killed and wounded, for the Sixth Michigan, and One Hundred and Twenty-eighth New York each lost about half their effective strength, while the negro regiment, which, all accounts agree, fought with wonderful coolness and gallantry, suffered in killed, and wounded, and missing, to the number of 600. Gen. Sherman led this attack in person, and fell, severely wounded in the leg. Gen. Neal Dow was also wounded. Col. Clarke, of the Sixth Michigan, was killed. Col. Cowles, of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth New York, was also killed by a bayonet thrust; and Lieut.-Col. Smith, of the Zouaves, was severely wounded.\n\nIn the center the assault was pushed by Gens. Auger and Grover with the greatest determination. The rebels, were slowly but surely forced back from their rifle pits and intrenchments into the main works.\n\nOn the right line, however, Gen. Weitzel achieved a decided success. His division by a determined charge carried the famous six-gun battery which sunk the sloop-of-war Mississippi when Admiral Farragut's fleet ran the gaunlet [sic] of the rebel works several weeks since. This important position, which completely commanded the channel way of the river, was held by Gen. Weitzel, and the heavy pieces mounted there were at once turned upon their former owners.\n\nOur entire loss in the day's engagement was estimated at about 3,000, killed, wounded and missing.\n\nAmong the killed we notice that the 128th suffered the loss of Col. D. S. COWLES, Capt. A. DERWINT, Lieut. J. ARMSTONG, Lieut. F. WILKERSON, and Serg. C. VAN HYCK. Capt. E. GIFFORD, of Hudson, is reported as missing—either killed or taken prisoner.\n\nList of Killed and Wounded Men of the 128th Reg't, N. Y.

A letter written by him June 1st, has been received by James Mackin Esq., of Fishkill. In this letter he says Col. Cowles was shot. He also says \"our right, and the Michigan 6th did well, but the less said about the others the better.\" He gives the names of the following from Fishkill who were killed and wounded:\n\nKolled—John W. Hughes.\n\nWounded.—George Deacon, Mattewan; James Green, Mattewan; Corporal Lewis Pearsall, Mattewan; Sergeant Garrett F. Dillon, Carthage Landing; George H. Pollock, Wappinger's Falls; ____ Partington, ____ Jeffards.\n\nThe skeleton regiments of Col. Coles, Columbia county, and Col. Fredenhall, of Albany, have been consolidated under Col. Coles. The combined regiment now numbers 650 men.\n\nTHE LAMENTED COL. COWLES—The remains of Col. Cowles arrived in this city per steamer Oregon yesterday morning, in charge of the committee from this city appointed for that purpose. They were conveyed immediately to the City Hall, where they remained in state until half-past 2 p. m. to-day, when they were to be removed to the Presbyterian church.\n\nThe condition of the remains were such that it was found to be impracticable to open the coffin, either in New York or on its arrival here, which was a very great disappointment to no only his relatives, but also his many friends in this city and county.\n\nThe city is thronged with people as we go to press, and places of business closed in accordance with recommendation of Mayor.\n\nWe shall give a full report of proceedings of the day in to-morrow's paper.\n\nLOSS OF THE 128TH REGIMENT.—Colonel James Smith, of this regiment, writes from New Orleans under date of May 31st that the loss of the 128th regiment was in killed, wounded and missing not to exceed eighty, as far as he could learn that Col. Cowles was the only officer killed, and Capt. Gifford is now a prisoner at Port Hudson.\n\nFrom the 128th Regiment.\n\nThe Late Fight at Port Hudson.\n\nHow the Regiment Fared.\n\nSt. James Hospital, New Orleans,\n\nMay 29, 1863—10 o'clock A. M.\n\nEditors of the Eagle:—I have just returned from the performance of a sad duty, which was the preparation of the body of our late beloved Colonel for the purpose of sending it home, as we hope to do so by the steamer Columbia this morning. Colonel Cowles was killed at Port Hudson on Wednesday, the 27th inst., while leading his regiment in a charge on the main batteries of the enemy. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon that Gen. Dow's brigade was ordered to storm the works, and gallantly did the 128th New York and the 6th Michigan advance amid one of the most terrific showers of grape and shell that could be imagined. But they walked up in the face of it all, and scaling the parapet carried the works, driving the rebels from their guns. But unfortunately the other regiments of the brigade faltered (15th N. H. and 26th Conn.,) and failed to come to their support, consequently our men, with those of the 6th Michigan, were obliged to retire, and allow the rebels to retake their guns, and when the messenger left, the fighting was still going on, the rebels having come but of the intrenchments.\n\nIt was at the time that the regiments mounted the parapet that the Colonel received his wound, which was that of a bayonet in the left groin just below the pubic bone. The femoral vein was severed, resulting in fatal hemorrhage. He lived about an hour. He refused to be taken from the field, preferring to remain and die there. Almost his last words were \"tell my brother that I died with my face to the foe.” To say that we greatly mourn his loss, but feebly express our feelings, for we dearly loved him. I learn that the loss of the 128th in killed was 40 to 50, while the number of wounded is of course much greater. Capt. De Wint, Co. F, was wounded, and Capt. Gifford, Co. A, missing, supposed to be killed; Lieut. Armstrong, commanding Co. D, (Capt. Parker being sick at this hospital,) was also killed; Sergeant Merritt of Co. I, was killed. The names of the others of the Po’keepsie Companies killed, I have as yet been unable to obtain. I was not on the field, having been left at the camp in charge of the sick and convalescent there. The body of the Colonel was brought to this city yesterday afternoon.\n\nNobly has the 128th N. Y. Regiment sustained the honor of Dutchess and Columbia in this affair. For certainly there is no record of any act of the war more gallant or daring than this of the 128th New York and the 6th Michigan.\n\nFurther particulars will perhaps have to be deferred until the sailing of another steamer. Respectfully, &c.,\n\nC. H. ANDRUS,\n\n1st Ass't. Surgeon 128th N. Y. V.\n\nCol. Cowles.--Among the killed at the battle of Port Hudson, the particulars of which will be found elsewhere, was Col. Cowles, of the 128th Regiment. N. Y. S. V. Col. C. was originally attached to the 61st Regiment, but when the companies raised in Columbia county were consolidated with those raised here, Col. Van Zandt was appointed to the command of the Regiment, and Col. Cowles subsequently raised the 128th Regiment, which he commanded at the time of his death. He was among the most gallant of the gallant men who left our State to fight the battles of the Union. Brave as a lion; a man of culture and scholarly attainments; a gentleman in the fullest sense of the word; endowed with social qualities that made him a general favorite—his death will be deeply lamented in the community of which he has long been an ornament. He died as he lived, full of heroic ardor. His last words were—\"Tell my mother that I died with my face towards the enemy. Boys, I have tried to do my duty, as a soldier and a man.\" Col. Cowles resided at Hudson, and was a lawyer by profession.\n\nAmong the many who enlisted in the 128th Regiment was a man by the name of Uriah Albertson who belonged to Co. D, Capt. Parker. Mr. Albertson it can be truly said joined the regiment and went forth to fight for his country out of pure patriotism. Shortly after his arrival at New Orleans he was taken sick with chronic diarrhoea and his disconsolate widow this week received the news of his death. He died on the 3d of June and leaves a wife and two or three children to mourn his loss. Peace to his ashes.\n\nCol. DANIEL S. COWLES, reported killed in the assault on the works at Port Hudson, was a native of Canaan, Litchfield Co., Connecticut, and about forty years of age. He has lately been a resident of the City of Hudson, Columbia County, in this State, where he has hold some of the highest positions in the gift of the people, and always performed his duties with the highest degree of honor and success. Col. Cowles raised the regiment which he commanded—the 128th—by his own individual exertions. It is composed of the flower of Columbia and Dutchess Counties. The last words of Col. Cowles were, \"Tell my mother I died with my face to the enemy.\"\n\nSeargeant [sic] Bell, of the 128th Regiment N. Y. V., leaves for New Orleans on Thursday, the 2d of July next, and will be happy to take charge of articles and packages for the members of the 128th and 159th Regiments. Packages left at the Post Office, prior to Thursday 10 A. M., will be forwarded by him.\n\nThe Late Col. Cowles, 128th N. Y. Volunteers.—The loss of this brave officer who was killed while leading his men against the Rebel works at Port Hudson, is mourned by all who knew him. Lieut. Col. Smith has issued an appropriate order relative to the death of the soldier, and a series of resolutions have been adopted by the officers of the regiment, one of which reads as follows:—\n\nResolved, That in the private character, and the professional and military career of Col. Cowles, we recognize all the virtues, the ability, and every element of a pure, talented and brave character; the devotedness of his\n\nRevolutionary forefathers was repeated in his career, in a cause not less sacred; that as in life he exemplified the principles and energy which should animate the patriot soldier, so in the gallantry which distinguished his fall he taught us how to die. In death and life, without fear and without reproach.\n\nCol. Cowles was a resident of the city of Hudson, New. York.\n\nArmy Correspondence.\n\nHeadquarters 128th Regiment, N. Y. S. V.\n\nIn Field near Port Hudson.\n\nJune 1st, 1863.\n\nA. N. Werb, Editor Star—Dear Sir: Our Regiment was among those who so bravely assaulted the enemy's works on the 27th of May, and suffered severely in the engagement. As it is of great interest to all the friends of the regiment, I send you a list of the killed and wounded for publication.\n\nThe character of the wounds were in many instances very severe, and many have since died; but their names I cannot give at present, as the wounded, after having their wounds dressed, were immediately forwarded to the large Military Hospitals at Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\n\nColonel Cowles fell on the battle-field bravely leading his men in the thickest of the fire; as calm and collected as if on dress parade. His undaunted bravery and noble bearing was remarked by all who saw him on that bloody field. He fell—lamented by all who were so happy as to know him while living.\n\nI remain, Respectfully,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPALMER C. COLE,\n\nSurgeon 128th Regiment N. Y. S.

V. that was recruited in Columbia and Dutchess counties, and who was killed a few days since, while leading his brave men in the siege at Port Hudson, took place at Hudson on Monday last, of which city he had for a number of years been a resident. A large number of people from different points on the Hudson river, were present at the obsequies. The military, foremen, and Masonic fraternity, of which deceased was a member, turned out on the occasion. A goodly number of the brethren belonging to Rondout and Kingston Lodges were in attendance, and occupied respective positions in the procession.—The ceremonies at the church were very solemn and impressive, a very able discourse being preached on the occasion.— Col. Cowles was a native of Caanan, Litchfield, Conn., and was in the 47th year of his age.\n\nTHE SERGEANT in the 128th Regiment, who had both legs shot away at the knees, in the battle of Port Hudson, and continued to fire at the enemy until he received a fatal wound, was Orderly Sergeant Chas. L. Van Slyck, of Co. E, and a citizen of Kinderhook.\n\nWe are permitted, through the kindness of Mr. James Mackin, to publish a private letter received by him from Capt. Arthur DeWint. It gives interesting particulars, which all our readers will be glad to learn. For the convenience of our readers, we give below the names of all those from this vicinity who were killed or wounded in the late battle at Port Hudson, as far as heard from:\n\nKILLED.\n\nJohn W. Hughes, son of Wm. Hughes, of this village.\n\nWOUNDED.\n\nGeo. Deacon, Matteawan.\n\nJames Green, Matteawan.\n\nCorporal Lewis Pearsall, Matteawan.\n\nSergeant Garrett, F.

SPAIGHT, Editor.\n\nFishkill Landing, June 11, 1863.\n\nTHE STANDARD HAVING A LARGE AND INCREASING CIRCULATION, ADVERTISERS WILL CONSULT THEIR INTERESTS BY HAVING THEIR ANNOUNCEMENTS APPEAR IN ITS COLUMNS.\n\nThe Battle at Port Hudson.\n\nTHE 128TH NEW YORK SUFFER SEVERELY.\n\nThe sad intelligence which reached us on Saturday from Port Hudson, forshadowing [sic] more terrible news to come, cast a gloom of sadness over the entire community. The reported death of Col. Cowlos, Captain Arthur DeWint, and other officers from this vicinity, with the simple announcement that the entire loss in this regiment would reach as high as two hundred, placed hundreds of weeping relatives and friends in anxious suspense for details.—Later intelligence must have a twofold effect. Upon some the gloom of sadness will deepen as they hear of dear ones, who have fallen in the fierce struggle; while others, who have been tortured by suspense, will have all their fears suddenly driven away, as they learn of the safety of those whom they feared were among the victims.\n\nBelow we give a list of those in the 128th, who were reported killed or wounded, in the New York Tribune of Saturday last, with such corrections as we are enabled to make by referring for names to a list of the entire regiment in our possession:\n\nCol. David S. Cowles, Hudson, killed.\n\nCapt. Edward Gifford, Hudson, missing.\n\nLieut. J. Armstrong, killed. We do not find such an officer on the list. There is, however, a Second Sergeant, Jacob Armstrong, of Hyde Park, who is probably the person named.\n\nLieut. Frederick Wilkinson Poughkeepsie, killed.\n\nOrderly Sergeant, Charles L. Van Slyck, Kinderhook, killed\n\nThe following account of the battle is furnished by a special correspondent of the N. Y. Tribune.\n\nNew Orleans, May 29, 1863.\n\nWe have had a desperate struggle at Port Hudson, the result of which is at present unknown. Since Friday, May 22, a continuous bombardment has been maintained by Admiral Farragut's fleet, and the 1st Vermont Battery, Capt. Kibbard, has annoyed the batteries during the day.\n\nAt 1 p. m., on Wednesday, the battle commenced. The lines extended for a distance of nearly four miles in front of the enemy's works. The extreme right was given to Gen. Wertzel, Gen. Grover occupying the next position, Gen. Augur the third, and Gen. Sherman the left.\n\nOn the left, the 165th New York, Lieut. Col. Abel Smith, were ordered to discharge their muskets and charge upon the enemy's ranks.\n\nGen. Sherman intended to carry a section of the fortifications at the point of the bayonet. The 2d Duryee Zouaves, and the 177th New York made a desperate onset, and were met by a rainstorm of bullets. Lieut. Col. Smith, of the former regiment was severely wounded. Finding it impossible to successfully accomplish the daring purpose, a retreat was effected. Col. Clark of the 6th Michigan, carried the colors of his regiment inside the first line of fortifications, and raised them upon the Rebel flagstaff. The 128th New York, Col. Cowles, immediately followed, and were within the walls of the earthwork, when both regiments were forced to retire on account of a lack of support by the 15th New Hampshire. Col. Cowles was killed.\n\nCol. Clark was so terribly stunned by a shell while retreating, that he remained senseless for an hour. He escaped uninjured and was conspicuous for bravery and enthusiasm. Gen. Neal Dow was slightly wounded, and Gen. Sherman rallied and took charge of Dow's brigade, when he received a compound fracture of the right leg from a grape shot. Gen. Sherman's conduct is highly applauded.\n\nThe 3d Regiment Louisiana Native Guards, Col. Nelson, attracted great attention for their undaunted bravery. They sustained a loss of nearly 600 men. Their bearing upon this occasion has forever settled in this Department all question as to the employment of negro troops. Nearly every officer was killed.\n\nAfter the death of Col. Cowles, the command of the 128th New York devolved upon Captain Gifford, who was almost immediately wounded. Capt. Keese, a mere youth, then assumed the duties of Colonel. His voice could be heard above the roar of artillery, urging forward his men. He displayed the bravery of a lion.\n\nThe struggle lasted until 5 p. m., when a general order was dispatched along the lined to retreat to the original position occupied at the commencement of the action.\n\nThe propeller Ida arrived here last evening from Baton Rouge. Gens. Sherman and Dow were brought down upon stretchers. The body of Col. D. S. Cowles was on board. From S. Bryant of the 128th New York, I learn that at _ a. m. yesterday, heavy cannonading could be heard at Port Hudson. Our loss is reported to be at least 4,000. I am informed that the Rebels could not have had over 10,000 men. The fight was without doubt renewed at daybreak yesterday. The most perfect confidence was felt that the Rebel stronghold would succumb to the Union forces.\n\nAn expedition composed of eight regiments, under command of Colonels Chickering of the 41st Massachusetts, and Morgan of the 90th New York, arrived last evening at Algiers, having marched thither from Franklin. These troops will be immediately sent to the relief of Gen. Banks at Port Hudson.\n\nUpon receipt of the news of the death of Col. Cowles, Lieut.-Col. Smith of the 128th New York, who is on New Orleans on detailed duty, without awaiting a relief from detail, rejoined his regiment. The loss in this command is at least 200.\n\nLieut. Clark of the 6th Michigan, led his company with his right arm dangling at his side.\n\nSergeant Charles L. Van Slyck of the 128th New York, had both legs shot away at the knee. He continued to fire at the enemy until he received a fatal wound in the breast. The last words of Col. Cowles were, \"Tell my mother I died with my face to the enemy. Boys, Have I not done my duty as a man and a soldier.\"\n\nThe Captain Keese spoken of above is Captain Francis S. Keese, son of John M. Keese, of Rhinebeck, well known throughout this county.\n\nCol. David S. Cowles, killed in the assault on the works at Port Hudson, was a native of Canaan, Litchfield Co., Connecticut, and about forty years of age. He has lately been a resident of Hudson, Columbia County, in this State, where he has held some of the highest positions in the gift of the people, and always performed his duties with the highest degree of honor and success. Col. Cowles raised the regiment which he commanded—the 128th—by his own individual exertions. It is composed of the flower of Co1umbia and Dutchess Counties.\n\nCOLONEL COWLES.—A corresspondent [sic] of the Daily Press writing from New Orleans says: I viewed this evening the dead body of Colonel Cowles, of the 128th regiment New York Volunteers, which arrived here this afternoon from Baton Rouge. He was one of the finest looking men I have ever seen, a perfect model of manly beauty. He was killed yesterday afternoon, about two o'clock, by a thrust from a sword bayonet in the left thigh, which divided one of the larger veins. The main artery was not touched. He lived about an hour after the wound was received, and his last words were, \"Tell my good old mother that I died doing my duty and with my face to the enemy.\" Colonel Cowles was a man universally beloved and respected. He was idolized by his regiment, and to them his loss will be irreparable. His body is being embalmed. He was a bachelor of wealth, and a resident of Hudson.\n\nArmy Correspondence of the GAZETTE.\n\nFrom the 128th Regiment.\n\nCAMP PARAPET, La., April 27th, 1863.\n\nMr. EDITOR:—As I know that every movement made by the 128th will be of interest to the readers of the Gazette, I send you an account of an expedition we have lately been on, up in the heart of Dixie.\n\nWe left camp at 8 o'clock a. m., on the 18th inst., according to the orders and instructions of Gen. Sherman, commanding the defences of New Orleans, and marched eight miles to Lake Pontchartrain, where there were two steamboats, (the J. M. Brown and Empire Parish,) ready to take them to Rebeldom. We, with the 1st Vermont Battery, under the command of Capt. Hibbard, embarked, and at 4 p. m. landed at Fort Pike. At 11 p. m. the J. W. Brown, with the left wing of the Regt., comprising companies B., G., K., E., and H. started, and at 1 a. m. landed in Mulatto Bayou, about eight miles from its mouth. At daylight a detachment of twenty men from each company, marched up the country about six miles where we had been informed three schooners were concealed in one of the narrow bayous. As the schooners could not be brought down, because of the shallow water, we burned them and returned to Fort Pike, and after transferring Co's B. and G. to the Parish, both boats started on the grand expedition, Col. Cowles in command of the Brown and Capt. Gifford, of Co. A., in command of the Parish.\n\nAt daylight of the 20th we landed at Poleon, seven miles below Gainsville, Miss., on the Pearl River. From thence two hundred and fifty men under the command of Capt. Gifford, marched up to Gainsville. Lieut. Langdon, of Company K., commanding the advance guard.\n\nThis movement was so well planned that the land force entered the rear of the town at the exact time that boats landed in front. While the Parish was being loaded with cotton, tar and other valuable in the store houses at the wharf, the Brown, under the command of Lieut. Burns, Co. K., proceeded up the river about two miles, where, the contrabands had informed us, some resin was hidden in the swamp; and after loading the resin, returned to Gainsville. At the same time, Col. Cowles being informed that a steamboat had been hidden about 12 or 15 miles farther up the river, to keep her out of the hands of the \"Yankees,\" sent a party under the command of Capt. Parker, to bring her down. As the throttle valves and some other indispensable parts of her machinery had been taken out, the only way was to float her down, and after twelve hours hard work, they brought her safely into Gainesville, and by some means Col. Cowles found out from the owner of the boat, (who was a prisoner in our hands,) where the missing parts of the machinery were hidden, and after a few hours work the engineers had steam up, and we all proceeded down the river. On the way down the Parish discovered the schooner George Washington in one of the bayous, and took her in tow. At dark on the 22d, we were all back in our old Camp; every man in good spirits over the success of our expedition, and all anxious to try again.\n\nWhile we were in Dixie we lived on the fat of the land—chickens, turkeys, pigs, honey, etc.\n\nThe fruits of the expedition were 222 pounds of resin, 108 barrels of tar, 10 bales of cotton, 21 cases of turpentine, 1 steamboat, 1 metalic [sic] lifeboat, the schooner George Washington, and a large lot of valuable lumber.\n\nThe country we passed through is low and swampy; very little of it cultivated, and very thinly populated. The inhabitants are, many of them, in the greatest want. Most of the men have been drafted into the Confederate army, and their families are suffering for the necessaries of life. To some Col. Cowles gave beef and \"hard tack,\" and although we went there as enemies, we left a good impression behind us of the \"Yankees,\" as they called us. New Orleans money, Confederate bonds, and gold and silver were plenty among the richer ones, and with some of the contrabands; but gold cannot buy everything they need. I asked one man why he did not fix his fence; he replied that he could not afford it—nails were worth ten cents apiece there.\n\nTo the perseverance, energy and well laid plans of Col. Cowles, are to be attributed the safe and successful termination of our expedition.\n\nM. D. W.\n\nLetter from Capt. Arthur DeWint.\n\nST. JAMES HOSPITAL,\n\nNEW ORLEANS, JUNE 1ST, 1863.\n\nDEAR JIM: I hardly expected to reply to your letter from a hospital, and with a bullet hole in my arm, but I imagine my letter will prove none the less acceptable on that account. I am doing well, and hope to be with my regiment in a fortnight. We had just returned from an expedition\n\nto Ponchatoula (where we were disappointed in not having a fight) on the 21st ultimo, when we received orders to go to Baton Rouge. Hurrah! was the word along the line when the order was read, for we all knew Port Hudson was to be our destination. At 4 o'clock on the morning of the 22d, the four regiments, 6th Michigan, 15th New Hampshire (nine months regiments), 26th Connecticut, 128th New York, left Carrolton in steamers, and headed for Springfield Landing, the nearest approach that can be made by water to Port Hudson just at present. We disembarked about noon the next day, and took up the line of march towards the enemy, who were doubtless well aware of our approach, and awaiting our coming behind the breastworks and rifle pits, with which they are complete encircled. The men were in \"light marching\" order, many without blankets, and the sun was so excessively hot, right glad were they at being thus equipped. We had marched but a few miles, however, when from an inky black cloud the rain poured down in torrents upon us, but on we moved at \"secured arms,\" and halted upon a broad plain, where with our feet to the camp-fires, we passed quite a comfortable night, the rain having ceased after having cooled the air most desirably and wet us to the skin most thoroughly.\n\nI will now skip a few days until Monday, the 25th inst., and tell you of Co. F's doings only. We were then within two miles of the enemy's first line of defences. At one o'clock p. m., we were ordered out on picket, one mile to the front. Our picket line joined Gen. Auger's on the right, and Gen. Nickerson's on the left.—At 11 o'clock p. m., two guns of the Indiana battery were sent forward to the picket line, and commenced shelling the enemy. It was not long before a reply was elicited, and until sunrise the next morning, the woods were riddled with shell and balls, keeping Co. F's boys (who were rather unused to such sights and sounds) constantly dodging between trees and logs; they were consequently thoroughly tired out when relieved by a Co. of the 15th New Hampshire at 3 o'clock p. m., of the 26th inst.\n\nOn reporting with my company to Col. Cowles, I was ordered to go on picket that night nearer the enemy. The men had hardly time to eat their suppers when word came to \"fall in,\" We marched to the rear of a burning building, directly opposite to, and about three quarters of a mile distant from the most awful of the enemy's batteries. At 2 o'clock a. m., we were relieved by Co. C of ours, and fell back to where the regiment were lying on their arms, and I assure you every man of us was soon wrapped in deep slumber, naught but the pacing to and fro of the sentry, disturbing the stillness that reigned around us; but it was the calm that preceeds [sic] the storm, for at 6 o'clock the assembly was sounded, and I was ordered to support a Wisconsin battery, which was playing the devil with the enemy's breast-works. Of course the rebels soon sent us their compliments in the shape of grape and cannister, which hummed around and above us, much more musically than agreeable. This position was maintained until 11 o'clock a. m., when we fell a few rods to the rear and left, to obtain a better range of the enemy's works. At noon the first platoon, under the command of Lieut. Anderson, was sent to the right and front as skirmishers. At 1 o'clock p. m., Col. Cowles ordered me to take my second platoon, and 40 men of Co. B's, under command of Lieut. Pearce, making a total of 68 men, to form a storming party. The Col. asked me if I would take command. You know what was my reply. Marching to a thick wood to the left of the battery to be stormed, my force was increased by 68 men from the 6th Michigan under command of Capt. Montgomery of the same regiment, who was ordered by Gen. Dow to take command of the whole force, which was to be supported by the 15th New Hampshire, and 26th Connecticut regiments. We were to be preceeded [sic] by 30 negroes carrying pieces of timber to be laid across a Moat, pointing to the enemy's earthworks, each private of the storming party carrying a board 6 feet long to lay across the timbers, and thus get into the breast-works. At 2 o'clock the word forward was given, and we took the double-quick to cross the plain in front of the enemy. We had hardly got started, when Capt. Montgomery was wounded, and told me to take command. I hurried to the right of the line, encouraging the men meanwhile, and by the time I had attained my position, a shower of shot and shell was poured on us, that there was no withstanding, both men and officers fell flat, many a poor fellow to rise no more. The knuckle joint of the little finger of my left hand was numbed by a piece of a shell just before I got down. I lay still with my nose in the ground, the shot, shell, canister and bullets falling like hail-stones, and humming like the wind around and above us, until there was a slight cessation in the firing, when I jumped up, but could see nothing but a sea of boards on their edge and broadside to the enemy, but I knew that what I wanted was behind those boards, so I shouted forward, and rushed on, crossed a small bridge which spanned a ravine filled with fallen timber, and fell flat-again, and just in time, too, for I felt while falling, a bullet scrape across my shoulder blades. I crawled a few rods to a fallen log, and finally succeeded in getting a small signal flag, with about 15 men with me. We remained here about half an hour, firing at their gunners, and dodging bullets from friend and foe, for those in the rear were firing just as they saw fit, and one poor fellow near me was mortally wounded by a ball from the rear. Well, I waved the flag and shouted to those behind to come on, until I was disheartened, jumped over the log and moved forward within fifteen rods of the breastworks. I here stood waving my sword and shouting Forward! when suddenly my sword arm dropped powerless by my side, and I found the blood flowing from a hole a rebel bullet had made just below my elbow, but the bone was untouched. The bullet had taken its departure, and Lieut. Craig, of the 6th Michigan, the only officer who got there, tying his handkerchief above the wound, I was all right, and more fortunate than the next who ventured, a private of t he 15th New Hampshire. He received a bullet in his groin, just a few paces to the rear of me. It was now about 4 o'clock and until 6 o'clock Lieut. Craig and myself (for my wound was not very painful) tried to get men enough to make a charge, but in vain, only five privates returned to where we were, and about half-past 6 o'clock p. m., I crawled to the ravine before mentioned, leaving the wounded private and one man of the 6th Michigan to care for him until I could send a stretcher to bring him off.\n\nI dragged my sword and pistol with me in my left hand, having left my scabbard when we started, for on such an expedition I judged it best to travel light, and ill-luck lightened me more yet, for I lost my pocket book on the field. It had only $23 in it fortunately, which some rebel is most probably enjoying ere this. Well, at _ o'clock P. M. I came off the field, meeting and passing the dead and dying, some farewell bullets passing me, but I was too tired to mind them. The first man I came to I asked to dress my wound. He did so, and I soon fell asleep, but passed but a restless night, dreaming of Bayonet charges, etc. Our right and the 6th Michigan did well, the less said about the others the better. Five of Co. F. were wounded and poor Jack Hughes was killed; you must let his Father know. I will write to him when my arm is better. He was one of the storming party, and died the death of a brave and fearless soldier upon the field of battle.\n\nPearsall had a ball through his ankle, but is doing well. Pollock of Wappingers Falls, is slightly wounded. Jeffards has a ball in his thigh, but he will come out all right, so the surgeon says. Partington had a bullet enter his cheek, and come out in his neck; he is also doing well. Our greatest misfortune is in losing Col. Cowles, who was shot at the head of his regiment, and lived but half an hour. I did not know of it until coming off the field, and of course was greatly shocked. I was the only other officer wounded. The fact is, Mr. Asssessor, we got into a hornet's nest, and any man who was well on that field, and came off alive, may think himself lucky. My wound is doing well. I have a good surgeon and comfortable quarters. My First Lieut., Williamson, was acting Volunteer Aid to Gen. Dow, and was not hurt. Second Lieut. Anderson did good service with the first platoon Co. F., which was not in the storming party; he is right. I was one of the last to leave the field, and every one was surprised to see me, for it was through the whole regiment, and in fact in New Orleans the next day, that I was killed. The account of that day's fight will not be published in the papers here, as it comes under the head of \"contraband intelligence,\" and is buried.\n\nLet me hear from home soon. Goodbye.

Charles C. Terry\n\nCaptain Arthur DeWint.\n\nKilled at Port Hudson, in the attack on its fortifications, Capt. Arthur DeWint, of the 128th New York Volunteers.\n\nCapt. DeWint was the second son of John Peter DeWint, one of the largest and wealthiest landholders on the Hudson, and on the maternal side was a great grandson of John Adams. Fire with the enthusiasm for the maintenance of this great Republic and its free institutions which he inherited from his progentiors, he was interested in the was as an Anti-Slavery struggle from its first beginnings in Kansas, and when it was fairly inaugurated by the outrage at Sumter, he was among the first to volunteer, entering the 16th Regiment N. Y. S. V., Col. Thomas E. Davies, as Quartermaster, and serving in Heintzelman's Division at the first Bull Run. He joined soon after, the Harris Light Cavalry, Col. Mansfield Davies, and after long exposure to the Virginia miasmas, he returned home to suffer for some months from the prostration of low typhoid fever. Nothing daunter, however, on his recovery he succeeded in raising a company for the 128th New York State Volunteers, of which he was made Captain, and left under Gen. Banks for New Orleans, where after chafing under long inactivity, his regiment was at last permitted to take part in the storming of the fortifications at Port Hudson, where he fell fighting bravely at the head of his men.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago he wrote to his sister, \"I shall take no other method to gain promotion but that which lies in the path of duty and bravery.\"\n\nThe Great Commander has indeed promoted him to higher and more immortal honors than this world can offer, and another honorable name is added to that long list of heroes and self-sacrificing souls who have found their eternal reward in periling all for Freedom, Justice and Humanity.\n\nCapt, DeWint leaves a young wife and a little boy six years old.\n\nFUNERAL OBSEQUIES.\n\nCOL. DAVID S. COWLES.\n\nIn Memoriam.\n\nWhere waved thick ranks of gleaming steel,\n\nLike harvest ears when summer winds play,\n\nWhere swept a host like a summer cloud,\n\nThere, passed a soldier from battle away.\n\nIt's shout the last sound on his falling ear—\n\nHis last sigh lost in its deadly blast;\n\nOn the foe and the fray—his upborne flag,\n\nOn his gallant men his dying look cast;\n\nBreathing these words from his closing lips:\n\n\"Tell me when have I not faithful proved?\n\nWith face to my country's foe I fall—\n\nA soldier I die—tell my Mother beloved!\"\n\nWith dropping banner and dirge, O Earth,\n\nWe give thee to-day, a sacred trust;\n\nThat soldier's forth, now mantled in death,—\n\nThat manhood true, now veiled in the dust,\n\nRest thee there, Soldier, Patriot, Friend!\n\n\"Green be the turf\" o'er thy honored grave;\n\nIt needs no marble to tell us thy worth—\n\nNo proud stone to mark where sleeps the brave.\n\nTo thy hush'd presence our tribute we bring;\n\nThese honors, these tears, are but for a day;\n\nYet memory a pure and fadeless wreath,\n\nOn the altar of grateful hearts will lay.\n\nThe funeral of the lamented Colonel DAVID S. COWLES, of the 128th Regiment, took place in this city yesterday afternoon, and was one of the largest and most imposing that has ever occurred in this city and vicinity. Every street through which the procession moved was so densely crowded with spectators that it was exceedingly difficult to find a passage. The escort of the carriages, made up of Citizens, Masons, Firemen and Military was very imposing, (the Military features were less conspicuous than those of the Masonic Fraternity and Firemen,) while the people who were looking on were to be numbered only by thousands. The religious services were at the Presbyterian Church, and were conducted by Rev. Mr. Folwell, Rev. W. S. Leavitt and Rev. Dr. Demarest, the choir of the church furnishing some solemn and impressive music.\n\nThe gallery was filled to overflowing with ladies, while the body of the church was reserved for the Legal Profession, Citizens and Soldiers from abroad, Masonic Fraternity, Firemen, and Claverack Cadets. Not one quarter of the immense crowd of people could get access to the church.\n\nAfter the reading of the Scriptures by Rev. Mr. Folwell, and music by the choir, Hon. John H. Reynolds, of Albany, delivered the following\n\nEulogy\n\nAs we are about to commit to its kindred dust all that remains on earth of one we loved, we may pause a moment before the last scene is over, and see what precious relics now recline in death. At all times, and on all occasions, when we are taking a final leave of the remains of those who, for some time, have been our companions in the journey of life, our thoughts instinctively turn to the irrevocable past, and memory is busy with mournful recollections of the friend that was. When, as on this day, we gather with reverent grief around the coffin of one who has been very near and dear to us, whose life was beautiful and whose death heroic, who has, in the largest sense fulfilled all the conditions of a complete character, there is a melancholy pleasure in recalling the incidents of such a life and such a death, and in doing honor to the memory of such a man. It is not often that the garments of the grave have in their keeping a form that, in life, illustrated so many manly virtues as the friend we mourn, who, from infancy to manhood followed with unfaltering step the path of duty to himself, to his kindred, to his country and his God.\n\nStruck down in early manhood on the field of battle, while bravely struggling to uphold the honor of his country's flag, we have the sad duty to perform of placing the cypress wreath upon his grave, when much more dear would have been the grateful office of crowning his living brow with laurels, and of bestowing upon living merit the just eulogy of praise.\n\nColonel David Smith Cowles, whose honored remains now lie before us, awaiting the last rites of sepulture, was born in Canaan, Connecticut, on the 26th of February, 1817, and at the time of his lamented death was in the 47th year of his age. His father was the reverend Pitkin Cowles, a clergy-man of the Congregational church, and his mother, to whom his thoughts turned for the last time, amid the din of battle, was Fanny Smith Cowles, who still lingers among the living, and is now a venerable lady of 79 years. His maternal grandfather, Captain Ebenezer Smith, of New Marlboro, Massachusetts, served with great distinction in the army of the revolution, from the battle of Lexington until our liberties were achieved, and the Father of his country took final leave of his companions-in-arms at Newburg in 1783. The patriotic spirit which animated the ancestor was transmitted to his descendant; and, when an endangered country again demanded the services of her best and bravest sons, he laid aside the pursuits of peace and freely gave his life in her defence. Nurtured in infancy and childhood with the tenderest affection; instructed early in the great truths of a holy religion, his after life gave enduring evidence of his youthful training; and, while faithful to all the obligations that rested upon him here, he was ever mindful of the life that was to come. He received his education at Yale College, and on leaving that institution in 1839 commenced the study of the law in the office of Powers & Day, in Catskill, and completed them in the office of his brother, Edward P. Cowles, in this city, in 1843, after which he commenced practice and continued it with marked distinction and success until he entered the military service of his country. During the period of his professional life he held for three years the office of District Attorney of the County of Columbia, and performed its duties as he performed every duty, with firmness and fidelity. In the summer of 1861 he felt it his duty to take up the profession of arms, and at once recruited from among the young men of the county of Columbia, whose confidence he enjoyed, several companies, to engage in the fearful struggle which has wickedly been forced upon our bleeding and unhappy country. In the exigencies of the public service the soldiers he had enlisted were consolidated with and formed the 91st Regiment of Volunteers, the command of which being given to another, he declined to share its fortunes in the field. After the disasters before Richmond, upon the call of the President for 300,000 men, under the auspices of a committee for the District composing the counties of Dutchess and Columbia, a regiment, filled with the flower of the youth of these two counties, was organized as the 128th Regiment of N. Y. Volunteers, and, by unanimous consent, Colonel Cowles was commissioned by the Governor as its commander; and upon none could this honor and responsibility have been more worthily bestowed.\n\nThe 30th day of August, 1862, will long be remembered by the citizens of the counties of Dutchess and Columbia. On that day were gathered in this city, the fathers, the mothers, the wives and the sisters of the gallant band who were about to commit themselves to the fortunes of war, under the leadership of their chosen Commander. There were gathered there of every age and condition—an earnest and patriotic throng—to witness the interesting ceremonies, by which two magnificent standards, upon whose silken folds fair hands had emblazoned the stars of glory, were confided to the keeping of the young and brave who were to bear them aloft amid the storm of battle. These splendid emblems of confidence and pride were received by the manly figure that then stood forth, as the fit representative of your noble sons who had left a thousand hearth-stones to seek in deadly strife the enemies of their country and of mankind; and in their name be promised,—by the recollection of the homes and firesides they were about to leave—by the memory of the mothers, who cherished their infancy—by the sires whose manhood they desire to emulate—by the love and devotion which all brave men bear to their sweet-hearts and wives—by their attachment to the institutions which a heroic ancestry, have handed down for preservation—by the memory of the great names which people so gloriously the past history of our country—by that holy religion which they had been taught—by all these, and by the great God whom all reverently worship, be promised for himself and comrades, that those stainless banners should never be returned in dishonor; and he told you, if it should be the destiny of some to fall, that you might with truth write upon the marble monument that should mark the last resting place of each, \"He lived as mothers wish their sons to live, and died as fathers wished their sons to die.\" Bearing these precious symbols of patriotic confidence and affection, with the prayers and blessings of thousands of loving hearts, these gallant children of Dutchess and Columbia, on the 5th of September, 1862, left the city of Hudson for the theatre of actual war. They proceeded to the city of Baltimore—remained there several weeks, and in early December embarked for the city of New Orleans, with the expedition under Major-General Banks; where, or in its vicinity, they remained until the 21st of May, 1863. During this interval of time, by untiring devotion to the efficiency and welfare of his command, Col. Cowles had brought it to that state of discipline and perfection, in military art, as to entitle it to the broad distinction of being pronounced by the Division Commander, the brave Gen. Sherman, as one of the best Regiments in that Military Department. In various expeditions into the interior of Louisiana, with other troops, although not encountering and considerable numbers of the enemy, their behavior was such as to command the confidence and admiration of their Commander-in-Chief, and placed them in the front rank of the brave men who there sustain the honor of our flag. On the 21st of May, Col. Cowles embarked with his command at New Orleans in the expedition for the reduction of Port Hudson. Upon his arrival near the stronghold to be assailed, the confidence of his superior officers, in his military skill and ability, and in the men under his command, was shown in his having confided to him and his Regiment the important duty of reconnoitering the enemy's works, preparatory to the contemplated assault, which occurred on the 27th of May, where he fell, gallantly leading his men to heroic deeds.\n\nWe know but little of the details of the conflict on that bloody day, but enough to know that our gallant friend bore a conspicuous part in the strife, and dearly illustrated the heroism of a true soldier. His regiment had the post of honor and the post of danger. The orders of his Division and Brigade com­manders, show the dangerous and desperate service he was expected to perform. In the early part of the action he was ordered by Gen. Dow to detail a captain and lieutenant and 50 reliable men, who were expected to carry a portion of the enemy's works by storm, and a little latter he was directed to hold his whole command in readiness for an assault; at a later hour he was directed by Gen. Sherman to send portions of his men to the support of hard pressed batteries, and to quickly hurl the balance in the face of the foe; at half past 10 o'clock he received the last order from his superior in command giving directions as to the service of his guns and that on no account should he withdraw from the post of danger. These orders dated on the field and found upon his person, show that he was in the hottest of the fight and was counted upon for dangerous service; no one need doubt but they were obeyed. Gens. Sherman and Dow both having been disabled and carried from the field, it is believed that the command of the 1st Brigade devolved upon him, and that he assumed it with the certainty that that day would end his life. But duty and honor called, and he was prompt in his obedience. There was no time or inclination to calculate upon dangers to himself for the conflict was raging with untold activity. His comrades in arms were struggling hand to hand with the enemy and he was eager to share with them the fortunes of the day. Placing himself conspicuously in front, and while with a clear voice—heard above the tumult—he was encouraging and leading his men to the assault, he was struck down and in an hour his intrepid spirit returned to God. Wounded and bleeding he refused to be carried from the field, but amid the smoke and din of battle, he divided the last hour of his\n\nlife between words of command and encouragement to his struggling companions and messages of affection to loved ones at home. He was conscious that he had received a fatal wound, yet his great heart was in the battle until it ceased to beat.\n\nA christian soldier, he fought and fell in a holy cause, and when life was fast ebbing, he thought of her who had nurtured him in infancy and said \"Tell my mother I died with my face to the enemy.\" He then with eyes reverently turned towards Heaven, murmured \"Christ Jesus receive my spirit.\" In a few seconds, with an effort he opened his closing eyes and turning to the faithful Sergeant, in whose arms he lay, faintly whispered, \"I have done my duty to the regiment as a man and a soldier,\" and thus sublimely closed the mortal career of David S. Cowles.\n\nIt did not need this last message to his venerable mother to assure her that her noble boy had died loyal to honor and to duty, and that he fell with his face to the field and \"his feet to the foe.\"\n\nThis rapid and imperfect sketch of a model life and a heroic death is all that the limits of this solemn occasion will allow. Brief though it be, there is a mournful pleasure in dwelling for a moment upon the perfection of that character which finds illustration in these simple and effecting details. It was my privilege to have known him, whose early death has cast gloom over so many hearts, intimately and well. For nearly twenty years he was my most intimate companion and friend. In the pursuits of professional life—in the hours of social enjoyment—in the association which binds men in the strongest ties of broth-hood, I have learned to respect his character and love the many nameless qualities that adorned his noble nature. In his professional life he was marked by every characteristic that distinguishes a true lawyer. Courteous and kind to all, he won the affection and commanded the respect of his brethren at the bar and upon the bench. Endowed with rare intellectual gifts, with a cultivated taste, quick judgment, correct legal learning, an exalted sense of justice and a just pride in the dignity of his profession, he was moving onward with steady steps to it highest honors. He was of modest deportment and without personal ambition. He was one of those gentle natures that shrink from public observation, yet bear themselves in all the dignity of conscious power. He was a quiet but devoted student, a serious and an earnest man. He was a close observer, and measured men and events with an accurate and cultivated judgment. He was genial and gentle in all his intercourse with his fellows, but firm and unyielding in his devotion to right principles and correct conduct. No temptations could seduce him from the path of rectitude or beguile him from the grave and serious contemplations that marked the manner of his life. With a heart sensitive to every right generous impulse, and open to every right impression, he was a faithful and devoted friend. Take him in all and all he was the model of a christian gentleman.\n\nIf there was any one characteristic, which more than any other, marked his character, it was his enthusiastic love and devotion to his country. He was a diligent student of our revolutionary history, and had made himself familiar with every spot, which great events had commemorated, and particularly the fields where those of his ancestral blood had snared the dangers of the battle. He had a special reverence for the memory of the brave, who have died in their country's defence. In seeking military service, he was not emulous of military glory, but actuated by and abiding conviction of patriotic duty. No motive of personal ambition prompted him to encounter the privations and perils of a soldier's life—he was moved by purer, holier and higher impulses. With \"God and the rights\" graven upon the hilt of his sword, it was to be drawn only in a cause that had the approval of Heaven, and the arm that wields it was nerved by an undying devotion to that flag of our country, whose stars shall glitter and whose folds fly in triumph over the heads of the brave.\n\nImbued with a fervent patriotism, the whole heart and soul of the heroic dead, was in the contest, for the restoration of our national sovereignty. That he possessed in an eminent degree the qualities of a brave and successful soldier his brief but glorious career sufficiently demonstrates. By patient attention, he made his regiment a model of efficiency and discipline. Fearless by nature, his example made heroes of the soldiers, who idolized him. Cautious and accurate in his judgment, he commanded the confidence and respect of his superiors, in rank,—he had no superiors in all the qualities of manhood. He died a soldier's death. His eyes closed on the first battle-field, under the folds of that flag he had sworn to protect with his life, and none will say that it may not be written upon the marble that shall mark the place of his repose. \"He lived as mothers wish their sons to live, and died as fathers wish their sons to die.\"\n\nThus in early manhood, a heroic spirit has gone to rest—another victim to unholy rebellion. We will preserve the memory of his virtues, and lament his early death. Let us strive to emulate the example of his stainless life, and if our country demands it, follow him to an honored grave rather than surrender to accursed traitors one foot of soil consecrated by the blood of a glorious ancestry.\n\nOf him, and of all who have fallen, or may fall, in the holy cause of our country, it will hereafter be truthfully said\n\n\"They fell wounded but undying\n\nTheir very names ...\n\nThe waters murmer of their name,\n\nThe woods are peopled with their fame,\n\nThe silent pillar lone and gray\n\nClaims kindred with their sacred clay.\n\nTheir spirits wrap the dusky mountain,\n\nTheir memory sparkles o'er the fountain;\n\nthe mightiest rill—the mightiest river\n\nRoll mingling with their fa_ie forever.\"\n\nAfter singing by the Choir, Rev. Wm. Leavitt then delivered the following\n\nAddress:\n\n\"The beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places. How are the mighty fallen.\"\n\nWe have assembled to transact no formal ceremony. Our grief is honest. Our mourning is from the heart. We have left our homes and our employments from one impulse of sadness, and, with the emblems and voices of mourning all around us, we have come in to this hallowed place, to pay the last tribute of respect to him whose remains lie enshrouded—as they should—beneath that sacred flag. Taking up the echoes of the grief uttered by ten thousand brave hearts that saw him fall amid the thunder and shock of battle, we have come to say, in the words with which David began his lament for Jonathan and Saul: \"The beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places: How are the mighty fallen.\"\n\nWe have come to say, on to another, \"He has died like a hero; bury him with loyal hands, at his own home, where he wished to lie; where familiar faces shall gather about his coffin; where those who loved and trusted him shall do the last honors to his memory; and where the winds that play around his grave, if they be chill and laden with winter snows, are yet full of the freedom which he loved, and to whose battle he consecrated his life.\" We have come as christian people, to tell our common grief to the God and Father of all, and to seek for christian consolation in the bereavement which falls not only upon the kindred of the deceased, but upon us all; and while we mourn that the fates of war should have cut down in his prime, one so full of life and manliness—destroying so many precious hopes—we say to that Father, who to his wisdom and mercy appoints all our calamities, and determines the number of our days, and without whose providence, even a sparrow falleth not to the ground—\"Thy will be done.\n\nWe mourn for him because he was one of us—our neighbor—our friend—whose manly form and bearing we shall not look upon again; whose courteous words and sympathizing heart we shall miss. Not only the bereaved family but our city also has given of that which was most precious to it as a sacrifice for the nation's life. We mourn for him as the leader of our sons and brothers, of our friends and kindred, to whose care we trusted them; under whose command we had hoped to see them return, proudly and bravely, as on the day of their departure, when we thronged the streets, with tears and farewells and silent prayer for the blessings and protection of God. They still remain in the field, though with thinned ranks, covering themselves with honor; but he, their chosen and trusted leader, rides no longer at their head, and no longer cheers them onward in the fight. With them we mourn to-day. We mourn, too, a nation's loss; for it is a time when the nation needs every brave and noble spirit—every true and earnest heart—and in this conflict of the age, when the question is being settled in the field of battle whether freedom or slavery shall overspread the land—whether liberty and order, intelligence and true religion shall be the nation's glory and its sure defence—or whether oppression, barbarism, degradation, anarchy, shall cover it with a night of horror and shame—whether this flag, which is daily growing dearer to our hearts with the price we pay for its salvation, shall be buried forever in the grave of our beloved ones who have fallen as martyrs in its cause, or whether, sanctified and made more precious by their blood, it shall wave in triumph over a redeemed, purified, and united land;—in such a time, and when such questions are being decided, the nation knows not how to spare a spirit wise in counsel, chivalous in courage, earnest in a patriotism founded upon principle, true and unflinching amid the death-shower of the battle, like that spirit which from these mortal remains has re­turned to the God who gave it.\n\nAnd yet we sorrow, not without consola­tion. The cause in which he fell throws a portion of its own sacredness around his death; and the sad memories are sweetened by the thought \"he died for his country.\" We do not, we cannot, feel that a life thus laid down, however prematurely as it may seem, is lost; and we think how many a life of four-score years has not in all its weary length so much of true manhood and self-sacrifice; so much of noble being and doing as were concentrated in the few hours of that fatal day. Can we in our secret thoughts avoid finding a comfort in these sacred words: \"Whosoever will lose his life shall save it?\" And do we not feel that there clings to his last utterances the fragrance of a comfort and hope, which prepared him for the end of earth? Whence but from a soul calm and trustful\n\namid those dying agonies, could come those words, breathed out with his expiring strength to the heart, which through all his life had been nearest and dearest to his own,—those words, which are enshrined in our memories, and which will live in history itself—\"Tell my mother that I died with my face to\n\nthe enemy?\" My friends, it is true—we all perhaps have marked it in the history of this war—that a consolation comes to the earnestly loyal and patriotic in their bereavements, which others know not of. God's own mercy\n\nbrings a balm to the wounded heart, and en­ables it to trust in His holy keeping the beloved ones who have fallen in defense of the nation's life; and the sympathies of Jesus who himself died for us all, are with the friends and kindred of those who die in a just and righteous cause. Here, then, to Jesus—to him who hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows—let us bring the burden that is so heavy upon our hearts. He will not leave us comfortless. He who from the Cross spoke words of consolation to His own mother, tortured with the agonies of her dying son, will comfort the mother who mourns to-day. He will strengthen the faith of all the kindred of the deceased in the mercy of God, real and changeless, whatever clouds and darkness may hide it. The nation's cause shall not be less, but more sacred in our eyes for this fresh sacrifice it has cost us; for who can be base enough to come as a mourner here, and then go and plot or sympathize with the vile spirits that have robbed us of this precious life?\n\nAnd now, with prayer to the God of all grace and consolation, that he will give the promised blessing to them that mourn and that he will make us all more true, more brave, more earnest; following in the steps of him who has proved so well his truth and not done my duty as a man and a shoulder,\" —let us bear all that was mortal at our brother to his final rest. And there—close by the home to which his thoughts returned from that distant field of death—there, where no sound of battle disturbs the sacred stillness of the grave—there, with his noblest and most enduring monument in our memories and grateful love—peaceful in his sleep.\n\nAfter the exercises in the church were concluded, the procession was formed in the following, order and marched to the Cemetery:—\n\nORDER OF PROCESSION.\n\nMarshall—Cornelius Bortle, and Alds: J.

He was interred in the new plot of ground just appropriated by the Common Council as a burial place for all resident officers and soldiers who have or who may hereafter die in the service of the United States during the present rebellion. It is a fine lot, 64 by 32 feet, at the southern extremity of Vault Avenue.\n\nThe head of the coffin bore the following inscription in raised letters:\n\nCol. Davis S. Cowles,\n\n128th Regiment N. Y. S. Volunteers,\n\nDied on the field of battle,\n\nMay 27, 1863.\n\nThe day was very universally observed, places of business generally closed in the afternoon, flags at half-mast, and several places draped in mourning. Among the buildings that attracted universal attention was the Daily Star office, and C. E. Butler's Jewelry store underneath, which was draped in mourning and decorated with the stars and stripes.\n\nThere were many incidents connected with the doings of the day which we have not space for in to-day's issue, or time to write out.\n\nThe 128th Regiment. —We have just received a letter from Surgeon Palmer C. Cole, of the 128th Regiment, too late for to-day's issue which we shall publish in our next, giving a full list of the killed and wounded of this Regiment in the battle of the 27th of May last.\n\nThe Late Col. Cowles, 128th N. Y. Volunteers. —The loss of this brave officer who was killed while leading his men against the Rebel works at Port Hudson, is mourned by all who knew him. Lieut. Col. Smith has issued an appropriate order relative to the death of the soldier, and a series of resolutions have been adopted by the officers of the regiment, one of which reads as follows:—\n\nResolved, That in the private character, and the professional and military career of Col. Cowles, we recognize all the virtues, the ability, and every element of a pure, talented and brave character, that the devotedness of his\n\nRevolutionary forefathers was repeated in his career in a cause not less sacred; that as in life he exemplified the principles and energy which should animate the patriot soldier, so in the gallantry which distinguished his fall he taught us how to die. In death and life, without fear and without reproach.\n\nColonel David S. Cowles.\n\nWe perform this week, a most melancholy duty in announcing to our readers the death of Col. David S. Cowles, of the 128th Regi­ment, New-York Volunteers. He was kill­ed in the attack made by Gen. Banks' forces upon Port Hudson on the 27th of May 1863. He died gloriously in the discharge of his duty, in the conflict of battle and with his face to the foe. An account of the affair in as much detail as our present advices enable us to give, will be found in our columns. The enemy's works were attempted to be taken by storm— it was a hand to hand contest—and our lamented friend lost his life, pierced by a bayonet.\n\nWe would gladly give an extended notice of the life and career of Col. Cowles, but we have not the materials at hand for such a pur­pose. He was the son of a respected pastor of a Presbyterian Church in Canaan, Connecti­cut, and was born we believe, at that place.—He was about 45 years of age at the time of his death. He enjoyed, as most New England boys do, the advantages of a liberal education and we believe graduated or spent some time at Yale College. Some fifteen years ago—perhaps more, he came here to reside, pursuing his profession of the law with his brother E. P. Cowles, (now Ex-Judge Cowles, of New-York,) who had preceded him to this place. The brothers maintained a respectable position and lucrative practice here until some six or eight years since Judge Cowles removed to the city of New-York. His brother, (the late Colonel,) remained in this place and continued to reside in Hudson until his death. He was honorably distinguished and pecuniarily successful in the practice of the law. Possessed of a vigorous and discriminating mind, and of much energy of character, he found no dif­ficulty in winning his way to a respectable place in his profession. Having a fine personal appearance, much dignity and at the same time amenity of manners, a noble and manly spirit, and much generosity of heart, he drew to himself many warm and attached friends, and the respect and confidence of the community. He was distinguished for per­sonal integrity, for exalted honor, for manly courage, and for a high degree of cultivation of mind and heart. On the breaking out of this unhappy, but to us necessary war, he at once took high and manly ground on the side of his country. He entered into the feelings and questions involved in the contest with all the ardor of his nature and with the spirit of a true patriot. At an early stage of the war he took vigorous measures to raise a regiment in this county. He partially succeeded but failing to make up the full number necessary to complete a regiment, his men were consolidated with those of an Albany regiment and though offered a highly honorable but subordinate position there, he declined it and temporarily resumed the practice of his profession.\n\nLast year when new volunteers were demanded, and new regiments organized, the attention of our citizens was again directed to Col. Cowles, and by the unanimous voice of the committee having charge of the subject, and with the entire approbation of the Commander-in-Chief, he was appointed to the command of a splendid regiment, (the 128th New York Volunteers,) composed of some of the best men of Dutchess and Columbia. None of our citizens will fail to remember the spirit and enthusiasm and success with which that regiment grew up under the fostering care of Col. Cowles and his associate officers, and influential citizens of this Congressional district, nor the just pride and favor, with which, for local and other reasons, it has always been regarded by the inhabitants of these two counties. No one will forget the interesting ceremonies which took place on the departure of the regiment for the war in the early part of September last—the presentation of the Regimental flag by the ladies of Hudson, with a patriotic speech from Judge Miller—the presentation of the National banner by the ladies of Dutchess with appropriate remarks from the historian Lossing—the spirited and eloquent responses of Col. Cowles to each in behalf of himself and his regiment. The whole proceedings were marked with a degree of interest and enthusiasm, and attended by a multitude of \"fair ladies and brave men,\" that will make the day long remembered in the annals of Columbia. \"Col. Cowles, in full dress uniform,\" (we quote from an account written at the time,) \"was the cynosure of all eyes. His \"handsome figure, his dignified and chivalrous bearing, seemed never so conspicuous as upon this occasion. The qualities of a commanding officer appeared to have been stamped upon him by nature, and all present, we doubt not, felt that our soldiers have a leader, who is worthy of them, and of the cause.\"\n\nAlas, how different are the melancholy emotions inspired by the recent intelligence of the death of himself and his brave comrades, from the shouts of enthusiasm and joy which burst forth on the gala day in question. The regiment took its departure from our shores amid the cheers and the plaudits of the assembled multitude and with the hopes and prayers of every patriot wafted to Heaven for the successful accomplishment of its mission. Pausing for a while at Baltimore and doing honorable service there, proceeding thence to Fortress Monroe, it ultimately found its way under the direction of the Government to New Orleans and its vicinity. Its later and always honorable history is familiar to all. And now in that tide of alternate success and reverse which is the inevitable fortune of war, we are called upon to mourn, not the failure of our arms, but the death of a gallant commander, in whom and his compatriots we felt a warm personal interest, and for whose successful mission and happy return we had devoutly prayed. But such are the appointments of a wisdom which cannot err, and the fruits of a discipline, which is ultimately, we trust, to work out the nation's purification and safety. We trust that fitting honors will be paid to the memory of Col. Cowles, and that his funeral obsequies, which we understand will take place here, will be observed in a manner to show our appreciation of his worth and gallantry, and of the value and sacredness of the cause in the maintenance of which he surrendered his life.\n\nWe reserve an appropriate notice of the other officers and men who fell or suffered in the same engagement until fuller advices shall enable us to do them better justice.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE WAR.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM NEW-ORLEANS.\n\nATTACK UPON PORT HUDSON!\n\nTHE 128TH REGIMENT ENGAGED.\n\nDESPERAE [sic] FIGHTING.\n\nCol.

Since Friday May 22, a continuous bombardment has been maintained by Admiral Farragut's fleet and the 1st Vermont Battery, Capt. Hibbard, has annoyed the batteries during the day.\n\nAt 1 p. m., on Wednesday the battle commenced. The lines extended for a distance of nearly four miles in front of the enemy's works. The extreme right was given to Gen. Weitzel, Gen. Grover occupying the next position, Gen. Augur the third, and Gen. Sherman the left.\n\nOn the left, the 165th New-York, Lieut.-Col. Abel Smith, were ordered to discharge their muskets and charge upon the enemy's ranks. For the following details of the movement I am indebted to Sergeant-Major Casselli A. Palmieri, who is reported as having displayed unusual gallantry:\n\nGen. Sherman intended to carry a section of the fortifications at the point of the bayonet. The 2d Duryee Zouaves and the 177th New-York made a desperate onset, and were met by a rain-storm of bullets. Lieut.-Col. Smith of the former regiment was severely wounded. Finding it impossible to successfully accomplish the daring purpose, a retreat was effected.\n\nCol. Clark of the 6th Michigan carried the colors of his regiment inside the first line of fortifications, and raised them upon the Rebel flagstaff. The 128th New-York, Col. Cowles, immediately fol"
