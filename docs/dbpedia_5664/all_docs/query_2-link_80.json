        "text": "“Obama’s War” is a “Frontline” documentary on PBS about Afghanistan that might more accurately be called “McChrystal’s Battle.”\n\nThis is a focused look at a dismally complex and intractable conflict, and running as it does on Tuesday, the night before President Obama’s fifth strategy meeting on Afghanistan with his national security team, it couldn’t be more timely.\n\nOr depressing. What “Obama’s War” does best is illustrate the immense task that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander of American and allied forces in Afghanistan, has taken on. As Mr. Obama weighs his options, and General McChrystal travels the world lobbying for a revitalized counterinsurgency plan and at least 40,000 more troops, “Obama’s War” gives viewers a glimpse of what trying to defeat the Taliban — again — really entails eight years into the conflict.\n\nThe sight of a 20-year-old Marine being shot and killed in a firefight is shocking and heartbreaking. So, in a different way, is the scene of a Marine sergeant risking his life on a foot patrol in wilting heat to befriend — and debrief — tight-lipped, wary Afghan farmers. He is part of a campaign to reassure the civilian population in a place where even the word “where” is misunderstood; the Afghan interpreter has little command of English or the local dialect.\n\nOn enemy terrain a seemingly simple assignment — face time with local merchants — is fraught with mortal risk and the spirit-grinding frustration of cultural divide.\n\nAnd that reality often gets lost in the swirl of seminars, news conferences and Sunday talk shows. The film slyly makes a detour to a boisterous, cup-clattering coffee break at a counterinsurgency conference in Washington last summer, where a panel of what “Frontline” describes as “the best and the brightest” experts (including Gen. David H. Petraeus, who oversees operations in Iraq and Afghanistan) explains the building blocks of “a global counterinsurgency campaign.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
