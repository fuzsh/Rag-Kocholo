Throughout his career heâ€™s thrived on using data to understand the world around us. He has a PhD in astrophysics and spent 20 years at institutions across Europe and China, building a research group investigating the origins of our galaxy, the Milky Way. After leaving academia he has worked as a data scientist, enjoying the challenge of tackling new problems in a new environment. These challenges include using natural language processing to automatically map the people and organisations mentioned in online news media, to the analysis of networks on Twitter.
