        "text": "On Oct. 28, in \"The Rise of ISIS,\" FRONTLINE's Martin Smith reports from Iraq on how and why the brutal Islamist group came to power, how Iraq began coming undone after the American withdrawal, and what it means for the U.S. to be fighting there again. Premiering Oct. 28 on PBS and at pbs.org/frontline.\n\nISIS is on the rise in Afghanistan — and they say they're getting young kids to join the jihad. In a Nov. 17 special report, FRONTLINE reveals on film the degree to which ISIS is gaining a foothold in the country, and how they’re focusing their efforts on training a new generation of jihadists. Also this hour: exploring a Pakistan police unit's fight against the Taliban."
