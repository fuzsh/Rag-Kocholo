Confronting ISIS examines the successes, failures and challenges of the U.S.-led fight to degrade and destroy ISISâ€”no one wants to see ISIS succeed, but the lack of common priorities between the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East has complicated the fighting process. This two-hour special investigates as ISIS loses ground in the region, but strikes out abroad.\n\nShare This Program"
