        "meta_description": "The Book of Life by Martin Smith, released 19 February 2018\n\n1. Real Ragga Sound Bwoy\n2. Sexy Gurl\n3. Da Streez\n4. Welcum To Da Club\n5.

Book Of Life\n\nStatement regarding release, written by Martin Smith:\r\n\r\nSo there I sit, unabashedly, at my desk staring out my office window. I wear a bleached polyester shirt, short sleeved. An apricot tie, khakis. There I sit. There I sit. Slight grease in my hair, a pot belly from years of snacking on Doritos and Mountain Dew. Dreams of a great body, like Link from Zelda, or Kratos from God of War. Either one will work. A sunset engulfs the office. An air conditioned breeze sets in. Alas, the heat of the sun is not felt. I yearn for the warmth, but the sun is set away from me. Beyond a prison of glass and cement. Any life, is but of the plants that surround me, in this white collar prison. All I dream of is going home, and playing through the weekend of Overwatch and Skyrim. What is this existence? Existence of others, am I not a real person. Or am I reflection of these fantasies. Alas, I am too old, and too young to ever know for sure. But here I sit, as the sun drifts beyond the horizon, into the next continent, to begin a new day for another miserable man such as myself. I check my watch, a 2007 digital watch of which brand I am not familiar with. No sound. Just the light, dim blue light, of the light in the watch. Blue like the sky. I think of birds. Birds are free, but they are still slaves to the sky. We are all slaves, but we find freedom in newer slavery. Finding new portions of life to be free in another form of prison. Only God is free, but I do not believe in God. But if I did, maybe I would think he is free. Alas, I will never be free. Only free until I drift into the virtual realm of darkness known as my computer modem. Intrinsic value, I am not sure what it means. But the big guys here know. Maybe I can become a different slave like them. Imprisoned in silk, no more polyester. Maybe I should kkknO. Maybe I should No no no NoNoO. No I’m not I’m not I’m not. My name is Chessmaster. I am a cool fighting robot from the year 3000 with ninja fighting abilities. I am Flapty no no no biz. Martin smith chessmaster ? Ono flappy cleat. Soup? Hello, my name is NO not flappy bird but n chessmaster. I am from the future. I once saved The emperors daughter from anflap flap flap flap flap. Here lays my Katana blade flap flap NoNoNoNo. Not flap. Not cl ,NO NO N. Flappy flappy flappy flappy flappy flappy flappy bird bird flappy bird flappy bird flappy fucker.
