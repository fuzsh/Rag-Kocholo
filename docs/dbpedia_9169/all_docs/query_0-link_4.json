        "meta_description": "Christmas Eve in Bethlehem by David Rovics, released 04 November 2013\n\nChurch bells are ringing, families are wearing their Sunday best\r\nChoirs are singing, red sun is setting in the west\r\nA soldier is yelling, standing tall\r\nCheckpoint is closing, outside a giant wall\r\nIt&#39;s Christmas Eve in Bethlehem\r\n\r\nTourists are coming – birthplace of Jesus, a call to port\r\nNow they are leaving, they say you should keep it short\r\nShop floors are empty, there&#39;s no one there\r\nCheckpoint is closing to Manger Square\r\nIt&#39;s Christmas Eve in Bethlehem\r\n\r\nThose Christians who stay here dream of sprouting wings\r\nBut they stubbornly stay near their long-lost kings\r\nRelatives stranded far away\r\nThey have been branded terrorists, that&#39;s what the colonists say\r\nIt&#39;s Christmas Eve in Bethlehem",
