        "text": "Jug Free America was a jug band I played in, which existed from 2001-2005. We played a mix of old jug band tunes, early blues/pre-blues, old-time, country, ragtimey stuff and acoustic reggae. I don’t usually go around promoting my own stuff on the show, but just objectively, this band is worth checking out.\n\nPosted here is our final CD- “Jug Free America- California: 2005”\n\n(Click Here to download)\n\nThis was recorded on the fly by Chris Patchett at his house in Berkeley, CA in the summer of 2005, shortly before the band broke up.
