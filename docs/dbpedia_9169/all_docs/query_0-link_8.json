        "meta_description": "Anthony&#39;s Wiener by David Rovics, released 04 November 2013\n\nAnthony Weiner takes picture of his wiener\r\nAnd sends them off to lots of women that he&#39;s never met\r\nNormally I wouldn&#39;t care about some guy&#39;s pubic hair\r\nExcept in this case it&#39;s a politician we can hopefully soon forget\r\n\r\nHe wants to make New Yorkers proud and show he&#39;s very well-endowed\r\nTo be the mayor of the city from which he sends his Tweets\r\nHe&#39;s a good Democrat, he&#39;ll go up to bat\r\nFor the people of New York, and the random women that he greets\r\n\r\nAnthony Weiner&#39;s wiener\r\nThese days it&#39;s all the rage\r\nTo find out more about Anthony&#39;s wiener\r\nJust take a peek at the front page\r\n\r\nI probably wouldn&#39;t give a shit about his adolescent wit\r\nWhether he was sexting after he resigned from Congress or before\r\nI may not like his style as he issues his denial\r\nBut what really bugs me is he voted for the war\r\n\r\nNow that it&#39;s the second scandal, maybe we can pull the handle\r\nAnd send Anthony and his wiener down some Flushing drain\r\nAnd await the politician next who will send a penile text\r\nOne vile politician down, but far too many still remain",
