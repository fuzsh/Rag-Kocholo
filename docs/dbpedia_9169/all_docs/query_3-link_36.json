        "text": "This presentation will show how workers' struggles are not just a thing of the past but are very much alive today. The first 20 minutes feature a video about the original Bread & Roses strike in 1912. Following the video will be speakers from three current campaigns -- OUR Walmart; Seattle port truck drivers; and the Longshore unionâ€™s fight against union-busting by EGT in Longview, WA. Come and be inspired by workers telling their stories and standing up for justice in the 21st Century\n\nEmily Pothast and David Golightly, Levi Fuller, Jeremy Burk, The Horde and the Harem, Annie Ford, Pufferfish, Stellarondo, The Jelly Rollers, Led to Sea, RedDog, Baby Grams, Robert Millis\n\nHarry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music was very influential on the revival of American folk music. Artists from this year's festival will join us again, to play some of their favorite songs from the Anthology."
