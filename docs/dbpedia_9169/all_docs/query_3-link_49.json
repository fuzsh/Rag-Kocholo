Mesmerizing!\n\n- Marcel Reuter, (LU, 1973) Interludio (2007) for clarinet, cello and piano - 4’\n\nIn this trio, the cello takes very much a back seat compared with the other instruments. “In writing this piece I was thinking of Glenn Gould’s performance and of the ‘autumnal calm’ he more and more looked for in his performances towards the end of his life.” (United Instruments of Lucilin - Goldberg’s Ghost)\n\n- Senay Uğurlu (TR, 1997) dep . R(i)e . viv . al . a . tion (2019) for ensemble - 7’\n\ndep . R(i)e . viv . al . a . tion is an artificial word that was created as considering the phonetic features of both deprivation and revival words.\n\n- Jose Luis Valdivia Arias (ES, 1994) Boyish (2022) for flute, clarinet, saxophone, violin, viola, cello, percussion and piano - 8’\n\nIn 2020 United Instruments of Lucilin premiered Valdivia’s work Boyish.

The purpose is to explore all the potential of the basic ideas expressed at the start by adding more and more variations and thus allowing the piece to grow in duration in the future.\n\nWith: Winnie Cheng (violin), Ingrid Schoenlaub (violoncello), Pierre Fourcade (violoncello), Henning Sieverts (contrabass), Païvi Kauffmann (flute), Max Mausen (clarinet), Jean-Marc Foltz (clarinet), Olivier Sliepen (saxophone), Andreas Mader (saxophone), Zala Kravos (piano), Louisa Marxen (percussion), Tom Goff (conductor)\n\nComposers:\n\nAnna Korsun - born in 1986 in Ukraine.\n\nAnna Korsun is a composer, sound artist and performer.

This piece was commissioned by iii.\n\n- Catherine Kontz (LU, 1976) Snakes and Ladders (2018) for 2-8 players (musicians, dancers, non-musicians, suitable for adults or kids) - 10’\n\nThis game-score is derived from the classic Snakes and Ladders, a game in which players compete to be the first to reach the end tile. In this musical version, each performer takes on the role of a game-piece, and uses one or more musical instruments (including voice), object(s), and/or their body to interpret the instructions on the board.\n\n- Fátima Fonte (PT, 1983) The Sleep Collector (2022) for percussion, flute, violoncello - 10’ *\n\n*World Premiere - Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\n- Simon Steen-Andersen (DNK, 1976) Besides Beside (2003) for cello and percussion - 4’\n\nBeside Besides is actually the ending of a longer piece, BESIDES, for three amplified and three damped instruments. In the global form as well as in the form of a fragment this piece is - among other things - a search for a new beginning.

Her artistic work includes performances with live-electronics and installations with sound objects which she often designs herself. She is interested in setting her gestures into relationships with sounds, mainly by electronic means. The result could be called “performative sound art”, since it combines elements from performance art, electronic music, and visual arts. Her work transcends genres and is presented at occasions as diverse as experimental or electronic music concerts, open air festivals, sound art gallery venues, digital art events, or performance art festivals. She is a member of iii (instrument inventors initiative), an artist run, community platform supporting new interdisciplinary practices linking performance, technology and the human senses.\n\nCathy has a permanent teaching position at the Department for Sound Arts of the University of the Arts in Bern, Switzerland. She is a regular guest lecturer at other art and music universities.

This is what Alban Berg responded to George Gershwin in Paris during the spring of 1928, as to why there was no distinction between what we consider “educated” music and “popular” music.\n\nFrancesco Tristano has endorsed this quote over the last decade with his work; combining piano and synthesizer, between the scores of baroque masters, contemporary composers, and the latest production and sequencing tools.\n\nComposer: Francesco Tristano - born in 1981 in Luxembourg\n\nFrancesco Tristano is a composer, performer and producer, working simultaneously in areas as disparate as they are complementary. Tristano tours the world performing baroque and contemporary repertoire; records dance tracks for electronic music labels whilst continuing with his ambitious project of recording all of Johann Sebastian Bach’s piano repertoire; and makes albums woven from his own personal stories in which he explores the sensibility and tonal richness of the piano.\n\nHis simultaneous fascination for Bach’s clean tones and the rhythmic pulse of techno; his interest in the complex study of noise, effects and timbres made by composers like Cage or Ligeti; and the need to explore his own imagination through albums such as Idiosynkrasia (2010) or the recent Tokyo Stories (2019), can be traced back to his time as a student at New York’s Juilliard School.\n\nWhile at Juilliard, Francesco laid the groundwork of his ambitions as an interpreter of Bach’s music: he played and recorded the Piano Concertos with his ensemble The New Bach Players, as well as recording the Goldberg Variations (found on the small Accord label) on his own. Shortly after, he was signed by the French label Infiné, where he released his first records blending electronica and piano: Not for Piano (2007), where he created versions of techno anthems like Jeff Mills’ The Bells or Derrick May’s Strings of Life on the piano; Auricle Bio On (2008), where the piano is conceived as a sampler; and Idiosynkrasia (2010), in which he seamlessly joined his virtuosity on the keys and his programming prowess, refining his concept of “Piano 2.0,” where the instrument reaches a new textural iteration through the use of computers.\n\nTristano’s big leap took place in 2011, when he was signed by Deutsche Grammophon, with whom he recorded three programmes inspired by his ascent as a concert pianist of international acclaim. The first one was Bach/Cage (2011) – an exploration of the sonic space where Johann Sebastian Bach and John Cage’s music co-existed despite a distance of three centuries: the punctuation of emotion, the search for unusual textures, the surprising quality of the serendipitous.\n\nIn 2017, Francesco Tristano began his collaboration with Sony Classical, focusing his efforts on releasing his own work in a new phase as a recording artist. While still touring the world both as a pianist and as an electronic artist, performing in concert halls as well as experimental and dance music festivals, he returned to the piano as a tool for creation in Piano Circle Songs (2017), a collection of songs that evoke his interest for French impressionist composers. In his most recent album, Tokyo Stories (2019), he pays homage to Japan and captures the atmospheres and experiences accumulated throughout the years visiting the country as an artist and submerging himself in its culture.\n\nAnd still, at the edge of the horizon, Francesco Tristano’s great life project, the one he will never abandon, continues to takes shape: to record Johann Sebastian’s Bach complete repertoire. As Berg said, “music is music”, and Bach will always be there because he was the only creator ever to transcend it.\n\nIn 2004, he won the first prize at the International piano competition for contemporary music in Orléans, France.\n\n- Giulia Lorusso (IT, 1990) Organique (2022) for string trio - 10’*\n\n*Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\n- Tatsiana Zelianko (LU, 1980) Un songe austral (2021) for string quartet - 25’\n\nUn songe austral, for string quartet and dancer, was commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin with the support of Sacem and was premiered in Bergen, Norway during the Avgarde Festival in 2021.\n\n- Sonja Mutić (IT, 1984) brightness (2022) for string trio -10’ *\n\n*Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\nWith: André Pons-Valdès (violin), Winnie Cheng (violin), Danielle Hennicot (viola), Ingrid Schoenlaub (violoncello)\n\nComposers\n\nGiulia Lorusso - born in 1990 in Rome, Italy\n\nGiulia Lorusso studied piano and composition at the Conservatory “G.

The structures of animal voices are something completely different from our 'music'.” (Carola Bauckholt in conversation with Raoul Mörchen in 2008, broadcast by Deutschlandradio Kultur Berlin on 9.12.2008, translated by Jil Hamm for United Instruments of Lucilin)\n\nJames Dillon (UK, 1950) The acrobat (2022) for accordion, electric organ or keyboard, percussion - 10’ *\n\n*Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\nAgainst the quiet pedals and swells of the two keyboards, the percussionist takes on the virtuosic persona of 'the acrobat' as he juggles both impossibly soft dynamics, stretches of space and the 'subito' interruptions of freeze-frame pauses. Finally an accord!\n\nMartyna Kosecka (PL, 1989) Weightlessness (2021) for flute(s), bass clarinet, violin, cello and piano - 7’\n\nPremiere: 20.11.2021, Neimënster, rainy days festival, Luxembourg\n\n\"Weightlessness\" for chamber ensemble is inspired by the works of Stanisław Lem and celebrates the centenary of his birth in 2021. The piece takes up the theme of weightlessness and specific thinking about the relationship between the pressures described in music - ‘heaviness of composed sound’ and their dispersion in the acoustic space.\n\nDiana Rotaru (RO, 1981) Some reeds and some air moving them (2019) for accordion - 9’\n\nThe piece was commissioned by and dedicated to Klemen Leben.

Her compositions often blur the boundaries between visual arts, musical theater and concert music. She is especially fond of using noisy sounds, which are often produced by unconventional means (such as extended instrumental techniques or bringing everyday objects to the concert hall). It is important to note that these noises are not just part of some kind of a predetermined compositional structure, but rather they are carefully studied and left free to unfold and develop at their own pace lending the compositions their own unique rhythm.\n\nAbout: After working at the Theater am Marienplatz (TAM), Krefeld for several years, she studied composition at the Musikhochschule Köln (1978 - 1984). She founded the Thürmchen Verlag (music publisher) along with Caspar Johannes Walter in 1985, and six years later they founded the Thürmchen Ensemble.\n\nIn 2013 she was elected member of Akademie der Künste in Berlin. As of 2021 she is the director of the music section. In 2015, she was appointed professor of composition with focus on contemporary music theatre at the Anton Bruckner Privatuniversität in Linz, Austria. In 2020, she was elected member of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts.\n\nShe has received numerous residencies and prizes such as the Bernd Alois Zimmermann Scholarship from the city of Cologne (1986), a residency at the Villa Massimo in Rome (1997). She was selected to represent Germany at the World Music Days in Mexico City 1992, Copenhagen 1996, Seoul 1997 and in Zurich 2004.

Notable among his other cycles are The book of Elements for piano and three books of duets titled Traumwerk Book. Anthropology, created for the Orchestre de Paris, also includes multiple pieces.\n\nDillon’s catalogue also includes a major stage work, Philomela, for which he wrote his own libretto, inspired by Ovid and Sophocles. Dillon was also selected by BBC Television and the Arts Council of England to compose Temp’est for the series Sound of Film.\n\nJames Dillon began his musical career playing traditional Scottish bagpipe and in a rock band. His studies included art and design at the University of Glasgow, and the music of Northern India at Keele University. He then traveled to London to study music, acoustics, and linguistics. He is primarily self-trained as a composer.\n\nAfter winning First Prize in the competition of the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival in 1978, Dillon’s reputation grew rapidly.

In her compositions, she explores every sound detail through the magnifying glass, focusing on the timbral qualities of pitch, microscopic sound abilities, and microtonal deviations.\n\nThrough her music, she wants to draw a metaphor for occurrences, accidents, and issues significant in everyday life. Gender equality, cultural legacy, respecting nature and environment are some of the topics that she engages her listener with. In her opinion, each composition is an independent short story that exists in a series of chapters in our book of life. She writes what is to follow.\n\nMartyna Kosecka is a composer, conductor, performer, experimentalist and researcher in new music. She studied composition and conducting at the Music Academy in Kraków and at the Music Academy in Katowice.

Many composers have been fascinated by the ‘player piano’ - an instrument like this leaves even the most skilful pianist's fingers far behind. Verunelli calls it ‘electronic music without electronic sound’. In contrast, she puts a human virtuoso on the flute. The contrast could hardly be greater, and yet the two worlds seem to merge.” (Muziekcentrum De Bijloke, translated by Jil Hamm for United Instruments of Lucilin)\n\n- Clara Iannotta (IT, 1983) dead wasps in the jam-jar (i) (2014-2015) for violin and electronics - 3’\n\nDead wasps in the jam jar (i) is one of four pieces commissioned by violinist Yuki Numata Resnick to nestle amongst the movements of J.S. Bach’s Partita no. 1 for solo violin.\n\nIannotta’s piece focuses on the Double to the Corrente, replacing Bach’s running scales with glissandos retaining elements of his rhythmic proportions and directions. Over this loosely Bachian framework is draped a range of noise effects, created in particular by different bow pressures and circular paperclips attached to the instrument’s strings. In this way, dead wasps sounds little like Bach while hinting at his phrasing and melodic contours: his music’s skeletal structure.\n\n- Yang Song (CN, 1985) Poem (2016) for prepared piano and computer - 9’\n\nThis \"Poem for Piano and Computer\" is inspired by an ancient Chinese plucked instrument, the Guqin. The electronic part of this piece was created using recordings of original piano samples. While some sound material of the electronic part and the original instrument sound similar, some are modified and manipulated by adding sounds from the Guqin’s musical character such as glissando and pizzicato. At times, the computer part relies on and amplifies the piano part, and sometimes has its own independent \"voice\". The piece aims to portray the traditional sound acoustic of the Guqin, as if to establish an atmosphere that exists in a poetry dialogue between the piano and the computer.\n\n- Genoël Von Lilienstern (DE, 1979) KOER (2022) for viola and electronics - 15’\n\nPremiered in May 2022 at Philharmonie de Luxembourg\n\nWith: André Pons-Valdès (violon), Danielle Hennicot (viola), Sophie Deshayes (flute), Pascal Meyer (piano), (electronics)\n\nComposers: Francesca Verunelli - born in 1979 in Pietrasanta, Italy\n\nAbout: Francesca Verunelli studied composition and piano at the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini in Florence where she earned both diplomas summa cum laude.

In a way, it is a way of composing that operates from intuition and which then seeks to create a coherence, a form.\n\n- Mirela Ivičević (HR, 1980) Subsonically Yours (2021) for ensemble - 10’\n\n“Composition means reassembling something, especially nowadays. There are only a few unknown sounds left. All the more important is what you do with the existing sounds. Collage is often my weapon of choice, because I am personally most interested in how very different materials can coexist without losing anything of their nature, of their essence, without having to substantially soften or hide them.” (taken from an interview by Shilla Strelka, Austrian Music Export)\n\n- Raphaël Languillat (MAGHREB, 1989) crucifixion (perugino) (2015) for chamber ensemble - 15’\n\nLanguillat wrote this composition after seeing Pietro Perugino’s painting of the crucifixion of Christ from 1496. While the influence of the painting is quite obvious – as can be seen by the placement of the musicians on stage in three duos like Perugino’s triptych – the composition itself focuses on visual and aesthetic questions, as Languillat explains: “How can one represent such suffering in such a peaceful scene? What is a landscape in music? What can a Renaissance fresco mean to us in the twenty-first century? And how can I reinterpret Perugino’s masterpiece in my music?” (GAUDEAMUS)\n\nWith: Winnie Cheng (violin), Renata Van der Vyver (viola), Pierre Fourcade (violoncello), Sophie Deshayes (flute), Max Mausen (clarinet), Cathy Krier (piano), Louisa Marxen (percussion), Frin Wolter (accordion), André Feydy (trumpet), Julien Leroy (conductor), (electronics)\n\nComposers:\n\nFrancisco Alvarado - born in 1984 in Santiago de Chile, Chile\n\nAlvarado’s work focuses on the exploration of timbre, as the result of the analysis, manipulation and instrumentation of complex sounds, which - varied and transformed in time - attempt to create a poetical perception, within a musical discourse. The integration of the performing space and the performers' body as perceptual parameters, the use of live electronics as an extension of the instrument sonorities or the exploration of possible relationships between the written score and improvisation are important aspects of his music.\n\nFrancisco Alvarado studied composition at the Universidad Católica de Chile, then with Stefano Gervasoni at the Paris Conservatory. The encounter with Gervasoni, as well as other composers, such as Alberto Posadas, Philippe Manoury, Yan Maresz, Hèctor Parra or Brian Ferneyhough, were very important to forge a personal language and an original musical project. Alvarado attended the Cursus 1 & 2 at IRCAM in Paris between 2013 and 2015.\n\nHe collaborates with artists of his generation, conceiving new projects that gather common questions, including Florentin Ginot, Standardmodell, Achtung, the TNS school of theatre, Angèle Chemin, Marie-Claudine Papadopoulos, Violaine Debever, the Maja Ensemble or the C Barré ensemble.\n\nFrancisco Alvarado won the Musica Festival Academy’s prize and the CDMC prize at the INJUVE academy in Madrid.

He was artist in residence at the Camargo Foundation in 2017 and at the SWR ExpermientalStudio and GMEM Marseille in 2019/2020.\n\nMirela Ivicevic - born in 1989 in Split, Croatia\n\nHer work focuses mainly on exploration of reflective and subversive potential of sound, using bits and pieces of reality, abducted from their natural environment into a surreal acoustic world, resulting mostly in the patchwork of abruptly exchanging, hyperactive structures, distorted occurrences of post-yugoslavian reality, blocks of noise and traces of trip / hop? pop?\n\nMirela Ivicevic finished master studies in composition at the Music Academy Zagreb, postgraduate studies in Media composition at the MDW and postgraduate course in composition with Beat Furrer at the Kunstuniversität Graz.\n\nSince 2010 she is co-curator and producer of Dani Nove Glazbe Split, festival of contemporary music and related art forms in Split, Croatia. She is co-founder and member of Black Page Orchestra, viennese ensemble for radical and uncompromising music of current times.\n\nRaphaël Languillat - born in 1989 in Casablanca, Morocco\n\nRaphaël Languillat is a composer and multimedia artist oscillating between meditative stillness and explosive textures. His musical works merge acoustic instruments and electronic sounds in carefully crafted compositions, located at the intersection of spectral, drone and noise music. Working as a freelance filmmaker, he has a great interest in visual components, especially with art history, paintings and the “photographic” (still and moving images), integrating the later more and more in his newer works.\n\nRaphaël Languillat studied at the Kunsthochschule in Mainz, the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst in Frankfurt, Germany and the Université de Reims & Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional de Reims, France.\n\nHe has taken part in the academies of Festival Manifeste IRCAM and the festival Voix Nouvelles Royaumont. He is a 1st Prize winner at Prix Saint Christophe du Jeune Compositeur, the Young Composers Meeting YCM 2016 in the Netherlands and the Walter Witte Viola-Stiftung Kompositionswettbewerb in Germany.\n\nMore recently he has been nominated for the Gaudeamus Award 2018 in the Netherlands and the 2019 EU-Projekt DYCE in Italy. In 2020-21 he received a scholarship from the Mozart Stiftung von 1838 and from HAP Hessenweit for the period 2022-24, both in Frankfurt/Main.\n\n- Stefan Prins (BE, 1979) Inhibition Space #3 (2022) for percussion, saxophone and electronics -10’ *\n\n*Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\nThe Sixth Mass Extinction, which we are currently experiencing on Earth, is driven by human-induced feedback loops. One is between human activity and its ecological consequences. Another is within the ecosystem itself, where crossing a tipping point has set into motion an uncontrollable series of events that exponentially feed back into each other.\n\n- Patrick Muller (LU, 1978) dérivée (2021) for saxophone, viola and electronics - 12’\n\nSound performance presented at the Luxembourg pavilion of the EXPO2020DUBAI world exhibition.\n\nThe performance DÉRIVÉE blurs the borders between acoustic and digital sound generation, between poetry reading and music concert. The pieces are thematically based on poems by Anna Leader, Nico Helminger and Tom Nisse – poems that inspire the musicians' improvisation.\n\n- Roby Steinmetzer (LU, 1960) Miroir d’eau (2012) for viola and electronics - 6’\n\nMiroir d'eau is a very impressionistic music, inspired by the lights of Istanbul reflected in the waters of the Bosphorus. The viola is processed electronically in real time by passing the different components of the spectrum through an echo effect, where the delay time, number and amplitude of repetitions are set differently for each component. The auditory effect produced in this way is somewhat comparable to the reflection of an image on water. The repetitive play of the waves translates into a visual movement of dissolution and crystallization, the image distorting itself according to the oscillations and vibrations of the water surface.\n\n- Patrick Muller (LU, 1978) dérivée (2021) for percussion, saxophone and electronics - 12’\n\nThe computer is used as a musical sound processing tool, only processing in realtime – no prepared sounds, no playback, no automation.\n\n- Jug Marković (RS, 1987) rusty rose (2021) for flute, cello, percussion and electronics - 7’\n\nThe electronics in rusty rose are based on the manipulation of two audio files: a recording of Danilo Kiš’s poem Đubrište recited by vocal artist Thea Soti and barely recognizable particles of the madrigal Lamento della Ninfa by Claudio Monteverdi. The two files and their stretched bits merge into each other with different cross-synthesis techniques and mutate in the frequency domain.\n\nThe acoustic instrumental part is devoid of any grand soloistic gestures and its idea is to never take precedence and full attention over the electronics, but to merge into it subtly and intimately, as well as to imperceptibly underline the timbre and melancholic harmony of the rusty rose.\n\n- Igor C Silva (PT, 1989) Numb (2015) for baritone sax and electronics - 7’\n\nWe’re staring too long at screens, scratching our retinas and distorting perception.\n\n- Stefan Prins (BE, 1979) Inhibition Space #3 *\n\n*World Premiere - Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\nIn the series of compositions called Inhibition Space, instruments are augmented electronically with tiny microphones, its amplified sounds fed into loudspeaker placed just besides them, or transducers placed upon them. This creates a similar situation of (acoustic) feedback, which the musicians can manipulate at best, but never fully control. Opening a key of the instrument even slightly, might have dramatic sonic consequences in this fragile equilibirium. With the help of a digital system however, they can find ways to alter their musical behaviour, habits and reflexes sufficiently, to create a symbiosis between the human agent and its sonic environment.\n\n- Patrick Muller (LU, 1978) dérivée (2021) for percussion, viola and electronics - 12’\n\nWith: Danielle Hennicot (viola), Ingrid Schoenlaub (violoncello), Sophie Deshayes (flute), Olivier Sliepen (saxophone), Guy Frisch (percussion), Patrick Muller (live digital audio processing), Roby Steinmetzer (live electronics)\n\nComposers:\n\nStefan Prins - born in 1979 in Kortrijk, Belgium\n\nIn his compositional work Prins seeks to critique received convention, to break the framework of the usual, and dispose of aesthetic axioms. He envisions a musical art form beyond the safe confines of the »scene«, wherein the connection to the larger cultural discourse has gotten lost. A central precondition for the making of a new music with a future is the role of the aware, critical observer, one who is prepared to exploit the technologies and mechanisms of the prefabricated media with a view to their possibilities for new music.\n\nAfter graduating as an engineer, Stefan Prins studied piano and went on to study composition at the Royal Flemish Conservatory in Antwerp, Belgium, graduating magna cum laude. Concurrently, he studied “Technology in Music“ at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels,“Sonology“ at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, as well as “Philosophy of Culture” & “Philosophy of Technology” at the University of Antwerp. In 2017 he obtained a PhD in composition at Harvard University.\n\nHe regularly teaches workshops and masterclasses in festivals and is guest-professor Composition at the Hochschule für Künste Bern in the department of Theatre Musical, and appointed Professor of Composition and Director of the Hybrid Music Lab at the Hochschule für Musik “Carl Maria Von Weber” Dresden.\n\nHe received several important international awards, such as the “Berliner Kunstpreis für Musik”, “ISCM Young Composer Award”, and “Kranichsteiner Musikpreis für Komposition”. In 2014 he became laureate of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for the Sciences and Arts in the Class of the Arts.\n\nIn 2012 the “Union of Belgian Music Journalists” elected him \"Young Belgian Musician of the Year\".

He is particularly interested in stylistic heterogeneity, hybridity of genres and exploring / recontextualizing manners and sound gestures that have historically been charged with certain meaning and connotation. He is passionate about electronic music and its immense potential to juggle with genres and expectations.\n\nJug Marković holds a MA degree in composition from University of Arts in Belgrade and is also a graduate of archaeology from the University of Belgrade. He completed the IRCAM Cursus for composition and computer music and is now active both in the fields of acoustic, electro-acoustic and electronic music.

Tristano tours the world performing baroque and contemporary repertoire; records dance tracks for electronic music labels whilst continuing with his ambitious project of recording all of Johann Sebastian Bach’s piano repertoire; and makes albums woven from his own personal stories in which he explores the sensibility and tonal richness of the piano.\n\nHis simultaneous fascination for Bach’s clean tones and the rhythmic pulse of techno; his interest in the complex study of noise, effects and timbres made by composers like Cage or Ligeti; and the need to explore his own imagination through albums such as Idiosynkrasia (2010) or the recent Tokyo Stories (2019), can be traced back to his time as a student at New York’s Juilliard School.\n\nWhile at Juilliard, Francesco laid the groundwork of his ambitions as an interpreter of Bach’s music: he played and recorded the Piano Concertos with his ensemble The New Bach Players, as well as recording the Goldberg Variations (found on the small Accord label) on his own. Shortly after, he was signed by the French label Infiné, where he released his first records blending electronica and piano: Not for Piano (2007), where he created versions of techno anthems like Jeff Mills’ The Bells or Derrick May’s Strings of Life on the piano; Auricle Bio On (2008), where the piano is conceived as a sampler; and Idiosynkrasia (2010), in which he seamlessly joined his virtuosity on the keys and his programming prowess, refining his concept of “Piano 2.0,” where the instrument reaches a new textural iteration through the use of computers.\n\nTristano’s big leap took place in 2011, when he was signed by Deutsche Grammophon, with whom he recorded three programmes inspired by his ascent as a concert pianist of international acclaim. The first one was Bach/Cage (2011) – an exploration of the sonic space where Johann Sebastian Bach and John Cage’s music co-existed despite a distance of three centuries: the punctuation of emotion, the search for unusual textures, the surprising quality of the serendipitous.\n\nIn 2017, Francesco Tristano began his collaboration with Sony Classical, focusing his efforts on releasing his own work in a new phase as a recording artist. While still touring the world both as a pianist and as an electronic artist, performing in concert halls as well as experimental and dance music festivals, he returned to the piano as a tool for creation in Piano Circle Songs (2017), a collection of songs that evoke his interest for French impressionist composers. In his most recent album, Tokyo Stories (2019), he pays homage to Japan and captures the atmospheres and experiences accumulated throughout the years visiting the country as an artist and submerging himself in its culture.\n\nAnd still, at the edge of the horizon, Francesco Tristano’s great life project, the one he will never abandon, continues to takes shape: to record Johann Sebastian’s Bach complete repertoire. As Berg said, “music is music”, and Bach will always be there because he was the only creator ever to transcend it.\n\nIn 2004, he won the first prize at the International piano competition for contemporary music in Orléans, France.\n\n- Camille Kerger (LU, 1957) Treibsand (2022) for viola and saxophone - 10’*\n\nSeen superficially, quicksand appears in nature as a solid, load-bearing surface, which, however, can very quickly take on unimagined other forms. Camille Kerger wanted to achieve something similar in his music. By \"letting go\" while composing, he tried to explore and use new spaces and possibilities. Nevertheless, the overall impression of great formal unity should always be given.\n\n*Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture\n\n- Georges Aperghis (GR, 1945) Récitations 2, from the « quatres récitations pour violoncelle »(1980) cello solo - 5’\n\nAperghis’s work is notably characterized by a questioning about languages and the meaning. His compositions, wether instrumental, vocal or for stage, explore the borders of the intelligible, he likes to create twisted tracks which allow him to keep active the listener (stories emerge but are suddenly refuted)\n\n- Florent Caron Darras (FR, 1986) Rives (2020) for clarinet, saxophone, violin, cello - 12’\n\nCommissioned by Ensemble Ars Nova\n\nRives, pour ces lieux qui sont autant de points de contact entre le mobile et l’immobile.\n\nFlorent Caron Darras a voulu travailler dans ces courtes pièces quatre situations comme en micro-paysages: à matériaux réduits, feignant l’immobilisme, pourtant assurément portés dans un temps, conduits vers un devenir.\n\n- Philippe Manoury (FR, 1952) Sul Ciacona (2022) for string trio - 7’ *\n\n*Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture, with the support of the Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation\n\n\"Sul Ciacona\" is a development for string trio of \"Quasi una ciacona\" for solo viola, written for Danielle Hennicot. Originally it was a stage music for Philippe Manoury’s opera \"Kein Licht\" which was premiered by the ensemble United Instruments of Lucilin in 2017. I took most of the musical material from this piece for viola, but often modified it to fit the polyphonic writing of the trio. It consists of a kind of \"Passacaglia\" followed by a series of variations, each with its own musical character.\n\nWith: André Pons-Valdès (violin), Winnie Cheng (violin), Danielle Hennicot (viola), Ingrid Schoenlaub (violoncello), Max Mausen (clarinet), Olivier Sliepen (saxophone)\n\nComposers:\n\nCamille Kerger - born in 1957 in Luxembourg\n\nCamille Kerger thrives on collaborative work in all forms: creating and performing music, encouraging musicians of all backgrounds and genres to join together, working with refugees and their hosts, and exploring Luxembourg with others on bicycle and by foot.\n\nCompositions include: “Melusina”, chamber opera (1995), “Il Signor Drago”, opera for children (1995), “Rinderwahn”, opera (1999), “Ein Mond aus kochender Milch”, opera (2003) and “Altars of Light”, for choir and orchestra (2000), which was awarded first prize at the French competition L’an 1000.\n\nIn Camille Kerger’s hometown, the local music society had a spare trombone. As an 8-year-old Luxembourger, he embarked on a rich musical life that included playing, singing, composing and teaching. He studied at the Conservatoire de Luxembourg, Conservatoire de Metz, the Musikhochschule in Mannheim and the Musikhochschule in Düsseldorf.\n\nHe has been a member of the Luxembourg Society for the Propagation of Music and the Luxembourg Society for Contemporary Music (1983-2011). He is a founding member of the Théâtre National du Luxembourg (1996-2006) and was director of the Institut Europeen de Chant Choral (INECC) from 2004 to 2018.\n\nGeorges Aperghis - born in 1945 in Athens, Greece\n\nGeorge Aperghis’ work is notably characterized by a questioning about languages and their meaning. His compositions, whether instrumental, vocal or for stage, explore the borders of the intelligible; he likes to create twisted tracks that keep the listener attentive. Aperghis’ music is not strictly linked to any dominant musical aesthetics of the contemporary musical creation but tries to dialogue with other forms of art by being extremely open-minded to others. He innovates by including electronics, video, machines, automatons or robots to his performances. Aperghis likes to think of interpreters as being entirely part of the creative process. They are comedians, instrumentalists or vocalists. Since the 90’s he shared new artistic collaborations with dance companies and the visual arts. Many reputed european contemporary music ensembles have developed a working relationship with Aperghis through numerous commissions.\n\nEssentially self-taught, Georges Aperghis discovered music by listening to the radio and through piano lessons with a family friend. He discovered serialism through the Domaine Musical, along with the musique concrète of Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry, and the research of Iannis Xenakis, whose work inspired Aperghis’ own early works. By 1970, however, the composer had begun working on his own, much freer language. Georges Aperghis was awarded the Mauricio Kagel Music Prize 2011, the Venice Biennale Golden Lion in 2015, and the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Contemporary Music in 2016.\n\nFlorent Caron Darras - born in 1986 in Niigata Shi, Japan\n\nEqually sensitive to electronic and traditional music (notably Georgian, Iranian and Japanese music), Florent Caron Darras writes music that questions sonic models, harmony, ornaments, and attacks, inspired even in his titles by the relationships between humans, environment and technology.\n\nIt is with Gregorian singing and classical percussions that Florent C. Darras began his musical career. After his Master degree in research on contemporary Japanese music at Paris-Sorbonne, he studied at the Conservatoire de Paris (Cnsmdp) where his work was awarded with two Master degrees and four prizes in Composition (Stefano Gervasoni and Luis Naón's classes), Improvisation, Analysis (first class honour prize), and Aesthetics (first prize with congratulations for an essay about music and soundscape).\n\nAfter his studies, he started teaching at the Université catholique de l'Ouest and pursued research on Gregorian polyphony. He was selected to follow the Cursus program on composition and computer music at IRCAM. In 2019, he entered the Ph.D program SACRe of Université PSL, within the École Normale Supérieure doctoral school.\n\nFlorent C. Darras worked with numerous french ensembles (Intercontemporain, 2e2m, Court-Circuit, Sillages, etc.) and collaborated with conductors such as Matthias Pintscher, David Reiland, Léo Warynski, Jean Deroyer and Simon Proust. His music has been played on french radio stations and performed at venues such as Philharmonie de Paris, the Tokyo Philharmony Bunka Kaikan, Studio 104, and during festivals like ManiFeste, Présences, the Milano universal exhibitio and the festival Mixtur in Barcelona. He is supported by the Fondation de France, the Meyer Foundation, and the Sacem.\n\nPhilippe Manoury - born in 1952 in Tulle, France\n\nThe real-time interaction between acoustic instruments and computer-generated sounds is a topic that continues to influence Philippe Manoury’s artistic work and theoretical texts – not only in smaller works or compositions featuring electronics, but also with large orchestras. He constructs a sound laboratory where new interactive possibilities are tested, expanding music theatre as a form.\n\nHis oeuvre is comprised of many pieces for orchestra, string quartet, piano, and various instruments with electronics, as well as 5 operas. To cite some recent works, in Trilogie Köln, a large-scale spatial-orchestral project written for François-Xavier Roth and the Gürzenich Orchestra Cologne, he focused on rethinking the orchestra for new concert halls. In September 2021, Daniel Barenboim commissioned and premiered Das wohlpräparierte Klavier, a large piece for piano and live electronics, at the Boulez Saal in Berlin. In June 2022, Philippe Manoury celebrated his 70th birthday, which was and will be honoured with numerous concerts throughout the year.\n\nPhilippe Manoury is regarded as one of the most important French composers as well as a forerunner in the field of live electronics. At the age of 19, his works were already being performed at major festivals for new music. His compositional interest in mathematical models brought him to the Paris Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) where he worked on MAX-MSP, a programming language for interactive live electronics.\n\nHe is professor emeritus of the University of California San Diego where he taught composition from 2004 to 2012. In 2013, he was named Professor of Composition at the Académie Supérieure de la Haute École des Arts du Rhin in Strasbourg. From 2015 to 2018 he founded his own academy for young composers during Musica Festival (Strasbourg). In 2017 he was also a given the “Chaire Annuelle de Création Artistique” at Collège de France.\n\nPhilippe Manoury has received numerous awards. In 2014, he was named Officier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. He is a member of the honorary committee of the French-German Fund for Contemporary Music/Impuls Neue Musik. In 2015, he was elected as a member of the Berlin Akademie der Künste.\n\n- Alexander Müllenbach (LU, 1949) Capriccio (1994) violin solo - 4’\n\nThe Capriccio (per Niccolò Paganini) was written in 1994 at the instigation of the Russian violinist Elena Denissova, who ordered the work for a CD project with Capriccios by living composers.\n\nAlready during the first meeting, I heard in my inner self how the piece began to develop out of the beginning of Paganini's Capriccio N° 13 in A minor (...). The composition process was really quick; in just one day, (...) the piece was finished. Several violinists subsequently played the Capriccio, including Benjamin Schmid and the famous Ruggiero Ricci, who learned it by heart at the age of 80. The day before he left Europe for good to settle in California, he played it for me . I was amazed and delighted by the highly virtuosic, agile interpretation. Ricci then recorded it on CD a few days later in America. (Etablissement public Salle de Concerts, translated by Jil Hamm for United instruments of Lucilin)\n\n- 5’Claude Lenners (LU, 1956) Zenit (1990) for flute, violin and saxophone - 5’\n\nZenit was written in 1990 during Claude Lenners' stay at the Villa Medici in Rome. The nervous writing, the juxtaposition of voices and the proximity of the tessituras create a kind of tension between the three instruments (flute, violin and saxophone) and finally reach the “Zenit”.\n\n- Marco Pütz (LU, 1958) Salome’s Dance (2012) for Eb Alto Saxophone and violin - 6’\n\nDedicated to Mélina Zéléniuc\n\nLuxembourg premiere on 27th October 2013, Bourglinster Festival: “It evoked the different aspects of Salome's seductive dance; the play was ingenious, its dialogues full of freshness charmed by their fantasy” (Hilda van Heel 30.10.2013, translated by Jil Hamm for United Instruments of Lucilin)\n\n- Alexander Müllenbach (LU, 1949) Gesang des schwarzen Vogels (2002) clarinet solo - 3’\n\nThe song signifies a kind of contrast to Messiaen's phrase \"Abîmes des oiseaux”. The Black bird is a bird of doom and terror. The form is a kind of ritornello, where the opening theme returns several times in an obsessive manner. Great dynamic, figural and ambitorial contrasts characterise the sound.\n\n- Anne Castex (FR, 1993) De l’un à l’autre (2019) for flute, clarinet and saxophone (2019) - 5‘\n\nD’un son\n\nDe l’unique au complexe\n\nDu seul au multiple\n\nDe l’uni au bariolé\n\nDe l’entente au démêlé\n\nDe l’un détente à l’un tension\n\nDe l’autre brumeux à l’autre distinct\n\nAux autres\n\n- Garth Knox (IRL, 1956) No pitch, no Problem (2018) violin solo - 3’\n\nNo pitch, no problem is a study in noise. How to enjoy sounds without worrying about ‘right’ notes and ‘wrong’ ones, and how to give them meaning.\n\nWith: André Pons-Valdès (violin), Winnie Cheng (violin), Sophie Deshayes (flute), Max Mausen (clarinet), Olivier Sliepen (saxophone)\n\nComposers\n\nAlexander Müllenbach - born in 1949 in Luxembourg\n\nAs a solo pianist, chamber musician, song accompanist and occasionally as a conductor, he has been successful in concerts throughout Europe, Russia, Asia and overseas.In Alexander Müllenbach's work, French elements - such as pieces by the composers Olivier Messiaen and Henri Dutilleux - come together with the craft and ethics of the German Paul Hindemith and influences of the Viennese School.\n\nTonality, atonality, dodecaphony, serial and post-serial technique, ... function as a compositional basis in the play with contrasts and unpredictability, with dramatic eruptions and minimalist-lyrical structures, which are ultimately brought together to form an expressive unity.\n\nHe found his way to music at an early age. After studies in Metz and at the Paris Conservatoire, which he completed in 1969 as the best in the piano department, his path led him to Salzburg to the Mozarteum. After returning to Luxembourg, he taught composition at the Luxembourg Conservatoire from 1982 onwards; a whole generation of Luxembourg composers have studied with him. In parallel, he led a well-known composition class at the Mozarteum University in Salzburg, which later also included composition. In 2013, together with violinist Claude Krier and others, he founded Musicpublishers eV, which promotes the publication of works by Luxembourg composers. Today he lives and works in Salzburg.\n\nPrizes & Residences include the Erster Kompositionspreis des ORF Salzburg (1980), the Bernhard Paumgartner-Medaille (1981) and the Großer Lions-Preis des Herzogtums Luxemburg (1985).\n\nClaude Lenners - born in 1956 in Luxembourg\n\nClaude Lenners is composer of orchestral, chamber and vocal works and he is active as a promoter of new music. The titles of his pieces often originate in literature. A title is a borrowed idea, a challenge, a reinterpretation, a source of inspiration as well as an elective affinity. While he is composing, he likes to keep in mind the personality of the musicians he writes for. Another characteristic of his work is the advanced research in the domain of phrasing, inspired by his studies of the phonetic phenomena of spoken language.\n\nClaude Lenners studied music and musicology at Université des Sciences Humaines in Luxembourg and Strasbourg. He composed for various ensembles and many soloists have performed his works.\n\nCollaborations include dancer Guillaume Weis, stage manager Frank Hoffmann (Music Theatre TNL), Manuel Cano Lopez (HoMo XeRoX / Opera commissioned by Opera Tours and Dutilleux Prize Foundation).\n\nSince 1992, he teaches analysis, composition and computer music at the Luxembourg Conservatory. In 1999, he founded of the electronic music association Noise Watchers Unlimited and was artistic director of the new music festival Rainy Days in 2000-2005.\n\nHis honors include a scholarship to stay at the Villa Medici in Rome (1989-91), First Prize in the Henri Dutilleux Competition (1991), a scholarship to attend Darmstadt (1992), the First International Irino Prize for Chamber Music (Tokyo 1993), and the Lions Prize (Luxembourg section 1997).\n\nMarco Pütz - born in 1958 in Luxembourg\n\nSince 1987 he has composed more than 70 works, primarily for wind instruments and for Symphonic Wind Band, but also one musical for children, a string quartet, several compositions for chamber/symphonic orchestra and a number of educational pieces.\n\nMarco Pütz studied music (saxophone, chamber music, harmony, counterpoint, conducting) in Luxembourg-City, Brussels and Liège (Belgium). He has taught saxophone, chamber music and instrumentation for nearly 40 years at the Conservatory of Luxembourg. He is a founding member of the Luxembourg Saxophone Quartet (1982-2006) and has played with the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra. International reputation came in 1995 when he was awarded the first prize at the International Clarinet Association Composition Contest (Atlanta, USA) with his Quatuor pour clarinettes.\n\nHis works have been published by numerous publishers, such as DE HASKE/HAL LEONARD, H.LEMOINE, SEMPRE PIU EDITIONS and EDITION PETERS and recordings of his compositions have been released on Antes/Bella Musica (D), Bronsheim (NL), Amos (CH), Mirasound (NL), Mark Records (USA), GIA-Records (USA), Albany Records (USA), Doyen Records (GB). The music of Marco Pütz has been performed all throughout Europe, but also in Russia, USA, Canada, Australia and Asia.\n\nIn 2012 he was a finalist at the ITEA-Composition Contest with his compositions Five open-ended pieces and Chapters of Life/Tuba Concerto. In June 2017 the ‘Plaquette d’Honneur‘ of the UGDA (Union Grand-Duc Adolphe, Luxembourg) was awarded to him for his international achievements in wind band music. In October 2017, Marco received the prestigious ‘BUMA International Brass Award‘(NL) as an acknowledgment for his compositions, especially for wind/fanfare orchestra.\n\nAnne Castex - born in 1993 in Saint Gaudens, France\n\nDuring her Master's degree in Musicology, Anne Castex became interested in contemporary music and the creative process, and led her to try her hand at composition. In 2016, she started taking lessons in instrumental and electro-acoustic composition at the Toulouse Conservatory with Bertrand Dubedout, and became fascinated by this mode of expression. She obtained her Diploma of Musical Studies with honours in June 2019.\n\nShe is currently studying contemporary composition at the CNSMD of Lyon in the class of Michele Tadini and Martin Matalon. In 2022, she obtained her Bachelor's degree in mixed music with honours.\n\nGarth Knox - born in 1956 in Dublin, Ireland\n\nIIn 1998 he started to concentrate on his solo career and has given premieres, including pieces which were especially written for him. He also collaborates regularly in theatre and dance projects, and has written and performed a one-man show for children.\n\nHe has recently become a pioneer of the viola d’amore, exploring its possibilities in new music, with and without electronics, and is in the process of creating new repertoire for this instrument.\n\nBeing the youngest of four children who all played string instruments, he was encouraged to take up the viola and quickly decided to make this his career. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London where he won several prizes for viola and for chamber music. He played with most of the leading groups in London in a mixture of all repertoires, from baroque to contemporary music.\n\nIn 1983 he was invited to become a member of the Ensemble InterContemporain in Paris, which involved regular solo playing, including concertos directed by Pierre Boulez, and chamber music, touring widely and playing in international festivals.\n\nIn 1990 Garth Knox joined the Arditti String Quartet, which led him to play in all the major concert halls of the world, working closely with and giving first performances of pieces by most of today’s leading composers.\n\nGarth Knox now gives recitals, concertos and chamber music concerts all over Europe, the USA and Japan. He is also an active composer, and his «Viola Spaces », the first phase of an on-going series of concert studies for strings (published in 2010 by Schott) combines ground-breaking innovation in string technique with joyous pleasure in the act of music making.\n\nGarth Knox is Visiting Professor of viola at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\n\n- Mirela Ivicevic (HR, 1980) SELFLOVE I (2017) tape / acousmatic pieces - 5,5’\n\nMade from *Her absence filled the world* for string orchestra (2017)\n\n- Ângela Da Ponte (PT, 1984) Homenagem Subconsciente (2015) stereo fixed medium - 7,5’\n\n“Translated as Subconscious Hommage this work explores the juxtaposition and interaction of various elements that are currently my interest of research: the use of traditional activities/songs from S.Miguel Island (the Azores) and its integration in electroacoustic context. The material explored in this piece is a mixed of field recordings of festivities in my homeland (the Azores), studio processed based sounds and analog synthesis. The main concept behind this piece is the one of framing stories (similar to 1001 Arabian Nights) where the main story unfolds different little stories with different characters.” - Ângela Da Ponte\n\n- Fátima Fonte (PT, 1983) Claro-escuro (2008) tape / acousmatic pieces, for electronics - 6’\n\n“This piece has departed from an audio format considered “less sophisticated” - the general midi – with the goal of creating several variables to give it a more personal and characteristic sonority. The title comes from the subtleties and variations that exist within a black and white tool.” - Fátima Fonte\n\n- Annette Vande Gorne (BE, 1946) Bois (1986) acousmatic pieces - 12’\n\nBois, whose writing is based on proliferation and 'shuffling' [a SYTER sound processing technique], is part of a more general research on nature as a model, a very old functioning of the human mind brought up to date in the context of computer modelling (in computer graphics for example).\n\nMirela Ivicevic - born in 1989 in Split, Croatia\n\nHer work focuses mainly on exploration of reflective and subversive potential of sound, using bits and pieces of reality, abducted from their natural environment into a surreal acoustic world, resulting mostly in the patchwork of abruptly exchanging, hyperactive structures, distorted occurrences of post-yugoslavian reality, blocks of noise and traces of trip / hop? pop?\n\nMirela Ivicevic finished master studies in composition at the Music Academy Zagreb, postgraduate studies in Media composition at the MDW and postgraduate course in composition with Beat Furrer at the Kunstuniversität Graz. Since 2010 she is co-curator and producer of Dani Nove Glazbe Split, festival of contemporary music and related art forms in Split, Croatia. She is co-founder and member of Black Page Orchestra, viennese ensemble for radical and uncompromising music of current times.\n\nÂngela Da Ponte - Portuguese composer born in 1984\n\nÂngela Da Ponte holds a PhD from the University of Birmingham (UK). She is a composer and teacher currently living in Porto, Portugal. Her music has been regularly performed in Portugal by Remix Ensemble, Sond-Ar’te Electric Ensemble, among others, as well internationally with BEAST (Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre, UK), Orchestre National d’Île de France, in Mexico (Festival Visiones Sonoras 2016), Poland (Audiokineza), Colombia (BLAST), U.S.A with the Oregon Symphony, Vertixe Sonora Ensemble (Spain) and Ensemble New Babylon (Germany).In 2011, she was appointed as the Young Composer in Residence 2011 at Casa da Música (Oporto), writing for Orquestra Sinfónica do Porto and Remix Ensemble.\n\nFátima Fonte - born in 1983 in Portugal\n\nIn recent years she has been working intensely on staged music. One of her main works – the opera buffa “A Querela dos Grilos” (libretto by Tiago Schwäbl) – has been presented in numerous Portuguese theatres.\n\nFátima Fonte studied composition in Porto (ESMAE) and at the Conservatory of Music of Amsterdam, with Richard Ayres. Thanks to a scholarship from Fundação Oriente, she was able to study Hindustani Music in India. In 2017-18 she was a Young Composer Associate at Teatro Nacional São Carlos, collaborating with dancers, choreographers, singers and instrumentalists, besides premiering Era Uma Vez Eu-Alface, for narrator and Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa.\n\nPerformances of her music have been given by the Nieuw Ensemble (Concertgebouw Amsterdam / Den Bosh), Icarus Ensemble (Italy / Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival UK), Orkest de Ereprijs (Young Composers Meeting Apeldoorn / Gaudeaumus Music Week NL).\n\nIn 2019 Orquestra Gulbenkian performed Breve Desassossego as part of the “Composing for voices” workshop, and Duo Tágide premiered Coração Acordeão (commissioned by Miso Music Portugal).\n\nCurrently Fonte is a doctoral student at Guildhall School of Music and Drama (London).\n\nRoland Wiltgen - born in 1957 in Differdange, Luxembourg\n\nHe wrote various chamber, piano, and choir music, several pieces for Brass-Band (e.g. \"Red Earth\" the test-piece for the European Championship 1995), 3 pieces for symphonic wind band, 2 works for organ, brass wind ensemble, clarinet sextett and pedagogical works. His interest in electronics and computer technologies have brought forth some compositions using that medium.\n\nHe started his musical training at the Conservatory of Esch-sur–Alzette while at the same time pursuing his classical secondary school education. Next steps were the Metz Conservatoire de musique in Metz, the Paris Ecole Normale de Musique and the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris\n\nIn 1983 he became a professor for harmony, counterpoint and musical analysis at the Conservatory of Esch-sur-Alzette. Since 1981 he has produced some 70 works, many of which have been commissioned and performed by famous musicians. Having always played an active part in the consultative bodies of Sacem Luxembourg, he became a founding member and the first president of the Fédération Luxembourgeoise des Auteurs et Compositeurs (FLAC) in 2014.\n\nAnnette Vande Gorne - born in 1946 in Charleroi, Belgium\n\nHer current work focuses on various energetic and kinesthetic archetypes. Nature and the physical world are models for an abstract and expressive musical language. She is passionate about two other fields of research: the various relationships to word, sound, and meaning provided by electroacoustic technology, and the composition of space seen as the fifth musical parameter and its relationship to the other four parameters and the archetypes being used. Her work falls essentially in the acousmatic category.\n\nFollowing her classical studies at the Royal Conservatories of Mons and of Brussels, and her studies with Jean Absil, Annette Vande Gorne chanced upon acousmatics when on a training position in France. Instantly convinced, by the works of François Bayle and Pierre Henry, of the revolutionary nature of this art form (disruption of perception, renewal of composition through spectromorphological writing and listening conduction, historical importance of the movement), she took a few training positions to grab its basics, then studied musicology (ULB, Brussels) and electroacoustic composition with Guy Reibel and Pierre Schaeffer at the Conservatoire national supérieur in Paris.\n\n- Filippo Zapponi (IT, 1976) ReCoding Cloud (2022) for youtuber/soloist and ensemble, recorded and broadcast on screen in the form of YouTube videos - 40’ *\n\n*World Premiere - Commissioned by United Instruments of Lucilin for the project 33,7 - Esch2022 European Capital of Culture\n\nA cycle of seven compositions/performances\n\nReCoding Cloud is a cycle of seven compositions/performances for soloist/youtuber and ensemble, recorded and broadcast on screen in the form of YouTube videos. The videos are gathered on the YouTube channel ReCoding Cloud. The cycle is based on hybridisation, the creation of genetically modified musical organisms, fakes, (concealed) parody, double coding and re-coding. It is up to the listener/viewer to decode the compositions correctly, to grasp the hidden references, not to stop at appearances and not to be fooled by fakes.\n\nWith: André Pons-Valdès (violin), Winnie Cheng (violin), Danielle Hennicot (viola), Jean Philippe Martignoni (violoncelle), Païvi Kauffmann (flute), Max Mausen (clarinet), Léna Kollmeier (piano), Guy Frisch (percussion), Danilo Vicari (e-guitar), Marco Fabricci (e-bass), Serge Kakudji (voice)\n\nComposer: Filippo Zapponi - born in 1976 in Milan, Italy\n\nFilippo Zapponi collaborates with many ensembles, soloists and festivals and has undertaken many musical projects with pedagogical purposes. He began composing as a child and at the age of seventeen he entered the classes of Ivan Fedele and Giorgio Colombo Taccani at the Civica Scuola di Musica di Milano and at the Sezione di Musica Contemporanea, in Milan. In 1997, he was enrolled in Ivan Fedele's class at the Como Conservatory of Music “Giuseppe Verdi” and graduated with honours in 2000. Since 1997 he was also a student of Ivan Fedele at the Conservatoire National de Région de Strasbourg (France) where he graduated in 2001. In 1999-2001 he was Ivan Fedele's assistant and he worked at Luciano Berio's Centro Tempo Reale, in Florence.\n\nIn 2001, he studied at the Session de composition du programme “Voix nouvelles” at the Fondation Royaumont, near Paris. In 2002, he was again Ferneyhough's student at the Centre Acanthes (Avignon, France).\n\nSelected twice by the Ircam Reading Panel, he attended the Stage d'été (2006) and the Cursus I (2008-09) at Ircam (Paris) where he specialized in new technologies for music.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007, he studied composition and analysis in Kürten, near Cologne (Germany).

Undoubtedly. Is it a play about the strange relationship between people and their computers? Likewise (after all, among other things, quite a few annoying spam mails are given musical honours in it). Is it experimental literature? Certainly, at least in part, because one of the actors from the Oulipo circle of authors around Raymond Queneau and Georges Perec is involved in it. Is it film music for an abstract film with letters instead of actors? In a way, that too (as Pascal Schumacher says? \"Film music is cooler to write than other music anyway.\"). When jazz musician and composer Pascal Schumacher, typographer Michel Welfringer and writer Ian Monk join forces to write variations on CTRL (control? the control key? the sounds C, T, R and L? the letters?) for the ensemble United Instruments of Lucilin, a kind of controlled loss of control is preprogrammed.”\n\n(Philharmonie Luxembourg 2009, translated by Jil Hamm for United Instruments of Lucilin)\n\nWith: Léo Belthoise (violin), Sophie Urhausen (viola), Jean Philippe Martignoni (violoncelle), Sophie Deshayes (flute), Max Mausen (clarinet), Pascal Meyer (piano), Guy Frisch (percussion), Pit Brosius (conductor)\n\nComposer: Pascal Schumacher - born in 1979 in Luxembourg\n\nAesthetics: He played with many exciting musicians such as Francesco Tristano, Bachar Mar-Khalifé, Jef Neve, Kenny Barron & Magic Malik. He wrote music for theater and film and led a jazz quartet. His music mixes emotional classical music with minimal electronic sounds, although Schumacher himself considers each classification obsolete. To him, music is a single, limitless playground.\n\n2018 marked a new beginning for Pascal Schumacher, who upon the invitation to play at Jazz & The City Festival In Salzburg, started to develop his own solo material. This eventually culminated in his debut solo album, SOL, released on Neue Meister in 2020 followed by another album called LUNA in 2022. Despite the contrasts, SOL and LUNA aren’t in any way antagonistic to each other, much on the contrary, their duality feels wholly complementary, expressing a natural musical progression much like daytime gently feeds into the night.\n\nAbout: Pascal Schumacher studied classical percussion, jazz vibraphone and musicology at music conservatories in Luxembourg, Strasbourg, Brussels and The Hague. He holds a Master’s Degree in musicology from the Marc Bloch University in Strasbourg, and another in music with a focus on jazz vibraphone from the Koninklijk Conservatorium in The Hague.\n\nPascal is a Yamaha Artist and a Professor for Jazz and Classical Percussion at the Conservatoire de Musique de Luxembourg. He is the Artistic Director of the innovative 'Reset' Music Festival at Abbaye Neimenster and an Ambassador for SOS Children's Villages International - Luxembourg.\n\nHe has won many awards, including the Belgian Django d’Or (2005), Music:LX (2012), ECHO Jazz (2012), JTI Trier Jazz (2014), was selected for the Rising Stars program organized by the European Concert Hall Organization (2009 / 10) and appeared as soloist in ECHO Klassik 2017 awarded project Überbach.\n\nElsa Biston (FR, 1978) Prendre corps (2020) installation for vibrating object device - 60’\n\n\"At the beginning, the eye is taken up by the beauty of the objects, the play of light and vibration, the ear follows the gaze, lagging a little behind... Little by little, however, the gaze gives way: the character-objects become so familiar to us in their physical characteristics, their materiality, their ability to vibrate, to murmur, to sing, that they become a part of us. (...)\n\nWhen \"Prendre corps\" ends, we are no longer quite the same: our eyes seek out the character-objects that have become silent, while our whole being vibrates, from head to toe. \"Prendre corps\" certainly takes us far away, and draws a sound \"cartography\" like no other! (Anne Montaron for Hémisphere Son, on the occasion of the creation of the performance version at the theatre in Vanves, translated by Jil Hamm for United Instruments of Lucilin)\n\nElsa Biston - Conception, composition\n\nStéfane Perraud - Collaboration artistique\n\nComposer: Elsa Biston - born in 1978 in Lyon, France\n\nElsa Biston is a composer of electroacoustic and instrumental music.\n\nShe has written for the ensemble l'Instant Donné, for the Spat'sonore, as well as music for shows and installations.
