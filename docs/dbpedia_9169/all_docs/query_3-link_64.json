National Public Radio Senior Commentator Martin Goldmith says he owes his life to an Orchestra that disappeared long before he was born. During the 1930s in Germany the Kulturbund orchestra, staffed entirely by Jewish musicians, was used as a Nazi propaganda weapon. Goldsmith tells the story of the Kulturbund in his book The Inextinguishable Symphony. He told Minnesota Public Radio's Tom Crann it is part of the very personal story of his family. Until recently, he didn't even realize how his parents met. And they almost didn't. His father, a flutist, was within days of fleeing the country. Martin Goldsmith is a familiar name to NPR's Performance Today audience. The senior commentator is best known for his eloquence in communicating the language of music. But Goldsmith has now written his family's poignant story, telling how music communicates, even above the loudest hatred.\n\nThe talk is sponsored by the Dr. Jeffrey Weingarten Memorial Fund for Holocaust Education.\n\nLocation: St Paul Jewish Community Center, 1375 St. Paul Avenue St. Paul, MN 55116\n\nFor more information, call 651-698-0751.\n\nApril 5, 2001, 7:00p.m.\n\n\"No More Rwandas.\" A survivor of the Rwandan genocide, Alphonse Nkunzimana is a Rwandan national living in the United States who will be speaking about the genocide.

The Twin Cities has had a long history of welcoming immigrants and refugees from harrowing circumstances, many of whom have suffered under political oppression, including torture.

How should international human rights obligations affect state responsibility regarding the transfer and use of small arms and light weapons? Does the increased availability of weapons constitute a proximate cause of violations of human rights and humanitarian law? What further national and international standards or actions are needed to address human rights violations that result from the misuse of small arms and light weapons? This groundbreaking conference aims to bring together the human rights and arms control movements to strategize about legal and diplomatic means to curb the human rights violations that result from the arms trade. The Human Rights Program and the European Studies Consortium at the University of Minnesota organized the conference. The objectives of the Human Rights Program, which was established in fall 2001, include bringing together faculty, students, and international human rights experts to create opportunities for research and action on issues of common interest. The public program will take place on Friday morning, February 22, at the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs on the campus of the University of Minnesota. The public event will also feature members of the domestic gun control movement in the United States, including a keynote address by Mary Leigh Blek, National Director of Million Mom March.\n\nLocation: Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs\n\nFor more information on the symposium and registration forms, see http://esc.cla.umn.edu/ArmsAvailability.htm.\n\nFebruary 23-24, 2002\n\nUpper Midwest Connection at the University of Minnesota Law School. This is a weekend long exchange of information and ideas designed to strengthen our abilities to work together as members of Amnesty International-USA's Midwest region. As Amnesty International faces the challenges of defending human rights in a period of rapid globalization and the post Sept. 11th \"New World Order,\" what has been and will continue to be the backbone of this organization is the power of its grassroots activism. The Upper Midwest Connection will focus on harnessing this power to continue to strengthen this region. We do so as we stand shoulder to shoulder with our fellow activists across this country and around the globe. Strength comes in numbers. So too can knowledge, understanding, and unity. On Feb. 23rd and 24th we will share our knowledge, broaden our understanding, and become more united. Please join us! Pre-registration is not required (except for free housing), but it will help us to make the conference more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nFor registration and more info.

The Sudan spans territory greater than all of Western Europe. This enormous African nation is richly diverse in geography and climate, race and ethnicity, history and religioun, and is characterized by a largely Islamic north and largely animist and Christian south. Yet since independence from Great Britian in 1956, the Sudan's diversity has largely been a cruse. Armed conflict and related famines have claimed two million Sudanese lives since the start of its second civil war in 1983. Recent expansions in its globally connected oil industry supplies the Sudanese government even more means and motivation for its continued assault on southern peoples. The Sudanese Symposium at Macalester College brings together four leading experts on the Sudan's ongoing war: Francis M. Deng, a renowned scholar who is Sudan's former minster of state; Jemera Rone, the Sudan expert at Human Rights Watch; Abdullahi A. An-Na'im, a distinguished northern Sudanese legal scholar of Islam and human rights; and Donald Petterson, a top State Departments Africanist who formerly served as U.S. ambassador to Sudan. The two-day conferenc, highlighted also by public responses by Macalester faculty and students, will grapple with questions of identity, religion, violence, the state, and hitory - all in the context of the future of southern Sudan.\n\nFree and open to the public.\n\nLocation: Weyerhaeuser Memorial Chapel, on Grand Avenue just West of Snelling Avenue, Saint Paul.\n\nMarch 7-9, 2002\n\nThe Great Plains Migrations 26th Annual Symposium.

Prof. Duster is Professor of Sociology at New York University and Director of the American Cultures Center at the University of California, Berkeley, where is he also Chancellor's Professor of Sociology. He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Committee on Germ-Line Intervention and has been a member of the Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences. From 1995-98, he served as member and then chair of the joint NIH/DOE advisory committee on Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues in the Human Genome Project (the ELSI Working Group). Publications include Cultural Perspectives on Biological Knowledge (1984) and Backdoor to Eugenics (1990), a book on the social implications of the new technologies in molecular biology. Regarding his presentation, Prof. Duster writes, \"In recent years, a consortium of scientists across a range of disciplines have declared that the concept of race is of no utility in science. However, there have been simultaneous developments in the practical uses of the new molecular genetics technologies in medicine and law that indicate just how difficult it will be to purge science, medicine, and clinical genetics of an idea that is so deeply embedded in the routine practices, the practical applications, and the ever-recurring 'proxies for race.' In medicine, the new field of pharmacogenomics is attempting to fine-tune the delivery of drugs to specific populations based upon DNA profiles--ethnicity and race primary among them. In law, forensic science is moving ahead to use genetic markers to predict whether a criminal suspect is from a particular ethnic or racial group. This presentation will examine some of the social and political implications of these developments.\"\n\nFor more information call 612-625-0055\n\nLocation: William G.

Many protesters, especially women, have been targeted by Indian police for peacefully protesting the environmentally destructive Narmada Valley Development Project. The Narmada Valley Development Project is a large series of dams for a hydro-electric project that threatens destroy valuable forests and agricultural lands, wipe out biodiversity, and displace 1.5 million people. The local populations speaking out against it have been subject to police arrest and beatings while their concerns about inadequate relocation plans have been ignored. As part of our Just Earth! campaign to defend those who defend the environment we will be hosting speaker Patrick McCully, Campaigns Director of International Rivers Network, who has worked closely with this issue for many years. Please join us to find out more about this pressing issue, and find out what you can do about it.\n\nLocation: University of Minnesota, Ford Hall, Room 150\n\nFor more information: call 612-301-0768 or email amnesty@waste.org\n\nMarch 16 � May 5, 2002\n\nSilent Witness: Genocide in the Landscape. Silent Witness: Genocide in the Landscape is a photography exhibition featuring work that addresses how the landscape holds on to evidence of atrocities committed on it. We discovered the work of Simon Norfolk collected in his book For most of it I have no words: Genocide � Landscape � Memory. The title is a quote from Edward R. Morrow upon viewing the horror of Buchenwald just after World War Two. Likewise, without words, his landscapes describe the horror of eight sites where genocide occurred in the 20th century. The photographs are sequenced chronologically from latest incident in Rwanda proceeding back through time until the crime against the Herero in the Namibia desert. Covered between those two are the incidents in Cambodia, Vietnam, Auschwitz, Dresden, the Ukraine and Armenia. The photographs document the relentless march of entropy as it works to erase the evidence of the crimes and with it the persistence of memory; it is nature returning to its innocence. But can the landscape, or can we, ever return to innocence? Despite their haunting beauty, the essence of what happened in these landscapes still remains, referring metaphorically to the indelible scars these acts have left on our collective psyche.\n\nWe will also present work by Keith Holmes, who extensively photographed people and places throughout Croatia and Bosnia following the conflict in these areas during the 1990s. He printed these images on bricks that were coated with photo emulsion and reconstructed them into sections of destroyed walls. The resulting \"Brick by Brick\" project metaphorically speaks to the fragmentation of the individual psyche and the shattering of the ethnic identity of a people subjected to \"ethnic cleansing\".\n\npARTs also commissioned new work informed by the landscapes where mass killings took place during genocidal conflicts European Americans waged on Native Americans in the 19th century. Photographer Doug Beasley visited Wounded Knee South Dakota, the site of the mass hangings of the Dakota at Mankato, Minnesota in 1862, and the site where the U.S. Army distributed smallpox infected blankets to Native peoples, possibly the first instance of biological warfare in\n\nLocation: history. Instead of making landscape documents of these places, Beasley seeks out the small and simple acts of devotion that contribute to the sacredness of the site.\n\nLocation: pARTs Photographic Arts, 711 West Lake Street, Minneapolis, MN 55408\n\nFor more information: 612-824-5500 www.partsphoto.org\n\nAdmission: $3\n\nMay 9, 2002, 5:00 p.m. Reception\n\n\"Slavery Reparations\".

The conference will present two lectures and discussions open to the public, both in Cowles Auditorium, Humphrey School, West Bank, University of Minnesota:\n\nFriday, May 10, 3:00 reception, 3:30-5 lecture Claudia Koonz, \"Engendering Ethnic Warfare\" Claudia Koonz is professor of history at Duke University. She is the author of Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family and Nazi Politics. Claudia Koonz will use Rwanda in the 1990s and Germany in the 1930s as sites within which to examine the state-sponsored diffusion of knowledges about \"others.\" Against the promise of authenticity held out by gendered ethnic identity, she will look at the claims of citizenship embodied in human rights discourses. A comparison of victim memory in post-genocidal Rwanda and Israel will set the stage for further discussions of the dilemmas inherent in each of the three sessions of this conference.\n\nSaturday, May 11, 3:30-5:30 Gender and South Asian Nationalism Ritu Menon, \"Muslim Women and Citizenship in India\" Ritu Menon is an Indian writer and activist and co-founder of Kali for Women, India's first feminist publishing house, in New Delhi. She is the co- author of Borders & Boundaries: Women in India's Partition (1998), and has co-edited several anthologies of women's writing in translation.\n\nThere will also be workshop sessions where participants discuss papers which have been circulated in advance. How does a gender analysis transform our understanding of politics in a comparative perspective? This conference looks at the fields of knowledge that open up when feminist analyses move beyond our initial task, which was including women in the body politic, to examine how gender and sexuality lend meaning and materiality to such fundamental notions as citizenship, national identity, and national mission. Speakers will explore how gender and sexuality mobilize ethnic and national violence. The conference will also examine how citizenship reproduces normative genders and sexualities and how it can be turned against such norms. We look at how gender and sexuality transform human rights and civil rights goals, and how those projects are at once an excuse for nation building and a means to contest national identities and boundaries. Cultural citizenship, cultural production and consumption as practices of nation-building and resistance to national power will also be a focus.\n\nTo register for the workshop sessions: please send $10 (which will cover coffee, snacks and lunch on Saturday) by April 28, to CAFS, 425 Ford Hall/224 Church St. SE Minneapolis, MN 55455-0110.\n\nFor more information, email CAFS at or call Susie Bullington at 612-624-0305.\n\nOrganized by the Center for Advanced Feminist Studies, and sponsored and funded by the Institute for Global Studies and the Humanities Institute, additional funds from the Center for German and European Studies, the European Studies Consortium, the History Department and the Center for Austrian Studies.\n\nUpcoming Fall Events\n\nMay 29, 2002, 7:00 p.m.\n\nPublic Lecture and Book Signing \"Teaching for Unity and Diversity in a Time of National Crisis\" .

This is a lecture on the state of Armenia held in conjunction with a conference on the Armenian Diaspora at the University of Minnesota. Richard G. Hovannisian is the leading historian of modern Armenia in the United States. For many years he has been Professor of Armenian and Near Eastern History at the University of California, Los Angeles. His multi-volume study, The Republic of Armenia, was pathbreaking when its first part was published in 1971 and has since become the standard work in the field. He has written or edited many other books, including The Armenian Genocide in Perspective (1986), and has published more than sixty scholarly articles. Prof. Hovannisian has been honored with many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1982, he was honored by His Holiness Karekin II of the Great House of Cilicia with the Medal of St. Mesrop Mashtots for his advancement of Armenian studies. In 1998, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the first Armenian republic in 1918, he was presented the Movses Khorenatsi (primary classical Armenian historian) medal and award by the Republic of Armenia.

Designed to have resonance with while not attempting to memorialize the events of September 11, the symposium focuses on two artistic sites that bring together Arab and Jewish participants. Both sites animate the complex relationships of place and identity in Israel/Palestine, a terrain in which modernist notions of the nation-state no longer adequately address connections among territory, ethnos, and state.\n\nThe symposium will take place on Friday September 13 and Saturday September 14 in the Thrust Theater of Rarig Center at the University of Minnesota. Friday, September 13 features an evening showing of Peace of Mind, a documentary created by Palestinian and Israeli youth who spent several weeks together at the Seeds of Peace summer camp in Maine. The award-winning documentary, filmed and edited by the youth under the guidance of the Global Action Project, tracks a year in the their lives between 1997-98. One of the featured youth, Amer Kamal, a Palestinian student now living in the US, will speak following the showing.\n\nOn Saturday, September 14, guest artist Gaby Aldor will present on her work with the Hebrew-Arabic Theater of Jaffa, Israeli. The theater is one of the few in the region bringing together Palestinian and Jewish Israelis. Aldor will discuss the theater's latest project, Longing/Exile at Home, a collaboratively developed site-specific piece exploring diaspora, space, and memory with a group of Jewish and Arab Israeli performers. The production, featured in the New York Times, recently won an award as the best performance and play of the year in Israel. Both Peace of Mind and Aldor's presentation on Longing will be followed by University of Minnesota respondents from a variety of disciplines including theater arts, dance, visual arts, political science, cultural studies, Anthropology, Jewish studies, and geography. The event is co-sponsored by the Arts Quarter, the Space and Place Research Group of the Humanities Institute, and the Institute for Global Studies with support from Jewish Studies.\n\nFor further information contact Sonja Kuftinec at 612-626-9238 or skuftinec@aol.com.\n\nSeptember 18, 2002\n\nEnvironmental Opportunities in Central & Eastern Europe.
