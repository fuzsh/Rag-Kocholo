        "text": "Silver spoon and bottle fed\n\nThe Daily Mail is always read\n\nBy young conservatives born to win\n\nAnother world you’re living in\n\nJust like your parents and theirs before\n\nYou and your children won’t go to war\n\nThe front line ain’t the place for you\n\nYou still believe your blood is blue\n\nThe British empires sons and daughters\n\nWho flirt with SDP supporters\n\nShare nightmares about Tony Benn\n\nThe militants on News At Ten\n\nYou’re born to rule or so you say\n\nChurch of England all the way\n\nThe book that features Adam and Eve\n\nThese are the things that you believe\n\nLove and respect for King and Queen\n\nNational service at seventeen\n\nMary Whitehouse morals too\n\nA Barbara Cartland novel view\n\nThese are the things that you support\n\nThe working class they must be taught\n\nHow lucky they are to be free\n\nTo live in your democracy\n\nWith a free press and radio\n\nBut we’re four million on the dole\n\nJust like the days before the war\n\nThe Tory party still stands for\n\nMass unemployment and poverty\n\nA them and us society\n\nWith no free press to speak the truth\n\nOnly the voice of the Tory youth\n\nThe House of Lords the dead and old\n\nThe wealth the power the land they hold\n\nThe red the white the Tory blue\n\nThe young conservatives I hate you\n\nGarry Johnson\n\nGarry Johnson’s poem was written in 1983 and has been read at several Stand Up and Spit gigs. The recording of it from the Son Of Oi album has played too. It is one of the most popular of the original ranting poems with the young audience today. They often comment that it might have been written yesterday.\n\nI wrote Young Conservatives because I hate both Conservatives and `Young Conservatives` fresh out of public schools and Oxbridge who have the cheek to look down on their `elders and betters`: the heroic working class parents who work all hours to provide for there children.\n\nWhat right have Conservatives or `young conservatives` to look down their noses or to tell them how to think or what to do?\n\nI have always been a man of the left, but never thought of myself as a `leftie`. I prefer the title of working class liberal with middle class manners.\n\nLike The Kray Twins I never swear in front of women and children – but would break the habit of a lifetime if I ever met the Queen or Samantha Cameron.\n\nUnlike Reg & Ron I have not murdered anyone – but if I met IDS or George Osbourne down a dark alley I might be tempted.\n\nI have in spirit always been a Labour supporter rather then a voter. I could not bring myself to vote for Blair, Brown. Burnham but Jeremy Corbyn has changed all that.\n\nWhen Jezza`s elected leader I will both vote and campaign for Labour.\n\nYoung Conservatives was as the title says an `attack` on young conservatives but it was also an attack on the `Red Tories` who`ve been in charge of Labour since Kinnock through to Milliband.\n\nI`ve never understand why or how people like Blair, Mandelson, Thornberry, Brown, Kendall and the Labour Establishment have claimed to talk for working class people. Never understood how they got away with it. Quite rightly Black people have Black leaders, Gays have Gay spokesman, Jewish people have Jewish leaders and the Scottish people have Nicola Sturgeon. Well I want a genuine man of the people to represent me and that man is Jeremy Corbyn. I wish he didnt have a beard and look like a social worker.\n\nBut that is the Mod in me. That is fashion, not political mod.\n\nI am more left-wing then any champagne socialist in Notting Hill.\n\nMy wish is that when Corbyn is elected `red tories` like Mandelson, David Milliband, Thornberry, Blair and all the other `champagne socialists` leave the party.\n\nI would love Corbyn to produce a manifesto that promises to abolish The House Of Lords and the Royal Family. A manifesto that promised to put Blair on trial as a war criminal.\n\nI have the same feelings today as when I wrote `Young Conservatives’.\n\nBack then I hated Thatcher and all her mob and today I hate Cameron and his cronies. Young conservatives, old conservatives and New Labour are all pretty much the same. The main thing they have in common is that they all dislike and mistrust the Working Class.\n\nGarry Johnson\n\nAdvance copies of Attila the Stockbroker’s autobiography ‘Arguments Yard’ are now available direct from him, signed if you like. 35 years, 24 countries, over 3000 gigs – his life in words.

The band soon took to gigging after 15 year old Stinky Turner had finished school, failing all his exams in the process. They quickly built up a huge following and capped their first year in existence with the 5 star “Greatest Hits Volume 1”. Now almost three years later, with 4 albums tucked under their braces, they’re almost at the crossroads. Do they keep on plugging away at the old style, or as the new album suggests, a change in tactics.\n\nMicky: The new album, it’s more of the same sort of thing but refined. We’ve spent £27,000 on it and like £11,000 of it went to the producer (Steve Churchyard, U.F.O, Stranglers) where as before we used to skimp and do 14 tracks in 2 weeks in some poxy studio. We’ve skinted ourselfs doing it, (“YET ANOTHER CASE OF DOING IT FOR THE KIDS!”) but it was worth it ‘cos it’s the best Rejects album.\n\nSo it’s more of a natural progression than a change?\n\nMicky: Yeah! it’s not a drastic change.\n\nHas this just happened over a period of time?\n\nMicky: Yeah, well Sticks has come into the band and he’s got more room to develop musically with us than with the Upstarts, so he’s added to the ideas of the band. We didn’t sit down and decide we were gonna change, it’s like you say “a natural progression”.\n\nDo you think success came your way too soon, 2 albums in a year, Top of the Pops and all that, or did you like it coming that way?\n\nMicky: Well we liked it coming that way because we weren’t into slogging it, we were very lucky.\n\nYou had a lot of good press in the beginning especially from Garry Bushell?\n\nMicky: Yeah, now he thinks the 4-Skins are the biggest thing since sliced bread.\n\nDo you think he’s gone againts the band by suggesting the Rejects have gone heavy metal?\n\nMicky: You were down at Abbey Road when we did the live album weren’t you?\n\nYeah\n\nMicky: What did you think of the set?\n\nIt was alright, a bit different in places.\n\nMicky: Yeah right, it was a bit more professional because it was for a live album and you’ve got to give it a bit of beef. You can’t do a strictly punk thing, or you’ll get labelled for ever, anyway all the band can play so why not make the most of it. Later we took Garry down E.M.I and played him the new album and he had to admit it was our best album yet.\n\nDo you think it’s ironic that Sham could never play in London without attracting trouble where as you only found trouble outside London?\n\nMicky: I wouldn’t say that, anyway you better let H (Rejects road manager) answer that.\n\nH: Well I used to follow Sham 69 and the difference was, when trouble started at Sham gigs they used to run of stage crying. But at Rejects gigs we sorted it out ourselves, we don’t wanna be known as a violent band, ‘co’s basically they’re just normal geezers like you or I, and if you get upset you don’t take shit from anyone, right. Our first main London gig was at the Electric Ballroom and we had vowed beforehand if there was any trouble we’d sort it out ourselves, there was trouble, but we sorted it out in five minutes. It might have seem a bit drastic to the onlooker, steaming in and giving them a good pasting, it was nothing to be proud of but needed doing. Afterwards the kids responsible came up to us and said “where are you playing next”, we had gained the crowds respect.\n\nMicky: That was our original philosophy now we’ve got to make money or the bands gonna die. I know it might sound big headed but we’ve done everyone who tried to have a go at us. But the bands gotta settle down and be a winner, a money maker without selling out, we’re 100% into whar we are doing, I listen to our newer stuff more than the older stuff. So if trouble does start we’ve got no alternative bit walk away because promoters wont wanna put us on, people wont write write about us, no one’ll wanna know us. But I can’t see there being anymore, we’ve given enough, we’ve always stood up to ’em, we’ve learnt the hard way. We said to ’em “we’re West Ham, what of it?”. It wasn’t a challenge to them. We always tried to stop the aggro, but if anyone keeps on you’re bound to lose your rag. So you think for yourself “Who are they?”. But we can’t do that now, we don’t take shit, not from anyone.\n\nWhat do you think of Oi and the way the whole movement is going?\n\nMicky: It hurts me to say this but we’ve disassociated ourselves with the whole movement. I mean when Nina Myskow, the Suns queen of pop says “Oi! the movement, they wear bleached jeans and have tattoos, support football teams and fight”, and all that sort of shit, we don’t do that. We’re satisfied that we started it, we were the first, the originals. The 4-Skins or your Infa-Riot are never gonna touch the Rejects, we were the first fucking ‘erbert band.\n\nSo you don’t think Oi! was manufactured by Garry Bushell as many people believe?\n\nMicky: Nah! it was invented by us, you’ve heard the song “Oi! Oi! Oi!”, well Bushell jumped on that.\n\nH: We’ve got an article from Musicians Only which has a review of one of our first gigs at the Leeds F Club, before Oi! was ‘eard of and the geezer that wrote it said “Stinky Turner could only muster three words between each song, …Oi! Oi! Oi!”.\n\nMicky: If anyone wants to get big by riding on the back of Oi!, that’s entirely up to them, good luck to ’em. But we’ll never go back on the bandwagon, because we know we were the originals.\n\nDo you see any future in it for other bands?\n\nNo!, says Micky emphatically, You’ve seen what’s happened at Acklam Hall and Southall, Oi! is gonna get a lot of poor bastards ‘eads kicked in.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nMicky: It’s just it’s association with football, it’s gonna be brought into it whether you like it or not. Garry says “It’s the vision of all the working class youth sticking together” but you’re never gonna get that. What’s he gonna do, address Britain over the telly?\n\nStinky said in the Oi! debate, he didn’t respect Rotten, but he must of indirectly influenced you, who if anyone do you respect?\n\nMicky: Apart from our drinking mates who we’ve always hung out with, we mix with the higher rock set, people like U.F.O. Them geezers have been through the whole star bit 60,000 seaters and all that, but they wanna sit down and ‘ave a beer and a chat with us, when they could be in Los Angeles or something. We’ve met more genuine people in the higher rock set, apart from our mates. U.F.O. are really into the Rejects plus they show us a mutual respect.\n\nNow the albums released what are the future plans?\n\nMicky: Plenty of money and beers, as many cracks as we can and keep loyal.\n\nYou can’t say fairer than that, but are you now in it for the money?\n\nMicky: No not at all, we wanna get across to as many kids as possible. We’re still one with the audience, we always will be. But there comes a time when you have to start thinking of money, we need it to carry on.\n\nH: The Rejects are trying and to some extent succeeding in doing what no other band has done, and that’s stay together.\n\nSo what has the Nigel Woolfe split all about?\n\nMicky: He wasn’t good enough! and let’s face it H, he didn’t fit with the band. He was into Skinhead for the pose, but he was a mod before that. Now we’ve got rock solid Sticks. I read what Mensi said in your last issue and whether it was true or not, it was still out of order. He should have said something to him instead of beefing about it on the sly in print. It’s only fair you’ve let Sticks have his say.\n\nVince echoed what Micky had said earlier. But the chat I had with Vince was interrupted by our friendly boys in blue carrying out a raid."
