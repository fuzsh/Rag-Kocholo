        "text": "[Senate Hearing 114-] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office] DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 ---------- U.S. Senate, Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC. NONDEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES [Clerk's note.--The subcommittee was unable to hold hearings on nondepartmental witnesses. The statements and letters of those submitting written testimony are as follows:] Prepared Statement of the 1854 Treaty Authority 1854 TREATY AUTHORITY The 1854 Treaty Authority (Authority) is a tribal organization funded by a Public Law 93-638 contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) under its Trust-Natural Resources Management-Rights Protection Implementation (RPI) budget. --The Authority supports the administration's proposed $40,161,000 for BIA Rights Protection Implementation (an increase of 2,500,000) and a proportionate share for the Authority. However, while the Authority supports the 2,500,000 increase to RPI funding, we do not agree that the increase should be open to a ``competitive proposal-based process'' as outlined in the BIA fiscal year 2017 Justifications (a.k.a. BIA Greenbook), but any increase should be allocated in the same proportions as it has historically been distributed. --The Authority supports the full finding of contract support for its Public Law 93-638, Self-Determination contract at no less than the administrations proposed $278,000,000. --The Authority supports maintaining funding for the EPA Great Lakes Restoration budget at least at its current level of $300,000,000. The Authority is a tribal organization responsible for protecting, preserving, and regulating the treaty-reserved hunting, fishing and gathering rights in the territory ceded to the United States by the Chippewa in the Treaty of September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. 1109. The Bois Forte Band and the Grand Portage Band created the authority following Federal court affirmation of the rights in 1988. As part of a court- approved agreement with the State of Minnesota, the Bands have obligations to preserve the natural resources in the five (5) million acre ceded territory and to regulate the activities of Band members through a conservation code, enforcement officers, and a court. The Authority has also been involved with a variety of inter-agency efforts to study the effect of invasive species, climate change, and activities that impact treaty resources. Although it has significant responsibilities in a geographic area the size of Massachusetts, the Authority has only fifteen (15) full- time employees. With those limited resources, the Authority has been able to collaborate with State, tribal and Federal agencies to become a prominent presence in the conservation of resources critical to the subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering activities of the Chippewa. However, the successes of the Authority are overshadowed by the challenges facing the trust resources that are at the heart of the treaty rights. The Minnesota moose population has declined precipitously in just a few years and for reasons unknown, invasive species and climate change threaten the treaty fishing and wild rice production areas across the ceded territory, and human activities continue to deplete or displace wildlife populations. The Authority urges the subcommittee and the Congress to acknowledge that the resources we seek to protect are trust resources, reserved in treaties that the United States has a legal obligation to protect and preserve. ______ Prepared Statement of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association The requests of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association (APIA) for the fiscal year 2017 Indian Health Service (IHS) budget are as follows: --Funding for a health facility replacement project in Atka, Alaska. --Provide or require the IHS to allocate an additional $12.5 million to fully fund Village Built Clinic Leases and make it a line item in the budget. --Place IHS funding on an advance appropriations basis. --Continue with indefinite funding for Contract Support Costs (CSC) but without the fiscal year 2016 proviso limiting carry-over authority, and make indefinite CSC funding permanent and mandatory. The Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association (APIA) is a regional non- profit tribal organization with members consisting of the 13 federally recognized tribes of the Aleutian Chain and Pribilof Islands Region. APIA provides healthcare services to the Alaska Natives in four of the tribal communities of this Region through funding received from IHS under Title V of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). We also provide health-related services through various non-IHS grants and agreements. atka clinic replacement We are requesting $2.9 million for a health facility replacement in Atka, Alaska. --During World War II, Atka Health Clinic was also destroyed along with the entire community by the United States Navy to keep our enemies from using the area. --In Atka the APIA is working with and helping the City of Atka on a grant and funding package. --In Unalaska a Joint Venture application with the Indian Health Service is approved, which also includes Atka. --The Current Atka Health Clinic is inadequate to provide the care the community deserves, it is beyond repair and even a simple window replacement cannot be supported with the existing structure. It is vulnerable to weather & the life safety code. --The Atka IRA Council, the City, APIA & APIDCA have taken the first steps to finance the design in the amount of $128,000. --Site-work plans, foundation design, floor plans & draft RFP for a modular building is completed. --The Atka Health Clinic is a newly designated Community Health Center that serves everyone regardless of race or ability to pay; it is a Veterans service site, as well as an Indian Health Service site. --We are ready to take this project to the next level & begin the construction phase. --We are specifically requesting support for construction funding in the amount of $2,923,100. funding for village built clinics in alaska The Village Built Clinics (VBCs) continue to face a significant funding crisis. We thank you for the $2 million appropriated in fiscal year 2016 to supplement what was being spent on clinic leases and are heartened by the administration's request of $11 million in fiscal year 2017 ($9 million increase plus $2 million from fiscal year 2016) for this same purpose. VBCs are leased by the IHS from other entities and are a vital component of the provision of basic healthcare services in rural Alaska, as they serve as the clinic space for the Community Health Aide Program (CHAP). The CHAP utilizes a network of community health aides and practitioners to provide primary healthcare services in otherwise unserved rural and isolated areas. Rental amounts for the VBCs have failed to keep pace with costs--the majority of the leases for VBCs have not increased since 1989. As a result, many of the VBCs are unsafe or have had to be closed, leaving some villages in Alaska without a local healthcare facility. In addition, the President's proposed fiscal year 2017 clinic lease bill language may need some clarification, depending on IHS's interpretation of the reference that healthcare be delivered in a space acquired through a ``full service lease''. In some cases tribes receive VBC funding as part of their recurring base, and so the IHS no longer has ``full service leases'' in place for those clinics. We know that the Appropriations Committees do not intend to limit VBC eligibility based on unclear terminology. In sum, these amounts are a step in the right direction but the 2105 ANHB study that analyzed the funding deficiency statewide for these facilities identified an increased need of $12.5 million increase. We urge that the full amount needed be appropriated. We also support maintaining this funding as a line item in the bill. ihs advance appropriations & mandatory contract support costs We continue to support placing the IHS budget on an advance appropriations basis, as Congress has done with the Veterans Administration (VA) health accounts. The fiscal year 2016 budget justification for the VA said advance appropriation is necessary to ``fulfill the administration's commitment to provide reliable and timely resources to support the delivery of accessible and high-quality medical services for veterans.'' Advance appropriations for the IHS is equally important to the predictable and timely funding of healthcare for Alaska Natives and American Indians, and for us to more effectively use our resources in what is otherwise a difficult fiscal environment. We wish to extend our appreciation to the subcommittee for its support for full funding of CSC. We support the President's proposal for an appropriation in fiscal year 2017 of ``such sums as may be necessary,'' with an estimated $800 million for CSC for the IHS in a separate accounts within the IHS's discretionary budget. We join with others in Indian Country, however, in asking that the proviso from the fiscal year 2016 appropriations language (``amounts obligated but not expended by a tribe or tribal organization for contract support costs for such agreements for the current fiscal year shall be applied to contract support costs otherwise due for such agreements for subsequent fiscal years'') be removed in 2017 and thereafter. We also believe that indefinite CSC funding should ultimately be made permanent and mandatory, beginning no later than fiscal year 2018. We appreciate your consideration of our request outlined in this testimony. On behalf of APIA and the people we serve, I am happy to provide any other additional information desired by the subcommittee.

As the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills are developed, we respectfully urge you to maintain strong funding for programs that enable important work to restore landscapes like those in and around the America's 21 Great Waters.\\1\\ In addition to these waterways being valuable ecological resources, they are also significant economic drivers for large swaths of the Nation, providing much-needed jobs and opportunities for untold numbers of Americans. As you make difficult decisions regarding funding, we want to highlight the solid return on taxpayer investments in Great Waters restoration. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ America's Great Waters Coalition recognizes 21 Great Waters based on specific criteria. These waters are the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound, Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin, Chesapeake Bay, Coastal Louisiana, Colorado River, Delaware River, Everglades, Galveston Bay, Great Lakes, Gulf of Maine, Lake Champlain, Long Island Sound, Mississippi River, Missouri River, Narragansett Bay, New York/ New Jersey Harbor and Hudson Estuary, Ohio River, Puget Sound, Rio Grande, San Francisco Bay, and St. Johns River. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As you prepare the fiscal year 2017 Interior appropriations bill, we encourage you to maintain robust funding for programs that support aquatic ecosystem restoration and exclude policy riders that harm our Great Waters and derail ongoing restoration efforts. Programs important for restoring Great Waters in the Interior bill include but are not limited to: --EPA's Geographic Programs, which include robust and successful restoration programs in the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Champlain, Great Lakes, Long Island Sound, Puget Sound and others. --The National Estuary Program, which has restored and protected 1.75 million acres of coastal habitats in 28 estuaries since 2000 and has leveraged $18 of investment for every dollar provided by EPA. --Department of the Interior priorities such as the National Park Service's Everglades restoration initiatives; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Coastal Program, Cooperative Landscape Conservation Program, National Coastal Wetlands Grant, and North American Wetlands Conservation Act programs; and Joint Ventures, which bring together partners to conserve habitat. --Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which provide important resources for States and municipalities to make much-needed upgrades to wastewater treatment systems and include dedicated Green Project Reserves in each fund. --Section 319 Nonpoint Source Management Program, which is the primary grants program for States, Territories, and tribes to address nonpoint source challenges. --USGS National Water Quality Program, which provides robust water quality monitoring and data for informed decisionmaking. At a time when Federal lawmakers need to make smart spending choices, restoration offers one of the best returns on investment in the Federal budget. Restored watersheds improve our quality of life, increase property values, provide clean water, support fish and wildlife and enhance outdoor recreation for our families. The on-the- ground work to restore our coasts, lakes, rivers, and estuaries produces jobs and utilizes skills and machinery available in the local workforce that provide many benefits to local economies. --According to Restore America's Estuaries, restoring our coasts can create more than 30 jobs for every million dollars invested, which is more than twice as many jobs as the oil and gas and road construction industries combined. --Along the Mississippi River, estimates show that more than 50 habitat restoration projects contribute approximately $16.5 million to small businesses and employ more than 300 people in rural counties where, so often, unemployment is the highest following the closure of factories and other industries along the river. --A report by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation found that economic benefits provided by nature in the Chesapeake watershed will total $130 billion annually, an increase of $22 billion annually, when the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint is fully implemented. --A study conducted by Mather Economics found that for every $1 invested in restoring the Everglades, there is at least a $4 return in economic benefits, and that over the next 50 years, the incremental impact of Everglades restoration is expected to produce more than 440,000 jobs. --A study of the Delaware River Watershed found that it contributes $25 billion in annual economic activity and $21 billion in ecosystem goods and services. The America's Great Waters Coalition represents diverse national, regional, State and local organizations working to protect, preserve and restore our Nation's waters. The Coalition is a result of years of work by national and local organizations to bring the broader restoration community together to ``lift all boats.'' Together, we urge you to continue to provide the highest level of funding possible for Federal programs critical for effective Great Waters restoration. Sincerely, Molly M.

My name is Laura L. Lott and I serve as President and CEO of the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). We urge your support for at least $155 million each in fiscal year 2017 for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), as well as $922.2 million for the Smithsonian Institution. We also request your support for the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), including at least $55 million for State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs), $15 million for Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs) and $28 million to preserve the sites and stories of the Civil Rights Movement. We request restored funding of $30 million and $4.6 million respectively for the Save America's Treasures (SAT) and Preserve America programs. Before detailing these funding priorities for the museum field, I want to express my deepest appreciation for the increases enacted by the subcommittee in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Public Law 114-113. The additional funds for the NEH, NEA, Smithsonian Institution and historic preservation activities will enhance museums' work to enrich their communities and preserve our many heritages. I know the subcommittee once again faces a very limited 302(b) allocation, and must make difficult decisions. In this context, however, we would posit that each of our priorities outlined below is a vital investment that will both protect our Nation's cultural treasures and provide a tremendous economic benefit. AAM is proud to represent the full range of our Nation's museums-- including aquariums, art museums, botanic gardens, children's museums, culturally specific museums, historic sites, history museums, maritime museums, military museums, natural history museums, planetariums, presidential libraries, science and technology centers, and zoos, among others--along with the professional staff and volunteers who work for and with museums. AAM is honored to work on behalf of the Nation's approximately 35,000 museums, which employ 400,000 people, invest more than $2 billion annually in educational programs, receive more than 55 million visits each year from primary and secondary school students, and directly contribute $21 billion to their local economies. Museums are essential in our communities for many reasons: --Museums are key education providers.--Museums already offer educational programs in math, science, art, literacy, language arts, history, civics and government, economics and financial literacy, geography, and social studies, in coordination with State and local curriculum standards. Museums also provide experiential learning opportunities, STEM education, youth training, job preparedness, and a range of programs geared toward homeschooling families. They reach beyond the scope of instructional programming for schoolchildren by also providing critical teacher training. There is a growing consensus that whatever the new educational era looks like, it will focus on the development of a core set of skills: critical thinking, the ability to synthesize information, creativity, and collaboration. We believe museums are uniquely situated to help learners develop these core skills, and this is borne out by evidence. According to a recent University of Arkansas study, students who attended just a half-day field trip to an art museum experienced an increase in critical thinking skills, historical empathy and tolerance. For students from rural or high-poverty regions, the increase was even more significant. --Museums create jobs and support local economies.--Museums serve as economic engines, bolster local infrastructure, and spur tourism. Both the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Governors Association agree that cultural assets such as museums are essential to attracting businesses, a skilled workforce, and local and international tourism. --Museums address community challenges.--Many museums offer programs tailored to seniors, veterans, children with special needs, persons with disabilities, and more, greatly expanding their reach and impact. For example, some have programs designed specifically for children on the autism spectrum while others are addressing veterans' post-war trauma or providing youth job training opportunities. --Digitization and traveling exhibitions bring museum collections to underserved populations.--Teachers, students, and researchers benefit when cultural institutions are able to increase access to trustworthy information through online collections and traveling exhibits. Most museums, however, need more resources to digitize collections. The National Endowment for the Humanities is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1965. Grants are awarded to nonprofit educational institutions--including museums, colleges, universities, archives, and libraries--for educational programming and the care of collections. NEH supports museums as institutions of learning and exploration, and as keepers of our cultural, historical, and scientific heritages. In 2015, through Preservation & Access, one of NEH's national program divisions, 63 peer-reviewed, competitive grants totaling over $3.6 million dollars were awarded to museums, historical societies and historic sites for a variety of projects to preserve and provide access to our Nation's rich cultural heritage. Across all NEH divisions (including Preservation and Access, Research, Education, Public Programs, Challenge Grants and Digital Humanities), these institutions received 118 awards totaling over $12.5 million. Demand for humanities project support, as demonstrated by NEH grant application rates, far exceeds available funding. In fiscal year 2015, NEH received 4,928 competitive grant applications representing $482.8 million in requested funds, but was only able to fund 15.4 percent of these peer-reviewed proposals. NEH also provides approximately 40 percent of its funding directly to States through grants to humanities councils located in every State and U.S. Territory. In 2015, 55 State councils supported 4,266 events in museums, reaching a total audience of more than 2.1 million people. Here are just two examples of how NEH funding supports museums' work in your communities: --In 2015, Chugachmiut was awarded $250,000 for the creation of an online digital archive of approximately 700 ethnographic objects, art works, and photographs, representing the cultural heritage of the Chugach people of southern Alaska. The project will gather, upload, display, and disseminate historical information about all Chugach ethnographic collections worldwide on a dedicated Web site accessible to researchers. --In 2015, The International Folk Art Foundation in Santa Fe, New Mexico was awarded $400,000 for The Red that Colored the World, including implementation of a traveling exhibition, a catalog, and public programs about the history and global significance of cochineal, an insect-based dye source whose origins date to the pre-Columbian Americas. The National Endowment for the Arts makes art accessible to all and provides leadership in arts education. Established in 1965, NEA supports great art in every congressional district. Its grants to museums help them exhibit, preserve, and interpret visual material through exhibitions, residencies, publications, commissions, public art works, conservation, documentation, services to the field, and public programs. In 2015, more than 2,000 museums participated as Blue Star Museums--a partnership between NEA, Blue Star Families, and the Department of Defense--to offer free admission to all active duty and reserve personnel and their families from Memorial Day through Labor Day. This particular effort served more than 839,000 people, while many other museums offer military discounts or free admission throughout the year. In 2015, NEA made more than 160 direct awards to museums, totaling over $5 million. Forty percent of NEA's grant funds are distributed to State arts agencies for re-granting, and many museums benefit from these funds as well. Receiving a grant from the NEA confers prestige on supported projects, strengthening museums' ability to attract matching funds from other public and private funders. On average, each dollar awarded by the NEA leverages more than nine dollars from other sources. Here are two examples of how NEA funding is used to support museums' work in your communities: --In 2015, the American Jazz Museum received $20,000 to support an indoor and outdoor jazz and blues festival, including education programming for youth and adults as well as potential performance opportunities for local youth jazz ensembles. --In 2015, Art Mobile of Montana, in Dillon, received $15,000 to support a traveling exhibition and visual arts education program. A specially equipped van travels throughout the State, providing access to original artworks by Montana artists. The program provides resources for teachers in selected schools on Indian reservations. In addition to these direct grants, NEA's Arts and Artifacts Indemnity program also allows museums to apply for Federal indemnity on major exhibitions, saving them roughly $30 million in insurance costs every year and making many more exhibitions available to the public-- all at virtually no cost to the American taxpayer. The Smithsonian Institution comprises some of the most visited museums in the world, including the National Museum of American History, the National Air and Space Museum, and the National Museum of Natural History. The Smithsonian reaches visitors and learners of all ages, in the Nation's capital and across the country, with innovative exhibits and programs. Its 20 museums--including the National Zoo-- attracted over 28 million in-person visitors last year, its Web sites reached more than 100 million unique visitors, and its content and curriculums are used by teachers all over the country. The President's fiscal year 2017 budget request of $922.2 million includes critical funding necessary for the maintenance, operation, and security of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which is due to open in September. Additional funding for collections care, cutting-edge research of every type, facilities maintenance, and technology upgrades will allow the Smithsonian to continue caring for the Nation's treasures and increase access for all. The Historic Preservation Fund is the funding source of preservation awards to States, tribes, local governments, and nonprofits. State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices carry out the historic preservation work of the Federal Government on State and tribal lands. These duties include making nominations to the National Register of Historic Places, reviewing impacts of Federal projects, providing assistance to developers seeking a rehabilitation tax credit, working with local preservation commissions, and conducting preservation education and planning. This Federal-State-local foundation of America's historic preservation program was established by the National Historic Preservation Act. We urge you to provide $55 million for SHPOs and $15 million for THPOs through the Historic Preservation Fund. We also urge you to restore funding of $30 million for Save America's Treasures and $4.6 million for Preserve America, which have not been funded in recent years. From 1999 to 2010, Federal funding of $315 million for 1,287 Save America's Treasures projects leveraged an additional $400 million in non-Federal funds. These projects protected some of America's most iconic and endangered artifacts, including Ansel Adams' prints and negatives, Frank Lloyd Wright structures including Fallingwater, and the American flag that inspired the Star Spangled Banner. SAT projects also created more than 16,000 jobs in local communities across the country. We are disappointed that the administration did not include this funding in its fiscal year 2017 budget. Also in the context of the Historic Preservation Fund, we support the administration's requested increases for the Civil Rights Initiative, including $25 million for competitive historic preservation grants to preserve the stories and sites associated with the Civil Rights Movement as well as $3 million to help Historically Black Colleges and Universities conduct similar documentation and interpretation. The 2005 Heritage Health Index of archives, libraries, historical societies, and museums concluded that action is needed to prevent the loss of millions of artifacts, and an updated Heritage Health Index due soon is predicted to show a continuing urgent need. Historic preservation programs are not only essential to protecting our many heritages; they also serve as economic development engines and job creators. I want to once more acknowledge the difficult choices that the subcommittee faces. I hope that my testimony has made it clear why these priorities are of critical importance to the Nation and will provide a worthwhile return on investment to the American taxpayer. Thank you again for the opportunity to submit this testimony. ______ Prepared Statement of the American Chemical Society As Congress and the administration consider funding priorities for fiscal year 2017 in a tight budgetary environment, the American Chemical Society (ACS) urges policy makers to support the important work carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency's Science and Technology Program. In reviewing the President`s budget request, ACS has identified two areas of focus for EPA: 1. Funding the EPA Science & Technology account at the requested amount of $754 million and increasing support for scientific research supported by the agency, particularly through the Office of Research and Development (ORD). 2. Restoring $10 million the Science To Achieve Results (STAR) fellowships program to the fiscal year 2016 enacted amount of $49.8 million. The American Chemical Society (ACS) would like to thank Chairperson Lisa Murkowski and Ranking Member Tom Udall for the opportunity to submit testimony for the record on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) science and technology programs for fiscal year 2008. ACS is a non-profit scientific and educational organization, chartered by Congress, representing approximately 157,000 individual chemical scientists and engineers. The world's largest scientific society, ACS advances the chemical enterprise, increases public understanding of chemistry, and brings its expertise to bear on State, national, and international matters. We look to science to understand environmental challenges and to develop more intelligent, less burdensome solutions. Over the past two decades, demand for more scientific evidence--whether to set or improve regulations--has grown substantially. The amount of research envisioned in EPA-related authorizations also has increased. Nevertheless, appropriations for EPA science programs have not kept pace with the need for more and better science. Over the last 20 years, the EPA S&T account, which includes the ORD and research programs in other EPA Offices, has fluctuated between 7 and 10 percent of the agency's total budget. In order for EPA set science-based national environmental standards, conduct research and environmental monitoring, and provide technical assistance to States, local governments, and businesses, the S&T account needs to increase as a percentage of the agency's total budget, ultimately to a stable 10 percent level. The President's budget request is $754 million, a roughly 2.6 percent increase over fiscal year 2016, and 9.2 percent of the total agency request. While ACS supports the President's request, we urge the subcommittee to find additional resources to boost S&T spending at EPA to eventually reach 10 percent of the agency budget. In the long term, ACS recommends the ORD account should eventually receive $646 million, consistent with its 2004 funding high point. This represents an increase of 20.5 percent percent relative to fiscal year 2016 funding levels. ACS strongly urges to the subcommittee to work with EPA to boost resources for ORD to request and appropriate steadily increasing amounts to eventually reach the 2004 level. ACS recommends that the additional funds be applied to the following priority areas: --Provide at least a $10 million increase in funding for STAR fellowship program. --Increase funding of green chemistry and engineering to advance the development and use of innovative, environmentally benign products and processes. --Invest in EPA's ability to recruit, develop, and retain an effective scientific workforce. --Continue investing in Federal research and technology development to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and address the potential impacts of global climate change. --Support innovative and high-risk research to help identify and explore future environmental problems and develop new sets of technologies to solve existing problems. The fiscal year 2008 budget request continues a pattern of flat support for science at EPA for the Office of Research & Development, which is the largest part of the S&T account. The administration requested $512 million for ORD for fiscal year 2017. This represents a -.2 percent cut in ORD resources over fiscal year 2016. The decrease, when accounting for inflation, in ORD accounts from fiscal year 2016 threatens ORD's mission to carry out world class environmental research, further damaging the Government's ability to provide top notch research on behalf of the American taxpayer and ensure America's policy makers use sound scientific advice in decisionmaking. The administration's proposal to reduce funding in the STAR fellowship program is a good case in point. This program is the only Federal program dedicated to graduate study in environmental sciences at colleges and universities across the country. The STAR fellowships are part of a cohesive effort to characterize critical or emerging environmental problems and create solutions to address them. EPA designed this extramural research grant program to work in cooperation with a fellowship program. Together, they provide ideas, information, new discoveries, and new researchers. Today's STAR fellows will become tomorrow's environmental experts working for industry, Government agencies like EPA, and academic institutions. The loss of this program's resources will further erode the agency's capability to attract an excellent workforce and will reduce the amount of scientific information available to inform agency decisions. Over the last decade, STAR fellowship funding has been reduced by over half. We urge the subcommittee to restore funding to the appropriated level of $49.8 million from the budget request of $39.1 million. ACS supports increased funding for green chemistry and engineering programs to advance the development and use of innovative products and process, reducing or eliminating the use of hazardous substances. Because chemistry and chemical products fuel the economy of every industrialized nation, the tools and strategies chemists and chemical engineers develop will be instrumental in meeting the dual challenges of protecting the environment and strengthening the economy. ACS is a long term advocate for increased attention to research programs at EPA, both in budgetary and in management terms, and our enthusiasm for these programs remain strong. [This statement was submitted by J. Carl Maxwell, Director, Energy and Environment Policy, Office of Public Affairs.] ______ Prepared Statement of the American Forest Foundation America's family-owned forests, over one-third of the Nation's forested landscape, are critical to meeting the Nation's clean air and water, wildlife, and wood supply needs today and in the future. With impending threats to these forests from catastrophic wildfires, development pressures, insects, diseases, and other issues, continued delivery of these benefits is not guaranteed. Funding for critical U.S. Forest Service programs is essential for helping the 22 million people who own these lands, continue to provide these necessities for all Americans. In particular, we request the following funding levels and policy improvements for critical programs in the USDA Forest Service budget: --Revise budgeting structure for wildfire suppressing to allow expenses for large wildfires to be paid for from emergency funds and to reverse both the ``borrowing'' and the gradual decline of key agency program funding. --$479 million for the hazardous fuels program accompanied with policy direction to support increased cross-boundary collaboration and implementation, especially with private landowners, through the hazardous fuels program. --$29 million for the Forest Stewardship Program with continued direction to encourage a focus on outcomes and measurable impact. --$23.5 million for the Landscape Restoration Program. --$83 million for the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. --$27 million for the Forest Products Laboratory. --$48 million for Forest Health Protection on Cooperative lands. The American Forest Foundation is a nonprofit conservation organization that works on the ground with the more than 22 million family woodland owners through a variety of programs, including the American Tree Farm System, to protect the values and benefits of America's family forests, with a specific focus on clean water, wildlife, and sustainable wood supplies. Unfortunately, new data suggests that by 2020, more than 18 million acres of family forests will be threatened by housing development. Furthermore, almost 14 million acres are at risk of mortality due to insects and disease, while 29 million are at high or very high risk of destruction from wildfire.\\1\\ At the same time, less than 15 percent of family forest owners have sought out technical service for the stewardship of their forests; therefore, it is essential that we provide families with the tools, technical information, and policy support to keep their forests as forests and help them accomplish their management objectives while also protecting the critical benefits Americans depend on every day. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Family Forest Research Center, 2014 Preliminary Data. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- wildfire suppression funding fix Over the last decade, wildfire expenses have significantly increased, and the Federal wildfire budgets are often insufficient to cover the costs, leading Federal agencies to transfer funds from non- fire accounts to cover fire-fighting expenses. Additionally, as the budgeted 10-year average of wildfire fighting costs has increased in a limited budget, non-fire programs have gradually been squeezed. Programs like the Forest Stewardship Program have seen as much as a 20 percent decline in the last few years, causing serious challenges with State forestry agency's abilities to work with family landowners. We urge passage of legislation that will both end the disruptive borrowing and reverse the trend of wildfire fighting costs consuming the Forest Service budget at the expense of other critical programs. hazardous fuels program cross boundary direction A recent AFF survey of family landowners in the West showed that family owners are aware and interested in implementing management to reduce wildfire risks on their properties but there are two important barriers: cost and concern about lack of action by their neighbors. Why is this important? AFF also completed recent analysis that shows if we want to protect critical watersheds in the West from the risks of catastrophic wildfire--which can destroy the storage and filtration benefits forests provide-leading to water quality and quantity problems-- we've got to engage family landowners in wildfire mitigation. In fact our analysis shows that nearly 40 percent of the land that keeps water clean in important watersheds that are at a high risk of wildfire, are private and family-owned. Cross-boundary collaborative projects that engage all landowners in a landscape or a watershed-- both public and private, will help address these challenges and will also help motivate landowners to act. Thus, we ask the subcommittee to provide direction to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to work in partnership with State forestry agencies to encourage cross-boundary collaboration and implementation of wildfire mitigation at a landscape scale, through the hazardous fuels program. We also ask the subcommittee to fund the Forest Service hazardous fuels program at $479 million. This approach is working. For example, in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, AFF is working through a local collaborative, that involves public agencies and local organizations working together to support wildfire mitigation across the landscape. This collaborative has realized that treating only one piece of the puzzle--the public lands side which has been where most of the focus has been--is not going to full protect communities, homes, lives, and water supplies. To date, we have succeeded in engaging landowners who are now managing almost 22,000 acres for wildfire mitigation, in the patchwork of public and private lands. We are similarly working in collaboratives in Colorado's Front Range, Montana's Great Falls, and California's Northern Sierra's. forest stewardship program The Forest Stewardship Program (FSP), implemented through State forestry agencies, provides Federal support for the boots-on-the-ground needed to engage family landowners in stewardship. With strong funding of $29 million for fiscal year 2017 and strategic changes, FSP could do more. FSP can be, and in some States already is, an essential lynchpin for conducting outreach, marketing, and interaction with landowners in ways that can measurably protect clean water, wildlife habitat, and sustainable wood supplies. Without the presence on the ground, effective landowner engagement will be impossible. We encourage the subcommittee to continue to provide direction to support the changes underway in the program to better focus the program on measurable outcomes, encourage targeted marketing and engagement so resources are focused on the highest priorities, and encourage sustained engagement with landowners so resources are used most effectively to achieve priority outcomes on the landscape. landscape scale restoration program The Landscape Scale Restoration Program (LSR), which provides resources through a competitive process, to States and partner organizations to implement work that results in measurable outcomes, is a very effective program. Through LSR, State agencies are working with partners like AFF to move the needle on key issues like protecting clean water in the West or restoring critical ecosystems in the south which will be essential to preventing another flood of species listings in the south. The program is leveraging private sector funding as well. AFF strongly urges the subcommittee to support $23.513 million for the Landscape Restoration Program. forest inventory and analysis program The Forest Inventory and Analysis Program provides critical data to inform natural resource decisions, such as where to site a new mill, where to implement wildfire mitigation treatments for the greatest impact, how much carbon is captured and stored in our forests. FIA also provides trends in family forest ownership and demographics so that we can better understand how to work with this significant ownership group. We appreciate the work of the subcommittee in fiscal year 2016 to increase funding for this program and we encourage an increase to $83 million in fiscal year 2017, to allow the agency to implement the current measurement cycle, at a minimum. forest products laboratory The Forest Products Laboratory, part of USFS Research and Development, provides critical research for increasing the market opportunities for forest products. Recently, the Laboratory has been essential to providing the science and data needed to build the new tall wood buildings we are beginning to see in the U.S., that have both economic and environmental benefits. The Lab is also key to researching new products for forests--from biomass energy to nanotechnology products. Markets that provide landowners with income to implement management such as hazardous fuels reduction or habitat creation, will be essential if we're to address the issues facing family lands and continue to see the benefits from these lands. We appreciate the increase the subcommittee provided for the Lab in fiscal year 2016 and we ask that this funding level, of $27 million be at least maintained in fiscal year 2017. We also urge the subcommittee to provide direction that the increased funds be used for a combination of research, development, and technology transfer for advancing wood building construction, nanotechnology, and biomass technology development. state fire assistance We ask the subcommittee to provide $87 million for State Fire Assistance to support the program's coordinated fire protection and mobilization for fire suppression on both Federal and non-Federal lands. In addition, the funds support State-coordinated hazard mitigation activities in the wildland-urban interface, focus on reducing property loss, decrease fuels hazards, increase public awareness, develop fire plans, and increase citizen-driven solutions in rural communities. forest health investments Threats from invasive species and pests continue to pervade American tree-farmers' lands, thus posing economic and environmental hardships. Close to 500 species of tree-damaging pests from other countries have become established in the United States, and a new one is introduced, on average, every 2 to 3 years. The USFS Forest Health Protection (FHP) Program is necessary to help prevent, contain, and eradicate these dangerous pests and pathogens. The program provides critical assistance to other Federal agencies, State agencies, local agencies and private landowners. We ask the subcommittee fund the Forest Health Cooperative lands program at $48 million, to provide protection from insects and diseases on non-Federal lands, including family lands. Thank you for considering these requests. We know the subcommittee has difficult decisions to make, in this era of limited budgets, especially with the rising costs of wildfire suppression. We hope that the subcommittee will consider the impact the above mentioned priorities can have on millions of family forest owners, along with all other Americans who reap the benefits of well-managed, working forests. We, at AFF, thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to provide some insight on these programs. [This statement was submitted by Tom Martin, President & CEO.] ______ Prepared Statement of American Forests Dear Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Udall, and honorable subommittee members: American Forests appreciates the opportunity to submit public testimony regarding our fiscal year 2017 appropriation recommendations. We understand the continuing economic realities facing the Nation, and we thank this subcommittee for its support of key Federal conservation programs in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The return on investing in our Nation's forests is great, whether those forests are public or private, in urban areas or in wildlands. The economic, social, and environmental benefits healthy forests provide are clear incentives for Federal investment. American Forests' funding recommendations are generally consistent with the President's budget requests for the USDA Forest Service, Department of Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency, with the exception of programs that merit an elevated request. Founded in 1875, American Forests is the oldest national nonprofit conservation organization in the United States. Its mission is to restore threatened forest ecosystems and inspire people to value and protect urban and wildland forests. American Forests has planted 50 million trees in 1,000 high-impact forest restoration projects, as well as works in cities across the country helping to increase urban forest canopy and demonstrating innovative greenspace projects. usda forest service (usfs) National Forest System Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP): CFLRP was created to promote job stability, a reliable wood supply, and forest health while reducing emergency wildfire costs and risks. American Forests' request is $20 million above the President's fiscal year 2017 budget ask, and identical to agency budget requests from the past 2 years. Increased funding would support the continued implementation of the 23 existing projects, and allow for the competitive selection of up to 10 additional landscapes across the Nation. -- American Forests recommends an increase from the President's request to $60 million. State and Private Forestry Urban and Community Forestry (U&CF): U&CF plays an integral part in promoting sound stewardship of our Nation's urban and community forests and trees. By providing important technical and financial support, U&CF helps cities and towns across the Nation enhance tree and forest cover, prepare for storms and other disturbance events, contain threats from native and invasive pests, and maximize the economic, social, and ecological benefits of their tree resources. U&CF is a high-impact program and a smart investment as Federal support is often leveraged 2:1 (or in many cases significantly more) by States and partner organizations. As a model Federal program, U&CF consistently increases communities served, brings together diverse partners and resources, and shows that Federal investment can have huge and lasting impacts on communities of all sizes. -- American Forests recommends U&CF be funded at $31.3 million. Community Forests and Open Space Program (CFP): CFP has made substantial progress in preserving forests by increasing opportunities for Americans to connect with forests in their own communities and fostering new public-private partnerships. CFP has supported 27 community forest projects in cities and towns across 15 States and Territories. In the latest round of CFP grants, project partners leveraged $8.7 million in Federal funds to secure $31.8 million in non- Federal funding. As a result of these partnerships, more than 14,000 acres of private forestlands have been or soon will be acquired to create new or expand existing community forests. -- As interest in this program far exceeds the fiscal year 2016 allocation of $2 million, American Forests recommends an increase to $5 million. Forest Health Management: The Forest Health Management programs provide essential expertise and assistance to State and municipal agencies and private landowners in countering non-native pests. Municipal governments across the country are spending more than $3 billion each year to remove trees on city property killed by these non- native pests. Homeowners are spending an additional $1 billion to remove and replace trees on their properties and are absorbing an additional $1.5 billion in reduced property values. -- American Forests asks that the subcommittee appropriate $52 million for Federal lands and $48 million is designated for cooperative lands. Forest Legacy Program: Since authorized in 1990, the Forest Legacy Program has protected 2.49 million acres across the country, including 169,250 acres of water bodies and 3,288 miles of streams. It is imperative to continue protecting our Nation's forests for future generations while simultaneously providing the myriad of ecosystem services to current Americans. -- American Forests supports the President's request of $62.35 million allocated through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Landscape-Scale Restoration: The Landscape Scale Restoration program strategically prioritizes resources by competitively allocating the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act funds. It focuses on targeting Federal investments --leveraged by State funding resources--to areas of greatest need, highest value, or strongest innovation potential as stipulated in each State Forest Action Plan. -- American Forests recommends funding the Landscape Scale Restoration program at $23.5 million. bureau of land management (blm) Public Domain Forest Management: The BLM is entrusted with the management of 58 million acres of forests and woodlands across 12 western States, including Alaska. 14 million acres--or 24 percent--of BLM forests are overstocked increasing insect and disease attacks and catastrophic wildfire. Increased funding to address these serious risks is necessary across all land management agencies. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request at $10.08 million. National Conservation Lands: The National Conservation Lands encompasses signature landscapes including some of America's finest natural and cultural treasures, many of them forested. Yet, despite their codification in law and growing popularity, the system of national monuments and national conservation areas is still undercapitalized. These areas lack sufficient staff and financial resources to adequately protect their valuable natural and cultural resources and maximize their recreational potential. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request for $50.65 million. fish and wildlife service (fws) Ecological Services: Ecological Services achieves conservation of FWS trust resources, focusing on imperiled species, and works closely with external partners and agencies for the conservation of natural resources across the landscape. The Ecological Services Program facilitates implementation of the Endangered Species Act through the programmatic divisions of listing, planning and consultation, conservation and restoration, recovery and provides assistance to States under the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request of $252.29 million for Ecological Services. Coastal Program: As part of the habitat conservation arm of FWS, the Coastal Program is a cooperative program to implement habitat restoration and protection projects on public and private lands in 24 priority coastal ecosystems, including areas in the Great Lakes and U.S. Territories. It delivers on-the-ground conservation by working collaboratively with partners to restore, enhance, and protect coastal habitat for priority Federal trust species. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request of $13.49 million for the Coastal Program. National Wildlife Refuge System: The National Wildlife Refuge System, with 563 refuges covering more than 150 million acres across the country, is vital to protecting America's wildlife and ensuring that their habitats are a priority. Because refuges are visited by nearly 48.5 million people each year, contributes a total of $4.5 billion to the economy, and support more than 35,000 jobs, investment in the Refuge system is an investment in our communities. With 101 refuges within 25 miles of 250,000 or more people, the Refuge System is a vital component of our urban forests, as well. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request for $508.20 million with the additional $5.5 million requested for the Refuge Visitor Service allocated to the urban wildlife refuges. State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program (STWG): As authorized by the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, STWG provides Federal grant funds to States and Tribes to develop and implement programs for the benefit of fish and wildlife and their habitats. All funded activities must link with species, actions, or strategies included in each State Wildlife Action Plan (Plan). The success of this program is evident in the 1.9 million acres of habitat for species of greatest conservation need and the nearly 131,000 acres of habitat it has protected through land acquisition or conservation easements. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request for $66.98 million for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants. national park service National Park System: During this historical centennial year of the National Park Service, American Forests' requests improved funding for the agency's operations, construction, and partnerships. Specifically, the National Park Partnerships (a.k.a. Centennial Challenge) is an economically wise program that leverages private dollars to match Federal funds. The funds support projects to improve the visiting experience at national parks. An fiscal year 2016 investment of $15 million has yielded more than twice that in private donations, and many more opportunities await with a funding boost. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request of $2.524 billion for `Operations', $252 million for `Construction' and $35 million for National Park Partnerships. Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program (ORLPP): The State and Local Assistance Program provides matching grants to States and localities for protection and development of parks and recreation resources and is the primary Federal investment tool to ensure that families have easy access to urban forests in parks and open space, and neighborhood recreation resources. This nationally competitive program complements the existing State and local assistance program by creating opportunities for outdoor play as well as developing or enhancing outdoor recreation partnerships in cities. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2017 request of $110 million for the State and local assistance program, which includes $12 million for ORLPP. environmental protection agency (epa) Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF): Green infrastructure is a cost-effective and resilient approach to stormwater infrastructure needs that also provide many other community benefits. American Forests supports EPA's goal of strengthening green infrastructure activities to further its sustainability goals. -- American Forests request that not less than 20 percent the CWSRF funding be made available for green infrastructure or environmentally innovative projects that promote water system and community resilience. legislative language requests Wildfire Suppression Funding America's forests and forest-dependent communities are at risk from outbreaks of pests and pathogens, persistent drought, and the buildup of hazardous fuels. Urbanization and development patterns are placing more homes and communities near fire-prone landscapes, leading to more destructive and costly wildfires. Unfortunately and again in fiscal year 2015, the 10-year average was not enough to meet the USFS suppression needs, forcing the agency to transfer $700 million from non-suppression accounts to make up for the shortfall. The current wildfire suppression funding model and cycle of transfers and repayments has negatively impacted the ability to implement forest management, among many other activities. Additionally, the increasing 10-year average to has not met annual suppression needs since before fiscal year 2002, which is why we are thankful to the subcommittee for the full transfer repayment and increased suppression funding in fiscal year 2016. However, we understand this is not expected to occur every year. DOI and USFS need a long-term fire funding solution that would result in stable and predictable budgets. We appreciate the subcommittee's support of the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which addresses Federal fire funding challenges as well as other bipartisan congressional efforts in this regard. We respectfully request a bipartisan fire funding solution that would (1) access disaster funding, (2) minimize transfers, and (3) address the continued erosion of agency budgets over time, with the goal of reinvesting in key programs that would restore forests to healthier conditions. Land and Water Conservation Fund American Forests supports the permanent authorization of full and dedicated funding, without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation, for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). LWCF programs protect natural resource lands, outdoor recreation opportunities, and working forests at the local, State and Federal levels. This program ensures that these important lands are protected for current and future generations. -- American Forests supports the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request, which calls for permanent authorization of $900 million in mandatory funding for LWCF programs in the Departments of Interior and Agriculture. ______ Prepared Statement of the American Geophysical Union The American Geophysical Union (AGU), a non-profit, non-partisan scientific society, appreciates the opportunity to submit testimony regarding the fiscal year 2017 budget request for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The AGU, on behalf of its more than 60,000 Earth and space scientist members, respectfully requests Congress to appropriate $1.17 billion for the USGS. Currently, Federal funding for USGS is 4.5 percent below what it was in fiscal year 2010. Since fiscal year 2010, USGS has not seen a funding increase above 2 percent. Restoring strong funding to USGS will allow the agency to sustain current programs and make strategic investments to improve knowledge and understanding of critical geologic, environmental, and ecological systems needed by decision makers across the country. usgs benefits every state and territory in the union USGS is uniquely positioned to provide information and informed responses to many of the Nation's greatest challenges and has a mission that positively impacts the lives of all Americans. USGS plays a crucial role in assessing water quality and quantity, reducing risks from earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, landslides, wildfires, and other natural hazards; providing emergency responders with geospatial data to improve homeland security; assessing mineral and energy resources (including rare earth elements and unconventional natural gas resources); and providing the science needed to manage our ecosystems and combat invasive species that can threaten natural and managed environmental systems and public health. Through its offices across the country, the USGS works with partners to provide high-quality research and data to policymakers, emergency responders, natural resource managers, civil and environmental engineers, educators, and the public. A few examples of the USGS' valuable work are provided below. water quality The Survey collects scientific information on water availability and quality to inform the public and decision makers about the status of freshwater resources and how they are changing over time. During the past 130 years, the USGS has collected streamflow data at over 21,000 sites, water-level data at over 1,000,000 wells, and chemical data at over 338,000 surface-water and groundwater sites. This information is needed to effectively manage freshwaters--both above and below the land surface--for domestic, public, agricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and ecological purposes. natural hazards The USGS plays an important role in reducing risks from floods, wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and other natural hazards that jeopardize human lives and cost billions of dollars in damages every year. Seismic networks and hazard analysis are used to formulate earthquake probabilities and to establish building codes. USGS monitors volcanoes and provides warnings about impending eruptions that are used by aviation officials to prevent planes from flying into volcanic ash clouds. Data from the USGS network of stream gages enable the National Weather Service to issue flood and drought warnings. The bureau and its Federal partners monitor seasonal wildfires and provide maps of current fire locations and the potential spread of fires. In domestic and global events, emergency managers and public officials rely on USGS to inform them of risks and hazards posed to human and natural systems. mineral and energy resources USGS assessments of mineral and energy resources--including rare earth elements, coal, oil, unconventional natural gas, and geothermal-- are essential for making decisions about the Nation's future. The Survey identifies the location and quantity of domestic mineral and energy resources, and assesses the economic and environmental effects of resource extraction and use. The agency is mapping domestic supplies of rare earth elements necessary for widespread deployment of new energy technologies, which can reduce dependence on foreign oil. The USGS is the sole Federal source of information on mineral potential, production, and consumption. land management USGS science plays a critical role in informing sound management of natural resources on Federal and State lands. The USGS conducts research and monitoring of fish, wildlife, and vegetation--data that informs management decisions by other Interior bureaus regarding protected species and land use. Ecosystems science is also used to control invasive species and wildlife diseases that can cause billions of dollars in economic losses. The Survey provides information for resource managers as they develop management strategies for restoration and long-term use of the Nation's natural resources in the face of environmental change. data collection Research and data collected by the USGS is vital to predicting the impacts of land use and climate change on water resources, wildfires, and ecosystems. For 43 straight years, Landsat satellites have collected the largest archive of remotely sensed land data in the world, allowing for access to current and historical images that are used to assess the impact of natural disasters on communities and the environment and monitor global agriculture production. A 2013 National Research Council study found that the economic benefit of Landsat data was estimated to be $2 billion for 2011 alone. The consistency of data sets like those provided by Landsat is vital for advances in science, more efficient natural resource management, and profitable applications of data in commerce and industry. enhanced mapping for the nation The USGS utilizes unique technologies that enable the nationwide collection of accurate terrain information. This information improves our knowledge of water supply and quality issues; better prepares emergency responders for natural disasters; and helps businesses utilize more accurate data for the development of alternative renewable energy projects. Modernized, high-resolution topographic maps are provided by the USGS through their 3D Elevation Program (3DEP). 3DEP, which is run by the USGS, leverages funds from the private sector and other Federal Agencies throughout the U.S. The initiative provides open-access elevation data to inform better flood-inundation maps, cost-effective precision farming, and the development of alternative renewable energy projects. public health The USGS plays a critical role in maintaining public health at the local, State, and national level. For example, the agency assesses negative health effects caused by the dispersion of contaminants after natural and man-made disasters, such as hurricanes and oil spills. In one such instance, after Hurricane Sandy, the USGS provided soil, water, and sediment information to public health agencies to help them protect citizens from toxic contaminants. engaging the next generation of scientists The USGS meets monthly with other Department of Interior (DOI) divisions to collaborate on projects that will engage the next generation of scientists. Collectively, the DOI is actively working to provide least 10 million students with educational, work, and training opportunities. In 2015, the USGS offered learning opportunities to 113,375 students and teachers in activities such as science fairs, mentoring opportunities, camps, and hands-on learning experiences. Programs such as the USGS's Cooperative Research Units (CRU) provide under-represented undergraduate students with mentoring and hands-on experience designed as a pathway to DOI recruitment. conclusion AGU is grateful to the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for its leadership in restoring past budget cuts and strengthening the USGS. We recognize the financial challenges facing the Nation, but USGS has been historically strained by a large workload and too few resources. With our Nation facing unprecedented challenges such as the loss of ecosystems, demand for limited energy, increasing vulnerability to natural hazards, and need for clean water, the work done by USGS is essential to our environmental, economic, and national security. AGU respectfully requests that Congress work to provide $1.17 billion for USGS in fiscal year 2017. We appreciate the opportunity to submit this testimony to the subcommittee and thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our request. ______ Prepared Statement of the American Geosciences Institute Thank you for this opportunity to provide the American Geosciences Institute's perspective on fiscal year 2017 appropriations for geoscience programs within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. We ask the subcommittee to support and sustain the critical geoscience work of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service, and the Smithsonian Institution. Specifically, we ask that you support the President's request for $1.2 billion for USGS, but we respectfully request that Congress place greater emphasis on the geological sciences within the USGS mission. AGI supports balanced funding for Mission Areas within USGS and notes that funding for important geoscience-based programs has consistently lagged funding for other parts of USGS. AGI also supports $138 million for Energy and Minerals Management at the Bureau of Land Management; $234 million for the National Park Service's Natural Resource Stewardship and Everglades Restoration activities; and $922 million for the Smithsonian Institution. The Earth provides the energy, mineral, water, and soil resources that are essential for a thriving, innovative economy, national security, and a healthy population and environment. We must understand the Earth system, and particularly the geological characteristics of Earth's surface and subsurface, in order to sustain human health and safety, maintain energy and water supplies, and improve the quality of the environment while reducing risks from natural hazards. AGI is a nonprofit federation of 51 geoscientific and professional associations that represent approximately 250,000 geologists, geophysicists, and other Earth scientists who work in industry, academia, and government. Founded in 1948, AGI provides information services to geoscientists, serves as a voice of shared interests in our profession, plays a major role in strengthening geoscience education, and strives to increase public awareness of the vital role the geosciences play in society's use of resources, resilience to natural hazards, and the health of the environment. u.s. geological survey AGI supports the President's request for $1.2 billion for USGS. We respectfully suggest that Congress should allocate more resources to USGS's geoscience functions because there is no alternative source for this expertise. The key Mission Areas of Water Resources, Core Science Systems, and Energy & Mineral Resources have consistently been underfunded when compared to other USGS Mission Areas. AGI strongly supports the proposed increase for USGS Facilities to maintain essential scientific facilities, including monitoring and observation instrumentation. We urge additional funding for the USGS Library, which is an important and unique resource for researchers and industry. Importance of Geoscience Functions at USGS: The need for geological information has not diminished since USGS was established in 1879. On the contrary, as we place increasing demands on Earth's system, many critical decisions rely upon geoscience information. The USGS has a wide-ranging mission to provide objective data, observations, analyses, assessments, and scientific solutions to support decisionmaking; while there is merit to USGS's broad remit, its unique geological mission should be paramount. Table 1 highlights the Mission Areas that have been singled out for lower increases than other sections of USGS since fiscal year 2014; we note that these contain the majority of USGS's geoscience functions. We respectfully ask Congress to recognize the importance of geoscience research, monitoring, information collection and analysis to the Nation's safety, economy, defense, and quality of life, and to support USGS's mandated role by funding balanced investment in USGS programs. Table 1: Trends in funding for USGS Mission Areas and Accounts, fiscal year 2014-fiscal year 2017 request. Core Science Systems Mission Area: --USGS Library: The USGS Library is a vital resource for geoscientists within and outside USGS, servicing hundreds of thousands of requests online and in person annually, yet staffing has fallen from 66 Federal staff (FTE) in 2000 to 18 FTE in 2015. AGI supports increased funding for the USGS Library, which serves industry, academia, and government clients and preserves the intellectual stock of the geosciences. --National Geospatial Program: Topographic mapping has been a core activity at USGS since its inception. AGI strongly supports the 3D Nation interagency partnership to build a modern elevation map of the Nation's territories and urges Congress to support USGS's contribution, the 3DEP (3D Elevation) program. AGI strongly supports investment in lidar and ifsar mapping, and the President's request for $69 million for the National Geospatial Program. --National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (NCGMP): This important, decades-long partnership between the USGS, State geological surveys, and universities has a proven track record of delivering cost-effective geological maps. Over the past few years the number of grant proposals has increased while funding has remained stagnant. AGI asks that Congress increase funding for the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program to $30 million in fiscal year 2017 to meet growing demand. --Data Preservation: The National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (NGGDPP) produces more value in terms of economic, environmental, hazard mitigation, and regulatory efficiency than it costs to run. AGI urges Congress to reauthorize NGGDPP and to fund it at the previously authorized level of $3 million. Energy and Mineral Resources Mission Area: --Mineral Resources Program: AGI is a founding member of the Minerals Science and Information Coalition (MSIC), which supports minerals expertise in the Federal Government. We are concerned at the dearth of investment in this foundational component of the manufacturing supply chain, which is critical to our national economy and defense. AGI supports the President's request for $49 million for the Mineral Resources Program and asks that Congress add $5 million in new funding to create minerals forecasting capabilities. There is no point developing new materials if we cannot supply the raw materials to manufacture them. AGI suggests the creation of a Critical Minerals Hub, with funding of $25 million per year for 5 years, to match the Critical Materials Hub in the Department of Energy. --Energy Resources Program: AGI supports increased funding for the Energy Resources Program. We note the importance of research on gas hydrates, which may play a significant role in future energy and climate scenarios. AGI supports funding of $286 million for the Energy Resources Program. --We urge USGS to develop opportunities to collaborate effectively with other agencies, including integrating more geological information with DOE's Subsurface Technology and Engineering (SubTER) crosscut, to ensure prudent use of Federal funds. Climate and Land Use Mission Area: --Land Remote Sensing Program: One of the most fundamental concepts in the geosciences is that the Earth changes through time. It is impossible to overstate the importance of long-term, consistent monitoring of the Earth to provide a sound basis for decisionmaking. AGI supports the President's request for $96.5 million for the Land Remote Sensing Program, which includes Landsat and other Earth observing systems. Water Resources Mission Area: --Challenges in water supplies and water quality highlight the importance of understanding the quality, quantity, and distribution of our groundwater and surface water resources.

Thank you for the opportunity to present this testimony to the subcommittee. ______ Prepared Statement of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium request summary On behalf of the Nation's Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), which collectively are the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), thank you for this opportunity to present our fiscal year 2017 appropriations recommendations for the 28 colleges funded under Titles I and II of the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act (Tribal College Act); the two tribally chartered career and technical postsecondary institutions (Title V of the TCU Act); the two Bureau of Indian Education postsecondary institutions; and the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). The Bureau of Indian Education administers each of these programs, with the exception of IAIA, which is congressionally chartered and funded in its own account. In fiscal year 2017, TCUs seek: --$89,220,000 to fund institutional operations and technical assistance under Titles I and II of the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act of 1978 or Tribal College Act, of which $88.5 million is for Titles I & II operating grants (which would fund 28 TCUs at the authorized level for the first time in 35 years) and $701,000 is to address increasingly needed technical assistance and a modest increase of $100,000 (this would be the first increase in technical assistance funding in over a decade); --$11,000,000 for Title V of the Tribal College Act, which provides partial institutional operations funding for the two tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions; --$11,835,070, as included in the President's budget, for the Institute of American Indian Arts (this includes $2 million towards forward funding of IAIA); --Minimum of $21,767,000, as included in the President's fiscal year 2017 budget, for Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, the Bureau of Indian Education's two postsecondary institutions; and --$18,200,000 for a one-time appropriation to fully transition institutional operating funding for the three federally chartered TCUs, from the Federal fiscal year to an academic year, as follows: $3.4 million for IAIA (in additional to the $2 million included in the President's budget) and $14.8 million for Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute. IAIA, Haskell Indian Nations University, and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute are the only schools funded through the Department of the Interior that still receive their institutional funding on the Federal fiscal year (October 1) or more likely, much later in the year when the annual Interior appropriation bill is passed, rather than the first week of July in preparation for the upcoming school year. Once forward-funded these TCUs--like other institutions of higher education--will be able to plan multiyear budgets and start (and end) each school year with dependable funding. Forward funding does not increase the Federal budget in the long-term. It simply allows vital education programs to receive basic operating funds before each school year begins, which is critically important when the Federal Government is funded under continuing resolutions. TCUs are founded and chartered by their respective American Indian tribes, which hold a special legal relationship with the Federal Government, actualized by more than 400 treaties, several Supreme Court decisions, prior congressional action, and the ceding of more than one billion acres of land to the Federal Government. Despite the trust responsibility and treaty obligations, the TCUs' primary source of basic operating funds has never been adequately funded. Further, our member institutions--already operating on shoestring budgets--have suffered the ramifications of sequestration and other across-the-board cuts. tcus: ``doing so much with so little'' Tribal Colleges and Universities are an essential component of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) education. Currently, 37 TCUs operate more than 75 campuses and sites in 16 States, within whose geographic boundaries 80 percent of all American Indian reservations and Federal Indian trust land lie. They serve students from well over 250 federally recognized tribes, more than 85 percent of whom receive Federal financial aid--primarily Pell grants. In total, the TCUs annually serve 160,000 AI/ANs and other community members through a wide variety of academic and community-based programs. TCUs are public institutions accredited by independent, regional accreditation agencies and like all U.S. institutions of higher education must regularly undergo stringent performance reviews to retain their accreditation status. Each TCU is committed to improving the lives of its students through higher education and to moving AI/ANs toward self-sufficiency. To do this, TCUs serve many roles in their reservation communities, functioning as community centers, libraries, tribal archives, career and business centers, computer labs, summer camps, community farms, economic development centers, GED/HiSET training and testing centers, child and elder care centers, and more. The Federal Government, despite its direct trust responsibility and binding treaty obligations, has never fully funded TCU institutional operations as authorized under the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act of 1978. Yet despite funding challenges, TCUs are leading the Nation in preparing AI/AN nurses and more recently, in preparing teachers for our Native schools. For example, in 2014, half of all AI/AN special education teachers in Montana graduated from Salish Kootenai College. TCUs train other professionals in high- demand fields, including agriculture and natural resources management, human services, IT technicians, and building tradesmen. By teaching the job skills most in demand on our reservations, TCUs are laying a solid foundation for tribal economic growth, with benefits for surrounding communities, and the Nation as a whole. But that is not enough. TCU leadership understand that we must do more--we must move beyond simple workforce training. Today, TCUs are tackling the tougher--but much more significant--issue of job creation because we know that to break the cycle of generational poverty and end the culture of dependency that grips so much of Indian Country, simply filling jobs that would be filled anyway is not enough. We must create new industries, new businesses, and a culture of self-sufficiency and innovation. Our job creation initiative is focusing initially on advanced manufacturing, through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, National Laboratories, TCUs, and industry. Tribal Colleges continually seek to instill a sense of hope and identity within Native youth, who one day will lead our tribal nations. Unfortunately, the high school drop-out rate for Native students remains around 50 percent. To help address this alarming reality, TCUs are partnering with the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Education to help create a lasting ``college-going culture'' in Indian middle and high schools. TCUs are reaching back to create a bridge for Indian students as early as the elementary school, encouraging them to abandon any notion of dropping out of high school and instead, to think that the natural course is to finish high school and go on to the local TCU. In addition, TCUs offer Dual Credit courses for high school students, provide math teachers for local high schools as a strategy for improving course delivery, host Saturday academies, after school programs and summer camps for middle and high school students, and at the other end of the spectrum, they offer GED training and testing. As noted earlier, the TCUs' operations funding is insufficient, and their budgets are further disadvantaged because, on a per student basis, the colleges receive funding for only about 85 percent of their academic enrollments. Approximately 15 percent of the TCUs' collective enrollments are non-Indian students living in the local community, but TCUs receive Federal funding based only on Indian students, defined as members of a federally recognized tribe or the biological children of enrolled tribal members. While many TCUs do seek funding from their respective State legislatures for their non-Indian, State-resident students (often referred to as ``non-beneficiary'' students) successes have been, at best, inconsistent. Given their locations, often hundreds of miles from another postsecondary institution, TCUs are open to all students, Indian and non-Indian, believing that education in general, and postsecondary education in particular, is a catalyst to a better economic future for their areas. A recent independent, economic impact study proves this, illustrating that TCUs create lasting value from multiple perspectives: students, society, and taxpayers. TCUs elevate their students' lifetime incomes, and this in turn benefits society as a whole by increasing the region's economy and generating a wide array of savings through improved lifestyles. The increased employment benefits taxpayers through increased tax receipts and a reduction in the need for welfare and unemployment benefits. In fact, for every dollar spent the lifetime income of students more than quadruples; society gains over five times the investment in added income and social savings; and the taxpayers get back almost two and a half times the investment. In short, the TCUs are a very sound investment of Federal funds. further justifications & facts --Breaking the cycle of generational poverty: Tribal Colleges and Universities provide access to higher education for American Indians and others living in some of the Nation's most rural and economically depressed areas. In fact, seven of the Nation's 10 poorest counties are home to a TCU. --Growing number of TCUs: Compounding existing funding disparities is the fact that although the numbers of TCUs and students enrolled in TCUs have dramatically increased since they were first funded in 1981, appropriations have increased at a disproportionately low rate. Since 1981, the number of tribal colleges has more than quadrupled and continues to grow; the number of Indian students enrolled has risen over 300 percent. In the past 10 years, six additional TCUs have become accredited and eligible for funding under Title I of the Tribal College Act, and two more colleges are expected to be eligible for Tribal College Act funding as soon as fiscal year 2018. While AIHEC celebrates the growing number of tribally chartered colleges and universities and the increasing numbers of Native students served, these successes have forced TCUs to function with smaller slices of an already inadequate annual funding pie. --Local Tax and Revenue Bases: TCUs cannot rely on a local tax base for revenue. Although tribes have the sovereign authority to tax, high reservation poverty rates, the trust status of reservation lands, and the lack of strong reservation economies hinder the creation of a reservation tax base. As noted earlier, on Indian reservations that are home to TCUs, the unemployment rate can well exceed 70 percent. By contrast, the national unemployment rate is currently 5 percent. --Gaming and the TCUs: Although several of the reservations served by TCUs have gaming operations, the vast majority are not mega- casinos located in urban areas and featured in the broad-based media. Only a handful of TCUs receive regular income from the chartering tribe's gaming revenue, and the amounts received can vary greatly from year to year. Most reservation casinos are small businesses that use their gaming revenue to improve the local standard of living and potentially diversify into other, more sustainable areas of economic development. In the interim, where relevant, local TCUs offer courses in casino management and hospitality services to formally train tribal members to work in their local tribally run casinos. Some form of gaming is legalized in 48 States, but the Federal Government has not used the revenues generated from State gaming as a justification to decrease Federal funding to other public colleges or universities. Some have suggested that those tribes that operate the few extremely successful and widely publicized casinos located in or near urban areas, should be financing higher education for all American Indians. And yet, no State is expected to share its gaming revenue with a less successful or non-gaming State. appropriations request for fiscal year 2017 As noted earlier, it has been over 35 years since the Tribal College Act was first funded, and the TCUs have yet to receive the congressionally authorized per Indian student funding level. Full funding for the TCUs' institutional operating grants ($8,000 per Indian student) for fiscal year 2017 would require an increase of approximately $19.4 million over the fiscal year 2016 appropriated level. Additionally, to transition the three federally chartered TCUs to receive their operations funding on an academic schedule, rather than the Federal fiscal year, requires a $18.2 million one-time appropriation (IAIA--$3.4 million (in addition to the $2 million included in the President's budget; Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute--$14.8 million). Additionally, if the subcommittee determines that forward funding is to be achieved through incremental appropriations, language needs to be included directing that funds appropriated to partially fund the transition to forward funding are to be held until the needed sum (75 percent of full year funding) is accrued. conclusion AIHEC Member institutions/Tribal Colleges and Universities provide quality higher education to thousands of American Indians and other reservation residents, as well as essential community programs and services to those who might otherwise not have access to such opportunities. The modest Federal investment that has been made in TCUs has paid great dividends in terms of employment, education, and economic development. Continuation of this investment makes sound moral and fiscal sense. We greatly appreciate your past and continued support of the Nation's Tribal Colleges and Universities and your careful consideration of our fiscal year 2017 appropriations requests. ______ Prepared Statement of the American Lung Association The American Lung Association is pleased to present our recommendations for fiscal year 2017 to the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. The work to monitor and clean up harmful air pollution funded by this subcommittee will prevent asthma attacks, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths across the country. Founded in 1904 to fight tuberculosis, the American Lung Association is the oldest voluntary health organization in the United States. The American Lung Association is the leading organization working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through education, advocacy and research. Support and Defend EPA's Programs to Address Climate Change and Improve Air Quality Mr. Chairman, the Clean Air Act is a key public health safeguard. It is especially important for populations most at risk, including those with asthma and other lung diseases; children; older adults; people living in low-income communities; people who work, exercise or play outdoors; and people with heart disease and diabetes. We urge you to invest in protecting public health from the impacts of dangerous air pollution. We also urge you to reject any policy riders that would block, delay or weaken EPA's ability to save lives and improve public health by reducing air pollution, including carbon pollution from power plants and ground-level ozone pollution. State, Tribal, and Local Government Work to Improve Air Quality The American Lung Association requests that the subcommittee provide $171 million for Federal Support for Air Quality Management. The Federal Support for Air Quality Management Program assists States, tribes, and local air pollution control agencies in the administration of programs and standards to protect the air we breathe. States have the primary responsibility for developing clean air measures necessary to meet Federal standards, but rely on support and assistance from EPA to create effective comprehensive air quality management programs. The EPA also supports training for State, tribal, and local air pollution professionals on rulemakings and other significant actions. The American Lung Association also requests that the subcommittee provide $268.2 million for Categorical Grants: State and Local Air Quality Management and $12.829 million for Categorical Grants: Tribal Air Quality Management. State, local and tribal air pollution agencies need more funding, not less, to ensure proper protection of the public through implementation of the Clean Air Act. These agencies are on the front lines of vital efforts to improve air quality and protect public health, yet they are perennially underfunded. This must change in order to secure the benefits promised by Clean Air Act protections. Climate Change Climate change is one of the greatest threats to public health, including lung health. The health threats posed by climate change include worsened air pollution, the spread of diseases into new areas, stronger and longer heat waves, and more frequent and severe droughts. The EPA has a critical role to play in reducing carbon pollution, methane, and other climate pollutants and must have the resources needed to meet the challenge ahead. Reducing climate pollutants will save lives and protect health. We request that the subcommittee provide $115.9 million for the Climate Protection Program. Radon Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States, and the EPA's State Indoor Radon Grants are the only nati"
