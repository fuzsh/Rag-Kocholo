        "text": "Off a 1964 album of traditional music from Beech Mountain, NC\n\nHe was from Beech Mountain, and lived in a one-room house on his son’s land, high up on the mountain\n\n“Little Maggie” is related to the songs “Country Blues” and “Darlin’ Corey,” and was first collected in the Appalachian region in the 1800s\n\nIt’s possible that it was brought to Beech Mountain by men who had been cutting timber in West Virginia\n\nThey are a vocal quartet formed in Virginia by four high school students in 1934\n\nThey are still active today, but have undergone several changes in membership\n\nThis is a hymn written by RE Winsett\n\nThe Golden Gate Quartet recorded their version in 1937\n\nHe was a musician from Tennessee who wrote many protest songs during the Great Depression, often under different pseudonyms\n\nHe called his music “main street music,” meaning simple, socially aware music directed at the common man\n\nThis song was recorded on February 25, 1931 in New York City under the name “Bob Ferguson and his Scalawaggers”\n\nVan Ronk was a member of the Greenwich Village folk scene in New York City, known as the “Mayor of MacDougal Street”, MacDougal Street being where practically every coffeehouse in New York was located in the 1960s\n\nFrom his 1964 album Inside Dave Van Ronk\n\nIt’s a traditional song about the biblical tale of Samson and Delilah\n\nTerry was a blind musician who lost his vision at 16, which prevented him from doing farm work and caused him to rely on music for a living\n\nThis is a popular country blues song with countless versions\n\nFrom the 1952 album Sonny Terry: Harmonica and Vocal Solos\n\nThis was released in 1970 and appears to be Smith’s first and only recording\n\nThe only other available information about her is that she was a member of the 1968 cast of the musical HAIR on Broadway\n\nAbbott was 84 when Edith Fowke recorded him in his home in 1957 for the album Lumbering Songs from the Ontario Shanties, which was released in 1961\n\nThis song is one of many that describes daily life at a particular camp, though this song highlights the differences between lumbering camps and square timber camps, which prepared wood in square timber format to be shipped to Britain with less space wasted on the ship\n\nFowke notes that this song likely goes back to at least the 1860s, as wood stopped being shipped as square timber around 1870\n\nFrom an album of Ontario folk songs from 1958\n\nThis ballad was widely collected in both Britain and North America\n\nMurrin learned it from her grandfather, who was from Frontenac County, Ontario\n\nThe tune she uses is from the Irish song “Old Rosin the Beau”\n\nThis is off the 1978 album Songs for Children from New York City, which was recorded in playgrounds, summer camps, and schools in New York in 1978 by the musician, educator, and author Dr. Edna Smith-Edet\n\nThis is an example of hambone, also known as buckdancing, Juba dance, or patting juba\n\nIt was used to keep time for other dancers at parties, and involves stomping, slapping and patting one’s legs, arms, chest, and cheeks\n\nThe tradition was originally brought by enslaved people to the southern United States\n\nLyrics and music were added in the mid 19th century, and the tradition was publicly performed\n\nThis is a standardised song that’s known as “hambone,” and it contains some of the same lyrics as “Hush Little Baby”\n\nWe’ll hear a few other examples of hambone after this\n\n“Hush Little Baby” shares lyrics with “Hambone”\n\nOdetta was a musician whose music has been called the “soundtrack to the Civil Rights movement”\n\nShe was born in Birmingham, Alabama and had operatic vocal training from the age of 13\n\nThis is from her 1960 album Ballad for Americans and Other American Ballads\n\nIt’s a traditional lullaby likely from the southern US, which has a simple rhyming structure that allows the addition of new verses which can make the song last as long as the singer chooses, just as hambone also works\n\nBorn and raised in Ontario, but known for his maritime-influenced music that was informed by his time spent visiting family in Nova Scotia during his childhood\n\nThis song is off the live album Home in Halifax, recorded in March of 1982 and released in 1993\n\nShe’s a singer and actress from New Brunswick who began performing as a young child\n\nThis is from her first album, Voice of an Angel, from 1964\n\nIt’s an 18th century folk ballad also known as “The Turtle Dove” or “Fare Thee Well”\n\nThe earliest published version of the song appeared in England in 1710\n\nHopkins was a country blues musician from Texas who gained a broader audience with the folk revival of the 1960s after recording and performing around Texas in the 40s and 50s\n\nHe continued to tour and record throughout the 60s and 70s, and was Houston, Texas’s poet in residence for 35 years\n\nThe song was written by Blind Lemon Jefferson and first recorded in 1927\n\nRecorded January, 1959 in Texas\n\nCanadian folk singer, writer, and actor from Lachine, Quebec\n\nKnown for popularising Canadian folk music, and for writing “I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly”\n\nMade a member of the Order of Canada in 1974 for his contributions to Canadian folklore\n\nThis shanty is sometimes called “Homeward Bound,” and was often sung when a ship was preparing to leave a foreign port and sail home"
