For more info:\n\nJohn Reese, jreese@scn.org, 206-568-7110 or Community Action Network\n\ncan@drizzle.com\n\nThis link is to a translation of a May 23rd article in Yediot Ahronot titled\n\nâA Wall in the Heart.â\n\nhttp://electronicintifada.net/v2/article1546.shtml\n\nThese links have additional information on the wall including maps.\n\nhttp://www.gush-shalom.org/thewall/index.html ,\n\nhttp://www.poica.org/casestudies/Changing%20Wall%20Path%2016-06-03/index.htm.\n\nThe Israeli government continues to build a massive wall to surround\n\nPalestinian areas and turn their ghettos into large prisons. Twice as high and\n\nplanned-to-be three times as long as the Berlin Wall, Israel's latest project of\n\ndispossession has already uprooted tens of thousands of Palestinian fruit and\n\nolive trees and has destroyed or isolated from Palestinian farmers tens of\n\nthousands of dunams of farmland, de facto confiscating the Palestinian people's most\n\nfertile land and most important water wells. Entire farming communities are\n\nlosing all of their agricultural land. More statistics:10% of the West Bank\n\nwill be confiscated by and for Israel by the path of this wall. As of December\n\n2002, some 11,500 dunams of land have been razed for the footprint of the\n\nwall, and 83,000 trees uprooted. Over 31 groundwater wells will be in the\n\nconfiscated areas of the wall's first phase. A number of villages are to lose their\n\nONLY source of water. Land confiscation, destruction, and severe restriction\n\nof movement will translate into the loss of over 6,500 jobs. Over 100\n\nbuildings have thusfar been destroyed to make way for the wall, mainly shops, an\n\nimportant source of income for families and communities At least 17 Palestinian\n\ncommunities will be trapped between the wall and the Green Line. Some\n\ncommunities will be surrounded on all sides by the wall.\n\nIf completed as planned, some 95,000 Palestinians will be isolated. A number\n\nof small villages have been informed that their proximity to the wall will\n\ndeem most of their community demolished. Courtesy of PENGON.

Hundreds of homes in\n\nRafah were wantonly demolished last month in an\n\nindiscriminate campaign of destruction that Amnesty\n\nInternational labeled a âwar crimeâ. Thousands of\n\npeople, already impoverished, were then left homeless,\n\nand the campaign of home destruction continued with\n\nscores of houses leveled in the month of November. A\n\ngrave humanitarian crisis is taking shape, with many\n\ninjured persons cut off from medical care by the\n\nIsraeli Occupation forces, and local hospitals unable\n\nto cope with the growing number of casualties.\n\nOne international volunteer currently working in Rafah\n\nsent this dispatch on November 19th, which gives a\n\nlook into the grim daily existence of Gaza:\n\nWe are spending much of our days visiting families who\n\nhave lost children and other family members from\n\nIsraeli bullets. The other day in Gaza City, halfway\n\nthrough Ramadan, a very poor family lost one of its\n\nsons. The 13 year old was out catching birds with\n\nother kids from the neighborhood when an Israeli\n\nmilitary foot patrol came upon them. The autopsy\n\nreport describes the child as being shot 17 times at\n\nclose range and his face was injured from being\n\nstomped on by the soldiersâ boots. His arm was broken\n\nwhen they dragged him from the place of his murder to\n\nthe border, in order to claim they shot him because he\n\ngot too close to the Green Line.\n\nIn Rafah, another 13 year old child was shot in the\n\nstomach on his way\n\nhome from school. That day there was an unusual amount\n\nof gunfire all day longâ¦In Block O, one of the refugee\n\ncamps along the border, this child was just getting\n\nout of class and on his way home when he was either\n\ntargeted or hit with a stray bullet. He was not killed\n\ninstantly, but was taken to the ICU where over the\n\ncourse of 3 days was given 16 liters of blood. In the\n\nend the doctors could not stop the bleeding and the\n\nchild died.\n\nStories of such atrocities are almost entirely absent\n\nfrom U.S. media reporting, yet are common fare to\n\nthose involved in solidarity work inside Palestine.\n\nAs citizens of the country that finances and enables\n\nthe Occupation, we are trying to provide some\n\nimmediate relief and hope to the victims, while laying\n\nthe foundation for long-term change.\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe concept of an Olympia-to-Rafah sister city\n\nrelationship was begun last year by our friend and\n\ncolleague Rachel Corrie, who was killed by an Israeli\n\nmilitary bulldozer on March 16. Rachel insisted on\n\nliving in Rafah because she thought it was there that\n\npeople faced the occupationâs harshest conditions. It\n\nis well known that she was a member of the\n\nInternational Solidarity Movement and that she lost\n\nher life defending a Palestinian familyâs home from\n\ndestruction. Not so well known were her efforts at\n\nestablishing a sister-city relationship. She traveled\n\nto Rafah with the names of school children from her\n\nhometown, seeking to pair them with counterparts in\n\nRafah in a pen-pal exchange. She imagined all sorts\n\nof cultural exchanges, aid projects, and direct ways\n\nof connecting people across the many barriers of\n\ndistance, language and misunderstanding that separate\n\nus. She believed that only then might our countryâs\n\nmisguided policies be confronted and changed.\n\nAlthough Rachelâs life was cut short, many of us were\n\ninspired by her and have resolved to carry out her\n\nproject. Beginning with a small core group, we have\n\nsteadily expanded since our formation last Spring. A\n\nnumber of our members have gone to live in Rafah,\n\nbuilding connections with people and institutions\n\nthere. We have begun a Fair Trade exchange for\n\nPalestinian artwork through the Union of Palestinian\n\nWomen, we support a Center for Disabled Persons, we\n\nhave sponsored cultural exchanges, and we offer\n\ntranslation between English and Arabic for our pen-pal\n\nprogram. You can find out more about us, or contact\n\nus, through our website at http://www.orscp.org/.\n\nWhat You Can Help With Right Now\n\nRight now the people in Rafah are asking us for help\n\nin obtaining medical equipment and supplies. The idea\n\nof a Sister City in the U.S. has raised hopes inside\n\nRafah, and we wish to respond to their appeal as\n\ngenerously as possible. While we have longer-term\n\nideas about setting up doctor exchanges and assistance\n\nfrom local hospitals, we would like to respond to the\n\nmore immediate request of obtaining medical supplies.\n\nOur groupâs ability to respond to such an appeal is\n\nlimited, and so we are reaching out to you for\n\nassistance.\n\nAny contribution you can make to support this project\n\nwill be fully tax-deductible, and our transfer of\n\nfunds to Palestine will be completely legal and\n\ntransparent. Our 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor is the Middle\n\nEast Childrensâ Alliance in Berkeley, CA, directed by\n\nlongtime activist Barbara Lubin. If you are not\n\nfamiliar with them, see their website at\n\nhttp://www.mecaforpeace.org/. MECA is one of the\n\nmost established aid organizations in the U.S. working\n\nin the Mideast.\n\nThe funds they send to Rafah for us will be\n\ndistributed through Dr. Mona El-Farar of the Union of\n\nHealth Work Committees. You can read Dr. El-Fararâs\n\nrecent report on Rafahâs medical crisis at\n\nhttp://electronicintifada.net/v2/article2054.shtml.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us by\n\nphone at (360) 867-0290 or via email at\n\ntomwright59@comcast.net.\n\nThank you so much for your help.\n\nTom Wright and Therese Saliba\n\nThis is due to several FBI interviews have been reported in the area in the\n\nlast few days. Please distribute where appropriate. WHAT TO DO IF THE FBI OR\n\nPOLICE CONTACT YOU FOR QUESTIONING\n\nThe US government has announced its intention to interview people of Arabic\n\norigin living in the US. This bulletin informs you how to respond in a way\n\nthat will protect your rights when the FBI, Immigration officials, or police\n\ncontact you for questioning.\n\nIf the FBI or police contact you to ask questions, you have the right to\n\nhave a lawyer present. It is your right and your choice whether you get a\n\nlawyer. A lawyer is a legal witness who will protect your rights. If you are a\n\nnon-citizen, it is more important that you have a lawyer.\n\nIf an FBI agent or police officer asks to speak to you, and you would\n\nprefer to have a lawyer, tell him or her that you want to consult with that lawyer\n\nfirst. Write down the name, agency, and telephone number of the person who\n\ncalls or visits you. Tell them that your lawyer will contact them soon.\n\nThen CONTACT SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY.\n\nACLU can provide confidential free legal advice.\n\n(206) 624-2184\n\n24-hour Arab Hotline for Arabic speakers\n\ntakes hate incident reports &\n\ngives referrals to legal advisors.\n\n(206) 634-9001\n\nANY information you give to an officer without a lawyer, even if it seems\n\nharmless, can be used against you or someone else. Lying to an officer is a cr\n\nime. Remaining silent is NOT a crime.\n\nYou are NOT required to allow the officer into your home or office without\n\na warrant. Ask to see the warrant, the officers ID and get his serial\n\nnumber. If the officer refuses to show you any of these, do not let him in, call\n\n911 immediately. Tell the person that you are doing this.\n\nIf the officer says that he has a warrant for your arrest, you have a\n\nright to see the warrant. You must go with the officer, BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO\n\nANSWER QUESTIONS UNTIL YOU CONSULT A LAWYER.\n\nÂ· If you are detained, you should ask for a lawyer and remain silent.\n\nIf you are detained in an immigration detention center, ask for contact\n\ninformation for lawyers.\n\nPLEASE CALL FOR HELPâ\n\nAND LET OTHERS KNOW ABOUT THIS INFORMATION\n\nGood Luck,The Arab American Community Coalition\n\nA reader adds:\n\nAnother note based on my friends' experience: the FBI will not ask to enter\n\nyour house. If you open the door, they will walk straight by you into the\n\nhouse, warrant or no. If they show up at your door, do not open it. If you\n\nhave a chain lock, leave it locked and only open the door as far as the\n\nchain\n\nallows you to. Otherwise, talk (or refuse to talk) through the door. Do\n\nnot\n\ngive them the opportunity to walk into your house, because they will take it.\n\n--dk\n\n---------------------------------"
