Taj Mahal believes that his 1999 album Kulanjan, which features him playing with the kora master of Mali's Griot tradition Toumani DiabatÃ©, \"embodies his musical and cultural spirit arriving full circle.\" To him it was an experience that allowed him to reconnect with his African heritage, striking him with a sense of coming home. In 2014, he received the Americana Music Association's Lifetime Achievement award.\n\nwww.tajblues.com\n\nIsla St Clair (*2 May 1952, Grangemouth, Scotland).

The chart is first announced to the public at 7pm GMT as part of the Official Folk Albums Chart Show presented by Folk on Foot via their YouTube channel. Eight new releases have entered the Top 40 chart this month with half digging into the well of UKâs traditional music, including Bryony Griffiths & Alice Jones who come together as a force for the Yorkshire Tradition, singing songs from their native county.\n\n30:Happy Returns (Pure Records) is the brand-new No.1 from singer Kate Rusby, a joyous celebration of her impressive 30-year career. Since her first âproper gigâ in 1992, Kate has gone on to release 19 widely praised albums and earn the title of âFirst Lady Of Folkâ. Returning to points in her career, Kate has selected 15 songs that have been recrafted and newly recorded. The importance of people met and songs sung is reflected by the stellar array of guest musicians who appear with her - Ladysmith Black Mambazo on the exhilarating stand out track, âWe Will Singâ, Richard Hawley, Darlingside, KT Tunstall, Sarah Jarosz and more. Throughout, Katesâ unique pure voice shines through.\n\nStraight in at No.4 is Nine Waves (River Lea Recordings), from contemporary folk duo, Ye Vagabonds, Irish brothers Diarmuid and BrÃ­an Mac Gloinn. Recorded in the Dublin Mountains, the album is a superb collection of traditional and original songs with their distinctive brotherly harmonies at its heart. Songs are soft, gentle and brooding with delicate arrangements and airy soundscapes. Both accomplished multi-instrumentalists, they are supported by cello and double bass from Irish contemporary classical group Crash Ensemble, alongside piano, saxophone, concertina and harmonium. A beautifully tentative, reflective and languid collection of songs.\n\nIn at No.5 is Nick Hart Sings Ten English Folk Songs (Roebuck Records) from roots singer and multi-instrumentalist Nick Hart. A departure from the stripped back approach of his first two albums, here, Hart has explored a different approach to the accompaniment of traditional song and augmented his distinctive guitar playing with harmonium, lyre, viols and a host of percussion and woodwinds, with some songs given a more multi-layered treatment. Central to the album is Harts deep respect for the nuances of traditional song and to the importance he places on story-telling, approaching the songs with the care and sensitivity for which he has become known.\n\nSing It For A Lifetime (Heidi Talbot) is the new entrant at No.10 from Irish-born singer Heidi Talbot, the latest in her 20-year career. Charting the painful split from her husband, folk musician John McCusker, Talbot presents her most exposed and personal work through a combination of self-penned songs and exquisitely chosen covers reflecting the huge changes in her life. With an international group of musicians including Mark Knopfler on guitar and the Appalachian fiddle legend and country producer Dirk Powell, and with the freedom to experiment and push boundaries, Talbot hit upon a blend of Celtic and Americana that sees her delicate, floaty, nightingale voice soar.\n\nThe Edge Of The Land (Lightship) is the compelling sophomore album from progressive folk singer-songwriter and guitarist, Katie Spencer, landing at No.14. Raised in the East Yorkshire flatlands, Katieâs landscape is that of open skies and widening rivers and itâs this sense of space and movement that flows through her music. Artists such as Joni Mitchell and James Taylor seep into her sound, carrying with them the idealism of the early 70âs folk movements. Songs explore themes of home, solitude and love against a backdrop of intricate finger-style guitar and Katieâs distinctive voice. Delicate and un-rushed, yet the intimacy and introspection still remain.\n\nThe only debut to enter the May chart is Youngest Daughter (Xtra Mile) from pop-folk quartet, Guise, in at No. 18. Fronted by singer-songwriter, Jess Guise, the album is filled with autobiographical songs written from the heart during a passage of personal reflection taking the listener on a voyage of love, loss, hope and personal growth. Produced by husband Frank Turner, Jessicaâs delicate, cooing vocals and layered harmonies take centre stage with fiddles and flutes. The lush arrangements of the 13 tracks are as sweet and soulful as the characters of the songs themselves.\n\nEstablished solo artists in their own right, Bryony Griffith & Alice Jones come together to release A Year Too Late And A Month (Splid) taking their position at No. 20. Both Griffith, a highly regarded fiddle player and singer, and Jones, a singer, step-dancer and multi-instrumentalist, hail from the close-knit communities of West Yorkshire and are long-time purveyors of traditional English folk music. United by a mutual passion for the folk songs of their county, the album draws on stories inspired by the landscape, language and industry of their surroundings. Heart rending unaccompanied tales of woe meet with lively ditties and other masterful interpretations of treasured old songs.\n\nAlso steeped in a great love for the traditional music of Britain, is Cornwall-based singer and multi-instrumentalist Angeline Morrison whose new recording, The Brown Girl And Other Folk Songs (Angeline Morrison) is in at No.24. Using her distinctive, dark, but sweet voice as the main instrument, Morrison layers vocal harmonies, often unaccompanied, to communicate the feelings as well as the stories in this collection of traditional songs. Her sparse use of traditional instrumentation is used to great effect allowing the beauty of the song to shine. Recording the songs that most move her emotionally, Angelineâs collection of intimately performed songs makes for a powerful listen.\n\nOfficial Folk Albums Chart APRIL 2022\n\nOn Tuesday 3 May the Official Charts Company in partnership with English Folk Expo reveal the Top 40 best-selling and most streamed folk albums released in the APRIL reporting period. The chart is first announced to the public at 7pm GMT as part of the Official Folk Albums Chart Show presented by Folk on Foot via their YouTube channel.\n\nSix new releases have entered the Top 40 chart this month. Birds That Flew And Ships That Sailed (Black Crow) is the brand-new No.1 from Brighton-based singer-songwriter musician, Passenger, aka Mike Rosenberg. Although Rosenberg released two albums with folk-rock band, Passenger in 2007 and 2009, it was his hit single âLet Her Goâ and an album self -funded by busking that catapulted him to stardom in 2012. This is his 14th album, released out of the blue, entirely independently. Banjo, guitars, strings and occasional horns are accompanied by his distinctive, intimate voice, clever wordplay and heartfelt lyrics that speak of human impermanence and the passing of time. A beautiful and resonate album.\n\nAt No.3 is Ink of the Rosy Morning (Topic) from Cambridge folk duo, Hannah Sanders & Ben Savage. The album was recorded in a quiet room, just the two of them, nothing prepared, a few mics, a bottle of wine and a bunch of âgreat old songsâ the pair have known for a long time. A touch of Americana, yet quintessentially English, their traditional yet contemporary style is playful and instinctive. Hannah has a voice of disarming purity; harmonies are exquisite and songs dreamy. Subtitled âA Sampling of Folk Songs from Britain and North Americaâ, songs are played in true Sanders/Savage fashion, with unique sensitivity, and panache with the natural chemistry between them making this an undeniably intimate record.\n\nMasters of blissful psychedelic folk and harmony-laden cosmic country, Hanging Stars release their fourth album, Hollow Heart (Loose Music) entering the Top 10 at No.11. Favouring sound as much as song, the London five-piece recorded the album at Edwyn Collins Scottish studio resulting in a more sonically varied and contemporary recording. Throughout, the vocal arrangements amaze and the breadth of instrumental exploration inspires awe. Songwriting is intricate and the captivating meld of swirling electric and pedal steel guitars with dreamy vocals exudes the warm, rootsy psychedelia that the band are renowned for. This is the bandâs most assured collection of songs to date.\n\nLanding at No.16, The Struggle (Cherry Red) is singer-songwriter Michael Weston Kingâs first studio album in 10 years in an almost 30-year musical career on the roots music scene. Drawing inspiration from songwriters of the late 60âs and early 70âs such as Mickey Newbury, Dan Penn, John Prine, and early Van Morrison, King skillfully fuses his love of country music with a distinctive political edge to produce an album uniquely his own. While this collection of new songs still has a ring of country soul about them, they have taken on a folkier, more earthy sound. The sound is lush and atmospheric while songs are compassionate and thought-provoking.\n\nBound to Rise (Chris Brain) is the debut album from Leeds-based, Yorkshire-born Alt-folk artist Chris Brain entering the chart at No.22 Recorded on analogue tape, the album captures the shoulder-to-shoulder warmth of a live setting through 10 live performances. Firmly rooted in place, the album is an enthralling meditation on nature, with glimpses of the confessional. Chris explores distinctive finger picking patterns and alternate tunings in his sound, and with the addition of piano and violin, renders a work embedded in folk tradition and the pastoral, with a contemporary resonance.\n\nHallival (Hudson) is the remarkable debut from Leeds-based folk singer songwriter Iona Lane in at No.36. Fascinated by folklore and legends from across the British Isles, the album is inspired by natural landscapes, scientific discoveries, equality, human relationships and the supernatural, all bound by a strong sense of place and a love of wild settings. Lane plays guitar and shruti box and is joined by guests that include Lauren MacColl, Rachel Newton and Jenny Sturgeon. Ionaâs expressive, charming voice lace a set of well-crafted, imaginative all-original songs that are haunting and sparse. Hallival is informed by the folk tradition but heads out on its own contemporary journey of exploration\n\nOfficial Folk Albums Chart MARCH 2022\n\nOn Tuesday 5 April the Official Charts Company in partnership with English Folk Expo reveal the Top 40 best-selling and most streamed folk albums released in the MARCH reporting period. The chart is first announced to the public at 7pm GMT as part of the Official Folk Albums Chart Show presented by Folk on Foot via their YouTube channel.\n\nFive new releases have entered the Top 40 chart this month. Straight in at No.1 is Read The Sky (Running Man), the 12th studio recording from folk-rock legends, Oysterband. Despite an 8-year gap since their last recording, the collection displays an undiminished creative energy and a storytelling that has become more personal and more emotionally truthful. In writing about the world they experience, Oysterband's politically-alert songs have become more implicit and more urgently green, both in anger and in elegy. Their combination of guitars, keys and drums with melodeon, violin, cello and mandolin with forceful vocals makes for a rhythmic sound that packs a punch. Despite some hard-hitting themes, their brand of rootsy folk-rock and rousing choruses is uplifting and joyous.\n\nThe second and final Top 20 entry comes from Samana, the pairing of Rebecca Rose Harris and Franklin Mockett. Their sophomore release, All In One Breath (Music for Heroes) lands at No.6. Recorded when stranded in the French countryside during the lockdown of 2020, songs weave between various musical styles from progressive folk to an experimental, transcendental take on soul, blues, and rock. The album documents their beautiful surroundings and the silence, solitude and the boundless sense of the destruction of the time. Many of the songs are improvisations with the albumâs shifting sonic palette combining squalling, twangy guitars with meditative and understated parts. Vocals are sombre and compositions hypnotic, often dark with a sound that is raw, beautifully alive and uniquely striking.\n\nOn Sinners Shrine (Wrasse) in at No.23, Scottish singer-songwriter Dean Owens surrenders to the intoxicating sounds of Americaâs desert states, travelling to Arizona to record with musicians from iconic Latin rockers, Calexico. While still rooted in his signature Americana-alt country sound, the album sees him adding desert noir and Latin notes to his musical palette. Stories of love and lust, sinners and saints, the displaced and the wanderers showcase Owensâ gift for storytelling and searingly soulful voice infused with the guttural guitar of Joey Burns and John Convertinoâs masterful drumming and sweeping mariachi horns. Music conjures the open roadâs wild romanticism, distilling the Scottish and Americana into a unique blend.\n\nA new entry at No.25 is Moch (Arc Music) from modern trad fusion band DLÃ. A truly remarkable album, Moch champions the Gaelic language and culture, celebrating the generations who have fought, and continue to fight, against its neglect. The four founder members - Moilidh NicGriogair, Zach Ronan, Aidan Speirs and Andrew Grossart - first met at Glasgowâs all-Gaelic school later calling in Jack Dorrian to complete the young Scottish Gaels line-up. DLÃ combine uplifting, fast-paced traditional Scottish tunes with their influences of funk, rock, pop and classical to create an uplifting, energetic sound that is uniquely their own.\n\nAfter The City (GFM) is the 3rd release from Brighton-based Bird In The Belly landing at No.36. Inspired by âAfter Londonâ, the 1885 post-apocalyptic novel by Richard Jeffries that describes Englandâs slow rot and eventual renewal following a catastrophe, the ambitious concept album beguiles and disturbs in equal measure. Rich with their trademark âfolk noirâ sound, the album is cinematic and beautifully crafted. Ben Webbâs gravel-edged vocal fuses with the crystal-clear voice of Laura Ward underpinned by an array of instruments that include violin, bass pedal, synth, banjo and bodhran by Adam Ronchetti and Tom Pryor. A startling, theatrical album from an uncompromising collective who continue to be a revelation.\n\nOfficial Folk Albums Chart FEBRUARY 2022\n\nOn Tuesday 1 March the Official Charts Company in partnership with English Folk Expo reveal the Top 40 best-selling and most streamed folk albums released in the FEBRUARY reporting period. The chart is first announced to the public at 7pm GMT as part of the Official Folk Albums Chart Show presented by Folk on Foot via their YouTube channel.\n\nThree new releases have entered the Top 40 chart this month. Sailing straight into the No.1 slot is Smoke & Oakum (Decca) from the Longest Johns, the trailblazing band at the forefront of the recent sea shanties phenomenon. Featuring a combination of legendary folk songs and thrilling originals, the four friends from Bristol pay homage to protest singers and folk luminaries through the years shining a new light on songs that hold a torch up to the truth. From powerful a capella arrangements to traditional accompanying instrumentation (banjo, whistle, harmonium), the collection of songs combines rousing sing-alongs to melancholic numbers demonstrating their authenticity and unfailing allure.\n\nTwo of Scotlandâs foremost traditional musicians and composers, fiddler Lauren MacColl and harpist-singer, Rachel Newton come together to release their self-titled album, Heal & Harrow (Shadowside) straight in at No.4. The album is a captivating original work that pays tribute to the many Scottish women who were executed as witches in the 16th and 17th centuries. Each piece is inspired by real women who were caught up in the persecutions, or characters from folklore that fired the imaginations of Newton and MacColl. Stark, spectral and stripped back yet exquisitely tender, the album melds haunting harp and sensitive fiddle melodies with the engaging, sometimes eerie voice of Newton, singing in both English and Gaelic. The hypnotic music, readings and songs act as a restorative salve to the heart-breaking âhate crimeâ stories of women burnt at the stake for being âdifferentâ. Itâs an emotive, beautifully crafted release and a work of dignity and emotional healing.\n\nScottish modern folk group, Talisk jump into the Top 10 landing at No.9 with their third release, Dawn (Talisk). Renowned for their high energy, foot stompinâ live shows, Talisk are one of the quintessential bands of the genre, breaking down boundaries and bringing folk right into the mainstream. With stunning musicianship, the trio, Mohsen Amini, a demon, quickfire concertina player, Graeme Armstrong on guitars and Benedict Morris on fiddle, produce their instantly enthralling signature sound. Tracks are multi-layered and artfully woven with songs combining intricate, gentle melodies and an epic, exhilarating sound.\n\nEnglish Folk Expo have announced the five young people who will take part in their new Trainee Promoter Programme, an initiative to support the next generation of music industry professionals into sustainable careers through learning meaningful skills and building professional networks. Aged between 18-25, the participants - Barney Whittaker, Edi Milner, Jasmine Rowland, Kate Gambhir and Safa Majid -will work with the EFEx team to deliver a range of live music events throughout the year including Rochdale Folk Festival, Campfire Clubs and Manchester Folk Festival.\n\nThe Official Folk Albums Chart is a Top 40 chart, released monthly. It is open to artists where at least one band member is a UK or Irish musician. Charts are based on physical sales, digital downloads and streams. Charts will be sent out by email on request on the first Monday of every month and will be available to view at englishfolkexpo.com and officialcharts.com. Tracks from the full Top 40 folk albums can be heard at the Official Folk Albums Chart Spotify Playlist\n\nThe Songs for Social Change Contest is On!\n\nRAWA (the Renaissance Artists and Writers Association) is now accepting entries in its seventh consecutive Songs for Social Change songwriting competition at https://rawa.net/songs-for-social-change/. Formed in 1958, RAWA is a worldwide movement of artists, writers and musicians working to restore art to its role as an instrument for social change and awakening. RAWAâs annual songwriting competition looks for songs âwith lyrics addressing the social issues confronting society today.â\n\nâSongs for Social Change shines a light on the music we hope will inspire people to build a world where there is social and economic justice for all people,â said RAWA spokesperson Ed Glassman. âWe have received close to two thousand entries since the contest began in 2014,â Glassman added.\n\nThe winner of the contest receives $500, as well as publicity that can be a career booster. The wining song is featured on a yearly compilation album, along with ten contest finalists. The album is distributed to radio stations around the world as well as sold on the RAWA website (www.rawa.net).\n\nThe 2021 winner Harris, remarked that the modest contest entry fee âwas the best $5.00 that I ever spent.â Mary Lou Fulton, the winner of the 2019 contest said \"Songs for Social Change was a turning point in my life as an artist. For the first time, my music was featured in news media coverage, on folk radio stations and podcasts. This recognition from RAWA gave me the confidence to record my first album, We'll Tell Stories, which reached the Top 15 on the FAI Folk Charts last fall and was featured on more than 200 radio stations across the nation.â\n\nâThe entry process is easy,â Glassman noted. âGo to our website and upload your song and information.

The recent Sands Family Tour in Germany was a very rewarding experience for us on so many levels; and, hopefully, also for all those who came along to the 10 concerts. Once again, we were reminded that we write and perform our music because that is what we love to do - and itâs a really big buzz when audiences show that they enjoy it a lot, too!\n\nThe tour was planned quite some time ago, but the arrival of Corona caused it to be delayed by over two years. During that long wait, it certainly looked like it could be the Sands Familyâs final German tour. But the reception we received from audiences - and the enjoyment it gave to us - has forced us to think again about that. Letâs see what the future holds.\n\nSo, take good care â stay safe and healthy!\n\nAll the best for now, Ben Sands\n\nThe Foolhardy Folk Festival\n\nReturning for its second year - Beans on Toast - proudly presentsâ¦ THE FOOLHARDY FOLK FESTIVAL 2022!\n\nTaking place at the beautiful Nottingham Arboretum park in the heart of the city, the cult folk hero and festival veteran will curate a day of life-affirming music on the Summer Bank Holiday Sunday (28 August).\n\nCalling on some of his closest musical compadres, expect performances from SHE DREW THE GUN, WILL VARLEY, HOLY MOLY & THE CRACKERS, KITTY LIV (Kitty, Daisy & Lewis), GAZ BROOKFIELD, JACK FLANAGAN (Mystery Jets), and Nottinghamâs own GEORGIE; not to mention a set from BEANS ON TOAST himself.\n\nMusic, Trees and revelry will be the order of the day, with the festival offering a unique opportunity to see some of the UK's most exciting acts playing stripped back sets live from the Arboretum's bespoke bandstand venue.\n\nStreet food stands and a pop-up beer festival will also be on site to keep attendees refreshed throughout the day.\n\nSpeaking about what to expect from the second edition of the FOOLHARDY FOLK FESTIVAL, Beans on Toast says: âIt'll be a wonderful, family-friendly event filled with brilliant music, good company, tasty food, cold drinks and warm sunshine in a truly beautiful setting, all for the bargain price of Â£25. Nice one!â\n\nChiming with the release of his book âFoolhardy Folk Talesâ, the inaugural Foolhardy Folk Festival was launched in 2021. Back by popular demand, the festival returns bigger, better and with a brand new lineup for 2022.\n\nCaDansa Balfolkfestival\n\nCaDansa, a dutch Balfolk festival, is going into the 10th year (and unfortunately due to the last few years, the 8th edition). While the festival is being held in the Netherlands, we get about 60% of our visitors from abroad, and quite a lot from Germany!\n\nCaDansa, a wonderful festival full of crazy bands, funny games, beautiful connections, good coffee, local beers, and a whole lot of dancing! We hope to see you all in Steenwijk(NL) for CaDansa 2022 October 20-23 to make some wonderful new memories.\n\nVideos of previous editions: 2019 | 2018 | 2017\n\nUkraine 2022: Letâs Teach Our Children Well...\n\n\"This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.\" (Leonard Bernstein)\n\nÐ¡Ð»ÑÑÐ¸Ð»Ð°ÑÑ ÑÑÑÐ°ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ ÑÑÐ°Ð³ÐµÐ´Ð¸Ñ, ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐ°Ñ Ð·Ð°ÑÑÐ¾Ð½ÑÐ»Ð° Ð²ÑÐµÑ Ð½Ð°Ñ.

It was impossible to imagine anything like this but the worst possible thing that could happen is taking place right now before our own eyes. And we all are unwilling participants of these tragic events. Due to these circumstances, we are cancelling all our upcoming concerts in Russia as well as our spring tour in Germany. We are working on technical issues related to tickets return and will soon make this announcement. We are sorry but under these circumstances we cannot pretend that nothing is happening and continue playing our cheerful music. Please refrain from hateful comments at least out of respect to the members of our group whose relatives are forced to hide from shells and explosions in the basements of their houses in Ukraine. We hope for prudence and reason of the once who can ensure peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\n24 Apr Today, the Orthodox Easter Sunday we share with you one of the most beloved and important songs for us. A year ago, at a gala concert dedicated to the 18th anniversary of Otava Yo, we performed it together with the Vasilisa Folklore Ensemble, and it is this recording that we bring to your attention today. Jesus is risen!\n\n23 Jun Dear friends! We are glad to announce that this Sunday, June 26th, Otava Yo will perform an online concert dedicated to the 19th anniversary of the band. An extended line-up is expected (Julia, Lina and all the others). The live stream starts at 7 pm Moscow time on our YouTube channel and also on our Facebook and VK page. Please do not miss! See you!\n\nWe are all emotionally broken by what is happening in Ukraine and Europe, and I am sure that many of you, in various ways, are doing your best to help stop the war, welcome refugees, etc. History has shown that music is a strong instrument of social cohesion, healing, and peace. Luca Bassanese released, in 2019, the video clip KEEP YOUR VOICE UP celebrating social volunteering in Europe. More recently, on February he has put online another clip RESET. In DEMOCRISISA, he was already denouncing months ago the growing gap between the social majorities of the world who see AUSTERITY for the social majorities of the world as the best option to increase their gains. Some critics find the narrative too simplistic. At least, it does not kill - especially KIDS.\n\nIâm also thinking of Ettore Castagna, one of the founders of the historical world music band from Calabria RE NILIU, who declared in a recent interview for his new album á¼ÏÎ·Î¼Î¯Î±/EremÃ¬a (AlfaMusic/EGEA, 2022): âI come from a generation of baby boomers who couldnât think of music other than a personal political commitment. On the other hand, \"the personal is politicalâ we used to say. I kept such imprinting. I also say clearly in one of my songs that social justice does not exist but I continue to expect it.â I come from the same generation. Social justice is of course something you build day after day, by taking responsibility and putting forward the work to be done. It suggests you talk with your neighbors first. Then, there is the Sicilian world music artist Antonio Smiriglia who is reminding us in his new opus âAmanti, Santi e Navigantiâ (Aventino Music-Opensoundmusic, 2022) that we are all sailors on the same sea. And we all know that the sea is not always calm.\n\nLetâs teach our children well!\n\nSincerely, Eric E. van Monckhoven (Music4You | Live Music With Roots)\n\nGiven the current events happening in Eastern Europe, Colin Devlin (of The Devlins) was recently reflecting on a cover song he'd recorded in December 2021, and how the message is as poignant today as when John Fogerty wrote it in 2004. \"DÃ©jÃ Vu (All Over Again)\" was originally recorded as part of a KZZ Music charity project, before the current conflict in Ukraine began. But upon listening to it last week, Devlin and KZZ Music/Blue Ãlan Records co-founder, Kirk Pasich, realized how much the message in the song is now more timely than ever with the state of our world today.\n\nAs Devlin emphasizes, âItâs a song about the senseless loss of life and how history repeats itself. For the last 70 years weâve been hearing ânever againâ but here we are, again.â\n\nThe single is available exclusively through Bandcamp. Please download the song at the link below and help the people of Ukraine during this tragic time. DOWNLOAD NOW!!\n\nColin Devlin & Blue Ãlan Records are devastated by the current events in Ukraine. In hopes that we may bring some relief to those most directly affected by this war, we are contributing all revenue from \"DÃ©jÃ Vu (All Over Again)\" to Save the Children, through Children's Emergency Fund. To learn more about the work Children's Emergency Fund is doing on the ground in Ukraine please read more here.\n\nBlue Ãlan Records"
