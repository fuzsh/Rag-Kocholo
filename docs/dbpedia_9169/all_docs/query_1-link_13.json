        "text": "This is a list of singer-songwriters who write, compose, and perform their own musical material. The list is divided into two sections to differentiate between artists categorized as singer-songwriters and others who do not fall under the definition associated with the genre:\n\nTraditional singer-songwriters\n\nOthers who both write songs and sing\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis list enumerates people who record and perform in the traditional singer-songwriter approach. These performers write their own material, accompany themselves on guitar or keyboards, usually perform solo or with limited and understated accompaniment, and are known as much for their songwriting skills as for their performance abilities.\n\nThis list includes both living and deceased singer-songwriters.\n\nKemal Monteno\n\nÁlvaro Torres\n\nKatie Melua\n\nVytautas Kernagis\n\nWalter Micallef\n\nDan Balan\n\nPavel Stratan\n\nFollowing are performers who are not singer-songwriters in the traditional sense, but who both write and perform songs in other genres. This includes artists known more prominently as members of bands and not primarily as soloists.\n\nDino Merlin\n\nTom Araya\n\nGeorge Lam\n\nBjork\n\nAlexandra Stan\n\nNatalie Gioia\n\nPablo Sciuto\n\nSơn Tùng M-TP\n\nBiography portal\n\nLists portal\n\nMusic portal"
