        "text": "Film Screening 'The Night Won't End' + Dinner Event + conversation with the producer Laila Al-Arian üóìÔ∏è Sunday 11 August ‚è∞ 6 PM üìç Gumbramorra Hall, 142 Addison Road, Marrickville üé´ (proceeds go to Gazan families) https://lnkd.in/gb8nsFfB \"The Night Won't End\" is an Al Jazeera documentary which takes an in-depth look at attacks on civilians by the Zionist military in Gaza. From air strikes to field executions, Fault Lines investigates the genocide in Gaza and the United States‚Äô role in the war. Fault Lines worked with journalists in Gaza to profile three Palestinian families as they try to survive the genocide, as they recount the horrific experiences they have endured under relentless assault. The film covers the story of Hind Rajab's family, the 6-year-old Palestinian girl who made headlines when it emerged in January that she had been trapped in a car with family members deliberately killed by the invading ground troops. Together with Airwars, Fault Lines also investigated an air strike on December 11 in north Gaza in which more than 100 people from the same family were killed. Fault Lines partnered with Forensic Architecture and Earshot to investigate that attack. The film screening will be followed by a conversation with the film producer and co-writer Laila Al-Arian and a member of We Are Not Numbers (WANN) group in Gaza. Tickets include dinner, film screening and a conversation with film executive producer and a member of WANN from Gaza. Funds raised by this event will cover the organising costs and to support refugee families for Gaza who arrived in Sydney. #Addiroad #marrickville #innerwestsyd #faultlines #aljazeera #lailaalarian #filmsydney #filmscreening\n\nOur community kitchen for Addi Road Food Pantry Camperdown is going off - hectic style and yum-focussed - as our staff and huge team of volunteers get ready for lunch time. Hundreds of free hot meals are going out to feed people coming to us from Mission Australia‚Äôs Common Ground housing complex, as well as the numerous visitors arriving on foot and by bus from surrounding suburbs. Today they will be treated to chicken stroganoff or meatballs and vegetables as well as some very tasty apple muffins for dessert. It‚Äôs all part of the food justice program Addi Road runs to counter inequality and the cost of living crisis, most especially for those dealing with everything from homelessness to unemployment to housing insecurity and all the hassles that come with being poor and trying to get by in Sydney today. Held on the last Friday of every month just outside our Addi Road Food Pantry Camperdown, we set up tables for people to dine in comfort. Thanks to funding from the City of Sydney we have been able to make the event more than just a regular thing, turning it into something special as well as useful. One of the volunteers comes in to say, ‚ÄúGuys we are getting great feedback. People are saying the food is delicious!‚Äù Another volunteer comes on soon after, ‚Äú‚ÄùWe‚Äôre getting calls for seconds.‚Äù Then yet another volunteer comes in the doors. ‚ÄúCan I get two meals for the ladies sitting at the bus stop?‚Äù Inside the Common Ground building an equally large crowd gathers in the main courtyard. Addi Road is there conducting a cooking lesson for the Mission Australia tenants who get the recipe and how-to details on how to make today‚Äôs meal for themselves. This includes a few shopping as well as cooking tips, and a free Addi Road Food Hamper boxed-up to make the week a little easier. Back inside the Addi Road Camperdown community kitchen the cooking madness continues at a high and happy pace. People come to the doors. Meals flow out in batches - vegetarian as well as meat-oriented, the call for desserts and those apple muffins now rising up too. Mel, who lives at Common Ground and sometimes volunteers herself for Addi Road, comes in to say thank you. She can see it‚Äôs a bit of a madhouse and has a laugh, calling out to everyone, ‚ÄúCrank it up!‚Äù Another Common Ground tenant pops his head in the door. Only one word from him. Repeated over and over: ‚ÄúBeautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.‚Äù #addiraod #camperdown #cityofsydney #letsgetcooking #missionaustralia #commonground #housing #homeless #inequality#costofliving #foodrelief #foodjustice #resilience #cookingtips #foodpantry #foodhampers #mentalhealth #nutrition #community #communitykitchen https://lnkd.in/gDrdtsci\n\nWhen we lose control of our lives, failing to feed ourselves and our families is where we can feel the most pain, the greatest lack of agency and loss of pride. As cost-of-living pressures escalate and everything from rental hikes to mortgage pressures ‚Äì as well as utilities, phone and shopping bills ‚Äì continue to rise and rise, we are being taken from one breaking point to the next. Holding your life together can get very hard. On bad days you don‚Äôt hold it together at all. The struggles around us make it that much tougher‚Ä¶ unable to help ourselves; unable to help one another. How much more can we take? This is the question that keeps coming up in conversations everywhere. Exasperated, angry, desperate in form. Economists and politicians, journalists and commentators‚Ä¶ they all have their explanations and, sometimes, a few answers. But it seems to change nothing. If anything, there is a feeling things are getting much, much worse. We are under no illusions about this situation at Addi Road. Yes, there will always be inequality, always be problems. But do things have to be quite so bad, so bitterly unequal and extreme as they are now?

Our event was highlighted as part of the Coles SecondBite Winter Appeal to showcase their work supporting community organisations like us who provide food relief with food donated by Coles and supplied by SecondBite. We're honoured to have been chosen by Coles and SecondBite again for our outstanding efforts in this area. And very pleased to continue working with them to advance food rescue and food relief programs at the corporate and community level. Addi Road currently feeds 8,500 people a week through our two food pantry operations in Marrickville and Camperdown and our various outreach programs. Over the last year we have also developed Wednesday Night Lights, an event where we provide hot meals (and desserts) for the homeless and those battling cost-of-living pressures ‚Äì along with a free range of wraparound services thanks to our other wonderful partnerships. At Addi Road's Wednesday Night Lights food is the gravity point, the warm heart around which people gather and feel less alone as we assist them with everything from medical checkups, legal advice, laundry services, haircuts, clothing, children's toys and more... all of it provided for free by our wonderful partners. The intent is to offer good food and a more human and restorative experience centred on sit-down meals prepared by our team of volunteer chefs and fine home cooks with a magic touch. The night itself conducted in a shared and positive spirit, as the footage from Channel 7 Sunrise shows. Sunrise spoke to Addi Road Chair Kween G and our good friends Grace Rabuatoka and John Gauci ‚Äì as well doing a fine job filming the event and the preparation that goes into it! Thanks again to Coles and SecondBite for supporting us and Wednesday Night Lights. Thanks, too, to Channel 7 Sunrise for taking our work to the rest of Australia. ~ ADDI ROAD's Wednesday Night Lights happens at 6pm - 8pm every week at the Addi Road Community Centre in Sydney's Marrickville. * You can SUPPORT the 'Coles in the Community SecondBite Winter Appeal' by picking up a $2 donation card at the Coles checkout or Coles online by searching 'SecondBite'. * You can DONATE directly to Addi Road‚Äôs food justice programs and community work via the link here:https://lnkd.in/gTuAvYYh #addiroad #channel7 #secondbite #coles #foodrelief #foodjustice #homeless https://lnkd.in/gGMVnFDV"
