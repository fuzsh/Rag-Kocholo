It consists of 19 episodes. The series celebrates its 300th episode but due to the writers' strike this season runs three episodes shorter than normal. As a result, certain storylines were altered, including Gates' relationship with hospital chaplain Julia Dupree. With Kovač in Croatia, the focus shifts to Abby as she adapts to life as a single parent. Meanwhile, new ER chief Kevin Morretti continues to make his presence felt until he makes a swift exit, Pratt is angered when locum Dr. Wexler is appointed as Morretti's replacement, Sam and Gates start a relationship and Jeanie Boulet makes a return to the ER when her son is brought in.
