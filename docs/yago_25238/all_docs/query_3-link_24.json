        "text": "Parminder Nagra shot to fame two decades ago after starring in the lead role in Bend It Like Beckham.\n\nThe actress, who was 26 at the time, played football loving Jess Bhamra, the teen girl who stood up to her conservative parents who forbade her to play the beautiful game.\n\nTearing up the rulebook, the low budget film made a staggering £60 million at the box office and is the highest-grossing sports film focusing on football.\n\n\"It stuns me how the film is doing and how people respond to it,\" Nagra said after its release. \"In London there was an article about all these girls bending it like Beckham, and in India there's this big wave of girls playing football. Wow! I can't believe a movie's done this!\"\n\nParminder had felt indifferently towards football when she auditioned and went through an intensive 10-week coaching course to get her skills up to scratch.\n\nThe cast went through rigiorous nine hour-a-day training sessions and the actress learned how to curve the ball in the air to replicate David Beckham's free kick ability.\n\nGet the news you want straight to your inbox. Sign up for a Mirror newsletter here .\n\nShe became the first woman to win the FIFA Presidential Award, got to meet the former England captain, then landed herself the role of Neela Rasgotra in long-running US medical drama ER.\n\nHit show ER, which turned the likes of George Clooney and Julianna Margulies into big names, would be where she remained until the series ended in 2009.\n\nSpeaking of her career and meeting Becks and wife Victoria, Parminder said: \"He loved the film and she said: ‘You were all so funny in it.’ So I went from that to being asked a year later — by George Clooney — if I wanted to play a doctor in ER.\n\n\"It was a no-brainer. A little Asian girl from Leicester should never have ended up in Hollywood.\n\n\"I lived in the Hollywood Hills and went to work every day at Warner Bros Studios and would see massive A-list stars. And my mum could say I made it as a doctor!\"\n\nAlthough Parminder insisted Hollywood had not changed her, as the first thing she did when she arrived was buy chapati flour and lentils.\n\nOnce ER was over in 2009, the actress starred in Fox sci-fi series Alcatraz before playing a CIA agent in the first season of the NBC crime drama series The Blacklist and appearing in Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D..\n\nMost recently, she has appeared in Sky Atlantic thriller Fortitude and as the school counsellor in Netflix series 13 Reasons Why.\n\nAway fro her acting career, Parminder married photographer James Stenson in January 2009 - with friend and former ER co-star Maura Tierney officiating the wedding.\n\nIn May that year she gave birth to their son, Kai David Singh Stenson, but her marriage ended in a bitter divorce which was finalised in July 2013.\n\nStill living in the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood of Laurel Canyon with her son, Parminder has described LA as really \"not that shiny\".\n\n\"I’m doing the same thing I’d be doing if I was in England,\" said the actress, who does make the most of the LA outdoors lifestyle and keeps in shape by hiking.\n\nShe has good support network of friends, including include fellow Brit actors, Spooks star Lara Pulver and her husband Raza Jaffrey.\n\nIn 2018 she was cast as a doctor in the Netflix film Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock, which required her to play the character with an Indian accent.\n\n\"I wasn’t thrilled about playing the doctor again,\" Parminder said. \"But it’s an amazing piece of work with an amazing director, and it’s Sandra Bullock. I’d rather not have done the accent. It’s hard.\n\n\"There are times when doctor roles come up, and you want to say no, but you want to work.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror last monht, Parminder recalled an incident where her agent suggested her for a role and the response was \"they’ve already got an Indian person on the cast\".\n\nParminder added: \"I went, ‘Yeah, but I’m completely different to that person. Is that ever gonna happen when you say that, ‘No, we’ve already got a white person on the show’?\"\n\nShe also touched on the fact that she wasn't featured beside Bend It Like Beckham co-star Keira Knightly on the front cover of a magazine during promotion for the film, as bosses refused to put her on its cover because of the colour of her skin.\n\nShe said: \"I've been in rooms where people have gone, 'Oh that's not going to sell because there's just too many brown people in it', and you go, 'Oh. OK'.\"\n\n\"Do you keep pounding? There's moments where you get tired and then there's people that do keep doing that and then they break another glass ceiling.\n\n\"You've got Riz Ahmed and Priyanka Chopra - they've got deals with networks and stuff like that, and so things have moved on.\n\n\"But, yeah, that was a story for the books and there was lots of little stories like that.\"\n\nNow Parminder has been cast as the lead in new ITV drama DI Ray, a four-part series airing Monday to Thursday this week.\n\nProduced by Jed Mercurio, the series sees police officer Rachita Ray taking on a case that forces herto confront a lifelong personal conflict between her British identity and her South Asian heritage.\n\nAfter finally getting her promotion, Rachita’s heart sinks whenshe suspects she is a 'token appointment', chosen for her ethnicity rather than her ability, then realises she has been burying a personal identity crisis her whole life.\n\nDesrcibing her character, Parminder says: \"Rachita is a really good, meaty character and to me it’s all about finding this woman's place in the world.\n\n\"You don’t often havean Asian female lead on TV – it's starting to happen more, but having been in the business for so long, I feel like I've been saying the same thing for a long time.\n\n\"I can see the change with the likes of Bridgerton, but in DI Ray this is my generation of women, we’re in Birmingham and it’s so relatable – it's nice to play.\n\n\"That was the main appeal for me that I’m not playing the best friend of somebody or a secondary character, it’s all about Rachita.\n\n\"One day I’d love to play a character who isn't thinking about her identity – Bend It Like Beckham was about her identity too. But those parts are really hard to come by or don't get made very often.\n\n\"DI Ray is just so well-written, Rachita’s interactions with people are really great and I loved playing a strong 40-something woman on the show, helmed by these people and telling this story.\"\n\n* DI Ray airs Monday to Thursday this week on ITV at 9pm"
