When it comes to reading I love mystery's and crime books, my favorite is Dead Wrong by: J. A. Jance, my favorite book of all time is Anne of Green Gables. When it comes to web design and graphics I started my 1st website in High School, it was about the US soap opera Guiding Light, since then I have made several webs mostly about TV shows, but for 3 summers in a row I had graphics request sites but since I started work I have not made as many as I used to, I once had 15 websites going at the same time now I just have this one and the my space and journals. I have made over 100 music videos mostly about Gilmore Girls, ER, Veronica Mars, and Ghost Whisperer. Well I guess that's about all you need to know about me.
