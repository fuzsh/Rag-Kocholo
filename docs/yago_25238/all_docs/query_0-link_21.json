        "text": "When \"ER\" first hit the small screen in 1994, who would've guessed it would become a pop culture phenomenon?\n\nWhen it premiered, after all, not many gave it a chance.\n\nIt wasn't at all like \"Dallas\" or \"Dynasty,\" the primetime soaps the dominated the 1980s.\n\nNor was it like any of its medical show predecessors such as \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Emergency\" and \"Medical Center.\"\n\nThis drama, created by late best-selling author Michael Crichton, seemed more real - right down to the doctors spewing medical jibberish. We didn't know what the heck they were saying, but we sure were engrossed by it.\n\nTonight, we bid \"ER\" adieu. The 331st and final episode begins at 8 p.m. on NBC (Time Warner channels 6 and 106), preceded by a one-hour retrospective at 7. The final season has been a farewell tour of sorts, with past stars - George Clooney, Eriq La Salle, Julianna Margulies, Anthony Edwards, etc. - making appearances.\n\nThe drama no longer dominates the Nielsen ratings the way it did in the 1990s, but it continued to hold its own despite all the cast changes and bizarre happenings.\n\nBecause for every Dr. Romano (Paul McCrane), who had not one but two tragic (and preposterous) encounters with helicopters, there was a Jules \"Ruby\" Rubadoux (Red Buttons), an elderly man who would do anything to help his dying wife, including entering her in what turned out to be a questionable study and losing her.\n\nIt was stories like Ruby's - ones we can relate to - that kept us coming back for more.\n\nI've been on board since the beginning, but I admit, it's time for it to go. Even though the drama is still better than half the stuff on TV, it has run its course. I'll be sad to see it depart but happy it had such a long and entertaining run.\n\nHere are five of my favorite \"ER\" episodes, plus a couple of honorable mentions:\n\n1. \"Be Still My Heart,\" Feb. 10, 2000 (Season 6, Episode 126). The scariest and most shocking of the 331 episodes. Before becoming a math professor turned crime solver in \"Numb3rs,\" David Krumholtz plays a mentally ill patient who stabs med student Lucy (Kellie Martin) and Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle). Lucy dies. Carter survives but becomes addicted to pain meds and later needs a kidney because of the crime.\n\n2. \"On the Beach,\" May 9, 2002 (Season 8, Episode 178). For weeks we knew Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) would die from an inoperable brain tumor. Still, the tears flowed when it finally happened on a beach in Hawaii, with him (and us) listening to Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's rendition of \"Over The Rainbow.\"\n\n3. \"Hell and High Water,\" Nov. 9, 1995, (Season 2, Episode 35). My favorite Clooney episode features his Dr. Ross saving a drowning kid in a storm drain. A news helicopter catches his heroics, prompting the hospital to keep him on despite his resistance to authority.\n\n4. \"I Don't,\" May 3, 2007 (Season 13, episode 288). Abby (Maura Tierney) and Luka (Goran Visnjic) finally tie the knot, but the episode ends tragically when a drunk Ray (Shane West) is hit by a truck while answering a call from Neela (Parminder Nagra).\n\n5. \"Time of Death,\" Nov. 11, 2004 (Season 11, Episode 229). \"ER\" became known for its guest stars. In this one, Ray Liotta (\"Goodfellas\") wins an Emmy for best performance in a drama as a dying alcoholic who tries to make amends with his son.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n\"Alone in the Crowd,\" Feb. 17, 2005 (Season 11, Episode 238). This was a good season for guest stars. Three months after Liotta's Emmy-winning turn, \"Sex and The City's\" Cynthia Nixon pops up as a soccer mom who suffers a stroke and is unable to speak, yet we can hear what she wants to say.\n\n\"Ambush,\" Sept. 25, 1997 (Season 4, Episode 70). Dr. Morgenstern (William Macy) suffers a heart attack, British surgeon Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) joins the staff and a documentary crew follows around Dr. Greene. Why is this episode special? It was done live.\n\nReach Jeff Korbelik at 473-7213 or jkorbelik@journalstar.com.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
