        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Neela\n\nNeela is a charming name with varied origins and meanings. Some sources suggest Neela is a Finnish variant of Nela, a shortened form of names ending in nela. Alternatively, Neela is believed to be the East and West Frisian variation of Neele, which likely stems from the Roman family name Cornelius, possibly originating from the Latin element cornu, meaning ‘horn.’\n\nIn Sanskrit, Neela is an alternate form of Nila, which means ‘sapphire blue’ or ‘dark blue.’ Primarily given to baby girls, the name holds a profound cultural significance within Indian communities and is intertwined with Hindy mythology.\n\nIn Indian culture, the color blue has multifaceted symbolism. It represents life and power as it is associated with water while embodying infinity through its connections to the sky and seas. Additionally, the deity Krishna, revered in Hinduism, is often depicted with blue skin, symbolizing infinite reality. Hindus also wear blue attire to ward off evil.\n\nNeela, also known as Neelima or Neelamratna in Hindu mythology, is the chief wife of Shani and the mother of Kuligna. She balances and amplifies Shani’s power and is revered as the goddess of the Blue Sapphire gemstone.\n\nNeela is typically pronounced ‘NEE-lah,’ emphasizing the first syllable. The name’s popularity has led to the emergence of variants such as Neelam, Neelima, Nila, Nilam, and Nilima, Neila, and Nyla. A few nicknames that complement Neela’s essence are NeNe, Neel, Nel, and Neelu.\n\nWhile not many fictional characters share the name, notable examples include Dr. Neela Rasgotra from the television series ER, a character named Neela in two episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Neela Sen from Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni’s novel Neela: Victory Song is another individual bearing this name.\n\nOverall, Neela is a graceful name with multicultural roots. Its association with blue color evokes notions of vast sky and deep oceans that bring calmness and tranquility. Blue color’s association with evocative qualities, including dependability and enlightenment, amplifies its charm and appeal.
