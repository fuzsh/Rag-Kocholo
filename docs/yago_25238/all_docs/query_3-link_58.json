        "text": "● Lara Pulver [Parminder's co-star in Maternal] and I are best mates and neighbours in LA.\n\nDuring the pandemic we did a lot of our audition self-tapes together. So when she taped her audition to play Catherine, I read the opposite parts - both Helen and Maryam. And during her call back, I was there off-camera reading in the other roles and the director said \"Can I give Parminder a note?\" It made me laugh but also think, How dare you? I'm not even up for this project! The following day, I got an email asking me to audition as Maryam.\n\n● I did my audition tape with Lara's husband, Raza Jaffrey, who is also my very good friend and who had been cast to play Jack, a surgeon and a former boyfriend of Catherine.\n\nSo we took our whole kit and caboodle to Liverpool like a little family."
