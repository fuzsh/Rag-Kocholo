        "text": "The couple will welcome the new addition in summer 2009 and have made plans to marry, reports Us Weekly online.\n\nThe 33-year-old actress says, \"We are thrilled and overjoyed at the prospect of becoming first time parents.\n\n\"Yes, our plans are to get married but there's no confirmed date yet. We have been together for nearly seven years.\n\n\"The plan is to stay in Los Angeles. We still have a home in London, so eventually the plan is to be bi-coastal, but who knows what the future holds. We are just taking it one day at a time.\"\n\nNagra is currently shooting the last ever season of the hit TV drama ER - in which she plays Dr. Neela Rasgotra.\n\nBut she insists there are no plans to tie in her pregnancy with her character's personal life, adding, \"There are no plans to write the pregnancy in the show. I feel like I will want to work, but who knows what I'll feel like when the baby arrives.\"\n\nThe last episode of the series is scheduled to air in February (09)."
