I saw your favorite episodes gifset\n\nhey, @amidalas-shadow!\n\nfun question! i am a sucker for er dialogue, so i have many, many favorite lines.\n\ni put a bunch of ‘em under the “read more.”\n\n_____\n\ninspirational lines\n\n“you set the tone.”\n\n—david morgenstern, mark greene, and john carter (at various points throughout the series)\n\njc: “i thought i was gonna be sick. i’m sorry.”\n\nmg: “don’t ever say you’re sorry. see, there’s two kinds of doctors: there’s the kind that gets rid of their feelings, and the kind that keeps them. if you’re gonna keep your feelings, you’re gonna get sick from time to time. that’s just how it works… people come in here, and they’re sick and dying and bleeding, and they need our help. helping them is more important than how we feel.”\n\njc: (nods)\n\nmg: “—but it’s still a pain the ass sometimes.”\n\n—john carter and mark greene, episode 01x01 “24 hours”\n\nch: “i just wanna be happy—and i’m so afraid i never will be.”\n\ndr: “you will. you will.”\n\n—carol hathaway and doug ross, episode 01x25 “everything old is new again”\n\njc: “it’s not that i dislike surgery. it’s been incredibly challenging. the training has been excellent. you are a wonderful surgeon and a fine teacher.”\n\nda: “get to the point, doctor.”\n\njc: “i admire surgeons and surgery, but it’s not the type of medicine i want to practice. i can be a competent surgeon; i can learn the techniques, the mechanics. but i’ll never be a great surgeon. dr. anspaugh, i can be a great doctor—a doctor who spends time with his patients, who’s there for them. i’m good at it. really good. i can make a difference in people’s lives. don’t make me give that up. please don’t make me waste it.”\n\n—john carter and donald anspaugh, episode 03x22 “one more for the road”\n\nlk: “i thought we were saving her.”\n\njc: “no. we were giving her her only chance.”\n\nlk: “that’s not good enough.”\n\njc: “it has to be.”\n\nlk: “no, it doesn’t.”\n\njc: “some patients get to you more than others, i know. but when you do everything that you can—sometimes even more than you thought you could—you gotta walk away knowing you fought the good fight. you fought the good fight, lucy. tomorrow you’ll fight another one.”\n\n—lucy knight and john carter, episode 05x08 “the good fight”\n\nch: “i have to go find out.”\n\nlk: “find out what?”\n\nch: “if [doug’s] still in love with me—because i’m still in love with him. i am. i’ve been in love with him since i was twenty-three years old. he’s everything to me. he’s my life. i feel complete when i’m with him, and i feel empty when we’re apart. he’s the father of my children, and he’s my soulmate.”\n\n—carol hathaway and luka kovac, episode 06x21 “such sweet sorrow”\n\n“forget superman; i’ll take mark greene.”\n\n—abby lockhart, episode 08x20 “the letter”\n\n“be generous—with your time, with your love, with your life… be generous, always.”\n\n—mark greene, episode 08x21 “on the beach”\n\ngp: “what’s up, frank?”\n\nfm: “you know, i always believed that nothing ever really changed. i’m old enough that i know that there’s always gonna be trouble—war, taxes; bad guys now are pretty much the same as bad guys have always been. but that’s not how i feel today. i feel like the world’s getting worse and worse and worse, and what we’re watching is the slow, steady descent of the human race.”\n\ngp: “no. no, i don’t buy that. i think that, um, today was just a rough day for the home team.”\n\n—greg pratt and frank martin, episode 13x01 “bloodline”\n\n“you know, nine years ago, i had—my marriage was over, my mother was in a mental institution for the seventh or tenth time—i don’t know—and i drank a lot. a lot. and i had reached this—you know what? i—one morning, i woke up in this apartment, and i had no idea how i got there, next to some guy i didn’t even remember meeting, and he was going through my stuff, looking for money so he and his buddy could get a fix. so i ran out of there, and i went downstairs, and i tried to get a cab, but i had no idea where i was, and it was five o’clock in the morning, and there were no cars on the street, so i just—i just sat down on a stoop, and i just—i waited for something to happen. and at that moment, i’m telling you, i knew—i mean, i was positive!—that happiness was something i was never going to find. i’m just trying to tell you that things can change. they can get better. even if you don’t see it, they can.”\n\n—abby lockhart, episode 13x14 “murmurs of the heart”\n\nsad lines\n\n“a man came in today. he sat there and watched his wife die, and he helped her to die, because she was in so much pain, and he loved her. but we didn’t have that kind of marriage, did we, al? we didn’t love, we didn’t cherish, we didn’t respect, and now you’ve killed me!”\n\n—jeanie boulet, episode 03x05 “ghosts”\n\n“doug? i don’t want to wake up alone tomorrow.”\n\n—carol hathaway, episode 05x15 “the storm,” pt. ii\n\n“he’s still my baby, peter. i’m supposed to take care of him. i feel like somewhere, sometime, he’s going to be sad or cold or scared. who’s taking care of him? who’s being his mother?”\n\n—jackie robbins, episode 08x01 “four corners”\n\nec: “your brother believed me when i told him he’d get better—it didn’t matter where he was, how he felt, what the doctor said. i told him he’d get better. he died believing me.”\n\njc: “no, he was pretending for you—that was another one of our secrets. i was supposed to not let you be sad. i was supposed to make you forget. to make you happy. he made me promise to make you happy. i’m sorry, mom.”\n\n—eleanor carter and john carter, episode 08x14 “a simple twist of fate”\n\n“kem? they’re gonna come down and take us to our new room soon, and when they come, they’re gonna take the baby, and we’re never gonna see him again. i don’t know what the right thing is to say. i don’t know what the right thing to do is. it was an accident! it was nothing that you did wrong. it was nothing that we did wrong. it just happened. i love you, and i wanna spend the rest of my life with you, but we have to say goodbye to our son now. i have to help you to do that, and i don’t know how to do that. please help me. please.”\n\n—john carter, episode 10x21 “midnight”\n\nfunny lines\n\nmp: “are you married?”\n\nsl: “no, i’m a doctor.”\n\n—male patient and susan lewis, episode 01x01 “24 hours”\n\n“what can i say about mark greene that hasn’t already been said? i think everybody knows how he overcame adversity as a child of quakers, his years in exile, his political writings and limericks, his mod period with the turtlenecks, his blue period, and of course his ruthless march to power and the silencing of his rivals.”\n\n—doug ross, episode 02x03 “do one, teach one, kill one”\n\n“you are wedges. the wedge is the most primitive tool known to man. that is you. you think you know what you’re doing. believe me: you don’t. breakfast with your senior surgical resident, dr. benton, will begin in fifteen minutes. dr. benton is an intern’s worst nightmare. he’s smarter than you, he never eats, he never sleeps, and he reads every medical journal, no matter how obscure. he is the antichrist, beelzebub, lucifer—a devourer of wedges! you will go to sleep at night wishing plague and pestilence on his unborn children, and you will wake up every morning praying for his approval. you won’t get it. welcome to hell, ladies and gentlemen.”\n\n—dr. melvoin, episode 03x01 “dr. carter, i presume”\n\nsidebar: if any of my followers from the csi fandom are reading this, dr. melvoin is played by wallace langham, aka david hodges, so imagine the above spectacular rant being delivered in his voice. also, bonus points ‘cause he’s talking about “wedges.”\n\nsl: “first of all, i order a manhattan, straight up, two cherries. he orders a ‘fruity yet selfless’ glass of carbernet.”\n\nmg: “what does that even mean?”\n\nsl: “i have no idea! then he talks for forty-five minutes about his ex-girlfriend, whose name also happens to be susan: how much he loved her, how much he wanted to marry her, how he wanted to father her five or six children—and, by the way, do i want children? do i want five or six children?”\n\nmg: “okay, tad could be worse.”\n\nsl: “i’m not even there yet, mark. i look over, and he has this drop of red wine hanging from his nose.”\n\nmg: “what?”\n\nsl: “you heard me! this puny, little blob, just hanging there. so of course, i cannot take my eyes off of it! is it gonna fall? is it gonna hang there all night? is his skin going to absorb it?”\n\nmg: “how did it get there?”\n\nsl: “mark!”\n\nmg: “no, really! how did you get your nose that far down into a wineglass? what, was he smelling it, or—?”\n\nsl: “mark, please!”\n\nmg: “okay, what happened?”\n\nsl: “i went to the bathroom and snuck out the window.”\n\nmg: “you’re kidding.”\n\nsl: “nope.”\n\nmg: “wow.”\n\n—susan lewis and mark greene, episode 03x02 “let the games begin”\n\nkw: “did you even take the hippocratic oath?!”\n\nrr: “i had my fingers crossed.”\n\n—kerry weaver and robert romano, episode 07x03 “mars attacks”\n\nsw: “don’t touch me!”\n\nnr: “try not to move. i’m a doctor. you may have broken your ankle.”\n\nsw: “if you’re a doctor, i want a second opinion.”\n\nnr: (to abby) “okay, dr. lockhart, would you care to give a second opinion?”\n\nal: (to snotty woman) “sure. your ankle may be broken—and you’re a bitch.”\n\n—snotty woman on l platform, neela rasgotra, and abby lockhart, episode 12x02 “nobody’s baby”\n\n_____\n\nthere are probably tons of others, too.\n\nif you ever want any of these moments—or any others from the show—giffed, lemme know, okay?\n\nthanks for the question!\n\nPosted 4 years ago with 7 notes"
