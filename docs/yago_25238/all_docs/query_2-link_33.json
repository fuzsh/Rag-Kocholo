        "meta_description": "The fifteenth and final season of the American fictional drama television series ER premiered on September 25, 2008, and concluded on April 2, 2009, in a two-hour episode preceded by a one-hour retrospective special. It consists of 22 episodes. Because actors Mekhi Phifer, Goran Visnjic, and Maura Tierney had been told the 14th season would be the last one, they had no plans or interest in returning for S15. The producers agreed to film two S15 episodes at the very end of the Season 14 production cycle so that all three actors could finish their time on the show and move on to other projects. Tierney would make a one-scene guest appearance in an episode near the end of Season 15.",
