        "text": "The Booths were becoming very popular in the 1940s so I will limit the information to a few years at a time from here on.\n\n9 January 1940 – BBC Broadcast. 8.30: The Sleeping Beauty, an excerpt from the pantomime – presented by Prince Littler, with Leonard Henry, Syd Walker, Anne Ziegler: orchestra directed by Ray Theobald, from Golders Green Hippodrome.\n\n21 January 1940. A star-studded Sunday concert at the London Palladium.\n\n4 February 1940 – Regal Cinema, Chester.\n\n17 February 1940 – Stars for Bath Festival. Two famous radio stars, one of whom is equally well known to film patrons – Anne Ziegler and Webster Booth – have been engaged to appear at the forthcoming festival of the Bath Co-operative Society.\n\n19 February 1940 – Yorkshire Post – Choral Society Concert. Audience of 1,000 at Horsforth. Places of worship in Horsforth held evening services earlier, yesterday, so that townspeople could attend the concert by the Horsforth New Choral Society in the Glenroyal Cinema.\n\nUpwards of 1,000 attended. It seems that Horsforth New Choral Society, consisting of no more than 60 strong, is more enterprising than the large choral societies in Leeds. With limited resources it engages the leading principals of the day – last night they were Miss Edythe Reeve, Miss Edith Coates, Mr Francis Russell (deputising for Mr Webster Booth at short notice) and Mr Arnold Matters – and during recent years the standard of choral singing has been far above the average.\n\n14 March 1940 – Music Hall Debut. Anne and Webster made their debut in Variety at Manchester Palace (MD Jesse Hewitt; M William Taylor; PM D Bush; MusD S Rogers) A short season of twice-nightly variety opens with a pleasant programme. Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler render romantic numbers to the general delight, and are accompanied at the piano by Haward Clarke. The Western Brothers entertain with their amusing topical skits, the outstanding one being on radio propaganda. Billy Russell keeps the fun going with his patter on behalf of the working classes. George Clarke is as cheery as ever in The New Car. Will Hay, Junior, presents The Fourth Form at St Michael’s and Arthur Prince is still one of our most popular ventriloquists. Red Fred, the Five Kenways, Iris Sadler, and the Florence Whiteley Girls complete the programme.\n\n18 April 1940 – The Variety Stage, Lewisham Hippodrome.\n\nAn interesting engagement in the current variety bill is that of Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler, whose artistic singing of ballads and excerpts from musical comedies is warmly welcomed. They score singly and in duets, especially in A Paradise for Two and Deep in my Heart.\n\n20 April 1940 9.20 Variety, from the Lewisham Hippodrome: Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler, Al and Bob Harvey, Will Hay, Junion and Company, Issy Bonn, Billy Bissett’s Canadians.\n\n4 May 1940 – Burnley Express\n\nA grand variety gala performance at the London Palladium will be on the air for nearly two hours, with only a 20 minute interval (Forces programme) tomorrow. Among those who will be heard will be Gracie Fields, Jack Warner, Arthur Askey, Vic Oliver, Bebe Daniels, Ben Lyon, Florence Desmond, Frances Day, Max Miller, Flanagan and Allen, Teddy Brown, Webster Booth, Anne Ziegler and Rawicz and Landauer.\n\nJune to October 1940 – On With the Show (Lawrence Wright) North Pier, Blackpool. Anne and Webster appeared in variety and sang Lilac of Louvain by Bruce Sievier and Horatio Nicholls. The words were inspired by an incident where Belgium girls handed sprays of flowers to British soldiers as they marched through the country.\n\nDuring their stay in Blackpool they rented a “big Georgian house at Singleton, seven miles from Blackpool”, with twenty-seven acres of ground.\n\n8 November 1940 – Western Daily Press.\n\nBBC THEATRE ORCHESTRA’S VISIT TO BATH\n\nResidents in Bath will have an opportunity of hearing a Sunday concert by the BBC Theatre Orchestra, with some favourite soloists on Sunday, November 17. Olga Haley and Webster Booth will sing solos and duets, and there will be items by the BBC Theatre Chorus and Jack Mackintosh solo cornet. The conductor will be Stanford Robinson.\n\nThe concert, which begins in the Pavilion at 6 pm is priced at 5s and 3s 6d for the reserved numbered seats, and 3s 6d for the reserved numbered seats, and 3s 6d for the unnumbered reserved seats. A limited number of unreserved tickets can be had in advance, price 1s 3d, from the Pump Room office telephone number 4227. Members of the Forces in uniform will be admitted for half price at the doors.\n\nThe vocal items will include the favourite song from Hiawatha, Onaway, awake Beloved; the aria from Samson and Delilah, Softly Awakes my Heart, and the duet from Act II, Carmen including the Flower Song.\n\n24th November 1940.\n\n22 December 1940 – Messiah Hallé Concert Society, Manchester, Webster Booth (tenor), conducted by Malcolm Sargent.\n\nLater that night there was a big bombing raid on Manchester which destroyed the Free Trade Hall. The hall had not been used for the Messiah performance because the large glass windows could not be blacked out properly, and it was feared that in the event of an air raid the members of the audience would be badly injured by flying glass.\n\n17 April 1941 – Empire, Glasgow. A strong bill is offered here. Vic Oliver’s droll humour is always appreciated; Douglas Byng gives clever impersonations, and Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler offer delightful singing. Others are Wheeler and Wilson, Erikson, Worthy and Jarrett, Two Valors, and the Marion Palo Trio.\n\nWebster and Anne were proud that although English comedians died the death in Glasgow, Glasgow audiences “loved us”! This reminds me of the book I am reading at the moment – Lost Empires by J.B. Priestley.\n\nRichard Herncastle’s account of his life on the music hall, alongside his Uncle Nick, in the period immediately before the outbreak of the first World War in 1914.\n\nThis account of life in the Empire Theatres of English Variety.\n\n10 May 1941 – Wikipedia. On the afternoon of 10 May 1941, there was a performance of Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius at Queen’s Hall (Muriel Brunskill singing the angel, Webster Booth the soul, Ronald Stear the Priest and angel of Agony) conducted by Malcolm Sargent, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Choral Society. That night there was a massive air raid in which the chamber of the House of Commons and many other buildings were also destroyed, and damage was inflicted on the British Museum and upon Westminster Abbey. A single incendiary bomb hit the Queen’s Hall, and the auditorium was completely gutted by fire beyond any hope of replacement. The building was a smouldering ruin in heaps of rubble and all that remained intact was the bronze bust of Sir Henry Wood in its alcove, looking out over the chaos. It is not known what became of the portrait bust of Gervase Elwes. In addition, the London Philharmonic Orchestra lost thousands of pounds’ worth of instruments.\n\n26 June 1941\n\n24 December 1941 – Gangway at the Palladium. On Wednesday afternoon, December 17th 1941, George Black produced here his “musical smile” in seventeen scenes, entitled Gangway. It belongs to the category of produced variety – established variety turns interspersed with spectacular scenes and comic episodes – that Mr Black has made very largely his own special province and with which he has found so much success on other occasions. Gangway (with Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, Tommy Trinder, Teddy Brown, and Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler heading a strong company) promises to enjoy a long and prosperous run at the Palladium, and it will fully deserve its success, for its constituent parts are of admirable quality and good fun is its keynote…\n\nThere is some fine vocal work to be enjoyed from Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler (who have Charles Forwood at the piano in their own scene), and it almost goes without saying that the xylophone playing by Teddy Brown has all its usual high appeal. Mr Brown’s lesson to the audience in hand bell and xylophone playing is also an enjoyable event…In addition to scenes already mentioned, others which have been staged in a highly effective way (especially when one considers the difficulties of the times) are the striking Gangway opening number with its use of revolving stage; the colourful Shangri-La Eastern episode with Webster Booth, Anne Ziegler, and ensemble; the finale to the first half in which old and familiar numbers are given new treatments, both vocal and scenic, A Place in the Sun (with Rona Ricardo, Rosita and Lamar, and ensemble), for which Arthur Bliss’ Shape of Things to Come march is used; and the All in White finale. Robert Nesbitt has produced Gangway and George Black has supervised the presentation. Debroy Somers is in charge of the orchestra and the musical side of things.\n\nDecember 1941 – Times. London Palladium: Gangway supervised by Mr George Black. “This show is distinctly not what you call West End,” declared Mr. Tommy Trinder at the outset. “It is provincial, don’t you know, and you, are going to like it.” The quip, rounding off a run of engagingly impudent sallies at the expense of latecomers, betokened confidence and promised well. It seems in retrospect to have been a little rash. There is nothing to dislike in the show; yet it certainly falls below the level of entertainment we expect from Mr. George Black. It depends a good deal upon spectacle, and its chief weaknesses are here. It would be unreasonable to expect beauty in shows of this order, but so little meaning has Shangri-La or A Place in the Sun that it quite fails to be either gay or even cheerful. It is merely a parade of women in odd costumes and dances that signify nothing.\n\nMr. Trinder succeeds in being immensely cheerful, and his ready impudence has the good humour which may not endear the bounder of the seaside promenade but prevents us from disliking him. Mr. Ben Lyon and he make good fun of Chinese theatrical conventions, which, queer as they are in their child-like reliance on the imaginative, are not, after all, barbarous, like the convention of our own music-hall stage, which insists that the voice of Miss Bebe Daniels singing a softly sentimental song shall be turned by a microphone into a voice of brass. Mr. Teddy Brown plays the xylophone with a delightful air of absent-mindedness, and Mr. Webster Booth sings almost as Mr. Harry Welchman used to sing.\n\n28 December 1941 – CONCERT FOR KING GEORGE’S FUND FOR SAILORS\n\nA choir of naval ratings will sing sea shanties at the Albert Hall on Sunday, December 28, as part of a concert in aid of King George’s Fund for Sailors (for dependents of officers and men in the Royal Navy, Merchant Navy, and fishing fleets).\n\nThere will be the massed bands of the Royal Marines, 110 strong, under the direction of Major J. Ricketts, Geraldo’s concert orchestra, and Mr Reginald Foort at the organ. Miss Evelyn Laye will sing a song for sailors composed for the occasion by Mr Vivian Ellis, who is a lieutenant in the RNVR, and will himself appear. Miss Eileen Joyce will play the Grieg Concerto, and Mr Webster Booth, Miss Anne Ziegler, and Miss Vera Lynn will sing. Rawicz and Landauer will play two pianos, Mr John Gielgud will recite a poem specially written by Mr John Masefield, and the comedy side of the afternoon will be in the hands of Mr George Formby. Mr Ivor Newton is the accompanist.\n\nWebster Booth married his second wife, Dorothy Annie Alice Prior (stage name Paddy Prior) on 10 October 1932 at the Fulham Registry Office. He had married Winifred Keey there eight years earlier but had divorced her in 1931 after she deserted him and their small son, Keith, several years before.\n\nMarriage certificate of Hubert Edward Prior and Annie Jane Henderson, Paddy’s parents on 25 October 1902.\n\nPaddy Prior, was born in December 1904, the daughter of Fulham ironmonger, Hubert and his wife, Annie Henderson. Paddy began her professional stage career while still a teenager. She was a talented soubrette, comedienne and dancer, and possessed a pleasant mezzo soprano voice into the bargain.\n\nPaddy’s parents lived at Disbrowe Road when they were first married.\n\nPaddy’s birthplace in Fulham. Her baptism on 29 January 1905 at St Peter, Fulham.\n\n1911 Census\n\nGeorge William Henderson was a relative of Annie Jane Prior (nee Henderson).\n\nIn 1924, at the age of nineteen, Paddy spent nearly a year as a member of the travelling Rogues concert party from April to January 1925. In various reviews Paddy was praised for her comedy talent and her speciality dancing with comedian Fred Roper. They were appearing at Leas Pavilion, Folkestone in January 1925, but by the 5 February Paddy had left the Rogues to join the Gamblers and Their Tipster concert party at the same venue. This party also toured extensively, so before she was twenty-one, Paddy had seen much of the country and gained valuable professional experience into the bargain.\n\n24 December 1924\n\nWhitehall Court, Fulham – Paddy’s home in the 1920s.\n\nIn November 1925 Paddy appeared at the Taunton Lyceum in Little Miss Muffet as Dolly Dimple. The pantomime toured various towns until early 1926.\n\nBy April Paddy was out of work and obliged to put an advertisement in The Stage as follows:\n\nBy July Paddy was working again, this time with Leslie Fuller’s Whitby Pedlars, and a review pointed out that, “Paddy Prior is a charming and dainty soubrette, who uses her mezzo voice effectively.”\n\nThe pattern of Paddy’s stage career was set: concert party, after-dinner entertainment, pantomime and musical comedy. Towards the end of the twenties she was also in a programme from Daventry, De Courville’s Hour in 1929.\n\nAlbert de Courville.\n\nthen in the early thirties in Philip Ridgeway’s series entitled The Ridgeway Parade, which included Janet Lind, Dorothy Dampier and Hermione Gingold in the cast. She starred in the Cicely Courtneidge role on a Scottish tour of Lido Lady in 1929.\n\n31 January 1929 – Advertisement in The Stage. PADDY PRIOR – Playing Lead LIDO LADY Co. This week, Theatre Royal, Inverness, next His Majesty’s, Aberdeen\n\nSelection from LIDO LADY\n\nCast of Ridgeway Parade. I always thought that ‘The Ridgeway Parade’ must be an early TV show because of the costumes and the dancing, but apparently the cast wore costumes and danced before doing the broadcast in order to ‘warm up’! There are many Ridgeway Parade broadcasts in the early thirties. I will only mention a few of them here.\n\nThe Ridgeway Parade – Regional Programme London, 7 October 1931 21.15 (New Series.

Philip Ridgeway.\n\nSinging, dancing, burlesque-and Mr. Ridgeway. The producer is the life and soul of his own shows. It is Philip Ridgeway who designed costumes for his Paraders to wear in the Studio, who makes his whole company dance furiously for a minute before the red light goes on in order that they should start their broadcast warmed up, who created and impersonated Joe Ramsbotham of Rawthenstall, of the unsteady Lancashire accent. These Parades, of which the present series is the third, are among the most generally popular light entertainments ever broadcast. They may lack the subtlety and satire of the revues of Gordon McConnel, John Watt, Denis Freeman; their aim is otherwise—broad humour, popular songs, vitality, rather than finesse. Many of the members of former Parade companies are taking part in the present series. Mr. Ridgeway’s musical director, Dorothy Hogben, is again in charge of the orchestra. Philip Ridgeway is well qualified to possess an acquaintance with the popular taste in entertainment. Still in his thirties, he has been connected with the theatre since he was a boy, as actor, author, producer and manager in turn. It is typical of his lively versatility that the two most widely acclaimed achievements of his career have been his introduction of Chekhov to London, at the Barnes Theatre, several years ago, and the invention last autumn of the Ridgeway Parades. Tonight he will be beside the microphone as usual, the inevitable flower in his buttonhole, waving his company on, a cross between Sir Henry Wood, Francois Descamps and Grock. So on with the show. We’re a lot of little songs to chase the blues, Dancing shoes to amuse. We’re the lightest and the brightest of revues, We’re the Ridgeway Parade.\n\nMURRAY ASHFORD’S ENTERTAINERS – Regional Programme Midland, 17 June 1932 18.30 From THE PAVILION, JEPHSON GARDENS, LEAMINGTON SPA.

W INDERWICK, Registrar, Solicitors for the Petitioner:-W H Speed & Co., 18 Sackville Street, London, W1\n\nLike Webster, Paddy was a member of the Concert Artistes’ Association, and it was there that she first heard Webster sing. In an interview with W.S. Meadmore in Gramophone in November 1935, Webster described his meeting with Paddy. He was singing One Alone from The Desert Song when his attention was drawn to her seated in the audience, obviously enjoying his singing. They were introduced after the concert and married on 10 October 1932. They spent their honeymoon in Newquay, Cornwall.\n\n10 October 1932 – Marriage. Webster married Dorothy Annie Alice Prior on 10 October 1932 at Fulham Registry Office.\n\nWhile married to Dorothy (Paddy) Prior, the couple lived at 5 Crescent Court, Golders Green Crescent, NW11. They were listed separately in the telephone book as Webster Booth, tenor, Speedwell 6608; and Paddy Prior, soubrette-entertainer, Speedwell 6608\n\nAlthough Webster was living with Anne at her flat in Lauderdale Mansions in 1937, Paddy and Webster remained listed in the telephone book at the same address until their divorce was made final in October 1938.\n\n13 October 1932 – Wedding Bells. Paddy Prior and Webster Booth were married at the Fulham Register Office last Monday. A reception followed before the bride and bridegroom left for a honeymoon at Newquay, and several professional friends were in attendance to toast the happy couple.\n\nOne Alone\n\nPaddy and Webster lived at Crescent Court, Golders Green Crescent, Golders Green during their marriage (pictured above).\n\nMay 1933 – Piccadilly Revels.

Filming began in December and, according to Anne and Webster’s joint autobiography Duet, they fell in love almost at first sight. Paddy’s marriage to Webster was about to end before it had properly begun.\n\nFilming Faust (1934/1935)\n\n1935 – Fred Hartley’s wedding.

Click on the link and listen to Webster singing this song with Fred Hartley’s quintet.\n\nIn May 1935 Webster and Paddy did an extensive broadcast from Daventry entitled A Musical Comedy Pot-Pourri. Harry Bidgood and Sydney Jerome accompanied them on two pianos and played several piano duets. Paddy and Webster sang several duets together.\n\nTwo of the duets which Webster and Paddy sang in the broadcast were: Fancy Me Meeting You (Hit the Deck by Yeomans) sung here by Binnie Hale. Click on the link to listen.\n\nWho? (Sunny by Jerome Kern) sung here by Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan. Click on the link to listen.\n\nAs Binnie Hale is the archetypal soubrette, I dare say that Paddy’s mezzo soprano voice was similar to Binnie’s.\n\nIn October of the same year, Webster sang in an early broadcast with Anne Ziegler, several years before Paddy divorced him – the programme was called Musical Comedy Moments.\n\nWebster and Paddy continued to work together for several years after his meeting with Anne. Their last professional appearance was on 30 April 1936 when they performed together at the City Musical Union’s 84th Annual Dinner at the Holborn Restaurant. At the end of May they were guests at the wedding of their friends, Violet Stevens and Bryan Courage.\n\nBut in July 1937 Webster burnt his boats and he and Anne sailed for New York together, where Anne had been engaged to play in the musical, Virginia at the Center Theater. She had changed her name to Anne Booth for this production, after being advised that Americans disliked German-sounding names at that time also anticipating her eventual marriage to Webster.\n\nWebster returned to Southampton onboard the MV Georgic and gave his address as 74 Lauderdale Mansions, Maida Vale (Anne’s flat), although he was still listed in the telephone directory as living in Crescent Court, Golders Green, where he and Paddy had spent their short married life together.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1938 Anne and Webster began taking engagements together, while Paddy filed for divorce on 29 March 1938 “on the grounds of his adultery in April 1937, with Miss Irene Eastwood, otherwise Miss Anne Zeigler (sic), singer…”\n\nIn September 1938 before Webster’s divorce from Paddy had been finalised, Anne was featured on the cover of Radio Pictorial sporting an opulent diamond solitaire engagement ring:\n\nand on 7 October 1938 the absolute decree was granted to Paddy Prior against Webster Booth. Anne was named as the co-respondent in the divorce.\n\nAfter the divorce Paddy moved to 14 Muswell Hill Road, sharing her new home with a young Welsh singer, Bettie Bucknelle, who had sung on the radio show, Band Waggon, which starred Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch. In January 1939 Bettie was featured in a show with Charlie Kunz and Denny Dennis.\n\nAnne and Webster were married on 5 November 1938 and went on to even greater success as romantic duettists on the variety stage during the war. Several years later Webster approached a lawyer to try to get out of paying the alimony to Paddy which had been stipulated at the time of the divorce. For some reason Paddy did not make an objection when he stopped paying her alimony to which she was entitIed. By that time he must have been earning far more than she did. I always felt very sorry for Paddy having to watch Anne and Webster obtaining great fame in the theatre while she never achieved great fame despite being a talented and hard working performer.\n\nWitcock and Rutherford’s WEST-END VANITIES – Regional Programme London, 21 December 1938 16.30 Helen Hill, Paddy Prior, Jean Forbes-Macintyre, Lucas Bassett, Bradley Harris, Derek Moreland, Frank Wilcock, Tubby Harold.

It would have been interesting to hear her voice.\n\n20 November 1945. Only a few weeks after Anne and Webster had sung at the Victory Royal Variety Performance, Paddy was the hostess at the CAA and Bettie Bucknelle was one of the performers at this concert. One could hardly blame Paddy for feeling rather bitter about Anne and Webster’s great success while she was doing much the same thing as always.\n\nNovember 1946.\n\nPaddy and Bettie Bucknelle entertained British forces in the Middle East and returned to England in 1946. In 1947 she did a summer season with the Oval Entertainers, Margate, where a reviewer described her as “a gay young lady with a sparkling sense of humour as fresh as Margate’s famous sea breezes.”.\n\nOn 22 April 1948 she and Bettie Bucknelle sailed for Australia, where they intended to make a new life. Paddy’s brother had settled there some time earlier. It must have been upsetting for Paddy to see Webster and Anne as established stars while, despite her considerable talent, she had not made a big and lasting name for herself.\n\nBettie Bucknelle and Paddy Prior in Newquay, Cornwall shortly before they Bucknelle left for Australia. Paddy and Webster had spent their honeymoon in Newquay in 1932.\n\nExtract from passenger list to Australia.\n\nA newspaper photo regarding their arrival in Australia in 1948.\n\nLater that year Anne and Webster made an extensive and triumphant concert tour of New Zealand and Australia. They heard that Paddy and Bettie had booked seats in the front row for one of their concerts in Sydney. Webster feared that they might be planning an unpleasant demonstration against them at this concert. He was asked whether he could recommend Paddy as understudy to Cicely Courtneidge in the play, Under the Counter, which meant she would have to leave for New Zealand to rehearse the understudy role. Paddy had played the lead in a Scottish tour of Lido Lady in the late twenties, the same role in which Cicely had starred in London a few years earlier. He had no hesitation in making this recommendation, so Paddy was not able to attend the concert as she had to go to New Zealand right away to begin understudy rehearsals.\n\nThere is evidence of Bettie Bucknelle singing in a number of broadcasts, including broadcasts with the famous bandleader Jay Wilbur, but I could not find out anything about Paddy’s Australian theatrical career. In a 1949 electoral register, she is listed as a housewife!\n\nShortly after Anne and Webster returned to the UK from South Africa in 1978, a letter arrived for Webster from Paddy who was living in Tasmania where she had remarried. She said he would be welcome to visit her if he ever decided to go out there. Apparently, Anne did not show this letter to Webster!\n\nI was pleased to hear from Paddy’s niece, Beverley June McLachlan (née Prior) and her daughter, Paddy’s great-niece, Cheryl Willits recently. Paddy married Harold Bradshaw and the couple lived in Hobart, Tasmania where Paddy continued to entertain at their bowling club, singing and doing comedy skits. Cheryl mentioned that Paddy had sung on the radio with Ross Higgins,\n\nComments from Cheryl Willits and Beverley McLachlan which appeared in the original post on my Jean Collen website.\n\nCheryl Willits, in reply to me: Hey there, My mother might be able to help you on this as she is Paddy’s niece. I am her great niece. If you would like any info feel free to email me and I could put you in touch with my mother. Reading the article has been a delight, Regards, Cheryl.\n\nBeverley McLachlan: Paddy Prior did marry Harold Bradshaw. She was my aunt. My Father was Paddy’s brother. Paddy and Brad lived in Tasmania and still entertained at their bowling club, singing and comedy skits in Hobart, Tasmania.\n\nSadly, I did not hear any more from Beverly or Cheryl.\n\nJean Collen\n\nApril, 2016.\n\nUpdated: 6 April 2024."
