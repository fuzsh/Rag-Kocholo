        "text": "Introduction & Background\n\nResearch integrity has been defined as a complex phenomenon that “characterizes both individual researchers and the institutions in which they work” (Office of Research Integrity 2002). At the individual level, research integrity has been defined as “active adherence to the ethical principles and professional standards essential for the responsible practice of research” (Korenman 2006, Chapter 1, p. 2). This represents researchers’ commitment to professional norms such as honesty, collegiality, trustworthiness, and regard for the accuracy of the scientific record. At the organizational level, research integrity represents a commitment on the part of institutions to promote and foster climates supportive of ethical behavior on the part of their members. This requires both commitment to ethical conduct and support of integrity in research on the part of institutional leaders, and the creation of institutional structures, processes, and policies to ensure appropriate self-monitoring (Gunsalus 1993). Combined, these individual traits and institutional characteristics comprise core elements of organizational climates.\n\nOrganizational climate can be viewed as “the shared meaning organizational members attach to the events, policies, practices, and procedures they experience and the behaviors they see being rewarded, supported, and expected” (Ehrhart, Schneider, and Macey 2013, p. 115). The focus on observable, manifest aspects of organizations stands in contrast to the concept of organizational culture, which generally refers to underlying values, beliefs, and assumptions that guide behaviors of individuals in an organization, but that are not easily observed, measured or reported on (Schein 2000). In other words, organizational climate can be thought of as an observable expression of the culture of a place. Common elements between organizational culture and climate include a focus on the macro view of an organization, and emphasis on the context in which people work and the importance of shared experiences over individual differences. Both also emphasize the meaning of that context for organizational members and their behaviors and the role of leaders and leadership in setting that context; both are considered to be important to organizational effectiveness (Ehrhart, Schneider, and Macey 2013).\n\nOver the past decade, there has been an increased recognition and emphasis on research organizations having organizational climates that support research integrity (Steneck 2002; Martinson et al. 2010; Geller et al. 2010; Mumford et al. 2007; Vasgird 2007). This may be partly attributable to the publication of a 2002 report by the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), Integrity in Scientific Research: Creating an Environment That Promotes Responsible Conduct. That report promoted a performance-based, self-regulatory approach to fostering research integrity, recommending that institutions seeking to create sound research climates should: 1) establish and continuously measure their structures, processes, policies, and procedures, 2) evaluate the institutional climate supporting integrity in the conduct of research and 3) use this knowledge for ongoing improvement (Office of Research Integrity 2002). In short, that IOM report recommended quality improvement efforts. Quality Improvement (QI) is a shorthand term describing systematic and ongoing (continuous) efforts and actions aimed at creating measurable improvements in organizational performance (Batalden and Davidoff 2007). QI is usually considered an iterative process, involving reporting and feedback systems. Organizational theory and empirical evidence tell us that we should expect organizations to vary in their capacity, capability, and readiness to make organizational changes (Greenhalgh et al. 2004; Damschroder et al. 2009; Harrison and Kimani 2009; Lukas et al. 2007).\n\nTheoretical Background and Hypotheses\n\nThe conceptual model underpinning the 2002 IOM report explicitly acknowledges that the outputs and outcomes of an organization are multiply determined, being functions of a) the inputs and resources available, but also b) the character of the organization itself (Lundberg 1985). Awareness of the potential influences of ethical culture and climate on organizational outcomes (Simha and Cullen 2012) leads us to focus on the organization structure, processes, policies, and practices. The 2002 IOM report explicitly recognized the role of the local climate – of the lab, the department, the institution – in shaping the behavior of scientists, and acknowledged that these climates can foster or undermine behavioral integrity. Organizational climate is also fostered and shaped by institutional leaders who are able to exercise some level of control and influence (Mayer et al. 2007; Burke and Litwin 1992). This is not to deny the importance of external influences also likely to be operative, including structural misalignments, policy influences, financial constraints, political factors, etc. (Lundberg 1985). Organizational climate can be thought of as a lens through which such external factors come to influence multiple qualities of the research conducted. Carefully and thoughtfully focused, these lenses can help to bring out the best qualities. If not carefully configured, they can also be damaging, and can undermine best research practices (Pfeffer 2015; Pfeffer and Langton 1993). It is the anticipated influence on organizational members’ behavior that ultimately drives our interest in organizational climates.\n\nEfforts to Influence Organizational Climates\n\nThe provision of survey-based feedback to managers is perhaps one of the most ubiquitous methods employed in organizations to influence the quality of organizational output and outcomes (Falletta and Combs 2001), yet very little empirical work has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of feedback and reporting interventions on changing organizational climates. This knowledge gap was recently identified as an area in need of research (Ehrhart, Schneider, and Macey 2013). Examples can be found of climate survey feedback being used as one component of more sustained and intensive interventions within organizations, typically occurring over many months, or even years (Cummings and Worley 2009; Falletta and Combs 2001; Hopkins 1982; Zohar and Luria 2003). Within the Veterans Health Administration, the Civility, Respect, Engagement in the Workforce (CREW) Initiative, focused specifically on “civility climate” in VHA work-units, using a civility-scale from the VA’s All Employee Survey to report pre-intervention civility metrics as one component of an intensive intervention (Osatuke et al. 2009). These more intensive interventions have included team-building, lab-training, design-teams, and process consultations, sometimes in combination with survey-feedback. Reviews of the organizational development literature have suggested that there is little evidence that survey feedback, by itself, yields behavior change or improvements in organizational outputs (Friedlander and Brown 1974). Such feedback might, however, serve as an effective impetus to stimulate organizational change, and may best be viewed as an intermediate step between diagnosing organizational problems and engaging in eventual problem-solving, with results from organizational member surveys providing fodder for the development of problem-solving methods and actions (Born and Mathieu 1996; Cummings and Worley 2009).\n\nResearch Setting and Context\n\nThe VA’s mission is focused first and foremost on meeting the health needs of veterans, with research in this context being specifically focused on serving that larger mission, with a strong emphasis on applied research. In pursuing its core mission, the VA maintains a sizable research service (with a budget appropriation in 2015 of over $600 million, supporting more than 10,000 research-engaged employees), whose proper functioning is predicated on sustaining the integrity of VA research. VA leadership is interested in supporting research best practices in the VA and fostering research integrity. The VA differs from more traditional academic research settings in multiple dimensions, including its structure, workforce, mission, and culture. Structurally, the VA is a nationwide entity, with hundreds of distributed facilities, and well over 100,000 employees. This national environment means that all VA Medical Centers operate under a common funding environment and common national policies. These commonalities notwithstanding, the autonomy of VA facilities leads us to expect variation in local leadership and research climates. The VA is also a Federal department whose activities are subject to different, and possibly a greater number of, regulations and legal requirements than traditional academic settings. The VA has historically been the subject of intense Congressional and public attention. How organizational leaders have coped with and responded to this attention has shaped the organizational culture. Partly as a result of these structural and mission-based features of the organization, the culture of the VA includes a long history of QI efforts, many of which have been informed by “reporting and feedback” processes similar to those we are testing in this study.\n\nResearch Objective and Rationale\n\nWe conducted a pilot randomized trial of the uptake and effectiveness of two methods of reporting feedback from a survey on institutional climate and research integrity. Facilities were randomized to receive written feedback alone or written feedback supplemented with phone discussions for reviewing and interpreting the reports. Previous publications have used the same survey instrument to characterize research integrity climates in traditional academic research settings, including public universities and academic medical centers, (Martinson, Thrush, and Crain 2013; Wells et al. 2014) and in the VA, as part of the larger project of which this pilot is one component (Martinson et al. 2016).\n\nStudy Hypotheses\n\nH1: Research leaders randomized to the enhanced intervention group will be more likely to plan or attempt to make organizational changes than research leaders randomized to the basic feedback group.\n\nH2: Research leaders randomized to the enhanced intervention group will be more likely than research leaders randomized to the basic feedback group to plan or attempt to make organizational changes responsive to the results of the survey.\n\nH3: Facility level of receptivity to quality improvement input will be correlated with the likelihood that research leaders take action in response to the enhanced feedback intervention.\n\nDiscussion\n\nEnhanced feedback of results of an organizational climate survey appears to be a promising intervention that may increase the likelihood that organizational leaders take responsive action to improve their organizational climates.\n\nParticipation of research leaders from our randomly selected facilities was lower than we had anticipated we would see (59%). Among those who consented, however, we obtained a fairly high rate of completion of follow-up interviews (88%). Consistent with hypothesis H1, the proportion of leaders reporting having taken some action in response to our intervention was twice as high in the enhanced arm as in the basic feedback arm. Among facilities assigned to the enhanced study arm, and again, consistent with hypothesis H2, a higher proportion of actions taken were deemed to be consistent with and responsive to our tailored feedback than in the basic feedback arm. Due in large part to the small sample size of this pilot study, however, even these large percentage point differences between study arms are not statistically distinguishable.\n\nWe did not observe a consistent pattern of response to feedback across the tertiles of our QI receptivity score; however, we did observe that leaders from facilities in the lowest tertile of this score were less likely to participate in the study. While not completely supportive of our initial hypothesis (H3), this result is consistent with findings from an earlier study employing survey-guided feedback that found supervisor use of feedback was more likely in work-units in which subordinates had more favorable perceptions of management (Born and Mathieu 1996). To avoid such a “rich get richer” effect, it may be important that participation in such organizational feedback efforts is compulsory for organizational leaders, and possibly incorporated as a component of their regular performance reviews.\n\nThe observation of differentially lower participation among the low QI receptivity sites assigned to the basic feedback arm with higher participation rates across all levels of QI receptivity among those assigned to the enhanced intervention arm is suggestive that offering the enhanced intervention may be a way to at least partially overcome non-participation among those who would generally not be receptive to such input.\n\nSome caveats and limitations of this study warrant mention. First, the size of this pilot project was limited by time (a two-year funding period) and available budget. As such, we knew from the outset that the experimental portion of the study was likely to be under-powered to detect statistically significant differences between intervention arms. Second, we obtained a less than stellar participation in the trial on the part of research leaders across our sampled facilities. Furthermore, the organizational climate assessment data were obtained in the Spring of 2014, just prior to intense media coverage of a controversy regarding delays in scheduling of appointments and treatment for veterans throughout the VA (“Veterans Health Administration Scandal of 2014” 2016). That controversy led to the resignation of several top-level executives in the VA, and ultimately to the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Rogers 2014). The delivery of our intervention occurred from late 2014 through the Fall of 2015, during the height of this disruptive controversy. Reports from our participating research leaders indicated they perceived a greater emphasis on utilizing internal resources (including physician investigators in VA) on patient care activities. It is certainly possible that these factors reduced the willingness and ability of these research leaders to participate in our study. As at least one participant suggested, “You know, it’s one of those things where we couldn’t—Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, you know? We had to keep the daily business going. And it’s non-stop daily business.” In this context, it is understandable that our intervention and study would have taken a “back seat” to more urgent needs.\n\nThese limitations notwithstanding, our study also has noteworthy strengths. A recent review of the literature on organizational change management concluded that existing evidence regarding the efficacy of organizational change efforts is weak, due to a heavy reliance on weak study designs – including a preponderance of cross-sectional, observational studies, low internal validity of studies, and studies lacking control-groups and randomization of treatment assignment (Barends et al. 2014). Our experimental design, employing careful steps to ensure internal validity, combined with randomization to treatment and comparison groups, and use of a previously validated measure of organizational climates, therefore stands out as exemplary in this arena of research.\n\nTo put this work in a larger context, we would note that reporting and feedback efforts such as these quite likely represent necessary, but not sufficient elements to bring about sustained organizational change. As posited by the Framework for Organizational Transformation, such efforts may serve as impetus to organizational change (Lukas et al. 2007). Yet, this is only one of five critical elements needed for sustained organizational transformation; the other four being 1) leadership commitment to quality, 2) improvement initiatives actively engaging staff in problem solving, 3) alignment of organizational goals with resources and actions and 4) integration that bridges traditional intra-organizational boundaries between organizational components. As noted in previous reviews of the organizational change literature, the primary utility of survey feedback may lie in its value bridging between diagnosing organizational problems and implementing methods to ameliorate those problems (Friedlander and Brown 1974). Some existing evidence suggests that how much the data are used in the process of solving organizational problems is positively associated with improvements in follow-up measures, in terms of both outcome and process measures (Born and Mathieu 1996). The VHA CREW initiative employed pre-intervention measures of civility climate in much this way – as an impetus to organizational change while also being used to inform the content of much more intensive (weekly) work-group level discussions to which participating organizations committed for a full year (Osatuke et al. 2009). And while the CREW study did identify significant effects of their intensive intervention, it seems almost certain that organizational units willing to participate in such an intensive intervention may have been highly selected, calling into question the external validity of those effects. This may, however be an unavoidable limitation of organizational change efforts. As has been noted by others in the field of organizational development, because the results of such survey feedback may identify needed changes in key organizational process, structures, and leadership behavior, such changes generally cannot happen without the unwavering, visible, and authentic involvement and “buy-in” of the most senior leaders in an organization (Falletta and Combs 2001).\n\nHistorically, most efforts at improving research integrity have focused on either the education or socialization of individual, typically junior, researchers through courses in ethics or the “responsible conduct of research,” (National Academies 2009; Watts et al. 2016) on the one hand, and a reliance on organizational “whistle-blowers,” on the other hand (Devine 1995; Redman and Caplan 2015; Mecca et al. 2014). Yet, there is an increasing recognition among those concerned with fostering and sustaining research activity that these remedies, though important and necessary, are not sufficient to attain the objective. This is true in large part because both strategies are primarily “blind” to the fact that individuals do not behave in a vacuum, and that the structures, processes, reward systems, and incentive structures that impinge upon, constrain or provoke individuals, can thereby strongly influence their behavior, for better or worse. As a result, we have begun to see greater attention paid to such contextual factors, and greater recognition of the vital importance of institutional responsibility in both maintaining research integrity and avoiding outright research misconduct (DeMets et al. 2016; Davies et al. 2016; Pennock 2015; Yarborough et al. 2009; Binder, Friedli, and Fuentes-Afflick 2015; Devereaux 2014). Our findings are consistent with this evolving perspective on research integrity, as well as being a continuation of our work along these lines (Martinson et al. 2010; Crain, Martinson, and Thrush 2013; Martinson et al. 2009). Climate survey feedback may provide research leaders with information and identify concerns about their organizations, as seen from the “bottom up” by organizational members that they might otherwise not be aware of. Such surveys, because they are anonymous, also offer a milder, less risky and costly alternative to organizational members who “see something,” and want to “say something,” but who may not feel sufficiently safe or empowered to do so openly. In this way, climate survey feedback offers a potentially fruitful alternative to existing pathways to foster research integrity."
