        "text": "Description\n\nEarly Edition, Illustrated, Publishers' Original Binding\n\nPresenting this work of humour, a parody of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, instead becoming Adolf in Blunderland. In this work, a caricature of Adolf Hitler finds himself making many mistakes and fumbling about foolishly. This satirical work was intended to present Hitler as a fool who deserved true justice of the law.\n\nWritten by American actor and songwriter James Dyrenforth in collaboration with British scriptwriter and lyricist Max Kester.\n\nProfusely illustrated by British cartoonish Norman Mansbridge.\n\nContaining a previous owner's ink signature to the front free-endpaper, 'B. Hayes'.\n\nCondition\n\nIn the publisher's original paper covered pictorial boards. Externally, some general shelf wear to the boards and some loss to the tail of the spine. Previous owner's ink signature to the front free-endpaper. Internally, binding slightly tender but firm. Pages are bright and clean.\n\nOverall: Good\n\nDelivery & payment\n\nWe send all of our books via courier which is a fully tracked and insured service. In our experience we find this to be the most reliable and quickest form of delivery. Our primary courier is DHL, but we are able to accommodate special requests if required, including postal delivery for items under 2kg. See More Details"
