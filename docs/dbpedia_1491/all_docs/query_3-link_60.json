        "text": "Endowed faculty positions enable RUSH to recognize the accomplishments of physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, community engagement leaders and scientific investigators who have dedicated their careers to the future of science, medicine, health equity and patient care. They also help attract the very best and brightest students from around the world, who come to RUSH to study and work with esteemed faculty members. The future of health care is built on this synergy between endowed faculty and talented students. Students, residents and fellows learn side by side with distinguished practitioner-teachers — a concept for health sciences education that was defined at RUSH and emphasizes faculty members’ commitment to integrating practice, research and education."
