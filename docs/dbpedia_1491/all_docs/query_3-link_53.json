        "text": "Published results of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates\n\nDespite fairly consistently elevated rates, the available literature has found widely disparate figures of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates. Some of this variability undoubtedly results from the divergent approaches used in assessing such populations. The validity and reliability of psychiatric diagnosis in bariatric surgery candidates have been markedly enhanced in the last few years through the use of structured diagnostic interviews, which are the state-of-the-art method for diagnosing psychopathology in clinical research [26]. A structured interview is defined as “an interview consisting of … predetermined questions presented in a definite order.” Such questions “yield diagnostic information based on the patient’s responses and the interviewer’s observations” [27]. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) generally takes about one to one and a half hours to administer, and allows for the assessment of the full spectrum of current and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses.\n\nTo examine this literature, the published studies were obtained using the following search engines and strategies following consultation with a medical librarian: PubMed (NLM): Bariatric Surgery - ((((\"gastric banding\" OR \"gastric bands\" OR \"gastric band\" OR LAGB)) OR (biliary pancreatic diversion OR biliary pancreatic diversions OR biliopancreatic diversion OR biliopancreatic diversions* OR biliopancreatic diversion[Mesh])) OR (sleeve gastrectomy OR sleeve gastrectomies)) OR (((\"Anastomosis, Roux-en-Y\"[Mesh Terms] OR (\"anastomosis, roux-en-y\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"anastomosis\"[All Fields] AND \"roux-en-y\"[All Fields]) OR \"rouxen-y anastomosis\"[All Fields] OR \"roux en y\"[All Fields])) AND (\"obesity\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"obesity\"[All Fields])) OR (\"Bariatric Surgery\"[Mesh] OR (bariatric surgeries[Text Word] OR bariatric surgery[Text Word])) OR \"Obesity, Morbid/surgery\"[Mesh] OR gastric bypass OR gastroplasty OR jejunoileal bypass OR lipectomy); Psychopathology \"Mental Disorders\"[Mesh] OR psychological OR psychologist OR interview* OR psychiatric OR depression OR mood OR anxiety OR mental OR bipolar OR compulsive; PsycInfo (EBSCO) - (DE \"Bariatric Surgery\" or roux-en-y OR biliary pancreatic diversion OR biliopancreatic diversion OR sleeve gastrectomy) AND (DE \"Psychodiagnostic Interview\" OR DE \"Diagnostic Interview Schedule\" OR DE \"Structured Clinical Interview\") OR (DE \"Psychological Assessment\" OR DE \"Behavioral Assessment\" OR DE \"Cognitive Assessment\" OR DE \"Neuropsychological Assessment\"); Scopus - (TITLE-ABS-KEY(interview*)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"bariatric surger*\" OR \"gastric bypass*\" OR \"gastric band*\" OR roux-en-y OR \"sleeve gastrectom*\" OR \"biliary pancreatic diversion*\" OR \"biliopancreatic diversion*\")). All abstracts were reviewed by the first two authors for relevance. The only exclusion criterion was non-English language.\n\nStudies that have utilized the SCID in investigating the current and lifetime prevalences of psychiatric disorders among bariatric surgery candidates include studies from the US, Italy and Germany [28–32]. The published results of these studies are summarized in . The reason for the wide disparity among the prevalence rates of psychopathology in these studies is a matter of conjecture but the results may be attributable to differences in the nature of the samples, geographical differences, and various other confounding factors, which we will discuss.\n\nTable 1\n\nAuthors\n\n(year)Rosenberger et al.\n\n[28]\n\n(2006)Kalarchian et al.\n\n[29]\n\n(2007)Mauri et al.\n\n[30]\n\n(2008)Mühlhans et al.\n\n[31]\n\n(2009)Mitchell et al.\n\n[32]\n\n(2012)LocationUSAUSAItalyGermanyUSASample size (N)174288282146199LifetimeCurrentLifetimeCurrentLifetimeCurrentLifetimeCurrentLifetimeCurrentAny Axis I disorder (%)36.824.166.337.837.620.972.655.568.633.7Any affective disorder (%)22.410.945.515.6226.454.831.544.211.6Major depressive disorder14.93.442.010.419.14.650.725.338.77.0 Dysthymia5.75.70.03.83.11.18.26.23.53.5 Bipolar INANA3.51.71.10.4NANANANAAny anxiety disorder (%)15.511.537.52418.112.421.215.131.718.1 Social phobiaNANA9.49.03.22.86.26.26.03.0 Specific phobia5.75.78.07.35.35.07.56.812.611.1 Posttraumatic stress disorderNANA11.82.81.81.18.94.111.13.0 Obsessive-compulsiveNANA3.82.12.82.1NANANANA Panic disorderNANA19.45.98.54.6NANANANA Generalized anxiety disorderNANA0.06.31.11.1NANANANA Anxiety disorder, not otherwise specifiedNANANANA0.4NANANANANAAny substance use disorder (%)5.20.632.61.71.1NA15.11.435.71.0 Alcohol abuse/dependence4.00.630.90.70.7NA11.00.733.20.5 Other drug abuse/dependence2.30.016.01.00.4NA6.20.77.50.5Any eating disorder (%)13.810.329.516.312.87.150.037.726.611.1 Binge eating disorder (BED)4.63.427.116.011.06.7NA23.313.110.1 Bulimia nervosa0.00.03.50.31.80.46.80.02.51.0 EDNOS*9.26.9NANANANANA14.413.1NAAdjustment disorder (%)1.11.1NANANANANANANANAAny somatoform disorder (%)NANANANANANA3.43.4NANA\n\nThe rates of psychopathology (current and lifetime) were roughly equivalent across the studies conducted by Rosenberger et al. [28] and Mauri et al. [30]. Similarly, the results of Kalarchian et al. study [29] were similar to those of Mitchell et al. study [32]. The study of Mühlhans et al. [31] was comparable to Kalarchian [29] and Mitchell et al. [32], with the exception that Mühlhans et al. [31] reported higher rates of current psychiatric disorders, particularly affective disorders. The most common category of lifetime disorders in all the studies was affective disorders, with major depressive disorder being the most common among individual diagnosis. With regard to current psychiatric disorders, anxiety disorders were the most common class in all the studies, the exception being the study of Mühlhans et al. [31], which reported eating disorders, in particular Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS, which included BED) to be the most common category.\n\nAn extensive body of literature suggests that childhood psychological trauma may increase risk for both psychiatric disorders and obesity [33–35]. This may help to explain the high prevalence of lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder in the bariatric surgery candidates in most of these studies. The studies of Kalarchian et al. [29] and Mitchell et al. [32] in particular, reported high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (11.8% and 11.1% respectively). A history of childhood sexual abuse is associated with numerous adverse psychological sequelae and has also been linked to the presence of eating disorder behavior and obesity [36]. High prevalence rates of lifetime eating disorders were also found in these two studies (29.5% and 15.6%), providing additional support for the possible association between childhood maltreatment and eating disorder in bariatric surgery candidates. In addition, the available studies suggest high rates of lifetime substance abuse disorders in bariatric surgery candidates; however, less than 1% met diagnostic criteria for the disorder at the time of evaluation across these studies. This discrepancy may reflect underreporting of current problems by these individuals. One possible contributing hypothesis is suggested by the significant inverse relationship between body mass index and alcohol use reported by Kleiner and colleagues [37], who proposed that substance abuse remits when eating behavior predominates because food may compete with alcohol for brain reward systems, making alcohol ingestion less reinforcing. Simon et al. [38] also reported obesity to be associated with an approximately 25% decrease in odds of substance use disorders.\n\nComparison of prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates with other population groups\n\nThe results of the above studies suggest that the rates of psychopathology are substantial in bariatric surgery candidates. However, it is also important to compare these rates to the rates in other populations. We compared the lifetime and current prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders among several groups: general population, obese individuals not seeking treatment data, and obese individuals considering bariatric surgery data ( , ). Data for the general population estimate in the US adult population were taken from the National Comorbidity Survey- Replication (NCS-R) [38–40], and for the Italian and German population were derived from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD) Survey [41–44]. The studies rely on nationally representative samples and use face-to-face assessments using the World Mental Health Survey version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which is a structured lay-administered diagnostic interview for the assessment of DSM-IV disorders. In order to examine the prevalence rates for groups in the US, German and Italian populations, we combined the results of two or more studies conducted in each region by calculating the means. Herpertz et al. [41] reported their results broken down by sex, so we recalculated their results to establish estimates for the entire sample.\n\nTable 2\n\nGeneral population sampleObese individuals not seeking\n\ntreatmentObese individuals seeking bariatric surgeryGeographical LocationUSGermanyItalyUSGermanyItalyUSGermanyItalyAuthors\n\n(sample size,\n\nN)Kessler et\n\nal.

However, a consistent pattern was observed for the bariatric surgery candidates, where the current and lifetime rates of psychiatric disorders were considerably higher than the non-treatment seeking obese and general population sample in all three studies.\n\nThe literature shows that the relationship between obesity and mental disorders is stronger among those with more severe obesity [15, 44, 45]. As the individuals who are assessed for bariatric surgery are generally severely obese (BMI≥40Kg/m2), the prevalence of psychopathology is much higher among this group. Previous studies that have assessed conventional measures of psychopathology in persons with lesser degrees of obesity have often found little evidence of increased psychological disturbance [4]. However, in the present review, it is hard to clarify whether the higher rate of psychopathology among treatment groups was related to their extreme obesity or to their treatment-seeking behavior. One of the approaches that could clarify this issue is to stratify obesity by severity (class 1, BMI 30-34.9; class 2, BMI 35-39.9: class 3, BMI ≥ 40). This approach was not used by most of the studies discussed, except those by Mauri et al. [30] and Scott et al. [44]. Another factor that should be kept in mind while comparing the results is that some surveys had provided estimates for current prevalence rates (i.e., past month) and others for 12 month rates ( ), which are perhaps somewhat comparable but not necessarily the same as current diagnoses. A final methodological difference which may affect comparison between different groups is that instruments used in the studies were also different, with CIDI used in the studies on general population and non-treatment-seeking obese groups and SCID used in the studies on bariatric surgery candidates. The clinical reappraisal studies conducted by the World Health Organization have shown that CIDI-SCID agreement with DSM-IV diagnoses are generally good, that CIDI lifetime prevalence estimates are generally conservative relative to SCID estimates, and that CIDI 12-month prevalence estimates are generally unbiased relative to SCID estimates [47]. Overall, methodological and cross-national differences make these studies difficult to compare.\n\nMethodological issues and studies of psychiatric disorders in bariatric cases\n\nThe evaluation instrument used in all the studies on bariatric surgery candidates was the English, Italian or the German version of the SCID Interview. Four studies [28, 30–32] conducted face-to-face interviews, while that of Kalarchian et al. [29] conducted interviews by telephone. However, previous research has suggested that telephone administration of the SCID yields comparable results as face-to-face administration [26, 48–52].\n\nIn the studies of Kalarchian et al. [29], Mühlhans et al. [31], and Mitchell et al. [32], the evaluation process was strictly independent of the approval process for the surgery and the participants were assured that information provided for research would not influence their candidacy for surgery. On the other hand, in the studies of Rosenberger et al. [29] and Mauri et al. [30], the interviews were part of the presurgical evaluation interview, which might have led participants to selectively underreport some aspects of their psychiatric status or history in order to present themselves as psychologically healthy candidates. Fabricatore et al. [53] have described this potential of “impression management” in bariatric surgery candidates. The studies with an independent evaluation process [29, 31, 32] yielded results roughly comparable to each other, and a higher prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders than studies that did not have an independent assessment process. Thus, the rates of psychopathology assessed in these studies may more accurately reflect the true prevalence of such problems.\n\nAnother important difference among the studies that should be considered is that the range of psychiatric disorders differed across studies. For example, eating disorder, not otherwise specified (EDNOS) is the most common eating disorder diagnosis in specialized treatment settings and in community samples [54] and two studies [29, 30] did not assess EDNOS, which might have influenced the prevalence rates reported. Somatoform disorders were reported only in the studies of Rosenberger et al. [28], and Mühlhans et al. [31]. Psychotic disorders were mentioned in only these two studies. A current psychotic disorder was an exclusion criterion in the study of Mühlhans et al. [31], whereas Rosenberger et al. [28] reported having found no psychotic disorders. Similarly, the prevalence rates of adjustment disorders were only reported in the study of Rosenberger et al [28]. Thus, these differences in range of disorders assessed could be one of the reasons for variations in the total comorbidity estimate on bariatric surgery candidates. Similarly, comparison with the rates of Axis I disorders in general population groups and non-treatment obese samples have to be made with caution, keeping in mind that disorders assessed in the studies were not always identical.\n\nEffects of demographic variables on prevalence of psychopathology\n\nSociodemographic factors such as gender, age, education, socioeconomic status and ethnicity may moderate the relationship between obesity and psychiatric disorders [3]. Bariatric surgery candidates are predominantly female which was true in the five studies discussed here, with >70% of their samples being female ( ). In the general population, women are known to present with higher rates of Axis I psychiatric disorders than men, especially anxiety and affective disorders [44, 55, 56]. In addition to their elevated baseline risk for depression and anxiety disorders, the risk increases considerably in women who are obese as compared to normal-weight controls [44]. As a result, a difference in prevalence rates between men and women would be expected in bariatric surgery candidates as well [31]. Kalarchian et al. [29] did not report prevalence rates broken down by sex in their study, although, Kalarchian et al. [29] reported that current and lifetime prevalence of Axis I disorders did not differ by sex. Four of the bariatric studies summarized their results separated by sex [28, 30–32]. Mauri et al. [30] found no sex differences among classes of all lifetime and current Axis I disorders. However, when the prevalence of individual diagnoses was compared between genders, lifetime major depressive disorder was found to be twice as common in women (21.3%) than in men (10.5%). In the study of Rosenberger et al. [28], women were significantly more likely to report a current as well as a lifetime history of any anxiety disorder, and a lifetime history of any affective disorder, especially major depressive disorder. Mühlhans et al. [31] found higher rates of affective and eating disorders (lifetime and current) in women. Thus, the observed instances of differential patterning by sex are consistent with previous reports, with women in general showing higher prevalence rates of common forms of psychopathology compared to men [6, 45, 57–59].\n\nTable 4\n\nRosenberger et al.\n\n[28] (2006)\n\n(N=174)Kalarchian et al.\n\n[29](2007)\n\n(N=288)Mauri et al.\n\n[30](2008)\n\n(N=282)Mühlhans et al.\n\n[31](2009)\n\n(N=146)Mitchell et al.\n\n[32] (2012)\n\n(N=199)Gender (female) (%)75.383.379.871.982.9Ethnicity (white) (%)68.488.2--92.4Mean age, years (SD)42.9 (11.1)46.2 (9.4)42.1 (11.4)38.7(10.0)Median age= 46Mean BMI, kg/m2 (SD)50.2 (8.5)52.2 (9.7)43.5 (7.0)49.3(7.8)Median BMI=44.9Marital status (married) (%)59.857.369.551.4-Education (high school or less) (%)25.930.3-86.9-Procedure plannedRYGB---RYGB (N=119) Adjustable band (N=80)\n\nIn the three US studies [28, 29, 32], the samples were comprised largely of non-Hispanic whites, so the results may not be generalizable to other cultural or ethnic groups. Of note, Simon et al. [38] reported that the association between obesity and psychopathology is statistically significant only among non-Hispanic whites. Similar results were seen in the general population sample in the NCS-R [39], with non-Hispanic whites having significantly higher risk of anxiety, mood and substance use disorders.\n\nParticipant age may also affect the relationship of psychiatric disorders and pursuing bariatric surgery. The mean age for the five samples comprising bariatric surgery candidates ranged from 38-46 years (Table 6). One US survey suggests a stronger association between obesity and psychopathology among those younger than 65 [60]. Similarly, Simon et al. [38] assessed the association between obesity and psychiatric disorders in the general population in four age groups of ≤29, 30-44, 45-59 and ≥60 years. Higher prevalence rates of most of the psychiatric disorders in obese people (BMI≥30) were found in the groups of ≤29 and 30-44 years. Whether the same holds true for bariatric surgery candidates is unclear. Among the studies discussed here, mean age was lowest for the sample reported by Mühlhans et al. [31]; importantly the rates of psychiatric disorders reported were highest in this study, supporting the possibility that there might be some association between current psychopathology and younger age in bariatric surgery samples. Further research is required to investigate whether or not such an association exists.\n\nThe samples also varied by their socioeconomic status (SES), and this to some extent depended on from where the populations were drawn. Studies in general suggest that lower SES is associated with higher BMI and a higher rate of obesity [61]. This effect is especially prominent for education as an indicator of SES and the association is particularly strong among women [61]. The bariatric samples in the US studies included patients with a higher educational level than found in the US general population. It may be that the subjects were drawn from centers in urban settings with well established, research-oriented bariatric surgery programs. In the sample of Rosenberger et al. [28], 73.3% had received education beyond high school and in the sample described by Kalarchian et al. [29], 69.7% had received education beyond high school. In the general population in the US, the rate of education beyond high school was reported to be 53.8% [62] and in an extremely obese general population (BMI≥40), the rate was 46.9% [63]. Similarly, the sample described by Mauri et al. [30], had a higher education level (44.9% with a high school diploma or a university degree) compared to the general population in Italy. On the other hand, in the sample of Mühlhans et al. [31], the education level was low compared to the German general population. Lower SES correlates with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety and mood disorders [15, 38, 39, 44]. As mentioned earlier, the highest prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders were reported in the study of Mühlhans et al., and lower SES might be one of the factors contributing to these rates. Clearly SES needs to be carefully considered in future studies examining bariatric surgery candidates.\n\nSeverity of obesity may also be related to psychopathology in bariatric surgery candidates. Mean BMI of the samples in the five studies ranged from 43.5-52.2 kg/m2. A positive association between severity of obesity and depression was found in one of the population based studies [15], with obese persons having an approximately 1.5-fold higher prevalence of depression than their normal-weight counterparts, and prevalence was found to be highest among persons with severe obesity (BMI≥40). Similar results were found by Kalarchian et al. [29] in bariatric surgery candidates, who found that higher prevalence of current and lifetime Axis I psychopathologies was related to increasing levels of BMI. Contrary to this, Mauri et al. [30] did not find any significant differences among the 3 BMI obesity classes (moderate, severe, very severe) and the prevalences of current and lifetime axis I and II disorders. Higher mean BMI in the sample of Kalarchian et al. [29] (52.2kg/m2) compared with the sample of Mauri et al. [30] (43.5kg/m2) may account for this difference.\n\nThe association of eating disorders in obese patients and Axis I and Axis II psychopathology\n\nObese patients with comorbid BED have significantly higher rates of Axis I and Axis II psychiatric disorders compared to obese patients without BED [65–69]. These findings seem to hold true among bariatric surgery candidates as well. Among the studies reviewed, three [28, 30, 31] examined comorbidity between eating disorders and Axis I psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates. Consistent with previous studies [7, 70, 71], all observed a higher prevalence rate of psychiatric disorders in patients who also met criteria for an eating disorder diagnosis, a finding that appears consistent regardless of sampling and assessment methods. Rosenberger et al. [28] found that patients with eating disorders were significantly more likely to meet criteria for other psychiatric disorders than those without eating disorders (66.7% vs. 26.7%), particularly for anxiety disorders (45.8% vs. 10.7%). In the study of Mühlhans et al. [31], 83.6% of the participants with a lifetime eating disorder diagnosis reported atleast one other lifetime psychiatric disorder while 45.2% of those without a lifetime eating disorder diagnosis exhibited another psychiatric disorder.\n\nRecently, Jones-Corneille et al. [72] also estimated the prevalence rates of psychopathology in bariatric surgery candidates with and without BED. A significantly greater percentage of BED than non-BED participants had a lifetime history of any Axis I disorder (65.9% vs. 39.3%) and any current Axis I disorder (47.7% vs. 16.5%), which was consistent with the results of the studies reviewed here. In general, evidence from several studies with bariatric surgery candidates suggest that prevalence of eating disorder behavior may serve as a marker of variety of other psychiatric disturbances that may have significant scientific and clinical implications [73, 74, 75].\n\nPrevalence of Axis II psychopathology in bariatric surgery candidates\n\nThe studies of Kalarchian et al. [29] and Mauri et al. [31] provided an examination of comorbid personality disorders in addition to other Axis I psychiatric disturbances in bariatric surgery candidates. These studies used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II disorders (SCID II). In the study of Kalarchian et al. [29], 28.5% of the cohort met diagnostic criteria for an Axis II disorder. That 28.5% included 25% of the participants had both an Axis I and II diagnosis, and 3.5% had an Axis II only. The overall prevalence of personality disorders in the sample of Mauri et al. [30] was 19.5%, which was lower than that reported by Kalarchian et al. [29] ( ). Cluster C disorders, including avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders were most common in both of the studies. These findings suggest the possibility that social stigma, discrimination, and fears of negative social evaluation may exacerbate anxious or avoidant traits in extremely obese individuals which might result in higher rates of personality disorders. However, it is also possible that avoidant and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may result in a greater likelihood of engaging in binge-eating behavior [76], but the relationship of personality and eating disorders in bariatric surgery cases is generally not well understood, although Mauri et al. [30] also found a significant association between avoidant personality disorder and eating disorders.\n\nTable 5\n\nAuthorsKalarchian et al. [28]\n\n(2007)\n\n(N=288)Mauri et al.

Morbidly obese individuals are faced with multiple obstacles in their daily living that can have a devastating effect on functional health status [70]. Various scales are available to assess HRQOL and functional impairment. For example, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), a widely used instrument with well-established validity and reliability, measures functional impairment using eight subscales: four pertaining to physical health (physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health) and four related to emotional health (vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health) [70, 79, 80]. Using the SF-36, Fontaine et al. [81, 82] compared the functional impairment of 312 consecutively admitted obese persons and reported substantial decrements among them. Kolotkin et al. have published extensively on the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQOL) and the results indicated that the impact of weight on quality of life generally worsens as the severity of obesity (BMI) increases [83–85].\n\nAmong the studies on bariatric surgery candidates reviewed here, Mitchell et al. [32] used both the SF-36 and IWQOL-Lite to assess functional impairment and HRQOL whereas Kalarchian et al. [29] used SF-36 to assess functional impairment in their samples. Evidence of significant Quality of LIfe impairment on various subscales and the total scores were found in these studies, with more significant impairment seen among women [32]. Both Axis I and Axis II psychopathology were associated with decreased functional health status, with higher BMI further worsening the quality of life in these patients [29]. Mauri et al. [30] analyzed satisfaction with quality of life in relation to Axis I and II psychopathology, BMI and gender using the short-form Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), an instrument originally developed by Endicott et al. [86]. Higher age and the presence of both axis I and II disorders were found to be significantly associated with poorer quality of life whereas, gender or having only having an Axis I or II disorder were not predictive of quality of life scores. Moreover, these authors did not find any association between BMI class and quality of life. Regardless of the instrument used, quality of life impairment is clearly an issue in bariatric surgery candidates, affecting not only emotional health, but also physical health.\n\nStrengths and limitations of the studies on bariatric surgery candidates\n\nThe studies reviewed [28–32] assessed the prevalence rates of psychopathology in bariatric surgery candidates avoiding many key methodological flaws. A notable strength of all the studies is the relatively large sample size, providing better estimates than previous studies with generally smaller samples. Other strengths include the fact that the assessments were conducted across several clinical sites, the use of carefully trained assessors, and the use of Structured Clinical interviews for DSM-IV (SCID) which can provide reliable and valid psychiatric diagnoses [87–90]. Thus, these studies provide valuable information to professionals working with bariatric surgery candidates.\n\nHowever, none of the studies had included a BMI-matched control group, which would have been useful in interpreting the results. Not all the psychopathology studies were independent of the evaluation process for surgery [28, 30], which might have led severely obese candidates to minimize current level of distress and symptom status in order to present themselves as psychologically healthy candidates. Information about medical co-morbidities and medication usage was not provided in most of the studies, which could be important confounding factors. The only study reviewed here that somewhat addressed this was the study of Mitchell et al. [32], who reported that the most common medication class used among their sample in the previous 90 days was antidepressant drugs (40.7%). Another study on bariatric surgery candidates which addressed medication usage was that of Sarwer et al. [5], who reported that more than half of their sample was receiving some form of psychiatric treatment during evaluation, with antidepressants being the most common class of drugs used in these patients. The current use of antidepressants should be considered during evaluation because it raises the possibility that the low current rate of major depression in these subjects could be because they were being successfully treated with medication. The health care systems also differ between countries included in the studies: in Germany, about 0.3% of all citizens are without a health care insurance [91]; in the US, about 16% are without it. It can be assumed that virtually all people without health care insurance do not qualify for bariatric surgery [92]; this might be a confounding factor for the selection of patients in these studies."
