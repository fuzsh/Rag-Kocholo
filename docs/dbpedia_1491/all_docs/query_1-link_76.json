        "text": "Investigating “voluntary” confessions\n\nThis Cold War noir from Columbia has above average production values as well as above average performances and direction. The script is based on Paul Gallico’s novel about a U.S. newsman who investigates confessions received by Communist leaders who wield considerable power behind the iron curtain.\n\nDana Andrews portrays the newspaper man working abroad who wants to find out just how the Communists extort confessions out of citizens, journalists, and members of the diplomatic corps. Of course, there are myriad reasons these men and women fall into the trap; sometimes it is due to carelessness, other times it is due to these individuals’ own overzealousness, thinking they can outwit the Communists. Andrews’ character is certainly not careless, but he is brash and a tad overzealous. He ends up being held hostage and tortured.\n\nOne of the themes of the novel, and the movie, is that a terrible price is paid each time someone is nabbed and coerced into revealing important information about our government. There is a lowering of standards, which can be regarded as a victory for the other side. During the Cold War, Communist victories were the result of methods that broke a man like Andrews’ character. Not only his free will, but his personality and intelligence.\n\nAs Andrews’ boss (George Sanders) and a female reporter (Marta Soren, in her last Hollywood picture) try to obtain his release, we see what Andrews’ character experiences while imprisoned by the other side. He is harassed, manipulated, drugged and brainwashed. Statements he makes on tape are edited to make it seem like he’s a traitor. It’s interesting to see Andrews play this role, a man who goes from cocky and self-assured, to traumatized and shell-shocked by the Hungarian Communists.\n\nEventually his time as a spy ends when Sanders is able to arrange a trade for him with another person (Sandro Giglio) that the Communists want to reclaim. The exchange occurs along a neutral border during the film’s final sequence. These scenes are full of emotional tension and suspense.\n\nWhen Columbia produced this espionage drama in 1952, Hungary was a Soviet satellite, with military police brainwashing occurring behind the iron curtain.The ending is slightly predictable, but we are left with some sobering realizations. After Andrews returns home, he will be in need of medical treatment and psychotherapy; he has undergone a harrowing transformation.\n\nTopBilled:\n\n“I listened to my own story; I brought in my own verdict.”\n\nWe are told Robert Young’s character has violated half a dozen moral laws. But defense counsel says he is not on trial for any moral offenses. Tell that to the production code office. They won’t let him escape unscathed. He will have to develop a conscience and pay the ultimate price for his sins, even if he’s not really a murderer.\n\nYears later Robert Young told talk show host Dick Cavett that this movie was a failure. He said it flopped with audiences because he played an unsympathetic cad. Though I suspect it was fun for him to portray a flawed figure against type.\n\nMaybe he would’ve gotten away with it early in his career during the precode days of Hollywood. But as a more respectable actor in the late 40s, on the threshold of becoming a father who always knew best, he wasn’t going to get away with being so unsavory.\n\nThe extended flashback structure the narrative employs is a noir trope. While our main character is on trial, we flash to events and women who have led him to where he is now: on the witness stand testifying on his own behalf.\n\nThe first main flashback involves his relationship with an attractive woman (Jane Greer) while he’s stuck in a marriage to a passive aggressive society wife (Rita Johnson).\n\nPart of the “fun” is how smooth an operator he is. At the same time, he’s a fool not to realize how his wife (Johnson) is pulling the strings with her money. Interestingly, he dumps the girlfriend (Greer) only to cross paths later with her, when he’s hooked up with a new gal (Susan Hayward).\n\nThe next major flashback involves the relationship between Young’s character and Hayward’s. We learn that after dumping Greer, Young has been whisked out west by Johnson who has set him up in a brokerage firm. Hayward works at the firm and quickly gets involved with him. The film’s theme seems to be about what it takes to keep a man going. In this case, it takes the security of his wife’s finances; a prestigious job; and those enticing flings on the side.\n\nHayward was borrowed by RKO from independent producer Walter Wanger. She is quite good as the more devious girlfriend, a closer match in personality to Young’s character than Greer.\n\nIt is the type of role that would have been done well by Wanger’s wife Joan Bennett, who did these kinds of parts in her sleep with Fritz Lang. Since we know Young’s character is on trial for murder, we realize as the story unspools that he is either being accused of killing his wife or else a girlfriend. Greer is a courtroom spectator, so it’s not her.\n\nAs the last main flashback plays out, we learn how Hayward’s character died in an auto accident. Her body was burned beyond recognition, with Young passing her off as his wife.\n\nIronically, Johnson’s character has died at the same time, at home on their remote ranch, by suicide. In some regards, it’s a slightly convoluted plot line, but most noirs are thoroughly and satisfyingly convoluted.\n\nAfter finishing his testimony, Young’s character waits while the jury deliberates. He is visited one last time in prison by Greer. It brings their relationship full circle. She seems to believe in his innocence at this point. But his own lack of faith in himself seals his fate when he returns to court to hear the verdict read. Whether or not they believe his story, he will still be doomed, if he doesn’t believe in himself.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nThe opening credits are presented among serene images of a Rocky Mountain wilderness (waterfalls and sleepy coniferous trees) before we zoom in to a city hall courtroom and a big discussion of the murder of Verna Carlton. Called to defend himself of the crime, Larry Ballentine (Robert Young, in a surprise role for him at this time pre-SITTING PRETTY and Father Knows Best) relates our saga in flashback.\n\nAt the start of his long story, Larry can’t make up his mind between with his super rich wife Gretta (Rita Johnson) and his mystery lover Janice Bell (Jane Greer) who wants out of The Other Woman role with a plan to leave New York for Montreal and another job.\n\nLarry pleads with Janice that his marriage is over even though he craves the financial security (Gretta being the one helping pull strings for his career). Gretta is no dummy as to what she suspects is going on with her hubbie and baits him with a new house in Beverly Hills at the other end of the country and a different job with an investment firm.\n\nStill in limbo between the two ladies of his life but trying to forget Janice and her attractions, he takes the train to California to try to continue as a one woman man rather than a two woman man but…lo and behold…he meets Verna Carlson (Susan Hayward) working as a sexy secretary at the new firm headed by Gretta’s acquaintance Trenton (Tom Powers).\n\nYes, this movie was made in Production Code dominated 1946 so, of course, everybody keeps their clothes on and only the dialogue hints at what may be going on behind closed doors. Verna has a car ride with Larry to her apartment so they can…hint hint…be alone together (she is sharing rooming expenses with an absent-until-late-in-the-movie “Susan” more like the real Susan Hayward, I am sure, and not Miss Seductive on screen) and discusses with him all of her own personal ambitions in life, including a possible hookup and marriage with Trenton for “the money, honey.”\n\nHe is most intrigued that she is like a mirror image of him: a gold digger eager to make something of her life but with lustful desires that are never completely satisfied.\n\nOh…he also bumps into Janice in California too. She had apparently talked to Gretta in this small world where everybody knows everybody regardless of how secretive the relationships are but does not know Verna when she sees her with Larry in public. However, Gretta knows all about Verna with her many “connections” and decides to keep her Roaming Romeo on a tighter leash by moving them to a ranch setting farther away from Los Angeles.\n\nThis brings us to all of the clean and pristine outdoors scenery that opened this film…and, at first, Gretta and Larry enjoy horseback riding and a more relaxed life. That is, until they decide to build a guest house and need a professional architect in the city to help.\n\nThis, of course, leads Larry back to Verna again in the big city and possible ideas discussed about Larry leaving Gretta…again! Remember that all of this is related to a jury in a courtroom and, by the mid-point of this movie, I am ready for that jury to bash Larry in the head for not making up his mind between all of these women.\n\nAt a bar that is curiously empty of patrons, he and Verna plan a scheme to defraud Gretta with her and Larry’s joint checking account and eventually seeking that all important divorce in Reno. Yet, because Verna resembles Larry more personality-wise than Janice and is more ruthless in carrying things out, there are some expected suspicions and angst between these two as a result. Nonetheless they proceed and enjoy a swim in the mountain lake with no Gretta around.\n\nThen they take a cozy trip back to the city that shockingly involves an accident with an oil fuel carrying truck and Verna’s unexpected demise in an explosion…a demise that he is innocent of. After his recovery in the hospital, he is relieved at first that the police authorities think Verna is actually Gretta and…this is where I struggle a bit with the story details making much sense since it is unbelievable that Larry could get away with fooling the authorities with all of his money forgeries.\n\nAll too conveniently the real Gretta herself is also dead, apparently from an unexpected suicide in a wilderness river after reading a “goodbye” letter from Larry. Again, I am not totally sold here: Gretta has presented herself as a confident woman who, in theory, would not need somebody like Larry to keep her fulfilled.\n\nThis is the 1940s, however, with the slushy orchestration of C. Bakaleinikoff and Roy Webb pounding over a climactic scene of Larry finding Gretta’s drowned corpse near her beloved palomino brooding over his mistress. Larry’s story continues with the jury as he attempts a new life outside the country in South America and the Caribbean without any women…since Janice is nowhere to be found either. That is, until they reunite in Jamaica and she, like everybody else, knows nothing of Verna but thinks Gretta was burned in the car accident.\n\nI don’t know…should I dare spoil the outcome? Oh…you folks might as well watch this over the top melodrama with an ending that must be seen to believe, complete with courtroom open window drop-out. It is a fun and bumpy ride, fairly well directed by Irving Pichel and the kind of melodrama hokum they simply don’t make anymore…well, except for prime-time soaps of the 1980s. The title certainly fits Larry’s situation. Not that we should always trust our own beliefs.\n\nRaucous farce about the sanctity of marriage\n\nIt’s not too difficult to see why the production code office had some qualms about the script for this very funny comedy from Republic Pictures. The main storyline involves a somewhat flippant attitude about the sanctity of marriage, since a young gal (Patricia Farr) goes out one evening and comes back home married to an older man (Neil Hamilton) she never met before. But that’s not all; she’s already married to a con artist (Joseph Schildkraut).\n\nWorried that the young gal will go to jail for bigamy, her older sis (Sally Eilers) decides to take her place. Not exactly sure how that would stop Hamilton from claiming he was duped into marriage by a bigamous woman, but it gives Eilers a chance to infiltrate his wealthy estate and get to know his bratty kids (Marcia Mae Jones and George Ernest). The kids don’t want daddy married again, but Eilers won’t go away quietly. She takes the mother part of stepmother to heart and decides to give the kids a proper upbringing, though she is not technically married to their father.\n\nNot only do we have a farce about marriage, we also have a farce about motherhood and childrearing. The actors play it broadly, and they all get a lot of mileage out of the zany material. I suppose you could call it a screwball comedy, though it’s not really about bizarre people; it’s about a bizarre set of circumstances that otherwise respectable people are mixed up in before things become normal.\n\nEilers is having a field day playing off Hamilton and the kids, as a woman who has finally found her calling in life. Though it really is Schildkraut, who enters into a strange “business” arrangement with the kids to help them remove Eilers from the home, who gets the best lines. In case Schildkraut becomes too much of a cad, we learn he has some decency in him. Since he still has feelings for Eilers’ kid sister, he does the right thing in the end by cutting Eilers a break so she can remain at the manse in the role she’s become accustomed to living.\n\nAs the film started to wrap up, I did wonder if the writers would be able to undo the bigamy part of the narrative in order to provide a morally acceptable happy ending. And to my surprise, the writers have done that, in a rather clever way. It turns out that Schildkraut has been declared legally insane, meaning the younger sister’s marriage to him was invalid, and she was legally wed to Hamilton.\n\nThough she never really lived under Hamilton’s room as his wife, since her sister took on that role, she is able to successfully get a divorce. This clears the path for her to reunite with Schildkraut (who knows why, but love is strange), which then enables Eilers to marry Hamilton and be a real mom to his kids who are no longer the monsters they were.\n\nKiller counts on a prevailing prejudice against the mentally ill\n\nTHE OCTOBER MAN is a good British film noir starring John Mills, in which we have a main character who is said to love life. He goes through a terrible ordeal and then experiences post-traumatic stress. It affects the amount of confidence he has in himself, and his ability to rebuild his life, which won’t be the same as it was before.\n\nHe’s involved in a terrible bus crash, and it sets in motion a series of events that nearly overtake him. Mills plays this man continually on the brink of suicide. His troubled psyche is shown in how he reacts to screeching train whistles and a tied handkerchief, which may be a symbol of his inner torment.\n\nThe film shares themes with RANDOM HARVEST because of the mental block that Mills’ character suffers after the accident. Also, it’s a bit similar to THE BLUE DAHLIA because of the head injury trauma that’s depicted. In THE BLUE DAHLIA, William Bendix plays a returning serviceman who has experienced brain damage in battle. We don’t quite get that in THE OCTOBER MAN with Mills’ character, though it might be suggested that his condition is similar to men who’ve just come back from the war.\n\nMills gives an honest performance; a very understated and graceful performance. The way he conveys the barely suppressed hysteria of the main character is outstanding.\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Mills was successful in avoiding being typecast in his motion picture assignments. With THE OCTOBER MAN, he’s channeling a wounded hero in his portrayal– physical recovery and mental recovery, after a traumatic event. The bus crash stands in for the disaster and fatalities that men saw first-hand in the war; though his character is a civilian, and he’s a chemist. He carries this wounding with him throughout the rest of the story, until the very end.\n\nWe see him lose everything in the beginning. Then he gradually rebuilds his life. Settling into a room at a hotel, he begins a new job, then starts meeting new people. Eventually, we see him falling in love, regaining his confidence. Then it’s all in jeopardy again when a murder occurs.\n\nI found Joan Greenwood to be most effective as the love interest. She doesn’t have oodles of screen time, but her role is essential, especially when it comes time for the plot’s denouement.\n\nMeanwhile, we have Edward Chapman in the role of another hotel resident. He is revealed as the killer two-thirds of the way into the drama, which isn’t too surprising. This sets up a final sequence with Mills hurrying off to a train station to stop Chapman and prove his own innocence.\n\nThere’s a very tense scene where Mills confronts Chapman, in order to out him as the killer. This is where we see how twisted Chapman’s character is. He’s defiant, and he thinks he will get away with murder. He is counting on a prevailing prejudice against the mentally ill to trap Mills’ character and ensure that Mills is blamed. I love how deranged and bold Chapman plays it is during this confrontation, and how nihilistic it is for Mills’ character. Mills will take the fall for the killing, unless he fights back and does something. Truly excellent acting from both these men.\n\nOf course the mistake Chapman’s character makes is he should have gone off to Glasgow, long enough for Mills to be arrested. Then he could have made his way to Lisbon from Glasgow. The one thing where I think the plot stretches credibility is that the police wait a rather long time before they decide Mills is their man and go to arrest him. I don’t think we’re supposed to feel the police are exactly incompetent. But they are being thorough, and they take their sweet time.\n\nPerhaps the story needs to have the police act slowly, so that Mills is free to confront Chapman and figure out where he’s going. But I felt the police would have been more aggressive. Also not once does Mills’ character even consider finding an attorney to consult with, because he’s more interested in either going back to the hospital for treatment, or else killing himself…before he develops the resolve to nab the true culprit.\n\nUltimately, Mills does become self-empowered enough to prevail. And after the main crisis has been resolved, we know that he will end up with Greenwood. She’s someone who has supported him and has been there for him through it all.\n\nLone star rangers\n\nThe lead role in this durable outdoor picture from Paramount was intended for Gary Cooper. But before the cameras rolled, studio execs decided he was making too many outdoor action yarns, so at the last minute they pulled him off this project and gave the role to fellow contract player Fred MacMurray. One wonders how many other times MacMurray got Cooper’s “leftovers.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that this was MacMurray’s first western film. MacMurray himself was the first to admit he didn’t exactly feel at ease on a horse. Typically, he stuck with romantic stories, comedies or crime flicks. However, he would return to western fare full-time in the 1950s when the genre was at its peak, to keep the momentum of his big screen career going before he transitioned to a weekly television series in the early 1960s.\n\nCostarring with MacMurray as two of the other rangers in the story are Jack Oakie and Lloyd Nolan. Like MacMurray, Oakie seldom ventured into this genre, sticking more with comedies that suited his unique brand of shtick and broad acting style.\n\nAs for Nolan, he was being assigned good supporting roles in ‘A’ pictures, though he also began doing leads in ‘B’ pics. Since MacMurray’s inherited Cooper’s role, he is playing the more heroic character. Oakie is along as a trusty sidekick, while Nolan gets to be the bad guy outlaw that MacMurray and Oakie must track down.\n\nInterestingly, all three are pals and on the wrong side of the law in the beginning, before MacMurray and Oakie shape up. They sign up to become respectable Texas Rangers, while Nolan continues a life of crime. During the course of the story, MacMurray falls for a sweet girl (Jean Parker).\n\nIn real life the Texas Rangers first gained prominence as a law enforcement agency in the 1830s. After the Civil War, the Rangers were temporarily disbanded; then re-formed and are still active law enforcers today. When Paramount made this film, a book had just been published by Walter Webb celebrating the hundred-year exploits of the Rangers.\n\nThe film was directed by King Vidor on location in Texas and parts of New Mexico. It was Vidor’s first outdoor western since 1930’s BILLY THE KID. He wouldn’t make another such picture until 1946’s DUEL IN THE SUN— that one was filmed in Arizona. Years later, THE TEXAS RANGERS was included as part of a retrospective of Vidor’s work.\n\nIn 1940 Paramount produced a sequel, TEXAS RANGERS RIDE AGAIN which featured a different cast since Oakie’s character is killed off, and Nolan had moved over to making Michael Shayne detective dramas at 20th Century Fox. MacMurray was in the process of being loaned to Warner Brothers for an aviation story with Errol Flynn. The sequel had lesser known stars and a smaller budget. It was helmed by director James Hogan who was known more for his ‘B’ fare.\n\nLater in the decade the studio decided to go back to the original story and remake it as STREETS OF LAREDO in 1949. In the remake William Holden would be cast as the hero; MacDonald Carey would play the villain; Mona Freeman was the female love interest; and William Bendix would take over for Oakie.\n\nCall now\n\nNorthside 777 is a number, that if you call it, you can provide useful information to a hardworking scrubwoman (Kasia Orzazewski) who is eager to spring her son (Richard Conte) from prison. If you call now, you will receive a beautiful sum of five thousand dollars, and you will have the knowledge that you helped do some good in the world. Unless Conte is actually guilty and belongs behind bars.\n\nJames Stewart is cast in the lead role as a reporter whose boss (Lee J. Cobb) sees the woman’s ad in the paper and asks him to do a story on it. One cannot really call Stewart a crusading reporter, since he seems rather reluctant to get involved.\n\nWhen he first meets the scrubwoman and then later her ex-daughter-in-law (Joanne De Bergh) he is not exactly convinced that Conte was framed in the killing of a Chicago police officer back in 1932. But because this is a human interest story, he goes to work on it.\n\nOf course, as he starts digging into the case, he becomes immersed in the facts. And gradually, he does start believing in Conte’s innocence.\n\nWhile this is constructed as a semi-documentary noir, based on a true story, I felt some of it seemed rather contrived in spots. Why didn’t anyone look into the case sooner? After all, it was said that Conte’s mother had posted an earlier ad offering three grand, which is not exactly chicken feed.\n\nAlso, when Stewart starts looking into things, we don’t see him looking over the trial transcripts or talking to the cops or D.A. who put Conte in prison. No, instead, we must have Stewart playing hero detective, tracking down possible witnesses and interviewing the parties directly involved, including Conte himself. Oh, and that brings me to something else: Conte looks like the healthiest most well-fed inmate ever shown on screen. I guess incarceration for over a decade has agreed with him.\n\nIt might have worked better if Conte’s character couldn’t remember all the details on the day that the murder took place, if maybe he had been on a drinking binge; or had been knocked out in an alley around the time the crime occurred, leading us to wonder if maybe he really was guilty and if justice had been doled out correctly. In fact, I think it would have given the story a melancholy irony if the mother was wrong in maintaining her son’s so-called innocence, and that the ex-wife was correct in divorcing Conte.\n\nAs it is, there is no real ambiguity or suspense; the story is heavily slanted in Conte’s favor. And more than that, it is heavily slanted in favor of Stewart playing hero and bringing about justice when nobody else seemed to care.\n\nThe studio’s slick production values and the film’s artistic attempts to present the story in dark tones is ultimately undermined by the production code, that the shining light of justice has to wash out all the darkness in the end. Nobody in this film is ever going to call Southside 666.\n\n“I’m sick of being royalty, I want to be a person.”\n\nThe main theme conveyed in RKO’s adaptation of Robert Sherwood’s play ‘The Queen’s Husband’ is that monarchs can have human qualities. But most humans will never have the qualities to be monarchs. It’s a cheeky way to look at the extraordinary aspects of royal life when the subjects in a palace may wish to be quite ordinary. In this story, a king and a queen do not always have real freedom; instead, they have noble duties and obligations.\n\nThe king’s daughter, a lovely princess played by young Mary Astor, is told in no uncertain terms by her domineering mother (Nance O’Neil) that her duty is to enter into an arranged marriage. The proposed union is with a man (Hugh Trevor) that Astor’s character vehemently dislikes, but a splashy wedding will help solidify power for their fictional European nation among other great European countries. Astor might have gone along with the plan, if she did not already love another man— her father’s handsome secretary (Anthony Bushell).\n\nA considerable part of the story’s charm is that the king (Lowell Sherman, who also directed this film adaptation) is aware of his daughter’s secret romance and wants to help Astor and Bushell find their happy-ever-after. But before that can happen, the king must outfox a military general keen on becoming a dictator (Robert Warwick in delicious scene stealing mode); as well as find a solution involving a radical revolutionary (J. Carrol Naish) and a political group wanting to turn the land into a republic with voting rights for the common masses.\n\nOne thing I enjoyed about the story was the sincere sometimes droll and perfectly understated way that Sherman portrays the king. As lead actor and director, he certainly could have amped up his performance as a henpecked ruler; but he wisely refrains from going in that direction. As a result, he renders a most genuine and tender portrait of a king who only wants his daughter to be happy, his fellow countrymen to be happy; and his wife to realize her true place alongside him on the throne.\n\nNance O’Neil’s performance as the overbearing queen is one of the focal points of THE ROYAL BED. O’Neil has a very commanding theatrical performance style. And yes, she does go a bit “big” in how she plays her role; but since this is a comedy, even her occasional overacting adds to the fun. Sherman would direct and costar with O’Neil again in another picture a few years later.\n\nRKO spent a good deal of money transferring Sherwood’s Broadway hit to the screen. It’s a talkie precode meant for an intelligent audience. Every so often the story opens up to include exterior scenes, such as a sequence where the queen is going off to America to raise money; as well as later scenes when the revolution is taking place just outside the palace.\n\nHowever, most of the action does take place inside the king’s inner sanctum. But the performances are so good and so engaging that you hardly notice the stagier aspects of the production."
