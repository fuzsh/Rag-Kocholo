Sidebar: For our fellow super SvenPals who have not seen ”Fiend Without A Face” (1958); on the advice of Sven’s recent advertisement, we advise our fellow super SvenPals not to any spoilers for the title creature in the film, you will have to see the entire title creature for yourself during Sven’s big broadcast premiere this Sven Sat.!\n\nThe legendary Berwyn/Chicago-based sci-fi/creature film host will present his big broadcast premiere of “Fiend Without A Face” (1958), this Sat.; May 15 at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central on Me-TV.\n\nThe 1958 classic sci-fi/creature masterpiece production was directed by veteran British cinematographer/film and television director Arthur Crabtree*. Some of Crabtree’s* best known productions throughout his film and television career include directing series episodes of the classic mammoth British television mystery masterpiece series with Boris Karloff, “Colonel March of Scotland Yard” (Crabtree worked on the series from 1955-56, “Colonel March of Scotland Yard” was syndicated for local television stations in the United States by Official Films); according to additional details from IMDB. The same year that he worked on his classic mammoth sci-fi/creature masterpiece feature of “Fiend Without a Face” (1958) Crabtree also worked on 12 episodes of the classic Columbia Pictures/Screen Gems syndicated television masterpiece adaptation of Sir Walter Scott’s novel of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, “Ivanhoe” in 1958 with young Roger Moore in the title role. One year after “Fiend Without A Face,” Crabtree directed the classic mammoth British “Hypnovista” horror-mystery masterpiece with young Michael Gough, “Horrors of the Black Museum” (1959, released theatrically in Great Britain by Nat Cohen and Stuart Levy; released in the United States by Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson’s distribution firm, American-International Pictures).\n\nVeteran producer/distributor Richard Gordon served as executive producer of Crabtree’s* production of “Fiend Without a Face” (1958). Gordon later served as executive producer of Lindsay Shonteff’s cult classic thriller feature masterpiece production of “Devil Doll” (1964) with Bryant Haliday, Yvonne Romain, William Sylvester and the vocal stylings of Sadie Corre. Veteran producer John Croydon also produced the 1958 Gordon-Crabtree* production of “Fiend Without a Face.” Croydon later served as the producer Ian Curteis’s classic sci-fi/horror masterpiece production with Mary Peach and Norman Wooland, “The Projected Man” (1966, released in the United States by Universal Studios in 1967).

Hargreaves received credit under the pseudonym of Lance Z. Hargreaves for the 1964 production of “Devil Doll”).\n\nKinnoch/Barclay previously produced Wolf Rilla’s classic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) sci-fi/horror/thriller masterpiece with George Sanders, Barbara Shelley, Michael Gwynn and Martin Stephens; “Village of the Damned” (1960, adapted from John Wyndham/John Harris’ novel, “The Midwich Cuckoos;” Kinnoch/Barclay co-wrote the screenplay adaptation of “Village of the Damned” with veteran screenwriter Stirling Silliphant). Charles F. Vetter previously produced Robert Day’s classic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) British sci-fi masterpiece production of “First Man Into Space” (1959, with Marshall Thompson, Marla Landi and Bill Edwards).\n\nThe screenplay for the Gordon/Crabtree* cult classic sci-fi/creature masterpiece production of “Fiend Without a Face” (1958) was written by veteran screenwriter Herbert J. Leder. Leder’s screenplay was adapted from an original story by veteran author Amelia Reynolds Long. Long’s original story was titled “The Thought Monster.”\n\n“Fiend Without a Face” (1958) was released theatrically throughout Great Britain via Eros Films Ltd., the company was founded by Phil and Sid Hyams; according to IMDB. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) handled the North American theatrical distribution/releasing rights to “Fiend Without a Face.” The theatrical re-issue, television syndication and home entertainment licensing rights to “Fiend Without a Face” (1958) would later revert to Richard Gordon’s Gordon Films, Inc. (under the estate of Richard Gordon since Gordon’s death in 2011); according to veteran film distributor Kit Parker’s retrospective on veteran film producer Gordon.\n\nWho was in the Richard Gordon-Arthur Crabtree* classic sci-fi/horror masterpiece production of “Fiend Without a Face” (1958)?\n\nThe players who appeared in the Richard Gordon-Arthur Crabtree* classic sci-fi/horror masterpiece production of “Fiend Without a Face” were Marshall Thompson (as Maj. Cummings), Kim Parker (as Barbara Griselle), Kynaston Reeves (as Prof. R.E. Walgate), Stanley Maxted (as Col. Butler), Terence “Terry” Kilburn (as Capt. Al Chester), James Dyrenforth (as the Mayor), Robert MacKenzie (as Constable Gibbons), Peter Madden (as Dr. Bradley), Gil Winfield (as Dr. Warren), Michael Balfour (as Sgt. Kasper), Lala Lloyd (as Amelia Adams), Shane Cordell (as a Nurse), Launce Maraschal (as Melville), E. Kerrigan Prescott (as an Atomic Engineer) and R. Meadows White (as Ben Adams).\n\nMarshall Thompson previously appeared in the role of Tom Markel in Francis D. Lyon’s classic Universal Studios creature fantasy/thriller masterpiece with Faith Domergue, Richard Long, Kathleen Hughes, David Janssen (later of TV’s “The Fugitive” and “Harry O” fame), Jack Kelly and Olan Soule; “Cult of the Cobra” (1955). The same year that he appeared in “Fiend Without a Face,” Thompson played the role of Col. Edward Carruthers in Edward L. Cahn’s classic United Artists sci-fi creature masterpiece with Shirley Patterson, Kim Spalding, Richard Benedict and Ray Corrigan; “It! The Terror Beyond Space” (1958). Two years before appearing in “Fiend Without a Face,” Kim Parker previously appeared in the role of one of the fire maidens in Cy Roth’s cult classic sci-fi masterpiece with Maya Koumani, Norma Arnould, Sylvia Burrows, Marcella Georgius, Corinne Gray, Richard Walter, Susan Shaw and Anthony Dexter; “Fire Maidens of Outer Space” (1956).

The veteran director had never worked on a monster feature film production in his career. Crabtree did not get along well with Richard Gordon, John Croydon, Ronald Kinnoch and Charles F. Vetter and left the production for several days in protest of the producers. During Crabtree’s* absence for “Fiend Without a Face,” it was reported that actor Marshall Thompson directed some of the early scenes in the production.\n\n“Fiend Without a Face:” Originally released as an MGM/Richard Gordon double-feature production in the United States plus promotional tie-ins\n\nThe Richard Gordon-Arthur Crabtree* classic sci-fi creature masterpiece production of “Fiend Without a Face” was released in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) as a double-feature presentation with another classic horror-thriller masterpiece feature that was produced by Gordon. According to an original 1958 MGM exhibitors’ advertisement for the MGM/Richard Gordon double-feature presentation for participating theaters throughout the United States, “Fiend Without a Face” was paired with the Richard Gordon-Robert Day classic mystery/horror masterpiece production of “The Haunted Strangler” (1958) with silver screen horror legend Boris Karloff, along with Elizabeth Allan, Anthony Dawson, Jean Kent, Vera Day, Tim Turner, Diane Aubrey, Dorothy Gordon and Leslie Perrins.\n\nParticipating theaters in the United States were given options to play the two aforementioned 1958 Richard Gordon features in the MGM release as a double-feature program or choosing one individual film (preferring to show only “Fiend Without a Face” or “The Haunted Strangler”); according to additional details from the 1958 MGM exhibitors’ advertisement. MGM also encouraged participating theaters for the double-feature or individual Richard Gordon theatrical film programs to promote the Richard Gordon productions with promotional tie-in “gimmicks” to interest theatergoers from coast-to-coast. According to a segment from a rare 1958 MGM exhibitors’ manual that was unearthed on the blog site From Zombo’s Closet, one of the tie-in gimmicks for “Fiend Without a Face” included a “monster” parade full of theater workers and local actors to dress up as their favorite monster and/or creatures in a mock parade for the local theater’s theatrical screening of the 1958 Gordon productions under MGM release.\n\nIt was also reported that MGM provided a record of eerie sound effects to participating theaters to play in their lobby displays or custom marquee displays to promote the screening of the Gordon features of “Fiend Without a Face” and/or “The Haunted Strangler.” According to the original 1958 MGM exhibitors’ promotional manual, the aforementioned “eerie” source sound effects disc for theaters was not compiled from MGM’s own library of source sound effect recordings, but from pioneering background music and sound effects company Thomas J. Valentino, Inc. Some of the other tie-in gimmicks for the MGM/Gordon theatrical screenings of “Fiend Without a Face” and “The Haunted Strangler” included a customized truck with posters and lobby cards promoting “Fiend Without a Face” and/or “The Haunted Strangler” for participating theaters, a “Fiend” horror creature /monster “mask” contest was used for Sat. morning matinee screenings of “Fiend Without a Face;” where theaters were encouraged to team up with local department stores and/or toy stores for prizes for the best “Fiend” mask creation based on audience applause. Mock “first aid” lobbies were set up in participating theaters from coast-to-coast for nervous patrons during original theatrical screenings of “Fiend Without a Face” and/or “The Haunted Strangler.”\n\nBe sure to watch/record Svengoolie’s big broadcast premiere of “Fiend Without a Face” (1958); this Sat. on Me-TV!\n\nWith Marshall Thompson.
