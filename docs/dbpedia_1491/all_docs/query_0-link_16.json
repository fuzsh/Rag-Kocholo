Condition: Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good plus. Norman Mansbridge (illustrator). 64pp; orange boards printed red & black, matching yellow jacket (unpriced & unclipped); 237 x 160 x 10 mm. First Canadian edition (originally 1939: Muller, London), with Foreword dated December 1939; printed in Toronto by T.H. Best. Initially aired by the BBC in a slightly sanitized version (6 October 1939), ostensibly to leaven the spirits of the British public following the declaration of war (3 September; in Canada, it took another week, the country's first ever autonomous declaration, since gaining legislative independence, 1931). Includes a typographically appropriate adaptation of 'the mouse's tale' to the \"tale of a Jewish mouse\". With 14 illustrations by cartoonist Norman Mansbridge (4 full-page), his first book. Immensely popular in Britain, the spoof went through five printings, while a single printrun appears to have sufficed in Canada. Curiously, Max Kester (1901-91), co-writer & British counterpart to transplanted American actor & songwriter, James Dyrenforth (1895-1973), was in fact the son of journalist & artist, James Arthur Dodgson of Leeds (1872 -19??).

Together with an original unclipped dust jacket with a 3/6 net price. The boards have been well protected by the dust jacket and are clean and bright with only a little shelf wear to the bottom edge and a bruise to the top of the spine and top fore edge corner of the front board. Internally, there is a gift inscription to the front free endpaper and light spotting to the prelims and last couple of pages. The dust jacket is very good considering its age, having a 2cm closed tear and a 1.5 cm right angled tear extending along the top edge of the rear board. There is some rubbing to the shoulders and spine tips and a little creasing along the top edge mainly by the tear. A really nice copy of this Alice in Wonderland parody produced at the beginning of World War II which includes caricatures of Hitler, Chamberlain and Stalin. The dust jacket is now in a protective removable cover (not shown in the images).
