The swap file is created by the editor vim when you start editing a file; it essentially is a backup file in case the editor crashes.

Now, if the editor launches and finds a swap file, it will usually prompt you to decide what to do, whether to restore the previous editor session or to discard those changes.

If you donâ€™t care about that, you can just delete the swap file first before launching the editor:

rm .git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp

This should remove the swap file, so the next time the editor launches, you no longer get that message and can just work as usual.
