Changed

Edit : Iâve left this review previously and their team reassured me that they are working on a quality update for the swapping filter but after reading the recent reviews of people who left the same reviews and received the same response about two months ago iâm starting to get a little scared that this may not be true.

This app was amazing a month ago it was 100% perfect until recently it updated and iâve noticed the changing filter isnât as strong anymore . It used to change your face shape a bit more and show your features more strongly . I miss when the filter was stronger. I loved the old version ð­ but itâs still a pretty solid app I really hope you guys can fix it back to how it was if thatâs possible. i thought i was wrong until i saw someone else say that the swapping filters have been watered down. I would really really love for this app to go back to how it was when the swapping would show more of your own features including face shape, eyebrows, eyes, lips, etc than the ones on the face youâre swapping with. I compared some of my swapped faces from july and now and back in july the features were so much stronger. I will most definitely subscribe once you guys fix this situation i love this app and i wish to have it back to how it wasâ¦ Pls fix it or let me know if it can be fixed so i can resubscribe again once it is fixed.

Ruined app

Save your apologies and âcompassionateâ replies. Just like most things, once the popularity and growth are there, in steps strategic ways to increase revenue. In this case, forgetting what placed you on the map to begin with. Youâve removed movie content, voice feature, and other popular featuresâ¦not to mention the technical glitches when scrolling through your app. Instead, dissected and redistributed some of these features (I.e. Revive), solely to increase revenue streams. For those who use the app without paying, itâs completely throttled by adds, which more or less forces one to purchase PRO. Of course you donât stop there though, because even as a PRO member, you must purchase tokens. Unreal. And having the ability t upload your own video is certainly an appeal and can be leveraged in supporting the upgrade, but not when you require additional purchases in top of that. However, thatâs an additional feature, and shouldnât justify removing all the preexisting inventory of content, specifically well known movie bitsâ¦but hey, at least you replaced with useless, generic GIFS and crap AI. It certainly is one thing to creatively increase revenue, but not by taking away what got you here in the first place. This greed will be your downfall for sure. Whoever your analyst and strategist are, I hope this was deliberate if so, because this âtake the money and runâ exit strategy!
