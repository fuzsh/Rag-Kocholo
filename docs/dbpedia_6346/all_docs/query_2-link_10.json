        "text": "New details about the plot for the much-awaited Freaky Friday 2 movie, have been revealed.\n\nThe 2003 film starring Lindsay Lohan as teenager Anna Coleman and her mother Tess, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, became a cultural phenomenon and fans have been asking for a sequel for years. The story follows the pair as they swap bodies and are forced to live each other’s lives.\n\nOn Friday (29 March) Late Night director Nish Ganatra was announced as the new movie’s filmmaker according to The Hollywood Reporter, hours after Curtis and Lohan shared a picture together on Instagram.\n\nNew details now reveal that the potential plot of the movie centres a four-body swap between Anna, her mother Tess and two teenage girls.\n\nAudition sides (including an eight-page script) seen by Entertainment Weekly appear to reveal that Anna is now a single mother engaged to British restauranteur, Eric Davis. She has a 14-year-old daughter called Harper, while Eric has a 14-year-old daughter from a previous relationship called, Lily.\n\nAccording to the documents, Lily and Harper do “not see eye to eye”.\n\nIt comes after Ganatra shared an open casting call to her Instagram stories, in a bid to fill the role of Anna’s daughter Harper in the movie.\n\nThe 14-year-old is described as “a tomboy with a sharp sense of humour” who’s “in a bit of a mood these days because her long-time single mom is set to marry British restaurateur Eric Davis,” according to the description.\n\nThe sides viewed by EW were sent to the prospective stars and state “this is a ‘body swap’ scene,” and that “Harper should channel ‘Anna’ (Lindsay Lohan) and Lily should channel ‘Tess’ (Jamie Lee Curtis).”\n\nThe pair have gone on to star in other movies following the success of Freaky Friday. Curtis won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in Everything Everywhere All At Once, while Lohan went on to make another iconic movie in 2004, Mean Girls, and recently starred in the Netflix film Irish Wish.\n\nAdditional details shared in the casting call include a note stating that Harper “would like to see things go her way and use her intelligence to stop this marriage from ever happening,” stressing that the performance “should be grounded, emotional, and as natural as possible.”\n\nAudtion scenes include body-swapped Harper and Lily (who are really Anna and Tess) participate in a beach cleanup as part of school detention as Tess shares her concerns about her daughter moving away to be in London with her husband. Other scenes include the pair enjoying glasses of apple juice from wine glasses as they mull over their youth in the kitchen.\n\nEW could not confirm that the sides were part of the official script.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Disney for comment."
