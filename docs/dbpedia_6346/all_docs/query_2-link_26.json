        "text": "There is no longer a default swap partition, but Ubuntu will use it. By default Ubuntu now uses swapfile as its easier to manage (no partition changes are required to increase/decrease size)\n\nI'll still use swap partitions on most of my machines, but my systems are mostly dual boot & thus I can have multiple systems share the same swap partition thus saving my disk space... Also as I'm involved with QA, many installed systems are often being re-installed and any shared swapfile on another systems' drive just complicates matters (ie. sharing is still possible even with swapfiles)\n\nSwap files vs Swap partitions just give us another option, and we can use whichever will work best for our system, and most importantly our own usage.\n\nFYI: I've QA-tested & all releases up to current mantic (what will be 23.10 on release) can still use either. You can even use both if you wish (adding swapfile if you need extra swap for some tasks, though I suspect there are costs with doing this in efficiency - but it works)\n\nI've been reading about the thing with the swap Partition, and this is what I concluded:\n\nNowadays, at least in recent Ubuntu versions, there's not need to create a swap partition if you aren't going to use the Hibernation Mode. As you mentioned, if you don't create a swap partition, Ubuntu will use a swap file that will works (as far I know) just like a swap partition.\n\nAnyway you can create it if you want, there won't be any problem, or if you have it and want to delete it, there won't be problem neither. If you go out of RAM, Ubuntu will use the swap file. I also read that you can even use Hibernation Mode with that swap file if you do the correct configs.\n\nIf you want to read about this in Ubuntu official documentation, you can do it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#Should_I_reinstall_with_more_swap.3F there is even a paragraph where explains that since the 2.6 Linux Kernel a swap file is as fast as a swap partition."
