        "text": "There's a lot of talk about the rise in selfie filters. The problem with these new digital tricks is that they can make selfies look better, but like many technological advancements, it's also created a whole new set of problems. People photoshopping their heads onto the faces and bodies of celebrities or simply swapping their own head for whatever movie star they want to be. Now you can do this easily with our FaceMagic App: download on iOS and Android.\n\n\"If you want to look like the woman from Bridesmaids then you can do that,\" says Brian Silverman, the Director of Creative Development at HQ, a photo editing app. \"It's replaced standing in front of a mirror and taking a selfie with your phone. I also think people are more willing to take credit for things than before because they don't have to be as self-critical.\n\nUnlike photo-editing apps, FaceMagic allows you to upload any image, add a face and change it to be someone else. That person can be a celebrity, a friend or just your imagination. The app will take its cues from the facial features of that person and blend it into your own.\n\nHow easy is it to use our App:\n\nTo a certain extent, this has always been possible with Photoshop. However, FaceMagic doesn't require you to be a photo-editing whizz and its interface is simple enough that anybody can use it.\n\nThe app's design is clean and crisp. It's very easy to add photos or the app will do it for you by pulling in the Facebook photos of people in your contacts book.\n\nNothing better than thinking about Nicholas Cage as Yoda. His face I would like to take.\n\nPerfect for any holiday or birthday present\n\nMovie poster? Sounds dreamy! If you've ever fantasized of being on the silver screen, this innovative app is for you.\n\nSimply take a photo of yourself or any image that appeals to you, then resize it to the size of a movie poster with your fingers. Voilà! It's now ready to share with others.\n\nWhen you make your own movie poster, there are a few things to keep in mind. First is that you need to be sure that it is a true reflection of the art you’ve created. It’s also a good idea to ensure it is completely unique. Thanks to the wide range of customization options available with Creative Cloud Express, you can describe the tone and content of your movie according to what will resonate with your target audience or platform.\n\nEvery day, we all see a lot of photos on Instagram. Whether from family, friends, or your favorite celebrities—we’re always looking for the perfect selfie. We’ve created an app that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically remove the background of your photo; it works by moving and resizing it to the desired look. With this process, you never have to worry about over saturating the colors or creating a “backgroundless” look that doesn't feel true to you.\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe app uses artificial intelligence to find the background you're viewing and removes it. We also automatically move the photo so that your face is in the center of the image and we fill any spaces with a white background.\n\nComposition: We built this app to be simple and easy to use. There are 3 main steps in composing your shot: select an existing photo, add text, and take your picture or videos.\n\nColor: The color is adjusted automatically to look more natural in the photo. Once you've taken your shot, the white background fills in automatically using machine learning to maximize the contrast between your face and the background."
