        "text": "1979 American film\n\nThe SwapDirected byJordan Leondopoulos (credited as John Shade)Written byJohn C. Broderick (screenplay)Produced byChristopher C. DeweyStarringRobert De NiroCinematography√Ålex Phillips Jr.Music byBill Conti\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed byCannon Films\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n83 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish\n\nThe Swap is a 1979 American neo noir crime film directed by Jordan Leondopoulos. Parts of the film are edited from the 1969 film Sam's Song, also directed by Leondopoulos.[1] The rest consists of extensive reshootings,[2] the different part being tied together by the use of a voice over.[3]\n\nThe film is also known as Line of Fire (American video title).[4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nSam Nicoletti works in his office where he is a film editor,[N 1] little knowing there is an intruder. After talking on the phone, Sam is knocked out from behind by the intruder.\n\nAfter the credits the film cuts to ten years later. Sam's brother Vito is being released from prison for an unspecified crime. He sets out to find out who killed Sam and why. He goes to visit Erica Moore, a publisher, who he knows spent time with Sam in his last days. She tells him how her husband had an affair with Carole, a girl Sam was dating, and ended up marrying Carole. In flashbacks we learn more about a weekend that Sam spent with rich friends Warren and Mickey.\n\nFrom a caretaker in the cemetery where Sam is buried, Vito learns that a girl has been visiting Sam's grave for the last ten years. He confronts her when she visits, but she drives off. Tracing her licence plate, he traces her to her home, where he reveals he is Sam's brother. Vivian reveals that she was in Sam's pornographic films. Vito is surprised as he was unaware of Sam's involvement in that business.\n\nFurther complexities lead Vito to Warren and his wife, who both have reason to prevent the porno film seeing the light of day. Vito gets his hands on the reel of film and has it processed, while Vivian transports him around. Warren's wife seduces Vito at his hotel but 'slips him a mickey', later kidnapping him at gunpoint. But Vito grabs her, turns the gun on her and she is killed.\n\nVito himself is wounded but goes to the film processing place where with Vivian he watches the porno film and sees that Warren was in it. Vivian drives him to Warren's where he shoots Warren's houseboy, and finds Warren in the bathtub. Warren pleads for his life but Vito shoots him.\n\nVivian drives Vito away. She thinks they can make it to the mountains where she can get him a doctor, but he is clearly dying. She tells him that she loves him.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert De Niro as Sam Nicoletti\n\nJennifer Warren as Erica Moore\n\nJarred Mickey as Andrew Moore (as Jerry Micky)\n\nTerrayne Crawford as Carole Moore\n\nMartin J.
