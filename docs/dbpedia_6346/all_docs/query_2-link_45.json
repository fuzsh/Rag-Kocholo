        "text": "Disney Channel Original Movies or DCOM (formerly known as \"Zoog Disney Channel Movie\"[citation needed]) is any movie that is produced under the Disney Channel canon. They have been made at a rate of at least once a year since 1983. The first Disney Channel Original Movie was the movie Tiger Town.\n\nThis is a list of movies produced for the U.S. cable channel Disney Channel. Such movies are currently called Disney Original Movies, as of March 2023. They were previously known as Disney Channel Premiere Films since October 1983 and Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM) from October 1997 to September 2022.\n\nAt their peak, the DCOMs were released at a rate of approximately one per month, although this trend has slowed to an average one every two months. Although in the summer, it's about three movies in three months usually for some marathon or theme they have celebrating summer. Most hit films are subsequently released on home video.\n\nStarting April 5, 2021, Disney Channel has started doing a DCOM & Dessert event every Monday where Disney Channel stars, old and new, all watch a DCOM along with a special dessert or treat based on the movie. This event went on every Monday at 7:00 PM until May 24, 2021. The movies apart of this event included The Proud Family Movie, The Cheetah Girls, Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama, Cadet Kelly, High School Musical, Smart House, and Camp Rock.\n\nDisney Channel Premiere Films\n\n1980s\n\nTiger Town (October 9, 1983)\n\nGone Are the Dayes (May 6, 1984)\n\nLove Leads the Way (October 7, 1984)\n\nBlack Arrow (January 6, 1985)\n\nLots of Luck (February 3, 1985)\n\nThe Undergrads (May 5, 1985)\n\nThe Blue Yonder (November 17, 1985)\n\nThe Parent Trap II (July 26, 1986)\n\nSpot Marks the X (October 18, 1986)\n\nDown the Long Hills (November 15, 1986)\n\nDisney's Treasure Island (July 5, 1986)\n\nStrange Companions (February 28, 1987)\n\nAnne of Avonlea: The Continuing Story of Anne of Green Gables (May 19, 1987)\n\nNot Quite Human (June 19, 1987)\n\nThe Christmas Visitor (December 5, 1987)\n\nSave the Dog (March 19, 1988)\n\nNight Train to Kathmandu (June 5, 1988)\n\nOllie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss (August 6, 1988)\n\nA Friendship in Vienna (August 27, 1988)\n\nGood Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood (November 11, 1988)\n\nGoodbye, Miss 4th of July (December 3, 1988)\n\nDanny, the Champion of the World (April 29, 1989)\n\nLooking for Miracles (June 3, 1989)\n\nGreat Expectations (July 9, 1989)\n\nNot Quite Human II (September 23, 1989)\n\nSpooner (December 2, 1989)\n\n1990s\n\nLantern Hill (January 27, 1990)\n\nChips, the War Dog (March 24, 1990)\n\nMother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme (May 19, 1990)\n\nBack Home (June 7, 1990)\n\nThe Little Kidnappers (August 17, 1990)\n\nBack to Hannibal: The Return of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (October 21, 1990)\n\nBejewelled (January 20, 1991)\n\nPerfect Harmony (March 31, 1991)\n\nMark Twain and Me (November 22, 1991)\n\nStill Not Quite Human (May 31, 1992)\n\nThe Ernest Green Story (January 17, 1993)\n\nSpies (March 7, 1993)\n\nHeidi (July 18, 1993)\n\nAirborne (September 17, 1993)\n\nOn Promised Land (April 17, 1994)\n\nThe Princess and the Goblin (June 3, 1994)\n\nPrince Brat and the Whipping Boy (July 31, 1994)\n\nTejiri was Born (October 4, 1994)\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop (March 19, 1995)\n\nEscape to Witch Mountain (April 29, 1995)\n\nFreaky Friday (May 6, 1995)\n\nNancy was Born (June 15, 1995)\n\nThe Four Diamonds (August 12, 1995)\n\nThe Little Riders (March 24, 1996)\n\nNightjohn (June 1, 1996)\n\nWish Upon a Star (June 11, 1996)\n\nSusie Q (1996)\n\nThe Paper Brigade (February 25, 1997)\n\nNorthern Lights (August 23, 1997) (considered be some sources as the 1st Disney Channel Original Movie, but wasnâ€™t included in Disney Channel's 100 Original Movies celebration)\n\nDisney Channel Original Movies\n\n1990s\n\nUnder Wraps (October 25, 1997)\n\nYou Lucky Dog (June 27, 1998)\n\nBrink!
