        "text": "Back in the summer of 2016, when the female “Ghostbusters” remake hit theaters, aggrieved fans of the original regarded the new film as a politically motivated assassination. Replacing their childhood comedy idols with women was a kind of narrative murder, committed by a cabal of Hollywood moguls and humorless feminists. This summer’s own splashy female reboot, “Ocean’s 8,” channels such histrionics with a deliciously literal twist. As the orange jumpsuited Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) attempts to talk her way out of prison — a scene that mirrors the opening parole hearing of Danny Ocean (George Clooney) from the 2001 “Ocean’s Eleven” — she reveals that Danny is her brother, and that he’s dead.\n\nMaybe. Now that every modern film franchise is destined for eternal reincarnation, no character is ever for-sure dead anymore. So as Debbie mounts her own fantastical heist — lifting $150 million worth of Cartier diamonds off a celebrity neck at the Met Gala — she keeps one eye on her brother’s tomb, half-expecting him to crawl out. We spend the film anticipating his appearance, too. Even when Debbie is on screen, Danny is in the back of our minds. And even when a Hollywood franchise is retooled around women, it still revolves around men — the story lines they wrote, the characters they created, the worlds they built.\n\nIn the two years since that “Ghostbusters,” the gender-swapped remake has expanded from one-off stunt into full-blown genre. This summer produced three such films. Joining “Ocean’s 8” is the Melissa McCarthy vehicle “Life of the Party,” which cribs its premise from Rodney Dangerfield’s 1986 comedy “Back to School” — a midlife crisis inspires a parent to join his or her kid at college and high jinks ensue. There’s also “Overboard,” with Anna Faris as the working-class single parent (played by Kurt Russell in the 1987 original) who exacts revenge on a wealthy playboy after he falls off his yacht and forgets who he is (Eugenio Derbez takes on the Goldie Hawn role).\n\nMore are on the way. A female-centric remake of “What Women Want,” starring Taraji P. Henson, is coming in December. A “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” redo, “The Hustle,” with Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson tagging in for Michael Caine and Steve Martin, is slated for next summer. Gender-flipped adaptations of “Lord of the Flies,” “Splash” and “What About Bob” are in various stages of development. Even KFC mascot Colonel Sanders has now been rebooted as a woman.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
