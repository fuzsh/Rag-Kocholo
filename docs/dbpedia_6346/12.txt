Vinnie gets out of jail after serving 10 years and tries to find out who killed his younger brother - played by a young Robert de Niro.

Some plot.

DeNiro is VERY young in this movie that looks like it was financed with mob money.In fact, his scenes are taken from a 1969 movie called Sam's Song!!!And when I say scenes, DeNiro is literally in the movie 90 seconds despite getting top billing!!!!

The crazy director went on to teach at City University in NY. Sybil Danning has blue hair. Why? We never find out. A couple scenes later it's brown.

The movie is pretty bad.
