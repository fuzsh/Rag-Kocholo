Sam’s Song (1969) / The Swap (1979). This is a weird one. In 1969 Jordan Leondopolous made a movie with De Niro that is a drama / romance about a filmmaker who goes away for a weekend in the Hamptons with some friends where relationships are formed and broken. It’s not a good movie. Then, in 1979 the same film maker took the footage, cut out a bunch of stuff and added a heap of new footage of additional actors and voice over to create a film noir style revenge flick where De Niro was killed off right at the start of the movie and appears in flashback for the remainder. No additional footage was shot with De Niro, the stuff that was added was terrible, with a finale / story that makes little to no sense. Pretty clear that it was an attempt to cash in once De Niro became famous, even the DVD I bought has a misleading cover. (I ended up watching Sam's Song on YouTube as I wasn't aware of this 2 movies from 1 lot of footage before I started watching and had to research what was going on) Both are bad movies, but there are moments where you can see some of the foundations jof De Niro’s acting style which is pretty cool for a fan.
