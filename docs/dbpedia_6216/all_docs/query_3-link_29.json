        "text": "Hi,\n\nWe are still using an old version of eVault 9.0.0.1193 in combination with 4 Exchange server 2010 Service Pack 2 in a DAG configuration. It is only used for mail archiving. We had file archiving in the past, but stopped this when we moved to NetApp. We plan to upgrade eVault somewhere in 2014.\n\nThe solution is not working stable at the moment. It basically never has, but at the moment it seems worst. We regularly have the MQ queues that freeze. No messages are going in & out the queue. It happens randomly, but almost every 2 to 3 days. As our setup is dependant on the backup, because no items can be removed from the mailbox until an succesfull backup, and we only backup at night, this usually leads to user impact for at least a day.\n\nI did find a workaround to clear the queues and reset the storage & MQ service. It is based on this article: http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=TECH48896. This temporary resolves the issue. We want a more stable solution until we get a green light from the business to upgrade.\n\nThe event that seems to be linked to it on the server is ID 2262: \"Error processing archiving request for system MAILSERVER.\". And the same moment, just after this event, the ID 3156: \"Start to process the Exchange system MAILSERVER.\" is logged, but the MQ queue seems to freeze.\n\nRestarting the MQ service fails. It timed out after a VERY long time, only removing the queues of emptying them, seems to again get it up an running. Users randomly complain that they can not restore items, or that archiving stopped. An engineer, who left the company, called Symantec for it, and they suggested him to reinstall MQ each time the problem occurs. A bizzare suggestion to be honest.\n\nI have checked numerous things and suggestion, also based on suggestions in this forum, but until this moment the final solution remains a mistery. I hope, with your help, to get some leads to solve this issue. I can provide extra information if needed.\n\nAlready many thanks for your help!"
