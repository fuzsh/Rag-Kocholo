An outdoors person can have the beer at the outdoor terrace of the Espresso House near passport control.

Plenty of pictures have been posted already so I wont bother- it looks exactly like in all the pics floating around, would not call this clinical at all, rather what youd expect from modern clean and uncluttered Scandinavian design. Very nice in my view.\n\nOverall, this is such a HUGE improvement over the old lounge (and unlike claimed by many online bloggers NOT in the old space as that has gotten gutted out and is clearly visible empty from the terminal). Last year, I had connected in the Schengen area for the first time and was only used to the great non-Schengen lounge so the messy old Schengen lounge had been a real shock to me. This is so much better, much nicer space, great tarmac views and just overall much quieter and more spacious with nice clean toilets and plenty of different seating options to satisfy anyones needs. Granted, the food is still not great but the one hot pasta with salami dish was still way better than rye god awful creamy pasta with cod and salmon dish that they had last year in the old lounge and has haunted my worst dreams ever since. So, I think food and especially drinks also good enough as one really cant compare with a proper international lounge: Inner Schengen in Europe is more akin to Domestic in the US or Australia and therefore this is more than adequate.\n\nJul 23, 2024, 5:36 am\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2019\n\nLocation: TLL\n\nPrograms: AY+ Plat (OWE), *A Gold, ST Elite Plus\n\nPosts: 86\n\nI really think the food has gotten worse. Pasta with tomato gunk. Stale bread. Watery mushroom soup with no mushrooms but onions instead. Totally gross. The most appetizing thing was boiled carrots. And they call it platinum corner.

Extremely sad.\n\nCant get much worse than the awful cod and salmon pasta so this is a big improvement and the Chorizo bits in the pasta actually had some flavour. Mushroom soup was actually quite flavoursome for a packaged soup powder kind of thing.\n\nAgain- this is inner European and Finnair does not even offer First class so even just a respite for One World Platinum members (or whatever its called- Diamond?) is better than what most other airlines offer.\n\nOlperoo likes this.\n\nJul 23, 2024, 9:22 am\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2019\n\nPrograms: AY+\n\nPosts: 219\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Sydneyberlin\n\n\n\nI think food and especially drinks also good enough as one really cant compare with a proper international lounge: Inner Schengen in Europe is more akin to Domestic in the US or Australia and therefore this is more than adequate.\n\nThis.

European flights are not domestic flights, Schengen or not. Many flights are relatively long, there is no meal service in Y on those flights and many of them cost an arm and a leg, sometimes on par with longhaul flights. No excuse not to serve something edible in the lounge.\n\nflorens likes this.\n\nJul 23, 2024, 2:53 pm\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2013\n\nLocation: Sydney, Australia\n\nPrograms: BA Gold, QF Platinum, SQ Silver\n\nPosts: 369\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by ffay005\n\nI don't agree with the \"domestic\" explanation at all.

And yes, most inner European flights are significantly shorter than Domestic flights in, say, the US, Australia or China. So indeed, its more akin to Domestic and even the Economy seating in Business class (and lack of meal service in Y which you ironically mention yourself) speak to this simple fact.\n\nJul 23, 2024, 3:36 pm\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2005\n\nLocation: HEL\n\nPrograms: AY Platinum, TK Elite, BT VIP, AA, BA, SK, DL, NT, WB + hotels\n\nPosts: 8,960\n\nOkay, so next time I fly from Dili to Darwin on an E170, I'll be on a domestic flight.

And if Dili is one of those close-by islands that no one typically flies to and therefore gets served by an E170, then youre probably lucky to even get Domestic level service offerings. Not sure what this has to do with flights within the Schengen zone though\n\nAndaman likes this.\n\nContact Us - Manage Preferences Archive - Advertising - Cookie Policy - Privacy Statement - Terms of Service -\n\nThis site is owned, operated, and maintained by MH Sub I, LLC dba Internet Brands.
