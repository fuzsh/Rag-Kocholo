Excerpt: WIPX-TV - body{behavior:url(\"/w/skins-1.5/vector/csshover.htc\")} WIPX-TV The station signed on in December 1988 as WIIB. It was a Home Shopping Network (HSN) station owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. There were plans to eventually switch WIIB to a general entertainment format. However, those plans never materialized, as Sinclair acquired WTTV in 1995 as a result of a merger. WIIB continued to air HSN programming until 1998, when it affiliated with Pax TV and changed its call sign to WIPX to reflect its new affiliation. The station was sold to Paxson Communications in 2000.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
