        "text": "Hey guys, here are some tips on Communication. This is especially for leaders or people in place of authority. You notice that you get to raise your voice when you want to command authority, but it might drive your subjects to interpret the information wrongly because of the voice of your tone. Intonation maters allot, in communication. But there is a trick, to maintaining the meaning of your message even when the Tone rises. Add more melody to your voice.\n\nGreat observation on how women can speak with more volume without sounding angry. Adding more melody will do the job! I learned this theory from my voice coaching mentor Roger Love , who I believe has taught Vinh as well, but the last tip of going down in melody at the end even though it's a question is new to me, but it's quite effective in making us look more authoritative! #publicspeaking #eventhost #emcee #communicationcoach #rogerlovemethodcoaching #speakingvoicecoach\n\nüî•üé§ Breaking Stereotypes and Amplifying Voices! üé∂üöÄ Great post for women who need to be assertive at the workplace without being seen to be angry When it comes to commanding authority, women often find themselves in a bind. While speaking louder may be necessary, it can lead to unjust labels like \"bitchy\". Now, imagine adding the intersectionality of being a black woman, and the stereotypes and biases we face can be even more daunting. As a black woman, I can fully relate to the added layer of being labeled as an \"angry black woman\" when expressing ourselves assertively. It's time we shed light on this challenge faced by many women, particularly women of color. Just watched the great video below of Vinh Giang talking through a great technique we can help to reshape these perceptions: adding more melody to our voices! üéµ‚ú® By infusing our speech with a touch of melody, we not only make our words more pleasant to hear but also dismantle the preconceived notions of anger often associated with black women. Thanks Vinh Giang ‚ù§Ô∏è #BreakingStereotypes #AmplifyVoices #WomenInBusiness #InclusiveWorkplace #Empowerment #Intersectionality"
