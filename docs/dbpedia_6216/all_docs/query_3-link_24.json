        "text": "WNEO, virtual and UHF digital channel 45, is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to Alliance, Ohio, United States. The station's programming is simulcast on satellite station WEAO, virtual channel 49 (UHF digital channel 50), in Akron. The two stations utilize the unified brand \"Western Reserve PBS\". WNEO is the PBS member station of record for the Youngstown market, while WEAO provides the Cleveland market with a second choice for PBS programming alongside the market's flagship PBS station, WVIZ (channel 25).\n\nWNEO and WEAO are owned by Northeastern Educational Television of Ohio, which is a consortium of the University of Akron, Kent State University and Youngstown State University. The two stations operate from studio facilities located on Kent State's campus in Kent, northeast of Akron and roughly west of Youngstown. WNEO's transmitter is located in Salem and WEAO's transmitter is located in Copley.\n\nWNEO also operates W44CR-D, a low-power digital translator in Youngstown, which serves low-lying areas in the Mahoning Valley that are shadowed from the main WNEO signal. The digital translator, which signed on the air in 2009, is a conversion of a former analog translator, W58AM, which broadcast at the same location.\n\nOverview[]\n\nWNEO first signed on the air on May 30, 1973. It was originally intended to serve all of northeast Ohio from Youngstown to Cleveland. Its city of license, Alliance, is split between both major markets in the region. Most of the city is in Stark County, which is in the Cleveland market; a small portion is in Mahoning County, home to Youngstown. However, it was later decided to reorient WNEO to serve Youngstown and sign on a satellite station to serve Akron and Cleveland. That station, WEAO, signed on the air more than two years later on September 21, 1975. Prior to WEAO's sign-on, the channel 49 allocation in the Cleveland/Akron market was occupied by Akron-based WAKR-TV from 1953 to 1967, when that station moved to UHF channel 23 (WAKR now operates as Ion Television owned-and-operated station WVPX-TV).\n\nUntil October 1, 2008, WEAO and WNEO were jointly branded as \"PBS 45 & 49\". On October 1, 2008 at 5:30 a.m., WNEO and WEAO changed their on-air branding to \"Western Reserve PBS\", as part of the parent organization's overall branding change to Western Reserve Public Media. The rebranding was done to make the station's identity better reflect the viewing area, and due to the fact that the combined WNEO/WEAO operations are broadcast on different cable channels in their respective service areas.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTV stations in Ohio WVIZ, Cleveland\n\nWNEO/WEAO, Alliance/Akron\n\nWOUB/WOUC, Athens/Cambridge\n\nWPTD/WPTO, Sandusky/Dayton/Oxford\n\nWBGU, Bowling Green\n\nWGTE, Toledo\n\nWOSU, Columbus\n\nWCET, Cincinnati\n\nTV stations in Youngstown–Warren, Ohio and Sharon–New Castle, Pennsylvania WYFX-LD 19 (Fox)\n\nWFMJ 21 (NBC)\n\nWKBN 27 (CBS)\n\nWYTV 33 (ABC)\n\nWNEO 45 (PBS)\n\nWEAO 49 (PBS)"
