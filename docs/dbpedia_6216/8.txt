The Son of Ghoul

Following in the footsteps of Cleveland's legendary 60's horror host Ghoulardi, The Son Of Ghoul has become an Ohio television icon. With 38 consecutive years on the air, he is the longest continuous running costumed horror host in the nation if not the world. Son Of Ghoul brings a high-spirited rock and roll attitude to those bad old PD horror movies we love to hate adding a lively variety of sound effects and crazy music, sometimes even showing classic comedy movies. The show also features viewer "fang mail", comedy skits, celeberty interviews, national and local bands. Broadcast over the air in N.E. Ohio SUNDAY'S at 8 P.M. (ET) on WIVM Ch. 39 AKRON and WIVD Ch. 26 CANTON Check your N.E. Ohio cable systems channel lineup for WIVM.
