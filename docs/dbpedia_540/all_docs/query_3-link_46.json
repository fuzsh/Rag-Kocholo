        "text": "Nancy Marian (Helfrich) McBride, 80, died October 18, 2022, at St. Catherine Hospital, Garden City, Kansas. She was born March 21, 1942, at Syracuse, Kansas, the daughter of Fred and Virginia H. Wilt Helfrich.\n\nShe married Donald Geier on October 21, 2012, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He survives.\n\nNancy was a generous, creative, and empowered woman who was a force to be reckoned with, especially when it impacted her family. She raised her six children and worked fulltime. She was a one-stop shop for her children and grandchildren. She was their cosmologist, plumber, general contractor, seamstress and tailor, chef, artist, therapist, mediator, gardener, fountain of knowledge, and so much more! There was nothing she could not do, and if you ever doubted her, she would prove you wrong. She worked at Plaza Medical Center for 40+ years and would go head-to-head with insurance companies on their patient's behalf. She didn’t back down, while still displaying grace and courtesy, when dealing with some of the most stubborn, strong-willed people you will ever meet. These stubborn, strong-willed people included her children and grandchildren, which she loved so very much.\n\nNancy was a devout Catholic at St. Mary Catholic Church and incorporated her faith in her daily life by treating others how she would want to be treated. She was always willing to support anyone in need, no matter in what capacity. She adopted a family every Christmas and when she could, she would take the time to get to know the family and go above and beyond to provide the best holiday for them. Nancy was the type of person that you would want to be when you grew-up, even if you are already an adult. She set the bar high but had reasonable expectations for all. This world would be a much better place if we all strived to be like her.\n\nMany individuals are impacted by her unexpected loss, and we will never be able to fill the gap in our lives or in the world. Some of the small things that would be missed will be - walking into her home and being greeted and then given a tour of her latest project, whether it be an art project, remodel, or out in the yard with her beautiful flowers; Her cream corn at Thanksgiving dinner; The hour-long conversations about anything; The mile long text messages….so many things that are too numerous to mention all.\n\nWe love you to the moon and back and more, Mom, Grandma D, Wife, Sister, and Friend.\n\nOther survivors include her 6 children, whom she shared with former spouse Robert “Bob” Barlow, Tracy Barlow of Dodge City, KS; Jody Barlow of Garden City, KS; Craig Barlow of Holcomb, KS; Wade (Jackie) Barlow of Holcomb, KS; Krista (Jake) Schlegel of Dodge City, KS; Brian (Wendi) Barlow of Ingalls, KS; 3 stepchildren Scott (Katie) Geier of Garden City, KS; Sister Mary Pietá of Harlem, New York and Matt (Martha) Geier of Holcomb, KS; her siblings Dick (Vicky) Helfrich of Coolidge, KS and Peggy (Larry McGriff) Helfrich of Capistrano Beach, CA; her grandchildren Cory (Monica) Barber; Jared (Nicole) Chappel; Jenna (Travis) Kisner; Jantz Chappel; Wrae (Tony Salazar) Barlow; Kyllie (Levi) Richardson; Kala Barlow; Abby (Jaz) Barlow; Brianna Barlow; Kenzie Schlegel; Maddison Schlegel; Riley (Lexi) Parsons and Regan Parsons; Zane Geier; and Brynn Geier; Gunner Newberry; Ethan Newberry; and her great grandchildren Logan Barber; Colton Chappel; Weston Chappel; Wyatt Kisner; Wade Kisner; Vivian Fay Kisner; Treyden Eastin; Parker Eastin; Skylar Barlow; Amilee Wasson; Presley Parsons; Haven Parsons; and numerous cousins, nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, brothers John “Jack” Helfrich; Robert “Bob” Helfrich; sister Judy Helfrich and sister-in-law Gala Helfrich.\n\nVigil Service will be at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday October 25, 2022, and Funeral Mass at 11:00 a.m. Wednesday, October 26, 2022, both at St. Mary Catholic Church with Fr. Jacob Schneider as Celebrant. A private family burial will take place at a later time. There will be no calling hours.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are suggested to St. Mary Catholic Church or Emmaus House in care of Garnand Funeral Home.
