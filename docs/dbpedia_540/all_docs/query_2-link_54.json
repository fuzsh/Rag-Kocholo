        "text": "Margurite “Peg” Helfrich, age 84, of Stockbridge, MI, passed away on January 29, 2022. She was born the daughter of Helen (Piepelo) and Wilford L. Palmer on February 9, 1937. She married Dennis Helfrich, Sr. in February 1996, and he survives.\n\nMargurite was a wonderful wife, mother, and grandmother – with an unwavering sense of humor. She was very creative, had an amazing green thumb, and enjoyed crafting, painting, and drawing. She loved coffee, cleaning, her pets, the casino, and never let you leave the house without toast in your pocket. She was resilient, a follower of Christ, and loved everyone unconditionally.\n\nShe was a longtime part-owner of Stockbridge Manufacturing and worked at the IGA grocery store for several years. In addition to her spouse, she is survived by her children, Cynthia (Dan) Kuhn, Renee (Brian) Basore, and Larry (Lisa) Cornish II; step-children, Denny Jr. (Kelly) Helfrich, and Kelly (Kyle) Owen; brothers, Charles (Jeri) Palmer and Joseph (Stephanie) Palmer; grandchildren, Cassandra (Michael), Alexandra (Gregory), Andrea, Danielle, Ari, and Larry III; step-grandchildren, Nicole, Danielle, Kendall, Kameron, and Karlee; great-grandchildren, Mia and Lucy; step-great-grandchildren, Wesley, Bowen, and Charlotte; as well as many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews. Marguerite was preceded in death by her first husband, Larry Cornish I, and her parents."
