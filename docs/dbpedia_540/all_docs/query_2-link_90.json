        "text": "Jodi Lee Ruggiero, 36, loving wife, devoted mother, cherished daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, niece and friend, unexpectedly passed from this life and into the loving arms of her Heavenly Father on Sunday, July 28th, 2024. She is survived by her husband, Nelson McCoy, her children Joshua Ruggiero, Kaylee Hazzard-Ruggiero, and Piper, Jeremiah and Nelson McCoy; her mother, Sue Wackerlin, her father John Ruggiero (Sandy), Step-Father Ralph Wackerlin and Mother in law Mary McCoy. Also surviving are her siblings Tony, Ken (Ashley), Danielle (Adam), Jacob, Jill (Robert), Brandon, Rachel (Ben), Zack (Audrey), Wyatt (Jodi), Jordan (Theresa), Eric and Kristin (Steve). She is also survived by her brothers and sisters-in-law Roeisha, Kinyetta (Emanuel), Jervaius, Demarlon, and Dayo, as well as too many family and friends to list. She was preceded in death by her father-in-law, Fray McCoy. Jodi was a proud wife and a wonderful mother and was always quick to tell any and all how much her family meant to her. She graduated from Grant Park High School in the Village of Grant Park, Illinois, where she spent most of her life. She continued her education at Kankakee Area Career Center studying cosmetology and became a very talented hairdresser. After an injury that ended her cosmetology career, she went to work at Riverside Medical Center in the Breast Cancer Department, where she enriched the lives of many women facing life after breast cancer. Most recently she was a Personal Banker at Midland States Bank in Grant Park where she was loved and admired by both customers and employees alike. Jodi had a smile that would light up the darkest of rooms. A laugh that when you heard it, you knew she was close by, and you had to laugh with her! A personality that left a lasting impression on everyone she ever came in contact with. A heart more precious than gold. And a love for anything \"bling\". Her family get-togethers were epic and a favorite for all who attended. But if you were invited, you had to get there early to grab a few of her famous deviled eggs as well as the best potato salad ever made. She was strong-willed, yet compassionate. She would give you the shirt off her back without even asking why you needed it. She loved the beach, Dunkin coffee, her friends and co-workers, but family was absolutely everything to her. She will be terribly missed but will continue to live on in our hearts through so many memories. \"When sadness fills your heart. When tears flow in your eyes. Always remember 3 things. God is with you. Still with you. Always with you.\" A visitation will be held at Fedde-Helfrich-Cross Funeral Home on Sunday, August 4th from 1:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. with a Memorial Service immediately following at 5:00 P.M. with the Rev. Kyle Timmons officiating. In lieu of flowers, a Go Fund Me account is being set up to benefit the children's educational needs. Due to the ongoing road construction, Main Street will be closed to traffic. Pedestrian traffic in front of the funeral home will be open and access may be made through the front door. Additional parking will be available in the parking lot of Christ Community Church, 103 W. Corning Ave., Peotone, IL. Sign the guestbook at www.feddehelfrichcrossfh.com"
