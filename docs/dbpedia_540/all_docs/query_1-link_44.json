Thanks to the authors who were able to make their presentations available in written form to be published here.\n\nI would also like to thank Lorin Levins of the College Publications Department for the work she did getting this ready for publication and assisting with editing.\n\nI also thank Colby Thomas and the members of the Convivium Committee for their help in making this publication possible.\n\nJim Coan, Editor\n\nWhat You're Really Saying: How Voice Production Communicates\n\nAndrew Kaid Theatre\n\nLet me start with a few disclaimers. I am not a linguist, though I will talk about language, paralinguistics, and speech. I am not a medical professional though I will talk about anatomy, physiology, and vocal health. I am not a singer though I’ll talk about voice placement, resonance, intonation, and diaphragmatic breathing.\n\nI am not a physicist though I will discuss harmonics, frequencies, vibrations, and energy. I am not a shaman though I will talk about healing, spiritualism, and holistic health. I am not a psychologist, though I will speak of the relationship between physical and mental health.\n\nWhat I am is a performing artist, a trained professional voice user, a frequent consultant on problems with vocal usage in performance and an advocate that effective, healthy, and dynamic vocal usage is not the singular domain of any of the professionals I have just named. I am also a teacher—which has afforded me the arrogance as well as the practical experience and opportunities for observation and exploration—to believe that I know enough about any of these subjects to wade in and throw ideas around.\n\nThis discussion is based on a few presumptions about the voice. There is much about vocal communication that we take for granted. Here are a few suppositions that help me to frame my work with actors, voice students, and other people with whom I work and consult:\n\nThe voice does not lie — it communicates the self; all of the insecurities and areas of confidence. It expresses personality and most of us are keenly attuned to inferred messages and relational cues that come from the SOUND of voices we hear. As listeners, we recognize that the voice is more trustworthy than words. If sound is the cake, words are the icing.\n\nThis assertion may be counter-intuitive to some academics who rely on the logical assertion of words and maintain an innate belief in the superiority of verbal expression. But in interpersonal communication, verbal messages are typically eclipsed by the influence of sound. The voice expresses a social need to communicate, relate and bond with others. Sound is far more influential in the development of social relationships—attraction, tolerance, repulsion—than what we have to say.\n\nThe voice is energetic — not a substance, but a flow of dynamic energy— only discernible in relation to what can be heard, said, expressed or released. As a result we can roar, whisper, interject, berate, croon, rant, murmur, moan, guffaw, wail, sob, plead, console, and praise with SOUND. The energetic qualities of the voice carry the primary thrust of what we communicate. As a result, the voice has effective and communicative power. We use it to influence people and assert our identity. The sound of the voice communicates with a different part of the brain than language. Tone, pitch, quality, rate, and inflection—the essential components of human voice perception—are processed in the right temporal lobe while language is processed in the left hemisphere of the brain.\n\nAlong with these these two suppositions, I would also like to point out two common misperceptions about the voice that may impede our capacity to develop fully expressive use of the voice:\n\nEffort is required to “strengthen the voice” — Americans in particular are trained to work harder to get the results they want. What is required is not “strengthening” in a muscular sense, but ßexihility and resilience. You don’t want to “strength train” your voice because this becomes an invitation to develop habits of physical tension that impair the natural mechanisms of breath, phonation, resonance and articulation. Kristen Linklater, one of the most influential voice teachers working in contemporary theatre, wrote—and recently revised—an outstanding book on voice training for actors that has become a fundamental text in American theatre. The book is called Freeing the Natural Voice, and since its publication it has profoundly shifted attitudes and approaches to voice training in acting conservatories and training programs. Her central tenet is the title of the book. The voice is fully available when the voice user removes the habituated blocks and impediments that restrict power, freedom and fluency.1 Conditioning is a matter of removing mental, physical and emotional roadblocks so that the physical mechanisms can work efficiently. In Linklaters model, tension is the enemy. Her work is not an anomaly, but an indicator of a wider movement toward natural expression in contemporary performance training.\n\nYou are “stuck” with the voice you have—anatomy is cruel... — In\n\nshort, no. There are physical parameters. Your vocal tract is of a particular size. Your articulators are of a particular shape. The vocal folds—while resilient and swift to heal—can sustain permanent damage from trauma or\n\nchronic misuse. Specific maladies and conditions like spasmodic disphonia or vocal fold paralysis can disrupt the voice. Age, smoking, alcohol and hard living can eventually reduce power, range and flexibility, but in almost every case where a person is struggling with voice issues, there are effective interventions available to improve sound quality, resonance, breath support and articulation. Most voice issues that do not have a specific medical cause can be improved by addressing the mechanics of voice production, the underlying tensions and anxieties and the imagery for using the voice being employed by the speaker.\n\nEnergy and sound\n\nBreath begets vibration, begets amplification, begets articulation, begets communication, begets response, begets inspiration, begets breath.. .Breath is active, pulse is active, blood flow is active, cells are dancing all over the place. Neurons are firing, electricity is pulsing around like a million firecrackers in your nervous system. The miracle is that there aren’t more parts of us that can make noise and vibrate on cue. Our voices are an extension of the life energy that defines us. But the process for making sound is a unique physical phenomenon. We inhale, we exhale, vibration occurs in the vocal folds and sound is generated. The experience is obvious and familiar, but utterly mysterious when we begin to examine what makes the voice physically possible.\n\nThe engine of the voice is breath. Efficient use of the diaphragm—the muscular membrane that divides the lungs from the lower organs—coupled with free and responsive movement in the ribs and abdomen maximizes the volume of the inhale. Smooth and controlled engagement of one muscle group at the point of exhale—the transverse muscles buried deep in the abdomen—provides the most efficient foundation for supporting the outward flow of breath needed to phonatc—that is, to make noise. Phonation is not a direct muscular activity any more than twanging a rubber band requires the exertions of the rubber band.\n\nThe cartilaginous attachments for the vocal folds respond to a nerve impulse to vocalize sent from the brain. The folds draw together across the opening of the glottis. The flow of air across the folds “flaps” the folds together creating rapid interruptions in air flow that are audible as vibrations. Pitch is controlled, to some extent, by the length and tautness of the vocal fold tissue. The effect is like playing just the mouthpiece of a saxophone—audible, but lacking power, harmonic reinforcement, or shape.\n\nThis vibration, then, is amplified by rebounding off of any hard surface adjacent to the source of vibration. The most direct resonance travels straight up the tube of the pharynx and since the passageway is roughly the shape of a closed cylinder about 17—18 centimeters in length it creates a series of harmonic pitches—typically at three different frequencies—called formants The interplay of these formants creates the essential sound of the human voice, which is quickly rearranged and manipulated by the shape of the upper pharynx and subtle movements of articulators in the mouth. These articulators are the lips, teeth, hard and soft palates and tongue.\n\nThe resonance of the voice is further reinforced by indirect vibrations that operate off of any hard or bony surface they can End in the body. Relaxed muscle is able to vibrate in concert with this resonance while contracted muscle tends to deaden the vibration. This characteristic, in part, allows a speaker to shift the qualities of the voice.\n\nSingers are familiar with distinctions between chest voice and head voice—or high, middle and low ranges. These ranges are partly reflective of pitch but also rely on free vibration in particular areas of the body. “Chest resonance” uses the larger bony structure of the spine and rib cage to transmit lower frequency vibrations. Mid-range frequencies find optimal reinforcement in the areas closest to the vocal folds, while high resonances, in tighter wave patterns, tend to find optimal resonance at the upper end of the vocal tract in the sinus cavities, face, and dome of the skull.\n\nMost anatomical discussions of resonance give short shrift to resonation outside of the vocal tract. But the expressive significance of these sympathetic areas of resonance is critical to sensing how the voice FEELS. And as most actors and singers can attest, sensing these areas of resonance is fundamental to the expressive use of the voice.\n\n“Why don’t I already know this? My voice has been with me all my life..\n\nElocution, debate, and rhetoric were once integral to the American educational system. These old-fashioned disciplines were tied to classical notions of oratory that have been largely supplanted by the drive for computer literacy and newer innovations in education. While I am not arguing for a return to slates and chalk, the instilled practice of oral presentation and rhetoric did establish voice habits— often at a young age—that promoted breath support, resonance, and articulation as necessary skills.\n\nBy the time most contemporary students reach a college environment, their reticence to speak publicly is already deeply entrenched. Worse, the shrunken realism of television and mediated news, talking head punditry and formulized entertainment has given our public discourse the inarticulate flatness of wallpaper paste or playground name-calling. Sadly, by comparison to the current norms of public debate, impassioned oratory seems either pompous or over-zealous to most contemporary listeners.\n\nHealth and the voice\n\nMuscles and organs that shift to support the voice extend from the floor of the pelvis to the dome of the cranium. When the body is fully resonant, all of it can vibrate. The voice follows the pathway of energy centers in the body—chakras, in traditional Indian medicine—and imagery that reinforces awareness of this pathway of the voice through the body, can exert a powerful influence on a voice student when these energy centers are equated with the flow of sound. Meridians of energy flow in the body, as described in traditional Chinese medicine, and may also have a direct influence on the sound and harmonic resonance of the voice.3\n\nIf words like chakra, meridian, and holistic health make your skeptical scientific mind uneasy, consider this: Eastern medicine has used vocal intonation in conjunction with healing and meditation for thousands of years. The power of this imagery to influence the release of tension and promote healing in the body is Ending increasing support from Western medicine.\n\nThe voice itself may even have healing properties. According to the National Institutes of Health, singing releases substances in the brain that serve as natural pain killers. Studies have confirmed that singing has a range of positive effects on Alzheimer’s patients who may struggle to recognize spouses and children but can still retain the lyrics of songs from their youth.4 Singing, used therapeutically with the elderly, has resulted in documented benefits that include reduced cases of eyesight problems, depression, and a decreased demand for medications and medical appointments. Singing boosts the immune system and improves lung capacity, energy and—believe it or not—posture. The benefits have proven so overwhelming that arts therapy programs that include singing have become the norm rather than the exception as a treatment option in hospitals and care centers.4\n\nSimilarly, laughter has been proven to improve heart function and circulation while providing a great workout for the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.\n\nLaughing burns calories and boosts the metabolic rate, reduces stress and clearly improves mood.6 While these benefits are not strictly the result of vocalization, spontaneous laughter is consistently vocalized unless the laugher makes a conscious choice to inhibit the vocalized response. An open laugh connects a diaphragmatic spasm with phonation and resonance.\n\nLike laughing, crying and wailing use a similar diaphragmatic spasm to express grief and sadness. The truism, “sometimes you just need a good cry” has some basis in fact. To affect this, the body creates spasms in the involuntary mechanisms of vocalization, resulting in a cathartic release of overwhelming emotion. Typically, after freely released laughing and crying, the relative pitch of the voice drops—often significantly. Why? Reduced tension in the throat allows the vocal folds to lengthen and rib tension has been disrupted, allowing fuller and deeper breath support and body resonance. At the same time muscles in the face shoulders, chest and lower torso are in exhausted recovery from spasmodic contractions. These muscles normally activate to shield our vulnerable emotional selves, but in the aftermath of emotional outbursts we let our guards—and our voices—come down.\n\nKristin Linklater confirms the close link between physical tension in the body, emotional release and the flexibility of vocal expression in Freeing the Natural Voice when she writes, “Blocked emotions are the fundamental obstacle to a free voice.” As a second assertion, she states that “Muddy thinking is the fundamental obstacle to clear articulation.”7 In both cases, Linklater is drawing a close connection between the tensions of the body and the expressive capacity of our emotions and thoughts. But the tools of free expression are not the exclusive domain of actors and performers who use the body and the voice to impersonate characters. We all play roles in our lives and manipulate the body and voice to express our ideas, needs and desires. We all deserve the expressive freedom, and healthful benefits, that the voice can unlock.\n\nRoleplaying and imagery as voice tools\n\nSo where do we begin? How do we improve our sound, resonance and projection of the voice? There are some pitfalls that make adjusting the voice difficult. The first has to do with our efforts to critically observe our own voices. The voice is largely controlled autonomically. The brain and nervous system do not work exclusively or directly with our central nervous system to express with the voice, so modulating specific aspects of vocal usage can be like doing brain surgery with a butter knife—using a blunt tool to modify a subtle mechanism. Worse, seeking out vocal flaws and problems accentuates the tensions and habits that contribute to the sound. How do you NOT nasalize sound, or tighten the throat to create stridency if the only awareness you have is for what you have been critically informed is wrong?\n\nWithout an alternative to your habit to explore, changing the habit can be difficult and ego-sapping. A feeling of hopelessness may emerge along with a desire to CONTROL the voice. This frustration, in turn, only magnifies insecurity, tension and the sense that muscular exertion will somehow overcome a perceived weakness. The result is often a voice in crisis and a voice user in peril of doing real damage. Our work ethic becomes our own worst enemy. We strain to HEAR how the voice can be improved and fail to feel the voice resonating in the body or straining to overcome our own physical constrictions.\n\nWith the voice, sensation and imagination are far more powerful tools than critical analysis.We are intuitive role players. We use empathy to project ourselves into viewpoint, character and imagined circumstance. We PLAY ROLES IN LIFE. These roles even have names; parent, teacher, spouse, employee, colleague, friend. We learned to play these roles by imitating and adapting models from our own experience. Only inhibition (fear of judgement) and stunted imagination limit our capacity to use role playing and imagery as tools to influence vocal and physical expression.\n\nFor example, if a speaker has pronounced nasality, tension in the solar plexus and lower ribs, a slight chin thrust, a strident compression of the vocal folds and tongue tension that impedes mid-mouth resonance, I could try to individually coach the speaker away from each of these vocal mannerisms. I could point out each of these flaws and make the client acutely aware of what was wrong and how to shift the body to modify the habit. Eventually, the client might be able to address these habits and possibly correct them, but the process could be lengthy, cumbersome and frustrating.\n\nBy contrast, I could ask my client to impersonate a character who had a head cold, a beer gut, a powerful chest and a constant habit of yawning. After doing twenty jumping jacks as this character—something miraculous happens—a breathless, overweight, denasalizing slob subplants the tensions of habit and the client s imagination creates a character. Instead of responding to criticism, the client becomes engaged in the imaginative game of CREATING a characterization. The voice is new and feels different in the body. Calibrating the difference between the two extremes becomes a matter of creative choice rather than of correcting a list of “flaws” deeply ingrained in the self-image and defensive perceptions of my client.\n\nThe greatest advantage of this method is that it removes the primary obstacle for change—the distressing sense that “I don’t sound like me.” Even if that was the goal in the first place, displacing someone’s identity by changing the sound of the voice can be an alarming transition. I have seen students and clients burst into tears, erupt with convulsive laughter and physically collapse from this transformation. The tensions and barriers that have been socialized and instilled into our voices are deeply rooted in our identities and are difficult to release.\n\nParalinguistics/Paraknguage\n\nVocal expression that is not housed in literal language is known as paralanguagc, and its study is known as paralinguistics. According to paralinguistic studies, “Fundamental frequency of the voice is directly affiliated with psychological arousal or stress and is generated by an increase in general muscle tension.”0 Basically, the higher pitch migrates above optimal pitch—the pitch at which the voice is most comfortably audible and projectable—the more likely it is that the speaker—regardless of gender—is stressed. Anyone listening to the voice is attuned to this stress.\n\nIn a series of University studies examining the paralinguistics of German and American speakers, several factors related to this vocal indicator were described. First, perceptions of social status and relative authority were seen to correlate with pitch range. Lower pitched voices were associated with more respectful communication and the intention to create a positive and authoritative impression on other people. Higher pitches contributed to an increase in emotional stress and a decreased sense of respect for social position. The results were consistent across both linguistic groups, though it was noted that the median pitch of the Germans was higher than their American counterparts.9\n\nUltimately, analysis of paralinguistics in a scientific context is still struggling to wrap its methodical arms around the complexity of the human voice. What artists explore intuitively, through imitation and experimentation, is still an awkward Frankenstein monster for scientific inquiry. Vocal usage is highly individual and until we can dissect the physical components of emotion and thought, we will be hard pressed to medically encapsulate the nuances of the paralinguistics.\n\nNevertheless, clinical application of paralinguistics is finding its way into diagnostic medicine. Many doctors now receive training in appropriate vocal communication and listening skills, from—that’s right—voice coaches. Cues associated with pitch, rate of speech and breath support are increasingly a relevant part of medical assessment.111 Western medicine has gradually caught on to the fact that treating the whole patient means not just listening to what people say, but how they say it.\n\nSo, what are voice coaches bringing to this process that has the potential to provide richer expression, better health and less stressful communication? They are teaching effective communication that preserves vocal health, intelligibility, and expressiveness for an actor on stage, but that also has wider applications for anyone interested in using the voice more constructively. Inventive teachers use a wide range of exercises and imaginative approaches. They borrow from speech pathologists, singing teachers, linguists, and therapists to explore the connections between the body and the imagination. Overarching this exploration is an awareness of conscious usage of the voice. How does using the voice expressively become a conscious choice? And how is it possible to ingrain habits of healthy usage that are of optimal value to a speaker?\n\nFreeing the voice is a quest to release deeply rooted tensions in the body and surrounding the breath. This reduction of tension eases the mechanics of breathing, allows fuller resonance, diaphragmatic movement, and a supported flow of sound. The training and unrestricted shaping of articulators sharpens the ability of a speaker to shape words with precision and clarity and the ultimate goal is to attach this energy to the need to communicate with expressive intention. The repercussions of changes to this subtle process can be profound, with benefits to health, career, self-awareness, and relationship-building. The greatest benefit of all is achieved when consciously learned voice techniques become consistently ingrained as a speakers unconscious preference to make healthy, unconstrained, and expressive use of the voice.\n\nReferences Cited\n\n1 Linklater, Kristen.

Most people immediately imagine the nasty side of chemistry: poisons, toxic spills, leaking barrels of toxic waste, nuclear bombs, and/or smokestacks releasing who-knows-what into the atmosphere. No doubt, many of you are familiar with one of the symbols for poison on all household “chemicals.” The most familiar is probably the skull-and-crossbones, which appears on household products that are toxic when ingested. Unfortunately, many children associate this “Jolly Roger” symbol with pirates—and many children love pirates—so this particular symbol may often not be an effective deterrent. Because of children's affinity for pirates, the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh created a new symbol in the 1970, Mr. Yuk®, whose jaundiced face displays an unmistakable reaction to a very bad taste.\n\nSome of you may have specifically thought of derailed train cars spewing green fumes into the atmosphere. And off course, as everyone knows, all chemicals, particularly the really nasty ones, release green gas! Some of you may have thought of the characteristic mushroom cloud following a nuclear explosion, such as the bombing of Hiroshima. Some may have thought of the Bhopal disaster in India, when an accident at a chemical plant poisoned thousands of residents. And of course, many of you may have recalled smoke stacks releasing some sort of smoke into the atmosphere and thus polluting the environment. Ironically, what most people don’t realize is that all, or nearly all, of this “smoke” is actually just steam.\n\nSome less scrupulous people have seized upon this fear of all things chemical to either play pranks on the less scientifically literate or market their products with propaganda. A notable case of the former is the Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide,1 or DHMO, a site dedicated to getting viewers to sign their petition. This organization claims, among other things, that DHMO has the following dangers: death by inhalation, tissue damage, and generally events associated with disaster and destruction. They state that DHMO is used in nefarious places such as abortion clinics and nuclear plants, and is a critical ingredient in animal research, chemical warfare, and torture. The coalition claims that DHMO can be found in malignant tumors, toxic cleaning solvents, prisons, acid rain, industrial waste, and baby food. After reading through all of the terrible things that DHMO is associated with, one would naturally conclude that DHMO is supremely nasty stuff, and would be compelled to sign the petition and\n\nwonder why it has not been banned already. However, there is a critical piece of information missing. While everything this organization says about DHMO is true, it is not the entire truth. The scientifically literate would immediately recognize that DHMO is simply water, named with the frightening-sounding dihydrogen monoxide moniker. Once this fact is realized, it is easy to see that drowning, frostbite, and hurricanes are all associated with water—that water is involved in all human activities, be they good or bad. Then there are the marketing folks who use references to chemicals or science to sell products. From “scientifically formulated” cosmetic creams that are superior to their competitors to “chemical-free” products that are also superior to their competitors, advertisers manipulate the general public's lack of scientific literacy to sell their products.\n\nOf course, nothing other than a perfect vacuum can claim to be chemical-free. Even then, the vacuum must be contained somehow and that container is itself some kind of chemical. The controversy over the use of the term “chemical free” in marketing materials became so bad that in 2008 the Royal Society of Chemistry offered a million pound reward to anyone who could provide them with an authentic sample of a chemical-free product.” Of course, this challenge is impossible to meet since everything is made up of chemicals, including the seemingly harmless water. As Paracelsus stated, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison, only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.” For example, common household items that most people consider benign can be toxic in large enough doses. Water can even be toxic in excess. If one ingests more than 1.5 gallons of water all at once, then it is likely to be fatal. There was a case in the media a few years back where a mother of three participated in a radio contest called “Hold Your Wee for a Wii,”3 in which contestants drank huge amounts of water without urinating to win a Wii gaming system. Later that day, the woman died due to water toxicity. It is estimated that she drank over two gallons of water during the contest.\n\nSo, chemicals can be bad but we need to gain perspective. Chemical accidents and disasters gain quite a bit of press when they occur, but, as the table below illustrates, biological hazards give us much more to fear than do chemical hazards. The worst chemical disaster of all time was the Bhopal incident in 1984. Since then, about 20,000 people have died either from direct exposure or from long-term consequences. In contrast, the worst biological disaster, the Spanish Flu of I9I8, killed an estimated 20-100 million people in only six months. There are several other notable biological disasters that have also killed far more people than the Bhopal disaster and summarized in Table I. Thus, chemicals have received an undeserved bad rap.\n\nTABLE I. MAJOR CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DISASTERS.4\n\nChemical Disasters\n\nBiological Disasters\n\nThen there are the many chemicals that have changed the world for the better.\n\nThe invention of soap is probably the most important innovation, saving countless through the mere recognition of the importance of hygiene for preventing the spread of disease. Antibiotics, too, have saved numerous lives once a disease is contracted. Only a century ago the life expectancy was half of what it is now, and we owe this largely to the development of chemicals that prevent or treat disease. Other notable chemicals are polymers and silicon products, which enabled the digital revolution we are experiencing to occur. Another notable chemical contribution was the development of birth control pills, which made equality of the sexes a reality. Reproductive control could not have occurred otherwise.\n\nWhile chemicals are not bad, in and of themselves, some methods used to create the desirable ones do more harm to the environment than is necessary. This is where “green chemistry” becomes important. Green chemistry is a philosophy of considering the environment when designing reactions. The EPA has embraced the “12 Principles of Green Chemistry,” listed below and originated by Paul Anastas.0\n\nPrevent waste\n\nDesign safer chemicals and products\n\nDesign less hazardous chemical synthesis\n\nUse renewable feedstocks\n\nUse catalysts\n\nAvoid derivatives\n\nMaximize atom economy\n\nUse safer solvents and reaction conditions\n\nIncrease energy efficiency\n\nDesign chemicals and products to degrade after use\n\nAnalyze in real time\n\nMinimize accident potential\n\nIn this talk, the green chemistry method I will discuss addresses Principles I,\n\n3,4, 8, and 9 most directly, although all 12 principles are addressed to some extent. The innovation my group recently made involved the synthesis of a group of compounds known as iminės, which are essential in many industries and are traditionally synthesized under extremely non-green conditions. The reason we wanted to explore iminės is the variety of transformations possible for them. To demonstrate the utility of iminės, Figure I shows a few examples of transformations that have iminės as their starting material. These examples are but a few of all the transformations possible, thus, a more effective and green imine synthesis would have significant environmental and economic impact.\n\nA traditional imine synthesis often involves boiling the reacting compounds in toluene, a petroleum-based solvent, for at least four hours in the presence of some method to remove water as it is formed. The general reaction is shown below. Reactants (starting materials) are on the left and products are on the right. The arrows pointing both ways indicate that the reaction is in equilibrium, meaning that reactants are not fully converted to products.\n\nLe Châtelier s Principle, a concept taught in first-year chemistry and used frequently from then on, states that an equilibrium reaction may be shifted toward products by either adding a large excess of one of the reactants or by removing one of the products as it is formed. Since the reactants in the imine synthesis tend to be somewhat expensive and it would be difficult to remove the one used in excess, the traditional way to force the reaction toward the desired imine product is to remove the water. Indeed, two main methods of water removal are common. One method involves a complicated assembly of glassware called a Dean-Stark trap. When an imine synthesis involves boiling in a solvent such as toluene, the water boils off along with the toluene and then condenses and drips into a trap that acts as a “fat” separator. The water collects over the course of the reaction and can be measured using gradations on the trap. Since the theoretical amount of water can be calculated, the reaction is presumed to be complete once the theoretical amount of water has been collected. Molecular sieves are another option for removing water and often used in combination with DCM. Molecular sieves are small beads that have extraordinarily tiny pores throughout them that trap small molecules while larger molecules, which do not fit in the pores, are unaffected. They essentially act like a water “roach motel”—water gets in but it cannot get back out.\n\nSo, before I begin the discussion of our method, I need to give you a little background in synthetic chemistry. Please note the times in parentheses. There are four basic steps in a synthetic process:\n\nGeneral synthetic method:\n\nSynthesis: reaction conditions (e.g., boiling in a solvent)\n\nIsolation: removal of the majority of undesired materials (e.g., solvent removal)\n\nPurification: removal of remaining impurities (e.g., unreacted starting materials)\n\nAnalysis: determination of quality and quantity of product Quality is determined by melting/boiling point and instrumental techniques.\n\nQuantity is determined by the percent of the theoretical amount actually formed.\n\nTraditional imine method:\n\nSynthesis: (4-6 hr)Mix reactants in 50-100 mL solvent Boil for 4-6 hr Remove water (Dean-Stark or molecular sieves)\n\nIsolation: (minutes to hours), Remove solvent, usually under vacuum (heat often necessary)\n\nPurification (recrystallization if solid or distillation if liquid): (minutes to hours)\n\nAnalysis (mp, spectroscopy, yield) (< I hr)\n\nThe solvent in a traditional synthesis, as mentioned before, is usually a petroleum-based solvent, such as toluene, or a halogenated organic solvent, such as dichloromethane. Some common traditional solvents and their characteristics are listed in Table 2. In contrast, characteristics of greener organic solvents are listed in Table 3. The information included boiling point (bp), the time for biodégradation, the time for half of the material to degrade in the atmosphere, the National Fire Protection Association rating (health risk, flammability, and reactivity; higher numbers are more harmful), hazards (carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic), and the cost per liter.\n\nTable 3. Properties of greener organic solvents.\n\nEthyl lactate is a naturally occurring compound round in wine, chicken, and fruits. It is renewable, meaning it is not derived from petroleum-based resources, but rather, can be made from lactic acid (milk) and ethanol (corn). It is readily biodegradable and is even approved as an FDA-food additive, found in strawberry milkshakes and just about anything that has a fruity and/or butterscotch flavor. The use of ethyl lactate as a solvent in organic synthesis is fairly recent.\n\nIt is most commonly used these days to clean electronics. Lactic acid naturally occurs in milk and cheese (and muscles sore from exercise). It is also renewable and biodegradable and is a flavor additive for many foods, such as candy, olives, cheese, and bread products. Limonene is naturally found in citrus peels and is a by-product of orange juice production. It is also renewable and biodegradable, most commonly used in citrus household cleaners. Limonene is being studied for its role in cancer prevention.6\n\nWe focused on ethyl lactate for imine synthesis because of research we had performed earlier. The first green solvent we chose was ethyl acetate because it has similar physical properties to toluene, which is one of the most common solvents used to make iminės. Ethyl acetate is renewable and biodegradable, formed from the reaction of acetic acid (vinegar) and ethanol. What we found was the reactions produced excellent quality crystals at room temperature, albeit with terrible yields. We then tried ethanol, which produced excellent yield but poor quality crystals. What we needed was a solvent that combined the properties of both in the hopes of obtaining both excellent quality and excellent yield. Of course, we realized that the exact opposite of what we wanted might occur. Ethyl lactate seemed a logical choice since it shared characteristics of both compounds as shown below.\n\nOur imine method:\n\nSynthesis: (<I0 min)Mix reactants in 5 mL ethyl lactate with 0-40% water Let sit at room temperature for up to ten minutes.\n\nIsolation: (<I5 min), Add brine (salt water), filter, rinse with water Air dry to remove the residual water.\n\nPurification: none necessary\n\nAnalysis (mp, spectroscopy, yield) (< I hr)\n\nTable 4. Comparison of our imine method to recent “green” methods.\n\nTABLE 4. COMPARISON OF OUR IMINE METHOD TO RECENT “GREEN” METHODS.\n\nTheirs\n\nOurs\n\nOur results were astounding! We found that nearly every combination of starting materials we tried (and we tried 17 combinations) resulted in excellent quality and excellent yield in a much more benign and much less energy-intensive system than any previously published. For comparisons, see Table 4 above for our head-to-head comparison with recent “green” imine syntheses. To understand the comparison, the higher the percent yield, the better. The maximum yield one can achieve in a “perfect” world is 100%. All of the yields below are comparable or better than those previously published. Melting points are used to assess purity. The lower the melting point, the less pure the compound is, thus, higher melting points are better. I should point out that all of the literature methods compared in this talk are for compounds that were purified by recrystallization. In contrast, our products were analyzed without purification. Note that our melting points are comparable to or higher than the previously published methods. The methods used in the literature procedures are described below.\n\nThe Guzen7 method used ethanol as a solvent and silica as a catalyst. Reactions were sonicated (energy from sound) for 5—10 minutes. If you have ever had jewelry cleaned professionally, you have likely seen (and heard) a sonicator. Even though the synthesis conditions are largely green, the benefit is offset by the use of DCM in the purification steps. Our reaction took a little less time but required no catalyst or energy input.\n\nThe Schmeyers0 method used solventless conditions. Instead, they ground the two reactants together and let the mixture sit anywhere from 2—120 hrs, depending on combination, usually without any additional energy input. The third example in Table 4 was one of the examples that required heat along with a significant amount of time. The Schmeyers method is limited to reactions in which both starting materials are solids. Many potential combinations of starting materials are liquid, as in the Guzen and Tanaka examples in the table. In addition, the water that was generated through the Schmeyers method was removed under vacuum at 80°C for an unspecified amount of time, though this procedure is usually an overnight procedure. Thus, a significant amount of energy was used to remove water. Our method was much more efficient. The reactions were complete in minutes, in one case the Schmeyers 24 hr with heat compound was complete within 3 minutes using our method. In addition to the time savings, our yields were comparable and our melting points were comparable or better. Plus, we allowed our water to air dry instead of using an energy-intensive method to remove it. This was facilitated by the fact that our products were crystalline, rather than powder, and thus had less surface area for water to adhere.\n\nThe Tanaka9 method used water as a solvent and called for mechanical stirring for one hour, which requires a specialized apparatus. Note that our reaction was faster, had comparable yield, and significantly better quality.\n\nAgain, I should emphasize that all of the literature melting points in Table 4 were purified—ours were not. The ability to avoid extra purification steps results in both a significant time savings as well as an enormous savings in the number and quantity of chemicals involved. At this point we have synthesized 17 iminės, which are now published in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Green Chemistry.1'-' All examples were complete within 10 minutes and all but one were conducted at room temperature. (One starting material required heat to keep it dissolved long enough for the reaction to occur.) To give you an appreciation for the simplicity of our method, please see the video at my website.11 The only editing I did in this video was to remove three minutes of nothing apparent happening. The video shows a flask containing a liquid (ethyl lactate and water with p-toluidine) with a black light situated above the flask. Then, a student adds another liquid containing ethyl lactate and water with salicylaldéhyde) and gently swirls the flask to mix the contents. The flask is allowed to sit undisturbed from that point. The contents of the flask appear black immediately after the two reactants are combined. Shortly after the three minutes was cut, a yellow glow appears in the center of the flask and quickly spreads until the entire contents\n\nare glowing yellow. This glow arises from the fluorescent imine product as the reaction progresses. The entire process if finished in just over four minutes.\n\nWe are currently testing the breadth of our method by evaluating more diverse combinations of starting materials. We are also developing green methods for converting these iminės into other useful materials. This semester,\n\nBrendan Walker is making compounds known as aziridines, which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. He is investigating the use of lactic acid as an alternative catalyst to more toxic and expensive options. Eli Spina, Caitlin Heuberger, Miyeon Presky, and Jessica Rodriguez are working on azetidines, which are analogs of beta-lactam antibiotics, which include the penicillin family. Azetidines do not contain the “Achilles Heel” of the beta-lactam antibiotics that many bacteria can exploit and thus may be an effective strategy for defeating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to state first that we have awesome students! This breakthrough would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of my group members. Their work led to the discovery that food additives can be used as effective solvents for a large number of compounds. And, as advice to other junior faculty, try to combine your teaching and research interests. With our teaching loads, this integration is extremely important for both productivity and innovation. This project originally started as an attempt to design a green chemistry experiment for one of my courses and resulted in a significant contribution to my students, chemical education, and synthetic organic chemistry. I also encourage you to think outside the box. Question conventional wisdom and try to improve on it. Had I blindly adhered to over a century of conventional wisdom and accepted that water must be removed in this particular reaction for it to work well, I never would have considered adding water to make the reaction more effective. Just because something has been done a certain way for a long time does not mean it is the best way.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to express gratitude to the BLONDES (Building a Legacy of Outstanding New Developments and Excellence in Science), my research group for all their hard work. I thank the Faculty Research Grant program for the funding to begin this project and the Dreyfus Foundation for partial funding.\n\nReferences\n\nI Way, T. Dibydrogcii monoxide research division.

Payne English\n\nAbstract:\n\nAt the time of his death in I92I, John Burroughs (born in Roxbury, New York in 1837) was Americas most beloved nature writer, a best-selling author whose friends and admirers included Walt Whitman, Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison. The popularity of his work encouraged his publisher, Houghton Mifflin, to publish or reissue the work of several other nature writers, including that of Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. Since 1992, SUNY Oneonta has hosted the biannual John Burroughs Nature Writing Conference & Seminar (“Sharp Eyes”), which honors the influence of Burroughs on American nature writing. The scope of the conference is not limited solely to Burroughs, however, as each year the writers and scholars in attendance focus on a theme of significance to modern nature writers and scholars of literary environmentalism. The theme of the 2010 conference is “Old Lessons for a New Millennium” and will examine the work of writers who contributed to the early conservation movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and the work of contemporary writers who are influencing the development of early twenty-first century environmentalism. This presentation will give a brief overview of Burroughs’s life and work and introduce some of the topics that will be addressed at the 2010 “Sharp Eyes” conference.\n\nThis year, from June 7—II, SUNY Oneonta will once again host the “Sharp Eyes” conference, the sixth in the John Burroughs Nature Writing Conference & Seminar series. The first two conferences (held in 1992 and 1994) were organized and directed by my former colleague Charlotte Walker, and in 2004,\n\nI resuscitated the event, which has been held biannually ever since, including a “guest hosting” by Vassar College in 2008. The 2010 conference at Oneonta is affiliated with the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment, an international organization that now has well over 1000 members—and through their help and support, this year we will have presenters from all over the United States and Canada, and from as far away as Singapore. Two collections of essays from the conference have been published.\n\nWhat I’d like to do first, is to talk a little bit about John Burroughs, the writer whose work served as the inspiration for many in the conservation of movement of the late I9th- and early 20th centuries—and well as the inspiration for this conference series held in his honor. Burroughs was a local boy—he was born on a dairy farm in nearby Roxbury, NY, Delaware County, on April 3, 1837. The seventh of Chauncey and Amy Kelly Burroughs’s ten children, was a bookish, thoughtful child who was considered a bit of an oddity by his family. His father Chauncey was a Baptist fundamentalist, who harbored a quiet terror that his son might become—a Methodist minister. There was no need to worry about that, however, for even as a boy Burroughs turned away from the religion of revelation espoused by his father. As Burroughs later recalled, his father was a good man, though narrow-minded and bigoted in his religious views, and wrote about an incident he observed as a boy: “I remember when a mere lad hearing him pray in the hog-pen. It was a time of unusual religious excitement for him, no doubt; I heard, and ran away, knowing it was not for me to hear” (Barrus, OFJB 56).\n\nWhen Burroughs was just 17 he left home, taking a series of positions as a rural schoolteacher in places in upstate New York like High Falls, Olive (where he met his wife-to-be, Ursula North) and even as far afield as Buffalo Grove, Illinois. About this time he began reading Emerson, Ending in the great philosophers work “a revolutionary, natural theology that was the solvent of encrusted forms and traditions” (Renehan 46). He began to write his own essays, but his early efforts were so derivative of Emerson that when he submitted “Expression,” a transcendentalist inspired essay on understanding the universe to The Atlantic Monthly in I860, James Russell Lowell, the magazines editor, refused to print the article until he carefully verified that Burroughs had not plagiarized an obscure piece from Emerson (Barrus, LL 1:52). This experience was partly responsible for the turn toward nature writing that Burroughs took thereafter. To counterbalance Emersons influence on his style and subject matter, Burroughs began to devote his writing to outdoor themes and the familiar rural landscape of his youth; and to cultivate a clear, straightforward style grounded in the concrete and the specific.\n\nThis change of approach was supported by the writer who became Burroughs’s second great literary influence, Walt Whitman. In 1864, the 27 year old\n\nBurroughs took a job as a treasury clerk in Washington, D.C. He met Whitman, who was working as a nurse in the great military hospitals set up in and about the nations capitol, and the two soon became fast friends. In 1867, Burroughs wrote his first book, entitled Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person—which was probably co-written, or at least heavily edited, by Whitman himself.\n\nIt was Burroughs second book, however, Wake-Rohn (I87I), that established the upward trajectory of Burroughs’s literary career. The collection of natural history essays, largely composed of vivid memories and imagery from his Catskill boyhood—and, paradoxically, primarily written while he set in front of a vault at the Treasury Department—was greeted by enthusiastic reviews. As William Dean Howells (one of the deans of American literature during that period) wrote in an unsigned review that appeared in August I87I edition of The Atlantic Monthly wrote: “It is in every way an uncommon book that [Burroughs] has given us; fresh, wholesome, sweet, and full of a gentle and thoughtful spirit; a beautiful book” (254).\n\nOver the next fifty years, Burroughs published hundreds of essays in the leading periodicals of time—most dealing with natural history, but many touching on diverse topics such as philosophy, literary criticism, religion, etc. Hundreds of thousands of copies of his books were sold (there were about I Уг million in print at the time of his death in I92I), and his popularity was so immense that it inspired the publisher, Houghton Mifflin, to reissue or publish for the first time the work of other nature writers, such as Henry Thoreau and John Muir. He was honored with numerous awards, including a gold medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in I9I6, and honorary degrees from Yale, Colgate, and the University of Georgia. In his later years his rural retreats in the Hudson Valley (“Slabsides”) and Roxbury (“Woodchuck Lodge”) became popular pilgrimage sites for nature lovers and admirers of “the Sage of Slabsides.”\n\nIncluded among Burroughs’s friends and admirers were John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone. Ford was an ardent admirer of Burroughs, and bought some of the property near Woodchuck Lodge that had once been part of the old Burroughs Farm, to present to his friend as a gift. He also presented Burroughs with a Model T—which the old bird watcher promptly backed through the back wall of his barn. Ford, Edison, Firestone, and Burroughs also went on a well-publicized “camping trip” in 1914, that was probably one of the oddest experiences in Burroughs’ long experience in nature—replete with a caravan of Model T s, servants, and luxuries of all sorts.\n\nIt was, however, the connection to Roosevelt and to Muir that had the most profound and lasting consequences for American environmental history. While Burroughs was not as politically active as his two friends were, he was a key figure in the coalescence of forces that resulted in the first great era of environmental reform—the conservation movement of the Progressive Era. In 1903 he toured Yellowstone National Park with President Roosevelt (TR then went on to tour Yosemite with Muir), and was visited at Slabsides by the President that summer—a visit that, Burroughs said delightedly, must have really steamed his wealthy neighbors across the Hudson, the Vanderbilts, et al.\n\nDespite his reluctance to wade directly into the political fray over conservation, Burroughs’s indirect contribution to the cause was immense. It was he who attracted a mass audience for nature—an audience that was without precedent in the United States, and that was crucial to the development of political support for conservation programs and legislation. There is little doubt that Burroughs’s nature essays don’t have the same rhetorical bite that those of Thoreau or Muir do—but as biographer Edward Renehan writes, “there is one important thing that redeems Burroughs. In essay after essay, he tried to instill a new, modern element of faith into the faithless decades of the Gilded Age” (4). This faith— “the faith of a naturalist” as Burroughs calls it, seeks to reconciled modern scientific knowledge with the human longing for a spiritual side to life. As he wrote in an essay entitled “The Faith of a Naturalist”:\n\nAmid the decay of creeds, love of nature has high religious value. This has saved many persons in this world—saved them from mammon-worship, and from the frivolity and insincerity of the crowd.. .It has made them contented at home wherever they are in nature—in the house not made with hands. This house is their church, and the rocks and the hills are the altars, and the creed is written in the flowers of the field and the sands of the shore.. .Every walk to the woods is a religious rite, every bath in the stream is a saving ordinance.. .It is not an insurance policy underwritten by a bishop or priest; it is not even a faith; it is a love, an enthusiasm, a consecration to natural truth” (Accepting the Universe II6-II7).\n\nBurroughs died in I92I while on a train ride back to his New York home from California. His final words—“Are we home yet?”—were a remarkably fitting coda to the career of a writer so closely identified with his native Catskill region. In many of his essays, Burroughs imaginatively explores the woods and fields of home, and in so doing he transcends the local and examines the universal theme of our relation with nature and our native landscape. Burroughs’s emphasis on “place” and the local now seems modern once again, as the current interest in bioregionalism, locally grown produce and other foods, and many other such issues indicates.\n\nThe 2010 conference—“Old Lessons for a New Millennium: Nature Writing and Environmentalism in the 21st Century”— will focus on the work of writers, like Burroughs, who contributed to the early conservation movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the work of contemporary writers who are exerting an influence on the development of early twenty-first century environmentalism. As noted in this years Call for Papers we were looking for presentations on the influence of modern writers such as Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Bill McKibben, Rick Bass, Barry Lopez, and Terry Tempest Williams on the current environmental debate; notions of “deep” versus “shallow” ecology; nature writings role in times of environmental crises (such as nuclear proliferation, overpopulation, global climate change); fostering the “sense of wonder” and environmentalism in children’s literature; and questions relating to sustainability and the development of a green society.\n\nI’d like to close with a quote by Burroughs, the genius loci of our Catskill region: “Look underfoot. You are always nearer to the true sources of your power than you think. The lure of the distant and the difficult is deceptive. The great opportunity is where you are. Don’t despise your own place and hour. Every place is the center of the world.”\n\nThe Nonverbal Persuasion of Ritual Rhythms\n\nJoshua Frye Communication Arts\n\nRitual Rhythm and Healing\n\nHumans have long associated rhythmic movement with power. Whenever movement occurs, “time is consumed, energy is released, and space is covered” (Sehon & O’Brien, 1951). The Greek God Helios and the Roman God Apollo’s chariot moved across the sky in predictable ways. Measurable movement was the source of their power. To this day the association between movement and power continues. There is an important distinction to be made, however, between deliberate rhythmic movement and uncontrollable rhythmic movement in terms of the power source. Historically, convulsions and epileptic “fits” or “spells” were considered a sign of an individual’s giftedness in virtue of their being visited by some superior cosmic energy or force. For example, in some art critic’s and epileptologist’s interpretation of Raphael’s last painting La Transfigurazionc, there is a meaningful—indeed transcendent—connection between Christ’s transfiguration on Mt. Tabor and the epileptic boy whom in biblical times, would have been believed to be possessed by demons (Janz, 1986). In other words, the human perception of a spontaneous, uncontrollable bodily rhythm correlated with mysterious, and often damaging or evil power. Over time, cultural rituals have developed that seem to try to trap, capture, or instigate this experience of being seized by an outside force. Interestingly, instead of erratic, uncontrollable rhythm, the use of equidistant vibrations or regular rhythmic patters, were perceived to be healing instead of damaging.\n\nTrances and hypnotisms are both types of ritual performative states during a shamanic healing session that are deliberately brought about through rhythmic movements of energy. The shaman uses his voice and rhythmic instruments such as drums and maracas to create a state of mind which is more conducive to influence and suggestion. The shaman uses his voice to chant and oftentimes this is used in conjunction with a drum to construct a repetitious, monophonic vibration which is used to either put the shaman in a trance or hypnotize his patient in order for bodily healing to take effect (Rogers, 1982). Relaxation, light, and deep hypnosis are all physical states created by the nonverbal persuasive power of rhythm wherein verbal messages may take root and influence healing of some kind.\n\nOne does not have to look only to exotic anthropological studies of shamanism and ancient belief-systems to locate the persuasive use of rhythm in healing.\n\nIn modern western traditions of healing the relationships between ritualized rhythm and bodily effect can be glimpsed through the practice of alphagenic programming. According to clinical psychologist Anthony Zaffuto (1974), ritualizing meditative or yogic practice whereby one mentally controls and slows down their pulse rate and breathing can help an individual manipulate their brain wave patterns. The goal is to enter alpha or lower-frequency theta rhythms and subsequently regulate the body. Consequences of ritually practicing this either in a group setting or alone can lead to beneficial health outcomes such as decreases in metabolic rates, day-to-day anxiety, minor physical irritations, increases in stress-coping ability, reflex rate, concentration ability, learning capacity, and relaxation ability.\n\nAnother example of how rhythm is linked to the nonverbal persuasion of healing can be found in osteopathy literature. According to numerous researchers (Frymann, I97I; Michael & Retzlaff, 1975; Upledger & Karni, 1975), the movements of the human cranium can be used to diagnose and treat certain illnesses. Osteopathic doctors (D.O.) that practice craniosacral therapy are trained to develop a very fine sense of touch in order to be able to detect very subtle rhythmic shape changes in bodily tissue that they then compare to what they call the “ideal rhythm”. The differences between an individuals cranial rhythm and the ideal rhythm will assist the D.O. in evaluation and treatment. Osteopathic practice is controversial and D.O.s claim that this low-amplitude pulsating of the cranial plates is an involuntary primal movement of energy whose rhythmic patterns can reveal what stresses and tensions your body is carrying, as well as diagnose the overall health of the individual. Next, religions use of the nonverbal persuasion of rhythm is discussed to reveal its application in ceremony to strengthen doctrinal adherence and shape perceptions of time.\n\nRitual Rhythm and Religion\n\nIt is not surprising that the persuasive rhythm of dance was used early in the history of mankind to reach common ecstatic experience, in which especially the lost union with others.. .could be relieved (Porteus, I93I, p. 22)\n\nIn one traditional Ojibway dance ceremony rhythm operates as nonverbal persuasion analogously to the way the conditional syllogism operates in verbal persuasion. A conditional syllogism is an argument that takes an “if-then” form, employs a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. For example,\n\nMajor Premise: If the United States regulates the market, then the market will succeed.\n\nMinor Premise: The United States will regulate the market.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the market will succeed.\n\nIn the nonverbal realm of rhythm, this kind of logic is paralleled. Take, for example, this description of an Ojibway ceremony: “Three times the Anishnabeg chief tapped the drum lightly. On the fourth stroke, the drummers themselves joined, the singers’ voices carried across the sunlit meadow, and the dancers began anew.” In this example the rest of the drummers knew the conditional (rhythmic) formula: If the Chief taps his drum thrice, the drummers shall join on the fourth beat. In other words, during this ceremonial ritual, after the chief has tapped his drum three times, the rest of the drummers were to join in, following the beat introduced by their leader. After the drummers collectively converged through rhythm, the singers also joined in. After the singers, the dancers began again. Thus repeating a cyclical rhythm found so often in Native American ritual (Lake, 1983). This ritual practice of cyclical rhythm performance symbolically enabled the individual members of the tribe as well as the whole tribe to purge time before that enacted moment and begin anew.\n\nRepetition is an effective technique of persuasion. This has been demonstrated most obviously in well-known advertising campaigns. In terms of jingles, slogans, color schemes, and images, the consistent presentation of a certain message in a certain way will eventually wear down even the strongest of wills or intellects. In the nonverbal realm of rhythmic persuasion, this technique of repetition may be most easily apprehended in the Roman Catholic Church use of the intermittent volley between standing, sitting, and kneeling during mass. The protestant faiths also manifest a similar approach to ritual rhythmic persuasion in the form of the litany. The regular collective oratorical rehearsal of prayers and creeds leaves an imprint on the worshipers. I contend that perhaps even more powerful than the doctrinal content inherent of these oral rehearsals in keeping congregants identified and faithful is the repetitious rhythmic quality of these bodily actions thus creating an attitude complimentary to the reciprocal relation between word and body in these ritual events within the ritual of church going itself. There is tessellated rhythm in most traditional religious ceremony. Next, the institution of education is discussed with an eye toward various educational philosophies and learning exercises.\n\nRitual Rhythm and Education\n\nFor, after all, the aim of education is to do away with the harmful and useless habits, to encourage those that are beneficial and profitable. Brain, nerves, and muscles ought to thrill with an intense vital stream, whose function it is to transmit sensations, emotions, and ideas. The power that sends forth this stream and regulates its output is rhythm (Jaques-Delacroze, 1930)\n\nElizabeth Sehon, professor of physical education at the University of California believes that “one of the strongest and most joyous urges of man is that of responding to rhythm” (I95I, p. 3). Because human beings since conception are caught up in and respond naturally to all kinds of rhythmic patterns (in nature, in their bodies, in daily activity, and in relationship to other humans), educational practice has long made use of formalizing rhythm. When done effectively, rhythm in education can help children release tensions, improve large motor skills, expand concepts, shape discipline, respond to stimuli in structured ways, and learn patterns of behavior.\n\nIn educational settings, educators prompt both locomotive and axial bodily movement in order to accomplish one or more of the above educational objectives. Oftentimes in elementary education, the rhythmic activity lessons that are built into the curriculum are a type of nature mimesis. Enacting the rising and setting of the sun or a tree swaying in the wind employs axial body motions of squatting, standing, bending, swaying, and the motion of the arms. The bodily attitude that is fostered for the child is one of being connected to nature by virtue of rhythmic understanding. The rhythmic diversity of nature is used as a template to teach the child an embodied form of communication that has wide-ranging potential to express differing kinds and degrees of power and emotion. The reason these educational lessons in rhythm are rituals is because students are exposed to these lessons in a patterned fashion. Certain times of day and days of the week are devoted to classes such as physical education and music where these forms of kinesthetic, rhythmic persuasion are integrated into the curriculum.\n\nWaldorf educators mimetically follow the variations in human respiration (e.g., inhaling and exhaling) to structure a specific lesson and an entire days learning. Inbreathing exercises and lessons allow children to recoil into a contemplative place where they can focus on artwork, sustained language or literature lessons, or\n\ncollective storytelling. Outbreathing exercises and lessons are rhythmically upbeat activities where children engage in locomotion to explore space with their bodies in time measured by the teacher.\n\nAnother example of rhythms nonverbal persuasion in the arena of education can be seen in the use of nursery rhymes. According to Burland (1972) many English nursery rhymes are echoes of old chants. Early childhood educators Barbara Patterson and Pamela Bradley identify nursery rhyme songs like “Here we go round the Mulberry Bush” as important domestic rituals that supply strength, form, and security for children's daily experiences. The use of rhythmic song and verse in domestic rituals during early childhood helps to foster a child’s sense of the world as a stable, predictable place where hourly, daily, and weekly routines order their experience. Through the rhythmic use of such songs and nursery rhymes attached to domestic chores and tasks, children internalize the message these rhythms foster and develop world-views and perceptions that will help them see anything outside the ordinary as an anomaly, not the norm. Last, the use of rhythmic persuasion fits seamlessly into common political rituals to either strengthen or weaken the subjects’ will.\n\nRitual Rhythm and Politics\n\nAs far as the persuasive use of rhythm in political rituals is concerned, there are two prime examples I’d like to address. First is the military use of drum, bulge, and march to discipline troops and prepare them to respond uniformly to orders. The use of the drums and bugles are only complimentary to the marching. Marching is a very basic form of nonverbal persuasion. Hypnotists recognize that the effects of the constant thump, thump, thump of the feet in collectivity render the marcher more easily controllable by those who would control them.\n\nIn the case of organized militaries, marching is accompanied by percussive instruments to amplify the effect of the marching’s repetitious monotony. In the case of organized militaries, marchers are instructed that marching practice will make them better soldiers. Marching can be used to train soldiers because individuals are more receptive to the ideological indoctrination that occurs during the marching drills. Although marching as training is used to shape individuals into obedient soldiers, the marching is more important as practice for passive acceptance of orders during combat when otherwise survival mechanisms may interrupt the maintenance of order and successful execution of the military strategy. The most notorious of all organized military marching is the German Nazis. According to Bosmajian (1968) understanding Nazi persuasion is\n\nincomplete without going beyond oratory, radio, and press to nonverbal communication such as symbols and marching. In particular, the marching impressed the mood and affected the soul of the marcher.\n\nThe military use of marching in Nazi Germany reached new depths in the history of mass brainwashing with the help of the nonverbal persuasion of rhythm. According to one Nazi propagandist, the marching helped “participation of the individual in the being and becoming of the whole” (Bosmajian, 1968).\n\nThe individual loses his own identity and is subsumed by the collective identity of the army. When the Nazi marchers added the technique of goose-stepping, the persuasive function of the movement molded the individual soldiers to be overcome by “discipline, unanimity, solidarity, and rhythm of the marching” (p. 19). As Bosmajian said, “he who marched succumbed to even stronger influences; there was the unifying rhythm created by a feeling of community” (p. 19). Thus the marching functioned to subvert individual identity, perform ritual self-display of aggrandizement, and create social unification until at last the Nazi, like all participants in such non-verbally persuasive rhythms “moves according to one law and one time” (Gross, 1897, p. 20).\n\nThe second example of rhythm as persuasion in politics is the use of music in social movement protest. It has been demonstrated that rhythm is capable of producing light hypnosis (Irvine & Kirpatrick, I97I). Furthermore, Stewart et al. (2007) argue that because of the effect of light hypnosis on social movement participants, when combined with the body’s physiological responses, individuals may be more susceptible to rhetorical commands issued by a protest leader or fortified to face threats of violent repression from state authorities.\n\nOf Health, Happiness, Discipline, and Liberation\n\nIn charting the ritual uses of rhythm as an agent of nonverbal persuasion this paper discussed how religions, politics, education, and healing all institutionalize patterned sound and movement in order to achieve their desired ends. Both obscure and conventional political, educational, religious, and healing traditions and institutions weave the nonverbal persuasion of rhythm into their practices. The effects of such persuasive efforts include diverse somatic and psychological experiences such as nature mimesis, expelling evil spirits, enhanced bodily control, concentration ability, sense of security, temporal renewal, religious devotion, social unification, propaganda, and brainwashing.\n\nBurke (1984) claimed that “words and bodies act in reciprocal relation”. If this is so, how much more might bodies and rhythms act reciprocally? It is common knowledge among communication scholars that the nonverbal accounts for as much as ninety percent of a messages intent and effect. Rhythm is a neglected but significant aspect of nonverbal persuasion. Because this essay has argued there are good reasons to believe the human body influenced by ritualized rhythm makes the mind more manipulable, it may not be acceptable to categorize human bodies squarely in the realm of (nonsymbolic) motion as conventional physics and biology purport. Furthermore, it is overly limiting to focus persuasion research on cognitive processes and structures.\n\nThe conceptual charting that I have developed in this paper is the persuasive function of rhythm in rituals. Rhythm is a powerful agent of nonverbal persuasion and influence on human beings—the symbol-using, story-telling animal. Rhythm in ritual settings can be used to manipulate the human body, which responds symbolically to stimuli, to express a wide variety of emotionally-charged actions and to strengthen a belief-system or reaffirm adherence to a doctrinal ideology.\n\nReferences\n\nBosmajian, H.

Kick Sociology & Anthropology - North Carolina State University\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper considers three macro-sociological theories that attempt to explain biodiversity loss. The first is human ecology, which is mainly concerned with the effects of population size; the second is ecological modernization, which focuses on the strength of democracy to solve environmental problems; and the third is political economy, which argues that the global capitalist system of stratification between countries creates and perpetuates environmental inequality with poor nations shouldering burdens such as biodiversity loss. Results mainly support human ecological and political economic hypotheses. Support is not found for ecological modernization theory. Implications are considered with respect to policy making and state environmentalism.\n\nThis paper applies a macro-comparative sociological perspective to the study of biodiversity loss, which is defined as the loss of variation within and among species both within and among ecosystems. To a large extent, biodiversity loss is thought to be primarily caused by humans, as the natural rate of loss is believed to be a fraction of the current rate that is being empirically observed. Because of this fact, scholars are examining the causal mechanisms that link human activity and impact to biodiversity loss. Proximate causes are theorized to be the sheer size and growth of the human population on the planet, the expansion of the population into biologically diverse ecosystems, and the increasing level of human consumption that is more resource intensive. More distant causal mechanisms are theorized to be the result of global economic processes and the uneven distribution of environmental problems across nations. In less developed countries that are unable to afford the “luxury” of preserving natural resources for their own sake, there is a growing tendency to use these resources—e.g., timber and agricultural products that require the clearing of biologically diverse areas— as a means for gaining a more favorable economic position in the global economy.\n\nIn addition, there is a potential for national and international policies to limit\n\nor reverse ecologically destructive practices that are contributing to biodiversity loss. The impetus for such policies is thought to be driven by international and national organizations, and the effectiveness of such policies is believed to be adequate. Each of the above mentioned causal mechanisms can be discovered in the context of three competing theories that will be outlined below. After discussing these theories, we will present the Endings of an empirical analysis that examines biodiversity loss by nation.\n\nExplaining Biodiversity Loss: Three Theories\n\nHuman Ecology\n\nArguments that posit that population growth and size are the primary causal mechanisms driving anthropogenic biodiversity loss come from the human ecological theoretical perspective. In sociology, this approach originated with classical ecologists (e.g., Park and Burgess I92I) and neo-orthodox ecologists (Duncan I96I, Schnore 1965, Hawley 1973, Ehrlich and Holdren 1971), and has been applied more specifically to environmental issues in the new human ecology perspective (e.g., Dunlap and Catton 1979). Currently, the most relevant manifestation of this perspective can be found in the IPAT model (Commoner, 1972; Ehrlich & Holdren, I97I; Holdren & Ehrlich, 1974) that suggests that environmental impact (I) is a multiplicative function of population (P), affluence (A), and technological development (T). Ehrlich and Holdren (I97I) were particularly concerned with effects of population, making them part of the Malthusian tradition, while Commoner (1972) was more concerned with technology’s deleterious effects.\n\nAn alternate version of the IPAT model that allows for empirical testing is STIRPAT (i.e., STochastic estimation of Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) (York et ah, 2003a, b), which shares the same theoretical position but makes a methodological adjustment. The STIRPAT model has been applied to analyses of the impact of population and/or affluence on deforestation (Shandra 2005), carbon dioxide emissions (Dietz & Rosa,\n\n1997), methane emissions (York et ah, 2003b), and the overall ecological footprint of nations (Dietz, Rosa, & York, 2007; York et ah, 2003a). Findings from these analyses demonstrate population and the correlates of modernity and technology (e.g., urbanism and affluence) are important factors in determining environmental impacts, with population being a consistent force behind various forms of environmental degradation. From this we hypothesize the biodiversity loss will increase with greater population, affluence, and technology.\n\nEcological Modernization\n\nAs opposed to the IPAT/STIRPAT models discussed above, which suggest that economic growth happens in proportion to environmental impact, the ecological modernization framework (e.g., Christoff 1996; Cohen 1999; Mol 1995, 2001; Mol and Spaargaren 2000; Spaargaren, Mol, and Buttel 2000) argues that environmental improvements and economic growth can happen simultaneously. With advanced modernization comes a form of ecological rationality, in which it becomes both economically and ecologically desirable to engage in “green” business practices. There is some debate within the ecological modernization perspective as to how this comes about. Christoff (1996) notes a “weak” form of ecological modernization associated with its earliest formulation (Huber 1985) that contends that ecological improvements will come about automatically as the market is self-correcting. In this case, the decision to go “green” is based entirely on a cost-benefit analysis in which the true ecological costs are brought into consideration. Another way to think of this is by considering the Ecological Kuznet s Curve, which state that as nations modernize they first go through a period of ecological decline, followed by a leveling off, and finally end with ecological improvements. This is analogous to economist Simon Kuznet s argument that this same inverted U-shaped (quadratic) pattern holds for income inequality.\n\nProponents of what Christoff (1996) calls the “strong” version of ecological modernization theory maintain that in order to see ecological improvements in late modernization, it is crucial for governments to intervene and regulate business practices, as the market is not self-correcting. This is the position of more contemporary proponents of the theory (Mol 1995, 2001; Mol and Spaargaren 2000; Spaargaren, Mol, and Buttel 2000). From the ecological modernization perspective, environmental improvements at the national level result from having a strong democratic political context, as indicated by a healthy presence of non-governmental organizations and robust civil society. From this perspective, we would predict that having more national and international nongovernmental organizations should thus result in less biodiversity loss.\n\nInternational Political Economy\n\nThe third theoretical perspective we consider is that of international political economy (Amin 1974, 1976; Frank 1978; Wallerstein 1974). This perspective grows out of a critique of modernization theory, and maintains that sustainable capitalism is an impossible outcome, since businesses are driven by the pursuit of profits that are maximized by externalizing ecological costs, and because governments are more interested in taxing revenues generated by profit-seeking businesses than they are in protecting the environment (e.g., Roberts et ah, 2004; York et ah, 2003a, b). Hence, political economists would argue that actions taken by governments that are supposed to protect the environment are nothing more than “window dressing” (Buttel 2000), or are symbolic gestures aimed at appeasing environmental activists without actually challenging the fundamental practices of businesses responsible for ecological problems.\n\nIn the global context, the international political economy perspective views the world as a hierarchical system that includes a core, semi-periphery, and periphery. Nations can be located in any of these three categories with those in the core enjoying the most economic growth at the expense of other nations, those in the semi-periphery benefit from the exploitation of peripheral nations but suffer from the exploitative relationships they have with core countries, and peripheral countries are largely stuck in a dependant relationship with other nations, mired in debt that prevents them from growing and maintains in them a source of cheap labor and resources for the world (Galtung, I97I; Wallerstein 1974; Frank, 1978). From this perspective, nations in the core may be able to enjoy the luxury of ecological reforms largely because they have turned to peripheral nations for cheap resources and as havens for poor environmental industrial practices. In turn, core nations can reap the benefits of externalizing costs to the environment without seeing the tradeoff, since the externalities are exported to the environment and its inhabitants in peripheral countries in a form of ecologically unequal exchange (Jorgenson 2003,2004, 2006a,b, 2009).\n\nData and Methods\n\nOur analysis includes data on 139 countries from a variety of sources. These data are analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS software. Previous analyses of biodiversity loss employ other techniques (Hoffman 2004), such as negative binomial regression, which we believe are not adequate for testing the indirect (distant) relationships specified by international political economy theory. Moreover, SEM techniques allows us to employ latent variables and model error more appropriately for theoretical constructs that are often measured with single variables without model specified error terms (Bollen 1989; Grace and Bollen 2008). Below we offer a description of the variables used in our analysis.\n\nDependent Variable\n\nGlobal Threatened Species. We use a latent measure of global threatened species that is indicated by each nations threatened bird and mammal species as a proportion of the world s threatened bird and mammal species (World Resources Institute 2009). Examining these variables as separate indicators of the same underlying variable allows us to ascertain the combined and separate effects of the independent variables on our dependent variables at the same time (Cardillo et ah, 2005).\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nIPAT/STIRPAT Variables. As discussed in the section on theory, the key human ecology models are IPAT and STIRPAT that suggest environmental impacts are the result of population, affluence, and technology. Empirically, we examine these effects by including Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP/С) for the year 2000 and the percent urban as an indicator of technological advancement and affluence, consistent with other cross-national quantitative studies. These variables are in our view both indicators of modernization (Lerner, 1958; Rostow, I960; Smeiser, 1964; Parsons, I960). Finally, we include a variable for population size also from the World Resources Institute (2009). For reasons beyond the scope of this paper, we model population as being influenced by the level of modernization (affluence and technology, in the IPAT model), and these it turn are predictors of biodiversity loss.\n\nEcological Modernization Variables. We include the latent variable, organizational capacity as an indicator of the strength of national democracy. In turn, this should be related to environmental outcomes such as biodiversity loss. This latent variable is indicated by the number of environmental NGOs (Beckheld 2008) that explicitly focus on environmental or animal rights issues (Smith & Wiest, 2005), and the number of international NGOs (World Resources Institute (2009).\n\nPolitical-Economy Variables. To measure the impact of the global hierarchy on biodiversity loss, we include a measure of “world system position” (based on Snyder and Kick, 1979)\n\nControl Variables. We include in our analysis a number of variables known to be related to biodiversity loss, including latitude (Cardillo et ah, 2005; York et ah, 2003a) and land area (Cardillo et al., 2005; Gaston, 2005). Together these variables account for the size of nations, since larger nations include more land and thus potentially more species, and latitude accounts for climatic zones which are associated with varying levels of species richness.\n\nAnalysis and Results\n\nThe results of our structural equation model analysis are presented in Figures I and 2. The first of these figures does not include variables indicating ecological modernization: organizational capacity (an indicator the strength of democracy), and is the “best fitting” model1 of the two we present. Figure 2 includes these variables and is offered for illustrative purposes only, as it is not a good fitting model to the data. If we examine both models simultaneously, we can see a number of similarities beginning with the variables located on the left side of the figure that include our measure of world system position international political economy variable and our control variables, and how they relate to modernization and population (IPAT variables). World system position has a strong positive relationship with modernization and population, meaning that “core” countries tend to be more affluent, technologically advanced, urban, and support larger populations. We also note that net of modernization and population effects (IPAT) that countries in the core have less threatened species, consistent with the idea that core countries can export their environmental problems to the periphery. From the IPAT variable, we note that modernization itself has a weak positive direct relationship with the dependent variable, and a negative and moderate indirect relationship because of its negative relationship with population. It has been documented widely in the field of demography that modernization decreases population as countries begin to age and have fewer children. The major threat to species in the model comes by way of population size, consistent with the Malthusian side of the IPAT school, as it has a strong positive relationship with the number of threatened species. We would also note that because world system position increases population directly that this is offset by the modernization process which decreases population. This suggests that those countries higher in the world system that have not experienced modernization—in other words, the semi-periphery—are the most likely to experience species loss. In terms of the control variables, we would note that latitude has a moderate negative relationship with the dependent variable and that land area has a moderate positive relationship with the dependent variable. Interestingly, neither of the control variables has as much predictive power as the sheer size of the human population. In sum, as Figure I shows, threatened species are maximized in large temperate/ tropical nations in the semi-peripheral zone of the world political economic hierarchy where populations are high and modernization is low (because it is not reducing population size).\n\nAs mentioned above, the model in Figure 2 is shown for illustrative purposes as a test of ecological modernization theory. What we see in this model is that the organizational capacity of nations is increased as a result of modernization as predicted by ecological modernization theory. However, the organizational capacity itself has no statistically significant relationship with the dependent variable—in other words, the stronger democratic context does not improve this particular environmental outcome.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis analysis has offered an empirical test of three competing macrosociological theories that attempt to explain the anthropogenic causes of species loss in the world. These theories included the human ecological, ecological modernization, and international political economy perspectives. The human ecological perspective predicts that environmental impacts will result from population, affluence, and technology. Our analysis support strongly the idea that population size is a key determinant of species loss. However, modernization itself, while having a direct positive (statistical) impact, is largely offset by the fact that it contributes to a reduction in population size. Thus, the entire IPAT model is not supported in a simple additive sense, but rather as a complex interrelationship of these variables that influence our environmental outcome in both direct and indirect ways. Clearly, the most important of the IPAT variables is population, consistent with the Malthusian tradition. The prediction of international political economy that environmental problems will be worse in peripheral countries of the world (those lower in world system position) is supported in the model in terms of a direct relationship. However, because semi-peripheral nations have more population growth, the effect of world system position on population is likewise important to note. In either case, our analysis suggests that core countries are faring better than the rest of the world when it comes to limiting biodiversity loss. Finally, the prediction of ecological modernization theory that advanced modernization and democracy will result in improved environmental conditions—in this case the protection of biodiversity— is not supported, since organizational capacity had no effect on biodiversity loss (threatened species).\n\nA later, alternative version of this paper has been published in the journal, Organization ami Environment, under the title “World System, Anthropogenic, and Ecological Threats to Bird and Mammal Species: A Structural Equation Analysis of Biodiversity Loss” in volume 23, issue I, pages 3—31.\n\nReferences\n\nAmin, S.
