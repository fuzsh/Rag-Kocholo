        "text": "Wilbur Dean Helfrich, known for his ability to turn what other individuals considered a piece of junk into a workable piece of machinery, was born February 17, 1944 at Medicine Lodge, KS and died May 25, 2014 at Woodward, OK. He basically spent his working life as a handyman, working as a salvage yard businessman, as an electrician, as a security guard, as a capable “fix-it man”. He also had a passion for the Word Of God as in 1997 he became an ordained minister through the Progressive Universal Life Church. He pastored in a number of non-denominational settings. Family members describe him as a loving, kind individual who loved the ladies and his family. He basically served as a single parent, raising his three children to support and encourage one another. He would never let anyone go hungry. He possessed a very creative and imaginative mind in that his topic of discussion could change almost instantly. His thinking at times appeared to be stubborn but underneath that surface was a very caring spirit. This spirit became most evident with his final project that he directed and completed: Building a playhouse for his granddaughter. He wanted this project completed even though he was experiencing a terminal medical condition. Preceding Mr. Helfrich in his death are the following: His parents August and Clara Rupp Helfrich; his two brothers Bill Helfrich and Raymond Helfrich; one half brother Butch Burns; his sister Betty Nelson: his daughter Michelle Lynn Helfrich; grandma Cecilia Israel; and aunt Annie Jarvis. Survivors include the following: Daughter Mary Varnell and husband William; daughter Tammy Helfrich; son Michael Dean Helfrich; two adopted sons Corey Fischer and John Fischer; three grand-daughters- Makenzie Varnell, Chloe Varnell, Ashley Lynn Helfrich; one half brother Robert Burns; sister-in-law Mona Helfrich; numerous nieces and nephews; friends of the community-at-large. The mother of his four children, Connie McNutt. Funeral services were held on Saturday, May 31, 2014. Memorials may be given to Dean Helfrich memorial fund in care of McKillip Memorial Funeral Home."
