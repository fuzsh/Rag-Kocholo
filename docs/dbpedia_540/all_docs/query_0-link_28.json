He is a grandson of Aaron Bonnell, who migrated to the Miami Country in 1805 with his brothers, Benjamin and Paul, and married sisters. Rhoda and Abigail. They were the children of Benjamin and Rachel Bonnell, who emigrated from England to New Jersey. The father was drowned November 10, 1798, in the East river, near New York, with ten others, the boat on which they were crossing having been overturned by the rolling to one Side of several casks of rum. The mother survived until 1812.\n\nAaron Bonnell, the seventh child, was born March 4, 1750, in Essex county, N. J. He married Rachel Clark, and six children were born to them. Of these, Clark Bonnell was born November 18, 1790, in New Jersey. His father, Aaron, was the only one of the Bonnell colony who settled in Harrison township, the others stopping in the neighborhood of Carthage. During his lifetime be drew a pension, having been an artificer for the government during the war of the Revolution. His wife also died upon the old place near Harrison. Clark Bonnell had learned, in part, the trade of a shoemaker in New York State before the removal of the family to the West. Sometime before the death of his parents he was married to Miss Elsey Wykoff, of a family residing near Harrison on the Indiana side, and removed to the\n\nHISTORY OF CINCINNATI AND HAMILTON COUNTY. - 979\n\nvillage, where he pursued his trade for many years, and then removed to a country neighborhood in Ross township. Butler county, five miles from Hamilton, where he continued to follow his trade. Remaining here about five years, he removed to New London, Butler county, where his wife died in September, 1835; she was born February 7, 1794. Clark Bonnell died in Cincinnati in 1864, in the seventy-fourth year of his age. Their children numbered nine, of whom M. S, was the third and the eldest son.\n\nM. S. Bonnell was born upon the old place near Harrison, in a cabin where his father was then residing. He received some schooling in the poor \" subscription schools \" of that, day, which he attended for brief periods, as the pressing labors of the farm and workshop would allow, and in due time learned his father's trade, beginning to help in a small way when he was but nine years of age. He did not take kindly to the business, as it was too confining, and he was strongly predisposed to farm life, so he did little at shoemaking after he was fifteen years of age. For about eight years he served as a farm hand in various places in Hamilton and Butler counties, by the month or year, and for the next two years worked Judge Anderson's farm in Butler county \"on shares.\" Then for two years farmed similarly on the old place near Harrison, which had become the possession of his grandmother. He also managed it a similar term after her death for the purchasers of the farm Messrs. George Arnold and Peter Riffner. The latter was father of Martha R., who became the wife of Mr. Bonnell December 8, 1842. He was then residing on a rented farm on the other side of the Whitewater, near the edge of Indiana, where he remained a year, and then removed to the Frost farm on Lee's creek, in the north part of the township. This he occupied on five-year leases for the period of fifteen years, and so successfully that in 1856 he was enabled to purchase the 140 acre tract, upon which he now lives, two years before his last lease expired. To this he removed at the expiration of his lease, and here be has since resided, adding acres to his original purchase, and making a farm of high excellence. The Hamilton County Agricultural Society decided in 1880 to give a premium to the owner of the best regulated farm in the county. With this in view, a committee composed of Lew Fowler, I. H. Pendry, A. Brown, M. Hosbrook, V. B. Sater, and William Durham, made a careful examination of every nook and corner of the farm, and readily awarded Mr. Bonnell a silver medal. Thirty-one miles of underdrain have been constructed on this farm. It is of interest to note that in 1842 Mr. Bonnell sold corn at Harrison for 13 cents per bushel; hogs at Cincinnati for $2.25 net; and after spending four days hauling 100 bushels of oats to Cincinnati he sold it for 6 cents per bushel; in 1863 he sold hogs at $14.75 per hundred gross; hay at $30 per ton at Harrison; corn at $1.30 a bushel by the carload, and wheat at $3 per bushel at home. In connection with his farming operations Mr. Bonnell has raised horses for sixtyone years, and never lost one by death until April 2, 1894,\n\nIn 1881 Mr. Bonnell was elected in the Hamilton County Agricultural Society, and gave his assistance thereto for eleven years. The fair grounds are at Carthage, and when it was necessary for him to be there he made trips from home and return, a distance of eighty miles in a day, and always bore his own expenses. Ho was president of the Miami and Whitewater Valley Pioneer and Harvest Home Association in 1888, and served with much credit to himself and the entire satisfaction of the organization. More than forty years ago he became a member of Harrison Lodge No. 140, I. O. O. F., and belongs to the Sterns Encampment No. 183, and Daughters of Rebekah No. 360. He is also a Master Mason in Snow Lodge No. 193, F. & A. M., at Harrison. Mr. Bonnell has taken little interest in polities, but has devoted his time to his farm, and cared for two other families besides his own. His brother, Robert Burns Bonnell, and wife died in November and February, 1870, respectively, in Daviess county, Ind., leaving five children without a home: Mary Ann, born November 12, 1856; Naomi, born February 2, 1859;.

His daughter, Elizabeth Isabel, after her husband left for South America, whence he never returned, came to her father's home in the spring of 1876, and Mr. Bonnell has oared for her and her three children, to whom he gave good educational advantages.

James Andrews, of Harrison, is said to be the only person now living who was a resident of that town when Mr. Bonnell was born. Our subject began to hew his own way through life with strong arms and a willing heart, but with no financial inheritance.

They went to Philadelphia, saw the wonders of the Centennial, and afterward visited Washington City and Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington.
