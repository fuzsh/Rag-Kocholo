        "text": "We were excited to investigate Germania Maennechor. It was everything we were hoping for in an investigation. The building was large and the ghosts were plenty.\n\nI don’t think anyone can appreciate how many moving parts there are in an investigation. It starts with staffing the event, setting it up, communicating with the hosts on what we require and then finally, selling tickets. No matter how carefully an event is planned, hiccups occur and we had our fair share. We had three staff members call out sick and discovered that one of the rooms didn’t have air conditioning shortly after we arrived. But, we pivoted and figured it out. As we were checking guests in, we realized we were missing 20 people, only to find them waiting patiently at the front door instead of coming through the back, which they didn’t know about. So, I’ll start out by apologizing to anyone who had to wait for us to find you.\n\nThe building itself is magnificent. It was built in 1913 for members of the German community to meet and enjoy the blessings of song. Over the years, the facility has become a meeting place for people in the area and hosts their annual Volksfest event every August, featuring great German food and entertainment.\n\nWe broke into five groups and investigated six rooms in the building.\n\nSinging Room – Investigator: Joni Mayhan\n\nFirst Session – Blue Group\n\nMy first session caused a bit of a panic for me. I was using the Ghosttube Vox app, which I’ve had amazing luck with in the past, but it simply refused to say a word. We went to Plan B and used an SB-11 Spirit Box, loaned to us by a great couple who attended the event, but it also refused to spit out a single word. This was perplexing to me because we did a test investigation and the Vox talked non-stop in that room. We then went to Plan C and pulled out the dowsing rods. I’m still not certain what went wrong and why they wouldn’t talk to us, but everything worked perfectly during the second session.\n\nI had everyone introduce themselves and then I asked the first question.\n\n“Is there anyone here who would like to talk to us?” I asked and the rods told me “No.” We all laughed and I noted that it was going to be a very long night if that continued. Undaunted, I continued and finally started getting reluctant responses.\n\nThere were several males there\n\nThere were also females in the room\n\nTwo of my guests had lost a family member seven years ago and began attempting to reach out to him. He was a long time member of the facility.\n\nChris was there with them.\n\nHe planned to come to Volksfest and be a part of the festivities.\n\nBobby is with him.\n\nHe misses his daughter.\n\nHe’s at peace.\n\nI took the rods again and asked them to point to where they were standing in the room. The rods pointed in the corner behind me to my left and then again across the room to the left. Paula, who was the group leader for the Blue Group, came back with a spirit box, but it wasn’t talking to me. We continued with the dowsing rods\n\nThey said they would talk to us on the rods, but didn’t come through on the spirit boxes.\n\nI walked out of the room with my Vox and it immediately began talking in the hallway, so I realized there was nothing wrong with my equipment. It was the room. I checked everything. I was connected to the Internet. The volume was fine. It said one thing to me: You don’t!\n\nSecond Session – Striped Group\n\nThe second session went much better than the first. We introduced ourselves and got started.\n\nRosemary asked if they were born and raised in Evansville and a voice said, “no.”\n\nA guest asked if they need all of the people to be members to keep the place running and a voice agreed with him. “All,” he said.\n\nSomeone asked if they played with them and a voice said, “no.”\n\nWhen I asked if they ever go sit at the bar and have drinks with their friends, a female told me, “Yes.”\n\nWe were getting responses to our questions, but they were difficult to understand. And then, all of a sudden, we got a clear response that made absolutely no sense. “Shipping lanes,” a male voice told us.\n\nWe thought we heard the word “boot” mentioned, so one of the guests followed up with it. “Someone mentioned something about a boot,” he started. A voice said, “Ed.”\n\nHe asked if they shipped boots and a male voice told him, “parkas.”\n\nBill comes in by himself on Sundays and does maintenance on the building. He always feels as though he’s not alone. He’s actually had several experiences in the building. He asked if they go to other areas and a male voice said, “Watching into me.”\n\nHe asked if they watch him on Sundays and a male voice with a British accent said, “What other option?”\n\nBill asked if they approve of what they’re doing at Germania and the same voice told him, “Be covered.” I’m not sure what that meant, but maybe it means something to them.\n\nHe asked if they were aware of the problems they had there. A female voice with another strong accent told him, “To all of you.”\n\nHe noted that things have been different since we came in and did our pre-investigation. Two Sundays ago, he was hearing strange sounds. He got up and checked the door, but nobody was there. Ten minutes later, he heard it again. Still nothing. So, he turned the music on so he wouldn’t hear anything. During the middle of his story, a deep male voice told him, “She warned you.”\n\nI’m not sure what that meant. Was he talking about me warning him? I don’t recall warning him about anything, but maybe that’s how the ghosts took it.\n\nBill asked if he’s the one he’s aware of. A voice told him, “Too many.”\n\nWe thought we heard the name “Bob,” but after reviewing it, it sounded more like “Bug.” I asked Bill if he knew a Bob, so he asked, “Is there a Bob here, as in, you know what I mean?” A male voice said, “His season.” I don’t know if this makes any sense to Bill or not, but it was a pretty clear response.\n\nThird Session – Yellow Group\n\nDonna Mesker was in our third group. She was the one I spoke to when we decided to do an investigation and managed to get approvals. We’d barely gotten started when a male came through with some sage advice. “Let’s calm down,” he told us.\n\nDonna told them she knew there were women there when she’s in the building working and wondered if there were also gentlemen watching. A female voice told her, “One.”\n\nAdam Williams, who is a friend of mine from New Harmony, asked if Bob Fedrick was with them. Apparently, they talked to him in a previous session. A male voice told him, “You left something.”\n\nI commented that we most definitely heard the name Bob in the previous session. Then, a male voice came through, as if clarifying. “Foreseen their own money,” he told us. This might make more sense to the Germania Maennechor people if they knew someone named Bob who passed.\n\nThere were a few responses that I completely got wrong. I thought I heard “who was in the will,” but it wasn’t even close. Donna asked if they worked on Main Street, and a man told her, “I did not.”\n\nAdam asked if any of them worked for the Fendrich’s and a female told him, “It’s a school.” I couldn’t find a Fendrich school in Evansville, but it could have been someone who worked there.\n\nA male voice said, “Fifty fourd,” and I made fun of it. I said, “That sounded like fifty fourd or fifty five. Are you from Boston?” The same male voice told me, “I’ve been drinking.” It made me laugh.\n\nSomeone asked if they were in any of the pictures on the wall and a male voice told him, “Brandon.” They got the name Brandon in their last session, so this could be relevant. Donna walked around with a flashlight, but she couldn’t find the name Brandon under any of the photos.\n\nDonna asked what their main task was when they were there and we all thought we heard, “Fold the linen,” but it was something else. Slowed down, it sounded like forma lin, which makes no sense.\n\nWhen Donna asked if they see what happens during the meetings there, a female told them, “The rule is to play.”\n\nDonna asked if they saw what happened to her in the meeting room and a male said, “Five, Twenty, Twenty-four.” This sounds like a date. Wonder what happened on 5-20-24.\n\nI was trying to figure out if the session was almost over and asked if it was almost nine o’clock. A male voice told me, “Got it.”\n\nSomeone asked if they could tell us where they were in the room. A male voice said what kind of sounds like, “I’ve been lost again.”\n\n“Just reopen it,” a female voice told us. “What are we opening?” one of our guests asked. A male voice responded, “Bar.” This is interesting because I asked them to close the bar once the investigation started, which wasn’t overly popular with the members.\n\nWe had a few more responses that didn’t line up with the questions and then time ran out.\n\nFourth Session – Red Group\n\nWe started out strong. As soon as we introduced ourselves, I asked if they could tell us their names. A male voice immediately told us, “Billy.”\n\nSeconds later a male voice said, “The people.” I’m not sure what he was referring to, but his message was loud and clear.\n\nI asked if he liked us coming to visit us and he was equally unimpressed. “Undetermined,” he told me.\n\nOne of the guests asked how old he was, and he told her, “Fifty-seven.”\n\nWhen asked if they wish they could leave, a voice came across the SB11 Spirit Box and said, “NO.”\n\nOne of them piped up and told us, “This is a joke!”\n\nWe didn’t catch a lot of what they said at the time. I had to isolate and slow some of it down, but this one was interesting. Lexie Hoehn, Traci’s niece, was taking photos for us during the night. As soon as she came in the room and started taking pictures, one of them commented on it. “Picture’s good!” he said with enthusiasm.\n\nOther times, we thought we heard something that wasn’t actually what we thought we heard. But when I held up three fingers and asked them if they could tell me how many fingers, we got a clear response. “Three, two,” a male said. This was funny because I was holding up two fingers and my thumb. Someone in an earlier group said that’s how you show “3” in German, so I adopted his method. So, technically, I was holding up two fingers and a thumb.\n\nA guest asked if he was happy. We all through we heard, “I was,” but it actually wasn’t anything clear. She followed up with, “What makes you unhappy?” A deep male voice told her, “God.”\n\nOne of the ghosts didn’t think highly of us. She told us we were a “total freak.” Or maybe she was totally freaked out by our investigation. I’m not sure what to make of it.\n\nFifth Session – Orange Group\n\nWe ran over by nearly 45 minutes, so we were eager to get started. As we were introducing ourselves, it sounded like someone else said their name. In review, it was just gibberish, but when we asked them to clarify, a male voice said, either “same” or “save.”\n\nOne of them volunteered some information. “Got our music,” she told us, which makes sense because we were in the singing room.\n\nThey were apparently getting tired of us being there. When a guest asked if they liked dessert, a man said, “Please stop.”\n\nWe got a couple of responses that were warbled. I told the group we were getting some responses that were hard to understand. A female told us, “I’m sorry.”\n\nThis didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me, but I’m posting it because it’s so clear. Someone asked if he was speaking to his singer from upstairs and a male voice said, “Then you will do.”\n\nFor the fifth time that night, I held up three fingers and asked them if they could tell me how many fingers I was holding up. A male voice told me, “We’ll get along.”\n\nWe went a long period of time getting nonsensical answers until we finally got another valid hit. Someone asked their favorite pie and a man said, “Apple.”\n\nWe must have all been hungry, because we couldn’t seem to get off the topic of pie. When asked if he liked American apple pie, the male told them, “Peach.”\n\nWe were getting more odd responses that really weren’t words. I commented that I thought they were getting tired of us and a male voice (the same one we’d been hearing all night) said, “Good night.” I guess that was our answer.\n\nApple seemed to be a hot topic during this session. When we heard it regarding the pie question, we kept thinking we were hearing it again (we weren’t). Becca asked if pie was their favorite subject and a male said, “It’s a joke!”\n\nWe laughed and said that at least he has a good sense of humor when he did something incredible. He said it again! “It’s a joke!” This was pretty amazing. I don’t think I’ve ever had this happen in all my years of investigating.\n\nWe were getting towards the end of the session and were just kind of chatting amongst ourselves when a female gave us some important instructions. “It’s time to cook!” she stated quite emphatically.\n\nThat ended up being the last ghostly response for us for the night.\n\nMen’s Kitchen – sessions led by Kathy Hoffman\n\nWe felt a lot of energy in the Men’s Kitchen and in the Back Bar Storage room. Neither room was large enough for a group, so we decided to split the group. Half of the group stayed in the Men’s Kitchen for 15 minutes and then went to the storage room for 15 minutes.\n\nFirst Session – Striped Group\n\nKathy led groups with dowsing rods. She showed the group how to use the rods and then the group introduced themselves. Then, they were off and running.\n\nNo was there to talk to them (which is funny because someone told them they weren’t there)\n\nShe asked again and they finally said “yes”\n\nThe spirits have been there for a long time.\n\nThey were talking to a man.\n\nHe’s from the Evansville area.\n\nHe has lived there all his life.\n\nHe doesn’t have a wife.\n\nHe has one child.\n\nThere was more than one sprit in the room.\n\nHis ancestors weren’t members of the club.\n\nHe visits other parts of the building.\n\nHe was one of the original founding fathers.\n\nHe was an immigrant from Germany.\n\nHe likes being in the kitchen.\n\nSecond Half of the group\n\nThere were spirits there willing to talk to them.\n\nThey turned on the light (they had motion sensor lights in the room).\n\nThe spirit from the storage room followed them into the Men’s Kitchen.\n\nThey know who he is. He has family who were members.\n\nThey were talking to a male.\n\nThere were more than three spirits there.\n\nThere weren’t any women there (men’s kitchen, so it makes sense).\n\nThey are okay with women being in the men’s kitchen though.\n\nThey see the KII meter (EMF meter) on the table in front of them.\n\nThey can wave their hands over the meter.\n\nThey just waved their hand over the device.\n\nThey like the warmer temperatures.\n\nThey know his relatives who were members.\n\nThey visit him when he’s in the building.\n\nThey were there when the building was built in 1913.\n\nThey get tired after talking to us.\n\nSecond Session – Yellow Group\n\nAs soon as they introduced themselves, they got started.\n\nThere was a spirit there.\n\nThey had a female with them.\n\nThey recognize her from being there frequently.\n\nThe work she does there makes them proud.\n\nThey were talking to a cook.\n\nThey cooked for many years there.\n\nIt was her favorite room in the building.\n\nThey like it there.\n\nThey stay in that building all the time.\n\nThere was also a man in the room.\n\nJust the two of them were in the room.\n\nBob was there with them (he was in their last session).\n\nBob wasn’t married.\n\nBob was an adult.\n\nThere was someone else in the room with Bob and the female.\n\nThey switched groups and the second group came in.\n\nThere was someone in the room with them.\n\nThere was a woman there.\n\nShe worked in the kitchen.\n\nShe had children.\n\nShe was married.\n\nHer children were also there.\n\nShe likes staying in the building.\n\nHe knows Bob Fendrich.\n\nHe’s in the building.\n\nBob is in the room.\n\nHe wasn’t speaking with Bob.\n\nThey asked the rods to point to where they were and they pointed towards the microwave.\n\nThey confirmed they were by the microwave.\n\nThey were still talking to the woman who was there from the beginning.\n\nShe’s been there for more than 100 years.\n\nShe wasn’t born here.\n\nShe was born in Germany.\n\nShe can hear the birds outside.\n\nOne of them has been to Willard Library.\n\nThird Session – Red Group – Technical difficulties – no audio was recorded during these sessions.\n\nFourth Session – Orange Group\n\nAfter introducing themselves, they got started.\n\nThere was someone in the room with them\n\nThey were willing to share information with them.\n\nThey enjoy sharing information.\n\nTheir parents did not work in the building.\n\nThey had grandparents who worked in the building.\n\nThey played music.\n\nThey liked to dance to the music.\n\nThey liked to come in when they had the big parties.\n\nThey weren’t able to help their grandparents.\n\nThey were just watching in the background.\n\nThey were too young to help.\n\nThey got lots of good things to eat.\n\nThey snuck in and got seconds.\n\nThey asked where they were standing and they pointed towards the sinks.\n\nThey got stuck washing dishes.\n\nThey had to dry them too.\n\nThey had to help peel potatoes.\n\nThey were talking to a woman.\n\nHer father belonged to Germania Maennerchor.\n\nThat’s why she came down there a lot.\n\nShe lived in the city.\n\nShe walked to Germania.\n\nHer father worked during WWII\n\nShe missed her dad when he was in the war.\n\nHe was gone long periods of time.\n\nHer dad came home from the war.\n\nHer dad got to spend a little bit of time with her after the war.\n\nHer dad took her fishing.\n\nShe played baseball with her dad.\n\nHer dad was good at baseball.\n\nShe was good at baseball too.\n\nShe went to St. Anthony’s Catholic School.\n\nAnn was there with them.\n\nShe was able to hear the music played in the kitchen.\n\nTheir session ended and the second group came in. After introducing themselves, they got started.\n\nThey were talking to someone who prepared meals.\n\nThey didn’t enjoy it.\n\nThey enjoyed spending time with other members of the club.\n\nThey sang in the choir.\n\nThey were talking to a man.\n\nThere was more than one person there.\n\nIt was the same person they were talking to in the other room.\n\nThey were standing over by the stoves.\n\nHis wife was with him.\n\nHis wife was standing by the refrigerator.\n\nThey cooked in the kitchen.\n\nShe wasn’t a good cook and neither was he.\n\nHe’s glad he married his wife.\n\nThe first group ran over the fifteen minute time, which caused the second group to be short.\n\nFifth Session – Blue Group\n\nFirst group. After introducing themselves, they got started.\n\nThere was an auxiliary member there.\n\nHer name was Dorothy.\n\nShe made the potato salad.\n\nThe choir sang at her holiday.\n\nShe’s going to be there to help make the potato salad.\n\nShe’s happy.\n\nThere’s a secret to making the potato salad.\n\nShe’s doing a good job with the catering for the auxiliary.\n\nShe was president of the auxiliary.\n\nShe liked Yvonne picking her up for the meetings.\n\nShe’s ready for Volksfest.\n\nShe used to make kraut-balls.\n\nShe doesn’t remember when he came and sang in her room.\n\nShe misses them.\n\nShe helped with bingo.\n\nDorothy is going on their bus trip with them.\n\nDorothy is going to fry bacon.\n\nThe second group introduced themselves and then got started.\n\nThey had a hard time getting any responses. They passed them around to other people, who also had a difficult time. They joked that the ghosts must have gone to bed. They didn’t get a single response. They said the same thing happened to them in the stockroom session.\n\nFest Hall Stage\n\nJason Nelson ran the investigations on the stage in Fest Hall. Jason and his wife got married there several months ago. I came to the wedding and realized how haunted the building was. Jason put me in touch with Donna Mesker, which resulted in this investigation.\n\nBesides the investigation on the stage, Jason’s group was also doing breakout sessions. A group of three went to a very dark space behind the stage and conducted their own mini-investigations with pendulums.\n\nFirst Session – Orange Group\n\nJason explained the spirit box session protocol. His group introduced themselves and they got started.\n\nOne of the guests started to ask a question but was interrupted. “My name is Kalea….” A soft male voice said, “trust.”\n\nBecky told them, “We aren’t here to hurt you. We’re here to learn.” A male voice responded with, “What?”\n\nJason asked them if they liked the weddings, and a male voice said, “Sure.”\n\nSomeone asked them if they liked performing and a woman sang out. It might have been one of the funniest responses of the night.\n\nBecca came back from the breakout group and said she heard footsteps behind her. She asked if they were behind her and the pendulum indicated that they were. As she was telling the group this, a voice came across the spirit box and said, “Go back!” I’m kind of glad she didn’t hear it at the time. He didn’t sound very friendly.\n\nBecca asked if there were more than three people up there and a male voice said, “No.”\n\nShe then asked, “Who’s the best singer up here?” Before she could even finish her question, a female said, “It’s me.” I wonder if she’s the same one who sang to them.\n\nBecca was truly on a roll. She asked, “What’s your favorite song?” and a male told her, “I’m dead.”\n\nSomeone asked “What is your favorite food that this place serves.” The same male voice told them, “The bacon.” I have to agree with him.\n\nHe followed up with another question. “Do you have a favorite drink?” The same male voice told him, “Blackwell.” I looked it up and Blackwell makes both wine and Jamaican Rum. It’s not necessarily a German drink, but it sounds good.\n\nSomeone asked if they liked spaetzle and a male voice said, “Happy birthday.”\n\nWhen asked who was in the hallway, a male voice told them, “Barry.”\n\nBecca asked, “What’s your favorite color?” It took a while, but we finally got an answer. “Purple,” someone answered.\n\nTime was up and Jason moved onto his second session.\n\nSecond Session – Blue Group\n\nI really hoped this group would have a positive experience after sitting through the tragedy that was my first session in the Singing Room. It took them a few questions before they finally got a response.\n\nSomeone commented on all the beautiful flags in the room and asked if they had a favorite. A female told them, “I think.”\n\nSomeone asked if they were a choir member and a male said, “Becca.” There was a Becky in the group. Is that her?\n\nIt sounds like we had a skeptic in the group. He asked a few validating questions and got insulted in the process. He asked if it was the year 2012, and the ghost in the room called him a scholar.\n\nThe ghosts might have provided information from a crime. The week before our investigation, someone broke into the building and stole copper pipes. Jason asked if they knew who stole the pipes and a male voice said, “It’s a cop.” This was stunning. Could the perpetrator have been dressed like a cop or security person? You know the ghosts saw it happen. This would be crazy if they helped find the thief.\n\nOur skeptical guest asked another serious of questions that were somewhat nonsensical and got a response. He asked if there was a horse painted on the wall and a female said, “Pink?” as if in question.\n\nAs they closed out the session, the ghosts had one last thing to say. Someone asked if they had a good time and a male said, “That’s awful.” Apparently, they didn’t enjoy it as much as we did.\n\nThird Session – Striped Group\n\nJason explained what they would be doing during the session. They introduced themselves and got started.\n\nThey went around most of the group without any clear responses, but then it was Bill’s turn. Bill spends a lot of time at Germania Maennerchor, especially on Sundays when he works on the building. In a previous session, he was told they watch him when he’s there. He didn’t get any clear answers when he asked if they watched him during Jason’s session, but he did get a clear answer when he asked about Carl. “Is Carl here?” he asked and a female with an accent told him, “Carl’s about.”\n\nSomeone asked if they’ve been there a long time and a male voice told her, “No.”\n\nShe followed up with another question that garnered an answer. “Do all the spirits in this building get along?” A female told her, “we can’t.”\n\nThey then got one of the creepiest responses of the night. They were in between questions when a voice said, “Now ask them!”\n\nJason asked if they were part of the choir and a woman told them, “That’s right.”\n\nHe followed up with another question, asking what they sang. A male voice told him, “Let’s rock!”\n\nSomeone asked how many people were in the stage area and a woman told them, “Eleven.”\n\nThey went around the group again, but didn’t get any responses until it was Bill’s turn again. “How many people are in the room now?” he asked. A female told him, “There’s six.”\n\nThey didn’t get any further responses.\n\nFourth Session – Yellow Group\n\nJason started off his session with a response. After explaining the session process, he asked how many spirits were there with them and a female voice said, “Ten.” It’s very faint, so you’ll have to listen closely or with headphones.\n\nHe’d been asking the ghosts if they liked warm beer or cold beer all evening and finally got a response. “Warm,” said the same lady with an accent that talked to his group earlier.\n\nA guest asked if he saw them over by the window and a voice told him, “no.”\n\nSomeone asked if they could make a noise to let the group know they were there. Immediately afterwards, the recorder picked up two distinct thumps.\n\nOne of the guests said she heard something, but didn’t know what it was. This was answered with a louder thump.\n\nAdam asked if Bob Fendrich was there. This is someone they talked to in another session. A male voice told him, “I’m driving!” and then another male said, “I’m Bob.”\n\nThey went around the room several times without getting a clear response. Finally, someone asked, “Do you speak German?” A male voice told her, “No.”\n\nThat ended up being their last response for the session.\n\nFifth Group – Red Group\n\nAfter they introduced themselves, they got started on the session. They got a response right out of the gate with the first question. A guest told them, “I like chicken. Do you like chicken?” and a male voice told him, “yes.”\n\nUnfortunately, the big air conditioning unit kicked on as soon as the session started. It makes audio review almost impossible since it drowns out a lot of the responses. They were getting slight responses, but they weren’t clear.\n\nThis group felt as though there was a little girl named Nina following them, so many of their questions were directed towards her.\n\nThey ended up just chatting for the rest of the session. I think the ghosts were getting tired. I know we were.\n\nWomen’s Kitchen –Investigator: Rick Schlegelmilch\n\nFirst Session – Red Group\n\nRick would be using the Vox Spirit Box app, like I used in the Singing Room. He had everybody introduce themselves and then began explaining the process. As he was telling them how the session would go, a voice interrupted him and told him, “They’ve listened.” Apparently, they were ready to get the show on the road.\n\nThe first guest to ask a question asked how many people were sitting around the table with them. Before she could even finish asking her question, a male voice said, “A hundred and four.” I have to assume he was being sarcastic. That would be a lot of ghosts.\n\nThey got another random response and a guest said it didn’t sound American. A male voice told her, “If you think.”\n\nShe must have not heard the response, because she asked again. This time, another ghost answered her, “Thirty-eight.”\n\nIt was one of the guest’s turn, but he opted to pass his turn onto the next person. As soon as he said, “I’ll pass,” a ghost had some commentary about it. “And it’s a living,” he said. Is that what they call us? Livings?\n\nSomeone asked if they had children and a woman told them, “No.”\n\nWhen asked what kind of work they did, a male voice told them, “Festival.”\n\nIn between questions, a woman had something to tell them. “Attempt on my life,” she said.\n\nRick had an equipment issue, so he switched to the SB-7 Spirit Box. A woman was asking if they had any issues with the 1937 flood, if it affected them personally. A male voice said, “Get off.”\n\nIf they got any other responses, I couldn’t hear them. The volume was very low. The session ended and the group went to break.\n\nSecond Session – Orange Group\n\nThey attempted a spirit box session, but didn’t get any clear response, so they began using the flashlight as a tool.\n\nThey enjoy having people come in and learn from them.\n\nThey would like to share their information.\n\nRick turned the spirit box back on. This time, they began getting responses. A woman asked if they had a large family and a male voice told her, “I want to leave with you.” Hopefully, that didn’t happen.\n\nSomeone began using dowsing rods and were getting quite a few responses while the spirit box played in the background.\n\nThe woman they were speaking to had a half dozen children.\n\nTheir family wasn’t there.\n\nHe worked at the shipyard during the war and worked as a welder.\n\nThey didn’t know her mom.\n\nThey worked on the ships while they were in the water.\n\nThey knew how the LSD ship broke away and floated out into the river. She noted that her mother was on the ship when it happened.\n\nAfter getting that response, she said, “I’ve got goose bumps,” and a male voice responded with, “No thanks.”\n\nHe didn’t work on the tanks\n\nRick asked if he worked on the airplanes. The dowsing rods said “yes” at the same time he got a response on the spirit box. A male voice said, “You bet.\n\nHe wasn’t a riveter\n\nHe was a welder with the airplanes\n\nOther family members worked with him\n\nHis father worked with him.\n\nHis children didn’t work with him.\n\nA male guest asked if he was a member of Germania and a male voice said, “No.”\n\nHe was a welder for the building they were in.\n\nHe was injured which prevented him from being in the war.\n\nIt wasn’t due to a work injury.\n\nHe was born with the issue.\n\nThird Session – Blue Group\n\nRick’s group started out with a spirit box session. It took almost five minutes to get a response, but it was a doozy. A guest asked if they had any pets and a man told them, “A snake.”\n\nI feel sorry for the Blue Group. They just weren’t getting any results. Finally, after another four minutes, someone asked, “What room are we in?” and a man told him, “What we owe.” It wasn’t really an answer that fit the question, but it was the only one that was legible.\n\nThey started asking if they played cards in the Women’s Kitchen or if they counted money. Rick commented that “That got them talking,” and a woman said, “I’m not sure.”\n\nOne guest asked, “If you lost money in this room, did you get in trouble when you got home?” A female told him, “Stop,” and she sounded irritated.\n\nOne reason why this group might not have been getting as many responses as the other groups is because several of them kept asking validating questions to prove there were really ghosts there.\n\nThey were getting noises on the spirit box, but most of them were just blips and blurts from radio stations. Finally, someone told them, “Say orange if you don’t want to talk,” and a male voice said, “That one.” I don’t know why he didn’t just say orange, but his intent was clear.\n\nThe session ended and they moved onto their next group.\n\nFourth Session – Striped Group\n\nAfter introducing themselves, they got started on a spirit box session. One guest asked how long they’ve been in the building. A male voice commented, “Man, it’s strong.” I’m not sure what he meant by that, but it was an interesting response.\n\nIn this group’s session in the Singing Room with me, one of the guests asked they what their favorite beer was. A male voice said, “Busch,” which struck us all as funny. He asked if his Busch Beer friend followed him into the Women’s Kitchen. A male voice immediately responded, “I’ve a come!”\n\nThe same guest asked if his “boot shipping” friend came with them. Upon review, I didn’t get the same information we thought we got at the time. We heard “shipping lanes” come through on the VOX. When asked what they shipped, we thought we heard the word “Boots” but that wasn’t the case. They actually said “parkas.” The response to the follow up question in this session was “Billy,” followed by another male voice who said, “Jim.”\n\nRick was attempting to move the session along, so he asked Rosemary if she’d like to ask any questions. A male voice piped up, “Welcome!” He was apparently happy to see her.\n\nRosemary asked them if they could move the cat ball that lights up when moved. A male voice found it, “Intriguing.”\n\nA woman who returned from the break out session asked a few questions. She asked if they liked it when they cooked in the Women’s Kitchen. A male voice told her. “I don’t cook.”\n\nWhen it was Bill’s turn to ask questions, he asked if they were there on Sundays. During his session in the Singing Room with me, they told him they watch him on Sundays. This time, he got two interesting responses. One voice said, “Typical,” which was followed by another voice that also said, “Typical.”\n\nBill then asked if there were more female than male spirits in the building. He got a really interesting answer. A man voice with an accent told him, “You’re a policeman.”\n\nWhen Bill asked if Bob was there, a female told him, “He’s in the basement.” I was under the impression they didn’t have a basement, so I’m not sure what this meant.\n\nWhen it was Rosemary’s turn, she attempted to get them to play with the cat ball on the table. When she asked if they would turn it on, it went on immediately. It continued to go off for another minute.\n\nA guest asked if they were there during the steamboat era and a male said, “You bet.”\n\nThey asked quite a few more questions and really didn’t get any responses, but they did get something during a pause in questions. It’s faint, but clear. A male said, “They said it’ll come.” Another male responded to him and said, “Are you stupid?” It sounded like they were having a conversation.\n\nThat ended up being their last intelligent response.\n\nFifth Session – Yellow Group\n\nRick started his last session by explaining the process. After they introduced themselves, they got started. Often, as we get later into the night, the activity wears down. It’s as though the ghosts have retired for the evening. Either that, or we’ve worn them out.\n\nThey didn’t get their first intelligent response until nearly eight minutes into the session. A woman told them what I suspected. “It’s break time,” she told them.\n\nThey didn’t get another clear response until the thirteen minute mark. Someone asked what their name was and a man said, “Got rich for.” It’s not an intelligent response, but it was clear once it was slowed down. The group thought he said “Richard,” so they began directing questions towards him.\n\nAfter a few more rounds, Rick gave up on the spirit box and began focusing on the cat ball. He asked them to make it flash its lights and it instantly began flashing. He remarked that he’s done 15-20 of these investigations and has never had it work that well.\n\nThey got it to come on several more times before it was the end of the session.\n\nRathskeller Sessions – Investigator: Traci Hoehn\n\nTraci’s sessions were located in the Rathskeller. Here, guests got to experience sensory deprivation in combination with the spirit box, a technique known as the Estes Method. Using this method, one participant listens to the spirit box through a headset while blindfolded. They say what they hear come through while the rest of the group asks questions. The headphones and blindfold preclude interpreting anticipated answers by the listener. Although we were short a blindfold, all of the participants kept their eyes closed during the sessions, and they were set a few feet back from the group to avoid noise contamination as much as possible. You’ll see in the transcripts, some people seem to have more of an affinity for this method (or perhaps the ghosts just like talking to them more!). With the Rathskeller being one of the most active areas of the building, we were certainly excited to see how the ghosts would communicate with us here.\n\nEach session opened with a brief explanation of the equipment. Once we got a volunteer set up listening to the spirit box, we introduced ourselves to the ghosts and got rolling. The goal is always to have a direct conversation with the ghosts that makes sense. We certainly achieved that goal at certain points in the evening! In the following transcripts, all responses from the Estes Method listener will be labeled as A while any questions from the group will be labeled Q.\n\nSession One (Yellow Group):\n\nQ: Can you tell us what your name is?\n\nIs there anyone here who wants to talk with us?\n\nA: Clothes\n\nQ: Clothes? Do you see the clothes on the table (referring to the shirts for sale)? Is that what you see?\n\nWhat kind of work did you do?\n\nWhat is your first language?\n\nA: Baby\n\nQ: Are you young?\n\nAre you the spirit of a young child?\n\nAre your parents here, too?\n\nDo you have a baby?\n\nHow old are you?\n\nAre there more than two spirits in the room?\n\nDid you cook when you worked here?\n\nIs your name Samuel?\n\nWhere are you from originally?\n\nAre you married?\n\nIs anyone else from your family here?\n\nWhat would you like to talk about?\n\nAt this point, we weren’t having a lot of success yet, so we switched volunteers and had a new listener.\n\nQ: Are you shy? We know you’re in here. There are plenty of you in this building. We just want to talk to you. Were you a member of the club here?\n\nA: One\n\nQ: One, what?\n\nA: No, three.\n\nQ: There are three what?\n\nA: Now.\n\nQ: Are you three years old?\n\nA: Three\n\nQ: Do you like any of the toys we brought for you (there was a ball and a REM pod in the room for the ghosts to play with)?\n\nAre you male? A boy?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: Have you played with balls before?\n\nA: Yesterday. Night.\n\nQ: Would you like to play again today with our pink ball?\n\nA: Do you?\n\nQ: Yes. I’ll play ball with you. You go first.\n\nA: Patient.\n\nQ: Ok. I can be patient.\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Are there other kids who you play with?\n\nA: Left. The middle.\n\nQ: What’s in the middle?\n\nA: Fendrich.\n\nQ: Is that a name? (Here one of the guests notes that there is a Fendrich Golf Course in Evansville)\n\nA: I’m happy.\n\nQ: Is Fendrich someone in your family?\n\nA: I’m trying.\n\nQ: What are you trying to do?\n\nA: It’s up.\n\nQ: What’s up?\n\nOne of the pictures that are up? (Pictures of former members adorn the walls of the Rathskeller)\n\nA: Relations. Relationship.\n\nQ: Was that your dad?\n\nCan you tell us the names of the other two who are here with you?\n\nA: This time?\n\nQ: Please.\n\nA: Girl.\n\nQ: Her name?\n\nThank you.\n\nAre you friends with the girl with you?\n\nA: They are. One.\n\nQ: Are there two girls here, too?\n\nA: Drugs.\n\nQ: What do you call the Frau that is here?\n\nShe’s probably the staunch one, right?\n\nA: Wait.\n\nQ: Does she serve the food?\n\nA: We are.\n\nQ: Or was she a barmaid who served the drinks only?\n\nA: Promise?\n\nQ: Yes. Tell me.\n\nAre there people in other parts of the building?\n\nA: Speech.\n\nQ: Do you want to give a speech?\n\nA: Brandon.\n\nQ: Is that your name?\n\nWho is Brandon?\n\nCan you see me?\n\nA: I’m Bob.\n\nQ: Hi. It’s nice to meet you, Bob. Do you remember any of our names?\n\nBob, how long have you been here?\n\nCan you tell me who the president is?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Did you play any sports?\n\nA: Nope.\n\nQ: Are you ok?\n\nWhat can we help you with?\n\nIs this still Bob?\n\nIs it Bob that’s asking for help?\n\nA: Here we are.\n\nYou can.\n\nQ: Do you like living here, in this building?\n\nA: Butterfly. (After looking around the room, one guest had a butterfly on their clothing)\n\nQ: Do you like her butterfly?\n\nA: Hurry.\n\nAt this point, Traci saw the shadow of a tall man walk behind the bar and into the back room. None of the other participants saw him, but we all became much more vigilant. We used this opportunity to switch listeners once more.\n\nQ: Do you always stay here, or do you leave the building?\n\nA: I’ve been.\n\nQ: Have you been walking around outside the building?\n\nWhat is your favorite object in this room?\n\nDo you know who was behind the bar just now?\n\nA: Developing.\n\nQ: Can you come forward and touch the machine (K2 meter)?\n\nA: It’s between.\n\nQ: Would you rather it be further away?\n\nA: Your neighbors.\n\nSo, that’s it.\n\nQ: Are you done talking?\n\nA: What we bring you.\n\nQ: Explain.\n\nA: Forty-seven.\n\nQ: What are you doing right now?\n\nDid you or somebody you know work for the Fendrich Cigar Company?\n\nA: Not picking up. An accessible way.\n\nQ: We only have a couple of minutes left in this session. Is there anything you want to say to this group? Anything you want them to know?\n\nA: Main Street. And they’re all the same.\n\nQ: What’s all the same?\n\nDo we need to go to Main Street? Give us an address on Main Street and we’d be tempted to go.\n\nWhat do you call the Frau in this room?\n\nThe female spirit in here, what is her name?\n\nSession 2 (Red Group):\n\nA: Devil\n\nQ: That’s a good start. (We then went around the circle to introduce ourselves)\n\nA: Are you sure (said just as someone said their name)?\n\nQ: Can you tell us what your name is?\n\nHow many people are in here with us?\n\nA: A young one.\n\nQ: A young one? What’s their name?\n\nA: Nina.\n\nQ: Well, hi, Nina! Nina, do you want to play?\n\nThere’s a ball on the floor, Nina. If you want to roll it across the floor, any of us would be glad to play with you.\n\nA: Moving.\n\nQ: What’s moving?\n\nA: I saw it.\n\nQ: What’d you see? Did you see the ball we’re talking about?\n\nA: A person.\n\nQ: Which person?\n\nA: It’s open.\n\nQ: What’s open?\n\nA: It’s mine.\n\nQ: What is?\n\nYou think that ball is yours?\n\nNina, can you share it with me?\n\nCan I have it?\n\nA: Attic.\n\nQ: It’s in the attic?\n\nIs it a toy?\n\nA: Nope.\n\nQ: Ok.

(With no response, we sat back down).\n\nA: Damage.\n\nQ: What’s damaged?\n\nIs it something we can fix?\n\nAre you standing over by this table of t-shirts, by any chance? (The guest felt a cold spot, while others thought she saw movement in that direction).\n\nA: On the river.\n\nSave them.\n\nQ: Who are we going to save?\n\nAre they on the river?\n\nA: When they’re gone.\n\nQ: When who’s gone?\n\nA: Downtown.\n\nQ: Downtown Evansville?\n\nA: Help them.\n\nQ: What can we do to help?\n\nA: Sinking.\n\nWe switched listeners at this point.\n\nA: Taking flight.\n\nQ: Where are you going?\n\nA: I don’t…\n\nNepal.\n\nQ: Can I go?\n\nDid you survive a disaster?\n\nA: (Listener said she heard a bunch of gun, “like a war”)\n\nRock me, please.\n\nQ: Are you a child?\n\nA: It’s a baby. It’s a baby!\n\nHelp me, please.\n\nHelp me.\n\nQ: How can we help you?\n\nWhere’s your mother?\n\nA: You can just get back! (Listener identified this as a strong male voice)\n\nQ: Are you in water?\n\nA: Go away. (Lexi, our photographer, had just walked into the room. So, she went to another room for a bit.)\n\nQ: Are you stuck?\n\nA: You must be quiet.\n\nQ: Why do we have to be quiet?\n\nA: Sleeping.\n\nQ: Is the baby sleeping?\n\nA: Help.\n\nQ: What do you need help with?\n\nA: (The listener couldn’t make it out in full but heard that somebody was in the hospital).\n\nQ: Who is in the hospital?\n\nA: Twelve people.\n\nQ: Are you talking about the disaster?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Are you referring to a war?\n\nWhy are there twelve people in the hospital?\n\nA: There’s something here right now.\n\nQ: Did something happen on the water?\n\nA: Catch me.\n\nQ: Is it a fire?\n\nA: No!\n\nQ: Something to do with water? Avalanche?\n\nDid someone drown?\n\nA: No!\n\nQ: Was there a flood?\n\nA: (Listener heard something in another language but didn’t recognize it)\n\nQ: Are you a mother looking for her baby?\n\nA: A long time ago.\n\nQ: Did you lose a baby?\n\nA: Shh. Yes.\n\nQ: Were you around in the 1937 flood?\n\nAre you giving birth?\n\nDid you have a boy or a girl?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Did you give birth here in Evansville, Indiana?\n\nA: Baby is.

Baby.\n\nYour inability.\n\nMusic.\n\nQ: What kind of music?\n\nA: What’d you say?\n\nQ: What kind of music?\n\nA: And I never. Would you?\n\nQ: Maybe?\n\nA: No. Music.\n\nQ: Can you move that ball right there?\n\nA: An apple?\n\nQ: It’s not an apple, it’s a ball.\n\nA: Shh.\n\nLoud music, and everyone’s certain.\n\nQ: What kind of music?\n\nA: Get her out!\n\nQ: Do we need to save somebody?\n\nA: Alive. Ball.\n\nQ: Can you play with the ball?\n\nA: Let’s push it.\n\nQ: Ok. Let’s roll it.

Hearing your own name can be quite a startling experience!\n\nSession Three (Orange Group):\n\nQ: Can you tell us what your name is?\n\nA: Anne.\n\nQ: It’s nice to meet you, Anne.\n\nAnne, is there anything that you want us to know?\n\nA: Breathing.\n\nQ: Were you a singer?

Is there more than one of you here with us?\n\nA: Danger.\n\nQ: Are you a male or a female?\n\nA: (Response in German, the listener doesn’t speak German so he couldn’t translate)\n\nQ: Male or female (Asked in German)?\n\nA: Bitte (German for ‘please’)\n\nQ: Are you a small child (In German)?\n\nA: I was really excited.\n\nQ: Did you enjoy dancing down here?\n\nA: Number one.\n\nQ: If you’re number one, who is number two?\n\nCan you teach us a song?\n\nCan you tell us the words?\n\nA: Bitte (German for ‘please’)\n\nQ: Do you sing with your friends?\n\nA: Did you know?\n\nQ: I didn’t, that’s why I’m asking if you could teach us your song.\n\nDid your grandma teach it to you?\n\nA: People.\n\nAt this point, we switched listeners.\n\nQ: What’s the name of your favorite song?\n\nA: Touch it.\n\nQ: Did you live in the city or the country?\n\nA: All better.\n\nQ: Did you visit the country?\n\nA: No school.\n\nQ: Was it summertime?\n\nDid your mother read to you?\n\nWhat was your favorite book?\n\nA: Give me forever.\n\nQ: Give me forever?\n\nA: Looks right.\n\nQ: Do you read often?\n\nDid you have another hobby that you did frequently?\n\nA: Rocking.\n\nQ: In a rocking chair or in a swing?\n\nA: Because God.\n\nQ: He is our Rock.\n\nAre you really religious?\n\nA: No.\n\nLook up.\n\nQ: What am I supposed to be seeing?\n\nCan you make any of these lights swing on the ceiling? That’d really be something.\n\nDo you move things in here?\n\nA: I just want to.\n\nQ: You just want to make things move? I would, too, if I were you.\n\nIs there anything you can move?\n\nCan you tell me how many fingers I’m holding up, if you can see me?\n\nA: Sorry.\n\nQ: That’s ok.\n\nA: Coffee. Not hot.\n\nQ: Ok, I was looking at the coffee maker. Is that you walking by the coffee maker?\n\nA: Father.\n\nQ: Did your father drink a lot of coffee?\n\nI keep seeing something move around the coffee maker, is that you?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nRiddle.\n\nHey.\n\nQ: Do you want to tell me a riddle?\n\nDo you know how to make coffee?\n\nA: In the right.\n\nQ: Do you like cookies?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Oh, I like cookies, too.\n\nA: With the boys, all of it.\n\nQ: Do you like cakes?\n\nA: Left off.\n\nQ: I like to dip my cookies.

I’m retired.\n\nA: Military.\n\nQ: You were in the military. Were you in WWII?\n\nA: Showing.\n\nQ: Can you tell me who is in charge here? Who is in charge in this building?\n\nIf I want to talk to the boss, who do I talk to?\n\nA: Definite.\n\nQ: There is a definite boss? I need to know who it is. Is it the lady that is seen down here sometimes?\n\nA: Now, she’ll be filled.\n\nQ: ‘Now, she’ll be filled’? That’s odd.\n\nA: This is.\n\nQ: I’m sure this is odd for you, talking to us like this. Not many people do talk to you like this.\n\nA: Your friend. (At this point I should note that it is Traci asking the question, so we assume the ghost is talking about Joni or another investigator).\n\nQ: My friend? Yeah, she talks to you like this, too.\n\nA: One.\n\nQ: Do you remember what my friend’s name is? We came here a couple of weeks ago. She is the boss, of our business anyway.\n\nA: No, old.\n\nFifty.\n\nQ: Are you fifty?\n\nA: You, definitely.\n\nQ: I’m not fifty. I’m getting there.\n\nWe’re going to wrap up, is there anything else you would like to say to us?\n\nA: Raggedy.\n\nQ: Are we looking raggedy?\n\nSession Four (Blue Group):\n\nQ: Can you tell us what your name is?\n\nWe were talking to several people earlier. Are any of you still with us?\n\nA: Open\n\nQ: What’s open?\n\nA: Who’s talking?\n\nQ: Who is talking to you? What’s their name?\n\nIs your name Christopher?\n\nHow long have you been here?\n\nDid you like being in the Rathskeller?\n\nA: Oh, my god!\n\nQ: Oh, my god, what?\n\nDo you have a favorite drink at the bar?\n\nWhat city are we in?\n\nA: Louisville.\n\nQ: Do you know what state we are in?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Do you know the city?\n\nA: Great, great (unintelligible).\n\nQ: Are you happy here?\n\nA: I want out.\n\nQ: What do you want out of?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Do you want out of here?\n\nA: Maybe.\n\nQ: Do you want us to leave with you?\n\nA: Not this time.\n\nQ: Are you happy that we’re here? (The guest was advised to tread lightly with this line of\n\nquestioning. We want to be as respectful to the ghosts as possible, so if they tell us to leave – we leave.)\n\nA: The boys are.\n\nIt takes your breath away.\n\nQ: What takes your breath away?\n\nA: I don’t know.\n\nQ: Were you born in Evansville?\n\nA: It’s possible.\n\nQ: Do you know where you were born?\n\nA: France.\n\nQ: Parlez-vous français?

Is there anything else you want to say right now?\n\nA: Wait and see.\n\nQ: Ok, we’ll wait and see.\n\nWe switched out listeners and dove back in.\n\nQ: We have someone new listening. Are you going to continue talking to us? We would enjoy it if you would. We’ve very much enjoyed our conversations tonight.\n\nA: Back of the bar.\n\nQ: Are you at the back of the bar? Are you who I saw earlier tonight?\n\nA: Why?\n\nQ: I’m just curious. I want to say ‘hi’ to you.\n\nHow long were you a member here?\n\nWere you a bartender here?\n\nAre you drinking beer?\n\nDo you have a favorite German food?\n\nDo you like when they have big events like weddings?\n\nA: Do you have any questions?\n\nQ: Am I standing or sitting?\n\nA: Right.\n\nQ: Am I wearing a watch?\n\nDo you know what type of flowers are in the corner?\n\nDo you know what instrument is in the corner?\n\nA: Come on!\n\nQ: Where are we going?\n\nA: Back to the neighborhood.\n\nQ: Which neighborhood?\n\nA: Up the river.\n\nQ: Which river?\n\nDo you like this area?\n\nA: Its property.\n\nQ: What about this property do you like?\n\nDo you have a favorite room in this property?\n\nWhat’s your favorite place in the world?\n\nDoes pineapple go on pizza? In your opinion.\n\nCould you move that ball?\n\nA: Gets on the tour.\n\nQ: For what?\n\nDo you ever get tired of hanging out in this bar and want to go over to (unintelligible)’s\n\nhouse?\n\nA: Waiting on earth.\n\nQ: Does he like ice cream?\n\nA: I need directions from home.\n\nQ: Where do you live at?\n\nA: Up the river.\n\nQ: Do you travel by boat?\n\nA: I encourage you to go there.\n\nQ: Would you rather have whiskey or beer?\n\nA: They sure are.\n\nQ: Do you like them both?\n\nA: Trips.I love trips.\n\nQ: Where all have you been?\n\nHave you ever spent the night at the Hilltop Inn?\n\nA: We got a new floor.\n\nQ: Is it a wooden floor?\n\nIs it a stone floor?\n\nHow old are you?\n\nDo you have children?\n\nA: No.\n\nI require them for writing.\n\nQ: What’s your favorite food?\n\nWhat’s up the river? It seems like a recurring topic.\n\nAre you from Louisville? Someone mentioned that town either this session or the last. Is\n\nthat where you are from?\n\nA: I want to put that theory to the test.\n\nQ: So do I!\n\nSo, is that where you are from?\n\nWhat other theories do you want to test? I like testing theories.\n\nLet’s test the theory of whether you can see me or not. How many fingers am I holding\n\nup?\n\nA: I saw my brother.\n\nQ: What’s his name?\n\nA: I’m serious!\n\nQ: Ok, me, too! I want to know what your brother’s name is. I have brothers.Their names are\n\nNick and Ryan.

Or Karl?\n\nBobby or Randy?\n\nHow many are in the room with us right now?\n\nA: Sunday.\n\nQ: Yes, tomorrow is Sunday. Do you go to church?\n\nTomorrow is also Father’s Day. Do you have any children?\n\nA: There’s a favorite.\n\nQ: Have you lived here long?\n\nDo you like the hot weather we’re having?\n\nI would rather have it cooler, but it is summer. What’s your favorite time of the year?\n\nWhen you said there is a favorite, does that mean you had a favorite child?\n\nA: Son.\n\nQ: Did you say your son? Is your son your favorite?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What’s his name?\n\nIs he all grown up?\n\nA: The best one.\n\nQ: You really do have a favorite kid don’t you? Why is he the best?\n\nIs he a member here?\n\nWe’re getting ready to switch listeners, is there anything you would like to say before we do?\n\nThe spirit box turned itself off right as we decided to switch listeners; Traci was able to turn it back on and functioned properly afterwards.\n\nQ: Ok, we have a new listener if you want to talk to her. You can tell us whatever you want us to hear. We’re going to be wrapping up the night before too long, so there’s not a lot of opportunity tonight to tell us more. Is there something we need to know?\n\nDo you like being here?\n\nDo you like the Rathskeller?\n\nA: Music playing.\n\nQ: Do you like music?\n\nA: Some.\n\nQ: Do you like to play with us? Can you play with the ball?\n\nA: (The listener said she could hear the piano playing)\n\nQ: Can you play the piano?\n\nDo you like the piano?\n\nA: Whatever.\n\nQ: So, do you play a lot of instruments?\n\nA: (The listener commented, “Oh, all kinds of music coming out!” This hadn’t been happening to anyone else throughout the night.)\n\nQ: Were you one of our founding fathers?\n\nWere you an officer of Germania?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: When I was listening, you mentioned something about a favorite son, is that correct?\n\nA: Do you sing, too?\n\nYes, you sing, too.\n\nHe sings, too.\n\nQ: (Traci explained that the listener might be hearing a conversation between two or more ghosts, which can happen sometimes during the Estes Method.)\n\nCan you sing for us?\n\nA: Playing. Playing for.\n\nQ: Can you sing a few notes of your favorite song?\n\nA: (Listener said she heard “all different kinds of music” again.)\n\nQ: Were you a musician in the building?\n\nWere you part of the Rathskeller band?\n\nDo you ever go swimming in the Ohio River?\n\nA: To keep it secret.\n\nQ: Have you been in this building very long?\n\nDo you go to bed early?\n\nA: Up.\n\nQ: Do you like to stay up?\n\nA: For the fun of it.\n\n(Listener heard “1907 or 1927 or something”)\n\nJune 20th.\n\nQ: (As a group we discussed the dates of the 1937 flood, which was in January-February).\n\nDo you remember the big flood in Evansville?\n\nA: Let’s go.\n\nQ: Where do you want to go?\n\nA: I come here.\n\nQ: Uh-huh. Yeah, you came here, but you don’t have to stay here. You could go. Or you could wander around the neighborhood and look at all the buildings. I’m sure it looks different than from when you were here. Where do you want to go?\n\nA: Totally. It’s totally.\n\nQ: It’s totally what?\n\nWe’re going to switch again. Is there anything else you would like to say?\n\nA: More music.\n\nWe switched to our last listener of the night and hoped we hadn’t worn the ghosts out yet.\n\nQ: We’re having our last listener of the night. Now that we’re wrapping up, remember all of those important things you want to say to somebody you can tell us now.\n\nA: Hello.\n\nQ: Hello. My name is Traci, what’s your name?\n\nYou don’t have to be scared.\n\nAre there still kids here?\n\nCan you hear what we’re asking? Do you understand what we’re asking?\n\nWe just want to understand. Can you give us some sort of indication that you know why\n\nwe’re here?\n\nAre you at peace here in this building?\n\nAre you content here?\n\nIs there anything you’d like us to know?\n\nHave you been to the Volksfest? They have really good food there?\n\nHave you been to their Christmas dinner and play?\n\nYou mentioned something about June 20th. What’s so important about June 20th?\n\nEddie, are you still with us?\n\nTraci reiterated that not everyone is able to do the Estes Method. She also pointed out that we may have worn the ghosts out for the night. It likely takes a lot of energy for them to communicate with us, and these ghosts haven’t had the experience of a full investigation before. With that in mind, we decided to let the ghosts go to bed for the night.\n\nOverall, the Rathskeller proved to be a very haunted location in the building! The ghosts were talkative and definitely gave enough information to head down the research rabbit hole.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt was an interesting investigation and the first we’ve done at Germania Maennerchor. We definitely had some intelligent responses, but the best one of the night came from Jason’s second session (Blue Group) on the stage. Someone broke into the building and stole copper piping. He asked who did it and the ghosts told him, “It was a cop.” I would suggest that they look at anyone who dresses like a policeman. If the man worked security somewhere in town, it would make sense he wore his uniform when he broke in and stole the pipes to prevent anyone from questioning him being in the building. They probably couldn’t do a lot with the information, but it would give them more insight into the break in.\n\nThank you to Germania Maennerchor for hosting us and helping out with the event. Additional gratitude to my team for making it happen. We had a lot of issues at the beginning of the event, but everyone worked through them to provide the best possible experience for our guests. And thank you to our guests who joined us. We are working on two additional events right now, so stay tuned!\n\nThe Ribeyre Gymnasium is a focal point of downtown New Harmony. Whether you can see it or not, you will certainly hear it as it chimes out to announce the hour and the half hour. I’ve always thought of it as the heartbeat of New Harmony because no matter where you are when it rings, everyone’s thoughts are pulled to the same location.\n\nThe gym was built for the children of New Harmony in 1924, providing them with more space than their previous gym. They’d barely had a chance to break it in when it was used for a tragic purpose that would change its history forever.\n\nOn March 18, 1925, an F-5 tornado cut a 219 mile path through three states. It destroyed 15,000 homes, injured more than 2,000 and ended the lives of 695 people. One of the communities that was hit the hardest was the town of Griffin, Indiana, which is six miles north of New Harmony. The entire town was destroyed, killing 41 people and injuring another 202. Five days later, another five people died, bringing the death toll to 46.\n\nNew Harmony offered assistance and brought many of the dead and dying to the brand new Ribeyre Gymnasium. The injured people were attended to on the gymnasium floor and the dead bodies were brought downstairs to the basement, turning it into a temporary morgue. The building has been haunted ever since.\n\nOver the years, people have witnessed the apparition of children playing on the bleachers. They’ve heard their giggles and phantom footsteps. Items in the kitchen have been flung across the room and lights have gone on and off without benefit of a human hand.\n\nEven though this marked Haunted New Harmony’s eighth investigation of the gymnasium, we never know what to expect. Sometimes, the activity is so nominal we struggle to get a handful of EVPs and other times we have a phenomenal investigation with personal experiences and more EVP communication than we anticipated. This investigation would prove to be the later.\n\nWe divided into four teams and spent the evening moving between four separate zones.\n\nBasement\n\nTraci Hoehn led groups in the basement, demonstrating the Estes Method. This technique was developed in Estes, Colorado at the Stanley Hotel by Connor Randall, Michelle Tate, and Karl Pfeiffer who led tours in the haunted hotel. Essentially, a participant wears a blindfold and noise-cancelling headphones connected directly to a spirit box. The group asks questions of the ghosts in the room and asked them to tell the participant their answers. This prevents people from hearing what they expect to hear. Since the participant is connected to the spirit box, they can’t hear what is being asked. They simply call out what they hear. When the answers match up to the questions, it’s a phenomenal experience.\n\nWe invited psychic medium, Ashley Morrow, to help us with our sessions. She’s been to many of our investigations and always amazes us with her findings. We had her do the first Estes Session and then asked for volunteers from the group to do the rest.\n\nFirst Session (Red Group, led by Jason Nelson)\n\nTraci started by telling them about some of the history and then explained the process. She then turned off the lights to give them a taste of what it would have been like to have been down there. I’m pretty sure everyone was relieved when she turned the lights back on.\n\nThey introduced themselves and got started.\n\nQ: Can you tell me your name?\n\nA: My name is William.\n\nQ: Are you ready to talk to us?\n\nA: Storm.\n\nQ: Yes, there is a storm outside.\n\nA: I saw the storm.\n\nA: Why are you here?\n\nQ: To talk to you.

I don’t know where.\n\nQ: Do you have any friends here?\n\nA: One.\n\nQ: Who is it?\n\nA: That’s Sam.\n\nQ: Do you have a pet?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: How old is Sam?\n\nA: He’s older.\n\nQ: Is Sam your friend?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: Where did you and your family like to go on vacation?\n\nA: He’s over there. In the corner.\n\nQ: Who’s in the corner?\n\nA: Can you see him?\n\nQ: Is he behind me in the corner?\n\nQ: I’m going to take a photograph. Do you think we’ll see him?\n\nA: Maybe. Why are you here?\n\nQ: We just want to talk to you. Can we be your friend?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: I’m sorry to hear that.

William, are you still here with us? Do you like to read?\n\nQ: Are we speaking to someone besides William?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Were you born in 1918?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: How many other people are here with you right now? Are you still here with us? Is there a woman here with us? Where are you right now? Where’s Sam right now? Do you like to play baseball?\n\nA: Someone’s coming.\n\nQ: Who’s coming? How many people are down here with us? William, are you still with us? Is Sam still with you?\n\nThey pulled him out and put someone else in his place.\n\nQ: We’ve switched again. Maybe you like talking to the ladies more than the guys. Is there anyone here who’d like to talk to us?\n\nA: Right now.\n\nQ: Is there something you want us to know? Can you tell me what color jacket I’m wearing?\n\nA: Black.\n\nQ: Very good. So you can see me. Can you tell me how many fingers I’m holding up? Are we still talking to William?

Can you move close to the green light on the ground.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can you make the lights light up?\n\nA: Maybe.\n\nQ: What color are our wristbands?\n\nTime was up, so they ended the session.\n\nSecond Session (Blue Group led by Jaimie Haney)\n\nTraci gave them an overview of the history and explained the process. They then got started. Once again, Ashley Morrow started them off with the Estes Method. They introduced themselves.\n\nQ: I’m back here with a second group. Can you tell us your name?\n\nA: Anna.\n\nQ: Anna! I’m so glad you’re back. (Traci explained that Anna was there for our first investigation.)\n\nA: It’s storming like Bad Day.\n\nQ: It’s okay. You’ll be okay.\n\nA: I’m okay. I’m here with you.\n\nQ: Has anyone been able to see you down here?\n\nA: I’m by you.\n\nQ: Do you make noises down here?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Are you happy down here?\n\nA: I move around.\n\nQ: Are you by yourself?\n\nA: Never by myself.\n\nQ: Is your family here?\n\nA: I’m standing over here.

Hello!\n\nQ: Can you tell us what you look like?\n\nA: Griffin.\n\nQ: Yes, you’re from Griffin, but what do you look like? Do you wear a pretty dress?\n\nA: Maybe.\n\nQ: What’s your favorite color, Anna?\n\nA: I’m running around. Can you hear me?\n\nQ: No. I’m sorry. I can’t hear you. Can you make more noise?\n\nA: I’m trying.\n\nQ: Can you remember if you’d been to school or were on the way home when the storm hit?\n\nA: I was on the bus.\n\nQ: Did you have a lot of friends.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Did you have a lot of brothers and sisters?\n\nA: I don’t remember.\n\nQ: Did you have any pets?\n\nA: I’m not sure why I’m here.\n\nQ: Maybe you’re here to make everyone happy.\n\nA: I’m safe here.\n\nQ: Do you like to hear the storms?\n\nA: Yea. You’re pretty.\n\nQ: Thanks, Anna!\n\nQ: There’s other kids here.\n\nA: Yeah. They went to school with me. But I’m not sure why we’re all here.\n\nQ: Do you know where your parents are?\n\nA: no.\n\nQ: Did you have a dog or cat?\n\nA: I had a big dog.\n\nQ: What was your dog’s name?\n\nA: Chloe.\n\nQ: Hi Anna!\n\nA: Hi!\n\nQ: Did you have a favorite toy?\n\nA: I had a doll.\n\nQ: Did you doll have a name?\n\nA: I don’t remember.\n\nQ: Can you tell us the name of your friends?\n\nA: Sam’s here.\n\nQ: Can you and Sam show us you are here?\n\nA: Can I touch that light?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: I’ll try.\n\nQ: That would be really cool if we could see you. I bet Sam can help you with the light.\n\nA: I’ll go get him.\n\nQ: Are you and Sam good friends?\n\nA: Yeah. He’s here.\n\nQ: HI Sam! Can you and Anna show us your presence?\n\nA: I’m not sure.\n\nQ: That’s okay. We really like to talk to you.\n\nQ: Anna, are there any animals here?\n\nA: We’re not sure why you’re here.\n\nQ: Do you go upstairs and play too? How many kids are down here now?\n\nA: I’m trying to touch the light but I don’t think it’s working.\n\nA: Why are you laughing?\n\nQ: We were asking funny questions.\n\nA: Oh.\n\nQ: Can you make the lights flicker?\n\nA: I’m happier here.\n\nQ: Do you see any animals here?\n\nA: Sam’s playing.\n\nQ: Is William still here? Anna, are you friends with William? (Traci asked)\n\nA: I know you.\n\nQ: I’ve come here to see you before.\n\nA: You’ve been here before.\n\nQ: Do you remember my name?\n\nA: Your name is Traci!\n\nQ: I remember you too. I’m happy to be back to talk to you.\n\nA: You like the basement.\n\nQ: I do like the basement. Do you like the basement, Anna?\n\nA: I do. My friends and I play here. It’s big.\n\nQ: Do you like to play in the dirt?\n\nA: You are.\n\nQ: I have been with my feet, haven’t I? Do you like making drawings in the dirt?\n\nA: I’m not sure. I’m over here. Can you see me?\n\nQ: Are you behind me?\n\nA: I’m really trying?\n\nQ: Where are you?\n\nA: By the door.\n\nQ: I know you’re really trying. Thank you. Are there any grown ups down here with you?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Just kids, huh? Do you like to play pranks?\n\nA: yeah.\n\nQ: Do you want to help me play a prank, Anna?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: Do you know who Joni is? She’s the lady in the kitchen.\n\nA: There’s a lot of people in the kitchen.\n\nQ: There are. But if you went to the kitchen and yelled, “BOO!” it would be a lot of fun.\n\nQ: Do you like books, Anna?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: How about coloring? Did you have coloring crayons? Do you know what those are?\n\nA: Yeah. Do you know why I’m here?\n\nQ: I think you’re just here hanging out.\n\nA: Okay. I like it here.\n\nQ: Can you keep trying to touch the light?\n\nA: Blue.\n\nQ: Is Sam still down here?\n\nA: This storm scares me.\n\nQ: It’s okay. It’s quiet outside.\n\nA: That’s why I like the basement. The basement’s safe.\n\nQ: Okay, Anna. We’re going to give someone else a chance to listen. Is that okay?\n\nA: Okay.\n\nThey switched people Jaime Haney, who is an experienced investigator, remarked about how amazing that experience was. She’s done many Estes Sessions and has never heard such a perfect back and forth response.\n\nQ: Anna, can you tell me your favorite color?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Yes, you have a favorite color?\n\nA: I was.\n\nQ: Anna, did you help your mother in the kitchen?\n\nThe participant took off the headphones. She said she was just hearing static. They put someone else in.\n\nA: Now girl. That’s fine.\n\nQ: Anna, is that you talking to us? We’re really curious about your last name. Can you tell us?\n\nA: Here.\n\nQ: My last name is Hoehn. What’s yours?\n\nA: Saturday night.\n\nThey switched participants.\n\nA: I’m here.\n\nQ: Anna, when you were in trouble by your mama, what did she call you. Were you Anna Marie? What were you called?\n\nA: My mama called me baby. I was her baby.\n\nQ: You were a good girl, weren’t you Anna? Or were you sneaky and just didn’t get caught?\n\nA: That one.\n\nQ: Do you remember what she called you?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Do you want to tell us? Did you have a brother or sister?\n\nA: A baby brother.\n\nQ: If you were picking on your baby brother, what would your mother say to you?\n\nA: I don’t know. I’m sorry.\n\nQ: That’s okay. What was your favorite thing to do?\n\nA: I liked baking with Mama.\n\nQ: What kind of pies?\n\nA: Apple. Mama made them pretty?\n\nQ: Did you have an apple triee?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Were they red or green apples?\n\nA: That one.\n\nQ: Green apples?\n\nA: uh huh.\n\nQ: Did you like green apples?\n\nA: They’re the best.\n\nQ: Do you like to run around this place?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: Do you play hide and seek?\n\nA: I do that all the time.\n\nQ: That’s my favorite. You can jump out and scare people.\n\nA: Sometimes.\n\nQ: Thank you for talking to us.\n\nA: You’re welcome.\n\nQ: Hey Anna. It’s Carmen again. When you went to school, did your teacher take attendance every day?\n\nA: I think so.\n\nQ: Did she say everybody’s whole name. Their last name too?\n\nA: No. I was the only one.\n\nQ: What other things did you like to eat?\n\nQ: Anna, we’re going to switch groups, but we’ll be right back with more people.\n\nA: Okay. I’ll stay. Bye!!\n\nJaime tried to explain to the group what a phenomenal experience they just had listening to Ashley do the Estes. I have to agree. I too have witnessed many sessions and have never heard anyone do this as perfectly as Ashley. The groups had no idea how lucky they were.\n\nThird Session (Orange Group led by Sara Conyers)\n\nTraci provided them with the history and techniques they’d be using. She turned off the light to give them a feel for what it would be like down there. Everyone was thankful when she turned it back on. They introduced themselves and got started with Ashley using the Estes Method.\n\nQ: Hello! We’re back again!\n\nA: You’re back!\n\nQ: We’re going to go around the circle and introduce ourselves so you know who you’re talking to. Can you tell us your name?\n\nA: My name is Anna!\n\nQ: Hi Anna! I’m so glad you’re back. Can you tell them something about yourself?\n\nA: I’m here.\n\nA: These are new people!\n\nQ: They are!

But she doesn’t want to talk.\n\nQ: Did you ride the school bus that day with William and Sam?\n\nA: Can Sam talk?\n\nQ: Yes. What do you want to say, Sam?\n\nA: He says he doesn’t want to talk. Sorry.\n\nQ: That’s okay.\n\nA: Can I go back to school?\n\nQ: Yes, you can. Do you miss school?\n\nA: I love school.\n\nQ: I did too.

(thunder rumbled). I don’t like storms.\n\nQ: It’s okay, Anna. We’re safe down here in the basement.\n\nA: Okay. My favorite color is yellow. (someone said she was asking that color in her head)\n\nQ: You like yellow.\n\nA: I like yellow.\n\nQ: I saw an orb that was yellow. Was that you?\n\nA: the school had yellow flowers.\n\nQ: Do you like flowers?

We had a nine year old girl in our group and she wanted to give it a try. We normally require participants to be 14 or older, but she was an exception.\n\nQ: Okay, Anna. We have someone closer to your age. Can you say hi to us?\n\nQ: Can you tell me what color jacket I’m wearing? Do you like having a friend here with us tonight?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: It’s okay to talk to her.\n\nA: Color.\n\nQ: Is your favorite color yellow?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nA: Happy.\n\nQ: We’re happy to be here.

Who here is wearing a purple shirt?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: Okay, Anna. We’re almost finished. Is there anything else you’d like to tell us?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: We’re going to stop now, but we’ll be back again with more people.\n\nEveryone was so impressed by Bryley. She did an amazing job. They didn’t have time for another session, but Traci passed the headphones around to let people hear what the participants were hearing. They ended the session.\n\nFourth Session (Yellow Group led by Kathy Hoffman)\n\nTraci introduced them and explained the process.\n\nA: You’re back!\n\nQ: Yes, we’re back.

The rain is just scary.\n\nQ: I know it’s scary, but it can’t hurt you.\n\nA: I just don’t want to make her sad again?\n\nQ: You mean Ashley?\n\nA: yeah. (Traci explained that Ashley got sad during her sessions)\n\nQ: Ashley is okay. Don’t worry about her.\n\nA: They’re loud up there. (The group upstairs were loud (footsteps)\n\nA: You need to tell them to be quiet.\n\nQ: Okay. I’ll tell them.

We’re going to let someone else listen. Is that okay?\n\nA: Yeah. But I like her.\n\nQ: I like her too.\n\nThe time came to an end. Everyone was sad to leave the little girl in the basement, but there wasn’t much more we could do. We’d like to go back soon and see if we can get her to cross over into the light. Sometimes this is easier said than done, especially with children. This is all she’s known for a very long time. But we will try.\n\nKitchen\n\nI led the investigation in the kitchen. During our last investigation at the gymnasium, I used the stage for my sessions, but there was too much interference between the gym session and the stage sessions, so I wanted to try something different. Another reason for moving the session to the kitchen was due to the reports of activity there. The people who oversee the building have experienced quite a few strange happenings in this room.\n\nSeveral times, the ice scoop that sits on top of the ice maker in the corner has flown across the room. Sara would hear the crash from the gymnasium. When she walked in to check it out, she’d find the scoop on the floor across the room, with no explanation on how it got there.\n\nDuring an investigation there several years ago, my group was investigating on the gymnasium floor. We all heard and saw a man walk across the room and into the kitchen. He was whistling a happy tune. When I got up to see who he was and why he was walking around during the middle of an investigation, the kitchen was empty. The only way out was to go through the basement door. As I walked into the kitchen, the group from the basement was walking up the stairs and didn’t see a man pass through. We’ve asked who he was in several later sessions there, but we’ve never gotten a response.\n\nI decided to test out a new piece of equipment. It’s actually a phone app called GhostTube Vox. I’ll start out by telling you that I’m normally not a fan of phone apps. Most of them are “for entertainment purposes only.” Several that really irk me are the EMF detectors and SLS cameras. Those pieces of equipment require special components you won’t find inside a cell phone, no matter how smart it is. When you see a stick figure pop up on the screen, it’s just part of the programming and not a ghost. Ghost Radar is another app that makes my eye twitch. It supposedly shows a radar screen with dots on it, purporting to be ghosts closing in on the person holding the phone. If technology like this actually existed, we’d no longer have a need to prove the existence of ghosts. We’d just pull them up on our Ghost Radar. This VOX app was different. I heard about it from another investigator and tested it out several times before the investigation. It is basically a spirit box that uses internet radio stations,\n\nFirst Session (Yellow Group)\n\nI explained the equipment I was using for our session and then got started. We introduced ourselves, which is something we do for every investigation. If we are coming into someone else’s home, which it really is, we aren’t going to be rude. We’re going to tell them who we are and why we are there. I’ve found it increases their chances of actually communicating with us. Plus that, I’m just simply not going to be rude.\n\nUnfortunately, it took me almost five full minutes to figure out that my phone wasn’t picking up a signal inside the brick building. Once I moved my phone to the window, we got our first response and it was a doozy.\n\n“World class app!” a male voice said. If it was said in sarcasm, I kind of understand where he was coming from. If it was as great as I was promoting it to be, it took me a minute to figure it out.\n\nWe started getting responses right away, but they were difficult to make out. When one of the guests asked a question, we heard what sounded like someone spitting. One of our guests was a medium and said she was picking up a man of German descent and he spit when he was asked a question because he didn’t like her question (it was: what is your favorite animal?). When she mentioned it, his response was, “Well?”\n\nAs we started to continue the session, a male voice with an English accent asked, “You guys like this app?” Before we could respond, a very bored sounding male voice said, “Anyways…”\n\nIn the meantime, we were doing breakout sessions in the two small attic spaces. Rosie Benton, who is a friend of mine, was escorting groups of two and three to the spaces for ten minute pendulum sessions. The first group came back and told us they were talking to a ten year-old boy. He said the attic was a boy’s club and that no girls were allowed.\n\nResponses started coming through while we were asking questions, which made it difficult to interpret. When we’d ask a question and allow empty space for them to answer, we often didn’t get a response. Someone asked them to repeat what they said and a male voice said, “Just one.”\n\nWe got an actual EVP during this session, which is pretty astounding. Instead of answering through the phone app, he whispered into the recorder. A guest asked if he was a boy or a girl and a male voice whispered, “Nothing.” This is sad, but actually fairly accurate. Without a human body, they are spirit, which is without gender.\n\nResponses kept coming. Some of them made sense and some of them didn’t. There was a pause between people when the VOX helpfully told us, “Your turn.” The person whose turn it was asked what his name was and he told him, “Robert.”\n\nWe then got one of the most intelligent responses of the night. I normally take a lot of photos during the sessions to post with this blog, but my phone was being used for the VOX app. I asked Kathy to take pictures of her group and then a male voice told us, “Phone’s over there.” And it was. It was across the room on the windowsill, hooked up via Bluetooth to the speaker on the table in front of us.\n\nOne member of the group asked what his name was and he told her, “It’s raining.” It was raining. In fact, it was building up for a massive thunderstorm.\n\nWe then heard a little girl tell us. “Love it.”\n\nSomeone asked if the ghost she was talking to in the attic could make his presence known and we heard what sounded like a fart across the VOX. This made the group laugh. I told the group, “I bet you’ve never heard one of those before,” and someone made a raspberry sound. Apparently the ghosts there have a sense of humor.\n\n“You’re being awful quiet,” one guest said. A voice on the VOX told him, “With some people.” I can absolutely relate to this.\n\nWith that, the session ended and everyone moved onto break, followed by their next session.\n\nSecond Session (Orange Group)\n\nAs we started our second session, the thunderstorm roared overhead with booming thunder and frequent cracks of lightning. It definitely served to enhance the atmosphere. Someone asked what their name was and a female voice told them, “Leisel.” This is interesting because my first group kept thinking they were hearing German responses.\n\nA guest asked if they like talking to us and a man told her, “It’s awful.” This was the same male voice with the English accent we heard in the first session. He identified himself as Robert.\n\nSomeone asked for his name and he said, “Deerford.”\n\nAnother guest asked how many spirits were in the room and a woman said, “Talk to Ed.”\n\nDuring the previous session, Rosie Benton was picking up there was a pregnant woman there. She asked about it again and the entire group got quiet because she didn’t specify that it was a “ghost woman.” I laughed when she said it again during this session and filled the group in on the joke. She said, “it wasn’t me,” and the ghost said, “I bet.”\n\nIt wasn’t long afterwards that I caught another EVP. An EVP isn’t heard at the time. The digital recorder picks it up and I hear it later when I’m reviewing the audio recordings. I typically try to do a few validating questions. If I get an intelligent, direct answer, I know I’m actually talking to someone and it isn’t just a fluke. I held up three fingers and asked if they knew how many fingers I was holding up. A whispery voice said, “Three.” This was astounding. We seldom get actual EVPs, so it was special to hear this.\n\nWe got a few random words that didn’t necessarily apply to the question being asked. I didn’t clip them because they didn’t provide us with any further information, but when I heard the same female voice from earlier say, “It’s so wonderful,” I felt compelled to share it. It didn’t apply to a question, but it was very clear.\n\nSince we were in the kitchen, someone asked about baking a cake. Someone else suggested it should be chocolate. A female voice on the VOX said, “I think so.” Next time we’ll have to bring a chocolate cake for her.\n\nSeveral angry sounding voices came through, so I asked why they were so angry. “We want you,” a deep male voice said, to which I replied, “No you don’t!” If you’ve read any of my paranormal books, you’ll clearly understand why I say this. I’ve had far too many menacing entities follow me home and I didn’t want to experience this again.\n\nI don’t know if I’ve ever had a ghost call me stupid before, but it happened that night. I asked if they had anything else to say to us and a female voice said, “Stupid.”\n\nI had nearly forgotten about the creepy male voice that said “we want you,” until he said it again. This sends chills down my spine.\n\nThird Session (Blue Group)\n\nMy friend, Jaime Haney, led this group. She’s a local artist and paranormal investigator with years of experience. I asked her if she would lead a group for us and she was on board. It’s always nice to have someone experienced leading the groups.\n\nWe’d barely gotten started when the deep creepy voice was back. Someone asked who we were talking to and he made a deep guttural sound that send chills down my spine. She asked what kind of noise was that and he responded with, “You mind it?”\n\nHe kept popping in more frequently than before. Every time I heard it, my blood ran cold. I just prayed he wouldn’t be able to follow me home later. It became difficult to concentrate on the investigation as I grew more and more concerned.\n\nFinally, we got a voice that wasn’t deep and threatening. Jaime asked If they could say their name and a pleasant sounding man told her, “Peter Waiter.”\n\nShortly afterwards, a woman on the VOX asked, “Can you see” and a male voice answered her. “I can’t see,” he said. You can hear the thunder rumbling in the background. What did they mean? What was she asking him about?\n\nThe two breakout groups came down from the attic. The two woman learned there was a secret being kept, but they wouldn’t divulge what it was. The other group didn’t have any experiences, which seemed to be the case with the attic to the right of the stage for the duration of the night. The left side attic seemed to be the most active.\n\nJaime asked me about something that happened to me several months ago. I have security cameras around my house, like many people do, for home security and just a general knowledge of what is going on outside the walls of my home. One morning I woke up and listened to the events my camera recorded and one of them was especially creepy. It said, “We are coming.” It sounded eerily like the voice that had been stalking my kitchen investigations. Curious, I asked if they knew who left that message for me. The deep, dark voice quickly responded. “No,” he said simply.\n\nAs if things couldn’t get creepier, the storm sirens began ringing. It felt too familiar, too close to the history of this building. Storm sirens could mean thunderstorms, but the"
