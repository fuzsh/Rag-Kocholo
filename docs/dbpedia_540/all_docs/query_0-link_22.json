        "text": "DAVID HAUGH, one of the sturdy representatives farmers of Monroe Township, Carroll County, was born in Pittsburgh, Penn., Oct. 12, 1824, a son of John and Jean (Graham) Haugh, both natives of Scotland, the former a son of James Haugh and born May 26, 1778, latter a daughter of William and Elizabeth Graham and born Oct. 27, 1785. John and Jean Haugh were married May 31, 1803, and had the following named children: James (I), born Jul. 14, 1804, died in infancy; William, born May 19, 1806; John, Mar. 26, 1808; James (II), Apr. 21, 1810; Andrew, Aug. 16, 1812; Elizabeth, May 16, 1815; Robert (I), Aug. 14, 1817, all born in Scotland; and Samuel, born May 31, 1819; Robert (II), Feb. 25, 1822; David, Oct. 12, 1824; Mary, May 25, 1827, all born in Pittsburgh, Penn.\n\nIn 1818 John Haugh immigrated to the United States with his family, and they took up their residence in Pittsburgh, Penn., where he was in the employ of John Gibb manufacturer of alum, vitriol, soap, candles, etc., until 1836, in which year he moved to Carroll County, Ohio. Here he purchased the farm now owned by his son David, at that time containing ninety acres, to which our subject has since added twenty acres, to which our subject has since added twenty acres, aggregating a fine farm of 110 acres of well-improved land. The father died Dec. 21, 1865, the mother Oct. 30, 1869, both members of the United Presbyterian Church. In politics Mr. Haugh was first a Whig, and afterward a Republican.\n\nDavid Haugh, the subject proper of this memoir, received his education partly at the public schools of Pittsburgh, and partly at the common schools of Monroe Township, in the meantime securing a thoroughly practical training n the science of farming, which has been his life vocation. On Nov. 23, 1848, he was married to Mary R. Moffett, who was born Oct. 13, 1827, in Monroe Township, Carroll County, daughter of Nathan and Sarah (King) Moffatt, which union has been blessed with nine children, of whom the following is a brief record: John, born Mar. 27, 1850, resides in Dell Roy, Ohio; William G., born Mar. 29, 1852, lives in Canton, Ohio; Robert B., born Feb. 7, 1854, Sarah J., born July 17, 1856, Mary E., born Mr. 7, 1859, and Annie M., born Mar. 25, 1861, are all four deceased; Andrew E., born Jun. 8, 1863, is still at home; Grant H., born Feb. 7, 1866, is deceased; Ross L., born Jul. 19, 1867, is yet under the parental roof. The mother of this family died Apr. 12, 1871, a member of the United Presbyterian Church, and Nov. 7, 1872, Mr. Haugh was united in marriage with Mrs. Elizabeth Bolling, who was born Oct. 30, 1841, a daughter of Adam and Catherine (Stoody) Beamer. Mr. and Mrs. Haugh are members of the United Presbyterian Church; in his political preferments he has always been a solid republican, and has held several township offices. Our subject has lived on the same farm ever since coming to it with his parents in 1836, and he has made many substantial improvements thereon erecting comfortable and commodious buildings.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 1134 REV. JAMES H. HAWK, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at Carrollton, Carroll County, was born Sept. 3, 1846, in Westmoreland County, Penn. His father, George Hawk, is a native of the same county, where he has always followed agricultural pursuits, and where he was married, in 1842, to Martha McKallip, a native of County Down, Ireland, who, when a child, was brought by her parents to this country, and to Pennsylvania. Mr. and Mrs. George Hawk had a family of six children - three sons and three daughters - and of these the subject of this sketch is the third in order of birth. His boyhood was passed in assisting his parents on the farm and attending the district schools, distant from his home about a mile and a half, and at the age of sixteen years he entered the academy at Leechburg, Penn., being chosen, the following year, principal of the Leechburg High School. In the year 1868 Mr. Hawk commenced a classical course at Westminster (Penn.) College, after which he spent some eyars as teacher, and in 1871 he entered Allegheny Theological Seminary, at Allegheny, where he graduated in 1874, on the 23d day of April of which year he was ordained by the Clarion (Penn.) Presbytery.\n\nImmediately after ordination Mr. Hawk was installed pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Rimersburg, Perm., which incumbency he filled seven years, when, having received a call to fill the pulpit of the First Presbyterian Church at Greenfield, Ind., he proceeded thither in 1881. During his pastorate there the church received large accessions of membership, and when he left, at the end of three years, to respond to a call to the church in Franklin, Ohio, his departure was greatly regretted by members of the congregation. After a seven months' sojourn at Franklin, Mr. Hawk accepted a call to the charge of the church at Nelsonville, Ohio, whence, after a brief stay, he came, in 1886, to Carrollton, to enter upon his duties as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. Here his assiduous labors have been productive of much good, having been rewarded with numerous accessions and consequent large increase of membership, and the church is now in the enjoyment of an era of gratifying prosperity. He represented the Steubenville Presbytery at the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, held at Saratoga, N. Y., in 1890.\n\nIn June, 1869, our subject was united in marriage with Abbie Wilhelm, a native of Westmoreland County, Penn., and a descendant of the Steck family of that State, among whom are numbered many ministers of considerable prominence. Two children have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Hawk, viz.: Boynton L., who died at the age of two years; and Harold Brooks, who was born Feb. 1, 1879. Mr. Hawk, in his political preferments, is a Republican, and a strong supporter of protection.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 791 R. T. HAWKE, a representative and prosperous agriculturist, and a member of one of the oldest and most highly esteemed families of Brown Township, Carroll County, is a native of the same, born Mar. 28, 1855. His grandfather, Robert Hawke, was born July 18, 1753, near Castlefinn, County Donegal, Ireland, and was married to Hannah Russel, of the same place, who died in Ireland. Their children's names are William, Martha, John, Jane (who became Mrs. Robert McConal, of near Steubenville, Ohio), James, Eliza (who became Mrs. William Hamilton, of Brown Township, Carroll County), and Robert, father of our subject. Grandfather Hawke was one of the first five men to organize the First Presbyterian Church of Waynesburg, Ohio, in which church our subject now holds the offices of trustee, secretary and Sabath-school superintendent. In 1814 the family came to America and settled in Ohio, in what afterward became Brown Township, Carroll County. It is said that they were compelled to leave their native land on account of threats of violence at the hands of a gang of robbers, who had \"visited\" them as well as others. The Hawke family had \"informed\" on these outlaws, and the latter notified them that unless they removed from the country within a few days they would be killed. Other families received similar warnings, but paid no heed to them, and the result was that they were burned out, and some members murdered. The farm on which the Hawkes settled is now known as the Baxter Blythe Farm, and was largely cleared and improved by them. After selling his farm Robert Hawke moved to Stark County, same State, where he died, a member of the Presbyterian Church, and in politics a strong Democrat.\n\nRobert Hawke, father of the subject of this sketch, was born in County Donegal, Ireland, Aug. 25, 1805, and was consequently nine years old when he came with the rest of the family to America. His education was limited to but a few days at school, and to such study as he was enabled to apply himself to at home. On Jan. 18, 1848, he was married to Jane, daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth (Cute) Black, former a native of Ireland. Mr. and Mrs. Black came to America in 1814 from County Tyrone, Ireland, the voyage being made in the same ship that brought Grandfather Hawke and family, but they knew nothing of it until after the marriage of the father and mother in 1848. They settled in Philadelphia, Penn., and there remained until 1825, when they moved to Washington County, Penn., where they resided until 1831, in which year they moved to Monroe Township, Carroll County, Ohio, and here they died. Their children were as follows: James (born on the ocean), Elizabeth, Jane, Thomas, Robert, Isaac, and Eliza (now Mrs. David McCullah, of Uhrichsville). They were Presbyterians in religious faith, and politically Mr. Black was a Whig. Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hawke, after their marriage, settled on the property where their son R. T. now resides, and this by hard work they improved and made one of the most productive farms in the valley. The children born to them were as follows: Hannah R. (deceased); Elizabeth O., now Mrs. Oliver J. Strayer; John R., now of Pueblo, Colo.; R. T.; Elnora J., now Mrs. T. R, McElhany, and Alica Mary (deceased). The father died Jan. 9, 1871, the mother Jan. 24, 1881. They were leading members of the Presbyterian Church, and in his political preferments Mr. Hawke was an active Democrat.\n\nR. T. Hawke, whose name opens this sketch, from his youth up has passed his life on the old home place where he was born and where he yet resides. In consequence of there being sickness in the family, instead of going to school he remained at home, but, by steady application to books, and a keen observation of men and things in general, he succeeded in securing a good practical education. On Oct. 7, 1879, he was united in marriage with Jennie N. Hamilton, who was born near Waynesburg, Stark Co., Ohio, Aug. 20, 1860, daughter of R. B. Hamilton, and the result of this happy union is three children: Robert B., Paul G. and Florence. Mr. and Mrs. Hawke are members of the Presbyterian Church at Waynesburg, and in his political predilections Mr. Hawke, as were his forefathers, is a solid, uncompromising Democrat.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 971 BENJAMIN F. HAYES, one of the representative farmer citizens of Harrison Township, Carroll County, Penn., Nov. 25, 1825. His grandfather, Hayes, was a native of Ireland, where the ancestry had long lived, and here he married a village maiden. About the middle of the eighteenth century he came to American soil, settling in Maryland, where he pursued the same vocation (presumably that of farming) as had his ancestry in Ireland. His son, John E., father of Benjamin F., was born in Maryland, Jan. 22, 1770, and after attaining his majority, separated from the other members of the family and came west, marrying, however, before leaving his native State, Miss Mary Farver, a young lady of German descent. Soon after their marriage they located in Pennsylvania, where they remained till 1830, in which year they moved yet farther west, remaining a short time in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, whence they proceeded to Richland County, thence to Wayne, where the father died in 1841. The mother then returned to Tuscarawas County, where she passed from earth in the year 1846. They were the parents of the following named children: Nancy, John, Elizabeth, Sarah, Eachel, Ruth, Margaret, Mary, Hannah, Joseph and Benjamin F. John E. Hayes was a well-educated man, and during his residence in Pennsylvania, and also for some years while in Ohio, he taught school successfully; he also mastered the science of surveying, a profession he was engaged in many years. Politically he was a Democrat, and took a lively interest in the workings of his party.\n\nBenjamin F. Hayes was reared to agricultural pursuits on his father's farm, attending during the winter months the common schools of his district in his native county, and when he came of age he commenced life for his own account. On Apr. 5, 1850, he was married to Christiana E., daughter of Jacob Pontius, a native of Pennsylvania, born Feb. 27, 1801, where he was married to Elizabeth Shaffer, a resident of New Jersey, who bore him five children, viz.: Sarah, Christiana E., Henry, John and Ezra. Coming to Van Wert County, Mr. and Mrs. Pontius settled on a farm, and in 1854 returned to Montgomery, Ohio, and there died, he in 1876 and she in 1863, both members of the Presbyterian Church; in politics he was a Democrat of the most pronounced type. Abraham Pontius, father of Jacob, and also a native of Pennsylvania, was married in that State to Eve Stetler, and their children were Jacob, Lidda, Abraham, Elizabeth, Sarah and John and Daniel (twins). The family were residents of Washington County, Penn.; in religion they were Presbyterians and in politics Democrats.\n\nAfter marriage Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Hayes took up their residence in Willshire, Van Wert Co., Ohio, until 1874, when they purchased their present property in Harrison Township, Carroll County, their highly improved and well-stocked farm comprising 197 acres. The children born to them are named as follows: Elizabeth, Mrs. Ira Baxter; Jacob and Arminda J., deceased; and John B., at home. In politics Mr. Hayes was a stanch Republican until a few years ago, since when he has given his aid and influence to the Prohibition party. He is recognized as a man of excellent judgment, possessed of thorough business qualifications, and has made his own success in life.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 1035 THOMAS HAYS, one of the leading attorneys of Carrollton, Carroll Co., Ohio, was born May 25, 1834, in Franklin Township, Columbiana Co., Ohio. He is of Scotch-Irish descent, his ancestors having emigrated from Scotland to Ireland during the reign of James I of England and IV of Scotland. The name was originally Hay, but when the family became quite numerous they were spoken of as the \"Hays,\" and about A. D. 1750 a part of the family adopted the name of Hays, and have written it that way ever since. His parents, James and Mary (McKernan) Hays, were natives of County Tyrone, Ireland, where they, in 1818, were married. In 1819 they immigrated to America, and after a stay of about three years in Beaver County, Penn., they moved to Columbiana County, Ohio, where they took up Government land, and were among the earliest of the pioneers, the woods abounding at that time with wild animals, including all kinds of game. Here they ended their days, their deaths occurring in 1846 and 1877, respectively. They had eight children - five sons and three daughters the eldest of whom, William H. (now deceased), was born in County Tyrone, Ireland; six of this family are yet living.\n\nThomas Hays, whose name appears at the opening of this sketch is the sixth in his father's family in the order of birth, and first saw light in an old log cabin on the original homestead in Columbiana County, as above related. His early life was spent with his parents, assisting them in the duties of the farm, and attending the early district schools. When about eighteen years of age he commenced teaching in the district schools of the neighborhood, a profession he followed at various times for some ten winters, and the earnings so made he devoted to pay the expense of his studies at the New Lisbon High School, which he attended three years, supplementing same with a short course of study at Mount Union College. While engaged in teaching he read law, and under the able tuition of Judge John Clarke, of New Lisbon, he advanced rapidly till in June, 1862, he was qualified to pass a most creditable examination before one of the supreme judges, and was admitted to the bar with the privilege of practicing before all the courts of the State of Ohio. In 1867 he was admitted at Cleveland to practice before the United States District Court. In May, 1863, Mr. Hays came to Carrollton, and here established himself in the practice of his chosen profession. Politically he is a Democrat, and for two years was mayor of Carrollton; also for three years served as a member of the board of education. In 1863 he married, in Columbiana County, Miss Martha J. Williams, a descendant of a pioneer family of that county, and four children have blessed them, viz.: Mary J., Joseph F., Adda C. and William J. Mr. and Mrs. Hays are members of that county, and four children have blessed them, viz.: Mary J., Joseph F., Adda C. and William J. Mr. and Mrs. Hays are members of the Presbyterian Church, and she is prominent in woman's work in connection therewith. He is the architect of his own success, and the family enjoy the respect and esteem of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 774\n\nJ. Helfrich\n\nNOTE: Not sure if Jacob or John W. Helfrich ~ sw~ JACOB HELFRICH. Like a giant tree in a forest of weather-worn oaks, the name we have just written stands prominent on the roll of those noble pioneers whose lives were passed in bringing Carroll to its present enviable position in the magnificent galaxy of Ohio's counties. He was born in Germany Mar. 17, 1818, one of a family of eleven children, the record of the remaining ten being as follows: Twin boys died in infancy; Peter, a farmer, and Philip, a blacksmith, died in Crawford County, Ohio; Nicholas died at Fort Wayne, Ind.; Wendall and Andrew both died\n\nin Germany; Henry and Michael live in Crawford County, Ohio; Margaret died in Germany.\n\nJacob Helfrich, when eighteen years of age, his father having provided him with money sufficient to bring him to America, set sail in company with several other emigrants in April, 1837, and after a long voyage of 105 days landed at Baltimore, Md. Some dozen of these emigrants, including our subject, all young men, walked to Wheeling, W. Va. (their baggage going by wagon), where he worked three mouths at his trade; thence went by river to Steubenville, Ohio, from which place he came by stage to Carrollton, there being at the time (1837) but a few hundred inhabitants in the place. Farther than this the stage was unable to proceed on account of the mud, so Mr. Helfrich remained in Carrollton, a stranger in a strange land, and immediately commenced working at his trade, that of shoemaker, at which he had served an apprenticeship in Germany. Two of his brothers had preceded him to Ohio, settling in Crawford County, and Mr. Helfrich, being desirous of once more seeing them, walked all the way to their place and back. Their father, Nicholas Helfrich, who had been a public officer in Germany during the greater part of his life, died there in 1840, and the widowed mother afterward came to Ohio, where she died in 1850 at the home of her sons, in Crawford County.\n\nIn about two years after Jacob Helfrich's settlement in Carrollton he opened out a shoe business for his own account, which he has since continued in, from time to time enlarging his premises and stock as his trade expanded, and in 1855 he moved to his present place. On Apr. 15, 1841, he was married to Catharine Stemple, daughter of Jacob Stemple, of Carroll County, and their union was blessed with nine children, of whom the following is a brief record: Margaret is the widow of Charles Cronenwett, formerly residing in Sandusky County, Ohio, now of Carrollton, Ohio; Eva C. is the wife of Rev. E. Cronenwett, of Butler, Penn.; Susanna is the widow of Rev. F. E. Harsh, and lives in Carrollton, Ohio; Barbara, is married to Dr. C. R. Ziegler, of Carrollton; Jacob M. is deceased; Mary E. is the wife of J. Henry Troutman, of Butler, Penn.; John W. is more fully spoken of farther on; Sarah D. is the wife of J. L. Frederick, of Greenville, Penn.; Albert is deceased. In politics Mr. Helfrich was first a Whig, afterward a Republican, but of late years he has supported the Democratic party. For six years he was a justice of the peace, and in all things tending to the advancement and prosperity of his town and county he has ever been found in the front ranks, not the least among the progressive movements in which he took prominent part being the Carrollton & Oneida Railroad. In 1859 the Carrollton & Oneida Railroad (now Carrollton Branch of the C. C. & S. Railroad) was sold to a company composed of John Ebersole, Henry A. Stidger, James Huston, James P. Cummings, Jacob Helfrich and James Cameron. The road at this time was broken down by heavy engines, and had deteriorated year by year through lack of necessary repairs. The new company soon had the road repaired and in running order. They rigged up a passenger car and a couple of flats (\"gondolas\") with couplings, purchased motive power in the shape of stout horses, and turned the much-vaunted Carroll County railroad into a horse-ear line under the new name of the \"Carrollton & Oneida Railroad.\" On June 9, 1866, the stockholders of the road met for the election of directors, Jacob Helfrich being elected one of them, and general ticket agent. The work of rebuilding and fitting up the road was pushed to completion, and on Sept. 11, 1807, a steam engine arrived for the road, and was a profitable investment for the company; in 1873 the road bed was donated to parties who made a narrow gauge road. His connection ceased here.\n\nAt a reunion of the Helfrich family to be held at the homestead in Carrollton, on Apr. 15, 1891, there are expected to be present one son, six daughters, twenty-five grandchildren, one great-grandchild, four sons-in-law, and two daughters-in-law. There have passed to their long homes two sons and six grandchildren.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 836 JOHN W. HELFRICH, son of Jacob Helfrich, one of the best known and most highly respected citizens of Carrollton, was born Jan. 17, 1855, in Carrollton, Carroll Co., Ohio. He was educated at the common and first ward schools of his native town, and first learned the trade of shoemaker, at which he worked three years. At the age of sixteen he commenced an apprenticeship in Carrollton to the watch and clock business, and in Cleveland he spent two years perfecting himself in the trade. In 1877 he located in Dell Roy, in Carroll County, where he remained a few months and then settled finally in Carrollton, where he opened out the best watch, clock and jewelry repair business in the county; and his superior skill in his line has brought him a well-merited patronage from both far and near. His connection with the Connotton Valley Railway as official jeweler of the road (a position he yet holds) since 1877 has increased his business very much. Since then he has furnished and kept in order all the depot clocks, the fine chronometer engine clocks, as well as the Howard tower clock at the Canton depot. When the Cleveland & Canton changed their gauge, everything in the clock line was thoroughly overhauled and placed in order, and all of the clocks are in as good condition as when placed thirteen years ago. He supplied the fine tower clock and bell for Carroll County court-house, also the one for the railroad depot at Canton, Ohio, and the signal service at Carrollton is managed by him.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 1887, Mr. Helfrich was married to Miss Hattie May Wert, of Sulphur Springs, Crawford Co., Ohio, a daughter of J. B. and Leonora (Ziegler) Wert, former of whom is a merchant at Sulphur Springs. One year ago Mr. and Mrs. Helfrich went to Cleveland, Ohio, where they studied for and both graduated as opticians at Dr. Julius King's establishment. They then returned to Carrollton, where they have since followed that branch of the business in connection with his regular watch and jewelry business. One child, named John Wert, has been born to our subject and wife. In his political preferments Mr. Helfrich' is a Democrat, but is no partisan, and bas invariably declined nomination to office, as his business demands all his time and attention.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J. H. Beers & Co. - 1891 - Page 839 RICHARD HEMMING, one of the oldest and most respected residents of Harrison Township, Carroll County, was born in Washington County, Penn., Mar. 18, 1823. William Hemming, his grandfather, was a native of England, and came to America at a very early day, settling in Maryland, where he was married to Sisson Stephens, who bore him the following named children: Thomas, Mary, Richard, George, Henry, Samuel, Nancy, Sally, Amos and Anna. In 1795 William Memming removed with his family to Washington County, Penn., where he carried on farming until 1830, in which year he came to what in a few years afterward became Harrison Township, Carroll Co., Ohio. He had been all his life a Democrat, a zealous worker in his party.\n\nRichard Hemming, father of the subject of this sketch, was born near the city of Baltimore, Md., in 1787, and was nine years old when his parents moved to Washington County, Penn., where he attended school and also learned the practical lessons of farm life. He was there married to Eleanor Leggett, and in 1830 they came to Ohio, purchasing the farm whereon their son Richard is at present living, most of the improvements on which they made themselves, with the assistance of their children. They had born to them the following named children: Mary, William, Eleanor, Richard and Jesse. The father died Mar. 23, 1859, the mother Feb. 25, 1849, and they both lie buried at Carrollton, in Carroll County; they were leading members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and in politics he was a Democrat.\n\nRichard Hemming, whose name opens this sketch, was seven years old when his parents brought him to Ohio, and his education was obtained in the subscription and common schools of the neighborhood, thorough practical farming being, however, the chief training of his boyhood and youth. On Mar. 4, 1844, be was united in marriage with Lydia, daughter of Elias and Sarah Harsh, and she bore him children named as follows: George W., Sarah E., Elias R, Enoch N., Abrabam H., Daniel W., Mary C, Clara M. and Julia A. The entire family are members of the Lutheran Church, and in politics Mr. Hemming is a Democrat.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J.

Among the business men of Sherrodsville, in Carroll County, who have been identified with every progressive movement for the developing and building up of the village, none, probably, has been more active in the work than Mr. Herbert. His father was a native of Wales, whence, when he was eighteen years old, he came to America alone, his capital consisting of willing hands and a stout heart. He first began working in the mines in Luzerne County, Penn., occupying his leisure time in acquiring an education. In early manhood he was united in marriage with Catherine Jones, a native of Wales, and their children were as follows: Jane, John, Albert, Evan, Edward, William, Ellen, Mary A., Emma and Lewis. The father departed this life in 1867, the mother having preceded him to the grave two years previously. Mr. Herbert was a stanch supporter of the Republican party, and as soon as he had made himself conversant with the various phases of politics he became of considerable assistance in disseminating the doctrine of Republicanism among his fellow miners, by whom he was much respected. He was a consistent and useful member of the Congregational Church.\n\nAlbert Herbert, whose name heads this sketch, was engaged in the mines of Luzerne County, Penn., occupying various positions until he became \"boss\" of a mine, in which capacity he served with ability and satisfaction to both employer and employes. Here he remained until 1880, when he went to Colorado, remaining one year; then came to Sherrodsville, where for a time he was engaged in mining, after which he opened the grocery and provision store, which he at present carries on. In 1883 he was married to Miss Frank (born in Carroll ton, Ohio), daughter of Charles and Jennie (Rue) Hardesty, of Centre Township, Carroll County, and one child was born to them, which lived but a short time. Mr. Herbert is emphatically a self-made man, and enjoys the confidence and esteem of a wide circle of friends. He and his family are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and in politics he is a stanch Republican.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J.

His grandfather, John Hunter, was born in Ireland, as was also his grandmother. After coming to this country John Hunter, Sr., followed butchering as an occupation. Both he and his good wife died in Maryland. John T. Hunter, father of our subject was born in Maryland, but at the age of four years was taken by his father to Washington County, Penn., where he grew to manhood. At an early age he came west and located in Fox Township, Carroll Co., Ohio, where he married. He then returned to Pennsylvania, his old home, where he remained about five years, after which he came back to Fox township and settled on a farm. Mr. Hunter was an intelligent, thinking man; he taught school, and was looked upon as a man of more than ordinary information and learning. Mr. Hunter was a strong Democrat, in the earlier part of his life being anti-slavery in sentiment, holding the opinion that the North had nothing to do with slavery, until President Van Buren publicly announced that he would veto any bill passed by Congress abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia; Mr. Hunter then came out a full-fledged Abolitionist, and so remained to the end of his life. He died in 1851, and his widow in 1880.\n\nRobert G. Hunter was born Oct. 7, 1832, in Washington County, Penn. His father moved to the West when Robert G. was but a child, and here father and son cleared away the forest, made improvements, converted the woodland into blossoming fields, and thus helped to advance civilization in the West. The younger Hunter was allowed the usual among of education, which, was the case with other boys, was obtained by attending the district school in winter time. Summer was the time to work, to clear the fields, plant the crops, and to prepare for the coming winter. Robert G. Hunter was married Sept. 14, 1883, to Miss Malinda Roudebush, who was reared in Carroll County, and three children came to brighten their home, viz.: Abraham L., Elizabeth Ann and Chrissie G. Mr. Hunter is a member of the United Presbyterian Church, and is a Republican in sentiment, though no politician. He has a finely improved farm equipped with modern improvements, and his success is due to his energy, good management and honest living. Mr. and Mrs. Hunter have a wide circle of friends, who value honest, upright neighbors.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Records of the counties of Harrison and Carroll, Ohio - Illustrated - Published: Chicago - J.
