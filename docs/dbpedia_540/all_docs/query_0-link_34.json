        "text": "I apprecite your adding my info to your information on Sabina Ritter. There is still alot of confusion surrounding her and it seems that most would rather just copy incorrect information from someone else's site than to do the research themselves. :P I really appreciate your efforts to provide correct information to the public. With that in mind, I wanted to let you know a few more things that I have discovered about my ggggrandmother. :) But first, I must tell you that you need to delete Lovina from this grouping. Lovina is Sabina. Sabina's full name was Louisa Sabina Ritter. This is where alot of confusion comes in since her name was transcribed as Lovina in certain records. People also confuse her with Adalina but they are definitely two distinct and different people. Sabina is buried in Allentown New Cemetery in the same lot (#147) as Levi Stuber and Polly Stuber, his mother. Louisa is listed in the 1850 census with Daniel and Abbey. Her age is listed as 4. From Allentown New Cemetery records, her tombstone reads:\n\n\" Sabina Lowisa, wife of James B Stuber, daughter of Daniel and Abigail Ritter, b. Dec 7, 1865, d. Feb 7, 1870.\n\nGeorge U., son of James B and Sabina L Stuber, b. Sept 19, 1868, d. Oct 29, 1868, aged 1 mo, 10 days. \"\n\nPhotos confirm the inscription.\n\nBoth of these inscriptions are on the same stone, indicating that both are buried in the same grave.So in addition to the two girls, Sabina and James also had a little boy. Now you have a bit of info that no one else has because they haven't done their research! No one else seems to know about poor little George.\n\nAnd last but not least, let me give you my sources so you can see that I am not a fly-by-night genealogist wannabe. :)\n\nI got my info from Allentown New Cemetery records and burial permits, the 1850 North Whitehall Township census, the US Federal Census Mortality Schedules Index for 1870, and James Stubers' Civil War pension file.\n\nThanks again for your attention to detail. There are so many people out there who refuse to change their incorrect information even after I send them the correct information along with my sources. It is driving me nuts! Thanks again and take care.\n\nAutumn (Willenbecher) Grimaldo"
