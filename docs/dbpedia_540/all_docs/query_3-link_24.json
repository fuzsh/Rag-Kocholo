        "text": "Gregory John Helfrich of Yucaipa, passed away at home at the age of 66 on Saturday, September 3, 2022. He suffered a long battle with peripheral artery disease.\n\nGregory was born on February 1, 1956, in La Crosse, Wisconsin to Gerald and Helen Helfrich. The family moved to Redlands, California in 1963 where he grew up and learned his father’s trade of custom cabinet builder and finishing carpenter. He was employed in the family business, Inland Milling and Cabinets, for many years. He expanded his craft working on commercial renovations and restorations when he lived in Los Angeles. Later he moved to the Gardnerville-Tahoe area and specialized in home remodels. He returned to Yucaipa in 2012 to be with family again.\n\nHis hobby was his craft. He enjoyed helping family and friends with repairs and remodels. There is a part of his craft, a memory, in each of our homes.\n\nGregory was preceded in death by his father, his mother, and a sister, Zada Burkeybile. He is survived by his daughter, Michelle Helfrich, a step daughter, a step son, 2 grandchildren, and two sisters, Jackie Harris and Ramona Cunningham.\n\nThere will be a Celebration of Life on Saturday, September 24, 2022 at the home of Jackie Harris 34217 Pinehurst Dr. Yucaipa, CA 92399 from 11:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m."
