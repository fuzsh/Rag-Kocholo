        "text": "CHAPTER VI\n\nHOMOPATHY IN PENNSYLVANIA.\n\nBy Thomas Lindsley Bradford, M. D.\n\nIntroductory Remarks - Primacy of Pennsylvania in Homopathic Institutions - Homopathic Medical Society of Pennsylvania - Other Staie and Local Societies - Allentown Academy - Recollections of Early Practitioners - Detwiller, the Prescriber - Wesselhoeft and Freytag, the Founders - Becker and Helfrich, the Preacher Physicians - Ihm, the Pioneer in Philadelphia - Hering, the Prover, Philosopher, Scientist and Founder - Brief Allusion to other Early Practitioners - Lists of Pioneer Physicians - Homopathic Dispensaries.\n\nHomopathy gained a foothold in Pennsylvania in much the same manner as the system was planted in New York, and within three years after Gram left the New England coast and settled permanently in the great metropolis of America. As was Gram to homopathy in New York, so was Detwiller to the new system in Pennsylvania, yet in the latter commonwealth greater prominence seems to have been given to the introduction of Hahnemann's doctrine than in the former ; and in Pennsylvania all chroniclers of contemporary history have dated its advent to the day when Detwiller administered the first homopathic dose. And unlike Gram in New York, Detwiller in Pennsylvania from the time he began to investigate homopathy was encouraged by the sympathy and assistance of zealous co-workers, Wesselhoeft and Freytag, and soon afterward by acquisitions from abroad and the converts they made among the German settlers in the locality in which the scene of their early experiences was laid.\n\nAlthough the Hahnemannian doctrine was first planted in New York and afterward in Pennsylvania, the latter in some respects holds primacy in the establishment of institutions and the natural development of the homopathic system. Indeed, there seems to have been less opposition to contend against and overcome in the Keystone state than in New York, which may in part be accounted for in the fact that in Pennsylvania homopathy first found lodgment in a part of the state remote from its metropolis, and the practitioners had gained a strong foothold with the people when Ihm set himself up as a practitioner of the new school in the city of Philadelphia. Again, in less than eight years after Detwiller and Wesselhoeft had made their first practical demonstrations of homopathy the number of converts had so increased that a medical society was formed, and just a little later these same determined pioneers had the courage to go beyond society organization and found a school of homopathic medical instruction. The so-called Allentown Academy was the result of their enterprise, and while that institution was destined to a brief existence it always has figured in history as the first institution of its kind in the world ; and after it had passed out of being some of its best elements were utilized in founding the Homopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania, which was organized in Philadelphia in 1848. The two schools were quite unlike in many respects, vet the experiences of the first endeavor were of great value in laying the foundation of the latter institution.\n\nTHE HOMOPATHIC MEDICAL SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA.\n\nThe Homopathic Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, while not the first organization of its character in the state, is nevertheless of first importance and is regarded as the conservator of the peace and dignity of the homopathic profession and its other societies the extent of whose authority and jurisdiction is less than that of the mother organization. The State Society, as commonly known, was organized at a convention of physicians held June 5, 1866, in the Homopathic Hospital of Pittsburgh in pursuance of a call emanating from the Allegheny County Homopathic Medical Society. This informal meeting was called to order by Dr. J. C. Burgher of Pittsburgh, who stated briefly the object of assembling the homopathic physicians of the state. Dr. J. P. H. Frost was chosen chairman and Dr. Bushrod W. James secretary pro tem. An informal organization was then perfected and a committee of one from each county was appointed to prepare a constitution and by-laws for the government of the society's affairs. These preliminaries being settled the convention proceeded to perfect a permanent organization by electing officers for the ensuing year, as follows : Dr. J. B. Wood of West Chester, president ; Drs. J. H. P. Frost of Philadelphia and J. C. Burgher of Pittsburgh, vice-presidents ; Bushrod W. James of Philadelphia, recording secretary ; Robert J. McClatchey of Philadelphia, corresponding secretary ; David Cowley of Pittsburgh, treasurer ; Coates Preston of West Chester, Robert Faulkner of Erie, and H. H. Hoffman of Pittsburgh, censors.\n\nThus permanently organized and officered the society began its active career and history, and during the period of its existence in all later years it has been instrumental in promoting and safeguarding the interests of the homopathic profession in the Keystone state, and through its members has exercised an influence for good in directing the affairs of that greater body, the American Institute of Homopathy. There were thirty original members of the society, all of whom were subscribers to the constitution. In the course of the next year the membership increased to seventy-one, and in the third year to ninety-eight. In 1903 the society numbered three hundred and fifty-eight members, which represented about one-half the strength of the profession in the state.\n\nThe policy of the society ever has been to hold its annual meetings in different cities. Previous to 1873 these meetings were held in May or June, and since then in September or October ; now they are held in the former month. Transactions have been published since the society was first organized. The first six volumes were issued in paper covers and later ones insubstantial cloth binding. In 1889 the society published a repertory to Hering's \"Condensed Materia Medica.\" Several important annual addresses by presidents of the society also have been published.\n\nThe Hahnemannian Society was the pioneer organization of homopathy in Pennsylvania and indeed in the entire country, and dates its history to April 10, 1833, when Drs. Ihm, Bute, Matlack, Hering and Wesselhoeft, with a few laymen, associated themselves for the purpose of disseminating among the people some knowledge of the history and doctrines of homopathy, and its advantages over other methods of medical treatment. In pursuance of this design Dr. Hering prepared an interesting address, an English version of which, furnished by Dr. Matlack, was read before the society April 18, 1833, and was afterward published under the title of \"A Concise View of the Rise and Progress of Homopathic Medicine.\" This address and notices of it by the press were the means of promoting to a considerable extent the design contemplated by its publication. The society having issued this brochure, and having addressed a letter to Hahnemann, informing him of its formation on the anniversary of his birth, and bearing his name, was succeeded by another society, from membership in which laymen were excluded, and which was known as the Homopathic Medical Society of Philadelphia, organized in 1838, with a membership of physicians only. This was the first regularly constituted homopathic society in the city of \"Brotherly Love.\"\n\nAnother notable organization of Hahnemann's disciples of which chroniclers of homopathic history in Pennsylvania have given little account was that known as the Homopathic Society of Northampton and Counties Adjacent, which was formed soon after the Hahnemannian Society, and of which Detwiller many years ago gave this description : \"In 1834, 23d of August, the Homopathic Society of Northampton and Adjoining Counties was formed by Drs. Wesselhoeft, Freytag, Romig, myself and Rev. Christian J. Becker, D. D. The object of the association was the advancement of homopathy amongst its members -by interchange of experience and reciprocal encouragement to persevere in the study and spread of the doctrine and practice of similia similibus curantur.\" The meeting at which the society was organized was attended by several notable characters in early homopathic history in Pennsylvania. They were Wesselhoeft, Freytag, Romig, Detwiller, Becker, the minister, Joseph H. Pulte, afterward founder of a homopathic medical college in Cincinnati, Ohio, J. C. Gosewich, assistant to Wesselhoeft, Rev. R. Wohlfrath, Gustav Reichhelm the pioneer homopath west of the Allegheny mountains, Rev. John Helfrich and Rev. Mr. Waage. The first officers of the society were E. Freytag, president ; William Wesselhoeft, vice-president ; Rev. C. Becker, recording secretary ; Henry Detwiller, corresponding secretary and librarian.\n\nFor more than half a century Pennsylvania has been the home of many important medical societies and associations, some of them district organizations and others of a purely local character. The older of these are the Allegheny County Medical Society, organized November 25, 1864, and still existing ; Allegheny County Anatomical Society, organized October 19, 1864, incorporated December 4, 1865 ; Allegheny County Materia Medica Club, May 3, 1875 ; American Provers' Union, organized at Philadelphia, August 15, 1853 ; Beaver County Homopathic Medical Society, January 8, 1883 ; Berks and Schuylkill Counties Homopathic Medical Society, November 9, 1869 ; Bnninghausen Club of Philadelphia, November, 1867 ; Chester County Homopathic Medical Society, September 5, 1858 ; Chester Organon Club, 1887 ; Crawford County Homopathic Medical Society, July 28, 1882 ; Cumberland Valley Homopathic Medical Society, May 8, 1866 ; Dauphin County Homopathic Medical Society, 1866 ; Erie County Homopathic Medical Society, July 1, 1891 ; Farrington Materia Medica Club of Allegheny County, 1888 ; Germantown Homopathic Medical Society, October, 1879 ; Germantown Homopathic Medical Club, about 1889 ; Hahnemannian Association of Pennsylvania, organized in Philadelphia, October 11, 1887 ; Hahnemann Club of Philadelphia, January, 1874 ; Hahnemannian Society, organized at Philadelphia, April 10, 1833, the first homopathic society in America ; Hahnemann Medical Society of Reading, November 23, 1882 ; Hahnemann Medical Institute, a students' society organized 1849-1850 ; Hering Club of Philadelphia, December 20, 1880 ; Homopathic Medical Council of Pennsylvania, November 24, 1880 ; Lehigh Valley Homopathic Medical Society, March 24, 1881 ; Lippe Society of Philadelphia, January 5, 1880 ; Luzerne County Homopathic Medical Society, 1868 ; Northeastern Philadelphia Society of Homopathic Physicians, February 9, 1883 ; Northwestern Pennsylvania Homopathic Medical Society, July 5, 1866 ; Northwestern Pennsylvania Homopathic Medical Society, January 13, 1874 ; Northern Pennsylvania Homopathic Medical Society, June 20, 1882 ; Northampton and Adjacent Counties Homopathic Medical Society, organized August 23, 1834 ; Organon and Materia Medica Society, November 6, 1888 : Pennsylvania Homopathic Pharmaceutical Association, April 9, 1881, incorporated October 3, 1881 ; Philadelphia Branch of the American Institute of Homopathy, organized at Philadelphia.

It may be said, however, that the events narrated in this chapter relate to elements of history which are not specially treated in the college article, hence the double mention must not be regarded as a duplication of subject matter.\n\nPhoto : Allentown Academy.\n\nThe so-called Allentown Academy had its inception in the Homopathic Society of Northampton and Counties Adjacent, to which reference has been made, and also, although in a less degree, to that pioneer organization of Homopathy in this state known as the Hahnemannian Association. The establishment of this society, the circulation of Hering's pamphlet, and the other efforts of the friends of homopathy at an early day excited considerable interest not only among the clergy and other laymen but among physicians, and many of the latter were disposed to investigate the new doctrine ; but it was, soon found that there was need of some method by which the principles of homopathy could be taught. Hering's plan was to devise a course of lectures on the subject, and to encourage students of medicine to learn the German language in order to understand and appreciate the value of the founder's teachings. At the same time the members of the Northampton society felt the need of a school for the teaching of homopathy, and in writing on the subject Detwiller said that as early as December 30, 1833, Wesselhoeft, Romig and himself waited on Hering in Philadelphia and adopted a plan which ultimately resulted in the establishment of the academy. The plans were matured on Hering's birthday, January 1, 1834, and provided for an academy to be located in Allentown, with Hering as president and principal instructor, for which purpose he was to remove to that place from Philadelphia \"as soon as they would guarantee him a salary equal to that of a first class Allentown clergyman.\"\n\nThe plans of the founders contemplated the procuring of a charter from the legislature through the influence of the homopaths in Northampton and Lehigh counties, which being accomplished, Wesselhoeft proposed to invite there medical students who attended the allopathic colleges for instruction during the summer months, there being no summer courses at that time, and that they should have the benefit of lectures devoted to the science and application of pure homopathy Such a thing as opposition from any source was not thought of, as there was to be no interference with the regular courses in other schools, but such violent opposition and bitterness of feeling as was soon aroused was as surprising as it was unwarranted.\n\nThe commendable purpose of the founders was to devote considerable time during the winter months to the preparation of text works with which to promulgate the doctrines of homopathy ; also to pledge all students to continue their courses in other schools, except those who came for the express purpose of perfecting themselves in homopathy alone. All books previously published on the subject of homopathy were to be translated into English.\n\nAnother original purpose of the founders was to organize a stock company for the purchase of land and the erection of an academy building. For this object about one hundred subscribers from Allentown, Bethlehem, Philadelphia and New York did create a fund sufficient to purchase a tract of land comprising one entire square in the very center of Allentown. The greater part of this fund was in fact raised in Philadelphia through the efforts of William Geisse, who is said to have been the real pioneer of homopathy in that city.\n\nAccording to the original plans, which as a matter of fact were not fully carried out, the academy building was to comprise a main structure with two wings, each forty by sixty feet in size, three stories high, and of brick construction, and another two story building for use as a chemical laboratory and also for anatomical and dissecting purposes ; for these old patriarchs of homopathy had in mind the establishment of a college curriculum which included both didactic and clinical teaching, and furnished instruction in surgery as well as medicine. But the elaborate plans of the founders never were consummated ; discouragements and obstacles arose before them and confused their operations to a considerable extent. They did, however, succeed in opening the academy and carried forward its work for several years, though with not better than indifferent results so far as medical education was concerned and at some loss from a financial standpoint. The principal mistake was in giving medical instruction in German in an English speaking country and rather than educate themselves in German the American students were inclined to enter other schools and thus quite naturally adopted some other system of medicine, than homopathy.\n\nTo receive an Allentown diploma was a medical distinction. The professsors were graduates of German universities and subjected the candidate to the same rigorous examination as they had received. Many who sought to pass were rejected.\n\nSeveral important books were issued under the auspices of the Allentown Academy. \"Einige Wort ueber Nothwendigkeit\" the address at the dedication of the academy ; the \"Homopathic Domestic Physician,\" by Hering, 1835-38, and Hahnemann's Organon, a reprint of the Stratton edition. This was published at the \"Academical Bookstore,\" 1836, and contains a preface by Hering ; the \"Correspondenzblatt,\" 1835-37 ; \"Wirkungen des Schlangengiftes\" (Effects of Snake Poisons), by Hexing, Allentown, 1837.\n\nSo much of the early history of Allentown Academy as is here narrated will suffice for the purposes of this chapter, which is devoted more particularly to the history of homopathy in Pennsylvania than that of its schools of medical instruction. Again, the academy history is made the subject of sufficient mention in the chapter which relates especially to the Homopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania and its successor, Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital of Philadelphia, the former of which was in a way the indirect outgrowth of the older institution at Allentown, although not immediately a part of it. It is proper to state, however, that this first school of homopathic medical instruction in the world was founded in 1835, and that its cornerstone was laid with due ceremony on May 27 of that year, the contents of the box being as follows : Hahnemann's Organon and picture ; the constitution of the academy corporation, printed in German and English ; names of members of the academy household and the incorporators ; Hering's address ; Philadelphia newspapers containing an account of homopathy in Ohio ; a copy of \"Freidensbote ;\" quantity of homopathic medicine, names of state and city officers ; programme of the celebration.\n\nAt a meeting of the founders and incorporators held on the same day these officers were elected : Constantine Hering, president ; John Romig, vice-president ; Adolphus Bauer, secretary ; Solomon Keck, treasurer ; William Wesselhoeft, Eberhard Freytag, Henry Detwiller, Rev. Christian Becker, John Rice, C. Pretz, Joseph Sacger and George Keck, directors ; William Eckert, Rev. Philip H. Goep, Henry Ebner and J. V. R. Hunter, trustees.\n\nOn June 17, 1836, the legislature granted a charter to the North American Academy of the Homopathic Healing Art, and the institution then incorporated by law entered upon its interesting and eventful career. The incorporators completed the organization of their body, and adopted a constitution which in its declarations showed the beneficent objects of its founders. The second article reads as follows : \"The Academy shall consider every member of a Homopathic Society in the United States as a member of its own body, and shall grant to all equal privileges in the use of what has been accomplished by means of its enterprise, according to conditions hereafter mentioned, without demanding therefor, generally, a stipulated contribution.\"\n\nThe constitution also provided for a thorough course of study, medical and otherwise, as will be seen by the following extract from one of the articles : \"The Literary institution according to the express design of its foundation shall be as comprehensive in its operations as possible, and will embrace the following branches of study as indispensable to the complete education of the physician, viz. : clinical instruction, examination of the sick, and semeiotics ; pharmacodynamics and materia medica ; pharmaceutics and medical botany ; dietetics ; special therapeutics, surgery and obstetrics ; medical jurisprudence ; general therapeutics ; symptomatology and human pathology ; physiology and anatomy ; comparative physiology and comparative anatomy ; zoology, phytology and mineralogy ; chemistry, physics, geology, astronomy and mathematics ; history of medicine and natural sciences ; the Greek, Latin and German languages as preparatory studies.\"\n\nThis curriculum was broad enough for the most advanced medical schools of the day in which the founders wrought, and theirs was hardly more than an experimental institution. Indeed the prescribed course would do justice to many modern colleges. Those old founders built better than they knew, and had the English language been spoken by the faculty as freely as twenty years later the academy undoubtedly would have endured to the present time. However, its downfall has been attributed, in part at least, to other causes than the mere fact of having been a school in which German only was spoken.\n\nHOMOPATHIC HOSPITALS OF PENNSYLVANIA.\n\nThe Homopathic Hospital for the Insane at Allentown. In 1876 an effort was made to secure a homopathic hospital for the insane in this state, but the attempt was not well organized hence nothing came of it ; nor of a similar movement in 1888, although considerable interest was then awakened in legislative circles and also generally in the medical profession. However, another twelve years passed before any well organized effort was inaugurated in the direction of such an institution, and then the initial steps were taken by the Germantown Homopathic Medical Society of Philadelphia, an organization of about two hundred influential homopathic physicians of that city, who fathered the movement, raised the necessary preliminary funds, and aroused public interest in favor of the enterprise to such extent that the legislature in 1901 appropriated $300,000 for the purchase of lands and the erection of hospital buildings, but the governor cut the appropriation to $50,000, pleading in justification of his action economy in public expenditures.\n\nPhoto : Main Group of Buildings of the Pennsylvania Homopathic State Hospital for the Insane, East Allentown, Pa.\n\nThe commission appointed under the act to select a, site, purchase grounds and erect the buildings comprised Dr. William P. Snyder of Chester county, William F. Marshall and Dr. Louis H. Willard of Allegheny county, W. R. Stroh of Carbon county, and Dr. Isaac W. Heysinger of Philadelphia, the latter the representative of the homopathic profession and chairman of the executive committee of the Germantown medical society which had taken such earnest interest in the enterprise from the beginning.\n\nIn 1903 the legislature appropriated $300,000 (reduced to $250.000 by the executive) for the erection of hospital buildings at East Allentown on lands purchased by the state for that purpose, and on June 27, 1904, the cornerstone of the main structure was laid with formal ceremonies, the governor being present and taking part in the exercises.\n\nThe Cholera Hospital of Philadelphia was the first public charity of the homopathic school of medicine in this country, and was established by the authorities of that city during the cholera epidemic of 1832. It was located in a building on Cherry street, and was placed in charge of Dr. George Bute, one of the homopathic pioneers of the city and state. The hospital was established for a temporary purpose and when the period of the epidemic had passed the institution was closed.\n\nThe Homopathic Hospital of Philadelphia was chartered April 20, 1850. For its purposes a building at the southeast corner of Chestnut and Twenty-fourth streets was rented, a hospital staff was organized, and in 1852 the institution was opened for the reception of patients. This was the second institution of the kind in America. Indeed, it may be regarded as the first regularly organized homopathic hospital in this country. It was continued only two years.\n\nThe Homopathic Hospital of Philadelphia for sick and wounded soldiers was the outgrowth of a meeting of patriotic women held September 9, 1862, at the Homopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania for the purpose of organizing a soldier's hospital. The board of managers of the college fitted up a building for the reception of patients, with the hope that the war department would allow such soldiers as preferred homopathic treatment to become its temporary inmates. This, however, was refused, and only disabled soldiers who had been discharged were received there. Several reports were published by the managers, and the institution during its existence was the means of much good for the public welfare.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Homopathic Hospital for Children was established largely through the efforts of a number of charitable persons of both sexes who appreciated the advantages of homopathic treatment of children, and who conceived the idea of an institution especially for them. A building in West Philadelphia was secured and fitted up for the purpose, and was opened April 24 ; 1877 ; a board of managers was created, of which Mrs. William H. Furness was president and Miss H. W. Hinckley secretary. The hospital staff comprised Dr. W. C. Goodno, attending surgeon ; Dr. C. B. Knerr, attending physician ; Dr. C. R. Norton, resident physician ; Drs. Hering, Lippe, Raue, H. N. Guernsey and Thomas Moore, consultants ; Dr. C. M. Thomas, surgeon. In 1880 a gift of $15,000 from the estate of William Weld enabled the association to purchase the hospital property, and the institution was chartered June 19 of that year. The hospital occupied one-fourth of a city square, furnished accommodations for twenty-five patients, and was provided with a dispensary department. It was continued until after the death of Mrs. Furness, who had been its chief supporter, when (January 1886) the hospital was merged in the 'Hahnemann Hospital of Philadelphia.' In the latter a ward was established in honor of Mrs. Horace Howard Furness and Mrs. William H. Furness, which became known as the Mrs. Furness ward.\n\nThe Children's Homopathic Hospital of Philadelphia is one of the most completely appointed institutions of its kind in the world, and is known from one end of the country to the other. It was founded as a public charity, the result of an incident which was not uncommon to life in a great city, but in its immediate foundation was the result of the action of members of the Hahnemann Club and their determination to establish an institution in which Sick and injured children could receive proper care and attention. To this end a meeting of friends of the enterprise was held at the house of Dr. Bushrod W. James on January 16, 1877, and at that time a temporary organization was effected. On March 5 following the institution was incorporated, a charter was secured, and on April 14 a permanent organization was effected in the election of a board of directors and officers, as follows : Henry C. Carey, president ; Enoch Turley, vice-president ; William N. Shoemaker, treasurer ; Thomas M. Montgomery, secretary.\n\nIn connection with the immediate management of the hospital a board of lady managers was formed, with these officers : Mrs. Joseph Elwell, president ; Mrs. V. C. Haven and Mrs. Enoch Turley, vice-presidents ; Mrs. William Shoemaker, treasurer ; Miss Georgiana Sturges, secretary.\n\nThe medical staff of the hospital was composed of members of the Hahnemann Club, viz. : Drs. Robert J. McClatchey, A. H. Ashton, C. S. Middleton, E. A. Farrington, Pemberton Dudley, B. F. Betts, M. M. Walker, J. R. Earhart, W. H. H. Neville, M. S. Williamson, J. Frishmuth and R. C. Smith, attending physicians ; Mrs. Beulah M. Townsend, matron ; Dr. Thomas L. Bradford, resident physician.\n\nPhoto : Children's Homopathic Hospital, Philadelphia.\n\nThe hospital was opened June 20, 1877, at the northwest corner of Eighth and Poplar streets (now 901 North Eighth street). A dispensary was established in the same building. The building in this location was occupied by the hospital association five years, and in 1883 the hospital was removed to North Board street, where a new site had been secured by purchase at an expense of $24,000. The new building was formally opened March 14, 1883. The hospital had thirty-six beds ; the dispensary was in a separate building in the rear ; the nurse's school was opened in 1886.\n\nThe new quarters were much larger and better suited to the purposes of the hospital association than the former home on Eighth street, but within the brief space of ten years it became evident to the managers that still more commodious buildings must be provided in the near future, and to this end the directors began the work of determining upon a new location with lands of sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the institution for many years. Soon afterward the committee on site and buildings secured lands at the corner of Franklin and Thompson streets, distant one square from Girard avenue.\n\nThe plans for the new hospital contemplated a large central building with extensions on both sides, and the latter have been built as occasion made necessary. On September 14, 1898, ground was broken for the main building and on November 19 following the cornerstone was laid. The structure was completed and formally opened during the week of June 5-12, 1889, and on the latter date the inmates of the old hospital on Broad street were transferred to the new building. The new south wing was begun August 26, 1903, and was finished and opened June 15, 1904. The north wing, now nearly completed, will cost $30,000. The buildings previously erected cost $55,000. The main building has fifty-four beds ; the isolation building four beds ; the south building seventy-two beds, a total of one hundred and twenty-six beds in the hospital. The institution is supported chiefly by the state, and in a less degree by endowments and voluntary contributions. In 1894, at the earnest suggestion of Dr. Bushrod W. James, free beds were set apart for sick and injured newsboys.\n\nPhoto : Hering Building, Medical and Surgical Department.\n\nThe Medical, Surgical and Maternity Hospital of the Women's Homopathic Association of Pennsylvania, in the city of Philadelphia, comprising one of the most worthy institutions in a city famous for noble charities, was founded in 1882, by seventeen women who previously had been members of the auxiliary board of managers of the Homopathic Hospital of Pennsylvania, and who from their experiences in that institution were in position to appreciate the necessity of a home in the city for the care of women in confinement. In carrying their resolution into effect a society was formed, and on December 13, 1882, the Women's Homopathic Association of Pennsylvania was incorporated under the laws of the state. Various means were resorted, to in order to arouse public interest in the proposed institution, and loyal friends soon provided the means to place the association on a safe and lasting basis. In June, 1883, through the generosity of Charles D. Reed, lands at the northeast corner of Susquehanna avenue and Twentieth street were purchased and paid for, Mr. Reed donating the entire purchase price ($30,000) and alse contributing liberally to the general building fund. Another generous benefactor was Miss Mary Jeanes, who gave to the association the occupancy of two houses on Twentieth street, and at her death devised the same for the benefit of the institution. On March 20, 1884, the hospital was opened in these houses. On July 17 of the same near work was begun on the new building and was completed in October, 1887. The state appropriated $20,000 for the construction fund of the association. The main structure when completed was called Hering building, in memory of the late Constantine Hering. It was opened October 13, 1887. The maternity pavilion was finished May 16, 1890, and was called Sargent building, in allusion to Dr. Rufus Sargent. The isolation building was begun in the latter part of 1890, was finished in the next year, and was named Lippe building, in honor of the late Dr. Adolph Lippe, whose admirers had contributed generously to its construction fund. The nurse's school was opened soon after the completion of the hospital. The entire institution is maintained strictly in accordance with the principles of pure homopathy and temperance, and its staff includes nearly all the Hahnemannian homopaths in Philadelphia.\n\nPhoto : Lippe Isolated Pavilion.\n\nThe Homopathic Medical and Surgical Hospital and Dispensary of Pittsburgh, one of the best institutions of its kind in the country, was the result purely of homopathic initiative born of the old-time prejudice on the part of the allopathic school and its disposition to deny homopathic access to the hospitals of the city. The homopathic practitioners of Allegheny county having failed to secure accommodations in the then existing hospitals of the city for patients who desired their treatment, determined to establish a hospital of their own, and for their exclusive use and benefit. For this purpose an informal organization was effected and grounds and buildings on Second avenue near Smithfield street were secured and held, through the influence and good offices of Drs. Burgher, Cote and Hoffman, until a more permanent organization could be accomplished. On April 4, 1866, a charter was obtained, trustees and officers were chosen and the work of the corporation was begun in earnest. Buildings were arranged for the occupancy of the hospital, and the institution was opened for patients on August 1, 1866.\n\nThe hospital was continued in its original building until April, 1882, when the trustees determined to erect new buildings and extend the area of the surrounding grounds. A considerable fund was required to carry out the plans of the corporation, but friends were found in the time of need. William Thaw gave the trustees $50,000 ; the legislature appropriated for the hospital in 1882 the sum of $50,000, and a like sum in 1884. The Ladies' Association \"house warming\" netted more than $17,000 ; Miss Jane Holmes gave $15,000, and many smaller contributions were received from various other sources. With the splendid fund thus created the trustees erected the present hospital structure, comprising two main buildings, one on First avenue and one on Second avenue, the total cost of which was nearly $234,000. From 1882 to 1884 hospital work was suspended on account of the improvements, but the completed structure was opened for patients on April 1, 1884 ; the formal opening was held April 15. On that occasion Dr. Cooper on behalf of the building committee handed the key to Dr. McClelland of the executive committee, who accepted the same with the responsibilities of the trust implied by it. From that time the hospital has been recognized as one of the most worthy institutions of the great city in which it is located, and through the good works there accomplished has been the means of elevating the standard of the homopathic profession both in Pennsylvania and in America. In connection with its general work an excellent nurses' school is maintained. The institution is supported by the interest on its invested funds, the pay of patients, and contributions from benevolent persons. The \"Hospital News\" is a publication issued monthly by an editorial staff chosen by the officiary of the hospital corporation.\n\nPhoto : Sargent, or Maternity Building.\n\nThe Homopathic Medical and Surgical Hospital of Reading is the outgrowth of the still older Reading Homopathic Dispensary Association, which was organized in 1887 and located on Franklin street. A ladies auxiliary association was formed in November, 1888. After active measures for organization and the creation of a necessary fund, a charter was obtained in 1890. Soon afterward the trustees purchased the Dr. Luther Diller property on Sixth street, which was equipped for its intended occupancy through the generosity of the ladies auxiliary. The formal opening was held July 1, 1891, and since that time the hospital has taken rank with the best of the city's charities. The hospital staff is chosen from the homopathic physicians of the city. In 1897 the institution received a bequest of $12,000 from the estate of Maria Von Neida.\n\nPhoto : Homopathic Hospital, Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Woman's Southern Homopathic Hospital of Philadelphia dates its history from the year 1895, and is the outgrowth of a dispensary opened in September, 1893, by Dr. Amelia L. Hess and Miss Annie M. Miller in a small first floor room in what now is Rodman street. The dispensary accomplished much good work and the constantly increasing demands upon it necessitated frequent removals to more commodious quarters. In 1894 Dr. Hannah R. Mulford became a part of the life of the dispensary, and soon afterward it was resolved into a private hospital, and was located on South Seventh street. In 1895 the Woman's Homopathic Club began taking an interest in the work, and the outcome of its efforts was a charter (October 31, 1896) for a hospital corporation and the conduct of a hospital, dispensary and maternity home under the name of the Woman's Southern Homopathic Hospital of Philadelphia. In 1897 the premises on the south side of Spruce street, near Eighth, was purchased and arranged for hospital occupancy. The dispensary is an important department of the work of the hospital. The Ann May memorial home became a department of the greater institution in 1904. It is the gift of Mrs. Albionia Whartenbury of Philadelphia as a memorial of her daughter, Ann May Whartenbury Robinson, and was formally opened at Spring Lake, New Jersey, June 10, 1904.\n\nSt. Luke's Homopathic Hospital of Philadelphia had its origin in a meeting of physicians and laymen held in November, 1895, to discuss the need of a hospital in the north part of the city. An association was formed and a house on North Broad street was secured and equipped for its intended occupancy. The formal opening was accompanied with a three days' public reception, January 7-9, 1896. In October following a training school for nurses was established in connection with the hospital. The trustees incorporation was effected January 30, 1896. On September 14, 1899, the trustees, comprising men only, resigned and their places were filled with women, under whose management the institution has since been conducted. However, the constantly crowded quarters of the hospital made it necessary for the management to secure more commodious quarters in another location, and to that end a building committee was chosen to accomplish the work. In May, 1904, the trustees purchased, at a cost of $75,000, the property formerly owned by Dr. Meyer at the southwest corner of Broad and Wingohocking streets. The stone buildings on this site are now being arranged for hospital uses. The site is most desirable for the purpose for which the property is intended. According to the plans, a dispensary will be provided, and located in a separate building, fronting on Fifteenth street. The main building when fully arranged will contain rooms for fifty beds, and a separate building will be provided for servants' quarters.\n\nPhoto : McClelland in the Operating Room - Pittsburgh Homopathic Hospital.\n\nPhoto : Willard in the Operating Room - Pittsburgh Homopathic Hospital.\n\nThe J. Lewis Crozer Home and Hospital for Incurables, near Chester, was founded through the benevolence of the late Mr. Crozer, for whom the institution is named. He died in April, 1897, and in his will made provision for founding a home for incurables and also a homopathic hospital, for which purpose the sum of $50,000 was set apart from his estate. After his death his widow immediately set out to carry the provisions of the bequest into effect, and in October of that year the work of erecting the home was begun. The buildings are located at Upland, near Chester, and within its comfortable walls are 100 rooms, and 40 beds. The medical staff is selected from the members of the Organon Medical Club of Chester, who have management of the home and hospital. In 1902 a hospital building was erected, and opened July 17, 1903. The grounds of the institution include 36 acres, the gift of Mrs. Crozer independent of her husband's original bequest.\n\nThe Hahnemann Hospital at Scranton became one of the incorporated institutions of the city December 13, 1897, and since that time, has been numbered among the worthy charities of northern and northeastern Pennsylvania. It is a public institution in a sense, in that it is in part supported by the state and in return receives within its hospitable walls patients who are public charges ; otherwise its support is derived from pay patients and voluntary contributions. In the early part of the year mentioned the homopathic physicians of Scranton and interested friends of that school of medicine determined to establish in the city a homopathic hospital, and for that purpose associated together and became a body corporate. This accomplished, the trustees secured the James Blair homestead at the corner of Washington and Mulberry streets, which was the first home of the hospital, but later on more permanent quarters were found through the generosity of W. W. Scranton, who equipped for the trustees a comfortable building at the corner of Linden and Monroe streets. A nurses' school was opened in 1898., the home for nurses was provided in 1902. The trustees and hospital association are now taking steps toward the erection of a new and modern hospital building.\n\nThe West Philadelphia Homopathic Hospital and Dispensary was founded in June, 1903, and permanently organized in 1904, when the property at the corner of Girard avenue and Fifty-fifth street was secured as the home of the institution.\n\nREMINISCENCES.\n\nThe first epoch in the history of homopathy in Pennsylvania extends to 1835, when the first college of homopathy in the world -Allentown Academy- was established. During this first epoch the system of Hahnemann had been introduced into two states at nearly the same time and without concert of action.\n\nTo Dr. Henry Detwiller, then of Hellertown, is due the honor of having given the first homopathic prescription in Pennsylvania, and the time, July 23, 1828. He was born in Langenbruch, Canton Basil, Landschaft, Switzerland, December 13, 1795. At the village school he showed such aptitude for learning that when he was thirteen he was sent to a French institute at St. Immier, where he remained until he was fifteen, when he became a private pupil of Laurentius Senor, M. D., a graduate of Wurzburg, under whose tuition he prepared for matriculation in the medical department of the University of Freiburg, in the grand duchy of Baden. He was admitted in this institution in the spring of 1814, and studied there for five consecutive semesters. After leaving the university, having barely reached his majority, and being fond of the natural sciences, he felt a strong desire to investigate and to explore the regions of America. So he left Basil in the spring of 1817. Several hundred emigrants accompanied him to Amsterdam, and on the passage he acted as physician to the company. When he arrived at Muyden, near Amsterdam, he was asked to present himself to a medical board for examination, which he did, and passing successfully, was appointed physician on the ship \"John of Baltimore.\" an American vessel from Boston. It was an old three master, on its farewell trip, almost worn out and unseaworthy, but it took on board over four hundred men, women and children. The captain taking a southerly course, going south of Bermuda in the middle of July, the oppressive heat produced dysentery, cholera morbus and a prostrating diarrha. The ship's medicine chest was not properly supplied and Dr. Detwiller and General Vandame were obliged to furnish medicines from their own private stores. The vessel reached Philadelphia the last of July. The passengers were largely redemptioners and were obliged to remain on board until properly disposed of. Many were sick and they with those similarly afflicted from another vessel in port were entrusted to Dr. Detwiller by the port physician, and the official physician at quarantine placed the same trust in him.\n\nPhoto : Henry Detwiller, M. D.\n\nWhile thus detained in Philadelphia Dr. Detwiller through General Vandame became acquainted with Dr. Monges, a French physician who often called him in consultation in the family of General Vandame and other French refugees then in Philadelphia. At the suggestion of Joseph Bonaparte, General Vandame and Dr. Monges, Detwiller abandoned his original purpose of going into the Indian country, and decided to establish himself in a locality where the German language was chiefly spoken. Being well provided with letters of introduction, he went to Allentown, Pa., and on September 2, 1817, entered the office of Dr. Charles H. Martin as an assistant. Here he remained for seven months. During the fall and winter of 1817-18 there appeared in many parts of Lehigh and the adjoining counties a disease attacking whole families with more or less severity, and attended in convalescence with frequent relapses, the patients being sick for months and then often dying from phthisis or dropsy. This disease was diagnosed by the physicians as bilious colic, as one of the most prominent symptoms was abdominal or intestinal pain, with very obstinate costiveness and vomiting. The treatment had been with opium and calomel in very large doses, powerful laxatives, tobacco smoke even being forced into the rectum, while salivation was indulged in extensively. Detwiller was able to discover that the real cause of the prevalent epidemic was lead poisoning produced from the glazing with litharge of earthen pots in which apple butter, often rather sour, had been kept. This discovery and his successful antidotal treatment gained for the young doctor a great reputation, and he was urged to settle in many different localities. He finally selected Hellertown, and in April, 1818, opened an office there. In December he married Elizabeth Appel, a native of the vicinity, and who died seventeen years later, leaving three sons and four daughters.\n\nDr. Detwiller writes of himself : \"I began to practice homopathy in the year 1828, July 23, at Hellertown, Pa. Dr. W. Wesselhoeft at that time practicing in Bath, Dr. E. Freytag in Bethlehem, Dr. Becker in Kreidersville, myself at Hellertown, all in Northampton county, met frequently at the house of Dr. Freytag, interchanged our experiences in the then to us, new practice, prepared a kind of repertory for our own use. Homopathic treatment in an epidemic of dysentery in the fall of 1829 (where out of 86 only two proved fatal) urged us to closer studies. Dr. Wesselhoeft furnished books and medicines which he received from his friend Dr. Stapf as a present. In 1831 I received the then extant whole library of works on homopathy, together with the medicines, from my friend Dr. Siegrist in Basil.\"\n\nDr. Wesselhoeft in Bath was twelve miles north of Hellertown, but he often met Detwiller socially and in consultation. At one of these meetings Wesselhoeft said that he had received from his father and Dr. Stapf in Germany some books on homopathy and a box of homopathic medicines. They commenced to investigate the new system. Detwiller studied up a case he then had on hand and decided that pulsatilla was the proper remedy. He gave it, the first dose of homopathic medicine given in Pennsylvania, on July 23, 1828. The result was a speedy cure. From this time he was a steady practitioner and champion of the principles of homopathy.\n\nDr. Wesselhoeft soon began to give homopathic, medicines, and Dr. Eberhard Freytag also. The Rev. Christian J. Becker of Kreidersville, of whom Detwiller speaks, was a clergyman who had been partially educated in medicine and became greatly interested in the new method. The result of the investigations convinced him of its truth and he practiced with considerable success among the pool of his neighborhood. In 1830 Dr. John Romig joined this band of workers.\n\nIn 1836 Dr. Detwiller visited Europe in company with his eldest son, whom he placed at school where he was to remain for four years. While in Europe he visited Professors Schoenlein, Oken and Schintz at Zurich to converse upon scientific subjects. He also had several interviews with Hahnemann in Paris in the interests of homopathy in the United States, and especially of the Allentown Academy, then just started. He also visited his alma mater, presenting his certificates of examination (absolutorium) executed in the fall of 1816, when be was unable because of youth to receive his diploma.\n\nThus, after an absence of twenty years, he applied to the medical faculty for a re-examination. After a most thorough examination on the different branches including operations on the cadaver, he was granted a diploma.\n\nHe returned to the United States and resumed practice at Hellertown, remaining there until 1852, when he removed to Easton. He introduced homopathy into Easton and had much opposition at first to contend against. During his long residence at Hellertown, Detwiller, notwithstanding his very extensive and arduous practice, always found time to follow his favorite study of natural science. He collected his \"Flora Sauconensis,\" his specimens having been gathered largely in upper and lower Saucon. He made many botanical excursions with his friends De Schweinetz and Huebner. His ornithological specimens, the mammals, reptiliæ, cheloniæ, etc., represent nearly the whole fauna of Pennsylvania. The greater part of this collection was donated to public institutions and museums in Europe, especially to the University of Basil, he being corresponding member of the Natural History Society there.\n\nPhoto : Samuel R. Dubs, M. D.\n\nIn 1836 he became a member of the faculty of the Allentown Academy. He was one of the organizers of the American Institute of Homopathy in 1844. In 1866 he assisted in the formation of the Pennsylvania State Homopathic Society. In 1886 at the dedication of the Hahnemann Medical College building on Broad street, Philadelphia, he was present, bowed with the weight of years, and with long whitened hair, but with eyes still bright and skin clear.\n\nDR. Detwiller died at Easton April 21, 1887. He had been seventy-two years in practice and was ninety-two years of age. About three weeks before his death he arose at an early hour, as had been his habit from childhood, took his regular morning walk, and near the corner of Fourth and Northampton streets fell, striking his forehead on the pavement. He was assisted to his feet, returned to his office, partook of his customary lunch and went to Bethlehem to attend several patients. The next day he made professional calls at Frenchtown, N. J., and in the evening of the third day began to feel the effects of his fall. He was then confined to his room but almost to the last gave directions for the treatment of his patients. He was interested in educational matters and in many business enterprises. His family consisted : of three sons and four daughters. He left twenty-seven grandchildren, twenty-one great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.\n\nAs has been stated, the companion of Dr. Detwiller in the first investigation in Pennsylvania of the truth of homopathy was Dr. William Wesselhoeft (1) of Bath in Northampton county. He was the second son of Karl Wesselhoeft, who, with his brother-in-law, Friedrich Frommann, owned the largest publishing house in the university town of Jena during the palmy days of Saxe-Weimar. William was born in 1794 and when he was four years old his father moved from Chemnitz. When he was ten years of age Goethe took a kindly interest in his education and gave him pencils and paper and friendly advice, in order to foster a love for drawing, for he believed that art was an essential to early education, and he himself excelled in it. Nor did Karl, the father, stint these educational advantages, though impoverished by the wars with Napoleon. He had residing in his family as private tutor to his children the celebrated De Wette, afterward professor of theology at Berlin and later at Basle ; and after De Wette, Grossman, who became superintendent of the Lutheran churches at Leipsic. This family school consisted of William, his brothers Edward and Robert, his sister Wilhelmina, and a ward of his uncle Frommann, Minna Herzlied, celebrated in the \"Memoirs of Goethe\" as one of the ladies who for a time held the sentimental poet's heart.\n\n(1)\n\nMemorial of Dr. William Wesselhoeft, by Elizabeth P. Peabody, Boston, 1859.\n\nIn 1809 Wesselhoeft became a pupil at the Real-Schule of Nuremburg, then under the direction of G. H. von Schubert, the great natural philosopher and psychologist, in whose autobiography may be found frequent mention of young Wesselhoeft. Here, besides studying Latin and Greek, he began his profound studies in the natural sciences, including anatomy, of which he was very fond, becoming very expert in anatomical drawings. His botanical studies also were extensive, and he prepared a valuable hortus siccus. During his student life, he was in the habit of making extensive tours for the purpose of explorations in botany, mineralogy and geology, and his collections of mineral and geological specimens were given to Dr. Adolph Douai for the benefit of the students in the Perkins Institution for the Blind.\n\nOur young savant also studied transcendental physics with the celebrated Oken. In 1813, being nineteen years old, he entered the University of Jena, graduating there seven years afterward as doctor of medicine, having perfected his general and medical education at the universities of Berlin and Wurzburg, at each of which he resided for a season, and at which he passed the second and third examinations necessary in Germany to obtain a license to practice medicine.\n\nWesselhoeft was not only a scholar of parts but also an attractive man of the world. At this time Goethe was much interested in meteorology, and Wesselhoeft enjoyed making observations of the clouds for him at the observatory at Jena.\n\nWesselhoeft was in sympathy with the young patriots who had returned from German army service, in which struggle Koerner fell in 1806. When in Berlin in 1819 he became intimate with \"Old Jahn,\" who invented the modern system of gymnastics and had in Berlin a gymnasium as early as 1811. It was the time of the Burschenschaften in Germany, or secret political societies to promote nationality ; and William and Robert Wesselhoeft, who were students at Jena, were very active in promoting these organizations. These Burschenschaften were betrayed by a traitor and many were arrested, among them William and Robert Wesselhoeft. William, who was at the time pursuing his studies at Berlin, was thrown into the political prison, and Robert was confined in the fortress at Magdeburg. William escaped after a two months' imprisonment and was for a long time concealed in his father's house at Jena. Then young Dr. William wished to go to the assistance of the Greeks, who were struggling for freedom. He became surgeon to the German Philhellenen and started well equipped with surgical appliances. Indeed so ample was the quantity of lint and of bandages prepared by his sister Wilhelmina, his friend Ferdinanda, and others in the secret, that it is said to have served him all his life. When he arrived at Marseilles an injunction was laid on the vessel, and no more volunteers could go to Greece. From Marseilles he went to Switzerland, where were his friends Fallen and Beck and De Wette, who had found positions at the University of Basle. In this university Wesselhoeft also found employment as demonstrator of anatomy and assistant oculist. He remained there two years, and spent his vacations in tours among the lofty mountains not only for love of natural science but for the picturesque. During the later years of his life he often talked of revisiting Switzerland, and the last picture he purchased was a painting of the Alps reminding him, as he said, of his own youth.\n\nBut there was interference by the allied powers with the German refugees, driving Drs. Follen and Beck from Switzerland, and compelling Wesselhoeft to leave for America at the same time. Some letters showing his sympathy with Follen had fallen into the hands of the despots. He sailed from Antwerp and was four months on the voyage. On his arrival he went to Lehigh county, Pa., where lived a German family he had known at home. From there he went to Northampton county, seeking a place to practice, and finally settled at Bath, where the population was largely German. Follen and Beck, who also came to America, made efforts to induce him to go to Massachusetts. In 1825 Ticknor wrote asking him to take charge of the gymnasium at Cambridge and Boston, but already a large practice occupied him at Bath and he refused. Here he married Sarah Palmer, in whose family he had become known by his professional calls as an allopathic physician. Even then he was meditating a change, and studying the system of Hahnemann. He frankly told his fiancee his plans, of the unsatisfactory methods of the prevailing therapeutics, and of the possibility that his change in medical practice would for a time hurt his income.\n\nSoon after Wesselhoeft had come to America certain of his old classmates had become interested in homopathy and wrote to him to test the medicines. His old friend Stapf sent him the Organon provings, together with homopathic medicines. At first it seemed absurd to him, but a love of fair play to the man who had devoted so much time to this new materia medica induced him to test its virtues. Infinitesimal doses were hardest to accept. His first experiment was in a case of ozæna whose symptoms indicated Hahnemann's thirtieth dilution of some medicine. He said : \"I was really ashamed to give the thirtieth dilution and substituted the sixth.\" When he went the next day his patient was sitting up in bed, the symptoms much worse and she very angry. The disease was cured, however, without another dose. Among his first successes was his treatment of croup with pongia and hepar. He communicated these cases to Freytag, Detwiller and to others, and they engaged in personal investigation. So great was the confidence in him that his patients were willing to take the small doses that he soon began to prescribe. The story of the first provers' union, the first society, the Allentown Academy, with all which Wesselhoeft was identified, will appear in proper sequence. When the success of the academy became doubtful, Hering went to Philadelphia and Wesselhoeft to Allentown to try to support the institution.\n\nIn 1842 Wesselhoeft decided to remove to Boston. His brother Robert, who had been a lawyer in Weimar and an officer of the government, was arrested with other members of the Burschenschaften, and for seven years was kept in mild imprisonment, but on the accession of Frederick William IV of Prussia, he was released, returned to Jena, married, and was given his old government position. But his principles were too liberal, and he was requested by the authorities to leave Europe and take up his abode in America. With his family he came to Allentown and made his home with his brother. Robert was taught the materia medica during the year they resided at Allentown. He afterward removed to Cambridge, Mass., and William to Boston, and it was not long before they together founded the Brattleboro (Vt.) water cure. This was established in 1846, and was continued until 1851. Dr. William expected in removing from the interior of Pennsylvania to Boston to find again that cultured companionship he had known in Germany, and doubtless believed the physicians of Boston would be liberal enough to investigate the new medical system ; but he was met by ridicule and contempt. He passed his sons and nephews through Harvard Medical School, however, and set himself quietly to practice. At that time there were four or five homopathic physicians in Boston, among whom Wesselhoeft's greater experience gave him the lead. He was soon engaged in a large and lucrative practice. During the last year of his life he became aware that he was overtaxing his constitution. He went for a vacation to the country, but a cold brought him back to the city. He sent to Philadelphia for Hering, his old friend, refusing to see all others that he might have strength to talk to him. About twelve hours before he could expect him to arrive he was sitting near his wife, her hand in his, when suddenly he brought his other hand upon it, pressed it tenderly several times and said \"Will you go with me ?\" Then he arose, made two or three firm steps towards the bed and fell. On being raised up it was seen that he \"was beyond and above\" -September 1, 1858.\n\nAnother of this little medical fraternity in Pennsylvania was Eberhard Freytag, then practicing in Bethlehem. At that time he was sixty years old. He was associated with all the advancements of the new system in Northampton county, in the first society and the academy. Until the time of his death. March 14, 1846, he was an enthusiastic believer in the new medical law. He was one of the charter members of the institute, and his was the first death presented to that society. He was 82 years when he died. The records of his life are meagre. The Northampton County Homopathic Medical Society passed resolutions of regret and resolved to report the death at the meeting of homopathic physicians about to assemble in convention at Philadelphia in May. These resolutions appear in the transactions of the American Institute of Homopathy for 1846.\n\nRev. Christian J. Becker was an original director of Allentown Academy. He became a successful practitioner among his parishioners and was a member of the first homopathic medical society. About 1838 he practiced homopathy at Harrisburg.\n\nPhoto : H. H. Hoffman, M. D.\n\nDr. John Romig was born in Lehigh county, January 3, 1804, and was of German ancestry. He graduated at the University of Pennsylvania in 1825, and located at Fogelsville, Lehigh county. In the spring of 1829 he removed to Allentown, forming a partnership with Dr. Charles H. Martin. About 1832 or 1833 he commenced to practice homopathy and was associated in all the homopathic enterprises of that time. He was professor of obstetrics in the Allentown Academy. In 1838 he removed to Baltimore with others to introduce homopathy. Drs. Haynel and McManus were then in homopathic practice there. He remained but two years, returning to Allentown, where he passed the rest of his life. He had two sons, William H. and George M. Romig, both graduates of the University of Pennsylvania and of the Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia, George in 1870 and William in 1871.\n\nOne of the important members of this homopathic brotherhood and one whose influence was extensive, was Rev. Johannes Helfrich. He was the son of Rev. John Henry Helfrich of Mosbach in Germany, who was sent to America by the Moravian synod of Holland in 1771. He was placed at Weisenberg in Lehigh county (then called Northampton) and at this place Johannes was born January 17, 1795. He was educated for the ministry at Philadelphia and while vet there pursuing his studies he was called to the charge left vacant by his father's recent death. This was in the spring of 1816. He was licensed and accepted the call, and three years later he received ordination at the synod of Lancaster. He served this charge all his life. On April 19, 1818, he married Salome Schantz. Three years after marriage he purchased a home within a mile from that in which his father had resided. He was a warm friend of the Germans and his house became a hospitable home for many immigrants. Until his two sons were grown to manhood he kept, at different times, six very able German teachers who were well versed in the sciences. At this time his home was known all about the country as the \"Weisenberg Academy.\" He was the means of educating many who afterwards became professional and influential men. Among the German professors at his academy was Dr. William Wesselhoeft. It was through Wesselhoeft that Mr. Helfrich became interested in homopathy. He read his medical books, listened to his discussions on the new medical law, and with him made many botanical expeditions in order to find new remedies. Mr. Helfrich also became intimate with Hering and was greatly influenced by his enthusiasm. For a number of years Mr. Helfrich in connection with his pastoral labors was accustomed to prescribe homopathic remedies for the ailments of his parishioners, but this so overtaxed his strength that he required all patients to call at his home. It was soon filled with invalids and took the form of a hospital, rather than a school. In the fall of 1830 Mr. Helfrich arranged his work to devote two days weekly to medical treatment. On these days as many as twenty or thirty patients were regularly present and homopathy was given a practical test. Dr. Wesselhoeft, at that time settled at Bath, made weekly visits to the Weisenberg hospital to assist in the treatment and to further instruct Helfrich. The results of this clinic and dispensary were very encouraging. These meetings were continued until the establishment of the Northampton society in 1834. Then came the establishment of the Allentown Academy, of which Mr. Helfrich was a founder. From this, institution Mr. Helfrich received one of the first diplomas granted. He was now fully established as a physician and the demands upon his medical skill constantly increased. His eldest son, John Henry Helfrich, graduated in Philadelphia as a physician in 1846 and established himself in his father's home in Weisenberg. In 1849 Mr. Helfrich published a German book on homopathic veterinary practice, the first book on the subject published in this country. Dr. J. H. Helfrich, the son, practiced in Allentown until his death. The elder Helfrich died April 8, 1852.\n\nThe weekly reunions of these earnest physicians, Wesselhoeft, Detwiller, Freytag and Becker, were begun in 1828, and were held for convenience at the house of Dr. Freytag in Bethlehem. In 1829 an epidemic of dysentery occurred in Northampton county, and at that time Dr. Wesselhoeft gave up the old practice and devoted himself entirely to the practice of homopathy. For a year he treated free all cases that came to him, wishing to learn more thoroughly the new materia medica. He established offices in Bath and surrounding places, where he invited the sick to come for treatment, and he devoted a part of each day to these clinics. Previous to 1830 he furnished all the medicines and books, but in that year Dr. Detwiller received the complete publications of homopathy and also its medicines from Dr. Siegrist of Basel (Basle), who had been practicing homopathy in Switzerland for several years. But there was need of a more extended organization, and on August 23, 1834, was formed the Homopathic Society of Northampton and Counties Adjacent, of which mention is made elsewhere in this chapter. In the meantime, however, homopathy had been introduced into Philadelphia by Dr. Carl Ihm, a native of Frankfort-on-the-Main, and a graduate of the University of Wurzburg, in Bavaria. It is supposed that his coming to Philadelphia was induced by William Geisse, a wealthy German merchant of that city, and a personal friend of Hahnemann, with the purpose of investigating the truth of homopathy. Dr. Ihm studied the doctrine, adopted its tenets and began practice. He was the first homopathic physician in the city. In the latter part of 1833 he went to Tioga county, practiced there with Dr. Lewis Saynich, and afterward went to Cuba.\n\nPhoto : J. C. Burgher, M. D.\n\nThe question of precedence in, next prescribing homopathic medicines in Philadelphia seems to lie between Dr. Charles F. Matlack and Dr. George H. Bute. Matlack graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1820. In an autograph letter he writes : \"I may here remark that I believe I was the first American physician in chronological order who practiced in Philadelphia according to the homopathic method. I employed it by way of experiment as early as the winter of 1832-33.\" He practiced homopathy in the city for many years, removing thence to Germantown in 1851. In 1833 he translated Hering's address before the Hahnemannian Society -Kurze Uebersicht der Homopathischen Heilkunst (A Concise View of the Rise and Progress, of Homopathic Medicine). He died in 1874. Dr. Matlack was a member of the Society of Friends and his early stand for homopathy probably influenced the course taken by so many of that sect, both in the United States and in England, in relation to the adoption of homopathy.\n\nGeorge Henry Bute was born in the duchy of Schaumburg Lippe, Bueckeburg, May 20, 1792. During the French dominion in Germany he left home to escape military conscription. He led a roving life for several years, serving on a Dutch man-of-war. He visited the southern parts of Europe, even Constantinople, but deserted at Genoa, traversed Germany on foot and came to the United States, reaching Philadelphia in August, 1819. He became acquainted with the Moravians through their bishop, and in 1822 entered Nazareth Hail, the Moravian boarding school at Nazareth, Pa., as teacher. He married at Nazareth Mary Bardill, daughter of a Moravian missionary, in April, 1825, and returned to Philadelphia, where he was employed in a store until after the arrival from Germany of his younger brother Charles, when the two started a sugar refinery. In 1828 he received a special commission to go to Surinam (Dutch Guiana) as a Moravian missionary. Being stationed in the city of Paramaribo, he became acquainted with Dr. Constantine Hering, who was there as a botanist and geologist for the Saxon government, and who was also practicing homopathy. Bute became a student of Hering, but returned to the United States in 1831. He landed in Boston and later went to Nazareth to perfect himself in medicine. The cholera epidemic of 1832 broke out in Philadelphia and he went there, devoting his time to the care of the victims and the custody of the hospital on Cherry street. He was a partner with Hering in Philadelphia and practiced there for six years, when ill health compelled his return to Nazareth, where he passed the rest of his life. He died there February 13, 1876, aged eighty-three years. He was the prover, of several important remedies and all his life was enthusiastic in the advancement of homopathy.\n\nConstantine Hering was the most powerful factor in the growth of early American homopathy. He was a physician, poet, scientist, naturalist, psychologist, scholar and author. Reaching America just at a time when there was need of some one to organize the few men who were practicing homopathy and to find methods to spread the new medical doctrine, Hering was able to accomplish all these things. When he had been in this country only a few months we find him addressing the little Philadelphia Homopathic Society on the subject of homopathy, in which address he gave a complete account of Hahnemann and his discoveries and practice. He was the principal mover in the establishment of that first college of homopathy, the Allentown Academy, whose graduates spread the truths of the new doctrine all over the country, although in 1835, when the academy was opened, there were no practitioners of the system in any state except New York and Pennsylvania ; in 1840 there were practitioners in sixteen different states, and the pupils of the Allentown Academy had carried the new medical system into all of them.\n\nConstantine Hering was born in Oschatz, a small town between Dresden and Leipsic, January 1, 1800. The family originally was from Moravia and the family name was Hrinka. His father was devoted to teaching and music, and published several works on musical instruction. In 1795 he was given the position of conrector and organist of the church of Oschatz, with the title of magister. His family consisted of three daughters and four sons. When Constantine Hering was born his father was seated at the organ, and when the news was brought to him, answered with that grand old anthem of praise, \"Nun Danket Alle Gott.\" The diligence passed through the town of Oschatz and often a traveler of note stopped over night and spent the evening with Magister Hering. Hering listened to their talk. Seume, a literary man, inspired him with his talk about America and democracy and love of freedom and hatred of the privileged classes. His teachers were cultured men ; August Rudolph was an excellent mathematician and taught him to love mathematics. History young Hering called \"a collection of foolish and horrible things.\" He preferred the study of plants, insects and stones. He earned reproof from Herr Rudolph by refusing to call Peter of Russia, Peter the Great, but wrote in his composition, \"Peter, whom fools call great.\" Hering in his boyhood saw the march to Russia of the French army, and its terrible retreat. A part of the army passed by his father's door, and one day a company halted and demanded food. Constantine, then twelve, ran out with a loaf of black (rye) bread, which an officer took only to fling it on the ground where it was kicked about by the soldiers. \"It's good bread,\" said the boy, \"my mother made it ; don't you know God will punish you for throwing bread away ?\" On the retreat the same squad stopped again at the door and again young Hering took out bread, this time white bread, to them. The same officer, wasted and in rags, his arm in a sling, met the boy. \"Ah ! my boy,\" he explained, \"the curse you told us of has fallen upon us.\"\n\nHering found his first stimulus to natural history on a grapevine, the caterpillar called sphynx atropos. This atropos, followed in later years by the lachesis (the poisonous snake), reminded him of the \"Three Fates.\" He once said : \"The destinies have come to me in reverse order.\" First came atropos, the inflexible, who cuts the thread of life, next lachesis, who spins it, and finally clotho, holding the distaff. He likened his work in writing the materia medica to the spinning of threads in a fabric, and when the web was well done, he said, \"When I shall be called hence the work will be left on the loom for other hands to weave.\" He now became enthusiastic in collecting insects, stones and plants. He made long excursions to the neighboring hills and valleys and returned laden with specimens. He would stop at some inn to arrange them, and it was there he learned the plain simple language he so much loved.\n\nIn 1817 the young naturalist was sent to an academy in Dresden, where he studied surgery. A year later a copy of Euclid fell into his hands at an old book stall. He resolved to go home and give himself to Greek and mathematics, which he did until 1820, when he went to Leipsic, where he studied seven courses in medicine. He then went to Wurzburg, attracted by the fame of Schoenlein, the pathologist, with whom he formed a friendship which his conversion to homopathy never disturbed. He graduated at Wurzburg with the highest honors, in 1826. As was the custom, he presented at graduation a thesis which he was obliged to defend in public disputation with members of the faculty and students. The following preamble in Latin was printed on the cover of his dissertation :\n\n\"Johann Lucas Schoenlein, Dean pro tempore of the gracious order of physicians, Doctor of Philosophy, Medicine and Surgery, and public professor in ordinary, etc., etc., with all due courtesy, invites the noble vice-rector of the Academy, the senate fathers, the professors of all grades, the academic citizens, finally men of letters and the patrons of letters, to public disputation, to be held March 22d, 1826, at 9 A. M., by the very noble, illustrious and learned man, Mr. Constantine Hering, Saxon, under the presidency of Caritanus Textor, Doctor of Philosophy, Medicine and Surgery, Aulic. Councilor to the August King of Bavaria, and public professor in ordinary, etc., etc., for the purpose of duly obtaining the highest honors in Medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics.\"\n\nThis printed invitation which young Hering had to extend for his disputatio inauguralis contained a number of short propositions or theses in Latin, each one of which he stood ready to defend in argument. A translation of the \"Questiones inaugulares and Theses\" is here given :\n\n1. Springs are living fossils.\n\n2. I hold that there are nerves in the placenta.\n\n3. The \"ganglion petrosum\" is to the ear what the \"ganglion ophthalmicum\" is to the eye.\n\n4. The olfactory, optic and acoustic nerves are apophyses of the cerebrum and cerebellum, not nerves.\n\n5. The old man is the perfect man.\n\n6. Materia Medica is to Hahnemann what Pathology was to Hippocrates.\n\n7. Such as life is, is disease.\n\n8. The rational system is not merely the better, but the only one in pathology.\n\n9. I deny psychical diseases.\n\n10. Any disease may be removed at any stage.\n\nHering received his degree of doctor of medicine, surgery and obstetrics, March 22, 1826. His medical examination was severe, doubly so because of his known devotion to homopathy. From 1817 to 1826, the nine years previous to graduation, Hering's life was that of a student. By his fellows he was nicknamed \"Wisent,\" from his studious habits. He was poor and his privations were many. He first became interested in homopathy by promising to write against it. His preceptor in the University of Leipsic, Dr. J. Henry Robbi, who had been surgeon in the army of Napoleon and had served in Larrey's ambulance, introduced Hering into practical surgery and in 1820 made him one of his assistants. Baumgartner, the founder of a publishing house, wanted a book written against homopathy, for after Hahnemann was obliged to leave Leipsic to escape persecution it was thought that homopathy would die out, but as this death seemed too slow this book was intended to hasten the end. Robbi was offered the work but refused and recommended his assistant. It was nearly completed when, in order to make quotations, Hering was provided with Hahnemann's books. In the third volume of the \"Materia Medica\" he found the \"nota bene for my critics.\" This induced him to make experiments, and ended in convincing him of the truth of homopathy The book was never finished. An old friend, an apothecary, was delighted that he was writing against homopathy, but when Hering went to him one day for some peruvian bark, telling him he wished it for a homopathic proving, his friend said, \"My\" young friend, don't you know there is danger in that ?\" Hering replied that as he was a mathematician he believed he could distinguish the true from the false. His old friends and others now shunned him and said he was going crazy.\n\nIn making an autopsy Hering poisoned a finger, which soon became gangrenous. Leeches, calomel and caustics were of no avail and amputation was advised and rejected. He did not yet believe that external diseases could be benefited by internal remedies and when an older practitioner of homopathy proposed to treat the hand with homopathic pellets, he ridiculed the suggestion, but permitted him to give him some small doses of arsenic. The wound soon began to heal. Hering said of this : \"I owed to it far more than the preservation of a finger. To Hahnemann, who had saved my finger, I gave my whole hand, and to the promulgation of his teaching, not only my hand, but the entire man, body and soul.\"\n\nPhoto : Hering's Lachesis Snake.\n\nAfter graduation Hering became a teacher of natural sciences and mathematics in the Blochmann Institute, an academy in Dresden for educating young noblemen. On recommendation of Blochmann, he was sent by the king of Saxony on a botanical and zoological expedition to Surinam and Cayenne. An old friend, Christophe Weigel, was appointed, botanist to the expedition. He remained in Surinam six years. While he pursued his naturalist work he also practiced homopathy. He resided in the Moravian colony of Surinam and had every opportunity to practice his profession. During his stay he wrote letters and papers on homopathy for his friend Stapf, editor of the \"Archiv fur die homoopathishee Heilkunst,\" a homopathic journal of that period. This offended the physician of the king, and orders were sent from the government to abandon his homopathy and to attend to his zoological duties alone, and in future to avoid publishing such offensive articles. The day after he received this letter Hering made up his accounts and sent them with a letter resigning further connection with the governmental mission. He then commenced the practice of homopathy in Paramaribo, at the same time continued collecting specimens. This double pursuit he soon found too much, and learning through a friend, George Bute, that an academy of natural sciences had been founded in Philadelphia, and that Rev. Mr. Schweinitz, a well known mycologist, was a prominent member, he decided in 1830 to send all his botonical collections, mostly cryptogramic, and zoological collections to this academy. He did so and became a corresponding member. The life of Constantine Hering in Guiana was interesting. He was a visitor to the leper colony of Surinam, seeking to alleviate the terrible suffering, and his observations there greatly enriched the therapeutics of leprosy. He studied the habits and customs of the Creoles, mulattoes, negroes and Arrowackian Indians. He penetrated deep into the trackless forest to meet this tribe, and it was there he found the surukuku snake -the lachesis- whose attenuated venom has relieved many sick people since that time. While he was in South America in July, 1828, Hering and his wife were living in a little camp on the upper Amazon river ; on the edge of the great tropical forests. The natives were his assistants and had told him much of a deadly serpent living there and he had offered them a reward for a live specimen. One day they brought in a bamboo box, and then fled from the place. They had brought him a living ghurukuku, the most venomous of their snakes. It was the lachesis trigonacephalus, or lance-headed viper. He and his wife were alone, and he was about to risk life itself in order to obtain its venom. As the box was opened he struck the snake a blow on the head, and then placed the head under a forked stick and pressed out the poison on sugar of milk. The poison thus obtained was for many years the only supply used in preparing the attenuations of our lachesis. He brought the dead snake with him to the United States and it is now preserved in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.\n\nThe ship in which Hering sailed from South America was old and badly handled. She was bound for Salem, Mass., but went ashore on the Rhode Island coast, and finally put in at Martha's Vineyard. Hering stepped ashore on a Sunday morning in January, 1833. On the ground lay snow, the first he had seen in seven years. \"I took it up,\" he said, \"and was happy.\" He soon went to Philadelphia, and there passed the rest of his life. Dr. Hering always retained pleasant recollections of his life in South America. He kept the golden piece, his first fee there, as a keep-sake and his son-in-law, Dr. Knerr, still has it.\n\nIn Pennsylvania in 1833 there were ten physicians practicing homopathy, and of these, Drs. Bute, Ihm and Matlack were in Philadelphia. Bute at once welcomed Hering, who became associated with him in practice. Although he had to fight bitter prejudice, it was not long before his skill gained for him a large clientage. In the first year of his, residence in the city he married Marianne Hussman, daughter of George Hussman. Dr. Hering's influence was at once felt. There was the faithful coterie in Northampton county, Louis Saynich was at Blossburg, and Edward Mansa in Buffalo township. Hering was welcomed, and in that same year of 1833 there was formed in Philadelphia the Hahnemannian Society. It was organized on Hahnemann's birthday, April 10, 1833, but three months after Hering reached the city, and was composed of both physicians and laymen. On April 18, 1833, Hering delivered a scholarly address \"A Concise View of the Rise and Progress of Homopathic Medicine,\" in which he gave an account of the life of Hahnemann, his progressive discoveries in medicine and a lucid explanation of the real principles underlying homopathy. He said : \"May our beneficent Society largely contribute to the wider prevalence and reception of the Hahnemannian doctrines ; may that which single individuals can of themselves scarcely achieve be effectuated by united efforts : then in this blessed country, may the miseries of disease be diminished, future generations be rescued from its leaden fetters, the bitterest human misery-disease bearing down all earthly joy become less from year to year and the sweetest boon on earth-health and domestic felicity, become the portion of growing thousands. * * * It will succeed here sooner than in Europe, for, among a free people, who with practiced eyes, soon discern the truly useful, a treasure like this new art must quickly be estimated in a degree commensurate with its real value. * * * The American people demand facts and upon these we can confidently and securely rest for our support. The language of opposition may be employed against it, but truth is not long obscured here by forms of speech. The victory will be ours, and in a century to come the anniversary of our society, this first step on the way which must lead to the public and general acknowledgment of the new doctrines will be solemnized with grateful remembrance. So great an aim cannot be attained without labor, but we are prepared to undertake it ; we shall not arrive at it without conflict, but we stand equipped for conflict ; we shall not reach it without defamation, but we will suffer ridicule and defamation with composure.\"\n\nHering's address was published in German by Wesselhoeft, and was translated into English by Matlack and published by the Hahnemannian Society in 1833. It made a small octavo pamphlet of thirty pages, and was the second homopathic publication printed in the United States. Having been printed in German and English, and being largely circulated and extensively noted and quoted by the public press, the address brought homopathy to the notice of the people. Dr. Hering died in Philadelphia, July 23, 1880.\n\nPhoto : John Henry Floto, M. D.\n\nDr. P. Scheurer was of the Allentown coterie. He was born in Lehigh county, August 18, 1799, and labored in the ministry for fifty years. Ill health induced him to read medical books and he acquired a knowledge regarding the practice of medicine. In 1839 he became interested in homopathy and afterward practiced successfully, devoting nearly all his time to it. He died at Hanover, April 20, 1875.\n\nIn the list of directors of Allentown Academy appears the name John Henry Floto. He also was a student and received a diploma. He went to California and lived to enjoy the distinction of being the oldest homopathic physician in the world. In January, 1896, the \"Pacific Coast Journal of Homopathy\" published his picture with the legend : \"John H. Floto, the oldest practicing homopathist in the world.\"\n\nChristian Frederic Geist was a member of the Allentown Academy in 1836. He afterward practiced in Boston.\n\nAnother of the students of Allentown Academy was Charles Haeseler. After graduation in 1836 he went to Lewistown in Lebanon county, where he remained two years. He afterward settled in Pottsville.\n\nJacob Schmidt was a student at Allentown. He was born at Kreuznach, Germany, June 29, 1813, came to the United States in 1836 and found employment in his profession as civil engineer. He was received by Hering as a student in his office and member in his family. He remained three years, having meanwhile attended lectures at the Pennsylvania College (allopathic), and received a degree from the Allentown Academy. Dr. Schmidt located in Baltimore.\n\nGROWTH OF HOMOPATHY IN PENNSYLVANIA.\n\nWhile homopathy in New York was establishing itself through its circle of enthusiastic investigators, the band of earnest physicians at the new homopathic school at Allentown were busily engaged in teaching the doctrines of similia, and it was gaining a strong foothold in Philadelphia and certain towns throughout the state. The second epoch includes the period between the establishment of Allentown Academy and the organization of the American Institute of Homopathy, in 1844.\n\nIn January, 1833, when Hering reached Philadelphia, there were but the two homopaths, Ihm and Bute, in practice there. During the year 1833 several physicians had begun to investigate. Dr. Matlack began practice about the same time as Bute. In 1833 William Schmoele, a native of Germany, came to Philadelphia and became a student and assistant of Bute's. He graduated at the Allentown Academy and established a large practice in the city, where he remained until 1844, when he returned to Germany and spent four years in studying special branches of medicine, especially pathology and morbid anatomy, under Rokitansky and other pathologists. Returning to Philadelphia, he assisted in organizing Penn Medical University in 1854. Schmoele is said to have been one of the first men in this country to advocate the germ theory of disease. After 1857 his time was in part devoted to business operations. The date of his death is unknown. In 1835 Drs. Jacob Jeanes, Gideon Humphrey and Jonas Green, three allopathic physicians, joined the homopathic ranks. Each began the investigation of homopathy on the same day.\n\nDr. Jeanes was born in Philadelphia, October 4, 1800, and died December 18. 1877. As one of the founders and faculty of the Homopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania his professional life is made the subject of extended mention in that connection, hence need not be repeated here.\n\nGideon Humphrey, the next of the three who embraced homopathy in 1835, was born at Simsbury, Conn., in the year 1776 or 1778. His parents were of the ancient family of Homfray of Normandy. At an early age he lost his father and at fourteen he left home and made his way on foot to Fort Niagara to join his brother, Major Enoch Humphrey of the army, who was stationed there, and who in later years highly distinguished himself at the battle of New Orleans. The country about the fort was almost a wilderness and the boy arrived there shoeless y and with bleeding feet. He was too young to be of service and spent the most of his time with the Indians, joining them in hunting excursions and often sleeping in the snow wrapped in his blanket. After some years of wandering life he devoted himself to the study of medicine in New York city, and graduated at Columbia College. He afterward received appointments as surgeon on board various vessels, sailing to almost every part of the world ; was once captured at Havre, France, and tried as a spy, but was acquitted. He visited the West Indies and was present during the revolution of Santo Domingo, and was instrumental in saving many of the planters from massacre. He joined the Miranda expedition in 1806, which was intended to revolutionize a portion of South America, and was appointed surgeon on the ship \"Emperor.\" They were attacked by a Spanish fleet and captured, with the exception of one or two small vessels, on one of which he escaped and returned to New York, where he commenced the practice of his profession ; but inducements were offered him to move further south and he located in Delaware county, Pa. After residing many years in Delaware county he went to Philadelphia. He soon became well known and was celebrated for his great skill and success. As age began to tax his powers, he wearied of city life and purchased a home on the confines, of Burlington, N. J., where he lived in almost total seclusion. Subsequently he went to Beverly, N. J., where he passed the rest of his life, devoting his time to reading, meditation and the cultivation of his grounds, for he was a lover of nature. He gradually became blind. He continued the practice of allopathy until 1834, when he became acquainted with Hering and was induced to investigate homopathy. He resisted for some time, but being broad and progressive in his views and an earnest seeker after truth, he was honest in his trials and at last became a convert to Hahnemann's law and adopted it in his extensive practice. He published an \"Address to the Public on the Regular Practice of Medicine\" (Burlington, 1848), and edited \"Ruoff's Repertory,\" \"Broackes on Constipation,\" and Curie's \"Domestic Homopathy.\" He died at Beverly, August 3, 1872, aged 94 years.\n\nOf Jonas Green there is but little record. He practiced allopathy in Philadelphia, and became interested in homopathy in 1835. In 1836 he published a pamphlet of 24 pages, \"A Familiar Exposition of Homopathia, or a New Mode of Curing Diseases.\" After explaining the new doctrine he says : \"For years after I first heard of homopathia, I had no knowledge of its doctrines, except that which I obtained through the distorted medium of the English medical journals. The ridicule there cast upon it by ignorant and interested writers at that time produced upon my mind, warped as it was by prejudice, a conviction of its utter worthlessness and folly. Time rolled on and the subject was forgotten only when my attention was called to it by relations of alleged cures performed by homopathic practitioners ; the cause of which I was willing to attribute to chance, to nature, to any thing rather than to homopathia. At length, however, some of my personal friends, who, I knew had long labored under severe indisposition and who had sought the aid of the most distinguished members of the faculty, not only in vain, but whose disease had been aggravated when under their treatment, had recourse to homopathia, and with benefit. An accumulation of similar facts which could be solved only by an admission of the efficacy of the new treatment left me no alternative and I determined to investigate the principles of this wonder working power. I accordingly experimented upon my own person, being then in a state of health, and found to my surprise that I was very sensibly affected by the small doses. Still doubting, however, the issue of the first experiment, I repeated it again and again with similar results. Two or three of my friends about the same time took the same article and acknowledged that they were also affected, some slightly, others more severely according to their different susceptibilities. The evidence of such facts I could no longer resist, though I had cherished in advance a strong desire to disprove the truth of the doctrine. My next step was to try the medicines upon the sick ; an opportunity soon offered, I studied the symptoms carefully, selected the remedy according to the directions of the system, and had the pleasure of witnessing a complete recovery. This was the case of a young lady who had suffered from repeated attacks of Fever and Ague, which from time to time I had removed by the use of sulphate of quinine. On this occasion, however, being the third time she had relapsed, I administered two or three doses of China, which effected a permanent cure, as more than a year has elapsed and she has had no return of the disease. The cure could not be attributed to the force of the imagination as the patient knew nothing of my plan of treatment. An equally wonderful instance of the power possessed by aconite in reducing arterial action and febrile excitement, occurred in the case of a young man of very full habit to whom I was called one evening and was informed that during the preceding night he had been restless and delirious, getting no sleep, during the day he had much heat and fever, and was becoming every moment worse pain in the head violent, pulse full and quick with great force, thirst intolerable, face flushed and much heat in the head. To this patient I furnished a dose of aconite, ordering it to be dissolved in three or four tablespoonfuls of water, one to be given every two or three hours until relieved ; after the second dose the fever subsided, the heat abated, he fell into a gentle sleep which continued till late in the morning. When I visited him next day all the unfavorable symptoms had subsided and he was about to walk out, nor did they ever return.\" Dr. Green was an original member of the American Institute of Homopathy. He practiced in Philadelphia, where he died December 25, 1868.\n\nPhoto : Charles Neidhard, M. D.\n\nIn 1836 Dr. Charles Neidhard came to Philadelphia and Dr. G. S. F. Pfeiffer settled in Germantown. Drs. Jacob Lentz, Caleb B. Matthews, George Lingen and Richard Gardiner were added to the homopathic profession in Philadelphia in the same year. Reminiscences of the professional life of Dr. Neidhard may be found in the history of the Homopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania, in which he was a conspicuous factor.\n\nOf Dr. G. S. F. Pfeiffer little is known. He removed to Philadelphia in 1837 and in 1846 was still living in that city.\n\nThere is but meagre record of Dr. George Lingen. He embraced homopathy in 1836, and about that time engaged in the sale of homopathic medicines. In 1848 he was located at Yellow Springs, Pa. Later he went south.\n\nDr. Malcolm Macfarlan says that Dr. Lingen was practicing homopathy at Mobile in 1862-63. He was a German of fine education with a taste for the arts. He died in 1868 at the age of fifty years.\n\nOf Dr. Jacob Lentz there is no record. He embraced homopathy in 1836, practiced in Philadelphia, and died in 1841. He was a member of the Homopathic Society in 1838.\n\nDr. James Kitchen, of Welsh descent, was born in Philadelphia March 8, 1800. His early education was acquired in a private school kept by, a Mr. Robinson. Later he prepared for college at a boarding school at Newtown, Pa. While there he became acquainted with Dr. William S.
