        "text": "Josephine E. “Josie” Helfrich, 99, Bismarck, died March 11, 2019, at CHI St. Alexius Health, Bismarck.\n\nPrivate family services are being held.\n\nJosie was born on the family ranch on the Cannonball River, near Breien, ND. A true ranch and cowgirl, she actually cracked her tailbone riding calves in the Breien and Timmer Rodeos. Like Annie Oakley, Josie was a sharpshooter.\n\nJosie was a substitute teacher in Breien and served as its postmistress. She moved to Bismarck and worked at Bismarck Hospital for more than 28 years and also taught Sunday School at Trinity Lutheran Church. Josie married Ellsworth LaDuke in 1939 and to their union was born Wynona. Josie later married John Helfrich in 1946 and they had Karolyn and Delwyn. They lived in Breien until 1957 when they moved to Bismarck and then Mandan. Their family were avid campers and enjoyed their cabin at Brush Lake and traveling.\n\nHer family and friends were so dear to her and she will be deeply missed.\n\nJosie is survived by her daughters, Wynona (Richard) Haakenson and Karolyn (Keith) Morris, all of Bismarck; her five grandchildren, Karen Haakenson, Laurie Albright, Nicole Turner, Mick (Tonya) Turner, Babette Jorgenson, five great-grandchildren, Courtney Bergee, Megan Albright, Tyler Taix, Jerzey Jorgenson and Madi Jorgenson; one great-great grandson, Theo Bergee; and her sister, Louise Chadwick.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, John; her son, Delwyn; and her parents, Ernie and Esther (Kent) Potter."
