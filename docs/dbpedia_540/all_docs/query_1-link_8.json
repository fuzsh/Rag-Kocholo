        "text": "ABRAHAM HAAS. Old and honorable families of Germany have given to America many citizens of exceptional worth. Crawford county, Ohio, has its share of such and Abraham Haas is one of the best known of this class in Lykens township. Mr. Haas was born near Columbiana, Columbiana county, Ohio, November 3, 1834, a son of Conrad Haas, a native of Germany, who was brought to America by his parents when he was ten years old. The family settled in Pennsylvania and thence Conrad Haas came to Ohio, locating in Columbiana county, where he married Catharine Meyer, who bore him eleven children, of whom the subject of this sketch was the second in order of nativity. John, their first born child, died at the age of sixteen years. Their daughter Lydia is the widow of Solomon Rupert. Their daughter Sarah married Philip Hogert and is dead. Their son Benjamin lives at Aurora, Illinois. Their daughter Catharine is the wife of D. Y. Ditty, of Lykens township, Crawford county, Ohio. Their son Henry lives in Holmes township, in the same county. Their daughter Elizabeth is the wife of David Faileck, of Lykens township. Their daughter Susan is the wife of John Meyers, of Lykens township.\n\nIn the spring of 1835 Conrad Haas brought his family to Crawford county, making the journey from Columbiana county with ox-teams, and settled in Lykens township, where he homesteaded one hundred and twenty acres of government land, which he developed into the farm on which the subject of this sketch now lives. At that time the land was heavily timbered and he was obliged to make a small clearing on which to erect a log cabin of round logs. He carried the work of improvement forward as rapidly as possible and became prominent in his neighborhood. He died in 1848, at the age of forty-one years. His death was most untimely, for he was a useful man in the township, where he built the first school house, helped to organize several schools and laid out roads- He was a devout member of the Baptist church and contributed liberally to all its interests. His wife died at about the age of sixty years.\n\nWhen the subject of this sketch was brought to Lykens township, he was about six months old. He was educated in the common schools and reared to farm work and by the death of his father, when he was fourteen years old, was thrown upon his own resources at a comparatively early age. For three years after his father's death the home farm was leased. Young Haas worked in the neighborhood for a year and afterwards worked near Columbiana until his mother got her family together and came back to the farm. Then, at the age of seventeen years, he took charge of the place which he has managed successfully since, except during a year and a half when he lived in Wood county. He now owns eighty acres of the old homestead, and the good house and other improvements on the place were placed there by himself. He has done general farming and has dealt extensively in horses, and during the days of horse-power threshers, he ran threshing' machines in season for many years. In politics he is a Democrat and he is not without influence in the councils of his party, but he has never sought nor accepted public office. He was married in 1857 to Miss Martha Schupp, a woman of many good qualities, who has been to him a most worthy helpmeet. The recollections of his school days include vivid memories of crude, old-fashioned schools, taught in log school houses with puncheon floors and slab seats and desks, and he has during all his active life done everything in his power to advance the cause of public education.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 812 NATHANIEL J.

Cassius and Jessie are single and live with their mother in Auburn Township. Mr. Handley died in Cranberry Township Jan. 16, 1865. He was a man of good education, and of moral and upright character. The following is a copy of the resolutions adopted by the Sandusky Literary Association, on the death of Mr. Handley.\n\n\"Resolved, That in the death of Mr. Handley, this society has lost an exemplary and influential member. As a member he was amiable, kind and courteous; he was a great humorist and a keen satirist; as a debater he excelled; as a citizen he ardently loved his country; he expended liberally in the suppression of the recent rebellion; he was the soldier's fast friend. As an individual, he was honest and obliging; he was an affectionate husband and a kind father.\"\n\nIn addition to the above, we could add that Mr. Handley was a man beloved by all who knew him, and no name could be better spoken of than that of John Handley. His family live in the little village of Mechanicsburg, where they are well known and highly respected by all who know them.\n\nSource: History of Crawford County, Ohio, Publ.

New Washington; is among the prominent farmers and self made men of this township, beginning in life a poor boy. His father dying, he was thus early in life left without a paternal friend to counsel and advise, and was thrown out upon the cold world to battle with its tempests and storms without a shilling in his pocket. His only capital was a good constitution and willing hands, which he brought into requisition, and to these he is a mainly indebted for the condition of things about him as seen to-day. He was born in Stark Co., Ohio. March 4, 1819, to Daniel and Susanna Hanes, who had twelve children. Christopher worked out by the month to get his start, working six years for Stephen Russell. His school advantages were of an exceedingly limited character. Free schools were not then in vogue. Having saved some money, he, in company with his brother John, purchased 80 acres in this township, which they held in common a few years, and, then buying John's interest, he has since added to it at different times until he now has about 400 acres, upon which are eight orchards. His farm ranks among the best in the township, and is highly productive, he raising as much grain to the acre as any of the surrounding farmers. Stock-raising is given especial attention, and his entire efforts in a business way seem to have been, in the past, crowned with market success. His wife was Julia A. Smith, who was born in 1822, in Virginia, of well-to-do parents, who, moving Wet, located in this township and bequeathed to their descendants a liberal patrimony. Eight children have crowned the Union of Mr. Jaines to Julia, his wife - George (the eldest, resides at home), Samantha (Mrs. John Martin), Elizabeth A., Frank, Susanna (Mrs. William De Roche) and Matilda are those now living. In 1875, he built a spacious brick farmhouse, 32x32, with a large observatory, and cellar under the entire building, making the finest farm residence in the township.\n\nSource: History of Crawford County, Ohio, Publ. Chicago: Baskin & Battey, Historical Publishers, 186 Dearborn Street. - 1881 - Page 1011 Chatman Twp. -\n\nJOHN HANES, farmer; P. O. Carothers; is a son of Daniel Haines, whose wife was Susanna Bordner, both of whom were natives of the \"Keystone State,\" near Reading, and emigrated to Stark Co. about the time of the Indian war, locating in Pike Township, where John was born, on Jan. 5, 1819. His father entered 40 acres of land, but died soon after. The family being poor, John's minority was spent in acquiring means to maintain them, always turning over his earnings to his mother. Soon after he became of age, he went to Huron Co., where he worked out by the year for ten successive twelve-months. Returning then to Crawford Co., he was united in wedlock to Parmelia Shade, who was born in September, 1829, in Stark Co., Ohio, daughter of Samuel Shade. Having some money, he and his brother Chris purchased 80 acres in the northeastern part of Chatfield township, which they held in partnership for about six years. He then sold out to his brother, and purchased 74½ acres of his grandfather and Uncle George Bordner, on Sec. 5, and has since added to it until he now has 120 acres, all of which he has acquired by hard toil and prudent management his farm ranking among the bet of its size. It is well tilled and everything pertaining to it proclaims the thrifty enterprise of its owner, whose resolve was, in early life, that, should Providence grant him health, he would industriously apply himself to the acquisition of a good home and a reasonable competence, which resolve he has now realized. Of seven children born to him, five are living - Rufus, of this township; Ellen, now Mrs. Isaiah Keller, of Bucyrus; Samuel, Daniel and Ida, at home. There were twelve children of the father's family, he being the sixth. His school advantages were very limited indeed. He is among the few in the township who cast their vote for Republican principles. He and his wife are members of the German Reformed Church.\n\nSource: History of Crawford County, Ohio, Publ.

Company, located in this place. He was born in Allen county, Indiana, August 23, 1852, and is of German lineage. His father, Henry Harkenrider, was a native of Germany, and after attaining man's estate was there married to Margaret Grush, who was also born in the same country. Believing that they might have better opportunities in the new world, they bade adieu to the fatherland, crossed the Atlantic and took up their abode near Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the father purchased a farm. For forty years he resided in Pleasant township, Allen county, and there died at about the age of sixty-five years. His widow still survives him, at the ripe old age of seventy-eight years, and is yet living on the old home place in Pleasant township. This worthy couple became the parents of five sons and two daughters.\n\nJohn Harkenrider, the second son and child, was reared amid the scenes of rural life, working in the fields in the summer months, while in the winter season he attended school, his time being thus occupied until he began learning the carpenter's trade at the age of eighteen years. He began business as an employe of George Holmes, of Vermilion township, Allen' county, Indiana, to whom he served an apprenticeship of three years, and afterward was employed by him as a journeyman for two years. He afterward worked for other contractors and was engaged on many buildings in Fort Wayne as an employe of Jesse Lower. In 1881 he entered the service of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as a carpenter, receiving one dollar and ninety-five cents per day for his services. He was with the corporation in Fort Wayne until 1889, when he came to Crestline as foreman of the car shops at that place, since which time he has served continuously in that capacity. His long and varied experience in the line of his chosen occupation as well as his good executive ability and capable control of the business won him the confidence of the officers of the road. He is well qualified for the duties and labors which devolve upon him, and he has control of all the carpenter work in the shops of Crestline and at times he has as many as one hundred men under his supervision.\n\nMr. Harkenrider was united in marriage to Miss Mary Shaughney, a native of Pleasant township, Allen county, Indiana. Her people were early settlers of that locality. Their marriage has been blessed with four daughters and a son, namely: Lizzie, Annie, Maggie, Loretta and Thomas. Mr. Harkenrider has taken a great interest in the education of his children, realizing the importance of good mental training as a discipline and preparation for life's work. The eldest daughter, Lizzie, having enjoyed good school privileges, is now occupying the position of bookkeeper at the Gibson House. Annie is quite a successful musician and is now engaged in teaching music, while the younger children are students in the schools of Crestline. Mr. Harkenrider himself had but limited educational privileges, his knowledge being largely acquired by study at night after working hours were over. He has also added to this by extensive reading and observation and is now a well informed man. He and his family are members of the Catholic church at Crestline, and in his political affiliations he is a Democrat. On the ticket of the party he was elected a member of the city council and is now serving in that capacity.

He was a son of Thomas Harvey, who came to the United States from Ireland at an early period in the development of our country's history. On the maternal side, our subject is also of Irish lineage.\n\nAndrew J. Harvey is one of a family of fourteen children, eleven of whom reached mature years. He was reared upon a farm and pursued his education in the common schools in a log school house. He was only fourteen years of age at the time of his father's death. The mother and her children came to Ohio in 1835 and settled in Crawford county, where Mrs. Harvey died when about sixty-seven years of age. Here our subject has since resided, and throughout his entire business career he has carried on agricultural pursuits. For about eighteen years he also operated a threshing machine and owned the second thresher ever used in the county. Until 1846 he resided in Whetstone township, but has since made his home in Bucyrus township, where he owns two hundred and eleven acres of fine land.\n\nWhen thirty-six years of age Mr. Harvey was united in marriage to Miss Maria McCracken, but she lived only a year afterward, and three years later he wedded Elizabeth Price, by whom he had six children now living, namely: Olive, Lawrence Lincoln, Minnie May, Ulysses Grant, Clay McCracken and Ida Annetta. In his political views Mr. Harvey is a stalwart Republican, but has never sought office, preferring to give his time and attention to his business affairs. In his work he has prospered, and as the years have passed, he has added continually to his income so that he is to-day the possessor of a handsome competence. He has now reached the age of eighty-four years - a venerable old gentleman, honored and esteemed by all who know him.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 111 CONRAD HASSEL, The life of a man who gives his years and his energies to evangelical, educational and charitable work is always interesting and valuable as showing men what a fellow man has done for mankind. Rev. Conrad Hassel, one of the most prominent preachers and workers in the field of Christian charity, living at Galion, Ohio, was born two miles southeast of Sharon, Mercer county, Pennsylvania, Jan. 26, 1863. When he was six years old his parents removed to a point two and a half miles southwest of Sharon, Trumbull county, Ohio, where he passed his boyhood and received his early education in the district school near his home and at a night school taught in that neighborhood in which special attention was given to arithmetic. He was instructed in the German language at his home by his parents and attended several winter terms of a German night school in Sharon, where he devoted himself to German, grammar and writing. In his boyhood he became a member and regular attendant of the Reformed church at Sharon. For a number of years he taught a class in the Sunday school of that church and was a regular attendant at another Sunday-school in that neighborhood, the sessions of which were held on Sunday afternoons. The superintendent of the Sunday-school last mentioned had a happy faculty for simple narration of the deeds and sufferings of Christ, and his presentation of the Savior's career and mission was so effective that it powerfully impressed young Hassel, who has no recollection as to when he first conceived a desire to enter the ministry of the gospel. As long ago as he can remember, he felt such a desire. Even at the age of seven, while reading the simple narratives of the Bible, he was strongly impressed by the Gospels and the Acts to preach Christ and Him crucified.\n\nAt the age of twenty young Hassel entered Calvin College at Cleveland, Ohio, where under the competent direction of the Rev. H. J. Ruetenik, D. D., LL. D., he took a full collegiate course and won a gold medal which was offered as a prize to the student taking first rank in the German language. After graduating, with the degree of B. A., he took a seminary course at Heidelberg University, Tiffin, Ohio, where he was graduated with the degree of B. D., and seven years later his alma mater conferred upon him the degree of A. M.\n\nRev. Hassel's first pastorate was composed of the Reformed church at Ashland and a country congregation near West Point, Ohio. That pastorate continued for two years and nine months, during which time the membership, especially in the county church, was greatly improved, and in many ways it was crowned with the reward of blessed work well done. Having accepted a call from the First Reformed church of Galion, Ohio, Rev. Hassel entered upon his second pastorate Apr. 1, 1891. The tenth anniversary of his connection with the Galion church was made the occasion of an interesting celebration. His church has a membership of over six hundred.\n\nIn addition to his work in the ministry Rev. Hassel has distinguished himself in connection with the Crawford County Historical Society. He began historical researches local in charter in 1893 which attracted so much attention and prompted so much interest in the matters in question that the society was duly organized May 18, 1896, with Conrad Hassel as president. In the same year a monument was erected by the society on the site of the Olentangy battle-field, where on June 6, 1782, Colonel Crawford's retreating army faced about and had a battle with the pursuing Indian warriors from Sandusky and Buttler's Rangers from Fort Detroit. Though hard pressed the Americans gained the victory. Rev. Hassel's familiarity with the opening of the Northwest Territory gave him intimate knowledge concerning its early settlement and the trials and successes of such pioneers as Boone, and his contemporaries, as well as the subsequent brave pathfinders of the wilderness. Rev. Hassel has been president of the Heidelberg Classis, president of the Central Synod, delegate to the General Synod and treasurer of the Home Mission board and is at this time president of the board just mentioned.\n\nRev. Hassel married Lydia Forwick of Vermillion, Ohio, Aug. 26, 1889, and their union was blessed with six children - three boys and three girls, named as follows: Frieda, Alma, Otto, Irene, Carl and Ira. Mrs. Hassel is a daughter of a well known minister of the Reformed church, now deceased.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 133 ALBERT HAWORTH. The life of him whose name initiates this review represents a career which is interesting and instructive. Integrity, activity and energy have been the dominant elements, while superadded to these have been manifest those sterling attributes of character, integrity, fidelity, honor and kindliness which gain to a man the confidence and good will of his fellowmen. The unostentatious routine of private life, although of vast importance to the welfare of the community, has not figured to any great extent in the pages of history, but the names of those men who have distinguished themselves by the possession of those qualities which contribute to the success of private life are most worthy of being held in high estimation. Mr. Haworth is a business man of the distinctive type - alert, broadminded and duly aggressive - is one who has a capacity for affairs of great breadth, a discriminating financier and a promoter of public good through the avenues of legitimate enterprises. His promoter of public good through the avenues of legitimate enterprises. His prominence in political circles and his position as one of the honored representative citizens of Crawford county render most consonant this review of his life.\n\nA native of the world's metropolis - London, England - Albert Haworth was born Mar. 22, 1848, and with his parents came to America when a small boy, the family locating in Providence, Rhode Island. At the time of the Civil war Benjamin Haworth, the father, enlisted in the Sixth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and remained at the front until after the stars and strips were planted in the southern confederacy. His regiment was the one that was mobbed in Baltimore while en route to Washington, a fact that aroused the country as nothing else had done and fired the loyalty of the north so that hundreds and thousands responded quickly to the president's call for aid.\n\nAt the age of twelve years Albert Haworth became a resident of Cleveland, Ohio, where he entered the service of L. G. Russell in the Depot Hotel as office boy, and there he remained until 1865, when he came with Mr. Russell to Crestine, where Mr. Russell opened the Continental Hotel. For many years Mr. Haworth was in the employ of Mr. Russell and rose steadily step by step through various positions until he became manager not only of the entire business interests of Mr. Russell but of the firm of which the latter was a member. In this connection Mr. Haworth had the control of the large business of the Continental and Gibson hotels of Crestline. At one time the firm owned the largest hotel interests in Ohio, Mr. Haworth acting as manager of the business. He was also superintendent of the dining cars of the Big Four Railroad Company, owned by L. G. Russell & Company. He also became owner of the Central Hotel of Crestline which he conducted until 1897, when he retired and enjoyed one year's rest from the arduous duties of business life. A local publication said: \"By reason of adverse circumstances, Mr. Haworth had little opportunity to attend school, but by dint of hard work over 'midnight oil' and private instructions, he has attained a thorough knowledge of the practical part of an education. Mr. Haworth has borne a leading part in social, business and political events of Crestline. If there is one thing more conspicuous than another in his make up, it is that of tireless energy, and an unrest until the task given him is completed. This element of his nature has made him indispensable to his employers, and brought him a reputation for capacity and willingness that placed him in the forefront of affairs.\"\n\nIn the year 1871 Mr. Haworth was united in marriage to Miss Magdalena McCuthin, and they now have one son and one daughter. The former, William J., is a graduate of Kenyon College, and is now a draftsman residing in Cleveland, Ohio. The daughter, Effie A., is at home with her parents. Mr. Haworth is one of the most prominent representatives of the Knights of Pythias fraternity of Crestline, and also belongs to the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks and to the Ohio Brigade, serving on the staff of General Thomas W. Minshull. In politics he has ever been a stanch Republican, unswerving in his allegiance to the party and its principles. He has labored unswerving in his allegiance to the party and its principles. He has labored unselfishly for the good of the republic without hope or desire of official reward, but in 1898 there came to him in recognition of his ability and labor the appointment to the office of postmaster of Crestline, the appointment being made by President McKinley on the 22d of March, 1898, coming to Mr. Haworth on his fiftieth birthday. While conducting the hotel business he had many times performed some service in the line of his chosen vocation for the president. The Crestline postoffice has the cleanest record of any in the state since Mr. Haworth took charge there having never been an error made by the head of the office or by one of its clerks. They dispense over one hundred and thirty thousand dollars in wages to railway and postal clerks and to others in the various departments of the business, and since our subject assumed the duties of the office no mistake has ever been registered against him. He will undoubtedly be commended for the position during President McKinley's second term as he has the confidence and highest regard of the business men and general public. He is a very popular man owing to his unfailing courtesy, genial disposition and kindly temperament, combined with unquestioned honesty and fairness in all business transactions. He certainly deserves great credit for what he has accomplished in life, which illustrates the possibilities that lie before young men in the land of the free.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 240 WILLIAM HAYS. One of the prominent and leading citizens of Galion, Ohio, who passed away during the closing decade of the last century was William Hays, who was born in Connecticut in 1820 and died at Galion in 1896.\n\nMr. Hays' early boyhood was spent in hard work, from which he could spare little time to acquire an education. His only text-books were the spelling book and that revered book, the Bible, but he read widely and diligently and while yet a very young man had the reputation of being exceptionally well informed, and his practical knowledge of business affairs enabled him, when he came to Ohio, to take a lead in matters of finance and to advise his associates ably concerning important commercial intersts.\n\nWhen Mr. Hays was about twenty-six years of age he met Mrs. Susan Black, formerly Miss Seager, of Syracuse, New York, who became his wife. Soon after his marriage he came to Wooster, Wayne county, Ohio, where he lived for a time. From Wooster he removed to Ashland county, Ohio, where he remained until 1857, and after living in Morrow county, Ohio, two years, took up his residence at Galion, in 1859, where during the remainder of his life he was prominently identified with leading business interests of different kinds. He was one of the original incorporators of the First National Bank of Galion, Ohio, established in 1864, with which important financial institution he was connected for twenty-two years. Afterward he became identified with the management of the Galion National Bank, with which he was associated until his death.\n\nMr. Hays has often been referred to as \"one of the bright stars that the New England states have given to the financial and monetary interests of the state.\" His popularity and his position as a useful and prominent member of society were well attested in a series of resolutions that were adopted by the joint meeting of the Bankers' Association, of which Hon. J. W. Coulter was chairman, in which a glowing tribute was paid to Mr. Hays, not only as a financier, but as a patriotic, public spirited man who had always had at heart the best interests of Galion.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 313 ANDREW J. HAZLETT. In the field of political life and professional activity Andrew Jackson Hazlett has won distinction and to-day is numbered among the leading, in influential and honored residents of Bucyrus. A young man, he possesses the enterprising spirit of the west and has been a dominant factor in producing the wonderful development of this section of the country. Brooking no obstacles that honest effort can overcome, he has steadily worked his way upward until he has left the ranks of the many to stand among the successful few. He is widely known as a leading journalist in this portion of Ohio and has also won public honors and recognition in the legislative halls of the state.\n\nMr. Hazlett was born in Texas township, Crawford county, November 8, 1865, and is a son of Robert Chamberlain and Elizabeth (Walter) Hazlett, and is descended from Revolutionary ancestry. The paternal grandparents of our subject were John and Nancy (Ury) Hazlett, who is 1829 came to Crawford county and purchased a farm in Texas township from a Mr. Roberts. He purchased and operated the first sawmill in that township and in connection with Mr. Bender he laid out the town of Benton, in Crawford county. He owned several hundred acres of land and was a very prominent and influential citizen, doing much to promote the progress and upbuilding of this section of the state. In 1848 he erected in Benton a hotel, which was the first building in the town, and was actively concerned in the improvement of the place, which had a good growth in the early days. He also built the first brick residence in that section of the county.\n\nThe maternal grandparents of our subject were Daniel and Susanna (Baum) Walter, who came from Pennsylvania to Ohio, locating in what was then Sycamore township, Crawford county, but is now in Wyandot county, on the present site of the village of Sycamore. The grandfather was a Dunkard preacher. Unto John and Nancy (Ury) Hazlett were born the following named: Ann, deceased wife of John Taylor, of Lafayette, Indiana; Robert, the father of our subject; Elizabeth, deceased wife of E. P. Kellog, of Todd township, Crawford county; John, who served as a justice of the peace in early days and was a prominent citizen; Mary Jane, the wife of B. F. Jaqueth, of Todd township; and William.\n\nRobert Chamberlain Hazlett, the father of our subject, was born in Washington county, Pennsylvania, in 1809, and was twenty years of age when he accompanied his parents to Crawford county. Here he became familiar with all the experiences and trials which fall to the lot of the frontier settlers. He married Miss Elizabeth Walter. She and her twin sister were the first white children born in Sycamore township, and through this marriage two of the prominent pioneer families were united. Their children are: Mrs. Susan E. Wilcox, widow of P. P. Wilcox; Mason W., who is living near Bucyrus, Ohio; W. H. and J. S., who are residents of Poplar; and Andrew J.\n\nAndrew Jackson Hazlett, whose name forms the caption of this review pursued his preliminary education in the public schools, and at the age of seventeen he became a student in Fostoria Academy, where he pursued his studies for two years. In the meantime he had engaged in teaching to some extent, a profession which he followed through twelve terms. Desiring, however, to gain more advanced knowledge he matriculated in Heidelberg University, at Tiffin, Ohio, and was graduated with the class of 1888. He was afterward superintendent of schools at Sulphur springs, Crawford county, for two years, and during that period graded the schools and largely promoted the educational interests of the town.\n\nMr. Hazlett began his newspaper career on the Daily Advertiser, at Tiffin, Ohio, and for a time was also engaged in newspaper work in Helena, Montana. Returning to his native county in 1891, he then purchased an interest in the Crawford County News, in connection with his brother, J. S. Hazlett. The paper was founded on the 14th of November, 1880, by Thomas P. Hopley, as a Prohibition organ, and when it passed into the possession of the Hazlett brothers, in October, 1891, it was changed to an independent paper. J. S. Hazlett disposed of his interest in the journal in 1892, to M. A. Charlton, and the new firm of Hazlett & Charlton equipped the plant with a large Cottrell press and gas engine, put in new body type and a good job plant. The paper was also changed from an independent to a Democratic journal and was issued semi-weekly. In 1895 Mr. Charlton disposed of his interest to H. B. Sears, who in turn sold it to L. M. Smith, the present business manager, in September, 1898.\n\nDuring all the changes the present editor, A. J. Hazlett, remained with the paper and saw it grow from a six-column folio weekly to a six-column quarto and semi-weekly. A curious fact connected with the changes in the ownership is that each of Mr. Hazlett's partners, upon leaving, disposed of his interest for double the amount he invested in the plant. During the past eight years the paper constantly grown in circulation, patronage and influence until it has outstripped all of its competitors and is now the official organ of the county, having practically all of the county patronage at full legal rates. During this time it has also added several thousand dollars' worth of material, has been compelled to move into larger quarters twice on account of increasing business, is out of debt and able to discount all of its bills.\n\nOn the 10th of June, 1890, Mr. Hazlett was united in marriage to Miss Nellie Carpenter Baker, a college classmate, having been graduated in Hidelberg College in 1888. She is a daughter of Edward and Nancy (Carpenter) Baker, and her ancestors came from Massachusetts. Her father was a sea captain, but at present is engaged in mercantile business. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Hazlett has been born a daughter, Edwina, whose birth occurred March 11, 1899. He is well known in fraternal organizations, belonging to Trinity Lodge, No. 556, F. & A. M., to the Tribe of Ben Hur, and to the Phi Kappa Psi, a college fraternity. He is also a member of the Methodist Episcopal church and has served on its board.\n\nIn politics he is an ardent advocate of the Democracy and through the columns of his paper earnestly labors to promote the interest of his party. That he is a recognized leader in its ranks is indicated by the honors that have been conferred upon him. In 1896 he was nominated on that ticket for representative in the general assembly and served for two years, retiring from the office on the 1st of January, 1900. He ha considerable influence in framing the legislation of the state during that period and gave to each question that came up for settlement his careful consideration, thus manifesting his patriotic devotion to the welfare of those whom he represents. He is also state fish and game commissioner, having been appointed to the office by Governor Bushnell and afterward by Governor Nash. He is also city school examiner and is found as a champion of every measure calculated to benefit the community.\n\nSince the foregoing sketch of Mr. Hazlett was written there was organized in October, 1901, a stock company, known as the Bucyrus Publishing Company, which company purchased and combined in one newspaper the Bucyrus News and Forum, and thereby Mr. Hazlett became disconnected with the News, and at the present writing is in editorial charge of the Findlay Courier.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 218 GEORGE W.

He came from Germany to this country in 1830. His birth occurred in the fatherland and he was the son of parents who were well-to-do and prominent people. His father served as burgomaster, an office equivalent to that of mayor in this country, and was also public administrator, in which position his duties were similar to those performed by the sheriff in the United States. Peter Helfrich acquired a good common-school education which he broadened by study at home and his appreciation of education was indicated by the liberal advantages which he afforded his children, a large family of farmer's children seldom receiving such good opportunities as he gave to his sons and daughters.\n\nEre leaving his native country, Peter Helfrich was united in marriage to Miss Margaret Burmuth, and when they came to the United States they brought with them their daughter, Margaret, then two years of age. The voyage across the Atlantic was made on a sailing vessel and consumed eighty-five days while to-day the same trip can be made in one-fourteenth of that time. Mr. Helfrich first settled in Pennsylvania and in 1835 he came with his family to Crawford county, taking up his abode in Whetstone township. Here he entered land from the government, built a house and established the Helfrich family, which, grown very numerous, celebrated a reunion on July 4, 1901.\n\nUnto Mr. and Mrs. Peter Helfrich were born the following named: Jacob, now a prominent farmer of Missouri; Nicholas C., who for thirty-three years has been a representative of the ministry of the Presbyterian church and is now located in Columbus, Ohio; Catherine, the wife of John C. Sherer; and Elizabeth. The Helfrichs, with one or two exceptions, were identified with the Lutheran church. The death of Peter Helfrich occurred in 1862, but he is still remembered and honored by those of Crawford county who knew him and yet survive.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 103 CASSIUS C. HELLER. During almost the whole of his business life Cassius C. Heller, of this biography, has been engaged in agricultural pursuits. He was born on the farm in Liberty township, Crawford county, upon which he now resides, on Apr. 5, 1857, a son of Jonathan and Susanna (Spade) Heller. His parents had a family of seven children, and six of these still survive, these being: Byron F., a carpenter and builder in Bucyrus, Ohio; Cynthia E., the wife of A. W. Tustison, of Bucyrus; Elizabeth, the wife of Philip Thoman, of Galion, Ohio; Cassius C.; William L., a farmer of Sandusky township; and Hattie M. the wife of B. F. Robison, of Bucyrus.\n\nJonathan Heller, the father of our subject, was born in Dauphin county, Pennsylvania, on Jan. 26, 1823, a son of Jacob and Elizabeth Heller, both natives of Pennsylvania. They came to Ohio when their son was but nine years old and settled on the farm now occupied by Jacob Pfeiderer, but later removed to the one now owned by Mr. Harringer, in section 33, and here the father died. When a young man he had learned the carpenter's trade and once made a walking trip back to Pennsylvania, working by the way, finally covering the four hundred miles in this way. After his marriage, on Mar. 11, 1847, he lived for some years on one of his father's farms, but later purchased the farm now owned by his son, where he died on Mar. 22, 1892. The mother of our subject was born in Portage county, Ohio, on November 18, 1830, a daughter of Jacob and Susanna (Hazel) Spade, both of them natives of Pennsylvania, who were among the early settlers of Portage county, where they located in 1842 coming to Crawford county, where they lied until the time of their death, when in advanced years. Mr. Heller was a consistent and valued member of the United Brethren church and for several years was one of the trustees. In politics he was an active Democrat and in early life efficiently filled many of the minor offices. Mr. Heller was one of the highly respected old citizens of the county who left behind him and unblemished name.\n\nOur subject grew up surrounded by excellent home influences and obtained his education in the district schools of his locality. In 1881 he was united in marriage to Miss Sarah C. Crum, the daughter of David Crum, of Sulphur Springs, whose biography is given elsewhere. For the two years following his marriage Mr. Heller farmed for his father, but in 1883 he rented what is known as the Moderwell farm, located one mile east of the home farm, and for three years successfully operated this estate. Then he removed to his father-in-law's land and there continued farming for eight years, and then came back, in 1896, to the home farm and took charge of it for his mother. In the spring of 1900 he purchased this most desirable property and now has one of the choice farms of Crawford county.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Heller two children have been born: Orpha Grace and Mary Ruth. Mr. Heller has taken a very active interest in politics, and in national affairs votes with the Democratic party, but in local affairs he votes as his judgment indicates. As an earnest and capable worker and a conscientious and worthy Christian, Mr. Heller is widely known in the United Brethren Church, having been a trustee for the past four years, and for a long period has been the efficient superintendent of the Sabbath school. He seems to possess the ability which enables him to organize, and the school connected with this church reflects great credit upon him. In al his affairs he displays an energy and thoroughness which have done much to place him in the estimation of his neighbors as one of their best representatives.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 753 JOHN C.

He was a man of good morals, and kind and considerate toward his family. His death and that of his wife are mourned by an affectionate family and a large circle of neighbors. Adam went to school in his youthful days, and when 18 years of age he was apprenticed to learn the wagon-making trade. At the end of three years, he mastered his trade, and since that time has made that his business in life, until the past ten years. He formerly owned the land on which the depot at New Washington now stands. He at present owns 80 acres of well-improved land in Auburn Township.

HILBORN is one of the successful and progressive farmers of Bucyrus township, and is also a well-known and highly respected citizen. Mr. Hilborn is a native of Crawford county, having been born in Todd township, September 9, 1863, and is a descendant on both paternal and maternal sides from pioneer settlers of this county and of Richland county. Grandfather Hilborn was one of the earliest settlers of Richland county, while Grandfather Joseph Reinhart came to Todd township, Crawford county, when it was but a wilderness. The father and mother of our subject were Samuel L. and Mary (Reinhart) Hilborn, the former of whom- was born in Richland county and the latter in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania.\n\nCharles M. Hilborn, of this biography, is the second child in a family of ten children born to his parents, and was reared on his fathers farm, where he remained until attaining his majority. His education was pursued in the common schools, and he grew to manhood a fine type of the agricultural regions of one of the best counties in the state of Ohio.\n\nAfter leaving the parental roof Mr. Hilborn spent the first summer in operating a threshing machine, and was so successful in this line that he has made that a business for every season since, three years of this time being a partner in the threshing- business. His occupation has been exclusively that of a farmer, and since 1890 he has operated a fine farm in this township, where he has become prominent in Democratic politics. During 1896-97 he was the efficient assessor of Bucyrus township, and in 1900 he was almost successful in his candidacy for trustee, having gained the confidence of the public by his excellent management of the business connected with his former office.\n\nMr. Hilborn was married in 1888 to Miss Catherine Hirtz, who was born in Holmes township, Crawford county, and he has six children living.

He is a son of Isaac and Nancy (George) Hilborn. (For a full record of Mr. Hilborn's parents and their family, see the biography of his brother.) John was raised on the farm. His education is only moderate, owing to the schools of that day being very poor as compared to what we now have. He served his country well and faithfully in the late war, enlisting in Company I, 15th O. V. I., on the 7th of September, 1861. His discharge was dated in Texas, November, 1865. He was in quite a number of engagements, and among them Corinth, Atlanta, Liberty Gap, Resaca, Buzzard's Roost and Pickett's Mills. He was also in the running fight that extended from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Atlanta, Ga. He was a brave and efficient soldier, and had many a thrilling experience in the army. At Pickett Mill he was severely wounded, and to-day is a victim of the tratorous leaders of our great civil war. At the conclusion of the war he returned home, and, on the 15th of June, 1866, he was united in marriage with Miss Emeline Clark, daughter of Martin and Nancy Clark. Mrs. Hilborn died April, 1868.

One of the most widely known and highly esteemed citizens of Liberty township, Crawford county, is William Hise, who for forty years was an eminent justice of the peace and for a period of four years the careful and efficient treasurer of Liberty township. By birth Mr. Hise is a Pennsylvanian, being born in York county, on July 25, 1818. His parents were John and Eve E. (Kunckle) Hise, both of whom were natives Pennsylvania, and the fathers of both were born in Hesse, Germany. They came to America as soldiers in the British army during the Revolutionary war and both the grandfathers participated in one engagement, but after it was over both of them deserted from the British army, joined the troops under General Washington and continued their services in the Patriot army until the close of the struggle. Many of their Hessian acquaintances who were taken prisoner at the battle of Stillwater did likewise. After the close of the war, Mr. Hise and Mr. Kunckle made their way to York county, Pennsylvania, where they settled and turned their attention to farming, literally turning their swords into ploughshares. There both lived to advanced age.\n\nThis Hise, of Revolutionary fame, reared four sons and one of them, John, became the father of our subject. He learned the trade of shoemaker, married in York county and then lived for a time in Adams county, coming to Crawford county, Ohio, in 1824. Here he entered eighty acres of land in Jefferson township, built his log cabin and established a shoe shop. His land was cleared by hired help, as he was able to earn enough by his trade to pay for having it done. Here he prospered until he removed to Bucyrus, in 1832, and to Circleville in 1836.\n\nWilliam H. Hise learned the shoe trade of his father and worked with him in Crawford county until the latter's removal. He then opened a shoe shop at Parcher's Corners in 1844. The following year, on Mar. 13, 1845, he was united in marriage to Miss Isabella Ridgely, a native of Wayne county, Ohio, who was born on July 15, 1818. She was a daughter of Wesley Ridgely, who came to Crawford county either in 1818 or 1819 and settled in Jefferson township. Later he sold his first farm and located on another two miles east of Bucyrus, and i 1844 removed to Cass county, Michigan, where he died in the following year.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hise had seven children, the six survivors being: Sarah C., the widow of Nelson Smith, of Bucyrus, Ohio; John W., of this township; Andrew H., of Carrollton, Ohio; Samuel L. of this township; Nora B., the wife of O. E. DeWitt, of Bucyrus; and Rebecca, at home... Mrs. Hise, the devoted wife and mother, passed out of life on Mar. 10, 1895.\n\nFollowing his marriage Mr. Hise removed to Liberty township and bought an acre of land upon which was a house and shop and began work at his trade, which he followed industriously and continuously until about 1887, a period of nearly forty-two years. Then he gave up work and since that time has devoted his attention to the cultivation of his farm of eighty acres, which he purchased about 1865, and removed to his property in 1876, his sons managing the farm while he continued his work at his trade, which always was pressing.\n\nMr. Hise has been very active in Democratic circles in the county and has been held in such high esteem that his selection as township treasurer met with approval from both parties. Four years of service were faithfully given, and also several years as township trustee. For forty years his decisions as justice of the peace were upheld by the superior courts and he then declined to serve longer. Although Mr. Hise has reached his eighty-third year he is a man of much younger years in appearance, rides a bicycle with pleasure and during the past year not only seeded but cultivated seven acres of courn and seven of oats by his own labor! Through this section of the county on one is better or more favorably known than William H. Hise.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 100 JOHN HOFFMANN\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 610 FRANKLIN HOLBROOK\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 372 JAMES O. HOLLAND\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 280 JESSE HOLLINSHEAD. The family of Hollinshead are representatives of those who have been leaders in thought and in action wherever their lots have been cast. The family has been ably represented in Ohio, by Richard Hollinshead and his sons, one of whom, Jesse Hollinshead, is a prominent citizen ,of Texas township, Crawford county.\n\nJesse Hollinshead was born near McConnellsville, Morgan county, Ohio, August 25, 1823, a son of Richard and Catharine (George) Hollinshead, who had five sons and three daughters and two of whose sons, Jesse arid Philip, fought gallantly for the Union cause in the Civil war, the former in Company H, One Hundred and Twenty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, the latter in the Fourteenth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry.\n\nIn 1829 Richard Hollinshead moved with his family from Morgan county, Ohio, to Seneca county, and in 1838 to Crawford county where he bought one hundred and sixty acres of land in Lykens township, of the United States government, his purchase being comprised in what was known as the Indian reserve. The land was heavily timbered and he cleared a small space in which he erected a log cabin and addressed himself bravely to the work of improving' his property; but he died at the age of fifty-two years, in 1842, only four years after his arrival there, and his wife died in 1853. When his parents located in Lykens township, the subject of this sketch was fifteen years old, and he received a scanty education in the common schools and was brought up to the hard life of a. poor boy on the frontier. He began an independent career at the age of twenty years, when he married Christina Feasel, who bore him five children. She died on the 29th of September, 1893.\n\nAmanda, eldest daughter of Jesse and Christina (Feasel) Hollinshead, married J. G. Snyder, a wagon-maker and sawmill proprietor of Benton, Ohio. Their daughters, Sarah and Catharine, and their sons, Lawson and Herman, are dead. They have only one grandchild, Jesse H. Hollinshead, son of their son Lawson.\n\nAugust 19, 1862, Mr. Hollinshead enlisted in Company H, One Hundred and Twenty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry. At Winchester, where he saw his first experience of battle, he was made a prisoner of war. After being confined two days in Libby prison he was transferred to Belle Isle prison, from which he was liberated after about thirty days on parole and went to a camp at Martinsburg, Virginia, and participated in the engagements at New Market and Snickers Gap. He fought under. General Hunter at Kerns-town and later under General Sheridan at the battle of Opecken. Still later he participated in the fighting at Fisher's Hill and Cedar Creek, and after that his regiment was transferred to the Army of the James, under command of General Grant, and for a time was stationed at Camp Holley at Deep Bottom. Mr. Hollinshead fought at Hatchers Run and participated in the movements against Petersburg and Richmond. After the fall of Richmond, as a means of preventing Lee from crossing the river the One Hundred and Twenty-third Ohio and the Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania Regiments were detailed to destroy a. bridge, and in an attempt to carry out that purpose were captured by the enemy and were prisoners with Lee at the time of the latter's surrender.\n\nAfter the war Mr. Hollinshead returned to; Ohio and took up carpenter work and for nearly forty years was successfully engaged in contracting and building. He is a Republican in politics, has been township trustee three years and is a member of Roberts Post, No. 672, Grand Army of the Republic\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 830 Bucyrus Twp. -\n\nJOHN HOLMES, Bucyrus; is a native of Holmes Co., Ohio where his birth occurred April 21, 1822. His parents Jacob and Margaret (Orr) Holmes, were sober and intelligent people, and both were natives of the Keystone State. A few years after their birth and previous to the war of 1812, they were taken by their respective parents to Harrison Co., Ohio, where they were raised and where they were subsequently married, soon after their marriage in 1821, they removed to Holmes Co., and, after remaining there about two years, left and located in Richland Co. Here they followed the not unusual occupation of farming until 1833, at which time they came to Crawford Co., locating on what is now known as the Stewart farm in Jackson Township. They were the parents of six sons and two daughters, all of whom are yet living. The mother died about a year after coming to the county, but the father is yet spared and has reached the unusual age of 95 years. The father was a soldier in the war of 1812, and served his country with distinction. He became familiar with all the details and perplexities of pioneer life, and a complete record of his eventful days would be well worthy of perusal. His son, the subject of this sketch, was reared on the farm, receiving but a limited early education. At the age of 16, he was apprenticed to a carpenter, and, after learning that trade, followed it to a greater or less extent for about fifteen years. When the last war broke out and the Government began buying horses for its cavalry, Mr. Holmes, who was good judge of horses, bought large numbers, over a range of several counties, and then sold them to the various Quartermasters of the army who were authorized to purchase. In this manner a profit of several thousand dollars was realized in a short time. After the war he kept a hotel for a short time, at Leesville, Crawford Co., and a few years later served as Superintendent of the County Infirmary. Subsequently he resided two years in Crestline, where he kept a livery stable. His thorough knowledge of \"horse flesh,\" has, to some extent, shaped his life-labors. Himself and family are at present residing in Bucyrus. He was married to Miss Mary J. Morrow Nov. 2, 1854. This lady is a native of Crawford Co., her birth occurring Aug. 24, 1834. She is the daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth (Seanor) Morrow, natives of Westmoreland Co., Penn., where they were married and resided until 1833, when they came to Crawford Co., locating in Jackson Township. They were the parents of fifteen children, and eleven are yet living. The mother died in 1872, and the father two years later. Mr. Morrow was a stone cutter and a mason and followed these occupations throughout life. A family of four children has been born to Mr. and Mrs. Holmes. Mary E. and William W. are living, and Ella Beatrice and Oliver H. are dead. \"Lizzie\" and \"Willie\" have been educated at the country schools, where their parents formerly resided at the Crestline schools, and, finally, at the fine schools in Bucyrus. They are both living with their parents at the county seat.\n\nSource: History of Crawford County, Ohio, Publ.

FRED HOSS, who owns and cultivates one hundred and twenty acres of fine land in Chatfield township, represents one of the old and honored pioneer families of the county. When the greater part of the land in this locality was still in possession of the government his grandfather, John A. Hoss, took up his abode in Crawford county. He was a native of Wurtemberg, Germany, and with his family he came to America, crossing the Atlantic in a sailing vessel, the voyage consuming weeks instead of days, as at the present time. Continuing his journey westward to Crawford county, He entered a tract of government land in Chatfield townshipthe farm upon which our subject was bornand erected a log cabin, after which he began to clear and develop his land, thus making a good home for his family. One of his children was Adam Hoss, who was born in Wurtemberg, Germany, in 1823, and was therefore a lad of ten summers at the time of the emigration of the family to the new world. He was reared here amid frontier scenes and experiences and after attaining to man's estate he married a Miss Leity, by whom he had two children, Adam and Christiana, both now deceased. After the death of the mother the father wedded Catherine Leity, and they had three children, namely: Fred; Elizabeth, the wife of Ben Green; and Lena, who married Dan Kolb. The father continued to reside on the old family homestead until called to his final rest in 1895, when seventy-two years of age, and the mother of our subject passed away the same year. They were consistent members of the Lutheran church, known and respected for their sterling worth. The .father came to the county in limited circumstances but he cleared and improved. his farm, worked industriously and with determination, and thus became well-to-do.\n\nOn the old family homestead, now occupied by Samuel Koln, P. Fred. Hoss was born, on the 4th of July, 1855, and there his youth was passed, the duties of. the school room claiming his attention in the winter months, while in. the early spring he aided in planting the crops, assisted in their cultivation. through the summer, and in the autumn performed his share in gernering the yield of the fields. He was married in 1883 but continued on the old home place until 1888, when he came to his present farm, comprising one hundred and twenty acres of the rich land of Chatfield township. The buildings, fences and other improvements upon the place were put there by him, and he carries-on general farming and stock-raising, having well tilled fields and good grades-of stock,all giving evidence of his thrift and careful supervision.\n\nIn 1883 was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Hoss and Miss Elizabeth Klink, a daughter of Christian Klink, and unto them have been born four-children, Jesse E., Eva, Jonas and Bertha. The parents belong to the Lutheran church and have many friends in the comity. Having spent his entire life in Chatfield township Mr. Hoss is deeply interested in its welfare and is a. progressive citizen.\n\nSource: A Centennial Biographical History of Crawford County, Ohio - Chicago: 1902 - Page 852"
