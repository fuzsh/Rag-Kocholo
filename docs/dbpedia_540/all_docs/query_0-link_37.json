It is surmounted by a broken mast, around which is coiled a cable, and the various implements such as harpoons, lances, and blubber spades are carved in relief around the cap stone just below the broken mast.\n\nOn the East Side is the following inscription. To commemorate: that noble enterprise: THE WHALE FISHERY: And a tribute of lasting respect: to those bold and enterprising Ship Masters: Sons of Southampton: who periled their lives: in a daring profession: And perished in actual encounter: With the Monsters of the Deep: Entombed in the Ocean They live in our memory. (Note: The inscription above is on the side opposite the carving.\n\nOn the South Side\n\nJohn E. Howell. Born March 2, 1813. Died July 23, 1840. While engaged in the Whale fishery.

Pierson: Of Bridge Hampton: Master of the Ship American: Died in the Pacific Ocean: June 4, 1846: In the 30th. year of his age\n\nThis Monument is sadly in need of care to preserve it. It should be sealed with waterproof cement where the broken Mast is set in the socket of the cap stone, as due to the filler around the mast water has gotten in and freezing during the winter months has cracked the cap stone. also the scene carved on the West side has cracked in several places, and due to the washing away of the marble, the stone is gradually softening up, and will eventually spell away.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the Howell descendants will take steps to preserve this monument, or that the Village of Sag Harbor will do so, if the Howell Family are all deceased.\n\n****End of Page 42****\n\nThe Stephen Howell Monument\n\n# 761: Stephen Howell, Sr.: A native of Southampton, L.I.
