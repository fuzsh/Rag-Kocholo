        "text": "Henry Cornelius Helfrich\n\nApril 30, 1924 ~ December 18, 2015\n\nHenry Cornelius Helfrich passed away peacefully on December 18, 2015 at the age of 91.\n\nHenry was born on April 30, 1924 at Viking, Alberta; the first born of Sjoerd C Helfrich (of Holland) & Martha Moritz (of Germany). He was preceded in death by his parents and sisters, Isabel, Annie; brothers, Stuart and John. His survivors include sister, Margaret Boraas; children, Jennie (Don) Jerke, Richard (Brenda) Helfrich, Shirley and Doreen; eight grandchildren; 11 great grandchildren.\n\nHenry left school in 1938 at the age of 14 to work on the dairy farm in Viking. At 19 years of age, Henry decided to join the army. January 13, 1943, he joined the Edmonton Barracks, did basic training in Camrose and advanced training in Calgary. He then left for overseas in June on a troop ship to Aldershot, England. Henry served in the Infantry Division of the Royal Canadian Regiment. From there he went on to North Africa and Italy. On December 25, 1943, Henry was wounded in Ortona, Italy and sent to hospital in Italy where he spent three months in recovery before being sent to fully recover in England. Returning to Canada in 1944, he left the army and returned to the dairy farm and married Millie Leysa in June, 1945.\n\nHenry started working for Northwest Utilities as a helper in 1947, then became a welder at Northwest in 1948. Henry retired from the welding trade in 1989 at the age of 65. After retirement, Henry enjoyed traveling around to auction sales and finding treasures at garage sales. He was a 70 year member with the Royal Canadian Legion Branch #86. These early experiences and struggles have resulted in Henry treasuring and appreciating everything that he has accumulated over the years. This is what made Henry hardworking, caring, helpful and generous.\n\nDonations gratefully accepted to the Wetaskiwin Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion #86 (5003-52 Avenue, Wetaskiwin, Alberta T9A 0W9)\n\nA Celebration of Henryâ€™s Life will be held in the spring of 2016.\n\nHistory and memorabilia will be displayed at the Royal Alberta Museum in Edmonton in honour of Henry Cornelius Helfrich."
