This procedure is necessitated by the difficulties of ocean transport in war. They will be buried with full military honors.\n\nNo. 2 DECEMBER 11, 1941\n\nThe Marine garrison on Wake Island has been subject to four separate attacks in the last 48 hours by enemy aircraft and one by light naval units. Despite the loss of part of the defending planes and the damage to material and personnel, the defending garrison succeeded in sinking one light cruiser and one destroyer of the enemy forces by air action. A resumption of the attack and a probable landing attempt is expected. The Marine garrison is continuing to resist. The above report is based on information received up until noon December 11.\n\nNo. 3 DECEMBER 11, 1941\n\nThe Navy Department announced that Admiral Thomas C. Hart, U. S. Navy, Commander in Chief, United States Asiatic Fleet, has reported that Navy patrol planes scored bomb hits on a Japanese battleship of the Kongo class off the coast of Luzon. The ship was badly damaged. This is the second Japanese battleship to be bombed effectively by United States forces.\n\nNo. 4 DECEMBER 12, 1941\n\nNaval forces continue to coordinate their efforts with the Army on land, sea and in the air against heavy Japanese attacks on the Island of\n\n1\n\nLuzon. There is no confirmation of the alleged occupation of Guam by the Japanese. The resistance of Wake and Midway continues. No further air activity over Hawaii has been reported. The situation in the Atlantic remains unchanged.\n\nThe above is based on reports up to noon today.\n\nNo. 5 DECEMBER 13, 1941\n\nThe Navy Department announced that it is unable to communicate with Guam either by radio or cable. The capture of the island is probable. A small force of less than 400 naval personnel and 155 marines were stationed in Guam. According to the last reports from Guam, the island had been bombed repeatedly and Japanese troops had landed at several points on the island.\n\nWake and Midway continue to resist.\n\nThe above is based on reports until 9 a. m. today.\n\nNo. 6 DECEMBER 13, 1941\n\nU. S. airmen turned back the fishing vessel Alert of U. S. registry in the Gulf of Nicoya, on the west coast of Costa Rica. The vessel was boarded on its return to port and was found to have seven Japanese in the crew. They were taken into custody. The Alert was loaded with a cargo of 10,000 gallons of Diesel oil.\n\nNo new developments have been reported from combat areas as of 3 p. m. (e. s. t.) today.\n\nNo. 7 DECEMBER 14, 1941\n\nThere have been two additional bombing attacks on Wake Island. The first was light, the second was undertaken in great force. Two enemy bombers were shot down. Damage was inconsequential.\n\nThe Marines on Wake Island continue to resist.\n\nEnemy submarines are known to be operating in the Hawaiian area. Vigorous attacks are being made against them.\n\nThe above is based on reports up until noon today.\n\n2\n\nDECEMBER 15, 1941\n\nBRIEF REPORT OF CONDUCT OF NAVAL PERSONNEL DURING JAPANESE ATTACK, PEARL HARBOR, T. H., DECEMBER 7, 1941\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy, after making a full report to the President this morning on behalf of the Navy Department, issued the following statement this afternoon concerning the air attack on the island of Oahu on Sunday, December 7:\n\nMy inspection trip to the island enables me to present the general facts covering the attack which hitherto have been unavailable.\n\n1. The essential fact is that the Japanese purpose was to knock out the United States before the war began. This was made apparent by the deception practiced, by the preparations which had gone on for many weeks before the attack, and the attacks themselves which were made simultaneously throughout the Pacific. In this purpose the Japanese failed.\n\n2. The United States services were not on the alert against the surprise air attack on Hawaii. This fact calls for a formal investigation which will be initiated immediately by the President. Further action is, of course, dependent on the facts and recommendations made by this investigating board. We are all entitled to know it if (a) there was any error of judgment which contributed to the surprise, (b) if there was any dereliction of duty prior to the attack.\n\n3. My investigation made clear that after the attack the defense by both services was conducted skillfully and bravely. The Navy lost:\n\n(a) The battleship Arizona which was destroyed by the explosion of first, its boiler and then its forward magazine due to a bomb which was said to have literally passed down through the smokestack;\n\n(b) The old target ship Utah which has not been used as a combatant ship for many years, and which was in service as a training ship for antiaircraft gunnery and experimental purposes;\n\n(c) Three destroyers, the Cassin, the Downes, and the Shaw;\n\n(d) Minelayer Oglala. This was a converted merchantman formerly a passenger ship on the Fall River Line and converted into a mine layer during the World War.\n\nThe Navy sustained damage to other vessels. This damage varied from ships which have been already repaired, and are ready for sea, or\n\n3\n\nwhich have gone to sea, to a few ships which will take from a week to several months to repair. In the last category is the older battleship Oklahoma which has capsized but can be righted and repaired. The entire balance of the Pacific Fleet with its aircraft carriers, its heavy cruisers, its lights cruisers, its destroyers, and submarines are uninjured and are all at sea seeking contact with the enemy.\n\n4. The known Japanese matériel losses were 3 submarines and 41 aircraft.\n\n5. Army losses were severe in aircraft and some hangars, but replacements have arrived or are on their way.\n\n6. The up-to-date figures of Navy killed and wounded are: officers, 91 dead and 20 wounded; enlisted men, 2,638 dead and 636 wounded.\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy told in some detail of many individual actions of outstanding courage.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"In the Navy's gravest hour of peril, the officers and men of the fleet exhibited magnificent courage and resourcefulness during the treacherous Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor. The real story of Pearl Harbor is not one of individual heroism, although there were many such cases. It lies in the splendid manner in which all hands did their job as long as they were able, not only under fire but while fighting the flames afterward and immediately starting salvage work and reorganization.\n\n\"Prompt action saved many lives and a vast amount of material. Without exception, all ships and stations rose to the emergency. Less than 4 minutes after the first alarm, guns of the fleet went into action against enemy aircraft. Seconds later the first Japanese plane was shot down.\n\n\"To a recruit seaman aboard a battleship probably goes the honor of striking the first telling blow in the fleet's defense. Even before 'general quarter' sounded, this youngster single-handedly manned a machine gun and blasted an attacking torpedo plane as it leveled against his ship.\n\n\"The dying captain of a battleship displayed the outstanding individual heroism of the day. As he emerged from the conning tower to the bridge, the better to fight his ship, his stomach was laid completely open by a shrapnel burst. He fell to the deck. Refusing to be carried to safety, he continued to direct the action. When the bridge became a blazing inferno, two officers attempted to remove him. But he ordered them to abandon him and save themselves. The latter found themselves blocked by the flames. Only the heroic efforts of a third officer enabled\n\n4\n\nthem to escape. He climbed through the fire to a higher level from which he passed one line to an adjoining battleship, and another to his trapped shipmates. By this frail means they made their way to safety.\n\n\"Entire ship's companies showed exemplary valor and coordination. Drama was thus crowded into a few seconds on board an aircraft tender moored at the naval air station, target of the enemy's fiercest bombing and strafing. With the ship already on fire from repeated high-altitude attacks, her antiaircraft batteries downed a plane which crashed in flames on deck. At this moment her captain observed the shadow of an enemy two-man submarine approaching within a few yards of the vessel. It was placed under fire. Hits were scored immediately and the submarine exposed her conning tower. At that instant a destroyer stood down channel, passed directly over the submarine, and sank it with depth charges. Doubtless saved from this craft's torpedoes, the tender then shot down a second plane, which fell on land nearby.\n\n\"Men fought with the cool confidence that comes from complete indoctrination for battle. In one case, a single bluejacket manned a 5-inch antiaircraft gun after his 10 battery mates had been shot down by a strafing attack. He would seize a shell from the fuze-pot, place it in the tray, dash to the other side of the gun, and ram it home. He would then take his position on the pointer's seat and fire. After the third such round, a terrific explosion blew him over the side of the battleship. He was rescued.\n\n\"At the several naval air stations attacked, crews dashed into the flames enveloping planes set ablaze by incendiaries, stripped off free machine guns, and with them returned the enemy's fire. In at least one instance an enemy craft was shot down.\n\n\"Two cruiser scouting seaplanes, their speed and maneuverability reduced by heavy pontoons, destroyed an attacking Japanese pursuit ship of thrice their speed.\n\n\"Simultaneously throughout the navy yard examples of personal heroism developed. Several workmen of Japanese ancestry deserted their benches to help the Marine defense battalion man machine-gun nests. Two of them with hands blistered from hot gun barrels, required emergency treatment.\n\n\"Cool as ice, the men who manned the navy yard signal tower from which flashed orders to the anchored fleet, carried out their assignment under a hail of machine-gun fire and bombs from the enemy, as well as\n\n5\n\nshrapnel from their own force's antiaircraft batteries. None left his dangerous post. First to observe the invaders through their long glasses from their high vantage point, they sent out the astounding air raid warning by visual signals. Then they settled into the complex business of transmitting the scores of orders to the ships that fought back at the attackers from their berths, or prepared to stand out to sea.\n\n\"Men from ships out of action managed at any cost to return to the battle. There were the survivors of the capsized ship who swam through blazing oil to clamber aboard other ships and join gun crews. Crews from another disabled vessel swam into mid-channel where they were hoisted aboard outward-bound destroyers. Proof that getting back into battle took precedence over their own lives was the fact that the comparative safety of the shore lay only a few yards away. Lying in a hospital bed when the first air raid alarm sounded, one officer leaped up, brushed aside nurses and ran across the navy yard to his ship. He fought with such gallantry and zeal, despite his illness, that his captain recommended him for promotion.\n\n\"There was the case of the destroyer tender which lay alongside a dock undergoing major overhaul, powerless and without armament. Unable to assume an active defense role, she concerned herself with the vital task of rescue with her available ship's boats. One Naval Reserve ensign volunteered as skipper of a motor launch. With four men he proceeded across Pearl Harbor's reverberating channel through a hail of enemy machine-gun fire and shrapnel. They saved almost 100 men from 1 battleship - men who had been injured or blown overboard into the oil-fired waters. The attack on this vessel was at its height as these rescue operations proceeded. Suddenly the launch's propeller jammed. Coolly, the ensign directed the work of disengaging the screw as flames licked around its wooden hull, meantime also supervising the picking up of more victims from the harbor. His captain cited him for 'initiative, resourcefulness, devotion to duty and personal bravery displayed'.\n\n\"Four motor-torpedo boats had been loaded aboard a fleet tanker for shipment. Their youthful ensign-captains put their power-driven turret machine guns into immediate action, accounting for at least one enemy raider plane.\n\n\"To the unsung heroes of the harbor auxiliaries must go much of the credit for helping stem the onslaught. Even the lowly garbage lighters shared the grim task. One came alongside a blazing ship which\n\n6\n\nthreatened momentarily to explode. Calmly the yardcraft's commander led fire-fighting both aboard the warship and on the surface of the harbor. He kept his tiny vessel beside the larger one for 24 hours.\n\n\"Men's will-to-fight was tremendous. One seaman had been confined to his battleship's brig for misconduct a few days earlier. When an explosion tore open the door, he dashed straight to his battle station on an antiaircraft gun. On the submarine base dock a bluejacket, carrying a heavy machine gun for which there was no mount immediately available, shot the weapon from his arms, staggering under the concussion of the rapid fire.\n\n\"Quick-thinking in the dire emergency probably saved many lives - and ships. An aviation machinist's mate aboard one ship saw that flames from the huge vessel threatened a repair ship alongside. He ran through the blaze and single-handedly slashed the lines holding the two ships together. Freed, the smaller craft drew clear. Only in the final moments, when remaining aboard appeared utterly hopeless, would men leave their ships. Then they went reluctantly. Once ashore, instead of finding some dry place to recuperate from their terrific pounding, they pitched emergency quarters as near their vessels as possible. And with portable guns they continued to fight; later they stood guard at these same camps as repair operations began on their ships, setting regular shipboard watches. Like all treacherous attacks, the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese caught certain vessels of the fleet under periodic overhaul. While in this condition of repair, such ships were not able to utilize their offensive powers to the greatest effectiveness. These ships, therefore, turned to with a will at many useful purposes. One ship rescued with its boats, hundreds of survivors thrown into the water by the force of explosions; meanwhile the surface of the water was becoming a raging inferno from burning oil. Other ships sent their repair parties to help the fighting ships keep afloat. Others sent ammunition parties to maintain the flow of powder and shells to the guns. Without doubt the whole spectacle was the greatest spontaneous exhibition of cooperation, determination, and courage that the American Navy has been called upon to make. The crew of one ship followed it around on its outside as it capsized, firing their guns until they were under water. Those same men stood on the dock and cheered as one of the more fortunate ships cleared the harbor and passed by, en route after the Japanese. Of all the accounts submitted on that memorable day, the record shows a con-\n\n7\n\ntinual demonstration of courage, bravery, and fearlessness of which the American Nation may well be proud.\"\n\nNo. 8 DECEMBER 15, 1941\n\nA Norwegian motor ship was sunk while approaching the Hawaiian Isles.

The Heron was attacked by a total of 10 four-engined flying boats and 5 twin-engined landplane bombers. Forty-six 100-pound bombs were dropped by the enemy planes and 3 torpedoes were launched at her sides. Due to very skillful handling, the ship most courageously fought against overwhelming odds, and destroyed 1 four-engined flying boat, badly damaged at least 1 other and probably more. The ship though receiving damage from one bomb that found its mark managed to reach port safely. The Commander in Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, Thomas S. Hart, in accordance with an order of the Secretary of the Navy has awarded the Navy Cross to the Commanding Officer, Lt. William Leverette Kabler, and recommended that he be advanced immediately to the rank of lieutenant commander. Further recommendations regarding other personnel will be made at a later date.\n\nIt has been ascertained from late information that the patients and staff at the Naval Hospital, Canacao, near Cavite, were evacuated to Manila prior to the occupation of that city by the enemy.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nThe merchant ship Marconi flying the Panamanian flag but reported to be of Italian ownership was captured and brought into Cristobal Canal Zone, and turned over to the courts for adjudication.\n\n15\n\nThe submarine situation in the Atlantic area and off the West Coast of the United States remains unchanged.\n\nThe Hawaiian area was quiet.\n\nNo. 25 JANUARY 8, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, on the naval situation based on reports received up to noon (e. s. t.) today:\n\nFar East.\n\nThe commanding officer of a U. S. submarine of the Asiatic Fleet has reported the sinking of an enemy transport. In addition this vessel succeeded in sinking three enemy cargo vessels, each estimated to be of 10,000 tons displacement.\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nThe defense of Wake Island by United States Marines has been cited by the President of the United States as follows:\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nWashington, January 5, 1942.\n\nCitation by\n\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nof\n\nThe Wake detachment of the First Defense Battalion, U. S. Marine Corps,\n\nunder command of Maj. James P. S. Devereux, U. S. Marines\n\nAND\n\nMarine Fighting Squadron 211 Of Marine Aircraft Group 21, Under\n\ncommand of Maj. Paul A. Putnam, U. S. Marines\n\n\"The courageous conduct of the officers and men of these units, who defended Wake Island against an overwhelming superiority of enemy air, sea, and land attacks from December 8 to 22, 1941, has been noted with admiration by their fellow countrymen and the civilized world, and will not be forgotten so long as gallantry and heroism are respected and honored. These units are commended for their devotion to duty and splendid conduct at their battle stations under most adverse conditions.\n\n16\n\nWith limited defensive means against attacks in great force, they manned their shore installations and flew their aircraft so well that five enemy warships were either sunk or severely damaged, many hostile planes shot down, and an unknown number of land troops destroyed.\"\n\nWake.\n\nAn increase of two Japanese warships-a destroyer and a gunboat-over the originally reported cruiser, submarine, and three destroyers that the Japs lost in the attack on Wake Island, was indicated in two reports to Marine Corps Headquarters, received from the Pacific area.\n\nThese reports were sent from Wake Island by a patrol plane. One, written on December 20, is from Maj. Paul A. Putnam, commanding aviation on Wake. The other is a day-by-day account of marine aviation's participation in the battle of Wake Island up to December 20 by Maj. W. Bayler.\n\nThe day-by-day record of the battle, though not an official report, is Major Bayler's account of what marine aviation and Major Devereux's men did.\n\nMajor Bayler's report has but little reference to the Marines on the isle besides the aviation group, but one brief note-\"Japs closed into 4,700 yards before 5- and 3-inch guns opened up at point blank range\"-indicates a cool courage on the part of Devereux's men that ranks with the classic it \"whites of their eyes\" line of Bunker Hill, in the opinion of ranking officers at Marine Corps Headquarters.\n\nAdded to the two Japanese destroyers which were lost in the final phase of the battle of December 22, the new information received brings Japanese losses in taking the Island of Wake up to a total of seven warships-one cruiser, four destroyers, one submarine, and one gunboat.\n\nMajor Bayler was on temporary duty in Wake in connection with the establishment of a base of operations for the Marine Corps Aviation unit. This unit, composed of 12 planes, with pilots, 49 ground personnel, arrived shortly before the outbreak of hostilities. Following is a copy of the penciled notes the major made from the records kept by him and sent to the Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet. He was present at Wake until December 20.\n\n17\n\nSYNOPSIS OF EVENTS (WAKE LOCAL TIME) DECEMBER 8-20\n\nDec. 8,\n\n7 a. m-11:58 a. m.

Dec. 19,\n\n10:30 a. m. Jap bombers hit airport and camp. Dec. 20 All quiet-first day of bad weather.\n\nTotal casualties:\n\n28 dead, 6 wounded as of Dec. 20 from VMF-211.\n\nNOTES:\n\n(1) Jap bombers of Dornier type, two-engine, twin-tail, 160 knots.\n\n(2) Attack formations always in form of line of division V's in close formation. Excellent air discipline.\n\n(3) Nine sure Jap bombers shot down; three more possibly. One four-engine boat. 1 CL, 2 DD, 1 gunboat.\n\nMajor Putnam's report of operations to his commanding officer in Pearl Harbor goes into more detail on the efforts of the tiny aviation complement to keep the planes that were left after the first attack in the air against each new attack.\n\n18\n\nOf the original aviation force of 12 officers and 49 enlisted men, 19 enlisted men and 8 officers were still on duty by December 20. Of these, 4 enlisted men and 2 officers were wounded but still on duty. One officer and 6 enlisted men were in the hospital and \"doing nicely\". The remainder, 3 officers and 24 men, were dead.\n\nThe letter relates that four planes were in the air against the Japs at the time of the first raid. The other eight were on the ground being serviced between flights, and of these seven were destroyed and one was slightly damaged. One of the planes that was in the air later taxied into debris on the field—the wreckage of the first raid—and bent its propeller.\n\nThe Marine fighters, up to December 20, had made contact with the enemy seven times, had shot down five Japs in flames, four more had \"been claimed by pilots but not verified and several are known to have been damaged. Of the four claimed one was a four-engined sea plane.\"\n\nDiscussing the surface attack of December 11, Putnam reported \"4 airplanes (Marine planes) made a total of 10 attacks, operating in a greatly overloaded condition and performing splendidly...We claim the sinking of 1 ship and serious damage to another.\" The guns of Devereux's force evidently accounted for the remainder of the ships reported destroyed in Major Bayler's synopsis. In the attack on December 11, 1 plane was lost, \"a washout on the rocky beach.\"\n\nAfter the attack on December 14, which saw two Marine planes destroyed, \"one plane on the ground by enemy action and one crashed on the take-off\" the Marines had \"only two operating airplanes, one of which gives constant trouble so that two planes in the air at one time is the exception rather than the rule.\" At one time only one serviceable plane was left to Major Putnam's squadron, but the mechanics and ground crews evidently made an additional plane, or even planes out of the wreckage of the remainder.\n\nLauding the work of the ground crews at Wake, Major Putnam wrote since that time (the first raid) parts and assemblies have been traded back and forth so that no airplane can be identified. Engines have been traded from plane to plane, have been junked, stripped, rebuilt, and all but created.\"\n\nContinuing his praise for the men under him, Major Putnam wrote \"all hands have behaved splendidly and held up in a manner of which the Marine Corps may well tell. I have no report to make regarding\n\n19\n\nany officer or man being outstanding in bravery or fortitude; they have all acquitted themselves with equal distinction. On the other hand, I particularly wish to comment on the indefatigable labor, and ingenuity, skill, and technical knowledge of Lieutenant Kinney and Technical Sergeant Hamilton. It is solely due to their efforts that the squadron is still operating.\"\n\nDiscussing the living conditions on the airdrome as they were on December 11, Major Putnam said \"Personnel are living in dugouts made by the contractor's men and equipment. Not comfortable but adequate against all but direct bomb hits. Feeding is from the contractor's galley, a truck making the rounds with hot food twice daily. Sanitation is only fair, but so far have had only a mild flurry of diarrhea. Fresh water is adequate for drinking, but salt water is used for all other purposes.\"\n\nThe tone of the entire report indicates no particular anxiety on the part of the air group at Wake. They were there under orders with a job to do. They were doing the job and would continue to do it until circumstances beyond their control forced them to discontinue their efforts. They had kept these circumstances under control for almost 2 weeks and they would continue to do so.\n\nAt no time during the siege were more than four Marine planes in operation, Putnam reported, but the verified total that these planes took of the Japanese was one ship, one submarine, and five Jap planes.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 26 JANUARY 9, 1942\n\nFar East.\n\nThe S. S. Ruth Alexander, attacked by an enemy plane in Netherlands East Indies waters has been abandoned and declared a total loss. One of the crew was killed and four were injured. The balance of the survivors are safe in a friendly port. The Ruth Alexander of the American President Lines was a vessel of 8,000 gross tons.\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nOperations continue against enemy submarines. The Hawaiian area is quiet.\n\n20\n\nEastern Pacific.\n\nCoastal defense plans have resulted in a narrowing of enemy submarine operations off the West Coast.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nA report that an enemy submarine was operating in New England waters has been thoroughly investigated. The area has been searched without tangible results. Otherwise, Atlantic operations have been without incident.\n\nNo. 27 JANUARY 11, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, on the naval situation based on reports received up to noon (e. s. t.) today:\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nThe naval station at Tutuila, Samoan Islands, was shelled shortly after midnight Sunday, January 11, Samoan time by a small enemy vessel. Fourteen shells of light caliber landed in the naval station area. The only casualties were three slight injuries to personnel.

Hart has assumed control of Allied naval forces in Far Eastern waters.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nEnemy submarine activities off the northeast coast of the United States continue.\n\nThere are no further developments to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 31 JANUARY 20, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, on the naval situation based on reports received up to noon (e. s. t.) today:\n\nFar East.\n\nA motor torpedo boat under Admiral Hart's Far Eastern Command entered Binanga Bay, inside the entrance to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, and torpedoed an unidentified enemy vessel of 5,000 tons in a night attack. This small boat carried out its difficult task while under fire of machine guns and 3 inch shore batteries. Lt. John D. Bulkeley has been commended for executing his mission successfully.\n\n22\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nEnemy submarine activity is continuing off the East Coast of North America from Cape Hatteras to Newfoundland. The sinkings of the tankers, Norness, Coimbra, and Allan Jackson have been accompanied by attacks on other vessels within the territorial limits of the United States. Strong counter measures are being taken by units of the Navy's East Coastal Command.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 32 JANUARY 24, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, on the naval situation based on reports received up to 5 p. m. (e. s. t.) today:\n\nFar East.\n\nThe Navy Department has been advised by the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, that United States' destroyers made a night attack on an enemy convoy in the Makassar Straits. Our forces made several torpedo hits and close range gun hits on destroyers and transports. The effect of the attack was that one large enemy ship was blown up; another was sunk; a third was listing heavily when last sighted, and considerable damage was inflicted upon other vessels.\n\nOur destroyers received only slight damage. Our only casualties were four men wounded, one seriously and three slightly.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nEnemy submarines are operating off the East Coast of the United States as far south as Savannah, Ga. Countermeasures against their activities are continuing with favorable results.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 33 JANUARY 25, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, on the naval situation based on reports received up to 9 p. m.

(e. s. t.) today:\n\nFar East.\n\nU. S. naval forces have scored further successes against Japanese convoys in the Makassar Strait. Heavy hits on enemy destroyers and transports have been effected. While it is still impossible to estimate total damage inflicted by our combat vessels, the known results are substantial.\n\nAdditional reports to the Navy Department of continuing action state that an American submarine has torpedoed an enemy aircraft carrier, which is believed to have sunk.\n\nDispatches also advise that another U. S. motor torpedo boat under the command of Ensign George Cox sank a 5,000-ton enemy vessel in a second torpedo boat raid close to Subic Bay.\n\nThe attack succeeded in the face of heavy fire at close range from enemy shore batteries and machine-gun fire from the Japanese ship. The motor torpedo boat penetrated the water adjacent to its objective despite net and boom defenses laid down by the enemy.\n\nParticipating in the attack with Ensign Cox were Lt. John D. Bulkeley, MTB squadron commander and Lt. (jg) Edward G. DeLong, squadron engineer.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 35 JANUARY 29, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, on the naval situation based on reports received up to 4 p. m. (e. s. t.) today:\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nTwo enemy submarines appeared off Midway Island with the intention of shelling it. They were driven away by the artillery fire of our garrison. One hit was scored on one of the attacking submarines. No damage was inflicted on the Midway Garrison and there were no injuries to personnel.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nEnemy submarines continue to operate off the East Coast of the United States and are reported as far south as Florida. Counter measures by our forces are increasingly effective.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\n24\n\nFebruary 1942\n\nNo. 25 FEBRUARY 1, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué on the naval situation based on reports received up to noon (e. s. t.) today:\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nA surprise attack has been made upon Japanese naval and air bases in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. The attack was executed by surface and air units of the United States Pacific Fleet.\n\nIn the Marshalls, bases on the Islands of Jaluit, Wotje, Kwajalein, Roi (in the Kwajalein Atoll), and Taroa (in the Maloelap Atoll) were raided.\n\nMakin Island, occupied by the Japanese since December 7, 1941, also was attacked.\n\nAdmiral Nimitz reports that while no large enemy combatant vessels were found many enemy fleet auxiliaries were sunk, beached or otherwise damaged extensively.\n\nJapanese military installations on shore were hit hard by naval aviation units and shell fire. Many enemy airplanes were destroyed both on the ground and in the air.\n\nOur naval aircraft struck the enemy positions and ships with bombs, torpedoes and guns.\n\nOur surface ships meanwhile heavily bombarded several of the enemy's key shore positions.\n\nTwo of our surface vessels received minor damage from near bomb misses.\n\nEleven American aircraft failed to return from the attack. Our total personnel losses are not yet known, but are believed to have been slight.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 25 FEBRUARY 3, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué on the naval situation based on reports up to 5 p. m. (e. s. t.) today:\n\n1. A motor torpedo boat of Admiral Hart's Far Eastern Command is believed to have torpedoed an enemy warship in night action inside Manila Bay. Although under heavy fire of the warship's guns and in the full glare of her searchlights, the motor torpedo boat managed to fire two torpedoes and to survive the action without being hit.\n\n25\n\n2. A naval battalion composed of bluejackets and marines has been organized and is fighting on Bataan Peninsula with General MacArthur's command.\n\n3. The U. S. S. Neches, a naval tanker, has been torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine. One hundred and twenty-six members of the crew have reached port safely. Fifty-six men are as yet unaccounted for.\n\nNo. 38 FEBRUARY 7, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department today issued the following communiqué, outlining the naval situation as of noon (e. s. t.) February 7, 1942:\n\nFar East.\n\nThe following new naval commands have been established to take effect immediately:\n\n1. Forces which formerly constituted the Asiatic Fleet are now known as the U. S. Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific. Vice Admiral William A. Glassford, Jr., U. S. Navy, commands these forces.\n\n2. Admiral Thomas C. Hart is Commander of the combined Naval forces in the ABDA (American-British-Dutch-Australian) Area.\n\n3.

His title is Commander Anzac Forces.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nAxis submarines continue to operate over a wide area in the Atlantic Ocean, including the coastal waters of the United States. Their attacks on Allied merchant shipping are being combated vigorously with increasing success by our forces.\n\nNo. 39 FEBRUARY 12, 1942\n\n(For release morning papers, Friday, February 13, 1942)\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nOn February 1, 1942, the Navy Department announced that units of the United States Pacific Fleet had made surprise attacks on Japanese naval and air bases in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. The results of these attacks are now available.\n\n26\n\nOn January 31, 1942, Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., in command of a well-balanced force of aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers raided the Japanese strongholds on Roi, Kwajalein, Wotje, Taroa, and Jaluit Islands of the Marshall group and Makin Island in the Gilbert group.\n\nThe results of these separate actions follow:\n\nRoi Island.\n\nOn this island of the Kwajalein Atoll a well-equipped air base was located with 12 fighter planes and several bombers. Two hangars, an ammunition dump, all fuel storage, all other storage and warehouses, a radio building, and 3 fighter planes and 6 scout bombers in the air, in addition to 1 bomber on the ground, were destroyed.\n\nKwajalein Island.\n\nAt this anchorage 10 surface ships, 5 submarines and a seaplane base were located. Our attacking forces destroyed 1 converted 17,000-ton aircraft carrier of the Yawata class, 11 fight cruiser, 1 destroyer, 3 large fleet tankers, 1 cargo vessel, 2 submarines and 2 large seaplanes. Other enemy vessels were badly damaged.\n\nOur losses in the two above attacks were four scout bombers.\n\nWotje Atoll.\n\nNo planes were found on the Wotje Atoll. There were present, however, 9 vessels of various categories in the harbor. 4 cargo vessels of about 5,000 tons each were destroyed in addition to three smaller ships. The entire shore installation consisting of two hangars, oil and gasoline stowage, shops and storehouses two antiaircraft batteries and 5 coastal guns, was completely destroyed.\n\nThere was no damage or loss to our attacking forces.\n\nTaroa Island.\n\nOn this island a new, well-equipped airfield was attacked. Two hangars, all fuel tanks, and industrial buildings were destroyed. Seven fighter planes and five scout bombers in the air, plus five fighters and six bombers on the ground were also destroyed.\n\nOur only loss in this attack was one scout bomber. In addition, a U. S. cruiser sustained a hit from one small bomb.\n\nRECAPITULATION\n\nEnemy losses from Admiral Halsey's combined attacks included 1 converted 17,000-ton aircraft carrier of the Yawata class, 1 light cruiser,\n\n27\n\n1 destroyer, 3 large fleet tankers, 2 submarines, 5 cargo vessels, and 3 smaller ships while several other ships were badly damaged.

Our aircraft attacked two enemy auxiliary vessels, badly damaging one of them.\n\nAt Makin Island, these forces destroyed two enemy patrol planes and badly damaged one auxiliary vessel. In addition, one enemy patrol plane was destroyed at sea.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL NOTE TO EDITORS\n\nThis communiqué in no way changes the 12 noon (e. w. t.) Friday, February 13, release date of the correspondents' stories filed from Honolulu.\n\nNo. 40 FEBRUARY 13, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué based on additional reports of the Marshall and Gilbert islands' action of January 31, 1942.\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nEnemy losses in the naval raid of January 31, 1942, conducted by ships and planes of the U. S. Pacific Fleet against Japanese bases in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands totaled 16 ships and 41 planes.\n\nOur losses totaled 11 scout bombers which failed to return, 4 from the Islands of Roi and Kwajalein, 1 from the Island of Taroa, and 6 from the Islands of Jaluit and Makin.\n\n28\n\nIn carrying out the raids on the several islands Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., divided his surface and air forces into self-sustaining units. Timing the arrival of each force at its destination perfectly, he was able to carry out simultaneous and highly destructive attacks on each island.\n\nRear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher, acting under orders of Admiral Halsey, led the forces which made the attacks against the Islands of Jaluit and Makin.\n\nVice Admiral Halsey has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for planning and conducting these brilliant and audacious attacks on Japanese strongholds and for driving them home with great skill and determination.\n\nCommander Miles R. Browning, Chief of Staff to Admiral Halsey, has been recommended for promotion to captain.\n\nAppropriate rewards to other officers and men may be expected later when all recommendations have been received and acted upon.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 41 FEBRUARY 19, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, outlining the naval situation as of noon (e. w. t.) February 19, 1942:\n\nFar East.\n\nA U. S. submarine has sunk a 5,000-ton cargo ship in the East China Sea.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 42 FEBRUARY 21, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, outlining the naval situation as of noon (e. w. t.) February 21, 1942:\n\nFar East.\n\nSix U. S. destroyers in company with Dutch warships attacked the Japanese landing force on the Island of Bali and sank two enemy destroyers. Our destroyers suffered only slight damage and minor loss of personnel.\n\nIn addition to the naval battalion composed of bluejackets and marines fighting with General MacArthur's command considerable equipment salvaged from Cavite and other sources of naval supply has been used to good advantage in the defense of the Bataan Peninsula.\n\n29\n\nRear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, U. S. Navy, Commandant of the Sixteenth Naval District, the senior naval officer fighting with General MacArthur, reports that this equipment consists of 3-inch and 4-inch artillery as well as boat guns and machine guns of several types, with grenades, aircraft bombs and ammunition. A large number of hand depth charges have been available.\n\nStores of gasoline, Diesel oil and lubricating oil were saved and are being used in field operations. Motor launches, tugs and facilities for repair of artillery, tanks, and trucks have been provided in addition to electrical and ordnance supplies.\n\nPersonnel of the naval air base organization who were previously employed on Government contracts have constructed and repaired airfields and roads in the fighting area. Such heavy equipment as steam shovels tractors, cranes, trucks and graders have been operated by this organization to useful advantage on Bataan and Corregidor.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 43 FEBRUARY 23, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, outlining the naval situation based on reports received up to 8 a. m. (e. w. t.), February 23, 1942:\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nThe Coast Guard Cutter Alexander Hamilton was torpedoed by an enemy submarine off Iceland. While being towed into port the ship capsized and had to be sunk by gunfire.\n\nLoss of personnel which occurred when the ship was torpedoed was moderate. Next of kin of those lost have been notified.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 44 FEBRUARY 24, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, outlining the naval situation based on reports received up to 9:30 a. m. (e. w. t.) February 24, 1942:\n\n30\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nThe U. S. S. Truxtun, a World War destroyer, and the U. S. S. Pollux, a cargo ship, ran aground in foul weather off the coast of Newfoundland and were lost.\n\nDue to the extremely difficult surf caused by the gale raging in the Atlantic and the bitterness of the winter weather loss of life was heavy on both vessels. Heroic efforts to swim lines ashore failed due to the inability to handle them when they became oil soaked.\n\nA breeches buoy was finally rigged to a ledge at sea level, but some of the survivors were washed away before they could be gotten to the top of the cliff that lined the rocky shore.\n\nThe Truxtun broke up almost immediately after grounding and soon thereafter the Pollux did likewise.\n\nThe survivors owe their rescue in large measure to the tireless, efficient and in many cases heroic action of the people of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland.\n\nThe next of kin of those lost in this tragic drama of the sea have been notified.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 45 FEBRUARY 25, 1942\n\nFar East.\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy issued the following communiqué, summarizing previously published losses inflicted by U. S. naval forces upon the Japanese Navy and Merchant Marine in the period from December 10, 1941 until February 24, 1942, inclusive. The following information is compiled from Navy Department Communiqués beginning with No. 1 and ending with No. 44, and complements similar information summarizing enemy losses and damage published in recent communiqués of the United States Army.\n\nIn accordance with its previously announced policy, the Navy does not indulge in the practice of overstating the losses that we inflict upon the enemy, or of understating the losses inflicted on us. The Navy will report only such facts as can be substantiated. Thus the tabulation of vessels damaged does not include many enemy ships thought to have been damaged, lack of conclusive evidence precluding specific announcements in these instances.\n\n31\n\nSubmarines known to be sunk include only those sunk during the heroic defense of Wake Island and during the recent raid on the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. In accordance with the established Navy Department policy submarine sinkings are never announced until it is reasonably certain that the enemy has become cognizant of their loss. This explains the time lag in connection with various reports. There is evidence, however, of further sinkings of enemy submarines in Pacific waters, but their announcement will not be made public until full reports have been made to the Navy Department and absolute surety is determined.\n\nPrior to the vicious attack made on the United Nations by the Japanese Empire on December 7, 1941, the pride of the Japanese Merchant Marine consisted of three 17,000-ton luxury ships of the Yawata class. One of these ships is known to have been converted to serve as an aircraft carrier. The United States naval forces have sunk one merchantman of the Yawata class, and one aircraft carrier of the same class, leaving only one such vessel known to be in service with the enemy.\n\nTabulation follows, by type of vessel:\n\nBattleships 1 of Kongo class damaged. Aircraft carriers 1 sunk, 1 believed sunk. Cruisers 2 sunk. Destroyers 7 sunk, 1 believed sunk. Submarines 3 sunk, 1 damaged. Seaplane tenders 1 believed sunk. Mine sweepers 1 sunk. Gunboats 1 sunk. Fleet tankers 3 sunk. Transports 13 sunk, 2 believed sunk. Supply ships and merchantmen 16 sunk. Miscellaneous (type unidentified) 6 sunk, 2 believed sunk, 3 damaged.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTotal announced losses inflicted upon the Japanese in the period outlined above are as follows:\n\nCombatant vessels 5 sunk, 3 believed sunk, 2 damaged. Noncombatant vessels 38 sunk, 4 believed sunk, 3 damaged. Total combatant and noncombatant 53 sunk, 7 believed sunk, 5 damaged.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nDuring January 1942, 22 ships of the United Nations registry had torpedoes fired at them in waters contiguous to the United States. In\n\n32\n\naddition 38 other ships were attacked in the area west of 30° west longitude. One enemy submarine is believed to have been sunk, 3 are believed to have been damaged and 34 additional attacks were inconclusive in evidence of damage.\n\nIn February, up to and including the 23d instant, 23 ships of the United Nations have been attacked by enemy submarines in U. S. coastal waters and 31 additional ships in the area west of 30° west longitude. Two enemy submarines are believed to have been sunk and 1 damaged in these areas. In addition, 15 attacks have been made on enemy submarines by our forces with inconclusive results.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 46 FEBRUARY 27, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué outlining the naval situation based on reports received up to noon (e. w. t.) February 27, 1942.\n\nFar East.\n\nThe following submarine commanders have been awarded the Navy Cross in recognition of their especially meritorious conduct during actions with the enemy:\n\nLt. Comdr. C. C. Smith, U. S. N.\n\nLt. Comdr. K. C. Hurd, U. S. N.\n\nLt. Comdr. W. L. Wright, U. S. N.\n\nLt. Comdr. M. C. Mumma, Jr., U. S. N.\n\nLt. Comdr. E. B. McKinney, U. S. N.\n\nLt. J. C.

Glassford, Jr., U. S. Navy.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 47 FEBRUARY 28, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué:\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy announced today the acceptance, effective March 1, 1942, of the application for retirement of Rear Admiral H. E.\n\n33\n\nKimmel, U. S. N., \"without condonation of any offense or prejudice to any future disciplinary action.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy announced at the same time that, based upon the findings of the report of the Roberts Commission he had directed the preparation of charges for the trial by court-martial of Rear Admiral Kimmel, alleging dereliction of duty. The Secretary of the Navy made it clear, however, that the trial upon these charges would not be held until such time as the public interest and safety would permit.\n\nNo. 48 FEBRUARY 28, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, outlining the Naval situation based on reports received up to 4 p. m. (e. w. t.), February 28, 1942:\n\nFar East.\n\nOn February 27 a major action occurred in which combined Dutch, British, Australian, and United States naval forces engaged a much larger enemy force of combatant vessels covering 40 transports attempting a landing on the north coast of Java.\n\nFrom fragmentary reports received in the Navy Department American naval forces participating in this action consisted of one heavy cruiser and five destroyers.\n\nA landing on Java by the enemy was not effected.\n\nThe Japanese heavy cruiser Mogami and three enemy destroyers were put out of action in the attempt. When last seen, enemy transports were retiring to the northward.\n\nNone of our vessels suffered heavy damage in the initial phase of this battle for Java, and our forces are still intact despite the overwhelming superiority in numbers of the enemy naval forces.\n\nFurther action can be expected from this area.\n\nReports from U. S. submarines operating in the Far East are as follows:\n\nOn February 23 two torpedo hits were effected on one large ship of the enemy.\n\nOn February 24 two torpedo hits were effected on one large enemy auxiliary vessel.\n\nOn February 25 one torpedo hit was effected on an enemy transport and one torpedo hit on a type unknown.\n\n34\n\nMarch 1942\n\nIn addition, date unknown, one of our submarines registered a torpedo hit on an enemy transport.\n\nAll of these ships of the enemy are believed sunk.\n\nNo. 49 MARCH 2, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué: Admiral Ernest J. King, U. S. Navy, Commander in Chief, United States\n\nFleet, made the following statement today:\n\n\"I have noted the widespread interest in the press about what the United States Fleets are doing. Did this interest not exist I should be deeply concerned.\n\n\"As to the activities of our fleets, the public can count with certainty upon being furnished all information which does not give aid and comfort to the enemy. The traditional title of the Navy as \"The Silent Service\" is, however, based on experience and necessity. It will have to be maintained.\n\n\"On the other hand I can say, that while no miracles are to be expected, an all-out effort is being made in the unspectacular but vitally essential task of establishing our sea and air communications.\n\n\"Appropriate measures are being taken to strengthen the key points of these communications, with a view to developing an offensive, which slowly but surely, will gain scope and power as we gain strength, through the production of aircraft, ships and guns.\n\n\"Currently, therefore, the United States Fleets are carrying on with the basic idea to 'Do more than your best with what you've got.' This means to take and make every opportunity to harass and damage the enemy, while building soundly for his ultimate defeat.\"\n\nE. J. KING.\n\nNo. 50 MARCH 3, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, outlining the naval situation based on reports received up to 10 a. m. (e. w. t.), March 3, 1942.\n\nAtlantic Area.\n\nThe U. S. S. Jacob Jones, a World War destroyer, was sunk by an enemy submarine off Cape May, N. J., just before dawn on February 28, 1942.\n\n35\n\nThere were only 11 survivors consisting of 9 engine room ratings and 2 apprentice seamen. Factual information in regard to the circumstances that led to the sinking is sparse because of the lack of deck ratings among the survivors. It has been established, however, that prior to receiving the first torpedo hit, the enemy submarine was not sighted nor was the torpedo.\n\nThe first torpedo blew up the bow and apparently killed all the personnel on the bridge as well as the men sleeping in the forward living compartments. The second torpedo, which was fired after the submarine circled ahead of the Jacob Jones, blew up the stern and all the depth charges.\n\nThe only survivors, except one man from the after engine room, were in the amidship section when the stern was blown up.\n\nThe commanding officer of the U. S. S. Jacob Jones was Lt. Comdr. H. D. Black, U. S. N.\n\nThe next of kin of those lost have been notified.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 51 MARCH 3, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, based on reports received up to 6:30 p. m. (e. w. t.), March 3, 1942.\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nIn the course of recent naval operations west of the Gilbert Islands a task force of the Pacific Fleet consisting of an aircraft carrier, cruisers and destroyers, was attacked by 18 heavy bombers of the enemy operating in 2 groups of 9 each.\n\nThese attacks occurred in the late afternoon and were timed about one-half hour apart.\n\nThe Japanese formations were closely and vigorously engaged by our carrier fighter planes and by antiaircraft fire from the ships of our task force.\n\nOnly three enemy planes of the first formation reached their bomb release point over the aircraft carrier which avoided all bomb hits by split second maneuvering.\n\nThe leading bomber of this group attempted a crash landing on the carrier and was shot down by heavy close range antiaircraft fire when barely 100 yards from its objective.\n\n36\n\nIn the second attack only five bombers of the enemy formation reached the bomb release point. In this instance the salvo of enemy bombs was closer to the carrier than in the first attack, but again no hits were obtained.\n\nSixteen of the 18 attacking enemy bombers were shot down in this action. There was no damage to our surface forces.\n\nLt. (j. g.) Edward H. O'Hare, U. S. N., fighter pilot, personally accounted for six bombers of the enemy.\n\nIn the two attacks only two of our fighter planes were lost. The pilot of one was recovered.\n\nThe next of kin of the lost pilot has been notified.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 52 MARCH 9, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué, based on reports received up to 4:30 p. m. (e. w. t.), March 9, 1942:\n\nFar East.\n\nDuring the week ending March 6, U. S. submarines operating in Far Eastern waters reported the following casualties inflicted on the naval forces of the enemy:\n\nOne destroyer leader-sunk.\n\nOne large naval tanker-sunk.\n\nShips damaged and definitely put out of action:\n\nOne aircraft carrier-2 torpedo hits.\n\nOne cruiser-1 torpedo hit.\n\nOne cruiser-1 torpedo hit.\n\nOne cruiser-2 torpedo hits.\n\nThese vessels have not been mentioned previously in any other communiqués.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 53 MARCH 12, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué based on reports received up to 4 p. m. (e. w. t.) March 12, 1942:\n\n37\n\nFar East.\n\nA U. S. submarine has sunk three enemy freighters and one passenger cargo ship in Japanese waters.\n\nThese sinkings are in addition to those reported in all previous communiqués.\n\nCentral Pacific.\n\nOn March 10th, two large Japanese four-engined seaplanes were detected west of Midway Island. They were intercepted by four of our fighter planes based on the island. One of the enemy planes was shot down. The other escaped. One of our fighters was damaged and the pilot wounded. He succeeded in returning to base safely.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 54 MARCH 14, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué based on reports received up to 12 noon (e. w. t.) March 14, 1942.\n\nFar East.\n\nJoint British Admiralty and U. S. Navy Department communiqué:\n\nAlthough full information is not yet available it is now possible to give some account of events in the Java Sea on February 27 and subsequent days during Japanese invasion of Java.\n\nOn afternoon of Friday, February 27th, an Allied Force consisting of H. M. A. S. Perth, H. M. S. Exeter, the U. S. S. Houston and Dutch cruisers De Ruyter and Java were at sea north of Sourabaya. The Allied cruisers were accompanied by a group of British, Dutch, and U. S. destroyers. This force was under the sea command of Rear Admiral Deoorman of the Dutch Navy whose flag was flying in the De Ruyter. The whole naval force in the area was under the strategic control of Vice Admiral Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy.\n\nAt 4: 14 p. m. on February 27th this Allied Force made contact with a Japanese force about halfway between Bawean Island and Sourabaya. The Japanese force consisted of at least 9 cruisers of which two were of the Nati class of 10,000 tons armed with ten 8-inch guns. The Japanese cruisers had with them 2 flotillas of destroyers.\n\nAction was joined at extreme range. Almost at once one of the Japanese destroyer flotillas launched an attack but this attack was driven off\n\n38\n\nby the fire of Allied cruisers and one of the enemy destroyers was seen to be hit by shells from H. M. A. S. Perth. Soon afterwards the other Japanese destroyer flotilla delivered a torpedo attack. While action was being taken to avoid these torpedoes H. M. S. Exeter was hit by an 8-inch shell in a boiler room. This reduced her speed and forced her to drop out of line. Only one of the torpedoes launched in this attack took effect. This hit the Netherlands destroyer Kortenaer and she sank.\n\nThree destroyers were ordered to counterattack the Japanese destroyers who were retiring under cover of a smoke screen. Very little information is available about the result of this counterattack. H. M. S. Jupiter reported seeing only two enemy destroyers both of which she engaged with gunfire. H. M. S. Electra was not seen after she had disappeared into the smoke screen and it is presumed that she was sunk. As soon as Allied cruisers, including the Houston but without the Exeter, which was unable to keep up, drew clear of smoke they again engaged the enemy, this time at shorter range. Less than half an hour later the enemy cruisers turned away under cover of a smoke screen. It was seen that one of the enemy's heavy 8-inch gun cruisers had been hit aft and was burning fiercely.\n\nAdmiral Deoorman led his force about and chased the enemy to northeastward but he failed to regain touch with the enemy in the fading light. After nightfall the Allied cruisers sighted four enemy ships to westward and engaged them but without definite knowledge of the results.\n\nAdmiral Deoorman attempted to work around these enemy ships in order to locate the convoy which was expected to the northward. This was found to be impossible owing to the high speed of the enemy, and Admiral Deoorman then turned his force to southward to approach the coast of Java intending to sweep to westward along the coast in an attempt to intercept the Japanese invasion convoys.\n\nHalf an hour after this Allied force had turned to westward along the Java coast H. M. S. Jupiter was disabled by an under-water explosion. She sank 4 hours later. H. M. S. Jupiter was not far from the mainland of Java and a number of survivors have already reached Australia. A U. S. submarine assisted in the rescue of 53 survivors.\n\nAt 11: 30 p. m. when the remaining Allied cruisers were about 12 miles north of Rembang two enemy cruisers were sighted between our ships and the coast. Our ships at once engaged and a number of hits were\n\n39\n\nsecured on the enemy. The De Ruyter was hit by one shell. Afterwards the De Ruyter made a large change of course presumably in order to avoid torpedoes fired by the enemy. The other Allied cruisers were following the De Ruyter when underwater explosions occurred simultaneously in cruisers De Ruyter and Java. Both these Dutch cruisers blew up and sank at once.\n\nIt is impossible to estimate with accuracy the damage inflicted upon the enemy during these actions of February 27th. Observers in the Perth consider that one Japanese 8-inch gun cruiser was sunk, a second 3-inch [sic] gun cruiser damaged and a destroyer sunk. It has also been reported that a cruiser of the Mogami class was set on fire and three destroyers seriously damaged and left on fire or sinking.\n\nH. M. A. S. Perth and U. S. S. Houston, which had received some damage in this action, reached Tanjong Priok at 7 o'clock the morning of Saturday, February 28th. Five U. S. destroyers reached Sourabaya after the action.\n\nWith the enemy in command of sea and air north of Java in overwhelming force the Allied command was faced with the problem of extricating the remaining Allied ships from a very dangerous situation. The way to Australia was barred by the 600-mile long Island of Java with the Straits at either end of it under enemy control.\n\nAfter dark on February 28th, H. M. A. S. Perth and U. S. S. Houston left Tanjong Priok with the intention of passing through Sunda Strait during dark hours. During the night an enemy report from H. M. A. S. Perth was received which indicated that she and U. S. S. Houston had come into contact with a force of Japanese ships off St. Nicholas Point at about 11: 30 p. m. Nothing, however, has been heard from H. M. A. S. Perth or the U. S. S. Houston since that time. The next of kin of the U. S. S. Houston are being informed accordingly.\n\nThe same night the Exeter, which was capable of only half speed, left Sourabaya accompanied by H. M. S. Encounter and the U. S. destroyer Pope. On the forenoon of Sunday March 1st the Exeter reported that she had sighted three enemy cruisers steering towards her. No further word has been received from the Exeter, Encounter or the U. S. S. Pope. The next of kin of the Pope are being informed accordingly. The Dutch destroyer Evertsen encountered two Japanese cruisers in Sunda Strait. She was damaged and was beached.\n\n40\n\nThe destroyer H. M. S. Stronghold and Sloop H. M. A. S. Yarra are also missing and are presumably lost.\n\nIt has not been possible to form any accurate estimate of damage inflicted on the enemy by these ships during these actions.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 55 MARCH 16, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué based on reports received up to 3 p. m. (e. w. t.) March i6, 1942:\n\nFar East.\n\nA U. S. submarine has sunk an enemy freighter during the course of extended operations in Japanese waters.\n\nA 3,000-ton enemy gasoline tanker also has been sunk in the Philippine area.\n\nThese sinkings are in addition to those reported in previous communiqués.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 56 MARCH 17, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nRear Admiral Adolphus Andrews has been assigned to exclusive duty as Commander Eastern Sea Frontier. The additional duties as Commandant Third Naval District which he has heretofore performed have been taken over for the present by Rear Admiral Edward J. Marquart. Rear Admiral Marquart will, in addition, retain his present duties as Commandant Navy Yard, New York.\n\nNo. 57 MARCH 18, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nFar East.\n\nCombined operations of American and Australia island-based forces were conducted recently against Japanese ships and land installations in and near Salamaua and Lae in New Guinea.\n\n41\n\nThese operations are believed to have resulted in the sinking of two enemy heavy cruisers; heavy damage to and the probable sinking of one light cruiser; damage to a fourth cruiser; the probable sinking of one destroyer; the possible sinking of two destroyers and damage to one large destroyer.\n\nFive transports or cargo ships were either sunk or gutted by fire and run aground. One heavy bomb hit was secured on each of two transports, one troop ship was damaged and left burning and three other transports were damaged.\n\nOne aircraft tender was heavily damaged and two gunboats were damaged, one of which was left burning and is believed to have sunk. One mine sweeper was left in flames and probably sank. Three seaplanes were shot down and many small boats were demolished. Considerable damage was done to enemy shore installations, aircraft runways and antiaircraft batteries.\n\nThe heavy losses inflicted on the enemy by the combined American and Australian forces were accomplished with the loss of but one plane. The U. S. submarine Shark has been overdue in the Far East for more than a month and must be presumed to be lost. The next of kin of the personnel of the Shark have been notified.\n\nDuring the month of December, the U. S. submarine Sealion which was under extensive overhaul at Cavite, was so damaged as to necessitate her demolition to prevent her use by the enemy in the event of capture.\n\nEarly this month the damaged U. S. destroyer Stewart was demolished in the drydock at Sourabaya to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy. Previous efforts to put her in serviceable condition had failed.\n\nThere were no personnel casualties in the case of the Sealion and the Stewart.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 58 MARCH 19, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nFar East.\n\nIn compliance with orders from the Navy Department, Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, U. S. N., the Commandant of the Sixteenth Naval District (Philippine Islands) has arrived in Australia. Rear Admiral\n\n42\n\nRockwell left Corregidor in General MacArthur's party which reached Australia on March seventeenth. He is now in Melbourne.\n\nWhen Japan attacked the Philippines without warning, Admiral Rockwell was in command of the Sixteenth Naval District, with his headquarters at the Navy Yard, Cavite, which is across Manila Bay from Manila. When the Naval Establishment there became no longer tenable, it was destroyed effectively. Admiral Rockwell then proceeded to Corregidor with the Naval and Marine Corps forces under his command and since then has taken part in the defense of Corregidor and the Bataan Peninsula under command of General MacArthur. His Naval and Marine Corps forces number only about one-third of the regular U. S. Army troops in that area.\n\nIt is expected that Admiral Rockwell will be assigned to an appropriate command, probably at sea.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 59 MARCH 21, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nFar East.\n\nEarly this month the U. S. gunboat Asheville was attacked by the enemy south of Java.\n\nThe Asheville has been reported missing for some days and must be presumed to be lost. The next of kin of the personnel of the Asheville have been notified.\n\nNo. 60 MARCH 23, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nFar East.\n\nU. S. submarines operating in Japanese waters have recently added the following to the list of enemy merchant vessels sunk or damaged in that area:\n\nOne 7,000-ton tanker sunk.\n\nOne 6,000-ton ship sunk.\n\nOne 5,000-ton freighter sunk.\n\nTwo 2,000-ton freighters damaged.\n\n43\n\nIn addition to these merchant ships one enemy destroyer or antisubmarine vessel was attacked and probably sunk.\n\nThe above actions have not been reported in any previous Navy Department communiqué.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 61 MARCH 24, 1942\n\nFar East.\n\nThe U. S. destroyers Pillsbury and Edsall have been reported missing since early March and must be presumed lost. The next of kin of the personnel of the Pillsbury and Edsall have been informed accordingly.\n\nThe Pillsbury is believed to have been lost in the vicinity of Bali Strait subsequent to the naval engagement in the Java Sea which was reported in communiqué No. 54.\n\nThe last report from the Edsall placed her in waters south of Java.\n\nThese destroyers were units of the original U. S. Asiatic Fleet which has been used since the beginning of the war in an attempt to frustrate the Japanese invasion of the islands of the Southwest Pacific. The ships of this fleet were fought with distinction as units of the Allied Naval Forces at Makassar Strait (communiqués Nos. 32, 33, and 34) Lombok Strait, Bali Strait (communiqué No. 42) and the Battle of the Java Sea.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 62 MARCH 25, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nVice Admiral William F. Halsey, who commanded the naval forces which so successfully raided the Marshall Islands on January 31st has delivered additional blows at two enemy outposts.\n\nFirst, on February 24th at Japanese-occupied Wake Island and second, on March 4th at Japanese-owned Marcus Island.\n\nAlthough the islands had been the scene of much recent enemy activity these surprise attacks were met with little opposition and the attacking, forces found few enemy planes and ships in the areas.\n\nConsiderable damage was done to shore installations, defense positions, aircraft runways and water tanks by combined bombardment from air-\n\n44\n\ncraft and surface vessels, following the pattern so effectively used by Admiral Halsey in his raid on the Marshall Islands.\n\nAt Wake Island, which U. S. Marines defended from December 7 until its capture on December 23, 1941, the enemy has worked feverishly to strengthen the defenses against attack. Two hundred and nineteen bombs from aircraft and many shells from cruisers and destroyers were rained on the shore installations and landing field. Two enemy patrol boats were sunk, three large seaplanes at anchor were demolished, and the aircraft runways and a part of the defense batteries were damaged. Our loss in this engagement was one aircraft.\n\nAt Marcus Island, 760 miles west-northwest of Wake, and 990 miles southeast of Yokohama, Admiral Halsey's forces executed a successful air attack just before dawn on the 4th dropping flares to illuminate objectives. No enemy aircraft or ships were present.\n\nHeavy antiaircraft fire was encountered while our planes dropped 96 bombs on the small island, resulting in considerable damage to hangars, fuel and ammunition storages, radio installations and aircraft runways.\n\nOur loss in this engagement was one aircraft.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 63 MARCH 26, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nCaribbean Area.\n\nThe U. S. Coast Guard cutter Acacia was shelled and sunk presumably by an enemy submarine, in the Caribbean area in March. The Acacia was a small unarmed ship of the tender class which was used to provide services to aids to navigation.\n\nAll personnel aboard the Acacia were rescued and there were no casualties.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 64 MARCH 27, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nAtlantic and Eastern Pacific Areas.\n\nOn March 25, General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Admiral King, Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet, with a\n\n45\n\nview to increasing the effectiveness of antisubmarine warfare along our coast, issued instructions for a closer cooperation between the naval commanders of the sea frontiers and the Army defense commanders. These instructions govern operations over the sea for the protection of shipping and for antisubmarine and other operations against enemy seaborne activities.\n\nIn accordance with these instructions, Army defense commanders have allocated Army air units to the naval commanders of the sea frontiers. Command of the air units so allocated is vested in the naval sea frontier commanders.\n\nThe cooperation between these forces and the Navy antisubmarine and patrol forces has been close and effective. In most ports the operating centers of these commands have already been combined in one room. The new system of operating control under one service will eliminate any possible uncertainty regarding jurisdictional limits and will insure the smooth and effective working of our intensified antisubmarine campaign in the waters off our coasts.\n\nUnity of command already exists for all Army and Navy forces in the Hawaiian Islands and in the Caribbean, those at Hawaii being under the Navy, those at Panama being under the Army, and those along the eastern Caribbean being under the Navy.\n\nThere is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nApril 1942\n\nNo. 65 APRIL 3, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nSouthwest Pacific.\n\n1. The United States aircraft tender Langley, the naval tanker Pecos and the destroyer Peary were sunk by the enemy in the vicinity of Northern Australia and in waters south of Java in late February an March.\n\n2 A number of survivors from these ships were rescued and reached port safely. The next of kin of all personnel lost in the Pecos have notified. The next of kin of those lost in the Langley and Peary already have been notified or will be notified as soon as information available.\n\n3. Official reports from Tokyo claimed the sinking of the Langley, least three times during the first month of the war, during which period\n\n46\n\nthe Langley was not damaged. She was sunk after a prolonged attack by the enemy south of Java in late February. Except for about a dozen men, all Langley personnel survived the attack and were transferred to the Pecos which was itself sunk a few days later.\n\n4. The Pecos, a small tanker, employed in supplying fuel to units of our fleet in the Far East, was sunk in early March.\n\n5. The Peary, a World War destroyer which received minor damage in the Japanese bombing attacks on Cavite immediately after the outbreak of the war, was sunk in the harbor at Darwin about February 19th. The Peary had participated in many of the offensive actions of our destroyers in the Far East. Observers who witnessed the last engagement of the Peary described the conduct of her crew as beyond all praise. Gun crews remained at their battle stations continuing the fire until they were forced by rising water to leave their stations. No officer or man left the ship until it sank under him. A number of survivors were later rescued.\n\n6. War conditions in the Southwest Pacific have greatly complicated and delayed reports of casualties, and the public is urged to refrain from initiating individual inquiries regarding casualties. The next of kin of all casualties are always notified by telegram as soon as possible.\n\n7. There is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 66 April 4, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nSouthwest Pacific Area.\n\n1. Recent reports indicate that the following damage has been inflicted on enemy ships by United States submarines operating in waters of the Java Sea and the Indian Ocean:\n\n(a) One light cruiser was sunk in the vicinity of Christmas Island, south of Java.\n\n(b) One light cruiser was damaged, in the vicinity of Christmas Island, by a direct torpedo hit and on the following day another direct hit was scored which is believed to have resulted in her sinking.\n\n(c) Two seaplane tenders were damaged near the island of Bali.\n\n(d) One supply ship was damaged in waters near Lombok Island.\n\n(e) In the vicinity of Bali, one barge transport and one unidentified ship were damaged by one torpedo hit each.\n\n47\n\n2. The above damage to the enemy has not been reported in any previous Navy Department communiqué.\n\n3. There is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 67 APRIL 6, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nFar East.\n\n1. A U. S. submarine has reported the sinking of an enemy freighter in Japanese waters while on extended patrol in that area.\n\nSouthwest Pacific Area.\n\n2. A U. S. submarine has reported that it sank two heavily laden Japanese tankers in waters near the Caroline Islands while on extended patrol in that area. The submarine was fired upon by one of the tankers but escaped without damage.\n\n3. These sinkings have not been reported in any previous Navy Department communiqué.\n\n4. There is nothing to report from other areas.\n\nNo. 68 April 7, 1942\n\nThe Navy Department issued the following communiqué today:\n\nChina Sea.\n\n1. Information has just been received that a U. S. submarine while on an extended patrol in the China Sea has sunk two Japanese merchant vessels.\n\n2.
