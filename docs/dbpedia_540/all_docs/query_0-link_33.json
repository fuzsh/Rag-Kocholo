Taylor]\n\nROBERT ROBERTSON - A few weeks ago the Sentinel gave an account of the gathering at the home of Mr. John Watt, who lives a short distance southwest from this city in Union Grove Township, to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of his birth. Surrounded by his family and friends the occasion was one of great pleasure, and this esteemed citizen who so honorably has walked the paths of life for nearly a century received the congratulations of all that his advanced years were so full of vigor, and that he and his aged wife were so happily surrounded and were passing their declining years in such content. The household comprised the parents and a son and daughter, who, with a loyalty pleasing to contemplate in this age when children seem to sunder home ties so easily, remained to care for their parents and conducted the farm and household duties. Far was it from the thought at the time of this anniversary that within so short a period a terrible tragedy would be enacted in this peaceful abode, which would take its fairest inmate from life and cause the greatest anguish in many hearts. Yet such is the sad fact. Our citizens were startled last Monday afternoon (Dec. 15, 1890) by the announcement of a murder and suicide which occurred at the home of Mr. Watt. At first there were many rumors but no definite facts could be learned until the representative of the Sentinel repaired to the place where the tragedy occurred. Robert Robertson, a widower of this city, had been a frequent visitor to the home of Mr. Watt during the past two years, and had been paying attention to Miss Mary Watt. His proposals for the hand of Miss Watt were refused and his attentions to her were discouraged by the lady, but he was very persistent and his calls were more frequent, and often times he offered her gifts. On Monday afternoon he again drove out to Mr. Watt's and found no one in the house but Miss Watt and her aged mother. Mr. Robertson and Miss Watt went into the bedroom off the parlor where they conversed for some time, the mother remaining in the dining room. Miss Watt was seated on a lounge, and while no one was present or heard the conversation, it is supposed that Mr. Robertson again proposed marriage and again being refused, he drew a revolver and fired, the ball penetrating her head on the left temple. She fell to the floor face downward, where she was found by her brother a few minutes afterward. Mr. Robertson seeing that his work was complete in its effect, turned the weapon upon himself, sending a bullet crashing through his brain, killing himself instantly, and falling in a sitting posture within a foot of his victim. Mrs. Watt hearing the reports of the revolver, went out and asked her son Robert, who was engaged in sawing wood, if he had heard any shots. He replied that he heard a noise and did not think any shooting had been done, but if so it was away from the house. Mrs. Watt returned to the house, rapped upon the door of the bedroom and called to her daughter, but receiving no reply, she again went and called her son and asked him to come in, informing him that she had called to her daughter, but received no response. Robert then entered the house and opened the door of the bedroom, when a terrible spectacle met his gaze. There lay his sister upon her face, the blood oozing from her temple, while Robertson was near her with his head against the bed. He picked up his sister and gently laid her upon the lounge, where she breathed a few times and her spirit fled. He then mounted a horse and quickly came to this city for the physicians. Drs. Seger and Gray drove rapidly to Mr. Watt's, but seeing that both were dead, returned to town at once. Coroner Donaldson with the following jury repaired to the place and held and inquest; Dr. A. E. Kennedy, Miles Shirk, Ed. J. Conger, R. K. Tucker, W. P. McAllister and Wm. Duffin. The verdict was in accordance with the above facts. Miss Watt was born in Scotland, July 28, 1853 and was therefore aged 37 years 4 months and 17 days. She came to this country with her parents about 20 years ago. She was of a prepossessing appearance, modest and retiring in her manner, of kind disposition and was nobly devoting her life to the care of her aged father and mother and in the household duties of the home. Her death will leave a vacancy that cannot be filled. The premeditated deed of the murderer has ended a life that was . . . she lived and will render desolate the hearts that now mourn her loss. It is sad to realize that a life so nobly performing its duties should be so suddenly terminated. Robert Robertson was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, and was between 65 and 70 years old. In 1842 came with his father, mother and brother James direct to Whiteside County and since that time resided in Mt. Pleasant Township, and lived upon his farm about one mile east of this city, until shortly before the death of his wife which occurred Dec. 4, 1887, when he removed to Morrison where he has since resided. He was in possession of a fine competency. In his business relations he was considered honorable and upright, although it is said he was of an exceedingly jealous disposition and was very arbitrary in his opinions. He was the father of 11 children, 7 of whom died about 20 years ago with scarlet fever in the short duration of two months. Two sons and two daughters survive him. He had been for many years a member of the Presbyterian Church of this city, was sedate and quiet in his manner, and no one could ever have suspected that he would commit such a terrible crime. It is but charitable to presume that he was not in his right mind when he committed the infamous deed. Those who are so sadly bowed down with grief by reason of this great calamity have the sincere sympathy of the entire community. Funeral services of Robert Robertson were held yesterday morning at his late residence in this city. Funeral services for Mary Watt occurred yesterday afternoon at two p.m. in the Presbyterian Church of this city, Rev. J. W. Skinner, officiating. The remains were interred in Grove Hill Cemetery.

ROBINSON\n\nProphetstown - Dr. Stanley E. Robinson, 81, who practiced medicine in Prophetstown for more than 50 years, died Thursday evening at Sterling Community General Hospital after a short illness. Dr Robinson set up practice in Prophetstown in September 1937 after graduating from the University of Illinois, Chicago, in 1936. He continued his practice until his death.\n\nNeil Robinson, publisher of the Prophetstown Echo, said this morning that his father worked his way through college and medical school \"by following the wheat harvest during the summers.\" When he learned of a medical practice for sale in Prophetstown, he visited, \"liked the town, and decided to stay.\" Mr Robinson described his father as \"a rock.\"\n\n\"He was always the same when people needed him, and they depended on that.\" he said. \"He never referred to himself as a great surgeon, but what other doctors said was that he was a great diagnostician. He was never the sort of doctor who went beyond his limitations.\"\n\nHe said doctors at a Sterling clinic once told him they had a joke that Dr. Robinson \"was like E.F. Hutton - when he talked, they listened.\" \"If he pronounced someone fit, then odds are they were; when he sent someone to the hospital, the other doctors were sure there was something wrong.\"\n\nDr Robinson was one of only three \"starred examiners\" for Country Companies Insurance Agency. He recently received a plaque from the company for 50 years of service.

He received a limited school education and at the age of 15 started work for the government as a mail carrier in Lancaster County. He then went to Philadelphia where he learned the art of printing. In 1846 he enlisted in the Cameron Guards, who formed a part of the Second Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. He recruited for services with the Army for the Mexican War. He was only absent from the war for a year due to illness with small pox on Lobos Islands. He was discharged in Vera Cruz in 21 April 1847 because of a hernia and given a pension. After the war he published a paper in Manheim, PA. Because of health reasons he moved to Cincinnati, OH. where he established a railroad and steamboat paper called \"The Pathfinder.\" He then moved o Paducah, KY. where he was a foreman at a printing office. The climate still was not good for his health so he moved to Marion, Williamson, IL. In 1853 he established \"The Williamson County Intelligencer,\" an ardent Democratic paper. He continued there until the war. D. Bard enlisted for three months of service. He was detailed as a printer at Cairo, IL. and at the end of that time he was discharged. He went back to publish the tax list of the county. The work was done with the windows blinded, and a guard at the door. He had placed a Union flag on a pole in front of the office, and it was taken down by the rebels, but it went back up and stayed up. His Douglas Democracy was objectionable to the southern sympathizers who hunted him at every step, and would not permit his long residence in that county. He was threatened with abuse, even the taking of his life if he didn't leave. He left his business and all he owned of value and came to Sterling because of his love of the Union. He worked here as a printer. During his residence here he printed the famous poster in which John A. Logan was advertised to speak at a meeting at which resistance to the war would be discussed. D. Rock, in his paper, fought the meeting and its objective. Mr. Logan did not show up for the meeting. D. Bard Rock assisted in organizing the Hawthorne's Battery; was sent to Springfield, where the Battery was sent, absorbed into Henshaw's Battery in 1862. He was appointed the rank of Lieutenant of colored troops and sent to Texas. He acted as Quarter Master and afterwards as Captain and used his pen in working for the Gazette reporting events. He was transferred to the V. R. C. 15 Dec 1863. He was honorably discharged from the service in 1865 and came home to Sterling. Because of his service in the Civil War, he lost his pension from the Mexican War. He was a Constable, Tax Collector and then sold goods at auctions and commissions at his business. In 1849 he married Sarah A. Hibbs, of Gloucester, N. J. They had seven children, four of whom survived him; Z. Taylor, Edwin Stanton, David Warren, and John B. Those children preceding him were Rose, Ann, and Warner. David died 16 Aug 1879 in Sterling. In September of 1940 J. W. Rock, a grandson, went through old papers of his grandfather's and found love letters to Sarah; Mexican War papers, Civil War papers, Whiteside County tax receipts, letters to him concerning the infamous \"Apportionment Bill,\" old newspaper clippings, Civil War rolls, and many more things.[Source: \"Whiteside County Genealogists\"; Civil War Veterans Cemetery Walk Sept. 26, 2015]\n\nIDA (OVERHOLSER) RODELL - A message was received here early this morning announcing the death of Mrs. Ida (Overholser) Rodell, daughter of Postmaster J.

Galon Rogers was instantly killed and Frank Braitch received a fracture of both legs below the knee this morning at 10:30 o'clock, the result of an automobile owned and driven by Frank Lee of Hume Township, skidding on the wet pavement on West Third Street in front of the residence of A. A. Wolfersperger west of Avenue G. Mr. Rogers, Mrs. Braitch and Charles Sipples were sitting in the rear seat of the auto, and when the rear end of the machine collided with the curb, the three men were thrown from the auto. Mr. Sipples received only a slight bruise on the right leg. Mr. Rogers was thrown head first out of the machine and the left side of his head struck the curb directly in front of Judge Wolfersperger's residence, and it is believed that Mr. Braitch's injuries were due to his legs striking the iron hitching post at the same place. Mr. Lee did not know that the fatal accident had occurred, or that the three men had been thrown from the auto until he had gone a block from the place where it occurred. He turned north on Avenue I from Third Street and returned to the scene of the accident. Just as he got back, Mr. Rogers breathed his last. Mr. Braitch was taken hurriedly to the Whiteside Hospital where it was found that both legs were broken. The body of Mr. Rogers was taken to the morgue at F. H. Geyer's undertaking parlors. The coroner, C. M. Frye, and State's Attorney Ludens and the chief of police were summoned immediately, and the three officers began an immediate investigation of the cause of the accident. Mr. Lee was in Rock Falls this morning and while in that city picked up Messrs. Frank Braitch, Galon Rogers, Charles Sipples and Robert Draton and gave them a ride, it being the intention of the party to make the round of the two bridges. Going west on Third Street, Mr. Lee intended to turn south on Avenue G to cross the Avenue G bridge. His speedometer, Mr. Lee says, registered between fifteen and twenty miles an hour, and he realized that it was impossible to make the turn, and he continued west, started to slow down, and proposed to turn north on Avenue H and return and cross the bridge. The sprinkling wagon had preceded him, and he had scarcely passed Avenue G when the wheels began skidding, and the next instant the auto had slid to the curb. The rear wheels struck the curb with a hard compact, the iron felloes scraping the edge off the top of the curb. As the compact was made, it jarred the rear end of the machine to such an extent that all three of the men on the rear seat were thrown out of the machine, with the above mentioned results. Mr. Lee stated that he did not feel the jar but slowed down as rapidly as possible, and of course in guiding the machine ran to the south curb before he got it under control, and he drove almost a block and a half to Avenue H before he discovered that an accident had occurred, and he did not realize the awful seriousness of it until he returned and found one of the members of his party drawing his last breath and the other in agony as a result of a fracture of both legs below the knees. Mr. Lee ordered that the wounded man be taken to the hospital and word was sent as soon as possible to the officials. After the arrival of the coroner, the body was ordered taken to F. H. Geyer's undertaking parlors in Rock Falls. Mr. Lee is a well known farmer of Hume Township and purchased the machine on June 10 last, it being an E.M.F car, thirty horse power. Mr. Lee has been considered a careful driver. When seen today, he denied a rumor that he had taken a drink of any kind, and added that he had not touched any liquor since he came into possession of the car. The impact with the curb resulted in only a light damage to the car. Three spokes in the rear wheel were splintered and the front axle was sprained. A hood over a puncture was torn off. The death of Mr. Rogers was instantaneous, the skull being fractured, the force being on the left side of the head. Auto drivers state that the speed was hardly sufficient to have caused the accident, but the speed of fifteen to twenty miles an hour over a wet pavement would easily cause the wheels to skid and the machine to become unmanageable. Galon Rogers formerly resided in Tampico, and some time ago purchased the bakery of A. Bauder in Rock Falls, which recently ceased operations, and of late has been tending bar at James Graham's saloon, residing over the saloon occupied by Mr. Graham. Frank Braitch, the wounded member of the party, also tended bar for Mr. Graham, as well as Mr. Draton, who occupied the seat with Mr. Lee. Charles Sipples resides in Tampico, but has been in this city for some time working insurance business. Coroner Frye when seen today stated that he could not tell when the inquest would be held, but it would probably be late this evening or tomorrow. The delay is due to the fact that it will be impossible to take the testimony of Frank Braitch until he recovers from the effects of the anesthetic, which was given prior to reducing the fractures. Mr. Braitch is about twenty-nine years old, is married and is a son of Fran Braitch of this city. Galon Rogers was forty five years of age, and formerly resided in Tampico. He is survived by his wife and two children. The accident was witnessed by William Appenzeller, driver for A. F. Moore's laundry. Peter Burbach, deliveryman for N. Gaulrapp, and Bert Goshert, chauffeur for E. F. Lawrence, and these gentlemen bear out the statements made by Mr. Lee, except as to the speed. Mr. Goshert states that they were going rapidly, and Mr. Burbach states that he had no way to tell how fast they were going, but was of the opinion that it must have been close to a mile a minute, and Mr. Appenzeller states that the machine was traveling very fast.\n\nJune 13, 1910, Monday, pg 5 - Galong Rogers Inquest - The Jury Rendered an Open Verdict: That He Came to His Death By Being Thrown From An Auto. The inquest over the body of Galon Rogers, who was killed by being thrown out of an auto Saturday was held in the undertaking rooms of F. H. Geyer Saturday at 4 o'clock. The family was represented by State's Attorney J. J. Ludens. A large number of witnesses were heard. The verdict of this jury was that Galon Rogers came to his death by being thrown from an automobile Saturday forenoon, June 11, driven by Frank Lee. The verdict was an open one. It censured no one, neither did it remove the blame from any one. Several of the witnesses testified that the machine was going at a fast speed, yet no one could determine just how fast it was going. Frank Lee said that he took one glass of beer in the morning. The jury was composed of the following men: John Hirschburg, foreman; Ora Bond, Delos Olds, John Britt, George Jenkins and E. E. Horner."
