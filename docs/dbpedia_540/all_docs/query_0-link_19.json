        "text": "Chapter I The Genesis of Sacred Heart Church\n\nInvoice for the first bell dated Jan 21, 1885. Bell used in first Catholic Church in Hebron\n\nJanuary 1, 1885. The engineer pulled the Burlington freight to an abrupt halt at the station in Hebron, Nebraska. The cargo shifted, the boxes and packages tumbled over each other on top of me. Because of my weight, I am on the bottom of the heap. I am a bell without a name. You can call me \"Chief\" I came here with a purpose. I have a story to be tolled.\n\nThe baggage man hopped out and started unpacking.\n\n\"Saint Louis, Missouri, January 1, 1885, To Mr. J. C. Helfrich, Hebron, Nebraska,\" he read from my crate.\n\n\"Here I am. I'll take that package!\" said J. C. Helfrich.\n\n\"You'll have to sign for it. Here's the invoice,\" the man responded. \"Read it.\"\n\n\"I'll have to have the money, sir.\"\n\n\"Of course! Of course!\" Mr. Helfrich eagerly replied, signing the receipt and fishing for the money.\n\nSoon an eager crowd was unpacking me, then admiring, then discussing how they would get me into the tower. Plans were made for my dedication with the inscription, \"Dedicated to the Mother of God, Mary,\" and at the installation ceremony there were two godfathers, M. H. Weiss and H. Y. McClosky, and two godmothers, Mrs. Nick Bethscheider and Mrs. Charles Helfrich.\n\nIt was overwhelming to witness the enthusiastic pride of these good people. And in the century that followed I was to learn to deeply love the people and the history that I came to know so well. May I share with you the beauty I discovered?\n\nIn order that you may fully appreciate your ancestry and the foundation of your parish I must tell you what I learned about the\n\nFIRST WHITE MEN WHO CROSSED NEBRASKA\n\nAs early as 1822 the migrations trekked across the state. In 1825 a cannon was wheeled across the prairies from Kansas City to about where Salt Lake City now is. About 1841 the first tourist and immigrant parties crossed the state. Those who came from the crossings at Omaha and Independence and St. Joseph crossed country from St. Joseph to just above the junction of the Blue Rivers. Here they crossed the Big Blue and followed the Little Blue, north and west. In the upper valley they cut across to the junction with the Platte Valley trails. By 1843 the first large migration of nearly one thousand people followed the road to Oregon seeking a new life in a new territory.\n\nThis travel peaked in 1850 when 55,000 pioneers made the journey. Historians estimate that from 1841 to 1866, over 350,000 people traveled the wagon trails through Nebraska, but very few stayed for long.\n\nFORT BUTLER MARKER NEAR HEBRON\n\nFort Butler was established as a likely watering place where the Little Blue was entered by a spring creek. With the good springs just above on the Blue there was always plenty of water even in the driest times. Here too was a rocky ford used by the buffalo and Indians for centuries.\n\nBEGINNING SETTLERS\n\nIt was my pleasure to learn of one man who claimed he was one of the buffalo hunters, Benedict Moeller. Some people here can still remember him as the old man who lived across northeast from the Court House in Hebron. He claimed that he and six other men killed sixty buffalo in 1866 on a hunt west of Hebron about where Guide Rock, Nebraska, now is. They loaded the hides on their wagons and hauled them back east. Benedict stayed here and worked with the soldiers at Fort Butler as an Indian Scout and Guardsman. He reported in a letter on file about the Indians stealing horses from the settlers. He was assigned to trace them. He encountered a group several miles east of the river, about where in later years the Brophys had a farm. This was just west of where the railroad bridge later crossed the river east of Hebron. Alone in this venture, he almost ran into seven Indians with the horses. He shrewdly tried avoiding them by fording the river to the south side about where the County Poor Farm was later located. He hid and waited until they moved on, then reported back to Fort Butler.\n\nBenedict settled near Meridian, where he proved up on a homestead. When the Catholic Church at Alexandria was built, he helped and stayed with that parish until he moved to Hebron. He had bought a small acreage in the northwest part of Hebron within the city limits. After Mrs. Moeller died and Benedict was getting feeble he bought a modern home just northeast from the Court House in Hebron. He hired Mrs. Ramklu as housekeeper and nurse to care for him, making her his heir because he had no children. She intended that they marry so she would have legal claim and obtained a Marriage License. However, the priest could obtain no proof of what happened to her first husband and refused to perform the marriage ceremony. Benedict refused to have a legal marriage outside the church. They kept the Marriage License. She was not satisfied with only the will. The County Judge finally agreed to perform the marriage ceremony if they would come to his office. By this time Benedict was too feeble and couldn't appear so the judge refused. In probating the will after his death the authorities thought she had fully earned what there was left and gave her all. She moved back to Beatrice with her relatives.\n\nIt was interesting to meet another man who knew this area as a virgin prairie. In August, 1922, he stopped for a few days at the Hotel Central (later Hotel Hebron.) His curiosity brought him to Ferd McKenzie's store next door to visit and find out about present conditions. He told how as a young man in the spring of 1867 he had hired out to help drive a herd of cattle west to pasture. After riding all day for several days they arrived at a turn in the river where they could cross. They unsaddled their horses and let the cattle rest and graze alone until the chuck wagon could catch up. Later with more provisions they went farther west to the pastures. There was only one shack on the east side of the river where they had several meals. They crossed the river with the cattle and passed a fort. He said that he had often wondered what had happened to that beautiful valley. At the time he recounted the story he was 80 years old and afraid that he would put off too long his desire to again see it. He was satisfied to find a bustling city and two railroads.\n\nAfter the Homestead Act was passed by Congress May 20, 1862, and the war was settled, thousands of homesteads were taken. If any in the Hebron area were Catholic this fact was never recorded. The grasshopper years nearly starved them out and most abandoned their claims to be sold by some real estate agent. These homestead rights were later bought very cheaply by future settlers. Most of these were young married couples looking for a new home and they stayed. Many years and several generations later the descendants of some of these families are still with us helping to build this great country.\n\nFirst Court House completed in Hebron April 4, 1877. This wood building burned July 27, 1900, and was replaced by the present stone structure in 1902.\n\nTHAYER COUNTY FORMED\n\nNebraska was admitted into the union as a state in 1867 and Jefferson and Thayer Counties were created out of the original Jefferson County. Hebron and Fairbury were appointed as County Seats. County Commissioners were appointed by the State Governor. They in turn appointed City Directors. In the spring of 1873 the first City Election was held electing Hendershot, Scott, Ring, Talmadge and Correll. In 1874 those elected were Hughes, Coon, Fitzpatrick, Kingsley.\n\nThe first Catholics to appear in the city affairs were in 1876, when Nick Bethscheider was elected to the Council and J. Anton Willy was issued a liquor license. J. Anton sold his saw mill to Jacob, his brother, and moved into Hebron to qualify. Nick Bethscheider was re-elected to several terms, the last in 1896.\n\nJ. Anton Willy decided to work with his first love ï¿½ music. He established a store on Lincoln Avenue in 1881 with a music machine in front which caused much controversy over its modern records.\n\nCharles Helfrich (brother-in-law of Nick Bethscheider) first moved to the new town of Alexandria, which was to be the location of a new church where Mass would be celebrated whenever Father Ferdinand Lechleitner came to this area. His visits were seldom, and Mr. Helfrich did not like this so he drove to , Kansas, trying for a better location. He found a good church and priest there but was hampered by the lack of need for a man of his trade ï¿½ a cabinet and wagon maker.\n\nFIRST MASS IN HEBRON\n\nMr. Helfrich persuaded Father John Pichler to come from Hanover, Kansas, to Hebron to say Mass in 1876. They finally received permission from Bishop James O'Connor, who had become bishop Aug. 20, 1876, to allow him to come when the people at Hebron could pay Father Pichler's expenses for the trip. Helfrich and several other families then moved into Hebron and a Mass was scheduled in 1876 in the Court House.\n\nThe first choir at Sacred Heart Church was organized by direcdtor J. Anton Willy. The group was first accompanied by wind instruments until an organ was obtained. Peter Celestine Chavet then was organist. Pictured in about 1890 (standing, l to r) are: B. Helfirch, Peter Celestine Chavet, Andrew Bethscheider, Rose Goepfrich, Emil Gregor, Josephine Klaes Stutz, , , and Mollie Helfrich. Seated are Simon Willy, George Willy, Joe Willy, J. Anton Willy, Katie Willy, Mary Willy and P. Helfrich.\n\nFIRST CHOIR\n\nJ. Anton Willy composed a Mass and trained voices to sing it, accompanied by wind instruments because they had no organ. Members of the first choir were Mrs. Charles Helfrich and Mrs. Nick Bethscheider (sisters), and the Willy brothers. They were accompanied on the clarinet by J. Anton Willy, E Flat cornet by Adolf Bethscheider, and baritone brass by Andrew Bethscheider. Later after the church was built and they obtained an organ, Peter Celestine Chavet was the organist.\n\nAs I came to know these good people, their determination totally impressed me. Their love of music was inspirational. Their enthusiasm for the establishment of their own parish was remarkable.\n\n\"TO BUILD A CHURCH\"\n\nThe first public Mass was a huge success\n\nThe businessmen of Hebron they did impress\n\nMonetary subscriptions from those around town\n\nHelped make the planned church a thing of renown\n\nMotivated with religious fervor\n\n$500 was pledged for their endeavor\n\nThey actually collected 400 of this\n\nAnd bought three lots in anticipated bliss\n\nThe South Two-thirds of Lots 7, 8, and 9\n\nBlock 6, Original Town of Hebron (mighty fine!)\n\nAcross from the depot Burlington\n\nFor $90.00 paid Frank Wetherald the deed was won\n\nRecorded March 6, Eighteen Hundred Seventy-seven\n\nAt Court House in Hebron, then set their sights on heaven\n\n22 by 32 by 14 feet high\n\nJohn Hughes, contractor, constructed by and by\n\nCottonwood lumber sawed and donated\n\nIn part by Jacob Willy from his saw mill created\n\nFinishing lumber of pine bought and hauled from Belvidere\n\nThe masonry by Mr. Raymond from round about here\n\nJ. Anton Willy much of the labor paid\n\nIt cost $700.00 and its merits were weighed\n\nFather Pichler helped with plans and specifications\n\nEncouraged the parishioners in their dedications\n\nThey were very proud of their accomplishment\n\nWhat they needed now was a pastor resident\n\nThey were not yet officially recognized\n\nStill that crude church was highly prized\n\nGrasshopper plagues in 1869 took its toll\n\nAgain in '74 and '75 diminished the church roll\n\nMany went back east as a matter of survival\n\n1876 to 1880 marked the \"good years\" arrival\n\nPASTOR OBTAINED\n\nWith the first siege of hard times behind them, the farmers began to prosper. Things began to look up when a new priest, Father Lettig, came to the diocese and the Bishop assigned him to Alexandria. The Hebron people asked him to say the first Mass in their new church. He liked the spirit here, and petitioned the Bishop to reassign him to Hebron. This the Bishop refused repeatedly, and Father Lettig left the diocese and returned to Ohio, which was his former home. This incident did, however, call attention to the Bishop the determination of the local people. He assigned Hebron to St. Stephen's as a mission, giving Hebron a legal status in the Church. Father Barth Kuppenbender attended the parish from Lawrence in 1878, 1879, and 1880, and better times prevailed.\n\nDuring the transition period the parish had lost especially the Carleton people, who were told to attend church in Alexandria. They could ride the train from Carleton to Alexandria and back on a Sunday, which took a long day away from home each week. The Schardt family decided this was impossible.\n\nAfter Mrs. Willy died the children were scattered. Some went to Turkey Creek or Geneva. Only Joe and his brother Albert remained to carry on the blacksmith shop there. Eventually they moved their shop to Hebron. Albert never married. Early in the year 1880 J. Anton Willy and Charles Helfrich, hearing that Bishop O'Connor was scheduled for Confirmation at Exeter, drove there and again petitioned him for a priest.\n\nThis time they were more successful. The first resident pastor came July 11, 1880. A new parish house was built for him near the church. Father Phillip Ehrlach was appointed by Bishop O'Connor and Alexandria and Fairbury were attached as missions. Father Ehrlach sometimes said Mass in homes around the Kansas border ï¿½ the Kelly's, McCaffery's, and once at Eatough's, when their house was blessed. Others in the Chester-Hubbell area seemed to be able to get to Hebron to church.\n\nFIRST CEMETERY\n\nNick Bethscheider had lost several members of his family. He, Charles Helfrich, and J. Anton Willy bought a much needed acre for this purpose. They later donated it to Sacred Heart Parish and it was blessed as a cemetery.\n\nADVERTISED FOR SETTLERS\n\nIn 1879 Anton Willy advertised in German Immigration papers and soon began to get results and many inquiries. Many of the German people who were suffering oppression and lack of religious freedom were willing to face the trials of an unfamiliar wilderness in another country for the chance to live in freedom. Some of the families I came to know are here recorded that you may learn to value the freedoms that are yours and to appreciate the sacrifices that were made in your behalf.\n\nFIRST CATHOLIC FAMILY RECORDED\n\nIt was my pleasure as the first bell of Sacred Heart Parish to discover some facts about our founders in the History of the State of Nebraska, 1882, Western Historical Society, Page 1453, Carleton, Nebraska. This information, together with family records and tradition, has been combined in order to bring you the best and most complete description of facts obtainable. Some of their descendants still live here, but none still bear the family name \"Willi\" or Willy.\n\nIn order that the story read more smoothly, I will take you back in the genealogy to Johann Georg Willi, born July 28, 1803, at Domat/Ems, Switzerland. He owned a flour mill and a saw mill there, married Maria Catharina Walch at Domat/Ems, Graubunden, Switzerland, and of his ten children, taught his trade to three of his sons: J. Anton Willi, John B. Willi, and Jacob Willi.\n\nJ. ANTON WILLI\n\nwas born December 23, 1836, in Domat/Ems Switzerland. He married Mary C. Yeager in 1864. They migrated to the United States in 1867. Their children were: Joseph Anton, George, Simon, (Maria) Catherine (Mrs. Joseph Wiedel), Mary (Mrs. Adam Stutz), and John, who never married. On their naturalization papers they decided to change the spelling of their name to \"Willy.\" J. Anton worked in Clinton, Iowa, until October, 1869. On his first trek to the west after getting passage to Lincoln, Nebraska, he inquired about a homestead. He actually walked the entire distance to Beatrice and then to Meridian in search of the one he would like. He found one west on the Little Blue River where there were many large cottonwood trees. The location was about one and a half miles north of the present day Friedensau Church. Since lumber was a scarce item in the west the three brothers, J. Anton, John B. and Jacob Willy decided to install a saw mill. They harnessed the river for water-power, and operated their saw mill for over eight years. Eventually a big flood damaged it beyond repair.\n\nThe Willys were the only Catholic families in this locality in 1869, when the \"Articles of Association\" for the town of Hebron, Jefferson County, were adopted. They witnessed the transition to Hebron Thayer County.\n\nThe original plot of Hebron, dated July 17, 1869, included Four Avenues: Union, Olive, Lincoln, and Jefferson. The streets were numbered from one to seven starting at the center mile in the county. The original plot included a public square (Block 4) and the Christian Meeting House (Block 80) and the Public School Lots (Block 11). All records were kept at the County Seat at Meridian, Nebraska. When the County was divided into Jefferson and Thayer, the records were sent to the County Seat of Jefferson County at Fairbury. The west half of the original County was named Thayer.\n\nJOHN B. WILLI\n\nwas born in Domat/Ems, Switzerland, on January 29, 1840. He married Anna Dora Federspiel in 1864. He learned the blacksmith trade and followed it for years before migrating to America in 1867. He was employed at the railroad yards at Clinton Iowa, until he came to Nebraska in May, 1870. He located at Kiowa in western Jefferson County, where he was a wagon maker and blacksmith shop operator. He also helped his brothers, J. Anton, and Jacob Willy, in building their lumber and saw mill on the Little Blue River about six miles west of Hebron and about the same distance from Kiowa. When the St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad was completed, it sealed the fate of Kiowa and Friedensau, leaving these communities without a railroad. John decided in 1874 to move his shop to a new town on the rails, Carleton, Nebraska, where he operated one of the leading shops in the county. On May 24, 1875, his wife, Anna Dora, died leaving three sons: Joseph Anton Willy, George A. Willy, and Albert Anton Willy.\n\nJohn B. Willy married again to Ellen Anderson in 1876 and they had four children: Henry, (John) Arthur, Clara, and Emma. They moved to Geneva, Nebraska, when George was twenty years old. As soon as the boys were old enough, they were taught their father's trade. John B. Willy and son, George, lived in Geneva the rest of their lives. Sons, Joseph and Albert, stayed in Carleton for years. In 1916 they moved their shop to Hebron, where they kept it the rest of their lives. Albert never married. Joseph, son of John B. Willy, married Emma Kriley, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Kriley in 1895. They had four children: Anna, George, Lawrence Joseph (Babe), and Marie. Anna came to Hebron to school in 1915. All four children graduated from Hebron Schools. Anna married Roy Heifer, a telephone lineman in 1919. They settled in Nebraska. George distinguished himself in athletics in school and after college became a successful coach and teacher. Babe left Hebron after school. Marie married Gene Day, son of Charles Day, a local photographer, and upon the retirement of Charles, bought the shop and operated it until failing health caused his retirement and death.\n\nJACOB WILLI\n\nwas born in Domat/Ems, Switzerland, in 1843. He migrated to the United States with his two brothers, J. Anton, and John B. Willy. He came to Nebraska with them and helped found and operate the saw mill west of , Nebraska. He married Mary Sassenrath October 13, 1879, in Thayer County. Mary Sassenrath came to Hebron, Nebraska, as a young lady from Honey Creek, Wisconsin. She came with her sister, Kate Sassenrath. They were friends of the Helfrichs, Wiedels, Bethscheiders, and Stutzs, all from the same area in Wisconsin.\n\nMary Sassenrath was a dressmaker by trade and Kate Sassenrath was a milliner by trade. Kate married M. H. Weiss, a lawyer, whom she met in Chicago, Illinois. They were married in Fairbury, Nebraska. In 1900 the Jacob Willys moved to Orleans, Nebraska, in Harlan County, along with families from the Hebron area, such as the Helfrichs, Willys, Luthers, and Morins.\n\nThe Jacob Willy and Mary (Sassenrath) Willy children were: George, Cecelia (Fischbach), Phillip, Hugo, Mary Magdelena 'Lena' (Lennemann), Amelia (Gehley), Rose, and Edward. All were born in Hebron, Nebraska, farming area, and baptized in Sacred Heart Church. Edward Willy is the only surviving child, a World War I veteran, and he lives at Venita, Okla.\n\nCecelia (Willy) Fischbach attended Catholic School in Hebron, Nebraska, when the Ursulines taught here. They taught German and English in school. Cecelia taught school in Thayer County near Byron, Nebraska, before the family moved to Harlan County, and in Harlan County before marrying George Fischbach, a native of Ohio.\n\nIn Sacred Heart Parish you will find, as I did, that the people are what made it unique. One of the gems in a long chain of jewels was Grandma Maria. My memory of her was again stirred when a story was called to my attention by W. C. Wiedel. He tells, far better than I, the story of\n\nMARIA ANNA ARMBRUST GOEPFRICH\n\nA typical Nebraska blizzard set in, shortly after the year 1919 was ushered in. Schools were shut down, country children were free to sleigh ride at will and mothers were ready to climb the wall. At our house, five miles from town, plans were formed to have Grandma Maria in town keep me for a star boarder until the roads were a bit more passable.\n\nIt is Grandma Maria we would have you meet, and perhaps love, as I learned to know and understand her. Grandma had just celebrated her 72nd birthday, and lived alone, a widow. Grandma is all stooped over with arthritis, her hands rough, crooked and gnarled. She does not speak English, her sense of humor seems nil at least to an eight-year-old boy with older brothers and younger sister. While school was reasonably acceptable to me ï¿½ who would help me with lessons if Grandma couldn't read or write?\n\nï¿½I was to get to know her much better in the next months, and in the next ten years before she died in 1929. As a matter of fact, for 20 or more years after her death, I studied her life and each year learned to admire and respect her more. Perhaps you too will love her.\n\nMaria Anna Armbrust was born Jan. 21, 1847, in Hamburg, Germany, of middle-class parents and married in 1867 to John Kasimir Goepfrich. Shortly after the wedding, they migrated to America, to Newark, N.J. A new life and a new hope, with a promise of better things to come . . . Her life, however was not to be smooth.\n\nTo understand Grandma, we must go back 100 years, study the mode of transportation, communication, as well as lack of social pressures. On board ship, John and Maria contracted smallpox, were quarantined upon arrival at the coastal port in a \"pest house.\" The effects of this were discouragement and extreme loneliness.\n\nMaria was now pregnant, and they decided to return to the land of their birth. They had changed, but Germany and their friends had changed too and now they were not accepted. Baby Catherine had arrived, and before long Maria was again pregnant. Their decision was to return to America, after their son Frank was born Sept. 4. 1874.\n\nUpon arriving in New Jersey, they encountered famine, unemployment and drought. Their best prospect seemed to be in the new frontier of Western America. Their resources had dwindled considerably. Also, a new baby girl, Rose Ursula, was born at Newark, N.J. John and Maria with their three small children were now boarding the train to go west. Hebron, Nebraska, seemed like a friendly town and here it was they settled. These industrious German emigrants soon became part of this new community and its people. A new home was begun and John worked as a carpenter, surveyor and city employee. The hours were long and hard, perhaps too long ï¿½ he was working against time.\n\nIn August of 1878, the father, John contacted \"typhoid fever\" and he died Aug. 2, 1878. Almost before Maria had her bearings, Nov. 9, 1878, four-year-old Frank followed his father to the cemetery on the hill.\n\nMaria Anna Goepfrich at age 31, widowed, along with two young daughters, an unfinished home, no relatives, no funds, no means of support, no Social Security ï¿½ her only assets, her courage and her own determination.\n\nMaria took in washing, ironing, did housework, cleaned and scrubbed, raised garden, vegetables and fruit. She baked bread, pies and rolls for sale, took in boarders, put up travelers, and did their laundry. She made clothing, shirts and dresses to sell at the store.\n\nGrating horseradish and peddling it for five cents a jar, she received 15 cents for a washing and ironing, 25 cents for cleaning the church or school. She grew beets for sugar, wheat for flour. The butcher sold her a 10-cent stew or roast and she sold him and his friend each a 20-cent sandwich.\n\nMaria mowed weeds in exchange for a can of milk. She cleaned the doctor's quarters in exchange for services to her girls. She herself never took medication or medical service.\n\nGrandma's daughters were trained to appreciate the advantage of education, and were among the first to graduate from Hebron High School. Later they both taught in the schools.\n\nMy mother Rose married my father, Edward Wiedel, at the age of 22, and she and father were a great help to Maria then and until her death. She however never lost in independence.\n\nCatherine stayed at home until she was 30 years old, then joined the School Sisters of Notre Dame at St. Louis, to teach for another 62 years.\n\nGrandma Maria was then for 25 years or more alone. Mother related to me much of Maria's early life and I knew her well in her later years. Her actions were a \"perpetual motion\" ï¿½ she seldom paused, although she was polite to visitor or friend. Her hands either sewed, knitted or repaired. Her needlework was an art, a perfection. Her home, garden and flowers were always clean and attractive. As children we loved to see her communicate with her flowers and her chickens. I believe she dreaded to kill her chickens, but what a stew she could cook up, adding greens, carrots or cabbage for a diner's delight. Sweet corn had innumerable uses. When the ear was mature, she cut the stalk into the stew. The husks were dried and used in pillows or mattresses, the cob for fuel. Grandma owned a quarter of a city block and all was used. Grandma Maria never accepted Aid, Relief or Charity. Taxes and repairs were paid promptly ï¿½ she met her obligations.\n\nGrandma lived frugally, but she was a gracious lady. Maria purchased one box of matches each year. One match lit the lamp, and that fire served to light all other fires. Her lamp wicks were homemade; she made a whitewash for painting, leather to patch shoes, and blackening to shine them. Her original spade, hoe, rake and scythe lasted a lifetime. When a branch fell from a tree, she carefully gathered it up, using each particle for fuel.\n\nWherever she went she walked and carried what she needed. Often taking an evening stroll down the railroad track ï¿½ when returning Grandma had a bag of coal that had fallen from the cars.\n\nIn later years Father and Mother installed electricity, but Grandma only used one bulb at a time ï¿½ too bright!\n\nMaria's prayer toward the end was that she depart in peace and without medical attendance. One night the Lord called her, but not before she told us it would be so. The prayer she taught me as a boy, I'll always remember: \"Dear Lord, send me five angels ï¿½ Two to my right, two to my left and one to keep me between and to come along.\"\n\nGrandma Maria's whole life was an example, a lesson we each might learn from and heed. She was a fine lady.\n\nAs is the custom in times of hardship and bereavement, it is historically important to note that the Masonic Lodge was ecumenically inclined to offer to this family the benefit of charitable donations of food insofar as was acceptable to their pride and independence, and only until this beautiful woman could make herself self-supporting. The manner of her gratitude was as admirable as her other qualities.\n\nNICHOLAS BETHSCHEIDER\n\nShown in 1878 are the Nicholas Bethscheider family. Seated l to r: Nicholas, Alphonso, Anna. Standing: Stephen, Adolph, Andrew and John.\n\nThe family of Nick Bethscheider and Anna Marie Stutz moved to Hebron with their children in 1872. Their children and dates of birth are as follows: 1. Stephen, born 1856, 2. Adolph, born 1857, 3. Andrew, born 1861, 4. Alphonso, born 1862, 5. John, born 1864, 6. Josephine, born 1868. 7. Catherine, (no record), and 8. Anna, born 1874, Grandmother Katheryn (Mrs. Peter) Stutz came with their family; but within nine years of their arrival, five of them had died: Anna died in 1874, Grandma Stutz in 1877, Josephine in 1868, John in 1881, and Catherine, (no record).\n\nSTEPHEN BETHSCHEIDER lived only six years after his father's death, dying here in 1904 at the age of 48 years. He had managed to raise a large family. He first married Mary Chavet, who had two children, Joseph and Oliva, but who lived only a short time after that. Joseph moved from Hebron as a young man, and Oliva married John McDonald of Hebron, on September 20, 1905. Their family added much to Sacred Heart Parish, and some are still present.\n\nStephen then married Nora Kelly. They had six children: Frances, Anna, Genevieve, Eleanor, John and Maude. Stephen became prominent in church affairs and was on the church committee. He conducted a very important church meeting in 1902 to iron out some difficulties. Stephen died in 1904 and Nora in 1908, leaving these six orphans. Their Aunt Kelly raised them at their home at Second and Lincoln in Hebron. They all attended Sacred Heart School.\n\nADOLPH BETHSCHEIDER married Rosie Osterhoff on January 17, 1881. They lived in Hebron until 1896, and moved to Humphrey, Nebraska. None of their family often came back to Hebron except Eugene in 1925.\n\nANDREW BETHSCHEIDER was born August 2, 1861 at Honey Creek, Wisconsin, and came to Hebron in 1871. Theresa Anna Klaes was born June 13, 1860, also at Honey Creek, Wisconsin, and came to Hebron about 1881. Her parents were William and Frances Klaes. Andrew and Theresa were married June 8, 1886, at Hebron. Andrew died Apr. 26, 1926, and Theresa March 7, 1945, at Hebron. Their children were as follows:\n\nAnna, who died at birth May 24, 1887, at Hebron.\n\nLawrence N., born October 26, 1888. He married Anna Marie Kutscher of Deshler on September 26, 1911. Their children were Urban, Merle, Wilford and Robert Lee, all of whom have passed away.\n\nWilliam Anthony, born May 10, 1891, died in Royal Oak, Michigan, December 29, 1963. He married Maude Estelle Nickolson on May 30, 1911, at Belleville, Kansas. Their children were Dorothy, Marcella Pyne and Thelma Margaret Bill.\n\nMargaret Josephine, born November 24, 1893, at Hebron. She worked for Lincoln Telephone & Telegraph until her retirement. She has been a member of the Altar Society and B.P.W., and enjoys crocheting and other needlework.\n\nRudolph Alphonso, born May 13, 1896, died May 21, 1955, at Hebron.\n\nMary Anna, born September 17, 1898. Mary worked also for Lincoln Telephone & Telegraph until her retirement. She also is a member of Altar Society and B.P.W., and now does embroidery work.\n\nRegina, born August 24, 1901. She worked for Lincoln Telephone & Telegraph until her death November 22, 1963. She had been transferred to Wymore, Nebraska, following the installation of automatic equipment in Hebron, reducing the need for employees. Regina died as the result of a heart attack at the switchboard at Wymore. She was a member of the Altar Society and B.P.W.\n\nLouis was born February 5, 1905 and died March 4, 1905.\n\nHenry Andrew, born February 24, 1906, died May 14, 1951. He married Irene Craig and they had one child: LaVieve. In about 1941 they moved to California and then Henry came back to Hebron shortly before his mother's death.\n\nALPHONSO BETHSCHEIDER, son of Nick Bethscheider, married Mary Mapis and moved to Stoneham, Colorado around 1890.\n\nIt seems appropriate at this point to portray more than statistics about the family of Nick Bethscheider, for it is important to the history of this parish that they be known for what they were. They were not only founders and dedicated workers in all the parish activities. They were also the main source of inspiration to many other families of the Wisconsin area who followed their example to pioneer.\n\nJ. CHARLES HELFRICH\n\nJ. Charles Helfrich, son of Jacob and Christina Helfrich, was born in Rheinphalz, Germany, February 18, 1845. At the age of 22 he came to the United States, landing in New York, N.Y., on January 24, 1867. From there he went to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he carried on his trade as wagon maker. In the year 1869 he secured work as a cabinet maker in St. Joseph, Missouri. While in St. Joseph he married Maria Anna Stutz of Wisconsin, on December 26, 1870. They had eleven children, nine sons and two daughters, who all attended Sacred Heart School in Hebron. They were: Frank, Peter, Christina, Mary Ann (Molly), Edward, Jacob Alphonse (Al), Joseph, Barn-hart Edward (Ben), Herman, Bartholomew, and (Emile) Carl. The J. Charles Helfrich family was one of the founding families of Sacred Heart Parish who helped to build the first church. After twenty-three years in business he decided to move to a farm. More land was available to the west and he found a farm to his liking near Carter, Nebraska, southeast of Oxford. He then belonged to the Orleans parish. J. Charles Helfrich was a rugged individual, living 36 years yet in St. Mary's parish at Orleans after leaving Hebron. While his children did not all stay with him, they all left Hebron, but some returned, to carry on businesses here.\n\nFrank Helfrich was born Oct. 26, 1871, at St. Joseph, Missouri. He died January 27, 1899.\n\nPeter Helfrich was born Aug. 8, 1873, at Meridian, Nebraska. He married Anna Mary Gehley. They both died at Boulder, Colorado, leaving their children: Evelyn, Louise, George, Charles, Gilbert, Pauline, Lawrence, Edith, and Evelyn.\n\nChristina Anna Helfrich was born March 2, 1875, at Meridian, and died April 25, 1875.\n\nMary Ann Helfrich was born Feb. 24, 1876, at Meridian. She married Ben Ralston. They had one son, Arthur Ralston. Mary Ann died in July, 1942.\n\nEdward Helfrich was born Sept. 14, 1878, at Hebron. He married Clara Elizabeth Gehley at Orleans, Nebraska, Jan. 16, 1907. Their family has migrated to other parts of the country.\n\nJacob Helfrich was born Aug. 25, 1879, at Hebron, married Alice, and had one son, Donald.\n\nJoseph Carl Helfrich was born November 21, 1881 at Hebron, Nebraska. He married Nora Rigdon, came back to Hebron from Orleans and worked for the Thomas Bakery, learning the trade. Mr. Thomas left Hebron for his ill-fated trip to Europe in 1905. He never returned and his wife tried to carry on, but decided to sell. Joe Helfrich with his younger brother, Bart, took over the management and bought it. Later their brother, Carl, was also associated with them. Helfrich Bakery was one of the Catholic business places for over 30 years. Joseph had two girls, Norine and Josetta. Norine married Frank Ziegler and their children were the third generation of that family to attend Sacred Heart School. After the Helfrich Bakery was sold, Joe was associated with his son-in-law, Frank Ziegler, who operated a liquor business until 1951 when he sold to Richard McKenzie.\n\nBarnhart Helfrich was born April 29, 1884 at Hebron and died June 9, 1908.\n\nHerman Arthur Helfrich was born July 12, 1888 at Hebron, Nebraska, married Bess, had four children, and their descendants have made their homes in other parts of the country.\n\nBartholomew Joseph Helfrich was born September 13, 1890, at Hebron. He was associated with the Helfrich Bakery. (Emile) Carl Helfrich was born February 5, 1893, at Hebron, Nebraska. He was associated with the Bakery for a time, married Alma Nacke and moved to Portland, Oregon. They have one son and two daughters.\n\nDescendants of the family of J. Charles Helfrich have now all disappeared from the Hebron area, but they left here a very important part of their past ï¿½ the part they played in the formation of Sacred Heart Parish. For the structure this family helped to build, those who remain here will be eternally grateful.\n\nPeter Celestine Chavet - Picture won first place in its division when exhibited at World's Fair in St. Louis.\n\nPETER CELESTINE CHAVET FAMILY\n\nPeter Celestine Chavet was born July 18, 1831. He married Josephine Koch, who was born February 12, 1829. Peter had a good musical education in his native France. He was sought out as a teacher in schools there. The wanderlust struck young Peter when he learned about the wonderful new land of America. He managed passage to the United States and after several moves settled near Sauk City, Wisconsin, where their family was born. Peter and Josephine had eight children:\n\nHenry, born March 15, 1854, married Johanna Roeser;\n\nJoseph, born August 22, 1857, married Rose Echelman:\n\nMaria, (no birth record), married Steve Bethscheider;\n\nLeo, who died when he was eight years old;\n\nHelena, born June 20, 1866, married George Shipman;\n\nAdelheid, born January 26, 1867, married Lafe Shipman;\n\nAmelia, born May 17, 1869;\n\nEdward, born August 17, 1870, married his brother's wife after Joseph's death.\n\nPeter served in the Union Army during the Civil War. In 1878 he and the family moved west to Thayer County, Nebraska, and first settled about four miles east of Hebron near the river. Their eight children and Grandmother Chavet lived together. Grandmother Chavet died shortly after their arrival and is buried in Sacred Heart Cemetery. Peter was the first organist of Sacred Heart Church.\n\nHENRY CHAVET FAMILY\n\nHenry Chavet, son of Peter Celestine Chavet, was born March 15, 1854, and married Johanna Roeser, who was born December 15, 1855. Their children were:\n\nBen, (no birth record), left Hebron young;\n\nAnna, born 1877, left Hebron young;\n\nClara, born May 10, 1883, left Hebron young;\n\nIsidore, born August 6, 1885, farmed east of Hebron;\n\na twin, who died at birth;\n\nRegina, born May 10, 1888, after education in Hebron Public School and College, married John William Holmes from\n\nChester on June 16, 1917. They moved to Sterling, Colorado, remained for years, and after her husband's death she returned and now lives in an apartment in Hebron;\n\nMaria Frances, born March 27, 1891, left Hebron young.\n\nJOSEPH CHAVET FAMILY\n\nJoseph Chavet, son of Peter Celestine Chavet, was born August 22, 1857. He married Rose Echelman, who was born February 27, 1864. The fate that brought her to Hebron was a mistake. She had taken passage from Rotterdam bound for Hebron, New York, and the agent misread her ticket and sent her on west. When she arrived in Hebron, Nebraska, she spoke not a word of English. She was sent to a German family to help with the language barrier. She stayed at the Nick Bethscheider's until she found a job at $2.00 per week. She learned English and joined the church. She married Joseph Chavet and they had six children:\n\nBert, born November 7, 1888, who was a cattleman and farmer, now retired at Waterloo, Nebraska, and is 88 years old in 1976. His family left Hebron in 1895;\n\nLeo, born August 30, 1890;\n\nWalter, Lafayette, Hugo, and Edith, (no birth records).\n\nJoseph Chavet became ill and died while the children were very young. After his death, his brother Edward married Rose and raised the children.\n\nMATTHEW H. WEISS FAMILY\n\nMatthew H. Weiss came from the Sauk City area of Wisconsin, and was a member of a country parish 30 miles north of Milwaukee. Other families such as Bethscheider, Chavet, Wiedel, Stutz, Klaes and Schardt came from this area 35 miles northwest of Madison, (Baraboo) near the Wisconsin River.\n\nCatherine A. Sassenrath came from Wisconsin also and knew Ed Wiedel and the Stutzs there. She was the sister of Mary Sassenrath, grandmother of Mrs. Louis Wiedel.\n\nMatthew and Catherine were married in Hebron in 1880. Both came here in 1879. Four children were born to them: Walter, Coletta, Regene and Oscar. Walter's history is given in Chapter IV of this book. Coletta died at the age of four, about 1900.\n\nRegene attended Sacred Heart School and Hebron High. After graduation she taught country school near Hebron; then worked in Washington, D. C. She then lived in Omaha until her marriage to Fred Preston. They had no children. Mr. Preston passed away in 1973. She now resides in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nOscar attended Sacred Heart School and Hebron High School. He attended the Naval Academy. Most of his life was spent in Lincoln, Nebraska, in the retail oil and gas business.\n\nCatherine Weiss was very active in the Altar Society. Mr. Weiss helped on the Holy Name Society, and was a charter member of the Knights of Columbus. Matthew practiced law in Hebron, where they lived all their married lives.\n\nJOSEPH GREGOR FAMILY\n\nThe Gregor family arrived in Sacred Heart Parish during the 1880's and will be remembered for the activities of the children. Joseph Gregor was born August 20, 1814 and died in Hebron June 20, 1891. There were three Gregor children: Emil, Frank, and Mary. The last of the secular teachers of the Catholic school here was Mrs. Emil Gregor, teaching from 1890-1891. Emil was a businessman in Hebron for many years. Many people remember Mrs. Gregor for her rug weaving ability.\n\nThe Gregors first settled in Nebraska near Powell and Gladstone. They attended church at Fairbury. In the late 1880's and 1890's they all migrated to near Hebron and joined Sacred Heart Parish. The Frank Gregors lived on a farm northwest of Hebron and moved to Elgin, Nebraska, about 1913. Mary Gregor married Joseph Burbach, of Powell, Nebraska, a neighbor of the Landkamers. Their children were Elizabeth, Mary, Joseph, and Adolf.\n\nJOSEPH BURBACH SR. FAMILY\n\nElizabeth was born in 1885, went to the convent in Omaha as a novice in 1905, and became a nun in 1908 in the School Sisters of Notre Dame. She died in 1968.\n\nMary was born in 1887, married Harry Beard, Hebron City Electrician, moved to Red Cloud, and died in 1961.\n\nJoseph was born in 1889, and married Frieda Willy. Their history is in Chapter IV.\n\nAdolf was born in 1892, and married Marie Willy. Their history is in Chapter IV. The Joseph Burbach family bought a farm 5 miles northwest of Hebron in 1892 where Joseph Jr. and Frieda still live.\n\nSTEPHAN JOHN WIEDEL FAMILY\n\nOf all the families I came to know during my residence in the bell tower, this one seems to have remained the strongest in numbers in this parish. Perhaps part of this was due to the fact that they worked so closely together as a matter of survival. People used to make jokes about the Wiedel plague being worse than the grasshopper plague. They always found time for the church, though, despite the trials of endurance.\n\nJohn Adam Stutz and Catherine (Katrina Grindman) Stutz migrated from Hamburg, Katheryn Ann Stutz, who married Stephan John Wiedel in 1882;\n\nPeter Stutz, who married Caroline Shearer. Both died in Wisconsin and the children were raised by the Nick Bethscheider family;\n\nMaria Anna Stutz, who married Jacob Charles Helfrich in 1876. This shows the relationship of four strong founding families of Sacred Heart Parish: The Bethscheider's, the Wiedel's, the Stutz's, and the Helfrich's.\n\nThe family of Stephan John Wiedel and Katheryn Ann Stutz joined their relatives near Hebron in 1882. They first rented a farm north of Hebron,then bought one south of town. The children of Stephan John Wiedel and Katheryn Ann Stutz were:\n\nAnna, born January 26, 1859;\n\nHelena, born January 16, 1861, died 1867;\n\nMary Anna, born November 21, 1862;\n\nNicholas Wiedel, born and died January 27, 1865;\n\n(Nicholas) Edward, born October 13, 1867;\n\nStephen Joseph, born May 16, 1870;\n\nJoseph Wiedel, born May 23, 1874;\n\nKatherine Mary (Kate), born April 15, 1878.\n\nTheir oldest daughter, Anna, married John Eichinger before they left Wisconsin. Mary Anna married Henry Luther at Hebron. They moved to St. Mary's parish at Orleans. Helena and Nicholas died, leaving only the four youngest in this parish.\n\nStephan John suffered financial difficulties in Wisconsin before moving here, and had great financial difficulty establishing the farming business here, but had three sons who stayed with him until the farm was paid for. Then they each started to buy a farm nearby, branching out into separate successful farming ventures, but still maintaining a closely-knit working arrangement.\n\nThe Wiedel family prospered in the nineties with three boys to carry on the main farm work and a younger sister, Kate, to help in the house. This strong unit began to be dissolved as they began to marry, the youngest being first. On October 13, 1896, Katherine married Lloyd McKenzie, who had come ten years before with his family from\n\nAll settled on farms. They all had large families (8 to 12 each) and all attended elementary school at Sacred Heart. Except for two years at Tobias and two at Fairbury for the McKenzie family, these four families spent their entire lives in Hebron. Having large families in impoverished times made it difficult to gain financial status. In the late teens and early twenties the Wiedel combination, with real cooperation, farmed many acres of rented land along with their own, and had manpower and horsepower enough to man an entire threshing crew. They owned their own machines, which required a crew of twelve to fifteen men.\n\nThey were unable to rent enough land to keep all busy, so each bought more land in the twenties. Land was high, but prices were good for grain, and it looked as though prosperity would continue. This was not to be. Prices tumbled and they did not get their land paid for when the depression years of the thirties came. They lost much land. This was a particularly difficult time for Sacred Heart Parish. Many of our people were bankrupt. The younger generation just getting started had to look for opportunity wherever it appeared. These four families scattered in many directions and took various positions.\n\nMany years later you find the descendants of this original Wiedel family in many states, in many occupations, and many still farming. Each family who still belongs to the parish is listed separately in Chapter IV.\n\nWiedel Threshing Crew - 1921. L to r: Steve, Norbert, Ray, Edward, Clem (engineer), William, Herman, Albert, Joe, Corniel, Joseph, Frank, Steve Eichinger (a cousin), Bernard, John, Leo, Joe Jr., Louis, Alvin, Walter and Carl.\n\nGEORGE McKENZIE FAMILY\n\nThe backgrounds of the early families of Sacred Heart Parish are varied and interesting. In order to appreciate our heritage it is beneficial to trace back those whose records can be located. The McKenzie family is one of particularly interesting ancestry.\n\nJudd McKenzie was one of seven Scottish brothers who served in the Revolution with George Washington. Of these seven brothers we have records of only one. Judd's son, John, had a son, Joseph, who married Margaret Klingman, a granddaughter of Jacob Hostedler, a prominent Swiss. Joseph settled in the mountain country of Pennsylvania and his children are as follows:\n\nHarriet, born in 1840;\n\nCyrus, born in 1841;\n\nGeorge, born in 1844;\n\nAnna, born in 1846, joined the Sisters of Charity, and died in New Orleans, of the yellow fever;\n\nElias Bernard, born 1848, became a priest and served in Baltimore, Maryland;\n\nSara Ellen, born 1850, drowned at the age of one year;\n\nEphraim, born 1852;\n\nMatilda, born 1855;\n\nKatherine, born 1857, who with sister, Matilda, served as housekeepers for their brother, Father Elias, and who never married;\n\nThe tenth and eleventh were stillborn;\n\nClara, born 1860.\n\nOf this large family no one with the name McKenzie is known to remain today except the descendants of George, the third oldest, and the only one to migrate to Nebraska. He married Belinda Walker in Pennsylvania and came here in January 1886. Their children were: Ed, Alonzo (Lon), Lloyd, Rebecca Ann (Barr), Robert, Clara (Marsh), Mollie (Duncan), Nelle (Bob Raymond), Grace, Edith and Ethel (Thomas), twins, and Maude (McDermet).\n\nThey bought a farm northwest of Hebron. With four husky sons, he intended to be a big farmer; but the boys soon became of age and left home.\n\nMuch of their education was from the Hackney school nearby. Some of the girls spent at least part of their school years at Sacred Heart. The girls all graduated from Hebron High School and six became school teachers. Ethel (Thomas) and Maude (McDermet) belonged to the first choir at Sacred Heart. Of the seven girls, only Maude, who married Breece McDermet, remains in Hebron. The other girls and the four McDermet children also left Hebron after school. Maude contributed much to St. Ann's Altar Society and is still active in Gray Ladies.\n\nOf the four McKenzie boys, Ed and Robert left Hebron young, and Lon McKenzie married Maggie O'Brien on March 2, 1897. They lived on several rented farms, and then bought one. Lon and Maggie raised three boys who all left at the end of high school. Of these three, Bernard, the oldest, became a chemist for the Mayo Clinic, and the other two moved with their parents to Colorado in 1915.\n\nLloyd married Katherine Mary (Kate) Wiedel. Their history is told in Chapter IV.\n\nJOSEPH BIEHN FAMILY\n\nJoseph Biehn married Margaret Living, who was born November 11, 1850. They lived four miles north of the Burlington Depot of Hebron, Nebraska. Their children were Felix, born January 14, 1872; Phillip, born June 14, 1873; Mary, born September 11, 1875; Aloys, born April 28, 1876; Peter, born February 22, 1878;\n\nAnartaria, born October 2, 1880; Christie, born June 2, 1883; Sebastian, born March 31, 1887. The Biehns were so well known in that area that the school was called the Biehn School for years. The school was moved across the road about 1900. After the Biehn's left Hebron, only the old pioneers could remember the school by that name where it was first located. The boy they called \"Lige\" was a custom corn sheller in the 1890's. Felix married Maggie Hartman in Sacred Heart Church.\n\nTHE KANSAS KELLY FAMILY\n\nTom, Larry, and Will Kelly were three bachelors living with their widowed sister Bridget Henderson as housekeeper across the border into Kansas. Their home was visited by the Pastor at Hebron to say Mass occasionally on a weekday. They paid their church support in Hebron. Ferd McKenzie can remember going along as a server boy in 1908.\n\nJOSEPH BULLER FAMILY\n\nJoseph Buller was born in Ashaffenbury, Germany, in 1832. The family came to America in 1845, locating in Buffalo, New York. They moved to a farm near West Bend, Wisconsin, early in 1846, where his parents died. In 1859 he was married to Catherine Dartling at Schlesnig, Wisconsin, and farmed there until 1880. In February, 1880, he moved his family to Hebron, Nebraska. They traveled by train from Schlesnig, Wisconsin, to St. Joseph, Missouri, then via St. Joseph and G. I. Railroad to Belvidere. He bought a farm east of Hebron, a prairie consisting of 320 acres @ $5.25 per acre. He was also among the committee who went to Exeter to get the Bishop to allow Hebron a priest. Their children were:\n\nJoseph, Jr., born 1859;\n\nTeresa, born 1861; Tony, born 1872;\n\nPeter, born 1863; Barbara, born 1874;\n\nValentine, born 1865; Clara, born 1877;\n\nMary, born 1869; John, born 1878;\n\nCatherine Dartling was born October 28, 1838, and died August 5, 1880. After her death, Joseph married Anna Vogt, who was born May 9, 1839.\n\nValentine, with his family, farmed the east part of the farm and in 1906 John moved into the home place. Joseph and Anna then moved to a home close to church. They both died in 1914 and part of the farm was sold. Val moved to Wisconsin. John's history is in Chapter IV.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Wm. Klaes\n\nGolden Wedding\n\nWM. KLAES FAMILY\n\nThe Wm. Klaes family came from Wisconsin October 31, 1880. They built a home across the street south of the church, which was later moved to erect an Incubator Factory. The Klaes family had six children: Casper and Henry Klaes, Mrs. Andrew Bethscheider, Mrs. Wm. Schlife, Mrs. Nels Cederholm and Josephine Stutz. Mrs. Klaes' father had served under Napoleon, making the trip to Moscow and returning. Later he spent seven years in Spain. He lived to be 99 years old. When Mrs. Klaes was 49 years old she helped Mrs. Weiss at the time W7alter was born, and had previously attended her mother when Mrs. Weiss was born 33 years before in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1880 Sacred Heart Parish had grown to thirty families. Some of the others who came that year were M. H. Weiss, Striegel, Chavet, Fasbender, all from Wisconsin, and Frank Hartman from Madison. Indiana. The Kempers also bought a farm north of town.\n\nFACTS ABOUT THE TOWN\n\nIn order that you may imagine or recall the beginning of Sacred Heart Parish more realistically, it is helpful to take note of what occurred during the same period of history in the town of Hebron. Do you know for example how Hebron got its name? Some of the old timers give this explanation.\n\nIn about 1863 Rev. Ives Marks, his wife Emily, and their six children came first to the area of Big Sandy Creek. He spent much of his time doing missionary work for the United Brethren Church and formed the first Sunday School at Big Sandy Crossing.\n\nThey found a suitable place at Rose Creek for a dam and sawmill to make their living. Across from the dam he built a church. In the spring of 1864, Rev. Marks and his three sons, with the help of Mr. Gallant and two sons, built the first school house in Thayer County. Rev. Marks was elected County Treasurer in 1868.\n\nThe \"Colony of the Union\" was the original founder of the town of Hebron. Eighteen members of this group each paid their share of the land and surveying. These are listed in the Andreas History of Nebraska 1882, found in the Hebron Public Library.\n\nIt is thought that some time after the recording of the plot where Hebron now stands, Rev. Marks chose the name Hebron for the \"Queen City on the Little Blue River,\" since Hebron is mentioned in the Bible (Joshua 20:7, Cities of Asylum).\n\nIn the period of time preceding the year 1893 the City of Hebron had become fairly prosperous and businesses were booming. There were nearly 2,000 residents. Many two and three story buildings had been built, and Hebron was the finest shopping center in southern Nebraska.\n\nThe big Hughes Hotel was a great stopping place for traveling men and sample salesmen. Charles Fletcher had built a large two story building. The first floor housed the New Big Boston Clothing Store. Young and Knode were big operators, housing a hardware at 327 Lincoln Ave., and a large lumberyard a block west. Hazards operated a large shoe store, Morgans had a ladies ready-to-wear and dry goods store. Wm. Griffin, one of the very few Catholic businessmen, had a modern photography gallery. Wetherald Bros. Flour Mill was a big operation which shipped flour to several states. The Friedensau Roller Mills did custom grinding. Farmers brought in wheat enough to provide flour for their families all year and took it home either one sack at a time (storing the rest), or they hauled home the whole lot at once. Ed Cederholm had a meat market and the big General Store of Lockwood Bros, advertised sugar at 22 lbs. for one dollar. The Blue Valley Bank advertised loans for 6 percent.\n\nThey had very little fire protection. The cistern had been filled; but the new well would stand only for one hour pumping a day and people were cautioned not to waste water. Train service was good and generally on time.

Serving as mayor in 1893 was W. D. Galbraith, and in 1894 was Wm. Cook.\n\nIn 1891 Hebron became a city of the second class and then had a mayor and president of the council. They had three wards with a councilman elected for a two-year term from each ward. J. E. Thomas served as last president of the village council. In later years Louis Thomas, a successful businessman, was on the council.\n\nNick Bethscheider, who had become an old man, was elected to the city council for many terms. The last year he was elected was 1896; but he died before election day 1897 at the age of 75.\n\nWhile Catholics played a big part in the advancement of Hebron, being a town dependent on the farming industry, they were often discriminated against. Few ever served as city officials and there were never any on the public school board.\n\nFIRST RESIDENT PASTOR\n\nFather Phillip Ehrlach was appointed first pastor at Hebron July 28, 1880. Father Ehrlach was a hard worker during this period of growth; but the task of administration of Hebron, Gilead, Alexandria, and Fairbury parishes, plus the Hubbell and Carleton people became insurmountable. At the time when I arrived in Hebron in January, 1885, Father Ehrlach was nearing complete exhaustion from overwork. I was to know him very briefly. On January 9, 1885, the Bishop replaced him with Rev. J. L. Bucholtzer. That winter was unusually severe and this scattered parish became too much for him also, having to drive teams for such great distances in bad weather. He left for California, leaving Hebron again without a priest.\n\nIn the interim Father Kuppenbender of St. Stephen's at Lawrence was again called in to help until the Bishop could find another. Rev. L. P. Fleury came July 15, 1885. Under his instructions the church was enlarged to 34 feet by adding a sacristy of 12 x 12 feet.\n\nLate that year they began to teach the German language in the school. This was continued for over twenty years. Ferd McKenzie was one of those who was taught to read and write and pray in German. Later it was phased out.\n\nThe Bishop sent another priest, Rev. Gerard Boll, to replace Father Fleury on April 27, 1886. He found this parish in debt but growing. He influenced the congregation to purchase all of Block 9, in the City of Hebron from Judge Lobinger. (This is the present site of Sacred Heart Church.) It included a small dwelling. The price was $2,240.00.\n\nThe deed was recorded May 14, 1885. It was decided that this was more than we would ever need, so the northwest quarter of the block was sold to Mr. Rock and later the northeast quarter was sold to John Segin, still leaving a large debt on the rest of the property. This proved to be a good step in the progress of Sacred Heart Parish. The location was ideal, only two blocks from the County Court House and three from downtown Hebron. In anticipation of future needs, grading and leveling was done by members of the congregation. Father Boll attempted to move the church to its new location in 1887, but met with opposition, so he moved into the small house and continued his drive to reduce the debt.\n\nIn April, 1888, the Bishop transferred Rev. Gerard Boll to Crete. The next day after the members heard this they sent a delegation to visit the Bishop asking for his reconsideration to leave our pastor at Hebron. He refused, stating that he would send a young priest, Father Michael Merkl, to Hebron. His responsibility would be for Hebron, Alexandria, and Fairbury, with residence at Hebron until the new rectory at Fairbury was finished, when he would live there. Instead of belonging to the Alexandria and Fairbury mission area, Hebron would then attach Turkey Creek, previously a mission of Crete.\n\nWhen this change was accomplished Rev. H. B. Hansen became pastor for a short time until Father F. X. Schraffl was appointed. He stayed until April, 1889, when Father Augustine Rausch arrived.\n\nThe great blizzard of 1888 had caused much material loss to the people, some losing large numbers of their livestock. All were in distress for a time. The next four years, however, were much better and the people began to prosper. In May, 1891, Father Rausch was transferred to Roseland but returned again in July.\n\nFirst Communion Class, April 20, 1890, pictured with Father Augustine Rausch.

Others in the class are: Peter Biehn, Albert Curten, John Curten, Henry Fasbender, Edward Helfrich, Adam Stutz and Michael Mappes (tall boy), Clara Buller, Bertha Fischer, Elizabeth Mappes, Maria Mappes, and Carolina Wolff.\n\nFIRST THANKSGIVING DINNER\n\nIn November, 1891, the first great Thanksgiving Dinner and Bazaar was organized to become an annual event. This was a dependable source of income for many years. It not only enabled the parish to buy fuel for the winter, but also that year they were able to reduce the debt by another $400.00. This was truly a mammoth undertaking that would mean for fifty years no member of Sacred Heart would ever consider Thanksgiving a Holiday. From that day forward it was a work week. This highly commendable community affair more than insured the continuation of a warm church on Sundays. It cemented the group together as a working team, melting away their differences and bringing in their non-Catholic friends to help make this a truly historic event in Hebron.\n\nGILEAD CHURCH BEGINNING\n\nSeveral times during his pastorate at Hebron, Rev. Rausch said Mass in the Rock Island Railroad Section House at Gilead. Richard Cooney was the Section Foreman in 1890-1891. Usually from 1887 until 1910 the people of the Gilead area attended church at Alexandria.\n\nThe first meeting at Gilead about building a church was at the home of Hugh Deaver in 1907. Present were three Henshaws, two Rauners, two Hergotts, three Deavers, Nick Cunningham, Joe Blaes, Phillip Connel and John Daringer. A subscription of $1,100.00 was taken to be collected at another meeting at the home of Hugh J. Deaver in 1908 to complete their plans. It was presided over by Rev. John J. Deaver.\n\nWith the Bishop's permission in February, 1892, Father Rausch exchanged places with Rev. Albert Petrasch, then rector of St. Mary's Church at Orleans, Nebraska. Surely at this point something deserves to be said about the impression I gained from the people who were so terribly determined to endure that during the span of 1880 to 1892 ten different pastors had served the parish. There was only one reason for their short terms ï¿½ the drastically hard times, the great blizzard of 1888, difficult travel, overwork, and daily increasing demands upon the men of God.\n\nFATHER PETRASCH\n\nFather Albert Petrasch was a builder. The people of our mission Turkey Creek needed a new church. With their cooperation he continued a drive for funds and on May 16, 1892, the cornerstone was laid. The dedication took place in November with fourteen priests present for the occasion. The location of this church was several miles north of Shickley, Nebraska, in Fillmore County. It was a long drive there on Sunday for Mass after an early service at Hebron.\n\nFather Petrasch's pastorate was destined to be a huge success. He was recognized as an apostolic builder of the Church in southern Nebraska. Before the church at Turkey Creek was finished he was already laying plans for the new Hebron Church. The location purchased several years before was ideal; but Father felt that the cottonwood church was not a fit abode for a No. 1 parish now in the making here in Hebron. The old cottonwood church would have to go. There had been several years of promise. It was becoming easier to convince the people of the need for a new church. Can you imagine crowding over 30 families in 22 x 32 feet of space? A lot of people have living rooms that large today. That's only about 4 square feet per person. It takes 4 square feet of space for a chair.\n\nThus ends the Genesis of Sacred Heart Church, and - marks the beginning of the Exodus of God's people to a new promised land where they will build a temple for the Lord our God and sing out praises of gratitude for the salvation of His beloved people."
