        "text": "Mrs. Maryann Helfrich, age 79, a longtime resident of Fort Walton Beach, passed away on January 13, 2023. Maryann was born in Queens, New York to Nicholas and Florence Stabile. Maryann and her husband, John, moved to Fort Walton Beach in 1980. She retired from Fresh Start for Children and Families as the Executive Director. Maryann was instrumental in the development of Okaloosa County’s Fresh Start transitional housing program. Through her caring leadership, the program flourished. Maryann lived her faith by making sure her actions centered on people and meeting their needs. She volunteered with the Crisis Line, Make-a-Wish Foundation, and Fema. In her spare time, she enjoyed cooking, playing the piano, visiting New York to see her family and friends, and being the best Grandma and “Mimi” to her four grandchildren who were her pride and joy.\n\nMaryann is preceded in death by her parents, Nicholas and Florence Stabile; her husband of forty-three years, John Helfrich. She is survived by her children John “JJ” Helfrich, Tracy Helfrich Whitehead and her husband Jerremy; two grandsons, Shaw and Will Helfrich; two granddaughters, Emma and Brooke Whitehead; two sisters, Dolores Shedd and her husband John, Joanne Sica; and brother-in-law Heinz Paul.\n\nThe family will receive guests for visitation between 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM on Wednesday, Jan 18 at Emerald Coast Funeral Home in Fort Walton Beach.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be held on Thursday, January 19, 2023, at 11:00 AM at St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Fort Walton Beach. Burial at Beal Memorial Cemetery will follow the Mass.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that you consider a donation to the American Heart Association."
