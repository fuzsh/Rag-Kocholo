        "text": "SHOPTALK: On the desks this week are two Charlie Baumhart pix. I use these 1.) because I thought a good deal of Charlie. He was, far and away, one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever known. And 2.) the pic of him in his father’s drug store is candidly unusual. I really can’t recall where it came from. This pic also features the candy counter at the Baumhart store. Many persons around my age will remember it well.\n\nABOUT C.W.B.: What might have been never was. It's a tale old as the world. Was it the result of opportunities missed; opportunities that never materialized; just dumb luck; or was it all of the above? Who knows but the good Lord himself. It's just the way \"the cookie crumbled\". Or at least it's the way it crumbled for Charlie and (I believe) for Vermilion, Ohio as well.\n\nCharles (a.k.a. \"Charlie\", \"Chub\", or \"Chubby\") Wheeler Baumhart became the youngest citizen in the Village of Vermilion on March 30, 1914. He was the second of two sons born to Albert David Sr. and Effie (Washburn) Baumhart. The elder Baumhart (to further smoosh an idiom to pieces) was a \"pretty smart cookie\". Though a pharmacist by trade - his ambitions did not end there. When a new communication device came to town in 1901 (i.e. the telephone) he was in on it. When a new form of entertainment came to town (i.e. motion pictures) he was in on it. And when a new organization (i.e. Rotary) of professional persons was organized in the village in the late 1920's he was in on it too. Thus, it should surprise few to know that A. D. (as most townsfolk very. aptly called him) both harbored and nourished some rather lofty political goals for his boys. Yet, be that as it was, Charlie never quite went as far as he might - nor as expected.\n\nHe was reasonably good at his studies while attending Vermilion schools - graduating in 1932. But he was hardly a \"distinguished\" scholar. And he was a reasonably good athlete. He played, and lettered in, both basketball and football during his high school years. But he was hardly a \"distinguished\" athlete; and neither were the teams on which he played.\n\nIn the 1932 high school yearbook “Hi Times\" the football team was memorialized with the following comment: \"... As the season advanced a spirit which is not often seen in losing teams seemed to get into the fellows...\" While the comment was intended to be both polite and positive the gist of it is inescapable. The win-loss record was not memorialized.\n\nAfter high school and college her served in the U.S. Navy during WW2. He later worked in the Ohio State Treasurer's Office in Columbus for a number of years returning to Vermilion in the 1950's to help his aging father and stepmother Frances (Bullok) operate their pharmacy on Division Street. In the meantime his older brother, Dave (A.D. Jr.) had distinguished himself as a publishing company representative, a member of the Ohio State Senate (1937 - 1940); a lieutenant commander in the Navy during W.W.II; and as a Congressman for the 13th District of Ohio (January 3, 1955- January 3,1961).\n\nCharlie's political career, on the other hand, was far less stellar than that of his older brother. Though he was no less charming than Dave, he was considerably more capable - at least intellectually - than his father apparently recognized. The consequence was that he was left to his own devices to fashion a career in politics. He started at the bottom; first as a member of the Vermilion Village Council, and then as Mayor.\n\nDuring Charlie's tenure on council and as Mayor the community was on the verge of an expansion in population and, concomitantly, commerce that was theretofore and thereafter unprecedented. The positive merits of this expansion may, for some folks, be debatable. The inevitable reality was, however, that the influx of new faces and ideas from more urbane environs put an end to the \"colonial-type\" leadership of the past. And Charlie's political career, as well as the pastoral ambience of the place known as Vermilion, Ohio, were forever relegated to a yesteryear few persons now recall.\n\nCharlie died in October of 1973. He had spent the remainder of his years working for the U.S. Postal Service - walking to and from work - a newspaper tucked under his arm, and a cigar clenched betwixt his teeth. The words of that 1932 yearbook seemed to echo in his footsteps: \"As the season advanced a spirit which is not often seen in losing teams seemed to get into the fellows. This spirit was shown in the playing of the team, as a team, and not as just so many individuals.\" Ref: Ancestry.com; Vermilion High School yearbook \"Hi-Times\" - 1932; Special Thanks to Ruth Bauman Tanner; Published in the Vermilion Photojournal 05/22/2008; Written 05/18/2008; Previously published in Views on 12/07/2013.\n\nSOME THINGS YOU LIKELY DON’T WANT OR NEED TO KNOW: I had my wife (Georgi) snap this pic of me working on the Briefs part of the page in my new office site on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe machine beside me is the microfilm reader I use to acquire info from the old newspaper files. I actually dictate from the reader (you can see part of the mic toward the back left of the reader). I ran into a problem when I upgraded to a new computer last year. As a result I found that I was unable to use the audio transcription app (i.e. Dragon Dictate) with Microsoft Word. To my knowledge Nuance (the software provider) does not yet have an upgrade for the system I am currently using. So I fiddled around and found that I could use a different word program with Dictate. Actually I found two – but I am currently using one called LibreOffice when I dictate.\n\nWhen I finish dictating, I copy the text and paste it into the Microsoft program where I can edit / correct the text where necessary.\n\nThe entire process (with or without using Microsoft Word directly) might take me 1 ½ to 2 hours to complete. If I had to transcribe without dictation it would take twice as long. The dictation system allows me time to think and absorb some of the information I encounter.\n\nIt’s definitely a life-long learning experience. Who could ask for more?\n\nHistorically,\n\nVol. XIV, No 44 - VERMILION, OHIO THURSDAY, April 6, 1911 “New” Post Office\n\nThe Vermilion post office has made a number of changes since its existence and the change to the building between the telephone building and the Blattner hardware store brings it a very near where it was some 30 years ago. When Postmaster Kane began his first term in 1880 it was located where Dr. Derr now resides. Shortly afterwards an entire new outfit was installed which has done service until Monday when the new modern office was put into use. Although several postmasters have had the office since 1880, including John Wagner and A. A. Edson the same fixtures were used. These were purchased of the same manufacturer, the McLane Mfg. Co. as the new equipment.\n\nThe new equipment is finished in oak. At the front are the money order and registered letter window and some 120 keyless lockboxes of various sizes including four drawers. Beyond these is the stamp window. At the side first is found a blank wall occupied on the inside by the general delivery boxes also the letter and paper openings for mailing, then comes the call boxes which are similar to those formerly in use. A door separates the remainder of the opening from the inside office. Back of and inside of the boxes and fixtures the postmaster and assistance have ample room to work.\n\nThe rural carriers have a commodious room divided from the main office by a wire net screen and can attend to their duties without interfering with the other office work. The boxes from the old office have been utilized by the carriers to distribute and make up mail for the patrons of their routes. At the rear of the building is a yard where the carrier wagons can be kept while the mail is being prepared to take out.\n\nThe office is lighted by side windows and skylight by day and electric lights by night.\n\nThe new office is certainly up-to-date and just what the town has needed for some time past. Mr. Kane is to be congratulated upon being the one to install it.\n\nA regular U. S. Mailbox has been placed in front of the office for those wishing to mail letters after hours.\n\nThe office will close at 8 p.m. as formerly but the lobby will remain open until 9 o’clock so that those having lockboxes may get their mail until that hour. No loafing in the lobby will be tolerated and if is found that the privilege of having the lobby open is abused it will be closed.\n\nHow different is our new post office equipment from that in use thirty years ago. The present postmaster has been using the old boxes for distributing outgoing mail. A new set will soon take their places.\n\nCharles Andrews has given us some information in regard to the conditions here before the railroad came. When about fourteen years of age he carried the mail through from here to New London on horseback. He was small and at times required assistance to mount his pony. John Wines was postmaster at that time. This was in 1853. Before that time the Stone boys carried the mail to Ruggles, 6 miles from New London, the distance between being 32 miles. Two trips were made each week, one on Monday, returning Tuesday and the other on Thursday returning Friday. The carrier received $315 per year for the service and his board at New London cost him 50c for supper, lodging and breakfast for himself and horse.\n\nSometimes the roads permitted the use of a vehicle then an occasional passenger added to the income.\n\nQuite a history could be written concerning this period.\n\nThe postmasters who served at Vermilion during the period so far as can be ascertained were John Wines, 1853; Mr. Bell, grandfather of Capt. George Bell, 1857; Abe Skillman, 1861; Mel Stone, Henry Baxtine, A. A. Edson, John Wagner and E. M. Kane.\n\nMr. Baxtine who is now night man at the Nickel Plate, served for some sixteen years.\n\nIf anyone has recollection of the mail service at Vermilion in times past the NEWS will welcome them.\n\nAn Old Resident Succumbs\n\nConrad Walper an old and honored resident of Vermilion died this morning at his home on State Street. Mr. Walper was born in Germany nearly 88 years ago. Of his immediate family four sons and three daughters are left. The funeral will be held at the Reformed Church at 1 o’clock Saturday.\n\nCOURTHOUSE NEWS\n\nThe case of Cedar Point Co. vs. William Hendrickson is scheduled for consideration at the hands of Judge Reed Monday.\n\nRefusal to live with him for over three years was the charge brought against Edith Ray Gerber, by her husband, William Gerber, at the hearing of his divorce case in the common pleas court Friday afternoon.\n\nA decree of divorce was granted by Judge Reed. Plaintiff is a resident of Florence Township.\n\nThe Baatz divorce case was on in the court of common pleas Thursday and Friday. Some spicy testimony was offered on both sides. Judge Reed reserved his decision. The parties live in Florence Tp.\n\nCouncil Meeting\n\nThe village council held its regular meeting Monday evening. The several committees reported, there being very little to do these reports were short. The fire committee asked for six pair of boots for firemen and the purchase was ordered made.\n\nThe sidewalk committee reported favorably for a walk diagonally across the public square of Park in the work order done. Some other sidewalk matters were discussed.\n\n[NOTE: I assume the diagonal walk was the one through Victory Park.]\n\nA public dock at the foot of Huron Street was suggested. The matter was referred to the committee.\n\n[NOTE: This is interesting. This must have been a proposal for a dock next to the water treatment plant.]\n\nThe plans for the public comfort station not having been prepared there being several other matters including the ordinance regarding the curbing guttering of Division and Liberty streets in the business section of town were laid over for a special meeting to be held later – probably Monday night.\n\nThe dog ordinance was mentioned and it was suggested that a dog pound be improvised and ordinance enforced.\n\nThe bicycle ordinance was also brought up and another effort will be made to enforce it.\n\nAfter ordering payment of the bills council adjourned.\n\nAn Auto-Boat Factory for Lorain\n\nThe Lorain News states that the Cleveland Auto Boat Company of Cleveland will move its plant to Lorain about September 1. The plant will probably be located west of the city.\n\nThe “Loraine News” gives Mr. Silas Hitchcock who [lives] on the Lake Shore West of Vermilion the credit of securing the big plant as he is financially interested with several substantial Lorain businessmen in the plan. The company has contracts for a large number of boats to be built this year which is given as the reason for not moving sooner. The plant has every chance for success will be a good thing for the city.\n\nNEWS of NEARBY TOWNS AMHERST\n\nCouncil met Tuesday evening.\n\nThe schools opened Monday after a week’s vacation.\n\nChamber of Commerce held its regular meeting Monday evening.\n\nThe Central High School will hold special Arbor Day exercises Friday.\n\nBORN – to Mr. and Mrs. A.

He was an honest, hard-working man, a good husband and kind father. He was first united in marriage to Marilla M. Pierce; to this union one child was born, Marilla Fenton of Ogontz.\n\nAfter the loss of his wife, he was next united in marriage to Louisa Johnson, to which union four children were born; Nellie, Bob, Della and Frank. Once more, death entered his home and took away his wife, and he was again married to Ellen Phelps; two children being born to this union, Henry and Anna. He was the father of seven children, all of whom survive. The deceased had been a sufferer for some time from kidney trouble.\n\nHe was taken suddenly to his bed Friday morning, March 31st, passing quietly away Saturday morning about 3 o’clock; age 77 years, 4 months and 4 days.

Late in the fall she left her home here, as has been her custom for some years past, to spend the winter with relatives at Willoughby and Oberlin. She had but recently come to Oberlin to the home of her daughter, Mrs. Parsons, when taken sick and gradually grew worse until her death, Thursday evening, March 29. And Catherine Baumhart born February 5th, 1830 at Hessen Cassel Germany and came to America in 1836, settling at Vermilion where she has since resided. She was married to William Henry Brooks, November 25, 1852. Mrs. Brooks had reached the advanced age of 81 years, 1 month and 22 days.\n\nIn 1858 she became a member of the First Congregational Church of Vermilion and for all these years been faithful to this covenant. As to seniority of membership she, with one other who survives her, occupied the first place since the death of Mrs. Laura Harris, January 7th. Mrs. Brooks leaves in her immediate family five daughters and two sons, besides numerous other relatives in this community and elsewhere. The body was brought from Oberlin Sunday forenoon and the funeral held from the First Congregational Church at 1:00 PM, conducted by the pastor Dr. Swisher.
