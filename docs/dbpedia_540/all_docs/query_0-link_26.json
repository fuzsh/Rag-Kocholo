In 1851 the father came to America. Prior to this he had been a farmer but in this country he was a laborer.\n\nHe died at the age of fifty-eight years. There were twelve children in the family, evenly divided, and four of them are still living, John George and two sisters in Schuylkill county, and one yet in Germany.\n\nJohn G. Schumacher attended school in his native land and also learned the weaving trade there. In 1861 he came to America, landing at New York city, going thence to Philadelphia and from there to Schuylkill Haven, where he found employment at different jobs. In 1874 he came to Reading and later went to railroading, working for thirteen years for the Pennsylvania Company, between Pottsville and Philadelphia. He then bought a coffee roaster which he operated with ample success up to 1892, when he retired from active business. He lived in his pleasant home at No. 1046 Elm street and owned considerable city property, mostly in the ninth ward, where he had twenty-four houses. He was also in the wall paper business for a time, and had a practical knowledge of many lines. His last years were fully occupied in looking after his real estate investments.\n\nMr. Schumacher was married (first) to Mary Rolland, and they had one daughter, Annie M., who died in 1895, the wife of George Becker. Mr. Schumacher m. (second) Annie Rote, and they had one daughter, Mary, wife of Daniel Parker, a resident of Exeter township, Mr. Schumacher m.

He was a well known and very highly esteemed citizen. In 1892 he made an enjoyable visit of three months in Germany, visiting the scenes of his early life.\n\nSCHUTTER, CHRISTOPHER\n\np. 850\n\nSurnames: SCHUTTER, HAUCK, HOUCK, BRUESTLE, SCHMIDT, MILLER, HOYER, GRIESS\n\nChristopher Schutter, a well known and highly esteemed citizen of Cumru township, Berks county, who now lives retired at his home in Oakbrook, Pa., was born Oct, 30, 1839, in Wurtemberg, Germany, son of Conrad and Christina (Hauck) Schutter.\n\nConrad Schutter was born Dec. 27, 1800, and in 1852 came to America with his family, his oldest son, Christian, having preceded them to this country two years before. Mr. Schutter was a potter by trade, and followed that occupation at Sinking springs, Pa., but in later years he became a gardener. He died April 14, 1890, and was buried at St. John's Lutheran cemetery, Reading, as was his wife. Mr. Schutter married Christina Hauck (born in 1803, died Jan. 11, 1870), and they became the parents of six children: Christian lived in Spring township, and had children, William, Mary, George, Henry and Katie; Frederick, born Jan. 27, 1820, is still living and has children, Ricka, Mary, Catherine, Annie, Frederick, William, Christopher and Maggie; Christina m.

When in his fourteenth year he learned the blacksmith's trade with Michael Miller, of Eighth and Franklin streets, Reading, in whose employ he remained three years. He followed blacksmithing all of his active period, working for some time in the Philadelphia & Reading shops, and for twenty-four years at the sheet mill, being engaged principally in making shear knives. In 1902 he retired from active pursuits, and since that time he has lived in his fine brick residence on Lancaster avenue, Oakbrook, which he has owned since the fall of 1881. In politics he is an independent voter. He and his family are members of St. James Lutheran Church at Reading.\n\nIn 1868 Mr. Schutter was married to Elizabeth Hoyer, born Dec. 20, 1836, who died Oct. 11, 1897, daughter of John and Mary (Griess) Hoyer, of Reading.

The first of this family to settle in Pennsylvania came from Germany, and was married after his arrival in this country, his wife's maiden name being Nye. She was the mother of his son John, the next in line in the branch of the family we are tracing, and died when he was only a few years old. The father afterward moved to Shamokin, Pa., there married again.\n\nJohn Schwartz, born Jan. 11, 1769, died Aug. 10, 1807. In early life he conducted the \"Black Horse Tavern,\" near Adamstown, Lancaster county, and while there met and married Rachel Adam, the founder of Adamstown. She long survived her husband, living until July 2, 1851, being just two days less than eighty-two years old. After his marriage John Schwartz moved to Cumru township, this county, where he bought a farm which he cultivated until his death, which was caused by a fall from a barn door at night; his injuries resulted in his death nine days later. He left five children, namely: Joseph, born Jan. 9, 1797, m. Sarah Homan; Thomas, born Feb. 6, 1795, died at Pine Grove, Schuylkill county, Jan. 11, 1854; William is mentioned below; Peggy m.

In his early life he was a miller, and with his brothers Joseph and James conducted the historic old mill which obtained its water-power from the Wyomissing creek. He owned a farm of seventy-two acres in Cumru township, which is now the property of his son's widow, Mrs. William S. Schwartz. At the time of his death he was a merchant at the northwest corner of Tenth and Penn streets, Reading, being a member of the grocery firm of A. J. & W. Schwartz; his partner was his nephew, Adam H.

She was the mother of three children: William S., Alvin F. (who died unmarried in 1871, aged twenty-eight years), and Henry N.\n\nWilliam S. Schwartz, son of William, born in Reading Dec. 27, 1840, died there Aug. 4, 1895, at his home, No. 25 South Tenth street. He was a well-known business man, having kept a livery stable on Cherry street, below Sixth, for some years, later engaged in the butchering business, and subsequently in the manufacture of cigars in partnership with William Donahower. Later he conducted the \"Three Mile House\" at Shillington for four years, and in 1891 he and his brother Henry built the famous \"Summit Hotel\" on Mount Penn, a spacious three-story stone building of about thirty rooms. It is the grandest to be obtained anywhere in the eastern part of the United States. This hotel is still owned by his widow and brother, the latter conducting it.\n\nMr. Schwartz was twice married. By his first wife, Hannah Bridegam, he had no children. On March 30, 1886, Mr. Schwartz m. (second) Emily S.

Schwartz, youngest son of William, was born March 23, 1846, in Reading, at the corner of Tenth and Penn streets, and was educated in the public schools of the city. On Jan. 29, 1864, he enlisted at Reading in Durrell's Battery (D), Pennsylvania Volunteer Artillery, and served until June 13, 1865. He was in active service in the battle of the Wilderness and at the siege of Petersburg. On a previous enlistment in July, 1863, in Company B, 53d Pennsylvania Regiment, Mr. Schwartz had been in the service for about two months.\n\nAfter the war he engaged in farming, in Cumru township, for eight years, and since 1880 he has been continuously in the hotel business. He has conducted the hotel at Tenth and Penn streets, Reading, the \"Five Mile House\" and the \"Summit Hotel\" at Mount Penn, which he built in partnership with his elder brother, William S. Schwartz, and which he has conducted since 1891. Its picturesque location and comfortable accommodations make it a very desirable hostelry, and it is well patronized the year round. In 1867 Henry N. Schwartz married Mary Bickel, daughter of Elias and Mary (Rothenberger) Bickel, of Heidelberg township, and to this union were born four children: Harry B.; Ella, m. to Charles Sheidy, of New York; Alice; and Minnie, m. to George Leinbach, of Reading. Fraternally Mr. Schwartz is a member of Aerie No. 66 F. O. E., of Reading.\n\nSCHWARTZ, HIRAM H.\n\np. 356\n\nSurnames: SCHWARTZ, BRIDGES. PATTISON\n\nHiram H.

In 1834 he went to Lehigh county and there worked on a farm, and while so engaged attended the local schools until he was sixteen years old. He continued his preparatory education in the Van Derveer Boarding School for several years; then entered Franklin and Marshall College, and after taking a regular course was graduated in 1855. Upon returning home he engaged at teaching public school for two years; and then he was elected school superintendent of Lehigh county, an office he very successfully filled from 1857 to 1860. During this time he took up the study of the law at Allentown, in the office of the Hon. Samuel A. Bridges, and was admitted to practice in 1858. After practising at Allentown two years, he located at Kutztown, and he continued in active practice in Berks county until he received the appointment of Judge of the Orphans' court in June, 1883, from Governor Pattison, which office had been created by a special Act of Assembly; and at the next election for the term of ten years. He officiated until his death Aug. 25, 1891, after a protracted illness. After having located at Kutztown in 1860, he became interested in various enterprises there. He was particularly interested in the cause of education, and identified himself with the establishment of the Keystone State Normal School, which he served a trustee until his decease.\n\nSCHWARTZ, THOMAS H.\n\np. 1016\n\nSurnames: SCHWARTZ, NYE, ADAM, MADEIRA, DAVIS, HOMAN, ROTZMOYER, TEMPLIN, BREIDIGAN, DAVIS, HORNBERGER, DEEDS, CRUMMINS, WIESSER, EYRICH, STEFFEY, RATHMAN, SEITZINGER\n\nThomas H. Schwartz, of Cumru township, belongs to a family long identified with that general section of the State, and one that has from generation to generation been concerned almost wholly with agricultural pursuits.\n\nThe first of the name to settle in Pennsylvania came from Germany, but was married after his arrival in this country to a Miss Nye, who became the mother of his son John. Mrs. Schwartz died a few years after the birth of the boy, and the father afterward moved to Shamokin and there married again.\n\nJohn Schwartz, son of the above and great-grandfather of Thomas H, was born Jan. 11, 1769, and died Aug 10, 1807, aged thirty-eight. In early life he ran the \"Black Horse Tavern\" near Adamstown, Lancaster county, and while there met and married his wife Rachel Adam. She was born July 4, 1769, daughter of Bernhart Adam, the founder of Adamstown. She long survived her husband, as she lived till July 2, 1851, being within two days of her eighty-second birthday when she died. After marriage John Schwartz moved to Cumru township, bought a farm and operated it until his death. This sad event was due to a fall from a barn door at night, causing injuries which resulted in death nine days later. He left five children, viz.: Thomas, born Feb. 6, 1854; Joseph; William, a retired farmer, died at Reading; Peggy m. Nicholas Madeira, of Reading; and James, born June 6, 1805, died Aug. 12, 1879 (m. Susan ---, born June 19, 1814, died aged seventy-six years and eight months).\n\nJoseph Schwartz was born Jan. 9, 1797. For the earlier part of his life he was a boatman, first upon the Schuylkill river and then on the Union canal, but he was also familiar with the milling trade, which he learned at Leesport, and he later turned his attention to that occupation. He operated the Schwartz mill for some time, and then in middle life took up farming, locating in Cumru township, where he owned a tract of thirty acres besides some woodland and a five-acre tract of fine farming land, now forming part of the Joseph Davis estate. Joseph Schwartz married Sarah Homan, born Jan. 14, 1797, daughter of Henry and Mary (Rotzmoyer) Homan. She died Dec. 8, 1870, while Mr. Schwartz survived until Oct. 6, 1874. Their children were: Adam, a merchant in Reading, m. Miss Margaret Breidigan; Emma m. Levi Templin, a prosperous Reading merchant; Sarah died unmarried; Tamson m. Rufus Davis, a farmer in Penn, and later in Cumru township; and Joseph H.\n\nJoseph H. Schwartz was born in Cumru township, Sept. 9, 1834. Brought up to farm work, it became his life-long calling, and from 1857 till his death he was operating on his own account. He began on the old farm, which he afterward brought and made it his permanent home. He also owned a thirty-four acre timber tract in the same township. In 1858 he married Ellen D.

Like all his family he was a member of Yocom's Union Church of the Reformed faith.\n\nThomas H. Schwartz was born on the farm which is still his home, April 10, 1860. Farming interests have always occupied his attention except for one period of three years, dating from the time he was eighteen, as a hatmaker. After his father's death the entire responsibility of the homestead fell upon his shoulders and he has been in charge of it ever since. It is situated on the Wyomissing road with the creek running through it, and is a most valuable property, comprising ninety-three acres. In politics like all the family Mr. Schwartz married Jennie Seitzinger, and they have four children, William, Ellen E., Rufus and Charles. Mrs. Schwartz is a daughter of William R. and Elizabeth (Hahn) Seitzinger.\n\nSCHWEIMLER, ANDREW L.\n\np 1085\n\nSurnames: SCHWEIMLER, MERGET, ANGSTADT, GEIGER, FRANCE, WEIDENHEIMER, SEIVARD, KISTLER, BLOSE\n\nAndrew L.

He was well educated, and for years was a successful teacher, but his later years were devoted to farming on a large scale, and to his work as a director of the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Sinking Spring. His wife was Elizabeth Haller, daughter of Samuel, of Lancaster county. It is given to but few men to so merit and receive universal esteem through a long life such as Samuel Z. Schweitzer has enjoyed.\n\n(III) Frederick Schweitzer, Jr., son of Frederick, was born in Brecknock township, Feb. 20, 1794, and died May 22, 1889, aged eighty-eight years, three months, two days.

He was a farmer for many years, and from 1861 to 1865 owned the \"Three Mile House.\" In his political faith he was a Republican, and in religious belief a Lutheran, and for many years he was a deacon in the Allegheny Church, but late in life he joined the Plow Church, which he helped to build. He served on the building committee, and was an elder there for eight years. He was also instrumental in the erection of the church in 1888, and was a liberal contributor toward its erection, also helping to raise funds. Mr. Schweitzer was a man of genial disposition, and was greatly beloved by all who knew him. He married Mary S. Slouch, born Oct. 31, 1834, died March 2, 1904, in her seventieth year, daughter of George and Elizabeth (Seifrit) Slouch, and granddaughter of George Slouch.

Schweitzer, son of Samuel M., is a representative citizen of Brecknock township. He was born Oct. 24, 1858, on a Slouch farm adjoining the Schweitzer homestead. He grew to manhood on a farm, attending the district schools and later Churchtown Academy, in Lancaster county. The latter institution was then under the able management of Prof. J. F. Foltz. He then taught school for some time and afterward assisted his father on the farm until the latter's death, at which time he assumed the management.

In 1883 Mr. Schweitzer married Sarah A. Kramer, daughter of Samuel and Julia (Ziemer) Kramer, well known citizens of Brecknock township. Two daughters have blessed this marriage, namely: Gertie M., who married Lewis Wickline, trucker on his father-in-law's place, and has one daughter, Esther May; and Mamie E., who is at home.\n\n(II) Peter Schweitzer, second son of Peter, the emigrant from Wurtemberg, married and reared a family, in which was a son, Peter.\n\n(III) Peter Schweitzer, son of Peter and grandson of the emigrant, passed his active life as a farmer and tanner on the place where Harvey Kramer now lives.

By occupation he was a tanner, and his tannery was located where Harvey Z. Kramer now makes his home, in Brecknock. The latter years of his life he devoted to farming, owning a farm of 200 acres in Potato Valley - so named by Christian Ziegler, in a joke, but the name has clung to this particularly rich agricultural valley ever since. He married Elizabeth Wagner, born Feb. 13, 1803, who died May 9, 1888. They had nine children, namely: Benaniah, who owned the homestead; Maria, who married Jacob Schnader, of Fairville; Lovina and Jackson, who both died young; Nathan, of Lycoming county; Augustus W.; Edward, a farmer in Robeson township; Obed, also a farmer in Robeson; and Christianna, who married Benjamin Remp, of Brecknock. John Schweitzer and his wife erected in 1854 a fine double-deck barn, 92 x 75 feet, the only one of its kind in the State. In 1859 the present residence, a large stone mansion, was erected. On the premises is an old log house that was erected in 1775 by Peter Schweitzer, the great-great-grandfather of the present generation, and this is now used as a truck house.\n\n(V) Benaniah Schweitzer, son of John, was born at the family home Feb. 20, 1829, and after a useful and active life of more than seventy-seven years passed away Sept. 16, 1906.

He was early trained to farm work, and remained at home, assisting his father, until he attained his majority. He continued at home working for wages from that time until 1892, when he took a trip through the West, going to San Jose, Cal., where he was in the employ of the famous lawyer, D. M. Delmas, recently so much in the public eye as the defender of Harry K. Thaw in New York City. Mr. Schweitzer remained there for a period of three years, working in the vineyard. In the latter part of 1905 he went to St. Paul, Minn., and from there to Faribault, Minn., where he remained from July to November of that year. His western trip was quite a success, and as well a most enjoyable experience. Returning to his native county, he began farming the original homestead of the family in Brecknock township, which consists now of 210 acres of the best land in this section. He and his brothers are successful farmers and truckers. They attend the Reading market once or twice a week the whole year round.\n\nIn political belief Mr. Schweitzer is a Democrat, but he has given little time to public affairs, his own business engrossing his entire time and attention. However, he was induced to serve one term as township auditor. He is a Lutheran member of the Allegheny Union Church. He was president of the Maple Grove Sunday-school, and was also organist for a time. He is a worthy representative of an intelligent family, and is a man of sound judgment and of considerable tact and ability in dealing with his fellow-men.\n\n(VI) Harry K. Sweitzer, son of Benaniah, and brother of Emery, was born June 29, 1881. He grew up on the farm and after attending the township schools entered the Adamstown high school, then in charge of Prof. Henry Matz. In the spring of 1898 he entered the Keystone State Normal School, at Kutztown, in the E Division, but left as a Junior in 1900 to engage in farming. He began for himself in 1907. In politics he is a Jeffersonian Democrat, and in 1906 he served efficiently as register assessor of his township. He is a Lutheran member of the Allegheny Church, and has been an official member of that Sunday-school. In 1907 he married Mary E. Zerbe, daughter of William and Ellen (Frees) Zerbe, of Brecknock township, Lancaster county.\n\n(VI) Theodore Schweitzer, son of Benaniah and brother to Emery and Harry K., was born on the home farm on Aug. 4, 1883. He obtained a fair education in the Maple Grove school, and early learned the duties pertaining to the successful management of a farm. In 1907 he and his brother Emery bought the father's fine farm of 210 acres, and this they now jointly cultivate. In May, 1904, Mr. Schweitzer was married to Viola Kramer, daughter of Harvey Z. Kramer, a well-known tobacco dealer. Mrs. Schweitzer is a highly educated woman. She attended the Keystone State Normal, and taught school before her marriage, two terms at the Maple Grove school and two terms at Gebhart's school. Mr. and Mrs. Schweitzer have a son, Mark D., born Oct. 19, 1905. They are Lutheran members of the Allegheny church, and in politics he is a Democrat.\n\n(V) Augustus W. Schweitzer, son of John and brother of Benaniah, is the merchant and postmaster at Hummel's store, Brecknock township. He was born May 30, 1839. He was a farmer's son, and he has not departed from his early training, but has devoted his entire life to agricultural pursuits. He owns a tract of seventy acres and attends the Reading market. In 1872 he purchased his property from Daniel Hummel, after whom the post-office was named, and he began trading in merchandise on a small scale. Since then he has conducted the store and served as postmaster. As a Democrat like all the Schweitzers, he has taken an interest in public matters, and has been school director of the township. He and his family are Lutherans, and attend the Allegheny Union Church. In 1869 he was married to Mary Ann Paulsgrove, who was born May 1, 1847, daughter of Jacob and Anna Mary (Rintz) Paulsgrove, and eight children were born of this union, namely: Annie, who married Fred Mint, of Brecknock township; Ella, who married Mahlon Ziemer, a sawmill proprietor of Brecknock; Howard A., at home; Irwin J., who married Bessie Sengner, and lives in Brecknock; Irene, wife of Henry Ziemer, of Brecknock; Raymond A., a mute, at home; Emanuel, who died in infancy; and Elva, at home. The family are very popular in the community.\n\np. 1379\n\nSurnames: SCHWEITZER, SCHWARTZ, TROSTLE, BRENDEL\n\nFranklin K. Schweitzer, of Spring township, Berks county, who makes a specialty of fruit growing and trucking, is a member of the Schweitzer family which has been so long represented in Brecknock township, and which is fully mentioned elsewhere in this work. Mr. Schweitzer was born in Brecknock township, Sept. 14, 1875, and was brought up on his father's farm there, from boyhood being familiar with agricultural work. When twenty-four years old he learned the hatter's trade at Hendel's hat factory in Hendleton, and later he learned the wool hat business at Spatz's hat factory, in Mohnton. He followed this line of work for four years, and since the spring of 1904 has been engaged at farming, having then purchased the C. H. Schwartz farm, near Textile, in Spring township. This place comprises thirty-five acres of valuable land, in fine condition, and Mr. Schweitzer has given special attention to fruit growing and the raising of truck. He also keeps excellent live stock, and he disposes of all his products in the Reading market, having stands Nos. 21 and 22 on West Buttonwood street, at the Market House. Mr. Schweitzer keeps his place up well, having good buildings, a substantial barn which was erected in 1898, and a neat lawn around the house, his surroundings indicating thrift and industry.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 1899, Mr. Schweitzer was married to Miss Cassie Trostle, daughter of Levi and Lizzie (Brendel) Trostle, and to this union have been born two children, Lillie May and Violet Elizabeth, the latter of whom died when five months, nine days old.\n\nSCHWERINER, S. S.\n\np. 1413\n\nSurnames: SCHWERINER\n\nS. S. Schweriner. Among the enterprising business men of Reading, Pa., who have built up a large and thriving industry from the humble walks of life, may be mentioned S. S. Schweriner, one of Reading's leading shoe dealers, who is a native of the northern part of Germany.\n\nMr. Schweriner received his educational training in the schools of his native country, where he remained until 1870, there learning his trade. In the year mentioned he arrived in New York and traveled throughout the United States, finally choosing Reading as his place of residence, establishing himself in business at No. 432 Penn Square, where he has continued to the present time. Mr. Schweriner's start in business life was in a small way, but his natural executive ability in connection with his prosper, and the business has gradually increased in size, until he now employs thirty-seven skilled salespeople and custom workers. His footwear is of the finest quality and workmanship, and finds a ready market all over the surrounding country, and Mr. Schweriner is very fond of travel and has made two trips to Europe, the first one in 1890 and the second in 1906, when he visited his old home in Germany, and many points of interest in the old country. He is a public-spirited citizen, recognized in the different charitable and other institutions, and he has won the esteem of all who know him well.\n\nSCHWEYER, DANIEL HELFRICH\n\np. 1535\n\nSurnames: SCHWEYER, SWEYER, SCHWOYER, HELFRICH, KLEINGER, HOMER, KEYSER, KEMP, BOGER, HOCH, SMITH, BITTENBENDER, LEISS, YOUNG, LANDIS, HERTZOG, MILLER\n\nDaniel Helfrich Schweyer, a representative citizen of Berks county residing at Bowers Station, operating one of the largest granite and marble works in the country, senior member of the firm of Schweyer & Leiss, manufacturers of monuments, and president of the Laurel Hill Lumber Company, of Somerset and Fayette counties, was born on his grandfather's homestead, Feb. 29, 1836, son of John and Elizabeth (Helfrich) Schweyer.\n\nThe name Schweyer has been variously spelled by the different branches, and even by members of the same family. Tradition says the original home of the family was in France and that about the middle of the eighteenth century there came to America four brothers, Christian, Heinrich, Samuel and Esau Schweyer (Sweyer or Schwoyer). But from authentic sources found in the Heraldic Library at Vienna we glean the following account of the Schweyer family, their origin and place of settlement.\n\nThe Schweyer family sprang from Pomerania, the eastern province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and the founder of the same was living in the year 1172. His name was \"Edgar Schweyer,\" which name in the ancient Pomeranian language meant \"saint.\" He held the office of Fellerber (that is, \"high priest\") of the clan of the Obetuter. His residence was on the island of Hiddensoe. His wife, \"Thorga,\" was the daughter of a count from the island of Rugen. Edgar was a brave warrior. On his shield he bore an eagle with outspread wings, the symbol of courage and sagacity. On his helmet he wore two buffalo horns, the symbol of the god Woden, representing great strength. These symbols were also assumed by his descendants, as their coat of arms. Edgar in the year 1172 was converted to the Christian faith and baptized by the German missionary Orosius. He died on the island of Hiddensoe, A. D. 1213. He had three sons, namely: Pelagin, Orosius and Anagas; the two first named entered a monastery. Orosius had large possessions on the island of Hiddensoe and Rugen, and his descendants were still flourishing in the same place at the time of the Emperor Sigismund. About the year 1412 two brothers of the family, Wendel and George Schweyer, were the only persons surviving of the name. Their descendants were still flourishing about the middle of the sixteenth century in Pomerania, and were still maintaining the old title of nobility. At the time when the glorious King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, arrived at the court of Pomerania, two of the members of this family joined him at Hallem, these being Felix and Conrad Schweyer. Felix was killed in an assault on the city of Frankfort, near the river Oder. Conrad remained in the army during the war, which lasted thirty years, and finally settled at Rebuick, in the Dukedom of Hessen. He married Francisca Kleinger, dropped his title of nobility and lived as a farmer at Rebuick. He died in the year 1672. The name of his son was Augustus Schweyer, farmer and hotel keeper at Rebuick, whose wife was Elizabeth Homer. He died in 1713, leaving three sons, whose names were: Nicholas, Leopold and Christopher Schweyer. From there the family spread over the Dukedom of Nassau, Hesse Frankland (Franklin) and the grand duchy of Baden.\n\nPresumably from one of these sons comes the branch in Maxatawny township, through Nicholas Schweyer, great-grandfather of Daniel Helfrich Schweyer. He was born Oct. 18, 1721, and died March 25, 1800. His children were: George; Jacob, who was recruiting officer in Philadelphia, and served as lieutenant in the 5th United States Infantry, during the war of 1812; Peter, who died in 1828; Christian, mentioned below; Henry; Nicholas, whose son Nicholas was given the old family Bible by his grandfather; Valentine, and Barbara. Nicholas Schweyer, the great-grandfather, was an officer in the Prussian army. He was gathering arms and flannels to come to America to trade with the Indians, when he was arrested by the government and charged with inciting insurrection. He was disfranchised and his estate confiscated. He escaped and came to America, bringing with him the family Bible. His family followed him in care of a brother some years afterward. He was proved innocent and the franchise restored, but the estate was not looked after and was yet to be recovered.\n\nFrom \"30,000 names, German, Swiss, Dutch, French, Portuguese and other immigrants in Pennsylvania,\" edited by I. Daniel Rupp, Harrisburg, Pa., 1856, we learn that Nicholas Schweyer came to America, Oct. 4, 1752, on the ship \"Neptune,\" Capt. John Mason, from Rotterdam, last from Cowes. Johannes (John) Schweyer came Oct. 13, 1768, on the ship \"Betsy,\" T. Hank, captain, from Rotterdam, last from Cowes.\n\nChristian Schweyer, son of the emigrant Nicholas, was born in 1780, and he made his home in Maxatawny township, where he was a farmer in early life, and later became an innkeeper at Rothrocksville. His wife was Elizabeth Keyser, born in 1784. He died in 1856, and she in 1858, and both are buried at Zion's Church in Maxatawny township. Their children were: Jonathan; John; Peter; Christian; Elizabeth (m. Isaac Kemp), and Matilda (m. a Mr. Boger). The Kutztown cemetery gives the record of two other children, that is \"Zwei kindern von Christian Schweyer & seiner Eha Gattin, Elizabeth born Keyser,\" Jacob, born Oct. 19, 1805, died Jan. 11, 1827, and Esther, born Dec. 23, 1808, died Feb. 12, 1824.\n\nJohn Schweyer, son of Christian, was born in Maxatawny township, in 1800, and died in 1893, at the age of ninety-two years. In his youth he learned the duties pertaining to a farmer's life, and that occupation he followed during his active years. When he was nearing seventy years of age he retired, living at Rothrocksville. He was an official member of Maxatawny Zion's church, belonging to the Lutheran congregation, and is buried there. His first wife was Elizabeth Helfrich, who died in 1844, aged thirty-four years. She was a daughter of Daniel and Elizabeth (Hoch) Helfrich, of Lehigh county. Nine children were born of this union, as follows: James; Allen; Henry; Daniel Helfrich; Jacob; Alfred; Francis; and George and Mary, who both died in infancy. Allen, Daniel H. and Francis are the only survivors of the family. The Christian name of John Schweyer's second wife was Elizabeth.\n\nDaniel Helfrich Schweyer, son of John, was born in Maxatawny township on the property now owned by Alfred H. Smith. He attended the old pay schools of his day, and later was a pupil at Freeland Seminary, now Ursinus College. He also attended the Normal class at Reading, conducted by Profs. Lee and Bechtel, for one term. He taught school for six consecutive terms, beginning in Siesholtzville, and later teaching in Red Lion, Maple Grove and near Harlem, all in Hereford and Longswamp townships. At Siesholtzville he learned the stone cutter's trade from D. Y. Bittenbender, a brother-in-law, remaining there for three summers, while in the winters he still followed the teacher's profession. In 1856 he succeeded his brother-in-law in business and there continued for six years, when he came to Bowers Station, enlarging the scope of his business. At the same time in 1862, he was elected organist at Bowers Church, and he served in that capacity for sixteen years. When he moved to Bowers he formed a partnership with Levi H. Leiss, under the firm name of Schweyer & Leiss, to engage in the wholesale marble business. They also took up the iron ore business near Bowers, employing in both lines some thirty men. The iron business proved a source of profit for about ten years. In 1882 the firm purchased the marble quarries and mills at King of Prussia, in Montgomery county, and they now employ there as many as 125 men. They also owned and operated the Easton Marble and Granite Quarries at Easton, Pa. After the death of Mr. Leiss in 1902 Mr. Schweyer purchased the interest of the estate, and the plant at Easton was organized under the name of Henry A. Schweyer Company. The plants at Bowers and at King of Prussia are still conducted under the old firm name of Schweyer & Leiss. The Henry A. Schweyer Company is a corporation capitalized at $150,000 common stock and $50,000 preferred. They have a great deal of foreign trade.\n\nMr. Schweyer is also president of the Laurel Hill Lumber Company of Somerset and Fayette counties. On the land belonging to this company there are large deposits of bituminous coal, which is mined in great quantities. Mr. Schweyer operates a portable sawmill in Berks county, where he manufactures lumber of various descriptions. He owns a valuable farm of 125 acres, known as the old Hunter homestead and located one and one-half miles southeast of Bowers in Rockland township.\n\nIn politics Mr. Schweyer is a strong Democrat, and has always been active for his party's welfare. His first political office was that of school director of Maxatawny, in which he served with honor for six years. He was justice of the peace of his township for fifteen years, settling important controversies. He has settled up many estates, being executor, or administrator, and he has been guardian for a number of children. His term as justice of the peace ended only in 1888 with his becoming prothonotary. To the last named office he was elected with the largest vote given to any candidate on the ticket. He was made an elector by the State convention, representing the Ninth Congressional District, in 1888. In 1894 he was appointed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction a trustee of the Keystone State Normal School, a position he continues to occupy.\n\nFraternally Mr. Schweyer is a member of Huguenot Lodge, No. 377, F & A. M., Kutztown; Reading Chapter, No. 42, R. A. M.; DeMolay Commandery, No. 9, K. T.; and he was a charter member of Lyons Lodge, No. 634, I. O. O. F. With his family he belongs to Christ Reformed (De Long's) Church, at Bowers, of which he is an elder at the present time, and is also secretary of the consistory, besides having been treasurer of the church for a quarter of a century.\n\nMr. Schweyer was married, Feb. 6, 1856, to Catharine Bittenbender born April 16, 1836, daughter of Jacob and Susanna (Young) Bittenbender, of Hereford township. She died May 8, 1859. The only child of this union, Mary, died in childhood. Oct. 18, 1862, Mr. Schweyer married (second) Catharine Landis, daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth (Hertzog) Landis, of Landis Store. Seven children were born to this union: Samuel and Anna, twins, who both died in childhood; Henry A., connected with his father in business, who married Maria Bittenbender, and has three children - D. Herbert, J. Leroy and Katherine M.; Harvey L., born in 1867, and died in 1891; Nora L., who m. Dr. W. T. Miller, of Wayne, Pa., and has a son, E. Dismant; Katherine L.; and Solon L., born 1874, and died in 1901.\n\nSCHWOYER, COSMOS MERKEL\n\np. 708\n\nSurnames: SCHWOYER, NEFF, SCHNEIDER, HOCH, PETER, HERBEIN, ROTHERMEL, MAURER, SEAMAN, KELCHNER\n\nCosmos Merkel Schwoyer, one of the very prominent citizens of Fleetwood borough, Berks county, who lived retired after the year 1876, was born Sept. 27, 1825, in Richmond township, on his father's farm situated along Moselem creek, and died in August, 1906.\n\nMr. Schwoyer was brought up on the farm and attended the public school near the Moselem Church. When he reached the age of seventeen years, besides assisting in the farming operations, he engaged in dealing in cattle and sheep, which he collected in Reading and adjoining townships and disposed of them at Pottsville, in Schuylkill county, driving them there on foot several times a year.
