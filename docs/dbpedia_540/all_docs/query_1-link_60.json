The funeral took place Friday.\n\nMADIGAN, TOM Tom Madigan, a former Centerville farmer, met death by drowning at Hayward, Wis. His remains were brought to Cleveland for Burial. Oshkosh Daily Northwestern, Thursday, Feb. 27, 1919 page 6 ********* News of the drowning at Hayward of Tom Madigan, a former resident of Cleveland, has been announced. Other than that Mr. Madigan was drowned Saturday and that the body has been recovered no details have been received and a brother, Joseph is at Hayward to bring the remains to Cleveland for burial. Mr. Madigan was a farmer and for a number of years had made his home near Hayward. He was 64 years of age and was well known at Cleveland where he lived until a few years ago. It is expected the funeral will be held from the home of his brother, Joseph Madigan at Cleveland today. Sheboygan Press, Feb. 27, 1919 page 6 ********* (Could find no confirmation that he was buried in Centerville. But did find this: All Hayward was shocked Saturday when it was learned that Thomas Madigan had drowned during the noon hour in the Namakagon river. It appears that Mr. Madigan had gone to the river for a load of ice. A crew of men working on the landing on returning from their dinner noticed the team but could not see any one around. Their suspicions being aroused went down on the ice to investigate and there found a hat and one mitten floating about on the surface of the waer. As the water was clear, they plainly could see a body lying at the bottom. It was immediately brought to the surface and identified as that of Mr. Madigan. It is presumed that while he was attempting to break the cakes of ice apart, he plunged into the water after an attack of heart failure. Thomas Madigan was 67 years of age, being born at sea while his parents were enroute from Ireland to this country. His early life was passed at Manitowoc. His is survived by his wife, of Minneapolis, and three sons, Mike of Seattle and George and Earl of Iowa; two brothers, Mike of Manitowoc and Joseph of Superior; five sisters, Mrs. Sullivan of Manitowoc, Mrs. Landon and Mrs. Lyons of Chicago and Mrs. Gries and Mrs. Liebert of Menomonie. Funeral services were held at the St. Joseph's Catholic Church Wednesday morning, Rev. Father Habraken officiating. Relatives attending the funeral were his wife of Minneapolis, sons George and Earl of Iowa, brother Mike and sister, Mrs. Sullivan, both of Manitowoc. To those who knew Mr. Madigan best, there is little doubt that the outstanding feature of his character was his true love for his boys. He was a man well liked by all who knew him--a man who dismissed the mistakes and failures of yesterday with a laugh, convinced that everything would come out all right. Malice nor revenge found no place in his philosophy of life. He was reconciled to the will of that high power which he had always recognized and respected. The community extends sympathy to the bereaved relatives in their hour of grief. Sawyer County Record Feb. 27. 1919 ******** (Note: Located Thomas Madigan on the 1870 Town of Meeme Census with parents, Michael and Catherine. He was 16 at the time. Parents and brother, Michael are buried in St. Isidore, Meeme twp. but could not find Thomas there or in any Town of Centerville Cemetery.)\n\nMADSON, ANDREW Notes From Liberty. Andrew Madson, an old settler of Eaton, died at the home of his sister, Mrs. Peterson, last Thursday, age 79 years. His death was due to pneumonia. The funeral took place Monday afternoon from the Norwegian Lutheran church near Valders. Manitowoc Pilot, January 23, 1908 P. 8\n\nMAENSCH, UNKNOWN SUICIDE. An old man named Maensch made a desperate attempt at suicide last week, and one which will probably be successful. He was for some time a resident of this city and owned a house and lot here which was mortgaged. Last week he was notified that the mortgage would be foreclosed. Maensch did not have the means of redeeming the mortgage and resolved to kill himself. He went into the woods, carrying with him a butcher knife, which was rather dull. With this he cut his throat from ear to ear, but strange to say, did not sever any artery. The cut in the font part of the throat was so high that it did not sever the wind pipe. He also made an attempt to open the artery at his left wrist. He cut clear to the bone, severing the tendons so that the ends stuck out, but even here the arteries were unhurt, owing to the knifes being dull and the arteries elastic. The old man selected a spot in the woods where the foliage was dense, and where there was considerable fallen timber.Here he remained for one day and a half. He was found on Wednesday, and not until Thursday was a physician called in. Dr. Pritchard describes the wound was one of the most ghastly he ever saw.The chin had retracted at the throat and it appeared as if the mans neck was cut half way through. Maggots had formed in the cut, but strange to say the man was alive. There are no hopes of his recovery entertained. This is certainly one of the most determined and bungling efforts at self destruction ever made. Manitowoc Pilot, June 19, 1879 P. 3 ***** Menske, the old man who attempted to commit suicide June 9th, by cutting his throat and severing the tendons of his arms in trying to open the arteries is very low and no hopes are entertained of his recovery.

His friends do not believe anything bad has happened, merely that he has done as he says, \"Wenn das Geschäft nicht geht, gehe ich.\" (Loosely, \"when business don't go, I go \"). Der Nord Westen, 18 Dec. 1902 and Manitowoc Daily Herald, December 12, 1902 P. 2 ******** THREE WITHIN A MONTH Another Disappearance Reported, Henry Maker, Candy Butcher, Being Absent One. MISSING FOR SEVERAL DAYS Had Often Made Threat To LeaveRelatives Are Not Alarmed, Believing He Will Return In Time-Business Was Not a Success. New scenes and conditions have been sought by another Manitowoc man, the third to disappear within a month, Henry Maker, a well known candy butcher of the city, having departed for parts unknown. Maker has been numbered with the absent for several days and nothing has been heard from him. Relatives have no anxiety for his welfare, believing that he had planned he departure and that he will return in time. Numerous times within the past year he had threatened to make a change, being dissatisfied with the conditions here. Nothing is known of the present whereabouts of the absent man, although it is thought that he may be in Chicago or Milwaukee. Maker came here several years ago and engaged in business on a small scale. He is an experienced candy butcher and succeeded in building up a good patronage and from year to year extend his business gradually. For the past several months he had conducted a store on North Eighth street, but the trade did not meet his expectations and he was dissatisfied. He had made several attempts to locate a large business, but lack of finances was an obstacle he was unable to overcome. He had the reputation of manufacturing wholesome candies and for some time was alone in the field as far as conductng an exclusive candy kitchen. Recently two new kitchens have been opened and this was a source of anxiety to Maker who appreciated the fact that the city was too small to support the number. This is believed to have had a great deal to do with his determination to get out. The store is now in charge of Henry J. Pauli and has not been closed. Years ago Maker was wealthy and had considerable property in the state of Michigan, but mismanagement and reverses with which he met left him almost penniless and when he took up his home here he was without funds. It is reported that of late he had experienced financial difficulties. Another misfortune with which Maker was saddled was ill health and for many months during his early residence here he was afflicted with rheumatism and scarcely able to get about Manitowoc Daily Herald, December 12, 1902 P.1 ****** (1900 Manitowoc census Ward 4: Henry Maker age 47, confectioner; wife Anna age 40; Della age 22; Myrtie age 21; Charles age 17; Glenn age 14; Bessie age 9; Hazel age 3) ******* (1905 Manitowoc state census: Henry Maker age 53; wife Anna age 47; Della age 27; Charles age 21; Glen age 19; Bessie age 13; Hazel age 8; Lern age 4) ******* (1910 Manitowoc census Ward 4; Anna Maker age 51; Charles age 26; Hazel age 13; Lee age 9) The surname is not on the Manitowoc 1920 census.\n\nMALLANEY, JAMES From Der Nord Westen, 16 Apr. 1891: Sudden death of 67 yr. old James Mallaney in Town Maple Grove on Sunday\n\nMALLICK, FANNIE From Der Nord Westen, 15 Aug. 1889: (From the correspondent in Kiel, 13 Aug.)

She is sleeping, the sleep of the dead. Do you wish to wake her, loved ones, Take her from her rest with God, Back on earth to journey onward On the path your feet have trod? No, I think, though 'tis lonely; Kneel and kiss the chastening rod, Saying, \"Not as I wish to have it But as thou hast, Oh! my god.\" We a rugged road must travel But we too must reach that geal. Check the tears that you would lavish Think how happy is her soul. She but went to meet the others Who have crossed some time before. Now she is with other loved ones Waiting till we too come o'er. So while on earth we must yet linger And temptations they will come, Shun them till by God we're summoned Then we'll meet our darling one.

Fire in Two Rivers - Two Children Burned to Death From Mr. John Wright, the Two Rivers mail carrier, we obtain these particulars of a most heartrending occurence: About five o'clock last Friday afternoon a fire broke out in a barn belonging to Mr. Gottfried Berger, in Two Rivers. The flames speedily communicated to an adjacent house, owned and occupied as a dwelling by Frank Boutin, and to another barn owned by Jos. Gagnon. The engine and hook and ladder companies soon arrived on the ground, but too late to save the property from destruction. Before the fire was extinguished, a painful rumor became current that two little children - one a son of Frank Boutin, aged four years, and the other, aged five years, a son of the widow Martell - were in the burning barn. The firemen and citizens redoubled their efforts to subdue the flames, and when they had suceeded, an investigation of the ruins confirmed their worst fears. The lifeless bodies of the unfortunate little fellows were found lying on some wet and partially burned straw, in one corner. Both bodies were horribly burned and disfigured, and only one, that of little Boutin, could be recognized. When the body of the other child was lifted up, one of its legs dropped off. It is supposed that the children went into the barn unobserved, and, shutting the door, built a fire on the floor. No outcry was heard, and they were probably suffocated by the smoke before the flames reached them. Mr. and Mrs. Boutin were absent at Green Bay visiting at the time, and Mrs. Martell supposed that her child was safe at home. Milwaukee Daily Sentinel, June 04, 1870, Issue 131, col. F.

Accordingly, Mr. Turner, accompanied by under Sheriff Pierce and Doctors Patchen and Martin, preceded on Saturday to the place in question, called in a jury, made a careful examination of the corpse, during which it was found that through disease one side of the heart had become softened and a verdict was brought in that Dennis McCarthy came to his death by heart disease. Having performed their duties, these worthy men then returned, and this closes the first chapter of our story. On Friday a man presented himself at the shop of Newell A. Davis of Cato, and, in a jovial manner, left an order for him to widow Driscoll, take the measure of a corpse and make a coffin, and then went jollily on his way. This created some little excitement at that lively little place, where, after some trouble, the following facts were obtained: | Dennis McCarthy was a gay young son of Erin, of pleasing figure, more than usually intelligent, of a free and roving nature, and at the time of his demise, possessed between $700 and $1000 in bank bills, and had about four weeks previous appeared at the widow Driscoll's. Now the widow Driscoll has been in her day quite a character, she being the centre of a little society who used to assemble at her house and receive much exhilarating and elevating spirits. And it used to be reported that there were very few who could beat her at a joke, whether it were drinking \"forty rud\" on a wager, or in holding a full hand in \"draw.\" But, of late, she has ceased to solicit Uncle Sam for permission, and her premises have assumed a more somber appearance, and not much more was known of her, save when she made, as she never failed to do, her periodical visit to Manitowoc. It was on one of these that she met Dennis McCarthy, and to all appearance it was a genuine case of \"love at first sight,\" for they sat up all night and went home together in the morning. Dennis had just before received toward $1000 in ready money, and it was to wonder that the widow's heart warmed toward the unprotected stranger, or that the winning ways of the Queen of Hearts and of Spades should have effectually ensnared poor Dennis. At least they went home together, and from this time nothing special is known of them except that two Irishmen report that Dennis offered to send them money, but did not succeed until his brother, who owns a farm in Meeme, and another living in Liberty, were notified of his death. Delirium Tremens was the cause which the bereaved widow assigns, asserting that, during a fit of insanity, he took all his money and tearing it all to pieces, burnt some of it up, in proof of which she is ready to show in a handkerchief some pieces. It being generally believed that a legal operation had made them man and wife, she was asked about it, but answered on oath that it was not so; she had some contract about releasing the widow's farm, whereby some money had been paid, but this she denied intoto.

The murder occurred sometime after the vessel had left Hamburg for return to the states. The body was not recovered. Details of the tragedy were received in wireless messages to the offices of the steamship company, which were relayed to Capt. Con McCauley, father of the dead man and for years an employee of the Goodrich Transit company as captain of the steamer Carolina. Full report of the murder of the McCauley can not be obtained until the Patrick Henry reaches New York on August 8. Brother Sends Wire Here Messages were received here last night from Patrick McCauley, brother of the murdered man from his home at Milwaukee, telling of the report. He is employed as a salesman for the Invincible Metal Furniture company of this city and advised the offices here of his return to Milwaukee to be with his mother who is seriously ill as result of the death of her son. Capt. Con McCauley, for years a resident here where with his son Frank, he sailed Goodrich Boats, is in command of the Graham & Morton line steamer Benton Harbor operating out of Chicago and received news of the tragedy there. The family home is at Milwaukee where Mrs. McCauley was notified. Letter Reveals Danger Only the bare facts that Mr. McCauley had been lost overboard on July 18 and that murder was suspected were contained in the dispatch received by Capt. McCauley, but recent letters received by the victims fiancé to whom he was to have been married on his return to the states, said that he was having trouble with four of his crew members and declared he feared they would attack and kill him at first opportunity. The letter was written a short time before the Patrick Henry sailed from Hamburg, Germany. According to the letter received by Miss Hansen, the fiance of the victim, and which she forwarded to Capt. McCauley from her home in Brooklyn, McCauley had been having much trouble with two Spanish and two Russian Bolshevik members of his enginemen crew. Recently on the out voyage, he had them placed in irons for insubordination. That is why we are inclined to believe that my brother was murdered and cast into the ocean, explained Mrs. Walter Lord, sister of the victim, who arrived from her home at St. Paul to visit her mother late in the day. The telegram also intimated that the death might have been the result of foul play.\" Besides his father and mother, the victim is survived by four brothers and one sister. He was the youngest chief engineer in the United States merchant marine service.

Letters written by McCauley to the girl he was to wed at Jersey City upon his return, stated that he feared that he was to be made the victim of foul play because of having ordered four members of the crew into irons for infraction of rules.

Meyer was an old and esteemed resident of this city, having settled here upwards of 35 years ago, and by an upright life won the confidence and esteem of a large circle of friends. He was born in Euiten, Holstein, August 18th, 1816 and came to this country in 1852, coming to Two Rivers to live in a few months after landing on our shores. He was a carpenter by trade but since 1871 he was a manufacturer of cigars. His funeral was a large one and was under the auspices of the Sons of Herman to which order he belonged. H.

The body was brought to Two Rivers and from there buried alongside her husband who died 15 yrs. ago.\n\nMEYER, DAVID The remains found on the beach near Mann's pier have been identified by a memorandum book found upon his person to be those of David Meyer, a man about 25 years of age, who was drowned by falling from the mast head of the schooner Sea Gem, lying at anchor in the bay, on the 1st of May, 1873. The remains were first discovered shortly after the man was lost and a Justice of the Peace in the town of Newton held what he called an inquest, but failed to report the circumstances to the proper authorities. The memorandum book, several pictures and other contents of the dead man's pockets were distributed among those who helped to bury him, and had the waves not washed the dirt from over the bones, it is probable that the parents of the unfortunate man, who reside in Sheboygan, would never have known where his last resting place was.

Manitowoc County Chronicle, Tues., Nov. 30, 1897\n\nMIRSCOSH, FRANK Instantly Killed Frank Mirskosh(sic), a sober, industrious Bohemian, residing in the Town of Cooperstown, accompanied by a young son, left his house last Friday morning and walked to this city, the object of his visit being the payment of a debt he owed here. He transacted his business in the city and was on the point of returning home the way he came when chance threw him in the way of a man, with his team, was about to go to the vicinity of Mirskosh's home and offered him a ride. He accepted the offer and mounting the high \"spring\" seat of the lumber wagon was soon on his way home. It appears that the man with whom he was riding was drunk; that just after passing the toll gate, the team after which Mirshkosh was riding was forced into a race with another coming up behind it, that it was driven furiously for a short distance, when one of the wheels coming in contact with a log on the side of the road, the wagon box and seat were jarred to such an extent that Mirskosh was thrown out upon the ground, falling in such a position that the wheels of the hindmost wagon passed over his face before he would recover himself. The result was that the unfortunate man was instantly killed, nearly the entire head being crushed in a horrible manner. The fiends who were driving the horses with a brutality almost unparalleled, did not even stop their horses to ascertain the extent of the injuries sustained by their passenger and only slacked up sufficiently to allow the victim's son to jump out and see to his father. When he reached him, life was of course extinct and the only thing to be done was to have the body conveyed to this city where a coroner's jury viewed him and returned a verdict in accordance with the above. The remains were placed in a coffin and conveyed to Cooperstown the following day. This victim of the carelessness of a drunken driver was about 45 years of age and he leaves quite a family to mourn his sudden and terrible death. We have thus far been unable to learn the names of the parties who owned the teams, but it is hoped that some measures will be taken to bring them to account for their inhumanity, drunkenness and fast driving on the public highway.

It seems a boy named Lyman Mosher about 14 years of age employed in the Mill went down to the lower floor for the purpose of shutting off some of the motion, some part of the machinery connected with the gate being out of order. The lever which closed the gate was on the farther side of an iron shaft which was making about one hundred revolutions per minute, and which was about three feet high. The proper way to do was to go under the shaft and then shut the gate, but the boy being tall for one of his age reached over, and it is supposed while in this position his coat a blouse would round the shaft and in a moment he was revolving at a fearful rate. It is unknown how many times he went round but probably a great many. The boy was not missed, but one of the belts happening to break the foreman of an upper room went below and the first thing he saw was the boy's clothes wound about the shaft. Looking around he heard a groan proceeding from the ice some twelve feet below. Calling for help, the boy was soon brought up into the engine room where it was found that his head was badly bruised, the flesh torn from his right arm and the bone broken, his right leg broken just below the hip, the left below the knee, and every stitch of his clothing save one shoe and stocking torn entirely off and left on the shaft. In this condition he laid on the ice with thermometer 10 below, until both his feet were frozen--probably fifteen minutes. Medical aid was summoned and everything done for the boy that could be, but after terrible suffering he died Saturday at 1 o'clock. The funeral was held at the residence of his brother, Mr. Alfred Mosher, on Sunday and was largely attended by sympathizing friends.

On Friday last a Bohemian named Mroskosh(sic), a resident of the town of Cooperstown, met with sudden death on the Menasha plank road about a quarter of a mile west of the toll gate. It appears that the unfortunate man in company with his son, a lad of about fourteen years of age, were on their way home, and were riding in the wagon of a neighbor called Kuchera. Kuchera started in company with another team owned and driven by a Mr. Linefelt of Kossuth. On leaving the city Linefelt started ahead, Kuchera following close both going at a rapid pace. Kuchera trying to pass Linefelt, who, however, kept the lead. After they had got through the toll gate they overtook a team loaded with sand; they hauled to the right hand side to pass on a full gallop; and just as Kuchera's team was passing the load of sand the off front (sic) wheel of his wagon struck a log and threw Mroskosh out of his wagon. The sand wagon passed over his head and crushed his skull. Surgical aid was immediately sent for, but the unfortunate man was dead before it arrived. The accident seems to have been the result of the common reckless practice (of which too many of our farmers are guilty), of racing and fast driving on their way home. We hope this sad occurrence may teach them a lesson, and that they will be more careful in the future.
