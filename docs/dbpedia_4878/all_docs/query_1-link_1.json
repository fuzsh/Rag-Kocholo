        "text": "First Look Studios was a former American independent film distributor, that specialized in home video releases of films and television series.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1980, Robert and Ellen Little founded Overseas Filmgroup as a film sales company for foreign markets. Overseas Filmgroup expanded towards film financing to give the company greater control over its output. From the beginnings, it competed with fellow, also-defunct film producers J&M Film Sales (later J&M Entertainment), Manson International and Producers Sales Organization as the most successful company with film sales.\n\nOverseas Filmgroup decided to paid $3 million in order to set up operations for different areas such as Spain, Arizona, Texas, Taiwan, Italy, southern California and Colorado in the mid-1980s, and by 1986, the company became active, setting up a number of domestic theatrical, home video and television syndication sales with New World Pictures and other distributors.\n\nIn 1987, while other sales companies is gaining production outfits, the Littles told that they would avoid production, so Overseas Filmgroup had set up a company policy that they would acquire new films via distribution advances, and the three new movies, namely those directed by Roland Emmerich, will be offered to various Mifed buyers. The company is the original international home video distributor for the show Tales from the Darkside, until it was sold off to Lorimar-Telepictures in late November 1987 after Lorimar International president Jeff Schlesinger saw all episodes of the show that was well-suited and combined to become eight ninety-minute episodes from the show.\n\nFilms ranged from genre titles such as Blue Tiger (starring Virginia Madsen) and No Way Back (starring New Zealand actor Russell Crowe) to art house films, including Antonia's Line, Mrs. Dalloway, The Secret of Roan Inish, Waking Ned Devine, and Titus. In 1993, the company expanded towards North American distribution through its First Look Pictures subsidiary.\n\nIn 1998, Overseas Filmgroup went public. Two years later, EUE/Screen Gems acquired a minority interest in the company. In January 2001, as part of a restructuring, Overseas Filmgroup and First Look Pictures became subsidiaries of First Look Media. Overseas Filmgroup was eventually renamed First Look International. Robert and Ellen Little left First Look in 2003.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, after a merger with Canadian businessman Henry Winterstern's Capital Entertainment, the combined company became First Look Studios. Winterstern became CEO of First Look and shared the role as chairman with EUE/Screen Gems' Chris Cooney. In November 2005, First Look acquired DEJ Productions from Blockbuster.\n\nIn March 2006, First Look acquired Ventura Distribution, a home video distribution company, and acquired the domestic television syndication rights to fifty six films from Pinnacle Entertainment. By 2006, First Look had a seven hundred film library to its own name, and continued to add more with the financing of in house productions. Henry Winterstern resigned from First Look in March 2007. The organization started out First Look Television, a TV syndication company in 2006.\n\nThat March, Nu Image acquired the rights to First Look. In November 2010, Millennium Entertainment acquired First Look's assets. Currently, the company had been dissolved.\n\nFilms[]\n\n10 Items or Less (released theatrically by ThinkFilm)\n\nAll About You\n\nAmerican Adobo\n\nAn American Crime\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters (the only animated film by the company)\n\nAs Good as Dead\n\nAugust\n\nBack in the Day\n\nBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\n\nThe Breed\n\nA Brother's Kiss\n\nChopper\n\nChrystal\n\nCool Dog\n\nThe Contract\n\nDanika\n\nDay of the Dead\n\nDay Zero\n\nDedication (co distribution with The Weinstein Company)\n\nEat Your Heart Out\n\nErnest Goes to Africa (re released by Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment)\n\nErnest in the Army (re released by Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment)\n\nEvelyn (co-distribution with United Artists)\n\nFinding Rin Tin Tin\n\nFirecracker\n\nFlu Birds\n\nForty Shades of Blue\n\nFour Sheets to the Wind\n\nFrank\n\nFreeze Frame\n\nA Gentleman's Game\n\nGlass Trap\n\nGod's Gift\n\nA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\n\nHydra\n\nImmortal (United States distributor)\n\nIn a Dark Place\n\nInfinity\n\nJourney to the End of the Night\n\nKill Switch\n\nKing of California\n\nKing of the Avenue\n\nLabor Pains\n\nLeaves of Grass\n\nLeo\n\nA Little Trip to Heaven\n\nA Map of the World\n\nMarcello Mastroianni: I Remember\n\nMayor of the Sunset Strip\n\nMeet Bill\n\nMinotaur (co distribution with Lionsgate)\n\nMiranda\n\nMonster (co distribution with Newmarket Films, Media 8 Entertainment and DEJ Productions)\n\nMrs Dalloway\n\nMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?\n\nNature Unleashed: Tornado\n\nParis, je t'aime\n\nParty Girl\n\nThe Prophecy (co distribution with Dimension Films)\n\nThe Pumpkin Karver\n\nRelative Strangers\n\nThe Secret of Roan Inish\n\nSex and Breakfast\n\nSilence Becomes You\n\nSmiley Face\n\nStiletto\n\nSukiyaki Western Django\n\nTara Road\n\nTarget of Opportunity\n\nThe Thing Below\n\nThick as Thieves\n\nThis Is The Sea\n\nTrading Mom (co distribution with Trimark Pictures)\n\nTranssiberian\n\nThe Volcano Disaster (also called Volcano: Nature Unleashed)\n\nWar, Inc.\n\nDistributed lines[]\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\n\nVideo Asia\n\n[]"
