        "text": "Mornin! This is Sean McNulty (connect with me on LinkedIn here if ya like), and here‚Äôs the Hollywood + Media news to know on THURSDAY, August 8, 2024.\n\nWhere the parent company of IHOP and APPLEBEE‚ÄôS said it attracted more customers with $100k+ incomes in Q2 (hint: they‚Äôre the ones who pay in $100 bills).\n\nIt also saw increased demand for ‚Äúvalue menu‚Äù items from all customers as well ‚Äî including something called ‚Äúunlimited riblets‚Äù that I‚Äôm sure Richard could explain to me.\n\nDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm sure these folks won‚Äôt think twice about paying more for streaming services, the NBA & local sports in the year ahead ‚Äî I mean as we all know, unlimited riblets are just hard to resist. . .\n\nAND: Add A Different World to our #2024RemakeBonanza! list, as NETFLIX has put a Full House-ish continuation of the series in development, centering on the daughter of Whitley & Dwayne‚Äôs characters.\n\nD‚ÄôOH: More bad news for old legacy media ‚Äî UNITED is shutting down Hemispheres magazine! Is nothing sacred?\n\nYEAH: NYC now has more than 1M sq ft. of empty retail space that only used to house pharmacies. Don‚Äôt worry, things are goin‚Äô great in NYC real estate.\n\nEXHIBIT 143: On how Hollywood should really be putting more focus on Latino audiences. They made up 91% of the population growth in the 3-year period, post-Covid.\n\nWAKEUP BOX OFFICE POLL\n\nIt‚Äôs always nice when our sense of Hollywood‚Äôs self-importance and the title of the weekend‚Äôs big new movie debut coincide, with It Ends With Us from SONY.\n\nSentiment is all over the place, from about $25M on the low side, to up to $40M+ from the optimists, based on huge pre-sales.\n\nCable TV core cracks at WBD in Q2 2024\n\nWell. That Q2 report was something. I‚Äôll start with these two observations:\n\nIncluding ‚ÄúAdult Swim Q2 primetime ratings grew 14% year-over-year‚Äù as a top-line accomplishment for a quarter at a major Hollywood studio in the 2024 media business says a lot about the state of your business.\n\nWriting off $9.1 Billion in a quarter, and not even directly addressing that on your earnings call until . . . minute17 of that earnings call, says a lot about the state of company leadership. I know the boat‚Äôs sinking, but look at the embroidery on the curtains!\n\nSo, let‚Äôs look at:\n\nThe state of the linear TV and streaming ad markets and #cordcutting decline\n\nWhy #SurviveTil26 appears to be the mantra at WBD\n\nThe new thinking around gaming\n\nWhy that +3.6M Q2 streaming subscriber growth isn‚Äôt as healthy as it looks ‚Äî and some key üí∞ comps to note\n\nHow & why did we get to this low point in the first place . . . and what‚Äôs lacking about the messaging that came forth from management yesterday\n\nNow, unlike the approach taken on the earnings call ‚Äî let‚Äôs first look at what excising $9.1B from WBD‚Äôs value is all about."
