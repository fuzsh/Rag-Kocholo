        "text": "1st Logo\n\n(September 21, 1995-2001)\n\nLogo: We see a light blue, stylized F made of two triangles. The words FIRST LOOK PICTURES, each below the other, appear one after one. Below is the byline: \"A Division of Overseas Filmgroup\".\n\nFX/SFX: The words appearing.\n\nVariant: There is a variant with RELEASING below, shown on the trailer for Keep the Aspidistra Flying.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. Appears on A Map of the World, Antonia's Line, and other films, but some international releases contain the Overseas logo.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\nLogo: We see light blinks on a small glass sphere. It zooms out and being cut in half, along with the distorted triangle to the left. The words \"FIRST LOOK\" with \"MEDIA\" appear below.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere's a variant in which INTERNATIONAL appears in place of MEDIA. This version has the byline, \"A Division of First Look Media\" below.\n\nThere is a version with PICTURES below. It also has the byline.\n\nFX/SFX: The glass lens effects and lights, probably with some live action.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Soft chime bell sounds.\n\nAvailability: Can be seen on films by First Look Media. The \"PICTURES\" variant is rare and can be found on Doctor Sleep, Skins and Lawless Heart. This also plasters or (not often) precedes the Overseas Filmgroup logo on recent domestic prints of its films.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(2006-2010)\n\nLogo: We see an image of a sea at sunrise with clouds moving. Then, the area around the screen darkens, and a bright flash occurs. We see an image of a green eye. The lens flare moves off to the right as \"FIRST LOOK STUDIOS\" fades in above and below, respectively.\n\nVariant: There's a variant in which PICTURES appears in place of STUDIOS. This is usually seen on trailers.\n\nFX/SFX: The sea, the clouds moving, the lens flaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A short piano tune that ends in a 5-note orchestral fanfare.\n\nAvailability: Can be seen on First Look Studios films from the era. The Pictures variant made a surprise appearance on Aqua Team Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters."
