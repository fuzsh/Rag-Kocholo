I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly\n\nsurprised by all aspects of this film. It looks great and benefits from many strong\n\nactors. I would recommend this to all my friends.\n\nThis film has a great cast. Good performances by Kristy Swanson (from Buffy\n\nthe Vampire Slayer), Vincent Spano, Tony Todd, and Bruce Boxleitner; one of\n\nmy favorite TV actors, from Scarecrow and Mrs. King. Even the little girl,\n\nDeVeigh Chase, is very believable. Pretty good suspense. Check this one out.\n\nCAST\n\nKristy Swanson ~ Dr. Julia Craig\n\nVincent Spano ~ Det.

Sellers\n\nPlot Summary\n\nIt is November 1992 and the US Navy is preparing to surrender its\n\nlargest overseas facility at Subic Bay, Philippines, after almost a century.\n\nFor both countries, and for the navy, it is a time of change. With\n\nmanpower low US Navy SEALS are helping protect the base, including\n\nWilliam Hawk (John Haymes Newton), John Stryzack (Corin Nemec)\n\nand Paul Bladon (Alexis Arquette) headed by Commander Hamilton\n\n(Wolfgang Bodison). Olongapo City, beside the base faces an uncertain\n\nfuture. Lisa Velasquez (Nanette Medved) is part of the local Mayor's\n\nteam that wants to turn the base into a new city. Emma Salazar (Alma\n\nConcepcion), a one-time bar-girl now engaged to marry Bladon, sees her\n\nown future under threat with the impending arrival of Bladon's senator\n\nfather, (Mike York) and Bladon's American girlfriend, Angela (Maureen\n\nFlannigan). For Hawk, the quiet, thoughtful professional on his last tour it\n\nis a time of decision and he finds himself in conflict with the prickly Lisa.\n\nLisa herself is facing the abandonment of her mother, Anna (Daria\n\nRamirez) by her American stepfather, Ed Johnson (James Brolin).\n\nEmma's innocent sister, Maria (Angel Aquino) arrives unexpectedly\n\nplanning to find herself an American boyfriend, to Lisa's dismay. A tragic\n\nincident during a beach party leads to an investigation by Special Agent\n\nDanzig (Rae Dawn Chong) of the Naval Investigative Service and her\n\nopposite number, Jess Santiago (Raymond Bagatsing). Meanwhile,\n\nStryzack is brooding over what he believes is a betrayal of America.\n\nUnder arrest, he escapes from prison, sworn to assassinate the symbol of\n\nAmerica's betrayal, Senator James Bladon.\n\nCAST\n\nWolfgang Bodison ~ Commander Hamilton\n\nCorin Nemec ~ John Stryzack\n\nJohn Haymes Newton ~ William Hawk\n\nRae Dawn Chong ~ Special Agent Danzig\n\nJames Brolin ~ Ed Johnson\n\nMichael York ~ Senator Bladon\n\nMichael D. Sellers ~ Special Agent Cooper\n\nUser Comments: Disappointing.\n\nUser Rating: 5.0/10 (88 votes)\n\nCritics all over the country expressed their dismay over this film, which received\n\nhuge theatrical release in 1997 but ended up a disappointment, both critical and\n\nbox-office. The story of three sisters who lived during the afternath of the U.S.\n\nBases' exit in the country in 1991 was, honestly, suited primarily for a TV-movie\n\nslot. Poorly-written dialogue, amateurish performances (from the American\n\ncast)and a predictable plot didn't gave justice to the film's undermining potential.\n\nThe director (Thierry Notz) and the American cast are just a product of\n\nlow-profile U.S. movies and their performances show. A disappointment from\n\nABS-CBN. 5/10\n\nLegacy (1998/I)\n\nDirected by ~ T.J. Scott\n\nWriting credits ~ James Grady (story) ~ Kevin Lund\n\nProducers: many including Michael Sellers\n\nGenre: Action\n\nPlot Outline: A dedicated war photographer joins a beautiful Eurasian girl on a dangerous quest for her legacy.\n\nUser Comments: Hasselhoff! Manila!

Sarna\n\nWriting credits Bob Couttie\n\nProducer: Michael Sellers\n\nGenre: Action\n\nUser Comments: Something to watch at 2:00 AM\n\nUser Rating: 4.7/10 (41 votes)\n\nCAST\n\nJoe Lara ~ Jack Logan\n\nUdo Kier ~ Max Gast\n\nJanuary Isaac ~ Dyna Castenada (as Sandra Gomez)\n\nBrigitte Nielsen ~ Elizabeth Gast\n\nUser Comments:\n\nSummary: Something to watch at 2:00 AM\n\nKeeping it short, I've seen worse movies but I've also seen much better ones.\n\nIt's kind of a by the numbers low-budget pseudo-Bond flick and would have\n\nbeen better livened up by giving it to Andy Sidaris and have him cast Julie Strain\n\nas the hero, at least there'd a hot amazon chick in there. Actually, Brigitte\n\nNielsen and Julie Strain would be a pretty good match-up, both being over six\n\nfoot tall and having an Amazonian charisma and beauty. Since that didn't\n\nhappen, we get another low-rent Bond-clone. Maybe the lead would have been\n\nbetter in a better movie, having no rehearsal and only one to two takes often\n\nmakes the cast in these films seem much worse actors than they actually are. If\n\nyou can't sleep and it's on cable, it might keep you mildly entertained.\n\nLocations: Subic Bay, Philippines\n\nViewer Summary: Great action... bad dialogue!\n\nI rented this for the director... I knew it would be action\n\npacked, but figured on low-budget tripe... it had a great\n\nlook and feel, too bad he wasn't given a better script to\n\nwork with, IE: \"The 'Prime Minister'\" lines... what a hoot.\n\nEven with the poor dialogue and spots of bad acting, I\n\nenjoyed the film, it just needed some more explosions! I\n\nlook forward to Sarna's future efforts. BTW: What is up\n\nwith T.J. Storms' wardrobe?! he looked like a pimp from\n\nStarsky and Hutch, not a well bred killer!\n\nSummary: A no budget James Bond wantabe.\n\nAn action picture with lots of explosions , no production\n\nvalues and flat acting in a plot that is only an excuse to\n\nblow up things.\n\nThe film looks to be a video transfer in 16:9 format with\n\nlots of artifacts in the result, but I must admit I could not\n\nwatch the thing to the end to see what equipment was\n\nused.\n\nThe story is a mish-mash of revenge, saving the earth,\n\nand the diabolical villain wanting to blow up the earth.\n\nThe \"story\" is not helped by the flat performances by a\n\nhost of actors who have appeared in a large number of\n\ngood films; Brigette Nielson, however is the name above\n\nthe title and does not seem to have learned a thing about\n\nacting during her career.\n\nhttp://www.moviebank.biz/quantum.htm\n\nThe Relationship Between the Companies\n\nMovie Bank and Quantum Entertainment\n\nFormed in 1996 by Producer Michael Sellers and Film Distribution veteran Pamela Vlastas,\n\nQuantum Entertainment is an established global distributor of feature films. Since 1996\n\nQuantum has maintained an office and staff at 3599 Cahuenga Blvd. West, adjacent to Universal\n\nStudios in Los Angeles. Also, in an industry where films are licensed to foreign distributors at 3\n\nmajor film markets each year (The Cannes Film Festival and Market, The American Film Market\n\nin Santa Monica, and MIFED Film Market in Milan) Quantum has maintained a selling office at 20\n\nconsecutive film markets dating back to the Cannes Film Market of 1996. For it's services as a\n\ndistributor, Quantum earns a distribution fee ranging from 15 - 25% of gross sales. Quantum\n\nis well known to industry professionals as a medium sized distributor of quality motion pictures\n\nand has on going strategic relationships with producers, territorial distributors and foreign\n\nco-producers. visit Quantum Entertainment\n\nMovieBank\n\nFormed in 2001 under Managing Member Michael Sellers, MovieBank manages a diverse\n\nportfolio of film investments which are made according to a strict, pre-established criteria that follow\n\nsystems and procedures for entertainment investment which were developed by major US Banks including\n\nBank of America and Imperial Bank. MovieBank makes loans to films which are already either completed\n\nor in post production, with these loans amounting to no more than 25% of the total cost of the film.\n\nMovieBank recovers it's investments in first position ahead of all other investors. A portion of\n\nMovieBank's portfolio (limited to 20%) is also allocated for secured investments in film equipment and\n\ntechnology which is rented to (and earns revenue from) the producers whose films are receiving\n\nMovieBank investment.\n\nThe Quantum-MovieBank Strategic Joint Venture\n\nThrough it's Strategic Joint Venture Agreement, Quantum and MovieBank work together under a\n\nsystem that benefits both parties. Under this agreement, MovieBank uses it's financial resources to\n\nacquire film rights and guide these films into the Quantum pipeline. Once in the pipeline, Quantum and\n\nMovieBank share the commissions and fees that are generated. Under a typical scenario, Quantum will\n\nearn a distribution fee of 20%, with 75% of this (15% of Gross) going to Quantum and 25% (5% of Gross)\n\ngoing to MovieBank. The arrangement benefits both companies in the following ways:\n\nn MovieBank : Through it's alignment with a distributor - in this case, Quantum-MovieBank is\n\nable to leverage its participation in the films performance. Instead of earning only a fixed interest\n\n(which is what the Bank's earn when they make similar loans), MovieBank earns a unique 'Triple Play'\n\nconsisting, typically, of fixed interest of 10% APR, Share of Distributor Commission amounting to 5%\n\nof Gross Revenues, and a 50% share of Quantum's overall corporate Net Income. MovieBank also,\n\nthrough it's close relationship with Quantum, is able to directly monitor all transactions, collections\n\nand movements of funds in a way that it would not normally be able to, thus enhancing the security of\n\nit's investments.\n\nn Quantum : Through it's alignment with an investing entity such as MovieBank, Quantum\n\nis able to obtain a higher volume of product for its distribution pipeline. This in turn generates\n\nhigher sales volumes overall, plus greater Distribution Fees and Commissions. Having\n\nearned higher commissions and net profits as a result of MovieBank's investment, Quantum is\n\nable to share portions of this additional income with MovieBank.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, both parties to the Joint Venture benefit from it, and have a demonstrable vested\n\ninterest in seeing both the Joint Venture succeed, as well as in seeing both of the entities involved\n\nin the joint venture succeed.\n\nBIO\n\nMr. Sellers attended the University of Delaware on a football scholarship and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1975 with a degree in English and Ancient Greek. He was a Rhodes Scholarship and Danforth fellowship finalist before attending New York University's Graduate School of Film Master of Fine Arts program. Mr. Sellers' development as a film-maker was interrupted for 10 years from 1979-1989 when he served as an operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency. During his time at CIA, Mr. Sellers served at U.S. Embassies in Warsaw (1980-81), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (1981-83), Moscow (1984-86), and Manila (1986-1990).

The first international film produced by Mr. Sellers in the Philippines was Fortunes of War starring Martin Sheen, Michael Ironside, and Haing Ngorr.\n\nMr. Sellers then established a partnership with ABS-CBN, the top broadcast and cinema company in the Philippines, to produce three films-Goodbye America (1996) starring Michael York, Rae Dawn Chong, and James Brolin; Legacy (1998) Starring David Hasselhoff and Academy Award Winner Rod Steiger; Doomsdayer (2000) starring Joe Lara, Brigitte Nielsen, and Udo Kier. During this time Mr. Sellers also established himself as a successful entrepreneur, funding and establishing three successful restaurants, an in-flight catering company, and serving as the Asian regional director for Kroll-O'Gara, a NASDAQ listed security services and technology company.\n\nIn 1996, while producing Goodbye America, Mr. Sellers partnered with distribution professional Pamela Vlastas to launch a Los Angeles based global film distribution company, Quantum Entertainment. Since 1996 Quantum has conducted worldwide distribution of all of Mr. Sellers' films as well as more than a dozen other films including Joe Wolf's Children of the Living Dead. In 2000 Mr. Sellers relocated to Los Angeles and continued producing and directing films under Quantum. In 2001 he created MovieBank LLC, a film completion fund which works in coordination with Quantum to acquire and distribute films, and in 2002 he wrote and directed the feature film VLAD starring Billy Zane, Brad Dourif, and Paul Popowich."
