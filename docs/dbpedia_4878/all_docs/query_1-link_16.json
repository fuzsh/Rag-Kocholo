        "text": "The X-men universe has been… challenging to follow over the years. It’s been 24 years since the first X-Men movie released back in the year 2000 and since then we’ve had all sorts of time travel shenanigans, a reboot series that was eventually reconnected to the original movies and now, thanks to Disney buying Fox and rolling the X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe — as confirmed in Deadpool & Wolverine — now we’ve also got a bunch of multiverse stuff to contend with too.\n\nSo, let’s get all these timelines straightened out with our guide to the X-Men movies in order. We’ve put together the chronological list since that’s the one that’s hard to follow, but there is also a release order list at the bottom of this page too.\n\nThere have been some high points, and definite low points along the 24-year road which has given us 14 movies. We’ve had stone cold classics like X2, First Class, Logan, and Deadpool alongside some absolute stinkers like X-Men Origins Wolverine and X-Men: Apocalypse. But we’re not here to judge them today, we’re just untangling the timelines. If you want more great Marvel content, check out our guide to the Marvel movies in order, or our list of the best Marvel movies.\n\nOh and some book-keeping here; we’re not counting Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness as an X-Men movie, despite the cameo appearance of a certain wheelchair rocking, smooth -domed telepath. We’d say it’s a movie with an X-Man in it — it’s not an X-Men movie. OK bub, enough foreplay — here’s our guide to the X-Men Movies in order.\n\nX-Men movies in chronological order\n\nX-Men: First Class\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse\n\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix\n\nX-Men\n\nX2: X-Men United\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand\n\nThe Wolverine\n\nDeadpool\n\nThe New Mutants\n\nDeadpool 2\n\nLogan\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\n1. X-Men: First Class\n\nRelease date: June 3, 2011\n\nCast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence\n\nWe’re already kicking off our list with a disclaimer about the number one spot. If you want to get technical, then X-Men Origins: Wolverine has scenes set in 1845, but the bulk of that film doesn’t take place until later. That’s why First Class, set mostly during 1962s Cuban Missile Crisis, is your safest bet for the first chronological X-Men film.\n\nYou’ll see the humble beginnings of the X-Men team, as well as the blossoming turbulence of Prof X and Magneto, watching as they transition from best friends to mortal frenemies.\n\nFun Fact - X-Men Origins: Magneto was the original plan, but First Class took its place.\n\n2. X-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nRelease Date: May 23, 2014\n\nCast: Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender\n\nAnother contentious piece of chronology here, as Days of Future Past takes place in both 1973, and “The Future” simultaneously. With the return of both the original, and prequel actors, as well as a smattering of fan favorite characters, Days of Future Past promises action, confusion, and really horrendous hairstyles.\n\nThis mid-franchise take on the iconic comic book story was generally well received by both critics and audiences, as it rang out with the new Marvel cinematic style.\n\nFun Fact - For those of you who want a little extra, check out “The Rogue Cut”, a version of the film that adds Rogue to the main roster.\n\n3. X-Men Origins: Wolverine\n\nRelease Date: May 1, 2009\n\nCast: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston.\n\nIn a blink and you miss it cameo in First Class, you’ll spot Wolverine in a bar, telling Prof X and Magneto to “go f**k themselves”. Just a few years later, chronologically, we come to Wolverine’s origin film, set mostly in 1979.\n\nA series of flashback scenes starting in 1845 take us through almost every major war that Wolverine was a part of, up until his character defining adamantium surgery. We also get Ryan Reynold's first appearance as Deadpool here, but the cursed monkey paw version of it - don't worry, they correct their mistakes down the line.\n\nFun Fact - Wolverine actor, Hugh Jackman, confessed his dislike of the film. He felt it didn’t go deep enough into the character, and said it felt like a fourth X-Men film, with different characters.\n\n4. X-Men: Apocalypse\n\nRelease Date: May 27, 2016\n\nCast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender,Oscar Isaac\n\nIn Oscar Isaacs first of two different Egyptian Marvel characters, X-Men: Apocalypse sees the updated X-Men team fight off against the titular villain, Apocalypse. Another point of contention as this film does open with a sequence in 3600 BC, but sees 1983 taking over both the plot and the fashion choices. The reception for this film split audiences pretty much in half, some loved the classic villain, and others felt it was overloaded with action. We’ll let you make up your own mind.\n\nFun Fact - Olivia Munn was a fan of her character Psylocke before filming, and requested she wore the comic accurate, purple suit.\n\n5. X-Men: Dark Phoenix\n\nRelease Date: June 7, 2019\n\nCast: Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan, Jennifer Lawrence\n\nClosing out the prequel films is another attempt at the Dark Phoenix storyline. We’ll see Jean Grey become the Phoenix again, but for this attempt we’re confronted with an alien invasion, and another change in the Mystique style. For this film, she’s a soft corn-flower blue, but her suit is yellow … and red.\n\nFun fact - This is the first X-Men film since 2000 that doesn’t involve Hugh Jackman as a main character, or in a cameo.\n\n6. X-Men\n\nRelease Date: July 14, 2000\n\nCast: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen\n\nThe film that started it all! Set in the same year as its release (2000) this was the first official X-Men film, if not the sixth chronologically. It might get a little confusing to watch, as many of the characters have changed, and the timeline has been cut and stuck back together a few times since this film's release. But the nostalgia factor is high, and Sir Patrick Stewart hasn’t aged a day.\n\nFun Fact - Although famous for their in film chess matches, neither Patrick Stewart nor Ian McKellen knew how to play - a chess master was brought in to teach them.\n\n7. X-2: X-Men United\n\nRelease Date: May 2, 2003\n\nCast: Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden\n\nPicking up where the last film let off, X2 takes place in the very same year as the previous instalment. Colonel Striker kidnaps Prof X, and we’re all left wondering “How will Wolverine make this about him?” and in a shocking twist - he does. New characters include Lady Deathstrike, and Nightcrawler. Both of whom pay their way with great fight scenes.\n\nFun Fact - Openly gay actor, Sir Ian Mckellen, worked with production to make a scene where parents find out about their child's mutation as similar to a “coming out” conversation as possible.\n\n8. X-Men: The Last Stand\n\nRelease Date: May 26, 2006\n\nCast: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen\n\nThe final of the three original X-Men films, and this was the first attempt at the Dark Phoenix storyline. Jean Grey returns with her powers buffed up, and ready to take on the new mutant cure. This is also the last time on this list that you’ll the X-Men team together. From here on out, it’s all spin-offs, and alternate timelines.\n\nFun Fact - Kelsey Grammar was so interested in playing Hank McCoy/Beast, that he auditioned for the first time in over 20 years.\n\n9. The Wolverine\n\nRelease Date: July 26, 2013\n\nCast: Hugh Jackman, Rila Fukushima, Tao Okamoto\n\nDoes this film even exist? Technically yes, but in an even more technical way, no, not at all. Because of the plot in Days of Future Past, the events of this film were ret-conned out of existence, and if you want to watch it’ll really be just for fun. Of course, the majority of this film takes place in Japan, because Wolverine is a notorious nerd when it comes to the country. With some of his comic children/clones coming from there, depending on the universe.\n\nFun Fact - In a bonus scene, released on Blu-ray, Yukio presents Logan with his classic, comic accurate, yellow suit. The scene was cut, much to the dismay of fans.\n\n10. Deadpool\n\nRelease Date: February 12, 2016\n\nCast: Ryan Reynold, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein\n\nRyan Reynold's take on the fourth wall breaking merc with a mouth is included in this list, since it includes X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead.\n\nWith a few brief shots of the X-Mansion, this film earns its place a little tenuously, but as the first R-rated mutant film it's well worth a watch.\n\nFun Fact - The Deadpool film had been shelved for a long time, with Reynolds playing the character in Origins: Wolverine. When test footage was leaked, the fan reaction was so great that the studio just had to take it forward.\n\n11. The New Mutants\n\nRelease Date: August 28, 2020\n\nCast: Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton\n\nTaking place in the XCU this film follows a set of mutants kept in a mental institution for the sake of their “safety”. Magik, Cannonball, Sunspot, Wolfsbane, and Mirage team up to escape their fate, and take on their own issues too. If you love giant demon bears, and some really unnerving villains, then this movie could be the X-Men experience for you. Though originally planned to be a 90s flick, it ended up taking place in 2017.\n\nFun Fact - Originally planned as a horror trilogy, sequels are looking unlikely because mutants are being incorporated into the MCU.\n\n12. Deadpool 2\n\nRelease Date: May 18, 2018\n\nCast: Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Ryan Reynolds\n\nThis film earns its place a little more on this list than its predecessor. With long scenes in the X-Mansion, plus a cameo from the prequel X-Team. It’s another complex time travel web, with Josh Brolin’s “Cable” jumping throughout the timeline to murder, save, and look ripped as hell. We also get a bevvy of celebrity cameo’s from Brad Pitt, Bill Scargaard, and more, not to mention introduction of fan-favorite Domino.\n\nIn another meta twist, Deadpool himself jumps through time to make a load of changes to the continuity of both the films' chronology, and the real world.\n\nFun Fact - A third Deadpool film is in the works, so check back here to see how it fits in the X-Men movies in order.\n\n13. Logan\n\nRelease Date: March 3, 2017\n\nCast: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen\n\nThe final film for this X-Men movies in order list take us to the year 2029, where mutants are nearly extinct. This particular story comes from the “Old Man Logan” comics. Introducing the Wolverine clone Laura, or “X-23”. The film marks the final appearance of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and was his most intense film physically. Logan is older, weaker, but no less dangerous, and the action sequences are some of the finest in the XCU.\n\nFun Fact - Dafne Keen (X-23) was too young to shoot some scenes inside a casino, she was green screened in, or they used her body double who was over 18.\n\n14. Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nRelease Date: July 25, 2024\n\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin\n\nWith Disney’s acquisition of Fox back in 2019, Deadpool (and the X-Men) is now officially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie does a lot of work to integrate the merc with a mouth into the established canon, with Deadpool using the time device he got at the end of Deadpool 2 to jump through time and across the multiverse trying to find some meaning in his life.\n\nThis brings him into contact with the Time Variance Authority (TVA) from the Loki show, and as the title suggests, eventually he unites with Logan aka Wolverine. The two team up to save their reality from destruction, with plenty of hijinks and fourth wall-breaking along the way. Obviously with the TVA and Deadpool’s time-travelling, it’s tough to place this chronologically, but it’s definitely set after the other movies within the multiverse storyline.\n\nFun Fact: Hugh Jackman had originally said Logan would be his last outing as Wolverine, but chose to return for this movie because \"I just wanted to do it, and I felt it in my gut\".\n\nX-men movies in release order\n\nIf you'd rather watch the X-Men movies in release order, we've got a list below to help you out there too. It's a lot easier to follow, because we haven't invented time travel in the real world yet."
