        "text": "It was 10 years ago this month that the world lost the legendary Robin Williams. To honor his passing, Vanity Fair spoke to more than 20 people who knew and loved him—and one of the most heartwarming stories shared came from his Mrs. Doubtfire co-star, Sally Field.\n\nAs Field explained, she was on the set of the 1993 hit when she got the news that her father had passed away.\n\n\"I never shared this story before,\" said Field, 77. \"I was in the camper outside of the courtroom where we were shooting the divorce scene. My father had a stroke a couple of years before, and was in a nursing facility. I got a phone call from the doctor saying my father had passed, a massive stroke. He asked if I wanted them to put him on the resuscitator. I said 'No, he did not want that. Just let him go. And please lean down and say, ‘Sally says goodbye.’' I was of course beside myself. I came on the set trying with all my might to act. I wasn’t crying. Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, 'Are you okay?'\"\n\nWhen Field told Williams what happened, he immediately went into support mode, saying, \"Oh my God, we need to get you out here right now.”\n\n\"And he made it happen—they shot around me the rest of the day,\" Field continued. \"I could go back to my house, call my brother, and make arrangements. It’s a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive.\"\n\nRelated: 'Mrs. Doubtfire' Cast Delights with Rare Reunion Photo to Celebrate Film's 31st Anniversary\n\nActress Mara Wilson, who also starred in Mrs. Doubtfire, had a similar tale about the iconic performer.\n\n\"People are always surprised when I tell them that Robin could be very quiet,\" Wilson said. \"When I was nine, we did a table read of What Dreams May Come, shortly after my mother had died. He came up to me and very gently asked how I was, and how my family was, but didn’t bring up anything that could have been painful. He was just very sweet.\"\n\nField admitted that she has a hard time accepting the fact that Williams is truly gone.\n\n\"I keep thinking of him as 'is.' He can’t have left; he can’t. He’s still here. I feel him,\" she said."
