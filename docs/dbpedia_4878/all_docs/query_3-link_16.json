        "text": "Chris Cooney\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nChris Cooney is the Chief Executive Officer of EUE/Screen Gems, Ltd. He is also the co-owner of EUE/Screen Gems Studios. Cooney is known for his collaborative style, his eye for art and his experience with facility management, international content distribution, integrated media solutions, branded content and online content development. Cooney is based in New York City.\n\nToday, Cooney focuses on two core businesses: studio facilities and content development. The production studios are based in Atlanta and Wilmington, NC with a new studio scheduled to open in Miami in fall, 2015. EUE/Sokolow is based in Los Angeles and New York City and focuses on television development and production in the scripted and unscripted arenas.\n\nIn 2010 as COO of the combined facilities, Cooney led the team into Atlanta where the facilities have enjoyed a robust television success with clients such as “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay” – Parts 1 and 2 (Lionsgate), “Satisfaction” (NBC Universal for USA Network) and “Devious Maids” (ABC for Lifetime).\n\nPrior to his role as COO, Cooney held roles as Head of Production for EUE/Screen Gems, Ltd.; Vice President-In-Charge for Facilities in Wilmington, NC and New York City; and Vice President of Physical Production.\n\nCooney became the chief executive officer of First Look Studios in 2000. At First Look, a boutique motion picture production and sales company, Cooney worked on projects such “Before Night Falls” starring Javier Bardem and “Eveyln,” starring Pierce Brosnan.\n\nIn 1996, Cooney led EUE/Screen Gems in the acquisition of DeLaurentis Carolco Studios in Wilmington, NC. Under his leadership, the studio became the heartbeat of the East Coast film industry. The North Carolina incentive and the newly constructed Stage 10, a 37,500 sq ft, column-free sound stage, lured blockbuster film productions. The studios landed “Journey 2: Mysterious Island” in 2011 and Marvel’s “Iron Man 3” in 2012. Television has long been a part of Wilmington’s success story with “One Tree Hill” and “Dawson’s Creek” enjoying long runs on the lot. Most recently, the Wilmington studios have hosted “Under the Dome” (CBS), “Sleepy Hollow” (Fox Television), and “Eastbound and Down” (HBO).\n\nCooney has served as a mentor specializing in Media for Duke University’s Parents Committee Mentorlink Program for the last ten years. Cooney also serves on the board of DESTINATION: COLLEGE a Student assistance program in New York. The program provides much needed academic tutoring and vital College Application and Financial Aid assistance to high school students in underserved communities.\n\nMr. Cooney received his B.A. from Boston University in 1983.\n\nGeorge Cooney\n\nChairman Emeritus\n\nGeorge Cooney is the Chairman Emeritus of EUE/Screen Gems Ltd.\n\nMr. Cooney is an innovator with a career that includes milestones such as leading talented creative teams that directed and produced Clio award winning Coke, Volkswagen, Alka Seltzer campaigns and facility operation for day-time dramas. He is well-respected for his foresight and ability to anticipate new trends in order to adapt to the fluid and evolving entertainment industry. After more than 50 years as an industry leader, his focus is now TV and Film facility development and ownership.\n\nMr. Cooney acquired EUE/Screen Gems and its assets, a division of Columbia Pictures, in 1983. Prior to acquiring the company, he served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Columbia’s EUE/Screen Gems division. He joined Columbia Pictures in 1965 and served in a number of administrative positions before being named the Executive Vice President of the EUE/Screen Gems division in 1972.\n\nSensing a new horizon in technology, Mr. Cooney ushered Columbia Pictures into what was then the newly emerging world of video tape. In addition, while serving as an executive at Columbia Pictures, he was named Chairman of Bell & Howell/Columbia Pictures Video Services, a pioneer in the home video industry.\n\nAn early innovator in the industry, Mr. Cooney continually has the vision to morph EUE/Screen Gems to meet the requirements of an ever-changing business model. When the commercial television segment declined following advertising agency consolidation and acquisition by corporations, Mr. Cooney developed the daytime programming “soap opera” business with Procter and Gamble as a major client. It was a partnership that lasted more than 25 years.\n\nAnd when that segment of the industry began to disappear in the 90s, Mr. Cooney seized the opportunity to become a production facility owner supplying infrastructure and crew for a client base that included Warner Brothers, Paramount, Sony, Disney and more that needed to expand beyond studio facilities in California, which at the time was running out of production space. His vision to expand outside of Los Angeles led to the purchase of the Dino De Laurentiis studio lot in Wilmington, NC. What followed was the building of multiple large, state-of-the-art sound stages, including a massive water tank, in Wilmington, NC, one of the largest in the country.\n\nThat success was followed by another bold vision to expand the footprint of EUE/Screen Gems to Atlanta, GA. Mr. Cooney acquired a sprawling studio complex of 50 acres complete with beautiful Spanish mission style buildings and expanded the lot by building four new large sound stages to attract bigger projects. EUE/Screen Gems was among the first major sound stage facilities to set up shop in Atlanta.\n\nMr. Cooney is active in the community. For 35 years, He’s served as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the New York Medical College, Chairman at St. Theresa’s and a Trustee and Treasurer of the Dr. I Fund Foundation. He also served on the boards of Save Amateur Spots of the City of New York; the Cancer Research Center in Valhalla, NY; and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. He is a member of the Finance Council of the Archdiocese of New York. Mr. Cooney is also a member of the executive committee of the board of Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center for 25 years and has served as its Chairman for 15 years.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Cooney has held numerous seats on governmental and private industrial planning organizations and committees. In 1968, he served as a member of the Film Advisory Committee to Vice President Hubert Humphrey and was on the Film Advisory and Promotion Committees of New York City for Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham Beame, and Edward Koch. As member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, he served for several years on the Executive Film Committee. He was also Chairman of the Motion Picture Labor Negotiations Committee from 1969 to 1978 and a Trustee of Harriman College and Will Rodgers Foundation.\n\nMr. Cooney was appointed by Governor Hugh Carey to the New York State Television & Motion Picture Board, and he was also appointed by New York State Sen. Ralph Marino to the Advisory Committee for the Development of Sports & Entertainment Facilities.\n\nA graduate of Fordham University, Mr. Cooney is a recipient of an Honorary Degree from the New York Medical College and the Helen Hayes Humanitarian Award from St. Clare’s Hospital. And served on the board of trustees.\n\nMr. Cooney received the William Cullen Bryant Award from New York Medical College for his visionary leadership qualities. Mr. Cooney continues to oversee multiple businesses and projects under the EUE/Screen Gems umbrella and enjoys mentoring his eight grown grandchildren.\n\nSharon Cooney Shuttleworth\n\nCo-owner / Senior V.P. / Director of Corporate Communications\n\nSharon Cooney Shuttleworth grew up in a media family, so it’s only natural that her talents\n\nlanded her in the communications profession. As a child actress and model, she appeared in 70\n\ntelevision commercials. She built on her childhood experience and earned a position as\n\nPromotional Director of the Men’s Division of the Ford Modeling Agency from 1985 to 1990.\n\nWhile there, she used her laser sharp eye and marketing savvy to screen talent for brands such\n\nas J.Crew, Nautica and Ralph Lauren. Once the agency finalized their selections, she marketed\n\nthe talent, raised their profiles nationally and kept the agency top of mind with national clients.\n\nSharon was named Marketing and Public Relations Director for the exclusive Lake Isle Caterers\n\nin Westchester County, NY, in 1990. While tempting brides and high-end clients with\n\nsophisticated menus, finger foods and reception locations, she grew the business 75 percent\n\nduring her tenure.\n\nIn 2000, Sharon was named Senior Vice President/Director of Corporate Communications for\n\nEUE/Screen Gems. She has led creative marketing efforts behind the launch of Stage 10 in\n\nWilmington, NC, the opening of the Atlanta studio complex and subsequent milestones and\n\nbookings for both studios.\n\nSharon’s leadership has resulted in EUE/Screen Gems’ frequent inclusion in industry blogs\n\nsuch as “Deadline Hollywood Daily,” the LA Times “Company Town Blog” and “The Wrap” as\n\nwell as traditional news outlets such as “The Hollywood Reporter” and “Variety.”\n\nSharon graduated from Holy Cross College in Worcester, MA, with a B.A. in English in 1981 and\n\ncompleted a Master’s degree at New York’s Columbia University in 1984.
