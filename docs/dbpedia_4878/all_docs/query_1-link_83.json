        "text": "The Toy Story movies are some of the most acclaimed animated films ever. The adventures of Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Andy’s toys have touched audiences worldwide. The first two films are hugely beloved, with the third film emotionally capping off a perfect trilogy. So why was there a need for Toy Story 4? The film continues the adventures of Woody post-Andy, and while it actually is a good movie, it takes away from the emotional closure of its predecessor.\n\nThe original Space Jam, starring Michael Jordan, certainly isn’t a masterpiece. However, it is a fun and nostalgic capsule of sport and pop culture in the ‘90s, featuring the much-loved Looney Tunes characters. Warner Brothers thought they could strike lightning twice with Space Jam: A New Legacy , starring LeBron James, but failed miserably. The film lacks any charm or originality and is essentially a two-hour commercial for the studio and all the IP they own.\n\nGrease , starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, is one of the most iconic musicals of all time. It is a definite classic and didn’t need to be touched. Only a few years after its release, Grease 2 came along and was awful in every way possible. It is essentially a copy of the original film but without Travolta and Newton-John’s charm and catchy music. Each song is as forgettable as the one before it, and it tarnishes the legacy of the original.\n\nJim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play Lloyd and Harry in the ‘90s screwball comedy Dumb and Dumber. It is a fan favorite when it comes to buddy and slapstick comedy, with Carrey and Daniels hilariously bringing their characters to life. After a poorly received prequel in 2003, the pair reprised their roles in the 2014 sequel Dumb and Dumber To. The brand of comedy in the film is outdated and stale, making this more offensive than entertaining. It’s not dumb comedy; it’s just dumb.\n\nBen Stiller gave viewers the iconic \"Blue Steel\" look in Zoolander , satirizing the world of male modeling alongside Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell. Fifteen years later came Zoolander 2, with the three comedic actors reprising their roles. While a sequel had some promise, the movie is unfortunately unfunny in every way it could be. Despite grand locations, fashion, and celebrity cameos, nothing can save this dumpster fire of a film. Blue Steel is officially dead, it seems.\n\nSteven Spielberg’s Jaws is undoubtedly one of the biggest movies of all time, made by one of the most influential directors ever. Some agree that Jaws 2 was unnecessary, and most will agree that Jaws 3D shouldn’t have been made, but everybody can agree that Jaws: The Revenge is a cinematic sin. With a score of only 2% on Rotten Tomatoes, it has a cheap look and feel, and the shark seemingly has personal motives against people. Not even Michael Caine could save this one.\n\nMean Girls is an elite teen comedy, thanks to its endlessly quotable script and fabulous cast. Characters like Regina George, Gretchen Wieners, and Aaron Samuels have been permanently imprinted into the brains of millennials, making it the perfect nostalgic 2000s movie. A straight-to-TV sequel was made in 2011, which features none of the main original cast and follows a new group of characters. Most people forget it even exists because it is so terrible.\n\nSpeed was one of the most memorable action films to come out of the ‘90s, thanks to its thrilling story and the star power of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Its critically panned sequel Speed 2: Cruise Control sees Bullock return, but Reeves is out of the picture, as their characters have supposedly broken up. It lacks the excitement of the original movie and has poorly written dialogue and unimaginative action. It’s uncertain whether even Reeves could have saved this shipwreck.\n\nDan Aykroyd and John Belushi are on a mission from God in the ‘80s hit The Blues Brothers. The film features a hilariously entertaining blend of over-the-top action and musical numbers, making it a classic that still stands the test of time. Almost twenty years later, a sequel titled Blues Brothers 2000 was released. Aykroyd returned, but John Goodman replaced Belushi as he passed away shortly after the first movie was released. His presence is greatly missed here.\n\nWhen it comes to alien invasion flicks, Independence Day always tops the list. Its belated sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence , was released in 2016, but to much less fanfare. Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprise their roles, and Liam Hemsworth joins them. While it is visually impressive, it lacks the depth and emotion the first movie had, making it much less thrilling. With its thinly written characters, it is clear that it is simply a cash grab and nothing more.\n\nBad Santa, starring Billy Bob Thornton, is a raunchy yet heartwarming alternative to the typical wholesome Christmas movie. Thornton plays Willie, who, along with his friend Marcus, dresses up as Santa and an elf to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. This changes when Willie befriends a young boy. Thirteen years later, the sequel was released, and while it features the same crude humor, it lacks the heart and smarts of its predecessor. Here, Santa is just genuinely bad.\n\nEddie Murphy is a comedic genius, giving audiences hits like Coming to America and Beverly Hills Cop. While Daddy Day Care isn’t one of his best movies, it’s still a fun and inoffensive family flick. The same cannot be said for its sequel, Daddy Day Camp, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. It has a lazy script and poor direction, with genuinely awful acting all around. It’s not something even the kids can enjoy, and it has an abysmal Rotten Tomatoes score of 1% for a good reason.\n\nDisney’s Enchanted is a magical and hilarious film that collides the fairy tale world with the real world when Princess Giselle lands in New York City. It is whimsical, heartfelt, and incredibly clever. Its straight-to-Disney+ sequel, Disenchanted, is the complete opposite. The film totally lacks the charm and wit of the original, leaning into cliches without being endearing. It feels cheap, unfunny, and features far too many forgettable songs. The title of the film is fitting.\n\nSony Pictures has tried its hand at tackling Marvel properties, successfully doing so with Spider-Man. The first Venom movie, released in 2018, was met with mixed reviews, but some found its silliness and campiness to be positive. Its sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, brings more of the same, but the second time round isn’t so entertaining. It’s only natural that the film would get a sequel due to being a Marvel superhero flick, but there doesn’t feel like much need for it.\n\nJason Statham fought off a giant Megalodon shark in 2018’s The Meg. That film is purely big, dumb, and silly popcorn escapism and nothing more. Due to The Meg’s not-so-great reception, it’s surprising that the film got a sequel, but alas, The Meg 2: The Trench was released in 2023. That movie somehow manages to be worse than the first, with poor dialogue, unintelligent characters, and not much else. That being said, Statham does punch a shark in the face.\n\nMurder Mystery is a 2019 Netflix comedy starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. The film is totally fine, offering up the usual Sandler formula that most of his Netflix films adhere to. However, it is undoubtedly forgettable, and a sequel was not needed. Despite this, Murder Mystery 2 was released in 2023, bringing back Sandler and Aniston with a new cast. It offers much of the same as the original, but its existence is nowhere near justified, as it is just as unmemorable.\n\nDon’t Breathe is a heart-pounding horror thriller that stands out in the genre. The film follows three criminals who break into the home of an elderly blind man, but he is not as defenseless as he seems. That film created a terrifying villain out of The Blind Man, so it’s a bizarre mystery as to why he is portrayed as a hero in Don’t Breathe 2. He is a murderer and rapist in the original movie, yet the sequel tries to garner sympathy for him from the audience. It’s just not right.\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer isn’t the best example of a great horror movie, but it is still an entertaining and campy slasher that makes for a fun B-grade movie. Unfortunately, that’s not the case for its sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. The few things that worked about the first movie are missing here, as this relies purely on cheap jump scares and ridiculously stupid characters (yes, even for a horror movie). It is repetitive and mindless.\n\nSex and the City is one of the most popular shows to come out of the late ‘90s and early 2000s, featuring the hilarious characters of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda. It received the big screen treatment in 2008 with the first Sex and the City movie. While this definitely doesn’t meet the quality of the TV series, it is still a fun return for the characters. Sex and the City 2, however, is not. With its bloated runtime and woefully offensive script, it should never have been made.\n\nReese Witherspoon made audiences fall in love with pink and bubbly law student Elle Woods in Legally Blonde. The film offers up a loveable and endearing underdog protagonist who also happens to have a whole lot of style and sass. This makes it even more of a shame that its sequel, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blue, is nowhere near the high standard of its predecessor. Witherspoon does the best she can, but the weak script ruins Elle’s character."
