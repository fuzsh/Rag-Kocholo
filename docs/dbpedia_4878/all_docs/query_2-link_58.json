Their work has been critically acclaimed.\n\nCalifone has released an album and feature film, both of which are titled All My Friends Are Funeral Singers. The album was released October 6, 2009 on Dead Oceans. The feature film was made available in 2010, and the band toured as a live soundtrack to the film.\n\nAll My Friends Are Funeral Singers is the follow-up album to 2006's Roots & Crowns, which The New York Times called \"enthralling.\"\n\nIn 2011, a feature-length tour documentary about Califone, called \"Made a Machine by Describing the Landscape\", was released by IndiePix. The film was directed by Solan Jensen and Joshua Marie Wilkinson, and presents an intimate portrait of the band on tour in Europe and the US after the release of \"Heron King Blues\".\n\nComments - 2"
