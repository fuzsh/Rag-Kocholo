        "text": "Background: Overseas Filmgroup was a Los Angeles based film company that was established in the early 1980s. In January 2001, it was renamed as one of its subsidiaries and became First Look Media (not to be confused with news organization of the same name). It eventually became a subsidiary of the Calfornian home distribution company Ventura Distribution, before becoming independent again in 2006 as Ventura folded. In 2010, First Look went bankrupt. The sister company Millennium Films acquired the film library and all assets of First Look, eventually being reorganized as a full-on distribution company itself. In 2015, Millennium was renamed Alchemy. Sometime afterwards, Alchemy folded.\n\n1st Logo (Late 1990s-2001)[]\n\nLogo: We see a light blue, stylized F made of two triangles. The words FIRST LOOK PICTURES, each below the other, appear one after one. Below is the byline: \"'A Division of Overseas Filmgroup\".\n\nFX/SFX: The words appearing.\n\nVariant: There is a variant with RELEASING below, shown on the trailer for Keep the Aspidistra Flying.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. Appears on A Map of the World, Party Girl, Antonia's Line, and other films, although some international releases contain the Overseas logo.\n\n2nd Logo (2001-2006) []\n\nLogo: We see light blinks on a small glass sphere. It zooms out and being cut in half, along with the distorted triangle to the left. The words \"FIRST LOOK\" with \"MEDIA\" appear below.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere's a variant in which INTERNATIONAL appears in place of MEDIA. This version has the byline, \"A Division of First Look Media\" below.\n\nThere is a version with PICTURES below. It also has the byline.\n\nFX/SFX: The glass lens effects and lights, probably with some live action.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Soft chime bell sounds.\n\nAvailability: Can be seen on films such as Doctor Sleep (AKA Close Your Eyes), Epicenter, Elling, Skins and Lawless Heart. This also plasters or (not often) precedes the Overseas Filmgroup logo on recent domestic prints of its films.\n\n3rd Logo (2006-2010)[]\n\nLogo: We see an image of a sea at sunrise with clouds moving. Then, the area around the screen darkens, and a bright flash occurs. We see an image of a green eye. The lens flare moves off to the right as \"FIRST LOOK STUDIOS\" fades in above and below, respectively.\n\nVariant: There's a variant in which \"PICTURES\" appears in place of \"STUDIOS\". This is usually seen on trailers.\n\nFX/SFX: The sea, the clouds moving, the lens flaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A short piano tune that ends in a five-note orchestral fanfare."
