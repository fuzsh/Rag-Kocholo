        "text": "A question from Lembit:\n\nIs this true that only 2% of independent films get any form of distribution?\n\nI got this information from an article written by William C. Martell.\n\n“According to the Los Angeles Times, only 2% of independent films get any form of distribution. That includes DVD distribution. Most films are never seen by anyone but the filmmakers.” (Script magazine, September/October 2008, page 83)\n\nThough we talk about indie films a lot on GITS, I confess I’m more of a lover of independent cinema than an expert on distribution. I do know enough, however, to understand that the biggest issue is not getting an indie film produced — given digital filmmaking, virtually anybody can make a movie nowadays. No, the real problem is getting a movie distributed. And not just distributed, but done in such a way that a significant amount of eyeballs will see the movie to generate sufficient revenue to create a sustainable model for continuing to produce indie movies.\n\nThat has proved to be a tough nut to crack, especially since the collapse of the ‘specialty’ film divisions as arms of the major Hwood movie studios.\n\n[For background re this subject, go here, here, here, here, and here].\n\nSo no, I don’t doubt that 2% figure.\n\nBut two things appear to be happening that could shift those numbers significantly over the next decade. First, some indie filmmakers are finding success in self-distributing their movies. Here is an excerpt from a GITS post “Independent Filmmakers Distribute on Their Own”:\n\n“Anvil! The Story of Anvil,” a documentary about a Canadian metal band, turned into the do-it-yourself equivalent of a smash hit when it stretched a three-screen opening in April into a four-month run, still under way, on more than 150 screens around the country.\n\n“I paid for everything, I took a second mortgage on my house,” said Sacha Gervasi, the film’s director.\n\nMr. Gervasi, whose studio writing credits include “The Terminal,” directed by Steven Spielberg, nearly three years ago, began filming “Anvil!” with his own money in hopes of attracting a conventional distributor. The movie played well at Sundance in 2008, but offers were low.\n\nSo Mr. Gervasi put up more money — his total cost was in “the upper hundred thousands,” he said — to distribute the film through a company called Abramorama, while selling the DVD and television rights to VH1.\n\nThe aging rockers of Anvil have shown up at theaters to play for audiences. Famous fans like Courtney Love were soon chattering online about the film. And an army of “virtual street teamers” — Internet advocates who flood social networks with admiring comments, sometimes for a fee, sometimes not — were recruited by a Web consultant, Sarah Lewitinn, who usually works the music scene.\n\nThe idea behind this sort of guerrilla release is to accumulate just enough at the box office to prime the pump for DVD sales and return the filmmaker’s investment, maybe even with a little profit. “Anvil!” has earned roughly $1 million worldwide at the box office so far, its producer, Rebecca Yeldham, said.\n\nThe second thing is this damn curious thing known as the Internet. It’s estimated that 1.8 billion people have access to it with a growth rate of nearly 400% over the last decade. Each end user represents a potential viewer of an indie movie, so in effect what that means is the Internet has already created the infrastructure filmmakers need to distribute their movies anywhere in the world.\n\nIndeed, we are seeing the emergence of online indie film distribution portals such as IndieMoviesOnline.com, IndieFlix.com, and MovieFlix.com. Do these sites have enough paying viewers to translate into profitability for individual filmmakers? Probably not. But I suspect that there are some specific movies that have made money through online distribution.\n\nSo the question boils down to this: Why do some films get distributed and make money while others do not? In this era of “The Long Tail”, DIY filmmaking, and the adage of “If you build it, [they] will come,” it’s probably fair to say that in a vast majority of cases, the movies that worked financially were good movies, while the movies that didn’t work financially were not. No matter how things change, some things remain the same:\n\nYou are much better off if your movie has a strong story concept\n\nYou are much better off if your movie is based on a good screenplay\n\nYou are much better off if the director knows what they’re doing\n\nYou are much better off if you have good actors\n\nYou are much better off if the film crew you use can bring professional production values to what’s shot, what’s edited, what’s scored, etc\n\nEven if your movie costs $20K, you have to figure that it is in competition — speaking purely about entertainment value — with Avatar. Why? Because life is a zero-sum game and at the end of the day, you (the filmmaker) have got to create a movie that has something about it compelling enough for me (the consumer) to spend 100 minutes of my time watching it while pushing back my need to see the latest of Hollywood’s multi-zillion dollar CGI 3D spectacles.\n\nPerhaps harder than that is marketing your movie so that it breaks through all the noise of the marketplace and actually gets my attention for a handful of seconds.\n\nNot easy.\n\nFrom the screenwriting standpoint, what we can control are the first two items on that list: strong story concept and good script.\n\nIt always comes back to that.\n\nUPDATE: Boy, things have sure changed since I answered this question back in May 2010. In some respects, we may never have had a more vibrant independent film environment than right now:\n\nFantastic new companies like A24 (founded in 2012) which has distributed such notable movies as The Spectacular Now, Obvious Child, Ex Machina, The End of the Tour, Room, Green Room, Swiss Army Man, Moonlight, 20th Century Women, and the upcoming A Ghost Story and The Disaster Artist.\n\nAn expansion of film festivals including an explosive growth of venues supporting short films, a conduit for new filmmakers to establish themselves and move onto feature length films.\n\nThe emergence of streaming platforms such as Amazon and Netflix providing even more potential distributors and revenue streams for filmmakers.\n\nThe growth of premium movie theaters which often cater to upscale indie movie fans.\n\nAbout that 2% number noted in the original post? My guess is that’s probably in the ballpark of independent movies obtaining distribution. In part because there are so many more people making movies due to lower costs and ease of use with digital filmmaking.\n\nNo matter shifting trends and emerging technologies, I still stand by my original point: strong story concept and good script. Absolutely essential for an indie filmmaker hoping to produce something which ends up getting distributed."
