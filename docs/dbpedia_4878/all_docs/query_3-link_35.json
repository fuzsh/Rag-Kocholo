        "text": "Let me begin by professing my love for the first two “Deadpool” films. They are lean, mean, and funny.\n\nMocking the conventions of superhero movies while following their formula, the “Deadpool” series feels more like the parody of this genre we’ve not quite yet had but desperately need.\n\nI will also note I did, in fact, laugh at several moments in the new film “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the third film version of the Merc with a Mouth currently crushing global box office records. I would recount those moments, but I can only ruin a joke told better by Ryan Reynolds, who can be quite funny despite the sour attitude of many critics.\n\nNo, my concern is how this new film is not so much about Deadpool or Wolverine, but rather celebrates corporate mergers and the winnowing of creativity in Hollywood. Overall, the experience left me depressed, wondering where do things go from here?\n\nHow MCU films grew more complicated, less fun\n\nLet me explain my melancholy. “Deadpool 2” was released in 2018, predating the closing of Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox. While Marvel Studios was acquired by Disney 15 years ago, there were still a number of titles and characters licensed to other studios. 20th Century Fox released all the X-Men films as well as the Deadpool films.\n\n(Deadpool and X-Men are connected in a way I don’t quite understand since I’ve never read comic books, but I will generally refer to them as Marvel mutant movies.)\n\nI tend to like the Marvel mutant movies better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The tones are darker, there’s social relevance woven throughout, and a tendency to let directors showcase their vision. While pilloried now, Bryan Singer brought a genuine point of view to the X-Men movies. Same for James Mangold, who made a haunting sendoff to the Wolverine character with “Logan.”\n\nMCU entries, over time, have gone from great to worse. There’s no better moment in modern movies than watching Robert Downey Jr. cement his redemption as Tony Stark in the first “Iron Man” film. Or the sheer splendor of (also pilloried) Joss Whedon’s dialogue spoken by the immaculate cast of the first “Avengers” film. I truly loved those movies and they should be revered as honest-to-goodness crowd pleasers.\n\nNothing great can last forever, and the MCU wants to go on forever. Heck, they already gone on forever: the first “X-Man” was released almost a quarter of a century ago!\n\nOver time, these comic-book films became bloated and Byzantine in nature. Marvel’s approach has minimized its actors and directors for the sake of complicated connections to one film or TV series to another. The theory being that watching something will compel you to watch something else. This only works for mega-fans who luxuriate in details of world-building.\n\nWatching “The Marvels” last fall, I had to pester my filmgoing companion, asking what was happening because so much of the plot was connected to a series I never watched. Marvel Studios wonders why casual fans didn’t line up to see that film. Some want to blame it on racism and misogyny, but I would chalk it up to the fact “The Marvels” just wasn’t very good.\n\nFun adventures are now plodding epics that take an instructor’s manual to understand. Minute details from a long-ago edition are valued over making a generally entertaining experience for the mass audience.\n\nI used to defend MCU films because they were funny or cast good actors in charming performances. Perhaps the 2022 sequel to “Doctor Strange” is the last time I felt that way within the past five years, and it was largely because the studio let Sam Raimi inject his manic weirdness into the proceedings.\n\nHow a Hollywood merger shaped 'Deadpool & Wolverine'\n\nWhich leads me back to Disney and 20th Century Fox, a stunning consolidation of media interests ranging from print to news to streaming services to, yes, film production and distribution. Any sane person would look at this much information and services being rolled up into one company as a dangerous move for culture and democracy.\n\nIn this new Gilded Age, however, lawmakers shrug their shoulders and take the campaign check, thinking overworked bureaucrats will do the heavy lifting. (Good luck, now that the United States Supreme Court has officially wiped out any meaningful agency oversight just a few weeks ago. Another topic for another column.)\n\nThe public, who largely want to live their lives and find some form of enjoyment, will grumble about the rising cost of Hulu and the lousy options at the multiplex. But nothing more. Worse were the online creatures who celebrated this behemoth merger in hopes their Marvel mutants would get to share a screen with MCU characters. Such a vapid response to a distressing event.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is the first story involving these characters since the Disney-20th Century merger. In other words, it’s the first time Deadpool and Wolverine have appeared in the Marvel Comics Universe since everyone is now under the Disney banner. It is everything online geeks hoped would happen!\n\nSadly, the leanness of previous Deadpool films has vanished into a morass of plot contrivances.\n\nWade Wilson and his super-persona Deadpool (Reynolds) finds out a universal bureaucrat (Matthew Macfayden) is planning on wiping out his current timeline. Which, if you are paying attention, is clearly the Marvel mutant films. Anyway, without spoiling anything, Wolverine is the key to saving this particular stream of existence.\n\nA big problem because Wolverine, er Logan, died in the 2017 film. But not too big a problem because there’s another Logan in some other multiverse. So Deadpool goes looking for him, finds him, and they end up being cast in a place called the Void.\n\nThe Void is where discarded superheroes go. This means characters from Fox properties return for cameos. This I will not spoil. Again, some funny material. But it drags on forever and eventually loses its charm.\n\nMore problematic are the end credits which — after using these characters for fodder for over two hours — proceeds to conduct a mawkish elegy to the Fox X-Men films. It even uses that tired Green Day song every project uses when they need to convey false sincerity. You know the one. It’s been the senior class song since 1998.\n\nI expected a punchline that never came. “Deadpool & Wolverine” wanted to be sincere after a whole preceding segment about how ridiculous some of these characters were. Talk about wanting your cake and eating it too. Plus, does anyone go to a Deadpool film for the sincerity?\n\nBut the Void is part of the film’s larger problem. Since Deadpool is nothing if not subversively self-referential, it makes sense there would be jokes at the expense of this corporate collision. However, the jokes are so endless and so specific that I wondered if we needed a primer on the mechanisms of the mergers and acquisitions referenced.\n\nAgain, I am not interested in judging jokes. I also do not want to foreclose on the idea this couldn’t be funny. But “Deadpool & Wolverine” is directed by Shawn Levy, who’s not exactly a subversive guy. He directed the “Night at the Museum” movies, “Date Night\" and “Free Guy.”\n\nHe’s a guy who earnestly says he wants to make populist entertainment rather than something for the “seven cool guys in the corner.” An eye-rolling sentiment, but telling. It signals Levy wants to celebrate this Fox-Disney merger with levity and good-natured ribbing rather than approach the subject with satirical bite.\n\nIn the end, “Deadpool & Wolverine” is a film about diminishing entertainment options. Instead of having multiple studios competing with one another, hopefully leading to better quality films, we’re going to have one or two companies who will say what we get to watch. It’s about merging storylines and characters into homogenous packages aiming at everyone while appealing to no one.\n\n“Deadpool & Wolverine” is ultimately about the dominance of the MCU, and how even other comic-book films are not safe from its reach. It’s a depressing proposition to see Deadpool dissolve from something foul and funny to a celebration of soullessness.\n\nOr at least I will feel that way until the MCU wises up and starts hiring decent filmmakers to put a version of their vision on the screen. But why would they do that now when they are one of the only games in town?\n\nJames Owen is the Tribune’s film columnist.
