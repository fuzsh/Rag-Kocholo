        "text": "BuzzFeed has promoted Richard Alan Reid to the role of President of Studio, the digital media company announced on Thursday. This comes following three and a half years in which he’s served as EVP, Head of Studio & International.\n\nAs part of Reid’s promotion, BuzzFeed Studios is absorbing and refocusing the video arm of BuzzFeed, Inc., which is home to fan-favorite channels like BuzzFeed Celeb, BuzzFeed Video, Unsolved Network, and the BuzzFeed Animation Lab, into one combined entity. His role will now oversee all of the expanded studio encompassing digital video, distribution and premium programming across film, television, documentary, audio, FAST and licensing for BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Hot Ones and Tasty. As President, he will also lead all business and content operations across the company’s international portfolio of editions and partnerships around the world.\n\nThrough the continuation of digital content, Reid and the Studios team will look to tailor programming that harnesses BuzzFeed’s built-in marketing power and social following of 520 million. Other areas funneling into BuzzFeed Studios include audio/podcasts with notable mentions like HuffPost’s Am I Doing It Wrong lifestyle podcast, continually featured on Apple’s top 10 Self-Help playlists, as well as a suite of FAST channels housing existing content around topics like true crime, food and celebrity.\n\nWhile leading BuzzFeed Studios, Reid has shaped the landscape of the company across film and TV by relaunching the motion pictures arm as a premium production partner in the era of new Hollywood while leveraging BuzzFeed’s substantial reach to millennial & Gen Z audiences for the release of new and original programming.\n\nDuring his time as EVP, he negotiated long-term strategic partnerships with studios and strategic partners like Lionsgate, Universal Television, Acast Studios, and The Independent in the UK. The studio credits him with leading them to four benchmark years of success with the production of cost-efficient features like the holiday comedy EXmas and rom-com Puppy Love, while supporting theatrical titles such as Fall and Black Demon. He also spearheaded work on docuseries like Once Upon a Time in Londongrad and The Rise and Fall of LuLaRoe, which showcased the studio’s commitment to creating compelling unscripted content inspired by IP and investigative reporting stemming from HuffPost and BuzzFeed News. Reid has also demonstrated the studio’s ability to attract A-list talent like Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart, who hosted the company’s Peacock cooking show, Snoop & Martha’s Very Tasty Halloween.\n\nReid has sold and produced films and shows to NBCUniversal, Lionsgate, Paramount, Amazon Studios, Discovery and Sky and negotiated various output deals and partnerships with major studios, distributors, talent and other publishers. He has directed commercial campaigns for brands including Citibank, BMW, Amazon, GEICO and Coca-Cola, and led many thought-leadership keynotes on the subject of content creation and audience behaviors in the digital age. Prior to BuzzFeed, Reid ran development and production financing at two independent production companies, after moving to the U.S. from the UK, where he wrote, developed and directed comedy shows and live performances."
