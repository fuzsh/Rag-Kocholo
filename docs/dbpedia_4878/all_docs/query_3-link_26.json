        "text": "At this point, the film that goes into the theatre projector is a third-generation copy (camera film › interpositive › internegative › release print). Even with the best image transfer technology in the world, some loss of quality is unavoidable.\n\nYou may wonder why the studios would bother transferring their interpositives to an internegative and then the release copies. So did I; for this article, I’ve learned that those steps were necessary to 1) protect the interpositive film from wear and 2) maintain the contrast and colour accuracy.\n\nInterpositive film is the most important copy the studio can have in its possession. It is the final version of the movie, often dubbed “Protection IP,” i.e., to be protected. But, due to the mechanical nature of film transfers, they create wear, so it would be inadvisable to run IP through a wet gate repeatedly, degrading and potentially endangering the production. Internegative film takes the brunt of that abuse instead of the IP; in some cases, internegatives had to be re-made from interpositives because of the wear, but that didn’t have to happen many times.\n\nAdditionally, positive (reversal) film is not used for transfers because contact printing from positive to positive causes contrast and saturation to increase significantly, ruining the picture. Negative film’s linear curve, on the other hand, preserves image quality.\n\nHow movies (that are shot on film) are distributed in the digital era.\n\nThough digital cameras dominate movie sets today, many are still shot on film. Some examples are Blade Runner 2049, Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood, and La La Land. However, those films almost certainly use a process that differs from the one described above:\n\nDigital intermediate workflow in movie production is simpler, less prone to quality loss*, faster, cheaper, and a lot more powerful when it comes to visual effects. The process usually involves just one set of film reels — the one in the camera(s). Instead of multiple image transfer steps, film is scanned, and the media is worked on in the digital environment, then distributed digitally. In some cases, the digitally-edited copy of the film may be used to expose release prints using specialized digital projectors.\n\nSome films that are shot and edited digitally go through the “analogue intermediate” process, which involves exposing reels of film to the digital images and then scanning that film. This is done to add the unique character and the look of an emulsion.\n\n✱ — The amount of quality loss during contact printing vs. scan & digital intermediate print may be debatable, and the types of quality loss depend greatly on the scanner and the film stocks.\n\nCristopher Nolan’s IMAX film duplication and distribution.\n\nCristopher Nolan is adamant about using an uninterrupted analogue workflow for his movies. Oppenheimer is not an exception. Shot on Kodak film, including the special version of Kodak XX black-and-white stock, it went through all the steps of contact printing: camera › interpositive › internegative › release prints.\n\nBut of course, there are significant differences between Oppenheimer and films shot in the 1960s — both in the quality and the workflow. In addition to the enormous IMAX negatives, modern Kodak emulsions have much tighter grain and significantly better colour management than the decades-old technology. And instead of the tape transfer step, the camera film was scanned and edited digitally; those edits were then programmed into a machine that applied them to the film.\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to have seen Oppenheimer in a theatre with a film projector (whether IMAX or 35mm), you’ve experienced a movie that was never digitized. But for most of us, it’s been scanned and viewed on a screen, much like the film photography on this website.\n\nSource: Jay Trautman, who worked as an Assistant Editor for Oppenheimer, explained the process on YouTube; the video has been since taken down, but a copy remains on Internet Archive.\n\nDigital intermediation is the easiest way to interact with film — whether it’s a movie, a TV show, or still photography. It has some downsides; as many film photographers will tell you, high-quality scans are difficult to make. There may be some loss to the dynamic range, and dealing with colour is another challenge.\n\nBut there are undoubtedly advantages to digitizing film also. Aside from being able to distribute as quickly as digital images (and giving it a fighting chance in the modern world), well-scanned film stands out from digital photographs. Many people like that, and the ability to replicate the film look faithfully is debatable."
