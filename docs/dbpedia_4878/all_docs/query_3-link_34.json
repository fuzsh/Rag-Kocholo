        "text": "The process of making a movie is the same as the process of manufacturing any other product, and preparing your film for distribution from day 1 will save you a lot of pain when it comes time to sell it. Research the market, the audience, and what the distributors are looking for before you undertake a production. Most filmmakers spend massive sums of money and time on a movie only to discover that there’s no market for it. Smart moviemaking means figuring out a marketing and distribution plan before you begin preproduction.\n\nCall and set up meetings with domestic and foreign distributors and ask to talk to a sales rep – The best way to reach them is by attending a film market like the American Film Market in Santa Monica. Held each year, it’s a marketplace where distributors from around the world meet to explore and purchase content from producers. Film markets are the best way to see what is selling and to where.\n\nAsk distributors what genres are selling and what genres they feel will be hot in a year – For example, the horror genre is generally a consistent seller in the foreign market, is cheap to produce, and doesn’t require big name actors in the cast. Action-driven movies are less reliant on the dialogue, so even if the audience doesn’t follow the nuances of the performances, the action will be enough to sell the film.\n\nFind out which actors you should approach to help increase the marketability of the movie – Which actors are bringing in the largest sales of independent movies in the foreign market? Some actors perform better in different markets, and producers know this. Smart casting is not just about finding the right actors to play the part, but finding actors who can attract crowds in popular markets like Germany, latin America, Japan, and China.\n\nFind out what format distributors prefer – Each distributor will require slightly different delivery specifications, be it 35 mm film, an HD, or digital format. This will help you decide the best camera and format on which to shoot your film.\n\nWhat is the ideal length for the movie? –Many distributors prefer a movie around 90 minutes in length, simply because movie theaters can fit more movies into the daily schedule, thereby increasing audience turnaround, and profits.\n\nWhat marketing materials should you collect during production to help in the distribution of the movie? It’s critical to start shooting behind-the-scene stills, videos on set, interviews of the cast and crew, and assembling bloopers for social media. Not only can you start building hype in the film during production, but these materials will come in handy when you send out press releases.\n\nWhat are the average sales prices for the type of movie you’re making – By analyzing how much movies of a similar genre perform in the market, you can calculate the budget and determine how much money you should spend. Basically, you want to keep you budget low enough to ensure you see a return on your investment.\n\nThe rules of producing and selling a movie are a lot like the rules governing the game of basketball. Each player must acknowledge and understand the parameters, the size of the court, the height and diameter of the hoop, the number of players on each side, and the time restrictions for an organized game to take place. Whereas some may find these rules limiting, many talented athletes have excelled at the game, even when playing within the guidelines. The same philosophy applies to the production of a movie, in that filmmakers must follow the distributor’s strict guidelines governing the content, format, casting, and genre for the film to be commercially viable. Using a little creativity and talent, filmmakers can certainly succeed within a distributor’s rules. Remember that the film industry is a business designed to make a product that sells and makes a profit."
