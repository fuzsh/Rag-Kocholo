Not merely parabolic, but parablesque. In quieter moments, “between projects,” Welles occasionally endeavored to fight these forces, while he had the strength, correcting the more extreme misrepresentations from film critic Pauline Kael, the psychobabble-as-criticism of Charles Higham, and the ostensibly autobiographical reconstructions from that “benign mandarin,” John Houseman. And still the obituaries of the man, who died peacefully in his sleep at his home in L.A. in 1985 at the age of seventy, rarely deviated from convenient myth into inconvenient history. Welles had become an anachronism before his time, a Dorian Gray in reverse whose physical corpulence was equated with some more cerebral\n\nv\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\nvi\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage vi\n\nPREFACE\n\nobesity. The failures of this most baroque of filmmakers were attributed to an excess of appetite and ego that, ergo, led to his fall. Welles once ruefully observed, “I came to Hollywood saying, ‘If they let me do a second picture, I’m lucky.’” They let him make a second movie (The Magnificent Ambersons), they just never let anyone outside Pomona and Pasadena see it. His determined attempts to “get back to the [original] position” he found himself in pre–Citizen Kane lasted for some seventeen years, from 1941 to 1958, at which point he had made six films for the studio system. The sixth, Touch of Evil, was taken away from him at the editing stage and recast as another uniform noir thriller, as had been the case with The Lady from Shanghai (1948) and The Stranger (1946). It was the last straw. Hollywood, in the end, ate up its “would-be genius” (gossipmonger Louella Parson’s little joke at Welles’s expense) and spat him out. Yet seventeen years after Welles’s death, and forty-five years after he last directed a film for a Hollywood studio, there is precious little sign that the facts underlying Welles’s largely unfulfilled career as a Hollywood director are about to triumph over the lackadaisical mischief-making of Pauline Kael (“Raising Kane”), Charles Higham (The Films of Orson Welles), or, more recently, Simon Callow (The Road to Xanadu), David Thomson (Rosebud), and Peter Conrad (Orson Welles: The Stories of His Life). Of these weighty tomes, Callow’s has been perhaps the most damaging. An actor and director of some note in his own right, and a sympathetic biographer of Charles Laughton, Callow came to his task with some credentials. Unfortunately he was hamstrung by his own oxymoronic approach (“my book . . . is simultaneously a synthesis and a deconstruction”), and a profound inability to sort the historical from the mythological (he is particularly suspect when using the testimonies of the notoriously unreliable John Houseman and Michael MacLiammoir). As it is, The Road to Xanadu (1995), in seeking to rekindle dying embers of myths about Welles’s profligacy, “fear of completion,” and credit-stealing, was a weighty semibiography short on original research and long on authorial judgements. As things stand, Cal-\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage vii\n\nPREFACE\n\nvii\n\nlow’s “biography” of Welles is somewhat more incomplete, and a whole lot less representative, than most of Welles’s so-called “unfinished” works; even as word arrives that another installment (of the now three-volume opus!) is all but finished. Callow’s hefty doorstop—coming a mere six years after Frank Brady’s extremely well-researched, even-handed if largely overlooked, wholly fulfilling biography—was remarkably well received. Perhaps the gestalt was still against Welles, despite the steady accumulation of evidence in the decade since his demise, from which a more reasoned reevaluation could have come. The first half of the 1990s had seen the dissemination of a wealth of new material on Welles, beginning in low-key fashion in 1990 with Bret Wood’s meticulously researched bio-bibliography (Greenwood Press), a starting point for all Welles scholars. Two years later, Harper-Collins generated considerably more of a splash with the long-awaited This Is Orson Welles, four hundred pages of fabled “on the record” conversations between Welles and Peter Bogdanovich, undertaken in the late 1960s and early 1970s for a nevercompleted portrait by the modern film director with the greatest empathy for his subject. Accompanying these interviews were a number of private documents—memos, correspondence, and the like—to substantiate much of what Welles claimed to have happened to him and his films; and a detailed chronology of his career compiled by Welles authority Jonathan Rosenbaum, who was also responsible for editing the original 1,400-page manuscript down. A four-cassette set of audio tapes was issued simultaneously, with some material that had not been included in the book. The following year Robert Carringer published a follow-up of sorts to his definitive account of The Making of Citizen Kane. The Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction used much the same material he had drawn upon previously for a laser disc version of Welles’s second movie, finally putting into the published domain the complete “cutting continuity” script for the Welles version of the film, as well as excerpting much of the correspondence that the ham-fisted editing of the movie had generated between Welles and the studio.\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\nviii\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage viii\n\nPREFACE\n\n(Meanwhile the three best commentaries on Welles’s films to date—Andre Bazin’s A Critical View (1972), James Naremore’s The Magic World of Orson Welles (1978), and Joseph McBride’s Orson Welles (1972)—were all deemed worthy of republication (the latter two in revised editions), taking advantage of the same window of interest; along with Michael MacLiammoir’s invaluable journal, kept during the making of Othello, Put Money In Thy Purse (Virgin Books, 1994).) At the same time an appreciation of Welles’s filmmaking was enhanced by three documentaries that addressed the films he had left unfinished. The first of these, Don Quixote, released in 1992, was a partial “reconstruction” of the project that had occupied Welles for much of the last quarter of a century of his life, painstakingly put together by Jesus Franco. The following year, another film “based on an unfinished film by Orson Welles,” It’s All True, was screened at selected cinemas. It was in part a reconstruction of Welles’s fabled 1942 pan-American quasidocumentary, as well as a documentary about that film’s fate. It was widely reviewed, and the context in which the original film had been “abandoned” widely discussed. Finally, two years later, Welles’s latter-day companion Oja Kodar authorized a ninety-minute documentary, Orson Welles: The OneMan Band (later shown on British television as The Lost Films of Orson Welles), that collected together some of the more immediately arresting detritus from the last fifteen years of Welles’s life, a period previously perceived as being almost entirely unproductive. Kodar also oversaw the publication of Welles’s last two completed screenplays, The Big Brass Ring (cowritten with Kodar) and The Cradle Will Rock, further affirmation that being denied the means of moviemaking had not acted as a final curb on his imagination. The publication in Film Quarterly in its Fall 1992 issue of an abbreviated version of Welles’s fifty-eight-page memo to Universal studio head Ed Muhl, regarding the studio’s edit of his last Hollywood film, Touch of Evil, set another cartwheel in motion. The memo in question established not only what the studio had imposed against Welles’s wishes, but also how meticulously the director had worked\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage ix\n\nPREFACE\n\nix\n\nto put together the kind of film he wanted and to what extent the studio had fundamentally undermined his organic conceit. The memo, which was meant to constitute part of the 1992 edition of This Is Orson Welles, was finally included in its belated 1998 paperback edition (Da Capo Press). The publication coincided with the general release of a new version of the film in question, reedited according to Welles’s own instructions in that memo by Walter Murch, under the supervision of Rick Schmidlin. The “new” version of Touch of Evil again generated debate about how much damage Welles’s work had sustained at the hand of Hollywood’s artisans and execs, prompting the question, why Welles? Yet none of the recent biographers and commentators on the man’s work—with the notable exception of Michael Anderegg (Orson Welles, Shakespeare and Popular Culture [1999])—have drawn upon this wealth of material to reevaluate the circumstances under which Hollywood’s most gifted and original film director made just six movies for the Hollywood studios, five of which were duly mangled by “the system.” My intention is to redress the balance. ◆\n\n◆\n\n◆\n\n◆\n\nAs with all things under heaven, there are reasons why the studios never got to grips with Welles and why he never retained a strong enough grip on the public to be allowed to make the films he wanted. Some people’s motives and reasoning are lost now in the mists of forgotten memories and handfuls of dust, and cannot thus be subjected to any ongoing revisionism. Thankfully, though, there are shooting scripts, shooting schedules, and internal memos; onthe-record interviews with protagonists; private correspondence to and from Welles; his own conversations, published and transcribed; letters to the papers setting the record straight(er); and articles and lectures to the public at large. All help fill in the gaps and steer one toward a thesis of reconstruction. By revealing the circumstance of history in context, for perhaps the first time, I hope to deconstruct the idea that the sub-\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\nx\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage x\n\nPREFACE\n\nconscious demons of one man—a dubious notion at the best of times—led to a series of events that were as inevitable as the trajectory of Sisyphus’s boulder. Welles was undone by real people, with real motives, and by circumstances found in a single time and place—Hollywood at the end of its golden era. That many people felt threatened by Welles and what he appeared to stand for is surely indisputable. Welles came to Hollywood with an approach to filmmaking that was anathema to the system, and everyone soon knew it. He wanted to make movies as psychologically sound as a good novel, with layers of meaning that only became apparent on repeated viewings and with what the dean of film criticism, Andre Bazin, typified as “the kernel of meaning [being] perceived . . . in its natural relationship to all the contiguous realities.” This young man represented the greatest threat to Hollywood’s way of making movies precisely because he made the kind of film that everyone in Hollywood wished they could make, just their way. His many enemies rarely articulated their concerns in such terms. Many would have balked at the term “enemy,” but Welles always knew the name of the beast. The studio system meant that those who felt (justifiably) threatened could compel him to deviate from his own aesthetic core or, failing that, had the means to remove that core. Yet it can be found in all of Welles’s films, no matter how many trapdoors we may have to pass through. And this brings us to the second strand I aim to weave—to show what each film could and should have been, and to illustrate how enriched the parameters of American moviemaking would have been had Welles been able to consistently enforce his vision on the medium. I came to feel that this story was not one that even careful readers of recent tomes on the man would recognize (hence my ill-disguised lack of regard for the slanted views of Callow and Conrad). It is the story of an intelligent, perceptive, passionate, egotistical man who, for all his failings as a person, was absolutely uncompromising in his art. The endearing public persona went “nae deep,” but the director within always knew when to keep his counsel\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage xi\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\n(hence the visceral shock when that authentic tone was revealed in the Touch of Evil memo). Though he had more faith in the average moviegoer than an entire school of Hollywood producers, Welles was allowed just one opportunity to express that faith fully—in resources, critical acceptance, and, above all, total control of the work itself—and Citizen Kane has certainly proved to be a lucrative earner through the years (as has Touch of Evil, which on its 1998 restoration had lines around the block at New York’s Film Forum for weeks on end). Welles’s attempts to play the game only ended in heartbreak, but he kept coming back for more, filled with (as he put it, after his sixth and final hand went bust) “a greedy need to exercise, in some way, the function of my choice: the function of a director.” He never repeated himself as a director, and he never played his hand quite the same way twice. But he participated in the game as long as he saw even the slightest chance of that big win: renewing the contract with his audience made back when, with Citizen Kane. The results were not always recognizably his—after Citizen Kane, they were never entirely his again, at least until he sacrificed Hollywood’s resources for his “kind of control”—but the ten films that he made between 1940 and 1965 (six in Hollywood, and four raised digits to that cinematic colony) have more genuine daring than any of the worthy contemporaries who made three or four (or fourteen) times that number of movies (some random numbers here: Hawks made 43, Capra 45, Ford 132, Huston 38, Wilder 27, Hitchcock 57). Even the similarly star-crossed Preston Sturges made more forays as a Hollywood director. With Welles, at no point is it a question of “never mind the quality, feel the width.” Even The Stranger, the one Hollywood movie he subsequently all but disowned, began life in the land of Welles, only to be kidnapped by editor Ernest Nims and given a new identity by producer Sam Spiegel. Welles did not surrender easily on any of his films, but the forces mounted against him probably made each defeat inevitable. As a result he got the thin end of the wedge in later life, rarely able to exercise his true vocation. A decade and a\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\nxii\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage xii\n\nPREFACE\n\nhalf of innovative filmmaking merely rendered him a “risk,” unbankable, a loose cannon, for daring to make films that challenged the way films got made. Yet Welles himself never claimed that it was impossible to make a good film, even a very good film, within “the system.” He cited Ford as an example of a director who had consistently achieved that. And when he first came to Hollywood as the Boy Wonder in 1939, he hoped that he could prosper in the tradition of D. W. Griffiths, with some of the accessibility of John Ford. But he quickly realized that he didn’t “want to make the kind of movie which [Hollywood] producers want to produce.” However many self-evidently superficial films he acted in to pay the piper, he never gave Hollywood what it craved— a Welles film with all the persona but none of the personality. Despite constantly reinventing himself to fit in with the lay of the land, he was undone by the very message he sought to convey, each and every time—there are no happy endings. And yet, somehow, though he suspected the underlying truth in the Don Marquis saying, “If you make people think they’re thinking, they’ll love you; but if you really make them think, they’ll hate you,” hope for the human condition peeks through even the bleakest, most baroque Wellesian moments. Welles wrote a number of epitaphs for his characters, but he only wrote one obituary for another director. It was Jean Renoir, his favorite filmmaker and a man who was prepared to fund his art with Art (his father’s). He wrote it, for the Los Angeles Times of all newspapers, when he was sixty-four years old, and sensing that he would never get to paint a masterpiece again. The parallels to his own fate cannot have been lost on him, even as the appositeness of what he had to say rang loud and clear: Some of these [films] were commercial and even, in their time, critical failures. Some enjoyed success. None were blockbusters. Many are immortal.\n\nAmen. —Clinton Heylin, November 2003\n\n00 (i-xiv) front matter\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:38 PM\n\nPage xiii\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nReader, please note: In the text, where it is not clear whose critical opinion I am embracing (or refuting), initials in brackets have been preferred to the tiresome practice (for reader and author alike) of notating each and every source.

And I didn’t discover the cliff . . . in films until after I’d been in it for a while.” —Orson Welles, 1982\n\nA\n\nt the end of March 1939 Europe lay less than six months away from its second universal conflict in a generation, after German chancellor Adolf Hitler reneged on a previous promise made to British prime minister Neville Chamberlain at Munich, annexing the Czechoslovakian rump into his ever-expanding vision of a Greater Germany. The ominously omnipresent rumble of these two powers mobilizing for war was unmistakable, even in a New York at last emerging from the Great Depression. Even the latest Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers movie—previously a guarantee of light, frothy escapism—ended with the death of Astaire’s real-life character, shot down in the war to end all wars just twenty-one years earlier. The film in question, The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle, was due to make its New York premiere on March 30, 1939. As an RKO production, Radio City Music Hall was again booked to play host to this, the ninth (and last) Astaire-Rogers RKO movie. It had been announced back in January that this would be the final film in the series. Director Mark Sandrich was leaving RKO, having never received any kind of percentage deal on the highly lucrative movies he had made with the pair. Fred Astaire was also at the end of his contract with RKO and was looking to change partners on a more regular basis in the future. Nor did the series’ producer, Pandro S. Berman, look long for the organization. The simple fact was that the series had run its course, having been in irreversible decline since its sublime sixth installment, Swing Time, in the autumn of 1936.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n5\n\nRKO, though, hoped that returns from the ninth installment might tide them over until their new boss, George Schaefer, had his cherished independent production units up and running. After all, the Astaire-Rogers series of films had at times been almost singlehandedly responsible for keeping the modest film studio afloat. After going into equity receivership in 1933, RKO had struggled to return to an even keel, held under by crippling mortgages on its theater chain for much of the decade. Thanks largely to the two toe-tappers, RKO had begun making a profit in the last three years, even if profits had again begun to fall after Swing Time, from $2,514,734 in 1936 to $173,578 on 1938’s Carefree. The initial receipts for the ninth Astaire-Rogers movie proved a little ominous. It looked as though the film could even end up losing money, an unheard-of phenomenon for a series that had consistently reaped large profits for RKO. The commercial failure of The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle, which ended up losing $50,000, was a severe jolt to the studio executives, Pandro Berman in particular. He had been associated with the pair since their second movie. It was Berman who had agreed to replace Sam Briskin as RKO head of production—his second stint in the job—in the winter of 1938, having produced almost all of the studio’s big earners through the Depression years. Aside from half-a-dozen successful movies with Astaire and Rogers, there had been the Hepburn-Rogers vehicle Stage Door and Rogers’s solo vehicles such as Vivacious Lady and Fifth Avenue Girl, where she branched out from duo-dancing duties. But Berman disliked his responsibilities almost as much as the lack of opportunities for hands-on producing and when Leo Spitz, with whom he had a good rapport, stepped down as president of RKO, he was looking to move on. If there was a man who might have persuaded Berman to stick around, it was never going to be the new president of the corporation. The forty-nine-year-old George Schaefer, previously sales chief at Paramount and United Artists, and with twenty-four years’ experience in the industry, was brought in at the behest of major RKO shareholder Nelson Rockefeller. But Schaefer had no experience in\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n6\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nfilm production, though he had some grand ideas, few of which found favor with Berman. When the Hollywood Reporter suggested in an October 1938 bulletin that Schaefer intended to “step in with both feet,” Berman was already set against him. Schaefer promptly announced that the RKO lot would soon move to an independent unit basis, with each production unit financed by one of the banking groups connected to majority shareholders Atlas-Lehman. Berman despaired of the innovation and as early as February 1939 was asking to be released from his contract. He vehemently disagreed with Schaefer’s approach, which he felt was creating an organization divided against itself. However, feeling that he needed time to bring his schemes to fruition, Schaefer persuaded Berman to stay on until December, by which time he hoped that Berman’s departure would pass largely unnoticed. The new boss certainly had some grand plans for a company yet to come out of equity receivership. RKO remained far weaker than the four big Hollywood studios with whom they were competing commercially. If Paramount, Fox, MGM, and Warners all had substantial lots in Hollywood itself, sizeable theater chains across the States, and worldwide distribution, RKO had less Hollywood real estate, a smaller theater chain that was a constant drain on resources, and international distribution that was spotty at best. Schaefer remained unperturbed. In June 1939, at the annual RKO sales convention, he proceeded to announce a new season of fifty-eight features and an increase in the production budget of around 40 percent. He was also trumpeting a deal he had signed with two eminent Broadway producers, Max Gordon and Harry Goetz, by which he was to acquire Robert E. Sherwood’s Pulitzerwinning play Abe Lincoln in Illinois, along with The American Way, a work designed to appeal to the patriotism of a country still ambivalent about entering a war it would prefer to ignore. Schaefer boasted to his salesmen that he had paid half a million dollars for these properties and was “prepared to spend up to three million to produce them.” Paying such sums made a splash, even if\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n7\n\nthe films would not. Evidently, the new RKO boss was in love with the idea of serious movies and was turning to Broadway producers to help him achieve new credibility for a studio generally associated with dance and song. As Schaefer sat in the stalls at Radio City, watching the swan song of the old RKO’s most reliable pairing, less than half a mile away Orson Welles’s troupe of Mercury actors was preparing for a live recording of their weekly offering for the Campbell’s Playhouse radio series, an adaptation of Edna Ferber’s play Show Boat. The Playhouse series of hour-long, weekly shows had taken over from the Mercury Theatre on the Air after twenty-one sponsorless shows, thanks to a particularly notorious Halloween prank played by Welles on his unsuspecting listeners, under the guise of his namesake’s War of the Worlds. The twenty-four-year-old Welles had, in just over two years, become the wunderkind of New York theater, thanks primarily to two startling reinterpretations of Shakespeare plays, a “voodoo” Macbeth and an antifascist (Julius) Caesar; as well as a production of the radical, pro-labor play by Marc Blitzstein, The Cradle Will Rock, made under the auspices of the Federal Theater Program but then subject to an unsuccessful putsch by the WPA itself. In all of these endeavors he had worked in collaboration with an older and more experienced theatrical producer and cofounder of the Mercury, the seemingly besotted John Houseman (Welles later told fellow director Bogdanovich, in private conversation, that Houseman was “a closet homosexual.” His indulgences of his protégé certainly bear out such an interpretation, even though Houseman repeatedly applied more benign motives in his own account of these days, Runthrough). Houseman gave Welles an early insight into the ways in which a producer could be a valuable organizer and financier, as well as the price to be paid: a share in creative input wholly at odds with any likely aptitudes or insights. These theatrical productions had established the name of the Mercury Theatre in New York City and on the Eastern Seaboard, but it was only after Welles came up with the startlingly simple (yet\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n8\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nentirely original) idea of presenting H. G. Wells’s War of the Worlds as a series of increasingly frantic news bulletins on an otherwise innocuous showtime radio program that his fame spread as far as the West Coast, as did his weekly audience. The week before, Mercury’s weekly broadcast had attracted some 4 percent of radio-owning Americans; the week after, some 7.4 percent of the listening public tuned into Welles’s first adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness. In fact, the Mercury Theatre was in need of a fillip after its first theatrical flop, a production of George Buchner’s Danton’s Death, which premiered less than a week after the infamous broadcast but ran for just twenty-one performances. Their weekly radio show, too, was under threat of cancellation from a Columbia radio network unamused by the Halloween ruckus—that is, until they reached an agreement with Campbell’s to sponsor the show for the remainder of the season, commencing in its new guise with Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca on December 9, 1938. Welles, though, had already indicated that he might prove a most unwilling sponsoree. In an interview for the New York Times, two months before the War of the Worlds broadcast, he suggested that “While I have no quarrel with the commercial sponsorship of radio programs . . . I do find fault with the fact that the broadcasters, in presenting a program, develop it along lines pleasing to the sponsor, rather than to the radio audience itself, for whom it is really intended.” Unfortunately, Welles knew all too well that he needed this sponsorship deal, even though it quickly became apparent, in John Houseman’s words, “that our life with Campbell’s Soups was going to be less agreeable than when we were our own masters.” Welles already had an outlandishly ambitious theatrical production in mind for Mercury’s spring presentation, a segue of Shakespeare’s four War of the Roses plays into a single evening of Five Kings, so he needed the heightened profile to entice investors after Danton died a death. A week of dress rehearsals in Washington, D.C. in March and a further week in Philadelphia merely confirmed the impracticality of\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n9\n\nthe whole Five Kings project. Faced with a form of financial hemorrhaging that even recently replenished revenue from radio could not stem, Welles was obliged to abandon a second consecutive flop before it limped into New York. Another failure, on or off Broadway, would have applied an irredeemable taint to the troupe’s burgeoning reputation, so the Five Kings was quietly put to sleep (to be awakened when Welles’s career as an American director was over, recast as the story of Falstaff in the bittersweet Chimes at Midnight). Not that Welles abandoned his pet project easily. Seventeen tons of scenery were shipped to New York, initially, and then into the limbo of storage; while Orson himself announced that he would not shave off his new goatee beard until he had appeared as Falstaff on a New York stage. Just when it seemed that any further sources of income had dried up, Welles found himself being courted by the new boss at RKO, hoping to convince the maverick director to make a pair of films for the ailing studio. Welles expressed very little interest and almost no knowledge of the film medium, while demanding total artistic control of any project he might turn his hand to—whatever the media. Schaefer, who had seen the Mercury on stage, was greatly enamored of Welles’s theatrical productions and was looking for a personality to help stamp his own imprint on the company he had barely begun to oversee. Common ground was found. Schaefer seems to have quickly realized that much of Welles’s professed indifference was a sham, though his demands were not. He also knew Welles had been approached by more prestigious studios, who continued to rely on the usual come-to-Hollywood-andsell-your-soul patois to persuade their man. Schaefer’s edge lay in the independence he was prepared to offer the young man, the limits of which grew ever less stringent with each rejected offer, as Welles continued to play hardball until he got what he wanted—the right to the final cut of whatever film he chose to make. Now there was a radical idea! For all his studied disinterest, Welles had learned enough about Hollywood to know that trust was a surgical appliance one wore after\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n10\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\na hernia operation and honor was another term for “judge.” He also knew far more about movies than he was letting on. Indeed, he had attempted to shoot his first “short” the previous fall, when he had hit upon the idea of prefacing a farce (Too Much Johnson) he planned to present at a summer festival with what Billboard called “a motion picture prologue, to let the audience [in] on what’s happened before the start of the play.” According to Welles, he actually screened this “short” for RKO executives as proof that their faith would be well placed.* If we can believe an anecdote Welles later related in a syndicated column (and, contrary to Callow, not all such stories smack solely of mythmaking), he had enjoyed a brief spell as an anonymous film critic in his youth, replacing a “drunken movie critic in a city which shall be nameless—and a newspaper which should be. I was his ghostwriter for a time. I got real money for this and he was well pleased with my work, since he was never sober enough to read it.” (This suggests a possible inspiration for the memorable scene in Citizen Kane where Kane rewrites Leland’s review of his mistress’s opera debut).† There certainly seem to be far too many allusions to the movies of his youth in later comments for the myth of Welles the virgin moviegoer to still endure. As it happens, a contemporary namecheck had already given the game away. At the end of a Mercury radio performance of John Buchan’s The 39 Steps on August 1, 1938, Welles took the first of a number of little “pops” at Alfred Hitchcock’s balloon: Ladies and gentlemen, if you missed Madeleine Carroll in our “stage” version of The 39 Steps, the young lady in the movie, in common with almost anything else in that movie, was the child of its director’s own unparalleled and unpredictable fancy. If you missed anything you must blame Mr. Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n*Sadly,\n\nthe last surviving copy of the Too Much Johnson short was lost in a fire at Welles’s home in Spain in 1970. †Mankiewicz\n\nliked to relate a similar incident when he was theater critic for the New York Times in October 1925 and failed to review a particularly bad production of School for Scandal due to being thoroughly intoxicated.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n11\n\nWelles later professed to be a great fan of Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps, bemoaning the fact that he then “gave in to Hollywood and . . . lost all the charm of his English style.” He had no such intention of giving in, having already identified the central problem with the studio system, which he shared with a symposium on Hollywood in the fall of 1939, while he awaited the opportunity to begin shooting his own Hollywood debut: What I don’t like about Hollywood films is the “gang” movie and I don’t mean the Dead End Kids. I mean the assembly-line method of manufacturing entertainment developed in the last fifteen years or so, and I share this prejudice with practically everybody whose craft is the actual making of a movie, and not just . . . the business of selling it. When too many cooks get together, they find, usually, the least common denominator of dramatic interest.\n\nWelles was careful to hide his own cinematic influences from the new RKO boss, but they are fully demonstrated by two documents from the 1950s, after he had found Hollywood too rich for his poet’s blood. These documents suggest an early interest in, and appreciation of, the medium. In 1952 Welles was one of a number of directors asked to supply a personal top ten for the first Sight and Sound poll of best films. Of the ten films he selected, just one—a decidedly obscure movie by Vittorio de Sica, Shoeshine (1946)— postdated Welles’s own immersion in the art form. The other nine, in chronological order, were as follows: Intolerance (1916); Nanook of the North (1922); Greed (1923); Potemkin (1925); Our Daily Bread (1928); City Lights (1931); Le Grand Illusion (1937); The Baker’s Wife (1938); and Stagecoach (1939). The relevant directors—Griffith, Flaherty, Von Stroheim, Eisenstein, King Vidor, Chaplin, Renoir, Pagnol, and Ford—represented Welles’s personal pantheon of influences. They also suggested someone whose appreciation of the art form preceded any contribution of his own. Welles’s view of the important figures in film hardly changed in the ensuing years. In a list given to his French secretary, Maurice Bessy, the directors he considered originators of the major branches\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n12\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nof cinema were as follows: Georges Meliés, D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Erich von Stroheim, Mack Sennett, F. W. Murnau, Jacques Feyder, Sergei Eisenstein, Jean Renoir, Ernst Lubitsch, and Robert Flaherty. Exempting himself from the four branches he delineated— storytellers, poets, filmmakers, and entertainers—Welles saw his own work as a form of inheritance from Meliés and Griffith. If Welles reserved little time for those who came after him, he had prepped well for this unexpected opportunity. He implicitly recognized the power of the medium before he ever cranked a camera. As he wrote in Stage, three months before Citizen Kane premiered, “Hollywood is still a frontier. That it should be after all these years . . . is to the movies’ shame and our advantage. . . . The dramatist—newly equipped with an imagery which is simply the image itself—more literal than sight and more eloquent than modern language . . . is again capable of poetry.” And it was fortuitous timing in another way too. By the time Schaefer began to whisper in his ear, Welles was already starting to despair of the New York theater and audiences that expected exciting, innovative fare twice a year. His view of the “casual theatergoer,” as expressed in an article written for Billboard the previous November, shortly after the failure of Danton’s Death, suggested a man who was no longer certain what that audience wanted: No matter how well a theater may succeed in organizing the organizable audience, its success or failure must be measured to a great degree by the desire of the casual theatergoer to see its individual productions . . . [for] he wants to see a good show at the least possible expense with the greatest possible convenience. . . . It is the necessity for educating this type of playgoer which is the greatest problem facing the practitioners of repertory.\n\nIn radio he could be more brazenly experimental, knowing that an unsuccessful broadcast was not the be-all and end-all. There would always be a chance to redeem oneself the following week. However, the particular deal with the devil he had made back in December 1938 as a means of ensuring the continuance of the Mer-\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n13\n\ncury Theatre on the Air had brought him nothing but frustration. Though Welles never lost his ability to charm and cajole, it was Campbell’s Soup, and in particular Diana Bourbon, program coordinator for Campbell’s Playhouse, who had the final say on story selection and content. Welles found he was frequently obliged to remind Bourbon that it was his show, on one occasion informing her in writing “that whatever gives our format individuality, beyond regular interest attaching itself to our guest, is my own extremely personal, rather particular style, which must needs express authentically my own enthusiasm and tastes.” And yet he remained unsure enough about his Hollywood option to sign on for a second Campbell’s season just weeks before Schaefer did indeed offer him what he was looking for. Bourbon was unimpressed by Welles’s displays of belligerence and they would tangle a few more times before the second series, which began in September 1939, ran its course in March 1940. When the end was in sight, Welles told one reporter why there would be no third season: “I’m sick of having the heart torn out of a script by radio censorship.” He was determined to ensure that he did not make the same mistake when it came to making movies. Though RKO retained the right to story refusal, with Welles they were contractually obliged to exercise “utmost good faith” and could not compel him to make any given film, or address specific subject matter. Welles already knew whom he wanted to emulate and how. As he duly informed Stage: I think a movie needs a boss. There has never been a motion picture of consequence that has not been, broadly speaking, the product of one man. This man has been the producer, could be the writer . . . [but] should be the director. . . . Good pictures . . . bear the signature . . . of this dominant personality: . . . Selznick, Zanuck, Thalberg, Guitry, Von Sternberg, Von Stroheim, Vidor, Capra, Ford, Menzies, Sturges, Chaplin, Sol Wurtzel. . . . This dominant personality is the essential of style in the motion picture art. When it is absent, a motion picture is a mere fabrication of the products of various studio departments from\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n14\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nthe set builder to the manufacturer of dialogue, as meaningless as any other merchandise achieved by mass production.\n\nSchaefer hoped for something unique from the “dominant personality” Welles was determined to be, having asserted in a memo to fellow executives, that “I was [only] able to secure Orson . . . because of my sympathy with his viewpoint that he did not want to . . . be tagged and cataloged.” He needed Welles to make his mark on RKO and Hollywood without delay. As John Houseman tersely observes in Runthrough, “RKO was a maverick operation, the victim of a long series of financial manipulations and changing managements . . . and [its] insecure boss . . . had little to lose and a lot to gain by putting a good many of his eggs into the hands of the Wonder Boy of Broadway and radio, who just might come through with a winner for him.” And so, on July 22, 1939, Orson Welles signed a provisional two-picture deal with the Hollywood studio. The deal, finalized four weeks later, comprised three separate contracts: a production agreement with “the Mercury Theatre” to “produce, direct, and write the screenplay for two pictures”; an employment agreement with Welles as actor; and a guarantee that Welles would personally deliver everything contained within the production agreement. It also provided for Welles to receive $35,000 as producer and $30,000 as actor, plus 20 percent of the net profits, for his first film; and $35,000 as actor and $25,000 as producer, plus 25 percent of the net profits of any second film. Most significantly, and controversially, it contained a “final cut” clause unprecedented in Hollywood history: “the distributor shall be entitled to confer with the producer on the final cutting and editing of each of the pictures prior to the delivery thereof, but the control of such cutting shall vest in the producer.” Though this was not the carte blanche contract that initial reports suggested—and even the usually circumspect New York Times had reported that “the studio will exercise no supervision over the picture, merely footing the bill”—the simple fact was that a twentyfour-year-old theatre director, with no experience in film, had been\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n15\n\ngiven the kind of contract for which the very directors Welles cited in Stage would have sold their families into slavery. Such a contract was bound to create its own obstacles, even before Welles arrived in the West Coast colony to begin work. As he told one interviewer in 1966, “The real problem was that contract . . . I had too much power”; and another, in 1975, “The first contract I had when I came out here to this town was a kind of defiance of everything that was established in the Hollywood industrial system . . . [but] I thought if I asked for [the] impossible they’d leave me alone.” At the same time Welles was obliged to convince those around him that any such jealousy was as water off a platypus. Joseph Cotten, one of the Mercury troupe that insulated him from much of the envy and animosity, even suggested in his autobiography that, though “green eyes were watching him; [and] claws were being exposed, I am not sure he realized it.” Welles knew all too well what happened when one set about threatening the status quo. After all, he’d been doing it for quite a while now: ORSON WELLES: I represented the ghost of Christmas future. Here was this guy with a beard who was going to do it all by [him]self. I was what was going to happen to that town. So I was hated and despised, theoretically, but I had all kinds of friends among the real dinosaurs, who were awfully nice to me, and I had a very good time. [1973]\n\nAt least the wannabe director got to enjoy a certain disinterest from those threatened with change for the first month of his stay. Although Welles arrived in town on July 20, the final draft of the fabled contract would not be agreed until August 21. Only then did its details become common knowledge. Meanwhile, he kept himself busy making and renewing contacts of his own. Almost his first social engagement was at the house of the Huxleys, Aldous and Maria, in Pacific Palisades. On July 30 Welles was one of a dozen guests invited to celebrate Huxley’s forty-fifth birthday and the completion of his latest novel, After Many a Summer Dies a Swan, set at\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n16\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\na thinly veiled San Simeon, where a Hearstian mogul spends his days with a young, flirtatious mistress, and his money on ways of delaying death (a theme Welles tackled head-on in the television pilot Fountain of Youth, where the professor’s Austrian partner is even compared to an old, ugly monkey, à la Huxley’s lost lord). It seems inconceivable that Welles did not inquire about his host’s latest work; nor Huxley ask about the film projects Welles had in mind, from Cyrano de Bergerac to a Joseph Conrad novella about a man’s journey into the jungle to find another lost soul. Huxley, who had settled in Hollywood less than two years earlier, already an eminent literary figure and bestselling author of influential dystopia Brave New World, doubtless had his own words of warning for Welles. He had already found that the only reputation worth having in Hollywood was one earned there. Another soul happy to befriend Welles in those early months was Preston Sturges. According to Welles, they had first met when he was just thirteen, staying “great chums . . . right up till the end of his life” in 1959. He would be the only American contemporary Welles cited in his “Major Branches of Cinema”; as well as warranting a mention as one of the “dominant personalities” of cinema in Welles’s February 1941 Stage article, at a time when Sturges had just two credits as a writer-director to his name (The Great McGinty and Christmas in July). Sturges was also awaiting his first opportunity to prove his worth as a writer-director when Welles arrived in town, having come to Hollywood as a successful playwright-turned-screenwriter back in 1932, one of the legions who never intended to stay but somehow never left. As he memorably recalled in his autobiography, “It took me exactly two days on the job as a hired writer, or until I met my first director, to find out that I was in the wrong racket.” Despite being credited with inventing something called “narratage” a year after his arrival for his nonchronological, told-in-flashback screenplay of a tycoon’s rise and fall, The Power and the Glory, Sturges had spent a frustrating further six years trying to convince first Universal and then Paramount to let him direct one of his own\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n17\n\nscripts. Only when he made it clear that he would actually quit the studio, in the early months of 1939, did Paramount head of production William LeBaron finally relent and allow Sturges to direct a low-budget movie of a script he had written straight after The Power and the Glory, The Vagrant (a.k.a. The Great McGinty). The contract for Sturges to make his own movie on his own terms, albeit with a Paramount producer as chaperone, was signed just two days after Welles’s more fabled document. If Sturges envied Welles his contract, it never interfered with their friendship; and in those months before they started their tiny revolt against the hegemony of producers they doubtless compared strategies. Both would win their only Oscars for the original screenplays of their directorial debuts. From the day he arrived in town Welles was obliged to tie his mast to Schaefer’s sail. The RKO ship, though, was never a steady one, and Schaefer had at least as many green eyes watching him. When in September it was announced that Welles’s first project— an adaptation of Conrad’s Heart of Darkness—had a provisional budget of $750,000, Hollywood Reporter editor James Wilkerson questioned Schaefer’s sense of priorities in print: “Mr. Schaefer evidently does not think an investment of $750,000 or more with an untried producer, writer, director, with a questionable story and a rumored cast of players who, for the most part, have never seen a camera, is a necessary cut in these critical times.” If Schaefer was obliged to play the diplomat, it was not Welles’s style to go out of his way to smooth his own path. After he threw the traditional Hollywood arrival party, to which, Vogue cruelly claimed, “nobody who was anybody came. . . . In fact, nobody who was nobody [came],” Welles abandoned any attempt to ingratiate himself. When he had his tie cut in Chasen’s restaurant by B-movie actor Ward Bond, “we went out in the parking lot and had it out.” Though Welles would later claim that “Hollywood has more to say against me, and says it, than I have to say against Hollywood,” his ambivalence about the place continued to perplex him. When asked to write about Hollywood for Esquire, shortly after his return\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n18\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nthere in the 1950s, he did not spare his feelings re the place, nor his longing for the frisson New York always gave him: The metropolitan air is what one misses. Neither the theater nor its artists are at their best work in a suburb. Or a gigantic trailer camp. Whether we work before a camera or behind the footlights, actors are, by nature, city people. Hollywood is most precisely described as a colony . . . [and] colonies are notoriously somewhat cut off from reality, insular, bitchy and cliquish, snobbish—a bit loose as to morals but very strict as to appearances.\n\nIf he does seem to have had “a very good time” initially, he would ruefully reconsider the place in later life, after reading “a group of books about Hollywood that [my daughter] bought . . . When I take my own life out of it, and see what they did to other people, I [can] see that the story of that town was a dirty one.” It seems amazing that Welles should exclude himself from those it wronged, but he never envisaged becoming one of those long-term Hollywood habitués, “deeply tanned but unresigned to the sunshine and the flowers . . . confidently expect[ing] to take the next boat home.” He was already informing some, “If they let me do a second picture, I’m lucky.” As of September 1939, it looked like they might not even let him make his first. ◆\n\n◆\n\n◆\n\n◆\n\nHe had settled upon Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness as the raw material for his first film, believing it to be, as he later introduced it on the radio, “a downright incantation, [in which] we are almost persuaded that there is something essential waiting for all of us in the dark areas of the world.” He seemed to be taking precious little notice of the clause Schaefer inserted in his contract, which stated that, though he had free rein on subject matter, his first film could not be “political or controversial.” Welles already envisaged Heart of Darkness as an antifascist allegory, in which the looming threat to\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n19\n\nworld peace from Europe’s right-wing dictators was personified in the character of Kurtz. Also implicit would be the case for America’s intervention and against international isolation, reflected in the actions of the film’s narrator, Marlow. In Welles’s screenplay, Kurtz was made to espouse the view that “the leader, the strong voice of authority, is the highest expression of our culture—the fulfillment of superior race,” which owed far more to Nietzsche than Conrad. Marlow, meanwhile, was made out to be a perennial fence-sitter. When asked about his politics, at the outset of the script, he insists, “I have no sympathies one way or another. I’m just here to run a boat.” Only after he has traveled into the heart of a personal darkness does he come to understand the threat that men like Kurtz represent; and only then does he turn to the viewer—the only time Marlow’s face would have been seen in the film, almost filling the screen as he looks directly into the lens—to say: You can’t understand [a man like Kurtz]. How could you? With solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind neighbors ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums—how can you imagine what particular region of the first ages a man’s untrammeled feet may take him into?\n\nI somehow doubt that Welles highlighted these elements in his personal “pitch” to Schaefer. As long as he required Schaefer’s approval to proceed, he preferred to keep the themes of the film vague, though he informed his own publicist, Herb Drake, that “the picture is, frankly, an attack on the Nazi system.” RKO received no such guidance, even if a September 15 memo, ostensibly from Welles’s mouthpiece, Drake, admitted that the film was “definitely NOT love in the tropics . . . Everyone and everything is just a bit off normal, just a little oblique.” But Welles was a man who had managed to make parallels between the murder of a would-be dictator two thousand years ago and events today in his highly praised précis of Shakespeare’s Julius\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n20\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nCaesar. So perhaps such a leap should have been expected. He could hardly deny it once the script appeared. Indeed, when the film entered its production phase and Welles was obliged to come up with a press release, he was unabashed about its contemporary relevance, “[Heart of Darkness is] the story of an ordinary guy (Marlow) thrown into the company of evil men . . . representing every variety of the fascist mentality and morality. They are the vicious but not very intelligent class of person which is now attempting to take control of the world.” Though he would ultimately be obliged to abandon Heart of Darkness, Welles would continue to address the threat of world fascism in projects he presented to RKO. In the screenplay for The Smiler with a Knife, another possible pre–Citizen Kane project, he had Strangeways, a Wellesian figure, suggest that the American people may let a dictator in though the back door: “They’ll never give a politician that much power. [But] how about a hero? We like heroes over here. And this one won’t talk like a dictator. He’ll look like a movie star, and everybody will love him.” And in The Way to Santiago, a political thriller he intended to shoot immediately after Citizen Kane, one character Welles based on Lord Haw-Haw outlined a crash course for just such a coup d’état: Mr. England: Everything must move at the same time. We found that out in Europe. The terrorist provocation must break out simultaneously all through the country so that the public will be stunned and bewildered. They’ll realize that only a strong man with dictatorial powers can save them . . . There’ll be opposition from the unions and the peasant leagues. If there isn’t, we’ll make it. We’ll jail the leaders, install our own people as the executives, rig a case against the head of the labor movement for misappropriation of union funds, and there we are. Purpose accomplished, minimum of discomfort for everybody.\n\nDuring the early stages of the Heart of Darkness project, though, Welles was careful to tone down any overt didacticism. The September 15 memo, if anything, reads like an extended send-up of the\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n21\n\natypical Hollywood thriller, rather than what it really was: an exercise in revealing as little as possible about the real themes its director intended to address. The memo may even have played a small part in starting the myth that Welles never had a firm handle on this film, nor a clear idea of how it might get made: The story is of a man and girl in love. They are separated by his career at the moment and the girl is coming to find him. The man is exploiting the river as a trader and as an explorer and is the head man of a whole company that is doing this in the name of a nonnamed foreign government. Girl goes to help rescue him since he has gone beyond the point reached by any of his assistants and has been missing for some months. There is a hell of an adventure going up the river. The action takes place largely on board a rusty stern-wheel paddle steamer at the stations of the trading company along the shore. There is an unhappy ending which we won’t need to mention, man dies and the girl goes away unfulfilled. There are cannibals, shootings, petty bickerings among the bureaucrats, native dances, a fascinating girl, gorgeous, but black, a real Negro type. She has an inferred, but not definitely stated, jungle love life with our hero. There is a jungle in flames and heavy storms of a spectacular nature. . . . It all builds to a terrific climax in story when the man, Kurtz, is found at last. The jungle is set on fire and quenched by a storm. . . . We feel that once we get the audience in the theater it will go away completely thrilled and satisfied by the film even though [it] is not exactly in the boy-meetsgirl tradition.\n\nIn those summer months Welles continued to work hard on this script that was hardly “in the boy-meets-girl tradition,” contradicting Houseman’s claim in his autobiography that, after arriving in California at this time, “every member of the organization . . . [wished to take] me aside to tell me that there was still no script for Heart of Darkness.” Welles delivered a first draft at the end of October 1939, shortly after spending his first night with a real movie camera in a genuine Hollywood studio. It ran to over 200 pages (most\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n22\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nscripts ran between 120 and 140 pages.). If anything, Welles may have applied himself too much to this part of the process. He later informed Peter Bogdanovich that he “did a very elaborate preparation for that [film], such as I’ve never done again . . . I [may even have] shot my bolt on preproduction of that picture.” Certainly the studio staff was unused to the kind of demands this whippersnapper of a workaholic made on them. Starting in midAugust, there was a constant stream of requests for films to obtain for screening, some of which were simply intended to provide Welles with the requisite perspective. Along with the rushes for the secondmost expensive film RKO had made to date, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, these included two of the films Welles later included in his top ten, Jean Renoir’s Le Grand Illusion and John Ford’s Stagecoach. Much has been made of the multiple screenings of Stagecoach that Welles now undertook, but the fact is that it gave him an excellent template with which to understand the practical relevance of the various types of camera shots contained in a handmade textbook his assistant, Miriam Geiger, had compiled for him. As Welles later informed Cahiers du Cinema, “I didn’t need to learn from somebody who had something to say, but from somebody who would show me how to say what I had in mind; and John Ford is perfect for that.” However, it was the search for good jungle footage that increasingly occupied Welles in the months of August and September, as he sought both for an effective approach to shooting such scenes and a way of reducing the potentially substantial costs (inserting existing footage where feasible). He already knew enough to be concerned about the likely cost of shooting such a film largely on location. One internal memo, from some RKO employee searching for a film called White Gods, reports, “Can’t find print as yet. [But] wellphotographed picture of the Equadorean jungles; the life and customs of the Abarishi Indians—primitive men who never glimpsed a white man.” After weeks of scurrying, a handwritten note informs, “9/7 Orson will see in NY.” Another film, entitled Wajan, is damned with faint praise as “best Bali film yet produced. Additional advantage of good sound and photography.” When Welles asked about a\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n23\n\npossible insert, though, the best Balinese cinema had to offer proved too much for his purse. Welles had another, more pressing problem—one entirely of his own making. He had hit upon a wholly original way of shooting Heart of Darkness that would be in the spirit of Conrad and also announce him to Hollywood. He just wasn’t sure it would work, and if it did, how much effort it might entail. That September 15 memo alluded to the story being “told in an entirely new way,” while admitting that said methodology was “in the experimental stage, so [Welles] doesn’t wish to mention it until we can find a convenient formula to express its meaning.” Welles had now decided to shoot the film as if the camera represented Marlow’s line of vision—to make the first film in history that not only told its tale in first-person narrative but took the actual vantage of its narrator. Though he had yet to figure out how he might arrive at “a convenient formula,” Welles knew it would not be easy—or cheap. Less than a month later, he arranged to send an undated memo, marked simply “Camera,” detailing for the denizens of RKO just how one might go about shooting such a film: In filming Heart of Darkness the intention is to operate the camera so that, aesthetically speaking, there will be no interruption of action at any time, no cuts . . . [because] the camera has to function not only as a mechanical recording device but as a character. . . . Since the camera will be a character for the first time in its existence, it is going to have to undergo some changes . . . including several new gadgets[:] . . . a baby crane-trick calibrating device to handle the business of the “feather wipe” and a camera with a gyroscope mounted on it. . . . With cameras now in use, “tests indicate” a feeling of terrible stiffness, a mechanical effect, is noted. With the gyroscopic camera held in the hands of the cameraman himself a more casual effect is produced. . . . The feather wipe is a wipe on texture, say a wall. . . . The devices used will include dissolves but the action will never be interrupted for a second. This means, instead of cutting the picture here and there, you can only remove a whole sequence if you wish to shorten it. This operates to the\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n24\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\ngreat advantage of the scenario since it means absolute perfection of preparation before any camera turns. It is not possible to shoot “off the cuff,” nor is it possible to start a camera with only half the script written. This also means a tremendous saving in actual film.\n\nSchaefer’s reaction to this memo has not been recorded, but he must have been a mighty worried man. However, until he saw an actual screenplay, he was unable to comment on the practical realities. After all, the memo’s author wisely observed, “it is not possible to shoot ‘off-the-cuff,’ nor is it possible to start a camera with only half the script written.” Schaefer awaited the first draft with interest. Welles, meanwhile, was brimming with ideas, as he ripped into his copy of Conrad, writing and rewriting the novella to fit in with a preordained structure all his own. In a story outline drawn up in the early days of the project, Welles divided the tale into six stages, each stage having its own visual metaphor, provided by the jungle itself. In the first stage, the jungle would be teeming with life, whereas the second and third stages would see the river close in, until the river became “nothing but a place cut out of this ghostly world by the steamer itself.” By the fourth stage, dead cypress trees would envelop the boat; and by the fifth, the river would have become little more than a marsh, until it finally all but disappeared at the final outpost. A version of this scheme was still in place when the memo of September 15 was written. It speaks of how the “jungle . . . changes in mood and intensity as the boat travels up the river. Said river gets narrower, the terrain changes from Savannah and open plains to woods, from woods to forest, from forest to jungle and all the time the excitement grows. . . . At the end, the boat is actually pushing aside the overhanging vines and creepers as it makes its last dash to the final station.” But Welles’s imagination was already running away with him, and he eventually had to abandon the six-tier scheme as impractical, reverting to subtler gradations of the jungle’s decay as the boat makes its way into the interior. This meant another revision of the draft screenplay.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n25\n\nWelles had initially turned to his Mercury cofounder, John Houseman, for help with the script. Houseman recalls in his own book how “we wandered around the sound stages and talked about Heart of Darkness, which Orson had just announced—with considerable fanfare and without consulting me [my italics]—as his first picture.” Houseman, by his own admission, was “frightened by the necessities of an unfamiliar medium” and was “unable to give him anything at all,” so Welles was ultimately required to find his way alone. If Houseman was no longer a necessary collaborator, Conrad proved an equally circumspect partner in the process. Welles had developed something of a reputation in New York for disrespecting source material. New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson had described his Macbeth as “a voodoo show inspired by the Macbeth legend”; while a Billboard report on the film prologue he intended to shoot for Too Much Johnson suggested that he had perhaps “succumbed again to his passion for chopping scripts to pieces.” Welles felt self-conscious enough about this reputation to insist on an essential reverence for his literary source in Mercury memos to RKO, asserting that, “while he is changing the locale from the Belgian Congo to an unnamed river and unnamed place, and . . . adding characters and moving the girl from Europe to the river, he is in no way violating Conrad . . . his treatment of Heart of Darkness [being] completely in the Conrad spirit.” Perhaps so, but a loose-leaf page in Welles’s marked-up copy of the novella (see illustration at head of chapter) contains a single scrawled sentence, in that unmistakeable hand, which turns the book’s theme on its head: “Kurtz is the Byron of a totalitarian state—what Byron would be if he had become president of Greece.” * If Kurtz became recast as some would-be Byronic dictator, the role of Elsa, Kurtz’s girlfriend, who only appears right at the end of the book, was dramatically expanded by Welles, who possibly felt *Peter\n\nConrad, in Orson Welles: Stories of His Life, suggests that Welles saw himself as a Byron, but the identification here is clearly between Kurtz and Byron, not Welles and Byron.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n26\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nobliged to abide by at least one Hollywood convention. Rather than hearing of Kurtz’s fate at the story’s end, Elsa accompanies Marlow on his journey, providing not only the so-called “love interest,” but adding another dynamic to Marlow’s identification with, and envy of, Kurtz (made manifest by Welles’s decision to play both parts). The most dramatic amplification of this dynamic came when Welles turned Marlow’s dream/vision of Kurtz at the book’s end into a full-blown apparition, which dissolves (literally!) into a funeral procession for the great man. Whereas Conrad’s Marlow simply “had a vision of him . . . with that wide immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing, all the universe,” Welles’s Marlow says instead, “I saw him again—months later, at the foot of the river—I saw him. With Elsa—I saw those eyes—that wide immense stare condemning, loathing the whole universe—piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness.” The shot promptly dissolves into the dining hall of the river station. It is night, and it is raining. The camera pans toward the doorway, and we see, though only in silhouette, Kurtz being borne on a litter, with ivory-bearers behind and before: The door, in far corner of the room, opens now, throwing a dim angled pattern of light across the corrugated iron wall at the back, seen through the silhouette of Kurtz. This washes out the last impressions of the jungle and the campfires, but the silhouette of Kurtz’s head remains, although it appears more faintly in the composition. Elsa comes out of the door and stops there, looking toward [the] camera. As she speaks, there sneaks in on the soundtrack—very, very faintly— the love strains of Elsa’s waltz. . . . She carries the lamp with her as she moves toward camera until, as she speaks . . . the light of the lamp [is] showing her face and rendering the silhouette of Kurtz very pale so that as she moves in, it almost vanishes from the screen and only its outlines can be made out, framing her face. The appearance of the light, however, and its intensification is synonymous with the appearance in their proper proportions of the shadow of Kurtz’s eyes, which gleam luminously into the lens.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n27\n\nELSA (looking intently at Marlow): You were with him when he died . . . [Marlow hears in his head Kurtz’s last words:] The Horror! The Horror! After Kurtz’s voice is heard, the last indication of his silhouette dims off the screen and, as the sound of his voice fades away, his eyes glow out and disappear like dying coals. At the sound of his voice the tiny murmur of the waltz is no more.\n\nThis would be terrific stuff for a Huston or a Ford, at the top of their game. For a novice without a single film to his name it suggests somebody already capable of conceptualizing something remarkably cinematic. Even this early in his career, Welles had a real flair for dramatic staging, especially of funerals (most memorably in Othello). The Heart of Darkness script—which is all that remains of the film Welles had in his head—suggests that Kurtz’s could have been another triumphant set piece. Nor was Welles’s visual imagination content to run its course there. After Marlow reassures Elsa with a white lie, hiding the awful truth from her, Welles sought to visualize the idea of the darkness closing in on them both. For Conrad, it was easy enough to say that “with every word spoken the room was growing darker.” For Welles, though, this would not do. Initially, he added the following lines in the margin of his copy of Conrad, “triumphant darkness—from which I could not have defended her—from which I could not even defend myself,” an insight into Marlow’s thought processes. The challenge remained: how to visualize such an idea. His solution was ingenious. As Elsa’s eyes fill up with tears she begins to look beyond the lens of the camera, i.e. Marlow’s eyes. Then, as the music fades in, she appears as in a spotlight on a stage. As the camera dollies back, “the set lighting dims out so that as this shot completes itself, Elsa is seen very small in the aperture . . . with nothing but darkness around her.” At this point we return to New York harbor. Marlow is musing about whether he should have told her the truth. The night closes in and the credits roll. Even Conrad might have been impressed.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n28\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nWhere Welles was fully released from any textual reverence, selfimposed or otherwise, was in the prologue, through which he aimed to both introduce himself and lead the audience by its metaphorical hand into the heart of darkness. He hoped that by using a series of daring devices, the aware spectator might recognize that s/he was being, in Brecht’s words, “put in a position where [s/]he can make comparisons about everything that influences the way in which human beings behave.” As James Naremore notes in The Magic World of Orson Welles, the entire prologue was intended to “cut against the grain of the impersonal factory style, serving both as an entertaining device and as a commentary upon the illusory, potentially authoritarian nature of the medium.” This prologue would have begun with the disembodied voice of Welles, familiar to anyone who had a radio set in America. Almost immediately he asks the viewer “to divide this audience into two parts—you and everybody else in the theater,” before placing the viewer at the end of a gun barrel, then as a reluctant talking parrot, and finally in an electric chair, as a convict about to face the death penalty. Even Welles cannot have expected to get the climax to the latter scene past the censorious Hays Office. “Sound of current being turned on. Screen goes into blinding red stain. Camera blurring its focus at the same time, moves quickly to electrician whose outline distorts terribly, melts into dirty violet, and sound of current [is] magnified into terrific metallic ring.” As the screen reverts to black Welles insists that “there is no cause for alarm.” He was merely fulfilling an intention previously expressed in the memo, to demonstrate that “the audience plays a key part in this film.” His next sleight of camera-hand would have involved turning the camera back upon itself, showing the viewer “what you ought to look like to me,” before cutting to the interior of a movie theater as the camera pans down from the projection booth to the orchestra floor, to find that “the audience is entirely made up of motion picture cameras” (Welles uses the subjective camera in a similar way in Citizen Kane’s famous Chicago Opera House scene, where Susan the Camera peers out into an expectant audito-\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n29\n\nrium, but only sees what one actually would, a black void). As he expresses the hope that we “get the idea,” a human eye appears on the screen, then an equal sign and a capital “I.” The eye winks and we dissolve into the heart of darkness. Having indulged in such a shameless display of visual bravado, the opening scene of the film proper would have applied all that Welles had learned from his years in radio to make the film’s soundtrack as evocative and authentic to the spectator as its images. After a series of lap dissolves introduced the viewer to the familiar landmarks of New York, and as the parkways, boulevards, and skyscrapers were in turn illuminated, s/he would have heard the sounds of the city in “snatches of sound and music, the beginnings of life of the city at night”: In Central Park, snatches of jazz music is heard from the radios in the moving taxicabs. The sweet dinner music in the restaurants of the big hotels further west. The throb of tom-toms foreshadow the jungle music of the story to come. The lament of brasses, the gala noodling of big orchestras tuning up in concert halls and opera houses, and finally, as the camera finds its way downtown below Broadway, the music freezes into an expression of the empty shopping district of the deserted Battery—the mournful muted clangor of the bell buoys out at sea, and the hoot of shipping.\n\nThe idea of different musical themes bleeding into one another, their spirit immediately evoking a time and place, was one idea Welles filed away after Heart of Darkness went unrealized, to reappear in the “restored” Touch of Evil, during that memorable opening crane shot, as the cafes and bars vie with each other in a Mexican musical spat. For Heart of Darkness Welles planned to introduce a number of auditory innovations into a medium in which the soundtrack had for\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n30\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\ntoo long been considered a poor relation of the image. The overlapping dialogue that became such a feature of Citizen Kane would have been equally evident in Heart of Darkness. In his screenplay, Welles prefaced a crucial dining-room scene involving Marlow, Elsa, and the manager, Blauer, by stating that “there is no attempt to focus on faces for definite speeches; all the speeches will overlap preceding ones so that we will hear a jumbled conversation, [but] with important words and phrases . . . standing out distinctly on the soundtrack.” In another scene, where Kurtz is finally taken away from the natives, Welles intended to let the music ebb and flow, counterpointing events as they unfolded. When the camera panned to the crowd of natives thronging the shore, “music fills the soundtrack . . . so that the dialogue [on board the boat] cannot be heard.” But when the boat has finally begun to pull away from the shore, “the music is heard—and the music itself expresses—the throb of the engines as the boat moves away.” The most potentially moving (if controversial) use of sound as planned would have come early in the film, as Marlow was walking up the hill toward the settlement. Here he would witness firsthand the way that his fellow white men treated the natives. Initially, as he turns to look back at the harbor, he hears a native “singing a mournful lament.” As he sees a chain gang approaching, this lament continues and we register the identity of the singer. The chain gang then proceeds up the hill. The next scene in the screenplay is of “a big, ridiculous hole in the face of the mud bank. In it, frying in the sun, are about thirtyfive dying savages and a lot of broken drainpipes. Into some of these pipes the natives have crawled, the better to expire. The whole picture is one of terrible desolation and despair. As Marlow looks down to the singer, who is one of this number and who is lying on a little ledge, the camera pans down . . . registering . . . a Negro face, the eyes staring up into the lens.” Here Welles has distilled the essence of Conrad, adding his own powerful visual image of the natives crawling into the pipes. But as Marlow walks away from the devastation, the lament continues to echo through the soundtrack, until\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 31\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n31\n\nhe arrives at the settlement itself and the “sound of the native’s voice blends gradually into the tinkle of a piano which comes from the dining hall.” This was not intended to be the last we saw (or heard) of the dying. When Marlow meets the manager Blauer, he comes upon one of the white colonists, Brandenburg, in the last throes of a fatal fever, lying on a mattress in the outer office. Blauer, a true humanitarian, closes the door behind Marlow, saying, “The groans of the dying man make it difficult to work.” It is a comment on all that Marlow has witnessed or will witness. As Blauer tells him about the man Kurtz, the soundtrack and camera work (sic) conspire to render his thoughts irrelevant: Blauer’s voice . . . is now overwhelmed by music. This music makes reference to Blauer’s voice, to the groans of the dying man, to the tinkle of Eddie’s piano, to the somber overtones of the New York harbor. Blauer is seen to be still talking, but we cannot distinguish what he says. As this happens the camera starts to pull back, smoothly but swiftly. Simultaneously with this movement of the camera, Blauer’s image begins to wash out. . . . When [the camera] gets outside door of Blauer’s office [it] then starts to rise . . . gradually and solemnly, [before it] angles down to the floor so that we again see the dying man. This is the last clear impression we get on the fading interior.\n\nIf this depiction of man’s indifference to man was not enough to send shivers down Schaefer’s spine, Welles added precious few sops to Conrad’s acid depiction of rank imperialism. Taken verbatim from Conrad was one speech Marlow recited in its entirety, “It’s not a pretty thing when you look into it too much, the conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion, or slightly different-shaped noses than ourselves. What tries to redeem it is the idea at the back of it.” Nor can Welles’s reference to Kurtz’s “inferred . . . jungle love life with a gorgeous [girl], but black, a real Negro type,” have gone down well at the president’s table.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n32\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 32\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nYet there is an even more shocking notion incorporated into the script by Welles, in a starker form than Conrad. The native crew on the white man’s boat wishes to capture some of the primitives threatening them, with a view to dining on them. The white crew, though, hold no such appeal in the culinary department. Whereas Conrad contemplates the various reasons why they might be so unappetizing, Welles directly implies “that civilized man is no longer nourishing.” As Bret Wood suggests in his bio-bibliography, this reference serves to underline “the idea that civilization corrupts the natural state of man.” The underlying idea expressed here may have eluded Schaefer (and most of his fellow executives), but they surely noticed one of the lines uttered by a frightened white crew member, that provided a neat summation of the essential plot to Welles’s film, “We’re going to be eaten by cannibals so you can rescue a corpse.” Did Schaefer really have any intimation that this was what he was about to receive? Had he read the Conrad original, or was he relying on the Mercury radio adaptation, as he was later to do with The Magnificent Ambersons? Guerric DeBona is certainly right to suggest, in a 1994 Cinema Journal article on the project, that “Welles’s film was shockingly unorthodox in its treatment of racial themes.” Though Heart of Darkness had been Welles’s chosen project since August, being specifically named in the final contract he signed with RKO, Schaefer had to wait until the second week in November for his first sight of a complete script. A 202-page script was delivered to RKO for mimeographing on November 7. Copies were immediately forwarded to Budgeting, the Hays Office, and Schaefer in New York. Welles’s first draft had apparently been finished a couple of weeks earlier, but it had not conformed to the accepted form in its scene divisions or camera directions. So Amalia Kent, an RKO script supervisor, had been drafted in to work directly with Welles, who proceeded to describe intended camera movements to her in some detail. Kent obligingly translated this into recognizable screenplay dialect.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 33\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n33\n\nNine days later Schaefer sent a note to Welles that was hardly the effusive response he might have hoped for. Rather, Schaefer predicted “a very unusual picture,” before querying the sheer number of voice-overs and questioning the wisdom of making such obvious political parallels. He was unhappy with a couple of clear allusions to Hitler at a time when America was still ostensibly neutral in what would be (for two years yet) an essentially European conflict. Kurtz’s dying tirade includes a particularly pointed reference, courtesy of Welles, “There’s a man now in Europe trying to do what I’ve done in the jungle. He will fail. In his madness he thinks he can’t fail— but he will.” By now, though, all the relevant studio wheels were in motion and Welles was confident that sheer momentum would keep everything moving forward. On October 18, he had breathlessly cabled Herb Drake, Mercury’s one business head and unit publicity director, “Had my first night with the movie cameras a few hours ago and I am wildly enthusiastic about the business, Orson.” In early November, he undertook a further four days of test shooting, using the scene at the First Station when Marlow first encounters Elsa. These vitally important tests did not go so well. According to Amalia Kent, Welles’s assistant assigned by RKO, “it was an enormously laborious and time-consuming process because of the elaborate camera movements and the intricate repositionings and measurements needed for the feather wipes.” The scene in question required six of these feather wipes, which Welles had devised as a way of making shots look continuous even when a number of cuts were used. The technique involved, in Robert Carringer’s words, “panning the camera to a stationary point, repositioning the camera but directing it at the same point, then continuing the pan in a new shot.” It was all part of an elaborate pretense that Welles was obliged to maintain to give a sense of the camera-as-Marlow passing from one room into another. It was an ingenious solution, but horrifically time-consuming. And there were over fifty such feather wipes in the full script. To what extent the budget department factored these fifty feather wipes into their eventual costs has not been documented,\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n34\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 34\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nbut when they finally delivered an estimated cost for the movie, it was $1,057,761. Welles’s contract allowed for a budget per film of $500,000. To put all of this in perspective, Sturges’s budget for The Great McGinty was $400,000. On the other hand, RKO made two films in 1939 that cost nearly $2,000,000 (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, at $1,826,000, a great success; and Gunga Din, at $1,915,000, an absolute catastrophe). Welles was plunged into one of his great depressions, partially alleviated by a letter dated December 7 from RKO’s Eddie Donahoe that detailed how an estimated budget of $910,740 for Swiss Family Robinson had been reduced to $596,000. Donahoe urged less despondency. “Whether we can take out that amount of money through a series of budget meetings and rewrite eliminations, is something we’ll just have to go in and try, but it certainly isn’t a hopeless task.” By then Welles had already trimmed twenty pages from his screenplay, delivering the “Revised Estimating Script” on November 30, two days after he had received RKO’s own shooting schedule. The shooting schedule ran to eighty-two days; but special effects work would have to be completed beforehand, and principal photography matched to it, so there would be a significant delay before filming could begin. Meanwhile, there remained a gaping hole in the cast, as Welles’s original choice for Elsa, Dita Parlo, was unable to leave Europe and he had failed to entice the newly arrived Ingrid Bergman to become her replacement. Welles was undoubtedly still hoping (and expecting) to salvage the film as he flew to New York to meet Schaefer on December 9, to iron out the way ahead. However, the Mercury actors had already been informed that they would be taken off salary at the end of the week, prior to a further meeting on the fourteenth to discuss ways of trimming the film’s budget. The deal he struck with Schaefer in New York was a typical Wellesian compromise: he would put Heart of Darkness on hold and would instead make a low-budget thriller for the studio, The Smiler with a Knife, for $400,000.

Welcome to Hollywood, Mr. Welles. The Hollywood Reporter correctly predicted at the time that “Heart of Darkness won’t ever be done.” Where the gossip rags were proven wrong was in their prediction that “the current Welles confab with Schaefer in New York may end the whole works.” They knew that the date when he was supposed to deliver his first film (January 1, 1940) was fast approaching, but Schaefer’s faith in Welles’s ability to deliver something startlingly original remained undimmed. For all its disconcerting aspects, the Heart of Darkness screenplay reaffirmed both an originality of thinking and a depth of understanding for the medium. Even in this rich period, how many directors working in Hollywood knew how to compact so much into each little scene, whether it be the rich use of sound, the dramatic use of light and shade, or an ineluctable instinct for the visually evocative? INT. PILOT HOUSE—NIGHT . . . The bamboo effect has stopped. . . . From the jungle comes a new sound, lower than the others, sustained and vibrant. With another giggle Carbs raises the bottle [of champagne] to his mouth, opens his mouth to blow [in imitation]. Then he freezes in that position, his mouth open, his eyes staring. [The] camera has focused on his face and now moves down very slightly to show a thin sliver of an arrow is through his neck. He drops the champagne bottle. Marlow hears it fall and watches him topple to the floor. [The] camera pans down to floor with the body. Marlow is still staring at Carbs’ body when the Steersman falls on top of it, an arrow in his chest. The Steersman is dead but his eyes are on Marlow.\n\nThis was cinematic enough for Francis Ford Coppola to adopt the nub of the idea for the parallel scene in Apocalypse Now, his own not-so-respectful adaptation of Conrad. Back in 1939, though, few of Welles’s doubters had seen the evidence of his first screenplay, or\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n36\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 36\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nknew how hard he had strived to learn the RKO ropes. Even those who knew of his ability to transform raw literary material into something genuinely arresting were less than gracious about his perceived failure and concocted their own explanation for the reasons why. John Houseman, temporarily estranged from Welles, believed that he had fallen foul of the fame game and wrote a letter to that effect to composer Virgil Thomson: This new fame has grown in inverse proportion to the success of our [sic] recent artistic endeavors. . . . It is an appetite that grows as it is fed: in a creative artist, it becomes a compensation and a substitute for creation. . . . That is the main reason why, for seven months now, a picture (under one of the most magnificent contracts ever granted an artist in Hollywood) has been “about to be made.”\n\nBut then, according to Houseman, there never was a script to Heart of Darkness, nor a shooting schedule, film tests, casting decisions, or budgetary restrictions. Welles himself, for better or worse, made no press pronouncement as to why the film remained stillborn, but simply kept moving ahead. Only many years later, in conversation with Barbara Leaming, did he suggest that it came down to the fundamental issue of control: “I wanted my kind of control. They didn’t understand that. There was no quarreling. It was just two different points of view, absolutely opposite each other. Mine was taken to be ignorance, and I read their position as, you know, established dumbheadedness.” Welles felt that he could only make a film of Heart of Darkness his way, his how. Only now did he realize that it would require a degree of commitment from the studio—logistical and financial— that it would not (or, perhaps more accurately, no longer could) make. The cinematography alone would have required substantial expertise and considerable resources, and it was not something Welles felt confident would be done right. This realization probably first dawned during those four days of test shoots. By the time he saw the budget, and had heard firsthand from Schaefer how desperate the\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 37\n\nD E F I N I T E LY N O T L O V E I N T H E T R O P I C S\n\n37\n\nstudio’s business situation had become—thanks to the loss of markets caused by Europe’s little fracas—he realized the game was up. Though the Hollywood press cruelly dubbed The Smiler with a Knife “Mr. Welles’s latest forthcoming picture,” it was never conceived as anything but a stopgap measure. It was certainly never going to be the movie with which he intended to make his Hollywood debut. Heart of Darkness might have to wait until he had proved himself, but prove himself he would. Schaefer was, meanwhile, hard at work shoring up his own position in the organization, after the departure of Pandro Berman at the beginning of December. The new chain of executive command he now constructed was designed to leave him firmly at the helm, with his own assistant, J. J. Nolan, promoted to vice president in charge of the studio and a former independent producer and agent, Harry E. Edington, placed in charge of high-budget films. Both were entirely beholden to Schaefer for these heady new powers and were expected to toe the line accordingly. Now all that Schaefer required was for his independent production units to begin to generate results, and in particular for the wunderkind from Wisconsin to prove all his carping critics spectacularly wrong.\n\n01 (001-038) chapter 01\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:39 PM\n\nPage 38\n\n02 (039-074) chapter 02\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:41 PM\n\nPage 39\n\n2 THE WELLESIAN MOSAIC\n\n02 (039-074) chapter 02\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:41 PM\n\nPage 40\n\n[Citizen Kane] We were just ready to shoot [my screen test] when there appeared suddenly six men in long overcoats and felt hats. I thought, my goodness, these are gangsters who have come to stop the film. [But] when they came closer, we realized they were RKO brass from New York. After congratulating Orson on beginning the film, they called in a dump truck, which deposited a ton of rank flowers on the floor. They explained . . . they were sorry about the condition of the flowers, but they had been fresh months ago when [Heart of Darkness] had first been announced. Everybody laughed at the joke and shook hands. But they didn’t leave. Instead, they just folded their hands and said, “OK, genius, show us. Start filming. Be a genius.” —Ruth Warrick [a.k.a. Emily Kane]\n\nH\n\neart of Darkness had provided Welles with an invaluable education in the ways of the West. Without that experience, Citizen Kane would have been a very different picture. But when one was lampooned as a “would-be genius,” such a highly publicized apprenticeship merely compounded the expectations of others, whether of failure or success, dissipation or vindication. So when, in January 1940, Welles found himself back at something resembling square one, he knew that he had only one option. As Francois Truffaut put it twenty years later, “He was forced to make not a film which permitted him to get started in the industry, but the film, the one which sums up and prefigures all the others.” Not that Welles lacked ideas. He always had ideas, ways of deconstructing set patterns of presentation to render them anew. The one he had now, according to Mercury assistant Richard Baer, first came up “in a conversation with Jack Houseman at the 21 Club in New York.” Baer, who signed a legal deposition to this effect,\n\n02 (039-074) chapter 02\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:41 PM\n\nPage 41\n\nTHE WELLESIAN MOSAIC\n\n41\n\nwrote at the time of the film’s release that “the idea of Citizen Kane was the original conception of Orson Welles, who in the early part of the year 1940 first discussed the idea [with John Houseman] and elaborated upon the same. The conception of the picture evidently appealed to Houseman, who suggested that both he and Welles leave for Los Angeles and discuss the idea with [scriptwriter] Herman Mankiewicz.” Baer’s deposition is the only contemporary document we have as to the genesis of the film and is the sworn testimony of a firsthand witness without any obvious motive for perjuring himself. Sadly, he does not elaborate on the idea Welles espoused to Houseman, though it seems unlikely that the word “Hearst” had yet arisen in parentheses. Rather, it would appear that Welles’s conceit was the more amorphous one he first highlighted in a statement made to the press in January 1941, with Citizen Kane barely completed: I wished to make a motion picture which was not a narrative of action so much as an examination of character. For this, I desired a man of many sides and many aspects. It was my idea to show that six or more people could have as many widely divergent opinions concerning the nature of a single personality.\n\nWhenever he subsequently expounded on the source of Kane’s conceit, Welles consistently insisted that “we began on this idea of seeing it from various points of view.” In a lecture given to the New York University Film School in October 1942, he would actually suggest, “I got the idea from the Bible; from the appearances of witnesses who came to testify to a man’s character. [So] I don’t know what is new about that.” Before the film’s premiere, he had suggested, that “the point of the picture is not so much the solution to the problem as its presentation.” Certainly the presentation, rather than its solution, was the one original aspect of a recent novel that Welles was “very fond of,” I Am Jonathan Scrivener by Claude Houghton, first published in the United States in 1939. According to Welles’s musical director,\n\n02 (039-074) chapter 02\n\n42\n\n11/2/04\n\n5:41 PM\n\nPage 42\n\nACT ONE: FAITH\n\nBernard Herrmann, “Orson was [certainly] influenced by . . . [this book]. All its characters talk about a man they know. In the last sentence, the doorbell rings and the butler announces Mr. Jonathan Scrivener.
