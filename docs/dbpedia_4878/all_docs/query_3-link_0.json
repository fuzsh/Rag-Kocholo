        "text": "American film distributor\n\nFirst Look Studios, Inc. was an American independent film and home video distributor based in Los Angeles, California. The company specialized in the acquisition and direct distribution of, and worldwide license and sale of distribution rights to, independently produced feature films and television series.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOverseas Filmgroup\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1980, Robert and Ellen Little founded Overseas Filmgroup as a film sales company for foreign markets. Overseas Filmgroup expanded towards film financing to give the company greater control over its output. From the company's foundation, it competed with fellow, also-defunct film producers J&M Film Sales (later J&M Entertainment), Manson International and Producers Sales Organization as the most successful company with global film sales.\n\nOverseas Filmgroup decided to pay $3 million in order to set up operations for different areas worldwide such as Spain, Arizona, Texas, Taiwan, Italy, southern California and Colorado in the mid-1980s, and by 1986, the company became active, setting up a number of domestic theatrical, home video and television syndication sales with New World Pictures and other distributors.[1]\n\nIn 1987, while other sales companies were gaining production outfits, the Littles stated that they would avoid production, so Overseas Filmgroup had set up a company policy stating that they would acquire new films via distribution advances, and the three new movies, namely those directed by Roland Emmerich, will be offered to various Mifed buyers.[2] The company was the original international home video distributor for the show Tales from the Darkside, until it was sold off to Lorimar-Telepictures in late November 1987 after Lorimar International president Jeff Schlesinger saw all episodes of the show that was well-suited and combined to become eight ninety-minute episodes from the show.[3]\n\nFilms ranged from genre titles such as Blue Tiger (starring Virginia Madsen) and No Way Back (starring New Zealand actor Russell Crowe) to art house films, including Antonia's Line, Mrs. Dalloway, The Secret of Roan Inish, Waking Ned Devine, and Titus.[4] In 1993, the company expanded towards North American distribution through its First Look Pictures subsidiary.[5]\n\nIn October 1996, Entertainment/Media Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company incorporated in the state of Delaware in December 1993 that had consummated its initial public offering in February 1995, acquired Overseas Filmgroup, and the company went public.[6] In 2000. EUE/Screen Gems acquired a minority interest in the company.\n\nFirst Look Studios\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2001, as part of a restructuring and to reflect the company's expansion into domestic film and home video distribution, Internet content development and television commercial production, Overseas Filmgroup was renamed First Look Media (not to be confused with the news organization of the same name).[7] The Overseas Filmgroup name remained as the international distribution division of First Look Media. In 2003, founders Robert and Ellen Little left First Look, and Overseas Filmgroup was renamed First Look International.[8][4]\n\nOn July 29, 2005, the company merged with Canadian businessman Henry Winterstern's Capital Entertainment, and in September, the company's name was changed to First Look Studios. Winterstern became CEO of First Look and shared the role as chairman with EUE/Screen Gems' Chris Cooney.[9] In November 2005, First Look acquired DEJ Productions from Blockbuster.[10]\n\nIn March 2006, First Look acquired Ventura Distribution, a Californian home video distribution company,[11] including its subsidiary UrbanWorks Entertainment, and the domestic television syndication rights to fifty six films from Pinnacle Entertainment.[12] In 2006, the company launched a television syndication division known as First Look Television.[13] By 2006, First Look's film library consisted of 700 films, and continued to add more with the financing of in house productions.[14]\n\nIn March 2007, Henry Winterstern resigned from the company but stayed on as an adviser.[15] The same month, Nu Image acquired a 52% stake in First Look. The deal was brokered by William Morris Independent. Following the acquisition, Nu Image and its production/distribution arm Millennium Films were given an outlet for home video and theatrical distribution[16]\n\nIn January 2008, First Look Studios started releasing titles on Blu-Ray.\n\nIn November 2010, First Look Studios filed for bankruptcy through an assignment for the benefit of the studio's senior secured creditors. Millennium Entertainment, a new sister company formed by Nu Image, acquired most of First Look's assets and inherited many of the former key management and staff.[17]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\n10 Items or Less (released theatrically by ThinkFilm)\n\nAll About You\n\nAmerican Adobo\n\nAn American Crime\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters (the only animated film by the company)\n\nAs Good as Dead\n\nAugust\n\nBack in the Day\n\nBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\n\nThe Breed\n\nA Brother's Kiss\n\nChopper\n\nChrystal\n\nCool Dog\n\nThe Contract\n\nDanika\n\nDay of the Dead\n\nDay Zero\n\nDedication (co distribution with The Weinstein Company)\n\nEat Your Heart Out\n\nErnest Goes to Africa (re released by Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment)\n\nErnest in the Army (re released by Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment)\n\nEvelyn (co-distribution with United Artists)\n\nFinding Rin Tin Tin\n\nFirecracker\n\nFlu Birds\n\nForty Shades of Blue\n\nFour Sheets to the Wind\n\nFrank\n\nFreeze Frame\n\nA Gentleman's Game\n\nGlass Trap\n\nGod's Gift\n\nA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\n\nHydra\n\nImmortal (United States distributor)\n\nIn a Dark Place\n\nInfinity\n\nJourney to the End of the Night\n\nKill Switch\n\nKing of California\n\nKing of the Avenue\n\nLabor Pains\n\nLeaves of Grass\n\nLeo\n\nA Little Trip to Heaven\n\nA Map of the World\n\nMarcello Mastroianni: I Remember\n\nMayor of the Sunset Strip\n\nMeet Bill\n\nMidgets vs. Mascots\n\nMinotaur (co distribution with Lionsgate)\n\nMiranda\n\nMonster (co distribution with Newmarket Films, Media 8 Entertainment and DEJ Productions)\n\nMrs Dalloway\n\nMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?\n\nNature Unleashed: Tornado\n\nParis, je t'aime\n\nParty Girl\n\nThe Prophecy (co distribution with Dimension Films)\n\nThe Pumpkin Karver\n\nRelative Strangers\n\nThe Secret of Roan Inish\n\nSex and Breakfast\n\nSilence Becomes You\n\nSmiley Face\n\nStiletto\n\nSukiyaki Western Django\n\nTara Road\n\nTarget of Opportunity\n\nThe Thing Below\n\nThick as Thieves\n\nThis Is The Sea\n\nTrading Mom (co distribution with Trimark Pictures)\n\nTranssiberian\n\nTriangle\n\nThe Volcano Disaster (also called Volcano: Nature Unleashed)\n\nWar, Inc.\n\nDistributed lines\n\n[edit]\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\n\nVideo Asia\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
