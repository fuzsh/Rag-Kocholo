        "text": "If a FAST platform asks FAST rights from you for a rev share, look to see if it also offers its viewers fast forward and rewind capabilities, as that is more properly an AVOD right (on demand) and indies, where possible, should strive to be paid for both rights, from the viewpoint of monetization/dealmaking, instead of lumping them together.\n\nSVOD with Ad-supported tiers:\n\nSome services, such as Netflix, Disney+, and now Sky Showtime, offer SVOD at various priced tiers: one ad-free subscription, and then other cheaper subscriptions with ads.\n\nThis is not to be confused with regular AVOD rights or windows (like YouTube) where viewers watch free and on-demand without any subscription, while filmmakers share in ad revenues.\n\nIndies should be alert when dealmaking that they are still within an SVOD window/right. Watch out for holdbacks against AVOD/FAST, if applicable.\n\n2) PLATFORM changes – and other new buyers\n\nA) TIER 1 TYPES\n\nAll are increasingly focused (in EU markets) on content produced/co-produced originally from EU, due to quotas (formal and informal), and regulatory, political, and cultural pressures. This means they have relatively less bandwidth operationally in 2024 for volumes of pure U.S. indie material, after factoring in their inventory and pipeline of MPA studio output deals, deals with local distributors, and local EU indies; however, there is still some room.\n\nNETFLIX\n\nAdded linear version experiments (e.g. in France) but has not yet added FAST.\n\nAdded an ad-supported tier (not AVOD) in some regions and cracked down on password sharing to enhance revenues.\n\nInitially stepped up indie feature film buying and Netflix Originals in 2021 (but reduced in 2023, along with sad layoffs in the higher end art/indie feature film and docs staffing)\n\nStarted limited theatrical distribution, finally open to occasional theatrical prior window (limited and selective) but is still mainly an SVOD first-run service.\n\nStepped up licensing its own Netflix Originals to third-party competitors/networks. (Some other streamers (MAX, Viaplay) have followed this move)\n\nMoved into other genres/formats (gaming, interactive experimentation), then more steadily moved into mainstream reality, true crime, and an increased emphasis on foreign (non-US) indie series and film to support its expansion abroad.\n\nDiminished Africa content focus (after initial push) to concentrate more on EU.\n\nAs of 2023-4, not always a one-stop-shop for global-style big $ license deals, increasingly buying for specific (e.g. English Language) regions. This can be a double-edged sword, and as per the prior blog, one must balance the desire for ease/single deal with monetization, audience, marketing, data etc. and producer goals (impact? revenues? future pipeline?).\n\nAlso, a deal that is US-only Netflix can limit the attractiveness for buyers from other competing platforms (in some cases) where they want more key regions, while tier 2/3 players can consider it an asset.\n\nAMAZON PRIME / FREEVEE\n\nIMDB.tv renamed its AVOD service “Freevee”, in U.S. and UK, but is not yet across EU.\n\nLicensing to Freevee still allows multiple other AVOD licenses, also abroad, however ensure the SVOD route has been canvassed first, to not accidentally cut out the prior window for Prime or other competing SVODs (subject to a compelling deal as in some cases as in the prior blog AVOD can be a bigger revenue generator than small SVODs. Again, depends on goals of filmmaker).\n\nPrime Video Direct dropped self-upload capability for docs and shorts, except for TVOD/EST\n\nStill buying indie films selectively, with room for a limited theatrical window\n\nIncreased carriage of other SVOD’s (including niche thematics) on its platform via add-ons internationally\n\nThis means a deal an indie may have done earlier with a specific SVOD (for example with Docubay), can end up on Amazon Prime, where it is carried to wider audiences. This can create more reach, but not necessarily more money, depending on the type of deal struck (consider implications if the deal is rev share vs. flat fee, or with “bump-ups,” for example).\n\nHBOMAX / WBD / Discovery+ / MAX\n\nWildly expanded then contracted in the past few years, via mergers (WarnerBrosDiscovery), rebrands, and various re-orgs, including the bloodbath in the indie doc/feature buying and funding sector, both in the U.S. and EU.\n\nJust launched MAX domestically (wiping out the beloved HBO brand) and rolling out to more regions in EU and international markets through summer 2024-26.\n\nBuying indie films and/or docs can happen out of U.S. HQ and sometimes via separate buyers still in the international regions (CEE, Benelux, Nordic). It’s not a fully consolidated picture yet, don’t give up, particularly if your theme translates culturally abroad.\n\nDiscovery+ Service (different programming) continues, replacing d-play as OTT SVOD in UK/IE, Germany, Austria, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Netherlands, Nordics, India, Spain\n\nDisney+\n\nDISNEY+ expanded wider within Americas, EMEA, Indo-Pacific regions but still no separate Hulu brand site in Europe. Programming is subsumed selectively within the broader Disney+ umbrella and STAR sites.\n\nB) TIER 2 TYPES\n\nVIAPLAY\n\nViaplay had been at its high-point in recent years; very attractive to indies (including U.S. indies) for buying and funding, as it was rolling out and spreading in regions beyond Nordic and Benelux, to CEE (Central and Eastern Europe, GAS, UK, and N. America. It was also heavily funding or coproducing 80+ Viaplay Originals per year and buying (mainly series but some English/American and local indie films and high profile docs)\n\nHowever, last year Viaplay widely contracted; shutting down expansion, closing most regions, shutting down projects in development/production stages, staff reorgs, and overall changing focus.\n\nNOTE: Today, it still remains a Tier 2 competitor in Nordic, (buying and funding mainly locally) and a complementary service in Benelux (local and sports emphasis).\n\nBut in North America, Viaplay has become more of a Tier 3 thematic/niche (“Best of Nordics”) SVOD called Viaplay Select, and is carried as an add-on, such as via Amazon.\n\nThis means U.S. indies selling film/docs should approach Nordic HQ, rather than the U.S./Canada service.\n\nSKY SHOWTIME\n\nThis Paramount/Comcast JV launched in 22+ EU regions (those that are not UK, Italy, or Germany, so as not to compete with sister company SKY).\n\nInitially began with its own well-stocked catalogs from JV partners, (NBCU, Peacock, Paramount, Showtime, etc., so it was not buying from indies\n\nMore recently started acquiring series and films from select higher-end indies, albeit either more commercial in nature or increasingly from EU sources (however, still buying very limited docs), sometimes buying for all regions, other times purely local flavor.\n\nCurrent emphasis is EU titles (Originals and acquisitions) for EU, but high-profile English buying can selectively come via UK office.\n\nIn April 2024, just began an ad supported SVOD tier as well.\n\nCANAL+ / Canal+ International / Canal+ Group\n\nAfter initial contractions a few years ago (including their shut down of SVOD and other VOD operations in favor of their core Pay-TV business channels), fast forward to 2024, they’ve since wildly expanded:\n\nAs a Group, they currently reach 50+ countries in Africa, France, Benelux, (including in 2024 a dedicated local Canal+ in Holland), CEE, Asia Pacific, Caribbean, Indian Ocean. These channels/services are alongside their other corporately owned channels, such as Film1 in Netherlands and related basic SPI channels (FilmBox and FilmBox Arthouse).\n\nThey started a new dedicated Canal+ Docs channel, rolled out their Canal+ Series OTT and other thematics (C+ Horreur) and also have a “StudioCanal Presents” art house SVOD via their StudioCanal arm.\n\nRecent corporate acquisitions which affect your sales include:\n\nTakeover/merger of Orange Telecom’s OCS (Orange Cinema Series) SVOD, which was formerly a separate buyer and funder for mainstream and indie film, and now is subsumed operationally within Canal+ Group.\n\nThus, buying of films/series and docs will go via Canal+ group buyers and/or SPI buyers in CEE.\n\nApril 2024, corporate buyout underway with Multichoice Africa (affecting, among others, indie film channel buyers and programming from M-Net Movies and Showmax channels and SVOD’s).\n\nBuyers are still in place in Multichoice group channels but may be impacted by the Canal+ broader group (more on this below).\n\nDutch Filmworks (local distributor in Benelux and sales agent) is now in a merged cooperation/integration with Studio Canal.\n\nSPI International (thematic pay and basic channels like Film1, FilmBox, FilmBox Arthouse, Docustream, Filmstream etc. as per the last blogs)\n\nVodafone/Ziggo’s “MOVIES and SERIES” SVOD\n\nSadly, Ziggo is no longer buying individually from international/US indies. Their SVOD is now superseded by carriage of Sky Showtime streamer, as of 2024, and other carriage deals like Viaplay etc. (so indies lost another Tier 2 competitor buyer).\n\nOne would now go to Sky Showtime buyers (UK, NL (Netherlands), or other region-specific) in order to be seen on VodafoneZiggo, along with the potential 20+ other regions.\n\nMNET / Showmax / Multichoice Group\n\nSince 2023 various buyers from MNET South Africa (mainstream pay/SVOD) and Showmax (African themed OTT service) left the Group, some for Tier 1 streamers.\n\nMNET/Showmax also announced a cooperation with Sky/NBCU/Comcast groups re a joint streaming approach to production and service offerings in Africa.\n\nNow, due to April 2024 merger with Canal+ International, buying is being consolidated further (and at time of writing, indie one-off buying appears frozen for the moment).\n\nTelefonica’s MOVISTAR+\n\nSpain, Portugal Pay-TV, TVOD, and SVOD buyer and Originals funder, usually mainstream/commercial and local fare, but appetite for Spanish/Portuguese language indie content as well.\n\nOccasionally they still buy from indie sources including U.S. (such as a non-current SXSW Audience Award winning feature drama)\n\n4 / Channel 4\n\nChannel 4 rebranded its All4/4oD in UK, consolidating digital and traditional all into one place; “4.” Still tbuying and sometimes funding indie film and docs on a flat-fee basis generally but more heavily still emphasizing series and UK creators, with some exceptions.\n\nAnd Channel 4’s AVOD/SVOD for foreign (non-UK) series, Walter Presents, expanded to more regions (including as Walter’s Choice in U.S.). Walter Presents is only buying, not funding.\n\nFoxtel Australia\n\nAdded BINGE SVOD and FOXTEL DOCOS channels (100% docs). Usually flat fee deals.\n\nC) TIER 3 TYPES – Changes and new buyers\n\nAlthough some of the earlier indie film and doc services profiled in my last blog sadly fell away, others have stabilized, morphed, and matured, and new services have also launched. CAVEATS: This list and the DDG is NOT exhaustive, but an illustrative snapshot at this time. To help bring it down to earth, I’ve focused only on services that have done a deal with a niche indie/doc filmmaker from the U.S. in the recent past.\n\nAs before, most deals are non-exclusive, which allows you to ripple the film to genre competitors as well. For example, if dealing with a horror site such as Shudder, one can explore the other various competitors in horror; if dealing in art house, e.g. MUBI or Filmin, one can explore deals with 10 others, and similarly with documentary and niche/micro niche sites.\n\nIn terms of business models, all of the below are still SVOD buyers, not funders (unless specified).\n\nI first list some key indie movie sites which also buy different formats and genres (e.g. docs, shorts). I then list some niche, genre specific sites (e.g. docs only, horror only, shorts only); refer to the DDG for more.\n\nC) Stepping Back: Considerations and Takeaways\n\nI look forward to seeing more of your films and docs here and in other parts of the world!\n\n—Wendy Bernfeld, Rights Stuff • @wbernfeld\n\nDavid Averbach May 15th, 2024"
