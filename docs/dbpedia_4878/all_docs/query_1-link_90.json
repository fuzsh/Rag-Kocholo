        "text": "The past year wasn’t the best for everyone in the entertainment industry. But Eddie Murphy is an exception to that rule. His comedy, Coming 2 America, was the most-watched movie on Amazon Prime Video in March 2021. Murphy just signed an additional deal with Amazon Studios to star in three more films. Here’s what we know.\n\nEddie Murphy starred in the hugely successful ‘Coming 2 America’\n\nMurphy starred in the comedic sequel to 1988’s Coming to America, and it was a big hit for Amazon. According to Deadline, Amazon Studios purchased the movie from Paramount during the coronavirus (COVID-19 pandemic) in October 2020.\n\nAt $125 million, the movie was the most viewed during its opening weekend between March 5-7, 2021. However, the streamer never provided specific details.\n\nComing 2 America has Prince Akeem (Murphy), and Lisa McDowell (Shari Headley) happily married with three grown daughters. They rule over Zamunda, an African kingdom. But trouble brews with nearby kingdom Nexdoria. Consequently, Akeem must take Semmi (Arsenio Hall) back to Queens, New York, to find the son he never knew he had.\n\nThe movie packs serious with star power. Trevor Noah, Morgan Freeman, Gladys Knight, John Legend, Colin Jost, Tracy Morgan, Garcelle Beauvais, Leslie Jones, Wesley Snipes, James Earl Jones, and even En Vogue appear in cameos and supporting roles.\n\nBut most importantly, Murphy re-appearing in the beloved role of Akeem is the highlight of the fresh new take on the 1988 favorite.\n\nEddie Murphy will star in three new movies for Amazon Studios\n\nMurphy’s deal includes starring in three as-yet unplanned films for Amazon Studios, with a ‘first look’ clause. Per Deadline, he will also be involved in developing original movie projects for Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Studios, with the possibility of starring in them, as well.\n\nThe three-picture deal illustrates how powerful streaming services have become. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, many movies have been released straight to streaming services. Some, like Black Widow (Disney Plus), Malignant (HBO Max) and Dwayne Johnson’s Jungle Cruise (Disney Plus) went to streaming platforms alongside a theatrical release.\n\nThe head of Amazon Studios called Eddie Murphy a ‘legend’\n\nIn a statement about the new deal, Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke said the Beverly Hills Cop star is a “legend.”\n\n“Eddie is a legend both in front of and behind the camera,” said Salke in the official statement. “With undeniable comedic and dramatic genius, he consistently delivers entertaining, original stories and characters to audiences around the world. We could not be more excited to help carry on the tradition and to officially welcome Eddie into the Amazon family.”\n\nMurphy is indeed a 1980s comedy icon. The actor starred in a string of popular and critically acclaimed comedies during that decade and beyond. He is well-known for lead roles in Trading Places (1983), Boomerang (1992), Daddy Day Care (2003), and Bowfinger (1999.)\n\nHe’s also appeared in kid-friendly fare like Shrek (2001), Mulan (1998), and Disney’s ride-based movie The Haunted Mansion (2003).\n\nMurphy is currently thriving on sequels. Deadline reports that he will next star as detective Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop 4 for Netflix."
