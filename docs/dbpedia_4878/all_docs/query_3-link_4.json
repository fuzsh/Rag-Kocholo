Get specific with the distribution person about which theaters s/he can get for your film. You should trust their experience and expertise, but tell the distributor about other films your film reminds you of and specific elements from other films’ release campaigns that you would like them to emulate. You have been living with the project for a lot longer than they have and they should appreciate your input and feedback. Sometimes it’s better to work with a smaller distributor who will give your film the proper TLC.\n\nQuick Stats\n\nWho handles acquisitions:\n\nSteve Break\n\nNumber of films released theatrically each year:\n\n5-10\n\nDistribution platforms other than theatrical:\n\nAll platforms – DVD, Blu-ray, TV, all forms of VOD and Digital\n\nNumber of films released exclusively via VOD/DVD or “alternative” means of release:\n\n20-25 annually\n\nNumber of films acquired at festivals:\n\n25%\n\nFestivals where distributor has acquired films in the last two years:\n\nToronto, Sundance, Cannes, AFM/AFI"
