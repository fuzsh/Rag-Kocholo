        "text": "Alright, with grrrrreat reluctance I'm beginning a new thread with my investigation notes about video-on-demand.\n\nI wanted to just attach it to the other thread as a minor tangent, but this just keeps getting hairier and hairier demanding it's own thread. Sorry\n\nAlthough this first post is a C&P regurgitation of the last info from another thread subsequent posts will highlight boiled down items of interest.\n\n(IOW, there's a big difference between writing copy to fill collumn inches and writing to slam home crude education - which is my preferred approach: \"Ten words or less. What?!\"\n\nSubsequent posts will examine individual articles begining with that FilmThreat Going Bionic series.\n\nHave fun.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\nAnother interesting VOD article:\n\nDated - Fall 2009 http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/fall2009/industry-beat.php\n\nBy all accounts, the most successful VOD films fall into one of a few categories, horror-thrillers (Dark Mirror, Magnolia's Surveillance or The Mutant Chronicles), sexy stuff (like some of IFC's racy French fare) or star-studded comedies (IFC's I Hate Valentine's Day, starring the leads from My Big Fat Greek Wedding).\n\n\"The films working on cable VOD are going to be the films that people want to watch with other people, things that are provocative, either from a violence or stylish sense, or a titillating standpoint,\"\n\nIt appears that if you can skip the dubious expense of a questionable theatrical release, the title and description are intriguing enough, that VOD only distribution may be fairly viable.\n\nSurprisingly some filmmakers are ending up in better fiscal shape by bypassing the theatrical route. Joe Swanberg says the VOD performance for his latest film, Alexander the Last, was similar to his previous Hannah Takes the Stairs. Both were released on IFC with grosses around $250,000. But Alexander may turn out to be significantly more profitable because the higher expenses associated with Hannah's theatrical release ate up all of its VOD proceeds.\n\nAnd another \"more\" current article:\n\nDated - Jun 29, 2010 http://www.filmthreat.com/features/22975/\n\nFinding a way to get your film noticed can be as hard, or harder, than finding the money to make your film in the first place. Of course having certain elements like a notable cast and a “bionic” genre (i.e. action, sci-fi and thriller) will certainly help. But, you should have a clear idea about who your audience is and how you can exploit your product to them through the correct V.O.D. platform.\n\n2) People under the age of 25 buy most of the content sold to cell phones.\n\nSince most contracts with V.O.D. suppliers are non-exclusive, your distributor should exploit your film to multiple suppliers. Let me just clarify that point: Your contract with your distributor is always exclusive, but their contract with V.O.D. suppliers is usually non-exclusive. This means you can have your film available to multiple V.O.D. suppliers if it makes sense to do so.\n\nCool. There's a series: http://www.filmthreat.com/page/7/?s=\"going+bionic\"\n\nAnother informative \"definitions of VOD\" article:\n\nDated - Aug 25, 2011 http://www.sellingyourfilm.com/blog/tag/film-distribution-contracts/\n\nGood Lord.\n\nThe amount of data to learn on this subject is... deep enough to drown in.\n\nLooks like a chock-load of undated FREE RESOURCES in that first left column block: http://www.filmspecific.com/public/main.cfm\n\nI think this is enough to keep me busy for a week.\n\n(BTW, did I ever tell you guys that the reason I got interested in filmmaking is because I DON'T like reading anymore, especially when a book takes six or more hours to convey what a film can do in under two hours? And what am I doing a sh!t load of now? Yuk yuk yuk. Life is funny).\n\nI noticed that many of these film got god-awful ratings on IMDb (yes, I know they can be skewed).\n\nYup, and at some point I'd like to get my hands on a substantial amount of comprehensive (rather than anecdotal) \"distribution\" deal figures.\n\nMy business sense tells me that most of the content providers (AKA filmmaker/producers) probably don't get paid a dime up front, maybe some get token checks, and all the marketing & promotion responsibilty remains with the content providers.\n\n\"Film submissions should include a DVD screener along with a press kit and/or any other materials and should be sent to our corporate office at the address below.\"​\n\nThe \"distributor\" largely just provides a warehousing platform and film bundle deals.\n\nI don't think many of these lo/no budget content providers are getting ten, twenty, fifty-thousand dollar checks to distribute these films.\n\n\"Distribution\" isn't the end-all-be-all that it may sound like, much like \"being published\" sounds much better than it may actually be considering the prevalence of print on demand self publishing these days.\n\nAnother number I look at with those IMDB ratings is the number of users.\n\nA one or two year old film with less than a dozen user vote ratings doesn't look all that great to me.\n\nHorrible film. Large number of user votes. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1530509/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4\n\nRatings: 4.0/10 from 15,192 users\n\nhttp://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=humancentipede2.htm​\n\nWhy do all of these (may I call them for what they probably likely are?) cr@p films (and you know I've done my homework to defend that opinion based on the limited information provided) have so few user votings and reviews?\n\nFor really?\n\nMost of them have only a few dozen user votes, good or bad. Just as many have less than a dozen votes as those that have only a few hundred votes.\n\nSad.\n\nSad, sad, sad.\n\nHowever, it does go to show that, all things being equal, a distributor like Maxim Media may very well pick up a film that the content providers have no clue how to market & promote.\n\nFurthermore, I'm of the opinion that I already know that M&P/P&A burden falls on me, and that if I can't bring my film to the attention of a \"significant\" audience then I probably shouldn't have spent any \"significant\" time writing/directing/producing it.\n\nI haven't drunk the \"art for art's sake\" kool aid. LOL!\n\nAlso from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365789/companycredits?ref_=tt_dt_co :\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/company/co0285703/?ref_=ttco_co_3\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoDigital\n\nLooking at the history of this company I think this is the model that many \"distributors\" follow: start off with dirt cheap cr@p films until they can afford to start distributing films of greater production value and business worth.\n\nLionsgate and Magnet/Magnolia used to be associated with cr@p films, but not anymore.\n\nVery nice: http://www.godigitalvod.com/\n\nThe Motivation (2013) ...
