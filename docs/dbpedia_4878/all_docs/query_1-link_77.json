        "text": "MinaLima have issued a statement letting Harry Potter fans know that they will not be releasing any further illustrated Harry Potter books because they have not been commissioned to do so.\n\nThe statement, which is signed off by founders Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima, and the MinaLima team, was released on MinaLima’s social media accounts, stating that many fans have been asking when the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will be released.\n\nAt the time of writing, this post on Instagram has over 7,000 comments, one of which is from MinaLima, thanking their followers for the comments and support.\n\nThank you for all your comments; we value your support and share your disappointment.\n\nWe have always been open about being commissioned by Scholastic to illustrate one book at a time. This was not our desired outcome.\n\nThis magical community is very important to us so we wanted to let you know as soon as we could. We know you will appreciate that decisions for big creative projects can take a long time.\n\nWe remain immensely proud of the MinaLima editions of the first three Harry Potter books and hope you, too, will continue to treasure them. We hope you will keep enjoying our distinct style of graphic design in our ever-growing MinaLima Classics edition.\n\nScholastic released the following statement regarding the change in illustrators:\n\nScholastic is pleased to confirm that we will continue to publish illustrated, interactive editions of the Harry Potter books, passing the baton to a new illustrator for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. We thank MinaLima for their extraordinary work on the first three books in the series. More details and exciting news will be announced in due course.\n\nWhat is now MinaLima’s final illustrated Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, was released in October 2023.\n\nWe don’t know what this means for the rest of the illustrated Harry Potter book series – according to the supposed Scholastic statement, details surrounding the next steps for the illustrated series will be announced “in due course.”\n\nWe will keep you updated with any further developments and news."
