        "text": "From staff reports\n\nQuicksand, a feature film that Nick and Chris Loud of The Boardman Review helped produce, debuts in northern Michigan with a showing on Thursday, Sept. 7, at the City Opera House in Traverse City and a Sept. 18 date at the Garden Theatre in Frankfort. The Loud brothers’ family lives in Northport, and part of the movie was filmed in Leelanau County. Visit the Quicksand website for more showings across the state.\n\nAfter a successful year-long film festival run, Quicksand has received a distribution deal, and will be releasing to VOD platforms on Sept. 19. You can pre-order the movie on Apple TV by following a link on our website.\n\nQuicksand is an action-comedy about best friends Ray (Tanner Presswood) and Paul (Simon Elias) who embark on a treacherous road trip after losing their friend’s wedding ring just days before the ceremony. Their quest to retrieve the ring accelerates into a loud exploration of life, love, and how to not die. The film features many recognizable locations around Traverse City, Leelanau, and the Upper Peninsula."
