        "text": "History\n\nIn 1980, Robert and Ellen Little founded Overseas Filmgroup as a film sales company for foreign markets. Overseas Filmgroup expanded towards film financing to give the company greater control over its output. Films ranged from genre titles such as Blue Tiger (starring Virginia Madsen) and No Way Back (starring Russell Crowe) to art-house films including Antonia's Line, Mrs. Dalloway, The Secret of Roan Inish, Waking Ned Devine, and Titus. In 1993, the company expanded towards North American distribution through its First Look Pictures subsidiary.\n\nIn 1998, Overseas Filmgroup went public. Two years later, EUE/Screen Gems acquired a minority interest in the company. In January 2001, as part of a restructuring, Overseas Filmgroup and First Look Pictures became subsidiaries of First Look Media. Overseas Filmgroup was eventually renamed First Look International. Robert and Ellen Little left First Look in 2003.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, after a merger with Canadian businessman Henry Winterstern's Capital Entertainment, the combined company became First Look Studios. Winterstern became CEO of First Look and shared the role as Chairman with EUE/Screen Gems' Chris Cooney. That year, First Look acquired DEJ Productions from Blockbuster. In 2006, First Look acquired Ventura Distribution, a home video distribution company, and acquired the domestic TV syndication rights to 56 films from Pinnacle Entertainment. By 2006, First Look had a 700-film library to its name, and continued to add more with the financing of in-house productions.\n\nHenry Winterstern resigned from First Look in 2007. That March, Nu Image acquired controlling interest in First Look. In 2010, Millennium Entertainment acquired First Look's assets.\n\nFilms\n\nAll About You\n\nAmerican Adobo\n\nAn American Crime\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters (the only animated film by the company)\n\nBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\n\nThe Breed\n\nDay of the Dead\n\nDay Zero\n\nDedication\n\nErnest Goes to Africa (re-released by Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment)\n\nErnest in the Army (re-released by Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment)\n\nFirecracker\n\nFlu Birds\n\nFour Sheets to the Wind\n\nFrank\n\nA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\n\nHydra\n\nImmortal (United States distributor)\n\nIn a Dark Place\n\nInfinity\n\nLeaves of Grass\n\nA Little Trip to Heaven\n\nMayor of the Sunset Strip\n\nMeet Bill\n\nMrs Dalloway\n\nMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?\n\nParis, je t'aime\n\nParty Girl\n\nThe Pumpkin Karver\n\nSmiley Face\n\nStiletto\n\nSukiyaki Western Django\n\nTranssiberian\n\nThe Volcano Disaster (also called Volcano: Nature Unleashed)\n\nWar, Inc.\n\nTV series\n\nBaywatch\n\nThe Cosby Show\n\nA Different World\n\nUnsolved Mysteries\n\nDistributed lines\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\n\nVideo Asia"
