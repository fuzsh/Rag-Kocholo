        "text": "I feel I'm one of the few people that are okay with Rewind and Eject being translucent, but if they redid Twincast with the double cassette chest he should have, I would be in probably\n\nThey need to start releasing cassette two-packs again. Sell them at the Deluxe pricepoint for better budget on paint and accessories.\n\nRewind & Eject (people with the SS86 version getting a 2nd Eject is a better option than making people with Kingdom have to buy a whole Voyager for a little tape)\n\nLaserbeak & Ravage (if they decided to make new molds for these guys)\n\nSundor & Flip-Sides\n\nOverkill & Slugfest\n\nStripes & Nightstalker\n\nGarboil & Howlback\n\nGrandslam & Raindance\n\nBeastbox & Squawktalk\n\nBlackcat & Rosanna\n\nEnemy & Glit\n\nDile & Zaur\n\nBuzzsaw & Ratbat (for those who don't want to buy the Leader Soundwave, could be more toon coloured, new mold Ratbat wouldn't hurt but he's the least in need of an upgrade)\n\nGraphy & Noise\n\nPlayback & Wingthing\n\nOr, y'know, if they just wanted to sell a couple of big pulse-exclusive boxsets containing all the cassettes per faction, I'd buy that.\n\nAfter Ratbat and Ramhorn are released I am just waiting for 86 Laserbeak\n\nI haven't had trouble with Eject with my Blaster, and I was pretty sure that SS Rumble and Frenzy fit Soundwave, but I am not sure if I actually did fit them or am just remembering it.\n\nI was messing with my Twincast a few days ago, the door often got stuck when Rewind was inside. And I remember SS86 Frenzy (red) Rumble not being a better fit than Siege Rumble, as it was one of the first things I checked when I got that figure. The only other cassette mold I have, Ratbat, also is a very snug fit.\n\nYeah I love it. I like listening to his opinions even if I don't always agree. I feel for him tho. He lives in Asia right and I think he pays a lot more for them than we do"
