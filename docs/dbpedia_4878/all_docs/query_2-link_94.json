        "text": "Tom Chaplin releases ‘Quicksand’ the first single from his powerful solo album ‘The Wave’ out October 14th. Written by Tom and produced by Matt Hales (Aqualung, Lianne La Havas), it’s one of many album highlights.\n\nLike much of the record, the single is hugely evocative, driven by Tom’s unmistakable voice. “Quicksand is a letter to my daughter,” Tom admits. “I wanted to share my experience that life will be full of highs and lows and that I will always be there for her when she needs me.”\n\nThe Telegraph declared that ‘The Wave’ contains “some of the most gorgeous, anthemic, uplifting music of Chaplin’s career” while adding “What makes it even more extraordinary is that it marks Chaplin’s recorded debut as a songwriter”.\n\nWith ‘The Wave’, Tom is beginning a new chapter in what has so far been an incredible career as the lead singer with Keane, the multi-million selling British band who scored 5 number one albums between 2004 and 2013.\n\nThe accompanying video, directed by Mike Baldwin, is endearingly warm and honest. “Tom was keen to have the story based around a child, which I think perfectly captures the essence of the song,” the director says. “I wanted it to be intimate yet have a cinematic scale and a big heart. I love classic movies from the 80’s that have kids as the main protagonist (ET, Stand By Me, Goonies etc) and they were the main influences for this film.”"
