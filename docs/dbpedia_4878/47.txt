We are very proud of the diversity in our upcoming slate as well as in our catalog, which is comprised of films from every genre.

Advice for filmmakers:

Make sure you meet the marketing and distribution people who will be working on your film and make sure they love it! Get specific with the distribution person about which theaters s/he can get for your film. You should trust their experience and expertise, but tell the distributor about other films your film reminds you of and specific elements from other films’ release campaigns that you would like them to emulate. You have been living with the project for a lot longer than they have and they should appreciate your input and feedback. Sometimes it’s better to work with a smaller distributor who will give your film the proper TLC.
