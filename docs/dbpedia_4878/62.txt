Quicksand is an action-comedy about best friends Ray (Tanner Presswood) and Paul (Simon Elias) who embark on a treacherous road trip after losing their friend’s wedding ring just days before the ceremony. Their quest to retrieve the ring accelerates into a loud exploration of life, love, and how to not die. The film features many recognizable locations around Traverse City, Leelanau, and the Upper Peninsula.
