Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz were married today at the home of the bride’s parents in Encino, California.

Ashlee Simpson, 23, and Pete Wentz, 28, were wed in front of 150 with Ashlee’s father Joe Simpson, a minister, officiating the non-denominational ceremony. Sister Jessica Simpson was the maid of honor.

Aerial views of the home showed large tents set up for the celebration. The entertainment media has been abuzz all week as rumors were flying that Simpson would marry this weekend. When the Simpson clan gathered Friday at Jessica’s house, the secret was out. Although they made no attempt to hide it, a la Mariah and Nick, the couple still managed to stay relatively under the radar.

The bride wore a Monique Lhuillier gown and Neil Lane jewels. Guests were treated to an Alice In Wonderland-themed reception after the ceremony, complete with “a wedding cake piled high with a top hat, tea pot, stop watch and a pot of flowers on top,” according to People.

Photos of the wedding will certainly surface in the coming days. With a potential pay day in the millions, there is no way those photos will not see the light of day.

Rumors that Ashlee is pregnant continue to swirl after the couple married so quickly after announcing their engagement. Ashlee’s latest album, “Bittersweet World”, peaked at number four on the Billboard charts.
