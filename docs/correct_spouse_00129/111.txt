Pete Wentz's family and background

The rockstar was born in Wilmette, Illinois, Chicago. Pete Wentz parents, Dale Lewis and Pete Wentz II, worked as a high school admissions counsellor and an attorney, respectively.

A fun fact about the star is that he is half black and not Caucasian as most people believe. Amid the #BlackLivesMatter protests and campaigns currently going on in America and all over the world, many Pete Wentz Fall Out Boys fans were surprised to find out that he is biracial.

While his father is of German and English ancestry, Pete Wentz mom is of Afro-Jamaican descent. Some fans were quick to point at how since he can easily pass as white, the star has gone through life with white privilege.

Others, on the other hand, defended him by stating that the rockstar has always been criticized for embracing his black side and roots.

The celebrity is the eldest of three children. Pete Wentz siblings are Andrew & Hillary Wentz.

Did Pete Wentz leave Fall Out Boy? No, he did not.

However, Fall Out Boy took a hiatus from 2009 to 2013. The bassist was the only one who did not want to take a break.

At the time, his relationship with Ashlee Simpson was all over the tabloids. He felt this overshadowed the band's efforts and that he had let the group down.

Dating history and married life

Like many high-profile musicians, the celebrity's dating life has been a subject of discussion and sometimes a source of scrutiny. Here are all the women that the star has been linked to since 2003.

Jeanae White

The two dated for about three years, from 2003 to 2006. After they broke up, Fall Out Boy released the album Take This To Your Grave.

Many fans assumed that the album's songs were about the star's relationship with White. Some sources claim that at the time they were dating, Jeanae was underage, at about 15 -17 years old.

Michelle Trachtenberg

The American actress and the rockstar dated for a few months in 2006. In July 2011, the two sparked dating rumours when they were spotted grabbing coffee together.

Ashlee Simpson Ross

The two were first spotted together at a MisShapes Labor Day party in New York City in September 2006. In April 2008, after almost two years of dating, the love birds announced that they were engaged.

A little over a month later, on 17th May 2008, Ashley became Pete Wentz wife. The couple exchanged wedding vows in Ashlee's parents Encino home and her father, Joe, officiated the non-denominational ceremony.

Sadly, the marriage was not meant to last. After nearly three years of marriage, Simpson filed for divorce on 8th February 2011.

Years later, Fall Out Boy Pete Wentz opened up about their divorce. He claimed that the hiatus that his band was on at the time took a toll on him and he spiralled.

He also believes that they were both quite young, making it harder to sustain a marriage. Their divorce was finalized in November 2011.

Meagan Camper

Pete Wentz girlfriend is a model, and the two began dating in late 2011 and have now been together for almost nine years. When asked whether he will marry Meagan, the rocker said they are not in any rush to tie the knot.

...the relationship and commitment and responsibility we have to each other and to our kids is so much bigger(than a wedding)â€” it's a lifetime thing.
