        "text": "If you know me then you know I am a bit of an art fan. I am not an artist but many of my family and friends are very talented.\n\nI am more of an art appreciator. I am what you might call a want-to-be collector. To be a true collector I might need a bigger budget however, it is hard to find a space around my house where you could hang another painting. This all being said you can imagine how people like me feel when someone damages a piece of art.\n\nSculpture Vandalized Last Month Good as New in New Paltz, NY\n\nThere are so many ways to let people know what we want them to hear but if it involves spray painting a piece of art to get your point across I have to draw the line. Walls can be painted over but once art is altered the original piece is compromised.\n\nSEE Also: Flag Sculpture Vandalized in New Paltz\n\nYou may recall back in October I shared the news that a flag sculpture had been spray painted over at the Water Street Market in New Paltz, NY. Obviously, this person needed to make a point but all I could see was that the Flag Sculture was destroyed.\n\nSo go ahead and call me wrong. I stand here corrected. The sculpture has been successfully repaired and looks as good as new. When it happened a few people had said there were ways to get the paint of the painted sculpture but I will admit I had my doubts.\n\nI had seen it being worked on by a person I would assume was the artist and today I saw it finished and hanging in all its glory. There was also no word about anyone found to be responsible for the vandalism. Water Street Market is home to many pieces of art. There are Peace Polls around the market along with many other sculpted pieces.\n\nNew Sculptures Installed at Water Street Market New Paltz, New York\n\nThese Breakups Broke our Hearts, Supposedly"
