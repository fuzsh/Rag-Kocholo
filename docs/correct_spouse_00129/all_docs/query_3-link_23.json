It is not known at what time the first interment was made in this cemetery, nor can it be told exactly from any memorials contained in the yard itself. The first persons buried here were probably the children and the grandchildren of the first Peter Wentz who died in infancy before 1740. From the inscription on the tombstone of Mrs. Peter Wentz it is evident that there was a burial ground here as early as 1744."
