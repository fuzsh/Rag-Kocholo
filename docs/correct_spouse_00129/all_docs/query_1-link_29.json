        "text": "Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz have announced there are expecting their first baby together.\n\nRumours were sparked recently after the younger sister of Jessica Simpson was spotted with an unusually round belly.\n\nHowever Fall Out Boy bassist Wentz, 28, has just confirmed the pregnancy on his blog.\n\nHe said: “While many have speculated about this, we wanted to wait until after the first trimester to officially confirm that we are expecting our first child.\n\n“This is truly the most joyous time in our lives and we are excited to share the happy news and start our family.”\n\nThe couple, who have been inseparable since they started dating in autumn 2006, married just last month in a private ceremony at Simpson’s parents home in Los Angeles, with Jessica as the maid of honour.\n\nSinger Ashlee, 23, recently announced she will take her husband’s name in private but professionally will be known as Simpson-Wentz.\n\nAfter a shaky start to her pop career, Ashlee now seems to be enjoying success. Her new album, Bittersweet World reached No4 on the Billboard 200 in its first week."
