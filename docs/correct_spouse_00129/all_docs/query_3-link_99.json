Sarah ( ) d. Dec. 4, 1792 aged 422, (SJ) 1 ADDITION: [Note: Because of the wide variance in the spelling of the name, \"Custer\" is the spelling used for all members of the family below, except Hermanus.]\n\nPaul Custer (V 1776-1787) was associated with St. James Church from 1776-1793.\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n\n2 Sarah's stone was examined in May, 2004 and found to be clearly readable: \"In Memory of Sarah Custer, Wife of Paul Custer, Who departed this Life The 4th day of December 1795 Aged 42 years.\" (Same as Cemetery Records6), not 1792 as above. 3 NOTE: No evidence has been found to date of a grandson of Hermanus Koster who was married to a Sarah in 1790. His known grandson Paul b. 1737, died in 1800 leaving a widow, Elizabeth. During this time frame there was no apparent connection between the family of Hermanus and St. James Church. Based on the evidence below it is more likely that the Vestryman and Pew Holder Paul was the son of Nicholas Custer and Susanna (Hoppe) of Limerick Twp., grandson of Arnold and 2nd wife Rebecca ( ) Custer and of Johann Heinrich and Anna Elizabeth (Sprogel) Hoppe. Paul appears in the Lutheran Church records only when baptized 7 Sept., 1746. However, the baptism record of two of his children, recorded in Rev. Muhlenberg's Journal, identify his wife as \"Sara\", his father as Nicholas, and the names of their children: (1) Rebecca b. 1777 (2) Samuel b. 1778\n\n(Castor Assn. of America, The Descendants of Paulus and Gertrude Castor, p. 213-215; Muhlenberg Journals12, Vol. 1:192, Vol. 3: 151, 259, NOTES.)\n\n(1) In 1776 Nicholas, a Blacksmith, and Susanna (Hoppe) Custer owned land in Providence Twp. near the Church Land, when their son Emanuel is listed 10 Dec. as a Sergeant in the 5th Battalion, Lt. Arnold Francis' Providence Twp. Company.\n\n(Phila. Co. Sheriff's Book 2:181; Phila. Co. Deed Book D-1:133-137; PA. AR., Sixth Series, Vol. I, p. 807; St. James Families - Rev War.)\n\n(2) Only one Paul Custer/Custard m. to Sarah appears in the Phila. Co. land records. Tax lists of Worcester Twp. 1779-1780 show a Paul, a blacksmith, not near Paul the grandson and other descendants of Hermanus. This Paul, the blacksmith, buys land in Limerick Twp. in April, 1780, and sells it with his \"wife Sarah\" in 1793.\n\n(Extant Tax Lists of Worcester, Providence, Skippack/Perkiomen and Limerick Twps.1769-1786, PA. AR., Third Series, Vol. XIV-XVI; Mont. Co. Deed book, 15:92, 15:94.)\n\n(3) Feb. 22nd, 1780 Emanuel Custer was appointed Vestryman for the ensuing year. June 7th, 1780 Paul Custer, who does not appear on Feb. 22nd list, appears as Vestryman. Emanuel removed to Berks Co. in 1780.\n\n(4) Sarah Custer's 1795 tombstone is in Cemetery plot M5 near plot N1-N5, of the family of Nicholas Custer and Christiana (Stahl) Custer. Nicholas m. Christiana, 1792 (SJ), d. April 25, 1840, aged 76 years, 3 mo., 28 days, apparently, son of Christian Custer, whose son Nicholas was b. 1 Jan. 1764, and grandson of Nicholas and Susanne (Hoppe) Custer. Stone N5 is a child of Nicholas and Christiana d. 1795.\n\n(Cemetery Cards, St. James Archives; St. Michael's and Zion Lutheran Church Recs, LDS films, 387891, 387892.)\n\n#16c JACOB FRONEFIELD d.
