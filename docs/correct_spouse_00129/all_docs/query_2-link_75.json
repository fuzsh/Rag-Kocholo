        "text": "Getty Images\n\nAhhh, one of the most talked-about celebrity divorces in history. It seemed like the perfect match when super star Brad Pitt married America's sweetheart Jennifer Aniston in 2000. They announced their divorce four and a half years later in 2005, when Brad fell for Angelina Jolie on the set of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith.' Nowadays, Brad and Angelina seem content with their six children, and Jennifer is said to be in a hot new romance with Justin Theroux.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"Dexter\" stars Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter play brother and sister on the hit Showtime show and were married in 2008. Despite her seeing him through his cancer, they sadly announced their split last year.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe sexy pair married in a private ceremony in 2008 in Canada. The marriage lasted two years, as both Ryan and Scarlett filed for divorce citing \"irreconcilable differences\" last year. The split is reportedly amicable however, with Ryan and Scarlett seen out together even after they announced their split.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAshlee Simpson and Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz made a rocking couple when they married in 2008. However, their relationship took a nasty turn when Ashlee filed for divorce this February and rumors started to emerge that she was dating Pete's close friend, musician Craig Owens. However, the couple remains committed to caring for their son Bronx, being frequently photographed together as they share parental duties. After nearly three years into the marriage, guess these two just couldn't stay together for the kids.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt seemed like a fairy tale when \"Desperate Housewives\" star Eva Longoria married San Antonio Spurs starting point guard Tony Parker in Paris. But the couple's divorce was finalized in January this year, marking the end of three years together.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"America's Next Top Model\" Adrianne Curry and \"Brady Bunch\" star Christopher Knight were always considered the odd couple due to their 25-year age difference. However, the two managed to shock people by staying married for five years. But their ending turned out to be a not so happy one, as the couple announced their separation on May 29th, the very day of their five year wedding anniversary."
