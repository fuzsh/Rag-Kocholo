        "text": "Simpson, 26, married the former Fall Out Boy bassist, 31, in May 2008 and the couple had one child, Bronx, together.\n\n\"After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to file for divorce,\" the couple said in a statement.\n\n\"We remain friends and deeply committed and loving parents to our son Bronx, whose happiness and well-being remains our number one priority. We ask that everyone honor our privacy as we navigate this next phase of our lives,\" the statement added.\n\nThe younger sister of pop singer Jessica Simpson cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the cause for the split and is seeking joint custody of their toddler son.\n\nShe is also seeking spousal and child support from Wentz.\n\nSources close to Simpson claim Wentz's behavior was the cause for the break-up.\n\n\"It's really all about Pete's erratic behavior. She really wanted out,\" a source told TMZ.\n\nBut reps from Team Wentz said the couple just grew apart.\n\n\"After Bronx was born Ashlee made a conscious decision to get out of the business, but Pete's heart was in music so he kept touring and that became a big issue in their relationship,\" a source close to Wentz added.\n\nWentz, who is bipolar and attempted suicide in 2005 -- before he met Simpson, has credited his marriage and family life with helping him settle down.\n\n\"While I'll always be bipolar, I find it easier to deal with now. With marriage and fatherhood, I've finally found two fixed points in my life. They've taught me patience,\" he told Britain's Live magazine in 2009."
