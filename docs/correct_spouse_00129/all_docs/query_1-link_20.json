But now they'll have to be cute and perfect individually as it's just been confirmed that Ashlee has filed for divorce after just under three years of marriage.\n\n\"After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to file for divorce,\" the couple said through their PR. \"We remain friends and deeply committed and loving parents to our son Bronx, whose happiness and well-being remains our number one priority. We ask that everyone honor our privacy as we navigate this next phase of our lives.\" TMZ say that Ashlee (who recently had a dramatic new hairdo, just like people always do when they're a-breaking up) cited \"irreconcilable differences\" in the papers filed at LA County Superior Court. That court sounds a bit up itself - fancy naming yourself \"superior\".\n\nApparently Ashlee has asked for joint legal custody but primary physical custody of two year old Bronx Mowgli. Oddly, the family were pictured looking perfectly happy together just a few days ago, and Pete tweeted on Monday saying \" dont forget 2 notice-when i look into the lil dudes eyes & smile, the way he loves. i realize @ ashsimpsonwentz is a good moma + so much more.\"\n\nHopefully this all means this is one celeb split that isn't too nasty. They don't look like they have nasty bones in their sweet little bodies, anyway. We're going to stop typing now and go and have a little cry.\n\nWords: Isabel / Pictures: Getty Images"
