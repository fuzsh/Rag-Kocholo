        "text": "Ashlee Ross-Næss (born October 3, 1984), known professionally as Ashlee Simpson, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Simpson is the ex-wife of Pete Wentz and the mother of Bronx Mowgli Wentz.\n\nCareer[]\n\nHer debut album, Autobiography, was released on July 20, 2004, to a generally mixed critical reception. The album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States, selling an estimated 398,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nSimpson had a supporting role in the film Undiscovered, portraying an aspiring actress named Clea. But the film was a critical and commercial failure, and it earned Simpson a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards.\n\nSimpson released her second studio album, I Am Me, in October 2005. The album featured similar pop-rock themes as found on her debut effort, though Simpson hoped to incorporate the feel of music from the 1980s into her sound.\n\nBittersweet World, Simpson's third studio album, was released on April 19, 2008. The album saw a decline for Simpson, debuting at number 4 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 47,000 copies.\n\nIn 2009, Simpson returned full-time to television episodes by playing the role of Violet Foster in Melrose Place, The CW's revamp of the 1990s series of the same name.\n\nFall Out Boy[]\n\nIn 2006, Simpson started dating Pete Wentz. In April 2008, Simpson and Wentz confirmed their engagement and were married on May 17, 2008, at Simpson's parents' residence in Encino, California, with her father officiating the ceremony. Two weeks later, she confirmed her pregnancy. Her surname changed from Simpson to Wentz and she was briefly known professionally as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. Simpson gave birth to their son, Bronx Mowgli Wentz, on November 20, 2008. Wentz said the reason behind the name Bronx \"comes back to a very specific story between me and my wife. But I would just like to say that it wasn't because either of us were trying to give our son street cred. At the end of the day, we like the name. Brooklyn gets a lot of love. It's time for the Bronx to get a little bit of love too.\"\n\nOn February 8, 2011, Simpson filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". She asked for joint custody and primary physical custody of their son, Bronx, with visitation for Wentz, along with spousal support. However, a later report said that Simpson believed the couple simply \"married too young\", with the source stating that, \"It was honestly a classic case of marrying young, having a kid young and growing apart over the years\". Wentz reportedly did not want the divorce. Their divorce was finalized on November 22, 2011."
