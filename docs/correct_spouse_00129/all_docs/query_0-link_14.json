        "text": "Ashlee Simpson and ex-husband Pete Wentz’s 14-year-old son, Bronx, appears to have hit a growth spurt since the last time the mom-and-son duo was seen on social media.\n\nThe “Autobiography” singer’s husband, Evan Ross, shared a carousel post on Instagram Monday of them celebrating their daughter Jagger’s 8th birthday.\n\n“JAGGER SNOW ROSS. Happy birthday. Your [sic] everything,” the caption read.\n\n“Love you beyond this planet. Proud of you. Your [sic] 8. How is that possible. Wow. Wow.”\n\nThe family was all smiles for their daughter’s Barbie-inspired birthday bash.\n\nSimpson, 38, dressed the part as well, wearing a flower-printed Barbie bodysuit with blue jeans and pink sunglasses. The “Pieces of Me” songstress held her and Ross’ son, Ziggy, 2, in her arms for the group snap.\n\nBronx also played into the theme, wearing pink shorts.\n\nAnother photo in the slideshow featured the birthday girl gleaming as she posed in a pink argyle dress and matching sandals alongside a plethora of Barbie-themed gifts.\n\nThe birthday bash also featured a backyard “bubble house” and all-pink balloons.\n\nIn January, Simpson joked about her son’s height during a conversation with Jennifer Hudson.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe “Hot Chick” star recalled how her son, who she said “towers” over her, was mistakenly offered wine by a server when she and Ross were at a movie theater with the teen.\n\n“He’s not my friend,” Simpson swiftly told the server at the time. “Well, he’s my friend, but this is my kid, my 14-year-old son.\n\n“[He’s] not [drinking] on my account. Not until he’s 21.”\n\nSimpson and Wentz welcomed Bronx in November 2008, six months after the two musicians tied the knot. Three years later, the pair divorced.\n\nSimpson went on to wed Evan, who is the son of “I’m Coming Out” hitmaker Diana Ross, in 2014.\n\nWhile the Fall Out Boy bassist, 44, did not remarry, the musician began dating his longtime partner Meagan Camper in 2011.\n\nThe two have welcomed son Saint, 7, and daughter Marvel, 3.\n\nIn 2018, Simpson told Us Magazine that she “lucked out” with Wentz and Camper when it comes to the two families’ co-parenting abilities, calling the model “wonderful.”\n\nEvan, 34, also gave high praises for their relationship, telling the outlet, “I think the fact that there is a lot of respect amongst all of us, that makes it easier. And we’re all really close friends. It’s easy.”\n\nSharing a similar sentiment, Wentz told US Magazine in an interview the following year that Simpson’s parenting style was a “good balance” to his own.\n\n“She’s a great mom,” he said, adding that Simpson is also a “great person.”"
