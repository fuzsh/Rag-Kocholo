        "text": "UPDATE (5/1) — ‘Flip or Flop’ fans will be so happy about the latest update in the Christina and Tarek El Moussa story. The exes were spotted on the red carpet at the 44th Daytime Emmy Awards–walking arm-in-arm for good measure. Considering they’ve made several headlines over the past few months for their relationship troubles and upcoming divorce, it’s encouraging to see them make an appearance like this. It certainly doesn’t hurt that they’re all smiles while doing so.\n\nvia Getty Images\n\nThough they are not back together as a couple, they are confirmed to appear together in the eighth season of their hit HGTV show, beginning in December of this year. If their decision to walk together on the red carpet is any indication of future friendliness between the former pair, we can’t wait to see what else they have in store for us!\n\nvia Getty Images\n\nUPDATE (4/25) — ‘Flip or Flop’ fans might be surprised to learn that the latest development in Christina and Tarek El Moussa saga is–finally!–some happy news. The show has been confirmed for a seventh season. Despite being in the midst of a much-publicized divorce, Tarek and Christina El Moussa have both been confirmed to reappear in the next season, which is set to premiere on HGTV in December.\n\nThough the former couple has had many ups and downs since announcing their surprising split in December 2016, including both of them seeing other people, the duo have reported much more success in co-parenting as time has gone on.\n\n“The kids are really happy, they’re healthy; Tarek and I are in a good spot,” Christina said back in March. “We have a lot of things that we’re working on, cool things coming in the future, so we’re just looking forward.”\n\nWe hope to hear many more positive updates from them in the future! Stay tuned.\n\nUPDATE (3/20) — There’s been no shortage of emotional news coming from the El Moussa family in the past several months. And the latest revelation from Tarek is no different. The ‘Flip or Flop’ star shared revealing before-and-after photos illustrating his battle with testicular and thyroid cancer.\n\n“Look at this photo and look at my eyes,” he said in the caption. “I was a skeleton. This took a major toll on my physical and mental health…. This is from hurting my back after battling 2 cancers. I had a 60 pound weight swing from my illnesses.”\n\nFortunately, Tarek is feeling much better now. And that much can be seen in a recent pic that he shared shortly after his emotional “before” snap.\n\n“I think this picture represents winning the war against my illnesses,” he wrote of the “after” photo in the caption.\n\nStay well, Tarek!\n\nUPDATE (2/27) — This is the best news we’ve heard in a while from former couple Tarek and Christina El Moussa. Tarek has opened up in an exclusive interview with ETOnline.com about where their relationship currently stands. According to him, they are “great friends” at this point, and he calls her a “great mom” to their two children. Most encouraging? He does not shut out the possibility of getting back together with Christina at some point in the future.\n\n“Maybe, like, 10 years from now,” he said. “Honestly, it took a lot of work to get to a good place for both of us, that I think we are at the point where we aren’t looking back, we are looking towards our future. I don’t know where the future is going to take me, but you never know.”\n\nIt’s hard to say where the future will take anyone, but it’s refreshing to see more positivity from the former pair, especially considering how nasty some breakups can be.\n\nUPDATE (2/24) — Christina El Moussa just revealed a heart-wrenching detail about her divorce from her ex, Tarek–how hard it was to break the news to her children. She said it was very difficult to explain the situation to her 6-year-old daughter, Taylor.\n\n“Taylor asked if we could get back together,” she said. “We had to explain that sometimes couples get divorced but that she and Brayden are our No. 1 priority. We’ll always be a family.”\n\nSo sad. We continue to keep the whole family in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.\n\nUPDATE (2/22) — It seems like we can’t go more than a few days without hearing another heartbreaking update about the Tarek and Christina El Moussa split. And this latest piece of news must have been particularly hard for the ‘Flip or Flop’ couple to break to the world.\n\nTarek has revealed that he has battled testicular cancer. Though he had been open about his fight with thyroid cancer, this is the first time he has opened up about the other health issue.\n\n“I had thyroid cancer in 2013. One month later they found out I had testicular cancer. It was very difficult on me. My hormones were way off. It affected me. It’s been three years of hell,” Tarek said in an exclusive interview with UsMagazine.com. “I was devastated when I found out. So was Christina.”\n\nAfter an emergency surgery, Tarek went through many radiation treatments.\n\n“It took a big toll on me,” he said. “It kicked my butt.”\n\nThe good news is that he is now in remission. Just weeks before announcing his split with Christina, he had a cancer screening that came out negative.\n\nWhile Christina fortunately doesn’t have any scary health updates, she did recently share some sad news about her new relationship. She confirmed that her relationship with Gary Anderson, the family’s former contractor, is over and that she is single again, according to DailyMail.co.uk.\n\nAnderson was reportedly the first man Christina had dated since her split from Tarek. And an insider revealed that the couple ultimately “broke up because of too many outside pressures.”\n\nA rep for Christina said, “Christina is single and being in a relationship is the last thing on her mind. She is taking this time to focus on her children and herself.”\n\nSo heartbreaking all around for all involved. Let’s hope we hear more happy news from this family soon!\n\nUPDATE (2/21) — Flip or Flop star Christina El Moussa has finally opened up with more details about what went wrong in her marriage to husband and co-star, Tarek. The HGTV stars officially separated in May 2016, and Tarek filed for divorce in January 2017.\n\n“Like any couple, we had our share of issues,” Christina told People magazine. “We went through a lot in a short amount of time.”\n\nThe reality TV couple–who are parents to daughter Taylor, 6, and son Braydon, 18 months–launched their hit home makeover series in 2013. That same year, Tarek was suddenly diagnosed with thyroid cancer and went through radiation treatment. Later, the couple began a grueling struggle to get pregnant via in vitro fertilization, and Christina suffered a miscarriage in 2014.\n\nIt all added up to plenty of pressure and tension.\n\n“I was overwhelmed. The tension between me and Tarek was high. We weren’t able to properly communicate anymore. It got to the point where we weren’t even driving to set together,” she told People.\n\nLuckily, that tension seems to have dissipated following the couple’s official split. “I think the separation process begins long before people actually separate,” she said. “So by the time we officially did, I felt like a weight was lifted off me.”\n\nShe also made it clear she wishes Tarek nothing but the best, and is accepting of the fact that they will each date other people.\n\n“Tarek and I don’t discuss each other’s personal lives…I’m happy for him and whatever steps he takes in his life,” she said.\n\nMore good news? The couple plans to continue working together–and are both committed to having a friendly co-parenting relationship.\n\n“We’re just normal, nice people who just, you know, want to be the best parents and coworkers that we can be,” Christina told Good Morning America. “Our kids are transitioning well. Tarek and I are friends and we have a lot of support from our family.”\n\nAfter a stormy few months, we’re so glad they seem to be looking ahead to the future–and that the kids are doing well. Christina and Tarek certainly get our kudos for staying focused on what really matters.\n\nUPDATE (2/17) — Finally some good news for Tarek and Christina El Moussa. Despite their ongoing divorce, Christina just posted an uplifting image with her ex and their ‘Flip or Flop’ colleagues, saying that filming the last season of the show has been a “breeze.”\n\nSee for yourself in her Instagram pic below.\n\nLet’s hope things continue to go smoothly!\n\nUPDATE (1/25) — Things are getting pretty ugly between Tarek and Christina El Moussa. Just days after the former pair announced that they were planning to divorce, insiders are claiming that they are hardly speaking when off camera during the last season of ‘Flip or Flop.’ Sources are also claiming that Tarek has had flings with two 20-something women in the meantime. According to UsMagazine.com, an insider did not mince words about Christina’s thoughts on the matter, saying, “She thinks Tarek is an absolute pig.”\n\nIn response to these claims, Tarek has declined to comment on them, saying in a statement, “I will keep my focus on what matters most, which is coparenting our children.”\n\nUPDATE (1/10) — Things just got very real for one of our favorite HGTV duos. Flip or Flop star Tarek El Moussa has officially filed for divorce from his wife and co-star, Christina, according to PEOPLE.\n\nNearly a month after the couple saddened fans by announcing their split after seven years of marriage, Tarek’s lawyer revealed that the star has filed to legally separate from his wife.\n\nDespite the news, Tarek has remained positive on social media, calling himself the “luckiest man alive” just three days ago on Instagram, where he shared an adorable home video of himself dancing with his two children, daughter Taylor, 6, and son Brayden, 1.\n\nSince the shocking breakup, the couple has vowed to remain devoted, amicable co-parents to their children. We’re happy to hear that!\n\nUPDATE (12/20/16) — More sad news for Flip or Flop fans. Following the heartbreaking bombshell about Tarek and Christina El Moussa’s separation, it now appears their beloved show is coming to an end as well. Despite the pair’s reassurance that their HGTV hit would continue, E! Online has learned that the show will last beyond 2016, but not much longer than that. Reportedly, new episodes will be filmed in the new year to fulfill contractual obligations, but the show will end after that sometime in 2017.\n\nClick here to enter for a chance to win $1 million!\n\nUPDATE (12/16/16) — New details have emerged about Tarek and Christina El Moussa’s surprising split. Both Tarek and Christina have already opened up about dating other people since May. And now, according to NYDailyNews.com, Christina is in a romantic relationship with the family’s former home contractor, Gary Anderson.\n\nMeanwhile, no new details about who Tarek has been dating have been revealed. But the dad did take to Instagram to share a sweet snapshot of himself with his young daughter.\n\n“It’s been a crazy few days but we love our kids so much!” he wrote in the caption.\n\nUPDATE (12/15) — Tarek and Christina El Moussa have opened up more about their shocking split in a new interview with People, and revealed what the status of their relationship is now.\n\n“We have both dated other people following the separation, but neither of us is ready to announce anything in terms of another relationship,” they said.\n\nThey added that they plan to continue working together in their professional life by “being prepared” and “working hard.”\n\nRight now, the pair has no plans to officially file for divorce, and they say they’re keeping their young children their top priorities.\n\n“The most difficult part of the decision to separate was the kids,” they said. “We want the best for them, and we’re doing everything we can to ensure that.”\n\n(12/12/16) Sad news for Flip or Flop couple Tarek and Christina El Moussa. After seven years of marriage, the HGTV stars have separated.\n\nThey announced their split on Dec. 12, following reports of a “possibly suicidal male with a gun” on their property earlier this year.\n\nIn a joint statement to People magazine, they said, “Like many couples, we have had challenges in our marriage. We had an unfortunate misunderstanding about six months ago and the police were called to our house in an abundance of caution. There was no violence and no charges were filed.”\n\nTarek and Christina, who have two young children, added that they will be seeking counseling to try to “sort out” their relationship.\n\n“During the process, we are committed to our kids and being the best parents we can be,” they said. “We will continue to work through this process civilly and cooperatively, and plan to continue our professional life together.”\n\nIn the meantime, HGTV released a statement of their own to People: “We admire and appreciate Tarek and Christina’s great work on Flip or Flop. When it comes to matters related to their own family, we respect their privacy and honor any decision that works best for them and their children. HGTV is currently airing episodes of Flip or Flop and the series will continue production as scheduled.”\n\nWe’re keeping Tarek and Christina and their whole family in our thoughts and prayers during this tough time.\n\nvia RedbookMag.com\n\nNEXT: See celebrities who reportedly shocked their spouses with divorce below."
