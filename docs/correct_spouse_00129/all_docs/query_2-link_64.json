        "text": "Maxum, who likes to go by Max, is an energetic and creative child.\n\nWhen you first meet him, Max will come off as shy and quiet, but after he settles in, Max opens right up and can hold a great conversation. He likes building with LEGOS and playing video games. He is active and enjoys playing sports outside. On rainy days, Max likes to draw and watch superhero movies.\n\nMax attends a collaborative school and has special education support to assist him. He is doing well and making progress.\n\nMax has a lot of curiosity and likes to learn and try new things. He enjoys playing with his peers and can make friends easily.\n\nMax would do well in a family of any makeup, best in a home that is adventurous, playful and compassionate. He has two sisters with whom he would like to maintain a relationship.\n\nMax visits with his birth parents four times a year and per his open adoption agreement will visit with his parents two times a year once the adoption is finalized.\n\nWho Can Adopt?\n\nIf you’re at least 18, have a stable source of income and have room in your heart, you may be a perfect match to adopt a waiting child. Adoptive parents can be single, married or partnered; experienced or not; renters or homeowners; LGBTQ+ singles and couples. As an adoptive parent, you won’t have to pay any fees. Adoption from foster care is completely free in Massachusetts.\n\nAdopting a child from foster care includes training, interviews and home visits to determine if adoption is right for you. These steps will help match you with a child or sibling group that will be a good fit.\n\nTo learn more about adoption from foster care, call the Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange (MARE) at (617) 964-6273 or visit www.mareinc.org. Start the process today and give a waiting child a permanent place to call home."
