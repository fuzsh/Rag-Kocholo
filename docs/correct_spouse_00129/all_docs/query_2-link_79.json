        "text": "Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale’s split in 2015 was definitely one of the saddest celebrity breakups in recent years. It’s always a major bummer to see love stories come to an end, especially since Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale had been together for about 20 years and had been married for nearly 13 years when they divorced.\n\nBut in a new interview, Rossdale has said that he still thinks his ex-wife is “incredible.” And the reason why is tugging on some major heartstrings.\n\n“We had 20 years together and that in itself is pretty incredible. It’s a lifetime. I still think she’s incredible,” the rocker said. “It was a lovely 20 years and we have three amazing children. There were a lot of positives, and with time they’ll become more and more obvious.”\n\nHe also admitted that he was not happy about going through the divorce in the first place.\n\n“[Divorce] was completely opposite to what I wanted. Really not…but here we are,” he said. “Apart from death, I think divorce is one of the hardest, most painful things to go through.”\n\nBut on a positive note, he also added that he and Stefani are committed to an amicable co-parenting relationship for the sake of their three children.\n\n“The one thing – the only good thing, because everything else is not good – is we care about the children and it’s about them. So we do everything to make this life change as seamless as possible,” he said.\n\nvia PEOPLE.com\n\nNEXT: See celebrities who reportedly shocked their spouses with divorce–breaking our hearts in the process–in the photos below."
