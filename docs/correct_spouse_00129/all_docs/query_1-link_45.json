I call up Patti Stanger for some sage advice, and she delivered. The Millionaire Matchmaker offers her advice on Pete Wentz and Ashlee Simpson's situation. She said:\n\nAnybody that has a baby or gets pregnant prior to the marriage is going to have some rocky problems in a relationship. In a perfect world, most people preplan their pregnancies and have enough time in the newlywed period for the dough to rise. Magnify them by being in the spotlight and that gives them a whole world of issues the average person doesn’t have to deal with. If they focus on their beautiful child they created together they will realize how much they have and won’t want to lose it.\n\nUm, Patti, I have something to tell you. I'm, er, pregnant. And unwed. I kid. I kid. (Seriously, dad, I'm kidding!!!)"
