And we enjoy each other's company, and we love our children.\"\n\nThe couple are parents to Jagger Snow, eight, and son Ziggy Blu, three, together and they also have Ashlee's 15-year-old son Bronx Mowgli from her previous marriage to Pete Wentz.\n\nEvan went on to admit he enjoys planning trips with his wife and they try to keep their relationship \"exciting\".\n\nAshlee previously revealed they have big plans for their anniversary because it coincides with two big birthdays.\n\nEvan told the outlet: \"We have big things coming up at the end of the year. It's our 10-year anniversary, I turn 40, my son [Bronx] turns 16.\n\n\"We always celebrate and have the best time, but I feel like it doesn't have to just be that day. It's finding those moments, which my husband's so good at.\n\n\"I feel like if we haven't had a moment, [he'll] take me to a hotel or [if] we've been in kid land, he'll surprise me with a nice together alone moment, which is nice.\"\n\nShe also explained how Evan keeps their relationship exciting, telling E! News: \"That friendship is so deep and it's so amazing.\n\n\"He surprises me and he takes me to do fun things, so I feel like those moments where you step outside of just parenting and connect is so nice.\"\n\nAshlee went on to insist that being good parents also helps their marriage, saying: \"Just to listen to your kids and follow what they're wanting and needing.\""
