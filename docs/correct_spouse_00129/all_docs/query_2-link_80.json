After being introduced by a mutual friend months before, the two hit it off with the Aussie crooner gushing: \"She is so classy and beautiful, just the change I needed after everything that has happened in the last two years.\" However after months of speculation that their relationship was a 'showmance', orchestrated by their shared management, the two called it quits in early April.\n\nTHE BIGGEST CELEB STORIES OF 2011\n\nThe Sexiest Men of 2011\n\nJanuary\n\nRihanna and Matt Kemp\n\nOFF: After a year-long romance RiRi and her LA Dodgers baseball star beau went their separate ways.

The two appeared in Shakira's Underneath Your Clothes video together, and released a joint statement, saying that they viewed that separation as “temporary” but Shakira was soon pictured with Spanish footballer Gerard Pique. Hmm.\n\nTHE BIGGEST CELEB STORIES OF 2011\n\nThe Sexiest Men of 2011\n\nJanuary\n\nScarlett Johansson and Sean Penn\n\nON/OFF: Despite a 25 year age-gap and the announcement only a month before that she was splitting from husband Ryan Reynolds, Scarlett Johansson was reportedly back in the dating saddle with Sean Penn in January. The two, who never confirmed their romance, apparently called it quits in June.\n\nTHE BIGGEST CELEB STORIES OF 2011\n\nThe Sexiest Men of 2011\n\nJanuary\n\nJake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift\n\nOFF: After just three months and a Thanksgiving together, Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift split.
