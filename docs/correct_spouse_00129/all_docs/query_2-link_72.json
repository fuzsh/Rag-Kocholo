        "text": "Divorce is never easy.\n\nIt calls for a separation of the lives two people built together. This includes finances, assets, and children.\n\nBut divorce isn’t another D-word for “dirty.” Former couples can co-parent their children successfully if they try hard enough.\n\nThanks to these 10+ celebs who are divorced and successfully co-parenting their children, we’ve learned that divorce truly can be amicable.\n\n1. Anna Faris and Chris Pratt\n\nThere is no bad blood between these exes since their split in 2017.\n\nTheir highest priority is raising their son, Jack, with lots of laughter and happiness. “We are great and there’s so much friendship and love,” Faris told Extra .\n\n2. Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick\n\nWhile they were never married, the couple were together for nine years. During this time, they welcomed three children together.\n\nA split hasn’t separated the family, though. They still take photos together and celebrate holidays.\n\n3. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\n\nMaybe these two were onto something with their whole “conscious uncoupling.”\n\nSince their divorce in 2014, they’ve maintained a healthy friendship for the sake of their two kids, Apple and Moses.\n\nPaltrow shared with *Vanity Fair* the way her relationship with Chris has evolved since getting divorced.\n\n“I would say very rarely is it difficult now. We’ve learned how to communicate with each other. We love each other. We laugh. We have the best of each other. It’s really nice. It makes you feel like you don’t have to lose.”\n\n4. Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey\n\nCannon has called himself “blessed” to be co-parenting his twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with the singer.\n\n“At the end of the day, you’ve got to be a little selfless,” he told People . “You have to say ‘It’s not about us.”‘\n\n5. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan\n\nSince getting divorced in April 2018, the parents of daughter Everly have learned to adjust to a “new normal.”\n\n“We’re in a very positive energy together, trying to be the best parents to Everly,” Tatum told Harper’s Bazaar .\n\n6. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner\n\nAfter a decade of being married, the couple committed to maintaining normalcy for the sake of their three kids, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel.\n\n“We’re doing our very best and we’re putting our kids first,” Affleck told CBS in 2016.\n\n7. Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon\n\nThe Cruel Intentions stars have nothing but good intentions when it comes to raising their kids, Deacon and Ava, together.\n\nOne way they keep things balanced is by trading off holidays to one another.\n\n“Last year, my kids and I went to my parents’ in Delaware, this year they will be with their mom and I am shooting a movie up in Toronto,” Ryan told *Entertainment Weekly* in 2016.\n\nSounds very practical!\n\n“You have to get to that point as a divorced parent, as any parent, where you’re not putting yourself first,” Phillippe said .\n\n8. Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony\n\nWhat divorce? “We are like best friends,” Lopez said on Today about her relationship with Anthony.\n\nThis certainly makes co-parenting their twins, Emme and Max, a lot easier. Jennifer is also part of a blended family with her fiancé, A-Rod, and his kids.\n\n9. Courteney Cox and David Arquette\n\nMutual respect has made co-parenting their daughter, Coco, as normal as possible.\n\n“We never went head-to-head, [or] battled each other, through the process of divorce and through the process of raising our kid,” Arquette told Yahoo in August.\n\n10. Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr\n\nWay before he met Katy Perry, Orlando was married to Victoria’s Secret model Miranda Kerr. Together, they had one son, Flynn.\n\n“Miranda and I have a remarkable relationship,” Bloom told Elle UK . “We co-parent really well.”\n\n11. Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler\n\nWhile there have been rumors of a nasty divorce swirling around, the former couple has maintained a united front in the co-parenting department.\n\nKristin even wished Jay a public Father’s Day message this past June.\n\n“Modern family? Coparenting? Whatever you want to call it, we are navigating it the best way we know how,” she wrote.\n\nThe family even spent this past Thanksgiving all together.\n\n“I’m happy that we’re able to spend it together and have conversations [about the menu] even though we’re in the middle of getting a divorce,” she told Us Weekly .\n\n12. Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen\n\nKate had Lily with her ex, Michael Sheen, who she was with from 1995 to 2003 .\n\nAnd even though she left him for another man, they’ve managed to maintain an amicable relationship throughout the years.\n\n“He’s really dear, close family,” she told *Popcorn With Peter Travers* in 2016.\n\n“He’s somebody I’ve known since I was 21 years old. I really love him a lot,” she continued .\n\nSince Michael lives in America, while Kate and Lily are in England, this has made co-parenting difficult at times.\n\n13. Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman\n\nIt’s been three years since they ended their relationship, but they still spend holidays together with their daughters, Frankie and Olive.\n\nDrew has referred to their “new normal” of co-parenting as a “happy, unorthodox union.”\n\n14. Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson\n\nKate has the epitome of a blended family: her three children all have different baby daddies. And yet, she manages to make co-parenting work.\n\nThe biggest thing she avoids is bad-mouthing her exes to her kids.\n\nThis is something that she learned from her mother, Goldie Hawn.\n\n“No matter what, I never heard a bad word about my father,” she said on a March 2019 episode of the Divorce Sucks! With Laura Wasser podcast.\n\n“Your child wasn’t in that relationship. Your child’s in a different relationship with their father. You need to support that relationship.”\n\n15. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman\n\nAfter their marriage of seven years came to an end, Uma and Ethan needed to find a way to make it work for their children’s sake.\n\nThey may not always agree, but there’s always an element of respect maintained.\n\n16. Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet\n\nLenny and Lisa have an incredibly rare appreciation and respect for one another. Their daughter, Zoe, has a lot to be thankful for.\n\nWhat’s even crazier is that Jason and Lenny have developed a real friendship with one another.\n\n18. Rachael Leigh Cook and Daniel Gillies\n\nRachel and Daniel’s divorce was about as amicable as you could hope for. They made a joint Instagram post announcing their intent to separate, and made sure to say how truly grateful they were for every year they’d spent together.\n\nThey’re making it work for their two children, Theodore and Charlotte.\n\n19. Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead\n\nI was mildly obsessed with Flip or Flop for awhile and was incredibly saddened when Tarek and Christina broke the news.\n\nChristina says she and Tarek always make a point of staying on the same page, stressing that communication is key.\n\n20. Elin Nordegren and Tiger Woods\n\nWhen infidelity is at play in a marriage, that can be an incredibly difficult thing to overcome.\n\nThankfully, Elin is able to respect the relationship her children have with their father and compartmentalize her emotions on the subject.\n\n21. Robin Thicke and Paula Patton\n\nRobin and Paula have come a long way. Their relationship ended in a bitter divorce that developed into an ugly battle in the courts for custody.\n\nIn the end, they agreed to share a 50/50 stake in all the major decisions , including schooling, religion, etc.\n\n22. Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz\n\nPete Wentz is the first to congratulate his ex-wife, Ashlee Simpson, on her co-parenting skills. The Fall Out Boy bassist commends her and her new husband, Evan, on being easy to communicate with and easy going.\n\n23. Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber\n\nLiev and Naomi have always maintained a healthy relationship with one another. For Naomi’s most recent birthday , Liev even took to Instagram to post a picture wishing her well.\n\nHe captioned the photo “Happy Birthday Mama!!”\n\n24. Wiz Khalifa and Amber Rose\n\nAs Amber explained it, sometimes two people just work better as best friends. Such certainly seems to be the case for Amber and Wiz.\n\nCustody was a bit of a battle, but since then they’ve managed to put their swords away.\n\n25. Bruce Willis and Demi Moore\n\nBruce and Demi have such a great co-parenting relationship with one another that Demi was even invited onto the dais during The Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis .\n\nIf you haven’t seen the video, she brings down the house.\n\n26.
