        "text": "John Lefever’s will - Philadelphia Co., PA, Will Bk R, p. 229 - his will was transcribed by “Penny” on the Lefevre forum (message # 277) The date of the will was 28 Oct 1778 and proven 3 Feb 1779.\n\n5th paragraph:\n\n“And all the remainder & residue of my whole estate whatever I leave behind me at the time of my decease, I give to all my children here after named share and share alike named Abraham, Isaac, Nicholas, Catharine now wife of Jacob Best, Anna Mary now wife of PETER MELLIG, Christina late wife of JOHN MELLIG and Elizabeth now wife of Leonard Gisemer to be equally divided amongst them only share and share alike.”\n\nThe phrase “Christina late wife of John Mellig” is peculiar and open to interpretation. “late wife” may have been used as opposed to “now wife” although “widow of” or “family of Christina” would have eliminated any confusion. But a deceased Christina may have been included in this way to include her family. Ancestry’s abstract included Christina, but made no mention of John Mellig, indicating one interpretation.Regardless, it appears that either John Mellig or Christina were deceased when John made his will.\n\nNot included in the 5th paragraph were daughters “Margaretha now wife of Jno Van Eaten” and “Susanna now wife of Gabriel Frey”\n\nJohn Lefever, aka Johannes Lefevre, Le Feber, Lefeber, Feber lived in Forks Twp “about 5 miles” from the future Easton of Northampton Co., PA when his daughters were married to Peter and John. At the time of those marriages the entire area was still included in Bucks County. (Northampton Co. was formed in 1752) Ancestry’s database includes “A Frontier Village - Pre-Revolutionary Easton” by A. D. Chidsey, Jr. This publication includes a chapter on “John Lefevre, Tavern Keeper” pp 59-73. Although the early ancestry given for John is questionable, much of the rest was verified through the use of the PA Archives and various publications. According to Mr.Chidsey, John always signed his name Lefeber, but stated most records used the Lefevre spelling. Both Mr. Chidsey and the author of “Friedensthal and its Stockaded Mill” (a Moravian Chronicle) refer to John Lefevre as a Huguenot.\n\nPeter Mölich was married to Anna Maria Feber in the Lutheran congregation located at Saucon, or what became Lower Saucon. In his will Peter gave his wife’s name as Mary. A birth and baptism for John Lefeber’s son Abraham and wife Elizabeth were included in the same Lutheran records as Peter Mölich. John Mölig was married to Christina LeFeber in a Lutheran church in Upper Saucon - which is now in Lehigh Co., PA (Lehigh Co. was formed in 1812)\n\nJohn Lefevre had lived in Worcester Twp of Philadelphia Co. (Rupp - Thirty Thousand Names) and had apparently been a member of the Skippack Reformed Church before moving to the Forks of the Delaware area. In the early 1760’s he returned to Worcester Twp. In 1760 members of the old Skippack Church met to make plans to build a church in Worcester and soon John Lefever joined them. “John LeFevre and Peter Wentz each donated one acre of land on which they stipulated that either a German Reformed or Presbyterian church should be erected. (“Wentz Church through 200 years; Wentz United Church of Christ, Worcester, Pennsylvania” apparently assembled by a Church committee in celebration of the 200 years) In this instance it appears the Germans outnumbered the Huguenots - or Scotch Irish. While researching my Huguenot ancestry, it was said the Calvinism of the Huguenots more closely resembled the Presbyterians.\n\nThe “Historical Sketch of Wentz Reformed Church, of Worcester Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania” and prepared by Rev. S. M. K. Huber, Schwenksville, 1881 includes mention/description of the deed conveying the two acres on p. 7 and includes the name of John’s wife. “The original deeds are dated January 2d, 1762” and “on the one part, John Lafevre and Christiana his wife” (and the other acre was conveyed by “Jacob Wentz and his wife, Elizabeth.”)\n\nAt the time of John Lefever’s will he was living in Hereford Township of Berks Co., PA. According to others one of his daughters, Susanna I think, was living there. In 1768 Berks Co. a baptism was recorded on 16 Apr 1768 for Catharina Melig whose father was Peter Melig - mother not named - in William J. Hinke’s “Church record of the Longswamp Reformed Church, Longswamp Township, Berks county, 1762-1810” described as an unpublished manuscript/ancestry. (If Catharine survived infancy and childhood, she was apparently deceased by the time her father wrote his will.) Proprietary Returns for Hereford Twp in the County of Berks, PA in 1768 included Peter Melich who was taxed for 2 horses. (PA Archives Series 3, Vol. XVIII p.130)\n\nPeter appears to have been living in the same general neighborhood as his father-in-law in what was then Philadelphia County. Two of his sons were among the confirmed on 9 May 1771 in the Lutheran Church at New Hanover: “ Peter Melick, Peter’s son….18 years“ followed by “Michael Melick (brother), Peter’s son….16 years.” (“A History of the Lutheran Church in New Hanover, Montgomery County, Penna” Compiled & arranged by the Pastor Rev. J. J. Kline, Ph. D. and pub. by the congregation, New Hanover, 1910 - p. 525Note: Montgomery County was formed in 1784)"
