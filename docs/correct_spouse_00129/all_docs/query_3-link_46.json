        "text": "In 2013, Ashlee Simpson started dating Evan Ross, Diana Ross's son. They became engaged in Janaury 2014, and married on Augst 30, 2014 at Diana Ross's estate in Connecticut.\n\nThey had daughter, Jagger Snow, in July 2015. They welcomed son Ziggy Blu on October 29, 2020.\n\nEvan Ross, widely recognized as the son of the legendary Diana Ross, rose to fame with his acting chops in projects such as ATL, Pride, and the hit TV series, 90210. His career skyrocketed when he snagged a role in the Hunger Games franchise, playing the character of Messalla. Ross is also known for his music career, having released his debut single \"Yes Me\" in 2011 and continuing to work on various musical projects with his wife. Apart from his relationship with Ashlee, Evan has remained relatively low-key about any previous high-profile romances.\n\nVincent Piazza and Ashlee Simpson began their love story in June 2011 after reportedly meeting at an exclusive celebrity party. The couple enjoyed several high-profile outings and events together, including an appearance at the Emmys in 2011. However, after a year and four months of adorable red carpet moments and Instagram-worthy vacations, the pair decided to call it quits in November 2012, citing conflicting schedules as the reason behind their breakup.\n\nVincent Piazza gained prominence with his role as gangster Lucky Luciano in the award-winning HBO series, Boardwalk Empire. He had previously made a mark in the acting world with notable performances in Rescue Me and The Sopranos. Vincent has also appeared in several films, including Jersey Boys, a 2014 musical drama directed by Clint Eastwood. Though Ashlee Simpson was his most high-profile relationship, he has since remained tight-lipped about his personal life and romantic interests.\n\nAshlee Simpson met Pete Wentz in early 2006 at the MTV Video Music Awards, and the couple confirmed their relationship in April of that year. The pair's whirlwind romance led to an engagement in April 2008, followed by a wedding ceremony on May 17, 2008. Pete and Ashlee shared many unforgettable experiences, including the birth of their son Bronx Mowgli Wentz in November the same year. Sadly, the couple parted ways and finalized their divorce in 2011, but they remain on good terms as co-parents to their son.\n\nPete Wentz rose to fame as the bassist, primary lyricist, and backup vocalist for the massively successful rock band, Fall Out Boy. With numerous chart-topping hits and a loyal fan base, Wentz has become a household name in the world of pop-punk. Additionally, Wentz has ventured into fashion, launching his clothing line Clandestine Industries, and dabbled in acting with guest appearances on shows like One Tree Hill. Before his relationship with Ashlee, Pete was linked to Michelle Trachtenberg and Jeanae White.\n\nAshlee Simpson and Braxton Olita's relationship bloomed in 2005, as the two met while Olita was playing guitar for Ashlee on tour. From sharing the stage and traveling around the world together, their connection grew stronger and more intimate. They often enjoyed vacations to Hawaii, which included a memorable trip in 2006 where they were photographed soaking up the sun and love. However, the couple eventually decided to part ways in July 2006, after nearly a year and a half of dating.\n\nBraxton Olita initially gained attention as a guitarist for Ashlee Simpson's band during her rise to fame. In addition to his musical talents, he is also recognized as a model, previously gracing the pages of magazines such as Vogue Italia. Braxton has kept a rather low profile since his relationship with Ashlee Simpson ended, making it difficult to determine any other high-profile romances or further updates on his career.\n\nWilmer Valderrama and Ashlee Simpson were rumored to have been romantically involved after they were spotted together at a nightclub in Los Angeles in 2005. While neither party ever confirmed the relationship, they were seen sharing a few cozy moments and flirtatious exchanges during that time. Despite the paparazzi's close watch, their supposed connection seemed to be short-lived, with both parties moving on rather quickly.\n\nWilmer Valderrama is best known for his quirky and lovable character Fez on the hit TV series, That '70s Show. Following his successful run on the show, he went on to appear in various films, television series, and even ventured into the world of voice acting. Valderrama has also gained notoriety for his high-profile relationships, having dated stars like Mandy Moore, Lindsay Lohan, and most notably, Demi Lovato with whom he had a six-year on-and-off relationship.\n\nAshlee Simpson and Ryan Cabrera first met in the early 2000s and struck up a close friendship. Their relationship took a romantic turn in 2004 after Cabrera moved into Simpson's home to work on his debut album. The couple appeared smitten with each other during their time together, and Cabrera even made a few appearances on Ashlee's reality show, The Ashlee Simpson Show. Unfortunately, their romance fizzled out after just a few months, and they returned to being good friends.\n\nRyan Cabrera launched his music career with the hit single \"On the Way Down\" in 2004. His debut album, Take It All Away, went on to achieve Platinum status and solidified his spot in the early 2000s pop-rock scene. Cabrera has continued making music and touring over the years, albeit with less commercial success. Apart from his relationship with Ashlee Simpson, he has been linked to other high-profile stars, including Avril Lavigne and Audrina Patridge."
