And we can confirm it’s true: We watched it happen. So what were the two of them doing in there? “Not cocaine,” Wentz pointedly told us a bit later, “which the British press would love to accuse me of. I walked her in there. She peed, and then I peed.” Exciting! What else did the Fall Out Boy front man do to celebrate his big day?\n\n“I woke up. I walked my dog on the grass near the [tour] bus at Jones Beach. I did TRL, went back to Jones Beach. Ate catered food. Played a concert. Got cake smashed in my face. Jumped in the ocean, which was awesome.” He also snagged some cool birthday gifts. He asked for an antique typewriter; he got two, both circa 1930, from his managers at Crush and his guitarist, Joe Trohman. He got a set of Michael Jackson videos. (Wentz is obsessed with the King of Pop, comparing Jackson to the Beatles and declaring “Beat It” the greatest song ever written.) Ashlee gave him a poster for “Revenge of the Jedi” — it’s the film’s original title, he said — and a proper shoulder bag, though she might have an ulterior motive for that one. “I’m just her purse,” he laughed, pulling something from his pocket. “Look, I have her credit card.” —Jada Yuan"
