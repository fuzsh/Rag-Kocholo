        "text": "wentz was born Peter Lewis Kingston Wentz III in Wilmette Illonsis a suburn of Chicago Illonsis. He is the son of Dale a high school admission counsellor and Pete Wentz II an attorney. He is of english and german descent on his fathers side and afro-jamican on his mothers. He has a younger sister Hilary and a younger brother Andrew. His black maternal grandfather Arthur Winston Lewis served as a US ambassador to Sierra Leone. Wentz parents met while campaing for now vice president Joe Biden in the 1970s. Wentz recalled in a rolling stone interview that his earlist musical memory was listening to the\n\nThe Foundations‘ song “Build Me Up Buttercup” in the back of his father’s car.[14] Wentz attended New Trier High School and North Shore Country Day School, where he was an all-state soccer player.[13][15] He considered pursuing a professional career in the sport, but decided that music was a more fulfilling choice; he says that he “always had a magical connection to the ball. But it didn’t feel like an adventure. Music was more of a challenge and, in the end, felt more interesting.”[16]\n\nDuring his freshman year of high school, he began skipping school regularly, and a school counselor convinced his parents to send him to boot camp to straighten him out. During this time, Wentz began writing songs as a way to vent his frustrations.He began taking piano lessons afterwards, and adopted a straight edge lifestyle.[17However, he now drinks occasionally.After graduating from high school in 1997, he attended DePaul University where he studiedpolitical science, dropping out one quarter shy of graduation to focus on his music career.\n\nwentz has bipolar disorder, and has taken medication and has taken medication for it since he was eighteen. In feburary 2005, Wentz attempted sucicide by taking a overdose of the anxiety medication Ativan, and as a result, spent a week in hospital.\n\nThe suicide attempt was put into song form, “7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen)” and released on their album, From Under The Cork Tree. After this event, Wentz moved back in with his parents.[43] Wentz later spoke of his suicide attempt to the support site Halfofus.com and cites Jeff Buckley‘s version of the Leonard Cohen classic “Hallelujah”as a song that saved his life.[44]\n\nIn April 2008, Wentz became engaged to Ashlee Simpson.[45] They married[46]at Simpson’s parents’ residence in Encino, California, where her father officiated the ceremony. Two weeks later, she confirmed her pregnancy. Her surname changed from Simpson to Wentz and she was briefly known professionally as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz.[47] Simpson gave birth to their first child, Bronx Mowgli Wentz, on November 20, 2008.[48] Wentz said the reason behind the name Bronx “comes back to a very specific story between me and my wife. But I would just like to say that it wasn’t because either of us were trying to give our son street cred. At the end of the day, we like the name.Brooklyn gets a lot of love. It’s time for the Bronx to get a little bit of love too.”[49]\n\nOn February 8, 2011, Simpson filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences“. She asked for joint custody and primary physical custody of their son, Bronx, along with spousal support.[50][51][52][53] However, a later report said that Simpson believed the couple simply “married too young”, with the source stating that, “It was honestly a classic case of marrying young, having a kid young and growing apart over the years”.[54] Wentz reportedly did not want the divorce.[55]\n\nOn February 17, 2014, Wentz and his current girlfriend Meagan Camper announced that the couple were expecting their first and Wentz’s second child together.[56] Their son, Saint Laszlo, was born on August 21, 2014.[57]\n\nPhilanthropy and activism\n\nWentz is a supporter of Invisible Children, Inc., an organization dedicated to helping the cause of displaced refugees inUganda. He and Fall Out Boy traveled to the nation, and filmed the music video for the song “I’m Like a Lawyer… (Me & You)” there, which featured a love story between child soldiers. He explained that when he discovered the struggle of the children in Uganda, he “felt sad and I realized that I hadn’t felt sad for something outside of myself or one of my friends in a really long time.”[58] Prior to the trip, he participated in an event organized by Invisible Children called “Displace Me”, in which 67,000 activists throughout the United States slept in the streets in makeshift cardboard villages, hoping to raise awareness about those displaced by the Ugandan government. Wentz said of the experience, “I don’t feel like we got anywhere near what it’s actually like, but it was an attempt at empathy. So we got the shots [necessary to travel to] Africa, and we’re going to go to Uganda in July. I’m pretty excited, but also a little nervous. I feel like I won’t really understand it until I go there, and I think that there’s no other chance for me to do that.”[59]\n\nWentz was also an outspoken critic of California’s Proposition 8, and attended many anti-Prop 8 rallies.[60] He believes that voters were “tricked into” voting for the proposition. In a statement, he said, “Many people were intimidated on this issue due to the scary misleading communications on the other side. I believe that this is, and has always been, a civil rights issue. We should not allow inequality like this in America.”[61] He was also vocal in his support of Barack Obamain the 2008 Presidential Election, designing a shirt promoting Obama’s campaign through his clothing line, Clandestine Industries.[13]\n\nAlong with Mary J. Blige and Billy Corgan, Wentz is a spokesperson for The Jed Foundation‘s Half of Us campaign, a program aimed at lowering the rate of teenage suicide.[62]\n\nWentz is a vegetarian, and appeared on the ballot of Peta2‘s third annual “Sexiest Vegetarian” awards.[63]\n\nim a blogger who chooses to write about conspiracy theories. conspiracy theories are what helps keep people like me entertained. There are many great ones like, the death of Marilyn Monroe a iconic movie star, who died in her bed holding her telephone. That is the first conspiracy theory i will speak about on my blog.\n\nThe death of Marilyn Monroe\n\nthe event- On august 5th 1962 the naked body of Marilyn Monroe was found on her bed. It was assumed she had taken her life in the fit of her depression.\n\nthe conspiracy theories-devasted by tangled affairs with US president John F Kennedy and his brother, Bobby, the 36 year old star of some like it hot was said to have overdosed on sleeping pills. But did she take them herself? people say that she overdosed or was drugged and died. despite the large amount of drugs in her bloodstream, there was no trace of drugs in her digestive system which means that she didn’t take them orally. There is no evidence in the post-morten report that the drugs in Marilyn’s body had been injected. the pathologist reveled, he didn’t find needle marks or associated bruising. Which leads to this being a major conspiracy theory because these two factors mean that, she didn’t inject drugs or she was injured before she died. But policemen called to the scene to the scene believed she had been deliberately been placed down in a face-down postion after her death. There was also one suggestion that the drug had been adminstrated by a way of suppository. If this was the was the route they entered the body it clearly was a accident. The mafia had a tradition of anally adminstreted ‘hits’ in the 1950 and 1960s and even employed a phramcist who speilized in preparing the neccesary items.Also Mariyn who’s real name was Norma Jean Baker, was said to be in deep with the mob. They had used strong-arm tatics to get the star her first hollywood contract in 1947. In return the mafia wanted her to seduce powerful men that wanted to blackmail, So was John F Kennedy involved with the mafia, and they mafia wanted to blackmail him by using Marilyn. Buts it said Marilyn threatened to reveal about all their operations- so did they shut her up permantely? Or was it in fact the US goverment?\n\nMarilyn had fallen in love with the young president but when she was told there was no chance of a relationship, she started telling friends she wanted to reveal everything. Not only might she reveal a affair, but she might also have knowledge of JFK other private affairs- and both brothers are said to have indreestly discussed matters of national security with her.\n\ncrackpot or credible- Marilyn was battling drink, drugs and depression, so she could have certianly felt sucidal that night, But many fans thought it hard to believe such a vibrant star could die in such a sad matter. And no doubt that fuelled the frenzied search for a more sinister explanation."
