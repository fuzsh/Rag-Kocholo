        "text": "This article will explore what Pete Wentz spoke out recently about his past relationship with Ashlee Simpson and his reason for the break of Fall Out Boy.\n\nRockstar Opens up on his divorce and Fall Out Boy break\n\nPete Wentz has opened up about his divorce from singer, Ashlee Simpson, in a recent interview with Nylon. Wentz reflects on the breakdown of their relationship in 2010 when they were raising their now 14-year-old son, Bronx, who was a toddler at the time. Wentz revealed that he was always travelling with his band and dealing with the burden of his burgeoning reputation, which caused him to become stunted in certain respects.\n\n“My life was just like… a bomb had gone off in it,”\n\nHowever, his separation from Simpson forced the rock star to mature and served as a reality check. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Wentz hit a rough patch, but he has since embarked on a voyage of self-reflection. He attempted ketamine therapy, baking and ceramics, reading 52 books in 52 weeks, and performing stand-up comedy at a local comedy club’s open-mic night. Wentz had disclosed that he had battled depression prior to Simpson filing for divorce.\n\nMore on Pete’s interview with Nylon\n\nIn his interview with Nylon, Pete Wentz delved into Fall Out Boy’s newest album, “So Much for Stardust,” and the band’s evolution over time. He stated that the album deviates from their previous works and includes a more diverse and experimental sound.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also affected the band, forcing them to cancel their tour and live shows. Wentz stressed the significance of prioritizing mental health, and he shared how he and his bandmates have been handling these difficult and uncertain times.\n\nFurthermore, Wentz reflected on Fall Out Boy’s impact and legacy in the music industry. Despite facing backlash and controversy throughout their career, he expressed pride in their work and appreciation for their fans.\n\nOverall, the interview gave valuable insights into Fall Out Boy’s creative process and their experiences dealing with personal and professional challenges.\n\nPete’s Early Life\n\nPeter Lewis Kingston Wentz III was born in Wilmette, a well-to-do suburb of Chicago. His parents, Dale and Pete Wentz II worked as high school admissions counselor and an attorney, respectively. Wentz’s ancestry includes English, German, and Afro-Jamaican roots. He has a younger sister named Hillary and a younger brother named Andrew. Wentz’s maternal grandfather, Arthur Winston Lewis, served as the US Ambassador to Sierra Leone, and his cousin was General Colin Powell.\n\nWentz’s parents met in the 1970s while supporting Joe Biden’s senatorial campaign. In a Rolling Stone interview, Wentz shared that his earliest musical memory was listening to “Build Me Up Buttercup” by The Foundations in his father’s car. Wentz attended North Shore Country Day School, where he was an accomplished soccer player. Although he initially considered pursuing a career in sports, he found music more rewarding and challenging.\n\nIn his first year of high school, Wentz started skipping classes and smoking marijuana with friends. However, he stopped when he realized it was negatively impacting his grades. After completing high school in 1997, he enrolled in DePaul University, where he studied political science. However, he left just one-quarter shy of graduation to focus on his music career with Fall Out Boy.\n\nPete Wentz Musical Journey\n\nPete is best known as the bassist and lyricist for the band Fall Out Boy. Before Fall Out Boy, Wentz was involved in the Chicago hardcore punk scene, playing in several bands such as First Born, Racetraitor, Novena, Arma Angelus, Birthright, Extinction, and Yellow Road Priest.\n\nLater in 2001, he founded Fall Out Boy with Joe Trohman, and the band released their first EP, Fall Out Boy/Project Rocket Split EP in 2002. They released their first full-length album, Take This to Your Grave, in 2003 and signed with major label Island Records. Their second album, From Under the Cork Tree, was released in 2005 and marked their mainstream breakthrough. Fall Out Boy’s third album, Infinity on High, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2007, followed by Folie à Deux in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, the band went on an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in 2013 with the release of their album, Save Rock and Roll, and toured extensively. Wentz is also a solo artist, and he has produced albums for several bands, including The Academy Is…, Panic! at the Disco, and Gym Class Heroes.\n\nApart from his musical career, he has written a book called The Boy with the Thorn in His Side, which was inspired by his childhood nightmares. He explained that writing books allows him to express himself beyond music. He was also working on a book called Rainy Day Kids, but its progress was uncertain for some time until he announced its completion and revealed the cover, under the new title Gray, in December 2012. Wentz also worked on a comic book mini-series called Fall Out Toy Works, based on the band’s song “Tiffany Blews,” with the first issue released in September 2009.\n\nMore entertainment news:"
