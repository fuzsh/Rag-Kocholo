        "text": "Post by tmc1982 on\n\nI haven't really listened to a lot of Howard Stern since he moved over to satellite, but there's this site that maintains daily transcripts from his show:\n\nwww.marksfriggin.com/news08/12-15.htm#tue\n\nFall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Visits. 12/16/08. 8:30am\n\nAfter the break Howard came back and said that he sees Pete Wentz in the paper all the time when they talk about Ashlee Simpson. He said that he cares more about Ashlee than he does about Jessica. Howard said that he's always had a thing for Ashlee. Pete came in and said he has too.\n\nHoward said Pete seems to be very busy because he's always being photographed doing something. Pete said that the photographers can get dangerous and weird.\n\nPete said they'll go an hour out of their way to try and avoid being filmed. He said that they live on a private street and the photographers pose as pizza guys and stuff like that. Howard asked what it is that makes them want to photograph them so much. Pete said he's like a purse to his wife than anything. He said that he understands why they're fascinated with his wife though.\n\nPete plays bass in the band Fall Out Boy so Howard asked him how he got into that stuff. Pete said he started out early and he was diagnosed with ADD and he was also bipolar. He said that he was sent to boot camp after a therapist suggested it. He said that experience was pretty messed up because he was just a goofy kid and he was in there with kids who were like Michael Myers from ''Halloween.''\n\nHoward said that it seems like your parents don't like you when they send you off to a camp like that. Pete said that they're okay now. He said that he probably was the problem. Pete said he might have a strange brain chemistry and he used to mess around with drugs to try and fix himself and that's not the right thing to do.\n\nHoward asked Pete about how he almost killed himself one time when he and a fried played Russian Roulette. Pete said he didn't even know why he did it. He said he was on Ambien and he as hanging out with bad people so he's not sure what he was thinking. He was around 23 or 24 around that time.\n\nHoward asked Pete who went first. Pete said that he was the first one and his friend went next. He wasn't even sure if the gun was actually loaded. He also said that at the time he didn't care what his family thought and what happened if he had shot himself. Now he's much better and doesn't think that way.\n\nHoward asked Pete what it was like pulling the trigger. Pete said that it's like the minute before you bungee jump or go out on stage in front of 10,000 people. Pete said that he was afraid to fly back then but he wasn't afraid to put a gun to his head.\n\nRobin asked Pete what changed his life. Pete said that he found a great girl that changed his life. Howard asked Pete about the band Fall Out Boy and what he does in there. Pete said that he actually writes most of the songs. Howard said that the bass players usually don't do anything in the band when they're on stage. Pete does move around on stage though so Howard pointed that out. Yesterday they were talking about bass players just standing around doing nothing.\n\nHoward asked Pete when he started to get famous. Pete said he was 22 or 23. Howard said he was dating some really hot chicks back then and mentioned one from Buffy the Vampire slayer. Howard asked if he only dated famous chicks. Pete said that he dated regular girls too. Howard asked if he's into dudes too because he has admitted to having kissed guys before. Pete said that was more of a way of freaking people out.\n\nPete said that he wanted to keep the numbers low with the girls he slept with so he didn't bang every girl he possibly could. Howard asked if Ashlee's dad gives him a hard time. He said that Joe gets more bad press than even he does.\n\nHoward asked Pete how he met Michelle Trachtenberg and if she's a 10 on a scale of 10. Pete said that he can't go there with that. He said his wife will kill him if he goes there. Pete said that he ended up getting dumped because he wasn't the greatest boyfriend.\n\nHoward said that Pete also had Lindsay Lohan so he asked him about her. Pete said that felt like they didn't even really date. Pete said that he was so deep into Ambien that he doesn't think there was any connection there but it may have happened. Howard said that a girl like Lindsay is attractive to him because she's kind of crazy. He said that he'd wake up from the Ambien to be with that. Robin said it seems that she'd work hard in bed too.\n\nPete said that Lindsay seems to be happy now that she's with the person she's with now. He said that she was probably made for that.\n\nHoward said that Pete met Ashlee Simpson after that. Pete said that he was asked in an interview who he would like to meet and he said it was Ashlee. He said that he met her at a party after that and hung out. He said nothing happened but they stayed friends for like a year. He said that she went and did a show in London and when she came back they started going out. He said that he was into her pre-nose job and he thought she was beautiful either way.\n\nHoward said that Pete is kind of wild and Ashlee's dad must really hate that. Pete said that he's really a good guy and he just gets a bad rap in the paper. Pete said that Joe once said to him that they had seen too much of him on the internet that year but they had a good laugh over it. Pete said that Ashlee's mom is the one who helps out a lot too and keeps things under control.\n\nHoward asked how Ashlee is doing after the baby and if she's snapping back. Pete said she is snapping back and he thinks that the breast feeding thing is what helps out with that. The baby is only 2 weeks old so they're not back to having sex yet. Howard said that Ashlee isn't ready for that.\n\nPete said that he saw the baby being born and it was pretty frightening. He said that he was in love as soon as the baby came out. He said that he didn't know what to expect when the baby was born. He tried to prepare himself for it by watching the Discovery Channel. Pete said that when the baby was born he just wanted to hold the baby. He said that it's very cliché to say that it changes you but it's very true.\n\nHoward told Pete that he has to turn Ashlee around and turn her into that sexual object again. Pete said that they have such a sexual chemistry and he figured that if they had done this show a year ago, they would have been having sex in the green room. Howard said that things are going to change now that she's had a baby. Pete said ''We'll see.''\n\nHoward asked about Jessica Simpson and if she ever comes around dressed in sexy outfits. Pete said that she really doesn't do that. Howard asked Pete if he's ever thought about being with both Jessica and Ashlee. Pete said that he's always been an Ashlee guy.\n\nHoward said there's something about his wife that does it for him. Pete said he's the same way. He said that he used to whack off to her pictures on the cover of Blender magazine. He said that Ashlee loves that he used to whack off to those pictures. Pete said that he's actually beat off in front of Ashlee. He said he knows his publicist is going to kill him for saying that though.\n\nHoward asked how long it took him to get into Ashlee's pants. Pete said that it took a long time. He said that when they finally did it, it was the greatest sexual encounter of his life. He said that he was in a hotel with a mirror that let him watch himself banging the girls of his dreams.\n\nHoward asked about the name they gave the kid. It's Bronx Mowgli. Pete said that they liked the name Bronx. Howard said he kind of likes that name too.\n\nJoey Boots called in and said that he beats off to Pete. He said that Pete is really hot. Joey asked him to take his shirt off for the Howard TV cameras but Pete said he can't do that. His wife would kill him. Pete said he's also gained about 10 pounds since his wife got pregnant.\n\nHoward said that Ashlee is really hot and she waved to him once so he figured that he might be able to get her. Pete said that Ashlee was worried that he was going to say something nasty about her on the show but he told her that he thought Howard liked her and wouldn't say anything bad.\n\nHoward took some more calls and one guy said he just bought the new Fall Out Boy album, ''Folie A Deux,'' this morning. They spent a minute talking about that and also about who is bringing in the money between Pete and Ashlee. Pete said he's not sure about that.\n\nHoward asked Pete if he's ever discussed a threesome with his wife. Pete said he's never done that. He said that it would be the beginning of the downhill of their relationship if they did it. Howard asked if she dresses up for him. Pete said that she will give him lap dances and she gives a mean lap dance. Howard said that's a good girl he's got.\n\nHoward asked Pete how much he spent on the wedding ring for Ashlee. He didn't say but Howard guessed it was about $150,000 and Pete said he was in the right neighborhood. Howard said he hopes that she appreciates that. Howard said that's why he got a tattoo on his finger for Beth instead of getting a ring. That was much cheaper.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who asked about the story about them trying to get money for pictures of their baby and they were turned down. Pete said that he doesn't want their kid to be a commodity to them. He said that the stories about them going out and trying to get money for the pictures are false.\n\nAnother caller said that he always thought this guy was a fruity guy but after today he doesn't believe that. The caller asked Pete if he's ever given it to his wife in the bad place. Pete said that his wife does like him to have a good time so that's all he's going to say. The caller said that Pete is his hero. Pete said she really is a good girl. The caller said that this is one of the best guests they've had on the show in a while.\n\nHoward said that Pete was there to promote this new album ''Folie A Deux.'' Howard said that the new single is ''America's Sweethearts'' and he was going to play some of that. Howard asked Pete about doing a song with John Mayer and what's going on with him and Jennifer Aniston. Pete said he doesn't know about that but John Mayer is a great guy to be around and they should have him on the show.\n\nGary came in and said that he asked John to come on the show and he said he's a fan but there's no way he's coming on. Gary said that John wrote a letter about Pete and it sounds like he's in love with him. Howard heard that Pete was kind of in love with the guy too. Pete said that John is one of those guys that you know is going to end up in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame one day and he's really just a cool guy. Howard said he can't imagine that he's having fun dating Jennifer Aniston. Pete said he's never met her so he wouldn't know.\n\nHoward played some of the new album and said that it must be cool to be a bass player in a band like that. He then played some of Fall Out Boy's hit songs to remind people of what they've done. Howard played the new single ''America's Sweethearts'' after that. They talked about the music business while they were playing that stuff.\n\nHoward took a call from a woman who said that she thought it was rockin' that Pete talked about his man crush stuff on the air like he did. She said that her husband used to do ecstasy and he used to do some stuff like that. Howard said that no matter how much ecstasy he takes there's no way he'd be kissing dudes. Howard thanked the woman for calling in but she told Howard to try kissing Pete. Howard said he's too tall for Pete. Artie told her to get back to her fag husband. She got a laugh out of that.\n\nHoward had to wrap up with Pete after that. He congratulated him on his new son and album and his marriage. Pete said he wants to come back sometime. Howard told him to come back. Howard asked him if he saw the Penthouse Pets that were there. Pete said he did get a peek at them even though they closed the door when he showed up. Howard went to break a short time later."
