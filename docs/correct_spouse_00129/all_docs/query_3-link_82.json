Swartz, the above information may actually belong with his son, Johann Jacob (2) Hill, rather than with Johann Jacob (4) Hill. Glen wrote to me on 12/3/09:\n\nI believe the following is the correct information for the tract that belonged to Jacob Hill (1679-1739):\n\n1734 May 7, Philadelphia Co, PA, survey warrant no.18, to Jacob Hill for 200 acres. 1734 Sep 15, survey (C97-80) for a tract of land described as situate in Maxetawny Twp, Philadelphia Co, PA, adjacent the land of Peter Went, containing 200 acres. Undated Survey (C97-81), [but obviously aft. 1751] for Jacob Hill, described as situate in Maxatawny, Berks Co, PA, adjacent Peter Wentz and Michael Road. 1809 Aug 7, patent (H1-339) to John Jacob Hill for the \"Hillsborough,\" tract, Berks Co, PA, per warrant dated 7 May 1734.\n\nSurvey 80 refers inaccurately to a warrant dated 3 Sep 1734, while survey 81 refers to the correct warrant and was apparently made for his son. The patentee, I'm guessing was his grandson.\n\nThe following tract of land in Philadelphia County was, I believe, for his son Jacob (1716-1775).\n\n1738 Mar 27, Philadelphia Co, PA, survey warrant no.72, to Jacob Hill for 200 acres. 25 Apr 1739, survey (C67-232), described as situate on a branch of Maiden Creek, Phila.

These land purchases - which Hills do they go with.\n\n2. If and when the Hills moved from Maxatawny Twp to Windsor Twp.\n\n3. Did the same Hill family own land in Maxatawny and Windsor Twp. at the same time.\n\n4. Were there 2 Jacob Hill families or 1. LKB 5/2011\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nAlso from Glen A. Swartz - 2/25/10\n\nTrivia on some research I did a while back. In the 1700's Lambsheim, District of Frankenthal was then part of the Kurpfalz (Electoral Palatinate), now part of Rheinland-Pfalz. Bavaria/Bayern only had control of the area from 1777 to 1803. I ran this down after finding one of Rev. Casper Stover's obituaries and his statement the individual was from the Kurpfalz.\n\nI found an interesting the gap I have in my records between 1719 when I believe both the Merckel and Hill families immigrated together and 07 May 1734, when Christian Merckel (no.44) and Jacob Hill (no.18) took out land warrants in Philadelphia County. Looking at the surveys these properties are only a few miles apart and both were members of the Moselem Lutheran Church. From my research it appears a single man was typically indentured about 5-7 years to pay for his passage if he did not have the means. At this point I'm beginning to think both the Merckel and Hill families may have been indentured for about 14 years. That would explain the absence of records and if they immigrated on the same ship this would also explain a release from indenture on the same day, and why they took out warrants on the same day.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLetters of Administration 9 Aug 1739 Philadelphia County, PA785\n\nNotes from estate records for Jacob.

Before their good resolutions had been carried to completion the two latter died, but the former carried on his good work until success crowned his efforts.” 813 (Note - first church was a small, apparently damp, log structure, not the 8-sided church that is pictured in the multimedia page with Johann Jacob (2) Hill, which was erected in 1761. Johann Jacob (2) Hill may have been the founder mentioned above, as his father, Johann Jacob (4) may have been deceased by 1742.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nPer Richard Hill:\n\nSettled as farmer in 1728 in Maxatawney Valley near site of Kutztown.\n\n1734 - Inhabitant of Maxatawney Valley, Philadelphia County, PA.\n\n1734 - Land Warrant - Maxatawney Valley, Philadelphia County (200 acres on 7 May)\n\n1735 - Witness with wife for Abraham Zimmerman, 27 July 1735 in Maxatawney Valley.\n\n9 August 1739 - Letters of Administrationtaken by Elizabeth Mueller Hill (Philadelphia County, Book D, P. 93).

LKB\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nResearch regarding Hill family cemetery -\n\nIn \"Hill Family: The Ancestors (Germany) of the Hill Family of Berks County.\"Rudolph Hommel. 1948. HSBC GA-H645A (typed manuscript)and GA-H645, I found the following information:\n\nAccording to Hill family history, John Frederick Hill married Maria Hottenstein, the widow of Jacob Hottenstein and a daughter of Jacob LeVan. They had 2 children: George 1766- and John Frederick 1772-. John Sr. served in the Revolutionary War. John Frederick Hill Jr. married Catherine Conner. They moved to Fort Jenkins on the Susquehanna. Maria died in the ancestral home of the Hills in Richmond Township, but formerly the Hottenstein farm. (Broken gravestones found in November 1939 indicated a private cemetery on this farm.) Dr. Rudolf Hommel and Mrs. Elda Hill Miller, then owners of the farm, found a stone with this epitaph: Hottenstein Jacob 1728-1756\n\nAccording to the Richmond Township cemetery map supplied by the Berks County Association for Graveyard Preservation - http://bcagp.berkshistory.org - the Hill cemetery #6 (see multimedia) is located on Kempsville Road, just above Eagle Road, address is 234 Kempsville Road, Richmond Township.\n\nAs I discovered, the cemetery site is about .1 mile north of Eagle Road. The site is now in the front lawn of a white ranch home. There is a small rectangular depression consistent with a disturbed area. No actual cemetery remains. There is the remains of a water pump, probably from the old well, on the front lawn. The front lawn, water pump and the “cemetery” were most likely at the rear of the original homestead.\n\nAlso, according to the BCAGP:\n\nAnna Maria Levan, born 1732, daughter of Jacob Levan Sr., Married Jacob Hottenstein, 4/13/1750. According to the will (1766) of Dorothea (Reber) Hottenstein, Jacob's mother, she mentions her son Jacob, \"deceased\".\n\nChildren of Anna & Jacob Hottenstein;\n\n1/ Catherine, born, 1/24/1751, married Abraham Biehl\n\n2/ Blandina, married, Casper Merkel\n\n3/ Susanna, born 4/4/1757, married Samuel Ely\n\n4/ Mary, married, Abraham Deysher\n\nSecond marriage; to Frederick Hill, Frederick died July, 1794\n\nChildren of Anna & Frederick Hill;\n\n1/ Jacob, says, (born Hill) my observation is, he may have been a Jacob Hottenstein left over, gives no birth date.\n\n2/ Frederick, married Catherine Conner\n\nFrederic Hill, b; 3/8/1772, d; 8/21/1823, Married Catherine Conner. Both buried on the old homestead cemetery, later removed to Lime Ridge Cemetery. Commissioned Captain of the 6th Company, 112th Regiment, Penna. Militia August 3, 1807 by Gov. Thomas McKean, and served in that rank in the in the War of 1812. He and his wife came to Columbia County from Berks County and passed their years there.\n\n(see Johann Friedrich Hill)\n\nFrom dowsing done in October, 2008 by the BCAGP, there is an indication that there are at least 9 graves there. I am not sure if this counts the 2 who were removed, but I would assume so.\n\nMarriage 8 Jan 1709, Heuchelheim, Frankenthal, Pfalz, Bayern, Germany802,785\n\nSpouse Anna Elisabeth Mueller 785,803 Birth 11 Feb 1691, Winningen, Pfaltz, Bayern, Germany814 Death abt 1774, Windsor Township, Berks County, PA, United States785 Age: 82 Burial Zion (Moselem) Church, Richmond Township, Berks County, PA, United States800 Confirmation 1706, Heuchelheim, Frankenthal, Pfalz, Bayern, Germany785 Age: 14 Father Johannes Mueller (~1655-) Mother Anna Catherina Mertz (~1660-)\n\nMisc.

Many of these people settled in Muncy Valley before the beginning of the Revolution. Most of them came from Berks County. The names mentioned first in the records of the Church are the Hills and the Gortners. Daniel migrated in 1789 to Westmoreland County, PA.\n\n---------------------------\n\nMay have been the owner of the Windsor Castle Hotel/Tavern, located at the intersections of Zions Church Road, Haas Road, and Windsor Castle Road, at the main intersection of Windsor Castle, Berks County, Pa. The tavern was located ACROSS from the Windsor Castle Hotel/Tavern, built about 1909, which is currently being used as an apartment building. The old tavern burnt to the ground a goodly number of years earlier. A grey/green two family house is now on that site. This information came from the current apartment caretaker, August 2011. LKB\n\nRudolph Hommel description:\n\n\"The buildings are much over a hundred years old and the present proprietor has taken great pains and pride in maintaining an air of the simplicity that surrounded it in days of \"Auld lang Syne.\" The parlor is furnished with an old style ten plate stove, a grandfather clock and a grandmother spinning wheel, old style carpet, but all arranged with the air of tidiness that at once commanded our admiration.\"816\n\nThe above description may originally appeared in “The Hill Family,” A Sketch of the Maxatawny Valley Family of Hill. by C.F. Hill, Hazelton, Pa. 1887817 Also in “Report of the First Annual Meeting of the Hill Family Association Held at Sunbury, Penna, on the 23rd of June, 1887.”818\n\n------------------------------\n\nPer Richard Hill:\n\nBorn in Maxatawney and established adult residence at Windsor Castle, Windsor Township, Berks County. Resided there, raising family of thirteen with his first wife Catherina and starting a second family of 12 children with second wife Barbara. About 1783 he moved to South Huntington Township, Westmoreland County.\n\nNumerous documents including two histories of Lycombing County, Pennsylvania indicate that John Daniel Hill (father of Jacob Hill of Muncy Creek, Lycombing County) died in 1814, Westmoreland County. This is most likely incorrect. Daniel Hill's will was proven 20 August 1794, but provided that no disposition occur during the life of his second wife Barbara. Barbara appears to have died in 1814 at which time Jacob Hill, oldest son by Daniel's first wife (Catharina), initiated action to settle the estate. Jacob's son, referred to as Daniel Hill Jr. in court documents, handled most of the legal matters. The 1798 Westmoreland County Tax Record does not record Daniel Hill, Sr., suggesting that he may have passed on by that time. It appears that source(s) of information for county histories may have misunderstood or did not have complete information regarding settlement of Daniel Hill's Estate, confusing estate settlement with general time of death. Daniel was not found on the Westmoreland County 1798 Tax List, but Barbara was, showing ownership of 5 parcels.\n\nAll grant, property, will, probate and administrative records associated with Daniel Hill Sr. are from Berks, Westmoreland, Lycoming and Northumberland Counties, PA, and were obtained through the Family History Library, Salt Lake City, Ut ah.\n\nWill was prepared 2 July 1794 and recorded 20 August 1794. Copy in Richard Hill's Family records. Daughter Barbara Hill Kline not mentioned, but received estate settlement in 1814.\n\nProperty Transactions, Taxes and Other Records:\n\nEarly settler in Windsor Township, Berks County and owner of an Inn named Windsor Castle which was still used as a hote l property in 1887.\n\nTrinity Sunday 1746 - Moselem Lutheran Church, Richmond Township, Berks County.\n\nGeneral Data Relating to Germany Settlers of Pennsylvania (974.831 PA) indicates on page 15 that Daniel Hill was residing the Schuylkill and \"Lane Creek\" on 16 October 1749.\n\n1754 - Tax List, Windsor Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania.\n\n1759 - Tax List, Windsor Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania\n\n1766 - Land Warrant 11 Nov 1766 for 50 acres in Windsor Township\n\n1767 - Tax List, Windsor Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania\n\n1767 - Purchased 225 acres near mountains in Windsor Township, Berks County from Robert Jones and Elizabeth for 45 Poun ds on 17 February 1767.
