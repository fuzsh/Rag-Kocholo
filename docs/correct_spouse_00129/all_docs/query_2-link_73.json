        "text": "It’s too soon to tell what kind of year 2023 is going to be like for El Paso, but if you’re a fan of stand-up comedy the outlook is looking pretty funny.\n\nAmong the comics bringing big laughs to the Sun City in the coming weeks and months is El Paso favorite Felipe Esparza, and Anjelah Johnson-Reyes.\n\nAnjelah Johnson-Reyes Saturday, January 21, 2023 - Abraham Chavez Theatre\n\nBon Qui Qui herself, y'all.\n\nWho Do I Think I Am? is Anjelah Johnson-Reyes' new hour of standup. It' s named after her new memoir, Who Do I Think I Am: Stories of Chola Wishes and Caviar Dreams, but it really doesn't have anything to do with the book.\n\nFrom what I've read, it's mostly about how she and things have changed over the last couple of years, post Covid. And although Anjelah has retired Bon Qui Qui, you will be treated to Nail Salon nail tech \"Tammy\" at the end of the show. [Tickets]\n\nFelipe Esparza Friday, March 10, 2023 - Plaza Theatre\n\nKnown for his wild hair and the catchphrase ‘What’s up, fool?’, Felipe is heading our way again almost a year to the day he last entertained the Sun City.\n\nNewly married, and with fresh material and new stories, Felipe’s latest standup is titled The BigFoo Tour -- presumably because of his catchphrase, and because in just the right evening light he could pass for a Sasquatch? Well, the catchphrase thing for sure. [Tickets]\n\nAlso bringing the giggles, guffaws, and ha-ha's to El Paso in the first quarter of 2023:\n\nJoe Gatto's Night of Comedy\n\nSunday, January 22 - Abraham Chavez Theatre [Tickets]\n\nFortune Feimster\n\nSaturday, January 28 - UTEP Magoffin Auditorium [Tickets]\n\nJohn Crist\n\nSaturday, March 11 - Plaza Theatre [Tickets]\n\nCelebrity Couples Whose Breakups Broke Our Hearts"
