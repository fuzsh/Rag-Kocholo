        "text": "• It looks like Tiger Woods' wife has had enough. Elin Nordegren moved out of the couple's Florida home yesterday and is staying at another home nearby. It doesn't look like she's planning to come back. Swedish news outlets are reporting that she paid $2.3 million to buy a house in in Sweden last week. [ Radar, NYDN, NYP]\n\n• Another 911 call was received from Tiger Woods' house last night. It's still unclear what happened, but an ambulance transported a middle-aged woman to the hospital and a \"blonde woman\" reportedly followed behind in an Escalade. One possibility is that it was Elin Nordegren's mom, who flew to the U.S. last week to be with her daughter. [ TMZ, Radar]\n\n• Yet another Woods mistress may be getting ready to come forward. And this one's claiming she has cell phone photos of Tiger's nether regions. Playgirl says it's is in the process of \"authenticating\" the pics to make sure it's him. How it plans to do that is unclear, although there are nine women (and counting) who should be able to help, presumably. [ Us]\n\n• Uma Thurman and fiancé Arki Busson have called it quits. And Bernie Madoff may be partly to blame. The Swiss financier reportedly lost a bundle investing with Madoff, and that may have put a strain on the relationship. [ NYP]\n\n• Mariah Carey must be determined to earn back the title of \"world's most demanding diva.\" For an appearance at a London shopping shopping center to kick off the holiday season, she asked for 20 white kittens, 100 white doves, and confetti shaped like butterflies. She also requested a Rolls-Royce, pink carpet, pink podium, and a security staff of 80 to protect her entourage of 15. Then again all she asked for in her dressing room were a few bottles of water, so it isn't as if she's totally out of control, is it? [ NYDN, DM]\n\n• Jude Law made the unfortunate decision to move into a building next to an NYU dorm and he hasn't been too happy about the students who invariably look down on him as he plays with his kids or works out with his trainer. When Law recently noticed students waving at him from across the way, he responded by pelting their windows with oranges. That'll do it! [ NYP]\n\n• Madonna is still saving the world. But she isn't taking any chances while she does it, clearly. She insisted on wearing a bullet-proof vest under her jacket while touring a \"lawless\" Rio de Janeiro favela recently. [ P6]\n\n• Lindsay Lohan's gig at Emanuel Ungaro may be coming to an end soon. The company's chairman reportedly wants her out since he, like the rest of the world, wasn't impressed with the \"cheesy and dated\" outfits she debuted at Paris Fashion Week, and many stores are refusing to carry the line. Ungaro CEO Mounir Moufarrige wants to keep her, though, to save face. [ P6]\n\n• Madonna is taking a quick trip over to Malawi this weekend \"to lay the foundation stone\" at the new \"multi-million dollar girls school she's building.\" That's funny. We could swear we heard about another celebrity doing almost exact same thing not too long ago. Oh, yes, her! Hopefully this time around there's a little less controversy. And let's also hope Malawian schoolchildren are ready to study Kabbalah from dawn till dusk. [ Reuters]\n\n• In related news, Madonna's ex, Alex Rodriguez, now appears to be taking an interest in Buddhism thanks to girlfriend Kate Hudson. Or at least he's pretending to be interested in it to make her happy. You decide! [ NYDN]\n\n• Ashlee Simpson-Wentz—sister of Jessica, wife of Pete, and the character Violet on The CW's Melrose Place—is now unemployed. Melrose's producers are taking a \"It's not you, it's me\" approach and saying the decision to cut her out of the show had nothing to do with the fact she can't act, but was because that had been their plan for the character from the beginning. [ EW, People]\n\n• Yesterday, Broadway actress Pia Glenn slammed Salman Rushdie, saying her ex-boyfriend was \"dysfunctional\" and was still obsessed with his ex-wife, Padma Lakshmi. Today, it's Rushdie's turn to hit back. Not has he \"long ago turned the page and moved on\" from Lakshmi, he says, he would also like you to know that Glenn is \"a large, radioactive bucket of stress,\" \"an accomplished liar,\" and also happens to be \"broke and unemployed.\" So we're guessing a reconciliation is totally out of the question here? [ P6]\n\n• Expect to see an angry video by Tricia Walsh-Smith posted to YouTube any minute now. A state appeals court rejected the rage-filled divorcée's motion to undo her pre-nup to theater mogul Philip Smith yesterday. [ P6]\n\n• A California teenager has been charged with burglarizing Lindsay Lohan and Audrina Patridge's homes and making off with $170,000. [ People, NYDN]\n\n• Is Ali Wise's PR career over now that four women have accused her of voicemail hacking? That's what the Post suggests today, with a source telling the paper that \"Wise is now radioactive in the industry.\" Then again, if there's anything we can learn from Lizzie Grubman's not-so-pretty past, it's that people who work in PR tend to be a very forgiving bunch. [ NYP]\n\n• One of Madonna's neighbors has filed a lawsuit against their building's co-op board for not doing anything about the \"pounding noise and vibration\" emanating from Madge's triplex, which the neighbor says has been doubling as a \"dance rehearsal studio.\" The good news is Madonna is moving in the near future, so the angry tenant should soon be able to go back to complaining about her other neighbor who just plays the radio too loud. [ NYDN, AP]\n\n• Lindsay Lohan avoided jail time but had her probation extended by a year last week when a judge ruled that she hadn't completed an alcohol treatment program. Then she went out to a party in the Meatpacking district this weekend and actually stayed sober. What a delightful surprise! [ P6]\n\n• Bethenny Frankel is engaged to her boyfriend of 11 months, Jason Hoppy. \"She is very much a handful,\" Hoppy said, \"She needs a man that can handle her, and that I can.\" More power to you, sir. [ People]\n\n• Heidi Klum and Seal have a new addition to the family: Lou Sulola, who was born on Friday night and joins siblings Johan, Henry, and Leni. [ People]\n\n• Tyra Banks ought to be in a good mood today. Not only has she dropped four dress sizes recently, she's been named the \"top-earning primetime TV star\" by Forbes thanks to the $30 million she's collected over the past year. [ Daily Mail, MSNBC]\n\n• The latest legal tiff between Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook is over: The couple has settled their dispute, which means neither of them will be heading off to jail. [ People]\n\n• Was Penelope Cruz sporting a giant sapphire and diamond ring the other night because she really is engaged to Javier Bardem? And did she wear a bulky sweater over her dress because she's pregnant? So many questions, so few answers. Sigh. [ P6, NYDN]\n\n• Despite several tabloid reports yesterday that Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel had broken up, they were photographed holding hands on Monday in Santa Barbara. So what's going on? \"Things have been rocky the last few months, but they're working it out,\" one source tells the Post. (\"They've been spending more time apart... and they've been reevaluating their relationship,\" another tells People.) Oh, and what about those Rihanna rumors? JT and Ri Ri are apparently just working on a track together. [ People, P6, NYDN]\n\n• Another dubious rumors making the rounds: that Kate Hudson and Alex Rodriguez are expecting a baby. Hudson's rep is denying it. [ NYDN]\n\n• Madonna told David Letterman that she'd \"rather get run over by a train\" than remarry again. Poor Jesus doesn't have a prayer, it seems. [ HP]\n\n• Lauren Conrad has snagged a movie deal for L.A. Candy, her debut novel about a totally unfamiliar topic, \"a 19-year-old who moves to Hollywood, quickly finds fame as a reality series star and then has to deal with the ramifications of living a fishbowl life.\" [ Variety]\n\n• Gossip Girl's Kelly Rutherford got a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband, Daniel Giersch, saying that he harassed both her and her nanny, which, to add insult to injury, caused her nanny to quit. [ TMZ, People]\n\n• Randy Quaid, the actor who played Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon's Vacation movies, may be more like his character than anyone thought. He was arrested near the Mexico border with his wife on charges that he bolted on a $10,000 hotel bill. The two have already posted bail, but not before hamming it up for their mug shots and scribbling a handwritten note to TMZ. Clark W. Griswold would be proud. [ AP, TMZ, P6]\n\n• She's been married to Keith Urban since June 2006, but Nicole Kidman is still known as \"the lady who used to be married to Tom Cruise\" by at least two Starbucks baristas, and she's not happy about it. [ P6]"
