        "text": "Ashlee Simpson appears to be completely over Peter Wentz.\n\nThe Bittersweet World singer, who filed for divorce earlier this year her former Fall Out Boy beau, has found some lips she really likes.And they belong to Boardwalk Empire actor Vincent Piazza. The two were spotted macking it up last week in New York City.\n\nPiazza, who stars as infamous gangster Lucky Luciano on the hit HBO drama, is currently in the Big Apple filming the show's second season. Here's what else you need to know about Simpson's new man:\n\n1. That's Italian! The 26-year-old hails from Queens, N.Y., and is of German-Italian descent. And if you weren't paying attention, his father is Sicilian like his mobster character, capisce?!\n\n2. Ice, Ice Baby: Piazza played Division 1 ice hockey for Villanova University before a shoulder injury forced him to quit after only a year.\n\n3. The Great White Way: Before making his film debut, Piazza appeared in a number of Broadway productions.\n\n4. Winning Season: Vincent has already won a SAG award as part of the Ensemble Cast in a Drama Series nomination this year for Boardwalk Empire, which also snagged a Golden Globe trophy for Best TV Series, Drama.\n\n5. Bada-Bing! He had a recurring/speaking role on the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.\n\nFor what it's worth, Simpson may have been tweeting about her new relationship back in May, musing on multiple occasions about love:\n\n\"This is the first day of my life. I'm glad I didn't die before I met you,\" Ashlee tweeted on May 17. \"The light of my life. I adore you : )\" she wrote two days prior. \"Love has concurred once more,\" she offered in another. \"(Me and You) we can make it through fire and back,\" Simpson posted on May 11.\n\nAhhh, young love.\n\nA rep for Piazza declined to comment on his personal life."
