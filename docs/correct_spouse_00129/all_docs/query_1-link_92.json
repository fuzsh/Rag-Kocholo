        "text": "Pete Wentz told MTV that not only is his new fiance Ashlee Simpson not pregnant, but that the tabloid reports that she is pregnant are like a witch hunt. He says they are engaged, but that all the other stuff is false:\n\nIn an e-mail to MTV News, Wentz denied reports that surfaced Monday (April 14) on the Web sites of OK! magazine and Us Weekly that he and Simpson, 23, are expecting their first child.\n\n“There is a witch hunt for people to be pregnant whenever they get engaged in Hollywood,” he wrote. “This is all news to me. I can’t wait for the story about how I’m really in a gay relationship and this is all just a cover. … I mean really, this is crazy. … I mean we’re engaged, that’s true, and happy about it.”\n\nAsked again if he was denying reports that Simpson is pregnant, Wentz, 28, replied, “Yeah.”\n\n[From MTV.com]\n\nMTV’s report on Pete’s denial reminds us that both US Weekly and OK! Magazine used “unnamed sources” for their stories, with such scant evidence as Ashlee’s possible morning sickness out at lunch and insider reports that she’s “asking everyone, ‘Am I showing yet?'”\n\nIt’s all due to the parody video showing Ashlee pregnant that Pete posted on his website\n\nPete should be careful not to blame anyone but himself for the pregnancy rumors. He posted a stupid video on his website in late February that was meant to be humorous and featured Ashlee wearing a big fake belly and acting like a hick. Pete talked about how he wanted to do charity work, but said that it was too hard. He then deadpanned that “The biggest problem facing our generation is the illegal downloading of music. I know what I’ll do, I’ll make a baby, because you can’t download a baby.” He said “here’s our answer to how to make the world a better place” and the camera panned to Ashlee on the bed with a big belly saying “honey get me the Cheetos!” Then Pete said “Street date, July 2008” and the credits listed “and the unborn baby, as himself.”\n\nMaybe Ashlee and Pete are trying to say it’s selfish to have children when there are so many people wanting in the world, but it also comes off as if they’re telling everyone they’re having a baby. So how is it a witch hunt if this video, which seems to include a due date and also lists their unborn child in the credits, sparks pregnancy rumors?\n\nThanks to FriendsOrEnemies.com via LAist for the video.\n\nPete and Ashlee are shown on 2/23/08 at LAX nightclub, thanks to PRPhotos."
