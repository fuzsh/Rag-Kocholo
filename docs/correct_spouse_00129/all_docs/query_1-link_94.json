        "text": "If you're planning a wedding and keeping your costs down is at the top of the list, there are few places better than El Paso to tie the knot in.\n\nAccording to a financial-services website, El Paso is the #1 city in Texas to get married. The finding was part of the recently released \"2023’s Best Places to Get Married.\"\n\n#1 In Texas, Top 10 in the U.S.\n\nTo determine the rankings, 182 of America's largest metropolitan areas were compared on key indicators of nuptial-friendliness such as average wedding costs, the number of available venues and wedding related services, and the number of nearby activities and attractions.\n\nNationwide, El Paso was #8. In Texas, however, the Sun City was the #1 wedding-friendly destination.\n\nAlthough we did poorly in the \"Facilities & Services\" category ranking in the bottom half at #107, we were near the top at #11 when it came to lowest average wedding cost.\n\nIn Texas, only Brownsville and Laredo had more affordable venues, restaurants, and hotel rooms.\n\nThe study did not give any specifics on how much less a wedding in El Paso costs compared to other cities, but according to a 2021 report the average amount couples spend on their wedding is around $28,000. And that’s just the cost of the ceremony and reception; engagement ring and honeymoon not included.\n\nWhether you choose to go big on a ballroom at the Plaza or ball on a budget with a backyard wedding featuring brisket and queso, let me be one of the first to congratulate you on building a life and corresponding mountain of debt together.
