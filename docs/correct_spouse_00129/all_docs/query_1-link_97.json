The couple met on the set of Pride and Prejudice in 2005.\n\nJanuary: Katie Price and Alex Reid\n\nWhether the split is a ‘shock’ is debatable, but in January 2011 it was confirmed that Katie Price and her cage-fighting husband of nearly one year, Alex Reid, were breaking up.

The Mad Men star split from her Saturday Night Live comedian-boyfriend Jason Sudeikis, with a source telling People magazine: “They've been on and off for a few months and then the long distance kind of ended it.
