        "text": "It's been over half a decade since the indie pop rock group, Two Door Cinema Club, has been played El Paso, Texas. For years we've been waiting patiently for their return. Now we know WHEN & WHERE they are arriving back to the Sun City in 2024.\n\nWhen is Two Door Cinema Club coming back to play in El Paso?\n\nThe band announced an additional 24 US dates for their 2024 North American tour. The band already had 3 Texas dates for 2024:\n\nTuesday May 28 at the Southside Ballroom in Dallas, TX\n\nWednesday, May 29th in Houston, TX at the White Oak Music Hall\n\nand Thursday, May 20th in Austin, TX at Stubb Waller's Creek Amphitheater.\n\nNow El Paso can be added to that list of Texas dates for TDCC.\n\nWednesday, September 25th at the Plaza Theater Performing Arts Center. Petey will be the special guest performing before Two Door Cinema Club in El Paso.\n\nand additional Austin date was added for Thursday, September 26th at the Moody Amphitheater\n\nThe last time El Paso saw Two Door Cinema Club was at a venue that's sadly no longer around\n\nSeptember 20, 2017 was the first time we saw them perform; at the iconic Tricky Falls that's sadly closed down its doors a while ago. For anyone who wasn't lucky enough to go to that show (like me), thankfully there are videos from that performance that we can watch on YouTube. Something to hold us over until we can experience that again in the Fall."
