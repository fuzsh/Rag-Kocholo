Ashlee Simpson has married Pete Wentz in an Alice In Wonderland-themed ceremony.

The couple tied the knot in the back garden of Simpson's parentsâ€™ California home on Saturday.

The singer's dad Joe officiated at the wedding, her sister Jessica was maid of honour and Wentz's dog served as ringbearer, reports People.

Simpson wore a Moniquel Lhuillier ivory lace gown, while the Fall Out Boy bassist sported a Dior Homme tuxedo.

They exchanged vows in front of more than 150 guests, including Nicole Richie, Joel Madden and Jessica's boyfriend Tony Romo.

Simpson recently revealed that she "flashed" her new husband the first time they met.
