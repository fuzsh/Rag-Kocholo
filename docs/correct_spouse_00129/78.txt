Ashlee Simpson is so over.

The newlywed pop singer will go by Ashlee Wentz in private, and be professionally known as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, according to a report posted Wednesday on People.com. The heretofore Simpson was married on May 17 to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz.

“I think that that’s something that a woman should do when they’re marrying a man,” the pop star lil’ sis of Jessica Simpson told the magazine. “It’s a tradition that I think is a great tradition.”

Phone and e-mail messages left with Simpson-Wentz’s publicist regarding the name change were not immediately returned.

Simpson-Wentz, 23, and Wentz, 28, exchanged vows earlier this month at her parents home in Encino, Calif. Joe Simpson, her father, performed the non-denominational ceremony and sister Jessica was the maid of honor, the magazine earlier reported.

Simpson-Wentz and Wentz began dating in fall 2006 and announced their engagement April 9.
