Ashlee Simpson has said that she will take on her new husband Pete Wentz‘s name.

The pop star and Fall Out Boy bassist were married in a secret ceremony earlier this month, as previously reported.

Wentz said he left the decision completely up to his new wife. “These decisions with Ashlee and her name are all completely up to Ashlee,” he told People. “I want her to do these kinds of things the way she wants to do them.”

Simpson said she decided to follow tradition. “I think that that’s something that a woman should do when they’re marrying a man. It’s a tradition that I think is a great tradition.”
