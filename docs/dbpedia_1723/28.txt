It can be difficult to define who you are as a business. Appealing to your target audience requires intentional messaging and a strong foundation. Radio advertising can give you both.

Working from the inside out, branding helps establish an emotional connection to your audience. It defines who you are and how you can help.

At Leighton Media, we use a radio-specific branding tool called BrandsFormation.® With radio branding, it’s less about the product and more about the feeling and connections associated with it. People care more about the sizzle of the steak than the grill they have to buy. But one can easily lead to the other.

Together, we’ll help you establish your brand for radio and turn listeners into loyal customers.

On-Air Promotions

Instead of a traditional commercial break, your business can sponsor an on-air giveaway. This is a great way to get your product or service into the hands of customers — whether it's a gift card or a free oil change.

On-air sponsorships allow you to connect with your audience in an interactive way that doesn’t feel like advertising. However, every time we promote the giveaway, we’ll mention your business. Plus, we promote the contest on social media, expanding your reach even more.

Throw a party at your business, and invite our radio station to show up for a live broadcast. Then, use the name recognition of our on-air personalities to invite people over for the party. It’s like having a local celebrity with a big guest list at your event. Here are some live broadcast-worthy event ideas:

Open house

Anniversary celebrations

Grand openings

Seasonal sales
