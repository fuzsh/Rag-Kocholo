• Leighton Broadcasting is looking for the next on-air PD for Top 40 KZGF (Z94.7)/Grand Forks, ND. Here’s the situation — Alayna Jaye is relinquishing her Z94.7 programming duties in order to focus on her on-air roles at sister KCLD/St. Cloud, MN — working with the Playhouse with Kat and JJ morning show and doing nights.

Grand Forks OM Jarrod Thomas is brutally honest when addressing potential replacement candidates, as he said, “I know we haven’t met, but I hope I can be honest with you — the cold cannot be a thing. If you can’t accept being cold a portion of the year, then this gig is not for you. Snow? Check. Cold? Check.”

Now comes the glass-is-half-full portion of the show, as Thomas continues, “There are four very distinct seasons in Grand Forks and the summers are downright glorious. If you have some programming experience or you are someone who fancies yourself as an up-and-comer, this job is for you. NexGen, Music Master, Social Media, and on-air experience are a must.”
