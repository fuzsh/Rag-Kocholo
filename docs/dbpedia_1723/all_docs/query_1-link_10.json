President & CEO Kimberly K Ryan bought 5,600 shares at $44.94 for a total of $251,664. Opinion: 4th Qtr Revenue of $763 million increased 26% compared to the prior year, yet net income of $17 million decreased from $31 million in the prior year largely due to an increase in taxes associated with business acquisition and integration costs. It's hard to be optimistic about a company deciding to get out of the death business they dominated, considering 10,000 people per day are turning 65. Funeral business has good times ahead. Instead, someone is going to reinvent the casket business, and it won't be them. $STOCK $HI https://lnkd.in/gDwJrq_t\n\nThese words are not just a testament to our efforts, but they also inspire us to keep pushing the boundaries of excellence.
