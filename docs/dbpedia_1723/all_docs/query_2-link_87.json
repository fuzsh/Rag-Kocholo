        "text": "Hubbard Radio Seattle today announced that Cat Thomas will become the Brand and Content Director at MOViN 92.5 and Warm 106.9, transferring from Hubbard Radio’s “Brooke & Jeffrey” affiliate She 100.3/WSHE Chicago, effective today.\n\nIn making the announcement, Hubbard Seattle Operations Manager Scott Mahalick said, “We are fortunate to have Cat to lead our successful team in Seattle and bring his gift of talent coaching and multi format experience to the Northwest.”\n\n“After the success with She 100.3 as an affiliate it’ll be exciting to work with the Brooke and Jeffrey Morning Show in person. I’ve been a fan since I first heard them; they’re funny, engaging and bring their best every day,” noted Cat. “Both Warm 106.9 and MOViN 92.5 have outstanding, successful air talent. I look forward to being a member of those winning teams and doing my best to help and support them.”\n\n“I know Cat to be a passionate winner and wonderful person. These successful staffs and brands deserve the best programmer available, and we welcome Cat,” said Wheeler Morris, VP/Market Manager for Hubbard Radio Seattle.\n\n“I am sad to see him leave Hubbard Chicago,” said Hubbard Radio VP/Market Manager Jeff England. “Cat has done an amazing job orchestrating the growth of She 100.3 to top 5 rank performance in key demos in the very competitive Chicago market. I know I speak for everyone here, we will miss Cat’s competitive drive, operational expertise, quick wit, and southern\n\ncharm.”\n\nCat was born and raised in North Carolina. His programming career includes WZYP-FM Huntsville, Power 108 in Cleveland, WAPE-FM in Jacksonville, and Operations Manager for Entercom Austin.\n\nAbsorbing Cat’s duties in Chicago is Jimmy Steal, VP of Brand and Content at WTMX/WSHE."
