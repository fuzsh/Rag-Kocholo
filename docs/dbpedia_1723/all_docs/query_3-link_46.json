The fast- growing show covers the most important legal and political events of the day and has become one of the top five most-listened-to programs, reaching a listener base of millions on over 300 stations across the nation. \"I am delighted to continue working with Cumulus and Westwood One and look forward to further developing the show over the next five years,\" Levin said. \"Mark has established himself as a pillar in talk radio with his sharp and witty commentary, and we look forward to expanding his program's reach,\" said John Dickey, Executive Vice President of Content and Programming for Cumulus. In 2003, \"The Mark Levin Show\" launched on flagship station 77 WABC Radio in New York in the competitive 6:00PM - 8:00PM primetime slot, skyrocketing to #1 on the AM dial within the show's first 18 months on the air. In 2009, a third hour was added to the broadcast to keep up with the demand from his radio affiliates and fans for even more original content. Prior to launching his radio career, Levin worked as an attorney in the private sector and as a top advisor and administrator to several members of President Reagan's cabinet.\n\n[WATCH] Radio Host Being Called Hero After Coming To The Aid Of Injured Police Officer\n\nTHE MOUTH, JANUARY 29TH, 2015 –– A Las Vegas radio host is being called a hero after coming to the aid of a police officer who was the victim of a hit and run. Miles Farlow, a host n KCEP FM 881.1 and Michael Gutierrez say they both stopped to aid a police officer who fell of his motorcycle earlier this week on a local Interstate highway. The crash occurred about 8:30 p.m.near an off-ramp. According to Fox 5 Las Vegas, the patrolman was traveling southbound along I-15 when a driver hit his motorcycle and then fled. Farlow witnessed the car swerve and hit the motorcycle officer. 'The officer went flying at least 30 yards, 90 feet,' Farlow said. After being ejected from his bike, the officer's head hit the concrete barrier wall. Farlow ran over to help, attempting to calm him down until help arrived. \"I wasn't really scared. I wasn't worried about anything besides getting him safe because he can't help. Another man, Michael Gutierrez, also ran to his aid. Farlow said he doesn't consider himself a hero. He was just doing what anyone should do in the situation. \"It hurts, and it's shocking to realize there are so few people in this world that will actually do that, that will actually put their life on the line to help another life,\" he said.
