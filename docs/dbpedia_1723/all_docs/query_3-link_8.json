        "text": "A COMPANY IS A LANGUAGE Companies are akin to complex languages, each with its own unique dialect and cultural nuances. And I think this explains why it’s so hard for executives — especially executives — to come in from outside an organization and find their way. At lower levels within an organization, you don’t need to be as proficient a speaker of “the language” to get by. Just as if you were a tourist with just enough basic local language skills to order lunch on vacation. If that’s all you have to do, you can get by, and the locals appreciate that you’re trying your best to be as clear and accurate as possible. The bar is lower, and the assistance and understanding from others is higher. But at the executive level, the linguistic demands intensify. You’re quickly expected to be a proficient speaker. To know the rules, grammar (and the esoteric exceptions), phonetics, intonation, semantics, and even the non-verbal cues that influence how someone else understands what you’re trying to communicate. It’s a tall order to learn a company — a language — quickly. As an executive, you aren’t a tourist. You’re a shopkeeper. A local. Someone who other people look to to find there own way. To get things from. To help them get unstuck. And these other employees — these these native speakers — consider you a local by way of power and position fairly quickly. A casual browse through LinkedIn at C-level folks will unearth many short tenures. 2 years. 3 and a half. Sometimes just 1. It’s incredibly hard to become a high-expectation native speaker in such short order. This leads to what I call “churnover” — a high turnover rate driven by the churn of executives struggling to fully integrate into their new corporate language. I don’t think there’s a fix for it either. And I don’t think it’s a bad thing. Companies try, executives try. Sometimes someone feathers in, loses their accent, and becomes a native speaker quickly. “Wow, I would have thought you grew up here”. It happens in society, it happens at work. But it’s not common. Typically, people struggle to learn a new language. They hit plateaus. Remnants of where they came from stay on the surface. Hints of their native tongue still chirp from time to time. Ultimately, some people are better at picking up new languages than others. We know it’s true for actual languages, so we should assume it’s true at the company level, too.\n\nQuestions I ask when checking references When hiring for key positions, our last step is speaking with references. A phase for the final-finalists. When I talk to a supplied reference, I'm curious about nuance, feel, and paradox, not the obvious stuff. Below is a question library I might pull from. • What's something that would surprise us about them? • Specifically, any areas where you were surprised they weren't as good as you expected with A, B, or C? Or much better than expected with D, E, and F? • What's the difference between how they interview and how they deliver on the job? • Is there a difference between how a boss, a peer, or a direct report would describe them? If so, what's the difference? • If you were at another company, would you absolutely hire this person again for a similar role? • Who do they naturally gravitate to inside an organization? Or naturally avoid? • What are they better at than they think, and, on the flip side, worse at than they think? • What sort of things do they do that often go unnoticed or are under-appreciated? • What don't they get enough credit for? • Can you tell me about the kind of people they've hired? • Do they leave disagreements on good terms? • Are they more curious or critical about what they don't understand? • What's the one thing nearly everyone would say about them? • What kind of company feels like a natural fit? And which kind would be a challenge? • Can you describe a time when they changed their mind? From what to what, and what caused the change? • What's the best thing about working with them? And the hardest? • If you could change something about them, what would it be? • Are they better working with what they have, or working with what they want? • When have you seen them get in over their head? And how did that turn out? • Have you seen them get better at something? Worse? • Do they make other people better? How? • Are they better at taking credit or giving credit? • Are they more likely to adjust to something, or try to adjust the thing? • Primary blindspot? And bright spot? • As well as you know this person, what do you think their secret career ambition is? • If they hadn't been at your company, how would your company have been different? • Can you remember a time you wished you had their advice on a decision, but you didn't? • Have they ever changed your mind? • What's the easiest thing for them to communicate? And the hardest? • How have they changed during the time you knew them? • Do you still keep in touch even though you don't work together anymore? • What do they need to be successful? • Why do you think we'd be a better company with them on board? • Who else should I talk to that would have something to say about them? There are many more, but those are among the things I'm most curious about. Feel free to take them, use them, tell me they're great questions, or terrible ones. Either way, I hope you found them useful."
