        "text": "BBC Radio 6 Music is one of the BBC's digital radio stations. It was known officially as BBC 6 Music from its launch on 11 March 2002 until April 2011. 6 Music was the first national music radio station to be launched by the BBC in 32 years. It is available only on digital media: DAB radio, the Internet, digital television, and in northern Europe through the Astra 2B satellite. Often referred to as the sister station of BBC Radio 2, it shares common features and DJs with both BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2. For instance, it operates a playlist of similar 'A/B/C' structure to both Radios 1 and 2 and regularly shares selective tracks on its 'A' playlist with both stations, although it is generally less reliant upon chart music than the more mainstream stations. Evening and weekend programming, however, features a more diverse selection of tracks across genres both popular and on the fringes, with dedicated shows towards different forms of dance, jazz, soul, and Jamaican music, among others. The station also features performances from the BBC music archives, including the \"Peel Sessions\" put together by John Peel from the late 1960s to 2004.\n\nBig Tracks is a 2nd generation classic rock channel on XM Satellite Radio. It plays music from the late 1970s until the early 1990s. It took up where Top Tracks left off, and most of the later classic rock belonged on its sister Top Tracks channel until Big Tracks was launched. The channel was officially dropped on November 12, 2008 because of the Sirius XM merger, and replaced by Sirius' Classic Rewind and Hair Nation."
