In 2023, while the US staffing industry declined by 10%, the engineering segment saw a projected increase of 5%, expected to grow by 8% in 2024, reaching a market value of $10.4 billion. The ‚Äòcontingent‚Äô (contract) workforce in the US is on the rise, with freelancers comprising 39% of the total workforce in 2022, and projections suggest that by 2050, 50% of the workforce will be contractors. Why is the contract market an excellent option in the current candidate-short market? Here are a few reasons: Flexibility: Contract staffing provides employers with flexibility in a tight job market. It allows organizations to scale their workforce based on project demands, saving costs in the long term. Access to Specialist Skills: Contract staffing enables access to a broader talent pool, including highly specialized individuals not available for permanent positions. This is crucial in addressing the shortage of skilled candidates, especially in engineering and construction. Speed of Recruitment: With high demand for engineering talent, traditional hiring processes can be time-consuming. Contractors offer a quick solution, allowing companies to fill critical roles quickly and maintain project timelines. Cost-Effectiveness: Hiring contract professionals can be more cost-effective than permanent employment, helping organizations align costs with project budgets efficiently. Project-Based Support: Many projects require specific expertise for successful completion. Contract staffing allows companies to bring in professionals with the exact skills needed for each project phase. The trends for the US staffing industry in 2024 indicate significant growth potential, with the contract market estimated to reach $207.2 billion, accounting for 89% of the total recruitment market. In engineering and construction, the US contract market stands out as a viable and advantageous option, offering flexibility, access to specialized skills, speedy recruitment, cost-effectiveness, and project-based support. This underscores its importance in addressing the candidate shortage and meeting industry hiring needs.

Contract staffing is a practice where an organization hires employees on a contractual basis to fulfill specific roles or projects for a limited period of time. How Does Contract Staffing Work? Contract staffing typically involves a staffing agency that recruits and hires employees on behalf of client organizations. Challenges of Contract Staffing While contract staffing offers several benefits, there are also some challenges to consider. These include: Lack of job security for contract employees. Potential for misclassification of employees as independent contractors. Best Practices for Contract Staffing To maximize the benefits of contract staffing and minimize the challenges, employers should follow some best practices, including: Clearly define the job responsibilities and expectations for contract employees. Establish clear communication channels between the client organization and the staffing agency.\n\nIn the current dynamic business landscape, companies increasingly consider temporary staffing solutions to stay agile and meet fluctuating workforce needs. My colleague Robyn White from our Temp & Contract Business Support desk at Morgan McKinley explained in her recent post why embracing temporary staffing can be advantageous for organisations.
