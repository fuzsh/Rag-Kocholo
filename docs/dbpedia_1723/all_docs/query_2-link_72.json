        "text": "7 Inventorying your SQL estate\n\nIn the last chapter, you learned methods of identifying the SQL Server Instances on your network. Once you know where they are, you will want to create an inventory. This is an essential DBA task that is useful for a variety of scenarios:\n\nAudits\n\nBaselines\n\nCapacity Planning\n\nChange Management\n\nMigrations & Upgrades\n\nReporting\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nCreating inventories lets you to provide access to reports for members of the organization without having to grant access to your SQL instances. Keeping your inventory up to date will help to speed up the planning of migrations & upgrades in particular, as knowing what features are in-use can keep upgrades properly planned and on track.\n\nDBAs are often expected to just know the configuration of every host, instance and database in their estate. With a handful of instances this may be possible but for hundreds or thousands it is unlikely.\n\nWe are often asked to know things like:\n\nFeature usage\n\nBuild info\n\nHost (server) info\n\nDatabases\n\nJobs\n\nApplication logins\n\nDisk space trends\n\nInstance configuration (is xp_cmdshell enabled?)\n\nPort Configuration\n\nEdition\n\nInstallation Date\n\nLast Check Database Integrity Check\n\nDBCC / Suspect Pages\n\nLast Backup Date\n\nCentralized Error Messages\n\n7.1 SQL Features\n\n7.2 Build\n\n7.3 Host info\n\n7.4 Databases\n\n7.4.1 Filtering the databases that are returned from Get-DbaDatabase\n\n7.4.2 Filtering the databases that are returned from Get-DbaDatabase by last backup time\n\n7.5 Putting it all together into a database"
