        "text": "The following are updates to previously-reported items and other recent regulatory filings and actions concerning Upper Midwest broadcast stations. This report is created by the author and is not an official report of the FCC.\n\nIowa\n\nThe Educational Media Foundation’s KIMI/107.7 (Malvern) has withdrawn its application to upgrade to 50kW/124m (class C2) as it continues to work on resolving a long-running concerns about interference to an adjacent airplane navigation frequency in the Omaha area. Though permitted for 13kW/124m (C3), KIMI is currently operating under special temporary authority at 110 Watts. A Feb. 2 email from an EMF representative to the FCC says that after working on the issue for several years, “it appears we have hit a dead end.” The email says they are now considering a lower power level than previously proposed.\n\nAn application by KNEI-FM/103.5 (Waukon) to move its transmitter north to a site just over the Minnesota border was dismissed at the station’s request. An email attached to the application says the station’s new owners, LA Communications, have dropped the plans.\n\nThe FCC quickly approved an upgrade for St. Gabriel Communications’ future station on 89.9 in Spencer from 6kW/84m (class A) to 22kW/84m (C3). See the Jan. 23 FCC Monitor for the background.\n\nThe FCC approved On The Go Media’s purchase of KLMJ/104.9 (Hampton) and KQCR/98.9 (Parkersburg) from CD Broadcasting.\n\nKCMR/97.9 (Mason City) requested an extension of special temporary authority to operate at 3.25kW ERP rather than its licensed 6kW. The reduced power is a result of an August 2022 electrical storm that damaged two transmitter power supplies. The latest filing says materials have been ordered but it’s uncertain when they will arrive due to supply chain issues.\n\nThe FCC granted an extension of special temporary authority for KMGO/98.7 (Centerville) to operate with 19.5kW/124m as it continues work to build a new 100kW/321m facility. As previously reported here, the station’s licensed 100kW facility in Centerville was affected by a lightning strike in 2016.\n\nMichigan\n\nVCY America’s WVCN/104.3 (Baraga) reported that it is transmitting at 2kW, rather than its licensed 100kW, due to antenna icing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe FCC dismissed an application by Milestone Radio II’s KBGY/107.5 (Faribault) to move its transmitter closer to the Twin Cities metro area, which would have included a community of license change to Elko New Market. A brief note in the Feb. 2 Actions Public Notice says the application was dismissed for failure to prosecute. The application had been pending for more than two years.\n\nLeighton Enterprises’ KYCK/97.1 (Crookston-Grand Forks) applied to move its transmitter about five miles west, going from a tower near Fisher to one in Bygland. KYCK would remain 100kW and slightly increase its antenna height from 113m to 121m above average terrain. FCC records indicate both towers are owned by Leighton Enterprises; the Bygland tower is also home to KZGF/94.7 (Grand Forks) and KZLT/104.3 (East Grand Forks).\n\nNote: This item has been corrected to reflect the correct owner of KYCK.\n\nLeighton Enterprises’ KJJK/1020 (Fergus Falls) requested an extension of special temporary authority to operate at reduced power of 60 Watts. The filing says work to repair the transmission system began last fall but rain delayed the laying of ground cable, so completion is now expected in the spring.\n\nNebraska\n\nLegacy Broadcasting’s KRGI/1430 (Grand Island) requested an extension of special temporary authority to operate at reduced nighttime power of 250 Watts non-directional, rather than its licensed 1kW directional nighttime facility. The latest filing says that the station continues to seek a qualified consulting engineer who has the necessary equipment to perform required tests on the directional array. The filing also says Legacy is considering whether to apply for a permanent change to non-directional nighttime operation at a lower power level.\n\nSee Omaha-related item under Iowa\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBEK Sports Network submitted a request for program test authority for new TV station KNGF/27 (Grand Forks), a filing which indicates the station could begin broadcasting soon. It will transmit from the KVLY-TV tower near Blanchardville with 720kW.\n\nThe FCC approved an application from Jordan Zeller’s KQYZ/99.1 (Emerado) to move to 98.5 and use a transmitter site near East Grand Forks, MN, where it will transmit with 9kW/102m. The move will give the new station a strong signal to Grand Forks.\n\nThe FCC approved a plan for Educational Media Foundation “Air1” station KFAA/89.5 (Horace-Fargo) to move from its present tower site in West Fargo to a location about four miles to the southeast near I-29. It will switch from its present 7.3kW/28m to 3kW/46m.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCarroll University reported that it continues to explore options about the future operation of WCCX/104.5 (Waukesha), which has been off the air since May 31, 2022 due to staffing and financial limitations. The update comes in a request to extend special temporary authority to remain silent through May 30. The 13-Watt station has a rare grandfathered class D educational license, a type which is no longer issued.\n\nMazur LLC’s WSBW/105.1 (Ephraim) returned to the air Jan. 25. It had gone off the air Nov. 30 due to weather damage to its transmission line.\n\nWisconsin Public Radio’s WHSA/89.9 (Brule) reported that it returned to full power on Jan. 27. It had operated at reduced power for ten days due to icing conditions.\n\nDisclosure: Jon Ellis is an employee of Gray Media Group.
