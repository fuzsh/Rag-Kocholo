        "text": "The witch (Meryl Streep, right) explains that the Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily\n\nBlunt) will need to find four items in order to reverse the curse that has left them unable\n\nto start a family. Naturally, we cannot help feeling that the witch isn't being entirely honest\n\nabout why she actually wants these items... Dismayed to have come to the direct attention of sadistic concentration camp guard\n\nMutsuhiro Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara, right), Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell)\n\nis subjected to a series of increasingly brutal and humiliating ordeals. As a massive battle between elves, dwarves, humans and nasty orcs rages about them,\n\nGandalf (Ian McKellen, left) and Bard (Luke Evans) realize that the ghastly orc armies are\n\nbeing directed by the orc lord Azog the Defiler, standing on a nearby hilltop. Clearly, he\n\nmust be stopped ... but how? Much as he hates to play along, Andre (Chris Rock) agrees to smile for the ubiquitous\n\ncameras on behalf of his fiancée, Erica (Gabrielle Union), a realty TV star who insists that\n\nher entire life take place in full view of her devoted fans. During Cambridge's annual May Dance, Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) can't quite get into the\n\nspirit of the event itself — for openers, he refuses to dance! — but his goofy charm\n\nnonetheless makes an increasingly strong impact on Jane (Felicity Jones). Oddly enough, Rex (Chris Pine, right) doesn't seem all that bothered after learning that our\n\ninept heroes — from left, Dale (Charlie Day), Nick (Jason Bateman) and Kurt (Jason\n\nSudeikis) — planned to kidnap him. Seems that Rex has his own issues with his wealthy,\n\noverbearing father... When Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, foreground right) agrees to check on the injured civilians\n\nin a District 8 hospital, she's joined by, from left, Commander Paylor (Patina Miller) Gale\n\n(Liam Hemsworth), Boggs (Mahershala Ali) and Pollux (Elden Henson). John Du Pont (Steve Carell, left) knows precisely how to inspire the impressionable Mark\n\nSchultz (Channing Tatum), and for a time the weathy older man seems well-meaning, if\n\na bit daft. But this relationship dynamic is about to turn very, very uncomfortable. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons, right) is gentle with trainee drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) for\n\nabout 15 seconds ... after which the young student quickly begins to fear his new\n\ninstructor's dismissive gestures and increasingly impatient growl of \"Not my tempo!\" When a solar-powered drone cuts across the sky above their corn field — a striking\n\nreminder of science long absent from a decaying United States — Cooper (Matthew\n\nMcConaughey, left) attempts to hijack it while being watched by children Murphy\n\n(Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothée Chalamet). Is there such a thing as too much comfort? After expressing some fairly trivial frustration,\n\nHiro discovers that his new Personal Healthcare Companion — dubbed Baymax — has\n\nthe \"perfect\" solution: an all-enveloping hug. When Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton, left) learns that co-star Mike Shiner (Edward\n\nNorton) has hijacked some of his best personal material for a lavish newspaper interview,\n\nraw fury propels the two men into the sort of laughably flimsy fist-fight that one would\n\nexpect from two guys who haven't the faintest idea how to throw a punch."
