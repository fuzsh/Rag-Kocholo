        "text": "Let’s go back to the beginning. Did you come to science on your own or were your parents scientific?\n\nMartin Rees: No, my parents were teachers but not scientific. I had no particular scientific background. I was interested in numbers and nature and was sent to university and studied math and then didn’t want to be a mathematician and then decided to apply to something. I thought, at one stage, I’d do economics, but then I went for physical sciences and astronomy. I might have been equally happy doing economics, but I’ve been very fortunate to have had a ringside seat for many of the exciting developments in astronomy over most of my career, and the rest of science, too.\n\nCan you recall what first spurred your interest in astronomy?\n\nMartin Rees: I’m not someone who had a focus on astronomy from an early age. I studied math and science and did math at university. But I decided that I didn’t want to be a mathematician. I like to think in a more synthetic and synoptic way. And so I thought of being an economist at one stage but then, almost by chance, I ended up enrolling as a graduate student in Cambridge and was assigned to a very inspiring supervisor, an adviser who was in astronomy.\n\nAnd after a year, I realized that was a good decision. Not only because I had a wonderful mentor but also because this was a time in the mid-1960s when astronomy was opening up. For the first time, you had evidence for black holes, that there was a Big Bang in the universe, and that we could understand how the universe evolved. It’s always good in a subject to be in at the beginning because then the old guys have no big advantage over the young guys, so you could make a mark fairly quickly. I was quite lucky in that sense.\n\nBut actually, what’s made me feel even luckier in my career is that the rate of discovery has not declined at all. Within the last few years, we’ve had discovering planets around other stars, an entirely new field that makes the night sky far more interesting; also, gravitational waves from space and all kinds of things. So it’s a wonderful subject, where, as our knowledge has advanced, the periphery has gotten longer, and we can now address questions that couldn’t even have been posed 40 years ago.\n\nHow did you get from being a novice astronomer to where you are today?\n\nMartin Rees: I think I’ve been lucky in a number of respects, in that I started to work in a subject — astronomy and space — at a time when it was really taking off with new techniques and new ideas, and I did this in a university and in a community of colleagues who were very stimulating. So I’ve been very lucky to have a ringside seat, as it were, for the developments of a science — understanding the cosmos — which I think, when the history of science is written, will be one of the sort of most exciting chapters for the last few decades. I’ve been lucky to be part of that.\n\nBut also, I’ve been, in my later years, involved in policy regarding the applications of science, not just rocketry in space, but also bio and cyber, because I’ve been in a university where I’ve got to know these people. I had the privilege of being president of the Royal Society, which is the British academy of sciences, and involved in policy areas. So I feel I’ve had the chance of being close to many of the people involved in changing the world through other sciences, quite apart from the science that I’m an expert in — and also, to have been able to do this in an environment which is very stimulating, and to have had contact with very many people through this work.\n\nSo I think I’ve been very lucky. But I think the main theme, I would say, for my work, is it’s been very collaborative and interactive. I’m not the kind of person who likes to sit alone and think through some very complicated logical or mathematical problem. I like interacting and sharing ideas, and I’ve been very lucky to work in fields where that’s actually been a constructive thing to do. And I hope that I’ve stimulated others to do work which I have not been able to do myself and to raise wider consciousness of some of these concerns which stem from science. Because science deepens our sense of mystery and wonder about the world around us, but also, it allows us to change the world around us, and we’ve got to make sure we change it in benign ways and minimize the downsides. So that’s been something I’ve been concerned about, certainly in the last decade or two.\n\nYou’ve done a great deal of work in the area of quasars and their relationship to black holes, their source of energy. Can you describe your role in that process of discovery?\n\nMartin Rees: Well, we know that the basic large-scale constituents of the universe are galaxies — like our Milky Way — each containing about a hundred million stars. But we also know that these entities, which are basically, apparently, stars orbiting around a central hub, are centered around a black hole in the center of the galaxy.\n\nAnd that black hole is often quiescent. There’s one in our Milky Way which weighs about four million times as much as the sun. But other galaxies have these in them. And if they are just quiescent, we don’t see them. But if gas falls into them, then the gas swirls in and gets magnetized and very hot. And that gas, in falling into the black hole, releases far more energy than the hundred billion stars in the galaxy.\n\nSo the brightest objects we see, when we look with our telescope, in the universe, are these so-called quasars, where the light of all the stars is outshone by the central concentrated light associated with a black hole. And this is important in itself because it allows us to study extreme conditions where gravity is very strong. But also, it allows us to probe further out in the universe and therefore further back in the past.\n\nBecause the further out you look in the universe, the longer the light has taken to get to us, and therefore, the further you’re looking back in the past. So the fact that these quasars are so bright has made it possible for us to actually understand what the universe was like, not merely now, but one billion, two billion, three billion, and up to twelve billion years ago by looking at these quasars.\n\nThis, therefore, means that if we want to try and understand how our universe has evolved, and how, from some Big Bang, it eventually turned into the complex cosmos we are part of, we can do better than geologists. We can look not just at fossils of the past, but we can actually observe the past because when we look far away we are looking back. So we can actually see what galaxies were like at different stages in their development.\n\nHow do you see your role in the advances we’ve seen in your field?\n\nMartin Rees: I’m a sort of theorist and interpreter of data, and what’s carried the subject forward in the last 50 years has been, really, the improvements in instrumentation — much more powerful telescopes, better ways of registering faint light, and of course, being able to send things up into space above the blurry and absorption effect of the earth’s atmosphere. So it’s these huge technical advances which have driven the subject. I mean armchair theory doesn’t get you very far by itself. We’re no wiser than Aristotle was, and the reason we’ve got these advances has been essentially the technology.\n\nAnd also, of course, understanding raw physics, because the atoms we see in galaxies are the same as the ones we study in the lab, so we understand all about the physics. But just as a footnote to that, there’s another motive for studying astronomy apart from just exploring cosmic environments. And that’s that the universe provides a laboratory where we can observe conditions far more extreme than we could ever simulate here on Earth — extreme densities, extremely strong gravity, extremely high temperatures and all that. So if you want to, as it were, test the laws of nature to the breaking point and understand new ones, the best way to do it is to look up in the sky.\n\nJust in September of 2017, there was an amazing discovery which excited us, when, for the first time, we found evidence of two neutron stars, amazing objects, where the mass of a million Earths is packed into something about ten miles across. Two of those spiraled together, and they spiraled together, and before they merged, they were going around each other at several hundred revs per second, and there was a real splat when they collided. This was observed by a gravitational wave detector, and then two seconds after that, it was found that there was a gamma-ray flash, and then there’s an afterglow, which is still being watched months later. So that’s an example of where we can use all the techniques for observation to try and piece together what happened in this very extreme event, which obviously, we could never simulate here on Earth.\n\nHow have these revelations supported or undermined Albert Einstein’s theories about the universe?\n\nMartin Rees: Albert Einstein, of course, gave us a theory of gravity, which gave deeper insights into gravity. We’ve had, ever since Sir Isaac Newton, a theory of gravity which works pretty well and is sufficient to understand the orbit of planets and to guide space probes to the planets, et cetera. But it breaks down if the speeds get very high or if gravity gets very strong. And there are places in the cosmos where gravity is strong.\n\nEinstein’s theory not only has broader applicability, but it gives a deeper insight into why gravity behaves the way it does. He had a new way of looking at gravity and linking space and time. And the most extreme manifestations of Einstein’s theory are black holes, where an object has contracted, got so small that not even light can escape its gravitational field. And it leaves a sort of gravitational imprint frozen in the space that’s left. Black holes were probably the most remarkable conjecture from Einstein’s theory, but the evidence for them didn’t come, really, until the quasars in the late 1960s, which were the first indirect evidence. But since that time, it’s been possible to understand how gas flows near a black hole, and much more recently, to study what happens when black holes crash together and produce gravitational waves, which is a little ripple in space itself.\n\nSo I would say that over the last 50 years, Einstein’s theory has been vindicated. Fifty years ago, there were only a few tests of it, which weren’t very precise, and they only applied when it was weak. But now I think we’ve got very strong reasons for believing that it is the right insight into space and time, and black holes are governed by the equations of Einstein. Also, that the early Big Bang, which set our universe expanding, was governed by those same equations. So we do have a very good theory which explains gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nWhat is your own relationship to Einstein and his work?\n\nMartin Rees: Well, of course, I never met him; he died in 1955. I think he is really rather special in the history of science. There’s an interesting contrast between creativity in the arts and the sciences. I mean in the arts, whether you’re outstanding or just average, your work has individuality, but it may not last. If you’re a scientist, in most cases, your work may last — you’ve added one brick to the edifice of public knowledge — but it doesn’t have individuality. If you hadn’t done it, someone else would have done it. And that’s true of almost all of science. Einstein is almost an exception to that, in that, if Einstein hadn’t existed, the ideas that we now associate with him would have gradually emerged, but it would have taken much longer.\n\nSo he made a far more distinctive imprint in that he was motivated not by some kind of observations. The ideas weren’t already in the air, as they normally are when science advances, but it was pure thought that led him to this. And had it not been for Einstein, it would have been maybe decades before we had an equivalent theory of gravity. So he made, I think, an especially distinctive imprint and therefore had more individuality in what he contributed to science. In most cases, it doesn’t really matter because if A doesn’t do something, B soon will.\n\nOne of my favorite scientific authors is Peter Medawar, and he had a lovely statement in one of his books, where he expressed this contrast by saying that if a scientist doesn’t do something, someone else will. But he said that when Wagner took ten years off in the middle of the Ring cycle to compose Meistersinger and Tristan, he didn’t think that someone was going to scoop him on Götterdämmerung. So that’s the big difference between creativity in the arts and in sciences.\n\nYou’ve done some work that approaches the intersection of spirituality and science. These are things that usually lead in different directions. Could you talk about that?\n\nMartin Rees: Well, I’d be diffident about that. I think you’re probably asking that question because I received the Templeton Prize, which is given for those sorts of things. But the Templeton Prize is also given for work on big questions — or it was at that time — and I think I can say I do work on big questions. I don’t answer them, but I work on them. But in terms of spirituality, I would just say that thinking about these questions does stimulate mystery and wonder.\n\nIt doesn’t erase it, but it stimulates mystery and wonder, the more you understand. And as regards to the Templeton Prize, it’s often given to people of genuine spirituality. I’m not a religious believer at all, and I recall that when I got the prize, Freeman Dyson — a great physicist who had also won the prize — he sent me a note saying he felt better about his prize because I’d done equally little to deserve it, to him, because we were the two people who weren’t really especially religious but had been given the prize because we had both worked on the big questions and, of course, appreciated that there should be a peaceful coexistence between religion and science.\n\nThat’s been a little difficult for some people to comprehend. Often religion and science seem to be in opposition.\n\nMartin Rees: I mean obviously, if religion claims to give dogmatic answers to scientific questions, then, of course, it’s invading territory where it has no particular credentials. And of course, if people say the world started 6,000 years ago, we know that’s obviously completely wrong. So I think science can’t coexist with dogmatic kinds of religion like that. But there are no sophisticated believers who would accept that. I’m on the Council of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and I know the views of the Catholic Church establishment on this, and they’re very happy now with evolution. And there’s no real conflict, provided that religion doesn’t really invade the territory of empirical science.\n\nBut I think, as regards religion, I am sort of sympathetic to religious practice. I am happy to participate in church services. I was brought up in England, in the English church, and I value the community aspects of that church. I value the wonderful aesthetic accretions, both the architecture and the music, and I’m happy to participate in common rituals. But that doesn’t mean I accept the Christian dogma, and I think if I was born in Iran, I would go to the mosque in exactly the same spirit.\n\nBefore we leave astronomy, what do you think is the next frontier, and are we working on it?\n\nMartin Rees: I think there are two basic frontiers. One is to push back to the very, very early universe. We understand, with a great deal of confidence, what happened in the Big Bang after the first was over because, after the first microsecond, the conditions in the universe were no more extreme than we can simulate in a lab.\n\nSo we have fairly good evidence for what happened from a millisecond after the Big Bang, a microsecond after the Big Bang, to the present. But if we try and extrapolate a bit further to the first tiny, tiny fraction of a second, then the conditions, in terms of density and temperature and energy, were more extreme than we can simulate. And therefore, we lose our foothold in empirical physics; and therefore, things are more uncertain.\n\nAnd we would like to have a theory which allows us to be more confident about those very early stages. Incidentally, that theory is a special challenge because it will involve achieving one of the summits of 21st-century science which hasn’t yet been reached, which is to unify Einstein’s theory of gravity with the quantum principle.\n\nEinstein’s gravity applies to things on the cosmic scale — stars and planets, et cetera — and the quantum theory applies to the microworld of atoms. We have no theory that combines those two. That doesn’t matter in most of science because if you’re a chemist, you don’t have to worry about the gravitational effect between different atoms in a molecule. It’s very weak. On the other hand, if you’re an astronomer, you don’t need to worry about the quantum fuzziness in the orbit of a planet because it’s so big that that’s negligible. But if we want to understand the very beginning of the universe, when the entire observable universe could have been squeezed to microscopic size, then clearly we need a theory which is going to incorporate gravity and also incorporate the quantum principle. And that’s what we don’t yet have. So one of the challenges, obviously, is to take more steps towards reaching that summit of a unified theory because only then will we be able to have a firmer view for what happened in the very early beginning.\n\nSo that’s one frontier. Another quite different area of astronomy which is developing fast is looking for planets around other stars. The night sky has become hugely more interesting in the last ten or twenty years because we now know that most of the stars you see in the sky are not just points of light. They’re surrounded by retinues of planets, just as the sun is surrounded by the earth and the other familiar planets. And until twenty years ago, we had no evidence for this. But now we know that most stars have planets around them and that, in our galaxy, there are probably a billion planets rather like the earth, in the sense of having orbits where water could exist and being about the size of the earth. This is fascinating to study and, of course, motivates the thought of whether life could have emerged and evolved on these.\n\nSo the subject of exobiology— trying to understand these planets and to see if there’s evidence for life on them — is, I think, going to be really exciting. At the moment, the planets are only really inferred indirectly by looking at the star they’re orbiting around and seeing their effect on the star — making it a bit dimmer if they transit in front of it or causing a bubble due to their gravity. But with the next generation of telescopes, we’ll be able to actually analyze the light from the planets themselves, and that’ll tell us whether they have a biosphere, whether there’s evidence for oxygen — water vapor and things like that — and that’s going to be very exciting.\n\nOf course, we want to understand the origin of life because even though we understand how Darwinian selection allowed — over four billion years —simple life in the young earth to evolve into the complex biosphere of which we’re a part, we don’t yet understand how life began here on Earth, in the sense of what triggered the transition from complex chemistry to the first replicating, metabolizing systems which we call “alive.” Serious people are working on that, and I hope they make progress. And if they make progress, it’ll tell us two other things. It’ll tell us: Was this such a rare fluke that it wouldn’t have happened elsewhere, or would we expect it to have happened on these other Earthlike planets? Secondly, it’ll tell us whether the DNA-RNA basis of life on Earth is uniquely special, as it were, or whether there could be life based on quite different chemistry, maybe even without water. We don’t know those questions. So that’s a fascinating frontier of astronomy and science.\n\nSo I would say there are three frontiers of science. There’s the very small, the quantum world; the very large, the cosmic world; and we want to unify those to understand the Big Bang. But there’s a third frontier of science, which is a very complicated world. And that’s the everyday world, especially biological things. That’s quite different because the challenge there is to understand complexity. Biologists aren’t held up by not understanding subnuclear physics or by not understanding Einstein’s theory. They are held up because even the smallest organism is far more complicated than an atom or a star.\n\nWhen many of us were children, we learned about the sun and the moon and nine planets and that was it. It seems like the universe is a lot bigger than we thought.\n\nMartin Rees: It’s a lot bigger, obviously, because we know that our sun is one of a hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy, and our Milky Way galaxy is one of about a hundred billion galaxies that we can see at the limits of our telescope. And incidentally, there’s more speculative — I personally think that physical reality is vastly more extensive still than the region we can observe. So there’s been a huge expansion in scale. But I think what’s been even more important is the ability to observe in different wavebands and with greater sensitivity. That’s how we’ve come to map out the universe in more detail and understand more about the physics of the stars and planets and galaxies within it.\n\nYou wrote a book some years ago that you called The Final Century. It had another title in the U.S., didn’t it?\n\nMartin Rees: They called it The Final Hour for some reason, yes. They might like instant gratification in the reverse, but it was a rather inappropriate title because we’ve got to think on the time scale of the century. But the theme of that book really was that this century is special, and we do have to worry about the fact that we are now empowered by these new technologies. And I did, in that book, already highlight these concerns. I think — in the subsequent decade or so — I think these concerns have been vindicated because the techniques have got much more powerful.\n\nTell us about the study of existential risk.\n\nMartin Rees: I think we have these two categories of risks, which are across this century — which are, of course, either by our collective actions affecting the climate or the biosphere, or the risk of a runaway catastrophe caused by misuse of these powerful technologies — of cybertechnology — advanced intelligence that may have human capabilities and may run away, or the ability to modify genomes, and we can create new species. Or we may have the ability to create artificial intelligence with many human capabilities or to produce drastically different species by modifying the genome. Might as well be playing God on a kitchen table, and that’s a really scary possibility. So I worry about those sorts of threats, as well as the threats stemming from our collective interaction with the environment and the climate. And it has struck me and some of my colleagues that there’s not enough attention given to these threats. We want to use the technology optimally and minimize its downsides. Mistakes are getting higher as these techniques get more powerful. That’s why I think it’s very important to ensure that experts focus on how to assess which of these scenarios can be dismissed as science fiction and which are sufficiently real that we ought to think about them and address how we can minimize their impact.\n\nAnd not enough people are doing this. There’s far less attention given to these sort of potentially existential risks than to very small risks. There are huge numbers of people thinking about the dangers of carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, making planes safer, avoiding train crashes, and things of that kind. But the amount of attention given to these high-consequence/low-probability events, whose probability is rising all the time, as technology gets higher, is very low.\n\nThat’s why we in Cambridge have set up a group to try and focus on these. Cambridge, I think, can claim to be the number-one scientific university in Europe. We, in Europe, therefore feel we can do something by using our convening power to get experts together. Experts can’t be right; they’ve got a poor record of predictions, but they can do a better job than anyone else in trying to assess which are the concerns we should have high on our agenda and what we can do to minimize them. So that’s what we’re trying to do in Cambridge, to get an interdisciplinary group with a focus on these, to draw on the expertise we have around us nationally, and indeed, internationally, to try and raise these issues up the agenda.\n\nWas there a time in your career when you realized that your responsibility as a scientist should lead you to speak out more about these issues?\n\nBack in the 1980s, I was quite involved in the Pugwash movement for nuclear disarmament, and I was a member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and things like that. So I spoke and wrote quite a bit about the nuclear threat back then. And I had the privilege, through those activities, of getting to know some of the most impressive people I’ve ever met, who are some of the physicists who worked at Los Alamos, during World War II, on the bomb. But then they returned to civilian and academic life afterwards and felt an obligation to do all they could to control the powers that they’d helped unleash. I’m thinking of people like Joseph Rotblat, Hans Bethe, Viki Weisskopf, and people like that, really great men. Sadly, they’re no longer with us.\n\nI think they set an example for scientists, in any area of science that has societal ramifications, which is that, even if you are primarily an academic scientist, you should be concerned about the application of your work. You may not yourself do the exploitation of the work, but you should be concerned to ensure that if your work has beneficial applications, someone exploits them. And if it has dangerous applications, efforts are made to reduce their risk. That is now a responsibility which I think falls not just on the nuclear scientists, as it did 70 years ago onwards, but on the scientists involved in these other new techniques, particularly microbiology, genetics, artificial intelligence, and cyber techniques. So I think it’s very important that they should be engaged.\n\nOf course, scientists should realize that they are only experts in the technology. When we get to other issues which are involved, then political and economic and ethical concerns come in, and scientists are just citizens in those areas. So scientists shouldn’t be decision makers in how their work is used. But they have a special responsibility to ensure the public is informed. It’s rather like an analysis which my colleague Michael Tier gives: It’s like, if you’ve got teenage kids, you can’t necessarily control what they do, but you’re a poor parent if you don’t care what they do and what happens to them.\n\nLikewise, if you’re a scientist, the ideas you come up with are your creations, as it were, and so you ought to care about what use is made of them, in the same way, even if you can’t control it. And so, in the same way, I think scientists ought to care and should try and inform the public and inform politicians. And in informing politicians, that is better done via the public because if there’s public pressure, then the politicians will take an interest.\n\nAnd incidentally, if the public is to be an informed citizenry, everyone needs to have some feel for science. Because so many of the issues which confront us today — whether it’s health, energy, or environment, or transport — they have a scientific dimension. So if the public debate is to rise above the level of slogans, everyone needs to understand a bit about the science. And the scientists themselves should take a lead in ensuring that that happens. But they should accept that they have no expertise on the politics, the ethics, or the economics.\n\nThis calls for some sort of conversation between hard science and the social sciences. Are you more aware of this in the younger generation? In your students, for example, or in the delegates who attend the Academy of Achievement Summits, are they more receptive to these ideas?\n\nMartin Rees: Yes. I’m an academic, so I have a lot to do with students. It’s gratifying that the younger generation is far more concerned about all these issues of the environment, climate and technological risk than their elders. Not surprising, in a way, because they will still be alive at the end of the century, and so it’s not surprising that they’re concerned. But also, some of the brightest of them do really want to engage very deeply with this.\n\nIn our group at Cambridge, we have managed to get a group of people who are extremely expert, but they don’t want to stick in their stovepipes, they want to interact. So we have a group of people, and two of them had the privilege of participating in the Academy meetings in London just recently, and they are people with backgrounds in law, philosophy, computer science, biosecurity, et cetera. And they realize that they need to get together to address these risks. And of course, it is true that many of them do involve the social sciences, et cetera.\n\nLet me give you one simple example. Supposing that there was a pandemic which spread to the megacities of the developing world, like Mumbai or Lagos or something like that. It would be dreadful, anyway. But does the fact that everyone there now has mobile phones make it better or worse? You could say it allows information and advice to be spread. On the other hand, it allows panic and rumor to spread, literally at the speed of light. And that’s an obvious sociological question. You know, how does one use the media and the IT technologies to help to minimize the risk of other disasters? That’s just one example of where you need to get input from sociologists. But that’s true in many other areas, obviously. You want to decide what aspects of technology are going to take off and what are not going to take off.\n\nIt seems that one important quality in any science, be it astronomy or biology, is patience. Sometimes years can pass before something is proven or disproven. Could you give a little bit of advice for someone interested in science?\n\nMartin Rees: Well, it’s certainly true that many ideas in science have not been tested for many years later. Einstein’s work wasn’t really vindicated in detail until almost a century later. The first evidence came fairly quickly, but the really strong evidence came a century later. Another example was a particle called the Higgs boson, which was predicted by Higgs, and indeed other people, in the 1960s, and was only discovered by a huge instrument — CERN in Geneva — 50 years after it was proposed.\n\nSo there are many cases when you have to wait a long time because it’s often very hard to test some theoretical idea, so theorists have to be patient. I think they should do something else while they’re waiting and not get focused and obsessed with some idea. But of course, many scientists do have to work for literally decades to develop some technology, and I’ve been privileged to know some people who’ve developed space projects, gravitational wave detectors, et cetera. That’s been a literally multi-decade project, with no guarantee of success at the end. I think what I especially admire are the people who persevere, against all the odds, in a long-term project which may not succeed. It’s not surprising that some of those people are rather obsessive in their style because otherwise they wouldn’t be motivated.\n\nBut I think, as a theorist, one can flit from one idea to another. You have an idea and then you go into something else. But if you’re an experimenter developing new techniques, you may literally have to spend years and years on that. And they’re the people who I think we should admire most because they stake a good fraction of their lives on something which may amount to nothing, but they hope it pays off, and it’s wonderful when it does pay off.\n\nWhat are the most important qualities in a young scientist?\n\nMartin Rees: I think, obviously, curiosity and enthusiasm. I think pure intelligence is only one of the qualities that’s needed; it’s certainly not enough. I think the important advice I’d give to a young scientist is to pick your subject and pick your adviser. Because I think what you’ve got to do is find a subject where new things are happening — either new techniques or new observations. Because if you pick some sort of stagnant subject, then you’ll find that you are either tying up the loose ends or you’re trying hard to solve a problem which your predecessors tried and failed to solve. And if you’re not clever, then you won’t do it. Whereas, the thing to do is to work on some topic where the old guys didn’t have your advantages. Where you’ve got more powerful computers, much better data, or new observations, or something else, and therefore you can do something which they never had a chance to do and build on their success. And then you don’t need to be any cleverer than they were to do something really new that is at least as important as what they did.\n\nSo it’s a choice of topic and also the choice of where you work. Because certainly, one thing I find is that the interaction with your contemporaries and colleagues is very stimulating, and it’s important to be in a community where you’re plugged into what’s going on and can toss ideas about with other people. So science is a social activity largely. It’s not solitary.\n\nAlso, it’s a subject where you have to be receptive to new ideas all the time and new techniques, and that’s, incidentally, one reason why young scientists are often better than old scientists. It’s something which interests me about this, that if you look at music and think of the great composers, in many cases, their last works are thought to be their greatest. I guess Rossini is an exception, but that’s true of most of them. And the reason for that is that if you’re a composer, then you’re influenced by musical styles when you’re young, but thereafter, it’s just internal development. Beethoven’s late quartets is a supreme example and all that; it’s internal development, whereas, in science, it’s a communal activity.\n\nIf you are to do good work when you’re old, you’ve got to absorb lots of new techniques and new ideas, and that’s something which is harder for old people than for young people. And that’s why all those scientists often keep going on a plateau. There are few scientists who will claim that their last work was their best work, whereas, of course, for many great composers, and indeed painters, that is the case.\n\nRobots are already having a major impact on the economy. Where will this lead?\n\nMartin Rees: Certainly, robots are becoming more sophisticated, and with artificial intelligence and deep learning, they are able to think for themselves and make judgment for themselves, and that’s why more and more of the jobs which humans do can be done by robots. One place where that’s a huge advantage is in space, of course, where we can send out robot geologists far more cheaply than human geologists.\n\nBut here on Earth, I think it’s important to realize that the jobs that the robots will take over will be not only factory work, where they already do, but also many so-called white-collar jobs, like routine legal work, medical diagnostics, radiology, and things like that — maybe even surgery — and computer coding and things like that.\n\nSo they’ll hollow out that part of the labor market. Indeed, many sort of more manual jobs and craft jobs will be harder to automate. I think plumbing, for instance, will be very hard to automate. You can think about what a plumber has to do to go to your house, poke around, and find where the plumbing is, et cetera. It would be very far in the future when a robot can do that — and also gardening. That’s another thing where humans will have the edge, and so I think, when we consider the effect on the labor market, we should not be too pessimistic about the amount of work. Because we should realize we can redeploy people to do work which helps to make our lives better and where there aren’t enough people now — most importantly, carers for young and old.\n\nNow it’s true that in Japan, they have robots who can help to feed old people, et cetera. But it’s demeaning to think an old person could be looked after entirely by a robot. If you’re a rich person, you’ll want to pay a real carer to look after you. And we ought to use the money earned by the robots to fund enough people in the caring professions to give every old person the kind of care which a rich person who has a choice would provide for him or herself.\n\nSo I think that what we need to do is to ensure that the money that is earned by the robots — or by those who control them — is heavily taxed and redistributed to set up huge numbers of publicly funded, dignified secure jobs for carers for young and old, teaching assistants, custodians, gardeners in public parks, and things like that to make our environment better and to make our lives better and to really help people — especially, the old and the sick. It’s a huge demand, and certainly, even in the more prosperous countries, it’s disgraceful how little of our resources are spent on providing that for the average old or disabled person or for young children of disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nSo there’s huge demand, and we just need to use the money earned by the robots to pay jobs. And that is better than having a sort of a universal wage without requiring any work because there is all this work to be done. And to raise the dignity and status of that sort of work, which is, of course, really important for us human beings, then I think that is the bright opportunity. But this will require a sort of socialist massive redistribution, which I hope will happen in the Scandinavian countries from whom, I think, we can learn far more on these than we can learn certainly from the United States.\n\nDo you have any concern about “runaway robots,” as in some of our most beloved science fiction movies?\n\nMartin Rees: There’s certainly a concern about robots which develop a mind of their own. This is one of the major threats we need to guard against, and this is something which I’m glad to say that most of the people working on AI seem to be mindful of. And indeed, I’ve been gratified that when we are in our university group and have engaged with these issues, we’ve had support with the researchers at DeepMind and other places who are leading in this. So I think there is a concern and a feeling on the part of some that it is not premature to think about trying to regulate the development of AI in a way that we all accept that we have to regulate developments in the biotech area, in order to ensure that the machines don’t develop a mind of their own and certainly don’t develop any goals which are sort of hostile or orthogonal to human desires.\n\nSo I think that’s important. But let’s hope we can manage that, and that’s a fairly long-term concern, I think. Because, although we’ve got to realize how fast advanced intelligence is developing, the ability of robots to engage with the external world is still lagging rather behind. They — robots — are still rather clumsy in moving the pieces on the real chessboard or tying your shoelaces and things like that, even though they can play chess better than a world champion.\n\nSo there’s a long way before robots become really interactive. But then, when that does happen, we’ve got to ensure that they have, sort of, guidelines so that they behave in an ethical way and have common sense. There are lots of examples of this, where people imagine a robot that will look after your kitchen and make your meals for you, and if you’ve got no meat in the fridge, it’ll put your cat in the oven. They’ve got to realize that’s not the right thing to do. And you also have to realize that you have to program that in because there’s no other reason why the robot should know that. So people have to be aware that these machines have no common sense unless we program that in. That’s a big challenge if you want to actually let them loose in our everyday world.\n\nThe other question, of course, that then emerges — which is a more philosophical question — is, “Will the machines have a sort of inner life if they get intelligent enough?” We may have machines which we can talk to, and they may seem rather human, and they respond like in some of the recent movies which have exemplified this. But are they just zombies? We don’t know, and that is, I think, very important for how we treat them. Because if they have an inner life and consciousness, then we’re going to have to start caring about their welfare because we care about other humans fulfilling their potential. We even care about some animal species. We feel that they should be treated in a way that fulfills their natural potential and that they aren’t bored and underutilized, and maybe we should have to think about our machines like that.\n\nAnd a big question is, “Will they always be machines that we turn on and off because they’re just zombies?” Or will they, at some stage, become intelligent entities to which we would have to pay some concern and regard as we would to other humans or animals. That’s a philosophical question. There’s a big debate about whether intelligence is an emergent property when things get sufficiently complex, or whether it’s something which is peculiar to the particular sort of wet hardware that we have inside our skulls.\n\nThank you, Lord Rees, for asking the big questions.\n\nMartin Rees: Thank you very much for listening."
