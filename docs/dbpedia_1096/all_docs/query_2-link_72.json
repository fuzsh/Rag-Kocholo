        "text": "Molecular outflows are expected to play a key role in galaxy evolution at high redshift. To study the impact of outflows on star formation at the epoch of reionization, we performed sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of OH 119 μm toward J2054-0005, a luminous quasar at z = 6.04. The OH line is detected and exhibits a P-Cygni profile that can be fitted with a broad blueshifted absorption component, providing unambiguous evidence of an outflow, and an emission component at near-systemic velocity. The mean and terminal outflow velocities are estimated to be vout ≈ 670 and 1500 km s−1, respectively, making the molecular outflow in this quasar one of the fastest at the epoch of reionization. The OH line is marginally spatially resolved for the first time in a quasar at z > 6, revealing that the outflow extends over the central 2 kpc region. The mass outflow rate is comparable to the star formation rate ( ), indicating rapid (∼107 yr) quenching of star formation. The mass outflow rate in a sample of star-forming galaxies and quasars at 4 < z < 6.4 exhibits a positive correlation with the total infrared luminosity, although the scatter is large. Owing to the high outflow velocity, a large fraction (up to ∼50%) of the outflowing molecular gas may be able to escape from the host galaxy into the intergalactic medium.\n\nAn improved Wiener filtration (WF) method for constructing the ensemble pulsar timescale (EPT) is proposed to solve the existing problems in the WF algorithm. The improvements consist of three parts: (i) adjusting the cross-power spectral density (PSD) and PSD estimated by the weighted average (WA) algorithm by the concept of the energy upper limit; (ii) combining the cross-PSD and WA PSD to form a different signal modulus for the filtration of residuals of different noise levels; and (iii) setting a weight for each residual by a more general algorithm based on the concept of effective power. We use this improved WF method to construct the EPT by both simulated data and observational data from the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array. The results from the simulated data indicate this improved WF can successfully suppress the noise level and reform the common signal. For observational data, this method also successfully detects the fluctuations of International Atomic Time (TAI) and local atomic time TA(NTSC). A stability analysis shows that an EPT will have the potential to reveal the instability of TAI on a scale longer than 7 yr. This improved WF method can also be used to detect and monitor the noise in pulsar timing residuals inversely, by using multiple atomic time standards, which can in turn improve the EPT.\n\nMore than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been detected at multiple bands, which can be viewed as extreme laboratories to investigate the accretion physics and gravity in the immediate vicinity of massive black holes. Future transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of TDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically estimate the detection rate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient all-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting magnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least 1 yr−1 is ≳21.3, 21.2, and 21.5 mag in the u, g, and z bands, respectively. If the limiting magnitude of the all-sky survey can reach ∼25–26 mag in the u, g, and z bands, the detection rate can be up to about several tens to hundreds per year. The discovery and identification of the first image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early warning of the second and other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the pre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE. The additional early-stage information may help to constrain the dynamical and radiation processes involved in the TDEs.\n\nThe tip of the tidal tail, resulting from an encounter between galaxies, features gas concentrations and some star-forming regions, such as tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs). This region provides a unique laboratory for examining the star formation process in a dynamical environment distinct from that of disk galaxies. Using the Nobeyama 45 m telescope, we conducted 12CO(1−0) position-switching observations at the tips of the southern tidal tail in the Antennae galaxies. We detected CO emission not only from the two star-forming TDG candidates but also in regions with no significant star formation. Adopting a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor without helium correction, the H2 gas surface density is ∼5–12 M⊙ pc−2. In most regions, the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio is around unity (0.6–1.9), but we find a region with a high ratio with a 3σ lower limit of >7.2. The star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas is notably low (<0.15 Gyr−1), indicating less active star formation than in both nearby disk galaxies (∼0.5–1.0 Gyr−1) and other TDGs previously observed. Including previous observations, the molecular gas SFEs vary widely among TDGs/tidal tails, from 10−2 to 10 Gyr−1, demonstrating significant variations in star formation activity. Potential factors contributing to the low SFE in the Antennae tail tips include extensive tides and/or the young age of the tail.\n\nWe present a population of 11 of the faintest (>25.5 AB mag) short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. We model their sparse available observations using the stellar population inference code Prospector-β and develop a novel implementation to incorporate the galaxy mass–radius relation. Assuming these hosts are randomly drawn from the galaxy population and conditioning this draw on their observed flux and size in a few photometric bands, we determine that these hosts have dwarf galaxy stellar masses of . This is striking as only 14% of short GRB hosts with previous inferred stellar masses had M* ≲ 109M⊙. We further show these short GRBs have smaller physical and host-normalized offsets than the rest of the population, suggesting that the majority of their neutron star (NS) merger progenitors were retained within their hosts. The presumably shallow potentials of these hosts translate to small escape velocities of ∼5.5–80 km s−1, indicative of either low postsupernova systemic velocities or short inspiral times. While short GRBs with identified dwarf host galaxies now comprise ≈14% of the total Swift-detected population, a number are likely missing in the current population, as larger systemic velocities (observed from the Galactic NS population) would result in highly offset short GRBs and less secure host associations. However, the revelation of a population of short GRBs retained in low-mass host galaxies offers a natural explanation for the observed r-process enrichment via NS mergers in Local Group dwarf galaxies, and has implications for gravitational-wave follow-up strategies.\n\nThe prompt emission, X-ray plateau, and X-ray flares of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be from internal dissipation, and the magnetar as the central engine with propeller fallback accretion is proposed to interpret the observed phenomena of GRBs. In this paper, by systematically searching for X-ray emission observed by Swift/X-ray Telescope, we find that seven robust GRBs include both X-ray flares and plateau emissions with measured redshift. More interestingly, the X-ray flares/bumps for those seven GRBs are simultaneously observed in the gamma-ray band. By adopting the propeller fallback accretion model to fit the observed data, it is found that the free parameters of two GRBs (140512A and 180329B) can be constrained very well, while in the other five cases, more or less, they are not all sufficiently constrained. On the other hand, this requires the conversion efficiency of the propeller to be two or three times higher than that of the spindown dipole radiation of the magnetar. If this is the case, it is contradictory to the expectation from the propeller model: namely, a dirtier ejecta should be less efficient in producing gamma-ray emissions. Our results hint that at least the magnetar central engine with propeller fallback accretion model cannot interpret very well both the GRB X-ray flares simultaneously observed in the gamma-ray band and the X-ray flares of GRBs with a high Lorentz factor.\n\ndeepCR is a deep-learning-based cosmic-ray (CR) rejection framework originally presented by Zhang & Bloom. The original approach requires a dedicated training set that consists of multiple frames of the same fields, enabling automatic CR labeling through comparison with their median coadds. Here, we present a novel training approach that circumvents the need for a dedicated training set, but instead utilizes dark frames and the science images requiring CR removal themselves. During training, CRs present in dark frames are added to the science images, which the network is then trained to identify. In turn, the trained deepCR model can then be applied to identify CRs originally present in the science images. Using this approach, we present a new deepCR model trained on a diverse set of Hubble Space Telescope images taken from resolved galaxies in the Local Group, which is universally applicable across all WFC3/UVIS filters. We introduce a robust approach to determining the threshold for generating binary cosmic-ray masks from predictions from deepCR probability maps. When applied to the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury survey, our new deepCR model added ∼7% of good-quality stars that exhibit distinct features in their color–magnitude diagrams.\n\nSY Cha is a T Tauri star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a large cavity seen in the millimeter continuum but has the spectral energy distribution of a full disk. Here we report the first results from JWST/Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations taken as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO Program. The much improved resolution and sensitivity of MIRI-MRS compared to Spitzer enables a robust analysis of the previously detected H2O, CO, HCN, and CO2 emission as well as a marginal detection of C2H2. We also report the first robust detection of mid-infrared OH and rovibrational CO emission in this source. The derived molecular column densities reveal the inner disk of SY Cha to be rich in both oxygen- and carbon-bearing molecules. This is in contrast to PDS 70, another protoplanetary disk with a large cavity observed with JWST, which displays much weaker line emission. In the SY Cha disk, the continuum, and potentially the line, flux varies substantially between the new JWST observations and archival Spitzer observations, indicative of a highly dynamic inner disk.\n\nMany theories of dark matter beyond the weakly interacting massive particles paradigm feature an enhanced matter power spectrum on subparsec scales, leading to the formation of dense dark matter minihalos. Future local observations are promising to search for and constrain such substructures. The survival probability of these dense minihalos in the Milky Way environment is crucial for interpreting local observations. In this work, we investigate two environmental effects: stellar disruption and (smooth) tidal disruption. These two mechanisms are studied using semianalytic models and idealized N-body simulations. For stellar disruption, we perform a series of N-body simulations of isolated minihalo–star encounters to test and calibrate analytic models of stellar encounters before applying the model to the realistic Milky Way disk environment. For tidal disruption, we perform N-body simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the analytic treatment. Finally, we propose a framework to combine the hierarchical assembly and infall of minihalos to the Milky Way with the late-time disruption mechanisms. We make predictions for the mass functions of minihalos in the Milky Way. The mass survival fraction (at Mmh ≥ 10−12M⊙) of dense dark matter minihalos, e.g., for axion miniclusters and minihalos from early matter domination, is ∼60% with the relatively low-mass, compact population surviving. The survival fraction is insensitive to the detailed model parameters. We discuss various implications of the framework and future direct detection prospects.\n\nM dwarfs are common host stars to exoplanets but often lack atmospheric abundance measurements. Late-M dwarfs are also good analogs to the youngest substellar companions, which share similar Teff ∼ 2300–2800 K. We present atmospheric analyses for the M7.5 companion HIP 55507 B and its K6V primary star with Keck/KPIC high-resolution (R ∼ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. First, by including KPIC relative radial velocities between the primary and secondary in the orbit fit, we improve the dynamical mass precision by 60% and find , putting HIP 55507 B above the stellar–substellar boundary. We also find that HIP 55507 B orbits its K6V primary star with au and e = 0.40 ± 0.04. From atmospheric retrievals of HIP 55507 B, we measure [C/H] = 0.24 ± 0.13, [O/H] = 0.15 ± 0.13, and C/O = 0.67 ± 0.04. Moreover, we strongly detect 13CO (7.8σ significance) and tentatively detect (3.7σ significance) in the companion's atmosphere and measure and after accounting for systematic errors. From a simplified retrieval analysis of HIP 55507 A, we measure and for the primary star. These results demonstrate that HIP 55507 A and B have consistent 12C/13C and 16O/18O to the <1σ level, as expected for a chemically homogeneous binary system. Given the similar flux ratios and separations between HIP 55507 AB and systems with young substellar companions, our results open the door to systematically measuring 13CO and abundances in the atmospheres of substellar or even planetary-mass companions with similar spectral types.\n\nCosmological observations, e.g., cosmic microwave background, have precisely measured the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation on larger scales, but smaller scales are still poorly constrained. Since primordial black holes (PBHs) could form in the very early Universe through the gravitational collapse of primordial density perturbations, constraints on the PBH could encode much information on primordial fluctuations. In this work, we first derive a simple formula for the lensing effect to apply PBH constraints with the monochromatic mass distribution to an extended mass distribution. Then, we investigate the latest fast radio burst observations with this relationship to constrain two kinds of primordial curvature perturbation models on small scales. This suggests that, from the null search result of lensed fast radio bursts in currently available observations, the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbation should be less than 8 × 10−2 at the scale region of 105–106 Mpc−1. This corresponds to an interesting mass range relating to binary black holes detected by LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA and future Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer.\n\nLow-mass (≲1.2 M⊙) main-sequence stars lose angular momentum over time, leading to a decrease in their magnetic activity. The details of this rotation–activity relation remain poorly understood, however. Using observations of members of the ≈700 Myr old Praesepe and Hyades open clusters, we aim to characterize the rotation–activity relation for different tracers of activity at this age. To complement published data, we obtained new optical spectra for 250 Praesepe stars, new X-ray detections for 10, and new rotation periods for 28. These numbers for Hyads are 131, 23, and 137, respectively. The latter increases the number of Hyads with periods by 50%. We used these data to measure the fractional Hα and X-ray luminosities, LHα/Lbol and LX/Lbol, and to calculate Rossby numbers Ro. We found that at ≈700 Myr almost all M dwarfs exhibit Hα emission, with binaries having the same overall color–Hα equivalent width distribution as single stars. In the Ro–LHα/Lbol plane, unsaturated single stars follow a power law with index β = −5.9 ± 0.8 for Ro > 0.3. In the Ro–LX/Lbol plane, we see evidence for supersaturation for single stars with Ro ≲ 0.01, following a power law with index , supporting the hypothesis that the coronae of these stars are being centrifugally stripped. We found that the critical Ro value at which activity saturates is smaller for LX/Lbol than for LHα/Lbol. Finally, we observed an almost 1:1 relation between LHα/Lbol and LX/Lbol, suggesting that both the corona and the chromosphere experience similar magnetic heating.\n\nInvestigating the temperature and density structures of gas in massive protoclusters is crucial for understanding the chemical properties therein. In this study, we present observations of the continuum and thioformaldehyde (H2CS) lines at 345 GHz of 11 massive protoclusters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope. High spatial resolution and sensitivity observations have detected 145 continuum cores from the 11 sources. H2CS line transitions are observed in 72 out of 145 cores, including line-rich cores, warm cores, and cold cores. The H2 column densities of the 72 cores are estimated from the continuum emission, which are larger than the density threshold value for star formation, suggesting that H2CS can be widely distributed in star-forming cores with different physical environments. The rotation temperature and column density of H2CS are derived using the XCLASS software. The results show that the H2CS abundances increase as temperature rises and higher gas temperatures are usually associated with higher H2CS column densities. The abundances of H2CS are positively correlated with its column density, suggesting that the H2CS abundances are enhanced from cold cores, warm cores, and line-rich cores in star-forming regions.\n\nIn this work, we constrain the star-forming properties of all possible sites of incipient high-mass star formation in the Milky Way's Galactic Center. We identify dense structures using the CMZoom 1.3 mm dust continuum catalog of objects with typical radii of ∼0.1 pc, and measure their association with tracers of high-mass star formation. We incorporate compact emission at 8, 21, 24, 25, and 70 μm from the Midcourse Space Experiment, Spitzer, Herschel, and SOFIA, cataloged young stellar objects, and water and methanol masers to characterize each source. We find an incipient star formation rate (SFR) for the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of ∼0.08 M⊙ yr−1 over the next few 105 yr. We calculate upper and lower limits on the CMZ's incipient SFR of ∼0.45 and ∼0.05 M⊙ yr−1,respectively, spanning roughly equal to and several times greater than other estimates of CMZ's recent SFR. Despite substantial uncertainties, our results suggest the incipient SFR in the CMZ may be higher than previously estimated. We find that the prevalence of star formation tracers does not correlate with source volume density, but instead ≳75% of high-mass star formation is found in regions above a column density ratio (NSMA/NHerschel) of ∼1.5. Finally, we highlight the detection of atoll sources, a reoccurring morphology of cold dust encircling evolved infrared sources, possibly representing H ii regions in the process of destroying their envelopes.\n\nMilky Way-type galaxies are surrounded by a warm-hot gaseous halo containing a considerable amount of baryons and metals. The kinematics and spatial distribution of highly ionized ion species such as O vi can be significantly affected by supernova (SN) explosions and early (pre-SN) stellar feedback (e.g., stellar winds, radiation pressure). Here we investigate effects of stellar feedback on O vi absorptions in Milky Way−like galaxies by analyzing the suites of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations under the framework of SMUGGLE, a physically motivated subgrid interstellar medium and stellar feedback model for the moving-mesh code Arepo. We find that the fiducial run with the full suite of stellar feedback and moderate star formation activities can reasonably reproduce Galactic O vi absorptions observed by space telescopes such as the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, including the scale height of low-velocity (∣vLSR∣ < 100 km s−1) O vi, the column density–line width relation for high-velocity (100 km s−1 ≤ ∣vLSR∣ < 400 km s−1) O vi, and the cumulative O vi column densities. In contrast, model variations with more intense star formation activities deviate from observations further. Additionally, we find that the run considering only SN feedback is in broad agreement with the observations, whereas in runs without SN feedback this agreement is absent, which indicates a dominant role of SN feedback in heating and accelerating interstellar O vi. This is consistent with the current picture that interstellar O vi is predominantly produced by collisional ionization where mechanical feedback can play a central role. In contrast, photoionization is negligible for O vi production owing to the lack of high-energy (≳114 eV) photons required.\n\nThe zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) is a critical phase for stellar angular momentum evolution, as stars transition from contraction-dominated spin-up to magnetic wind-dominated spin-down. We present the first robust observational constraints on rotation for FGK stars at ≈40 Myr. We have analyzed TESS light curves for 1410 members of five young open clusters with ages between 25 and 55 Myr: IC 2391, IC 2602, NGC 2451A, NGC 2547, and Collinder 135. In total, we measure 868 rotation periods, including 96 new, high-quality periods for stars around 1 M⊙. This is an increase of ten times the existing literature sample at the ZAMS. We then use the τ2 method to compare our data to models for stellar angular momentum evolution. Although the ages derived from these rotation models do not match isochronal ages, we show that these observations can clearly discriminate between different models for stellar wind torques. Finally, τ2 fits indicate that magnetic braking and/or internal angular momentum transport significantly impact rotational evolution even on the pre-main sequence.\n\nWe present high-cadence ultraviolet through near-infrared observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2023bee at D = 32 ± 3 Mpc, finding excess flux in the first days after explosion, particularly in our 10 minutes cadence TESS light curve and Swift UV data. Compared to a few other normal SNe Ia with early excess flux, the excess flux in SN 2023bee is redder in the UV and less luminous. We present optical spectra of SN 2023bee, including two spectra during the period where the flux excess is dominant. At this time, the spectra are similar to those of other SNe Ia but with weaker Si ii, C ii, and Ca ii absorption lines, perhaps because the excess flux creates a stronger continuum. We compare the data to several theoretical models on the origin of early excess flux in SNe Ia. Interaction with either the companion star or close-in circumstellar material is expected to produce a faster evolution than observed. Radioactive material in the outer layers of the ejecta, either from double detonation explosion or from a 56Ni clump near the surface, cannot fully reproduce the evolution either, likely due to the sensitivity of early UV observable to the treatment of the outer part of ejecta in simulation. We conclude that no current model can adequately explain the full set of observations. We find that a relatively large fraction of nearby, bright SNe Ia with high-cadence observations have some amount of excess flux within a few days of explosion. Considering potential asymmetric emission, the physical cause of this excess flux may be ubiquitous in normal SNe Ia.\n\nWe point out the dominant importance of plasma injection effects of relativistic winds from pulsars and black holes. We demonstrate that outside the light cylinder, the magnetically dominated outflows sliding along the helical magnetic field move nearly radially with very large Lorentz factors, γ0 ≫ 1, imprinted into the flow during pair production within the gaps. Only at larger distances, r ≥ γ0(c/Ω), does MHD acceleration Γ ∝ r take over. As a result, Blandford–Znajek (BZ)-driven outflows produce spine-brightened images. The best-resolved case of the jet in M87 shows both edge-brightened features, as well as weaker spine-brightened features. Only the spine-brightened component can be BZ driven/originate from the black hole's magnetosphere.\n\nWe demonstrate how to constrain the degree of absolute alignment of the total angular momenta of LIGO–Virgo binary black holes, looking for a special direction in space that would break isotropy. We also allow for inhomogeneities in the distribution of black holes over the sky. Making use of dipolar models for the spatial distribution and orientation of the sources, we analyze 57 signals with false-alarm rates ≤1 yr−1 from the third LIGO–Virgo observing run. Accounting for selection biases, we find the population of LIGO–Virgo black holes to be consistent with both homogeneity and isotropy. We additionally find the data to constrain some directions of alignment more than others, discuss the interpretation of this measurement, and produce posteriors for the directions of total angular momentum of all binaries in our set. While our current constraints are weak, the fact that such a small number of detections can already yield a measurement suggests that this will be a powerful tool in the future; we explore this prospect with a number of simulated catalogs of varying size. All code and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/maxisi/gwisotropy/.\n\nRCB stars are L ≈ 104L⊙ solar-mass objects that can exhibit large periods of extinction from dust ejection episodes. Many exhibit semi-regular pulsations in the range of 30–50 days with semi-amplitudes of 0.05–0.3 mag. Space-based photometry has discovered that solar-like oscillations are ubiquitous in hydrogen-dominated stars that have substantial outer convective envelopes, so we explore the hypothesis that the pulsations in RCB stars and the closely related dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars, which have large convective outer envelopes of nearly pure helium, have a similar origin. Through stellar modeling and pulsation calculations, we find that the observed periods and amplitudes of these pulsations follows the well-measured phenomenology of their H-rich brethren. In particular, we show that the observed modes are likely of angular orders l = 0, 1, and 2 and predominantly of an acoustic nature (i.e., p-modes with low radial order). The modes with largest amplitude are near the acoustic cutoff frequency appropriately rescaled to the helium-dominated envelope, and the observed amplitudes are consistent with that seen in high-luminosity (L > 103L⊙) H-rich giants. We also find that for Teff ≳ 5400 K, an hydrogen-deficient carbon stellar model exhibits a radiative layer between two outer convective zones, creating a g-mode cavity that supports much longer period (≈100 days) oscillations. Our initial work was focused primarily on the adiabatic modes, but we expect that subsequent space-based observations of these targets (e.g., with TESS or Plato) are likely to lead to a larger set of detected frequencies that would allow for a deeper study of the interiors of these rare stars.\n\nGravitational coupling between large- and small-scale density perturbations leads to anisotropic distortions to local small-scale matter fluctuations. Such local anisotropic distortions can be used to reconstruct large-scale matter distribution, known as tidal reconstruction. In this paper, we apply the tidal reconstruction methods to simulated galaxies in redshift space. We find that redshift-space distortions (RSDs) lead to anisotropic reconstruction results. While the reconstructed radial modes are more noisy mainly due to the small-scale velocity dispersion, the transverse modes are still reconstructed with high fidelity, and well correlated with the original large-scale density modes. The bias of the reconstructed field at large scales shows a simple angular dependence, which can be described by a form similar to that of the linear RSD. The noise power spectrum is nearly isotropic and scale independent on large scales. This makes the reconstructed tide fields an ideal tracer for cosmic variance cancellation and multi-tracer analysis and has profound implications for future 21 cm intensity mapping surveys.\n\nIn this paper, we present a long-term multiwavelength investigation focusing on 12 distinct samples of Fermi-4LAC bright flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Detailed variability and spectral analyses of γ-ray, X-ray, and ultraviolet/optical data obtained by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope, and the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope were performed over a period of about 14 yr, spanning from 2008 October to 2022 October. These analyses provide insights into characterizing the variations within different activity states. To efficiently reproduce the multiwavelength simultaneous/quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the samples, we propose a novel approach for constraining the model parameters. By analyzing the parameters of the energy spectral curvature (β), the peak frequency (νpk), the peak luminosity (Lpk), the Compton dominance parameter (AC), and the variability timescale (tvar) in different activity states, we can estimate the values of the jet radiation region parameters for the samples. Subsequently, we utilize the synchrotron-self-Compton and external Compton processes, employing a logarithmic-parabolic spectral shape to approximate the observed spectra of the sample sources, while considering the induced regime for the physical parameters. The model results show that: (1) by effectively reproducing SEDs in various active states of bright FSRQs, the parameters within the emission region were reasonably constrained; (2) compared to other active states, the emission region of the jet exhibits a reduced radius during the high state, while the magnetic field strength increases during the low state; and (3) for bright FSRQs in a high-activity state, there is an enhancement of the Doppler factor, often exhibiting a tendency toward energy equipartition.\n\nTo observe meteorite ablation, simulation experiments were conducted on the L5 ordinary chondrite and IAB-MG iron meteorites in an arc-heated facility and three flight conditions were reproduced. To mimic the high heating rates and the significant shear stress that meteorites experience during Earth entry, the samples were machined into 9° spherical cones with a 20 mm nose radius. High-quality video, the surface temperature, a time-resolved spectrum, and infrared video were recorded. The atom species were determined via spectroscopy to analyze the ablation products. Due to the electrode erosion and dissociation of air, the atomic lines of copper, nitrogen, and oxygen were detected in all the tests. Although the copper atom is a pollutant to the flow field, the five copper lines were used to determine the flow-field temperature. The ablation rates and effective heat of ablation of both the samples were measured under different conditions. The results indicate that shear stress is the dominant factor influencing meteorite ablation. Furthermore, the diversity between stony and iron meteorites suggests that the mass loss of stony meteorites depends on the fragmentation of the main body and that of iron meteorites depends on the shearing loss of the molten layer. Then, the fusion crusts were analyzed, the microstructures of the samples were obtained, the crust thicknesses were measured, and the elemental distribution of the stony meteorites was determined via energy dispersion spectroscopy. The study results explain the differences in the ablation and recrystallization process between stony and iron meteorites.\n\nWe report detections of the [O iii]λ4364 auroral emission line for 16 galaxies at z = 2.1–8.7, measured from JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey program. We combine this CEERS sample with 9 objects from the literature at z = 4−9 with auroral-line detections from JWST/NIRSpec and 21 galaxies at z = 1.4−3.7 with auroral-line detections from ground-based spectroscopy. We derive electron temperature (Te) and direct-method oxygen abundances for the combined sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at z = 1.4−8.7. We use these measurements to construct the first high-redshift empirical Te-based metallicity calibrations for the strong-line ratios [O iii]/Hβ, [O ii]/Hβ, R23 = ([O iii]+[O ii])/Hβ, [O iii]/[O ii], and [Ne iii]/[O ii]. These new calibrations are valid over 12+log(O/H) = 7.4−8.3 and can be applied to samples of star-forming galaxies at z = 2−9, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of metallicity determinations at Cosmic Noon and in the Epoch of Reionization. The high-redshift strong-line relations are offset from calibrations based on typical z ∼ 0 galaxies or H ii regions, reflecting the known evolution of ionization conditions between z ∼ 0 and z ∼ 2. Deep spectroscopic programs with JWST/NIRSpec promise to improve statistics at the low and high ends of the metallicity range covered by the current sample, as well as to improve the detection rate of [N ii]λ6585 and thus allow the future assessment of N-based indicators. These new high-redshift calibrations will enable accurate characterizations of metallicity scaling relations at high redshift, improving our understanding of feedback and baryon cycling in the early Universe.\n\nWe study the toroidal magnetic flux budget of the axisymmetric part of a data-driven 3D mean-field dynamo model of Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The model simulates the global solar dynamo that includes the effects of the formation and evolution of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) emerging on the solar surface. By applying Stokes's theorem to the dynamo induction equation, we show that the hemispheric magnitude of the net axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field generation rate in the bulk of the convection zone can only partially be estimated from the surface parameters of the differential rotation and the axisymmetric radial magnetic field. The contribution of the radial integral along the equator, which is mostly due to the rotational radial shear at the bottom of the convection zone, has the same magnitude and is nearly in phase with the effect of the surface latitudinal differential rotation. Also, the toroidal field generation rate estimate strongly depends on the latitudinal profile of the surface radial magnetic field near the poles. This profile in our dynamo models significantly deviates from the polar magnetic field distribution observed during the minima of Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. The cause of this discrepancy requires further observational and theoretical studies. Comparing the 2D axisymmetric and the 3D nonaxisymmetric dynamo models, we find an increase in the toroidal field generation rate in the 3D model due to the surface effects of BMRs, resulting in an increase in the axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field magnitude.\n\nIn the last decades, an increasing scientific interest has been growing in the elusive population of dark (i.e., lacking an optical/near-IR, hereafter NIR, counterpart) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Although extremely promising for their likely contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and for their possible role in the evolution of the first massive and passive galaxies around z ∼ 3, the difficulty in selecting statistically significant samples of dark DSFGs is limiting their scientific potentialities. This work presents the first panchromatic study of a sample of 263 radio-selected NIR-dark (RS-NIRdark) galaxies discovered in the COSMOS field following the procedure by Talia et al. These sources are selected as radio-bright galaxies (S3 GHz > 12.65 μJy) with no counterpart in the NIR-selected COSMOS2020 catalog (Ks ≳ 25.5 mag). For these sources, we build a new photometric catalog including accurate photometry from the optical to the radio obtained with a new deblending pipeline (Photometry Extractor for Blended Objects, or PhoEBO). We employ this catalog to estimate the photo-zs and the physical properties of the galaxies through an spectral energy distribution-fitting procedure performed with two different codes (Magphys and Cigale). Finally, we estimate the active galactic nucleus contamination in our sample by performing a series of complementary tests. The high values of the median extinction (Av ∼ 4) and star formation rate (SFR ∼ 500 M⊙ yr−1) confirm the likely DSFG nature of the RS-NIRdark galaxies. The median photo-z (z ∼ 3) and the presence of a significant tail of high-z candidates (z > 4.5) suggest that these sources are important contributors to the cosmic SFRD and the evolutionary path of galaxies at high redshifts.\n\nStellar counterrotation in disk galaxies directly relates to the complex phenomenon of the disk mass assembly believed to be driven by external processes, such as accretion and mergers. The study of such systems makes it possible to reveal the source of external accretion and establish the details of this process. In this paper, we investigate the galaxy PGC 66551 (MaNGA ID 1-179561), which hosts two large-scale counterrotating (CR) stellar disks identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey MaNGA data and then confirmed using deep follow-up spectroscopy with the 10 m Southern African Large Telescope. We measured the properties of ionized gas and stellar populations of both CR disks in PGC 66551. We found that the CR disk is compact, contains young stars with subsolar metallicity, and has a stellar mass of 5 × 109M⊙, which amounts to ≈20% of the galaxy's total. Surprisingly, the main 8 Gyr old disk has a significantly lower metallicity of −0.8 dex than other CR galaxies. We developed a simple analytic model of the history of the metal enrichment, which we applied to PGC 66551 and constrained the parameters of the galactic outflow wind, and estimated the metallicity of the infalling gas that formed the CR disk to be −0.9... −0.5 dex. Our interpretation prefers a merger with a gas-rich satellite over cold accretion from a cosmic filament as a source of gas, which then formed the CR disk in PGC 66551.\n\nWe present archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array band 6 observations of the 13CO (J = 2–1) and 12CO (J = 2–1) molecular line emission of the protostellar system associated with HH 30. The 13CO molecular line shows the accretion disk while the molecular outflow is traced by the emission of the 12CO molecular line. We estimated a dynamical mass for the central object of 0.45 ± 0.14 M⊙, and a mass for the molecular outflow of (1.83 ± 0.19) × 10−4M⊙. The molecular outflow presents an internal cavity as well as multiple outflowing shell structures. We distinguish three different shells with constant expansion (∼4–6 km s−1) and possible rotation signatures (≤0.5 km s−1). We find that the shells can be explained by magnetocentrifugal disk winds with launching radii Rlaunch ≲ 4 au and a small magnetic lever arm λ ∼ 1.6–1.9. The multiple shell structure may be the result of episodic ejections of the material from the accretion disk associated with three different epochs with dynamical ages of 497 ± 15 yr, 310 ± 9 yr, and 262 ± 11 yr for the first, second, and third shells, respectively. The outermost shell was ejected 187 ± 17 yr before the middle shell, while the middle shell was launched 48 ± 14 yr before the innermost shell. Our estimations of the linear and angular momentum rates of the outflow as well as the accretion luminosity are consistent with the values expected if the outflow of HH 30 is produced by a wide-angle disk wind.\n\nWe analyze the circumgalactic medium (CGM) for eight commonly-used cosmological codes in the AGORA collaboration. The codes are calibrated to use identical initial conditions, cosmology, heating and cooling, and star formation thresholds, but each evolves with its own unique code architecture and stellar feedback implementation. Here, we analyze the results of these simulations in terms of the structure, composition, and phase dynamics of the CGM. We show properties such as metal distribution, ionization levels, and kinematics are effective tracers of the effects of the different code feedback and implementation methods, and as such they can be highly divergent between simulations. This is merely a fiducial set of models, against which we will in the future compare multiple feedback recipes for each code. Nevertheless, we find that the large parameter space these simulations establish can help disentangle the different variables that affect observable quantities in the CGM, e.g., showing that abundances for ions with higher ionization energy are more strongly determined by the simulation's metallicity, while abundances for ions with lower ionization energy are more strongly determined by the gas density and temperature.\n\nThe first science image released by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveals numerous galaxies in the distant background of the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. Some have claimed redshifts of up to z ≃ 20, challenging standard cosmological models for structure formation. Here, we present a lens model for SMACS J0723.3-7327 anchored on five spectroscopically confirmed systems at 1.38 ≤ z ≤ 2.21 that are multiply lensed, along with 12 other systems with proposed image counterparts sharing common colors, spectral energy distributions, and morphological features, but having unknown redshifts. Constrained only by their image positions, and where available, redshifts, our lens model correctly reproduces the positions and correctly predicts the morphologies and relative brightnesses of all these image counterparts, as well as providing geometrically determined redshifts spanning 1.4 ≲ z ≲ 6.7 for the 12 candidate multiply lensed galaxies lacking spectroscopic measurements. From this lens model, we create a lens finder map that defines regions over which galaxies beyond a certain redshift are predicted to be multiply lensed. Applying this map to three galaxies claimed to be at 10 ≲ z ≲ 20, we find no image counterparts at locations (with an uncertainty of ∼0 5) where they ought to be sufficiently magnified to be detectable—suggesting instead that these galaxies lie at z ≲ 1.7–3.2. In lieu of spectroscopy, the creation of reliable lens finder maps for cluster fields is urgently needed to test and constrain redshifts inferred from photometry for a rapidly increasing number of candidate high-z galaxies found with JWST.\n\nBoth observational evidence and theoretical considerations from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets suggest that the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are radially stratified, with a fast inner spine surrounded by a slower-moving outer sheath. The resulting relativistic shear layers are a prime candidate for the site of relativistic particle acceleration in the jets of AGNs and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this article, we present outcomes of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic-field generation and particle acceleration in the relativistic shear boundary layers (SBLs) of jets in AGNs and GRBs. We investigate the effects of inverse Compton cooling on relativistic particles that are accelerated in the SBLs of relativistic jets, including the self-consistent calculation of the radiation spectrum produced by inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons in an isotropic external soft photon field. We find that the Compton cooling can be substantial, depending on the characteristic energy (blackbody temperature and energy density) of the external radiation field. The produced Compton emission is highly anisotropic and more strongly beamed along the jet direction than the characteristic 1/Γ pattern expected from intrinsically isotropic emission in the comoving frame of an emission region moving along the jet with a bulk Lorentz factor Γ. We suggest that this may resolve the long-standing problem of the Doppler factor crisis.\n\nThe gas-phase reactions of methanimine (CH2NH) with small radicals, such as CN, CP, CCH, and OH, have been extensively studied theoretically in the literature, and the presence of a common, general reaction mechanism has been postulated. Since methanimine is considered the main precursor of complex imines in the interstellar medium (ISM), the present study extends the investigation of its reaction with other small radicals that have already been detected in the ISM. These are SiN, SH, NO, NS, HCO, HCS, and C3N. The corresponding products are easily formulated on the basis of the aforementioned general mechanism, and to understand whether they can be formed in the ISM, a preliminary thermochemical study has been carried out. The only exothermic addition reaction is that occurring between CH2NH and the C3N radical. This reaction has been further investigated in order to accurately characterize its reactive potential energy surface, which has then been employed in ab initio transition state theory calculations to derive global rate coefficients. The products of the CH2NH + C3N reaction are new potential interstellar species, namely, the Z and E isomers of HNCHCCCN and CH2NCCCN. For the first time, their structural characterization has been reported. In addition, this work investigates the possibility of H-abstraction processes for each radical species considered, and re-examines the CH2NH + CP reaction to derive the corresponding rate constants, that were still missing in the literature.\n\nIn kilonovae, freshly synthesized r-process elements imprint features on optical spectra, as observed in AT2017gfo, the counterpart to the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. However, measuring the r-process compositions of the merger ejecta is computationally challenging. Vieira et al. introduced Spectroscopic r-process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), a software tool to infer elemental abundance patterns of the ejecta and associate spectral features with particular species. Previously, we applied SPARK to the 1.4-day spectrum of AT2017gfo and inferred its abundance pattern for the first time, characterized by electron fraction Ye = 0.31, a substantial abundance of strontium, and a dearth of lanthanides and heavier elements. This ejecta is consistent with wind from a remnant hypermassive neutron star and/or accretion disk. We now extend our inference to spectra at 2.4 and 3.4 days and test the need for multicomponent ejecta, where we stratify the ejecta in composition. The ejecta at 1.4 and 2.4 days is described by the same single blue component. At 3.4 days, a new redder component with lower Ye = 0.16 and a significant abundance of lanthanides emerges. This new redder component is consistent with dynamical ejecta and/or neutron-rich ejecta from a magnetized accretion disk. As expected from photometric modeling, this component emerges as the ejecta expands, the photosphere recedes, and the earlier bluer component dims. At 3.4 days, we find an ensemble of lanthanides, with the presence of cerium most concrete. This presence of lanthanides has important implications for the contribution of kilonovae to the r-process abundances observed in the Universe.\n\nX-ray binary systems consist of a companion star and a compact object in close orbit. Thanks to their copious X-ray emission, these objects have been studied in detail using X-ray spectroscopy and timing. The inclination of these systems is a major uncertainty in the determination of the mass of the compact object using optical spectroscopic methods. In this paper, we present a new method to constrain the inclination of X-ray binaries, which is based on the modeling of the polarization of X-rays photons produced by a compact source and scattered off the companion star. We describe our method and explore the potential of this technique in the specific case of the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826−238 observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observatory.\n\nThe field of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has entered the age of fine characterization as observational results from different radio telescopes become more and more abundant. The large FRB sample is suitable for a statistical study. There is an interesting finding that the waiting-time distributions of very active repeating FRBs show a universal double-peaked feature, with left peaks lower than right ones. Assuming these two peaks are independent and initially comparable, we show that the observed asymmetric shape can be ascribed to the propagational effect in the magnetosphere. An FRB passing through the magnetized plasma will induce the circular motion of charged particles to form a current loop. This further leads to an induced magnetic field in the opposite direction with respect to the background field. As the effective field strength changes, the scattering absorption probability of the following FRB will be influenced. The absorption can be important under certain physical conditions and bursts with smaller time lags are easier to be absorbed. Also, there will be an imprint on the flux distribution as the scattering optical depth depends on burst luminosity as well.\n\nWe describe the survey design and science goals for One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN), a NOIRLab survey using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to obtain deep (AB ∼ 25.7) narrowband images over an unprecedented area of sky. The three custom-built narrowband filters, N419, N501, and N673, have central wavelengths of 419, 501, and 673 nm and respective FWHM of 7.5, 7.6, and 10.0 nm, corresponding to Lyα at z = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 and cosmic times of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. When combined with even deeper, public broadband data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam, DECam, and in the future, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, the ODIN narrowband images will enable the selection of over 100,000 Lyα-emitting (LAE) galaxies at these epochs. ODIN-selected LAEs will identify protoclusters as galaxy overdensities, and the deep narrowband images enable detection of highly extended Lyα blobs (LABs). Primary science goals include measuring the clustering strength and dark matter halo connection of LAEs, LABs, and protoclusters, and their respective relationship to filaments in the cosmic web. The three epochs allow for the redshift evolution of these properties to be determined during the period known as Cosmic Noon, where star formation was at its peak. The narrowband filter wavelengths are designed to enable interloper rejection and further scientific studies by revealing [O ii] and [O iii] at z = 0.34, Lyα and He ii 1640 at z = 3.1, and Lyman continuum plus Lyα at z = 4.5. Ancillary science includes similar studies of the lower-redshift emission-line galaxy samples and investigations of nearby star-forming galaxies resolved into numerous [O iii] and [S ii] emitting regions.\n\nAlfvénicity is a well-known property, common in the solar wind, characterized by a high correlation between magnetic and velocity fluctuations. Data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) enable the study of this property closer to the Sun than ever before, as well as in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind. We consider scale-dependent measures of Alfvénicity based on second-order functions of the magnetic and velocity increments as a function of time lag, including the normalized cross helicity σc and residual energy σr. Scale-dependent Alfvénicity is strongest for lags near the correlation scale and increases when moving closer to the Sun. We find that σr typically remains close to the maximally negative value compatible with σc. We did not observe significant changes in measures of Alfvénicity between sub-Alfvénic and super-Alfvénic wind. During most times, the solar wind was highly Alfvénic; however, lower Alfvénicity was observed when PSP approached the heliospheric current sheet or other magnetic structures with sudden changes in the radial magnetic field, non-unidirectional strahl electron pitch angle distributions, and strong electron density contrasts. These results are consistent with a picture in which Alfvénic fluctuations generated near the photosphere transport outward, forming highly Alfvénic states in the young solar wind, and subsequent interactions with large-scale structures and gradients lead to weaker Alfvénicity, as commonly observed at larger heliocentric distances.\n\nVariability in the brightness of young stellar objects (YSOs) is a common phenomenon that can be caused by changes in various factors, including accretion, extinction, disk morphology, interactions between the disk and the stellar photosphere, and the rotation of hot or cold magnetic spots on the stellar photosphere. Analyzing the variability on different timescales provides insight into the mechanisms driving the changes in the brightness of YSOs. We investigate the variability of YSOs on both long and short timescales using two mid-IR data sets: the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) 7.5 yr W2 (4.6 μm) data and the YSOVAR 40 day Spitzer/IRAC2 (4.5 μm) data, respectively. We classify the variability types in each timescale following Park et al. We find a higher detection rate of variable sources in the short term (77.6%) compared to the long term (43.0%) due to the higher sensitivity of the Spitzer observations. In addition, the higher cadence of the YSOVAR data results in the weeks-long short-term variability being mostly secular, while the years-long long-term variability explored with the coarsely sampled NEOWISE data is mostly stochastic. By crossmatching the two catalogs, we statistically analyze the variability types exhibited by YSOs across both timescales. The long-term variability amplitude is mostly three times (up to 10 times) greater than the short-term variability. Furthermore, we evaluate variability on very short (1–2 days) timescales and recover a trend of the increasing amplitude of variability as the timescales increase. By comprehensively analyzing the variability of YSOs over various timescales, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving their variability.\n\nMagnetic fields of molecular clouds in the central molecular zone (CMZ) have been relatively under-observed at sub-parsec resolution. Here, we report JCMT/POL2 observations of polarized dust emission in the CMZ, which reveal magnetic field structures in dense gas at ∼0.5 pc resolution. The 11 molecular clouds in our sample include two in the western part of the CMZ (Sgr C and a farside cloud candidate), four around the Galactic longitude 0 (the 50 km s−1 cloud, CO 0.02−0.02, the Stone, and the SticksandStraw among the Three Little Pigs), and five along the Dust Ridge (G0.253+0.016, clouds b, c, d, and e/f), for each of which we estimate the magnetic field strength using the angular dispersion function method. The morphologies of magnetic fields in the clouds suggest potential imprints of feedback from expanding H ii regions and young massive star clusters. A moderate correlation between the total viral parameter versus the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense gas fraction of the clouds is found. A weak correlation between the mass-to-flux ratio and the SFR, and a weak anticorrelation between the magnetic field and the dense gas fraction are also found. Comparisons between magnetic fields and other dynamic components in clouds suggest a more dominant role of self-gravity and turbulence in determining the dynamical states of the clouds and affecting star formation at the studied scales.\n\nWe present the first detailed analysis of the ultra-steep spectrum radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster A521, based on upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope observations. The combination of radio observations (300–850 MHz) and archival X-ray data provides a new window into the complex physics occurring in this system. When compared to all previous analyses, our sensitive radio images detected the centrally located radio halo emission to a greater extent of ∼1.3 Mpc. A faint extension of the southeastern radio relic has been discovered. We detected another relic, recently discovered by MeerKAT, and coincident with a possible shock front in the X-rays, at the northwest position of the center. We find that the integrated spectrum of the radio halo is well-fitted with a spectral index of −1.86 ± 0.12. A spatially resolved spectral index map revealed the spectral index fluctuations, as well as an outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. The radio and X-ray surface brightness is well correlated for the entire and different subparts of the halo, with sublinear correlation slopes (0.50–0.65). We also found a mild anticorrelation between the spectral index and X-ray surface brightness. Newly detected extensions of the SE relic and the counter relic are consistent with the merger in the plane of the sky.\n\nWe present a robust methodology for identifying photometric binaries in star clusters. Using Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and Two Micron All Sky Survey data, we self-consistently define the cluster parameters and binary demographics for the open clusters (OCs) NGC 2168 (M35), NGC 7789, NGC 6819, NGC 2682 (M67), NGC 188, and NGC 6791. These clusters span in age from ∼200 Myr (NGC 2168) to more than ∼8 Gyr (NGC 6791) and have all been extensively studied in the literature. We use the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution software suite to derive the age, distance, reddening, metallicity, binary fraction, and binary mass-ratio posterior distributions for each cluster. We perform a careful analysis of our completeness and also compare our results to previous spectroscopic surveys. For our sample of main-sequence stars with masses between 0.6 and 1 M⊙, we find that these OCs have similar binary fractions that are also broadly consistent with the field multiplicity fraction. Within the clusters, the binary fraction increases dramatically toward the cluster centers, likely a result of mass segregation. Furthermore nearly all clusters show evidence of mass segregation within the single and binary populations. The OC binary fraction increases significantly with cluster age in our sample, possibly due to a combination of mass-segregation and cluster-dissolution processes. We also find a hint of an anticorrelation between binary fraction and cluster central density as well as total cluster mass, possibly due to an increasing frequency of higher-energy close stellar encounters that inhibit long-period binary survival and/or formation.\n\nWe propose a mechanism for the excitation of large-scale quasiperiodic fast-propagating magnetoacoustic (QFP) waves observed on both sides of the coronal mass ejection. Through a series of numerical experiments, we successfully simulated the quasi-static evolution of the equilibrium locations of the magnetic flux rope in response to the change of the background magnetic field, as well as the consequent loss of the equilibrium that eventually gives rise to the eruption. During the eruption, we identified QFP waves propagating radially outward of the flux rope, and tracing their origin reveals that they result from the disturbance within the flux rope. Acting as an imperfect waveguide, the flux rope allows the internal disturbance to escape to the outside successively via its surface, invoking the observed QFP waves. Furthermore, we synthesized the images of QFP waves on the basis of the data given by our simulations and found consistency with observations. This indicates that the leakage of the disturbance outside the flux rope could be a reasonable mechanism for QFP waves.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the anisotropy is of great value to decipher cosmic rays' origin and propagation. We have built a unified scenario to describe the observations of the energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy and called attention to their synchronous evolution with energy. In this work, the impact of the local regular magnetic field (LRMF) and corresponding anisotropic diffusion on large-scale anisotropy have been investigated. When the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is much smaller than the parallel one, the dipole anisotropy points to the LRMF and the observational phase below 100 TeV could be reproduced. Moreover, we find that the dipole phase above 100 TeV strongly depends on the evolution of local diffusion. But the current measurements at that energy are still scarce. We suggest that more precise measurements at that energy could be carried out to unveil the local diffusion and further the local turbulence.\n\nHeartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal laboratories for studying the effect of equilibrium and dynamical tides. However, studies of TEOs in Kepler HBSs are rare due to the need for better modeling of the equilibrium tide in light curves. We revisit the HBSs in our previous work and study the TEOs in these HBSs based on the derived orbital parameters that could express the equilibrium tide. We also compile a set of analytic procedures to examine the harmonic and anharmonic TEOs in their Fourier spectra. The TEOs of 21 HBSs have been newly analyzed and presented. Twelve of these HBSs show prominent TEOs (signal-to-noise ratio of the harmonics S/N ≥ 10). The relation between the orbital eccentricities and the harmonic number of the TEOs shows a positive correlation. The relation between the orbital periods and the harmonic number also shows a positive correlation. Furthermore, the distribution of HBSs with TEOs in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram shows that TEOs are more visible in hot stars with surface effective temperatures T ≳ 6500 K. These samples may also be valuable targets for future studies of the effect of tidal action in eccentric orbits.\n\nWe present a study of the influence of solar UV anisotropy on the heliospheric backscatter helioglow generated by resonant scattering of solar Lyα photons on interstellar hydrogen atoms around the Sun. Simulations based on the WawHelioGlow model suggest that the response of the helioglow pole-to-ecliptic ratio to the anisotropy is linear, but 15% of the anisotropy (polar darkening) generates 30%–40% change in the ratio in the solar minimum and 15%–20% in the solar maximum. We attribute this difference to an interplay between the solar UV anisotropy and the latitudinal structure of the solar wind in solar minima. The solar UV anisotropy also increases the helioglow intensity from the downwind direction by 5%–10%, due to the influence of the anisotropy on the ionization losses and trajectories of atoms passing by the Sun in polar regions. Consequently, midlatitude regions (in the heliographic and ecliptic coordinates) are least affected by the UV anisotropy. By comparison of the simulation results with observations of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/SWAN satellite instrument, we derive the day-by-day time evolution of the solar Lyα anisotropy for the north and south poles over two solar cycles from 1996 to 2022. The inferred anisotropy is ∼5%–10% in solar minima and ∼15%–25% in solar maxima, the northern anisotropy being stronger than the southern one. Our study suggests that in solar minima a highly structured solar wind is associated with relatively small solar UV anisotropy, while in solar maxima the solar wind is more isotropic but a substantial solar UV anisotropy appears.\n\nNearby radio galaxies (RGs) of Fanaroff–Riley Class I (FR-I) are considered possible sites for the production of observed ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Among those, some exhibit blazar-like inner jets, while others display plume-like structures. We reproduce the flow dynamics of FR-I jets using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, we track the transport and energization of cosmic ray (CR) particles within the simulated jet flows using Monte Carlo simulations. The key determinant of flow dynamics is the mean Lorentz factor of the jet-spine flow, 〈Γ〉spine. When 〈Γ〉spine ≳ 6, the jet spine remains almost unimpeded, but for 〈Γ〉spine ≲ 3, substantial jet deceleration occurs. CRs gain energy mainly through diffusive shock acceleration for E ≲ 1 EeV and shear acceleration for E ≳ 1 EeV. The time-asymptotic energy spectrum of CRs escaping from the jet can be modeled by a double power law, transitioning from ∼E−0.6 to ∼E−2.6 around a break energy, Ebreak, with an exponential cutoff at . Ebreak is limited either by the Hillas confinement condition or by particle escape from the cocoon via fast spatial diffusion. The spectral slopes primarily arise from multiple episodes of shock and relativistic shear acceleration, and the confinement–escape processes within the cocoon. The exponential cutoff is determined by nongradual shear acceleration that boosts the energy of high-energy CRs by a factor of . We suggest that the model spectrum derived in this work could be employed to investigate the contribution of RGs to the observed population of UHECRs.\n\nThe Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission delivers time-series photometry for millions of stars across the sky, offering a probe into stellar astrophysics, including rotation, on a population scale. However, light-curve systematics related to the satellite's 13.7 day orbit have prevented stellar rotation searches for periods longer than 13 days, putting the majority of stars beyond reach. Machine-learning methods have the ability to identify systematics and recover robust signals, enabling us to recover rotation periods up to 35 days for GK dwarfs and 80 days for M dwarfs. We present a catalog of 7245 rotation periods for cool dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, estimated using convolutional neural networks. We find evidence for structure in the period distribution consistent with prior Kepler and K2 results, including a gap in 10–20 day cool-star periods thought to arise from a change in stellar spin-down or activity. Using a combination of spectroscopic and gyrochronologic constraints, we fit stellar evolution models to estimate masses and ages for stars with rotation periods. We find strong correlations between the detectability of rotation in TESS and the effective temperature, age, and metallicity of the stars. Finally, we investigate the relationships between rotation and newly obtained spot filling fractions estimated from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectra. Field starspot filling fractions are elevated in the same temperature and period regime where open clusters' magnetic braking stalls, lending support to an internal shear mechanism that can produce both phenomena.\n\nWe report the discovery of nine new hot molecular cores in the Deep South (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations. We measure the rotational temperature of CH3OH and derive the physical conditions present within these cores and the hot core Sgr B2(S). The cores show heterogeneous temperature structure, with peak temperatures between 252 and 662 K. We find that the cores span a range of masses (203–4842 M⊙) and radii (3587–9436 au). CH3OH abundances consistently increase with temperature across the sample. Our measurements show the DS hot cores are structurally similar to Galactic disk hot cores, with radii and temperature gradients that are comparable to sources in the disk. They also show shallower density gradients than disk hot cores, which may arise from the Central Molecular Zone's higher density threshold for star formation. The hot cores have properties which are consistent with those of Sgr B2(N), with three associated with Class II CH3OH masers and one associated with an ultra-compact H iiregion. Our sample nearly doubles the high-mass star-forming gas mass near Sgr B2(S) and suggests the region may be a younger, comparably massive counterpart to Sgr B2(N) and (M). The relationship between peak CH3OH abundance and rotational temperature traced by our sample and a selection of comparable hot cores is qualitatively consistent with predictions from chemical modeling. However, we observe constant peak abundances at higher temperatures (T ≳ 250 K), which may indicate mechanisms for methanol survival that are not yet accounted for in models.\n\nThe first Population III (Pop III) stars formed out of primordial, metal-free gas, in minihalos at z > 20, and kickstarted the cosmic processes of reionization and enrichment. While these stars are likely more massive than their enriched counterparts, the current unknowns of their astrophysics include when the first Pop III stars ignited, how massive they were, and when and how the era of the first stars ended. Investigating these questions requires an exploration of a multidimensional parameter space, including the slope of the Pop III stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the strength of the nonionizing UV background. In this work, we present a novel model which treats both the slope and maximum mass of Pop III stars as truly free parameters while including the physics of the fragmentation of primordial gas. Our results also hint at a nonuniversal Pop III IMF which is dependent on the efficiency of primordial gas fragmentation. Our relatively simple model reproduces the results from hydrodynamic simulations, but with a computational efficiency which allows us to investigate the observable differences between a wide range of potential Pop III IMFs. In addition, the evolution of the number density of Pop III stars may provide insight into the evolution of the H2 dissociating background. While the slope of the Pop III IMF does not significantly affect the predicted number density of the first stars, more top-heavy IMFs produce Pop III star clusters which are 2–3 magnitudes brighter than their more bottom-heavy counterparts. While the Pop III star clusters are too dim for direct detection by JWST, we find they are within the reach of gravitational lensing.\n\nWe present gas-phase elemental abundance ratios of thirteen local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs), including our new Keck/LRIS spectroscopy determinations together with 33 James Webb Space Telescope z ∼ 4–10 star-forming galaxies in the literature, and compare chemical evolution models. We develop chemical evolution models with the yields of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Type Ia SNe, hypernovae (HNe), and pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and compare the EMPGs and high-z galaxies in conjunction with dust depletion contributions. We find that high Fe/O values of EMPGs can (cannot) be explained by PISN metal enrichments (CCSN/HN enrichments even with the mixing-and-fallback mechanism enhancing iron abundance), while the observed Ar/O and S/O values are much smaller than the predictions of the PISN models. The abundance ratios of EMPGs can be explained by the combination of Type Ia SNe and CCSNe/HNe whose inner layers of argon and sulfur mostly fallback, which are comparable to the Sculptor stellar chemical abundance distribution, suggesting that early chemical enrichment has taken place in the EMPGs. Comparing our chemical evolution models with the star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 4–10, we find that the Ar/O and S/O ratios of the high-z galaxies are comparable to those of the CCSN/HN models, while the majority of high-z galaxies do not have constraints good enough to rule out contributions from PISNe. The high N/O ratio recently reported in GN-z11 cannot be explained even by rotating PISNe, but could be reproduced by the winds of rotating Wolf–Rayet stars that end up as a direct collapse.\n\nUsing integral field spectroscopy (IFS) from MaNGA, we study the resolved microstructures in a shocked region in the Criss-cross Nebula (CCN), with an unprecedentedly high resolution of ≲1000 au. We measure surface brightness maps for 34 emission lines, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) the [O iii] λ5007-like group including seven high-ionization lines and two [O ii] auroral lines that uniformly present a remarkable lane structure, (2) the Hα λ6563-like group, including 23 low-ionization or recombination lines that present a clump-like structure, and (3) [O ii] λ3726 and [O ii] λ3729 showing high densities at both the [O iii] λ5007 lane and the Hα clump. We use these measurements to constrain resolved shock models implemented in MAPPINGS V. We find our data can be reasonably well fitted by a model that includes a plane-parallel shock with a velocity of 133 ± 5 km s −1, plus an isotropic two-dimensional Gaussian component, which is likely another clump of gas ionized by photons from the shocked region, and a constant background. We compare the electron density and temperature profiles as predicted by our model with those calculated using observed emission-line ratios. We find different line ratios to provide inconsistent temperature maps, and the discrepancies can be attributed to observational effects caused by limited spatial resolution and projection of the shock geometry, as well as contamination of the additional Gaussian component. Implications on shock properties and perspectives on future IFS-based studies of the CCN are discussed.\n\nThe Sun is one of the most luminous γ-ray sources in the sky and continues to challenge our understanding of its high-energy emission mechanisms. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the solar disk γ-ray emission, using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope spanning 2008 August to 2022 January. We focus on γ-ray events with energies exceeding 5 GeV, originating from 0 5 angular aperture centered on the Sun, and implement stringent time cuts to minimize potential sample contaminants. We use a helioprojection method to resolve the γ-ray events relative to the solar rotation axes and combine statistical tests to investigate the distribution of events over the solar disk. We found that integrating observations over large time windows may overlook relevant asymmetrical features, which we reveal in this work through a refined time-dependent morphological analysis. We describe significant anisotropic trends and confirm compelling evidence of energy-dependent asymmetry in the solar disk γ-ray emission. Intriguingly, the asymmetric signature coincides with the Sun's polar field flip during the cycle 24 solar maximum, around 2014 June. Our findings suggest that the Sun's magnetic configuration plays a significant role in shaping the resulting γ-ray signature, highlighting a potential link between the observed anisotropies, solar cycle, and the solar magnetic fields. These insights pose substantial challenges to established emission models, prompting fresh perspectives on high-energy solar astrophysics.\n\nThe linear rms–flux relation has been well established in different spectral states of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the frequency-dependent rms–flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial decaying phase of its 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range of 1–150 keV. As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear rms–flux relation at frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying times for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope. Moreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest sensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state transition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time deviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the rms–flux slope and intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system. One component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk–corona coupling before the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to a reduction of disk–corona coupling after the break. A further vertical expansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic evolution observed in the rms–flux slope. In conclusion, we suggest that the rms–flux slope in the 1–150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of disk–corona coupling, and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070 could be partially driven by changes in the coronal geometry.\n\nPSR J1012+5307 is a millisecond pulsar with an extremely low-mass white dwarf (WD) companion in an orbit of 14.5 hr. Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in influencing the orbital evolution of binary systems with a low-mass (≲1–2 M⊙) donor star. At present, there exist several different MB descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the formation of PSR J1012+5307 as a probe to test plausible MB models. Employing a detailed stellar evolution model with the MESA code, we find that the convection- and rotation-boosted MB and \"Intermediate\" MB models can reproduce the WD mass, WD radius, WD surface gravity, neutron star mass, and orbital period observed in PSR J1012+5307. However, our simulated WD has a higher effective temperature than the observations. Three other MB mechanisms, including the standard MB model, are too weak to account for the observed orbital period in the Hubble time. A long cooling timescale caused by H-shell flashes of the WD may alleviate the discrepancy between the simulated effective temperature and the observed value.\n\nRandom sampling in high dimensions has successfully been applied to phenomena as diverse as nuclear resonances, neural networks, and black hole evaporation. Here we revisit an elegant argument by the British physicist Dennis Sciama, who demonstrated that were our Universe random, it would almost certainly have a negligible chance for life. Under plausible assumptions, we show that a random universe can masquerade as \"intelligently designed,\" with the fundamental constants instead appearing to be fined tuned to achieve the highest probability for life to occur. For our Universe, this mechanism may only require there to be around a dozen currently unknown fundamental constants. We speculate on broader applications for the mechanism we uncover.\n\nDetermining the mass of neutron stars is crucial for understanding their formation, evolution, and interior structure. Currently, only a few dozen neutron stars have had their masses measured, and most of them belong to binary systems. However, there are a huge number of isolated neutron stars with unknown masses. Microlensing events with neutron stars provide unique opportunities for knowing these compact objects. Astrometric microlensing with a background source lensed by a neutron star might be used to determine the neutron star's mass by measuring the deviation of the motion of the centroid of the images from its unlensed one. We search and predict these recent and future events based on the Australia Telescope National Facility Pulsar Catalog and Gaia DR3. We find 60 candidate astrometric microlensing events caused by neutron stars and the probability distributions of their observables by the Monte Carlo sampling. We also find four candidate \"timing microlensing\" events with a pulsar lensed by a foreground object that might be detected by timing measurements. While some of these events may be verified by future astrometric missions or pulsar-timing observations, we note that our prediction of these events is significantly restricted by the uncertainties of the available astrometric and timing measurements after assessing and comparing our results with previous works.\n\nUsing archival data from the 42-foot telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we produce daily stacks of aligned giant pulses for the Crab pulsar, to study changes to the daily profiles between 2012 April and 2016 December. From these, we identify echoes, where intervening material away from the line of sight causes pulsed emission to be redirected toward the observer, with delay corresponding to the increased distance of travel, resulting in additional profile components. These observations show that such echoes may be far more common than implied by the previous rate of detections. All the observed echoes are consistent with approaching zero delay at their closest approach to the normal giant pulse emission. This indicates that the structures responsible for producing these events must be highly anisotropic, with typical lengths greater than ∼4 au, typical widths on the sky of ∼0.1 au, and typical depths of ∼5 au, given the previously observed electron densities of the nebular filaments, on the order of 1000 cm−3. This suggests that these inhomogeneities are likely to be offshoot substructure from the larger nebular filaments of the Crab nebula.\n\nWe investigate the properties of voids and void galaxies in the TNG300 simulation. Using a luminous galaxy catalog and a spherical void-finding algorithm, we identify 5078 voids at redshift z = 0. The voids cover 83% of the simulation volume and have a median radius of 4.4 h−1 Mpc. We identify two populations of field galaxies based on whether the galaxies reside within a void (\"void galaxies\"; 75,220 objects) or outside a void (\"nonvoid galaxies\"; 527,454 objects). Within the voids, mass does not directly trace light. Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more \"devoid\" of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids versus voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density. Compared to nonvoid galaxies, void galaxies are on average younger, less massive, bluer in color, less metal enriched, and have smaller radii. In addition, the specific star formation rates of void galaxies are ∼20% higher than nonvoid galaxies and, in the case of galaxies with central supermassive black holes with MBH ≳ 3 × 106h−1 M⊙, the fraction of active void galaxies is ∼25% higher than active nonvoid galaxies.\n\nRobust estimation of star formation rates (SFRs) at higher redshifts (z ≳ 1) using UV–optical–near-infrared (NIR) photometry is contingent on the ability of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to constrain the dust attenuation, stellar metallicity, and star formation history (SFH) simultaneously. IR-derived dust luminosities can help break the degeneracy between these parameters, but IR data are often not available. Here, we explore strategies for SED fitting at z ≳ 1 in the absence of IR data using a sample of log M* > 10.2 star-forming galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) for which 24 μm data are available. We adopt the total IR luminosity (LTIR) obtained from 24 μm as the \"ground truth,\" which allows us to assess how well it can be recovered (as Ldust) from UV–optical–NIR SED fitting. We test a variety of dust attenuation models, stellar population synthesis models, metallicity assumptions, and SFHs separately to identify which assumptions maximize the agreement (correlation and linearity) between LTIR and Ldust. We find that a flexible dust attenuation law performs best. For stellar populations, we find that Bruzual & Charlot models are favored over those of Eldridge et al. Fixing the stellar metallicity at solar value is preferred to other fixed values or leaving it as a free parameter. For SFHs, we find that minimizing the variability in the recent (<100 Myr) SFH improves the agreement with LTIR. Finally, we provide a catalog of galaxy parameters (including M* and SFR) for CANDELS galaxies with and 0.7 < z < 1.3, obtained using the models we found to be the most robust.\n\nWe present cosmological analysis of 12 nearby (z < 0.06) Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. To achieve precise photometry, we present a new image-differencing technique that is implemented for the first time on the ROTSE SN photometry pipeline. With this method, we find up to a 20% increase in the detection efficiency and significant reduction in residual rms scatter of the SN lightcurves when compared to the previous pipeline performance. We use the published optical spectra and broadband photometry of well-studied SNe IIP to establish temporal models for ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature evolution for our SNe IIP population. This study yields measurements that are competitive with other methods even when the data are limited to a single epoch during the photospheric phase of SNe IIP. Using the fully reduced ROTSE photometry and optical spectra, we apply these models to the respective photometric epochs for each SN in the ROTSE IIP sample. This facilitates the use of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to obtain distance estimates to their respective host galaxies. We then perform cosmological parameter fitting using these EPM distances, from which we measure the Hubble constant to be , which is consistent with the standard ΛCDM model values derived using other independent techniques.\n\nA considerable effort has been dedicated recently to the construction of generic equations of state (EOSs) for matter in neutron stars. The advantage of these approaches is that they can provide model-independent information on the interior structure and global properties of neutron stars. Making use of more than 106 generic EOSs, we assess the validity of quasi-universal relations of neutron-star properties for a broad range of rotation rates, from slow rotation up to the mass-shedding limit. In this way, we are able to determine with unprecedented accuracy the quasi-universal maximum-mass ratio between rotating and nonrotating stars and reveal the existence of a new relation for the surface oblateness, i.e., the ratio between the polar and equatorial proper radii. We discuss the impact that our findings have on the imminent detection of new binary neutron-star mergers and how they can be used to set new and more stringent limits on the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars, as well as to improve the modeling of the X-ray emission from the surface of rotating stars.\n\nWe present a new self-consistent semianalytic model of the first stars and galaxies to explore the high-redshift (z ≥ 15) Population III (PopIII) and metal-enriched star formation histories. Our model includes the detailed merger history of dark matter halos generated with Monte Carlo merger trees. We calibrate the minimum halo mass for PopIII star formation from recent hydrodynamical cosmological simulations that simultaneously include the baryon–dark matter streaming velocity, Lyman–Werner (LW) feedback, and molecular hydrogen self-shielding. We find an overall increase in the resulting star formation rate density (SFRD) compared to calibrations based on previous simulations (e.g., the PopIII SFRD is over an order of magnitude higher at z = 35−15). We evaluate the effect of the halo-to-halo scatter in this critical mass and find that it increases the PopIII stellar mass density by a factor ∼1.5 at z ≥ 15. Additionally, we assess the impact of various semianalytic/analytic prescriptions for halo assembly and star formation previously adopted in the literature. For example, we find that models assuming smooth halo growth computed via abundance matching predict SFRDs similar to the merger tree model for our fiducial model parameters, but that they may underestimate the PopIII SFRD in cases of strong LW feedback. Finally, we simulate subvolumes of the Universe with our model both to quantify the reduction in total star formation in numerical simulations due to a lack of density fluctuations on spatial scales larger than the simulation box, and to determine spatial fluctuations in SFRD due to the diversity in halo abundances and merger histories.\n\nThe nature of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions remains an open issue, with several contending progenitor scenarios actively being considered. One such scenario involves an SN Ia explosion inside a planetary nebula (PN) in the aftermath of a stellar merger triggered by a common envelope (CE) episode. We examine this scenario using hydrodynamic and nonequilibrium ionization simulations of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the PN cocoon into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, focusing on the impact of the delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion. We compare the bulk dynamics and X-ray spectra of our simulated SNRs to the observed properties of known Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude that models where the SN explosion happens in the immediate aftermath of the CE episode (with a delay ≲1000 yr) are hard to reconcile with the observations, because the interaction with the dense PN cocoon results in ionization timescales much higher than those found in any known Type Ia SNR. Models with a longer delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion (∼10,000 yr) are closer to the observations, and may be able to explain the bulk properties of some Type Ia SNRs.\n\nThe Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) method is widely used to evaluate magnetic fields in star-forming regions. Yet it remains unclear how well DCF equations estimate the mean plane-of-the-sky field strength in a map region. To address this question, five DCF equations are applied to an idealized cloud map. Its polarization angles have a normal distribution with dispersion σθ, and its density and velocity dispersion have negligible variation. Each DCF equation specifies a global field strength BDCF and a distribution of local DCF estimates. The \"most-likely\" DCF field strength Bml is the distribution mode, for which a correction factor βml ≡ Bml/BDCF is calculated analytically. For each equation, βml < 1, indicating that BDCF is a biased estimator of Bml. The values of βml are βml ≈ 0.7 when due to turbulent excitation of Alfvénic MHD waves, and βml ≈ 0.9 when due to non-Alfvénic MHD waves. These statistical correction factors βml have partial agreement with correction factors obtained from MHD simulations. The relative importance of the statistical correction is estimated by assuming that each simulation correction has both a statistical and a physical component. Then the standard, structure function, and original DCF equations appear most accurate because they require the least physical correction. Their relative physical correction factors are 0.1, 0.3, and 0.4 on a scale from 0 to 1. In contrast, the large-angle and parallel-δB equations have physical correction factors 0.6 and 0.7. These results may be useful in selecting DCF equations, within model limitations.\n\nWe report a faint nonaxisymmetric structure in NGC 1087 through the use of James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera, with an associated kinematic counterpart observed as an oval distortion in the stellar velocity map, Hα, and CO J = 2 → 1 velocity fields. This structure is not evident in the MUSE optical continuum images but only revealed in the near-IR with the F200W and F300M band filters at 2 μm and 3 μm, respectively. Due to its elongation, this structure resembles a stellar bar although with remarkable differences with respect to conventional stellar bars. Most of the near-IR emission is concentrated within 6''∼500 pc with a maximum extension up to 1.2 kpc. The spatial extension of the large-scale noncircular motions is coincident with the bar, which undoubtedly confirms the presence of a nonaxisymmetric perturbation in the potential of NGC 1087. The oval distortion is enhanced in CO due to its dynamically cold nature rather than in Hα. We found that the kinematics in all phases, including stellar, ionized, and molecular, can be described simultaneously by a model containing a bisymmetric perturbation; however, we find that an inflow model of gas along the bar major axis is also likely. Furthermore, the molecular mass inflow rate associated can explain the observed star-formation rate in the bar. This reinforces the idea that bars are mechanisms for transporting gas and triggering star formation. This work contributes to our understanding of nonaxisymmetry in galaxies using the most sophisticated data so far.\n\nVariable accretion has been well studied in the evolved stages of low-mass star formation. However, the accretion history in the initial phases of star formation is still a seldom studied topic. The outflows and jets emerging from protostellar objects could shed some light on their accretion history. We consider the recently studied case of W43-MM1, a protocluster containing 46 outflows driven by 27 protostellar cores. The outflow kinematics of the individual cores and associated knots in W43-MM1 indicate episodic protostellar ejection. We take the observed parameters of an individual core system (core #8) and perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of such a system, including episodic changes in the velocity of the outflow. The simulations consist of a collimated jet emerging from a core, taking into account one- and two-velocity modes in the variation of the ejection velocity of the jet. In addition, we investigated the effect of including the precession of the jet in the one- and two-velocity-mode models. From the simulations, we constructed position–velocity diagrams and compared them with the observations. We find that including a second mode in the ejection velocity, as well as the precession, are required to explain the positions of the outflow knots and other position–velocity features observed in core #8 in W43-MM1.\n\nWe present the main results from a long-term reverberation mapping campaign carried out for the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP). High-quality data were obtained during 2015–2021 for 32 luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs; i.e., continuum luminosity in the range of 1044–46 erg s−1) at a regular cadence, of 20–30 days for spectroscopy and 3–5 days for photometry. We obtain time lag measurements between the variability in the Hβ emission and the continuum for 32 AGNs; 25 of those have the best lag measurements based on our quality assessment, examining correlation strength and the posterior lag distribution. Our study significantly increases the current sample of reverberation-mapped AGNs, particularly at the moderate-to-high-luminosity end. Combining our results with literature measurements, we derive an Hβ broadline region size–luminosity relation with a shallower slope than reported in the literature. For a given luminosity, most of our measured lags are shorter than the expectations, implying that single-epoch black hole mass estimators based on previous calibrations could suffer large systematic uncertainties.\n\nOne of the open questions following the discovery of GW170817 is whether neutron star (NS) mergers are the only astrophysical sites capable of producing r-process elements. Simulations have shown that 0.01–0.1 M⊙ of r-process material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both NS mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of r-process nucleosynthesis in the binary NS merger GW170817 was its long-lasting near-infrared (NIR) emission, thus motivating a systematic photometric study of the light curves of broad-lined stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) associated with collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe Ic-BL—including 18 observed with the Zwicky Transient Facility and 7 from the literature—in the optical/NIR bands to determine what quantity of r-process material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic models designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform light curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe. We also perform independent light curve fits to models without the r-process. We find that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the objects in our sample. Thus, we find no compelling evidence of r-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared photometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to smaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.\n\nWhen modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses have generally focused on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e., more massive) black holes in the binary, while using simplistic prescriptions for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution and its relationship to the primary mass distribution provide a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive stars), their mass distributions may differ. We present the first analysis of the binary black hole population that explicitly fits for the secondary mass distribution. We find that the data is consistent with a ∼30 M⊙ peak existing only in the distribution of secondary rather than primary masses. This would have major implications for our understanding of the formation of these binaries. Alternatively, the data is consistent with the peak existing in both component mass distributions, a possibility not included in most previous studies. In either case, the peak is observed at , which is shifted lower than the value obtained in previous analyses of the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup.\n\nRapid rotation and nonradial pulsations enable Be stars to build decretion disks, where the characteristic line emission forms. A major but unconstrained fraction of Be stars owe their rapid rotation to mass and angular momentum transfer in a binary. The faint, stripped companions can be helium-burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), white dwarfs (WDs), or neutron stars. We present optical/near-infrared Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometry of 37 Be stars selected for spectroscopic indications of low-mass companions. From multiepoch H- and/or K-band interferometry plus radial velocities and parallaxes collected elsewhere, we constructed 3D orbits and derived flux ratios and absolute dynamical masses of both components for six objects, quadrupling the number of anchor points for evolutionary models. In addition, a new wider companion was identified for the known Be + sdO binary 59 Cyg, while auxiliary Very Large Telescope Interferometer/GRAVITY spectrointerferometry confirmed circumstellar matter around the sdO companion to HR 2142. On the other hand, we failed to detect any companion to the six Be stars with γ Cas–like X-ray emission, with sdOB and main-sequence companions of the expected spectroscopic mass being ruled out for the X-ray-prototypical stars γ Cas and π Aqr, leaving elusive WDs as the most likely companions, as well as a likely explanation of the X-rays. No low-mass main-sequence"
