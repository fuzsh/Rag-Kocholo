        "text": "I was born somewhat over a year into the Second World War. My mother had been evacuated from London to Worcester, and after my birth we went to Torquay in the south-west of England; then she returned with me to the East End of London to live with her parents. My father had been conscripted into the army, sent to the south of Greece where he was captured and made to march to a stalag in Germany, thence to a POW camp just outside Graz where he remained for the rest of the war. My mother knew that he must have been either captured or killed; it was a very long time before she was told that he was alive. Most of the prisoners were forced into building a dam, and many of them died in the winter’s cold. My father was fortunate by being a tailor, and stayed inside repairing prisoners’ clothes (and carrying out other, clandestine, tailoring activities). After the war he was first taken to a rehabilitation centre before returning to England and being allowed a short visit home. Thus, I was five years old when first we met. I remember not taking to him at first because he showed much more interest in my mother than in me; I preferred the soldier who had driven my father home, for, not knowing anybody in the family, he played games with me. The situation was exacerbated by my father’s evident disapproval of some of the ways that his son had been brought up, by my grandmother in particular, which I took to be a criticism of me. Hoping that my father was a hero, I asked him how many enemy soldiers he had killed. I was bitterly disappointed when he replied: “I hope none”, and perplexed at the time as to how it could have been a hope. It is probably because I didn’t know him in my most formative years that we never became really close; however, I did develop a great respect for his integrity. My mother loved me dearly, but she never understood how I think.\n\nIt was not until four years later that my brother, Kenneth, was born; my parents considerately waited for me to adjust to my father’s appearance in the family. Thus, Kenneth and I were each essentially only children; it was not until we were both adults that we communicated as equals.\n\nMy earliest memories are of London: the most vivid is being terrified of the (no doubt friendly) people in horrendous-looking gas masks sitting opposite me in the local air-raid shelter during enemy attacks. For me that was worse than the sound of the planes overhead, the rumble of the doodlebugs and the terminal explosions; the implications of the rubble that the previous day had been the house next door did not properly penetrate into my young brain. Instead I was fascinated by the enormous barrage balloon filling the small park near by, where it was securely tethered at ground level in daytime. I remember at the end of the war the enormous hole in the street’s tarmac outside our house, a consequence of a VE-Day celebratory bonfire. At night I slept in my grandparents’ parlour, in which was a piano that I longed to play. But my formidable English grandmother forbade me even to touch the keys, on the grounds that I might damage them! That must have been partly why there was always some tension between us. My Italian grandfather, Vincente (who fought for England and was decorated in the first world war, and only subsequently was granted British citizenship, tactfully dropped the second e from his name at the start of the second world war)Footnote 1, was quite different: he was tremendously loving and entertaining, as were his brothers Franco and Bruno. The highlights of those days were when the three partly Italian families would gather together for a meal: whenever I see Mafia-looking men dressed in dark suits, heavy black overcoats and black fedoras I am always filled with anticipation of good fun.\n\nMy most enjoyable interludes were holidays visiting my mother’s sister, Winnie, and my favourite uncle, Arthur, in the outskirts of Coventry. Before they were married, Arthur had cycled the nearly 200 km from London dressed in his suit for his job interview at Courtaulds; he was a conscientious objector, and during the war remained in Coventry developing and maintaining equipment for manufacturing viscose fibres, such as nylon thread for parachutes. I remember the strong fine fabric, sickly yellow-green in colour, and reinforced with webbing, and I was curious how parachutes were folded to ensure that they would open when needed. I was reminded of it some sixty years later when I visited the balloon-making facility of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Hyderabad, though then the materials were a little different. During those wartime visits to Coventry I played all day with my cousins, Vivien and Christopher, in the woods, occasionally intruding on a dairy farm near by. It was idyllic. Later, in London, I enjoyed exploring bombed buildings, climbing to the roofs of derelict factories for the fine views; of course, they were strictly out of bounds.\n\nSoon after my father was demobbed, he and my mother rented two rooms and a kitchen on the top floor of an old bomb-damaged house. My father worked very hard, having returned to Hector Powell’s tailoring factory where he was a foreman, and where he had met my mother. During that time he also had his own tailor’s shop in Clapton, just north of Bethnal Green, which he opened with money that he had won playing bridge in the POW camp. Often he could afford only four hours sleep in a night. As trade grew he was able to resign from his factory employment, and devote himself entirely to his own business. In my younger days I used to enjoy going to his shop, and talking with the customers. Many of them were Teddy Boys, young bachelors with money to spend and with a taste for high-quality suits in Edwardian style, but otherwise ordinary nice people. They became the mainstay of my father’s business until the fashion for jeans brought bespoke tailoring almost to a close. There were also customers who, I was told, were famous. One was a virtuoso violinist who had his tailcoat made with the left sleeve longer than the right in order to make them appear to be of the same length when he was playing his violin. Then there was Coco the Clown, whose voluminous check suit was reinforced with webbing, rather like my uncle Arthur’s parachutes, onto which a rope could be hooked for swinging him safely high around the Big Top. My favourites were two brothers, Reggie and Ronnie (Kray), immaculately dressed and very friendly, especially Reggie who always gave me half-a-crown.Footnote 2 At my tender age I knew that they must be kind because they were in the protection business, looking after old people in the neighbourhood: I was assured that if any vulnerable person was burgled, the brothers would ensure that it would never happen again. Only when I was older did I realise that the aged were not the only people the brothers ‘protected’, and that the powers of persuasion, though very effective, were not the most tactful. Later, as a teenager after I had learnt to drive, I would help my father by delivering suits that he had made for other tailors, most notably in Savile Row. That was always a little delicate because the shops there are tiny, with no rear entrance, so there was always the danger that my meeting with the proprietor would be in the presence of a customer who believed that his beloved suit had been made on the premises. Needless to say, the price charged to the customer was staggeringly greater than what my father received, partly because Savile-Row rents are so high, but mainly, I gather, because the clientele would not have appreciated the quality of their acquisitions had they been charged merely a fair market price.\n\nI went to a small primary school, Shacklewell, some twenty minutes walk from home. On the day I started, at the age of five, I was taken by my mother, but after that I refused to be seen being mollycoddled, and insisted that I went alone. That gave me a modicum of freedom.\n\nIn November 1950, aged nine, I slipped on the pavement on my way home from school and badly fractured my left femur. I was taken to the children’s ward in the Metropolitan Hospital where I awoke with my leg in traction supported from on high, just as I had seen in comic strips. Three weeks later I was put in a plaster cast extending from my toes to my neck, rendering me unable to bend. At that hospital children were not allowed visitors: the administration erroneously believed that the trauma experienced by a child following the departure of a relative or friend outweighed the loneliness of not seeing them at all! I was bored, and somehow a message got through to my parents, who responded by sending me a newly acquired volume devoted to teaching mathematics and some of its practical applications (Sawyer, 1948). I read it from cover to cover, and by the time I was temporarily discharged from hospital the following April I had completed most of the tests at the ends of the chapters. That was my introduction to a subject that was to dominate the rest of my life.\n\nIn those days many pupils’ greatest incentive for learning was the consequent end-of-year examination. It didn’t work for everyone, particularly those who didn’t do well: they didn’t do well partly because they were not motivated, and they were not motivated because they perceived that they wouldn’t do well. But in my schools, at least, that was not the case for those ‘near the top’, who studied just hard enough to compete favourably with the others in the class, and no harder: one’s level of attainment was therefore determined solely by the perceived ability of one’s peers. Educationalists in England later encouraged teachers to concentrate on the average and below-average pupils, believing naively that the brightest would attain their optimal level independently of anything else. Laudable as that stance might be for the sake of fairness, from my experience it is obviously otherwise flawed. I was lucky enough to be near the top, and won entrance to Hackney Downs School, culturally mixed and arguably the better of the boys’ grammar schools within walking distance of my home.\n\nMy parents were strict (so I thought) on behaviour; I feared doing anything wrong and getting into trouble. So, on the whole, I was well behaved at home. Therefore school was a paradise for counterbalance. I didn’t believe in being naughty; that causes undue irritation, although I did disrupt a class once, which I’ll mention later. Otherwise, it was only what I thought were serious pranks that were worth bothering with, although looking back on them now they seem petty: climbing over the school wall onto the main-line railway track, usually to recover a ball; picking up (with the help of others) a master’s car and placing it gently between two trees front and back so that it couldn’t be driven away; smearing the steps up to the headmaster’s study after the close of school with nitrogen tri-iodide; raising a friend’s sister’s bra to the top of the flagpole and removing the halyard, rendering it necessary to erect a scaffold to restore propriety; impregnating the wooden floors of the chemistry laboratory with butyric acid – I didn’t realise how involatile it is – using so much that the putrid smell permeated the entire science wing for two months (causing me to regret having done it). Later, the butyric-acid episode was repeated by someone else, engendering Joe Brearley’s (Figure 1) furore, because this time the act was not original.\n\nOne of the strictly forbidden activities was to run along the corridors, rightly so because all the class rooms had heavy doors that opened both inwards and outwards, and to collide at speed with one would cause serious injury. Once, I was in a hurry and literally ran into Joseph (Gestapo, as we called him) Brearley (Watkins, 2008) as he stepped into the corridor. Joe (as later I was able to call him) was the deputy headmaster, the strictest of disciplinarians, meting out severe punishments to maintain order, yet being scrupulously fair. Terrified, I blurted out an excuse in my East-End argot. Instantly Joe went into attack by pointing out a grammatical error, against which I hurriedly reminded him how in spoken English certain words can be omitted when their implied presence would obviously be understood, uttering a hurriedly invented, necessarily inelegant, yet grammatically correct complete sentence in an attempt to reduce the severity of the impending punishment. To my surprise, Joe stopped in his tracks, turned around, and walked off, speechless. Some days later he sought me out, telling me that he had gone straight to the staff room to report on what had happened, and that the English department were still arguing as to whether I was right. The issue of punishment never arose; so far as I was concerned my literary invention was a complete success. I tell this anecdote because it epitomises the manner in which Joe influenced the character of the school: he put intellectual inventiveness above all else.\n\nHonesty and loyalty were characteristics that Joe instilled. No miscreant would ever allow another to take his blame, and no schoolmaster would ever put a pupil in the position of having to reveal information that would incriminate another. I discovered later that such a code of ethics is not shared by at least some of those who consider themselves to be ‘upper class’. I suppose that explains the expression “Honour amongst thieves”.\n\nJoe taught English and his favourite language, German. He had inspired many pupils of the school, including the future Nobel-Prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter, and the actors Steven Berkoff and Michael Caine amongst many, and he established the ethos of the school, emphasising integrity, hard work and hard play. The school was not outstanding academically, although it did send several pupils annually to colleges principally in London to study mainly lucrative practical subjects. However, we were the best amongst London schools in field athletics. I was not a good field athlete, but I did run cross country for the school, and I played rugby fives: in my final year I captained the London Grammar Schools team, and later I played for my Cambridge college and, occasionally, for the university. Fives courts are few and far between, so I also took up squash, which I played for the next four-and-a-half decades. Long after Joe and the other masters of his time had retired, the school went into decline. In 1994, Hackney Downs became the first state high school in the country to be fatally condemned.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Hackney Downs School was that we often had a visiting teacher on sabbatical leave from elsewhere. One such man was Ken Evans, senior mathematics master from Scotch College in Melbourne, Australia. It was one of his classes that I once disrupted. He announced that he was about to teach us probability theory. Behaving as a frequentist, he started by saying that if one were to toss a coin ten times it would be more likely to come down five heads and five tails than in any other combination. I playfully interjected, claiming that my belief was six tails followed by four heads. Ken ignored me and continued. Without another word, I took a coin and tossed it high in the air, announcing a tail after it fell. I tossed again: another tail. Then I tossed a third. By now the class were congregating around me, and after the fourth tail even Ken arrived to convince himself that I was not cheating. I felt strangely empowered as I had never experienced before, and rarely since, and had absolutely no doubt that my prophesy would come to pass. And indeed it did: I tossed two more tails, followed by four heads. In retrospect, I realise how impressive Ken was: he quietly apologised, saying he had muddled his schedule, and that he would teach probability in a few weeks time, in the meanwhile continuing with calculus. Needless to say, I have never even tried to repeat that performance. I have had other rare experiences that offer no ordinary explanation, and that have taught me always to maintain an open mind when I encounter people, my wife Rosanne especially, who have experienced ‘unbelievable’ happenings. There is a tendency among scientists to disbelieve what cannot be repeated; a non-repeatable phenomenon is difficult to address by scientific method. But that does not mean that it cannot happen.\n\nAs an aside, I relate one of the several ‘unbelievable’ happenings encountered by Rosanne, chosen because I experienced it too. About twenty years ago we went to a performance of, appropriately as it turned out, ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ at the University of Colorado. Unusually, we had difficulty finding a place to park. I left Rosanne at the theatre, and eventually succeeded, parking rather more distantly than in the past. Rosanne was welcomed at the theatre door by a long-bearded man, about our age, who escorted her to her place, and told her in an apparently over-sincere manner how he really hoped that she would enjoy the performance. How odd! At the interval I went to buy coffee. On my return I found Rosanne with the very same man, who extraordinarily politely sought my permission to talk to her. He said that he would never forget her, because as a nurse she had looked after him so well when he was a young man in Wardenburg, the university’s medical centre, suffering from a rare disease. Rosanne then knew who he must be; bewildered, she and I briefly looked at each other, and then turned back to address the man: he had vanished! The auditorium was almost empty; he could not possibly have simply walked out of sight. After the performance as we returned to the car, we realised that it was parked outside Wardenburg, where the man with whom we had been talking had died more than three decades earlier.\n\nBack to schooldays. When I was about 15 years old, the London Symphony Orchestra came to Hackney to expose young people to classical music. Every secondary-school pupil in the borough had the opportunity to attend, and since it involved missing a morning’s lessons I leapt at it. I found the experience absolutely wonderful. In the middle of the concert I was bowled over by a piece by Mendelssohn, probably the Hebrides Overture, and was especially enthusiastic in my applause. A rather ‘superior’ boy sitting next to me frowned and told me that such enthusiasm should be left until the end of the entire concert. How silly! That morning was perhaps the true dawn of my love for music, although I have not forgotten my unfulfilled childhood desire to play the piano. I then went frequently to concerts and operas whenever I had enough money, especially in summer to Henry Wood’s affordable Promenade Concerts at the century-old Royal Albert Hall: I recall an occasion during the fourth movement of the Pastoral Symphony being almost drowned by rain dripping on my head from the leaking roof,Footnote 3 hearing thunder from both outside and in. Even Beethoven hadn’t foreseen such realism, I suspect. I recall especially the first performance outside the Soviet Union of Dmitri Shostakovich’s cello concerto at the Royal Festival Hall, played by Mstislav Rostropovich with the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra under Gennadi Rozhdestvensky in the presence of Shostakovich himself: the encore was the entire cadenza and final movement, as had been the case with the violin concerto. I enjoyed a performance of Beethoven’s violin concerto by Wolfgang Schneiderhan who then played the entire chaconne from JS Bach’s Partita No2 as an encore; and I was stunned by an ‘unknown’ soprano at the Covent Garden Opera at what I later learned from the newspapers was Joan Sutherland’s London debut. Living in a city like London has enormous cultural benefit. I used often to buy a cheap seat in the choir at the Royal Festival Hall, behind the orchestra and facing the conductor; one memorable occasion was when I found myself in the front row with my head immediately above the bell of a tuba, which was absolutely wonderful when the tuba wasn’t being played. A very moving occasion was a concert by the Hallé Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli, perchance on the day that Ralph Vaughan Williams died; the death was announced by Barbirolli, who, before the advertised programme, conducted the Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis as a tribute, having requested that there should be no applause at the end: wonderfully pure silence after the strings gradually died down at the end had an enormous emotional impact. Subsequently, there was a memorial service at Westminster Abbey, at which my two favourite violinists, Yehudi Menuhin and David Oistrakh – poles apart in style – played Bach’s double concerto in D minor. I was extremely fortunate some four decades later to spend half-an-hour alone with Yehudi (Figure 1), kindly arranged by John Boyd, Master of Churchill College. We discussed humanism and music, during which Yehudi praised the world’s most inventive composers, J.S. Bach, Mozart and The Beatles, just two days before he visited Berlin to perform in a concert, where, most sadly, he died.\n\nIn my teens I always sought some kind of paid employment, from newspaper-delivery rounds to working as a laboratory assistant in my school, helping to prepare demonstrations and cleaning up the apparatus afterwards. It was during that time that I illicitly put some phosphorus in a deflagrating spoon and gingerly held it up into the pilot light of a geyser in the chemistry laboratory. The almost explosive ignition ejected the burning material that became caught in the sleeve of my lab coat, burning my right wrist. So severe was the burn that it didn’t hurt: I felt nothing, so I thought nothing of it. However, the other lab assistants insisted that I report it, whereupon I was rushed to hospital where I was detained for more than a week for fear of losing the use of my hand. The scar remains in remembrance. A more successful event followed: There was a strange common belief that in Australia the bathtub vortex flows in the opposite direction to those in the northern hemisphere. A simple angular-momentum-conservation argument rendered that highly unlikely, yet I could not convince the believers. The sinks in the school’s laboratories, though not themselves axisymmetric, were plugged by tall circularly symmetrical cylindrical stoppers which could be removed without inducing circulation in the water they restrained. So one Friday evening I filled every sink in all the laboratories, and asked the caretaker not to disturb them over the weekend and to kindly let me in before school opened on Monday morning. Then, I carefully removed the plugs and observed the ensuing vortices. There was no statistically significant evidence for the direction of the Earth’s rotation. But there was a very significant bias towards the direction of the bend in the drainpipe under the bench. Interestingly, I was one day to become a member of the university department headed by George Batchelor, who has contributed much to the theory of vortices (Batchelor, 1967) required for understanding the draining of fluids from sinks (e.g. Klimenko, 1998).\n\nLater, I spent an entire summer holiday working for the Mond Nickel Company, helping a scientist with his experimental investigation into the surface properties of rhodium. I was actually able to make useful suggestions, and was sometimes allowed to pursue them myself. I remember the exhilaration of partaking in a discovery, albeit minor. It made me want a career in research, presumably industrial – I was quite unaware that academic research exists. However, I did find the slow progress of the experimental procedure somewhat frustrating, particularly because repeatability was hardly better in this professional laboratory than what I had experienced at school. So I resolved to be a theorist, not realising that repeated calculations even by mature scientists also don’t necessarily come up with the same answer every time!\n\nI recognised that what I needed to study at university was mathematics and physics. I had read that mathematicians are productive only when young, and I was already seventeen years old, so evidently I should postpone the physics. My schoolmasters had told me that I stood a fighting chance to get into the best university in the country, namely Cambridge, but to do so would require winning an open scholarship, because, coming from a school without an academic reputation, there could be no other route. I acquired some past examination papers, and discovered to my horror that I couldn’t even understand the questions in mathematics, let alone answer them; so reluctantly I turned to Natural Sciences. I learned that one had to apply to a particular college, and that the colleges were in groups with different exams. The Queens’ group’s examinations appeared to be marginally less formidable than the others, so that determined my choice. But which college amongst them? My headmaster suggested that I visit Cambridge for a day to see which college I liked best. So I did. On alighting from my bus in the market square, I was confronted by the spectacular chapel of King’s College in full sunlight. King’s was not in my preferred examination group, so I walked through and approached Queens’ College from behind. Now it was raining, and I faced a dull redbrick building; the prospect of being there seemed gloomy. So I doubled back to St John’s College, geographically the next on my route through the Queens’ list. At the entrance I was confronted by a porter who asked my business. When I told him, he gave me the most friendly welcome, telling me what a wonderful college St John’s is, and insisting that I meet the Senior Tutor straight away. That was the last thing I wanted because I was extremely shy and quite unprepared for an interview. Fortunately, the Senior Tutor was out. Buoyed with confidence from that experience, I went on to Emmanuel College and approached a porter with my story; he was a big surly man, and, looking down at me said: “You’ll never get in here”. So my choice was made. It may seem an unconventional way of choosing a college, but looking back on it I realise that it was actually not a bad one: the demeanour of the porters is surely a good indicator of the ethos of the entire community, and at least at John’s – as it is colloquially called, distinguishing it from St John’s College in Oxford – so it turned out to be. Back home, I applied for entry, and, lo and behold, some months later I received an unconditional offer of a place; my school must have sent a very convincing reference. I recall reading my letter many times, incredulously searching for the caveat that must surely be hidden within, but there was none. What an enormous privilege!\n\nSome time later I returned to Cambridge, this time to sit the scholarship examination. Being in Natural Sciences, in addition to the theoretical papers in physics, chemistry, mathematics and general knowledge (which included translating from both a modern language and from Latin), I had two practical examinations, one in physics, the other in chemistry. The physics was straightforward, as was, so I thought, the chemistry. During the latter I had to carry out titrations involving the products of a strange chemical reaction, the principles of which were explained in general terms, and from the outcome one had to infer the molecular weights of the ‘unknown’ reactants. Presuming that the results had to be integers, I quickly carried out the work sufficiently precisely to obtain the answer, and then I ‘improved’ my measurements for reporting, adding small random errors to the ‘exact’ values. Notwithstanding the principles that Joe Brearley had instilled, in my view my behaviour was hardly unfair: the objective of a normal investigative experiment is to determine some property of the object under investigation, but the objective of this experiment was to get a scholarship. The university acceded, awarding me a scholarship only, I suspect, because I had declared that I was interested principally in physics. My award letter said that I had done well in all subjects except chemistry! Soon after coming up as an undergraduate, I was attracted by an extracurricular lecture in chemistry involving what seemed to be related to what I had encountered in my exam: the then little-known Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. Afterwards, I spoke to the lecturer telling him about my examination. It turned out that it had been he who had prepared the titration, with reagents contaminated in a known way, so he knew how I had come by my results.\n\nJoe Brearley was overjoyed when he learned that I was to go to John’s; unbeknown to me, he was a Johnian himself. By now we were friends; indeed, Joe later came to our wedding. Before I left school, Joe gave me serious advice about how I should benefit most from my undergraduate time in Cambridge: work hard, play hard, and under no circumstance develop a taste for good wine, for that would destroy my bank balance. During my first two years I took the second and third pieces of advice to heart, and the first two thereafter.\n\nIn the spring of 1959, before entering Cambridge, I spent a weekend playing rugby fives against our sister school, Oundle, together with a team from the Clove Club, our ‘Old Boys’. The experience opened my eyes to a stratum of English society that I had not encountered before. We were in the dressing room when a so-called elite rugby team, called Harlequins, arrived. They were not prepared to share the dressing room with riff-raff like us from the East End of London, and insisted that we leave. In the Clove Club team was Keith Pavitt, an engineering student at Trinity College, Cambridge, who completely outclassed them intellectually, resulting in their leaving in indignation for a ‘preferable’ location, which turned out to be a mere classroom, with no showering facilities! That was my first meeting with Keith; we discussed my anticipated entrance to Cambridge, having to read natural sciences rather than mathematics. ‘That’s not necessary’, replied Keith: all I had to do was to write to my tutor asking to change. My request was granted immediately: one of the benefits of Cambridge over most other English universities is its flexibility. Thus, my laboratory days were over, so I thought.\n\nThat year I was also fortunate enough to be awarded a W.H. Rhodes scholarship to tour Canada (actually only Quebec and Ontario) in the summer. We were 48 ‘disadvantaged’ inner-city recipients, from London, Bradford, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. We sailed on the Cunard liner Carinthia to Quebec, and then on to Montreal. One of the scholars with whom I shared a cabin was a Fraser, from whom I learned what Scots wear under their kilts. One night, in the middle of the Atlantic, the captain ordered everyone aboard either to go to the top deck or retreat to their cabins, because he was going to turn out every light on the ship. I went on top, of course, and witnessed a most spectacular aurora, shimmering from the pole, overhead, and well to the south, occupying some 70 per cent of the sky. On reading this memoir Ed Cliver informed me that the aurora was almost certainly associated with a well-known magnetic storm in mid-July 1959 linked to an episode of strong solar activity that by chance marked the start of Jack Harvey’s career (Harvey, 2020). Many years later, when I was resident astronomer on a tour ship sailing the Caribbean to view Halley’s comet, I casually went to the bridge to ask the captain to turn out the lights, and was instantly rebuffed on the ground that someone might trip and sue him. Eventually, I managed to persuade him to extinguish the lights on just the top deck, but it wasn’t the same.\n\nOn the day the Carinthia entered the St Lawrence Seaway we were enveloped in a thick early-morning fog. As the Sun rose the fog cleared, almost instantaneously it seemed, leaving a crystal-clear view of the cliffs. The only cliffs I had ever seen before were at Dover, and with no other scale of reference I assumed that these were of similar height. Then I saw what appeared to be a miniature model village by the water, with small boats manned by dolls, until I realised that the dolls were moving: they were real people! The shock of having suddenly to readjust my seriously faulty distance scale remains with me to this day. Our time on land was wonderfully educational. We were official guests of the City of Ottawa, meeting the Minister of Finance who subjected us to an excruciating economic screed, and we proudly signed the red-leather-bound, gold-edged inventory of official visitors; we visited McGill University; we were entertained in private homes to learn of ordinary Canadian life; and we were taken to a rather sophisticated (urban) ‘barn’ dance; we enjoyed canoeing at Lake Wanapitei, and there experienced a totally different boisterous (country) barn dance, during which in my enthusiasm I inadvertently threw my partner over a table; we went down a nickel mine in Sudbury, and I created great hilarity amongst the miners as being the first person they had ever seen standing upright at the rock-face; little did I know at the time that a mine in Sudbury was to become scientifically famous.\n\nMathematics in Cambridge was, and in some measure still is, different from other subjects. For example, it is the senior subject, that is, the oldest subject, aside of course from divinity and Latin that originally everyone studied. Abilities of incoming students were so disparate that scholars, presumed to be the most able of the students, skipped the first year of study. I was a scholar, but not in mathematics. So should I follow the first year’s courses? I remember timidly meeting my Director of Studies, Frank Smithies: a man of few words. He explained briefly the decision that he was to make. “How much linear algebra do you know?” he asked. “What’s linear algebra?” I replied. Long silence. “How much analysis do you know?” he continued. “What’s analysis?” ... . “You’d better do the first-year courses.” How right he was! And even then I struggled. It wasn’t until the end of the first term, flailing with analysis, before I sought help from another student, John McCutcheon, who explained to me the purpose of epsilon. Then all became clear. John and I have been good friends ever since. We helped each other a lot as undergraduates, he explaining the purer forms of mathematics to me, I explaining physics to him. The end-of-year (Tripos) examination was a horrendous experience: one is seated amongst one’s competitors, most of whom, I believed, were no doubt faring much better than I. Subsequent publication of the results confirmed my belief.\n\nIn my summer vacations I worked to supplement my scholarship income. First, in one of the two chewing-gum factories in England, initially on the gum-processing conveyor belt separating gum where it had been inadequately cut by blades that had been deliberately fractured by operators who had thrown, and still were throwing, spanners into the works in order to relieve boredom; then I was promoted to temporary foreman in the packing department, which was much more interesting, partly because of the wide variety of packaging for the many different brands. I learned that chewing gum could contain not only bits of broken blade, but also wasps, which were targets of football-sized pieces of gum surreptitiously used as projectiles before being processed. Needless to say, I never chew gum. Then, there was the parcel department at the Post Office during the rush before Christmas, from which I was fired because I worked too hard, thinking that I was relieving my workmates; according to my supervisor I was grossly mistaken, because had I continued the management would have expected similar productivity of the permanent staff. In fact, earlier I had been taught how to appear to work without actually doing so, which I found to be more tiring. So, when in the following summer I became a porter driving a delivery van through the grounds of a country hospital, I rearranged the duties so that I could do a whole day’s work in the morning, aside from delivering evening meals, and spend the afternoons secluded amongst the trees reading books. My best job was selling ice cream from a van, because not only was I my own boss but I could also use the van for my own purposes when not working. These vacation experiences taught me a very important lesson: I was certainly not going to spend my life in such routine employment.\n\nOne of the advantages of collegiate universities such as Cambridge and Oxford is that one is thrown together with interesting people in other subjects. Within days of my arriving at John’s I was invited by the Fellows to a formal dinner with the other scholars. It was in the Senior Combination Room, a long narrow candle-lit room with an ornate moulded ceiling, not built to accommodate the many people that were now present four-and-a-half centuries later. For this occasion it was furnished with two long tables, so cramped that the diners on the outer sides, by the walls, had first to establish where they were to be sitting and then file in in order. I was on an inner side, and opposite me at first was a vacant place. Later, as we were being served the soup, the tablecloth in front of me rose, and out popped a white-haired 68-year-old head, smartly dressed with black tie, as were the rest of us, but with tousled hair because he had just crawled under the table fifteen metres or so between the legs of the other diners. He smiled and said: “Hello! My name is Harold; these occasions are supposed to be formal, but clearly that’s not so!”. Later I learned that he was the Emeritus Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, a very interesting man whom I was to encounter again. Much later, as President of the college mathematical society, I was dining next to Fred Hoyle, my hero from school days and the current holder of the Plumian chair, and our guest and post-prandial speaker, who told me how he thought Big Bangs might be reconciled with an asymptotic steady state of the Universe; and even later I found myself dining next to Francis Crick, who remarked that if one attaches together a string of similar long molecules all of which have connectors at each end that are inclined from the long axis of the molecule and do not lie in the same plane, then the resulting structure is necessarily a helix; so the structure of DNA is obvious.\n\nIn 1961 John’s celebrated its 450th anniversary, an important occasion because its significant anniversaries, we were told, occur only once every 150 years. There was dining and wining for all; we ate cygnet, because John’s is one of the few English establishments permitted to kill swans: in England all swans belong to the Crown (although these cygnets had actually been imported from Australia). The party ended with an impressive firework display as had never before been encountered in Cambridge, even on Guy Fawkes night. It caused great consternation amongst the city residents who were in trepidation of an air raid. Nowadays fireworks are commonplace, especially at May Balls (i.e. end-of-year balls that are held in most colleges after exams in May Week, May Week being the first two weeks in June), and residents now take them in their stride. How very different all this was from my earlier life, and what an enormous privilege to experience it!\n\nJohn’s has grown enormously since it was founded, so much so that more tables now fill the dining hall, one down the middle and now two others, each on either side against a wall; and three sittings are required to feed everyone. On ordinary days, students cannot be expected to file in in orderly fashion against the walls as occurs in the Fellows’ Combination Room. So instead it has become the custom simply to walk across the stout oak tables, trying to avoid the other diners and their food. I write this because John Faulkner has also written on this subject (Faulkner, 2005), accusing me of treading in his soup. I point out here that John is a superb raconteur, who never lets the truth stand in the way of a good story. John has also published what he named “Gough’s Theorem” (Faulkner and Swenson, 1988), but I should not dispute that.\n\nAt the end of my first year at university the most wonderful thing happened: I was suddenly smitten by a friend of a friend, Rosanne, who eventually became my beloved wife. I spent as much of my second year as I could in her presence, which sometimes involved cycling to London where she trained as a nurse; I couldn’t afford the bus or railway fare. Consequently, at the end of the academical year I again performed badly in the Tripos examinations, but it was worth it. I had to redeem myself academically in my third year, however, for now I realised that academical research was a possible career, and I wanted to experience it. I recall going to the Senate House at the end of the academical year to hear the results of Part II of the Mathematical Tripos read from the balcony by the senior examiner, always at nine o’clock on the third Thursday of June: Mathematics is the only subject so privileged. I was relieved to learn that I was now a Wrangler.Footnote 4 After the reading is over, the examiner throws from the balcony a couple of hundred sheets of printed results to rain onto the crowd below. I was lucky enough to catch one. I wondered whether one day it could be me standing on that balcony. Years later, on more than one occasion, it was.\n\nAfter graduating I went on to study for Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, a course designed as a preparation for research. My long-term intention was to treat chemistry as a branch of physics, and so deepen our understanding of the subject. So I started taking courses that I thought were the most relevant to that endeavour. However, I found them tedious. So, half-way through the year I gave up the idea. I wanted a career in research, but of course I wanted it to be enjoyable.Footnote 5 So I looked around the applied mathematics department, and observed that the most cheerful faculty were the astrophysicists: Roger Tayler, Dennis Sciama, Leon Mestel, Donald Lynden-Bell and Fred Hoyle. So in the second half of the year I pursued courses in astrophysics. It was a heavier-than-normal load because I had abandoned the first term’s studies, and therefore I had to supplement astrophysics with related courses to make up the deficiency. For the second time I was indebted to the flexibility of my university to permit such apparent waywardness. Perhaps as a result of offering only half-a-year’s work for examination, I didn’t get the distinction I had hoped for. But I was fortunate to have performed well enough to be accepted into the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) as a research student, where I studied aspects of stellar convection under the guidance of Roger Tayler (Figure 2).\n\nAs a research student I lodged with two other students, Jim Caswell and Mike Newton, on the top floor of a splendid Victorian house owned by Francis and Odile Crick. After our first year we tried to renew the lease, but were refused. That surprised us because we thought that we had been good tenants. Yes, we had, agreed Odile, but she and Francis wouldn’t renew because they planned in due course to demolish the house and replace it with a block of flats (apartments), no doubt with the help of the Nobel Prize; however, if we wished we were welcome to stay on without a lease until that happened. Thus, we remained until late 1964; Rosanne and I were to be married in January 1965, and I moved in briefly with some other friends, who also lived in a flat on the top floor of a large house. They were an enthusiastic, energetic crowd, all but one of whom in the fullness of time were simultaneously to become heads of academic institutions: Timmy O’Riordan, Head of the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia; Bob Stobie and Russell Cannon, Directors of the South African Astronomical Observatory and the Anglo-Australian Telescope, respectively; Tim Pedley and Malcolm Longair, Heads of DAMTP and the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, all at the same time as I was Director of the Institute of Astronomy (Figure 5). The canny member of our crowd was Mike McIntyre, also in DAMPT, who succeeded in avoiding major administrative positions throughout his career.\n\nMy engagement to be married to Rosanne had been announced in The (London) Times the previous year. George Batchelor, the head of DAMTP, saw it, and sought me out at coffee time to tell me how pleased he was. From our few earlier encounters, I had learned how distant, yet open, he seemed to be to those whom, like me, he hardly knew. So I asked him why he was so pleased. “It’s quite simple”, he replied, “It means that you will get your PhD on time”. He was right. Of the dozen or so of my exact UK contemporaries (on three-year studentships), just three of us graduated within three years, and we were the only ones who married during that time.\n\nAfter we were married, Rosanne and I rented a small flat above a pawnbroker with a bedroom window just 12 metres from a church bell, and at the same height. We never overslept on Sundays.\n\nThe first task that Roger Tayler suggested was to read a recent paper on stellar evolution by one of the authorities in the subject. I misunderstood what ‘read’ meant, and I presumed that I was to check the derivation of a new equation of state that was presented. I found an error. I thought naively that Roger would take the matter in hand. But no. He said that I, a green research student, should write to the great man and tell him. I checked my calculation several times before timidly drafting a tactful letter, in trepidation of the outcome. I was relieved when the response turned out to be quite friendly: it thanked me for my care, but continued with the assurance that the error did not ‘invalidate’ his evolution calculations because the new equation of state had not actually been used. That opened my eyes to the outside world of astrophysical research.\n\nRoger then suggested I investigate the properties of convection in a radially pulsating star. I started by considering a series of convective-stability problems for an oscillating atmosphere under different idealised conditions. There were many interesting subtleties not far from criticality, but none applied at the high Rayleigh numbers pertinent to stars. I could not see how to formulate a more relevant problem that I could trust. So I shelved the matter.\n\nRoger told me that he had become interested in convective instability in a star that is pervaded by a magnetic field, and invited me to join him in an investigation. We would seek a necessary condition for convection in a compressible atmosphere under constant gravity. Roger suggested that I approach the problem with a variational principle, and that he would work on it too. So busy was he with teaching in term-time that we hardly spoke for weeks, except for brief encounters at coffee during which I tried to keep Roger abreast of my glacial progress, and he would give me advice on how to continue. We had arranged to have a long meeting as soon as term was over, and I worked hard in order to have something positive to say when the time came. I succeeded in deriving a variational principle, and proudly showed it to Roger. He in turn showed me what he had done: he already had the makings of a preliminary criterion, but I was astonished to find that his starting premise was the variational principle that I had so laboriously derived. How could that be? It had already been published, in much greater generality, by Bernstein et al. (1958). Why hadn’t Roger told me? My term’s work had surely been a waste of time. “No it hadn’t”, insisted Roger, “By having derived it yourself you now appreciate it much more than you would have had I merely told you about it”. Once I got used to the idea, I realised what a gift he had given me. In the fullness of time I made similar gifts to my own students, but I doubt they all recognised them as gifts!\n\nRoger and I eventually produced a series of necessary criteria for stability, although in retrospect I’m sure that my contributions could have been obtained more quickly by Roger on his own. Broadly speaking, convection can be stabilised if the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the total pressure everywhere exceeds \\(1-\\gamma/\\Gamma\\), as one might naively expect from a back-of-the-envelope estimate. Here, \\(\\gamma\\) is the first adiabatic exponent and \\(\\Gamma= {\\mathrm{d ln}}p / {\\mathrm{d ln}} \\rho\\) measures the background stratification. We published the work (Gough and Tayler, 1966), and I went on to study the necessary and sufficient conditions for the adiabatic stability of a plane-parallel polytropic atmosphere in the presence of a magnetic field. I was starting to write it up when Roger brought to my attention a draft paper from Syrovatskii (subsequently published by Syrovatskii and Zhugzhda, 1968) presenting the same results. Being beaten to press was a matter that students in DAMTP feared, yet oddly I was not terribly upset, because the published paper was so much better than what I believed I could have written. What is really upsetting, as I learnt later, is being beaten to press by a bad paper; I refrain from relating my experiences of that.\n\nEarly in 1964 I was advised to apply for a Fellowship at the Program of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), because then I would meet the world’s expert on astrophysical convection: Ed Spiegel. I didn’t know the deadline, and inadvertently I missed it. So instead I spent the summer at Culham Laboratory, the UK centre of nuclear fusion research where much plasma physics was being developed. There I met Nigel Weiss (Figure 9), who became a lifelong friend. The following year, at about the time of the GFD deadline, I received a letter from the Director, Willem Malkus, asking me why I had not re-applied. I wrote back to say that I couldn’t afford it because I was now newly married and would not leave my wife behind. Willem replied with an offer to accommodate the two of us in an old carriage house on site, and that he believed the fellowship stipend, which he could supplement with a travel grant from WHOI, would then be adequate. So I applied, and the Carriage House turned out to be delightful. The ten-week programme involved carrying out original research, writing it up, and in the last week lecturing on it to all the participants. I was fortunate to have Ed as my supervisor, who exposed me to a completely new way of thinking, quite foreign to my experiences in Cambridge. After I explained my desire to progress with convection in the astrophysical context, Ed suggested that I try to generalise to compressible flow a heat-flux-maximisation procedure that had been developed by Willem Malkus (1954) and Lou Howard (1963) for Boussinesq liquids. It turned out that in the governing equations there was a term that severely impeded my progress, so after a couple of weeks of struggling Ed suggested that I simply ignore it; that was something I would never have contemplated on my own because there was no evidence that it was negligible. Admittedly, I had been taught as an undergraduate by Leon Mestel who, quoting from The Bible, frequently told me to be “bloody, bold and resolute” and ignore small terms in equations describing complicated situations (although not when there is no justification for doing so). Nevertheless, I went off and took Ed’s advice, and after two or three weeks I returned with a very long face. Ed asked after my wellbeing. I told him that I had solved the reduced problem to obtain an upper bound, but that I had then used the solution to evaluate the omitted term and had found it not to be negligible. “That’s fantastic!”, cried Ed with great delight. I was totally bewildered, for clearly my result was useless. “You have just obtained the first result in the subject”, continued Ed, “It doesn’t matter whether it’s right or wrong; it’s worthy of celebration.” What fantastic optimism! Needless to say, I could not offer the calculation for my project report, so, building on the experience with my first project as a research student in Cambridge, I hurriedly put together, with Ed’s advice, the germ of a generalisation of mixing-length theory that could be applied to radially pulsating stars, and thereby conceal my flux-maximisation failure. My presentation at the end of the programme was the first lecture I had ever given, and I had made copious notes in fear of making a mistake. Ed’s advice afterwards was that in future I jettison my notes, a frightening prospect in the days before computer-generated presentations. He argued that if I could not remember the details of my presentation, it would bound to be too complicated for the audience to follow. So in future I did as he bid, and my lecturing improved.\n\nLocal, officially only non-academic, organisation of the GFD session was carried out by Mary Thayer, a wonderful otherwise retired widow of a WHOI oceanographer. She made sure that everything went to plan. She also typed and edited the booklet of lectures that is published each year, and always succeeded in getting the Fellows’ manuscripts on time: she simply threatened to write herself any manuscript that wasn’t received in a timely fashion. She was formidable enough to be quite plausible, and it worked. Mary also made mid-morning coffee. She started by boiling water just outside the open lecture room, in a large somewhat battered aluminium pot, so old that its bottom was rounded. It stood on a flat hotplate, on which the pot would continually rock from side to side, each side receiving a thermal impulse and emitting an acoustic pulse whenever it touched the plate, thereby (most times) driving an oscillation of the pot and a resonating surface gravity oscillation of its contents in a manner mechanically similar to pushing a child on a swing, and thermodynamically like the maintenance of intrinsic stellar pulsations, the impulsive thermal contacts acting in the manner of Eddington’s valve. As the water approached boiling point the magnitude of the thermal impulses decreased and the turbulent viscosity increased, and the oscillation ceased. The acoustic arrest was apparent inside the lecture room, causing, perhaps subliminally, unrest enough to ensure a timely termination to whatever lecture was in progress. Surprisingly, I had difficulty in arousing interest in the phenomenon amongst the other, typically oceanographic, Fellows (Figure 2). Yet how appropriate for me, who was investigating such a process in stars.\n\nAfter Woods Hole I returned to my final year at Cambridge. I worked further on the interaction between convection and pulsation, obtaining evidence that convective stabilisation principally via the modulation of the mean heat flux might be responsible for the red edge of the ‘classical’ stellar instability strip in the HR diagram, and that destabilisation by the Reynolds stress (turbulent pressure) could dominate at lower effective temperatures and be responsible for the oscillations of the long-period variables. I was excited by these early results, and by now I was sure that I wanted an academic career. My hope after obtaining my PhD was to work with Ed Spiegel. However, Ed was about to spend a sabbatical year in Cambridge, which was the one place I could not be. At Ed’s advice, I applied to the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, now JILA, for a fellowship to work with John Cox. Fortunately, I was successful.\n\nPrior to Woods Hole, on Easter morning 1965, I was in the DAMTP library reading three papers by Lord Rayleigh on instabilities in rotating fluids. In the first (Rayleigh, 1916) is derived what is now called the Rayleigh condition: a uniform incompressible inviscid flow, circularly swirling, is stable to axisymmetric perturbations if the magnitude of vorticity increases outwards everywhere (I paraphrase); the other papers (Rayleigh, 1880, 1895), which are devoted predominantly to rectilinear shear flow, show that a necessary condition for instability to two-dimensional perturbations is that the vorticity has a turning point somewhere.Footnote 6 What interested me was that, although incomplete, the two criteria both involved (potential) vorticity alone. As I was pondering the matter, in walked Donald Lynden-Bell. He was at a loose end because his wife Ruth was in hospital about to give birth to their first child, and he had come into the department to shelter from the snow – not typical weather in Cambridge, especially at Easter. Rosanne was in the same hospital, nursing. It turned out that Donald had been thinking along similar lines, but more thoroughly (and more deeply) than I, and was in the process of generalising the results to inhomogeneous fluids that were neither in pure rotation nor purely rectilinear. We talked for the rest of the day, and came to the conclusion that any turbulence resulting from such instabilities, especially if the dominant energy-containing eddies are almost two-dimensional, produces Reynolds stresses that would, in the first instance, tend not to smooth out large-scale velocity, as was commonly believed, but more likely large-scale vorticity instead. We conjectured that turbulence caused by, for example, convection, would behave similarly. We subsequently learned that G.I. Taylor (1915, 1932) had had similar ideas many decades before, and had developed his mixing-length ideas based on vorticity transport. Moreover, Francis Bretherton and Stewart Turner, in DAMTP, brought to our attention the work of Richard Scorer (1965), an eminent meteorologist at Imperial College, who in an unpublished report also concluded that turbulence tends to homogenise vorticity, although his view of the large-scale consequences were quite different from ours: Scorer argued that redistributing angular velocity such as to (almost) homogenise vorticity leads to an essentially singular vortex that, he argued, explained the formation of tornados and hurricanes; Donald and I had envisaged the system to evolve further, and that eventually there would be no singularity. Angular momentum had therefore to be expelled.\n\nWe needed experimental verification. My undergraduate belief that my days performing laboratory experiments had come to an end was about to be shattered. At the suggestion of Thomas Brooke Benjamin, we floated a beaker of water in another, larger, beaker on the departmental turntable in the basement, and generated turbulence in the inner beaker with Alka-Seltzer, an analgesic that effervesces in water. If angular velocity were expelled from the water in the inner beaker, because that beaker and its contents had to conserve angular momentum, at least initially, the beaker would speed up. Each morning, on the way to the department, I stopped at the local pharmacy to buy a tube of Alka-Seltzer tablets. The pharmacist was bemused, because I didn’t look sick; however, after about a week, I regularly arrived to find a tube on the counter awaiting me. As Donald and I were preparing our apparatus, George Batchelor, the most senior fluid dynamicist and head of department, told us that the experiment was not worth performing, for he could prove by logic alone that we would get a null result. Nevertheless, we did perform the experiment, and the beaker did speed up. That caused every fluid dynamicist in the department, including George, together with my astrophysics friends Brandon Carter and Stephen Hawking, to come downstairs to see for themselves and offer alternative explanations, which Donald and I set forth to test. In the end we wrote a paper, probably the most controversial of my career, and sent it to the Astrophysical Journal, which Chandrasekhar rejected instantly as being irrelevant to astrophysics. So we sent it to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, which George Batchelor edited. It went to four referees: two said that it was one of the most original papers they had ever read and that it should be published without modification, the other two that it was the most ridiculous nonsense they had ever seen and under no circumstance should it see the light of day in any journal. George had to make the casting decision, and because his prediction had been shown wrong, he honourably published it (Gough and Lynden-Bell, 1968). Some time later Strittmatter, Illingworth, and Freeman (1970) demonstrated that the cool inner beaker caused thermal currents in the outer beaker to spin it up, which vitiated our argument (but not necessarily our conclusion; they had not shown that the turbulence had no effect at all). I should add, to show off my experimental prowess, that I had observed that the Alka-Seltzer reaction is endothermic, and had measured the heat of reaction to be −50 calories per tablet, but Donald and I had misjudged the extent to which that biased our results.\n\nLater, I sought to find a quasi-steady state in a large cylindrical rotating tank of stratified saline, heated from below, undergoing layered turbulent convection, the purpose of the layers being to insulate dynamically the main body of the fluid from the base of the container. I made neutrally buoyant direction indicators that floated in the upper layers, and I recorded their directions each rotation. I had to stand in an inertial frame (at that time the department had no television camera that could watch from the rotating frame). It was extremely tedious. However, I was rewarded after four continuous days by the realisation that the average angular velocity of the fluid appeared to be significantly less than that of the turntable; some vorticity, and with it angular momentum, must surely have been expelled. But on the fifth and sixth days the reverse happened, and although my statistics were not yet secure I was moved to check the speed of the turntable. It turned out to vary some hundred-fold more than its specification. The turntable was returned to the manufacturer, who reported that the thrust bearing had been installed upside-down! Weeks later the turntable reappeared in DAMTP with an assurance that it now satisfied specifications. However, I was too disheartened to face several potentially fruitless weeks giddily watching the orientations of half-a-dozen floats. Perhaps my days as an experimental physicist really were over. However, that was not to be so.Footnote 7\n\nMy PhD dissertation contained three chapters: on the effect of an externally imposed magnetic field on convective instability, on the interaction between convection and pulsation, and on the interaction between convection and rotation. I have maintained an interest in all three subjects ever since. The thesis was written in just three weeks, against the deadline of the birth of Rosanne’s and my first child. In the event, the birth was late, so I then had time to relax, or bite my thumbs. After a week I drove Rosanne fast down a long uneven country road, ensuring that the wheels of the car rode over the most severe undulations. The next day our first daughter, Karen, now Kim, was born, on the day that England won the FIFA World Cup (an achievement yet to be repeated).\n\nAll that was now required for the PhD degree was to survive my oral examination. There were two examiners, one internal to the university, the other, Paul Roberts, external. The examination was conducted in the morning. After settling into some details about my computations of the convective stability of a compressible atmosphere in the presence of a magnetic field, Paul drew my attention to my graph of a measure of marginal stability against a dimensionless measure of the depth of the fluid layer, the values plotted having been computed as eigenvalues of a two-point boundary-value problem. I had not noticed that there were two depths for which, from the information provided in my dissertation, the values could be evaluated in one’s head (or at least on the back of a large envelope), and my plot did not go through them. Paul said that if I could locate the error by the end of the day, and if correcting it would make no qualitative difference to my conclusions, then I could make a minor correction and he would be satisfied; otherwise I would have to resubmit the thesis. I went away, quaking with fear. Then, to my relief, I found that the mistake was indeed minor. The graph had been hand-drawn – computer graphics were not available in those days – and my original draft would not fit on the page, so I had had to rescale it. It turned out that all that was wrong was simply that the ordinate scale was mislabelled by a constant factor. The correction was therefore trivial to undertake, and made no material difference to the conclusions in the thesis. A couple of years later I encountered Paul at a conference in Newcastle held in honour of Keith Runcorn, and I asked him how he had discovered my erroneous values apparently so readily. Surely he had not undertaken to check everything in the thesis. No, he replied; he had merely followed his normal practice: to open the thesis at a random page and locate the mistake. It was four years after my own examination that I was an examiner myself. I decided to emulate Paul. Lo and behold, I found a mistake on the first random page I selected. That too turned out to be easy to correct, although it did require cutting out two pages and inserting new ones – dissertations were properly bound before submission in those days. The error I found in the second thesis I examined required replacing a dozen pages. Subsequent candidates have been more careful (or perhaps I have been less assiduous), and I no longer find errors on the first random page I encounter.\n\nA few days before leaving Cambridge for JILA, Rosanne and I were invited by my tutor, Alan Welford, and his wife Ruth, to their home for dinner. I had been fortunate enough as a scholar of John’s to have experienced some interesting wine, but what Alan and Ruth served that evening was more than just interesting, it was stunning. “It’s just something I picked up from the college cellars”, said Alan modestly in response to my praise; it opened my eyes, or perhaps I should say my palate, to a new world. For the first time in my life I took the trouble to remember a wine’s name: Chateau Lafite Rothschild. Henceforth, Joe Brearley’s third piece of advice went out of the window.\n\nI really enjoyed the environment at JILA, so different from Cambridge, in an institution that, like Cambridge, has a number of brilliant physicists. I made a great many new friends. John Cox was a quiet man, with whom one had to commune a long time before one could appreciate the depth of his understanding. At the opposite end of the spectrum was the very vocal Dick Thomas, one of the founders of JILA, who always spoke his mind, upsetting the timid amongst those with whom he disagreed. I enjoyed the scientific bantering with Dick; it not only made me seek several different ways of explaining a point, but also, through his appreciation, made me more confident in myself.\n\nMy main activity during that year was to complete a formulation of my mixing-length approach to convection in a pulsating star, and to increase my knowledge of other branches of astrophysics. I introduced and ran an evening seminar series, such as I had encountered previously at Woods Hole, for discussions of nascent ideas. To keep matters informal and friendly I served beer and snacks from the outset, but was quickly informed that it was illegal because at the time the university campus was dry. So Dick offered his house in the mountains, which enhanced the proceedings with its stunning views. In winter, after snow, it was a long journey from the campus. On one occasion the speaker failed to arrive. The audience could not be sent home un-entertained, so in the absence of a volunteer I had to speak myself. I was completely unprepared, and had neither notes nor slides, so I spoke on vorticity expulsion by turbulence because there were no complicated equations to construct. It was only the second lecture of my life. Uriel Frisch was there, passing through Boulder from Nice, and was intrigued by the ideas; our interaction engendered many subsequent discussions during my sabbatical year in Nice. Amongst the topics were how turbulent vorticity expulsion could explain the observed sharp jump in stellar rotation velocities along the main sequence, and the ‘equatorial acceleration’ of the Sun’s convection zone (Gough, 1966).\n\nWithin a few weeks of arriving at JILA I received a letter offering me a professorship at the University of Alberta, coupled with being chairman of the Geophysics Division of the Physics Department. Obviously the letter had been misdirected, even though it was addressed explicitly to me, Douglas, and had been forwarded from my previous correct DAMTP address in Cambridge. I wrote back admitting that I was probably not the intended recipient. I was a little surprised never to receive a letter of thanks for obviating a potentially embarrassing situation; what would have happened, I sometimes wonder, had I accepted the offer? Later, I became aware of the existence of the geophysicist Dennis Ian Gough; our paths were later to cross on other interesting occasions.\n\nRosanne, Karen and I had a wonderful year. We stayed in a ‘Chautauqua’ cottage near the edge of town. JILA had organised it for us in advance, with some reluctance (we had wondered why). It turned out to be little more than a crude wooden shack, its only form of heating, in the main room only, being an almost uncontrollable gas-fired furnace under an almost red-hot grill in the floor that we had to rope off once our infant had learned to crawl. This taught us one of the important differences between two ostensibly similar languages from either side of the Atlantic Ocean: for us the word ‘cottage’ had conjured up visions of a small stone- or brick-built, possibly thatched, country abode.\n\nWe were amazed by the rapidity with which the weather in Boulder could change. We went to the theatre one evening early into our sojourn, dressed for summer, and were faced by nearly 50 cm of snow at the end of the performance. The locals cheered in anticipation of skiing. Our hearts dropped, because all our warm clothes were in a dock in Montreal awaiting the end of a stevedores’ strike. We enjoyed visiting many interesting places in the vicinity. One memorable trip was to the Santo Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico to witness the spring corn dance. We had been advised to leave our car well outside the Pueblo, and then to watch the dancers from a respectfully distant location. But that was not to be so. I was carrying Karen on my back in a ‘newly invented’ Gerry Kiddie Carrier; the Indians (locally known as Native Americans) had never before seen a paleface carrying a child in the Indian way, and we were all immediately accepted into the festivities. Only the males danced, in a long line from the most senior to children who were barely old enough to stand. We stayed, amongst the women, for most of the day, fascinated. Finally, we moved on to Mesa Verde. We had left Boulder in the snow, leaving the heating in our cottage at the lowest we dared (against a fear that the wind might otherwise blow out the pilot); we returned a few days later on a hot sunny day. The temperature in the cottage was unbearably high, and I had to leave the family outside while I opened all the doors and windows and scraped the candles from the dining table over which they had flowed.\n\nWe partook in several local activities: Rosanne and I joined a baroque ensemble and we both learned to play the recorder; Rosanne worked voluntarily at Wardenburg, the University of Colorado’s Health Center (her UK medical qualifications are not recognised for full nursing in the USA) where, amongst other duties, she cared for a student dying from a rare disease, the man whose later apparition at A Midsummer Night’s Dream I described earlier in Section 2; I joined the JILA skiing seminar, where I graduated from snow-ploughs to parallel turns, ‘taught’, as he put it, by Peter Wilson, visiting from Sydney, who simply took me to the top of a piste on which all routes down were too steep to do otherwise.\n\nWhen we arrived in Boulder, JILA was housed in two separate buildings. Mine was for theorists, a late-nineteenth-century stone structure with creaky wooden floors. I quickly learnt the different footfalls of my new colleagues, to the extent that I, and no doubt everyone else, was always aware of who else was in the building at any given time. It was a comfortable feeling. Half-way through my stay, JILA was united in a new building: a brick-and-stone-faced concrete tower with a central cavity housing two elevator shafts and a never-to-be-used experimental space that effectively isolates the offices from all but their immediate neighbours. It taught me that effective human communication is horizontal, a lesson from which I benefitted decades later when planning with open-minded architects the design of an extension to the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge (Figure 3), made possible by a kind donation from my sometime student Nick Corfield.\n\nAfter JILA I went to New York, as a National Research Council (NRC) Senior Resident Research Associate at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), to work with Ed Spiegel. Rosanne and Karen flew via England, so that they could visit family; both JILA and the NRC paid return fares from the UK for me and my immediate family. However, I drove across the country instead, in order to get our vehicle to New York. The journey gave me an appreciation of more than a thousand continuous miles of maize. It also left an indelible memory of a (not-to-be-my-only) near-death experience: I was driving on an open freeway out of a valley in Illinois when an articulated truck coming downhill on the other side lost a front tyre and headed out of control across the unguarded central reservation straight towards me. To try to stop would have been obvious suicide, so I tried to accelerate up the hill in our under-powered station wagon, heavily laden with all our belongings. The response was sluggish, and I braced myself for a mighty impact. The lorry turned onto its side, which fortunately slowed it somewhat, and it missed by a hairsbreadth. The driver was unhurt; both of us were in shock. To calm myself I drove onto more minor roads through Indiana, adding a hundred miles or so to the journey, which later prompted an unpleasant objection from petty NRC bureaucrats who were to reimburse my travel costs. In New York we rented a tenth-floor apartment on Riverside Drive, which Rosanne’s mother had secured for us as the result of a casual conversation with a shop assistant in Cambridge who, it transpired, had a daughter about to return from Manhattan and needed a sublet. By chance, the apartment was just two blocks from GISS.\n\nBeing at GISS was another whole new experience. When computing I often worked late into the night, and would shop for groceries on Broadway at 3 am on the way home. In that way I got to know, casually, quite a few of those interesting New Yorkers who always shopped for food at that hour.\n\nIt turned out that Ed had invited another DAMTP research student, my exact contemporary Jüri Toomre, to join us. We cemented our acquaintance at GISS, and have been good friends ever since. Ed had encountered a mathematical expansion procedure initiated by Paul Roberts for studying Boussinesq convection, and suggested that the three of us develop it. The idea was to expand the horizontal dependence of the velocity and fluctuating temperature in eigenfunctions of the linearised problem and then project the governing equations onto those eigenfunctions, leaving a set of coupled differential equations for the amplitudes of the resulting ‘modes’, as we called them, with respect to the vertical coordinate and time. The intention was to be able to concentrate on the vertical variation of the thin horizontal boundary layers that were bound to be present at high Rayleigh number (a dimensionless measure of the thermal stratification), in the hope that any associated poorly resolved horizontal variation would be of lesser importance. Jüri, whose expertise was in numerical modelling, studied the temporal evolution of a severely truncated expansion (with 1, 2 or 3 modes), while Ed and I worked on an asymptotic analysis of the steady state of a single mode. Ed and I spent many a long evening discussing the details of the analysis by telephone, each from his own home, feasible because local calls are free in the US. The principal goal was the relation between the Nusselt number, \\(N\\) (a dimensionless measure of the total heat flux), and the Rayleigh number, \\(R\\), for given Prandtl number (the ratio of viscous to thermal diffusion coefficients). We found the going very tough, and for a long while we were unsure whether we had established the relation correctly. The leading order was the product of a power of \\(R\\) and a power of \\({\\mathrm{ln}}R\\), and we dearly wanted numerical confirmation. Evidently, getting the power of \\({\\mathrm{ln}}R\\) would require very high values of \\(R\\), which implied extremely thin boundary layers. Jüri’s time-dependent code used a piecewise-constant mesh, suitable for ensuring precise adherence to certain conservation properties of the solution, but only away from any mesh discontinuity. Somehow that was deemed essential by numerical experts of the day. However, the discontinuities generated artificial disturbances that interfered with convergence, severely limiting the value of \\(R\\) that could be attained. In contrast, I believed that a continuously varying mesh would not only be more stable, but also more informative: a check on the conservation laws a posteriori would provide a measure of accuracy. To spur us on Ed had offered two carrots for successful computations at large \\(R\\): dinner with a good wine from his collection (I no longer remember what it was) for reaching \\(10^{15}\\), and Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1959 for \\(10^{20}\\). Because it was I who believed in the efficacy of continuous mesh variation, it was left to me to effect a demonstration. I used centred second-order-accuracy differences, and solved the two-point, non-linear, boundary-value problem (of eighth order for a single mode) by Newton–Raphson–Kantorovich iteration, using a procedure that I had evolved from one that Norm Baker and Rudi Kippenhahn had used to study stellar pulsation (Baker and Kippenhahn, 1965). When I considered the programme to be working correctly, I submitted a job for overnight running, starting with \\(R=10^{4}\\), which I knew was easy, and then successively increasing \\(R\\) by a factor \\(\\sqrt{1}0\\) in a FORTRAN do-loop, always using the previous solution, appropriately stretched and scaled, as a trial. With great optimism I set the loop to end at \\(R=10^{20}\\). The next morning I collected the line-printer output: it was 10 cm or so thick, weighing several kilograms.Footnote 8 I turned to the last page to see where the computation had crashed, and was amazed that it had reached the end of the do-loop. I was overjoyed. To celebrate the success, Ed and his wife Barbara had a dinner party for the team and our wives. The first wine was wonderful; then came disaster: someone knocked over my glass of Lafite Rothschild; Rosanne, who was newly pregnant with our second daughter, had already declined, and there was no wine left in the bottle. So I never even tasted the main prize. In recompense, just before I was to leave New York a year later to return to Cambridge, Ed very kindly gave me a bottle of 1959 Chateau Latour.\n\nMy procedure for determining the mesh on an independent variable \\(x\\) was to imagine a transformed variable \\(\\xi\\) on which the mesh is uniform, choosing \\(\\xi(x)\\) such as to minimise the integral of the sum of the squares of the first or second derivatives with respect to \\(\\xi\\) of all the dependent variables and however many of their derivatives contributed directly to the (differencing error in the) differential system. I called it mesh stretching. Some years later we presented the procedure at a conference on numerical analysis organised by Bob Richtmyer (Gough, Spiegel, and Toomre, 1975a). Jüri had a brilliant presentational idea to attract the attention of the audience: I gave the lecture, walking amongst the audience, much of the time without looking back at the screen, and Jüri was hidden from view holding the controller of the slide projector – this was long before the days of computer-generated radio-controlled lecture presentations – he knew the talk intimately, and changed the slides as needed with no prompting from me. The audience was evidently amazed, having never seen the like before, and many remembered the presentation long afterwards. Whether they remembered the mathematical content is another matter.\n\nJüri’s computations revealed a quite complicated behaviour of our admittedly severely truncated expansion. It was evident that, interesting as it was, we were probably not faithfully representing the very-high-Rayleigh-number convection present in stars, which had been our goal. Moreover, the Boussinesq approximation had to be relaxed to admit compressibility; that led to my formulation of the anelastic approximation suitable for describing subsonic convection, more about which I report later. We had also formulated a representation of plane Poiseuille flow using the same expansion technique, and Jüri had carried out some computations; the work was completed with the help of Jean-Paul Zahn, who came to New York at about the time I left, after which communication was too slow for me to be able to make further significant contributions. Nevertheless, someone dubbed us ‘The Convective Collective’ (Figure 4). Ed, Jüri and Jean-Paul were joined by Jean Latour, and used the technique to study relatively shallow convection zones in A stars (e.g. Latour et al., 1976; Toomre et al., 1976), which was no doubt better than using the only other alternative of the time, namely mixing-length formalism. After that, the technique was almost completely abandoned; Jüri sensibly moved on to develop more realistic direct simulations of convection, and we others moved on to other things. The Collective eventually published our work in four papers in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (Zahn et al., 1974; Gough, Spiegel, and Toomre, 1975b; Toomre, Gough, and Spiegel, 1977, 1982); it was to be thirteen years after my departure that the last of them appeared. Ed and Jüri believe that the inordinate delay was largely my fault, especially since the last of the studies to have been completed – that with Jean-Paul – was the first to be published. Perhaps they are right, although I can think of other possibilities that are consistent with the data.\n\nMy experience in New York was both exciting and stimulating. Ed tried to persuade me to remain, suggesting an Associate Professorship in the Astronomy Department at Columbia University. It was tempting, but Rosanne and I had vowed before we left England that any decision about the side of the Atlantic on which we might settle would be made in England. Ed saw this as the symptom of a disease that Cambridge inflicts on most of those who go there; being so inflicted, I needed to seek employment back home. In my second year in New York I was fortunate to be funded to attend a conference in Newcastle. By now our second daughter, Heidi, had been born, and I took the opportunity to take her with me to meet her grandparents. Born in New York, Heidi has dual citizenship, rendering crossing the Atlantic much easier than it is for the rest of the family. Her birth had been overdue, we believed. Recalling the delay of Karen’s birth, after three weeks delay Rosanne and I travelled up and down Manhattan on the IRT (subway) express, sitting immediately above a bogey. It worked a charm. Next morning, in the early hours, Rosanne had gone into labour. The taxi driver who took us to the hospital must previously have had a birth in his taxi, because he drove at breakneck speed paying no heed to traffic lights. On arrival I was presented with paperwork to complete, and as a result I nearly missed the birth. I finished just in time, and was delighted that our Heidi’s first action was to grab the oxygen mask that had been unnecessarily forced upon her, and tried to pull it away. On reflection, I wonder whether her birth was actually one week early.\n\nAfter the Newcastle conference I paid a visit to the new Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (IoTA) that had been established by Fred Hoyle after I had left DAMTP. There I was reunited with some old friends from student days. Amongst them was Peter Eggleton, to whom I explained how to simplify my mesh-stretching technique to make it easy to use in his computations of stellar evolution. But the man whom I really wanted to meet was Fred Hoyle, to ask him for a job. Alas, he was in London at a meeting, as I learnt from his wife Barbara, who promised to relay my desire. A few days later, walking to the lecture room to deliver a seminar at Queen Mary College in London at the invitation of Ian Roxburgh, I was intercepted by Ian’s secretary who told me there was someone on the phone wishing to speak to me. There isn’t time, I said, I’m about to give a seminar. It’s Fred Hoyle, she replied. So I changed my mind. Fred started by telling me what he had understood from Barbara, then straight out suggested that I arrive on the first of October. I had made no formal application. It had taken Fred a few days to respond in order to take up references by telephone. The offer was initially for just one year, not the tenure that Ed had suggested for Columbia. However, at least my immediate future was now secure. Ed was bemused. Soon afterwards I was also offered an Associate Professorship by the University of Colorado, coupled with a JILA Fellowship, which I also declined for the same reason as the Columbia offer. However, it provided an opportunity for recommending Jüri for the post.\n\nIn New York I thought about how to represent the equations of motion of a deep layer of compressible gas in a form amenable principally to the expansion procedure that Ed, Jüri and I were using to describe thermal convection in a Boussinesq liquid. Ed and George Veronis had written an extremely lucid paper deriving the Boussinesq approximation under conditions applicable to convection at low Mach number in thin layers of gas (Spiegel and Veronis, 1960); and Ogura and Phillips (1962) had presented an anelastic analysis of adiabatic motion that did not account for the thermal boundary layers in complete convection zones. So I set to amalgamating the two approaches, developing an expansion at low Mach number for an arbitrarily deep layer. I thought the outcome to be obvious; certainly not worth publishing. Ed was doubtful because in his Boussinesq analysis with George it had been possible to establish a background state independently of the final solution against which a thermodynamic linearisation was made, whereas I asserted that is not possible for deep fluid layers. Why? An explicit justification was evidently warranted. Every Wednesday Jüri, Ed and I met at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where I was a Visiting Member. In the afternoons there would be a specialist seminar to a small audience of interested applied mathematicians and physicists: Steve Childress, Al Glassgold, Joe Keller, Peter Lax, Jürgen Moser, Sol Rubinow, Mal Ruderman, Englebert Schücking amongst others, all of whom could be highly critical in a very constructive way. I was to lecture on anelasticity. Usually the seminars took a little over an hour, but mine went on for three, as I fielded question after question, most of them around the issue of whether an independent background state could be defined. It took me two more three-hour sessions to convince them. Ed’s reaction was that surely I must now accept that the result is not obvious. So I published (Gough, 1969). The paper prompted many invitations to give seminars in meteorology departments.\n\nThe process of publishing that work raised an interesting issue. I had already refereed for the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences a paper on a Boussinesq-like discussion implicitly making an expansion that did not conserve energy at each order. Even though the leakage was potentially no greater than the small expansion parameter, so that it could be argued that in some sense the expansion was formally not incorrect, a numerical computation of any truncated representation would be susceptible to gaining or losing energy artificially from the ignored higher orders, which could lead to artificial runaway. Spiegel and Veronis had taken care not to permit that to happen in their work, and I, having been made aware by Ed of the pitfall, had done likewise in my yet unpublished anelastic analysis. I suggested in my referee’s report that the author at least draws attention to that deficiency. I am never ashamed of what I write, and I readily revealed my identity. In this instance I thought that I was being helpful, but the author thought otherwise. Later, when I submitted my anelastic paper to the same journal, the editor, it transpired, sent it to the author of the paper that I had recently refereed, who chose, I presume, to appear not to understand my analysis, and ‘demanded’ changes that would have rendered it invalid. I had to ask the editor to send it to a competent referee, whom I subsequently learnt was George Veronis. He recommended acceptance. The experience made me appreciate how it can be inconvenient for a referee’s identity to be revealed. However, I ignored that until I experienced a much more serious repercussion:\n\nI had refereed for Nature the famous paper by Severny, Kotov, and Tsap (1976) on the ‘discovery’ of the 160-minute oscillation of the Sun (and, several months later, the paper by Brookes, Isaak, and van der Raay (1976) on the same subject). It was in July 1975; I had received the manuscript only a few days before departing for a visit to Boulder, and, after settling in, and knowing the speed at which Nature likes a response, I sent copies of my report by post not only to the editor but also directly to Andrei Severny at the same time – this was before the days of the internet – explaining, so I thought, why my response was so tardy (I had taken 10 days or so to respond). Andrei and I had previously made friendly acquaintance during my first visit to the Crimea in 1969, and so I was quite upset when I received from him a curt response to my report, and I feared that our relationship had been damaged. Andrei wrote that he had carried out all my recommendations and that now he hoped that the inordinate delay that his paper had suffered would not be prolonged. The following autumn Nigel Weiss received a request from Nature to write a News and Views article on the two observational papers, which were to appear in the same issue; to my horror Nigel told me that the version of the Russian paper that he had been given had been received by Nature the previous March! Andrei must have believed that I had sat on his paper for four months. I have never felt able to set matters right. I complained vehemently to Philip Campbell, then the Physical Sciences editor of Nature, that referees should always be given all pertinent information about the history of the papers that they are sent, and he replied with an appropriate promise. Yet I resolved never again to reveal my identity as a referee unless I can anticipate a timely face-to-face meeting with at least one of the authors.\n\nOf the other matters that I mistakenly believed were obvious, I mention here but two. The first is that gravity waves tend to enhance, rather than suppress, vertical shear in horizontal flow, and consequently enhance rotational shear in stars. This was clear to me from the GFD lectures by Francis Bretherton (1965) that I had attended at WHOI. Francis discussed the consequences of critical-layer absorption. It seemed obvious to me that a similar but more gradual process would apply anywhere, not just near critical layers (where the dispersion relation formally predicts zero frequency in the locally moving frame). The reason is simply that the frequency of a prograde gravity wave propagating vertically into a region of increasing velocity is Doppler-shifted downwards in the local frame of the fluid. Therefore, the vertical wavenumber increases, and consequently so does the dissipation rate, enhancing the deposition of (positive) momentum; retrograde waves behave conversely. The consequences can be complicated, and are now thought in particular to explain the quasi-biennial oscillation of the Earth’s atmosphere (Holton and Lindzen, 1972; Plumb and McEwan, 1978). Indeed, I once contemplated whether the process might be directly responsible for the solar cycle (Gough, 1998), an idea subsequently embraced briefly by Jean-Paul (Kumar, Talon, and Zahn, 1999), although I doubt that waves would be generated with sufficiently high amplitude to produce an oscillation period as short as 11, or 22, years. I had hinted at the phenomenon, too obliquely I now realise, in a discussion of internal solar dynamics at a conference in Nice (Gough, 1977a), but it has probably never been noticed. At the time, the only observational evidence for the existence of solar gravity waves was the infamous 160-min oscillation. Its amplitude was too low to be of much relevance, and I estimated that gravity waves generated at the base of the convection zone hardly penetrated into the radiative interior, so I didn’t pursue the matter further in the literature. Had I done so, scientists presenting calculations purporting to show how angular-momentum transport by gravity waves renders rigid the rotation of the radiative interior of the Sun would at least have been obliged to address the opposing view. I hasten to add that Jean-Paul Zahn and his colleagues have addressed the matter since (e.g. Zahn, Talon, and Matias, 1997; Mathis et al., 2008), although I do doubt some of their conclusions (e.g. Gough, 2002). That gravity waves penetrate only superficially into the radiative interior did not appear in the commonly read literature until Bill Press published it in the Astrophysical Journal (Press, 1981). I had made my discussion in Nice quite succinct, believing that the reader would be familiar with gravity-wave dynamics. Bill, however, reproduced much of the standard text-book material, which dominated what was presented to be a research paper. My Cambridge friends were astounded. But perhaps we were too old-fashioned, because Bill’s tactic seems to have been the more effective. That became even more apparent to me more recently when I mentioned to Jüri Toomre my thoughts on writing a book on helioseismology with Michael Thompson (Figure 12); Jüri considered it a waste of time on the ground that scientists no longer read books! I doubt him, but I can see whence he came, because Jüri works in an institute that no longer houses a library.\n\nThe other apparently not-so-obvious result is that in plane-parallel geometry the frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the fundamental gravity wave with horizontal wavenumber \\(k\\) in a vertically semi-infinite fluid under constant gravity \\(g\\) is given by the dispersion relation \\(\\omega^{2} = gk\\), irrespective of both the equation of state of the fluid and the stratification of its background state. I should stress that the restoring force producing the oscillation is basically gravity, so the associated resonant mode is indeed a g mode, not a p mode as some have labelled it, because it is uncompressed (even though the fluid may be compressible) and so is independent of the sound speed. The resonant standing wave is the fundamental g mode, which for a star was named f mode by Cowling (1941); its frequency approaches the plane-parallel dispersion relation in the limit of high degree, where the sphericity of the background state has no local influence on the dynamics. There exist very similar gravity modes, concentrated in regions of rapid density variation, that do depend on stratification (e.g. Whitham, 1974), which Colin Rosenthal and I studied more recently in the stellar context (Rosenthal and Gough, 1994), and that can have very similar frequencies. They are sometimes called interfacial modes. In the case of a terrestrial lake, a body of water supporting the atmosphere above (which is normally ignored), such waves having \\(k^{-1}\\) much less than the depth of the lake are called deep-water waves.\n\nIt was as a result of the f-mode relation that I witnessed the mental agility of James Lighthill. I must have discussed the relation with someone in DAMTP who later had mentioned it to James. One morning at coffee time, James approached me to enquire of its justification: he told me that oceanographers were well aware of an augmentation of deep-water-wave frequencies by a stable density gradient caused by varying salinity, which can be calculated straightforwardly under the Boussinesq approximation; how therefore could I be right? I responded that what they had calculated was the product of error in the Boussinesq approximation, and started to explain why. After only a sentence or two James, no doubt relating what I was saying to all the facets of the subject with which he was intimately familiar, interrupted with a broad smile and said that of course it is quite obvious that I am right. So was the dispersion relation obvious to all? Not at least to solar physicists. Consequently, I was able to use it privately to assess the accuracy of published frequencies, both observed (e.g. Deubner, 1975) and numerically computed (e.g. Lubow, Rhodes, and Ulrich, 1980). Then one day I came across a publication by Jack Harvey and Tom Duvall (Figure 13) in which the f-mode frequencies fitted the theory perfectly. When next I saw Jack I asked him why his new observations were so much more accurate than the old. With a smile he said that he knew of the dispersion relation tucked away in a review that I had written for a conference (Gough, 1980) – he had been present at my talk – and that he had used it to recalibrate the angular scale on his telescope. As I describe in Section 27, the f mode plays an important role in establishing the orders \\(n\\) of high-degree solar p modes. I record another unobvious obvious result in Section 31.\n\nOn my return to Cambridge Fred Hoyle triggered my involvement in the solar-neutrino problem. He asked me to carry out a computation of solar evolution with gravitational settling of helium, up to that time universally ignored, thinking that that might reduce the neutrino luminosity \\(L_{\\nu}\\). My back-of-the-envelope estimates suggested that the effect of settling would be to augment \\(L_{\\nu}\\), not reduce it, but Fred thought that sufficient displacement of hydrogen from the energy-generating core of the Sun might subtly modify the structure in such a way as to counter expectation. Fred also thought, mistakenly, that I was experienced with computations of the kind that would be required; I didn’t dare put him right for fear of jeopardising the renewal of my appointment, for John Faulkner had already left for Santa Cruz and maybe Fred had hired me as a poor replacement. Fortunately, Bohdan Paczyński had left a"
