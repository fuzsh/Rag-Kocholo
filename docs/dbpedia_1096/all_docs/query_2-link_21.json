J.\n\nThe region of Alsace, located between the hereditary enemies of France and Germany, served as a trophy of war four times between 1870–1945. With each shift, French and German officials sought to win the allegiance of the local populace. In response to these pressures, Alsatians invoked regionalism—articulated as a political language, a cultural vision, and a community of identity—not only to define and defend their own interests against the nationalist claims of France and Germany, but also to push for social change, defend religious rights, and promote the status of the region within the larger national community.\n\nSubject: History (General)\n\nHb\n\nPaperback available\n\nPublished April 2008\n\nAlternative Exchanges\n\nSecond-Hand Circulations from the Sixteenth Century to the Present\n\nFontaine, L (ed)\n\nSubject: History (General)\n\nHb\n\neBook available Published November 2016\n\nAmbassadors of Realpolitik\n\nSweden, the CSCE and the Cold War\n\nMakko, A.\n\nThis groundbreaking study looks at the tension between realism and idealism in Swedish diplomacy during the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and 1975 Helsinki Accords. It offers a compelling counternarrative of this period, showing that Sweden strategically ignored human rights violations in Eastern Europe in its pursuit of national interests.\n\nSubject: History: 20th Century to Present\n\nHb\n\nPaperback available\n\neBook available Published July 2019\n\nAmbiguous Transitions\n\nGender, the State, and Everyday Life in Socialist and Postsocialist Romania\n\nMassino, J.\n\nAmbiguous Transitions provides an accessible, intimate exploration of gender and citizenship in socialist Romania.

As historian and physician Sabine Hildebrandt reveals, anatomists progressed through gradual stages of ethical transgression; in some cases, the traditional model of working with deceased bodies gave way to experimentation with the “future dead.”\n\nSubjects: History: World War II Genocide History\n\nHb\n\nPaperback available\n\neBook available Published April 2022\n\nAnglo-American Relations and the Transmission of Ideas\n\nA Shared Political Tradition?\n\nDobson, A. & Marsh, S.

(ed)\n\nThe history of modern Europe is often presented with the hindsight of present-day European integration, which was a genuinely liberal project based on political and economic freedom. Many other visions for Europe developed in the 20th century, however, were based on an idea of community rooted in pre-modern religious ideas, cultural or ethnic homogeneity, or even in coercion and violence. Anti-liberal Europe examines these visions, including those of anti-modernist Catholics, conservatives, extreme rightists as well as communists, arguing that antiliberal concepts in 20th century Europe were not the counterpart to, but instead part of the process of European integration.\n\nSubject: History: 20th Century to Present\n\nHb\n\neBook available Published August 2020\n\nAntisemitism in Galicia\n\nAgitation, Politics, and Violence against Jews in the Late Habsburg Monarchy\n\nBuchen, T.\n\nAntisemitism in Galicia investigates the interaction of agitation, violence, and politics against Jews on the periphery of the Danube monarchy.

(ed)\n\nThe 1915-1916 annihilation of the Armenians was the archetype of modern genocide, in which a state adopts a specific scheme geared to the destruction of an identifiable group of its own citizens. Official German diplomatic documents are of great importance in understanding the genocide, as only Germany had the right to report day-by-day in secret code about the ongoing genocide. The motives, methods, and after-effects of the Armenian Genocide echoed strongly in subsequent cases of state-sponsored genocide. Studying the factors that went into the Armenian Genocide not only gives us an understanding of historical genocide, but also provides us with crucial information for the anticipation and possible prevention of future genocides.\n\nSubjects: Genocide History History: 20th Century to Present\n\nHb\n\neBook available Published October 2018\n\nThe Art of Resistance\n\nCultural Protest against the Austrian Far Right in the Early Twenty-First Century\n\nFiddler, A.\n\nThe 1999 Austrian election results produced an uprising against a turn to the political right.

Within a few decades global economic integration reached a level that equaled, and in some respects surpassed, that of the present day. This book describes the interpenetration of the German economy with an emerging global economy before the First World War, while also demonstrating the huge challenge posed by globalization to the society and politics of the German Empire.\n\nSubject: History: 18th/19th Century\n\nHb\n\nPublished March 1999\n\nThe Chameleon State\n\nGlobal Culture and Policy Shifts in Britain and Germany, 1914-1933\n\nLiu, T-L.\n\nSubject: History: 20th Century to Present\n\nHb\n\neBook available Published October 2018\n\nChanges in the Air\n\nHurricanes in New Orleans from 1718 to the Present\n\nRohland, E.\n\nChanges in the Air looks at New Orleans and its changing cultural responses to hurricanes over three centuries, carefully exploring the complex interplay of sociopolitical, economic, legal, and cultural factors in the development or stagnation of adaptive practices.\n\nSubjects: Environmental Studies (General) History (General) Urban Studies\n\nHb\n\nPaperback available\n\nPublished December 2007\n\nChanging Cultural Tastes\n\nWriters and the Popular in Modern Germany\n\nWaine, A.\n\nSubjects: Literary Studies History: 20th Century to Present\n\nHb\n\neBook available Published January 2019\n\nThe Changing Meanings of the Welfare State\n\nHistories of a Key Concept in the Nordic Countries\n\nEdling, N.

The authors emphasize how local actors constructed their own adaptation of colonialism, identity, and autonomy, creating a multi-centric and entangled history of modern education. In both formal as well as informal aspects, they demonstrate that transnational and cross-cultural exchanges in education have been characterized by appropriation, re-contextualization, and hybridization, thereby rejecting traditional notions of colonial education as an export of pre-existing metropolitan educational systems.\n\nSubjects: Colonial History Educational Studies Cultural Studies (General)\n\nHb\n\neBook available Published June 2020\n\nConservation’s Roots\n\nManaging for Sustainability in Preindustrial Europe, 1100–1800\n\nDowling, A.

While, on the one hand, it facilitates transethnic integration and promotes a specifically postcolonial sense of common nationhood due to its heterogeneous origins, creole groups of people are often perceived ambivalently in the wake of colonialism and its demise, on the other. In this book, Jacqueline Knörr analyzes the social, historical, and political contexts of creoleness both at the grassroots and the State level, showing how different sections of society engage with creole identity in order to promote collective identification transcending ethnic and religious boundaries, as well as for reasons of self-interest and ideological projects.\n\nSubjects: Anthropology (General) Colonial History\n\nHb\n\nPaperback available\n\neBook available Published April 2018\n\nA Creole Nation\n\nNational Integration in Guinea-Bissau\n\nKohl, C.\n\nDespite high degrees of cultural and ethnic diversity as well as prevailing political instability, Guinea-Bissau’s population has developed a strong sense of national belonging.
