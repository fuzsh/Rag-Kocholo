        "text": "British citizens of Arab descent\n\nEthnic group\n\nBritish Arabs (Arabic: عرب بريطانيا) are British citizens of Arab descent. They share a common Arab ethnicity, culture, language and identity from different Arab countries. Arabs also come from non-Arab countries as ethnic minorities (e.g. Khuzestani Arabs).\n\nThe 2021 United Kingdom census recorded a population of 355,977 or 0.5% of the population in the United Kingdom, with about 40% of the whole population residing in Greater London.[1][2][3] In 2005, the BBC found that the majority of Arab residents in London hailed from Egypt, Morocco, Palestine, Yemen, Lebanon, the Gulf States and Iraq.[6] The 2011 census recorded a population of 249,911 in Great Britain, with no specific figure recorded for Northern Ireland as the Arab category was introduced later in Northern Ireland.[7]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus designation\n\n[edit]\n\n\"British Arabs\" is used as an ethnic designation by the National Association of British Arabs.[8] It is also employed by academics,[9] and in the media.[10] Unlike Black British or Asian British, the term \"British Arab\" was not one of those employed in government ethnicity categorisations used in the 2001 UK Census and for national statistics.[11] As a result, community members are believed to have been under-counted in previous population estimates according to the National Association of British Arabs (NABA).\n\nThis absence of a separate \"Arab\" category in the UK census obliged many to select other ethnicity categories.[12] In the late 2000s, the British government announced that an \"Arab\" ethnicity category would be added to the 2011 UK Census for the first time.[13] The decision came following lobbying by the National Association of British Arabs and other Arab organizations, who argued for the inclusion of a separate \"Arab\" entry to accommodate under-reported groups from the Arab world.[14]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nGreat Britain and the Arab world have engaged in commercial activities with one another since the medieval times.[6] Yemenis began to migrate to Britain since the 1860s via Aden, the main refuelling stop in the area, and settled around the docks in the port cities of Cardiff, Liverpool, South Shields, Hull, and London.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Yemenis working as stokers on steamships began moving ashore and set up boarding schools in the dock area. There are now an estimated 70,000 to 80,000 Yemenis in Britain.[15][6]\n\nEarly 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nIraqis began settling in London in the 1930s, and the UK has had a significant Iraqi population since the 1940s.[16] Liberal and radical dissidents in the Kingdom of Iraq sought refuge to the UK at the time. Supporters of the monarchy later sought refuge in the UK after it was overthrown in 1958.[16]\n\nArab migration to the United Kingdom significantly began in the 1940s and 1960s when Egyptians and Moroccans came in search of employment, and this generally increased as the Arab world wrestled for independence from European colonialism.[6]\n\nLate 20th and 21st centuries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Palestinian exoduses of 1948 and 1967 saw an influx and through the 70s and 80s. More Arabs arrived from the Gulf in the 1970s during the oil-boom era to set up businesses. Arab refugees also arrived as a result of conflicts in parts of the Arab world, such as the Lebanese civil war from 1975 to 1990 or the instability which followed the invasion of Iraq in 2003.[6] The United Kingdom settled approximately 20,000 Syrian refugees amid the Syrian civil war.[17]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish Arab population by region and country Region / Country 2021[19] 2011[23] Number % Number % England 320,203 0.57% 220,985 0.42% —Greater London 139,791 1.59% 106,020 1.30% —North West 43,865 0.59% 24,528 0.35% —West Midlands 31,790 0.53% 18,079 0.32% —South East 29,574 0.32% 19,363 0.22% —Yorkshire and the Humber 25,474 0.46% 21,340 0.40% —East of England 15,639 0.25% 10,367 0.18% —East Midlands 13,360 0.27% 9,746 0.21% —North East 10,406 0.39% 5,850 0.23% —South West 10,302 0.18% 5,692 0.11% Scotland[b] 22,304 0.41% 9,366 0.18% Wales 11,641 0.37% 9,615 0.31% Northern Ireland 1,817 0.10% 274 0.02% United Kingdom 355,965 0.53% 240,240 0.38%\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2021 United Kingdom census recorded a population of 355,977 or 0.5% of the population in the United Kingdom. When broken down by country, England recorded 320,215 (0.6%), Wales recorded 11,641 (0.4%)[1] and Northern Ireland recorded 1,817 (0.1%).[3] The equivalent census was recorded a year later in Scotland with a population of 11,641, or 0.4% of the population.[2] The ten local authorities with the largest proportion of British Arabs were largely concentrated in Greater London: Westminster (7.56%), Brent (5.27%), Kensington and Chelsea (4.45%), Ealing (4.39%), Hammersmith and Fulham (3.02%), Manchester (2.72%), Harrow (2.39%), Kingston upon Thames (2.13%), Camden (2.10%) and Barnet (1.90%). In Wales, the highest proportion was in Cardiff at 1.83%; in Scotland, the highest concentration was in Glasgow at 1.40%; and in Northern Ireland, the highest concentration was in Belfast at 0.29%.[26]\n\nIncluding both write-in and tick-box responses, 230,556 Arabs were recorded in the 2011 Census in England, 9,989 in Wales,[7] and 9,366 in Scotland.[27] In NABA's own report on the 2011 Census, it adds up answers from the write-in responses that it classifies as Arab, namely \"Arab\", \"African Arab\", \"White and Arab\", \"Moroccan\", \"Algerian\", “Egyptian”, \"North African\", \"Other Middle East\", or \"White and North African\", arguing that this gives a total of 366,769 Arabs in England and Wales but noting that there may be double-counting of individuals in this total, since it is uncertain how many of these individual write-in responses are also included in the general \"Arab\" category.[28]\n\nMost British Arabs live in the Greater London area, and many are either businesspeople, recent immigrants or students.[12] There are also sizable and long-established Yemeni Arab communities living in both Cardiff and the South Shields area near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\n\nTop 15 Areas (2021/22 Census)[29][30] Local authority Population Percentage Birmingham 19,196 1.7% Brent, London 17,924 5.3% Ealing, London 16,105 4.4% Westminster, London 15,439 7.6% Manchester 15,028 2.7% Sheffield 8,956 1.6% Glasgow 8,671 1.4% Liverpool 8,312 1.7% Barnet, London 7,383 1.9% Cardiff 6,624 1.8% Kensington and Chelsea, London 6,384 4.5% Harrow, London 6,239 2.4% Leeds 5,980 0.7% Hammersmith and Fulham, London 5,534 3.0% Hounslow, London 5,461 1.9%\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nReligion England and Wales 2011[31] 2021[32] Number % Number % Islam 178,195 77.27% 277,737 83.70% No religion 11,939 5.18% 15,963 4.81% Christianity 21,988 9.54% 13,671 4.12% Judaism 571 0.25% 425 0.13% Buddhism 402 0.17% 129 0.04% Hinduism 1,060 0.46% 103 0.03% Sikhism 509 0.22% 82 0.02% Other religions 859 0.37% 1,419 0.43% Not Stated 15,077 6.54% 22,314 6.72% Total 230,600 100% 331,843 100%\n\nCommunity\n\n[edit]\n\nA diverse community, British Arabs are represented in the business and media fields, among other areas. Miladi's 2006 survey of 146 community members during the summer of 2001 reported Al-Jazeera as being the respondents' preferred news outlet. Reasons supplied for the selection included the quality of the station's programs and transmission, its discussion of current issues in the Arab world, and the possibility of giving voice to the community's concerns and positions on various matters.[33]\n\nAdditionally, 2010 was a breakthrough year in terms of political participation. Several British Arabs ran for and/or were appointed to office as community representatives.[34][35]\n\nNotable British Arabs\n\n[edit]\n\nDennis W.
