Burbidge.\n\nFred Hoyle's Universe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGregory, Jane\n\n2005-08-01\n\nFred Hoyle was a Yorkshire truant who became the voice of British astronomy. For fifty years, he spoke out for astronomy in the newspapers, on government committees, at scientific meetings, in popular books and on the radio. He devised a never-ending history of the universe, and worked out how the elements were made. He founded a prestigious institute for theoretical astronomy and built a giant telescope, and if it rained on his summer holiday, he sat in his caravan and wrote science fiction novels for his legions of fans around the world. Fred Hoyle also claimed that diseases fall from the sky, that the big bang never happened, and that the Astronomer Royal should be abolished. When the outspoken Fred Hoyle spoke out for astronomy, some astronomers really wished he had kept his mouth shut. This book tells the behind-the-scenes story of Hoyle's widely acclaimed and deeply controversial role in the ideas, organization and public face of astronomy in post-war Britain. It chronicles the triumphs, acrimony, jealousies, rewards and bitter feuds of a field in turmoil, and meets the astronomers, contemplating cosmic questions, keeping secrets, losing their tempers, winkling information out of distant stars and, over tea on the lawn, discussing the finer points of libel law. Fred Hoyle's Universe draws on previously confidential government documents, recently released personal correspondence and interviews with Hoyle's friends, colleagues and critics, as well as with Hoyle himself, to bring you the man, the science, and the scandal behind the genial and genteel facade of the most exciting period in the history of astronomy.\n\nFred Hoyle's Universe.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWickramasinghe, C.; Burbidge, G.; Narlikar, J.\n\n2003-10-01\n\nThis volume contains papers presented at an international conference to celebrate Fred Hoyle's monumental contributions to astronomy, astrophysics and astrobiology and more generally to humanity and culture. The contributed articles highlight the important aspects of his scientific life and show how much of an example and inspiration he has been for over three generations in the 20th century. There are few people of whom it could be said they changed the way we perceive the world. Galileo Galilei, Nicholas Copernicus and Isaac Newton were amongst these. The inclusion of Fred Hoyle in this elite group may be contentious at the moment for the reason that in challenging the most cherished of Holy Grails in science he unwittingly offended many. But once the dust has settled over the many disputes that were raised and in the fullness of time there can be little doubt that Fred Hoyle will be ranked alongside these figures of history. Hoyle perceived science with an indomitable passion and an obsessive desire to find the truth wherever it lay. His singleness of purpose in this great mission and his deep suspicion of orthodoxy, his powerful intellect and imagination set him apart from most of his contemporaries in the last century. This volume includes papers presented at a commemorative conference held in Cardiff in June 2002. The material divides naturally into several sections: Personal Reminiscences, Stellar Structure and Evolution, Cosmology, Interstellar Matter, Comets and finally Panspermia. Each article pays its own tribute to Fred Hoyle for his inspiration and guidance that led to major breakthroughs in astrophysics and space science throughout the 20th century.

Hoyle's ideas concerning the nucleosynthesis cycle of stellar birth and death, rotational instability of supernovae, the onion-skin model of presupernovae, neutronization, nuclear statistical equilibrium and core collapse, thermonuclear supernovae, nucleosynthesis processes and freeze-out are discussed. The history of the clash of theory and experiment on the second excited state of 8Be and helium ignition in red giants is reviewed.\n\nBOOK REVIEW: A Journey with Fred Hoyle (Second Edition)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWickramasinghe, Chandra; Sterken, Christiaan\n\n2013-12-01\n\nI read A Journey with Fred Hoyle: The Search for Cosmic Life shortly after the first edition appeared in 2005. The second expanded edition of this remarkable autobiographical account brings the scientific story up to date. The added Epilogue offers reflections in 2012, and shows that some of Hoyle's and Wickramasinghe's heretical theories have become accepted science today: these scientists were among the forerunners of today's astrobiology. The book is the story - presented as a blend of personal anecdotes, travel stories, references to political and social events, and science writing - of the remarkable 40-year friendship and scientific collaboration between the British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and the Sri Lankan mathematician and astronomer Chandra Wickramasinghe. The author illuminates the story of his collaboration with Hoyle with interesting aspects of his personal life, such as the description of his educational background in Sri Lanka, and the story of how he, as a PhD student, made his first contact with his supervisor in 1960. The book also offers insights into Hoyle's and Wickramasinghe's family lives. The narrative also contains plenty of interstellar astrophysics along with the stories. Sir Fred Hoyle (1915-2001) was famous for his contribution to the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis, renowned for his coining (on BBC radio) of the term Big Bang and for his later rejection of that theory (coupled to his advocacy of the steady state cosmology), and famed as writer of more than a dozen science-fiction stories. He was the founding director of the Cambridge Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (that later became the Institute of Astronomy). Hoyle was a scientific whistleblower, a radical troublemaker, an unorthodox scientific mind, but also a victim of the system. Hoyle-Wickramasinghe thought was a long-term assault on conventional thinking: especially their notable concept of panspermia (that ever-present life pervades our universe) and their opposition to\n\nFred Hoyle: contributions to the theory of galaxy formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEfstathiou, George\n\nI review two fundamental contributions that Fred Hoyle made to the theory of galaxy formation. Hoyle was the first to propose that protogalaxies acquired their angular momentum via tidal torques from neighbouring perturbations during a period of gravitational instability. To my knowldege, he was also the first to suggest that the masses of galaxies could be explained by the requirement that primordial gas clouds cool radiatively on a suitable timescale. Tidal torques and cooling arguments play a central role in the modern theory of galaxy formation. It is a measure of Hoyle's breadth and inventiveness that he recognized the importance of these processes at such an early stage in the history of the subject.\n\nModern alchemy: Fred Hoyle and element building by neutron capture\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurbidge, E. Margaret\n\nFred Hoyle's fundamental work on building the chemical elements by nuclear processes in stars at various stages in their lives began with the building of elements around iron in the very dense hot interiors of stars. Later, in the paper by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle, we four showed that Hoyle's \"equilibrium process\" is one of eight processes required to make all of the isotopes of all the elements detected in the Sun and stars. Neutron capture reactions, which Fred had not considered in his epochal 1946 paper, but for which experimental data were just becoming available in 1957, are very important, in addition to the energy-generating reactions involving hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, for building all of the elements. They are now providing clues to the late stages of stellar evolution and the earliest history of our Galaxy. I describe here our earliest observational work on neutron capture processes in evolved stars, some new work on stars showing the results of the neutron capture reactions, and data relating to processes ending in the production of lead, and I discuss where this fits into the history of stars in our own Galaxy.\n\nA journey with Fred Hoyle. The search for cosmic life\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWickramasinghe, Chandra; Wickramasinghe, Kamala\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis is the story of the author's unique scientific journey with one of the most remarkable men of 20th century science. The journey begins in Sri Lanka, the author's native country, with his childhood acquaintance with Fred Hoyle's writings. The action then moves to Cambridge, where the famous Hoyle-Wickramasinghe collaborations begin. A research programme which was started in 1962 on the carbonaceous nature of interstellar dust leads, over the next two decades, to developments that are continued in both Cambridge and Cardiff. These developments prompt Hoyle and the author to postulate the organic theory of cosmic dust (which is now generally accepted), and then to challenge one of the most cherished paradigms of contemporary science - the theory that life originated on Earth in a warm primordial soup.\n\nRansom, Religion, and Red Giants: C.S. Lewis and Fred Hoyle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLarsen, Kristine\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFamed fantasy writer C.S. Lewis (1898-1963) was known to friends as a well-read astronomy aficionado. However, this medieval scholar and Christian apologist embraced a pre-Copernican universe (with its astrological overtones) in his Chronicles of Narnia series and defended the beauty and relevance of the geocentric model in his final academic work, \"The Discarded Image\". In the \"Ransom Trilogyâ (\"Out of the Silent Planet\", \"Perelandra\", and \"That Hideous Strength\") philologist Ransom (loosely based on Lewis's close friend J.R.R. Tolkien) travels to Lewis's visions of Mars and Venus, where he interacts with intelligent extraterrestrials, battles with evil scientists, and aids in the continuation of extraterrestrial Christian values. In the final book, Ransom is joined by a handful of colleagues in open warfare against the satanic N.I.C.E. (National Institute for Coordinated Experiments). Geneticist and evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane criticized Lewis for his scientifically inaccurate descriptions of the planets, and his disdain for the scientific establishment. Lewis responded to the criticism in essays of his own. Another of Lewis's favorite scientific targets was atheist Fred Hoyle, whom he openly criticized for anti-Christian statements in Hoyle's BBC radio series. Writer and Lewis friend Dorothy L. Sayers voiced her own criticism of Hoyle. In a letter, Lewis dismissed Hoyle as \"not a great philosopher (and none of my scientific colleagues think much of him as a scientist.â Given Lewis's lack of respect for Hoyle, and use of creative license in describing the planets, and the flat-earth, \"geocentricâ Narnia, it is surprising that Lewis very carefully includes an astronomically correct description of red giants in two novels in the Narnia series (\"The Magician's Nephew\" and \"The Last Battle\"). This inclusion is even more curious given that Fred Hoyle is well-known as one of the pioneers in the field of stellar death and the properties of red giants.\n\nGeorges LemaÃ®tre and Fred Hoyle: Contrasting Characters in Science and Religion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolder, Rodney D.\n\nGeorges LemaÃ®tre was a jocular Roman Catholic priest and Fred Hoyle a bluff Yorkshireman who despised organized religion. Both were giants of twentieth century cosmology but espoused diametrically opposed cosmological models. This paper explores the extent to which ideology, and particularly religion, played a part in the controversies over the big bang and steady-state theories. A particular problem for many cosmologists, including Hoyle, was posed by the idea that the universe had a temporal beginning: an eternal, unchanging universe seemed metaphysically preferable. And Hoyle was highly polemical about religion in his popular writings. In contrast, LemaÃ®tre saw no theological import from the big bang, and never entered a debate about its theological implications until, perhaps unexpectedly, he took issue with an address given by the Pope. Hoyle's seminal work on stellar nucleosynthesis led him to speak of a `superintellect monkeying with physics' though this was never identified with the God of classical theism. The work of both LemaÃ®tre and Hoyle resonates with more recent debates concerning cosmology.\n\nFred Hoyle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitton, Simon\n\n2011-02-01\n\nForeword Paul Davies; Prologue; 1.

It is responsible not only for increasing the metallicity of the galaxy but also for the most abundant gamma-ray-line emitters. Astrophysicists have inappropriately cited early work in this regard. The heavily cited B2FH paper (Burbidge et al., 1957) did not effectively address primary nucleosynthesis whereas Hoyle (Hoyle, 1954) had done so quite thoroughly in his infrequently cited 1954 paper. Even B2FH with Hoyle as coauthor seems strangely to not have appreciated what Hoyle (Hoyle, 1954) had achieved. I speculate that Hoyle must not have thoroughly proofread the draft written in 1956 by E.M. and G.R. Burbidge. The clear roadmap of primary nucleosynthesis advanced in 1954 by Hoyle describes the synthesis yielding the most abundant of the radioactive isotopes for astronomy, although that aspect was unrealized at the time. Secondary nucleosynthesis has also produced many observable radioactive nuclei, including the first gamma-ray-line emitter to be discovered in the galaxy and several others within stardust grains. Primary gamma-ray emitters would have been even more detectable in the early galaxy, when the birth rate of massive stars was greater; but secondary emitters, such as 26Al, would have been produced with smaller yield then owing to smaller abundance of seed nuclei from which to create them.\n\nHow Fred Hoyle Reconciled Radio Source Counts and the Steady State Cosmology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEkers, Ron\n\n2012-09-01\n\nIn 1969 Fred Hoyle invited me to his Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (IOTA) in Cambridge to work with him on the interpretation of the radio source counts. This was a period of extreme tension with Ryle just across the road using the steep slope of the radio source counts to argue that the radio source population was evolving and Hoyle maintaining that the counts were consistent with the steady state cosmology. Both of these great men had made some correct deductions but they had also both made mistakes. The universe was evolving, but the source counts alone could tell us very little about cosmology. I will try to give some indication of the atmosphere and the issues at the time and look at what we can learn from this saga. I will conclude by briefly summarising the exponential growth of the size of the radio source counts since the early days and ask whether our understanding has grown at the same rate.\n\nFred Hoyle's birth centennial\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitton, Simon\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSimon Mitton summarizes the RAS Specialist Discussion Meeting that examined from a historical perspective Hoyle's remarkable career and the impact of his science, in the first of two articles on his scientific legacy.\n\nThe Hoyle state in 12C\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreer, M.; Fynbo, H. O. U.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe 7.65 MeV, JÏ =0+, second excited state in 12C is known as the Hoyle-state after Fred Hoyle. In the 1950s Hoyle proposed the existence of the state in order to account for the stellar abundance of carbon. Aside from its key role in the synthesis of the elements it is believed to possess a rather unusual structure, where the dominant degrees of freedom are those of Î±-particle clusters rather than nucleons. An understanding of the properties of the Hoyle state, for example its radius and excitations, has been the focus of a major experimental activity. Similarly, unravelling precisely why a cluster state should arise at precisely the right energy to promote synthesis of carbon has been a central theoretical challenge. To a significant extent, the Hoyle-state has become a cornerstone for state-of-the-art nuclear theory. This review examines the present status of both theory and experiment and indicates directions for future developments to resolve some of the remaining open questions.\n\nThe Lyttleton-Hoyle correspondence 1939-42\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitton, S.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nFred Hoyle started to collaborate with his older colleague Raymond Lyttleton in 1938. Hoyle's doctoral research had been in nuclear physics, and his supervisors were Rudolph Peierls and Paul Dirac. His first papers were in quantum electrodynamics. When Hoyle decided to change his research field to astronomy, Lyttleton acted as a mentor, and it was he who suggested that Hoyle should look at the physics of accretion. From late-1939, Lyttleton and Hoyle were both scientific civil servants drafted in for war work. They were in different establishments and could communicate only by the postal service. Some 70 letters from Lyttleton to Hoyle have survived, but we do not have any copies of Hoyle's correspondence. Many letters are undated, so it required detective work to assemble them in the correct sequence. The correspondence shows that Lyttleton played the senior role in determining what problems they should tackle, and in what order. Apart from the scientific content, these letters are remarkable for the sharp personal remarks Lyttleton makes of other colleagues, and particularly the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society. I make the suggestion that the poisonous and prolonged nature of the correspondence considerably influenced Hoyle's subsequent attitude to the establishment, to government-employed astronomers, and to the RAS. This was detrimental when Hoyle found, later in his career, that he would have to provide answers to these stakeholders. This research has been supported by St Edmund's College, Cambridge, UK.\n\nOptical Transformation during Movement: Review of the Optical Concomitants of Egomotion\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-10-01\n\nSir Fred Hioyle, thq astronomer, derivEd thp basic relationship in a footnote tD a science fiction Look ( Hoyle , 1973, pp. 15-17).

To mark the centenary of the birth of Sir Fred Hoyle on 24 June 2015 this brief article retraces early developments that essentially heralded the new science of astrobiology.\n\nConflict in the Cosmos: the Hoyle-Ryle clashes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitton, S.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nFred Hoyle (1915-2001) made great contributions to both astrophysics and cosmology. His work in accretion theory (1939-45) and nuclear astrophysics (1946-57) continues to be admired and widely quoted. In cosmology, the field for which he is best known among the general public, his achievement is more questionable and marked by controversy. He was the first to use the expression Big Bang to describe the evolving universes of Eddington, Lemaitre, and Gamow. He named his own theory Continuous Creation, although the expression Steady State, coined by Bondi and Gold, became associated with Hoyle's model of a universe of infinite age, infinite extent, and matter creation. By 1952 the Cambridge radio astronomer Martin Ryle (1918-84) realised that his group could join the observational cosmology game. They would use counts of radio sources to discriminate between evolution and steady state. Ryle's first two surveys were inadequate and unreliable, although he did not see it that way, believing from the outset that he had proved Hoyle wrong. The third and fourth surveys did point to an evolutionary universe, but Hoyle refused to accept this, given Ryle's earlier track record in observational cosmology. The two argued passionately for a period of 20 years in a way that came to do serious harm to the standing of astronomy in the University of Cambridge. The paper examines the reasons for the failure of the two Cambridge astronomers to be more co-operative. This research was supported by St Edmund's College, Cambridge.\n\n'The Relation of Biology to Astronomy' and Theology: Panspermia and Panentheism; Revolutionary Convergences Advanced by Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalker, Theodore, Jr.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nIn contrast to the Copernican revolution in astro-geometry, the Hoyle-Wickramasinghe contribution to the recent and continuing revolution in astrobiology - \"cometary panspermia\" - features astronomy and biology converging toward theology. They employed astro-biotic reasoning (often labeled \"anthropic\" reasoning) to demonstrate that life is made possible by the deliberate controlling influence of the living all-embracing \"intelligent universe.\" This is consistent with panentheism [pan-en-theos-ism, not pantheism]. As advanced by Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, cometary panspermia is panentheistic. Also, neoclassical panentheism requires generic panspermia, and favors cometary panspermia.\n\nPeople\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2001-11-01\n\nSir Fred Hoyle, 1915 2001 Astronomer, author and popularizer of science 'There is a coherent plan in the universe, but I don't know what it's a plan for...' Sir Fred Hoyle, 1915 2001 Fred Hoyle, who passed away on 20 August 2001, was one of the most important figures in 20th century physics and astronomy. He is most famous for coining the term 'Big Bang' in a BBC radio broadcast in 1950, even though the fact that his comment was an insult seems to have been lost in time. He left behind a lasting body of work, foremost of which is his work with Willy Fowler and the Burbidges on the origin of the chemical elements in the 1950s. Sir Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal and Professor at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, speaking to Physics Education said 'Hoyle was a great astrophysicist, who from 1945 to 1970 contributed more good creative ideas than anyone else in the world.' Fred Hoyle was born at Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire in June 1915. A precocious child who knew his 12 times table aged 4 and could navigate by the stars before he was 10, he won a scholarship to Bingley Grammar School and from there moved on to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Hoyle excelled at mathematics and won several prizes before he graduated in 1936. He became fascinated by the work of physicist Rudolf Peierls, who became his PhD supervisor, before being replaced by Maurice Pryce when Peierls departed for Birmingham. Hoyle became a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge in 1939. During the war Hoyle worked at an Admiralty radar establishment on the south coast and met Eastern European Ã©migrÃ©s Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi. During this time they developed the theory of continuous creation known as the Steady State Theory of the universe. This states that matter is continuously created at a small rate to replace the matter lost to the expanding universe. Around this same time Ralph Alpher, Hans Bethe and George Gamow postulated the idea of a Universe forged in a hot explosion. After\n\nSir Hermann Bondi KCB\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoxburgh, Ian W.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nHermann Bondi was an Applied Mathematician of distinction who will be remembered by fellow scientists for his outstanding contributions to astronomy, cosmology and General Relativity, and particularly for his pioneering contributions to our understanding of gravitational waves, his foundational work on accretion, and as co-creator with Tommy Gold and Fred Hoyle of the steady state theory of cosmology. But Hermann had an equally important second career in scientific administration: advising the UK Government on the Thames Barrier, as Director General of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO; now the European Space Agency (ESA)), as Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government on Defence and then on Energy, as Chairman of the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), and finally as Master of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was knighted in 1973. He continued his research on gravitational radiation throughout his administrative career and published his 16th paper in the series on gravitational waves in 2004. Hermann will be remembered not only for his contributions to science and administration, but for his outstanding communication skills and as a charismatic, warm, and stimulating person.\n\n2013 - Life is a Cosmic Phenomenon : The \"Search for Water\" evolves into the \"Search for Life\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmith, William E.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWe propose that the 2013 data from the Kepler Mission (giving a current estimate of the number of earth-like planets in the habitable zone of sun-like stars as 144 billion), has caused a consciousness change in human belief in the probability of life off earth.

We explore the subsystem components of the shield and assess some options for these components using break-though technologies already available.\n\nFRED user's manual\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShilling, J.\n\n1984-02-01\n\nFRED, the friendly editor, is a screen-based structured editor.

Chandra\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe theory of cometary panspermia, developed by the late Sir Fred Hoyle and the present author argues that life originated cosmically as a unique event in one of a great multitude of comets or planetary bodies in the Universe. Life on Earth did not originate here but was introduced by impacting comets, and its further evolution was driven by the subsequent acquisition of cosmically derived genes. Explicit predictions of this theory published in 1979-1981, stating how the acquisition of new genes drives evolution, are compared with recent developments in relation to horizontal gene transfer, and the role of retroviruses in evolution. Precisely-stated predictions of the theory of cometary panspermia are shown to have been verified.\n\nDNA Sequencing and Predictions of the Cosmic Theory of Life\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWickramasinghe, N.

But how exponential is the tail? Are they merely decaying with some smoothly decreasing decline rate, or is the functional form an exponential to within the uncertainties? If the shape really is an exponential, then it would be reasonable to assign some physically significant time scale to the burst. That is, there would have to be some specific mechanism that produces the characteristic decay profile. So if an exponential is found, then we will know that the decay light curve profile is governed by one mechanism (at least for simple FREDs) instead of by complex/multiple mechanisms. As such, a specific number amenable to theory can be derived for each FRED. We report on the fitting of exponentials (and two other shapes) to the tails of ten bright BATSE bursts. The BATSE trigger numbers are 105, 257, 451, 907, 1406, 1578, 1883, 1885, 1989, and 2193. Our technique was to perform a least square fit to the tail from some time after peak until the light curve approaches background. We find that most FREDs are not exponentials, although a few come close. But since the other candidate shapes come close just as often, we conclude that the FREDs are misnamed.\n\nFRED: a program development tool\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShilling, J.\n\n1985-09-01\n\nThe structured, screen-based editor FRED is introduced. FRED provides incremental parsing and semantic analysis. The parsing is based on an LL(1) top-down algorithm which has been modified to provide follow-the-cursor parsing and soft templates. The languages accepted by the editor are LL(1) languages with the addition of the Unknown and preferred production non-terminal classes. The semantic analysis is based on the incremental update of attribute grammar equations.

The currently fashionable graphite-silicate-organic grain model has all its essential aspects unequivocally traceable to original peer-reviewedpublicationsbytheauthorand/orFredHoyle. Theprevailingreluctancetoaccepttheseclear-cut priorities may be linked to our further work that argued for interstellar grains and organics to have a biological provenance - a position perceived as heretical.

O. U.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nUsing an array of high-purity Compton-suppressed germanium detectors, we performed an independent measurement of the beta-decay branching ratio from B-12 to the second-excited state, also known as the Hoyle state, in C-12. Our result is 0.64(11)%, which is a factor similar to 2 smaller than the previously established literature value, but is in agreement with another recent measurement. This could indicate that the Hoyle state is more clustered than previously believed. The angular correlation of the Hoyle state. cascade has also been measured for the first time. It is consistent with theoretical predictions.\n\nImproved Limit on Direct Î± Decay of the Hoyle State\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKirsebom, O. S.; Alcorta, M.; Borge, M. J.

U.; Galaviz, D.; Jonson, B.; Madurga, M.; Nilsson, T.; Nyman, G.; Riisager, K.; Tengblad, O.; TurriÃ³n, M.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe current evaluation of the triple-Î± reaction rate assumes that the Î± decay of the 7.65 MeV, 0+ state in C12, commonly known as the Hoyle state, proceeds sequentially via the ground state of Be8. This assumption is challenged by the recent identification of two direct Î±-decay branches with a combined branching ratio of 17(5)%. If correct, this would imply a corresponding reduction in the triple-Î± reaction rate with important astrophysical consequences. We have used the B11(He3,d) reaction to populate the Hoyle state and measured the decay to three Î± particles in complete kinematics. We find no evidence for direct Î±-decay branches, and hence our data do not support a revision of the triple-Î± reaction rate. We obtain an upper limit of 5Ã10-3 on the direct Î± decay of the Hoyle state at 95% C.L., which is 1 order of magnitude better than a previous upper limit.\n\nDecay modes of the Hoyle state in 12C\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, H.; Bonasera, A.; Huang, M.; Zhang, S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRecent experimental results give an upper limit less than 0.043% (95% C.L.) to the direct decay of the Hoyle state into 3Î± respect to the sequential decay into 8Be + Î±. We performed one and two-dimensional tunneling calculations to estimate such a ratio and found it to be more than one order of magnitude smaller than experiment depending on the range of the nuclear force. This is within high statistics experimental capabilities. Our results can also be tested by measuring the decay modes of high excitation energy states of 12C where the ratio of direct to sequential decay might reach 10% at E*(12C) = 10.3 MeV. The link between a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) and the direct decay of the Hoyle state is also addressed. We discuss a hypothetical 'Efimov state' at E*(12C) = 7.458 MeV, which would mainly sequentially decay with 3Î± of equal energies: a counterintuitive result of tunneling. Such a state, if it would exist, is at least 8 orders of magnitude less probable than the Hoyle's, thus below the sensitivity of recent and past experiments.\n\nFRED 2: an immunoinformatics framework for Python\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchubert, Benjamin; Walzer, Mathias; Brachvogel, Hans-Philipp; Szolek, AndrÃ¡s; Mohr, Christopher; Kohlbacher, Oliver\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSummary: Immunoinformatics approaches are widely used in a variety of applications from basic immunological to applied biomedical research.

S.; Riisager, K.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe use a sequential R-matrix model to describe the breakup of the Hoyle state into three Î± particles via the ground state of 8Be. It is shown that even in a sequential picture, features resembling a direct breakup branch appear in the phase-space distribution of the Î± particles. We construct a toy model to describe the Coulomb interaction in the three-body final state and its effects on the decay spectrum are investigated. The framework is also used to predict the phase-space distribution of the Î± particles emitted in a direct breakup of the Hoyle state and the possibility of interference between a direct and sequential branch is discussed. Our numerical results are compared to the current upper limit on the direct decay branch determined in recent experiments.\n\nSocioeconomic Impact Analysis Study.

The pronounced cluster nature of this state allows the triple-Î± process in stars with a reaction rate regulated by its structure properties. To precisely estimate the direct component in the 3Î± decay mechanism of the Hoyle state, we developed a new experiment using the14N(d,Î±)12C reaction at 10.5MeV. An anti-coincidence telescope was used to identify the Î± ejectiles leading the residual12C in the Hoyle state, while its decays in 3Î± were studied by means of a new hodoscope of silicon detectors, superOSCAR, placed in kinematical coincidence to fully reconstruct the events. Details of the experiment and preliminary results are discussed in the text.\n\nAnnual Report of the Operations Research Center and Department of Systems Engineering for Academic Year 2004\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2004-09-01\n\n1, pp. 5- 17, 2004.

This process occurs through a resonance in the 12C nucleus, famously known as the Hoyle state. In this state, the 12C nucleus exists as a cluster of Î± particles. The state is the band-head for a rotational band with the 2+ rotational excitation predicted in the energy region 9 - 11 MeV. This rotational excitation can affect the triple-Î± process reaction rate by more than an order of magnitude at high temperatures (109 K). Depending on the energy of the resonance, the knowledge of the state can also help determine the structure of the Hoyle state. In the work presented here, the state of interest is populated by beta decay of radioactive 12N ion beam delivered by the IGISOL facility at JYFL, JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤.\n\nOn the 'flip-flop' instability of Bondi-Hoyle accretion flows\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLivio, Mario; Soker, Noam; Matsuda, Takuya; Anzer, Ulrich\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA simple physical interpretation is advanced by means of an analysis of the shock cone in the accretion flows past a compact object and with an examination of the accretion-line stability analyses. The stability of the conical shock is examined against small angular deflections with attention given to several simplifying assumptions. A line instability is identified in the Bondi-Hoyle accretion flows that leads to the formation of a large opening-angle shock. When the opening angle becomes large the instability becomes irregular oscillation. The analytical methodology is compared to previous numerical configurations that demonstrate different shock morphologies. The Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto a compact object is concluded to generate a range of nonlinear instabilities in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases with a quasiperiodic oscillation in the linear regime.\n\nThree-dimensional simulation of free-electron laser harmonics with FRED\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSharp, W.M.; Scharlemann, E.T.; Fawley, W.M.\n\n1989-11-20\n\nFRED3D, a single-mode three-dimensional version of the FEL simulation code FRED, has been modified to follow the growth of signal components at the fundamental frequency and at even and odd harmonics.

Space Sci. 314:79-82, 2008), for inflationary scenario. It involves a variable cosmological constant, which decreases with time, jointly with energy density, cosmic pressure, shear, vorticity, and Hubbleâs parameter, while the scale factor, total spin and scalar field increase exponentially. The post-inflationary fluid resembles a perfect one, though total spin grows, but not the angular speed (Berman, in Astrophys. Space Sci. 312:275, 2007). The Pryce-Hoyle tensor, which can measured by the number of injected particles per unit proper volume and time, as well as shear and vorticity, can be neglected in the aftermath of inflation (âno-hairâ).\n\nErgonomic Evaluation of the Foot Restraint Equipment Device (FRED)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWhitmore, Mihriban; Chmielewski, Cindy; Qazi, A.

As part of these evaluations, KC-135 flights were conducted to investigate user/ workstation/ restraint integration for microgravity use of the FRED with the RMS workstation. This evaluation was a pre-cursor to Detailed Supplementary Objective (DSO) - 904 on STS-88. On that mission, a small-statured astronaut will be using the FRED restraint while working at the Aft RMS workstation. The DSO will collect video for later posture analyses, as well as subjective data in the form of an electronic questionnaire. This report describes the current FRED KC-135 evaluations. The primary objectives were to evaluate the usability of the FRED and to verify the DSO in-flight setup. The restraint interface evaluation consisted of four basic areas of restraint use: 1) adjustability; 2) general usability and comfort; 3) usability at the RMS workstation; and 4) assembly and disassembly.\n\nNASA honors Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise Jr.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2009-01-01\n\nNASA Administrator Charles Bolden (left) presents the Ambassador of Exploration Award (an encased moon rock) to Biloxi native and Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise Jr. (right) for his contributions to space exploration.

The breadth of Fred's published research from 1927 through 2000 is quite extraordinary. Although his collected works were published in two massive volumes in 1972, shortly before his retirement, Fred's research contributions continued for another three decades - and another volume is planned. Fred Lawrence Whipple was born on November 5, 1906 on a farm in Red Oak Iowa. His parents were Harry Lawrence and Celestia (MacFarl) Whipple. At the age of fifteen, the Whipple family moved to California where Fred studied mathematics at Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles. As a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley in 1930, he was one of the first to compute an orbit for the newly discovered planet Pluto. Upon receiving his PhD in 1931, he joined the staff of the Harvard College Observatory. He was Chairman of the Harvard Department of Astronomy (1949 - 1956), Director or the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (1955 - 1973), Phillips Professor of Astronomy (1968 - 1977) and Emeritus Phillips Professor of astronomy (1977 - 2004). In 1928 he married Dorothy Woods and their son, Earle Raymond, survives him. The marriage ended in divorce in 1935. Eleven years later, he married Babette F. Samelson and she too survives him, as do their two daughters Laura and (Dorothy) Sandra. Shortly after arriving at Harvard in the early 1930's, Fred developed a photographic tracking network to determine meteor trajectories from simultaneous observations from two or more stations. The photographic trails, chopped by a rotating shutter, allowed their orbits in space to be determined accurately. With the strong involvement of Richard McCrosky and others, he concluded in the early 1960's that most of these meteors were on comet-like orbits and less than 1% of the naked eye, sporadic meteors could be traced to an\n\nThe Fred S.

The boards are known to CDF by the acronym 'FRED'. The data acquisition scheme for CDF allows for up to 16 different parts of the detector, called 'Partitions', to run independently. Four partitions are reserved for physics runs and sophisticated calibration and debugging: they use the common Level 1 and Level 2 trigger logic and have access to information from all the components of the CDF detector. These four partitions are called ''CDF Partitions''. The remaining twelve partitions have no accessmoreÂ Â» to the common trigger logic and provide their own Level 1 and Level 2 signals: they are called ''Autonomous Partitions''.

In yeast, origin activity within heterochromatin is negatively controlled by the histone H4K16 deacetylase, Sir2, and at some heterochromatic loci also by the nucleosome binding protein, Sir3. The prevailing view has been that direct functions of Sir2 and Sir3 are confined to heterochromatin. However, growth defects in yeast mutants compromised for loading the MCM helicase, such as cdc6-4, are suppressed by deletion of either SIR2 or SIR3. While these and other observations indicate that SIR2,3 can have a negative impact on at least some euchromatic origins, the genomic scale of this effect was unknown. It was also unknown whether this suppression resulted from direct functions of Sir2,3 within euchromatin, or was an indirect effect of their previously established roles within heterochromatin. Using MCM ChIP-Seq, we show that a SIR2 deletion rescued MCM complex loading at ~80% of euchromatic origins in cdc6-4 cells. Therefore, Sir2 exhibited a pervasive effect at the majority of euchromatic origins. Using MNase-H4K16ac ChIP-Seq, we show that origin-adjacent nucleosomes were depleted for H4K16 acetylation in a SIR2-dependent manner in wild type (i.e. CDC6) cells. In addition, we present evidence that both Sir2 and Sir3 bound to nucleosomes adjacent to euchromatic origins. The relative levels of each of these molecular hallmarks of yeast heterochromatin-SIR2-dependent H4K16 hypoacetylation, Sir2, and Sir3 -correlated with how strongly a SIR2 deletion suppressed the MCM loading defect in cdc6-4 cells. Finally, a screen for histone H3 and H4 mutants that could suppress the cdc6-4 growth defect identified amino acids that map to a surface of the nucleosome important for Sir3 binding. We conclude that heterochromatin proteins directly modify the local chromatin environment of euchromatic DNA replication origins.\n\nFan Blade Development\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-09-01\n\nReviewed by: IP.

Increased toxicity and resistance to the existing repertoire of drugs has been reported. Hence, an urgent need exists for identifying newer drugs and drug targets. Previous reports have shown sirtuins (Silent Information Regulator) from kinetoplastids as promising drug targets. Leishmania species code for three SIR2 (Silent Information Regulator) related proteins. Here, we for the first time report the functional characterization of SIR2 related protein 2 (SIR2RP2) of L. donovani. Methodology Recombinant L. donovani SIR2RP2 was expressed in E. coli and purified. The enzymatic functions of SIR2RP2 were determined. The subcellular localization of LdSIR2RP2 was done by constructing C-terminal GFP-tagged full-length LdSIR2RP2. Deletion mutants of LdSIR2RP2 were generated in Leishmania by double targeted gene replacement methodology. These null mutants were tested for their proliferation, virulence, cell cycle defects, mitochondrial functioning and sensitivity to known SIR2 inhibitors. Conclusion Our data suggests that LdSIR2RP2 possesses NAD+-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. However, NAD+-dependent deacetylase and desuccinylase activities were not detected. The protein localises to the mitochondrion of the promastigotes. Gene deletion studies showed that ÎLdSIR2RP2 null mutants had restrictive growth phenotype associated with accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase and compromised mitochondrial functioning. The null mutants had attenuated infectivity. Deletion of LdSIR2RP2 resulted in increased sensitivity of the parasites to the known SIR2 inhibitors. The sirtuin inhibitors inhibited the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of recombinant LdSIR2RP2. In conclusion, sirtuins could be used as potential new drug targets for visceral leishmaniasis.

Timber volume is to be assessed by determining the age and size of pine forests from SIR-B data. Soil moisture is to be investigated by comparing SIR-B data with simultaneous gravimetric data.

Silencing in the rDNA occurs by a novel mechanism that depends on a single Silent Information Regulator (SIR) gene, SIR2. SIR4, essential for other silenced loci, paradoxically inhibits rDNA silencing. In this study, we elucidate a regulatory mechanism for rDNA silencing based on the finding that rDNA silencing strength directly correlates with cellular Sir2 protein levels. The endogenous level of Sir2p was shown to be limiting for rDNA silencing. Furthermore, small changes in Sir2p levels altered rDNA silencing strength. In rDNA silencing phenotypes, sir2 mutations were shown to be epistatic to sir4 mutations, indicating that SIR4 inhibition of rDNA silencing is mediated through SIR2. Furthermore, rDNA silencing is insensitive to SIR3 overexpression, but is severely reduced by overexpression of full-length Sir4p or a fragment of Sir4p that interacts with Sir2p. This negative effect of SIR4 overexpression was overridden by co-overexpression of SIR2, suggesting that SIR4 directly inhibits the rDNA silencing function of SIR2. Finally, genetic manipulations of SIR4 previously shown to promote extended life span also resulted in enhanced rDNA silencing. We propose a simple model in which telomeres act as regulators of rDNA silencing by competing for limiting amounts of Sir2 protein.

Hoyle referred to Lamaitre's hypothesis sarcastically as ``this big bang idea'' during a program broadcast on March 28, 1949 on the BBC. Hoyle's continuous creation or steady state theory can not explain the microwave background radiation or cosmic whisper discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1964. The expansion and subsequent cooling of Lemaitre's hot ``primeval atom'' explains the whisper. ``Big bang'' makes no physical sense, as there was no matter (or space) to carry the sound that Hoyle's term implies. The ``big bang'' is a conjecture. New discoveries may be able to predict the observed ``whispering cosmos'' as well as dark matter and the nature of dark energy. The ``whispering universe'' is cooler cosmology than the big bang. Reference: Carr, Paul H. 2006. ``From the 'Music of the Spheres' to the 'Whispering Cosmos.'

The S. pombe sir2+ gene encodes a nuclear protein that is not essential for viability or for resistance to treatment with UV or a microtubule-destabilizing agent. However, sir2+ is essential for full transcriptional silencing of centromeres, telomeres, and the cryptic mating-type loci. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results suggest that the Sir2 protein acts directly at these chromosomal regions. Enrichment of Sir2p at silenced regions does not require the HP1 homolog Swi6p; instead, Swi6-GFP localization to telomeres depends in part on Sir2p. The phenotype of sir2 swi6 double mutants supports a model whereby Sir2p functions prior to Swi6p at telomeres and the silent mating-type loci. However, Sir2p does not appear to be essential for the localization of Swi6p to centromeric foci. Cross-complementation experiments showed that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIR2 gene can function in place of S. pombe sir2+, suggesting overlapping deacetylation substrates in both species. These results also suggest that, despite differences in most of the other molecules required, the two distantly related yeast species share a mechanism for targeting Sir2p homologs to silent chromatin.

The SIR-B instrument is an upgraded version of SIR-A that has the additional capability of tilting the antenna mechanically to acquire data at incidence angles that vary from 15 to 60 deg. Like SEASAT and SIR-A, SIR-B will be an L-band (23-cm) HH polarized radar. The variable-incidence-angle capability will allow several experiments. A specific area may be imaged with a variety of incidence angles on successive days. These images can then be registered and used to produce curves of backscatter as a function of incidence angle for various terrain types. These curves can be used ultimately to characterize the terrain. Stereoimaging may also be done in the multiple-incidence-angle mode. In addition, large areas may be imaged and mosaicked together with only slight variations in incidence angle with each swath.\n\nFred Neufeld and pneumococcal serotypes: foundations for the discovery of the transforming principle.\n\nPubMed\n\nEichmann, Klaus; Krause, Richard M\n\n2013-07-01\n\nDuring the first decade of the twentieth century, the German bacteriologist Fred Neufeld, later Director of the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin, first described the differentiation of pneumococci into serotypes on the basis of type-specific antisera. This finding was essential for subsequent research at the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research (RIMR) in New York, and elsewhere, aiming for the conquest of human pneumococcal pneumonia, including antiserum therapy, the discovery that the type-specific antigens were carbohydrates, and the development of effective multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines. Moreover, on the basis of pneumococcal serotypes Fred Griffith, in 1928 in London, discovered pneumococcal transformation, and Oswald T. Avery and coworkers, in 1944 at RIMR, identified DNA as the transforming substance. This sequence of events, leading to today's knowledge that genes consist of DNA, was initiated by a farsighted move of Simon Flexner, first Director of the RIMR, who asked Neufeld to send his pneumococcal typing strains, thus setting the stage for pneumococcal research at RIMR. Here, we describe Fred Neufeld's contributions in this development, which have remained largely unknown.\n\nAstronaut Fred Haise - Suiting Room - Prelaunch - KSC\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1970-04-11\n\nS70-34851 (11 April 1970) --- A space suit technician talks with astronaut Fred W.

Within the nucleus, Sir2 is associated with telomere clusters in the nuclear periphery and rDNA in the nucleolus and regulates gene silencing at these genomic sites. How distribution of Sir2 between telomere and rDNA is regulated is not known. Here we show that Sir2 is sumoylated and this modification modulates the intra-nuclear distribution of Sir2. We identify Siz2 as the key SUMO ligase and show that multiple lysines in Sir2 are subject to this sumoylation activity. Mutating K215 alone counteracts the inhibitory effect of Siz2 on telomeric silencing. SUMO modification of Sir2 impairs interaction with Sir4 but not Net1 and, furthermore, SUMO modified Sir2 shows predominant nucleolar localization. Our findings demonstrate that sumoylation of Sir2 modulates distribution between telomeres and rDNA and this is likely to have implications for Sir2 function in other loci as well.

V.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nFor the first time the Hoyle-Narlikar theory with creation of matter and a variable gravitational constant G, is subjected to the following cosmological tests: (1) the magnitude versus z relation, (2) the N(m) versus m relation for quasars, (3) the metric angular diameters versus z relation, (4) the isophotal angles versus z relation, (5) the log N-log S radio source count, and finally (6) the 3 K radiation. It is shown that the theory passes all these tests just as well as the standard cosmology, with the additional advantage that the geometry of the universe is uniquely determined, with a curvature parameter equal to zero. It is also interesting to note that the variability of G affects the log N-log S curve in a way similar to the density evolution introduced in standard cosmologies. The agreement with the data is therefore achieved without recourse to an ad hoc density evolution.\n\nUsing FRED Data to Teach Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMÃ©ndez-Carbajo, Diego; Asarta, Carlos J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this article, the authors discuss the use of Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) statistics to teach the concept of price elasticity of demand in an introduction to economics course.

The aim of this study is to discuss the results and complications of this new flow diverter device (FDD). Between November 2013 and April 2015, 20 patients (15 female and five male) harboring 24 cerebral aneurysms were treated with FRED FDD in a single center. Complete occlusion was obtained in 20/24 aneurysms (83Â %) and partial occlusion in four (17Â %). Intraprocedural technical complication occurred in one case (4Â %) and post-procedural complications in three (12Â %). None reported neurological deficits (mRSâ=â0). All FRED were patent at follow-up. No early or delayed aneurysm rupture, no subarachnoid (SAH) or intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) no ischemic complications and no deaths occurred. Endovascular treatment with FRED FDD is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, resulting in a high rate of occlusion. The FRED is substantially equivalent to the other known FDDs, which show similar functions and technical profiles.\n\nAPOLLO 13 CREW JOHN SWIGERT, JAMES LOVELL, AND FRED HAISE\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1970-01-01\n\nJohn L.

In 1903, Svante Arrhenius suggested that spores could be transported on stellar winds without comets. In 1984, Sir Fred Hoyle claimed to see the infrared signature of vast clouds of dried bacteria and diatoms. In 2012, the Polonnaruwa carbonaceous chondrite revealed fossilized diatoms apparently living on a comet. However, Arrhenius' spores were thought to perish in the long transit between stars. Those calculations, however, assume that maximum velocities are limited by solar winds to ~5 km/s. Herbig-Haro objects and T-Tauri stars, however, are young stars with jets of several 100 km/s that might provide the necessary propulsion. The central engine of bipolar astrophysical jets is not presently understood, but we argue it is a kinetic plasma instability of a charged central magnetic body. We show how to make a bipolar jet in a belljar. The instability is non-linear, and thus very robust to scaling laws that map from microquasars to active galactic nuclei. We scale up to stellar sizes and recalculate the viability/transit-time for spores carried by supersonic jets, to show the viability of the Arrhenius mechanism.\n\nMyeloperoxidase can differentiate between sepsis and non-infectious SIRS and predicts mortality in intensive care patients with SIRS.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchrijver, Irene T; Kemperman, Hans; Roest, Mark; Kesecioglu, Jozef; de Lange, Dylan W\n\n2017-09-15\n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a clinical syndrome following inflammation. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish SIRS following an infection, i.e., sepsis, from non-infectious SIRS. Myeloperoxidase is a hemeprotein stored in the neutrophil azurophilic granules and is one of the main pillars of neutrophil attack. Therefore, we hypothesized that myeloperoxidase can differentiate between sepsis and non-infectious SIRS in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the intensive care unit (ICU). An observational single-center cohort study was conducted measuring myeloperoxidase in patients with SIRS in the first 48Â h after admission. The outcomes were established using predefined definitions. Thirty-day mortality was retrospectively assessed. We found significantly higher levels of myeloperoxidase in patients with sepsis and septic shock compared to patients without sepsis (60Â ng/ml versus 43Â ng/ml, PÂ =Â 0.002). Myeloperoxidase levels were related to 30-day mortality (PÂ =Â 0.032), and high MPO levels on top of a high APACHE IV score further increased mortality risk. We show that myeloperoxidase is a potentially novel biomarker for sepsis in the ICU. Myeloperoxidase could eventually help in diagnosing sepsis and predicting mortality. However, more research is necessary to confirm our results.\n\nClinical Epidemiology of SIRS and Sepsis in Newly Admitted Children.\n\nPubMed\n\nGanjoo, Sheetal; Ahmad, Kaisar; Qureshi, Umar Amin; Mir, Zahed Hussain\n\n2015-08-01\n\nTo assess the clinical and demographic profile of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, among newly admitted children in different age groups in a hospital in North India. This prospective study was conducted at a referral care centre in Northern India. All children, age group 0 to <18 y, admitted on days selected for study were screened and those with abnormal temperature and abnormal leukocyte count were included for further assessment. A total of twenty \"24Â h\" periods were randomly chosen during the study period. Patients were assessed according to age specific vital signs and laboratory values to diagnose Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and to gain clinical and demographic data. The criteria laid at International consensus conference, 2002, were used to define patients as SIRS, Sepsis, Severe sepsis and Septic shock. During the study period, a total of 865 patients were screened for SIRS. Prevalence of SIRS amongst hospitalised children was 23Â % (nâ=â201). Seventy nine percent (nâ=â159) of patients had infection associated SIRS and 21Â % (42) had non-infective SIRS. Sixty four percent (nâ=â129) SIRS patients had uncomplicated sepsis, 15Â % (nâ=â30) patients fulfilled criteria for severe sepsis. Out of the latter 30, 19 had septic shock. Organ dysfunction in SIRS was noted in 25Â % (nâ=â51). 37.25Â % (nâ=â19) had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The most common organism isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (nâ=â9). Focus of infection in majority was pulmonary (44Â %). Mean duration of antibiotic therapy and hospital stay in the SIRS group were 6.4 and 6.5 d respectively. In the group without SIRS, mean duration were 2.44 d and 3.07 d respectively The differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, the proportion of sepsis contributing to SIRS is high in a tertiary care hospital. Therefore rapid recognition of SIRS is essential.

While only close binary stars will eventually interact with one another, even the widest binary systems interact with their gaseous surroundings. The rates of accretion and the gaseous drag forces arising in these interactions are the key to understanding how these systems evolve. This poster examines accretion flows around a binary system moving supersonically through a background gas. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion using the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of semi-major axis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of the pair. On large scales, gas is gravitationally focused by the center-of-mass of the binary, leading to dynamical friction drag and to the accretion of mass and momentum. On smaller scales, the orbital motion imprints itself on the gas. Notably, the magnitude and direction of the forces acting on the binary inherit this orbital dependence. "
