We are seeking highly motivated students, postdocs and scientists with a strong interest and, for more senior positions, adequate experience in precision interferometry, inertial sensing, analog and digital electronic and/or space technology. Our Department for Precision Interferometry and Fundamental Interactions has been established in August 2022 with the appointment of Prof. Dr. Guido Müller. We are now ramping up our personnel at all levels to work on several challenging research projects associated with LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory aimed at detecting gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range. The planned projects will be part of the following two overarching projects:\n\nThe LISA hardware-in-the-loop testbed:\n\nThis testbed will generate as realistic LISA-like signals as possible to test the entire data analysis pipeline from photons to source parameters.

The position will be at the level of a staff scientist; the appointment will initially be for 3 years, with the possibility of becoming permanent afterwards. In exceptional cases, the position can be made permanent sooner, or from the beginning. The \"Astrophysical and Cosmological Relativity\" (ACR) division, led by Alessandra Buonanno, is composed of about 40 scientists, including three permanent group leaders, Jonathan Gair, Harald Pfeiffer, Jan Steinhoff, and the five-year research group leader Miguel Zumalacarregui. The division also hosts several long and short-term visitors, and it has ties with the Physics Department at the University of Maryland, the Humboldt University in Berlin, and the University of Potsdam. Several members of the division are part of international collaborations including the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the LISA Consortium and the Einstein Telescope Collaboration. With recent ground-breaking observations of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, gravitational-wave astrophysics is an exciting, fast-growing field. One of the main research activities in the ACR division is the development of theoretical models of gravitational waves from astrophysical and cosmological sources. Such models are necessary to detect gravitational waves and extract the physical information about the extreme sources that generate them, such as black holes and neutron stars. They are also needed to test the nature of gravity itself. These models are also employed to make predictions about future more sensitive detectors, such as LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. The ACR division plays a leading role in this pursuit, by creating and helping maintain production analyses codes (such as the LIGO Algorithm Library), and by maintaining and developing a waveform modeling toolkit called pyEOBNR (which is an effective-one-body (EOB) numerical-relativity (NR) calibrated waveform model for binary systems in the Python language). It is expected that the pyEOBNR toolkit will include ever more physical effects and be made computationally efficient for future detectors. Furthermore, evaluating waveform models can be computationally expensive and therefore the ACR division is also leading activities to accelerate gravitational-wave inference. This activity includes the maintenance and development of the machine-learning algorithm Deep INference for Gravitational-wave Observations (DINGO). DINGO uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as normalizing flows, to directly infer the parameters, with uncertainties of events, observed by current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. This inference can be done in seconds, enabling the use of the most accurate waveform models for a much wider range of scientific applications than ever before. It is anticipated that DINGO will be used for an increasing range of ACR projects over the coming years, and be extended to a wider range of source types and adapted to future detectors. It is expected that the successful candidate for this position will support the computational work of ACR scientists. The successful candidate will also participate in software development and its application to the analysis of current and future observational data. Modelling and inference work within the ACR department makes use of a high-performance computer cluster, Urania, with ~6,000 cores, a high-throughput compute cluster, Hypatia with ~12,000 cores and two GPU servers, Saraswati and Lakshmi, each with 8 A100 GPUs. Those clusters are used to run numerical-relativity simulations of gravitational-wave sources, and to carry out source modeling and data-analysis studies for current and future gravitational-wave detectors. The clusters are maintained by a full-time cluster administrator. Key tasks/responsibilities:\n\nSupport the development and maintenance of software packages used to generate waveform models (such as pyEOBNR), and used for statistical inference on the properties of observed gravitational-wave sources (such as DINGO).\n\nWork to ensure that the computational performance of the software meets the needs of the ACR’s scientists.\n\nEnsure that software developed in the division is well documented to facilitate the easy use of the code by new members and external collaborators.\n\nConsult and train scientists in the use of software, as needed.\n\nSupport research and publications conducted by scientists in the division.\n\nEngage in visualization of results.\n\nRequired education and experience:\n\nPh.D. in computer science, astronomy, physics or a related discipline.\n\nAt least 4 years of experience with high-performance computing (HPC) or high-throughput computing (HTC) resources.\n\nExpert knowledge in computational languages used in the astrophysics and physics community (e.g., Python, C/C++, Mathematica).\n\nExperience using multiple computational platforms (e.g., OSX, Windows, Unix/Linux).\n\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills.\n\nExcellent knowledge of oral and written English.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nBackground in gravitational-wave physics or astrophysics.\n\nFamiliarity with gravitational-wave software.\n\nFamiliarity with modern software development practices, such as version control (Git) and continuous integration (CI).\n\nKnowledge of machine-learning methods.\n\nExperience in numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nTo apply, please submit your application via our job portal at https://jobs.aei.mpg.de/login. You will be asked to upload a cover letter, curriculum vitae, list of publications and a statement of past and future research activities related to this job of not more than 3 pages.

The application deadline is December 15th or until positions are filled.\n\nProject description:\n\nGeneral relativity posits that gravitational waves, like light, can be gravitationally lensed. Recent studies suggest that we could detect gravitational-wave lensing as early as in the coming few years as the current ground-based detectors are upgraded. However, the methods to detect and employ gravitational-wave lensing are entirely different from light lensing. Indeed, we detect waves instead of particles, and the source population is one of merging black holes. For these reasons, the field would pave the way to interesting new applications in a wide range of scientific domains, one of which is combined lensing observations using multiple messenger signals – electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals [1]. However, to realize these applications in practice, several challenges relating to methodology and science-case development need to be overcome.\n\nThe postdoctoral researcher would work on combining gravitational-wave lensing with follow-up electromagnetic lens reconstructions at the border between two fields. The work would be done in collaboration with institutes from the Netherlands and Belgium. Beyond the research work, the position would also involve graduate student supervision.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13811\n\nAbout the group:\n\nThe CUHK GW group researches gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time.
