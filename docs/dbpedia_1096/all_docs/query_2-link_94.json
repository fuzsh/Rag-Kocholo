        "text": "Newton's laws of motion in the form of a Riccati equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNowakowski, Marek; Rosu, Haret C\n\n2002-04-01\n\nWe discuss two applications of a Riccati equation to Newton's laws of motion. The first one is the motion of a particle under the influence of a power law central potential V(r)=kr(epsilon). For zero total energy we show that the equation of motion can be cast in the Riccati form. We briefly show here an analogy to barotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Lemaitre cosmology where the expansion of the universe can be also shown to obey a Riccati equation. A second application in classical mechanics, where again the Riccati equation appears naturally, are problems involving quadratic friction. We use methods reminiscent to nonrelativistic supersymmetry to generalize and solve such problems.\n\nNewton-Euler Dynamic Equations of Motion for a Multi-body Spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStoneking, Eric\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission employs a formation of spinning spacecraft with several flexible appendages and thruster-based control. To understand the complex dynamic interaction of thruster actuation, appendage motion, and spin dynamics, each spacecraft is modeled as a tree of rigid bodies connected by spherical or gimballed joints. The method presented facilitates assembling by inspection the exact, nonlinear dynamic equations of motion for a multibody spacecraft suitable for solution by numerical integration. The building block equations are derived by applying Newton's and Euler's equations of motion to an \"element\" consisting of two bodies and one joint (spherical and gimballed joints are considered separately). Patterns in the \"mass\" and L'force\" matrices guide assembly by inspection of a general N-body tree-topology system. Straightforward linear algebra operations are employed to eliminate extraneous constraint equations, resulting in a minimum-dimension system of equations to solve. This method thus combines a straightforward, easily-extendable, easily-mechanized formulation with an efficient computer implementation.\n\nEquations of motion for train derailment dynamics\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2007-09-11\n\nThis paper describes a planar or two-dimensional model to : examine the gross motions of rail cars in a generalized train : derailment. Three coupled, second-order differential equations : are derived from Newton's Laws to calculate rigid-body car : ...\n\nNewton's method for nonlinear stochastic wave equations driven by one-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeszczynski, Henryk; Wrzosek, Monika\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe consider nonlinear stochastic wave equations driven by one-dimensional white noise with respect to time. The existence of solutions is proved by means of Picard iterations. Next we apply Newton's method. Moreover, a second-order convergence in a probabilistic sense is demonstrated.\n\nRelating constrained motion to force through Newton's second law\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoithmayr, Carlos M.\n\nWhen a mechanical system is subject to constraints its motion is in some way restricted. In accordance with Newton's second law, motion is a direct result of forces acting on a system; hence, constraint is inextricably linked to force. The presence of a constraint implies the application of particular forces needed to compel motion in accordance with the constraint; absence of a constraint implies the absence of such forces. The objective of this thesis is to formulate a comprehensive, consistent, and concise method for identifying a set of forces needed to constrain the behavior of a mechanical system modeled as a set of particles and rigid bodies. The goal is accomplished in large part by expressing constraint equations in vector form rather than entirely in terms of scalars. The method developed here can be applied whenever constraints can be described at the acceleration level by a set of independent equations that are linear in acceleration. Hence, the range of applicability extends to servo-constraints or program constraints described at the velocity level with relationships that are nonlinear in velocity. All configuration constraints, and an important class of classical motion constraints, can be expressed at the velocity level by using equations that are linear in velocity; therefore, the associated constraint equations are linear in acceleration when written at the acceleration level. Two new approaches are presented for deriving equations governing motion of a system subject to constraints expressed at the velocity level with equations that are nonlinear in velocity. By using partial accelerations instead of the partial velocities normally employed with Kane's method, it is possible to form dynamical equations that either do or do not contain evidence of the constraint forces, depending on the analyst's interests.\n\nTeaching Newton's Third Law of Motion in the Presence of Student Preconception\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPoon, C. H.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe concept of interaction that underlies Newton's Laws of Motion is compared with the students' commonsense ideas of force and motion. An approach to teaching Newton's Third Law of Motion is suggested that focuses on refining the student's intuitive thinking on the nature of interaction.\n\nSpace and motion in nature and Scripture: Galileo, Descartes, Newton.\n\nPubMed\n\nJaniak, Andrew\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn the Scholium to the Definitions in Principia mathematica, Newton departs from his main task of discussing space, time and motion by suddenly mentioning the proper method for interpreting Scripture. This is surprising, and it has long been ignored by scholars. In this paper, I argue that the Scripture passage in the Scholium is actually far from incidental: it reflects Newton's substantive concern, one evident in correspondence and manuscripts from the 1680s, that any general understanding of space, time and motion must enable readers to recognize the veracity of Biblical claims about natural phenomena, including the motion of the earth. This substantive concern sheds new light on an aspect of Newton's project in the Scholium. It also underscores Newton's originality in dealing with the famous problem of reconciling theological and philosophical conceptions of nature in the seventeenth century.

Various cases have been run successfully, demonstrating significant improvement over Picard iteration, including a 3D stellarator equilibrium at Î² = 2%. The algorithm first solves the equilibrium force balance equation for the current density J, given a guess for the magnetic field B. This step is taken from the Picard-iterative PIES 3D equilibrium code. Next, we apply Newton's method to Ampere's Law by expansion of the functional J(B), which is defined by the first step. An analytic calculation in magnetic coordinates, of how the Pfirsch-SchlÃ¼ter currents vary in the plasma in response to a small change in the magnetic field, yields the Newton gradient term (analogous to âf . Î´x in Newton's method for f(x) = 0). The algorithm is computationally feasible because we do this analytically, and because the gradient term is flux surface local when expressed in terms of a vector potential in an Ar=0 gauge. The equations are discretized by a hybrid spectral/offset grid finite difference technique, and leading order radial dependence is factored from Fourier coefficients to improve finite- difference accuracy near the polar-like origin. After calculating the Newton gradient term we transfer the equation from the magnetic grid to a fixed background grid, which greatly improves the code's performance.\n\nThe importance of being equivalent: Newton's two models of one-body motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPourciau, Bruce\n\n2004-05-01\n\nAs an undergraduate at Cambridge, Newton entered into his \"Waste Book\" an assumption that we have named the Equivalence Assumption (The Younger): \"If a body move progressively in some crooked line [about a center of motion] ..., [then this] crooked line may bee conceived to consist of an infinite number of streight lines. Or else in any point of the croked line the motion may bee conceived to be on in the tangent\". In this assumption, Newton somewhat imprecisely describes two mathematical models, a \"polygonal limit model\" and a \"tangent deflected model\", for \"one-body motion\", that is, for the motion of a \"body in orbit about a fixed center\", and then claims that these two models are equivalent. In the first part of this paper, we study the Principia to determine how the elder Newton would more carefully describe the polygonal limit and tangent deflected models. From these more careful descriptions, we then create Equivalence Assumption (The Elder), a precise interpretation of Equivalence Assumption (The Younger) as it might have been restated by Newton, after say 1687. We then review certain portions of the Waste Book and the Principia to make the case that, although Newton never restates nor even alludes to the Equivalence Assumption after his youthful Waste Book entry, still the polygonal limit and tangent deflected models, as well as an unspoken belief in their equivalence, infuse Newton's work on orbital motion. In particular, we show that the persuasiveness of the argument for the Area Property in Proposition 1 of the Principia depends crucially on the validity of Equivalence Assumption (The Elder). After this case is made, we present the mathematical analysis required to establish the validity of the Equivalence Assumption (The Elder). Finally, to illustrate the fundamental nature of the resulting theorem, the Equivalence Theorem as we call it, we present three significant applications: we use the Equivalence Theorem first to clarify and resolve questions\n\nInfinity and Newton's Three Laws of Motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Chunghyoung\n\n2011-12-01\n\nIt is shown that the following three common understandings of Newton's laws of motion do not hold for systems of infinitely many components. First, Newton's third law, or the law of action and reaction, is universally believed to imply that the total sum of internal forces in a system is always zero. Several examples are presented to show that this belief fails to hold for infinite systems. Second, two of these examples are of an infinitely divisible continuous body with finite mass and volume such that the sum of all the internal forces in the body is not zero and the body accelerates due to this non-null net internal force. So the two examples also demonstrate the breakdown of the common understanding that according to Newton's laws a body under no external force does not accelerate. Finally, these examples also make it clear that the expression `impressed force' in Newton's formulations of his first and second laws should be understood not as `external force' but as `exerted force' which is the sum of all the internal and external forces acting on a given body, if the body is infinitely divisible.\n\nStochastic modification of the SchrÃ¶dinger-Newton equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBera, Sayantani; Mohan, Ravi; Singh, Tejinder P.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe SchrÃ¶dinger-Newton (SN) equation describes the effect of self-gravity on the evolution of a quantum system, and it has been proposed that gravitationally induced decoherence drives the system to one of the stationary solutions of the SN equation. However, the equation itself lacks a decoherence mechanism, because it does not possess any stochastic feature. In the present work we derive a stochastic modification of the SchrÃ¶dinger-Newton equation, starting from the Einstein-Langevin equation in the theory of stochastic semiclassical gravity. We specialize this equation to the case of a single massive point particle, and by using Karolyhazy's phase variance method, we derive the DiÃ³si-Penrose criterion for the decoherence time. We obtain a (nonlinear) master equation corresponding to this stochastic SN equation. This equation is, however, linear at the level of the approximation we use to prove decoherence; hence, the no-signaling requirement is met. Lastly, we use physical arguments to obtain expressions for the decoherence length of extended objects.\n\nAn actuator extension transformation for a motion simulator and an inverse transformation applying Newton-Raphson's method\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDieudonne, J. E.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nA set of equations which transform position and angular orientation of the centroid of the payload platform of a six-degree-of-freedom motion simulator into extensions of the simulator's actuators has been derived and is based on a geometrical representation of the system. An iterative scheme, Newton-Raphson's method, has been successfully used in a real time environment in the calculation of the position and angular orientation of the centroid of the payload platform when the magnitude of the actuator extensions is known. Sufficient accuracy is obtained by using only one Newton-Raphson iteration per integration step of the real time environment.\n\nRecursive linearization of multibody dynamics equations of motion\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLin, Tsung-Chieh; Yae, K. Harold\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe equations of motion of a multibody system are nonlinear in nature, and thus pose a difficult problem in linear control design. One approach is to have a first-order approximation through the numerical perturbations at a given configuration, and to design a control law based on the linearized model. Here, a linearized model is generated analytically by following the footsteps of the recursive derivation of the equations of motion. The equations of motion are first written in a Newton-Euler form, which is systematic and easy to construct; then, they are transformed into a relative coordinate representation, which is more efficient in computation. A new computational method for linearization is obtained by applying a series of first-order analytical approximations to the recursive kinematic relationships. The method has proved to be computationally more efficient because of its recursive nature. It has also turned out to be more accurate because of the fact that analytical perturbation circumvents numerical differentiation and other associated numerical operations that may accumulate computational error, thus requiring only analytical operations of matrices and vectors. The power of the proposed linearization algorithm is demonstrated, in comparison to a numerical perturbation method, with a two-link manipulator and a seven degrees of freedom robotic manipulator. Its application to control design is also demonstrated.\n\nSolution of Tikhonov's Motion-Separation Problem Using the Modified Newton-Kantorovich Theorem\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBelolipetskii, A. A.; Ter-Krikorov, A. M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe paper presents a new way to prove the existence of a solution of the well-known Tikhonov's problem on systems of ordinary differential equations in which one part of the variables performs \"fast\" motions and the other part, \"slow\" motions. Tikhonov's problem has been the subject of a large number of works in connection with its applications to a wide range of mathematical models in natural science and economics. Only a short list of publications, which present the proof of the existence of solutions in this problem, is cited. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the possibility of applying the modified Newton-Kantorovich theorem to prove the existence of a solution in Tikhonov's problem. The technique proposed can be used to prove the existence of solutions of other classes of problems with a small parameter.\n\nRoller Coasters without Differential Equations--A Newtonian Approach to Constrained Motion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMuller, Rainer\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWithin the context of Newton's equation, we present a simple approach to the constrained motion of a body forced to move along a specified trajectory.

Fishaleck and R.B. White\n\n2008-02-19\n\nThe method of Kruskal-Newton diagrams for the solution of differential equations with boundary layers is shown to provide rapid intuitive understanding of layer scaling and can result in the conceptual simplification of some problems. The method is illustrated using equations arising in the theory of pattern formation and in plasma physics.\n\nThe architecture of Newton, a general-purpose dynamics simulator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCremer, James F.; Stewart, A. James\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe architecture for Newton, a general-purpose system for simulating the dynamics of complex physical objects, is described. The system automatically formulates and analyzes equations of motion, and performs automatic modification of this system equations when necessitated by changes in kinematic relationships between objects. Impact and temporary contact are handled, although only using simple models. User-directed influence of simulations is achieved using Newton's module, which can be used to experiment with the control of many-degree-of-freedom articulated objects.\n\nEquations of motion of slung-load systems, including multilift systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCicolani, Luigi S.; Kanning, Gerd\n\n1992-01-01\n\nGeneral simulation equations are derived for the rigid body motion of slung-load systems. This work is motivated by an interest in trajectory control for slung loads carried by two or more helicopters. An approximation of these systems consists of several rigid bodies connected by straight-line cables or links. The suspension can be assumed elastic or inelastic. Equations for the general system are obtained from the Newton-Euler rigid-body equations with the introduction of generalized velocity coordinates. Three forms are obtained: two generalize previous case-specific results for single-helicopter systems with elastic and inelastic suspensions, respectively; and the third is a new formulation for inelastic suspensions. The latter is derived from the elastic suspension equations by choosing the generalized coordinates so that motion induced by cable stretching is separated from motion with invariant cable lengths, and by then nulling the stretching coordinates to get a relation for the suspension forces. The result is computationally more efficient than the conventional formulation, is readily integrated with the elastic suspension formulation, and is easily applied to the complex dual-lift and multilift systems. Results are given for two-helicopter systems; three configurations are included and these can be integrated in a single simulation. Equations are also given for some single-helicopter systems, for comparison with the previous literature, and for a multilift system. Equations for degenerate-body approximations (point masses, rigid rods) are also formulated and results are given for dual-lift and multilift systems. Finally, linearlized equations of motion are given for general slung-load systems are presented along with results for the two-helicopter system with a spreader bar.\n\nOn a class of Newton-like methods for solving nonlinear equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArgyros, Ioannis K.\n\n2009-06-01\n\nWe provide a semilocal convergence analysis for a certain class of Newton-like methods considered also in [I.K. Argyros, A unifying local-semilocal convergence analysis and applications for two-point Newton-like methods in Banach space, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 298 (2004) 374-397; I.K.

Dennis, Toward a unified convergence theory for Newton-like methods, in: L.B. Rall (Ed.), Nonlinear Functional Analysis and Applications, Academic Press, New York, 1971], in order to approximate a locally unique solution of an equation in a Banach space. Using a combination of Lipschitz and center-Lipschitz conditions, instead of only Lipschitz conditions [F.A. Potra, Sharp error bounds for a class of Newton-like methods, Libertas Math. 5 (1985) 71-84], we provide an analysis with the following advantages over the work in [F.A. Potra, Sharp error bounds for a class of Newton-like methods, Libertas Math. 5 (1985) 71-84] which improved the works in [W.E. Bosarge, P.L. Falb, A multipoint method of third order, J. Optimiz.

We argue that, in Einstein gravity, the extremality condition can be understood from the variational principle at the level of the action, without having to solve explicitly the equations of motion. This set-up is then generalized to arbitrary theories of gravity, where we show that the respective entanglement entropy functional needs to be extremized. We also extend this result to all orders in Newton's constant G N , providing a derivation of quantum extremality. Understanding quantum extremality for mixtures of states provides a generalization of the dual of the boundary modular Hamiltonian which is given by the bulk modular Hamiltonian plus the area operator, evaluated on the so-called modular extremal surface. This gives a bulk prescription for computing the relative entropies to all orders in G N . We also comment on how these ideas can be used to derive an integrated version of the equations of motion, linearized around arbitrary states.\n\nQuasi-Newton methods for parameter estimation in functional differential equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrewer, Dennis W.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA state-space approach to parameter estimation in linear functional differential equations is developed using the theory of linear evolution equations. A locally convergent quasi-Newton type algorithm is applied to distributed systems with particular emphasis on parameters that induce unbounded perturbations of the state. The algorithm is computationally implemented on several functional differential equations, including coefficient and delay estimation in linear delay-differential equations.\n\nRadiation reaction on a classical charged particle: a modified form of the equation of motion.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlcaine, Guillermo GarcÃ­a; Llanes-Estrada, Felipe J\n\n2013-09-01\n\nWe present and numerically solve a modified form of the equation of motion for a charged particle under the influence of an external force, taking into account the radiation reaction. This covariant equation is integro-differential, as Dirac-RÃ¶hrlich's, but has several technical improvements. First, the equation has the form of Newton's second law, with acceleration isolated on the left hand side and the force depending only on positions and velocities: Thus, the equation is linear in the highest derivative. Second, the total four-force is by construction perpendicular to the four-velocity. Third, if the external force vanishes for all future times, the total force and the acceleration automatically vanish at the present time. We show the advantages of this equation by solving it numerically for several examples of external force.\n\nRadiation reaction on a classical charged particle: A modified form of the equation of motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlcaine, Guillermo GarcÃ­a; Llanes-Estrada, Felipe J.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nWe present and numerically solve a modified form of the equation of motion for a charged particle under the influence of an external force, taking into account the radiation reaction.

We establish a new rational approximation model with linear numerator and denominator which has generalizes the local linear model. We then employ the new approximation for nonlinear equations and propose an improved Newton's method to solve it. The new method revises the Jacobian matrix by a rank one matrix each iteration and obtains the quadratic convergence property. The numerical performance and comparison show that the proposed method is efficient.\n\nThe Equations of Oceanic Motions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMÃ¼ller, Peter\n\n2006-10-01\n\nModeling and prediction of oceanographic phenomena and climate is based on the integration of dynamic equations. The Equations of Oceanic Motions derives and systematically classifies the most common dynamic equations used in physical oceanography, from large scale thermohaline circulations to those governing small scale motions and turbulence. After establishing the basic dynamical equations that describe all oceanic motions, M|ller then derives approximate equations, emphasizing the assumptions made and physical processes eliminated. He distinguishes between geometric, thermodynamic and dynamic approximations and between the acoustic, gravity, vortical and temperature-salinity modes of motion. Basic concepts and formulae of equilibrium thermodynamics, vector and tensor calculus, curvilinear coordinate systems, and the kinematics of fluid motion and wave propagation are covered in appendices. Providing the basic theoretical background for graduate students and researchers of physical oceanography and climate science, this book will serve as both a comprehensive text and an essential reference.\n\nTeaching Newton's 3rd law of motion using learning by design approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAquino, Jiezel G.; Caliguid, Mariel P.; Buan, Amelia T.; Magsayod, Joy R.; Lahoylahoy, Myrna E.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the process and implementation of Learning by Design Approach in teaching Newton's 3rd Law of Motion. A lesson activity from integrative STEM education was adapted, modified and enhanced through pilot testing. After revisions, the implementation was done to one class. The respondent's prior knowledge was first assessed by a pretest. PPIT (present the scenario, plan, implement and test) was the framework followed in the implementation of Learning by Design. Worksheets were then utilized to measure their conceptual understanding and perception. A score guide was also used to evaluate the student's output. Paired t-test analysis showed that there is a significant difference in the pretest and posttest achievement scores. This implies that the performance of the students have improved during the implementation of the Learning by Design. The Analysis of variance also depicts that the low, average and high benefited in the Learning by Design approach. The results of this study suggests that Learning by Design is an effective approach in teaching Newton's 3rd Law of Motion and thus be used in a Science classroom.\n\nNewton's method applied to finite-difference approximations for the steady-state compressible Navier-Stokes equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBailey, Harry E.; Beam, Richard M.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nFinite-difference approximations for steady-state compressible Navier-Stokes equations, whose two spatial dimensions are written in generalized curvilinear coordinates and strong conservation-law form, are presently solved by means of Newton's method in order to obtain a lifting-airfoil flow field under subsonic and transonnic conditions. In addition to ascertaining the computational requirements of an initial guess ensuring convergence and the degree of computational efficiency obtainable via the approximate Newton method's freezing of the Jacobian matrices, attention is given to the need for auxiliary methods assessing the temporal stability of steady-state solutions. It is demonstrated that nonunique solutions of the finite-difference equations are obtainable by Newton's method in conjunction with a continuation method.\n\nApplication of Four-Point Newton-EGSOR iteration for the numerical solution of 2D Porous Medium Equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChew, J. V. L.; Sulaiman, J.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nPartial differential equations that are used in describing the nonlinear heat and mass transfer phenomena are difficult to be solved. For the case where the exact solution is difficult to be obtained, it is necessary to use a numerical procedure such as the finite difference method to solve a particular partial differential equation. In term of numerical procedure, a particular method can be considered as an efficient method if the method can give an approximate solution within the specified error with the least computational complexity. Throughout this paper, the two-dimensional Porous Medium Equation (2D PME) is discretized by using the implicit finite difference scheme to construct the corresponding approximation equation. Then this approximation equation yields a large-sized and sparse nonlinear system. By using the Newton method to linearize the nonlinear system, this paper deals with the application of the Four-Point Newton-EGSOR (4NEGSOR) iterative method for solving the 2D PMEs. In addition to that, the efficiency of the 4NEGSOR iterative method is studied by solving three examples of the problems. Based on the comparative analysis, the Newton-Gauss-Seidel (NGS) and the Newton-SOR (NSOR) iterative methods are also considered. The numerical findings show that the 4NEGSOR method is superior to the NGS and the NSOR methods in terms of the number of iterations to get the converged solutions, the time of computation and the maximum absolute errors produced by the methods.\n\nParallel Newton-Krylov-Schwarz algorithms for the transonic full potential equation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCai, Xiao-Chuan; Gropp, William D.; Keyes, David E.; Melvin, Robin G.; Young, David P.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nWe study parallel two-level overlapping Schwarz algorithms for solving nonlinear finite element problems, in particular, for the full potential equation of aerodynamics discretized in two dimensions with bilinear elements. The overall algorithm, Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS), employs an inexact finite-difference Newton method and a Krylov space iterative method, with a two-level overlapping Schwarz method as a preconditioner. We demonstrate that NKS, combined with a density upwinding continuation strategy for problems with weak shocks, is robust and, economical for this class of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equations, with proper specification of several parameters. We study upwinding parameters, inner convergence tolerance, coarse grid density, subdomain overlap, and the level of fill-in in the incomplete factorization, and report their effect on numerical convergence rate, overall execution time, and parallel efficiency on a distributed-memory parallel computer.\n\nImproved Quasi-Newton method via PSB update for solving systems of nonlinear equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMamat, Mustafa; Dauda, M. K.; Waziri, M. Y.; Ahmad, Fadhilah; Mohamad, Fatma Susilawati\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe Newton method has some shortcomings which includes computation of the Jacobian matrix which may be difficult or even impossible to compute and solving the Newton system in every iteration. Also, the common setback with some quasi-Newton methods is that they need to compute and store an n Ã n matrix at each iteration, this is computationally costly for large scale problems. To overcome such drawbacks, an improved Method for solving systems of nonlinear equations via PSB (Powell-Symmetric-Broyden) update is proposed. In the proposed method, the approximate Jacobian inverse Hk of PSB is updated and its efficiency has improved thereby require low memory storage, hence the main aim of this paper. The preliminary numerical results show that the proposed method is practically efficient when applied on some benchmark problems.\n\nStudent Teachers' Levels of Understanding and Model of Understanding about Newton's Laws of Motion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSaglam-Arslan, Aysegul; Devecioglu, Yasemin\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis study was conducted to determine the level of student teachers' understandings of Newton's laws of motion and relating these levels to identify student teachers' models of understanding.

The method is to derive the kinetic equation for Brownian motion from the Boltzmann equation for a two-component neutral gas by a simultaneous expansion in the density and mass ratios.\n\nAn analysis of the convergence of Newton iterations for solving elliptic Kepler's equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nElipe, A.; Montijano, J. I.; RÃ¡ndez, L.; Calvo, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this note a study of the convergence properties of some starters E_0 = E_0(e,M) in the eccentricity-mean anomaly variables for solving the elliptic Kepler's equation (KE) by Newton's method is presented. By using a Wang Xinghua's theorem (Xinghua in Math Comput 68(225):169-186, 1999) on best possible error bounds in the solution of nonlinear equations by Newton's method, we obtain for each starter E_0(e,M) a set of values (e,M) \\\\in [0, 1) Ã [0, Ï ] that lead to the q-convergence in the sense that Newton's sequence (E_n)_{n â¥ 0} generated from E_0 = E_0(e,M) is well defined, converges to the exact solution E^* = E^*(e,M) of KE and further \\\\vert E_n - E^* \\\\vert â¤ q^{2^n -1} \\\\vert E_0 - E^* \\\\vert holds for all n â¥ 0. This study completes in some sense the results derived by AvendaÃ±o et al. (Celest Mech Dyn Astron 119:27-44, 2014) by using Smale's Î± -test with q=1/2. Also since in KE the convergence rate of Newton's method tends to zero as e â 0, we show that the error estimates given in the Wang Xinghua's theorem for KE can also be used to determine sets of q-convergence with q = e^k \\\\widetilde{q} for all e \\\\in [0,1) and a fixed \\\\widetilde{q} â¤ 1. Some remarks on the use of this theorem to derive a priori estimates of the error \\\\vert E_n - E^* \\\\vert after n Kepler's iterations are given. Finally, a posteriori bounds of this error that can be used to a dynamical estimation of the error are also obtained.\n\nMeanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the \"compounding of the celestiall motions of the planets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGal, Ofer\n\nThis book is a historical-epistemological study of one the most consequential idea of early modern celestial mechanics: Robert Hooke's proposal to \"compoun[d] the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent & an attractive motion towards a central body,\" a proposal which Isaac Newton adopted and realized in his Principia. Hooke's Programme was revolutionary both cosmologically and mathematically. It presented \"the celestial motions,\" the proverbial symbol of stability and immutability, as a process of continuous change, and prescribed only parameters of rectilinear motions and rectilinear attractions for calculating their closed curved orbits. Yet the traces of Hooke's construction of his Programme for the heavens lead through his investigations in such earthly disciplines as microscopy, practical optics and horology, and the mathematical tools developed by Newton to accomplish it appear no less local and goal-oriented than Hooke's lenses and springs. This transgression of the boundaries between the theoretical, experimental and technological realms is reminiscent of Hooke's own free excursions in and out of the circles occupied by gentlemen-philosophers, university mathematicians, instrument makers, technicians and servants. It presents an opportunity to examine the social and epistemological distinctions, relations and hierarchies between those realms and their inhabitants, and compels a critical assessment of the philosophical categories they embody.\n\nTornadogenesis Versus Newton's Third Law of Motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHardwig, R. B.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFor over 90 years scientists have tried to explain how tornadoes form and function. The present general consensus is that a tornado is just a function of the thunderstorm. Much research has been done to find the answer and numerous articles and papers have been written, all to no avail. This research explores the fact that a tornado cannot be just a function of a thunderstorm, as there is no opposite force within the thunderstorm to the air drawn up by the tornado, so there must be some external force involved in a tornado's formation. To have compliance with Newton's Third Law of Motion we must see an equal downforce or some other force within the thunderstorm, to that drawn up by the tornado. And if there was a downforce, that force would be virtually as damaging as the tornado itself. But we don't see this downforce or any other opposing force within the thunderstorm. Therefore, we must look for some other force that could cause a tornado's formation. And if that opposing force is not within the thunderstorm we need to be looking for some external force, outside the thunderstorm, that could cause a tornado. Also the fact that we have Waterspouts, Landspouts and Gustnadoes all without a thunderstorm, but since they all look and function just like a tornado, tells us that there must be some other force that is responsible for causing a tornado just like a Waterspout, Landspout or Gustnado. My research shows that there is one other force of energy that could cause all of these vortexes and is most likely the source of energy for a tornado's formation. That force is the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream. My research shows a direct relationship between the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream and Tornadogenesis as well as Waterspouts, Landspouts and Gustnadoes. Therefore, with the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream providing the Action, at its interface with the tornado in the stratosphere, the Reaction is what we see on the ground as a tornado. With this explanation we\n\nCoupled rotor and fuselage equations of motion\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWarmbrodt, W.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe governing equations of motion of a helicopter rotor coupled to a rigid body fuselage are derived.

(YP)\n\nTexas Science Teacher Characteristics and Conceptual Understanding of Newton's Laws of Motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBusby, Karin Burk\n\nMisconceptions of Newtonian mechanics and other physical science concepts are well documented in primary and pre-service teacher populations (Burgoon, Heddle, & Duran, 2009; Allen & Coole, 2012; Kruger, Summers, & Palacio, 1990; Ginns & Watters, 1995; Trumper, 1999; Asikainen & Hirovonen, 2014). These misconceptions match the misconceptions held by students, leaving teachers ill-equipped to rectify these concepts in the classroom (Kind, 2014; Kruger et al., 1990; Cochran & Jones, 1998). Little research has been devoted to misconceptions held by in-service secondary teachers, the population responsible for teaching Newtonian mechanics. This study focuses on Texas in-service science teachers in middle school and high school science, specifically sixth grade science, seventh grade science, eighth grade science, integrated physics and chemistry, and physics teachers. This study utilizes two instruments to gauge conceptual understanding of Newton's laws of motion: the Force Concept Inventory [FCI] (Hestenes, Wells, & Swackhamer, 1992) and a custom instrument developed for the Texas Regional Collaboratives for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching (Urquhart, M., e-mail, April 4, 2017). Use of each instrument had its strengths and limitations. In the initial work of this study, the FCI was given to middle and high school teacher volunteers in two urban school districts in the Dallas- Fort Worth area to assess current conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics. Along with the FCI, each participant was asked to complete a demographic survey. Demographic data collected included participant's sex, years of service in teaching position, current teaching position, degrees, certification type, and current certifications for science education. Correlations between variables and overall average on the FCI were determined by t-tests and ANOVA tests with a post-hoc Holm-Bonferroni correction test. Test questions pertaining to each of Newton's three laws of motion were\n\nDevelopment and Application of a Rubric for Evaluating Students' Performance on Newton's Laws of Motion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKocakulah, Mustafa Sabri\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis study aims to develop and apply a rubric to evaluate the solutions of pre-service primary science teachers to questions about Newton's Laws of Motion.

In the early 2000s two distinct differential equations of motion were proposed. Besides their contrasting formulations for the acceleration of condensate, the equations differ concerning the presence/absence of a term equal to the rate of phase transitions multiplied by the difference in velocity between condensate and air. This term was interpreted in the literature as the \"reactive motion\" associated with condensation. The reasoning behind this reactive motion was that when water vapor condenses and droplets begin to fall the remaining gas must move upward to conserve momentum. Here we show that the two contrasting formulations imply distinct assumptions about how gaseous air and condensate particles interact. We show that these assumptions cannot be simultaneously applicable to condensation and evaporation. Reactive motion leading to an upward acceleration of air during condensation does not exist. The reactive motion term can be justified for evaporation only; it describes the downward acceleration of air. We emphasize the difference between the equations of motion (i.e., equations constraining velocity) and those constraining momentum (i.e., equations of motion and continuity combined). We show that owing to the imprecise nature of the continuity equations, consideration of total momentum can be misleading and that this led to the reactive motion controversy. Finally, we provide a revised and generally applicable equation for the motion of moist air.\n\nGeneral Relativity Exactly Described by Use of Newton's Laws within a Curved Geometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSavickas, David\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe connection between general relativity and Newtonian mechanics is shown to be much closer than generally recognized. When Newton's second law is written in a curved geometry by using the physical components of a vector as defined in tensor calculus, and by replacing distance within the momentum's velocity by the vector metric ds in a curved geometry, the second law can then be easily shown to be exactly identical to the geodesic equation of motion occurring in general relativity. By using a time whose vector direction is constant, as similarly occurs in Newtonian mechanics, this equation can be separated into two equations one of which is a curved three-dimensional equation of motion and the other is an equation for energy. For the gravitational field of an isolated particle, they yield the Schwarzschild equations. They can be used to describe gravitation for any array of masses for which the Newtonian gravitational potential is known, and is applied here to describe motion in the gravitational field of a thin mass-rod.\n\nFormulas for precession. [motion of mean equator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKinoshita, H.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nLiteral expressions for the precessional motion of the mean equator referred to an arbitrary epoch are constructed. Their numerical representations, based on numerical values recommended at the working meeting of the International Astronomical Union Commission held in Washington in September 1974, are obtained. In constructing the equations of motion, the second-order secular perturbation and the secular perturbation due to the long-periodic terms in the motions of the moon and the sun are taken into account. These perturbations contribute more to the motion of the mean equator than does the term due to the secular perturbation of the orbital eccentricity of the sun.\n\nApplying the Science of Learning to the Learning of Science: Newton's Second Law of Motion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLemmer, Miriam\n\n2018-01-01\n\nScience teaching and learning require knowledge about how learning takes place (cognition) and how learners interact with their surroundings (affective and sociocultural factors).

Aâ¦\n\nGeneral relativity exactly described in terms of Newton's laws within curved geometries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSavickas, D.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nMany years ago Milne and McCrea showed in their well-known paper that the Hubble expansion occurring in general relativity could be exactly described by the use of Newtonian mechanics. It will be shown that a similar method can be extended to, and used within, curved geometries when Newton's second law is expressed within a four-dimensional curved spacetime. The second law will be shown to yield an equation that is exactly identical to the geodesic equation of motion of general relativity. This in itself yields no new information concerning relativity since the equation is mathematically identical to the relativistic equation. However, when the time in the second law is defined to have a constant direction as effectively occurs in Newtonian mechanics, and no longer acts as a fourth dimension as exists in relativity theory, it separates into a vector equation in a curved three-dimensional space and an additional second scalar equation that describes conservation of energy. It is shown that the curved Newtonian equations of motion define the metric coefficients which occur in the Schwarzschild solution and that they also define its equations of motion. Also, because the curved Newtonian equations developed here use masses as gravitational sources, as occurs in Newtonian mechanics, they make it possible to derive the solution for other kinds of mass distributions and are used here to find the metric equation for a thin mass-rod and the equation of motion for a mass particle orbiting it in its relativistic gravitational field.\n\nQuantum mechanics from Newton's second law and the canonical commutation relation [X, P] = i\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPalenik, Mark C.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nDespite the fact that it has been known since the time of Heisenberg that quantum operators obey a quantum version of Newton's laws, students are often told that derivations of quantum mechanics must necessarily follow from the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulations of mechanics. Here, we first derive the existing Heisenberg equations of motion from Newton's laws and the uncertainty principle using only the equations F=\\\\frac{dP}{dt}, P=m\\\\frac{dV}{dt}, and [X, P] = i. Then, a new expression for the propagator is derived that makes a connection between time evolution in quantum mechanics and the motion of a classical particle under Newton's laws. The propagator is solved for three cases where an exact solution is possible: (1) the free particle; (2) the harmonic oscillator; and (3) a constant force, or linear potential in the standard interpretation. We then show that for a general for a general force F(X), by Taylor expanding X(t) in time, we can use this methodology to reproduce the Feynman path integral formula for the propagator. Such a picture may be useful for students as they make the transition from classical to quantum mechanics and help solidify the equivalence of the Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, and Newtonian pictures of physics in their minds.\n\nSometimes \"Newton's Method\" Always \"Cycles\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLatulippe, Joe; Switkes, Jennifer\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAre there functions for which Newton's method cycles for all non-trivial initial guesses?

Newton's universal theory of gravity only used the observations of the motion of planets in our solar system. Hubble later used observations of fixed stars in the universe, and showed that the fixed stars were actually galaxies with very large numbers of stars. Newton's universal law of gravity could not explain these new observations without the mystery of dark matter for the additional gravity. In science, when a theory is not able to explain new observations it is necessary to modify the theory or abandon the theory. Rubin observed flat (constant velocity) rotation curves for stars in spiral galaxies. Dark matter was proposed to provide the missing gravity. The equation balancing gravitational force and centripetal force is M*G=v*v*r and for the observed constant velocity v this requires M*G to be a linear function of distance r. If the linear dependence is instead assigned to G instead of M to give a new value for Gn as G+A*r, this will explain the observations in the cosmos and also in our solar system for small r.

It explores the implications of financial constraints, consumer preferences and the development of new healthcare services on the reorganization of professional boundaries. It makes use of Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion to demonstrate how professional development in nursing has taken place in response to a number of external influences and demands. It also considers the significance of skill mix for the nursing profession, in particular the development and likely expansion of the physician assistant role. The application of different professionals and grades within a healthcare team or organization is central to the Government's Agenda for Change proposals and nurses have successfully adopted a number of roles traditionally performed by doctors. Nurses have demonstrated that they are capable of providing high quality care and contributing directly to positive patient outcome. Advanced nursing roles should not only reflect the changing nature of healthcare work, they should also be actively engaged in reconstructing healthcare boundaries.\n\nGround Motion Prediction Equations Empowered by Stress Drop Measurement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiyake, H.; Oth, A.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSignificant variation of stress drop is a crucial issue for ground motion prediction equations and probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, since only a few ground motion prediction equations take into account stress drop. In addition to average and sigma studies of stress drop and ground motion prediction equations (e.g., Cotton et al., 2013; Baltay and Hanks, 2014), we explore 1-to-1 relationship for each earthquake between stress drop and between-event residual of a ground motion prediction equation. We used the stress drop dataset of Oth (2013) for Japanese crustal earthquakes ranging 0.1 to 100 MPa and K-NET/KiK-net ground motion dataset against for several ground motion prediction equations with volcanic front treatment. Between-event residuals for ground accelerations and velocities are generally coincident with stress drop, as investigated by seismic intensity measures of Oth et al. (2015). Moreover, we found faster attenuation of ground acceleration and velocities for large stress drop events for the similar fault distance range and focal depth. It may suggest an alternative parameterization of stress drop to control attenuation distance rate for ground motion prediction equations. We also investigate 1-to-1 relationship and sigma for regional/national-scale stress drop variation and current national-scale ground motion equations.\n\nOn Time-II: Newton's Time.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRaju, C.

V.\n\nAn analysis is made of a generalized conservative mechanical system whose equations of motion contain a large parameter characterizing local forces acting along certain generalized coordinates. It is shown that the equations have periodic solutions which are close to periodic solutions to the corresponding degenerate equations. As an example, the periodic motions of a satellite with respect to its center of mass due to gravitational and restoring aerodynamic moments are examined for the case where the aerodynamic moment is much larger than the gravitational moment. Such motions can be treated as nominal unperturbed motions of a satellite under conditions of single-axis aerodynamic attitude control.\n\nA solution to the Navier-Stokes equations based upon the Newton Kantorovich method\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDavis, J.

The given nonmonotone line search technique can avoid computing the Jacobian matrix. The global convergence and the [Formula: see text]-order convergent rate of the main algorithm are established under suitable conditions.

A.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nNewton's method for nonlinear mechanics problems replaces the governing nonlinear equations by an iterative sequence of linear equations. When the linear equations are linear differential equations, the equations are usually solved by numerical methods. The iterative sequence in Newton's method can exhibit poor convergence properties when the nonlinear problem has multiple solutions for a fixed set of parameters, unless the iterative sequences are aimed at solving for each solution separately. The theory of the linear differential operators is often a better guide for solution strategies in applying Newton's method than the theory of linear algebra associated with the numerical analogs of the differential operators. In fact, the theory for the differential operators can suggest the choice of numerical linear operators. In this paper the method of variation of parameters from the theory of linear ordinary differential equations is examined in detail in the context of Newton's method to demonstrate how it might be used as a guide for numerical solutions.\n\nConvergence of Newton's method for a single real equation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCampbell, C.

Convergence is generally checked using the Contraction Mapping Theorem which yields sufficient but not necessary conditions for convergence of the general single point iteration method. The resulting convergence intervals are frequently considerably smaller than actual convergence zones. For a specific single point iteration method, such as Newton's method, better estimates of regions of convergence should be possible. A technique is described which, under certain conditions (frequently satisfied by well behaved functions) gives much larger zones where convergence is guaranteed.\n\nOptical analogues of the Newton-SchrÃ¶dinger equation and boson star evolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoger, Thomas; Maitland, Calum; Wilson, Kali; Westerberg, Niclas; Vocke, David; Wright, Ewan M; Faccio, Daniele\n\n2016-11-14\n\nMany gravitational phenomena that lie at the core of our understanding of the Universe have not yet been directly observed.

A rotating boson star is experimentally and numerically modelled by an optical beam propagating through a medium with a positive thermal nonlinearity and is shown to oscillate in time while also stable up to relatively high densities.

S.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nOur goal of this paper is of a purely theoretical question, however which would be fundamental in computational partial differential equations: Can a linear solution-structure for the equation of motion for an infinite nonlinear beam be directly manipulated for constructing its nonlinear solution? Here, the equation of motion is modeled as mathematically a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation. To answer the question, a pseudo-parameter is firstly introduced to modify the equation of motion. And then, an integral formalism for the modified equation is found here, being taken as a linear solution-structure. It enables us to formulate a nonlinear integral equation of second kind, equivalent to the original equation of motion. The fixed point approach, applied to the integral equation, results in proposing a new iterative solution procedure for constructing the nonlinear solution of the original beam equation of motion, which consists luckily of just the simple regular numerical integration for its iterative process; i.e., it appears to be fairly simple as well as straightforward to apply. A mathematical analysis is carried out on both natures of convergence and uniqueness of the iterative procedure by proving a contractive character of a nonlinear operator. It follows conclusively,therefore, that it would be one of the useful nonlinear strategies for integrating the equation of motion for a nonlinear infinite beam, whereby the preceding question may be answered. In addition, it may be worth noticing that the pseudo-parameter introduced here has double roles; firstly, it connects the original beam equation of motion with the integral equation, second, it is related with the convergence of the iterative method proposed here.\n\nEntropic forces in Brownian motion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoos, Nico\n\n2014-12-01\n\nInterest in the concept of entropic forces has risen considerably since Verlinde proposed in 2011 to interpret the force in Newton's second law and gravity as entropic forces. Brownian motionâthe motion of a small particle (pollen) driven by random impulses from the surrounding moleculesâmay be the first example of a stochastic process in which such forces are expected to emerge. In this article, it is shown that at least two types of entropic force can be identified in three-dimensional Brownian motion. This analysis yields simple derivations of known results of Brownian motion, Hooke's law, andâapplying an external (non-radial) forceâCurie's law and the Langevin-Debye equation.\n\nObjects in Motion\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDamonte, Kathleen\n\n2004-01-01\n\nOne thing scientists study is how objects move. A famous scientist named Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) spent a lot of time observing objects in motion and came up with three laws that describe how things move. This explanation only deals with the first of his three laws of motion. Newton's First Law of Motion says that moving objects will continueâ¦\n\nThe equations of motion of a secularly precessing elliptical orbit\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCasotto, S.; Bardella, M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe equations of motion of a secularly precessing ellipse are developed using time as the independent variable. The equations are useful when integrating numerically the perturbations about a reference trajectory which is subject to secular perturbations in the node, the argument of pericentre and the mean motion. Usually this is done in connection with Encke's method to ensure minimal rectification frequency. Similar equations are already available in the literature, but they are either given based on the true anomaly as the independent variable or in mixed mode with respect to time through the use of a supporting equation to track the anomaly. The equations developed here form a complete and independent set of six equations in time. Reformulations both of Escobal's and Kyner and Bennett's equations are also provided which lead to a more concise form.\n\nHigher symmetries of the SchrÃ¶dinger operator in Newton-Cartan geometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGundry, James\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe establish several relationships between the non-relativistic conformal symmetries of Newton-Cartan geometry and the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. In particular we discuss the algebra sch(d) of vector fields conformally-preserving a flat Newton-Cartan spacetime, and we prove that its curved generalisation generates the symmetry group of the covariant SchrÃ¶dinger equation coupled to a Newtonian potential and generalised Coriolis force. We provide intrinsic Newton-Cartan definitions of Killing tensors and conformal SchrÃ¶dinger-Killing tensors, and we discuss their respective links to conserved quantities and to the higher symmetries of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. Finally we consider the role of conformal symmetries in Newtonian twistor theory, where the infinite-dimensional algebra of holomorphic vector fields on twistor space corresponds to the symmetry algebra cnc(3) on the Newton-Cartan spacetime.\n\nIsaac Newton and the astronomical refraction.\n\nPubMed\n\nLehn, Waldemar H\n\n2008-12-01\n\nIn a short interval toward the end of 1694, Isaac Newton developed two mathematical models for the theory of the astronomical refraction and calculated two refraction tables, but did not publish his theory. Much effort has been expended, starting with Biot in 1836, in the attempt to identify the methods and equations that Newton used. In contrast to previous work, a closed form solution is identified for the refraction integral that reproduces the table for his first model (in which density decays linearly with elevation). The parameters of his second model, which includes the exponential variation of pressure in an isothermal atmosphere, have also been identified by reproducing his results. The implication is clear that in each case Newton had derived exactly the correct equations for the astronomical refraction; furthermore, he was the first to do so.\n\nGeneral Equations of Motion for a Damaged Asymmetric Aircraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBacon, Barton J.; Gregory, Irene M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThere is a renewed interest in dynamic characteristics of damaged aircraft both in order to assess survivability and to develop control laws to enhance survivability. This paper presents a set of flight dynamics equations of motion for a rigid body not necessarily referenced to the body's center of mass. Such equations can be used when the body loses a portion of its mass and it is desired to track the motion of the body s previous center of mass/reference frame now that the mass center has moved to a new position. Furthermore, results for equations presented in this paper and equations in standard aircraft simulations are compared for a scenario involving a generic transport aircraft configuration subject to wing damage.\n\nGround-Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) from a global dataset: the PEERPEER NGA equations\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBoore, David M.; Akkar, Sinan; Gulkan, Polat; van Eck, Torild\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe PEER NGA ground-motion prediction equation s (GMPEs) were derived by five developer teams over several years, resulting in five sets of GMPEs. The teams used various subsets of a global database of ground motions and metadata from shallow earthquakes in tectonically active regions in the development of the equations. Since their publication, the predicted motions from these GMPEs have been compared with data from various parts of the world â data that largely were not used in the development of the GMPEs. The comparisons suggest that the NGA GMPEs are applicable globally for shallow earthquakes in tectonically active regions.\n\nNewton's Path to Universal Gravitation: The Role of the Pendulum\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBoulos, Pierre J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMuch attention has been given to Newton's argument for Universal Gravitation in Book III of the \"Principia\".

Here, a simple three-node problem is used to demonstrate the convergence difficulties that can arise when solving the nonlinear, saturated ground water flow equation in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with and without nonlinear boundary conditions. For these cases, the characteristic types of convergence patterns are examined. Viewing these convergence patterns as orbits of an attractor in a dynamical system provides further insight. It is shown that the nonlinearity that arises from nonlinear head-dependent boundary conditions can cause more convergence difficulties than the nonlinearity that arises from flow in an unconfined aquifer. Furthermore, the effects of damping on both convergence and convergence rate are investigated. It is shown that no single strategy is effective for all problems and how understanding pitfalls and merits of several methods can be helpful in overcoming convergence difficulties. Results show that Picard iterations can be a simple and effective method for the solution of nonlinear, saturated ground water flow problems.\n\nEquations of motion for a flexible spacecraft-lumped parameter idealization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStorch, Joel; Gates, Stephen\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe equations of motion for a flexible vehicle capable of arbitrary translational and rotational motions in inertial space accompanied by small elastic deformations are derived in an unabridged form. The vehicle is idealized as consisting of a single rigid body with an ensemble of mass particles interconnected by massless elastic structure. The internal elastic restoring forces are quantified in terms of a stiffness matrix. A transformation and truncation of elastic degrees of freedom is made in the interest of numerical integration efficiency. Deformation dependent terms are partitioned into a hierarchy of significance. The final set of motion equations are brought to a fully assembled first order form suitable for direct digital implementation. A FORTRAN program implementing the equations is given and its salient features described.\n\nThe equation of motion for a radiating charged particle without self-interaction term\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerrera, L.\n\n1990-03-01\n\nThe motion of a radiating charged particle is studied from the point of view of relativistic classical mechanics. Thus, the resulting equation of motion emerges from equating the total rate of change of momentum to the external force, without the introduction of a âself-forceâ term. Doing so, one is forced to abandon either one, or both, of the following restrictions: (a) the external force is non-dissipative, (b) the proper mass of the particle is constant. By abandoning (a) we obtain the Mo and Papas equation of motion, whereas allowing variations in the proper mass one is led, uniquely, to the Bonnor equation. A new equation of motion is proposed by abandoning both (a) and (b).\n\nI ``Saw'' Newton's Three Laws\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShaw, Mike\n\n2012-11-01\n\nWould you like to build an inexpensive, highly visible, quickly assembled device that dramatically illustrates Newton's three laws of motion?

R. V.; Kvaternik, R. G.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nIt is possible to identify essentially four approaches by which analysts have established either the linear or nonlinear governing equations of motion for a particular problem related to the dynamics of rotating elastic bodies. The approaches include the effective applied load artifice in combination with a variational principle and the use of Newton's second law, written as D'Alembert's principle, applied to the deformed configuration. A third approach is a variational method in which nonlinear strain-displacement relations and a first-degree displacement field are used. The method introduced by Vigneron (1975) for deriving the linear flap-lag equations of a rotating beam constitutes the fourth approach. The reported investigation shows that all four approaches make use of the geometric nonlinear theory of elasticity. An alternative method for deriving the nonlinear coupled flap-lag-axial equations of motion is also discussed.\n\nNewton's Law: Not so Simple after All\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRobertson, William C.; Gallagher, Jeremiah; Miller, William\n\n2004-01-01\n\nOne of the most basic concepts related to force and motion is Newton's first law, which essentially states, \"An object at rest tends to remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. An object in motion in a straight line tends to remain in motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\" Judging by the time and spaceâ¦\n\nTransient aging in fractional Brownian and Langevin-equation motion.\n\nPubMed\n\nKursawe, Jochen; Schulz, Johannes; Metzler, Ralf\n\n2013-12-01\n\nStochastic processes driven by stationary fractional Gaussian noise, that is, fractional Brownian motion and fractional Langevin-equation motion, are usually considered to be ergodic in the sense that, after an algebraic relaxation, time and ensemble averages of physical observables coincide. Recently it was demonstrated that fractional Brownian motion and fractional Langevin-equation motion under external confinement are transiently nonergodic-time and ensemble averages behave differently-from the moment when the particle starts to sense the confinement. Here we show that these processes also exhibit transient aging, that is, physical observables such as the time-averaged mean-squared displacement depend on the time lag between the initiation of the system at time t=0 and the start of the measurement at the aging time t(a). In particular, it turns out that for fractional Langevin-equation motion the aging dependence on t(a) is different between the cases of free and confined motion. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the aged moments of the particle position as well as the time-averaged mean-squared displacement and present a numerical analysis of this transient aging phenomenon.\n\nMeasurement-based perturbation theory and differential equation parameter estimation with applications to satellite gravimetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Peiliang\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe numerical integration method has been routinely used by major institutions worldwide, for example, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ), to produce global gravitational models from satellite tracking measurements of CHAMP and/or GRACE types. Such Earth's gravitational products have found widest possible multidisciplinary applications in Earth Sciences. The method is essentially implemented by solving the differential equations of the partial derivatives of the orbit of a satellite with respect to the unknown harmonic coefficients under the conditions of zero initial values. From the mathematical and statistical point of view, satellite gravimetry from satellite tracking is essentially the problem of estimating unknown parameters in the Newton's nonlinear differential equations from satellite tracking measurements. We prove that zero initial values for the partial derivatives are incorrect mathematically and not permitted physically. The numerical integration method, as currently implemented and used in mathematics and statistics, chemistry and physics, and satellite gravimetry, is groundless, mathematically and physically. Given the Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of satellite motion with unknown equation parameters and unknown initial conditions, we develop three methods to derive new local solutions around a nominal reference orbit, which are linked to measurements to estimate the unknown corrections to approximate values of the unknown parameters and the unknown initial conditions. Bearing in mind that satellite orbits can now be tracked almost continuously at unprecedented accuracy, we propose the measurement-based perturbation theory and derive global uniformly convergent solutions to the Newton's nonlinear governing differential equations of satellite motion for the next generation of global gravitational models. Since the solutions are global uniformly convergent, theoretically speaking\n\nComputerized series solution of relativistic equations of motion.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBroucke, R.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nA method of solution of the equations of planetary motion is described.

In order to get the numerical approximation to the solution we have developed an algorithm in an infinite dimensional space framework using the concept of the generalized (Newton) differentiation. Regularization was done in order to approximate the problem with the unconstrained minimization problem and to make the pointwise maximum function Newton differentiable. Using semismooth Newton method, continuation method was developed in function space. For the numerical implementation the variational equations at Newton steps are discretized using finite elements method.\n\nApplication of Newton's method to the postbuckling of rings under pressure loadings\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThurston, Gaylen A.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe postbuckling response of circular rings (or long cylinders) is examined. The rings are subjected to four types of external pressure loadings; each type of pressure is defined by its magnitude and direction at points on the buckled ring. Newton's method is applied to the nonlinear differential equations of the exact inextensional theory for the ring problem. A zeroth approximation for the solution of the nonlinear equations, based on the mode shape corresponding to the first buckling pressure, is derived in closed form for each of the four types of pressure. The zeroth approximation is used to start the iteration cycle in Newton's method to compute numerical solutions of the nonlinear equations. The zeroth approximations for the postbuckling pressure-deflection curves are compared with the converged solutions from Newton's method and with similar results reported in the literature.\n\nNewton's absolute time and space in general relativity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGautreau, Ronald\n\n2000-04-01\n\nI describe a reference system in a spherically symmetric gravitational field that is built around times recorded by radially moving geodesic clocks. The geodesic time coordinate t and the curvature spatial radial coordinate R result in spacetime descriptions of the motion of the geodesic clocks that are exactly identical with equations following from Newton's absolute time and space used with his inverse square law. I show how to use the resulting Newtonian/general-relativistic equations for geodesic clocks to generate exact relativistic metric forms in terms of the coordinates (R,t). Newtonian theory does not describe light. However, the motion of light can be determined from the (R,t) general-relativistic metric forms obtained from Newtonian theory by setting ds2(R,t)=0. In this sense, a theory of light can be related to absolute time and space of Newtonian gravitational theory. I illustrate the (R,t) methodology by first solving the equations that result from a Newtonian picture and then examining the exact metric forms for the general-relativistic problems of the Schwarzschild field, gravitational collapse and expansion of a zero-pressure perfect fluid, and zero-pressure big-bang cosmology. I also briefly describe other applications of the Newtonian/general-relativistic formulation to: embedding a Schwarzschild mass into cosmology; continuously following an expanding universe from radiation to matter domination; Dirac's Large Numbers hypothesis; the incompleteness of Kruskal-Szekeres spacetime; double valuedness in cosmology; and the de Sitter universe.\n\nResearch on modeling and motion simulation of a spherical space robot with telescopic manipulator based on virtual prototype technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShi, Chengkun; Sun, Hanxu; Jia, Qingxuan; Zhao, Kailiang\n\n2009-05-01\n\nFor realizing omni-directional movement and operating task of spherical space robot system, this paper describes an innovated prototype and analyzes dynamic characteristics of a spherical rolling robot with telescopic manipulator.

Ecosystems are fundamentally different from machines, where individual components contain complex organisms instead of identical nonliving entities. Because of heterogeneity, diversity, self-organization, and openness, imbalances abound in nature. These are reflected in entropy increase over time (S > 0) and gradient persistence over space (F > 0). In this paper, three modified Newton's laws of change for ecosystems are suggested, and examples of imbalances from landscape-soil-water-ecosystem-climate will be illustrated. â Newton's 1st law of motion: âF=0 â dv/dt=0. i.e., if net force acting on an object is zero, then the object's velocity remains unchanged. Modified Newton's 1st law of change (imbalance #1): âF>0 â dv/dtâ¥0. i.e., unavoidable forcing exists in nature (âF>0), thus change always happens; however, with inertia/resistance in some systems or minimum threshold needed to change, dv/dtâ¥0. â Newton's 2nd law of motion: âF=ma. i.e., acceleration is inversely proportional to body mass. Modified Newton's 2nd law of change (imbalance #2): âFâ ma. i.e., either 1) it is hard to make change because of resilience, self-adjustment, nonlinearity of interactions-feedbacks in living systems (âFâ¥ma), or 2) there is possible threshold behavior or sudden collapse of a system (âFNewton's 3rd law of motion: âF(a,b)=-âF(b,a). i.e., for every force acting on a body, there is an equal (in magnitude) but opposite (in direction) reacting force. Modified Newton's 3rd law of change (imbalance #3): âF(a,b)â -âF(b,a). i.e., to every action, there is an opposite but not necessarily equal reaction (because of energy dissipation and/or self-organization, among other\n\nPendulum Motion and Differential Equations\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nReid, Thomas F.; King, Stephen C.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA common example of real-world motion that can be modeled by a differential equation, and one easily understood by the student, is the simple pendulum.

We investigate by analytic calculations and simulations how time-averaged observables (e.g., the time-averaged mean-squared displacement and displacement correlation) are affected by spatial confinement and dimensionality. In particular, we study the degree of weak ergodicity breaking and scatter between different single trajectories for this confined motion in the subdiffusive domain. The general trend is that deviations from ergodicity are decreased with decreasing size of the movement volume and with increasing dimensionality. We define the displacement correlation function and find that this quantity shows distinct features for fractional Brownian motion, fractional Langevin equation, and continuous time subdiffusion, such that it appears an efficient measure to distinguish these different processes based on single-particle trajectory data.\n\nSonic Beam Model of Newton's Cradle\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMenger, FredricÂ M.; Rizvi, SyedÂ A.Â A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe motions of Newton's cradle, consisting of several steel balls hanging side-by-side, have been analysed in terms of a sound pulse that travels via points of contact among the balls.

In addition to random motion, every particle can do relative motion through the movement of its quantum-sized volume. On the other way these motions can coincide. In this proposed model, the random motion is one kind of intrinsic properties of the particle. The every change of both speed of randomly intrinsic motion and or the velocity of translational motion of a quantum-sized volume will represent a transition between two states, and the change of speed of randomly intrinsicmoreÂ Â» motion will generate diffusion process or Brownian motion perspectives. Diffusion process can take place in backward and forward processes and will represent a dissipative system. To derive Schroedinger equation from our hypothesis we use time operator introduced by Nelson. From a fundamental analysis, we find out that, naturally, we should view the means of Newton's Law F(vector sign) = ma(vector sign) as no an external force, but it is just to describe both the presence of intrinsic random motion and the change of the particle energy.Â«Â less\n\nGlobal convergence of inexact Newton methods for transonic flow\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYoung, David P.; Melvin, Robin G.; Bieterman, Michael B.; Johnson, Forrester T.; Samant, Satish S.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nIn computational fluid dynamics, nonlinear differential equations are essential to represent important effects such as shock waves in transonic flow. Discretized versions of these nonlinear equations are solved using iterative methods. In this paper an inexact Newton method using the GMRES algorithm of Saad and Schultz is examined in the context of the full potential equation of aerodynamics. In this setting, reliable and efficient convergence of Newton methods is difficult to achieve. A poor initial solution guess often leads to divergence or very slow convergence. This paper examines several possible solutions to these problems, including a standard local damping strategy for Newton's method and two continuation methods, one of which utilizes interpolation from a coarse grid solution to obtain the initial guess on a finer grid. It is shown that the continuation methods can be used to augment the local damping strategy to achieve convergence for difficult transonic flow problems. These include simple wings with shock waves as well as problems involving engine power effects. These latter cases are modeled using the assumption that each exhaust plume is isentropic but has a different total pressure and/or"
