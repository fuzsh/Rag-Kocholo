The UCLouvain GW group is part of the Virgo Collaboration at the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) and has been active so far in searches for ultra-light dark matter, anisotropic stochastic GW background, and on a multi-messenger project aiming to detect neutrinos and gravitational waves originating from common astrophysical sources. In September 2024 new data analysis activities focusing on gravitational lensing and challenges in next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope will be launched under the direction of the newly hired professor Justin Janquart, who will also work at 50% of his time at ROB. The UCLouvain GW group is also involved in instrumentation projects for both Virgo and the future Einstein Telescope, notably at the two research and development facilities, E-TEST and ETPF. The ‘‘Time and Ionosphere” group of ROB conducts cutting edge research on remote atomic clocks comparisons, ionosphere/plasmasphere physics, and electromagnetic signal perturbations using the Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS: GPS, Galileo...). Among various activities, the group aims to exploit the excellent precision and stability of ground and space atomic clocks for tests of fundamental physics, as e.g. tests of local position invariance, or constraints on Dark Matter (DM) density close to the Earth. ROB has not been involved so far in GW research, but will soon be with the hiring of Justin Janquart on a permanent position shared with the UCLouvain GW group. The selected candidate will work on the analysis of data from ground-based GW laser interferometers and the GNSS constellations with a focus on searches for DM and/or novel techniques for the detection of GW signals.

We seek applicants with preferred expertise in strong gravitational lensing who want to expand their research focus to strong gravitational lensing involving gravitational waves. The ideal candidate will have considerable expertise in constructing lens models for galaxies as constrained by multiply-lensed light images, familiarity with analysing optical images, and will be committed to working with local experts to incorporate additional constraints provided by multiply-lensed gravitational-wave events. Current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors have the potential to reveal dark matter (DM) substructures through high-precision timing of the arrival of multiply-lensed gravitational waves. We envision that the combination of constraints from both light and gravitational waves will provide immunity from stellar microlensing and reveal the nature of such sub-structures. At CUHK, since 2016, the group (led by Otto Hannuksela) has built tools to detect, analyse, and use gravitational-wave lensing with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors in isolation or with electromagnetic imaging (e.g., [1]). At HKU, the group (led by Jeremy Lim) is a leading expert in using traditional gravitational lensing of light rays to elucidate the nature of DM, including investigating the linkage between dark matter substructures and their model predictions, such as subhalos (e.g., WIMPs) and pervasive density modulations (e.g., Axions) (e.g., [2]). Furthermore, there are three dark matter groups (led by Kenny Ng, Tsang Keung Chan, Ming-Chung Chu) at CUHK that specialise in numerical simulations, indirect detection, and theory, and they have expertise in theoretical aspects of dark matter modelling. Applicants should have (i) a PhD in Physics, Astronomy, or a related field and have a track record in lens modelling—expertise in implementing new strong lensing analyses and modelling, a publication track record in substructure lensing, and experience implementing Bayesian analysis models are highly advantageous. The appointee will be responsible for filling the role of a lens modelling expert in the joint endeavour to connect these two branches of lensing and pursue dark matter studies. Apart from the joint work, the position comes with significant autonomy. The appointee is strongly encouraged to integrate and work with these groups freely and to develop his/her own independent research line throughout the study, with 50% time allotted to this purpose. Appointment will be made on a contract basis for two years commencing September 2024, renewable, subject to mutual agreement. Applications will be reviewed immediately and continue until the position is filled. Application Instructions Applicants should submit the following documents in the online application: (1) an up-to-date CV; (2) a cover letter; (3) the names and contact information of at least two referees; (4) a research statement outlining his/her interests and qualifications; and (5) two reference letters.
