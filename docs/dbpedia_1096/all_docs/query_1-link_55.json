        "text": "Journalists covering water issues in the American West now have an extensive new visual library at their disposal — and it’s thanks in no small part to the efforts of former KSJ Project Fellow Ted Wood (’21). Wood set out last spring to photograph the Colorado River basin, from its headwaters in Colorado to downstream reservoirs and branches in states like Arizona and Utah. It was part of a collaboration with The University of Colorado’s Water Desk, which aims to create a collection of photos, videos, and data visualizations that can be used, free of charge, by reporters.\n\nLast month, the Water Desk released its first big trove of Wood’s photos, including images of Colorado’s Blue Mesa Reservoir, the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming and Utah, and the Santa Cruz River in Arizona. The Water Desk plans to roll out more of Wood’s images in the months ahead. All imagery in the library is available for editorial and non-commercial use under a free Creative Commons license.\n\nWood now hopes to continue working with the project in the Rio Grande watershed.\n\nChristoph Drösser (’94) has been awarded with the German Children’s Literature Award in the nonfiction category, for the book “100 Kinder” (“100 Children”). Drösser, the book’s author, will share the award with Nina Coenenberg, the illustrator.\n\nJudges liked the book’s central conceit, wherein the titular 100 children symbolize the 2 billion children currently living on the planet. Six of the children live in Europe, four in North America, eight in South America, one in Australia, 25 in Africa, and 56 in Asia. Using that idea as a jumping off point, the judges write, “the book uses a cleverly coordinated combination of texts, illustrations, and infographics to create a comprehensive tableau of social, political and cultural aspects.”\n\nThe German Children’s Literature Awards were announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October.\n\nThe award is the second in a pair of recent honors for Drösser. He was also named one of four inaugural fellows for the Free University of Berlin’s MIP.labor initiative, an ideas workshop for science communication on mathematics, computer science, and physics. His six-month fellowship project will deal with fairness and bias in machine learning algorithms.\n\nEdward Struzik (‘97) published a new book last month, “Swamplands: Tundra Beavers, Quaking Bogs, and the Improbable World of Peat,” his third with Island Press. The book celebrates the often-overlooked natural environments “in all their offbeat glory.”\n\n“Expect to encounter the unexpected in this science- and story-rich book,” writes Pulitzer-Prizewinning author Jack E. Davis. “Edward Struzik and a procession of eccentric-yet-wise characters turn old, deprecating notions on their head and reveal fabled wastelands to be vital wonderlands.”\n\nStruzik is currently a fellow at the Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen’s University in Canada.\n\nMeera Subramanian (‘17) recently helped to launch the Boston University-based Religion and Environment Story Project, which offers fellowships and funding to journalists to bridge the divide between the religion and science beats. The project aims to promote new thinking and new narratives that will inform and educate the public, especially on the climate crisis.\n\nThe effort follows Subramanian’s recent stints as Princeton University’s Barron Visiting Professor and as a board member of the Society of Environmental Journalists. She continues to freelance, including as a contributing editor of Orion magazine, where she recently wrote “The Nature of Plastics.”\n\nAfter finding success as a science writer and health columnist for the Boston Globe and as a nonfiction book author, Judy Foreman (‘90) is now foraying into fiction. Her debut novel, “CRISPR’d,” is a medical thriller that imagines a rogue scientist who uses the gene editing technology CRISPR to nefarious ends.\n\nWrites best-selling author Robin Cook, “Foreman has written a page-turner — a medical thriller cum cautionary tale — that will not just have you on the edge of your seat but will enlighten you about the power, and potential dangers, of the new gene-editing technology, CRISPR.”\n\n“CRISPR’d” is set to publish in February 2022.\n\nFinally, an update: The September installment of Alumni Notes recognized 2018-19 class members Jeff DelViscio, Pakinam Amer, Rachel Gross, and Magnus Bjerg for their contributions to the film project, “In Event of Moon Landing,” which was nominated for a News & Documentary Emmy Award. In an October ceremony, “In Event of Moon Landing” was announced as the winner in its category, Outstanding Interactive Media, Documentary. Congratulations to DelViscio, Amer, Gross, Bjerg, and their collaborators!\n\nHere’s what other alumni are writing, a compendium from Federico Kukso (‘16):\n\nAmina Khan (‘19): “Pregnant women were kept out of clinical trials. That left them vulnerable to COVID-19.” Los Angeles Times.\n\nZack Colman (‘16): “Time to ‘get scared’: World’s scientists say disastrous climate change is here,” Politico (with Karl Mathiesen).\n\nGiovana Girardi (‘15): “Brazil’s emissions are distorted without counting Amazon degradation,” Folha de S. Paulo (in Portuguese).\n\nJeff Tollefson (‘06): “Top climate scientists are sceptical that nations will rein in global warming,” Nature.\n\nMaryn McKenna (‘14): “The Race Is On to Develop a Vaccine Against Every Coronavirus,” Wired.\n\nFederico Kukso (‘16): “How ‘Dune’ inspires innovations to fight droughts and climate change,” Agencia Sinc (in Spanish).\n\nTeresa Carr (‘18): “Women’s Professional STEM Societies Rethink Gender Diversity,” Undark.\n\nHerton Escobar (‘07): “The Diaspora: Why scientists are leaving Brazil,” Piauí (In Portuguese).\n\nValeria Román (‘06): “She Worked with Marie Curie and Debunked Cancer Myths: The Unknown Story of a Cutting Edge Researcher,” Infobae (in Spanish).\n\nWycliffe Muga (‘07): “Kenya’s energy future unclear,” The Star.\n\nSascha Karberg (‘09): “Antarctica Aliens: The Crumbling Base of Life,” Der Tagesspiegel (in German).\n\nMarcin Rotkiewicz (‘09): “What are mental time travels?” Polityka (in Polish).\n\nChris Mooney (‘10): “Russia allows methane leaks at planet’s peril,” The Washington Post (with Steven Mufson, Isabelle Khurshudyan, Brady Dennis, John Muyskens and Naema Ahmed).\n\nYves Sciama (‘14): “Amazon could reach a point of no return,” Reporterre (in French).\n\nFabio Turone (‘17): “Doctors Experience Long-term Mental Health Effects of COVID-19,” Medscape (w Tim Locke).\n\nChristine Mlot (’94): “Connecting the Dots,” OnWisconsin (University of Wisconsin–Madison Alumni Magazine)\n\nJustin Gillis (‘05): “Will Glasgow Be the Climate Breakthrough We Need?” New York Times\n\nIn the space of just a few months, Christoph Droesser (‘94) has published not one but two German-language books. The first, “When Things Talk to Us: Voice Assistants, Computers as Authors & Social Bots” (“Wenn die Dinge mit uns reden”), is a compact exploration of the history and present state of computer linguistics. The book takes readers from the earliest attempts to create talking machines, all the way up to the world of digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and language models like GPT-3.\n\nThe second book, “It’s about Sausage: What you have to know if you like to eat meat” (“Es geht um die wurst”), is a kids book about — you guessed it — meat. Created in collaboration with illustrator Nora Coenenberg, this nonfiction book aims to give young readers a clear-eyed, kid-friendly look at the ethical considerations that go into being a conscientious meat eater. “Parents who serve their kid burgers or hot dogs have to face the day when the child finds out that an animal was killed in the process,” Droesser writes of the book. “A lot of questions follow: how did the animal live? How did it die? Is eating meat healthy? What about the environment? Nora and I both eat meat, so we wanted to find out if it is possible to consume meat with a clear conscience.”\n\nAs part of her work with the United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Education, Zarina Khan (‘08) has launched Innovation@UAE, the first magazine in the country dedicated to covering high impact research coming out of the UAE’s top universities. Khan serves as editorial director and lead writer for the quarterly, bilingual publication, which presents a mix of news, research profiles, event listings, and more.\n\nInnovation@UAE is a digital magazine that is available for free on the ISSUU digital publishing app. The English-language version of the magazine’s inaugural issue can be viewed here. An Arabic-language version of the magazine can be viewed here. Khan says she is hoping to expand the size and scope of the magazine in the coming year.\n\nThis February, John D. Cox (‘96) received high praise from one of the world’s most famous philanthropists. Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates referred to Cox’s 2000 book, “Weather for Dummies,” as “probably the best book written for a general audience about the subject,” and as recommended reading for anyone who wants to understand climate change. Gates was asked about Cox’s work during a February interview with the New York Times Book Review. Gates spoke with the publication while promoting his own book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” which makes direct reference to Cox’s work on “Weather for Dummies.”\n\nFabio Turone (‘17) has just completed his first book, written with Daniela Ovadia, on research integrity. Titled “Scienza senza maiuscola: L’etica della ricerca per una cittadinanza scientifica,” or “Science without a capital ‘S’: Research Ethics for a scientific citizenship,” the book illustrates the basic principles of research ethics through the stories of scientists who found themselves unable to keep up with the expectations and high ideals of “Capital S” science, and through the stories of other scientists who spontaneously corrected their own mishaps or rolled up their sleeves to find a fix for the problems. The book will be on the shelves in Italy on April 28th.\n\nThe book is just one of several endeavors that have kept Turone busy since his 2016-17 KSJ fellowship. He became the Italy correspondent for UK-based Research Professional News, and in 2020 he chaired the European Conference of Science Journalism in Trieste. He was also among the first contributors to Nature Italy, the newly launched Italian edition of Nature magazine.\n\nHere’s what other alumni are writing, a compendium from Federico Kukso (‘16):\n\nJeff DelViscio (’19): “Halley’s Comet Can Help Us Understand These Uncertain Times,” Scientific American (with Henry DaCosta and Mitch Myers).\n\nRichard Fisher (‘20): “The moments that could have accidentally ended humanity,” BBC.\n\nAmina Khan (‘19): “Another racial disparity that may be heightened by the pandemic: access to outpatient care,” Los Angeles Times.\n\nFederico Kukso (‘16): “No one is saved alone: vaccination is always a collective act,” Le Monde Diplomatique (in Spanish).\n\nAndrada Fiscutean (‘20): “Remote work raises threats from consumer IoT devices,” CSO.\n\nPakinam Amer (‘19): “Machine Learning Pwns Old-School Atari Games,” Scientific American.\n\nValeria Román (‘05): “He is a biologist, he has the disease that Stephen Hawking suffered and he investigates in a wheelchair to find a cure as soon as possible,” Infobae (in Spanish).\n\nTeresa Carr (‘18): “Are We Screening Too Much for Skin Cancer?
