        "text": "Okay, I know I’m pretty late for this and nobody cares, but I’ll do it anyway. Been putting it off for a while, and I’ve been updating my list on my Letterboxd frequently so there’s that, but I recently finally got to see one film that sneaked into my top 10 and I had to expand on it. Also it made me reconsider my awards thingy and add it in in a few categories. Anyway, here are my favourite films of last year. First I’ll do a round up from 30-11, then I’ll talk a little about each one in the top 10.\n\n30. Aniara, 29. The Souvenir, 28. The King, 27. Dolemite is My Name, 26. Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles, 25. Knives Out, 24. I Lost my Body, 23. Jojo Rabbit, 22. Her Smell, 21. Midsommar, 20. Us, 19. Ad Astra, 18. Monos, 17. The Two Popes, 16. Ash is the Purest White, 15. Long Day’s Journey Into Night, 14. Atlantics, 13. The Farewell, 12. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 11. Joker.\n\nAnd now…\n\n10. 1917 (Sam Mendes)\n\nI’m not too fond of war films as I feel its sort of a saturated genre by now, but I’d be lying if I wasn’t hugely impressed by the technical mastery of Mendes’ directing, Deakins’ cinematography and Newman’s score. Narratively nothing special, but cinematically speaking it is a great achievement, and it was probably the most “cinematic” film of 2019 in terms of theater-experience.\n\n9. The Nightingale (Jennifer Kent)\n\nThis is the one. The one that made me reconsider. I was putting it off for a time because I was waiting to be in the right state of mind to watch it and damn is it a hard watch, but its one of the most rewarding and haunting films I’ve seen in a long time. Brutal yet beautiful, Jennifer Kent’s sophomore film proves she’s a talent to watch. Its got one of the most effective anatagonists I’ve seen in a long time, and that final scene is just breathtaking.\n\n8. Uncut Gems (Safdie Brothers)\n\nSpeaking of anxiety inducing cinema, the Safdies’ new effort is one hell of a ride. Watch Adam Sandlers like you’ve seen him before in the best role of his career. Watch a roller coaster of emotions and anxiety as a gambler tries to make it big. Watch one of the best crafted films in terms of editing and sound design of 2019. And finally, watch the tensest basketball game put to film since Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan teamed up to beat the Monstars.\n\n7. Pain and Glory (Pedro Almodovar)\n\nWhat is probably Almodovar’s most personal film carries what is probably Antonio Banderas’ and Penelope Cruz’s best performances. The story of an aging director who struggles with his health and his past, its beautifully shot and movingly human. While Almodovar at times may feel like an adquired taste, this is a film that can be watched an understood under the sole condition of having a human heart.\n\n6. High Life (Claire Denis)\n\nThis might be controversial, since I know this fim has strong detractors, but I really enjoyed Claire Denis’ weird hyper-sexual and surreal sci fi film. Its sort of impenetrable at first, but once you get a grasp of what is going on and let yourself go in the midst of such insanity there is lots of artistic merit there. Definitely not for all tastes, but if you’re into the avant-garde you might find something for you here.\n\n5. Marriage Story (Noah Baumbach)\n\nThis film caught me by surprise. I’m not the biggest Baumbach fan, I’m not the biggest fan of relationship stories, and frankly I wasn’t expecting much beyond a well acted drama, but boy was I wrong. Its beautifully human, even if I dont have anything to relate to it. Both Driver and Johansson give some of the best performances of the year, the soundtrack is excellent and the writing is just exquisite.\n\n4. Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Celine Sciamma)\n\nAnother romance that caught me by surprise. Beyond the beautiful cinematography, the great production and costume design, the perfect acting and assured direction by Sciama, there’s something truly moving about this story. My favourite scene is the one by the campfire, hands down. Art in its purest state.\n\n3. Parasite (Bong Joon-ho)\n\nEveryone’s favourite darling and the first ever film not in the English language to win Best Picture, this movie deserves every bit of praise its getting. Thematically rich and nuanced, expertly crafted with some of the best edited sequences in years, a screenplay full of surprises that leaves you with a lot of food for thought, and an ensemble cast that perfectly fit their roles, there’s nothing more I can say about Parasite that hasn’t been said already.\n\n2. The Lighthouse (Robert Eggers)\n\nEggers’ follow up to 2015’s “The VVitch” is one hell of a ride. Officially a horror film, but in reality more of a surreal nightmare, The Lighthouse turns the insanity up to 11 to create one of the most unforgettable film experiences of last year. Pattison gives what is probably the best performance of his career (on a side note, its funny how he stars in the two weirdest films of 2019), but it is Willem Defoe who absolutely commands the screen. Couple that with a killer score, haunting sound design, lots of surreal imagery, beautiful black and white cinematography and an unforgettably idiosyncratic scrip and you have the makings for a future cult classic. Eggers is indeed a master of the macabre.\n\n1. The Irishman (Martin Scorsese)\n\nOkay, I’ve gotta admit I’m a bit biased with this one: I’m a huge Scorsese fan, a huge fan of both DeNiro and Pacino and seeing them together alongside Joe Pesci is also amazing, and a huge gangster genre fan as well, so I was ready beforehand to love this movie. But what really sold it to me as a masterpiece was the last 30 minutes: haunting, meditative, universal, beautiful. I wasn’t expecting such a thoughtful exploration of death from a Scorsese film; add to that the dialogue he has with his own cinema, some of the most powerful performances this legendary actors have given in years, and a mafia epic that spans decades and you’ve got the makings for an instant favourite of mine. Its not perfect, the CGI deaging is a bit obvious and makes for some uncanny valley moments, and while I don’t mind the runtime there are moments that do feel a bit extra (small dialogue exchanges here and there), but it is nonetheless my favourite of last year.\n\nSo there you have it, my top films of 2019. Late to the party but better late than never. See ya around, might keep blogging, though with not much regularity. Until next time!\n\nYada yada yada, you know the drill. Been away for a while (was writing my thesis), still kept doing this kind of stuff on the little moments I had, plus sometimes I reviewed films on my Letterboxd, you can check them out if you like. Anyway, Parasite won Best Picture, that’s neat, I wonder if it’ll bring a change in the way the Oscars hand out awards and make them recognize more international, indie and art house stuff? Right? RIGHT? Lol, probably not. Anyway, here’s how I would have awarded movies from last year if it were up to me (if you’re wondering what rules I follow, just click on one of these two links: Awarding the Best in Film of 2018 the Right Way or Awarding the Best in Film of 2017 the Right Way, I’m too lazy to explain anyway).\n\nBest Action Film:\n\n1917\n\nJohn Wick 3\n\nThe King\n\nShazam!\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n\nWinner: 1917\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nAnother Day of Life\n\nBuñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nKlaus\n\nToy Story 4\n\nWinner: I Lost My Body\n\nBest Comedy Film:\n\nDolemite is my Name\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nKnives Out\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nThe Souvenir\n\nWinner: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nBest Horror Film:\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nMidsommar\n\nUs\n\nReady or Not\n\nThe Wind\n\nWinner: The Lighthouse\n\nBest International Film:\n\nAtlantics – Senegal\n\nMonos – Colombia\n\nPain and Glory – Spain\n\nParasite – South Korea\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire – France\n\nWinner: Parasite\n\nBest Sci Fi/Fantasy Film:\n\nAd Astra\n\nAniara\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nHigh Life\n\nI Am Mother\n\nWinner: High Life\n\nBest Thriller:\n\nJoker\n\nMonos\n\nThe Nightingale\n\nParasite\n\nUncut Gems\n\nWinner: Uncut Gems\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\n1917\n\nAd Astra\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nLong Day’s Journey Into Night\n\nMidsommar\n\nMonos\n\nWinner: 1917\n\nBest Editing:\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nThe Irishman\n\nJoker\n\nMidsommar\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nParasite\n\nWinner: Parasite\n\nBest Sound:\n\n1917\n\nAd Astra\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nMonos\n\nUncut Gems\n\nWinner: The Lighthouse\n\nBest Music:\n\n1917\n\nAd Astra\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nJoker\n\nThe King\n\nMidsommar\n\nWinner: Joker\n\nBest Production Design:\n\nAd Astra\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nLittle Women\n\nMidsommar\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nWinner: Portrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nDolemite is my Name\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nLittle Women\n\nThe Nightingale\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nWinner: Portrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nBest Visual Effects:\n\n1917\n\nAd Astra\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nThe Irishman\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nWinner: 1917\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nAniara\n\nAnother Day of Life\n\nBuñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nThe Irishman\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nJoker\n\nLittle Women\n\nThe King\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nWinners: 3.

Congratulations on all the winners for this totally meaningless internet prize that doesn’t even really exist and they’ll never find out about :p. Anyway, I know some of these choices might be controversial but I’m open to any sort of dialogue, so shoot your alternatives in the comments. This is my first blog post in like 6 months or something like that, don’t know if I’ll fully return to blogging but there’s a chance. I might write a couple of posts in the coming weeks, but can’t promise I’ll stay for good since this year is gonna be a little complicated for me, but I might try and find a way whenever I have the time. Anyway, keep watching movies and have fun, peace!\n\nSo we are already into the second half of the year (time flies) and we’ve already seen a few very interesting new releases. While not as exciting as this time last year in my opinion, there has been some films that are very worthy of discussion. Some of these were actually released during the festival circuit last year, but they entered major distribution this year – the only exception to this criteria I’m not including is “Birds of Passage”, which I actually caught mid summer last year in my home country, and since it was our net at the Oscars for 2018 I still consider it a 2018 release. Also, I’m mainly considering films that were released from January to June, so no “Midsommar” (which sadly hasn’t been released yet where I live). I also haven’t been able to watch “Toy Story 4” yet, but from what I’ve heard it might be the only fourth part in a movie franchise that is actually good.\n\nAnyway, usually I would now talk about some honourable mentions, but I don’t think I’ve seen enough films this year that deserve this categorization to actually make a whole session. There are still, however, a couple that were or almost were pretty good and I’ll discuss them briefly: “Brightburn” – some great acting and cool scenes, but ultimately disappointing considering the potential of its premise, needed to flesh out Brandon’s character more; “The Beach Bum” – unique, funny and some times straight up outrageous, while boasting an excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey but kind of feels hollow at the end (though you could argue it was done in purpose to reflect the main character); “Booksmart” – probably gonna get criticized for this, but this movie didn’t do much for me, it’s well vast and Olvia Wilde does a great job directing, but the humour was very hit and miss and for all its progressive ideas it does lack nuance ; and of course there’s “Avengers: Endgame”, which I reviewed earlier, a film that brings the Infinity Saga to an end, but also goes a little too much into nostalgic territory (albeit doing it right for the most part), and it takes Marvel’s greatest villain and doesn’t do him enough justice. Also, for kids stuff I really enjoyed both “Shazam!” And ” Detective Pikachu”.\n\nOkay, so with that out of the way, let’s get started with the top 10 Films of the first half of 2019:\n\n10. The Dead Don’t Die (Jim Jarmusch)\n\nAn excellent cast and a very talented auteur at the helm, even with all its great moments one can’t help but feel somewhat disappointed by Jarmusch’s latest film. A zombie flick doesn’t sound like your standard material for an indie director, but after what he did with vampires in “Only Lovers Left Alive” I had high hopes for this. It tells the story of a zombie outbreak from the perspectives of several residents in a small town. It has some very hilarious scenes, there ‘s some unexpected stuff going on, and it’s wonderful cast all give excellent performances all around. The thing is, the film has too many characters for a runtime of around 100 minutes. You could cut out a couple of the subplots to better focus on some of the most interesting characters (I’d day Driver, Murray, Swinton and Waits were the most interesting aspects), or alternatively make the film’s run to be up to two hours maybe, and you’d have a better movie all around. Regardless, the film is a very entertaining piece and does deserve your time.\n\n9. The Perfection (Richard Sheppard)\n\nPerhaps somewhat ironically, “The Perfection” is far from perfect. A psychosexual thriller about musical prodigees years after they’ve left a shady music academy. The film seems that it kind of struggles to decide what type of story it wants to be, it twists and turns in many unexpected ways, some lackluster but some devilishly good. I’ve seen people criticize this film because it isn’t “realistic”, but this isn’t the type of movie you should judge on its level of realism. It is convoluted and far fetched, but it still does achieve what it sets out to do: to be a disturbing and provocative mindf*ck of a movie. Also, Allison Williams’ performance deserves a shout out. It has tonal and pacing issues (another example of a film that could’ve benefited from an extra 10-15 minutes), and like I said it is somewhat convoluted, but as a thriller in the vein of Korean revenge cinema Italian giallos I’d say it is pretty effective. Again, not necessarily a “great” film, but the only reason it sits above “The Dead Don’t Die” is that it doesn’t have a proven outstanding director from whom you’d expect more.\n\n8. Monos (Alejandro Lanés)\n\nI may not be considering “Birds of Passage” as an entry for this year, but Colombia has another great recent film among its ranks that hopefully sparks some attention. It tells the story of a group of youngsters in a mountain terrain far away from civilization, being trained and indoctrinated to fight an illegal war. The film never specified if they belong to the guerrillas or the paramilitary organizations, and I liked it all the more for not taking a political stance. The film is a surreal fever dream, a descent into he’ll well within the Colombian jungles. The imagery is beautiful and brutal, the sound design is extremely immersive, the story is great throughout and the actors all give their best. If I had to signal one flaw it’d be some of the character’s lack of characterisation, but I’d say it’s not a big issue. I caught the film at the Berlinale earlier this year, and I’d recommend to anyone to go out and see it, the future of Colombian cinema seems bright.\n\n7. The Miracle at the Sargasso Sea (Syllas Tzoumerkas)\n\nAnother film I caught at this year’s Berlinale, a Greek mystery film with its surrealist moments and an appeal in the tradition of the country’s Greek wave. It tells the story of a detective, played by the great Ageliki Papoulia, who is transferred from Athens to a small coastal town, where, many years later, she must solve the apparent suicide of a local musician, for which she must uncover some of the town’s disturbing secrets. It is a complex film with several heavy topics, but it managed to handle them (mostly) with great care and respect. Papoulia gives an excellent performance in the central role, and her character offers perhaps a new heroine mould in this sort of surrealistic neo-noir genre. I’d say the film’s major weaknesses are its first scene (which isn’t particularly bad but it feels from another movie altogether) and it’s last (which kind of robs the ambiguity of the main character’s arc), but all in all a pretty good and well made film, alas I’d hesitate to recommend it since it is a hard watch and may play out more as an acquired taste.\n\n6. I Am Mother (Grant Sputore)\n\nAs you may know, I’m a big fan of thought provoking science fiction, and this year’s “I Am Mother” offers exactly that. It tells of an A.I. known as “Mother” (voiced by Rose Byrne), which is activated one day after an extinction event that wiped out humanity, and is tasked to raise a new generation of humans. Years pass and a new offspring, simply known as “Daughter” (Clara Ruggard) starts her path into adolescence, when a mysterious woman (Hilary Swank) appears, meaning that Daughter is in fact not the only human alive, what leads her to ask questions about the nature of her situation. This film poses all sorts of philosophical and ethical questions, is tense and thrilling, extremely well executed, perfectly acted and it develops into very unpredictable territory. Ruggard gives a breakthrough performance, and both Swank and Byrne deserve major recognition for their roles. If you’re a fan of thought provoking science fiction that’s also thrilling and narratively compelling you should check this one out.\n\n5. Her Smell (Alex Ross Perry)\n\nA musical drama starring Elisabeth Moss as a troubled rockstar whose self-destructive behaviour compromises her career and personal relationships. A relatively small film, it is in reality a very compelling and at times heart breaking narrative, even if it steps sometimes into melodrama territory. Elisabeth Moss gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career as the troubled Becky, a towering shift that’ll sadly get ignored in the award season since this is a low profile film. The music is pretty great, some sort of mid 2000s rock-pop mixed with some sentimental ballades for good meassure. I once saw a film by Perry starring Moss as well at a film festival (“Queen of Earth”), and after finding out that there was a new collaboration between the two I decided I had to watch it as soon as possible, and I’ve gotta say that “Her Smell” not only lived up to that expectation but also surpassed it.\n\n4. Us (Jordan Peele)\n\nJordan Peele follows up his breakout hit “Get Out” with another smart horror filled with tons of social commentary. Lupita N’yongo stars as Adelaide, a woman who years ago had a disturbing encounter at a house of mirrors at the beach in Santa Cruz as a kid. Now, years later, she and her family visit Santa Cruz again, only to be met by doppelgängers, dark reflections of themselves. Peele’s sophomore effort solidifies him as a true talent to be reckoned with, showing his mastery of the genre and his ability to handle complex social issues. Unlike “Get Out”, which is pretty straight forward with its commentary, I’d argue that in “Us” it is left somewhat more ambigous, albeit such an ambitious and complicated project does leave a sense that it’s reach extended its grasp. I’d argue that his first film is a much tighter outing that knows and embraces its limitations, whereas “Us” does suffer a little from being too ambitious. Regardless, it is still an excellent horror film that comments on the american reality and issuses such as inequality, social mobility and gaining social status at the expense of others.\n\n3. Ash is the Purest White (Jia Zhangke)\n\nI came into this film expecting a gangster/crime drama from a chinese perspective, but what I got was something much more rewarding. It tells the story of Qiao, whose boyfriend Bin is a mob boss with a lot of influence. One night, a biker gang attacks them in attempt to dethrone Bin, so Qiao steps in, firing a gun into the sky, what scares them off but also calls the attention of the police; Qiao is arrested. She’s released after five years and here’s where the real drama begins: we see from her perspective how she’s unable to adapt to a rapidly changing world. China’s development as a country has been one of the fastest ones in history, and this film thematizes that with particular care for the people who aren’t really able to keep up. If anything, the film plays out like a gangster film for the first 30 minutes, but afterwards it becomes a deeply personal drama about this woman trying to understand this world. A character study which pays careful attention to the small nuances of interpersonal relationships in such an environment, which effectively shows why Zhangke is one of China’s most celebrated modern auteurs.\n\n2. Long Day’s Journey into Night (Bi Gan)\n\nThe director of 2015’s surprise film “Kaili Blues” is back with another exploration of cinematic time that boasts great technical prowess. The film tells the story of a man who returns to his home town for the funeral of his father, while reminiscing about an old friend called Wildcat, and starts searching for a long lost love. This film had a particularly interesting marketing campaign in China: it was released at New Year’s eve and it was marketed as the ultimate romantic film, with special interest on the final scene as the clock would strike midnight and signal the beginning of 2019. It became the highest grossing opening for a chinese film, yet the box office returns decreased afterwards because, as it turns out, the film was something completely different to what was marketed. Viewers expecting a romantic drama were flabbergasted by an out of the ordinary and far from straight forward art film that played with time perception and memory. The last hour of the film is a single continous shot that flies through different locations, meetings with characters from different eras, and defies traditional story expectations. This final sequence alone makes it worth while, if anything because of the great technical aspect (not to mention its in 3D), but also how the film handles its themes and the particular way it tells its story makes this an unforgetable film experience.\n\n1. High Life (Claire Denis)\n\nIn what is perhaps my favourite film of the year as of now, Claire Denis directs a talented cast that includes Juliette Binoche, Robert Pattison and Mia Goth in a nightmarish mix of science fiction, horror and art house sensibilities. A group of criminals are sent to space as a punishment in a mission to harvest energy from a black hole. Unbeknownst to them, they are there to be used as guinea pigs for sexual and reproductive experimentation, in an effort by Dr. Dibs (Binoche) to achieve artificial insemination. This is a very disturbing film that may appear inaccesible at first (for the first 40 minutes or so I was struggling to understand what the hell was going on), but once you get a semblance of an idea for what is happening things will start falling into place. The film is full of surreal and nightmarish sequences that make it unforgettable. The performances are all around great, Goth demonstrating she’s excellent for such dark tales as she did in “Nymphomaniac”, “The Survivalist” and last year’s “Suspiria”, and Pattison keeps solidifying his status as an indie star (which does give hope for the future Batman). But of course, the MVP of the picture is Juliette Binoche, twisted as she is sensous, disturbing yet oddly charming, stealing the spotlight in every scene she’s in. Claire Denis has crafted one of the most unforgettable films of the year, bringing her talent and unique vision to the science fiction genre, the result being what could be this year’s best.\n\nSo there you have it. Thanks for reading and I hope you liked it. If you could share this with your friends and family it’d be of great help, and don’t forget to hit that follow button to keep up to date with this blog’s contents. Also, check out my Letterboxd to see this list develop as the year goes by and I watch newer films. Here’s to hoping that the second half of 2019 brings even more great films. Until next time!\n\nOne of the most important figures of Italian auteur cinema during the sixties and seventies (a period that can be regarded as a golden age for art cinema), Michelangelo Antonioni was an eternal modernist and isconsidered as the man who took Italian cinema from its generalist phase into the next step in its development (through his 1957 film: “Il Grido”). Always developing filmic ways to propose human questions, one could describe Antonioni’s project as the diagnosis of modernity’s illnesses. From the inability to communicate within a relationship in the famous “trilogy of decadence” ( “L’Avventura”, “La Notte”, “L’Eclisse”, 1960-1962), to the internal struggles and alienation of a woman who sees the world in a manner that’s terrifyingly close to today’s reality in “Il Desserto Rosso” (1964), to the ethical questions implied the discovery of a possible murder in “Blow Up” (1966), or the political and social complexities in the USA in the late sixties and seventies as well as the pervasiveness of materialistic culture in “Zabriskie Point” (1970), or a man who is going through an existential crisis and chooses to assume a new identity that will endanger his life in “The Passenger”, among several other examples in his vast filmography. Before we go on, be warned: this article contains spoilers for several Antonio films, though to be honest, you can know what happens and yet that won’t prepare you for the experience of watching his films.\n\nAn illness that seems to particularly trouble Antonioni is that of love, or rather the impossibility of love in a modernized world and the emotional barriers that compromised real human communication. The so called trilogy of decadence, also known as the trilogy of emotional illness, centres around these issues. In “L’Avventura”, the first film of the trilogy, the character that seems to be the protagonist disappears after around 25 minutes; it then seems like the film will turn into a mystery, as her friends and family set out to find her. Yet, her fianceé and best friend start growing closer to each other, and soon find themselves falling in love with each other, against all social norm or expectation. However, even if the ghost of their friend and once beloved seems to have disappeared, real life compromised their relationship quickly. Daniel’s own vices, namely infidelity, and Claudia’s inability to connect doom the relationship. Yet by the end, as she discovers his infidelities, she session for the weak man that he is, and is ready to comfort him, perhaps not forgive him, but she understands him, perhaps for the first time in the whole film and their whole relationship. This pattern is repeated in the next two films of the trilogy, particularly in “La Notte”, which is about a marriage coming to terms with their lack of love; “L’Eclisse”, on the other hand, takes a different approach, but it becomes obvious by the end that it is plagued by the same illnesses.\n\nAntonioni likes to present his characters in a sort of uneven relation to their environment, they are slowly pulled away from the centre of their story (and world), sometimes even disappearing into its background. One could argue that humans are no longer the central points of perception in his films, as if he tried to remove himself from a type of storytelling that he considered to be “too anthropocentric”. The perfect example of this would be the ending of “L’Eclisse”: after growing closer and closer finally Monica Vitti’s and Alain Delon’s characters begin a relationship; it all seems happy and well, until Vitti leaves the apartment and is suddenly overcome by a wave of unexplained melancholy; what follows is an about five minute long sequence in which the camera just moved around, like a flaneur in an unknown city looking for distractions, and it ends on a close up of a street lamp, perhaps an allusion to the title eclipse that never truly materializes in a literal sense. In short, for a second the human drama appears to be resolved, but all of a sudden a new emotional element is added into the formula, yet this is never explained, the camera is not interested in this couple’s story anymore and it just wanders off, as an omniscient entity with a life of its own. Another example of this, though perhaps not as obvious, can be found in the previous film in the trilogy, “La Notte”: the film begins with the camera flying down into the city of ____ and, almost by accident, it notices and latches itself into our main characters, played by Marcello Mastroiani and Jeanne Moreau; and by the end, exactly as in the beginning, the camera decided to move away from the characters, as if it consideres that their story is not worth focusing on from that point onwards. In a certain sense, even if Antonioni didn’t engage as much in meta-reflexive filmmaking as much as other directors of the time, he did place the filmic medium itself at the centre of perception in the worlds he developed.\n\nIf he’s not moving away from his characters’ subjective perspectives, he is instead calling them into question. We can see this with the example of the 1964 film “Il Desserto Rosso”.In Antonioni’s first ever colour film, Monica Vitti plays a woman who isn’t particularly emotionally not psychologically stable. The director himself has described her as if she were at the border of neurosis. She lived in a world that is being contaminated by aggressive industrial expansion (it is worth noting that back in the 60d there was little talk about climate change), and she becomes progressively all the more alienated, it seems like every time she’s about to make a human connection the sound of a boat or a plane interrupts this. This being Antonioni’s first colour film he places special consideration to its composition: it appears that the colours of the world are influenced by Giuliana’s emotional state. When she feels alone or even threatened the water turns greenish, when she’s afraid the screen is filled with white steam, when she’s lustful the house in which she’s in is red, and then right after making love her room turns pinkish. All the time the film is externalizing her subjective perspective, so the world that we are seeing is called into question. Yet, it appears that she’s the only one who can see that there’s something wrong with the world, even if what she sees is the product of her neurosis, the other characters are oblivious to the contamination that surrounds them. Perhaps what Antonioni is trying to say is that even in her compromised state of mind, the one person who can see what’s wrong is the one that most people wouldn’t describe as “mentally sane”.\n\nAnother instance of the director questioning its characters’ perspectives is at the end of “Blow Up”, as Michael Powell’s character meets the group of mines who proceed to have an imaginary tennis match. When the “ball” “flies off”, the mines signal him to go fetch it; at first apprehensive, he then gives in to their request and “throws it” back at them. A lot has been written about this scene, with perhaps the general consensus being that this signifies how Thomas accepts the absurdity of his reality. Beyond this, an aspect that needs to be addressed is at the sound level: as the mines play, we (and most likely Thomas himself) hear the invisible ball bouncing and being hit by imaginary rackets. “Blow Up” is a film that constantly questions its and it’s character’s reality: did Thomas really capture the murder with its camera? What happens to the body, even as Thomas has found it but it’s later gone? Nevertheless, this is no murder mystery, what it’s all about is actually how reality is constructed through images – think about one of the tenders (and best) scenes in the movie, as Thomas slowly reconstructs the chronology of the events that day at the park and how he comes to the conclusion that foul play may be at hand.\n\nWith “Zabriskie Point”, a film that came to be after MGM offered him to come to the United States and make a movie in complete freedom, Antonioni drew inspiration from the political climate at the time: student protests, the civil rights movement, a growing corporate world, the militant black panthers, the sexual revolution… All examples of social tensions that defined the USA in the late 60d and early 70s. It’s two protagonists come from two extremes of this world: Mark fro the counterculture context, Daria from the hyper capitalistic world of corporations. Both are sick of their respective realities, so they run off to the desert, where they meet each other, and set their minds to begin anew. A film that was controversially received for its depiction of American society (particularly by American critics), it goes a little further than the presentation of stereotypes (like some would describe it), but instead it aims to reject the extremes that were testing the country apart at the time. And by the end, in what is perhaps Antonioni’s most direct sequence, Daria fantasizes of her boss’s villa exploding, with all his expensive material possessions flying up to the air in flames, to the explosive soundtrack of Pink Floyd’s music. To some degree it appears that Antonioni has taken a side in this eternal conflict between capitalism and counterculture, yet there’s a small detail that begs to be mentioned: we also see several books and book stands go up in flames; Antonioni, the imtellectual, let’s books burn. So perhaps it isn’t about making capitalism explode, but rather the negation through destruction of a (materialistic) culture that has allowed illnesses such as all the tensions that ravaged the land to arise.\n\nIn the final film we’ll discuss today, “The Passenger” starring Jack Nicholson as David Locke, a reporter goes down to Chad to make a documentary of the civil war going on. He befriends a weapon’s dealer, who soon dies, so he assumes his identity. The scene of his decision and process is particularly interesting, since its shot in a characteristic long shot by Antonioni, yet it takes place on two time planes, as we see at the same time how Locke and his friend Robertson talk all the while Locke is stealing Robertson’s identity after the man’s death, as if Antonioni were calling to question the nature of cinematic time. Locke may claim that he’s there to discover the truth of the civil war, but he seems more lost than anything: he’s going through an existential and an identity crisis, and the sense of purpose that he gives himself is merely a distraction away from his inner conflicts. Early in the film we see another example of what we discussed earlier, as his truck breaks down in the middle of the desert and frustrated he yells at the skies, and in that moment the camera wanders off, but there’s nothing to be seen, just more desert. It is as if its showing how insignificant this man and his frustrations truly are, as if to watch him struggle within his own insignificance is just too hard to take. This moving camera technique has become a signature move for Antonioni, but I would argue that it never speaks as loudly and as melancholically as in this scene from “The Passenger”.\n\nWhether adressing the failures in communication in a love relationship, or the mental state of a woman and her neurosis in a rotting world, or a man questioning the nature of reality after thinking he’s discovered a murder, or the struggles of two extreme poles in a highly politicized, or the existential crisis of a man who steals a new identity even if it costs him his life, Antonioni’s diagnosis of modern society is not a positive one. He found his origins in the neorealist movement, but after a period of trials he decided to move away from the class struggles and delve deeper in the human condition. And yet, as his style and themes developed, it appears that he also tried to move away from this human centric precondition of cinema, letting his camera move along what the world around us may offer. Whether he entirely succeeded is up for debate, but there’s no denying that aesthetically he mastered cinematic language like few others, and thematically his analysis of the illnesses of modernity were on point and still resonate today.\n\nSources and Further Reading:\n\nPeter Brunette: “The Films of Michelangelo Antonioni”\n\nSeymour Chapman: “Antonioni or the Surface of the World”\n\nPeter Bondanella: “Italian Cinema.

Its been a while since I last posted, life has been getting a little too busy lately, and also I’ve been working on this piece for some time now and I wanted to get it right. There’s some news on the production side of things, been working on a documentary about a local street art festival and hopefully we’ll be able to release the video soon, but perhaps that’s better left for another post.

Until next time!\n\nIts been over a year since I tackled the arguably 20 Best Science Fiction Films of All Time, so perhaps its a very good time to revisit the genre and talk about the best that the present century has to offer. Being a genre that intrinsically works thematically with human’s relationship to technology, as our own technological development continues to grow so does our understanding of our relationship towards it, as well as our own fears and desires with regards to it. Also, the evolution of science and our comprehension of the universe as a whole and our place within it brings up a series of complicated questions that genre has widely speculated about. For the last two decades science fiction cinema has delved into many of these issues, and many others as well relevant to our present day. Let’s take a look at what could very well be the 10 best science fiction films this 21st century has to offer.\n\nHonourable mentions: “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence” (Steven Spielberg, 2001), “Donnie Darko” (Richard Kelly, 2001), “Minority Report” (Steven Spielberg, 2002), “Time of the Wolf” (Michael Haneke, 2003), “Serenity” (Joss Whedon, 2005), “A Scanner Darkly” (Richard Linklater, 2006), “Man from Earth” (Richard Schenkman, 2007), “Wall-E” (Andrew Stanton, 2008) “The Road” (John Hillcoat, 2009), “Inception” (Christopher Nolan, 2010), “Planet of the Apes” reboot (Ruppert Wyatt – Matt Reeves, 2011 – 2017), “Looper” (Rian Johnson, 2012), “Cloud Atlas” (Wachowskis – Tom Tykwer, 2012), “Upstream Color” (Shane Garruth, 2013), “The World’s End” (Edgar Wright, 2013), “Snowpiercer” (Bong Joon-ho, 2013) “Interstellar” (Christopher Nolan, 2014), “Mad Max: Fury Road” (George Miller, 2015), “Blade Runner 2049” (Dennis Villeneuve, 2017), “Annihilation” (Alex Garland, 2018)\n\n10. Hard to be a God (Aleksei German, 2013)\n\nKicking off the list we have a russian black-and-white film based on a novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (the writers behind the story that inspired Tarkovsky’s “Stalker”), directed by the late Alekei German. Bleak and very brutal, the film tells of a group of Earth scientists that travel to a planet similar to our own with the difference that they are perpetually stuck in the middle ages. The population has prevented the rise of the rennaissance by brutally murdering anyone with intellectual leanings. The plot is hard to follow on first viewing, but the stark cinematography creates a unique visual style that, coupled with a bleak yet thought-provoking narrative, make for a very unforgettable viewing experience.\n\n9. District 9 (Neil Blomkamp, 2009)\n\nA film that utilizes its allegorical nature to touch on real world issues like racism and Apartheid. Set in Johannesburg, where 30 years prior an alien spacecraft landed carrying several malnourished extraterrestrials, who are then relocated by the South African governement to an area known as District 9, a slum where unrest and tensions towards the alien population will grow over the years. The protagonist is Wikus (played by an excellent Sharlto Copley), who during a search of an alien home accidentally sprays himself with a mysterious substance that slowly starts turning his biology into that of the aliens. For a film released about a decade ago the visuals hold up today surprisingly well, Blomkamp’s direction is excellent from start to finish and the social commentary, while not really that subtle, remains sharp and relevant even today.\n\n8. Arrival (Dennis Villeneuve, 2016)\n\nDennis Villeneuve’s 2016 “Arrival” gives a unique spin to the classic genre. In the film twelve mysterious spacecrafts arrive on different points of the planet, but the aliens aren’t here to conquer or wage war against humanity, they are here to open a communication channel. Of course, to communicate with an alien species with their own understanding of language is not going to be easy, so the U.S. army employs linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to try to overcome this language barrier. The film tackles a variety of complex topics such as language, human communication and the nature of time. Villeneuve shows off his expertise as a director and storyteller, developing new aisles in a genre that he handles with utmost respect.\n\n7. Her (Spike Jonze, 2013)\n\nSpike Jonze’s “Her” is a love story for the technological era. It follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely man who works writing letters of personal nature for people who find this difficult and is in the middle getting divorced from his wife (Rooney Mara). He installs an AI that names itself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johanson), which has the ability to develop emotionally and psychologically. After bonding and finding in Samantha a connection that he seldom finds in other people, Theodore soon falls in love with his AI and the two start a relationship. This is a film that delves into human emotions and interpersonal relationships, about the loneliness and isolation of an ever changing world, anchored by an excellent performance by Phoenix and great voice talent by Johannson.\n\n6. Moon (Duncan Jones, 2009)\n\nBack in 2009, Duncan Jones’ feature debut “Moon” made somewhat of a splash within the sci fi community. It follows Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), an astronaut on a three year mission by himself on the moon to mine an alternative source of fuel due to fuel scarcity back on Earth. After suffering an accident on an expedition, he discovers that he might not be totally alone as first thought, revealing a dark secret of the company for which he works for. This is a great movie all around: the cinematography is great, the set design is amazing, and Sam Rockwell’s central performance deserves a lot more credit than what it actually gets. Dealing with issues of identity and morality, Duncan Jones’ first film announced him to the world as a very talented filmmaker… a bar that, sadly, he perhaps set too high for himself.\n\n5. Primer (Shane Garruth, 2004)\n\nPerhaps the most complicated time travel film to ever be made, “Primer” is an extremely low budget film written, directed by and starring Shane Garruth, a former engineer, who used his scientific knowledge to craft the very well tought out and highly complex mechanics of time travel. It follows two friends and colleagues, both engineers, who by working on their own scientific experiments accidentally discover – or rather invent – a time loop scenario that allows them to travel six hours into the past, while their past selves still exist during this time period. Like stated before, the mechanics are very complicated, and Garruth never dumbs down the scientific terms for the audience’s benefit, so this might be a frustrating watch for some viewers, but it can be highly rewarding by paying close attention and multiple viewings.\n\n4. Under the Skin (Jonathan Glazer, 2013)\n\nA low budget scottish production consisting of the simple premise of Scarlett Johanson playing a mysterious alien woman who drives around Glasgow picking up men, takes them back home to apparently sleep with them, what in fact turns out to be a sort of predatory practice. The film may not be big on visual effects or high concept storytelling (though there are some visually striking sequences in there), but it does delve deep into classic sci fi themes such as the question of what it means to be human through an art house lense. Johanson’s performance is very subdued and even tender, her character far from a simple alien monster, is instead a nuanced and complex being that undergoes one of the most interesting developments for a non-human character within the genre.\n\n3. Children of Men (Alfonso Cuarón, 2006)\n\nDystopian science fiction as bleak as it gets, though its not devoid of a glimmer of hope. In the year 2027 humanity has become infertile, what has lead to a collapse of most global economies, with the UK being the last one standing. An influx of refugees has been pouring into the country. Theo (Clive Owen) is contacted by former wife Julian (Julianne Moore) so he helps a young refugee named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitee), who just may carry humanity’s last hope in the face of its impending extinction. This is still arguably Cuarón’s masterpiece, an intelligently crafted sci fi thriller, shot through the director’s and Lubezki’s characteristic impressive long takes, and featuring what could be Clive Owen’s best performance. Cuarón presents a very harsh picture of what could be humanity’s future in one of the century’s best efforts in the genre.\n\n2. Ex Machina (Alex Garland, 2015)\n\nAlex Garland’s take on Artificial Intelligence is one for the ages. The film follows Caleb (Domhall Glesoon), a programmer who wins an office contest to visit the isolated house of Nathan (Oscar Isaac), the CEO of the company he works for. Nathan has been working on an AI called Ava (Alicia Vikander), and Caleb is there to make a Turing test on her, meaning he has to determine if she could pass as a human or not. Like many other sci fi classics before, “Ex Machina” tackles themes of humanity’s relationship with technology and what it means to be a human being, delving into actual discussions regarding topics of consciousness and artificial intelligence. All the while Garland creates a compelling and thrilling narrative anchored by the dynamic between its three main players, building to a climax that guaranteed won’t be easy to forget.\n\n1. Melancholia (Lars von Trier, 2011)\n\nPerhaps not a traditional science fiction film, in that it doesn’t concern futuristic technologies or beings from another world. Instead, Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia” tells an end of the world story but told in a very small scope. It tells the story of two sisters, Justine (Kirsten Dunst), who in the middle of her wedding party suffers a depressive episode, and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who sees herself as responsible to care for her sister in this state. All the while, Melancholia, a newly discovered rogue planet, approaches the Earth. For large portions of the movie, “Melancholia” plays more like a psycho-drama than a sci fi ordeal, yet as the impending disaster looms we are treated to classic genre themes like humanity’s reaction on the face of their inevitable doom. Boasting excellent performances by Dunst and Gainsbourg, and shot with the director’s highly stylized visual flair, Von Trier crafts what is definitely one of the best films of the present century (and of his career), let alone the science fiction genre.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it.

Until next time!\n\nIt is finally here: the culmination of 11 years worth of storytelling, action, crossovers and the rewriting of the superhero film lanscape as we know it today. After last year’s Infinity War the Russo brothers had a lot to live up to. Did they manage it? Were they able to make a satisfying continuation to what was probably the most daring film Marvel had ever made, while at the same time delivering on the promise that this would be the final installment in an 11-year saga? Was all the wait and hype and set ups worth it? Well, there are several ways to answer those questions, but I’m gonna go with a somewhat reserved yes. As someone pointed out in another review, this film cannot be viewed as a stand alone piece, instead it has to be considered in context with “Infinity War”, and well, there’s lots that can be said about that, so let’s get started, shall we? But first of all, I’m issuing here a spoiler warning for those of you who haven’t seen the movie and want to go in as in the dark as possible, so proceed with caution.\n\nOkay, so “Endgame” takes place almost immediately after the last film left off: Thanos completed his quest for the Infinity Stones and effectively wiped out half of life in the universe. The Avengers failed to stop him and now they have to deal with the consequences of their failure. Tony Stark is stranded in space with Nebula, until they’re rescued by Captain Marvel, who brings them to Earth to Rendezvous with the rest of the survivors. They’ve been tracking Thanos for a little while now, so they device a plan to go after him and get the stones from him, yet he reveals he destroyed the stones so no one could undo his work. Flashforward five years into the future and Ant-Man finally manages to get out of the Quantum realm (where he was stranded at the end of “Ant-Man and the Wasp”) and he comes up with a plan that could actually undo Thanos’ snap. So the team of now broken heroes team up one final time to bring everybody back from the dead.\n\nI firmly believe that the reason why “Infinity War” worked so well was because the Russos realized that what needed to be done was to shift the focus towards the antagonist of the movie and make it all about him, his quest, his arc, etc. With all the different characters running around and so many heroes and protagonists vying for the spotlight, they correctly realized that the film needed to be all about Thanos. That’s why it got to be so daring and compelling, it was after all part one of a two part series, what allowed them the freedom to go all out on their crazy ideas. Of course, with “Endgame” being part two of two this time they couldn’t get away with the villain winning and everybody dying in one of the most shocking scenes in mainstream superhero cinema. That means that in order to live up to the expectations they themselves created by lying the focus on their villain they had to come up with a different approach that didn’t put the villain at the center of it all. Nevertheless, before it being a sequel to “Infinity War” it is first and foremost an Avengers film, a sequel to every other film the franchise has produced up until this point, so the answer to the conundrum was actually quite simple: make it all about the Avengers themselves and their adventures through the years.\n\nI’ve gotta say that I wasn’t too pleased at first with the introduction of time travel into the MCU (other franchises do tend to get unecessarily muddled and convoluted when this device comes into play), and even more so when it was clear that they were basically going into their own past movies to retrieve the stones in the past. A little alarm was raised at the back of my head when it became obvious that they were going for the nostalgia trip, but fortunately it wasn’t as bad as I expected it. The scenes in the past (which includes them travelling to the original “Avengers”, to the first “Guardians of the Galaxy”, to “Thor: Dark World”, and even to “Infinity War” you may argue, with other callbacks to “Doctor Strange” and “Winter Soldier”) weren’t as self-indulgent as I expected, they showed a very interesting and sometimes subversive side to classic MCU scenes, added a good amount of humour and they didn’t overstay its welcome. It was fan-service, sure, but at least it was done right, and considering this was the culmination of such a huge saga, I guess its justified to revisit some of its biggest hits. Plus I’ve gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Tilda Swinton in her role as the ancient one once again, thought I’d never see her again like that.\n\nBack to the characters, Thanos aside this film does a better job than its predecessor with its character work. Whereas in “Infinity War” there were som many moving pieces to juggle to the point that some characters were sidelined and don’t undergo through any arc whatsoever or this is just minimal (Cap and Black Widow included), in this film because for the most part the cast was mainly reduced to the core players, the characters do end up getting the resolutions they deserved. Iron Man’s final sacrifice fits perfectly with his arc that started way back in 2008 with the first MCU film, and Captain America going back in time to grow old with Peggy Carter was very touching and a closure that the character did earn. While in the previous Avengers film Black Widow was just kind of there, here we do see her struggling with the aftermath and the feeling of responsibility she gets towards herself and the rest of the heroes, so when she finally sacfrifices herself you do get the feeling that her character work finally paid off after so many films where she played second roster to the main hero. Then there’s Hawkeye, who’s had a huge transformation since we last saw him, now a vengeful shadowy figure after the loss of his family, he gets his redemption and his much deserved happy ending. Bruce Banner has finally learned how to coexist with the Hulk, an interesting concept that produced lots of funny moments, though I did feel like he was sidelined after he himself undid the snap. And then there’s Thor, a character that’s been thorugh quite a lot in the past couple of films, now turned into an alcoholic sporting a beer belly dealing with PTSD (which was mostly played for laughs, something that undermines the great potential of his development frankly), who at the end goes off with the Guardians to explore the galaxy. While I loved what they did with Thor in this film and the idea of him and the Guardians getting into all sorts of whacky adventures is too good to resist, by the end as he renounces the rule of Asgard it kind of feels like the Russos going back on his development from “Ragnarok”, but hey, we still got lots of golden moments from him.\n\nIt goes without saying that this film was visually and technically stunning, and of course the final battle was huge, breathtaking and epic in scale. Everybody gets to show off their powers and there are many realy great moments during the climax (Cap raising Thor’s hammer anyone?). Yet, beyond all the flashy spectacle one does get the sense to be in a Marvel climax, and that means one where the stakes aren’t that high. Whereas in the finaly battle in “Infinity War” the urgency was real and you didn’t really know what was going to happen, here it ultimately feels like the battles in the original “Avengers” or “Age of Ultron” on a much bigger scale: it may look hairy for our protagonists, but we all know the heroes are gonna win in the end. Though to be fair how they framed that victory was very well done and serves a feeling of poetic justice. Then there’s that moment that apparently has been somewhat controversial, the Ladies of Marvel scene: Captain Marvel takes the gauntlet from Peter Parker, who asks her how she’ll be able to take it way across the battlefield alone, to which Okoye replies “she’s not alone” and then every single living female marvel hero shows up in the same shot displaying their powers. While there’s nothing intrinsically wrong here I’ve got a couple of issues with this scene: first of all, it is blatantly obvious what they’re trying to do, Disney pushing their liberal agenda again, and while I do believe that more female heroes are needed in mainstream superhero cinema, they could at least try to make it more subtle; my biggest issue here, however, is that this is clearly a case of a shot that looks cool but doesn’t really makes sense narratively: its as if every single female hero was just standing around near that place, waiting for their cue to show up and show how awesome they are. Lets not forget there’s a huge battle going on at the moment, it would be impossible that geographically they’d be so near to each other and that none of them would be engaged in some sort of combat or task in that exact same moment. Anyway, its just that one scene, but I’m already seeing lots of people (mainly males) who find this particularly troubling\n\nThere are tons of great moments in the film: from Tony Stark meeting his father in the past to Captain America fighting himself, Hawkeye’s and Black Widow’s trip to Vormir, the arrival of all the resurrected heroes to the battlefield reminiscent to Gandalf showing up with the Rohirim in “Lord of the Rings”, and who could forget Korg’s cameo as he plays fortnite, there’s a lot to be treasured by Marvel fans. There’s something that “Endgame” offers its followers that none other MCU film had done before, and that’s a sense of closure. Its been 11 years full of ups and downs, great heroes, some great villain and others not so great. In those 11 years they’ve made billions at the box office and have perfected a winning formula that puts them on the top of Hollywood filmmaking. While the MCU will go on, with the Disney-Fox merger on the horizon enabling to get back most of their beloved properties, there’s a real sense that this is the end of an era, accentuated by the fact that there was no post credit scene (though when you remember that “Spider Man: Far from home” is coming in about three months all that gets undone). I think I kind of like “Infinity War” better just because it was so unexpected, but there’s no denying that “Endgame” is the perfect farewell to all these great characters and this era defined by the Juggernaut that Marvel Studios has become.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it. I haven’t been able to write and post as much recently, frankly time is getting ever more limited and demanding, I’m entering my final year at the university now so that means there’s gonna be less and less chances to write just for fun. I’ve considered giving blogging up, but there are still other stuff that I’d like to talk about before closing this chapter, so I think I’ll be doing this for at least until next year, though it will certainly be less often than it has been so far. I’ve also considered expanding my repertoire and talking about other stuff besides film (though that would still be my main focus), but I’m still not sure how to go about that, so I don’t know just yet. Anyway, if you liked this review it would be great if you shared it with your friends and family and other Marvel fans that might enjoy it, and if you want to keep up to date with this blog hit that follow button. Until next time!\n\nI’ve finally gotten around to watching last year’s “At Eternity’s Gate”, directed by Julian Schnabel and starring Willem Dafoe in an Academy Award nominated role as Vincent Van Gogh. While it is a biographical film, it doesn’t follow the structure and conventions of your average Hollywood biopic, something that’s really refreshing. While watching the film I couldn’t help but compare it to another recent van Gogh biopic (for obvious reasons), 2017’s animated feature “Loving Vincent”, which gained prominensce through its reputation of being the first 100% fully oil painted feature film. I am no van Gogh expert, I only know about the man the little information I learned back in school and what both these films have told me (you may add the “Crows” segment in Kurosawa’s “Dreams”, were the artist was played by Martin Scorsese), yet today I wanna do something that I don’t usually do on this blog: a direct comparison between both pictures. Like I said, I’m no expert on the subject matter, so I won’t be basing my comparison on historical facts, but rather on how both films approach its topic and how they go about telling its story.\n\nBoth films recount the final period of Van Gogh’s life, yet each has its particular way to tackle the subject: “Loving Vincent” tells the story from the point of view of Armand Roulin, son of postman Joseph Roulin (who was inmortalized by Vincent himself through the famous Portrait of Postman Joseph Roulin), as he delivers the last letter ever written by Van Gogh to his brother Theo. After coming to the conclusion that the events surrounding his suicide are suspicious, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise and meets several people who were in contact with Vincent in order to clear his questions about the painter’s death. On the other hand we have “At Eternity’s Gate”, a film that assumes Van Gogh’s first person perspective and recounts the last couple of years of the painter’s life, but more than just putting forward a retelling of the events in question, the film goes out of its way to actually understand and recreate Van Gogh’s inner world and personal turmoil.\n\nLet’s talk about “Loving Vincent” for a while now. The project was helmed by Dorota Kobiela, herself a painter and Hugh Welchman, an Academy Award winning filmmaker of short films up until this point. There’s no denying that this picture is a huge technical achievement. The film takes Van Gogh’s style and brings it to life through a combination of “traditional” animation (in the sense that its hand drawn, yet it is actually not done by animators but by oil painters who know the craft of the man in question), and rotoscope, by which actors get to perform through motion capture. This is no easy feat and such technical mastery shouldn’t be overlooked. Nevertheless, on the storytelling front the film is to be found lacking. It is interesting how they pose Vincent Van Gogh as this mysterious figure that no one really understood, yet the film’s narrative is completely held by this mystery and the one surrounding his death. This in and of itself isn’t a bad thing, but this is problematic when that’s the only interesting aspect of your movie. See, Van Gogh is ultimately reduced to a simple plot device, even when it is his story the one that’s being told. The main character, played by Douglas Booth, is ultimately plain and boring and isn’t engaging at all (one might argue that he doesn’t have to be, since its Vincent’s story, but Armand lies at the centre of the picture, they should try to make him interesting at least). Then there’s all the supporting characters, more than a couple of which are more interesting than Armand, and that surely is a sign of trouble. You’ve got all these scenes with these different characters as they start to remember and tell about their anecdotes with Vincent, a clever way of framing the film’s story, but each time the technique feels less as an adequate framing device and more like a gimmick. Ultimately, the film is focused way more on retelling the events of Van Gogh’s last few months than truly make an attempt in understanding the man. There’s one line, spoken by Marguerite Gachet played by Saoirse Ronan, that somewhat tragically diagnoses the film’s own flaws: “You want to know so much about his death. What do you know of his life?”\n\nIn contrast you have Schnabel’s “At Eternity’s Gate”. On the technical level, beyond some experimental camera work, there isn’t much that can be called revolutionary, unlike “Loving Vincent”‘s animation approach. It is live-action and it decides to tell its story chronologically, and yet it feels much more like an art film than one that employs non-linear storytelling and experimental animation. The reason to this is quite simple, yet it makes all the difference: “At Eternity’s Gate” is character driven, whereas “Loving Vincent” is plot driven. Schnabel’s film assumes Van Gogh’s first person perspective and runs away with it. Willem Dafoe’s performance has to be mentioned, because this is one of those films that lives and dies with its main actor’s role. While the fact that Dafoe, aged 63, plays a man who only lived until age 37 can be a little distracting at times, the man truly embodies the existential anguish that the legendary painter experienced. Schnabel builds his film around this and the results are incredible. There are long sequences of Van Gogh painting, of him just laying in the grass and feeling the moment, of him having prolongued discussions on art with Paul Gauguin (played by Oscar Isaacs), and yet it is so captivating and enthralling, it is precisely in those moments where “nothing significant” happens where the film’s beauty lies. Whereas “Loving Vincent” goes from plot beat to plot beat, “At Eternity’s Gate” really takes its time to capture the man’s inner world and, perhaps even more importantly, inner turmoil. There are a few scenes where Van Gogh is on the peak of his insanity, the camera assumes its point of view and the colour grading is yellowish and extremely saturated, something that may pass for a stylistic choice for that particular scene, yet when the camera shifts to another character’s perspective we see the world through a more normal lense. It might not be something big, but it is one example of how the film effectively approaches its subject matter that goes beyond a straight forward retelling of the man’s life events.\n\nNow, this piece may give the impression that I didn’t like “Loving Vincent”. I just wanna go out and say that that is definitely not the case: I really enjoyed the film for what it is, found the animation style to be completely breathtaking, and while I didn’t find the story nor the main characters to be that interesting as they could’ve been, I was actually entertained til the end. The thing is, the film isn’t as great as it should have been, I wasn’t even too compelled to write about it until I saw “At Eternity’s Gate”, which is by far the superior film. I once said on my review on The Color of Pomegranates that a biopic shouldn’t just be a retelling of the subject’s life, but instead it should try and recreate the person in question’s reality. Perhaps it is curious that the film that achieved this wasn’t the one that visually recreates Van Gogh’s paintings, instead it was the live-action one that tells its story in chronological order. Like I said, I’m no expert on the legendary artist’s life and work, so I can’t tell you which one is the more accurate. I can only tell you which one was the one I liked the most, and for the reasons exposed in this piece it was definitely “At Eternity’s Gate”.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it.

Until next time!\n\nTraditionally, the western genre has presented a romanticized image of a particular time period in north american history. The frontier society, somewhere between mid and late 1800s, has been portrayed as the basis of contemporary north american civilization, a place where values like honour, loyalty and justice go a long way. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that this depictions of the old west couldn’t be further from the truth. During the 60s and 70s, in the midst of great social unrest and political turmoil, a new subgenre of Western arised, which would shed a light and put into question all the myths and legends that the classic westerns of old championed. This current would be known as the revisionist western, also known as late or even anti-western (I previously touched upon this subject in my essay On Classic, Anti and Neo Westerns). Whereas previously the heroes and villains were easily distinguishable and traditional values and individualism always thrived over unfairness and cinicism, now the wild west is painted in a much more ambiguous light. With all this in mind, let’s take a look at ten examples of this category and their revisionist aspects. Note: I’m only including american revisionist westerns, that means that Spaguetti/Italo Westerns such as the ones from Leone and Corbucci don’t really qualify, not because they aren’t revisionistic in their own right (they are and very much so), but because I’m interested in the american perspective towards their own history and legends for this piece.\n\n10. High Plains Drifter (Clint Eastwood, 1973)\n\nA film that puts a spin on the classic western plot of a stranger riding into town and joining forces with the townspeople to stop a band of bandits. Its directed by and stars Clint Eastwood as the mysterious drifter, who the people of the town see as their only salvation. Yet, it soon becomes clear that Eastwood’s character is no saint, his actions are far from righteous and he’s driven by a twisted sense of revenge. Eastwood causes more trouble instead of solving it, and the film really shows how this trope of the stoic stranger coming to save the town hides a huge amount of egoism. While the film does ask a little too much of our suspension of disbelief, it is a very well crafted picture and its revisionism hits the nail on the head.\n\n9. Blazing Saddles (Mel Brooks, 1974)\n\nThe one film on this list that’s actually light-hearted and a comedy in essence, it doesn’t openly criticize depictions of the old west as much as it satirizes them. It stars Cleavon Little as Bart, the very first black sheriff in the town of Rock Ridge, and Gene Wilder as Jim, also known as the Waco Kid, the only person in town who accepts him initially. The pair go through lots of over the top adventures and ultimately have to stop the attorney general, who plans to destroy the town so a railroad can be built. This film really fits into the postmodern tradition, constantly engaging in meta humour and breaking every fourth wall in sight. Its revisionism stems from the limited portrayal of black communities in classic westerns, an issue they handled with great charm and wacky situations.\n\n8. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (George Roy Hill, 1969)\n\nPaul Newman and Robert Redford star as the infamous outlaw pair Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, a.k.a. the Sundance Kid, a couple of criminals on the run from the law after a series of train robberies. The two title characters are legends of the west, so the film goes on to deconstruct what makes them legends in the first place. They are supposed to be celebrated gunmen, yet they reject gun violence. When engaged in duels they resort to trickery and conniving, methods that in the classic westerns of old would be considered as dishonourable. Then there’s the famous “Raindrops” scene, which shows a very innocent side to two supposedly hardened criminals. In a very anti-western fashion, the outlaws become the heroes and the law is the corrupt villain.\n\n7. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (Sam Peckinpah, 1973)\n\nIn the first and certainly not the last film directed by Sam Peckinpah you’ll see on this list, James Coburn stars as Pat Garrett, the sheriff of Lincoln County, who is assigned to track down his old friend Billy the Kid, played by Kris Kristofferson. The conflict between these two men and their ideologies lie in the center of the film, and through this we see a very gritty and cruel wild west, where ideals like friendship and loyalty are rendered irrelevant through a corrupt legal system. The amazing soundtrack was composed by Bob Dylan, who also stars in the film as a member of the Kid’s gang, yet, while the scene featuring “Knocking on Heaven’s Door” is one of the most iconic scenes in film history, seeing Dylan in the film was kind of distracting and it broke with the immersion, his character doesn’t add much to the story and I think he’s better off as a musician as an actor. However, this shouldn’t detract from the film’s overall quality and its thought provoking material.\n\n6. The Assasination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (Andrew Dominik, 2007)\n\nCertainly the newest film on this list, you might think that the title reveals everything you need to know about this film, but in truth the story is so rich and nuanced that you have to pay close attention to grasp everything that’s going on. Brad Pitt stars as outlaw Jesse James and Cassey Affleck stars as Robert Ford, a young man whose obsession with the western hero turns deadly. The film is a slow burn, one of the slowest for a western film, yet by the end it becomes clear that Jesse James was not the Robin Hood-type of hero he is made out to be, and Robert Ford is not a coward by any means. A huge staple of the revisionist western subgenre is the deconstruction of legends, and even if this film came out way after the initial wave of anti-westerns, it certainly fits the bill.\n\n5. Ride the High Country (Sam Peckinpah, 1962)\n\nA film that can be considered somewhat of an early late-western, this was one of Peckinpah’s first incursions into wild west territory. While aesthetically it differs to most of the later films that fall into this category, thematically it would pioneer many of the issues that would be explored in later years. It tells the story Steve Judd (Joel McCrea), an ex-lawman, Gil Westrum (Randolph Scott), a once legendary sharpshooter, and Heck Longtree (Ron Starr), Gil’s young apprentice, as they are hired to carry a shipment of gold through the mountains. Along the way they meet a young girl named Elsa (Mariette Hartley), run into trouble and incur into moral debates as to what they should do with the gold. Beyond its portrayal of morally ambiguous heroes, the film tackles a subject characteristic of the late-western: that of aging heroes that cannot cope with the new state of the world.\n\n4. Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992)\n\nClint Eastwood’s second entry in this list and probably the greatest western he ever directed. Eastwood stars as Will Munny, an aging former outlaw who takes on a last job to earn a huge amount of money. He’s assisted by Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and they’ll cross paths more than once with sadistic sheriff “Little” Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). As with the previous entry, this film deals with an aging western “hero” that struggles to come to terms with the current state of the west. Munny isn’t a fast shooter, his hands are shaky and struggles to mount a horse, thus is the idea of the gunslinger (popularized by Eastwood himself) demystified. The main representative of the law in the film is Daggett, a psychopathic figure that’s nonetheless a god-fearing citizen. Logan is a pacifist and doesn’t revel in violence. The film takes a number of classic western tropes and ideals and subverts them, painting a much more grounded picture that the ones we may find in the westerns of the 40s and 50s.\n\n3. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962)\n\nThe case of this film is particularly interesting, since its directed by John Ford, the man who practically edified many of the tropes and conventions that revisionist westerns would seek to subvert and criticize. It tells the story of Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart), a senator who arrives at a frontier town which is being terrorized by bandit Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin); the only man who stands up to him is Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). After a reluctant start, both men will work together to bring Valance down. Much like the aforementioned “Ride the High Country”, this film might be best described as an early late-western: it plays out in a somewhat traditional fashion, yet by the end the central legend is demystified and, perhaps more importantly in its message, it presents in Stewart’s character the idea of a civilized society that works in accordance with a centralized form of government.\n\n2. McCabe and Mrs. Miller (Robert Altman, 1971)\n\nRobert Altman famously said once that he despised the western genre, so when he set out to make this film it was no surprise that it would run against all conventions. In the center of the movie is John McCabe (Warren Beatty), a gambler and self-described business man who comes to a frontier town to open a brothel. While his business is doing all right, he meets Constance Miller (Julie Christie), an experienced prostitute who teaches him more than a few things on how to run and expand his business. The pair starts doing pretty well, until a big mining company wants to buy them off. This is probably the film that differentiates itself the most from the rest: its not about outlaws and sheriffs, it doesn’t concern banks or train robberies, nor is it about legends and gunfighters. Instead, it is a film that talks about the economic state of America and how big businesses crush the little man. It is bleak and gritty, yet the cinematography is visually striking and Leonard Cohen’s soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. I firmly believe that only Altman could’ve pulled off a film like this.\n\n1. The Wild Bunch (Sam Peckinpah, 1969)\n\nPeckinpah’s masterpiece and a masterstroke in western revisionism, 1969’s “The Wild Bunch” concerns an aging group of outlaws, who are forced to flee to Mexico after a railroad robbery goes horribly wrong when a former member of the bunch sets them up. It deals with the classic theme of old heroes struggling with the modernized world that surrounds them and has ots to say about the modernization of western society. On one side of the frontier they face a corrupt railroad owner who wants them dead, a sign of the rising corruption in corporate America, and on the other side they face Mapache, a corrupt leader of the mexican army who also wants them dead, a sign of the corruption of institutions. Peckinpah’s aesthetic tackles violence in a very raw and sterilized fashion, putting into question the whole glorification of violence that the westerns of old championed as necessary for society’s progression. The bunch are relics of a much simpler past, yet they refuse to go down quietly and instead choose to fight against this new corrupt world order until their last breath. Aesthetically accomplished, narratively compelling and thematically very thoughtful, Peckinpah’s film is most likely the revisionist western par excellence.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it. I recently had to write a paper for university on the subject and learned lots of new perspectives on the matter. There’s certainly many other films that I’ve missed or that I haven’t seen, so feel free to leave your recommendations in the comments. Also, if there’s a good response I could do a similar list for Italowesterns in the future, so do tell me if you might be interested.

Until next time!\n\nIssues about memory, about reminiscence, about past loves and lost opportunities. A romance in the midst of a city that, less than fifteen years prior, layed completely destroyed. “Hiroshima, Mon Amour” was Alain Resnais feature film debut, with a screenplay written by Marguerite Duras. The film made a huge impact upon its release, winning the international film critics prize at Cannes in 1959, and (along with Truffaut’s “Les 400 Coups” and Marcel Camus’ “Orfeu Negro”) drew the world’s attention towards modern french cinema. A couple of months ago I talked about Resnais’ Last Year at Marienbad and how it fits Giles Deleuze’ definition of modernist filmmaking. “Hiroshima” also fits this label, but since I’ve already talked about this categorization I’m gonna focus today on other aspects of this beautiful piece of cinema.\n\nThe film finds a young french actress (Emmanuelle Riva) who, while in Hiroshima filming a movie, has started a brief relationship with a japanese architecht (Eiji Okada). It takes place during the course of the last 36 hours the actress is in Japan before flying back to Paris, and it concerns a series of conversations and retrospective instances between the two regarding their situation and the young woman’s past in particular. As it turns out, she once found love with a german soldier during the war, and after his death she has never been able to find a love similar to that one, until now. Even though she’s married, she finds herself in contact with feelings she thought lost so many years ago, and now that her departure from Hiroshima is nigh, she wonders if she’ll be able to come to terms with everything that has flourished during her time there.\n\nThis is a very poetical film. While the main premise seems simple enough, the execution and framing elevate it into something trascendental. Perhaps its too unsatisfying to try and find its roots in previous cinematic traditions (sure, today you can argue it belongs to the Left Bank/French New Wave concern, but such categorization arises way after its inception). Instead I’d argue that beyond any cinematic influence the film is more closely linked to literary tradition of stream-of-consciousness. Pioneered by the likes of James Joyce, Marcel Proust and Virgnia Woolf, this a literary device that seeks to mimic or capture the “essence” of human thinking: “a method of narration that describes happenings in the flow of thoughts in the minds of the characters.” (Literary Devices, https://literarydevices.net/stream-of-consciousness/). It isn’t supposed to show actual logical, organized thought processes, it should rather resemle the chaotic nature of having multiple thoughts at once competing for the spotlight. The film achieves this through its use of non-linear storytelling: we get flashbacks that last only a few frames, designed to evoke the most fleeting instance of memory; we get images of the destruction of Hiroshima after the bombing in 1945 while the characters talk about this, sometimes quick and hard to pin down, sometimes being the most graphic and heart-wrenching images the ones that endure the longest.\n\nWhile mainly a literary device, stream of consciousness is something that has been done in film more than a few times, particularly in the modernist current of the 60s and 70s (films like Tarkovsky’s “The Mirror”, Fellini’s “8 1/2” and Resnais own “Last Year at Marienbad” come to mind). Yet it can be argued that it is here that this technique is achieved to its greatest effect. I love the aforementioned films to death, but “Hiroshima” manages to capture the unique, chaotica and at times even exhausting complexities of human thought in a way that differentiates itself from the motion pictures above. Of course, human thinking cannot be completely reproduced by any medium, be it cinematic or literary, but when a piece of art comes close to it such achievement can’t simply be ignored.\n\nThis is a very dense film with lots to unpack. Beyond its poetry and lyricality, beyond any philosophical takeaway that can be had through an analysis of its portrayal of memory and desire, there’s a lot that can be said about the psychology of its characters, particularly of the french actress. During her stay in Hiroshima she begins an affair with a japanese man, something that seemed perhaps meaningless at the time, yet soon she finds herself reliving all the tormentous feelings she had about her deceased german lover. More than once Resnais overlaps images of the hands of both men, both carrying a striking resemblance to each other, implying that it was this tiny detail that made her fall in love with the japanese man. It is this idea that one aspect can reprsent the whole that throws Riva’s character into an existential spiral: she’s reliving the joy she felt from her first love, as well as the void that this loss left in her. At one point, seeing that he is about to lose her, the man tells her “I wish you died in Nevers” (her place of birth, where she lived her romance with the german soldier), to which she simply replies “I wish so too”. In what is probably the film’s most telling moment, the real reason of her plight is revealed: she regrets out living her first love, she can’t stand the fact that she had to live without him, and now, faced with a similar situation filled with lots of complex emotions she finds herself at a crossroad: wheather to go back to her life in Paris and live on, letting this affair eventually fall into oblivion, or to die then and there, as she wasn’t able to back in Nevers upon losing her first love.\n\n“Hiroshima, Mon Amour” is one hell of a cinematic experience. Resnais’ careful and poetical direction works in perfect unison with Duras’ beautiful screenplay about a romance that cuts deep into its characters. Through the use of a technique akin to modern literature’s stream of consciouseness, the film achieves something that is very hard to convey visually: to accurately recreate and evoke a character’s state of mind. While I’m not really sure if I can call this Resnais’ masterpiece (I do have a soft spot for “Marienbad”, one of my favourite films of all time), there is no denying the beauty and complexity to be found in his debut feature.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it. I recently attended a lecture about this film and the discussion centered around some of the topics I touch upon here, yet I’m pretty sure there are lots and lots of other possible interpretations and details to be unpacked I haven’t even mentioned. I’d be very interested in hearing your thoughts on this masterpiece, so please feel free to leave a comment telling me what you think.

Until next time!\n\nAward season is officially over. The Oscars already took place and they could’ve been the worst ones in recent memory. “Green Book” is probably the worst Best Picture winner since “Crash” (2005), and in the year in which “Bohemian Rhapsody” was the most lauded film with four wins, “The Favourite” received just one award for Best Actress and while “Roma”, did well, just remember that “Black Panther” received the same number of awards. Fortunately, people are starting to realize that the academy awards are just one big joke. Anyway, just like last year I’m putting together my own set of categories, nominees and winners and hopefully these will be fairer than the Oscars. Eligible films are only the ones I’ve watched, of course, and the categories can have either five nominees for technical and genre categories, or the more “dramatic” categories, namely acting, writing, directing and picture, can have ten nominees and three possible winners ranked from one to three.

I guess my bias towards Lanthimos’ film is pretty clear, but I do hope these are fairer to the cinematic year of 2018 as the Oscars. But what do you guys think? Would you have gone with completely different winners and nominees? Do leave a comment telling me you thoughts! Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed this. Until next time!"
