Some are discovering for the first time, as British Travel Journal readers have always known, that our beautiful countryside, sandy shores, spectacular landmarks and world-class hotels are far from a 'second choice' holiday option. Our latest issue - brimming with inspirational travel ideas from around our glorious island - should be enough to convince even the most hardened of international traveller, that a holiday in the British Isles won’t feel like a compromise. That’s why this year we’re offering a special discount on our ‘gift’ subscriptions for families and friends (use code AW20 to access a 15% discount), spreading the word, and hoping that this surge we are seeing in popularity for UK travel experiences will be here long after the virus has gone. Staying in the UK comes with many bonuses too, like not having to worry about what to do with beloved four-legged friend"
