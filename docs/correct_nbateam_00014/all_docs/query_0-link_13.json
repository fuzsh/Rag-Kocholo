        "text": "Former Chicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon could see his charges dropped for an incident in Stamford in 2023 that saw the onetime UConn star pull a knife on a juice shop employee after a disagreement, per recent reporting from the Stanford Advocate’s Pat Tomlinson.\n\nThe incident, one of a series of altercations marring the post-playing career for the former Chicago wing, was part of the reasoning behind Gordon getting himself into counseling. Gordon’s collegiate coach, Hall of Famer Jim Calhoun, revealed the decision to engage counseling after Gordon’s life took a sharp turn towards trouble in recent years.\n\n“From the moment I met Ben, I saw a passion and drive in him like no other,” wrote Calhoun. “On both a personal and professional level, I consider Ben to be an outstanding individual.”\n\nWe also learned the former Husky is back at UConn working to finish his degree.\n\n“People think that if you’re successful, if you earn some money, you don’t have problems,” said Gordon’s attorney, Darnell, Crosland. “But they do have problems, and he’s taking the steps to correct those problems.”"
