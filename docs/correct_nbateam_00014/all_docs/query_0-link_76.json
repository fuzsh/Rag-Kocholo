        "text": "Ben Gordon was a very talented player, who spent 11 seasons in the NBA playing for the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats and Orlando Magic.\n\nRecently, the former UConn star has been in the news for the wrong reasons.\n\nOn Saturday, TMZ reported that Gordon was arrested at a McDonald's for an altercation that took place with security guards.\n\nVia TMZ: \"TMZ Sports has learned ... 39-year-old Gordon was taken into custody around 3:30 AM on Friday. Chicago PD says the 2004 third-overall pick was being escorted out of the Mickey D's when he got physical.\n\nPolice say Gordon struck a 29-year-old male guard in the face and threw him to the ground ... before shoving a second 21-year-old male guard to the ground as well.\"\n\nGordon is currently 39 years old, and he last played in the league in 2015 for the Magic.\n\nThese are the most recent disturbing allegations that he's faced.\n\nLast month, the New York Post reported that he was arrested at LaGuardia airport for allegedly hitting his child.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Gordon made over $82 million during his career, and his biggest contract came when the Pistons gave him a five-year, $50 million deal.\n\nHis career averages are 14.9 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per contest in 744 regular season games.\n\nHe also shot 40.1% from the three-point range and 85.7% from the free-throw line.\n\nIn 2007, he averaged a career-high 21.3 points per contest in 82 regular season games for the Bulls."
