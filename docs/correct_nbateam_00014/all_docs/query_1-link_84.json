        "text": "Ben Gordon was arrested Tuesday morning on his 40th birthday for allegedly threatening employees at Juice Kings on Atlantic Street in Stamford with a knife.\n\nMark Sudol\n\n•\n\nApr 6, 2023, 4:15 PM\n\n•\n\nUpdated 470 days ago\n\nShare:\n\nPolice are speaking publicly for the first time with News 12 Connecticut about the arrest of former UConn and NBA star Ben Gordon, accusing the retired basketball player of erratic behavior.\n\nPolice say he was arrested hours after the UConn men won the national championship. Gordon was arrested Tuesday morning on his 40th birthday for allegedly threatening employees at Juice Kings on Atlantic Street in Stamford with a knife.\n\nPolice say he resisted arrest.\n\n\"He started to act very erratic and bizarre and would not comply with their commands, and at some point, the officers working in concert took him into custody using very limited force,\" said Stamford Assistant Police Chief Richard Conklin.\n\nPolice say at police headquarters they also found a stun gun and brass knuckles in his backpack. They say Gordon started acting erratically again, but their behavioral health unit calmed him down.\n\nPolice believe he is struggling with mental health issues.\n\nGordon has been in the news recently for other incidents, including allegedly punching his 10-year-old son at LaGuardia Airport and causing a scene at a McDonald's in Chicago.\n\n\"It's very sad. Here's a world-class athlete,\" said Conklin.\n\nGordon has been the pride of Mount Vernon, New York, where we went to high school. He was on the 2004 UConn men’s basketball national championship team.\n\nGordon was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the NBA and later played for Detroit, Charlotte and Orlando.\n\nPolice say he is now with his family after they posted his $10,000 bond.\n\n\"The good news that came out of this - he's with family and friends, and hopefully they can get him whatever resources are appropriate,\" said Conklin.\n\nPolice say they don't know why Gordon was in Stamford.\n\nPolice say no one was injured in the incident.\n\nGordon is due in court April 18."
