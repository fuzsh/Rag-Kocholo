        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. — Ben Gordon’s contract status remained unsettled and the fifth-year guard and the Chicago Bulls are both hoping for a resolution by midweek.\n\nGordon was on hand for the team’s media day Monday, the day before training camp opens, but said he won’t practise until after Wednesday’s deadline to accept a one-year qualifying offer.\n\nAccording to published reports, Gordon was expected to sign a one-year deal worth US$6.4 million by Wednesday, then become an unrestricted free agent following the season. He reportedly rejected a five-year, $50 million deal last summer.\n\n“I thought (a deal) would be done by now,” said Gordon, Chicago’s leading scorer last season with an 18.6-point average. “I’m disappointed that it lasted all the way into training camp.”\n\nBulls general manager John Paxson said negotiations with Gordon’s agents will continue.\n\n“We’re still seeing if there’s a way to come to some resolution,” Paxson said. “As I said the other day, we have anticipated that Ben would sign the qualifying offer. … One way or another, it’s pretty obvious that Ben’s going to be a part of this team this year.”\n\nGordon said he would be on hand when two-a-day practice sessions begin Tuesday.\n\n“I’ll be here watching, but I’m going to wait (to practise) until my decision on Wednesday,” he said.\n\nGordon’s contract status drew as much attention at media day as rookie guard Derrick Rose and first-year Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro.\n\nRose, the overall No. 1 pick in June’s NBA draft, said he’s ready to go.\n\n“I just want to make sure that we have a lot of energy in practice and while I’m on the court we play hard,” said Rose, a native of Chicago whose lone season at Memphis resulted in an NCAA title game appearance. “I also want to make sure that we win a couple more games than we did last year.”\n\nThe 41-year-old Del Negro, named the Bulls’ 17th head coach in June, said his own rookie season will be a learning process.\n\n“I don’t know if you’re ever ready, I don’t care how many years of experience you have,” he said.\n\n“There’s always different things you can learn as a coach. … There’s no magical potion, it’s about going out there on a daily basis, learning things and gaining trust from the players and working together.”\n\nDel Negro succeeded Jim Boylan, who had stepped in on an interim basis last April after Scott Skiles was fired after nearly five seasons as head coach.\n\nThe Bulls welcome back nearly the entire team that finished 33-49 last season."
