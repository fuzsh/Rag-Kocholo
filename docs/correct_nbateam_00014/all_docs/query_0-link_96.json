        "text": "Ben Gordon Facing Charges On 40th Birthday\n\nThe situation with Gordon is heartbreaking to follow. The Chicago Bulls was the perfect place for Gordon to begin his NBA career. Gordon was known as a great scorer during his time in the league. During the 2006-07 season, Gordon posted his greatest scoring year. The former NBA veteran averaged nearly 22 points that season. Gordon has made no statement since the alleged incident. For the latest breaking news in the NBA, be sure to stay right here with HNHH."
