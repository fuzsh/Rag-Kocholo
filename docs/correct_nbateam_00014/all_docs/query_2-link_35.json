        "text": "Back in April, former Chicago Bulls player Ben Gordon was arrested after allegedly threatening employees with a knife at a juice shop. On Tuesday, Gordon pleaded not guilty to weapons and threatening charges in connection with the incident on April 4, at the Juice Kings shop in Stamford, Conn.\n\nAccording to the initial report, police said they received several 911 calls about Gordon, who was reportedly acting aggressively and bizarrely while wielding a blade. The 40-year-old was forced to the ground and handcuffed outside the store, authorities said, after Gordon became aggressive when police attempted to pat him down outside.\n\nGordon, who last played in the NBA during the 2014-15 season, played for the University of Connecticut during his college career and was a member of the 2004 NCAA Championship team.\n\nVia the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nAfter court, Crosland said in an interview that Gordon has struggled with his mental health and with what to do with his life after he retired from the NBA following the 2014-2015 season and an 11-year pro career.\n\n“That passion he had while playing he still has, but it’s hard to navigate shark-infested waters post-league,” Crosland said, not elaborating on what he meant. “But he is doing his best and is now focusing on his family.”\n\nGordon may seek a diversionary program to settle the criminal charges, Crosland said. Gordon is due to return to court next month.\n\nThe incident leading to these latest charges happened on Gordon’s 40th birthday. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the former first-round pick of the Bulls has gotten into trouble with the law.\n\nIn June 2017, Gordon was arrested in Los Angeles after pulling the fire alarm in his apartment building. In Nov. 2017, Gordon was ticketed, released on a $50,000 bail and had to appear in court after he punched a manager of an apartment complex, pulled a knife on him and robbed the man of his security deposit, leading to Gordon’s arrest. In 20222, Gordon was charged of punching his son and resisting arrest at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. Last November, Gordon was charged with a misdemeanor in Chicago, where he allegedly attacked two McDonald’s security guards.\n\nGordon has talked and written about his bipolar disorder and depression, which he said have played roles in his arrests. Below is his article in The Players’ Tribune from 2020, when Gordon wrote about his mental health and the time he attempted suicide.\n\nGordon was the third overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft by the Bulls. The guard became the first rookie in league history to win NBA Sixth Man of the Year. Gordon was also named to the 2005 NBA All-Rookie First Team.\n\nAfter playing for the Bulls from 2004-09, Gordon went on to play for the Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats and Orlando Magic."
