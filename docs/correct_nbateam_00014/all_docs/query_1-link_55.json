        "text": "by Marcel Mutoni\n\nBen Gordon, the Chicago Bulls guard with an undersized body attached to an oversized ego, spent all summer telling anyone who’d listen that his days as a member of Chicago’s professional basketball team were over. Finished. A thing of the past.\n\nNot so fast, Ben. The guy who signs your paycheck might just have a difference of opinion. Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf spoke to the media about the messy Gordon situation, and he doesn’t think Ben is going anywhere for the time being.\n\nFrom the Sun-Times:\n\n”It has to be resolved,” Reinsdorf said Wednesday. ”You know, we have a business disagreement relating to the money, but he’s still a Chicago Bull, and I expect him to play for the Bulls. I expect him to play hard, and I’d be surprised if it’s anything other than that.”\n\n”I expect Ben Gordon to be playing for the Bulls this year, one way or another,” Reinsdorf said. ”I don’t know if it will be resolved before training camp, but I do expect him to be playing for the Bulls.”\n\nJerry is right, of course. With Ben being a restricted free agent, thus giving his employer the right to match any offer he may receive from another team, the Bulls are the ones holding all the cards at the moment.\n\nBG might want to start thinking about steeling himself for another year of unhappiness."
