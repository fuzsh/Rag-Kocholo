        "text": "Ben Gordon, the former UConn star who had an 11-year NBA career, has pled guilty to battering security guards at a McDonald’s in Chicago last year.\n\nA judge gave Gordon, 40, six months of conditional release, which is a form of probation, according to the website CWB Chicago.\n\nPolice said Gordon was being escorted out of the McDonald’s in the early morning hours last November when he punched a security guard in the face, threw him to the ground and also pushed another security guard to the ground.\n\nThis was one of several arrests for Gordon in the last year.\n\nThis past April, he was accused of threatening workers at a juice shop in Stamford, Conn.\n\nWorkers at the juice shop called police and alleged that Gordon was wielding a knife and exhibiting bizarre behavior.\n\nIt took several officers to subdue Gordon, and TMZ later published video showing five officers attempting to wrangle him.\n\nIn this incident, Gordon was charged with three felony counts of carrying a dangerous weapon plus one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.\n\nLast October, The Post first reported that Gordon got arrested at LaGuardia airport for allegedly striking his 10-year-old son in the face.\n\nWitnesses told police that they saw Gordon with “closed fist, striking [the] victim in the face.”\n\nPolice said that two Port Authority officers sustained minor injuries in arresting Gordon in connection with the incident.\n\nGordon was charged with assault and resisting arrest.\n\nGordon starred on UConn’s 2004 national championship team, and he was the 2004-05 NBA Sixth Man of the Year as a rookie on the Bulls.\n\nIn his 11-year NBA career, he played for the Bulls, Pistons, Hornets and Magic."
