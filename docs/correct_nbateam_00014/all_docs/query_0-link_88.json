        "text": "In what can only be described as an awful situation, the former Chicago Bulls player definitely crossed a line in the disciplining of his young son.\n\nFormer Bulls player Ben Gordon arrested for punching son in the head\n\nAccording to reports, former Chicago Bulls player Ben Gordon was detained and arrested at LaGuardia airport Monday for allegedly hitting his 10-year-old son. It is understood, that Gordon was awaiting a flight to Chicago when Port Authority officers stopped him from boarding the plane and then in turn placed him in handcuffs. As per reports, Gordon’s son was then taken by an aunt to Long Island Jewish Children’s Hospital for evaluation. Adding further complications to an already horrible scenario, is the fact that Gordon’s son had an active restraining order against his father during the incident.\n\nRegarding exactly what happened, a witness stated that Gordon punched his child in the head with a closed fist. As for where things stand at the moment, Gordon was taken to the Port Authority police station following the event and is currently being processed. Incidentally, reports also suggest that two officers received minor injuries, due to the fact that Gordon fought back during his arrest. It should be said that this is not the first time that Gordon has had issues with law enforcement. Arrested for an alleged assault and robbery in 2017, Gordon was also detained by police for driving with a forged license plate, as well as setting off fire alarms inside his LA apartment when there was no fire.\n\nWho is Ben Gordon?"
