I recall watching Ben on a Vice episode almost a decade ago which followed him around and documented his vegan lifestyle as an athlete. You could tell then that his psychosis was breaking through.\n\nnomar\n\n#1 Casual Fan™\n\nJoined\n\nAug 27, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n16,016\n\nReaction Score\n\n45,403\n\nFeb 20, 2024\n\n#7\n\nGlad he has this support group.\n\nHard times are hard.

I truly hope he's on the road to repairing any relationships he's damaged."
