        "text": "Like everyone else, he can’t. The Free Press has the details: “When asked whether he ever had experienced anything like this season, Ben Gordon’s answer was simple and to the point. ‘Never,’ the shooting guard said after Wednesday night’s home loss to the Jazz. And, really, there was nothing more to say. Gordon has never missed 19 games because of a sprained ankle and groin strain. He has never averaged less than 15 points per game. If the season ended right now, he would be at a career-low 13.7. A career 40% three-point shooter, Gordon is shooting less than 30% this season. Definitely not what fans were expecting when the Pistons signed him to a five-year, $55-million deal last season.”"
