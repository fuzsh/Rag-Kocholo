        "text": "(Gray News) – Benji Gregory, the former childhood actor best known for his role on the sitcom “Alf,” has died at the age of 46.\n\nHe played the role of Brian Tanner on 101 episodes of the show that aired from ’86 to ’90.\n\nFamily members confirmed the news on Facebook sharing details about his death.\n\nAccording to his sister Rebecca Hertzberg, Gregory was found June 13 in his car in Arizona with his service dog, who also died.\n\nIt is believed he went to the bank the night before but never got out of the car to do so.\n\n“He fell asleep and died from vehicular heatstroke,” Hertzberg said on Facebook.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Gregroy’s death certificate confirms that date. The Maricopa County Medical Examiner’s Office told the media outlet the official cause of death is still pending.\n\n“Ben was a great Son, Brother and Uncle. He was fun to be around and made us laugh quite often. Still, going through his things, I find myself laughing at little videos or notes of his, in between crying,” his sister said on Facebook.\n\nHertzberg told TMZ her brother suffered from depression, bipolar disorder and had a sleep disorder that could keep him awake for days.\n\n“It has taken some time to process and come to terms with our loss. We are not okay.. but take comfort knowing he is with his grandmothers. Please keep his sister, brother and parents in prayer,” the former actor’s cousin, Camille Jazzy Jenkins said in a post on Facebook."
