        "text": "The Times-Union recognizes the top 100 athletes in the sports history of Jacksonville and surrounding counties, continuing with Nos. 51-60. Football takes center stage in this installment, including standouts from both sides of Northwest Jacksonville's Raines-Ribault divide.\n\nJax Greatest 100, 61-70: Multiple medalist, first Creekside NFL star, submarine sensation in 61-70\n\nJax Greatest 100, 71-80: Multi-skilled tight ends, Mustang ace, slugging catcher highlight 71-80\n\nJax Greatest 100, 81-90: Infield energizer, persistent punter, softball star in countdown\n\nJax Greatest 100, 91-100: Brooklyn Dodgers champion, Lady Vol, Davis Cup captain lead off list\n\n60. OTIS SMITH/BASKETBALL\n\nAge: 60\n\nHigh School: Forrest\n\nCollege: Jacksonville\n\nAccomplishments: A second-round draft pick (No. 41 overall) of the Denver Nuggets in 1986, the small forward played six NBA seasons for Denver (1986-87), Golden State (1987-89) and Orlando (1989-92). … Averaged 10.5 points per game over his NBA career, with totals of 3,951 points, 1,416 rebounds and 690 assists. … Picked in 1989 expansion draft, Smith spent his last three playing years with the Magic, where he later served in several positions before getting elevated to general manager (2006-2012). … Had his best NBA season in 1990-91 (13.9 points, 5.2 rebounds). … At JU, he finished with 1,713 points and 911 rebounds, which is fifth and fourth, respectively, on JU’s all-time list. … He scored 47 points and 26 rebounds over three games to earn MVP of the 1986 Sun Belt Conference tournament, which advanced the Dolphins into their most recent NCAA Tournament. … An All-Sun Belt Conference first- or second-team pick all four years. … One of seven JU players to have his basketball jersey (No. 32) retired. … In high school, he led Forrest to the Class 4A state title game before losing to Plant City. … Earned Player of the Year in Duval County, averaging 19.6 points, 14.5 rebounds, 7.1 assists and 4.1 steals. … Named to Converse All-American team.\n\nDeserving because: Though only 6-foot-5, Smith’s athleticism and vertical jump allowed him to guard bigger players and maximize his potential. His leadership skills and quality production manifested itself at every level. Smith served as captain on the last JU team to reach the NCAA tournament and his high character was critical in him climbing the front-office ranks in the NBA.\n\nOn if he envisioned a 38-year career in the NBA: “Not really. After I got done playing, I was trying to figure out how I could help the most players and impact the game in multiple ways. I started in community relations and player development when none of the teams had those things back then. All of that transitioned to player personnel and becoming a GM. That wasn’t a long-term goal. It just sort of evolved.” — Otis Smith.\n\nWhere he is now: Smith lives with his wife, Coco, in the Houston area. He serves as an NBA scout in the Texas region for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n59. DWAYNE CARSWELL/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: 52\n\nHigh School: Temple Christian, University Christian\n\nCollege: Liberty\n\nAccomplishments: Despite being undrafted, Carswell had a 12-year NFL career with the Denver Broncos as mostly a backup tight end until his sixth season. … Started 82 of 163 games, catching 192 passes for 1,707 yards and 15 touchdowns. … Nicknamed “The House” for his blocking ability, Carswell took over as a starter in Denver once Shannon Sharpe left after the 1999 season. … Had his best statistical year in 2000, catching 49 passes for 495 yards, three touchdowns and converting 27 first downs. … The following season, he earned his only Pro Bowl berth on 34 receptions, 299 yards and four TDs. … Carswell won two Super Bowl rings with Denver in 1997 and 1998, serving as a backup to Sharpe in wins over the Green Bay Packers and Atlanta Falcons, respectively. … In 2005, after being moved to guard during training camp, he got some playing time as an eligible receiver in goal-line situations. … Scored touchdowns on passes of 1 and 2 yards in a 20-7 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, becoming the first offensive lineman in the Super Bowl era to record two TDs in one game. … A five-car accident on his way to work in October 2005 essentially ended his NFL career, fracturing multiple ribs, injuring his diaphragm and spleen and requiring five hours of surgery to repair the damage after he was pulled from his crumbled 1994 Chevy Caprice. … At Liberty, he was a running back as a sophomore, rushing for 435 yards and five TDs. … Converted to tight end for his last two seasons on the advice of coach Sam Rutigliano, catching 65 passes for 511 yards and two TDs, and became the only Super Bowl champion from Liberty. … Was one of five running backs who rushed for between 500-800 yards during University Christian's 1989 state championship season, and he caught a 58-yard touchdown on the first play of the Class A semifinal to help UC beat Greensboro 47-16.\n\nDeserving because: Carswell had the longest NFL career of any undrafted player from the Jacksonville area besides Sam Davis. He also joined the Pittsburgh Steelers’ guard as the only player with multiple Super Bowl rings, both remarkable achievements. From high school to the NFL, Carswell played seven different positions.\n\nOn scoring two touchdowns in the same game against the Jaguars as a tackle-eligible receiver: “That was an awesome feeling. The Broncos put the [tackle-eligible] plays in that week. We had two plays we were going to run without knowing if the situation would present itself, but it worked out. I didn’t know what I had accomplished until later. As a tight end, I wasn’t thinking about the position I was in or any record. When the play is called, I’m thinking like a tight end, not a tackle. On the sideline, it made me so happy to know this happened in front of my family and old coaches [from University Christian].” — Dwayne Carswell.\n\nWhere he is now: Carswell lives on Jacksonville’s Southside with his wife, Starr, and their three sons (ages 10, 8 and 6). He has two adult daughters from a previous marriage. Carswell is a stay-at-home father to his three boys.\n\n58.

Also UF's first All-America golfer, in 1952. ... Earned law degree from Florida in 1960 and inducted into Jacksonville Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nDeserving because: He was the first great pro golfer to come out of Jacksonville and was a model of consistency on both the PGA and Senior Tours. Anyone who can be competitive with the world's best players for a significant period of time, even during an era when golf had less depth, belongs high on this list.\n\nOn Sikes: \"One of the greatest compliments I heard was when Jack Nicklaus called him one of the best drivers that he'd ever seen. From a physical standpoint, what I remember from the times we played is his tee shots were long and straight. He was also a fierce competitor. He hated to lose and just never quit on a round.\" — Mark McCumber, PGA Tour player, for 1999 T-U series.\n\nWhere he is now: Died in Jacksonville at age 58 on Dec. 20, 1987.\n\n57. TOM SULLIVAN/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: Deceased\n\nHigh School: Fletcher\n\nCollege: Miami\n\nAccomplishments: A 15th-round draft choice of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1972, he ended up in a starting role as a running back for three of his six seasons in Philadelphia. … Finished with 3,135 rushing yards, which is still 12th on the Eagles' all-time list, on 871 carries and 16 touchdowns. … Also had 161 catches for 1,266 yards and five receiving TDs. ….

An absolute steal considering he was an afterthought in the NFL draft.\n\nOn Sullivan: \"His father was a Navy guy and Tom didn't come to us until the middle of his junior year. He started spring practice as an offensive end, but on the third day of practice, one of my coaches said this kid was in the wrong position because he's a born running back. We moved him there and it was one of the best moves we ever made.\" — Jack Taylor, former Fletcher head football coach, for 1999 T-U series.\n\nWhere he is now: Died at age 52 in Summerville, S.C. on Oct. 10, 2002.\n\n56. TRAVIS TAYLOR/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: 45\n\nHigh school: Ribault\n\nCollege: Florida\n\nAccomplishments: Tied for the second-highest draft pick from Jacksonville in history, Taylor built an eight-year career in the league with Baltimore (2000-04), Minnesota (2005-06) and one-game stints with Oakland and St. Louis in 2007. … Caught 312 passes for 4,017 yards and 22 touchdowns, playing 101 games with 90 starts. … Grabbed 61 receptions for 869 yards and six scores in 2002, his most productive NFL campaign. … He was part of the Ravens' 2000 team and recorded 28 receptions for 276 yards during the season, but missed Super Bowl XXXV after sustaining a broken clavicle in Week 9. … Caught 13 passes for 158 yards in three career Ravens playoff games. … Selected at No. 10 overall in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft. … At Florida, recorded 72 catches for 1,150 yards and 15 touchdowns in three seasons. … Stood out in bowls, gaining 159 receiving yards for MVP honors in the 1999 Orange Bowl against Syracuse and catching a school bowl record 11 passes for 156 yards in the 2000 Citrus Bowl against Michigan State. … Began high school at Camden County in Georgia before transferring to Ribault for his junior year. … A Times-Union Super 11, Super 24 and Super 75 selection. … Caught 46 passes for 811 yards and seven touchdowns as a Trojans senior. … Also helped Ribault basketball to the Class 4A state final in 1997.\n\nDeserving because: Though injuries hampered his professional production after initial top-10 billing, he helped carry on the proud Trojan tradition in the NFL and surpassed 4,000 yards for his pro career.\n\nOn Taylor: \"At first I had no idea he was a football player, because he was so good at basketball... I'll never forget Ribault played First Coast one night [Sept. 20, 1996] and he caught six passes for 200 [officially recorded as 187] yards. They were triple-teaming him and he kept going up and making those catches, and I'm watching him, thinking, 'This guy's going to be in the NFL.'\" — Joseph Simmons, former Ribault teammate on the Trojans' state final basketball team.\n\nWhere he is now: Taylor lives in Suwanee, Ga., in the northeastern suburbs of Atlanta, and remains close to the game as wide receivers coach at Grayson High School. A state football power, Grayson has qualified for the Georgia High School Association final four in three of the last four years and won the state title in 2020.\n\n55. MAC JONES/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: 25\n\nHigh School: Bolles\n\nCollege: Alabama\n\nAccomplishments: After three years as a benchwarmer at Alabama behind Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa, the quarterback who waited his turn instead of transferring led the Crimson Tide to a perfect season and national championship in 2020, finishing third in Heisman Trophy balloting. … Set the NCAA single-season record with a 203.1 passer rating and 77.4 percent completion percentage, capturing the Davey O’Brien, Johnny Unitas and Manning awards. … Jones threw five touchdown passes in a 52-24 rout of Ohio State in the CFP championship game. … Jones had to replace an injured Tagovailoa twice in the 2019 season, starting four games and playing extensively in another, completing 77 of 109 passes for 1,266 yards, 13 TDs and two interceptions during that period. … A first-round draft pick (No. 15 overall) of the New England Patriots, Jones had a successful rookie season, leading his team to the NFL playoffs and earning PFWA All-Rookie team honors. … With Patriots changing offensive coordinators over the next two years, Jones struggled and was traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars in March for a sixth-round draft pick. … In his final season at Bolles, he led the Bulldogs to the Class 4A state title game, throwing for 29 TDs and 1,532 yards. … Also part of a state finalist soccer roster while at Bolles. ... Times-Union Super 11 and Super 24 honoree.\n\nDeserving because: Jones had one of the greatest college football seasons ever for a quarterback in 2020, then followed up with a solid NFL rookie year despite the pressure of playing in New England where legend Tom Brady won six of his seven Super Bowls. His struggles the past two years don’t change his status as a Tuscaloosa legend and Jacksonville's highest-drafted quarterback.\n\nOn how staying patient while sitting the bench at Alabama will help during a likely one-year stop with the Jaguars: \"What I learned in that [Alabama] situation was do whatever you can to put yourself in the best position to win and really become a better football player and person. That’s the gamble me and my family took. Am I going to play right away? Probably not. But is it going to give me the best chance to develop? Probably yes. It kind of worked out that way.\" — Mac Jones.\n\nWhere is he now: Jones came back home to Jacksonville after the Jaguars acquired him in a March trade. He will be competing in training camp with C.J. Beathard for a backup job behind Trevor Lawrence.\n\n54. RON SELLERS/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: 52\n\nHigh School: Paxon\n\nCollege: Florida State\n\nAccomplishments: The wide receiver called \"Jingle Joints\" still stands near the top of the list for Florida State football history, second to Rashad Greene in career records for catches (212) and receiving yardage (3,598), all of which were accomplished in three seasons (1966-68). … Jacksonville's highest selection of the common draft era, a first-round pick (sixth overall) of the Boston Patriots in 1969, playing five NFL seasons with three different teams. … Enjoyed his best pro year as a rookie, catching 27 passes for 705 yards (26.1-yard average) and six touchdowns. … Had three catches for career-high 158 yards in 27-23 loss to Houston Oilers and was named to 1969 AFL All-Star Game. ...

Earned first-team All-State honors in basketball and football. … Led 1964 Paxon football team to 9-1-1 record, suffering only loss to state runner-up Lee 7-6.\n\nDeserving because: He had one of the most dominant amateur careers of any athlete in Jacksonville history, and the durability of his college records 55 years after his career at a receiver-rich school like FSU is a testimony to his talent. Only an injury-shortened NFL career kept him from a higher ranking.\n\nOn Sellers: \"Ron was the quickest person and had the best hands of anybody that I've ever seen in my life. I wasn't that good of a quarterback, but one thing I knew to do was was get the ball to Sellers. He could always turn a 5-yard catch into a 20-yard gain.\" — Gary Pajcic, former teammate at Paxon and Florida State, for 1999 T-U series.\n\nWhere he is now: Sellers lives in Tallahassee as the chairman and chief executive officer of the Sellers Benefits Group, which has been in business since the conclusion of his playing career in 1975 and provides various corporate and personal insurance services.\n\n53. DERRICK ALEXANDER/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: 50\n\nHigh School: Raines\n\nCollege: Florida State\n\nAccomplishments: A two-time first-team All-American defensive end who helped Florida State to its first national championship, Alexander played five NFL seasons (1995-98 with Minnesota, 1999 with Cleveland) before a hip injury halted his career. … A first-round draft choice (11th overall) of the Vikings, he recorded 228 tackles, 20 sacks and five forced fumbles in 73 games (67 starts). … Started the final 12 games as a rookie in 1995, making 34 tackles and forcing fumbles against Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay on strip-sacks. … Led Minnesota defensive linemen with seven tackles for loss in 1996 despite missing four games with an injury, and finished with 51 tackles and had two sacks apiece against Chicago and Philadelphia. … Best season came in 1998 with 7.5 sacks. … Started the last 25 games of his FSU career and finished fourth on Seminoles' all-time list of tackles for loss with 25. … Named first-team All-American and Atlantic Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Year in 1994 after leading FSU with 17 quarterback pressures and 9 tackles for loss. … Also a finalist for the Lombardi Award and named by Football News as Defensive Player of the Year for the nation. … Named first-team All-American in 1993 by Football Writers Association and leading vote-getter among defensive linemen on All-ACC team in FSU's national championship season. … In 18-16 win over Nebraska that clinched the national title, he had 11 tackles (8 solo), two for loss, with a pass deflection. . . .

He was a great pass rusher and it was hard to run at him or away from him. He was just relentless in his pursuit, playing the last play of the game as hard as the first. When he used his hands well, he was almost impossible to block.\" — Freddie Stephens, former Raines head football coach, for 1999 T-U series.\n\nWhere he is now: Alexander was most recently known to be in the Tampa area. He coached high school football at Bishop McLaughlin during the early 2010s.\n\n52. KELVIN MARTIN/FOOTBALL\n\nAge: 59\n\nHigh School: Ribault\n\nCollege: Boston College\n\nAccomplishments: Played 10 NFL seasons as a wide receiver and punt returner with three different teams, starting his career with the Dallas Cowboys (1987-92) and ending it in Dallas in 1996. … A fourth-round draft pick of the Cowboys, he also played with the Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles. … Finished his career with 367 receptions for 4,768 yards and 15 touchdowns. … Also returned 251 punts for 2,565 yards (10.2-yard average) and three touchdowns. … Led Cowboys receivers in 1989 and 1990, combining for 110 catches and 1,376 yards during those two seasons. … Also led the team in punt returns in five different seasons, tying the record held by Bob Hayes. … Caught 32 passes for 359 yards and three touchdowns during the Cowboys' 1992 Super Bowl championship season, and returned two punts for TDs that year. … In two years with Seattle, he combined for 113 receptions, 1,479 yards and six touchdowns. … Picked up by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the February 1995 expansion draft, but released on May 30 and signed with Philadelphia (nine games, 17 receptions, 206 yards). … Re-signed with the Cowboys in 1996, catching 25 passes for 380 yards and returning 41 punts for 373 yards. … Among top receivers in Boston College history, fifth in career yardage (2,337) and second in career touchdown receptions with 28, behind Zay Flowers. … Eagles' top receiver and an All-East selection in 1985 and 1986. … Had a career-high 172 yards against Pittsburgh in 1985. … At Ribault, led all Jacksonville receivers in catches (47), yards (746) and touchdowns (7) in 1982 and made first-team All-City. ...

In high school, everybody was talking about Terrance Roulhac at Raines, who was an excellent player. It's just that Kelvin was overshadowed a bit because of it. It may have taken Kelvin longer to get where he did, but he was going to get there because he was so determined.\" — Don Gaffney, former Ribault head football coach, for 1999 T-U series.\n\nWhere he is now: The former Cowboy is still close to his old NFL team, living in Arlington, Texas.\n\n51.

Voted into UF's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nDeserving because: His championship-winning moment at Raines made Jacksonville history, then he overcame early off-field issues to star at Florida and contribute for a decade in the NFL. In only two years of action, he's still near the top of any list of the Gators' most productive wideouts.\n\nOn Gaffney: \"He worked so hard at catching the ball, just being in bed with the lights dim and throwing the ball up and down and catching it. No question about it, he was a student of the game, and when you come from a family like that, he had great instincts. He could've played quarterback, could've played baseball or basketball, and he won a state championship on the track.\" — Welton Coffey, former Raines head football coach.\n\nWhere he is now: Gaffney is single and living the retired life in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel. He has three children ranging in age from 7 to 17.\n\nCRITERIA\n\nTo qualify for the 100 Greatest Athletes list in the Jacksonville area, candidates must have attended high school or a home school program in Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau or St. Johns counties and established a permanent residence there in the process.\n\nAnyone who came from out of town and boarded at Jacksonville University or other academic institutions while playing sports does not qualify. Thus, prominent sports figures with Jacksonville connections such as Artis Gilmore, Chipper Jones, Hurley Haywood, Joseph Schooling, Cameron Smith or other athletes who moved into the area after their high school years do not meet the criteria for inclusion on this list.\n\nThe rankings were compiled by Times-Union sports columnist Gene Frenette with high school writer Clayton Freeman. It builds on the 1999 project that also included 1999 assistant sports editor Bob McClellan in consultation with several present and past area coaches who witnessed many of these athletes perform in high school, college and professional ranks. Any off-the-field contributions or transgressions by the candidates had no bearing on their ranking. The merits of each candidate were judged strictly by their athletic achievements.\n\nConsideration is given to the level of competition they went up against and the degree of difficulty in their respective accomplishments. Judging was based on only what athletes have done to this point in their careers, making no assumptions on future prospects.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nJune 30: 91-100. July 3: 81-90. July 7: 71-80.
