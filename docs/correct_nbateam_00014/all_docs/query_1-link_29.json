        "text": "Glenn James/Getty Images\n\nFree-agent shooting guard Ben Gordon will reportedly have a chance to play in a 12th NBA season for a legitimate championship contender.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nReport: Gordon Close to Landing Warriors Camp Invitation\n\nThursday, Sept. 24\n\nESPN insider Marc Stein reported that the Golden State Warriors are seeking another shooter and could turn to the 32-year-old Gordon to fill that role in 2015-16—provided he can make the roster.\n\nGordon has never been a dynamic defender, or even a particularly consistent player, but he does have explosive scoring ability. He was named the 2005 NBA Sixth Man of the Year as a member of the Chicago Bulls—the first rookie ever to receive the award.\n\nSince his solid stint in the Windy City, though, Gordon has been on mostly putrid teams in Detroit, Charlotte and last season in Orlando. The Warriors would be by far the best squad he's been a part of.\n\nDerek James of 1500 ESPN weighed in on the possibility of Gordon joining the defending NBA champions:\n\nGolden State could indeed use another outside shooter. Gordon fits the bill with a career 40.1 percent clip from beyond the arc, though he's played in only 75 games over the past two seasons.\n\nAt the 2-guard spot, there aren't a lot of options for the Warriors beyond Klay Thompson. Gordon's main competition for minutes would likely be Leandro Barbosa, an athletic, skilled defender who doesn't have the same scoring upside Gordon does.\n\nThis is a real chance for Gordon to revitalize a career that's gone rather dormant, as he's fallen short of his billing as a former No. 3 overall draft pick.\n\nWith a limited number of minutes and playmakers like reigning league MVP Stephen Curry to set him up, Gordon figures to add solid depth to the Warriors' perimeter rotation if he makes it to and through camp."
