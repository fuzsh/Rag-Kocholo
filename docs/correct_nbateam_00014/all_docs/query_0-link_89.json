        "text": "The Chicago bulls put an end to the Heat’s reign atop the league with a four-game sweep.\n\nBen Gordon scored 24 points and Luol Deng had 22 to lead Chicago past Miami 92-79 Sunday in Game 4 to clinch the first-round Eastern Conference series. The Bulls advanced in the postseason for the first time since Jordan’s last title in 1998.\n\nChicago, which meets Detroit next, became the first team to oust a defending champion in the first round since Phoenix did it to San Antonio in 2000.\n\n“We felt confident coming into this series,” Bulls guard Kirk Hinrich said. “We felt like we could win.”\n\nChicago became the 80th consecutive NBA team to advance after taking a 3-0 lead in a series. Only three teams in major pro sports have overcome such a deficit, and the Heat won’t be joining the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders and 2004 Boston Red Sox in that exclusive club.\n\n“We ran into more than a formidable opponent,” Heat coach Pat Riley said. “They are a great team. … They deserved to win. There’s no doubt in my mind. They can go a long way.”\n\nDwayne Wade scored 24 points for Miami on 8-for-22 shooting, and added 10 assists. Shaquille O’Neal had 16 points, Alonzo Mourning scored 14 and James Posey had 18 rebounds — a club-playoff-record 17 on the defensive end — for the Heat."
