He was taken to the Port Authority police station for processing, according to the Post.\n\nThe news report said Gordon's son was picked up by an aunt and taken to Long Island Jewish Children's Hospital for evaluation. It's unclear the extent of his injuries.\n\nAccording to the Post, two arresting officers also received minor injuries, but the severity is unclear.\n\nGordon, who grew up in Mount Vernon, New York, played in the NBA from 2004-2015.\n\nIn a Players Tribune article in 2020, Gordon said he was suffering from bipolar disorder and had suicidal thoughts.\n\nSince retiring, Gordon has run into legal trouble. In 2017, he was arrested for pulling a fire alarm in his Los Angeles apartment despite there not being a fire.\n\nThat same year, Gordon was arrested on charges of felony robbery after he was accused of punching the manager of an apartment complex where he was renting, holding a knife to the manager, and taking money. He was released on $50,000 bail. Charges were dropped after Gordon made a $25,000 payment as part of a \"civil compromise,\" TMZ reported.\n\nIn 2017, police also responded to a confrontation between Gordon and a woman at Gordon's business, a since-closed sports therapy and rehab facility, in Mount Vernon. Gordon was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation, The Journal News reported.\n\nInsider reached out to Gordon's agent and a talent booking association that claims to work with Gordon for comment but didn't immediately receive replies."
