        "text": "SAGINAW, MI -- What makes a house into a home?\n\nA house serves as a place to live and a roof over your head. As time passes, it grows into a place to share dinner with family, to relax with friends and to make plans for the future.\n\nFor those living in some of Saginaw's historic mansions, the idea of keeping a home is about even more. It's about a passion for history. It's about revitalizing neighborhoods. It's about legacy, and not always their own.\n\nThis week, The Saginaw News presents the stories of some of these homeowners and takes a look inside their remarkable dwellings.\n\nKevin Rooker has lived in his 122-year-old Victorian mansion on Hoyt Avenue for two decades. He's poured thousands of hours and dollars into restoring the beautiful structure. The driving force behind all that work, Rooker said, is his love and respect for the home itself and the legacy of the Wolfarth family who built it.\n\nThe Wolfarths made a name for themselves as bakers. A few blocks from the home on Hoyt stood the Wolfarth Sanitary Steam Bakery. The bakery, long since gone, supplied more than 100,000 loaves a day to 100 towns at the peak of its success.\n\n\"I know more about their history than my own,\" Rooker said. \"I always wanted to live in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, and I always wanted to save an old house. And I got both.\"\n\nRooker and Bill Ostash, who has lived in the home with him since 2012, say they hope preserving the Wolfarth home and the family's legacy is part of their own mark they will leave on the community.\n\n\"We're hoping with everything we do that we'll start something that will continue long after we're gone,\" Ostash said.\n\nNot all of Saginaw's historic homes have been so lucky over the years.\n\nThe Saginaw News in 1967 and again in 1969 published books featuring a total of 84 historic dwellings, all of which would now be 100 years old or older.\n\nOf the 70 \"heritage homes\" located in the city of Saginaw, about one quarter are gone, 18 of the 70. The remaining 52 are still standing.\n\nSince the 1960s, when Saginaw's population began to decline, thousands of old homes have been demolished.\n\nThe city has lost about 48 percent of its population in the last five decades as people moved to new homes in the suburbs or left the area altogether.\n\nSome of the historic homesteads that once sheltered the community's founding citizens today are empty lots. Saginaw has lost impressive homes once owned by families with names familiar to many locals, like Morley, Bliss, Mershon, Rust, Potter, Hanchett and Door.\n\nTom Trombley, deputy director of the Castle Museum of Saginaw County History, pages through the volumes, ticking off those homes that still stand and those that are now only a memory and a photograph.\n\n\"This one is there,\" Trombley said. \"That's gone. Still there. Still there, kind of. Gone. Gone; that was a wonderful house, but I don't really remember it. Gone. Kind of there. There. Gone. There, but vacant. Gone. Gone. There. There; that's a wonderful house. It's very early, and it has blue siding on it.\"\n\nA lot of factors are to blame for the loss of so many historic homes, from the suburbanization movement that Trombley said \"drained\" Saginaw's population to outlying townships to economic factors such as the loss of many of the city's manufacturing jobs.\n\nA city that 'looks toward the future'\n\nSaginaw's 'Heritage Homes'\n\nClick the \"details\" link to find out more about the history of each home.\n\nViewing this on a mobile device and don't see the database?\n\nClick here to explore the database using your mobile browser.\n\nOver the years, he said, Saginaw has been willing to demolish relics of its past that stood in the way of new development.\n\n\"We probably don't rate very high on preservation,\" Trombley said. \"Saginaw is a city that, for much of its history, has looked toward the future.\"\n\nHe said that same trend can be seen in many other cities in Michigan where history is entwined with an automotive industry that often valued change and innovation over preservation.\n\nAt the same time, a core of homeowners who pour time, money and passion into restoring and preserving Saginaw's historic homes has been active for decades, Trombley said.\n\n\"There has always been some interest, in fits and starts there has been,\" he said. \"But it's never been strong enough to really tip the balance as it has in some communities.\"\n\nTrombley said Saginaw has homes serving as good examples of Colonial, Victorian and other architectural styles, as well as those that exhibit unique and rare elements.\n\nIn addition to their value purely for historic preservation, Trombley argues restoration of historic homes can actually build up the community around them.\n\nThe local historian said he has seen a handful of people who own such homes make visible differences in Saginaw's historic neighborhoods.\n\n'A way forward'\n\nIn the West Side's Heritage Square, dozens of beautiful historic homes are preserved by their owners. Another pocket is growing thanks to the work done by those who own sprawling mansions in the East Side's Cathedral District.\n\nRestoring old homes won't restore Saginaw's population, estimated at 50,303 in 2013, to its height of nearly 100,000 residents, Trombley admits. But it can help.\n\n\"It isn't going to be the third-largest city in Michigan, as it once was,\" he said. \"But it's a way forward. And a vacant lot is not.\"\n\nTrombley believes Saginaw's homeowners can make a difference in the community a brick or can of paint at a time.\n\n\"A community that respects its built environment is a community where people want to be,\" he said.\n\nMany credit Rick Rios as one of the pioneers of Saginaw's historic preservation movement. It was 1980 when he first took on the restoration of a large home in the Cathedral District.\n\nAbout 25 years after moving into a 3,700-square-foot Victorian mansion at 614 Sheridan, an electrical fire caused $120,000 in damage. Rios traded the home for a 129-year-old, 4,100-square-foot mansion on South Jefferson once owned by lumber baron J.C. Caskey.\n\n'I was the only one here'\n\nLooking out his front window, Rios points out how much has changed in his neighborhood since he moved into it in 2005.\n\n\"That house was empty; that house was empty; that house was empty,\" he said.\n\nSome of those are now occupied, he said. Though many of the houses in Rios' neighborhood aren't small, up to 3,000 square feet in size, they look modest in comparison to the towering majesty of the Caskey mansion.\n\nRios' house is one of two Victorian mansions still standing on the 500 block of South Jefferson. The other, known as \"the Hill House,\" was built the same year as Rios' for Caskey's business partner, Clarence R. Hill and his wife, Susie.\n\nThe 5,819-square-foot Hill House was recently purchased by a couple from Indiana that intends to move in and, bit by bit, restore the mansion to its former glory.\n\nRelated: Saginaw's Hill House mansion sells for $25,000; Indiana couple plans to restore lumber baron home\n\nRios said he was excited when the Hill House sold.\n\n\"For a long time, I was the only one here,\" he said. \"It's so neat to have neighbors again. Over here, there were no neighbors. I felt like I was all by myself.\"\n\nWithin the last couple of years, though, Rios said several newcomers have purchased homes in the area and are constantly working to renovate. Rios said that motivates him to keep working on his historic home.\n\n\"I still have quite a bit to do,\" he said.\n\nOne of the newest converts to Saginaw's renovation movement is Ryan Seifferlein.\n\n'Selling Saginaw'\n\nSeifferlein, a real estate agent with Keller Williams Realty, has made \"Selling Saginaw\" a mission statement for both his personal and professional lives. Seifferlein focuses on finding people interested in adopting the city's remaining historic mansions.\n\nSeifferlein, who grew up in the Thumb, moved to Saginaw 2012 and restored a small bungalow before taking on the enormous project of restoring a historic mansion in Saginaw's Cathedral District.\n\nThe 24-year-old said he remembers walking into his new home, the Lemke Mansion on Hoyt, and looking around at all the work that needed to be done to make the 106-year-old, 3,422-square-foot home livable.\n\n\"I just started sweeping,\" Seifferlein said. \"I had like 50 bottles of water in my car until I got the plumbing working.\"\n\nWith a little help from Home Depot, he taught himself how to repair the plumbing.\n\nSeifferlein said he personally enjoys the challenge the huge task presents. But he also feels like he is part of something important by improving a small section of the community -- improvements that he hopes lead to more of the same.\n\n\"It gives me something to work for,\" he said.\n\nSeifferlein said he has always been a \"hands-on\" person and has had a passion for architecture and homes, particularly old homes, since his youth. He remembers touring weekend open houses with his grandmother.\n\nWhile historic homes in Saginaw can sometime be purchased for prices well below their value, there can be significant costs and responsibilities associated with owning a big home.\n\nKevin Rooker originally bought his home on Hoyt on a land contract and, after about six years, bought the 3,711-square-foot house outright for $15,000.\n\nHe took out a home loan in 1998 to cover the purchase cost, to replace the boiler and to put on a back porch.\n\nBeyond ordinary homeowner expenses, there are some uncommon costs that come with a owning a historic home full of antiques. Rooker and Ostash have a clock-repair budget, for example.\n\n\"When you have as many clocks as we need to get fixed, and they're about $100/$150 apiece,\" Ostash said. \"We have about five clocks that need fixing. So that's close to $1,000.\"\n\nAnother factor for the owners of historic homes to consider is the cost to heat large structures, which are not typically energy-efficient buildings.\n\nSeifferlein said his heating bill for his 3,400-square-foot home can run up to $800 a month during the winter.\n\nBut he said there are financial benefits that come with the burdens, including relatively low tax bills due to the lower property values. What makes it all worthwhile, Seifferlein said, is seeing the effect his efforts have on not only his own home, but also his community as a whole.\n\nThe 'little things'\n\nSomething as simple as planting flowers along the front walkway can inspire neighbors to do the same, Seifferlein said. He has seen it happen.\n\n\"My street, other than two homes, is pretty much all being restored now, which is a pretty big deal,\" Seifferlein said.\n\nTrombley agreed that incremental changes as simple as landscaping can eventually transform a whole neighborhood.\n\n\"Those little things make a difference,\" he said. \"But it isn't something that happens instantly. And you have to keep at it.\"\n\nWhen Seifferlein talks about what he is doing, he sometimes sounds more like an evangelist than a salesman.\n\n\"The possibilities are endless if you can get enough people,\" he said. \"Pretty soon we're going to outweigh the number of houses being restored than the ones sitting there waiting.\"\n\nTrombley agreed there is great potential in historic preservation. Though he said he wouldn't \"stand in front of the bulldozer\" for every historic structure, those who value and preserve history absolutely impact the future in a positive way.\n\n\"A parking lot never changes a community, whereas a restored house can,\" Trombley said.\n\nSeifferlein said he is no opponent of new development, though he said he mourns for all the one-of-a-kind historic buildings and homes Saginaw has lost over the years.\n\n\"It's just a shame,\" he said. \"There's so much to learn from history if people would stop and look. The city of Saginaw hopefully someday will realize what they have done to hurt it by tearing down so much.\"\n\nTrombley said he is hopeful of what the efforts of people like Rios, Seifferlein, Rooker and Ostash mean for the future of Saginaw's historic neighborhoods.\n\nThough there are plenty of people who doubt Saginaw's comeback, those who see it happening one historic home at a time feel strongly that their hope is spreading.\n\n\"I have not met a single person who doesn't like what they're seeing,\" Seifferlein said."
