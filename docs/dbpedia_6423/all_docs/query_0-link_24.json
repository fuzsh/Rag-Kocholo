        "text": "This section guides to assist employees as well as outside responding agencies in dealing with hazardous material/waste spill emergencies on SVSU property. It incorporates and references other contingency plans regarding radioactive material, but does not replace or supersede those plans.\n\nDefinitions\n\nIncidental Spill - A release of hazardous materials that requires a response effort by employees from the immediate work area where the released material can be absorbed, neutralized, contained or otherwise controlled at the time of release. Employees responding to incidental releases must receive proper training regarding personal protective equipment and spill clean-up procedures.\n\nEmergency Release - An uncontrolled release of hazardous materials (spill, fire, explosion) that requires an emergency response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area.\n\nHigh Hazard Emergency - An emergency of unknown nature. This situation may be immediately dangerous to life and health; a threat to personnel and/or the public; threaten the surrounding area or facility; and/or involve a toxic gas leak, or a toxic, corrosive or reactive hazardous material discharge.\n\nHazardous Material Spill Clean-Up Procedures\n\nEmergency Release – Notification\n\nIf the spill is uncontrollable, involves an unknown material, or has a quantity and nature that is beyond the response capabilities of the employees working in the area, immediately contact a supervisor. A supervisor or designee will notify University Police from any campus phone and express the need for Hazardous Materials trained personnel to assist in the spill response activities.\n\n1. Call University Police from a telephone outside the immediate spill area, out of danger, and provide the following information:\n\nName, title, department\n\nThe location of the incident\n\nThe container(s) or equipment that are involved (size, shape, color)\n\nLabeling and any other relevant information that can be identified from a safe distance\n\nType of material (solid, liquid, gas, mist)\n\nThe specific name, if known, of hazardous material(s) and the associated hazard\n\nThe estimated quantity of material(s)\n\nThe estimated rate of flow of released material, i.e., dripping, pouring, “gushing”\n\nInjuries or exposures\n\nWhere sewer or storm drains are located nearby\n\nThe actions are taken to contain and secure the situation\n\n2. University Police will notify the Executive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs or designee, the Director of Environmental Health and Safety or designee, and the Executive Director of Communications & External Affairs. Additionally, the Associate Vice President of Administration and Business Affairs, Assistant Vice President of Facilities Planning & Construction or designees, may be notified and asked to coordinate the isolation or control of critical operations such as building ventilation.\n\n3. The University Police or the Director of Environmental Health and Safety shall determine if the incident is within the scope and capabilities of SVSU trained employees present. The University Police will establish an Incident Command Post located a safe distance from the spill area.\n\n4. Untrained person(s) at the scene of the spill who are not involved in the response effort must vacate the affected area at once. The area must be sealed off to prevent further contamination until the arrival of University Police, EHS or the Kochville Township Fire Department.\n\n5. If it is determined by either the University Police or EHS that it is beyond SVSU capabilities to safely respond to the incident, the Kochville Township Fire Department and/or an environmental contractor familiar with campus shall be notified.\n\n6. At any time during the response activities, the University Police or the EHS director may declare the situation a High Hazard Emergency and stop SVSU employees from continuing the response efforts, if it is believed that they are unable to safely perform the response activities.\n\n7. University Police shall be responsible for securing the area, as well as initiating and monitoring the safe evacuation of the immediate area, building(s), or the campus, depending on the nature and extent of the spill incident. EHS and University Police shall coordinate the notification of outside agencies, such as the Saginaw County Emergency Operations Office.\n\n8. If occupants are evacuated to the outdoors, they should be directed to move to a clear area away from the affected building(s), keeping streets, fire lanes, hydrants and walkways clear for emergency vehicles and crews. A campus Incident Command Post may be set up near the emergency site. The assembly area(s) and the Incident Command Post should be located up-wind, up-hill and up-stream from the spill emergency. Employees must keep clear of the Command Post, unless on official business.\n\n9. Persons who may be contaminated by the spill are to avoid contact with others as much as possible, remove contaminated clothing, remain in the vicinity but a safe distance from the spill incident and provide their names to University Police. A safety shower or eyewash should be used as necessary to decontaminate the individual. Contaminated clothing should be held for EHS instructions on decontamination/disposal.\n\n10. Only trained personnel shall perform the required first aid and hazardous material clean-up activities.\n\n11. If other hazards exist (fire, explosion, chemical exposure, personal injury), employees must move to the nearest area of safety and follow the appropriate emergency procedures for the conditions, e.g., building evacuation.\n\n12. Individuals should not attempt to rescue someone unless they know what hazards exist and how to properly protect the person from the hazard. Employees should not move an injured person unless the person is in immediate danger. Personnel should provide first aid only if properly trained. DO NOT BECOME A VICTIM!\n\n13. If at all possible, have the safety data sheets (SDS) readily available for emergency response personnel.\n\nRadioactive Material Spills\n\nFor radioactive material spills, isolate and contain the spill. Do not spread radioactive contamination beyond the immediate area. Immediately contact 911.\n\nRemember: the effects of exposure to radioactive materials may be reduced by minimizing the time exposed, increasing the distance between individuals and the radioactive materials, and providing shielding from the source of radiation.\n\nDecontamination Procedures\n\nPersonnel cleaning incidental chemical spills shall decontaminate or properly dispose of any equipment used in the clean-up process. Spill kits shall be restocked after use by the individual(s) who used the kit(s). All contaminated materials generated from a spill clean-up shall be properly packaged and given to the SVSU Chemistry Department for disposal.\n\nAll personal protective equipment and equipment used in the response shall be decontaminated before storage for reuse. If cleaning is not possible, the item shall be properly packaged and given to the Chemistry Department for disposal. All supplies used in the clean-up procedure must be replenished as soon as possible by the individual(s) who used the kit(s).\n\nThe EHS Department will deem the site safe for re-entry. Upon termination of the incident, University Police personnel shall remove all barricade tape and posted signs.\n\nCampus Violence and Criminal Behavior\n\nSVSU has zero tolerance for the violence of one person toward another. The campus community should assist in making the campus a safe place by being alert to suspicious situations and promptly reporting them. Campus violence includes, but is not limited to, civil disturbances, demonstrations, disruptive behavior, looting, weapons offenses, protests, riots, threatening behavior, and workplace violence.\n\nIf a person observes any of the above acts, any other criminal acts, or a suspicious person on campus, it is important to report the incident to University Police. Call 911 from any telephone. Provide the following:\n\nNature of the incident\n\nLocation of the incident\n\nDescription of person(s) involved\n\nDescription of property involved\n\nBomb Related Emergencies\n\nIf a community member should observe a suspicious object, potential bomb, or have been told of a bomb that is on campus, he or she should not approach or handle the object. Clear the area and immediately call University Police at 911 from off-campus or a cell phone, or 911 from any telephone. Provide the following information: What is your name? Are you an employee or student?\n\n1. Any person receiving a phoned-in bomb threat should ask the following:\n\nWhere the bomb is located\n\nWhen it will explode\n\nWhat the bomb looks like\n\nWhat kind of bomb it is?\n\nThe caller’s name and motive for placing the bomb\n\n2. Keep talking to the caller as long as possible and record the following:\n\nTime of call\n\nAge and sex of caller\n\nSpeech pattern, accent, possible nationality\n\nThe emotional state of the caller\n\nBackground noise, voice pitches and patterns\n\nAny other relevant information\n\nTelephone number called from, if known\n\n3. The University Police dispatcher will notify the following individuals, depending upon the assessment of the threat:\n\nChief of University Police\n\nAssociate Vice President for Administration and Business Affairs, or designee\n\nDirector of Environment Health and Safety\n\nAssistant Vice President of Facilities Planning & Construction\n\nExecutive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs\n\nPresident\n\nProvost/Vice President for Academic Affairs/University Deans\n\nExecutive Director for Communications and External Affairs\n\nIf the situation warrants, University Police will notify the following agencies:\n\nKochville Township Fire Department\n\nSaginaw County Sheriff’s Department\n\nMichigan State Police Bomb Squad\n\nOther law enforcement agencies as deemed necessary, e.g., other area police agencies, FBI, BATF, etc.\n\n4. The President or Executive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs, in consultation with the Chief of University Police, will assess the circumstances and determine options, which may include Shelter-In-Place options or an immediate and full evacuation of the building(s). If conditions warrant, the University Police will implement the appropriate emergency notification and evacuation procedures.\n\n5. If it is determined that evacuation is the proper action, University Police will search assembly areas before initiating the building evacuation.\n\n6. University Police will alert the building occupants to begin evacuation. Alarms WILL NOT be used to alert occupants, due to the possibility of setting off the bomb.\n\n7. Employees should not open drawers and cabinets, or turn lights or equipment on or off.\n\n8. Once outside, individuals are required to move to a clear area away from the affected building. Streets, fire lanes, hydrants and walkways must be kept clear for emergency vehicles and crews.\n\n9. The University Police shift supervisor will:\n\nIdentify the location of the command post\n\nCall available University Police personnel to Incident Command Post. Additional personnel from\n\nCampus Facilities Department, EHS, etc., may be asked to assist University Police to do the following:\n\nTurn off all radios and pagers, cell phones before entering the building\n\nAvoid touching any suspicious object found in the building. Go outside of the building to report the exact location\n\nLimit all radio transmissions to OUTSIDE of the building\n\nAssign University Police personnel to assist in evacuating the building and immediate area(s) adjacent to the affected building(s) and secure the building to prevent unauthorized persons from entering the building\n\nAssign University Police personnel to search for any suspicious objects in and around the exterior of the building(s). If SVSU personnel are assisting in searching for suspicious objects, they should be accompanied, if possible, by a person knowledgeable about recognizing bombs and experienced in bomb emergencies\n\n10. Campus Facilities personnel may be asked by the University Police to provide assistance and/or advice concerning mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, penthouse areas, utility tunnels and other areas where access is restricted. Campus Facilities employees should observe the following:\n\nTurn off all radios, cell phones and pagers before entering the building\n\nAvoid touching any suspicious object found in the building. Go outside of the building to report the exact location\n\nLimit all radio transmissions to OUTSIDE of the building\n\nDiscovery of a Potential Bomb\n\nIf a potential bomb is discovered, employees should not approach or handle the object. Clear the area immediately and call University Police.\n\n1.

The University Police Dispatcher will immediately call one or more of the following individuals and agencies:\n\nChief of University Police\n\nAssociate Vice President for Administration and Business Affairs\n\nDirector of Environment Health and Safety or designee\n\nAssistant Vice President of Facilities Planning & Construction\n\nExecutive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs\n\nPresident\n\nExecutive Director for Communications and External Affairs\n\nKochville Township Fire Department\n\nSaginaw County Sheriff’s Department\n\nMichigan State Police Bomb Squad\n\n3. The University Police will assess the circumstances and determine whether an immediate and full evacuation of the building(s) is required. If conditions warrant, the University Police will implement the emergency notification and evacuation procedures. University Police will alert the building occupants to begin evacuation.\n\nBomb Explosion\n\nIf a bomb explodes, University Police will do the following:\n\n1. Secure the building and prohibit individuals from entering or coming near the building(s) in case a second bomb is present.\n\n2. Coordinate/delegate notification of the explosion to the following:\n\nAssociate Vice President for Administration and Business Affairs or designee\n\nDirector of Environment Health and Safety or designee\n\nAssistant Vice President of Facilities Planning & Construction\n\nExecutive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs\n\nPresident\n\nChief of University Police\n\nExecutive Director of Communications and External Affairs\n\nKochville Township Fire Department\n\nSaginaw County Sheriff’s Department\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF)\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\n\nMichigan State Police Bomb Squad\n\n3. Implement evacuation procedures for the area or building(s) affected.\n\n4. Assist the medical rescue team(s) to locate and evacuate the injured.\n\nTerrorism Threats\n\nThe nature of hazards resulting from terrorist attacks include chemical, biological, nuclear/radiological and/or explosive materials. In the case of chemical attacks, general indicators of a terrorist attack include unexplained casualties and/or unidentified liquid, spray or vapor. In the case of a biological attack, indicators include unusual illness and a definite pattern inconsistent with the natural disease. If such health issues are noticed, local health authorities will immediately be notified.\n\nWhen a terrorist attack is suspected, employees should follow the steps below:\n\nNotify the University Police, who will request assistance from Federal, State and Local police and fire agencies to respond.\n\nUse basic procedures and the leadership identified for responding to other types of emergencies to assure the safety and health of the University community is given high priority.\n\nWhen the University Police are notified of suspicious activities that might indicate a potential terrorist attack (including unusual vehicles, packages that are suspected terrorist threats, etc.), the University Police Chief will convey necessary information to the Executive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs. The Emergency Operations Center may become operational.\n\nActive Shooter/Secure in Place\n\nAn active shooter is a person or persons who appear to be actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas on campus. Active shooter situations are dynamic and evolve rapidly, demanding an immediate response by the community and immediate deployment of law enforcement resources to stop the shooting and prevent harm to the community.\n\nIn general, responding to an active shooter will be dictated by the specific circumstances of the encounter. If involved in an active shooter situation, all persons should remain calm and call 911 from any telephone as soon as possible.\n\nIf an active shooter is outside or inside your building, employees should:\n\nTry to remain calm\n\nTry to warn other faculty, staff, students and visitors to take immediate shelter\n\nProceed to a room that can be locked or barricaded. Lock and barricade doors or windows\n\nTurn off lights, close blinds, and block windows\n\nTurn off radios or other devices that emit sound and silence cell phones\n\nKeep out of sight and take adequate cover/protection, i.e., concrete walls, thick desks, filing cabinets\n\nHave one person CALL 911 and provide:\n\nYour name and location and state that “there is an active shooter on campus, gunshots fired”\n\nGive a description and location of the person(s)\n\nGive a description of victims, location and number of victims\n\nReport suspicious devices (weapons, improvised explosive devices); provide the location and a description\n\nProvide a description and location of any explosions\n\nWait patiently until a uniformed police officer, or a University official known to them, provides an “all clear,” as an active shooter may try to lure hostages from safety. Avoid responding to voice commands unless issued by a police officer or University official\n\nAttempt to rescue hostages only if rescue can be accomplished without further endangering the persons inside a secured area\n\nDepending on circumstances, consideration also may be given to exiting ground floor windows as safely and quietly as possible\n\nIf an active shooter enters an office or classroom, employees should do the following:\n\nTry to remain calm. Try not to do anything to provoke the active shooter\n\nWhen life is in danger, make a personal choice to attempt to negotiate with or overpower the assailant(s) if there is no possibility of escape or hiding\n\nCall 911 from any telephone, if possible, and provide the information listed above\n\nBarricade the room or proceed to a safer location if the active shooter(s) leave the area\n\nIf an active shooter is outdoors, employees should do the following:\n\nTry to remain calm\n\nMove away from the active shooter or the sounds of gunshot(s) and/or explosion(s)\n\nLook for appropriate locations for cover/protection, i.e., brick walls, retaining walls, large trees, parked vehicles, or any other object that may stop bullet penetration\n\nTry to warn other faculty, staff, students and visitors to take immediate shelter\n\nCall 911 and provide the information listed above\n\nIf an active shooter situation develops, the University will combine efforts with law enforcement to manage the event. The University will provide the most accurate and timely information available to students, faculty, staff and the community through Campus Alert, the University website (www.svsu.edu), PA announcements and the mass media.\n\nInformation Technology/Computer Security\n\nIt is vital to manage and protect computer assets, networks and information systems on campus. Should a breach or system failure occur, University Police Dispatch will notify Information Technology personnel to determine actions necessary for events that affect critical production systems. These can include:\n\nImplementation of procedures to prevent further damage\n\nMaintenance of central data and computing infrastructure\n\nAssessment and establishment of alternate means of providing computing services to the University\n\nEarthquake\n\nIn the event of an earthquake, employees should do the following:\n\nIF INDOORS, seek refuge in a doorway, under a desk or table. Stay away from glass windows, shelves, and heavy equipment.\n\nIF OUTDOORS, move quickly away from buildings, utility poles, and other structures. Always avoid power or utility lines.\n\nIF IN AN AUTOMOBILE, stop in the safest place available, preferably away from power lines and trees. Stop as quickly as safety permits, but stay in the vehicle for the shelter it offers if no other shelter is available.\n\nAfter the initial shock, evaluate the situation and if emergency help is necessary, call University Police at 911 from any telephone or 964-4141.\n\nIf hazards resulting from the earthquake should occur, such as fires, hazardous material spills, and/or power outages, contact University Police and follow the appropriate emergency guidelines established in this plan, e.g., evacuation procedures.\n\nFlooding\n\nFlooding can happen anywhere in the nation and at any time of year. In Michigan, floods are of the most concern during the spring and fall months. Floods are dangerous and can happen very quickly. The best protection in cases of floods is to stay informed. The following watches/warnings may be issued during times of flooding:\n\nFlash Flood or Flood Watch: Flooding is possible within the designated area.\n\nFlash Flood or Flood Warning: Flooding has been reported or is on the way. Immediately take the necessary precautions.\n\nFurther Information\n\nDirect any questions regarding the Emergency Operations Plan to the Chief of Police at (989) 964-4285 or the Office of the Executive Vice President for Administration & Business Affairs at (989) 964-4045."
