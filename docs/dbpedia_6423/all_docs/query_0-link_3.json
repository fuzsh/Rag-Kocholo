        "text": "\"Saginaw\" redirects here. For other uses, see Saginaw (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Michigan, United States\n\nSaginaw ( ) is a city in and the seat of Saginaw County, Michigan, United States.[4] The city proper had a population of 44,202 at the 2020 census.[5] Located along the Saginaw River, Saginaw is adjacent to Saginaw Charter Township and considered part of Greater Tri-Cities region of Central Michigan. The Saginaw metropolitan area had a population of 190,124 in 2020. The city is also the largest municipality in the Greater Tri-Cities, with a combined population of 377,474 in the combined statistical area in 2020.\n\nEstablished as a fort following the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, Saginaw was a thriving lumber town in the 19th century. It was an important industrial city and manufacturing center throughout much of the 20th century due to its automobile and automotive parts production led by General Motors.[6] As part of the Rust Belt, its industry and strong manufacturing presence declined, leading to increased unemployment, crime, and a population decline.[7] Modern economic development is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. However, the city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the U.S. average.[8]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Saginaw is widely believed to mean \"where the Sauk were\" in Ojibwe, from Sace-nong or Sak-e-nong (Sauk Town), due to the belief that the Sauk once lived there. But it is more likely that the name means \"place of the outlet\", from the Ojibwe sag (opening) and ong (place of).[9][10]\n\nWhen Natives told Samuel de Champlain that the Sauk nation was on the western shore of Lake Michigan, Champlain mistakenly placed them on the western shore of Lake Huron. This mistake was copied on subsequent maps, and future references identified this as the place of the Sauks. Champlain himself never visited what is now Michigan.[11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Saginaw, Michigan\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe site of what later became the city of Saginaw was originally inhabited by the Anishnabeg. French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 17th century and encountered the Ojibwe (Chippewa) living in the area. The first permanent settlement by those other than Native Americans was in 1816 when Louis Campau established a trading post on the west bank of the Saginaw River.[12] Shortly thereafter the United States established Fort Saginaw. Campau's trading post was also inhabited by Metis.\n\nDuring Michigan's territorial period, a county and township government were organized at Saginaw. Growth of the settlement was fueled rapidly during the 19th century by the lumber industry. Saginaw was the site of numerous sawmills and served as a port for Great Lakes vessels. What is now the city of Saginaw resulted from the consolidation of the cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw City (West Side) in 1889.\n\nFort Saginaw\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1819, Lewis Cass, in the Treaty of Saginaw, negotiated the prerogative for the United States to own and settle the area with the leaders of the Ojibwe. In 1820, Campau attempted to expand across to the east bank of the river but was rejected by the Chippewas. In 1822, the United States Army established a fort on the west bank of the Saginaw River and named it Fort Saginaw. Two companies were stationed at the fort. A group of investors purchased some land near the fort and had it platted under the name, Town of Sagana. Due to the extremely harsh seasons and illnesses, Fort Saginaw was abandoned by 1824.[12]\n\nBy the late 1820s, the American Fur Company was operating a post at Saginaw.\n\nFew plots were sold and after the U.S. Army pulled out, the town languished for most of the following decade. The town was re-platted in December 1830, comprising riverfront from Cass Street, on the south, to Harrison Street, and north to Jefferson. These plots sold slowly. By 1835, only 24 plots had been sold and the remainder were transferred to a new owner, who made another plat in February 1837. However, the financial crisis of the Panic of 1837 dampened interest in purchasing properties. After selling only 58 of the 407 plots, the remainder was sold again in 1841.[13]\n\nNative Americans\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw was the location of the annual government payment to the Ojibwe and Ottawa of the area, starting in the 1830s. This also attracted many French-Canadian and Euro-American merchants, primarily involved in selling watered down whiskey.[14]\n\nLumber boom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main cause for the founding and subsequent development of Saginaw was the large demand for lumber as the United States expanded westward. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to transportation provided by the Saginaw River and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars.\n\nMultiple settlements comprise present-day Saginaw. On the west side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina's name relates to the brine that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships on the Saginaw River. Lumber production peaked by the early 1870s, but had virtually disappeared by the end of the 19th century. In addition to salt production, which experienced an eventual decline as well, growing industries, such as those supporting the area's agriculture and manufacturing, developed.\n\nConsolidation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 28, 1889, the Michigan state legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the cities of Saginaw and East Saginaw into a single city.[15][16] Prior to this consolidation, the nearby village of Salina had already become part of East Saginaw. The consolidation of Saginaw became effective with the election of officers on March 12, 1890.[16]\n\nThe provisions of the city charter were established by the same act of the legislature that provided for the consolidation. Saginaw was to be governed by a city council consisting of two aldermen elected from 21 wards and a mainly ceremonial executive mayor who was to have fairly weak powers. This was to be, as numerous other elected officials, along with elected or appointed boards, controlled much of the administrative and executive functions of government. The efficient and cohesive functioning of the Saginaw city government also was constrained by remaining rivalries between residents, business owners, and politicians from the former two cities. The distinctions and rivalries between Saginaw's east side and west side persisted into the 20th century in various forms, and continues to influence Saginaw's social, political, economic landscape, even into the 2010s.[17]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nIndustrialization\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 20th century, automobile production proliferated throughout Michigan, but most notably in Detroit. Other Michigan cities became suppliers to Detroit factories, sometimes with factories of their own. In Saginaw, the Jackson-Church-Wilcox Company began as a partnership in 1906 for producing steering gear under the \"Jacox\" brand. Jackson-Church-Wilcox was acquired by Buick in 1909, and as part of General Motors became the Jackson, Church and Wilcox Division, the first GM division devoted to parts production. In 1919 the Jacox division was merged with Saginaw Malleable Iron and Central Foundry into GM's Saginaw Products Company. This formed the basis for the Saginaw Steering Gear Division, created in 1928. General Motors and other manufacturers established foundries and other automobile-related manufacturing facilities in Saginaw, for the production of chemicals and plate glass, as well as metal fabrication. This early development of a symbiotic relationship with the auto industry set the course for the future of the city.[18]\n\nBefore the United States entered World War II, Saginaw's industrial complex became directed towards military production. Turning its efforts to the production of munitions, ordnance and components for military vehicles made Saginaw a significant contributor to the Allies' victory. Saginaw was home to a production facility that produced .30 caliber machine guns more quickly and at lower cost than the Army thought possible, armor-piercing shells for anti-tank use,[19] and more than half a million M1 carbine rifles for the US military during World War II, the \"Gun Plant\" that later became Steering Gear Plant 2.[20] Saginaw Steering Gear's Plant 1 also began wartime production in 1941, concentrating on ball screws that would eventually be used in the wing flaps of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress.[21][22] Malleable Iron converted its production of Armasteel from engine components to gun parts and tank treads,[23] while Grey Iron specialized in the production of magnesium for use in Pratt & Whitney aeroplane engines.[24]\n\nMigration from across the country, particularly from the Southern United States, drastically increased Saginaw's population during the war years and through the 1950s. This population growth included the expanded presence of African Americans and Latinos in Saginaw. Even before the end of the war, the needs of Saginaw's growth became clear, and were met by significant investment in the city's infrastructure. In 1947, Saginaw and the nearby city of Midland constructed a 65-mile-long (105 km) water supply pipeline drawing water from Whitestone Point in Lake Huron to meet the anticipated needs of the communities. In addition, the cities of Midland and Bay City joined with Saginaw to develop and operate an airport on the site of a former POW camp in nearby Tittabawassee Township, which eventually became MBS International Airport.\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1908, a new Michigan state constitution was adopted. The new Michigan state constitution mandated increased home rule powers for local units of government, and the Michigan state legislature enacted the Home Rule Cities Act in 1909. Under this statute, cities were permitted to frame and adopt their own city charters and were given great flexibility in structuring their local governments. The government, under the 1889 charter, had continued to be inefficient and provided for much political infighting. In 1913, a new city charter was adopted with voter approval and which followed a commission form of city government that had gained in popular interest among various cities across the United States in the early 20th century. The new government consisted of five commissioners, each elected separately at-large, who served both as the city council and as the executive heads of various city government departments. One of the commissioners served as the mayor, which was a mostly ceremonial role.\n\nThe 1913 city charter was followed for little more than two decades when the voters of the city again adopted another new city charter in 1935 following the council-manager form of government. The government under the 1913 city charter retained some of the independent boards that were given authority independent of the elected city commissioners. This caused some inefficiency and political friction. The economic consequences of the Great Depression during the 1930s provided the final catalyst for municipal government reform.\n\nIn contrast to the previous government structures, the 1935 charter, having taken effect in 1936, provided for all administration of city government to be headed directly by a single officer, the city manager, who was appointed by, and accountable to a city council of nine members elected as a group by the entire city at-large. The system was designed to address two principal issues with Saginaw's history of municipal government, the inefficiency and politics associated with having executive and administrative authority spread among many different officers and boards, and political rivalries and friction between various geographic areas of the city, mainly the east side and the west side.\n\nPost World War II\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the years following World War II, the Michigan state legislature enacted laws making it increasingly difficult for incorporated cities to expand by annexing territory from neighboring townships. Townships, which had historically served an agrarian, smaller population than that of larger cities, were given the ability to provide nearly all the same services an incorporated city could. Although Midland pursued (and continues to pursue) a policy of \"No annexation, no water,\"[25] Saginaw chose to sell water to neighboring communities under long-term contracts. This allowed the townships to further develop at the expense of the city, the limits of which changed little after consolidation in 1889–90. The unintended consequence of this choice was that Saginaw's population stopped growing, new housing development focused on the suburban townships, and businesses eventually followed.\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation decline\n\n[edit]\n\nManufacturing in Saginaw declined in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to high unemployment in the city. As a result, the city's population diminished dramatically. From 2000 to 2010, the population of Saginaw proper decreased by nearly 10,000. Michigan's population during that period decreased by 0.6% percent, the only U.S. state to lose population during the decade of the 2000s. In addition, Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. The crime rate has been a major area of concern for the community.[26]\n\nUnemployment and crime\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw's economic conditions, compounded by the 2007–2012 global financial crisis, are a significant area of concern for the city's residents. The decline in manufacturing jobs has resulted in higher than average rates of unemployment. Property values in the city have declined, decreasing the amount the city government collects in property taxes. Unemployment in Saginaw peaked in July 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, standing at 23.5%. The unemployment rate dropped to 9.0% as of April 2015; crime has decreased as unemployment has decreased.\n\nSaginaw consistently ranks as having one of the highest crime rates in both Michigan and the United States at large.[27][28][29][30][31] In 2020, Saginaw had a homicide rate of 50.2 per 100,000 people, narrowly surpassing Detroit's rate (49.7) and dwarfing the State and National Rates (7.6 and 6.5, respectively).[28][32]\n\nCombating blight\n\n[edit]\n\nUnemployment and population loss in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to urban decay, specifically a rise in abandoned homes that provided locations for criminal activity. In recent years, city officials, law enforcement, and neighborhood watch associations have made progress in preventing this activity by heavily patrolling target areas and offering rewards for reporting illegal or suspicious activities.\n\nEfforts to reduce blight in Saginaw increased greatly in 2013, with the United States Department of the Treasury approving a grant to demolish vacant and abandoned properties via the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The $100 million grant contained $11.2 million set aside for Saginaw, with Detroit receiving $52.3 million, Flint $20.1 million, Pontiac $3.7 million, and the final $2.5 million going to Grand Rapids.[33] After the grant's approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from their owners, which would be then added to a list of homes to tear down. Officials estimate that there were nearly 1,200 homes within the city limits worthy of demolition.[34]\n\nEfforts to revitalize downtown increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 that would save nearly an entire block of buildings slated for demolition at the intersection of Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan called for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012 a similar deal was made for the Bancroft and Eddy apartments at the same intersection. Once Section 8 housing, these buildings are being transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.[35]\n\nEconomic development in the region is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. Compared to other mid-sized communities, Saginaw has a high number of patent applications per job, and more than 81 times the average US share of jobs in photovoltaic technology research and production. The city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the US average.[36]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 18.10 square miles (46.88 km2), of which, 17.34 square miles (44.91 km2) is land and 0.76 square miles (1.97 km2) is water.[37] Saginaw lies on the Saginaw River, 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Saginaw Bay, an arm of Lake Huron. The city sits in the middle of the Saginaw Bay watershed, the largest in the state of Michigan. It includes the largest contiguous fresh-water coastal wetland in the United States.[38]\n\nNeighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nThe City of Saginaw consists of many diverse neighborhoods,[39] including:\n\nDowntown\n\nOld Town[40][41]\n\nSouthwest Village[39]\n\nNorthmoor[42]\n\nHeritage Square[43]\n\nCathedral District[44]\n\nHoughton Jones Neighborhood[45]\n\nSouth East Side[39]\n\nTriangle Parks[39]\n\nSt. Stephen's Area[39]\n\nBrockway-Carmen Park[39]\n\nButman-Fish Neighborhood[39]\n\nRedeemer Area[39]\n\nSaginaw High Neighborhood[39]\n\nNortheast Side[46]\n\nCovenant Neighborhood[47]\n\nNorthwest Neighborhood[39]\n\nSheridan Park[48]\n\nThe Woods[49]\n\nAdams Boulevard Area [50]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw has a humid continental climate influenced by its inland position not on the shore of one of the Great Lakes of Michigan.[51]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18601,699—18707,460339.1%188010,52541.1%189046,322340.1%190042,345−8.6%191050,51019.3%192061,90322.6%193080,71530.4%194082,7942.6%195092,91812.2%196098,2655.8%197091,849−6.5%198077,508−15.6%199069,512−10.3%200061,799−11.1%201051,508−16.7%202044,202−14.2%2023 (est.)43,185−2.3%\n\nSaginaw is the largest principal city of the Saginaw-Midland-Bay City, MI CSA, a Combined Statistical Area that includes the Saginaw-Saginaw Township North (Saginaw County), Midland (Midland County), and Bay City (Bay County) metropolitan areas,[58][59] which had a combined population of 377,474 at the 2020 census.\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw city, Michigan – Racial and Ethnic Composition\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic)\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 General Motors plants, an Eaton Manufacturing plant (demolished 2008) where 5,000 people produced auto parts,[62] and numerous smaller concerns.\n\nThe General Motors plants in the county were:\n\nThe original Jackson-Wilcox factory on Saginaw's North Hamilton (ca. 1906), later Saginaw Steering Gear Plant 1, closed 1984,[63] sold by GM in 1987 to Thomson Industries, still operating as of 2009.[21]\n\nChevrolet Saginaw Parts at Sixth and Washington on Saginaw's East Side, built in 1906 as the assembly plant of the Rainier Motor Car Company, acquired by GM in 1907. Closed 1983, demolished 1984.[64]\n\nSaginaw Malleable Iron on the Southwest Side (1917). Contracted to build gear housings for GM's Jacox division (the former Jackson Wilcox company, later Saginaw Steering Gear), sold to GM in 1919, later part of Saginaw Products Division, reorganized into a new Central Foundry Division in 1946.[23] Closed May 2007,[65] razed in 2010 and for sale as of May 2013 by the RACER Trust, charged with disposing of abandoned GM properties.\n\nChevrolet Grey Iron, on the North Side of Saginaw, opened as Central Foundry in 1918, operated by Chevrolet Division 1927–1983, thereafter by GM Powertrain Division. Operating today as Saginaw Metal Casting Operations,[24] the only GM manufacturing division still operating in Saginaw County.\n\nChevrolet Saginaw Transmission on East Genesee in Saginaw, built 1919–20 for the Michigan Crankshaft Company, acquired by GM in 1921 and placed under Saginaw Products. Transferred to Chevrolet upon the dissolution of the Crankshaft Division (ca. 1927). Home of the Saginaw 3-speed and 4-speed manual transmissions. Transferred to the Delco Moraine Division in 1984, which became Delphi Automotive in 1995. After 2007, leased and later purchased outright by TRW Automotive, operating as TRW Braking and Suspension[66] until closing in February 2014.[67]\n\nSaginaw Steering Gear Plant 2, the \"Gun Plant\" (see below) adjacent to Malleable Iron; opened March 1941, closed July 2001, razed 2002.[68] For sale by RACER Trust as of May 2013.\n\nThe 400-acre Saginaw Steering Gear complex in Buena Vista Township. Plant 3 opened 1953 next to the then-new US-23 bypass, adding Plants 4, 5 and 6 by 1966 and a seventh shortly thereafter. Later known as Saginaw Division, then part of Delphi, sold in 2010 to Nexteer Corporation,[62] is supplying GM, Ford and Chrysler as of 2013.[69]\n\nChevrolet Nodular Iron in Buena Vista Township, built 1964–1965, entered production 1967, announced for closure 1986, closed 1988; since demolished.[63][70] Property for sale by RACER Trust as of May 2013.\n\nThe Saginaw metropolitan area's main shopping district is located in neighboring Saginaw Township along Bay Road and Tittabawassee Road north of town, where several big box stores and regional restaurant chains can be found. Also in the same area is Fashion Square Mall, a regional shopping mall anchored by JCPenney and Macy's. Primary areas within the city of Saginaw for consumer shopping include Old Town and downtown.\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw's entertainment hub can be found in the downtown area, where venues such as The Dow Event Center and the restored Temple Theatre offer live entertainment. The Saginaw Bay Symphony Orchestra and Saginaw Choral Society are housed in the Temple and each of these organizations performs a full concert series annually at the Temple venue. The Saginaw Historical Society is also located downtown in an elaborate castle. Nearby, the Saginaw Art Museum boasts an impressive permanent collection and recently underwent a massive renovation. The Celebration Square area of downtown boasts an authentic Japanese Tea House, the only one of its kind in Michigan. The Andersen Enrichment Center and Rose Gardens are another attraction in Celebration Square offering ongoing art exhibits, a summer jazz concert series, and winter and summer art fairs. Numerous other arts and cultural organizations serve the community including the Saginaw Arts & Enrichment Commission, Eddy Band, Holidays in the Heart of the City, River Junction Poets, Theodore Roethke House of Poetry, Riverside Film Festival, Lawn Chair Film Festival, Friday Night Live Concerts, River Junction Poets and Saginaw Area Watercolor Society. The Dow Event Center is home to the city's junior ice hockey team, the Saginaw Spirit of the Ontario Hockey League as well as the Saginaw Sting, an indoor football team.\n\nDowntown Saginaw has undergone a resurgence with locally-owned restaurants and coffee shops dotting the area. The downtown Saginaw area contains several office buildings from the late 19th century and early 20th century. They are located near the Saginaw Club, a social club founded in 1889. In December 2016 \"The Gallery: Art For Saginaw\" opened in the newly redeveloped downtown. At roughly 5,000 square feet it is one of the largest public art galleries in Michigan. The Downtown Farmer's Market offers Michigan produce, flowers, and baked goods from local bakeries and will be moving to an indoor permanent location in 2017. Downtown is not to be confused with the Old Town/West Side City area located on the other side of the river and about one mile (1.6 km) southwest. Old Town has many popular bars, locally owned restaurants, and businesses. The city's roster of local arts organizations includes Pit and Balcony, one of the oldest continuously operating community theaters in the United States, founded in 1932.[71]\n\nParks and museums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Castle Museum of Saginaw County History is an important and prominent museum in downtown Saginaw. The museum is housed in a former post office which was built to resemble a castle, and pays homage to the historical French heritage of the area. With more than 100,000 artifacts in its collection, the Historical Society of Saginaw County displays items from their collection as well as those of traveling exhibits.[72]\n\nThe Andersen Enrichment Center and Lucille E. Andersen Memorial Rose Garden are part of Saginaw's park system. The facility is used to host private and public events throughout the year. These events include Hollyday Art Fair, Art & Garden Festival, the SAWA Fall Watercolor Exhibition, Jazz in the Rose Garden and Art @ the Andersen[73] and a World AIDS Day service[74] The garden includes a fountain with a sculpture by Marshall Fredericks.\n\nThe Saginaw Art Museum hosts temporary exhibitions and permanent collections. The museum also houses The John and Michele Bueker Research Library and Archives of Michigan Art. The museum originated as the home of C.L. Ring who commissioned Charles A. Platt to design the house and gardens. The museum opened to the public in 1948. The museum is a Smithsonian Institution affiliate.[75]\n\nSaginaw is home to a Japanese Cultural Center, Tea House and Garden, as a result of its 52-year Sister-City relationship with Tokushima, Japan. The Garden was completed in 1971. The Tea House, known as Saginaw Awa An, completed in 1986, is considered to be one of the ten most authentic Tea Houses outside the country of Japan. The site is open from April through October and offers traditional tea ceremonies by appointment, and on the second Saturday of each month. Each year in September a Japan Festival is held in the garden, featuring authentic Japanese singers, dancers, and performers, and offering demonstrations of Japanese Culture to those in attendance, including flower arranging, calligraphy, origami, and authentic Japanese cuisine, such as sushi and other dishes.[citation needed]\n\nThe city is also home to the Theodore Roethke Home Museum, a National Literary Landmark. The museum honors one of America's greatest 20th-century poets, who was born and raised in Saginaw.[citation needed]\n\nOjibway Island in the Saginaw River is home to Rust Park and the Ojibway Island City Park Amphitheater.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Saginaw area is home to a major junior hockey team and one NCAA Division-II school that has various sports programs. The Saginaw Spirit is an Ontario Hockey League team that became nationally known when television personality Stephen Colbert promoted the team on his show, The Colbert Report.[76] The Spirit hosted and won the 2024 Memorial Cup. Saginaw Sting was an indoor football team that formed in 2007 to play in Saginaw beginning in the 2008 season and is currently on hiatus.[77] At the collegiate level, Saginaw Valley State University competes in numerous sports such as American Football, Basketball, and Volleyball.[78]\n\nTeam Sport League Year founded Venue Saginaw Spirit Ice hockey Ontario Hockey League 2002 Dow Event Center Saginaw Valley State University Various Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 1963 SVSU Campus\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Government of Saginaw, Michigan\n\nSaginaw is classified as a Home Rule City under the Michigan Home Rule Cities Act adopting its own City Charter giving its city a council-manager form of government. The present Charter was adopted in 1935 and took effect on January 6, 1936. Pursuant to the City Charter, Saginaw is governed by a nine-member elected at-large Council. The term of office for a member of the City Council is four years commencing with the first meeting following a regular municipal election. The terms are staggered so the entire Council is not subject to re-election at the same time—either four or five members are elected in each odd-numbered year. The city levies an income tax of 1.5 percent on residents and 0.75 percent on nonresidents.[79]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Saginaw is served by the Saginaw Public School District, also known as SPSD. The Saginaw Public School District operates twelve elementary schools, two combined elementary/middle schools, two middle schools, one combined middle/high school, and two high schools. The district is governed by a seven-member elected board of education. The board selects a superintendent for the district. The current superintendent is Mr. Nathan Mcclain.[80] The three public high schools in Saginaw are Arthur Hill High School, Saginaw High School, and the Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy. Michigan Lutheran Seminary is the lone private high school in the city. Charter schools in the city are Saginaw Learn to Earn Academy, North Saginaw Charter Academy, Francis Reh Academy, Saginaw Prep schools, and the International Academy of Saginaw.\n\nHigher education\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw is served by Delta College and Saginaw Valley State University, which are located in nearby University Center, Michigan. Central Michigan University maintains an off-campus center inside the city that offers numerous degree programs. Delta College built a downtown satellite facility that opened in the fall of 2019.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision stations\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw is part of Nielsen's Flint-Saginaw-Bay City-Midland Designated Market Area which is the 66th largest market in the United States for Television Viewers.[81] Saginaw is the home of CBS affiliate WNEM which maintains its studios and offices inside the city though its license is for Bay City, MI.[82] ABC affiliate WJRT maintains its offices and newsrooms in Saginaw while its studios are in its community of license, Flint.[83] Only NBC affiliate WEYI and Christian station WAQP have the City of Saginaw as their city of record but both maintain their facilities outside of the city.[84][85] Charter Communications operates a cable television network servicing the City of Saginaw under a franchise agreement.\n\nTelevision stations in the Saginaw, Michigan area (Ascending order) Channel Call letters Description Comments 5 WNEM-TV CBS affiliate Licensed to Bay City; studios in Saginaw 12 WJRT-TV ABC affiliate Based and licensed in Flint 19 WDCQ-TV PBS member station Licensed to Bad Axe; studios at Delta College in University Center 24 W24DL-D 3ABN affiliate Based and licensed in Saginaw; programmed via satellite 25 WEYI-TV NBC affiliate Licensed to Saginaw; studios in Clio 46 WBSF CW affiliate Licensed to Bay City; studios in Clio 49 WAQP TCT O&O affiliate Based and licensed in Saginaw 66 WSMH Fox affiliate Based and licensed in Flint\n\nRadio stations\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw and Saginaw Township are home to the three major radio station clusters serving the Greater Tri Cities.

Freight and passenger routes radiated to Bay City to the north, Port Huron to the east, Toledo to the south, Grand Rapids and Chicago to the southwest and Ludington to the west.[88][89][90] Grand Trunk Railroad ran trains from Bay City through Saginaw to Durand, for connections to Chicago, Detroit, Port Huron and Toronto.[91] Most passenger routes were discontinued during the 1950s. The last route to Potter Street Station was in 1950. The station was designated a historic site in 1991.[92] The last New York Central Railroad train (formerly Michigan Central Railroad) departed the Genesee Street Station bound for Detroit in 1964. Today, Saginaw hosts the headquarters of the Lake State Railway who continues to operate trains out of the massive former Pere Marquette Saginaw Yard to destinations that include Midland, Bay City, and Plymouth. The Huron and Eastern Railway operates the former GTW mainline through the city, which intersects with Lake State's Midland Line at Mershon Junction. HESR also operates several lines east into the thumb region towards Vassar and Reese. The Mid-Michigan Railroad plays a bit part in the region as well, interchanging with Lake State at Paines, west of the city. The Saginaw Railway Museum, located on the west side of the city, continues to work towards the preservation of the Saginaw Bay area's railroading history.[93]\n\nSaginaw is served primarily by two airports: MBS International Airport, located in nearby Freeland, and Bishop International Airport, located in Flint. Saginaw is also served by three smaller airports: Harry W. Browne Airport in adjacent Buena Vista Township, James Clements Municipal Airport in Bay City, and Jack Barstow Municipal Airport in Midland.\n\nInterstate 75 (I-75) serves as the main arterial route for the Saginaw area while I-675 provides direct access to the center of the city from I-75. I-69 is a nearby east–west corridor providing access to the rest of the Midwestern United States and Canada. The Saginaw River runs through the middle of the city and provides access to Saginaw Bay and the rest of the Great Lakes via docks on the northern side of the city.\n\nIn the city and surrounding areas, mass transit is provided by bus under the authority of the Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) system.[94] The STARS system connects to Bay City's Bus system at Saginaw Valley State University.\n\nIntercity Bus Service is Provided by Indian Trails, which operates a bus station on the east side of the river.[citation needed]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nI-75 passes along the eastern side of the city through Buena Vista Charter Township.\n\nI-675 provides a short freeway loop through downtown Saginaw and back to I-75 through Saginaw Charter Township.\n\nM-13 runs from I-69 through downtown Saginaw and north to Standish.\n\nM-46 is a cross-peninsular road, running across the mitten and the thumb—from Port Sanilac on the Lake Huron shore, through Saginaw, and then on to Muskegon on the Lake Michigan shore.[95] This east–west surface route nearly bisects the Lower Peninsula of Michigan latitudinally.\n\nM-47 passes through the western suburbs and provides a direct connection to MBS International Airport.\n\nM-52 runs from the Ohio border through Adrian and Owosso before ending at M-46, in the western suburbs of Saginaw. M-52 also provides an alternate connection to Lansing, Michigan's state capitol.\n\nM-58 runs from M-47 to I-675.\n\nM-81 runs east from M-13 to Caro and Cass City and ends at M-53 in Sanilac County.\n\nM-84 runs from downtown Bay City to M-58 in Saginaw.\n\nUtilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe City of Saginaw gets its electricity and natural gas from Consumers Energy.\n\nIn 1929, the city opened its consolidated water works plant which replaced two separate plants that were on each side of the Saginaw river. This plant treated water brought in from the Saginaw river and piped it out to the residents as well as corner pumps for people that did not have direct connections to the system.[96] Currently, the City of Saginaw jointly owns with the City of Midland the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation. Incorporated in 1946, this water treatment system has supplied drinking and industrial water to both cities and many surrounding areas within the county.[97] Due to brackish water in the aquifers below both cities, a 65-mile-long (105 km) pipeline was constructed in 1948 to supply water from Lake Huron at White Stone Point, north of Au Gres to water treatment plants in Saginaw and Midland[96] with a second pipe added by 1996. This system has played a role in the decline of the city. The City of Saginaw, in order to obtain new sources of revenue, sold water to areas outside of the city (especially to the Saginaw Charter Township). This caused numerous businesses inside the city to leave for the surrounding areas and development in the city to stagnate.[citation needed] The City of Midland, however, adopted a policy of \"No Annexation, No Water\" which has led to the growth of the city as well as the surrounding areas.[97]\n\nHealthcare\n\n[edit]\n\nAleda E. Lutz Veterans Affairs Medical Center, located at 1500 Weiss, is a hospital serving America's Veterans overseen by the Veterans Health Administration. It has 100 staffed beds and sees 292,000 patients a year.[98]\n\nCovenant Medical Center, located at 1447 North Harrison, is a 623-bed hospital with inpatient and outpatient facilities including an emergency department that provides 95,000 visits per year and is the region's primary trauma center. Lifenet offers helicopter air ambulance services from the Covenant campus.\n\nMary Free Bed and Covenant HealthCare combined their expertise to establish Mary Free Bed at Covenant HealthCare, aiming to provide advanced rehabilitation services to the Great Lakes Bay Region. The collaboration leverages the strengths of both organizations to offer specialized care and state-of-the-art rehabilitation technology. The partnership became operational in 2018, later investing in the Saginaw community with a new $40.7M building in 2021.[99] [100]\n\nIt is the location for \"CMU Medical Education Partners\", which offers various residency training programs.[101] It also offers walk-in clinics and facilities scattered throughout the county for outpatient surgery, breast cancer diagnosis, physical therapy, sports medicine and eye care.\n\nAscension Saint Mary's of Michigan, located at 800 South Washington, is a hospital with approximately 225 staffed beds and sees 168,000 patients a year.[98] St. Mary's treats trauma, heart disease, and cancer among other ailments, and opened its Ambulatory Care Center in Saginaw Township in 2000 featuring the county's first suburban emergency room.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nSaginaw is referred to in the Brian D'Arcy James song: \"Michigan Christmas\".
