The Site Plan is a plan, drawn to scale, showing the layout of proposed uses and structures.\n\nThe purpose of a Site Plan Review is to promote the orderly development of the City, the stability of land values and investments, and the general welfare and to help prevent the impairment or depreciation of land values and development by the erection of structures or additions or alterations thereto without proper attention to siting and appearance. Before the erection of any building or structure, in any zoning district in the City and any land use requiring special approval or any planned unit development, a site plan shall be submitted for review and approval. This review and approval shall be performed by the Chief Inspector or by the City Planning Commission as follows:\n\nSite Plan Review by the Chief Inspector\n\nResidential structures having four or fewer dwelling units and accessory buildings, structures and uses thereto.\n\nA change in the use of a structure or land that does not require additional parking and does not involve exterior structural alterations.\n\nAn accessory building containing less than 1,000 square feet\n\nAn addition to an existing structure if such addition totals 25% or less of the floor area of the existing structure; and only if the exterior of the addition will be surfaced with material or materials which do not differ from material or materials on the existing structure.\n\nSite Plan Review by the City Planning Commission\n\nAll other structures and uses of land or buildings shall be reviewed by the City Planning Commission.\n\nSite Plan Review Procedure\n\nTo request site plan approval, contact:"
