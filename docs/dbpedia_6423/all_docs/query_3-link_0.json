Dow has changed the name to The Dow Event Center.\n\nFor almost three years, at the direction of Saginaw County, SMG in cooperation with Saginaw Spirit Hockey Club, LLC, has sought to strengthen the financial position of the Event Center with a naming rights sponsor. The Saginaw County Building Authority and the County Board of Commissioners today voted to award the sponsorship to Dow. The cost of the sponsorship is $250,000 per year, for 10 years.\n\n\"Saginaw County leaders feel this naming sponsorship will have many positive benefits for the area,\" according to Marc McGill, Saginaw County Controller. \"We are confident the new name will encourage growth in the area and entice additional businesses to move to downtown Saginaw. The County, SMG and the Spirit agreed from the start that a naming rights sponsor would be a big boost for the financial stability of the Center.\"\n\nThe County, SMG and the Spirit looked for a naming sponsor that was local, and a Fortune 500 Company that makes products in America that improve the quality of life for area residents. Dow fit all of the requirements.\n\nAndrew Liveris, Dow president and COO, said the sponsorship enhances a long tradition of company support for mid-Michigan. \"Going into our third year as a sponsor of the Saginaw Spirit and with about 30 percent of our employees and retirees residing in the Saginaw/Bay area, we wanted to reinforce our commitment by investing in a facility that is very important to our community.\"\n\nWith the internationally-known Dow name associated with the Event Center, facility manager SMG expects exceptional benefits.\"An association of this nature further legitimizes the facility as a regional sports and entertainment destination and The Dow Event Center will now join the ranks of other complexes such as Comerica Park, Ford Field, Pepsi Arena, and many others that attract world class entertainment,\" said Allan Vella, SMG general manager.\n\n\"We are excited about the commitment Dow is showing by supporting the community and the Event Center,\" said Dick Garber, Ontario Hockey League Governor and owner of the Saginaw Spirit Hockey Club. \"Having a naming rights sponsor will help ensure not only local OHL hockey but quality entertainment for the foreseeable future. This is a very positive contribution of quality of life for all residents in Mid-Michigan.\"\n\nThe new naming rights sponsorship adds to a succession of positive enhancements to the former Civic Center. The rejuvenation for the Event Center began in 2001 when the community supported a millage for renovations. Soon after, the County hired SMG as the facility manager and since then, the Saginaw Spirit hockey club became a major tenant. A two-phase renovation project that began in 2001 was recently completed.\n\nASM Global was formed in October 2019 from the merger of AEG Facilities , the global innovator in live entertainment venues, and SMG, the gold standard in event management. ASM Global is a venue management powerhouse that spans 5 continents, 14 countries and more than 300 of the world's most prestigious arenas, stadiums, convention and exhibit centers, and performing arts venues. As the world's most trusted venue manager, ASM Global provides venue strategy and management, sales, marketing, event booking and programming, construction and design consulting, and pre-opening services. Among the venues in our portfolio are landmark facilities such as McCormick Place & Soldier Field in Chicago, the Log Angeles Convention Center, Tele2 Arena in Stockholm, the Mercedez-Benz Superdome in New Orleans and the Shenzhen World Exhibition and Conference Centre in Shenzhen, China. ASM Global also offers food and beverage options through its concessions and catering companies.\n\nThe Dow Event Center Facility History\n\nThe Saginaw Civic Center was built in 1972 by the City of Saginaw. The Civic Center was composed of three main parts: Wendler Arena, Heritage Theater,and Unity Hall.\n\nSince 1972, the Center has served Saginaw County and the surrounding region as a first-class event venue. The Center has offered all County residents hundreds of entertainment, sport, cultural and educational opportunities annually.\n\nIn 2000, Spicer Engineering of Saginaw conducted an Engineering Study of the entire facility and the cost of repairs and maintenance for updating the facility was estimated. Estimates for repairs on the facility came in at $17 million and included repairs and enhancements to lighting, seating, restroom facilities, sound systems, roofing, and loading docks. They were also asked to present the costs associated with building a similar facility somewhere else within the County. It was estimated that it would take $69 million to build such a facility elsewhere. SMG was chosen as the management group to run the newly-dubbed County Event Center.\n\nOn June 30, 2001, the City of Saginaw closed the Saginaw Civic Center. The voters of Saginaw County decided on May 8, 2001, to reopen the facility on July 1, 2001, as the Saginaw County Event Center. SMG has managed the facility with the oversight of the Saginaw County Building Authority and an Event Center Advisory Group. The $850,000 subsidy was reduced by almost half in the first three years of operation.\n\nThe Garber Management Group purchased an Ontario Hockey League team in early 2002. The team was named the Saginaw Spirit and Wendler Arena became its new home. Over 30 home games are played by the Saginaw Spirit in Wendler Arena every year, adding another dimension to the Event Center.\n\nDow Chemical Company of Midland was awarded naming rights to the facility in September 2004. The agreement was mutually beneficial; Dow was able to support a worthy community endeavor and the Event Center was given an internationally recognized name to help draw performers and shows. All of these forces should keep The Dow Event Center a vital part of the Saginaw community for years to come.\n\nASM Global was formed in October 2019 from the merger of AEG Facilities , the global innovator in live entertainment venues, and SMG, the gold standard in event management. ASM Global is a venue management powerhouse that spans 5 continents, 14 countries and more than 300 of the world's most prestigious arenas, stadiums, convention and exhibit centers, and performing arts venues.

ASM Global also offers food and beverage options through its concessions and catering companies.\n\nJolt Credit Union Event Park Facility History\n\nBuilding The Event Park\n\nThe Dow Event Center, an ASM Global managed facility, announced on February 7, 2013, at a press conference along with Saginaw County & Great Lakes Bay Region Convention & Visitors Bureau plans to develop an outdoor event venue in the 300 block of Downtown Saginaw, where the Saginaw Center once stood. The venue, which would include a Pavilion, a main stage and a grassy area, as well as 225 parking spaces (400 block), was designed to attract a wide range of events and draw people to Downtown Saginaw.\n\nThe Pavilion provides a safe and economical place in the community for people of all ages and scopes from around the region to gather for a wide variety of events, performances, festivals and markets. It benefits the ‘sense of community’ feeling in Downtown Saginaw and also contributes to increased economic growth in the area.\n\nFunding to build the Pavilion was estimated at $1.275 million. Additional funding was secured through Grants, Foundations, and Sponsorships including a Naming Rights sponsor for the venue.\n\nSMG Awards FirstMerit Bank Naming Rights For Event Park\n\nSMG announced the awarding of naming rights to the Event Park to FirstMerit Bank on May 2, 2013. The FirstMerit Event Park opened mid-August 2013. The 5,500-seat FirstMerit Event Park provided both pavilion and lawn seating for a variety of events meant to enrich the Great Lakes Bay Region. Events such as the second annual Wonderfest on August 24, 2013, and Fall In for Arts and Sol on September 28, 2013 were some of the first events held there. FirstMerit secured naming rights for the next five years.\n\nEvent Park Changes Names\n\nFirstMerit Bank announced the changing of the Event Park's name on February 20, 2017 to Huntington Event Park as a result of the bank changing their name respectfully. As of April 12, 2022, Huntington Event Event park became known as Jolt Credit Union Event Park after another respectful name change after more than five years.\n\nAbout ASM Global\n\nASM Global was formed in October 2019 from the merger of AEG Facilities , the global innovator in live entertainment venues, and SMG, the gold standard in event management.
