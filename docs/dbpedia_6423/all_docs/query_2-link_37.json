        "text": "SAM\n\nFAMILY BASED CARE AND YOUTH TRANSITION\n\nSuccess to me is when you have all of your goals planned out and you are fulfilling your dreams without letting anyone get in the way. With every challenge I have faced in my life, I feel that it has taken part in shaping a better me. Growing up, the challenge was tackling each day, living each day. Now, I face each day seeing how it will shape my future. For me, I would like to learn how to build a car from scratch, and one day own my own mechanic shop. When you feel that you have achieved success, you are more likely to help someone achieve their dreams too.\n\nI have a lot of dreams, but most notably, having a family. I want to be a good dad for my future children. It is a big responsibility, but I want to teach my kids a lot of things and be a good role model for them. Good foster dads, in the past, were those who had the time to get to know their foster child, build a bond with them and help them work through their problems.\n\nI have been at Holy Cross for 11 months. Holy Cross is different because they have helped me where other places could not. They give you a lot of support through your struggles, so you are ready for the real world. They give you the opportunity to work with others and see the struggles others are going through. Through this, you are able to look in the mirror and put yourself in someone else’s shoes, and realize that you are not alone.\n\nIn the New Year, I am looking forward to the positive things that will come my way when I come out of Holy Cross, and continue the positive direction of shaping my future for the better.\n\nClick here to learn more about Family-Based Care and Youth Transition\n\nSusan Rosas\n\nPRESIDENT & CEO\n\nMy family’s story inspired me to enter the child welfare field early on in my career. What started as fact-finding to understand my family’s experience turned into my life’s work. I’ve worked directly in field, led service programs across the country, directed national-scale systems change here and internationally, and coached executives to do the same. I’ve worked in many social service systems, including in Miami, New York, Chicago, across Texas, federal child welfare, and in Cambodia. I hold a master’s degree in Social Service Administration from the University of Chicago, an undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Miami, and a variety of clinical, financial, and executive leadership certifications.\n\nIt is remarkable to me that no matter who you are, where you are, it’s relational connection that allows for safety and success. We all have that person we can point to who kept us, or got us, out of trouble. People do a lot of hard work to overcome trauma, but that recovery journey always starts with relationship. I’ve dedicated my career to building the space for that connection: helping family members heal one another, helping children and adults from hard places pursue the future they want for themselves, creating a safety net for when we stumble on the way. I am so thrilled to be a part of HCS, not just because of our incredible history and impact across Michigan, but because this team has the heart to help people find safety and strength through connection.\n\nJoy at work: If I had to pick one thing, it’s the every-day impact. Budgets, policies, protocols, contracts, data, fundraising – every ounce of effort has a distinctly human result. I can picture how Monday will get kids home faster, how Tuesday will help staff with work-life balance, how Wednesday will get more people into a safe, warm bed at night, and so on. Every moment is so meaningful.\n\nJoy at home: I have an incredible partner who infuses joy into everything he does. Our two boys are curious and hilarious and kind. Though my career took me all over the place, I grew up in Grand Rapids, where much of my family still resides. I am so very grateful to be back and surrounded by family.\n\nContact: srosas@hccsnet.org\n\nMichael Alm\n\nCHIEF FACILITIES AND SAFETY OFFICER\n\nBorn in Detroit and raised in a family that was nearly all employed by the auto industry with strong Christian values. He attended the Center for Creative Studies and Oakland University, pursing a degree in Business Management, while working in the retail field, managing an office supply chain store.\n\nMike made a career change by entering the construction field where he found a strong interest.

For three years, I dealt with my depression by using drugs and alcohol.\n\nBut one day, I looked in the mirror and said I’ve had enough. My daughter always tells me: “Mom, you’re the best. Just stop drinking.” So, I finally called around looking for help and found Holy Cross Services.\n\nThey helped me deal with the root cause of my problems. In addition to depression, I also suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. After months of work with the staff here, they’ve helped me cope with both my issues, as well as the drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nI’m doing very well and am looking forward to getting my daughter back. I want to be the absolute best mom for my little girl and I’m proud of myself for getting clean. I’m here to quit drinking and be the best mom I can be. I want a great future with my little girl.\n\nAt Holy Cross it’s not just about rehabilitation for substance abuse. They look at all the other factors in your life that are causing the addictions. They have great nurses here, great therapists. All the staff are fantastic.\n\nI’m so happy to be here. When I lost my daughter, I wasn’t healing. I was masking the pain. With the therapists and the people here, I’ve been able to get healthy.\n\nClick here to learn more about Family-Based Care and Youth Transition\n\nROBERT\n\nFAMILY BASED CARE & YOUTH TRANSITION\n\nMy family situation had never been a healthy environment for me. My family had never been there for me, emotionally, and I struggled in almost all aspects of my life.\n\nBut then I took matters into my own hands and got myself out of that situation by calling the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. I’ve been with Holy Cross Services for three years now and I have all the support I need to succeed.\n\nThey helped me deal with the root cause of my problems. In addition to depression, I also suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. After months of work with the staff here, they’ve helped me cope with both my issues, as well as the drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nIn my time here, I’ve learned everyone has to take responsibility for their actions and deal with issues one step at a time. Before coming here, I never paid attention in school because I didn’t have control of my life. Now I take classes, and my life, seriously.\n\nI now have a plan to go to college or a trade school. I couldn’t have done that without Holy Cross. The people here are genuine and the programs work really well. I look forward to going to school and beginning a life that I control.\n\nClick here to learn more about Family-Based Care and Youth Transition\n\nALLI\n\nFAMILY BASED CARE AND YOUTH TRANSITION\n\nMy name is Alli, I’m 16, and I am part of the Foster Care Program at Holy Cross. During my time here, I have gotten a lot of support from the staff who have always been open to help me with anything. I have really grown as a person and received a lot of encouragement to set goals and work for them.\n\nMy hero is my big sister Maya. We’ve always been really close and we look out for each other. She inspires me because she is the only one in my family who graduated from high school and went to college. She’s the person I look up to and I want to be like her. She is the hardest worker I know. Next year, I am going to graduate high school, and my dream is to go to Eastern College and study to be a nurse. I love working with other people and helping the community around me. The best compliment I received is that I am caring and I’m always looking out for people. Being a nurse would give me the chance to help patients every day of my life.\n\nEven when things get tough, I’m really proud of myself for being able to get through them no matter what. I’ve learned how to work well with others and to fix problems. The biggest misconception people have of foster kids is that they think that we need all this extra help and can’t look out for ourselves, but we have goals and we’re here to better ourselves too. We need people supporting us and giving us the resources to achieve our goals, and most importantly to believe that we can do anything.\n\nPeople also sometimes assume that everyone in foster care has the same situation and problems. But we all have very different experiences and everyone is unique. I’ve gotten to meet people at Holy Cross from many different races, cultures, and backgrounds, and I am just thankful for my group of friends that I’ve met here. There is a lot of diversity and there’s more to us than just being foster kids.\n\nClick here to learn more about Family-Based Care and Youth Transition\n\nWILL\n\nRESIDENTIAL AND FAMILY HEALING\n\nMy name is Will, I’m 16 years old and I have been at St. Vincent home for about a year now. The reason I’m here is because my mother is in a nursing home after suffering a major overdose, and my father’s in prison – but he’ll be out in July. It’s hard having a family that uses. I remember there were a lot of times my Dad and Uncles overdosed. Seeing them being taken care of by doctors was one of the scariest things I’ve ever seen – I don’t think that memory will ever go away.\n\nWhen I lived with my parents, we lived in a home where they had a meth lab going. My grandma had a few strokes so she couldn’t take care of me either. I felt like I had no one. After everything happened and I first came to Holy Cross I was a mess. I had D’s and E’s in all of my classes and I just wasn’t focusing. But the more I worked with the staff the better I got. A light bulb went off in my head and I realized I could accomplish good things. My attitude is better, and I feel better because of it.\n\nI’m getting all A’s now. That’s a great feeling because now it feels like I actually can have a future. My goal is to be an architect or a civil litigator. I’m going to be staying at Holy Cross until I can get into a good foster home, but they have been great to me. They inspired me to do the best I can and that my opportunities are limitless.\n\nClick here to learn more about Residential and Family Healing\n\nTIMOTHY\n\nRESIDENTIAL AND FAMILY HEALING\n\nUntil I came to Holy Cross, I felt hopeless when I just wanted a second chance at life. With my experience being in and out of home, I felt like foster kids were always given up and don’t get many chances at making a good life for themselves, and that really upset me.\n\nAt age 16, I was a ‘bad egg’. I was very bad, but through my process at Holy Cross I was never once given up on. They had faith in me, and provided me with the second chance I had been looking for. I don’t know where I would be now if it wasn’t for Holy Cross.\n\nMy life has completely turned around since coming here. I feel like I improved immensely, because the workers actually care about you. A lot of other places will just see you as a dollar figure, but Holy Cross sees you as individual. When you need help, they’re there.\n\nClick here to learn more about Residential and Family Healing\n\nANDREA\n\nRESIDENTIAL AND FAMILY HEALING\n\nHoly Cross has been very different from the other four homes I’ve been to. Here you have people that come in 24 hours and day and and make it their goal to help you. Also, with the peers inside of the youth group, we don’t know who we are in a group with. We are here for a certain reason, and it’s good to learn and grow together. It’s so nice to be with people with similar needs and backgrounds. Here at Holy Cross, I feel like I don’t have to hide who I am and that’s an incredible feeling.\n\nHoly Cross also knows how to treat us. People tend to think that kids in foster home are needy and don’t have normal lives like everyone else. They don’t think of us like that. They treat us like who we are – normal kids who are just having a hard time in life.\n\nThat’s what else is great about the staff here. They don’t pretend like everything is okay when we first arrive. They understand that this is a very hard process. They sit us down and ask, ‘Are you okay?’. The staff actually care about us, and understand that it isn’t easy to adapt right away.\n\nI’ve really enjoyed my experience here. As a teenage it’s hard to get in foster homes because people want the young ones they can raise. At Holy Cross, they guide us through our teen years, and work on getting us through high school and hopefully in to college. Next year, I’m looking forward to getting my own apartment, going to college and being able to travel. Holy Cross even helps us with that, as they give you opportunities and funds to meet your future life goals. I want to own my own business one day, and Holy Cross gives me the confidence to know that one day I’m going to make this happen, and be successful.\n\nHoly Cross has really made a huge impact on my life. I would like to tell anyone else out there who feels alone and out of place that Holy Cross is the place to be. Here you can come and work on learning different skills so when you’re finally out on your own you’re prepared!\n\nClick here to learn more about Residential and Family Healing\n\nDANE\n\nRESIDENTIAL AND FAMILY HEALING\n\nMy name is Dane and I’m 17 years old. I’ve been at Holy Cross for two and a half months and I come from an adopted family. People think that foster kids don’t have anyone and that there isn’t anything out there for them, but it’s the exact opposite. I am thankful for my adopted family and my real family, and for the support that I’ve gotten from the Holy Cross staff that I needed to better myself.\n\nThe program has been helping me a lot, especially with school. My goal is to finish high school and get all my credits so that I can go to college and play football as well. I have been putting in a lot of effort into my schoolwork and hope that I can get the chance to receive an athletic scholarship or get recruited. It would be dream come true to play for a varsity team and I am working to achieve this.\n\nAnother goal of mine is to one day start up a local family restaurant. I want to make people happy and give them a place to enjoy a meal at the table with their family and friends. Being able to have that experience with family is very important to me and I would like to accomplish that in the future. It’s an idea I think about often.\n\nOne thing I’m looking forward to when I look older is starting a family. I think a lot about the kind of dad I would want to be to my kids. I want to show them the way and give them everything they need. I want to teach them that there is always a way out of a difficult situation. A good father is someone who cares and wants to help his children, be there for them, and love them no matter what, and I hope I can be that father with my kids one day.\n\nDuring the two and a half months that I’ve been here, the staff have given me advice on everything and helped me to think twice before I do anything. They have helped me find ways to express and talk about my feelings and have given me tools to use. I’ve learned not to be angry at the world and to do what I need to do to make it a better place for myself and the people I care about by using my struggles and experiences to help others. I am learning that being successful means being myself. The staff at Holy Cross have taught me the importance of setting short term and long term goals to help me be successful in who I am.\n\nClick here to learn more about Residential and Family Healing\n\nSheldon Persons\n\nHuman Resource Manager\n\nHi, I’m Sheldon, Human Resource Manager at Holy Cross Services.

I started as a Youth Care Worker and was promoted to Shift Supervisor. While working at the detention center, I was an active board member for the Michigan Juvenile Detention Association. My responsibility within the team was to coordinate training for detention centers across the state of Michigan. I spent 13 years in juvenile detention observing the court system, learning how to work with delinquent youth, and experiencing licensing expectations of Child Caring Institutions. In 2016, I made the shift to Holy Cross Services as a Foster Care Worker. After a year of working for Holy Cross Services, I was promoted to Foster Care Supervisor and oversaw the Traverse City office.

In 2022, I was promoted to Divisional Director of Permanancy and Family Care in an interim capacity.\n\nJoy at Home:\n\nJoy is what happens when we allow ourselves to acknowledge the good things around us. It is choosing to be happy and content in your surroundings. For me it is the simple quiet cup of coffee in the morning, the newly planted flowers growing, or the laughter in the kitchen when cooking a meal. Home is my happy place where I spent time with my children and family making memories.\n\nJoy at Work:\n\nMy motivation comes from the ideas from working with families and my amazing co-workers. It is the dedication and hard work put into a concept to make it a reality to help support families to eliminate barriers and empower them to meet goals. It is a joyful feeling when you have helped create something that may make life even a little bit better for someone else. Programming and structure are built with the intent to strengthen and build a team for clients, to help them find the joy.\n\nContact: aharding@hccsnet.org\n\nAndrea Hagen\n\nDeputy Director of Foster Care\n\nAndrea was born and raised in West Michigan.

Graduating with her Master of Social Work degree in 2008, Andrea accepted her first job out of school with Holy Cross Services as a foster care worker. Since then, she has worked as a Foster Care Worker, Foster Care Supervisor, Program Manager, and now Deputy Director.

At home I find joy in spending time with family and friends, laughing about old memories and making new ones. Long days at the shores of Lake Michigan with a good book and the sounds of the waves bring me joy. We often think that joy comes from the big things in life, but if we are intentional in being present in the moment, we can find just as much joy in the small things.\n\nJoy at work: I find joy and laughter with my coworkers. Having strong relationships with your coworkers helps with the daily stressors of child welfare. I find joy in working with children and families. Seeing families heal and be reunited brings me joy, just as much as watching an adoption be finalized, bringing permanency to children, brings me joy. I feel privileged to work in a field that can find joy in the midst of hardship.\n\nContact: ahagen@hccsnet.org\n\nWilliam “Bill” Weston\n\nDIVISION DIRECTOR OF RESIDENTIAL & FAMILY HEALING\n\nMr. Weston was born and raised in Saginaw County, Mi. where he currently resides with his family.

I also enjoy attending various concerts with my family and friends.\n\nRyan Kunzelman\n\nCEO / President\n\nRyan, a native of Monroe, Michigan, currently serves as the President/CEO of Holy Cross Services, embodying a deep commitment to the organization’s mission.
