The facility is easy to get to from the highway. There was lots of parking near the location. The facility itself...\n\nAdelia V | April 2024\n\nGREAT PLACE BUT NO CAB SERVICE\n\nGreat place. NO CAB SERVICE. Also, the American fans, could be a bit more appreciative of the Canadian fans that travel for the OHL. We stayed at the Hampton Inn Hotel in Saginaw, MI - Hilton...\n\nPatSSN | April 2023\n\n80 degrees outside and freezing on the ice floor\n\nOur friends went to the Jim Gaffigan comedy show recently. Here is the good and the bad Good Parking is easy to get in and outside of the venue. Bad 1. Food choices in the center has no healthy...\n\nbrowncondo2102 | January 2023\n\nFans are still crazy here\n\nWent to watch the Spirit play. Fans are still rabid here. Lots of noise and cheering. Since we were opposing fans, a number of Spirit fans were interested in talking to us and made us feel welcome.\n\nKaty B | September 2022\n\nGreat Venue\n\nI really enjoyed this venue when I attended a recent concert. Large, modern and the seats were bigger than expected.\n\nTripAdvisor Traveller Rating\n\nBased on 15 TripAdvisor Reviews\n\nRead all TripAdvisor Reviews\n\nMap\n\nAmenities\n\nAmenities Features\n\nOpen Year-round\n\nSeason(s) of Operation\n\nSpring\n\nSummer\n\nFall\n\nWinter\n\nAccessible Travel\n\nWhat's Nearby\n\nRestaurants\n\nBringer Inn\n\nMore Info\n\nMuseums\n\nCastle Museum of Saginaw County History\n\nMore Info\n\nFarmers Markets\n\nDowntown Saginaw Farmer's Market\n\nMore Info\n\nHistoric Sites\n\nLibraries\n\nHoyt Public Library\n\nMore Info\n\nMuseums\n\nKid's Attractions\n\nMid-Michigan Children's Museum\n\nMore Info\n\nPerforming Arts/Theaters\n\nSaginaw Bay Symphony Orchestra\n\nMore Info\n\nChambers of Commerce\n\nSaginaw County Chamber of Commerce\n\nMore Info\n\nBuses\n\nSaginaw Greyhound Station\n\nMore Info\n\nPerforming Arts/Theaters\n\nTemple Theatre\n\nMore Info\n\nPerforming Arts/Theaters\n\nThe Dow Event Center\n\nMore Info"
