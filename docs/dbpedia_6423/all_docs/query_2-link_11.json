        "text": "SAGINAW, MI — About 150 years ago, an audience gathered in the basement of a church still standing today on Saginaw’s East Side to hear Sojourner Truth speak.\n\nLess than a decade after the adoption and ratification of the 13th Amendment, they gathered to see the famed abolitionist and women’s rights activist, who was born into slavery, eventually escaped to freedom and later met President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe crowd would have likely included reformers, “people interested in bettering society, who attempted to do so through a host of different causes,” including abolition, suffrage and temperance, according to one area historian.\n\n“Since Sojourner had been a vocal abolitionist during slavery and, by the 1870s, was an advocate of African American and women’s rights, I think those with a reform mindset would have been drawn to her talks,” said Amy French, associate professor of history at Delta College, who has a doctorate in history. “More generally, though, anyone looking to hear an inspirational, motivational story of perseverance might have wanted to attend so the audience could have been quite broad.”\n\nAccording to the historic Hoyt Library’s newspaper archives, Truth spoke in June 1871 and again in October 1877 at M.E. Church in Saginaw. Admission to the latter event was 15 cents. Truth often traveled and gave talks about her religion and politics, an uncommon and potentially dangerous thing for a Black woman to do at the time, French said. She sold photographs of herself to finance her journeys.\n\n“I think it’s definitely brave. I think there’s always an element of danger, especially when you’re looking at a time in American history where we literally will divide our country in half,” she said. “For a Black woman to be traveling about in this atmosphere is very dangerous.”\n\nA newspaper article published on June 14, 1871, details Truth’s speech the night before in a full lecture room at East Saginaw’s M.E. (Methodist Episcopal) Church, which, according to historic city directories was located on the east side of Jefferson Avenue between Hayden and Williams streets. Williams Street later became Janes Street and, today, the church located there is Kingdom Life Ministries International, said Sandy Schwan, chief curator with the Historical Society of Saginaw County.\n\nThe Rev. Alvernis Johnson has been pastor at Kingdom Life Ministries International for more than 20 years. The church bought the historic building on Jefferson in 2009. Alvernis said to worship in that building, erected in 1867, gives his church “pride and joy.”\n\n“It was an incredible honor because, of course, we are freedom fighters ourselves, in a sense,” Johnson said. “Anybody who makes that kind of history and difference in our world, to be connected to that, to own such a precious piece of Saginaw history, it’s a great feeling.”\n\nIt was there in that building that Truth spoke about the brutality she endured as an enslaved person and her Christian faith.\n\n“I was sold from my parents when I was 9 years old, as was my brothers and sisters. We lived in Ulster Co, New York. My mother sat out of doors and cried and told me I was to be sold, and when I was bad treated by my master I was to look up to God and trust in him,” she reportedly told the crowd. “I had a severe master, and I used to ask God to help me. I was whipped sometimes ‘til the blood ran on the floor.”\n\nTruth was born in 1797 in Hurley, New York. She was given the name Isabella Baumfree at birth, and Dutch was her first language, according to the Library of Congress. She was enslaved for nearly three decades until she escaped to freedom.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Truth visited Saginaw, it was common for notable figures of the day to travel from town to town to speak and provide entertainment, educational enrichment or spiritual enrichment, French said.\n\n“That is very much a calling of Sojourner Truth. She was affected very much by something called the Great Awakening,” she said. “It’s this movement that is sweeping across the nation in the early 19th century, the early 1800s, and it’s this idea of spiritual awakening and this embracing of Christianity.”\n\nWomen did not typically have a place in the structural hierarchy of churches, but they had a place in that movement, French said.\n\n“And this is decades later, this is the 1870s, and these ripple effects are still there of spirituality, and it’s indicative of the time,” she said.\n\nTruth also spoke about politics and social issues.\n\n“Before the Civil War, she would go around speaking about abolition and the need to free slaves. After the Civil War, she goes around speaking about the need to end segregation,” French said. “She is very much part of the women’s rights movement and the need for women to have the vote and the suffrage movement.”\n\nFrench said the fact that Truth traveled to Saginaw on those two occasions in the 1870s speaks to the city’s relevance at the time.\n\n“The fact that she’s coming here speaks to Saginaw as a culturally rich city. It’s a place that is important...a place that she feels that she wants to deliver her message to,” she said. “The fact that she comes to Saginaw not once, but twice, says something about Saginaw.”\n\nSpeaking on what this piece of history means to Johnson and his church, he said, “In a day where we’ve experienced such racial tension in our nation, it’s important, and especially for women, Black women’s history, it’s important to understand the contributions that were made for not just one people but for all people. Our heart is for unity and diversity so that we can move together because I really believe the only way forward is together.”\n\nRead more on MLive:\n\nRead and discuss Octavia Butler’s ‘Kindred’ in Saginaw Public Libraries and Justice Library event\n\nSaginaw libraries no longer charge overdue fines\n\nTake a virtual tour of Saginaw’s Japanese Cultural Center\n\nCongregation of St. John Lutheran, one of Saginaw’s oldest, disbands after 168 years\n\nVoters in Saginaw County overwhelmingly approve Castle Museum millage renewal\n\nWomen’s organization has served the Great Lakes Bay Region for almost a century"
