        "text": "Delta's doors will open at 7:30am.\n\nStudent Technical Solution Competitions (STS 2024) are scheduled to begin at 8:30am. Pick up a STS 2024 program at the check-in the M Wing hallway. The program will provide schedule details and competition room locations.\n\nJudging immediately follows the competition action. Awards will be presented following the judging period. Check the program for award presentation details.\n\nThe number of participants allowed to compete in each competition area must be predetermined due to the limits of our facilities. If fewer than three different sponsors have entered an individual or team in a particular category by the deadline of day of the event, that category may be deleted and the sponsoring schools notified.\n\nIn case of an emergency, substitutions for contestants may be made by phone or at Delta on the day of the competition.\n\nProblem topics\n\nIdentical problems will be given to all contestants in each competition category.\n\nAward decisions\n\nJudges decisions will be final.\n\nSafety equipment\n\nStudents must provide their own safety equipment, etc., as requested in\n\nCompetition rooms\n\nOnly student contestants, judges, and directors will be allowed in the competition area (room) during the actual competition.\n\nEligibility\n\nAny student in the Delta College Area of influence, in grades 9-12, enrolled in courses in a Michigan public, private, or parochial school is eligible if they have not reached their 21st birthday at the time of submitting their registration.\n\nEach student must presently be enrolled in a course in which the subject matter and level match that of the category in which they wish to compete.\n\nFor further requirements, see “Specific Rules and Information” for each subject area and category in which your students will participate.\n\nSponsor definition and eligibility\n\nA school is eligible to be a \"sponsor\" if the course(s) is taught at that school.\n\nFor example: If \"Beginning Drafting\" is taught at the student's home school, the home school may be a \"sponsor,\" and the instructor is responsible for registrations. If, however, home schools A, B, and C send their students to a center, e.g., a career center or to a school where facilities are available to teach a course such as \"Welding\", then that center/school is the \"sponsor,\" and the instructor at that center/school is responsible for filling out the registration forms.\n\nA sponsoring school may have one or more individuals or teams represented in each competition category, subject to the competition space limits.\n\nAutoCAD\n\nParametric Solid Modeling\n\nAutoCAD\n\nThe AutoCAD competition will be very similar to a simplified version of the AutoCAD Certified User (ACU) exam.\n\nhttps://certiport.filecamp.com/s/A0q4kMKyt0M75DXG/fi\n\nStudents will be tested on basic use of AutoCAD as well as basic drafting and design techniques. Students should be able to report properties of entities such as length of lines and arcs, distance between two points, area of hatches, perimeter of polylines, etc...\n\nThere will be a tie breaker where students will dimension a supplied orthographic drawing according to best practices.\n\nSolid Modeling\n\nSoftware Programs include SolidWorks, Inventor, and OnShape. Students can bring their own laptops to use other CAD software such as Fusion 360.\n\nStudents will be given a series of physical blocks that will be reverse engineered and modeled. Students will apply a custom material when supplied with a density. They will then report the weight of the part. Students will need to supply their own calipers.\n\nCapacity Limit\n\nWe have a max capacity of 40 students for Parametric Modeling and AutoCAD combind, so limits per school depend on how many schools attend.\n\nQuestions?\n\nIf you would like more information on the these competitions contact:\n\nSteve Gormley\n\nAutoCAD, Parametric Solid Modeling\n\nstevengormley@delta.edu\n\n989-686-9044\n\nArc Welding I\n\nThe Beginning Welding competition is for full-time high school students who are in their first year of welding instruction. Students will demonstrate their skill at making two fillet welds in the 2-F position: one with 3/32 inch E7018 electrodes and the other with 1/8 inch E6010 electrodes. Both welds will be on 1/4-inch thick hot rolled, low carbon steel plate.\n\nArc Welding II\n\nThe Advanced Welding competition is for full-time high school students who have completed one or more years of welding instruction and are currently enrolled in a high school welding class. Students will demonstrate their skill at making one butt weld in the 3G position using 3/32 inch E7018 electrodes on 3/8 inch hot rolled low carbon steel.Plate will be prepared for 45° included angle grooved but joint with a 1/4-inch root opening and a backing bar.\n\nJudging criteria\n\nWeld quality will be ranked by visual examination.\n\nEquipment\n\nElectrodes, weld coupon metal, and welding machines will be assigned to each participant. Other welding gear is to be furnished by the participants. For example, students are to provide their own hood, gloves, apron, sleeves, spats, etc. Students WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to weld with low shoes, rubber or plastic shoes, trousers with cuffs, or other personal gear which is UNSAFE.\n\nGeneral information\n\nThe welding competition will be held on Delta’s campus. Sponsoring school teachers, counselors, and/or others who attend with their students are welcome to visit the Delta Welding Center during the competition but will be restricted from entering the welding booth area during the testing period.\n\nQuestions?\n\nIf you would like more information on the Welding competitions contact:\n\nJim Proctor\n\njamesproctor@delta.edu\n\n989-686-9599\n\nWelding Technology - Inspection\n\nGeneral information\n\nIf you are familiar with how the AWS-CWI certification exam works, this is somewhat along those same guidelines. The test will be completed in a classroom. There is no hands-on work to be completed. This is a stand-alone category. Students cannot complete in ARC Welding I or ARC Welding II and this category. The student will have to choose one competition category to compete in.\n\nThe test will have 3 parts:\n\nPart A: Fundamental Knowledge 40 -50 multiple choice questions. These questions are comprehensive and can be on any of the major welding process, fabrication, electrical characteristics, welding inspection, welding positions, safety, etc.\n\nPart B: Blueprint 20-30 multiple choice questions. The student will be supplied a blueprint and asked corresponding questions about: dimensions, line types, welding symbols, title block, general/specific notes, views, etc.\n\nPart C: \"Practical\" 20-30 multiple choice questions. The student will answer questions on weld anatomy (eg. fillet weld throats, leg, toe, weld interface, fusion, bevel face, etc.), weld discontinuities, joint types, etc. This section will have the student answer questions regarding a picture or diagram.\n\nJudging Criteria\n\nIn the event of a tie, the student who completed the test in the least amount time will win. Welding faculty will administer the test and ensure fairness while scoring answers the day of the competition.\n\nQuestions?\n\nIf you would like more information on the Welding competitions please contact:\n\nKeith Proctor\n\nkeithproctor@delta.edu\n\n989-686-9065\n\nAgricultural Technology Quiz Bowl (Team)\n\nPURPOSE: To better acquaint high school agricultural education members with Michigan Ag Industry and assist them in learning key information about the industry.\n\nELIGIBILITY: 9th-12th grade high school students\n\nTEAMS ALLOWED: A minimum of three to a maximum of five students can make up a team in the Quiz Bowl Competition. (Maximum for of 3 teams per school with a maximum of 32 teams total for the category.)\n\nCONTEST RULES\n\n1.

This will be done by random draw prior to the context.\n\n3. if teams are not present in the holding room by 8:30a.m. on the day of the contest, they will be disqualified.\n\n4. NEW RULES FOR 2024\n\na. Number of questions asked during the Preliminary Rounds and Final Round\n\nb. Winners' Bracket and Loser's Bracket\n\ni. Overtime Competition\n\nCONTEST PROCEDURES\n\nThe rules for the contest will be split between the preliminary rounds and the final competition.\n\nPreliminary Rounds\n\nDuring this portion of the contest, the students are not allowed to confer with one another. Each student is asked questions in an alternating fashion. Each team will be asked ten (10) questions in total, regardless of the number of members on the team. Once the quesetion is flashed on the screen the member has twenty (20) seconds to answer. Questions are worth one point each. Stealing questions is not permitted.\n\nIn the event of a tie, a question will flash on the screen and each team has twenty (20) seconds to write the answer on a piece of paper. This will continue until only one team answers correctly. Teams may work together while breaking the tie.\n\nThe questions in this round will be multiple choice or true/false. Questions will be drawn randomly immediately before they are flashed on the screen. Due to the limited number of questions that are appropriate for high school students, it is possible that some questions are repeated. A question that is repeated will be treated no differently the second time it is read.\n\nThere will be two brackets, the Winner's bracket and the Loser's bracket. At the start of the quiz bowl, all teams start in the Winner's bracket. Any team that loses once wil be sent to the Loser's bracket. From there, every team who has lost one game will fight each other. If they lose one more time in the Loser's bracket, they're out for good. The winner of the Winner's bracket and the winner of the Loser's bracket will move on to the final round.\n\nFinal Competition\n\nDuring this portion of the contest, the students are allowed to confer with one another. Each team will be asked fifteen (15) questions. Once the question is flashed on the screen the team has thirty (30) seconds to confer and answer the question. These questions will be “fill in the blank” and will be randomly drawn immediately before they are asked. During this round stealing questions is permissible. If one team answers incorrectly, the other team may answer within thirty (30) seconds, starting when the moderator declares the first answer incorrect. Questions may not be stolen a second time. After the second team answers the question, they will be in line for the next question as if no stealing occurred.\n\nOvertime Competition\n\nIf the winner of the main bracket losed in the final round, we will have an overtime competition. During this portion of the contest the students are allowed to confer with one another. Each team will be asked five (5) questions. Once the question is flashed on the screen the team has fifteen (15) seconds to confer and answer the question. These questions will be \"fill in the blank\" and will be randomly drawn immediately before they are asked. During the round stealing questions is permissible. If one team answers incorrectly, the other team may answer with fifteen (15) seconds, starting when the moderator declares the first answer incorrect. Questions may not be stolen a second time. After the second team answers the question, they will be in line for the next question as if no stealing occured.\n\nContest Questions: Questions will cover the entire scope of the Michigan Ag Industry including history, dates, people, programs, activities, and current events of the industry.\n\nAg Industry questions come from the following sources:\n\nMichigan Agriculture Facts & Figures Book\n\nMichigan Farm Bureau -Facts & Figures\n\nMichigan Farm Bureau Website (Michigan Agriculture Facts)\n\nMichigan Farm Bureau - Michigan Agriculture Facts\n\nMichigan Farm Bureau Website (Farming Resources)\n\nMichigan Farm Bureau - Farming Resources\n\nMichigan Grown\n\nMichigan Grown\n\nMichigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development\n\nMI Dept.
