The building inspector issues building permits and inspects construction sites in accordance with the 2015 edition of the Michigan Building Code, the 2015 Michigan Residential Code, and oversees the electrical inspector and the plumbing and mechanical inspector.\n\nFor your convenience, you can search online for the Michigan Codes here: https://up.codes/codes/michigan\n\nThe building inspector must be prepared to issue “stop work” orders and seek circuit court injunctions to achieve compliance with the codes.\n\nFarm buildings for legitimate agricultural use are exempt from permitting and enforcement, but still must meet zoning setbacks. Contact the Zoning Administrator for more information."
