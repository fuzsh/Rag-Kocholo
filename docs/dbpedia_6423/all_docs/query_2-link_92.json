        "text": "Location / Name:\n\nLansing MI, Ingham County (mostly)\n\nWhat's Here:\n\nGrand Trunk Western depot\n\nMichigan Central depot\n\nAmtrak station\n\nDiamond (near the Amtrak station)\n\nSeveral yards\n\nthe R.E. Olds Transportation Museum\n\nData:\n\nGPS Coordinates: as needed\n\nPhone A/C: 517\n\nZIP: 48933 (at the Capitol Building)\n\nAccess by train/transit:\n\nAmtrak\n\nThe Scoop:\n\nLansing is a good railfanning town. It is kinda in the center of the state, and is the capitol of Michigan.\n\nAmong all of the things Lansing has to offer, it is lucky to have two noteworthy structures still standing: two really nice depots. A Grand Trunk Western depot on Washington Ave, and the Michigan Central depot on East Michigan Ave.\n\nIn addition, Lansing has an Amtrak station, a pretty active diamond, and plenty of yards to keep one busy for a full day of railfanning!\n\nI breezed thru Lansing in 2011, I was given a bang-up tour of the sites Lansing has to offer by two local railfans, but I can't locate my notes or the names of the guys from that tour, but I thank them immensely.\n\nThe CN and CSX yards are the busiest, and from looking at the birds eye view on Bing maps, it doesn't appear that NS uses the yard on the southside of town for much of anything - a couple of tracks have had their south leads taken out.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nDenver Todd\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nBing Maps\n\nOpen Railway and Open Street Maps\n\nWikipedia\n\nWebsites and other additional information sources of interest for the area:\n\nNone for now.....\n\nGetting Here\n\nLansing is at the crossroads of interstates I-96 and I-69.\n\nI-69 runs heads SW out of Flint, and then kinda south once passing thru Lansing heading to Fort Wayne IN.\n\nI-96 runs east and west from Detroit to Grand Rapids and the west coast of Michigan: Muskegon and Grand Haven.\n\nYou also have US127 which north-south, splitting off from I-75 just south of Grayling (where you would head west to go to Traverse City) in upper Michigan (not the U.P.), Hits I-94 at Jackson MI, and continues on south as a real back road.\n\nIn looking at the above map, you will notice that there is a \"beltway\", or loop of sorts made up of the two interstates and US127. Getting around to the various places and sights in Lansing is an easy task, with nothing really too far away from anything else.\n\nYou also have I-496 which cuts through the center of town going east-west, and provides quick access to most of the downtown sights to check out other than the yards.\n\nFrom downtown Lansing, Grand Rapids is approximately 70 miles away, Durand is about 35 miles, and Detroit is about 90 miles.\n\nMap\n\nPDF version\n\nNote: I took the easy way out on my map and used \"4t\" to denote the number of tracks instead of showing them separately.... :-)\n\nSights\n\nthe Amtrak Station\n\nAmtrak's station for the area is in East Lansing.\n\nThe station sign, and a billboard with an ad for the Blue Water train.\n\nWe missed the Amtrak train by 10 minutes, so this is the only thing we caught while at the station.\n\nThe CN-CSX Trowbridge Diamond\n\nThe diamond is just west of the Amtrak station.\n\nA couple of shots looking across the diamond from the Amtrak station. The one on the right is \"all the way\" on the camera at x80. This is a good study in the signaling here, as it looks like they replaced the most used signals, leaving the signals for the reverse traffic to do at a later time. I guess they run left hand traffic like the CNW and the RF&P. The left photo gives you a good view of the four GTW/CN signals, and in the photo on the right, you can make out a signal on the far side of the elevator.\n\n(L) Looking west on the Grand Trunk, (R) Close-up of the color light signal.\n\n(L) The \"tri-light\" protecting the GT WB reverse traffic track, (R) 3 color color light dwarf on the SB CSX track - notice the green (or lunar) is in the middle...\n\n(L) A 2 head GRS searchlight signal on the SB CSX track, (R) a close-up of one of the tri-light heads.\n\nThe CN-NS diamond. The track bearing off to the left does not interchange with the CN, instead, it curves back around as shown on the map to serve local business'..... Maybe at one time there was an interchange?\n\nthe Grand Trunk depot\n\nThe Grand Trunk depot, and a nearby girder bridge.\n\nThe other side of the GT depot, showing a caboose on the lot. The last time I was here, someone was going to turn it into a restaurant. They should look to the success of the restaurants in Northumberland PA, Berea OH, Oakland NY, Sykesville MD for examples on how to do it right! Well, I guess I have to take the Berea depot out of the mix, as they apparently closed up in 2009... darn...\n\nThe signals are looking east from the depot.\n\nthe Michigan Central depot\n\nAbove is an aerial view of the depot ex Michigan Central depot on Michigan Ave. This one houses Clara's restaurant. Plan your visit so you can have lunch or dinner here, the food is great, and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nI've now had dinner here three times, and every time I have been more than happy with the food and service. On my most recent visit in 2011, I had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Cindy. She and her brother now own the restaurant, having taken over it's operation when their father passed on in 2005. She is a most wonderful host, so if you get a chance, please tell her how much you enjoyed the experience.\n\nThey also have another restaurant in Battle Creek... for more info: http://www.claras.com/index_html.html\n\nThe set of pictures above is from JUL2009, and below, from OCT2011. Thanks to Cindy for taking my pix.\n\nThe picture next to the last on the right (bottom) is an interior shot of the diner car... very cool!\n\nCN's Lansing Yard"
