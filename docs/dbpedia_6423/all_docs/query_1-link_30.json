The name of Shiawassee is derived from Indian lore, meaning “Rolling” or “Sparkling Waters.”\n\nShiawassee County represents approximately 67,877 residents in its 2 charter townships and 14 civil townships. The majority of residents reside inside 6 cities, 6 villages, and 21 unincorporated communities.\n\nOwosso, the largest city in the county, was the birthplace of several famous people, among them being former Governor Thomas E.
