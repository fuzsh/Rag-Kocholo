        "text": "Hammer Restoration – Celebrating 50 Years!\n\nHammer Restoration, Inc., a family owned and operated business based in Saginaw Township, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014.\n\nHammer Restoration, Inc. is a 24-hour emergency restoration service company that offers a full range of restoration services throughout mid-Michigan. The company employs a fully trained staff that specializes in flood, water, fire and storm damage to homes and offices.\n\nWhile currently serving Michigan from our Mt. Pleasant & Saginaw locations, the company wasn’t always so big.\n\nIt was founded in 1964 by Larry Gohm, a fourth-generation builder, who started the business as a building operation, running the small enterprise from his home and using mainly sub-contractors.\n\nWhen the company outgrew the home office, he converted a small house on Gratiot Road into an office and continued operating from there, under the name Hammer Home Improvement. After a while, Larry’s children, Steve Gohm and Amy Wolcott, joined the family business as it started specializing in rebuilding and repairing homes and offices.\n\nUpon earning his Bachelor of Science Degree from Michigan State University in Building Construction Management, Steve became Larry’s partner and the name became Hammer Building & Restoration, Inc. They then moved to the present Saginaw Township location on Fashion Square Boulevard.\n\nIn 2000, Larry retired, passing the presidential torch to Steve. Over the next few years Hammer expanded its capabilities by adding a new warehouse and investing in a large inventory of additional equipment and vehicles. In 2008, when many businesses were failing, Hammer opened a second office in Mt. Pleasant.\n\nNow, when fire, flood or other disasters strike, Hammer Restoration is ready to respond 24-hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nHammer Restoration has become the Emergency Response Leader in mid and central Michigan. We help businesses, medical facilities, apartments, hotels, schools, senior living complexes as well as hundreds of home owners after water and flood damage devastates their world. Our teams clean up after fire/smoke damage, vandalism, mold, vehicle impact into structures, infection control, crime/trauma scene clean up and so much more. Hammer has a team of highly skilled carpenters that can rebuild and repair any building or home after any type of damage. Hammer also bids and builds new home construction.\n\nFull-service restoration means Hammer can take care of the damage to the structure itself as well as all of your possessions/contents. Our teams are highly trained in specialty cleaning, including electronics, documents, photos, collectibles, clothing and all the items in your office or home.\n\nHammer staff will take care of everything within the structure – be it a home or business – by removing contents to their warehouses for cleaning and secure storage while the structure is being repaired.\n\nThe Hammer staff can handle large loss projects because of the expertise of the award-winning staff, which have all been highly educated in the field of restoration and repair.\n\nOne of the most critical services we provide is the emergency services needed immediately after a disaster is discovered or a fire is put out. Our on call teams are like the cavalry showing up at the darkest hour. At that point, our mission is to stop the damage in its tracks and protect the property, both structural and contents, until the restoration work can begin.\n\nWhile celebrating over 50 years of success here in Michigan, Hammer Restoration, Inc. is also looking towards the future. We constantly keep up on the latest industry trends, new technology and developments.\n\nSo what does the future hold? We will continue to invest in training our staff to be the best specialists we can be. We will continue to build strong relationship with other industry leaders in and around Michigan. We will continue to expand our commercial restoration services by expanding our team specializing in commercial losses."
