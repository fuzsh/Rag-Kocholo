        "text": "THINKING ABOUT BUILDING A NEW COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL BUILDING IN DELTA TOWNSHIP?\n\nIf you are Building a new Commercial or Industrial Building there are several permits that need to be obtained.\n\nDepending on the Project scale, there are several steps in the process. This is a guideline to help you navigate through the system and help answer your questions.\n\nIf you have additional questions, please call the Economic Development Director, or the Building Department for assistance.\n\nWhat Permits do I need for Building a New Commercial or Industrial Building?\n\nPlans and other construction documents for building projects are required by the State of Michigan to be sealed by an architect or engineer licensed to practice in the State of Michigan.\n\nPlanning and Zoning:\n\nOne of the first steps in the process is to contact the Planning and Zoning Department [517-323-8560] to discuss your project. Several considerations should be discussed early on in the process to alleviate potential future problems. Site plans should be submitted so the Department can evaluate the over-all project and begin to verify requirements, such as zoning, parking requirements, access roads, fire lanes, property line setbacks, easements, and several other items.\n\nSewer and Water Capital Charges:\n\nWhen a new building is constructed and hooked up to the Public Water and Sewer System a “Capital Charge” must be charged. The fee is based on the use of the property. Please call the Building Division at 517-323-8530 to obtain the estimated fee.\n\nPlan Submission:\n\nPlans and other construction documents for Commercial or Industrial Projects should be submitted – 1 hard copy and 1 electronic copy.\n\nBuilding Permits – Commercial Projects\n\nGetting Started\n\nFor Commercial and Industrial Projects, a separate permit is needed for all Building projects.\n\nDepending on the scope of work, your project will likely require separate Plumbing, Electrical, and Mechanical permits. These permits must be secured by the sub-contractors prior to performing any work on the site.\n\nIf you are operating your business in a Commercial or Industrial structure, only a licensed contractor may secure permits and perform the Building related work – even for small projects.\n\nProject/Permitting Flow Chart:\n\nHiring a contractor?\n\nAll contractors working within the State of Michigan must be licensed by the State of Michigan, Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA). Only Contractors with current licenses, in good standing, are allowed to work in Delta Township.\n\nProject and Fees:\n\nYou will be asked to describe the scope of work proposed and to provide a detailed list of all work you will be performing. If you have questions, please call the Building Department at 517-323-8530.\n\nThe Building Permit fees are based on the scope of work of your Project. The fee is based on the actual value of the construction. The fees are automatically calculated on the application [fillable form] as you fill it out.\n\nApplying For My Building Permit:\n\nApplications can be filed using our automated online permitting system, or using a paper form available online. All Building Permits require a Plan Review process. Once approved, the issued permit will be emailed/mailed to you.\n\nPlan Review Process:\n\nCommercial/industrial building permits require a plan review. Plan review typically takes 4 weeks, however, this varies depending on the project scope. To assure the Project goes as smooth as possible, we require the following information:\n\nComplete Building Plans, drawn to scale\n\nContain definitions if legends are used\n\nNature, and extent, of the work proposed\n\nThe plans shall show, in detail that they will conform to the applicable Code rules, requirements, ordinances, and regulations.\n\nIf you are unsure whether your project requires “plan review,” please call the office for clarification.\n\nBuilding Plan Submission:\n\nThese Plans need to be specific and include all details necessary to determine building materials, specifications, and sizes. The plans should be emailed to the Building Official at mleach@deltami.gov\n\nTypical plans include:\n\nSite plan\n\nFloor plans\n\nElevation views\n\nCross-section and detailed drawings\n\nYour plans must clearly show all the work you intend to do on the building as well as the existing conditions. Existing conditions and new construction must be clearly delineated. Plans must also show where the building sits on your property in relation to property lines and other buildings on the site.\n\nInspections:\n\nInspections can be scheduled either online, or by calling the Building Division Office.
