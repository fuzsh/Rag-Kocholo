        "text": "Category Archives: Urban “renewal”\n\n“Jenks Protests Street [name] Changes”\n\nAfter running across and reading the following article in The Port Huron Times Herald (October 9th, 1923, page 1), I couldn’t help but say “I love Jenks.” This is William Jenks, of course, the author of the 1912 St. Clair County history book, important Michigan map collector, and a primary mover in the building of the Carnegie Library (now museum) here. My sentiments on the subject are expressed by Jenks wonderfully; some brief explanatory notes and a historic map follow. Enjoy!\n\n_______________________\n\n“Preserve Historical Names, Attorney’s Plea”\n\n“Protest against the changing of the name of Gillett street to Hammond street, which was recently asked by the residents of the street in a petition to the city commission, is voiced in a letter sent the commission by W. L. Jenks, prominent attorney of Port Huron and member of the state Historical society.”\n\n“In his letter Mr. Jenks comments on the tendency resent in cities today to give streets high-sounding and meaningless titles, and deplores inappropriate and thoughtless changes. he points out two blunders in changing street names made recently by the commission.”\n\n“The letter follows:”\n\nI noticed recently that a petition had been filed with you to change the name of Gillett street to Hammond street in honor of the late Lieut. Hammond.\n\nI sincerely hope that the name will not be changed. Gillett street commemorates the name of one of the early prominent citizens of Port Huron[,] a man of the highest character, one of the leading business men and a man who was very generous and public-spirited, and his name ought not to be forgotten in this city.\n\nI do not wish to belittle in any manner the propriety of naming a street in honor of Lieutenant Hammond, but there are several streets in the city which have names that do not contain any significance and the changing of a name of that kind to commemorate the name of Lieut. Hammond would be appropriate in every way.\n\nThe city has already made two serious blunders in the changing of names of streets–when it changed Butler street commemorating the name of an honored man of national reputation, and a prominent philanthropist, to Grand River avenue[,] a name which has absolutely no significance here. The name apparently was copied from Detroit where Grand River avenue has a meaning, it being the direct route from Detroit to the Grand River country, including the cities of Lansing, Grand Rapids and Grand Haven.\n\nThe name of Suffern street which bore the name of prominent merchant of New York City who was largely interested in Port Huron property for several years was changed to Glenwood avenue, a high sounding name which has no appropriateness as there is neither a glen nor any wood in or near the street.\n\nSuch changes are to be deplored and not to be encouraged by good citizens.\n\nThe city did not change Gillett to Hammond, as there is no Hammond Street in Port Huron and Gillett is still there. Lieut. Hammond is remembered here though, as the American Legion post is named after him. On Gillett/Gillette and Jenks streets, a 1925 article states: “Gillette street is named after Martin S. Gillette, lumberman and president of the village board in 1850. Jenks street is named after W. L. Jenks, pioneer and historian of the county” (there were other prominent Jenks in Port Huron, too; “Street Names Tell the History of City,” The Port Huron Times-Herald, February 13, 1925, page 11).\n\nWhy the Style of Your Home is Not “Victorian,” and Why it Matters\n\nby Vicki Priest (c) 2018\n\nYou may have clicked on this article thinking, “why does this matter?” or perhaps out of annoyance, but how people perceive the dwellings in their community can have some real and possibly unpleasant consequences. What do I mean by that? Well, Victorian is a period in history and not a single architectural style. The many styles from that period in the U.S. are mostly from after the Civil War to about 1910. But if to your knowledge all homes built during that time are “Victorian style,” then it may seem reasonable to not get too upset over a few more losses—since there seem to be so many of them.\n\nHowever, not only are there many styles within the Victorian period, there are styles from other periods that overlap with the Victorian. So, while there are, say, many vernacular homes that had, or may still have, “Queen Anne” ornament (the style people often associate with Victorian), there aren’t so many Second Empire buildings left here. If all the Second Empire homes remaining in Port Huron were razed, it would equal only a small percent of all those remaining from the 2nd half of the 19th century. Knowing this, once a building is identified as a rarer type and not just another “Victorian,” then it is hoped that it will be favored with benevolence in its future. And Second Empire style is rarer; the style is the oldest of the Victorian Period and Port Huron has already lost much of its significant and beautiful stock (see Image 1 and its caption). A great many Italiantes, an earlier period style that overlaps with Victorian, have also been lost due to fires and demolitions.

While Port Huron has lost many buildings to fires, it has lost a great many to redevelopment and blight removal. This 54-year-old report shows the attitude of the times, that the sturdy and artful buildings of downtown were “antiquated” and therefore ready for demolition. It is proud of the demolitions and of the building owners who otherwise covered up their old buildings’ “rustic” facades. When do you see buildings like that being made today, with actual brick, hardwoods, marble, etc.? Continue reading →\n\nThe Gutting of Gratiot Avenue at the Blue Water Bridge\n\nOne day I came across a photo from 1893 showing a group of retail/office buildings on Gratiot Avenue (north Port Huron), which was still dirt. I was very curious about where exactly this block used to be. Looking at early directories wasn’t very helpful at first, but thankfully, Pauli’s 1894 bird’s eye view map gave a clue.\n\nThe group of buildings on a portion of Gratiot Avenue on this map fairly matched the proportions of those shown in the photo. And then after betting that the photo matched the map in that area, a light switched on in my head. One of those buildings is still standing today, and it was posted at this site previously. Why only the one building was saved when all the buildings around (including to the east and west) were razed, is something I’d love to find out. Some day. One thing is all too clear, though; much of this area of Port Huron seems to have been demolished for nothing.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPreservation Laws: How is Michigan doing? Part 1\n\nWhen reviewing the historic resources in Port Huron that still stand, and those that don’t (along with the how, when, and why of their demise), a person can easily assume that no historic preservation laws actually exist in Michigan. The non-federally owned properties that are protected to a certain extent here are those that people have simply wished to be protected, and, those persons had some ability to get that protection in place. What about all the other properties that are worthy of protection, but aren’t? What about all those that were worthy of protection in the past, but are now gone? If protection laws exist, why have they been implemented so capriciously or subjectively, at least in the Port Huron area?\n\nPreservation laws and ordinances are based on lots of things, like federal law and enabling laws passed by the states. A good way to learn about them is to start at the “top” and work “down.” Often, federal laws begat state Laws, and enabling laws stem from those (enabling laws are those that allow the legal passage of local, instead of statewide, protective ordinances).\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSad Note, Happy Note\n\nThe Sad\n\nBelow is a google image of some small brick office buildings that were just torn down in Port Huron (1900 block Pine Grove Avenue, east side). This image does not do the buildings and property justice, but I did not get photos of my own before the razing. In person, they (and the property generally) looked much better. While they weren’t terribly old, they were quaint, brick, human-sized buildings that you just don’t see that often anymore. By their presence they acknowledged small business, and they could’ve been even more inviting if the parking lot had been improved with some landscaping. While new “strip malls” and single-building enterprises are popping up in Port Huron, they don’t have the human-environmental quality that this group of small office buildings had. There are plenty of ugly retail buildings in Port Huron, and the fresh strip malls could very well be the eyesores of tomorrow.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPractical Reasons to Save Old Buildings: Thank You, National Trust\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation is simply a great organization with all kinds of useful information for planners, preservationists, history buffs . . . Last fall they posted a “Six Practical Reasons to Save Old Buildings” at their site, but I only saw it recently. It would seem like a place like Port Huron would have learned something by now about the loss of so many of its historic buildings, the built enviornment that made Port Huron what it is–well, what it was. Most of the buildings lost (including whole blocks of historic commercial structures) have not been replaced by anything better, or even equivalent, in monetary or aesthetic value. (Historically speaking, I remain surprised every time I come across a building that had been moved because someone valued it–the thing had value; buildings used to be moved a lot more than people today realize, I’d wager.)\n\nIf a city can be likened to a person, it’s as if Port Huron is an aged lady who hated her own old body, so cut parts of it off, thinking her appearance would then look more appealing (she sought to hide her age, too, by not posting about her past on her website). But she didn’t add anything to her appearance by slicing away at herself; she was only left with the reality that there was now less of her, and, she didn’t look any better. There are those who appreciate the weathered, older, and wiser folk, and seek them out. And despite so many people telling her just this thing, she still can’t seem to like her old self. She had glory days for sure, and people feel a little bit like they are a part of that, still, when walking through the remnants of those days. They connect with those who came before, somehow, instead of just blandly passing through a plastic and drywall matrix of cookie-cutter walls.\n\nI want to imagine what it was like when William Jenks walked down the same street that I’m now walking on, and think about what it was like in a restaurant where he and his buddies talked about the growing city, the ship they were building, how the ball was in so-in-so’s house on the third floor the night before, etc. Unfortunately, I don’t know if there are any buildings left that held a restaurant or lounge that William Jenks might have socialized in, and I don’t know yet if any of the remaining large homes still have their third floor ballrooms. But, I hope you get the picture. Perhaps you have different thoughts of the past in Port Huron, like imagining a 1920s scene of beach revelers.\n\nSo, what are the practical reasons for saving old buildings? I’ll provide you a shortened list of what the National Trust provided.\n\n“Old buildings have intrinsic value.” I’m going to be a bit jaded here and say that a lot of folks wouldn’t know what “intrinsic value” means. But here the author talks about the value of the materials and craftsmanship used in older, pre-WWII buildings. You just can’t get many of these materials any more, and you often can’t reproduce the quality or craftsmanship. Example: old building in Tennessee was saved from the wrecking ball after realizing that it’s thick brick walls (five layers!) could withstand the most powerful tornadoes.\n\n“When you tear down an old building, you never know what’s being destroyed.” Another example from Tennessee (the Daylight Building, built 1927). A building became an eyesore, as so many altered and then uncared for buildings do. Someone finally wanted to renovate it instead of demolish it, and it turned out to have qualities that no one knew about: “drop-ceilings made with heart-pine wood, a large clerestory, a front awning adorned with unusual tinted ‘opalescent’ glass, and a facade lined with bright copper.”\n\n“New businesses prefer old buildings.” Older buildings are perfect for smaller businesses and start-ups. Businesses with new and therefore possibly risky, ideas, need the economy of existing infrastructure.\n\n“Old buildings attract people.” I would say the reasons for this attraction include the human scale and the attention to, and value of, detail. Those who came before us stopped and looked at the roses, and smelled the roses, and said that the roses were very good. Today, builders don’t seem to even know roses exist, let alone have value. But the author had these ideas about it: “Is it the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or old brick―or the resonance of other people, other activities? Maybe older buildings are just more interesting. The different levels, the vestiges of other uses, the awkward corners, the mixtures of styles, they’re at least something to talk about. America’s downtown revivals suggest that people like old buildings. Whether the feeling is patriotic, homey, warm, or reassuring, older architecture tends to fit the bill. Regardless of how they actually spend their lives, Americans prefer to picture themselves living around old buildings.”\n\n“Old buildings are reminders of a city’s culture and complexity.” “Just as banks prefer to build stately, old-fashioned facades, even when located in commercial malls, a city needs old buildings to maintain a sense of permanency and heritage.”\n\n“Regret only goes one way.” Like anything else, once a historic structure is gone, it can’t be resurrected. We can’t tell the future, and the future might’ve been better with the use of that now-gone building.\n\nGetting the Word Out about PHAHPA\n\nI’ve been busy populating this site’s pages with useful information, researching and helping some folks with historical building questions, and trying to make more connections. So, I hadn’t been focusing on developing the organization as a nonprofit quite as much. But to make things clearer in everyone’s mind (including my own), I came up with a one page hand-out about the Port Huron Area History and Preservation Association. Eventually, when the organization has a new host, pdf’s of forms, informational sheets and brochures, articles, etc., will be made available.\n\nIn the meantime, feel free to comment on the contents of this hand-out. We would appreciate thoughtful feedback and any insights into the local situation that could prove helpful to furthering the preservation of our historic community. First is an image of the sheet which could be copied and printed out, if desired, followed by standard text.\n\nPort Huron Area History & Preservation Association\n\nCommunity. Uniqueness. Home.\n\nBringing the Port Huron area’s history to life.\n\nWe’re here to inform and inspire Port Huron area residents about the possibilities of preserving and rehabilitating their historic properties. We’re here to help those same residents investigate their properties for the purposes of recognition, preservation, and the application for any possible monetary benefit or assistance.\n\nWe will do this by developing and presenting (1) data related to regional history, architecture, and planning, (2) historical narratives and contexts, (3) “how-to” articles and ready-to-use forms; by providing (4) assistance with research, technical forms, and report writing, and by (5) recognizing historical resources at the organizations’ web page and via public avenues, and when funds allow, (6) provide permanent informational plaques (to be mounted on the historic building).\n\nWe are still in the development phase of establishing this organization for the greater Port Huron area, with the goal of incorporating and being awarded nonprofit (501[c]3) status. To find out more and to contribute in any way (including volunteering, or even being on the Board of Directors or an advisory committee), please visit PHAHPA.ORG and/or contact Vicki Priest at 949-449-4731 (or phahpa@zoho.com). Thank you!\n\nYes, Virginia, Historic Preservation for the Masses Exists\n\nAgainst the will of a huge amount of people and their community representatives, monied interests in Michigan are trying their darnedest to–for all intents and purposes–eliminate historic districts (Ellison 2016; Finegood 2016 (1); Finegood 2016 (2)). So with this dark cloud looming, Stephanie Meeks’ “President’s Note” in the Spring 2016 issue of Preservation (Fighting Displacement) seemed like a sudden burst of sunshine. To read the entire piece, click the previous link–it’s not a long read. But here, let me give you some highlights.\n\nFor many Americans in cities, the biggest crisis now and in the foreseeable future is a dearth of affordable housing . . . Simply put, the rent is just too high. . . . Fourteen cities around the country saw double-digit growth in rents last year.\n\nThere is sometimes a perception that preservation is driving excessive rents by making older neighborhoods more attractive to well-heeled outsiders, and by ostensibly limiting the housing supply. We have been heartened by recent research . . . that suggests instead that preservation supports existing residents across the economic spectrum . . .\n\nOne terrific example of this is in Macon, Georgia, where the Historic Macon Foundation has been renovating homes in the Beall’s Hill neighborhood. Historic Macon never displaces current landowners by acquiring occupied houses [displacement is happening in Michigan, where very nice old homes are being torn down to build “McMansions], and it counters displacement in other ways, such as building houses designed to be affordable for families and operating a robust historic tax credit consulting service. [emphasis mine – this is a terrific idea]\n\nRather than exacerbating the crisis, creative adaptive reuse projects all over the country are expanding housing options and helping cities become more affordable.\n\nI wonder what we can accomplish at the local level here in Port Huron, if we try? Please contact me if you’d like to discuss the possibilities! vicki@phahpa.org\n\nProblems with anti-historic district rhetoric\n\nBelow is a reprint of an article posted by Justin Davidson in the New York Magazine, Daily Intelligencer. Please go to the article for further citations and the comments section. I just want to add that a lot of the rhetoric revolves around ideas like: wealthy people just want to keep their neighborhoods nice (who wouldn’t want that?) and high valued, but, we should be FOR higher density in our communities. I support historic preservation for lots of reasons, and I’ve never been wealthy. Historic preservation is about valuing quality materials and design, human scale and unique cultural environments. It’s not about stopping progress or making our own history, but instead about keeping what’s of human value from our past. I’m not for dense cookie-cutter communities made out of glorified cardboard, and I’m not for residents losing control of their communities in order that wealthy, powerful, corporate interests can do whatever they please. I like what one commenter (JamieGlas) wrote:\n\nThe Atlantic’s Anti-Historic-District Argument Is Wrong and Extreme\n\nOver at The Atlantic’s urbanist magazine-in-a-magazine, CityLab, writer Kriston Capps turns a rhetorical blowtorch on the concept of the historic district, particularly in residential neighborhoods. Family homes don’t warrant protection, he argues, because, well, they’re homes, and people should be able to do what they want with them. Whole clusters of homes are even less deserving of protection, he argues, in a multipronged, bipartisan case — none of which I buy.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPending Bills Would Greatly Hurt Local Preservation Efforts\n\nHouse and Senate bills were introduced to the Michigan legislature last month that would deflate community efforts to control their own local historic resources. The proposed amendments to the state’s historic districts law go against existing and long-standing federal laws and the accomplishments made at the state and local levels. The bills also totally oppose what citizens desire regarding historic preservation efforts as outlined in Michigan’s State Historic Master Plan, 2014-2019. Instead of reinventing the wheel, reproduced below is Michigan Historic Preservation Network’s Advocacy Alert concerning HB 5232 and SB 720. Links to sample letters for your ease of advocacy are included. ___________________________________\n\nMichigan Historic Preservation Network\n\nAdvocacy Alert: Historic Resources in Jeopardy with HB 5232 / SB 720\n\nWe need your urgent attention and immediate action. On January 26th, Rep. Chris Afendoulis, R-Grand Rapids, and Sen. Peter MacGregor, R-Rockford, introduced identical legislation into the Local Government Committees of the House and Senate. House Bill 5232 and Senate Bill 720 have serious detrimental impacts to historic resources and local historic districts through proposed amendments to Michigan’s Local Historic Districts Act, PA 169 of 1970.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhat We Have Lost\n\nBy Vicki Priest (enlarged and edited on 3/31/16)\n\nBuildings aren’t people, yet buildings can be unique, beautiful, contain rare materials and can be a face in the community for centuries. A building can represent a street, a community, a city; it can inspire awe and any number of other feelings or thoughts that make us realize that we can create something beautiful. Buildings can be the opposite, too. They can remind us of failing economies and the loss of community pride, as when a school falls into disrepair, or when newer buildings are simple, cheap, cookie-cutter, letting us consider how we now live in a throw-away culture. For example, 805 Pine Grove Avenue used to be the home of an astonishingly handsome home (Second Empire style), but in its place now is an abandoned gas station.\n\nLooking through images of houses and churches that have been razed in Port Huron, I was negatively impressed by the loss of some of the city’s most notable architecture. It’s very hard to imagine how it could’ve been thought that tearing such structures down was better than brainstorming ways to repurpose them. Other structures were lost due to neglect and fire. Below is a very sad example of the urban downscaling that has happened in Port Huron. The first image is of an undated photo, showing a block of historic buildings on the left (one of them was quite unique), with the second image showing them all to be gone. (These images will be updated when more information and better quality photos are acquired.)\n\nSome homes made way for the primary hospital in town. While time doesn’t stand still and communities grow, the homes torn down for the hospital expansion didn’t have their windows and other structural and architectural components removed for recycling purposes (for use in other historic structures that need replacements). Below are some examples. An inventory of lost resources will be listed in the Lost Properties page.\n\nThe beautiful church structure at left was considered the “crown jewel” of downtown Port Huron (Creamer 2006). It was sold to the city in 1969 and subsequently demolished; there is now a parking lot in its place.\n\nBelow are the homes mentioned earlier, demolished in 2006 for the hospital expansion. They do not appear to have had valuable components removed first.\n\nVery few of the original hotels in Port Huron remain today. Sadly, the “skinny” Lauth Hotel (and bar) no longer stands. “Built to resemble the famed Flat Iron Building in New York City in 1902, it was destroyed in the Urban Renewal Movement of the 1970’s” (Gaffney, accessed Feb 2016). Instead of creatively integrating it into condominium architectural plans, it was simply razed. The whole area where it stood used to be an attractive little city center with brick pavers, but not any more.\n\n__________________\n\nPS. A local authority had told me of this house, and having discovered specifically which house it was in Port Huron, I wanted to append it to this article. St Joseph Catholic Church had owned it and then demolished it, despite it being in the city’s Olde Town Historic District. Believers are called to be stewards of God’s creation, and quality buildings are made of choice and rare materials that God provided. The workmanship required to make such structures may also be considered a gift from God. Apparently, the community wanted this structure saved, the city offered them free amenities, and there was even someone who wanted to move it. Yet the church acted ungraciously (from what I’ve been told) and tore the building down anyway. Why such waste when it could’ve been removed instead? There is nothing but grass there now. There are many reasons why The Church has dwindled in the last decades, and this attitude of disregard–for others in the community and for God’s gifts–could be one of them.\n\nSources\n\nBromley, Suzette (former curator for the Port Huron Museum), Rootsweb page, which holds scanned images from various collections held by the Port Huron Museum, and the Library of Congress.\n\nCreamer, Mary Lou (and the History and Research Committee of the Port Huron Sesquicentennial Steering Committee, c. 2006), Port Huron: Celebrating Our Past, 1857-2007.\n\n(TJ) Gaffney’s Pinterist page\n\nGaffney, TJ, Port Huron, 1880-1960 (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2006).\n\nOlde Town Historic District\n\nPhoenixMasonry.org"
