        "text": "The best thing about being a kid used to be going to the Saginaw County Fairgrounds off Genesee Avenue knowing you'd get to see animals, ride all the rides, get elephant ears and maybe a concert or a horse race.\n\nThere wasn't a bad seat when you were sitting in the Grandstand. Wait until you see how bad it looks now, below.\n\nOld Saginaw County Fairgrounds\n\nQuick facts about the beloved fair and fairgrounds:\n\nThe first Saginaw County Fair was held 1866 on other properties.\n\n1919 was the initial building process for several structures on the property.\n\n1920's new gates constructed.\n\n1929 Main Gate was built at Genesee Ave & Webber St.\n\n1950s-1970s Saginaw Fair was considered the largest east of the Rocky Mountains - over 300,000 people would attend, annually.\n\nMain Gate used main point of entry until the last fair held on that site in 2001.\n\nNew Saginaw County Fairgrounds located near Chesaning, MI.\n\n2002 Saginaw Housing Commission bought the property.\n\n2009 many buildings demolished.\n\n2014 Main Gate is added to National Register of Historic Places, pictured above.\n\n2023 -- officials are still trying to get remaining buildings demolished to repurpose property according to MLive.\n\nSee MI's Best Small Town Restaurant\n\nWhat does the Old Saginaw County Fairground property look like now?\n\nTime has not been kind to the property since it hosted the final event in 2005. Nature took over, quickly. Today all the remains are remnants of the fun had by all as documented by Wasteland Explorer on Facebook -- thanks for sharing with us. Soon, nothing will be left of the old property.\n\nWARNING: Under no circumstances should you enter this property. By doing so you risk bodily harm and/or prosecution for trespassing on private property."
